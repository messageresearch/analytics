[3:44] Book of Daniel um we have just a little
[3:47] bit here for the Book of Daniel the 2
[3:50] chapter um I've
[3:53] uh I think that I I I've done I I tried
[3:56] to pull out mainly what I was looking at
[3:59] in Daniel chapter 1 I just have a little
[4:01] bit tonight in Daniel chapter 2 uh I
[4:04] won't be able to get through this whole
[4:05] chapter of course but it's just
[4:07] something the Lord's kind of just been
[4:09] nudging me this way so I I just want to
[4:11] share some things that I'm that I'm
[4:12] seeing in here in Daniel the 2 chapter
[4:15] let's starting the first verse and if
[4:18] you could bring it up um brother Nathan
[4:20] could I get you to do some reading um
[4:23] you might want to bring your Bible if
[4:24] you want or you can read mine either uh
[4:27] Daniel chapter 2 and we're going to read
[4:29] here
[4:30] from Daniel chapter 2 to verse 30 is it
[4:34] is verse 2 1 to 30 is that okay with
[4:37] y'all if we read the Bible a little bit
[4:39] okay this is going be a
[4:43] verse and in the second year of the
[4:45] reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar
[4:47] dreamed dreams wherewith his Spirit was
[4:50] troubled and his sleep break from him
[4:53] then the king commanded to call The
[4:54] Magicians and the astrologers and the
[4:56] sorcerers and the Chaldeans for to show
[4:59] the king his dreams so they came and
[5:01] stood before the king and the King said
[5:03] unto them I have dreamed a dream and my
[5:05] spirit was troubled to know the dream
[5:08] then spake the Chans to the king and
[5:10] syak oh King live forever tell thy
[5:13] servants the dream and we will show the
[5:14] interpretation but the king answered and
[5:16] said to the Chans the thing is gone for
[5:19] me if you will not make known unto me
[5:21] the dream with the interpretation
[5:23] thereof you shall be cut in pieces and
[5:25] your houses shall be made a dung Hill
[5:28] but if you show the dream and the
[5:29] interpretation thereof you shall receive
[5:31] of me gifts and rewards and great honor
[5:34] therefore show me the dream and the
[5:35] interpretation thereof they answered
[5:38] again and said let the king tell his
[5:39] servants the dream and we we will show
[5:41] the interpretation of it the king
[5:43] answered and said I know of certainty
[5:45] that you would gain the time because you
[5:46] see the thing is gone for me but if you
[5:49] will not make known to me the dream
[5:51] there is but one decree for you for you
[5:53] have prepared lying and corrupt words to
[5:55] speak before me till the time be changed
[5:57] therefore tell me the dream and I shall
[5:58] know that you can show me
[6:00] the interpretation thereof the Chaldeans
[6:03] answered before the king and said there
[6:04] is not a man on the earth that can show
[6:06] the king's matter therefore there is no
[6:09] King Lord nor ruler that asks such
[6:11] things at any magician or astrologer or
[6:14] Chalan and is a rare thing that the king
[6:16] requireth and there is none other that
[6:17] can show it before the king except the
[6:19] gods whose dwelling is not with flesh
[6:22] for this cause the King was angry and
[6:24] very Furious and commanded to destroy
[6:26] all the wise men of Babylon and the
[6:28] decree went forth that the wise men
[6:30] should be slain and they sought Daniel
[6:32] and his fellows to be slain then Daniel
[6:34] answered with counsel and wisdom to arok
[6:38] the captain of the King's Guard which
[6:40] was gone forth to slay the wise men of
[6:42] Babylon he answered and said to arok the
[6:44] king's Captain why is the decree so
[6:46] Hasty from the King and then arok made
[6:48] the thing known to Daniel then Daniel
[6:51] went in and desired of the king that he
[6:53] would give him time and that he would
[6:54] show the king the
[6:56] interpretation then Daniel went to his
[6:58] house and made the thing known to an
[6:59] anah mishael and Azariah his companions
[7:03] that they would desire mercies of the
[7:05] god of Heaven con concerning this secret
[7:08] that Daniel and his fellows should not
[7:09] perish with the wise men of Babylon then
[7:12] was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a
[7:14] night vision then Daniel blessed the god
[7:16] of Heaven Daniel answered and said be
[7:19] blessed be the name of God forever and
[7:20] ever for wisdom and might are his and he
[7:24] changeth the times and the seasons he
[7:26] removeth Kings and sth up Kings he he
[7:29] giveth wisdom unto the wise and
[7:31] knowledge to them that know
[7:33] understanding he revealeth the deep and
[7:35] secret things he knoweth what is in the
[7:37] darkness and the light dwelleth with him
[7:40] I thank thee and praise thee Oh thou God
[7:42] of my fathers who hath given me wisdom
[7:44] and might and has made known unto me now
[7:47] what we desired of thee for thou Hast
[7:49] now made known unto us the king's matter
[7:52] therefore Daniel went in unto arok whom
[7:54] the king had ordained to destroy the
[7:55] wise men of Babylon he went and said
[7:57] thus unto him destroy not the wise men
[7:59] of Babylon bring me in before the King
[8:01] and I will show unto the king the
[8:03] interpretation then arok brought in
[8:06] Daniel before the king in haste and said
[8:08] thus unto him I have found a man of the
[8:10] captives of Judah that will make known
[8:12] unto the king the interpretation the
[8:15] king answered and said unto Daniel whose
[8:16] name was
[8:18] belthazar Art Thou able to make known
[8:20] unto me the dream which I have seen and
[8:22] the interpretation thereof Daniel
[8:25] answered in the presence of the king and
[8:26] said the secret which the king hath
[8:29] demanded cannot the wise men the
[8:31] astrologers The Magicians the
[8:33] soothsayers show unto the king but there
[8:36] is a God in heaven that reveal secrets
[8:39] and maketh known to the King
[8:40] Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the
[8:42] latter days thy dream and the visions of
[8:44] thy Head Upon thy bed are these as for
[8:48] thee Oh King thy thoughts came into thy
[8:50] mind upon thy bed what should come to
[8:52] pass Hereafter and he that revealeth
[8:54] Secrets maketh known to thee what shall
[8:56] come to pass but as for me this secret
[8:58] is not revealed will to me for any
[9:00] wisdom that I have more than any living
[9:02] but for their sakes that shall make
[9:05] known the interpretation to the king and
[9:07] that thou mightest know the thoughts of
[9:09] thy
[9:11] heart God bless his word as you could be
[9:13] seated
[9:14] tonight amen I know that was a little
[9:17] bit of a lengthy reading and and that's
[9:19] the reason we got brother Nathan to do
[9:21] it he does such a a good job amen and uh
[9:25] but but you uh but it's hard to break
[9:27] that up without you hearing the story
[9:29] it's kind of a it's a little bit hard to
[9:31] break it up and I just thought it was
[9:32] such good reading today I thought my
[9:34] it'd be good everybody to be able to
[9:35] just just hear that kind of that is the
[9:37] story of course if you if you continue
[9:39] reading later you'll find that it goes
[9:41] into the actual dream but we wanted to
[9:44] stop with just this portion of this and
[9:46] I want to talk to you a little bit
[9:47] tonight from Daniel chapter 2 I want to
[9:49] talk to you about the dream and and
[9:52] God's answer to these dreams and uh if
[9:55] you if you uh go back and read some
[9:58] things brother brandham had to say is in
[10:00] principles of Divine Healing brother
[10:02] Bram said how many ever dreamed a dream
[10:04] he said let's see your hand he said now
[10:06] most normal people is going to because
[10:08] that's your subconscious we'll call it
[10:10] and listen your subconscious he says now
[10:13] nor your conscience and he's your
[10:15] subconscious people didn't dream a dream
[10:17] at all there's this way back now I
[10:19] believe God deals in dreams that's right
[10:21] King Nebuchadnezzar and Joseph and many
[10:23] of them and so forth he dealt with
[10:25] dreams but a Seer isn't that
[10:27] way uh in Jesus Christ the same he said
[10:30] if you tell me what a dream was and then
[10:32] you can't tell me if you can't tell me
[10:34] what a dream was then you can't tell me
[10:36] what the interpretation is but if you'll
[10:38] tell me what I dream the thing's gone
[10:40] from me reveal it back to me then I know
[10:43] your interpretation is right now brother
[10:45] BR talks a little bit about dreams and
[10:47] shows that dreams is actually and I'll
[10:49] I'll paraphrase many of the things but
[10:50] he'll talk about dreams being a
[10:52] secondary way uh for God to reveal
[10:54] things he actually Compares it to the
[10:56] interpretation of tongues like if you
[10:58] someone would speak in tongues he said
[11:00] now you you know speaking in tongues he
[11:02] said but there there needs to be an
[11:03] interpretation of the tongue before it
[11:05] could become prophecy now uh you you you
[11:08] can all know this and you've been in
[11:09] meetings or in the services and you've
[11:11] heard somebody speak in tongues with no
[11:12] interpretations or something but but but
[11:15] you must realize that there are diverse
[11:17] kinds of tongues and some tongues are
[11:19] worship and praise and and even
[11:21] sometimes they tongues of prayer and uh
[11:23] you've even heard in a prayer line once
[11:25] in a while you've heard prayer when
[11:27] tongues break in there what it is it's a
[11:28] channel of prayer uh that sometimes is
[11:31] reached to break a spirit that's upon a
[11:33] person or something of that nature but
[11:35] it in no wise is meant to be a message
[11:37] to the church but when there is supposed
[11:40] to be brought a message to the church
[11:41] there should be an interpretation of the
[11:43] tongues that would be uh a message
[11:46] otherwise it's an unclear thing so
[11:48] brother mam Compares this exactly with
[11:51] uh tongues and interpretation with
[11:52] dreams and interpretations in other
[11:54] words you you don't you don't want to
[11:55] tell a dream to a church as just a
[11:57] symbol because without without an
[11:59] interpretation it actually causes more
[12:01] confusion than it does giving Clarity to
[12:04] something so if God's going to send
[12:06] something there's one huge things that
[12:08] we know about the Lord is he is not the
[12:10] author of confusion God does not author
[12:13] confusion so sometimes we're all
[12:15] dreamers and sometimes you can get too
[12:17] much to eat or you can you can you can
[12:19] have a rough night you can dream things
[12:20] and sometimes dreams can be symbolic and
[12:23] and they can they can have things you
[12:24] know Christians Can Dream certain things
[12:26] are going to fall or something's going
[12:27] to happen so and it's symbolic it tears
[12:29] their minds all up and they'll start
[12:31] making things out of it and and the
[12:33] devil will get into the thing y'all
[12:34] remember a woman come to brother Bram
[12:36] one time it was standing on White Sands
[12:38] and her whole family was having trouble
[12:40] and when brother BR began to discern her
[12:41] he said well sis he said you see all
[12:43] this trouble and this Darkness he said
[12:45] but but but in the dream you're standing
[12:47] on White Sands he said which means that
[12:49] everything is okay but because you don't
[12:52] know it's okay you're nervous and you're
[12:53] causing your whole family to be nervous
[12:55] so you're see so all of that was coming
[12:57] and in the dream it just it got worse
[13:00] but because she couldn't interpret it
[13:01] she thought it was something bad but
[13:03] when a prophet got a hold of it he said
[13:04] really there's nothing wrong you're
[13:06] standing in a good place but all these
[13:08] things is coming out so so dreams can be
[13:11] both good and bad and so when we when we
[13:13] start looking at dreams of course
[13:15] there's ways to handle dreams and I I
[13:17] can say this to you in in looking here
[13:19] at dreams is is that we we have gifted
[13:21] dreamers here in the church I know
[13:23] personally I dream once in a while and
[13:25] see it but if if there's not a prophet
[13:28] in the land to interpret dreams then
[13:31] then you you see if God gives you a
[13:33] dream that dream will be without symbol
[13:36] you you'll dream a dream in in other
[13:38] words you won't have to a question
[13:40] because the dream you have will be
[13:42] actually without a symbol in other words
[13:44] if you come up you have all these
[13:45] symbols and you tell me the dream said
[13:47] can you tell me what it means brother BR
[13:49] said unless I can tell you the dream I
[13:51] can't tell you what it means so if you
[13:53] give someone a dream and I I'll tell you
[13:55] this for your for your benefit amen that
[13:58] the spirit of cism has long abused
[14:01] dreams itself I I know people when you
[14:03] got ready to uh maybe the Lord was
[14:05] leading you to do something else or go
[14:06] to different church amen there's always
[14:08] that dreamer in the church it comes and
[14:10] say I dreamed your children's going to
[14:11] be struck by this and you're going to
[14:13] lose your ministry and this is going to
[14:15] happen and this is going to happen it's
[14:17] Amen because dreams are so easily used
[14:19] for control and that's why demonic
[14:22] spirits can move through gifts unless
[14:24] they're operated according to the
[14:26] scripture amen now what we're looking
[14:28] here at as we're looking at something
[14:30] scripturally that brother bam uses
[14:33] Nebuchadnezzar to establish something
[14:35] that if God's going to deal with you he
[14:37] deals with you in reality in other words
[14:39] if you're if he's going to show you
[14:41] something in a dream it'll be right out
[14:43] if it's not right out then just lay it
[14:45] on the shelf and don't worry about it
[14:47] because there's not a prophet in the
[14:48] land to tell you what it means and it
[14:50] will become confusion and a place to
[14:53] lose Faith or a place for someone to
[14:56] control you I I can say that without
[14:58] with by personal experience I can
[15:01] promise you that that dreams become a
[15:03] place of control because if you tell
[15:05] somebody what you dream they can take
[15:08] every little symbol in that dream and
[15:09] make it mean something whether it means
[15:11] that or not but they use it for their
[15:13] own good now I know none of you's ever
[15:15] had any kind of experiences to make you
[15:17] go through things like that but but I
[15:19] Brother David I have had a couple like
[15:21] that in my lifetime amen but but I'll
[15:24] say this to you amen but God uses dreams
[15:27] and when God uses a dream amen those
[15:29] dreams are precise and per perfect you
[15:32] know it don't even have to be someone
[15:34] amen who is exactly right to have a a
[15:37] right dream nor does it have to be
[15:38] somebody exactly right to have a right
[15:41] prophecy now here in the Bible King
[15:43] Nebuchadnezzar is having a dream and he
[15:45] is a Babylonian King but God is dealing
[15:48] with him in a dream and he's going to be
[15:50] telling the future not just the future
[15:53] of his kingdom but this man is going to
[15:56] tell the entire events throughout
[15:59] history from his day until the setting
[16:01] up of the Millennium of Jesus Christ can
[16:03] you imagine God would reveal that in a
[16:06] dream amen but when when Nebuchadnezzar
[16:09] has this dream amen it is a it is a very
[16:12] important dream it's a very powerful
[16:14] dream but there is a Vindicated Prophet
[16:17] on the scene to interpret that dream and
[16:20] give direction to the church now some
[16:23] people actually call us Pentecostal
[16:25] because we worship and because we have a
[16:27] good time and shout and praise God Glory
[16:29] well I I I I I I I found some of the
[16:31] same people that call us Pentecostals
[16:33] they have dreams and symbols and then
[16:35] they interpret those symbols and and try
[16:37] to bring direction to the church when
[16:39] really that's what Pentecostalism is is
[16:42] when amen when when you go into one
[16:44] another looking for an answer to
[16:45] spiritual matters amen knowing that that
[16:48] that unless it is a Vindicated profit
[16:52] every situation must be judged with two
[16:55] witnesses yeah I'm talking about some
[16:57] real things here Heen I'm talking about
[16:59] Direction amen because every kind of
[17:02] spirit in the world wants to set the
[17:04] direction of a church or the direction
[17:06] of a family or direction of the life
[17:09] amen but there is going to be a bride in
[17:11] the last day that will have a perfect
[17:14] Faith by A Perfect interpretation of the
[17:18] word of God Amen in other words there is
[17:20] coming in the last day of bride that
[17:22] will have a rapturing faith rapturing
[17:25] faith will be a perfect faith and
[17:27] Perfection of faith can only be
[17:29] established by a Vindicated word of
[17:32] almighty God anything else outside of a
[17:35] Vindicated Prophet there is a measure of
[17:38] error in their thinking or in their
[17:39] dreams or in their ideas so it's not a
[17:42] place that we can build our lives but
[17:45] where we can build amen now I'm bringing
[17:48] this to you for a reason because brother
[17:49] random said when a man comes into
[17:51] contact with God by the answer of the
[17:54] word he said you can't twist it out of
[17:57] that man you can't twist it away from
[17:59] that man because he's received an answer
[18:01] that is greater than he is now maybe
[18:03] maybe you could come and you could have
[18:04] a dream you come to me and you say well
[18:06] brother way I dream this and this and
[18:08] this amen and you could tell me the
[18:09] symbols and all that and I could say
[18:11] well that sounds pretty good and I could
[18:13] say well maybe it's like this and maybe
[18:15] it's like that and and you could put a
[18:17] little faith in it and that'll last a
[18:18] little while but let it get really hard
[18:21] let let the trial get really hard and
[18:24] when when the trial gets really hard
[18:26] amen you'll find out whether you're in
[18:28] cont with God or the intellect of a man
[18:31] and if it's just intellectual it'll
[18:33] break down when the trial starts coming
[18:35] but if you ever get in contact with God
[18:38] it don't matter what happens it don't
[18:40] matter what takes place you have an
[18:42] answer from God and you'll hold on to
[18:44] that answer no matter what it is and
[18:46] that answer will rule over your life
[18:49] because you know that that answer has
[18:51] come from God now now when when I say
[18:54] this I find that in the scripture here
[18:56] of course these These Dreams this dream
[18:59] that has come to Nebuchadnezzar of
[19:00] course it's about world events it's a
[19:02] it's a great big uh it's a great big
[19:04] dream amen and and of course he has
[19:08] Daniel and these three h Hebrew children
[19:10] in his in his uh in his kingdom and you
[19:12] got all these chadians and you got all
[19:14] these wise men you got all these people
[19:16] here now think of this because when this
[19:18] man has a dream what has happened now is
[19:21] the mystery has become a challenge upon
[19:24] who is just psychologically and
[19:27] intellectually wise or who is
[19:29] spiritually wisdom now spiritual wisdom
[19:31] and intellectual wisdom is a huge
[19:33] difference because you can school
[19:35] intellectualism you can school a way to
[19:38] speak you can school a way to understand
[19:41] but you cannot you cannot School the
[19:44] interpretation of something you don't
[19:46] know about from man you just can't
[19:49] school that amen because it takes a
[19:51] spiritual inspiration to bring that in
[19:54] you see what's beautiful is they had all
[19:56] these preachers they had all these
[19:57] denominations they had all these
[19:59] teachers and whenever Nebuchadnezzar has
[20:01] the dream he said come and give me the
[20:03] interpretation and they all show up with
[20:05] joy amen we're going to get to interpret
[20:07] another scripture we're going to get to
[20:09] break it down and tell the king what it
[20:11] means and and they get in there and the
[20:13] King says well I tell you what you do
[20:15] you tell me the dream and then I'll know
[20:18] you're telling me the interpretation and
[20:20] they said wait a minute ain't nobody can
[20:22] do that and he said that's right if I
[20:24] tell you the dream and I tell you he
[20:26] said you've got lme words and corrupt
[20:29] things to tell me in other words he knew
[20:31] that false interpretation come by them
[20:34] having wisdom of his dream but if they
[20:37] had no wisdom of the dream and they told
[20:39] the dream they surely would know the
[20:41] answer to the dream because the same
[20:44] wisdom that could tell it is the same
[20:45] wisdom that could interpret it amen
[20:48] isn't that beautiful that all the way
[20:50] back in the Book of Daniel God was
[20:51] already showing that he would put a
[20:53] mystery in the last day that would
[20:56] separate a prophet from from the schools
[20:58] and the susers and the psychologists and
[21:01] all of the wise who would have ever know
[21:03] that God would put a mystery in the
[21:05] Bible or he would put a mystery in the
[21:07] Kingdom of Babylon Amen to show who
[21:10] really was the prophet in that
[21:12] generation God was not only telling amen
[21:16] the world what was about to come he was
[21:18] telling them that you got a prophet
[21:20] among you that's different than ever
[21:22] suser he's different than ever chadan
[21:25] he's different than ever wise men this
[21:27] man is a different kind of preacher than
[21:30] any preacher that you've ever come in
[21:31] contact with oh I tell you tonight amen
[21:34] you you hear my suggestions and that's
[21:36] what exactly I mean that God would put a
[21:38] mystery in the last day I me of the
[21:41] scripture of the Bible but he put the
[21:43] mystery in there on purpose that he
[21:46] might deviate the difference between all
[21:48] of the schools and Elijah the prophet of
[21:51] God whom God would spiritually discern
[21:54] truth to in the last days can you
[21:57] imagine go back there amen and look at
[21:59] the scripture I I think it's an amazing
[22:01] parallel pull up Malachi CH 4 vers uh uh
[22:05] Verses 4 5 and six I believe it is amen
[22:07] Malachi chapter 4 pull it up now watch
[22:10] the watch the parallel in the scripture
[22:12] in Daniel chapter 2 when they couldn't
[22:14] tell the dream what did he do he told
[22:16] him that he was going to destroy them is
[22:18] that right amen now remember you the law
[22:20] of Moses my servant a commanded in horm
[22:22] with the statutes and judgments the
[22:24] fifth verse behold I send unto you
[22:26] Elijah before the coming of the the
[22:28] great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[22:29] what's the next verse and he should turn
[22:31] the hearts of the children to their
[22:33] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[22:38] with a curse unless there is a spiritual
[22:42] Ministry of a prophetic anointing in the
[22:45] last day the whole world is going to be
[22:48] destroyed in the Book of Daniel the 2
[22:51] chapter the same challenge was being
[22:53] placed upon the church to come up with
[22:56] an interpretation which was completely
[22:59] impossible by their own by their own by
[23:01] their own admittance they said nobody's
[23:03] ever asked anybody to do this cuz nobody
[23:05] can do this who is it that can do this
[23:08] who can tell a man the dream and then
[23:10] tell him and finally the wise men even
[23:13] go as much as to say he said even nobody
[23:15] ever ask it because nobody can do it and
[23:18] the only person that could do it is God
[23:20] and he don't dwell in the flesh Now
[23:22] isn't it amazing that the Babylonians
[23:24] had separated God from Humanity they put
[23:28] God somewhere way out there on a up
[23:31] somewhere way out on the line they put
[23:33] him way out somewhere amen and and and
[23:35] in no way could God Be In the Flesh of
[23:38] man no there was no there was no
[23:40] connection with Humanity in the god that
[23:42] they serve amen but let me tell you this
[23:45] all the while they were talking God had
[23:47] a man right there in their Kingdom that
[23:50] was able to discern and able to tell
[23:53] what the secret of that great king was
[23:56] now it's a beautiful thing because of
[23:57] course they were facing a curse they
[23:59] were facing destruction and so is it in
[24:02] Malachi 4 that the Earth was going to
[24:05] come into a curse unless that God would
[24:08] send a prophet unless somebody could
[24:11] spiritually deserve do you see what we
[24:13] didn't need we didn't need another
[24:15] school we didn't need another person to
[24:17] draw a chart on the map and tell us the
[24:19] timeline of the Old Testament and how it
[24:22] fit with the New Testament and how the
[24:24] gospels come together and how the books
[24:26] was arranged and amen the schools has
[24:28] been doing that for 2,000 years but with
[24:30] every bit of that think of this with
[24:32] every bit of that the Bible said unless
[24:34] Elijah would come it'll be cursed it'll
[24:37] be destroyed and God was saying unless
[24:40] there's a gift that can spiritually
[24:42] discern the need of that hour amen the
[24:45] curse will come and no flesh will be
[24:47] saved but if it would come there would
[24:49] be a Rapture of a church there would be
[24:52] a restoration of faith if it would come
[24:54] there would be a group of people on the
[24:56] Earth who would be an invincible me that
[24:59] would be a group of people with a
[25:00] perfect Faith with a perfect
[25:02] understanding with a perfect Vindicated
[25:04] word of God can you imagine if he would
[25:06] come amen think about this a minute
[25:09] brother Ram tells us this amen he tells
[25:11] us of how that Nebuchadnezzar's dream
[25:13] was to be interpreted now it's amazing
[25:16] that brother Brandon will say that this
[25:18] dream was the thing amen that brought us
[25:20] to that point amen of how that the dream
[25:24] would tell the time a gentile time now
[25:27] isn't it amazing dreams and
[25:29] interpretations is now tied to Gentile
[25:32] kingdoms and the timing of the Gentiles
[25:35] now it's beautiful because brother
[25:37] Randon will tell us this in a message s
[25:40] is this the end time amen he actually
[25:42] what s what time is it he preaches it in
[25:45] 1962 I I would I would say that you
[25:48] should listen to it I I I compel you to
[25:50] go home and listen to this sermon but
[25:52] serves this the end time Amen in
[25:54] paragraph 48 brother Ron begins with six
[25:58] different dreams that has been given in
[26:01] the in the spring of 1961 throughout the
[26:04] fall of 1962 there's six different
[26:07] dreams and the one you know most about
[26:09] of course is Junior Jackson's dream how
[26:11] many remembers the dream brother BR goes
[26:13] high up on a no remember and he was
[26:15] preaching and the water started coming
[26:17] started washing back the the grass and
[26:19] he said while he was standing there
[26:21] there was a rock began to be exposed he
[26:23] said and brother Bram had all of them
[26:24] Gathering up and they were looking on
[26:26] that he said because there was a place
[26:28] there that that that was Unwritten word
[26:31] was being revealed on that rock and had
[26:33] them all gathered up there and brother
[26:34] man said he said to them look on this
[26:37] remember and then he stepped back and he
[26:38] said mysteriously there was a a bar
[26:41] coming to his hand brother B said a
[26:42] sharp tool and he took that and knocked
[26:44] the top of that mountain off and when he
[26:47] did there was word in there that the
[26:49] light had never Shone on before y'all
[26:52] remember that well when brother B tells
[26:54] that dream Amen in CES it's the time he
[26:57] said when he said look on this he said
[26:59] that's being fulfilled tonight cuz
[27:02] brother Brandon was asking the church
[27:04] what time is it and he was telling the
[27:06] dream of Junior Jackson and he said now
[27:08] watch he said what was that first the
[27:10] waters wash the dirt off and showed that
[27:12] White Rock he said what was that he said
[27:14] that was the mysteries of baptism of the
[27:16] Holy Ghost and predestination these
[27:18] things has been talked about down
[27:19] Through the Ages he said but when the
[27:21] top of that mountain was knocked off
[27:23] with that sharp tool he said in there
[27:25] were things that had never been revealed
[27:27] he said which was the opening of them
[27:29] Seven Seals because the whole Bible had
[27:32] been sealed up by Seven Seals and light
[27:35] had never shined upon that portion of
[27:38] the word before how many knows that
[27:40] brother bam taught us that when Elijah
[27:42] comes in Revelations 10 that the mystery
[27:45] of the Seven Seals will have been a
[27:47] total secret up to that time nobody has
[27:50] ever knew what them seals were they were
[27:53] completely shut up brother B said John
[27:56] wept about it because they had been shut
[27:58] up until the end time but jar Junior
[28:01] Jackson was dreaming about it but he
[28:03] didn't know what it was he just knew
[28:05] brother brand was catching a a tool in
[28:07] his hand now y'all know that was in
[28:08] February of 1961 how many realizes amen
[28:12] that in that same fall of 1962 Amen
[28:15] brother beer has a dream remember amen
[28:17] sister Stephy has a dream that's a
[28:19] popular one you all might remember it
[28:21] brother R was having a marriage going in
[28:23] the in the Tabernacle and they brought
[28:25] food remember and she was a little
[28:27] troubled they were eating in the
[28:28] sanctuary and they realized that they
[28:30] were serving a food and it was a perfect
[28:32] food but the bride wasn't perfect y'all
[28:34] remember that and brother R said see it
[28:36] was a perfect food he said it was
[28:37] spiritual food it was a spiritual
[28:39] marriage going on there was a spiritual
[28:41] food being served he said now remember
[28:43] that spiritual food greatest battle ever
[28:46] fought instead of going overseas we'll
[28:48] pack these barrels full of of of perfect
[28:50] word amen remember Christ The Mystery of
[28:52] God revealed he starts it by saying Lord
[28:55] let there be a tape Lo or Baro this
[28:57] morning what was it a prophet was
[28:59] packing the word into storage containers
[29:02] for the Church of the Living God to live
[29:04] on down through this time of this of
[29:07] this of this problems that we're going
[29:08] to have down Through the Ages because
[29:11] God was restoring the church to an
[29:14] answer of a Vindicated word but he was
[29:16] putting it on audio recording have y'all
[29:19] ever think about that that God so loved
[29:21] you that your answers aren't just in
[29:23] books but you heard the voice of a
[29:26] prophet of God give you the answer in a
[29:28] Kentucky English in a humble way amen
[29:31] there's some things brother brandham
[29:33] said had brother brandham himself not
[29:35] said it I wouldn't have believed it but
[29:37] because he said it he's a Vindicated
[29:39] prophet and I believed it every bit the
[29:41] way he said it amen I I I just want to
[29:44] share something with you have you ever
[29:46] thought about this Heen the seven seal
[29:48] tape the original one do y'all know that
[29:50] they stopped that tape amen just about a
[29:53] half hour before the end amen and the
[29:55] next morning on Monday morning brother
[29:56] Brown re-records an an end to the seven
[29:58] seal and puts it on and when that tape
[30:01] goes out for years people thinks that's
[30:04] the tape or the only that was the
[30:06] original tape that was made and on it he
[30:09] said tonight I'm omitting the revelation
[30:11] of the Seven Seals so around the world
[30:13] people were teaching the seven seal had
[30:15] been omitted he hadn't told it but
[30:17] brother brandham had pre-recorded that
[30:20] while he was in his own Tabernacle and
[30:22] he took it with him to his grave come on
[30:25] church but after brother Ram died they
[30:27] released that portion of the seven seal
[30:30] and the portion you have now is a
[30:32] portion he recorded in his own voice of
[30:35] saying I have received the revelation of
[30:38] the third pull which is the seven seal
[30:41] which is the ministry of Christ which
[30:43] was the opening of the and do you see
[30:45] what it was it was the word of God
[30:47] coming to the church and God was
[30:49] recorded to the church now I don't have
[30:52] time to go through all these visions and
[30:53] dreams but I'll tell you this God gives
[30:55] six different dreams here in the here in
[30:58] these few chapters brother beer and
[30:59] sister Stephanie and brother Collins and
[31:02] Junior Jackson and all these dreams were
[31:04] leading up to the opening of The Seven
[31:07] Seals or brother Ram going out to Sunset
[31:10] Mountain out in Tucson to receive the
[31:12] Revelation now brother Ram says watch
[31:14] here there is six different dreams and
[31:17] brother bam held the interpretation of
[31:19] every one of them dreams until he
[31:21] preaches the message serves as this the
[31:22] inside or what time is it serves but in
[31:26] this book he tells the dream dreams and
[31:28] then he tells the interpretations of
[31:31] those dreams and but he don't just do
[31:33] that he also gives a vision so there's
[31:36] six dreams and a vision leading up to
[31:39] brother bradam going out there at sunset
[31:41] Mountain now some people say well
[31:43] brother Wayne what's so important about
[31:44] that think about this a minute now right
[31:47] now we're reading a vision and a dream
[31:50] of Daniel and Nebuchadnezzar which
[31:51] foretold the future amen now some of the
[31:55] things that is in Daniel chapter 2 has
[31:57] not been completely fulfilled yet amen
[32:00] we're looking into the future some of
[32:01] the things that were said are not
[32:03] completely revealed amen but 90% of it
[32:06] probably has already been fulfilled in
[32:09] Nebuchadnezzar's dream and because of
[32:11] the Fulfillment of it we have seen that
[32:14] 90% of it was been already accurate to
[32:16] the very date of the changing of
[32:19] Kingdoms then why wouldn't we believe
[32:22] that the future events Amen in the Book
[32:24] of Daniel would also stand just as
[32:26] accurate as the past events because God
[32:29] was proving to them they wasn't just
[32:31] getting a dream there was a prophet
[32:33] there to interpret and give them an
[32:36] answer are you hearing me tonight Church
[32:38] you may dream the dream but it don't
[32:40] mean it's the answer but when you got a
[32:43] prophet's word concerning a situation
[32:46] that is the answer to the devil's
[32:48] question that is the answer to
[32:50] everything that's going on in a person's
[32:53] life amen Now by God's accuracy he tells
[32:56] these different things brother bam
[32:57] actually says it he dreamed a dream and
[32:59] interpreted the Gentile Kingdoms in
[33:02] verse 121 in paragraph 121 of influence
[33:06] he said everything the Bible has spoke
[33:07] of says here history it's happened the
[33:10] Bible said here his see it's happened
[33:12] now we're at the time of the Rapture
[33:15] it's going to happen see it's happened
[33:17] it's happened it's going to happen
[33:20] because you're watching perfect
[33:22] interpretation of the word have you ever
[33:24] wondered why when brother bam tells that
[33:26] the grizzly bear will be a certain
[33:28] height he'll shoot it a certain way why
[33:31] did he tell 42 inches to the to the
[33:33] Caribou horns why did he say we'll cross
[33:35] three strings and then we'll get a muddy
[33:37] one then we'll get a clear one then
[33:39] we'll fish three days you'll catch two
[33:41] fish won't catch another one why is he
[33:43] telling those things he didn't have to
[33:44] do that but God was using those things
[33:47] to prove to the people standing around
[33:50] him that he had an answer from God
[33:53] according to the traveling not just of
[33:56] the individuals that was walking with
[33:58] him are you hearing me it wasn't just
[33:59] for the men who was fishing with him if
[34:02] he could tell them how many fish they
[34:03] were going to catch tomorrow couldn't he
[34:05] tell the church what was coming down the
[34:08] road and what was going to be we have
[34:10] had a prophet Among Us Church we've had
[34:13] a perfect a Vindication of the word of
[34:16] God in our age and there should not be
[34:18] one question left in the Church of the
[34:21] Living God there has been a dissolver of
[34:24] Doubt among us to dissolve every
[34:26] question whether God is real whether God
[34:29] keeps his word what does God do in these
[34:32] certain situations there should be an
[34:34] answer there in the heart of every
[34:37] believer Amen to declare six dreams and
[34:40] a vision amen watch God gave it to us
[34:43] now in the in the in in the CES this the
[34:46] time we're actually paralleling that
[34:48] with Daniel chapter 2 because it was a
[34:52] it wasn't actually brother Bram having
[34:53] the dreams it was brother Bram doing the
[34:55] interpreting which brought which brought
[34:58] several people into connection to
[35:01] actually sanction amen what the prophet
[35:04] was saying at that time how many
[35:06] realizes when you're listening to a tape
[35:09] and you hear an amen that that actually
[35:11] means something to you now now you may
[35:14] not uh realize this I've actually got a
[35:16] quote here I don't know if I I can find
[35:18] it exactly right now amen but brother BR
[35:21] I'm going tell this he'll actually say
[35:24] to the Brethren while they're there he
[35:26] said now listen you say amen and he's
[35:29] taping this and he said now as you're
[35:32] saying amen he said this tape is going
[35:35] to go out into the world and people are
[35:37] going to hear your voice saying Amen on
[35:40] this he said which is sanctioning that
[35:43] I'm telling the truth I thought oh my
[35:46] amen I my voice ain't on that on that
[35:49] tape but let it be here now amen that
[35:52] I'm sanctioning what he said is the
[35:54] truth because the secrets that had been
[35:57] hid of course was what was going to be
[35:59] preached in the seven seal the ministry
[36:02] of William brandham was going to be
[36:05] unfolded in three different phases of
[36:08] his ministry that would be a first pool
[36:10] that would be a healing that would be a
[36:12] second pool which would be a prophesy
[36:15] but the third pool would be the opening
[36:17] of the word to bring an answer to the
[36:20] church for Vindication that would bring
[36:22] a rapturing anointing into the church
[36:25] see the third pole would be the Ministry
[36:28] of a prophet giving you the answer on
[36:30] the word my when you when you get this
[36:33] you've got an answer from God upon the
[36:36] word of God think about this a minute
[36:38] amen if if someone comes stumbling in
[36:40] here tonight and you're praying about
[36:42] something and they said well I feel it
[36:43] could be this way or I feel it could be
[36:45] this way but if God has used a prophet
[36:47] to tell you what it means there should
[36:50] not be anything to shake you from what a
[36:53] prophet said according to the scripture
[36:56] you said brother Wayne why are you
[36:57] driving this in so strong because I want
[36:58] you to realize something if you're going
[37:00] to get rapturing Faith it's got to come
[37:03] from absolute faith it has to be
[37:07] absolute Vindication it's got to be
[37:09] absolute truth if there is one hole in

[37:36] prophet that's what it is do you see
[37:38] there will be a message in the last day

[38:06] angels something lifted him up something

[38:11] themselves how many ever heard the
[38:13] vision of the third pole he said
[38:15] something lifted me up and I heard him
[38:17] say I'll meet you in there come on
[38:20] church this Prophet was not just going
[38:22] to Bible school to learn these symbols
[38:25] and to learn what this Bible was talking
[38:27] about about this was Supernatural
[38:29] instruction by almighty God to bring an
[38:32] answer back to the church my amen what's
[38:36] it going to do it's going to bring
[38:38] Vindication now Vindication is going to
[38:40] be the answer when God fulfills the
[38:43] scripture then the scripture is truly
[38:46] Vindicated if somebody says something's
[38:48] going to take place when it takes place
[38:50] is the Vindication of it doing it of it
[38:52] happening now the white wig of course
[38:55] that you seen out there that picture you
[38:57] see it all the time what's it actually
[38:59] mean now a lot of people says it means a
[39:01] lot of things but it actually means a
[39:03] perfect identification of the
[39:05] Vindication of the message of truth that
[39:07] it's true it's not a third person it's
[39:09] the only person it's the word see what
[39:12] happened out there on Mount Sunset it
[39:15] was the quickening power of God bringing
[39:17] the seals to the church he is the one
[39:20] that opens these seals see Daniel Daniel
[39:24] and the chadians and all the wise men
[39:26] said there is nobody O King who can tell
[39:30] you this matter because you won't tell
[39:32] us how can we tell you you ever noticed
[39:36] in the revelations the 8th chapter in
[39:37] the first verse the Bible said and when
[39:39] the seven seal was open there was
[39:41] silence in space of a half hour now in
[39:44] every other seal there's a horse that
[39:46] rides there's something under the seal
[39:48] but when it comes to the seventh there's
[39:50] total silence there's nothing there in
[39:53] Matthew 24 he's silent on the matter
[39:55] he's silent upon these things because
[39:58] he's waiting for an end time bride who's
[40:01] going to need an answer in the middle of
[40:03] Satan's Eden that can withstand every
[40:06] devil and every interpretation amen if
[40:09] the devil gets a hold of it he'll twist
[40:12] it up and turn it around and make it
[40:14] mean this and make it mean that but if
[40:16] God will leave it a secret until the
[40:18] last day bride and then he will
[40:21] interpreted that bride that hears the
[40:23] opening of the word will be lifted up
[40:26] they'll be lifted up
[40:27] of this Leia they'll be lifted up in a
[40:30] realm of faith and Truth my Lord with an
[40:34] answer from God they'll be lifted higher
[40:37] what is it it's not the intelligence of
[40:39] man it's the quickening power of
[40:41] God now of course brother bam would tie
[40:44] that dream under sunset Mountain you
[40:46] said brother Wayne what are you talking
[40:48] about I'm talking about 1 Thessalonians
[40:50] 4 the Lord himself shall descend from
[40:52] heaven with a shout and that shout will
[40:54] be a message a Vindicated word and that
[40:58] word will be according to the prophet a
[41:01] living bread of life bringing forth the
[41:03] bread and we understand that the wise in
[41:07] the last days shall understand oh my
[41:11] there's five foolish and five wise
[41:12] virgins right and the five wise virgins
[41:15] wise virgins the wise shall understand
[41:19] according to the Bible when the
[41:21] bridegroom came the five foolish wasn't
[41:23] ready but the five wise was ready why
[41:26] was they ready brother B said because
[41:28] Malachi 4 makes them ready Malachi 4
[41:32] brings the bride ready for the rapturing
[41:35] of the church the Bible said in
[41:37] Revelations 19 the wife hath made
[41:40] herself ready how do we get ready
[41:42] brother Wayne you got to put on the
[41:44] garments of the revelation of the
[41:46] message of the hour we have been robed
[41:49] in the revelation of the righteousness
[41:51] of God no wonder Paul said I am not
[41:54] ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[41:56] we're by amen whereby is the power of
[41:59] God under salvation amen we've been
[42:02] robed in the righteousness of the word
[42:04] of God do you know that you're clothed
[42:06] in this age in this age of nakedness in
[42:09] this age of false interpretations but
[42:11] there's a bride who is literally clothed
[42:14] and she's not just clothed with anything
[42:16] she's been clothed with the immortality
[42:18] of the spoken word of God which is
[42:22] Incorruptible amen think about it you've
[42:24] been clothed with incorruption in an out
[42:27] of corruption but it's changing the
[42:29] direction of your life and moving you
[42:31] from doubt to Faith and from failure to
[42:34] rising up in the power of
[42:37] God I'm talking about lifting somebody
[42:39] above the
[42:41] crowd I'm talking about what Daniel did
[42:44] brought Daniel and the Hebrew children
[42:46] above the crowd they were lifted by the
[42:49] understanding of Daniel Amen and so is
[42:52] it in the last day that a bride has been
[42:54] lifted by the understanding of a prophet
[42:57] in their age you've been lifted from

[44:53] that Jesus the king would come riding
[44:55] upon the C the F of an asked he would
[44:57] come riding down in Jerusalem he
[44:59] actually said that he would do it how
[45:01] many questions was who's the messiah
[45:04] when's he coming what did that really
[45:05] mean what did Zechariah talk about
[45:08] questions was everywhere but on one
[45:10] specific morning Jesus come riding into
[45:13] Jerusalem and brother R said what was it
[45:16] he was the answer to zachariah's
[45:18] prophecy he was the answer to the whole
[45:21] thing my Lord and those that recognized
[45:25] that he was the answer they begin to
[45:27] worship Him and begin to sing hosana
[45:30] hosana cometh in the Name of the King I
[45:33] tell you some of them were shouting some
[45:35] of them was praising some of them was
[45:37] ripping Palm leaves off of the trees
[45:39] because they didn't have anything they
[45:41] were taking off their coats and throwing
[45:44] it down in front of those in front of
[45:46] that mule because they knew that that
[45:48] was the answer and let me say something

[46:09] life my he was the answer to the prophet
[46:13] prophecy they rejected the answer that
[46:15] day what the word manifested right now
[46:18] brother manam said but the same writer
[46:21] Zachariah who prophesied in that first
[46:24] coming he said he also prophesied that
[46:27] second
[46:28] coming and said in Zechariah he said it
[46:31] shall come a day that shall be night
[46:33] night or day but in the evening time it
[46:37] shall come light is that right
[46:40] scriptures are going to be fulfilled the
[46:42] word is going to become manifest a
[46:45] prophet is going to manifest the word
[46:47] and it's going to produce a bride amen
[46:49] that not only has the answer but will

[47:11] is actually happening he said it is
[47:13] turned from the prophet to his prophecy
[47:15] it moved from the prophet to his
[47:17] prophecy and when the prophecy was being
[47:19] manifest it culminated in worship and
[47:23] praise and power because Faith had come
[47:26] into the Earth oh Church of the Living

[47:44] Ram's Book of Life didn't go back to
[47:46] heaven in the hands of the lamb but the
[47:48] prophet said that the Revelation was
[47:50] handed unto the Bride of Jesus Christ
[47:53] and John was commanded to take the book
[47:55] oh not just take take it but you eat the

[57:10] standing in the pull pit saying well the
[57:11] message ain't really what you thought it
[57:13] was and you can live any way you want
[57:15] and do anything you want but man said
[57:16] there he is crucifying Jesus Christ the
[57:19] second time not on Calvary not on a
[57:21] cross but behind the pull pit not
[57:24] Killing Jesus but he's killing in the
[57:26] effect of the word of God instead of it
[57:29] becoming the headship it is becoming the
[57:32] back pew and it's just another idea but
[57:35] Jesus desires more than just being in
[57:38] the church he wants to be the head of
[57:40] the body he wants to be the head of the
[57:42] race he wants to be the answer that's in
[57:45] your mind he wants to be the power
[57:47] that's in your resolve he wants to be
[57:49] the Holy Ghost that's in your life he
[57:51] wants to be it all brother Ram says it
[57:53] you think I'm beside myself but I'm not
[57:58] we've got the answer it's not him that
[58:01] liveth but it's Christ that liveth in me
[58:03] watch what he says not my idea his
[58:06] power not my idea his power then tell me
[58:10] an answer don't have a power tell me a
[58:12] true answer don't have a power if you
[58:15] really know something to be the truth
[58:17] nobody can back you off of it nobody can
[58:19] tear you down there is power and
[58:21] understanding that's why under the age
[58:23] we're living in it's not a man age age
[58:26] it's not an ox age it's an eagle age
[58:29] amen God sent the greatest power to the
[58:32] end time bride which is the prevailing
[58:34] power of Revelation and what the church
[58:37] needs Above All Things is a revelation
[58:40] of the
[58:43] Rapture people said brother Wayne what's
[58:45] the revelation of the Rapture glad you
[58:47] ask that's a good
[58:49] question it's a good question it's a
[58:51] good
[58:53] question let it set just a minute
[58:55] explain
[58:57] going of all the questions all the
[58:59] revelations what really is the
[59:01] revelation of rapture what is it what
[59:03] what what what really is it what what is
[59:05] that key
[59:07] Revelation you ready we got the
[59:11] answer he said when this bride knows who
[59:16] she
[59:17] is then the Rapture will
[59:22] go didn't you mean the understanding of
[59:26] who you really
[59:27] are is the revelation of rapture then
[59:31] you must be more than some leay all to
[59:35] see you must be more than just some
[59:37] church member that come in here come on
[59:40] chch you got to be something more than
[59:42] just another person living you must be
[59:45] an
[59:46] attribute of a most high God that when
[59:49] the last attribute comes in it'll be the
[59:52] answer to the raptures anointing that
[59:55] comes up upon the church what is it it's
[59:57] the headship the headship is here that's
[1:00:00] the answer the headship is here God is
[1:00:02] Vindicated the headship is here my the
[1:00:06] headship the answer is here Christ the
[1:00:09] Risen Savior is here where is he brother
[1:00:12] Wayne he's in
[1:00:14] you they run around for years he's here
[1:00:17] he's here he's here I kept saying where
[1:00:20] where he's here he's in
[1:00:24] you but the same people that said he's
[1:00:26] here don't believe in prayer lines they
[1:00:28] don't believe in altar calls they don't
[1:00:30] believe in manifestations of tongues and
[1:00:32] visions and gifts of God Amen if God is
[1:00:35] in you then all of God is in you all
[1:00:38] that was in God was poured into Christ
[1:00:41] and all that was in Christ was poured
[1:00:43] into the
[1:00:44] church God didn't put his powerless
[1:00:46] portion in The Bride come on church he
[1:00:49] didn't take a powerless portion and give
[1:00:51] you just a little tradition amen but if
[1:00:54] God give you a part of himself y'all
[1:00:56] know the quote he's omnipotent he's all
[1:00:59] power and if there is any God in you all
[1:01:02] of God is in you all the power of God is
[1:01:06] within the
[1:01:08] [Applause]
[1:01:10] church I'm in overtime but I feel good
[1:01:14] Hallelujah there an hour Church you're
[1:01:17] the bride of
[1:01:20] Christ so brother Wayne how in the world
[1:01:23] we're going to get Bible because he's
[1:01:24] already judged it
[1:01:27] now I'm in I'm in about three paragraphs
[1:01:28] of Christ the mystery he cannot pass
[1:01:31] judgment for he's already judged that
[1:01:33] body in which I'm a part of you say how
[1:01:36] am I a part of it here it is it's it's
[1:01:40] in
[1:01:43] me it's in
[1:01:45] me spoken word Original Seed y'all know
[1:01:48] it here's the
[1:01:50] secret the word is in the
[1:01:54] bride
[1:01:56] Vindicated word not just not just ideas
[1:01:58] his power could I say it like this the
[1:02:01] answer is in the bride and the mind of
[1:02:05] Christ to know what he wants done with
[1:02:07] that
[1:02:08] word y'all know it's the truth I hear
[1:02:12] guessing look what he says the Holy
[1:02:14] Spirit gave to the church in Christ of
[1:02:17] mystery if I could get the to see that
[1:02:20] there is the body of Christ Living
[1:02:21] standing
[1:02:23] redeemed sh my we are his victory the
[1:02:27] church is his victory look what he says
[1:02:29] in the bottom of that paragraph we are
[1:02:31] already potentially erased because we
[1:02:33] have raised from the dead of unbelief in
[1:02:36] his word from denominational Creeds to
[1:02:38] an eternal word of an eternal God which
[1:02:41] is he himself working through US
[1:02:43] manifesting himself he is the same
[1:02:45] yesterday today and forever what's he
[1:02:48] doing Satan is doing everything he can
[1:02:50] do to keep you from seeing
[1:02:52] that to see that you're already redeemed
[1:02:56] you're already aart he's trying to keep
[1:02:59] you from seeing you are the
[1:03:01] victory to keep you looking for victory
[1:03:04] when you are the victory to keep you
[1:03:06] looking for an answer when you are the
[1:03:11] answer can you imagine when it brother
[1:03:13] Christopher when it struck brother
[1:03:15] random that he was the seventh
[1:03:19] angel everybody's looking for him can
[1:03:22] you imagine the moment when it struck
[1:03:24] him
[1:03:26] I am the seventh angel what a
[1:03:36] morning can you
[1:03:38] imagine that ought to be the same it'll
[1:03:41] be the same Epiphany to
[1:03:45] you I didn't mean to slip over in the
[1:03:47] Greek but it's a good word to explain it
[1:03:49] is
[1:03:52] it Satan's doing everything he can keep
[1:03:54] you from seeing it try to keep you from
[1:03:56] saying the real meaning of this word
[1:03:59] doing it notice he's trying to keep you
[1:04:01] from seeing it because watch now the
[1:04:04] word moves down in the
[1:04:06] body from the head what he is the same
[1:04:09] word nothing could be added to taken
[1:04:12] from it and as the day comes down into
[1:04:14] the body down the body vindicating they
[1:04:15] are one see what's going on a record now
[1:04:19] of them being the same is the word being
[1:04:22] manifested now it's because in God of
[1:04:25] this evil age brother Ram said this has
[1:04:26] a direct answer it has a direct answer
[1:04:30] now we know that people will deny this
[1:04:32] answer as they did anointed ones the end
[1:04:35] time brother bam said they'll preach
[1:04:36] Pentecost from the Bible while denying
[1:04:38] the Vindicated
[1:04:41] word we see it all the time preach
[1:04:43] Pentecost from the Bible but deny
[1:04:45] present truth
[1:04:47] right but the Vindicated word in his
[1:04:50] body is his very Victory and the reason
[1:04:53] of his death now in case you're still
[1:04:56] looking for the Ezekiel 37 Army to stand
[1:05:00] brother bam says she's standing on her
[1:05:05] feet you hear me you're not a sleeping
[1:05:08] virgin you are a standing
[1:05:12] army you're not a sleeping Church you're
[1:05:14] a standing
[1:05:15] army an invincible Army so brother when
[1:05:19] that's coming someday know you're the
[1:05:21] answer
[1:05:23] Hallelujah my Lord
[1:05:27] that's when I I got to read this one to
[1:05:29] you now we see the Promise being
[1:05:31] fulfilled Christ the true headship going
[1:05:34] in coming in his
[1:05:38] bride oh my
[1:05:41] goodness I like to done back flips I
[1:05:44] didn't even know that was in
[1:05:45] there do you know that was in there I
[1:05:47] didn't know that was in
[1:05:49] there his promise being fulfilled Christ
[1:05:51] the true
[1:05:53] headship coming in
[1:05:56] his
[1:05:58] bride what are we talking about we're
[1:06:01] talking about the bride coming of Christ
[1:06:04] in and
[1:06:06] through his bride listen to me tonight
[1:06:09] friend as our musicians will come Daniel
[1:06:12] the 2 chapter gives us a
[1:06:15] reality that God has a way to give a
[1:06:18] people a Vindicated
[1:06:21] answer to hide it as a total Secret and
[1:06:26] to make all men try it and
[1:06:28] fail and then raise up the one who can
[1:06:32] give the
[1:06:33] answer he gave them 2,000 years to come
[1:06:36] up with the answer and they couldn't do
[1:06:41] it and God took a little simple Kentucky
[1:06:45] Hill
[1:06:47] belly and lifted him up into the Pyramid
[1:06:50] of himself and revealed things to him
[1:06:52] that had been hidden for the ages shine
[1:06:58] light you got the answer
[1:07:01] tonight what you going to do with
[1:07:04] it you got your
[1:07:08] answer but what are you going to do with
[1:07:10] that
[1:07:11] answer I tell you what we are to do with
[1:07:13] that answer tonight we are to take it
[1:07:16] and drive the devil off every bit of our
[1:07:17] property that's
[1:07:20] right we should take the answer of God
[1:07:24] the authority of the word says amen amen
[1:07:27] and drive that devil off of every
[1:07:29] god-given promise we have won't you
[1:07:31] stand to your feet with us
[1:07:36] tonight we
[1:07:38] have by God's help a perfect
[1:07:43] interpretation to the perfect
[1:07:48] word so brother Wayne do you believe in
[1:07:50] dreams I do I've dreamed dreams so
[1:07:54] precise
[1:07:56] if anybody somebody maybe catch this
[1:07:58] tape someday they'll know they they can
[1:07:59] they could call you and tell you if they
[1:08:01] wanted
[1:08:02] to dream is so precise to to stand in
[1:08:06] front of a man in a dream one
[1:08:08] day and tell him that he had a situation
[1:08:11] in another town with a young lady and he
[1:08:13] had a rumor ined and told him the name
[1:08:14] of the
[1:08:19] town situations come up that so precise
[1:08:23] some of the deacons here know such
[1:08:25] situation sometime just a few years ago
[1:08:27] the Holy Spirit spoke directly so we
[1:08:29] believe in dreams but when dreams come
[1:08:32] in
[1:08:33] symbols then you need to ride them down
[1:08:36] and let them
[1:08:38] be and then see what the Lord
[1:08:40] does so we have some dreamers we have
[1:08:43] some tongue talkers we have some Vision
[1:08:45] I know this personally I've heard it and
[1:08:47] seen it so people say brother Wayne
[1:08:49] where's the gifts it's it's here we got
[1:08:51] to answer it's literally in the body
[1:08:53] just cuz you don't see it on the floor
[1:08:54] here don't mean it don't happen some
[1:08:57] well does it happen every service well
[1:08:59] that would be a bit Pentecostal wouldn't
[1:09:01] it so what do you mean by that well
[1:09:03] we'll just summon up the gift givers
[1:09:05] then and we'll tell them to operate so
[1:09:07] then we start operating the gifts
[1:09:09] instead of the gifts operating
[1:09:11] us and people will come along with
[1:09:13] pressure and they'll say well if you got
[1:09:14] the gifts let's produce it do you know
[1:09:16] that's the same voice that was on the
[1:09:18] cross with
[1:09:20] Jesus the same one well brother way if
[1:09:23] God was with y'all wouldn't there be
[1:09:24] more of the there's just as much as God
[1:09:27] wants in here because it's wide open to
[1:09:30] him sir whatever he wants to
[1:09:33] do we have a pasture wide open to the
[1:09:36] spirit of God if God wants to
[1:09:39] move this is a place he can move I just
[1:09:43] be honest I heard brother Brown is this
[1:09:44] little tape serves us what time is it he
[1:09:47] said he's talking to Jeffersonville he
[1:09:49] said you might he said I believe you're
[1:09:50] probably the most spiritual crowd I
[1:09:51] preached to and when he started saying
[1:09:53] that I I mean I got a lot of good
[1:09:54] friends preach a lot of good churches
[1:09:57] but Brother Ray I believe it's a
[1:09:58] spiritual church I preach to I believe
[1:10:00] people with understanding and spiritual
[1:10:03] understanding and the depths of the word
[1:10:05] it's never one thing I like about it you
[1:10:06] can't get too
[1:10:08] hard you can't get too simple you can't
[1:10:12] get too
[1:10:13] deep as long as the anointing is there
[1:10:15] it's exactly
[1:10:18] right is that
[1:10:20] true now it's just whenever maybe my
[1:10:24] personality gets involved when it gets
[1:10:26] in
[1:10:27] trouble by the way just toward the end
[1:10:30] of this service I want to say a little
[1:10:32] something
[1:10:33] here uh I have come to realize that my
[1:10:36] personality is a certain way and you
[1:10:38] can't help that you try to die out to it
[1:10:40] and brother B said to you on worst enemy
[1:10:42] and I I probably know more myself than
[1:10:44] anybody on my worst
[1:10:46] enemy but I I I found out today that
[1:10:49] there was somebody in a meeting some
[1:10:51] time ago come by and said something to
[1:10:52] me and I didn't respond exactly and
[1:10:55] they've been a little hurt at me for a
[1:10:57] couple years I didn't know anything
[1:10:59] about it I I'm quick to
[1:11:02] apologize very quick because I didn't I
[1:11:06] I would never do anything on purpose to
[1:11:07] hurt anybody so can can I say that by
[1:11:10] saying this if I have ever in
[1:11:12] unknowingly cuz if it's happened it's
[1:11:15] unknowingly if I've hurt somebody In
[1:11:17] This Crowd by something I say or certain
[1:11:19] direction or something like you you
[1:11:20] forgive me yeah would you do that yes
[1:11:24] would would you because it's not in my
[1:11:27] uh even the other day I was preaching I
[1:11:29] was come along and I hit those uh I hit
[1:11:31] that wine you know which I I ain't going
[1:11:33] to apologize for that that's
[1:11:34] true but then I I I moved from that and
[1:11:37] was talking about the oddness of people
[1:11:38] and I went over to that uh that oil I
[1:11:41] can't even remember the name of it now
[1:11:42] I'm
[1:11:43] shocked essential that's right and and
[1:11:47] somebody said to me later said brother
[1:11:48] why you really whack that good and I
[1:11:49] thought well I didn't really mean cuz I
[1:11:52] don't think essential oil is wrong
[1:11:56] now I had to say that cuz my wife uses
[1:11:58] that stuff so and I was praying it
[1:12:00] wouldn't
[1:12:02] [Music]
[1:12:04] work and she puts it on her leg you know
[1:12:06] cuz her legs hurt she said I think this
[1:12:08] stuff's going to work man it stinks you
[1:12:09] know and I was thinking Lord I hope it
[1:12:11] don't work cuz I got to slip in the
[1:12:12] other
[1:12:14] [Music]
[1:12:15] room so so in saying that don't think
[1:12:19] don't go away and think brother Wings
[1:12:20] against essential oil if it helps you it
[1:12:22] helps you I was really meaning that
[1:12:24] we're willing to SM smell bad because
[1:12:25] something works you know cuz it it does
[1:12:28] stink I mean I ain't no apology for that
[1:12:31] stuff you know it's
[1:12:34] right but she she tries to get me to
[1:12:37] wear it all the time she got a little
[1:12:38] headache stick you know and she I say a
[1:12:42] I can't do
[1:12:43] [Music]
[1:12:45] it we together so so in saying that if
[1:12:50] if I bump you in a way that hurts don't
[1:12:53] don't ever don't don't take it that I'm
[1:12:54] trying to H I really mean that
[1:12:56] light-hearted but even beyond that
[1:12:59] so it it it would make me lose sleep to
[1:13:03] think that I have said or done something
[1:13:05] to hurt one of God's people I I'm
[1:13:07] sincere in saying that I if I honestly
[1:13:11] knew that I had said or done something
[1:13:12] to hurt you I'd get up and come to your
[1:13:15] house in the middle of the night to fix
[1:13:17] that so please if if ever you need just
[1:13:20] be sure cuz it just it just shocked me
[1:13:23] to know that I could hurt somebody not
[1:13:24] even know it so I want to say God bless
[1:13:27] you all tonight bless and I want to say
[1:13:29] that we have an answer young
