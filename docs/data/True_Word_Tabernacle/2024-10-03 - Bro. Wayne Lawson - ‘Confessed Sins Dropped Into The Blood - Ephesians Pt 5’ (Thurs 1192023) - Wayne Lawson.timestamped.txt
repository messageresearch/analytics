[3:43] bless you tonight if you have your
[3:44] Bibles I'd like to turn to the book of
[3:47] Ephesians the first chapter and if we
[3:50] could the seventh verse Ephesians
[3:52] chapter 1 and verse 7 um I'm I'm still
[3:55] in this F Visions I'll be in this a
[3:57] while I'm not sure that I'll take every
[3:59] service in in it but uh it's just um
[4:02] there's some things here that are very
[4:03] uh close and I I didn't even start to
[4:06] cover on Sunday morning and just uh
[4:08] thought if God be merciful we would just
[4:10] continue that tonight um Ephesians
[4:12] chapter 1 and verse
[4:14] 7 amen I want to read here uh in whom we
[4:19] have Redemption through his blood the
[4:22] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[4:26] riches of his grace in whom we have
[4:30] Redemption through his blood brother R
[4:31] said now notice the book of Ephesians is
[4:33] not to everyone it's to the believer so
[4:36] he's saying that we have been redeemed
[4:38] Believers now sealed into the body the
[4:41] Redemption was by the blood but by the
[4:44] same blood there is the Forgiveness of
[4:47] sins and brother Braham said now
[4:49] remember this is to the believer so he's
[4:51] talking about after your a Christian
[4:55] amen we want to ask the Lord to bless
[4:56] his word tonight as you could be seated
[4:58] I want to take this tonight and uh I
[5:00] think they said it was part five I do
[5:02] want to uh just give it a subtitle if we
[5:04] can put it on there amen um confess sins
[5:08] dropped into the blood confess sins
[5:11] dropped into the blood so our subject
[5:13] tonight you know is going to be speaking
[5:15] on confessed sins dropped into the blood
[5:19] in the book of Isaiah the first chapter
[5:21] the 18th verse brother Bram gives us a
[5:24] tremendous uh uh insight into this
[5:26] scripture and he he speaks on it many
[5:29] times s uh brother Bram yes from the
[5:31] book of Isaiah the first chapter 18th
[5:33] verse Isaiah uh speaking for the Lord
[5:37] here come now and let us reason together
[5:40] saith the Lord for though your sins be
[5:43] as Scarlet they shall be white as snow
[5:47] though they be red like Crimson they
[5:51] shall be as wool brother Braham uses
[5:54] this for the subject of conference many
[5:56] times he speaks upon it and uses this
[5:59] for confence conference and and brother
[6:00] brand been speaking about conference is
[6:03] he says something very powerful here in
[6:05] 1960 uh it's in June there in the
[6:08] message having conferences and brother B
[6:10] says something really I just loved how
[6:12] he said it he said now what a conference
[6:14] means he says it's moving the
[6:17] opposition what conference means it
[6:20] means moving the opposition then you can
[6:23] have a healing Services when you get the
[6:25] Thomases out you get the doubters out
[6:27] all these other things all the formals
[6:29] out the Fig leaves all come off and
[6:32] strip them down to the skin and cover
[6:35] them with the blood then their sons and
[6:37] daughters of God removing the
[6:40] oppositions uh brother Bram is teaching
[6:42] us now amen and and you can go through
[6:45] uh these sermons and they're very
[6:46] powerful but he says something here all
[6:49] the Fig leaves off and strip them down
[6:51] to the skin then cover them with the
[6:53] blood amen and if you go back to the
[6:56] message of uh of conferences you'll find
[6:59] it's a a it's a powerful subject brother
[7:01] B beginning was saying he's living in a
[7:03] time where a lot of conferences has
[7:05] happened back in the 40s and 50s you
[7:07] went through the world wars and the
[7:09] world was entering into conferences and
[7:12] and they had started uh joining together
[7:14] because there had been times of
[7:15] opposition there have been great
[7:17] troubles and states of emergencies he
[7:19] said so they needed to sit down and talk
[7:21] things through he said and and and he
[7:24] said now there's not a greater
[7:25] conference in the world than the one
[7:27] that God calls you to so if man would
[7:30] have a reason to call somebody to a
[7:31] conference only when there's a need to
[7:34] he said but then God would call a man to
[7:36] a conference and then in that conference
[7:38] he would he would say let's discuss the
[7:41] problem of your life let's discuss the
[7:43] issues he said that that your sins shall
[7:46] be white as snow now I don't know about
[7:48] you but I never want to miss that
[7:49] conference amen that when God is going
[7:51] to take your oppositions and remove them
[7:54] whatever the situations or the sins or
[7:56] the the problems in your life so he's
[7:58] talking about the kind of conference
[8:00] that when he's finished with you there
[8:02] will be no opposition between you and
[8:04] God there will be no opposing of the
[8:06] spirit of God now the brother bam uh
[8:09] lays out his Eden conference and it's a
[8:11] it's a beautiful story and I'll not go
[8:13] through all of them but I thought this
[8:14] one was amazing because he goes through
[8:16] the Eden conference when God had created
[8:19] his own son and he had put him in
[8:21] Perfection both Adam and Eve was laying
[8:23] there in Perfection but that's When sin
[8:25] came in and and remember now when sin
[8:28] came into the garden of Eden and it took
[8:30] Eve and then Eve brought sin unto Adam
[8:33] now there was a judgment that had said
[8:35] the day that you eat you shall surely
[8:37] die now God could not change his word
[8:40] and God then had to had bring judgment
[8:43] upon them but look at the look at the
[8:45] grace of God when he heard how it must
[8:48] have been and you know brother B puts it
[8:50] in drama how it must have been when it
[8:52] word reached God that his children had
[8:55] sinned and were going to have to die
[8:58] brother Bram says it see it was such a a
[9:00] state of emergency he said he didn't
[9:02] send some angels down there he didn't
[9:04] send somebody to go look for them say
[9:06] hey go get my children and go do this
[9:08] but he said but God himself went looking
[9:11] for Adam and Eve he said he went he went
[9:14] down through the rolls of Eden crying
[9:17] Adam Adam Where Art Thou and right there
[9:21] in that single text Brother Braham said
[9:23] represents every man he said when man
[9:26] sins he runs from God but it's only God
[9:30] that searches for man see man
[9:32] immediately hides man it's the it's the
[9:35] Instinct of man I've done something
[9:37] wrong I'm going to get out of the
[9:38] presence of God I'm going to hide myself
[9:41] but God he says he's the one that came
[9:44] looking for you and that's why brother
[9:45] Bram said you never saved yourself and
[9:48] you never came looking for God he said
[9:50] but on the contrary God was the one that
[9:53] was looking for you and searched you and
[9:55] you said well it was me that went to
[9:56] that church and I was the one that got
[9:58] to the Altar and I was the one that yes
[10:00] but it was God that put it in your heart
[10:02] to do that unless God would do it the
[10:05] Bible said the goodness of God leadth
[10:07] under repentance is that right so it was
[10:09] God that did that and he went hunting
[10:11] Adam crying Adam Adam Where Art Thou
[10:14] because it was his son and he was
[10:16] interested in preserving his son brother
[10:18] R said the same thing tonight that the
[10:21] spirit of God is going up and down the
[10:23] aisles of the church crying for his lost
[10:26] children if something has happened or
[10:28] some situation has gotten in the way he
[10:31] said see God's not just going to leave
[10:33] that there but he's going to come and
[10:35] cry because God is actually interested
[10:37] in us now brother R said he said when he
[10:40] found Adam Adam was scared to come in
[10:42] his presence I just love how he says
[10:44] things he said he said Adam Adam Where
[10:46] Art Thou and he said I'm hiding in a
[10:48] bush I'm afraid to come out we're naked
[10:51] and brother R said God said who told you
[10:53] you were naked and remember he said then
[10:56] they said come here I want to talk to to
[10:59] you I want to have a conference with you
[11:01] and he said Adam cried back said Lord I
[11:03] don't have anything to wear I don't have
[11:05] anything to wear to a conference with
[11:07] you I'm I I don't have an appropriate
[11:09] clothing and he said that's when God
[11:12] took and killed a couple of lambs and
[11:14] took their skins and threw them in the
[11:16] bush he said put them on come out and
[11:18] talk to me can you imagine God providing
[11:21] them something that was even in a symbol
[11:24] that man could stand in the presence of
[11:26] God if you've ever read of Isaiah when
[11:28] he saw the the great sheriffs that stand
[11:30] in the presence of God the Bible said
[11:32] with two Wings they covered their feet
[11:34] and with two Wings they covered their
[11:35] eye brother man said he said Angels who
[11:38] had never sinned can not even look into
[11:41] the presence of God he said because he
[11:43] is such a holy God and here is a man
[11:46] that has had sin and he's looking at a
[11:48] holy God but God said I will provide a
[11:50] way amen that the man could stand again
[11:53] in the presence of God if you'll put
[11:55] this on you can come into my presence
[11:57] and we can talk about the issues and we
[12:00] can cause a remedy brother Ram said it
[12:02] was in that Ed conference when God
[12:04] decided how he would deal with man he
[12:06] said the first thing he had to do was
[12:08] strip the Fig Leaf from him you got to
[12:11] study and or you had to take note of fig
[12:14] Leaf cuz brother bram's going to use
[12:15] that all the way throughout his ministry
[12:17] fig Leaf religion or fig Leaf idea or
[12:20] fig Leaf way and brother R said I want
[12:22] you to know the Fig Leaf Way won't
[12:25] work he said so the first thing God had
[12:27] to do was strip that from him to replace
[12:31] it with a covering that would work see
[12:33] if God wasn't interested in our in our
[12:36] coming to him if God wasn't interested
[12:38] in us then God wouldn't have provide
[12:40] something for us to wear to come to the
[12:43] but God is so interested that he won't
[12:45] let us stay under a fig Leaf he's so
[12:48] interested he won't let us stay under
[12:50] our unbelief or our troubles but God so
[12:52] wants to have fellowship with us that he
[12:54] provides something for us that we might
[12:57] stand in his presence and by his grace
[13:00] so in the Eden conference there was a
[13:02] there was a um there was a a judgment
[13:04] went out or a how could I say it you
[13:07] know whenever now they're trying to
[13:08] swear in judges and especially the
[13:11] federal judges they they always ask them
[13:13] you know about abortion or they ask him
[13:15] about some they always ask him about
[13:16] some major issue uh uh that they feel
[13:19] that is important and and every one of
[13:21] those judges always say well I have an
[13:23] opinion but I'll stay with the law and
[13:25] I'll stay with the the preeminence of
[13:27] the law there's a word I'm looking for
[13:29] and it's left my mind tell me the word
[13:30] right quick it's when a judgment's made
[13:32] and then the and presidents of it thank
[13:35] you brother amen the presidence of a
[13:37] decision then it you don't have to try
[13:39] every case from then on Amen when it one
[13:42] you know when a case is tried and then
[13:44] that case goes to Supreme Court it's a
[13:46] president over and that's settled so God
[13:49] tried the case in Eden and said only the
[13:51] blood would
[13:52] work so we don't have to have another
[13:55] trial or another decision that is the
[13:57] result of decision of having a
[13:59] conference only the blood's going to
[14:01] work and and we find out this is exactly
[14:04] why that Jesus himself had to come down
[14:07] in human flesh because it wasn't just an
[14:10] angel it wasn't just a son it was God
[14:13] himself that would come to mankind
[14:16] because he was interested do you
[14:17] remember the other day we quoted to you
[14:19] uh from the burning bush conference
[14:20] brother Ram was talking about Moses he
[14:22] said when Moses had got see he went down
[14:24] and he tried to do something for the
[14:26] Lord but he but he done it on his own
[14:29] abilities and then he failed and the
[14:31] Egyptians run him out remember amen they
[14:34] run him out they they it's amazing if
[14:37] you get to looking at it he didn't
[14:38] appropriately cover the Egyptian did he
[14:40] he just buried it a little bit but it
[14:42] come up to him the next day so proven
[14:44] that you can't bury nothing it's always
[14:46] going to come right back to you and
[14:48] that's what drove it's what drove Moses
[14:51] out and when Moses was drove out on the
[14:53] back side of the desert brother Braham
[14:54] said he'd been there so long he lost the
[14:56] burden of the word and had forgotten the
[14:58] promise of Deliverance but when he went
[15:01] to the burning bush the Bible said I am
[15:04] come down to deliver the children of
[15:06] Israel and I have remembered my promise
[15:08] brother BR said then somebody was still
[15:10] interested in the children of God it was
[15:13] God that was interested and God is still
[15:15] interested in the children of God he's
[15:17] interested in your healings he's
[15:19] interested in your deliverance and
[15:21] that's the reason he came down himself
[15:23] and that's the reason he promised in the
[15:25] end time that a mighty Angel would
[15:27] descend from heaven with the shout and
[15:29] he would realign us with the truths of
[15:31] the atonement and the blood and the
[15:33] Forgiveness of sins because God didn't
[15:35] want to leave his bride under a figleaf
[15:37] religion of denominational forgiveness
[15:40] where you amen just lived your life
[15:42] under condemnation of sin and never
[15:44] really getting a victory but the message
[15:47] of the hour brought a total Deliverance
[15:49] back to the church and we don't have to
[15:51] live like denominational Christians we
[15:53] don't have to live like Sinners of the
[15:55] world but there was a promise of God
[15:57] that came upon the the church that the
[15:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost would be
[16:01] restored to the church and and a
[16:03] complete remission of sins under the
[16:06] power of the blood yes sir I'm the of
[16:09] the blood God is interested in you and
[16:11] he's not just interested in our adults
[16:14] he's interested in our children and in
[16:16] this age that we're living I God God
[16:18] help our kids amen what an age to try to
[16:21] live above sin but God made a promise
[16:24] you'd be able to he said I promise unto
[16:26] your children and your children's
[16:28] children and as many as the Lord Our God
[16:30] shall call that the baptism of the Holy
[16:32] Ghost could come upon the church and
[16:34] there would be something between you and
[16:36] God it would be something between you
[16:38] and God but it wouldn't be sin between
[16:40] you and God it would be the power of the
[16:43] blood atonement between you and God I'll
[16:45] tell you the only thing between the
[16:46] church and God tonight is one
[16:49] intercessor or
[16:51] mediator and that is the man Christ
[16:54] Jesus amen I say this tonight I believe
[16:58] I believe that God brought them uh a
[17:02] conference because he was interested and
[17:04] he's interested tonight and he was
[17:07] interested when they got to the Red
[17:10] Sea he was just as interested in his
[17:12] children when they met the opposition of
[17:15] the Red Sea as he was when he called
[17:16] them out listen God ain't brought us out
[17:19] to leave us he didn't bring us this far
[17:23] just to turn around and leave us he
[17:25] didn't bring you this far to say okay
[17:27] you're having now I'm just going to
[17:29] leave you in your trouble not the God I
[17:32] serve you come to church on a Thursday
[17:34] night maybe there's something going on
[17:35] in your life the kind of God I'm serving
[17:38] you might try to hide that but the god
[17:40] that we're serving will walk the aisles
[17:42] of the church and he'll call your name
[17:44] and you'll say deal with this child deal
[17:47] with this child get out from behind the
[17:48] Fig leaf and come out under the blood
[17:51] that you can have fellowship and have
[17:53] joy come on you're going to be in church
[17:55] anyhow you might as well live in Victory
[17:57] you're going to live this way anyhow you
[17:59] might as well live in Victory how long
[18:01] has Satan kept you under condemnation
[18:04] where you can't live like you really
[18:05] want to live but you can't go in the
[18:07] world cuz you know better so you're
[18:09] living between two things and you're not
[18:11] really getting the kind of Victory you
[18:12] really want but there's a promise of
[18:14] victory for every believer in this
[18:16] building tonight you can live so high in
[18:18] God until sin has been put under the
[18:22] blood yes I believe in it tonight I
[18:25] believe in the oldfashioned power the
[18:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost and it'll
[18:28] change your life every service every day
[18:31] amen because it's still the atoning
[18:34] power of Jesus Christ I believe it I
[18:37] believe that when they got to that Red
[18:39] Sea brother bandam teaches us a great
[18:40] story there he said that's when they had
[18:43] another
[18:44] conference yeah what we going to do with
[18:47] this opposition brother B said there it
[18:48] was the children of Israel was at the
[18:50] blood and there enemies couldn't cross
[18:54] over is that right that's when God turns
[18:57] Redemption
[18:58] into justification
[19:01] amen that's when he turns Redemption
[19:03] into justification now your enemy can
[19:05] follow you to the blood but that's as
[19:07] far as it can
[19:08] go your enemy can follow you to church
[19:12] are you hearing me your enemy can follow
[19:15] you to town your enemy can follow your
[19:16] home but he can't follow you through the
[19:19] blood and God was showing that Israel
[19:23] had left Egypt but Egypt had left Israel
[19:26] it was chasing them but God LED them to
[19:28] a place that would represent the blood
[19:31] of Jesus Christ and there would be a way
[19:33] for the redeemed to cross over and they
[19:35] could cross over in safety but when they
[19:38] got to the other
[19:40] side my the Bible tells us that God
[19:43] knocked the chariot wheels all of the
[19:45] Egyptians and they got stuck in the mud
[19:48] amen that's what happens when the devil
[19:49] tries to follow the children of Israel
[19:52] he gets stuck in the mud and I got news
[19:54] for that devil tonight and there's a God
[19:56] that'll knocked up wheels off of your
[19:58] Chariot and he'll stick you in the mud
[20:00] and the power of God will swallow that
[20:03] devil up do you see what happened can
[20:05] you imagine when the amen now there's an
[20:07] entire song written there in the book of
[20:09] Exodus I think it's Exodus 15th chapter
[20:11] they say it's the oldest recorded uh
[20:13] song that has been written amen so it
[20:15] was a new song at that time the Bible
[20:18] says that that song will be singing in
[20:20] heaven can you imagine amen when they
[20:22] break that one out amen the song that
[20:25] the Angels can't sing amen Moses to
[20:28] stand up and lead the course everybody
[20:29] El say Moses wrote that he wrote it in a
[20:32] contemporary
[20:34] Time come on it was F it was absolutely
[20:37] contemporary and and I'm not for rock
[20:39] and roll music but things that are
[20:41] written contemporary don't mean they're
[20:42] wrong
[20:44] folks every song you sing was new at
[20:48] some
[20:50] time come on and when them Pentecostal
[20:54] were singing there's going to be a
[20:55] meeting in the air the Lutheran thought
[20:57] they had lost their fanatical
[21:00] minds but it was contemporary because
[21:02] they had went from justification to the
[21:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost and they had
[21:07] something to sing about well listen
[21:09] brother if you ever come across the Red
[21:11] Sea and you ever seen your enemy dead in
[21:14] the sea of the blood and you know he can
[21:17] never get up and haunt you anymore yeah
[21:20] you would sing You' sing like you never
[21:22] sung before and Moses sanging the spirit
[21:24] and Miram got a tambourine and they
[21:27] danced on the
[21:28] on the W oh God on the banks of the Red
[21:31] Sea about to come in half I'm sorry amen
[21:34] they about danced on the Red Sea and the
[21:36] Bible tells us that the daughters of
[21:37] Israel picked up their tambourines and
[21:40] they danced with her Moses never stopped
[21:42] the dancing party Moses sang in the
[21:45] spirit while they danced in the spirit
[21:47] and played their tambourines I think
[21:50] sometimes we need a tambourine service
[21:52] we need a dancing service we need a holy
[21:55] ghost remembering service that our sins
[21:57] are are dead and they're hid in the
[22:00] blood and they can never come back upon
[22:03] us again I tell you when Moses said it
[22:06] these Egyptians you see today you'll see
[22:08] no more forever I'm talking about a God
[22:11] that can destroy your
[22:14] Egyptians well if our God can destroy
[22:17] our Egyptians why can't we dance about
[22:19] it and tell the devil I got the victory
[22:23] in the name of Jesus Christ I am a
[22:25] Victorious child
[22:29] Hallelujah I'm not a beaten down drummed
[22:32] out man amen I'm a man that knows the
[22:35] God that I
[22:38] serve well glory be to
[22:44] God they was buried in the blood and
[22:47] Redemption turned to
[22:49] justification cuz it didn't exist
[22:54] anymore now the Bible tells us that we
[22:58] have all sinned and come short of the
[23:00] glory of God so we're all on the same
[23:04] place
[23:06] tonight you know thing I like about the
[23:08] cross it's level
[23:11] ground the Low Places are made High and
[23:14] the high places are made low amen and
[23:16] the and the curves are made straight
[23:19] that's the cross brings every man to the
[23:21] same place good brother sure now you can
[23:26] teach the word and that's a good part of
[23:27] the that's a good part but ever preach
[23:29] on character a little while you going to
[23:31] have to get your altar
[23:33] out cuz when we quit comparing one with
[23:35] the other and compare ourselves with the
[23:37] stature of the perfect man we'll all
[23:39] find out we need
[23:41] Jesus we'll all find out we need
[23:45] Jesus is that right amen so it's level
[23:49] ground at the cross we have all sinned
[23:51] and come short of the glory of God being
[23:53] justified freely by his grace through
[23:55] Redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom
[23:58] God has set forth to be a propitiation
[24:01] through faith in his blood to declare
[24:03] righteousness for the remission of sins
[24:05] that are pass through the forbearance of
[24:08] God listen to that he to declare
[24:10] righteousness now I don't have time to
[24:11] preach all night but amen there's
[24:13] something powerful about declared
[24:15] righteousness
[24:17] folks Isaiah said our righteousness is
[24:20] as filthy rra and the Bible said that
[24:23] Israel was binded unto the righteousness
[24:26] of God but the elect have obtained it we
[24:29] have obtained righteousness not by our
[24:31] own abilities not of good things that
[24:33] we've done the Bible said not he that
[24:35] willth though he that run but is God
[24:37] that show the mercy to our lives then
[24:40] somebody declared us righteous it wasn't
[24:43] us saying we're righteous it's not our
[24:45] abilities there has been a declaration
[24:48] over your life that the blood of Jesus
[24:51] made you righteous before almighty God
[24:54] woo think about it tonight if you're not
[24:56] enjoying the the victory of the blood
[24:59] then you are living beneath the
[25:00] Privileges of your of your inheritance
[25:03] that God has made for you as a
[25:06] Believer our justification in Romans 5
[25:10] said therefore being justified by faith
[25:11] we have peace with God through our Lord
[25:15] Jesus Christ I love that don't you
[25:18] amen invisible Union brother B declares
[25:21] there's a difference forgiven and
[25:24] Justified it don't mean forgiven you you
[25:27] know the story if IID got out and done
[25:30] some evil thing and you come around you
[25:32] found
[25:33] out I didn't do them and you come around
[25:35] said brother R I forgive you forgive me
[25:38] I didn't do it at the first place amen
[25:40] now if I did it I'm guilty and you could
[25:43] forgive me and I wouldn't be guilty but
[25:46] yet I'm not justified because I actually
[25:48] done it but the word Justified is though
[25:49] you've never done it you ever you ever
[25:52] took it out just if
[25:56] I'd you said it all together justify it
[25:58] but slow it down just if I'd never done
[26:02] it in the first
[26:04] place see it's not forgetfulness see
[26:08] it's it's in the book of God's how's now
[26:10] watch how's it
[26:11] done it's in the book of the sea of
[26:14] forgetfulness see see now your old book
[26:17] of marriage and divorce is dead it's not
[26:19] even in the memories of God you're
[26:21] Justified amen therefore being justified
[26:25] it was accused you was accused but
[26:29] you've never done it in the first place
[26:33] right now we'd have to have a week to
[26:35] teach on that first
[26:37] place remember the glory which I had
[26:39] before the world began the Eternal
[26:41] thought substance the first place that
[26:44] that wasn't done in the first place see
[26:46] then you was accused but you never done
[26:48] it in the first place so the old Union
[26:51] is in the sea of God's forgetfulness you
[26:53] wasn't married to begin with the
[26:55] bridegroom bore your shame himself for
[26:57] in your place he took your place for you
[26:59] were predestinated him to be the bride
[27:01] before the foundation of the world you
[27:03] are the predestinated seed amen now now
[27:08] it's amazing because brother bam is
[27:11] going to take this and it's amazing how
[27:13] he lays out being put in the sea of
[27:15] forgetfulness I actually uh I actually
[27:17] was reading a book with uh with Eevee
[27:19] this morning and and and it it is struck
[27:22] me kind of was funny maybe it's late
[27:23] last night but it couldn't have been
[27:25] late I was B about 9:30 so amen but I I
[27:28] was reading to
[27:29] her it's happening amen but uh but I I
[27:35] was reading a book to her and and as I
[27:37] was reading it there it was a little
[27:38] bunny it's pretty funny it's a little
[27:40] bunny and it was talking to its mom and
[27:41] it was talking about how much he loved
[27:42] me and when the bunny said I love you
[27:45] this much and stretched out both hands
[27:47] well being a preacher I mean the minute
[27:49] I read that I got to thinking about the
[27:50] cross and how much he he loved me this
[27:52] much you know I'm reading about a bunny
[27:54] and I'm thinking about Calvary he Le
[27:56] loves you this much
[27:58] and when I thought about that I thought
[27:59] in that moment I thought yeah now I know
[28:01] how that old fell felt and brother BR
[28:04] said you know remember the girl had her
[28:06] Grandpa or her dad and said he was a
[28:08] little bit of a Pentecostal get get
[28:10] excited and things and she was a little
[28:11] more on the social side and she got
[28:13] embarrassed about him said when she had
[28:15] everybody over she just locked him in
[28:17] the attic and took his Bible away from
[28:19] him cuz he amen she gave him an old
[28:21] science book or a geography book or
[28:24] something so you know give him something
[28:25] to do but don't need him shouting he got
[28:28] up there and this the story said brother
[28:30] B said it like this said they was
[28:31] drinking their tea and things down there
[28:33] and said they got to hearing an awful
[28:34] commotion and the dust falling out of
[28:36] the ceiling hear somebody up there
[28:38] hauling and dancing and jumping and
[28:40] shouting after a while she pulled the
[28:42] cord and looked up there and said dad
[28:43] what are you doing up there he said well
[28:45] he said I'm awfully excited she said
[28:47] well you all you got a geography book
[28:49] what you excited about said well I was
[28:50] reading here about the oceans of the
[28:52] world yeah and I was reading some of
[28:55] them are so deep they never found the
[28:57] bottom
[28:58] am and she said what difference does
[29:00] that make he said but the scripture says
[29:03] that God cast our sins in the depths of
[29:05] the sea and he said I got to thinking
[29:08] that our sins are still going and
[29:10] there's not a bottom so nobody will ever
[29:12] find it he said I got to think about got
[29:14] are carried away well I tell you if that
[29:16] really ever strikes a heart of a
[29:18] Believer to really know that if you ever
[29:21] confess a sin before God and it goes in
[29:24] the sea of forgetfulness and it's still
[29:26] going tonight there's no bottom to it
[29:28] you'll never find
[29:30] it
[29:32] Hallelujah it'll even read an old
[29:34] geography book you'll get
[29:37] excited because it's it's a time do you
[29:40] see it's a time to understand the depths
[29:43] of the
[29:44] Blood Brother BR said a Christian Life
[29:47] absolutely centered in lives sometimes
[29:49] holds many
[29:51] disappointments he said disappointments
[29:53] see they hold many disappointments seem
[29:55] like it would be that way but it's God's
[29:57] way of doing things but let us hit the
[29:58] river to see what we'll do now see
[30:01] there's the thing sometimes we come up
[30:03] to situations sometimes there's battles
[30:06] that there's sometimes the battles that
[30:08] come upon
[30:09] people now I'm I'm going to going to say
[30:12] that I I believe I got to come back to
[30:14] this but I I I've got to say that what I
[30:17] believe is I believe the church is
[30:19] Justified and I believe the blood
[30:21] cleanses the
[30:23] church remember the blood of Jesus
[30:26] Christ takes sin so far from you until
[30:29] it's not even in the remembrance of God
[30:32] at
[30:33] all Lord now sin the blood stands
[30:36] between God and me I've accepted it I'm
[30:38] a sinner but he's God and the chemistry
[30:41] stands between me the kill of sin so God
[30:45] sees me as white as the water that's in
[30:48] the bleach sin is gone and it can't
[30:52] reach him because there's a sacrifice
[30:55] laying there right
[30:58] I tell you some of these some of these
[30:59] quotes are very powerful We Stand
[31:02] justified in the presence of God as a
[31:03] drop of ink a tub of bleach you'll never
[31:06] find the stain of Ink No More see it
[31:08] never come back again when a man is
[31:10] truly redeemed Redemption through the
[31:13] blood when a man is truly redeemed that
[31:16] predestinated seed sees it and accepts
[31:18] it his sins are
[31:21] demolished amen it's gone it's dropped
[31:25] into the ink Hallelujah do you see what
[31:27] it is amen when God allows that to drop
[31:31] in there so so you know it would seem
[31:33] like to me that if a person was Redeemed
[31:36] by the blood that'd be the end of it but
[31:38] Paul says there is a forgiveness of
[31:41] sins isn't that powerful there is a
[31:44] forgiveness of sins and brother man says
[31:46] that is not to The Sinner he said he
[31:49] can't sin he's a
[31:51] sinner his whole life is sin he said
[31:54] it's like you take a a book and he said
[31:56] the whole book is black he said put a
[31:58] black spot on it you can't find the spot
[32:00] the whole thing's black amen but if you
[32:02] could change the cover from black to
[32:04] white and then put a spot on it you
[32:06] could see it and so is it with the
[32:08] Church of the Living God if you put them
[32:10] in the bleach of the blood they're wide
[32:12] all together but then let them do a
[32:15] little something that's not
[32:18] right little something maybe they
[32:21] thought wrong said wrong acted
[32:23] wrong now then there has got to be
[32:28] something to deal with that than you
[32:30] Lord Jesus God is so interested in his
[32:33] children he would not just leave you in
[32:36] that estate Lord God wouldn't just leave
[32:39] a person let's you got a little
[32:41] something that happened or something
[32:42] that come up in your life and you're
[32:44] sitting there wondering God what am I to
[32:46] do about this God is so interested in
[32:49] you Hallelujah that he would never leave
[32:52] you in that place but he would provide a
[32:54] way to put you back with the blood as
[32:56] purpose in your
[32:58] heart now now I can can I can I can I
[33:02] remind you the book of Ephesians
[33:04] parallels the Book of Joshua yes sir
[33:06] amen so the Old Testament Joshua is the
[33:08] book of Ephesians of the New Testament
[33:10] and Paul is walking us through our
[33:12] predestination and brother bam says
[33:14] watch now those mothers had already
[33:17] spoke their names in Genesis 30 hundreds
[33:20] of years later they're coming into their
[33:22] land so everything they needed to
[33:24] possess the lamb was already there and
[33:26] you would think nothing could get in the
[33:28] way of people like this but now they
[33:31] went to the Battle of Jericho is a
[33:33] powerful battle remember it and in the
[33:35] Battle of Jericho God says to them
[33:38] listen you destroy everything in this
[33:42] city and it's an accurs C now this is
[33:45] amazing because in the Scripture it
[33:47] tells us that there are many battles
[33:51] that the children of Israel took the
[33:52] spoil of the battle and divided it among
[33:55] themselves which was it was a common
[33:57] occurrence to take the to take the
[33:59] Bounty of of a battle and divide it
[34:02] among themselves but in this battle he
[34:04] said everything in that City's cursed
[34:06] don't touch none of it remember only
[34:10] leave Rahab
[34:12] alive because of a promise everything
[34:14] else is a curse and then he turned
[34:16] around and said and don't build this
[34:18] city again and anybody that does is
[34:20] cursed yeah and if you read the
[34:22] Scripture it actually comes later
[34:23] remember that the Kings of Israel
[34:25] rebuild the city and there's a first
[34:27] laying on every king after that the
[34:29] whole line of Ahab but you got you got
[34:32] to see that God Amen brought them in a
[34:34] great battle and they were so victorious
[34:37] in their battle the shout amen of the
[34:39] king that came because of the seven
[34:41] trumpets sounding together and the walls
[34:43] of Jericho fell and they left and they
[34:45] left with such rry and such Victory amen
[34:49] knowing they were in position knowing
[34:51] they were to possess this but they start
[34:52] going up and then here they come to the
[34:54] next battle you won that great battle
[34:56] everything's going good and they come up
[34:58] to the next battle and it was called the
[35:00] Battle of a how many you ever read about
[35:01] it it's just AI I guess we uh amen it's
[35:04] the Battle of a but when they got ready
[35:06] to come to that battle they actually
[35:08] went back and said I such a small number
[35:10] don't bring the whole Army and it's no
[35:12] sweat man we'll have this done before
[35:14] noon you know and they take a battle
[35:16] they go up to defeat here in this land
[35:18] and the Bible says I think there was 36
[35:21] men died in the Battle and the Bible
[35:23] said that the children of Israel ran
[35:26] from the
[35:27] battle they turned their back and ran
[35:30] from the battle they lost their Courage
[35:32] the Bible said they had like it was
[35:35] water they ran like water Amen in other
[35:38] words they lost all their courage in the
[35:40] face of the enemy now why did that
[35:42] happen y'all remember brother M is
[35:44] paralleling now the New Testament Church
[35:46] with the Book of Joshua and he comes up
[35:48] and he said there it is it was in the
[35:50] walk he said because God had commanded
[35:52] them to go a certain way he said now
[35:54] they had begin to lose battles he said
[35:57] and they couldn't face their enemy so
[35:59] they had to ask themselves why can we
[36:01] not face this enemy he said so they
[36:03] started fasting and praying in a little
[36:05] while they come around and God begin to
[36:08] reveal Ain remember it and when achen
[36:10] was revealed it was them that he went
[36:12] down Amen to the scripture he went down
[36:15] to ain's house and the Bible said he
[36:17] began to talk to him he said hey look
[36:19] confess it
[36:20] man just confess it now what did he want
[36:24] to do he wanted to confess the sin now
[36:26] watch this why does he use this
[36:29] confession why did Joshua the type of
[36:32] the Holy Ghost ask that confession out
[36:35] of
[36:36] aen because what was going on in ain's
[36:39] life was stopping the
[36:41] victory of the rest of the camp of
[36:44] Israel so God needed to deal with this
[36:48] sin now if you want to take the name aen
[36:50] the a Ain actually means trouble yeah
[36:53] amen isn't that amazing you can't make
[36:55] that up amen the guy's name meant
[36:58] trouble I I I can't help to think about
[37:01] it who who seen a nice little baby boy
[37:03] born and said let's name him
[37:06] trouble but he was living up to his name
[37:10] because he decided to take something
[37:12] that was a curse and the Bible said they
[37:14] found it in his tent a wedge of
[37:17] Babylonian gold and silver was buried
[37:19] beneath it and brother brand immediately
[37:20] takes it to worldism in the church he
[37:23] said the sisters cutting on their hair
[37:24] and he said wearing makeup and things
[37:26] like that he said here we are the Church
[37:29] of God the camp of Israel he said should
[37:31] never be named Among Us y'all read it
[37:34] y'all you've heard the brother bam uh in
[37:36] the message of he cares do you care he
[37:39] goes deep into this area and when he
[37:41] does he shows that when God found the
[37:44] problem in Israel the trouble in Israel
[37:47] was aching come on now we can look at it
[37:50] as a church tonight we could say well
[37:52] amen my own life then matters to others
[37:55] what I do come on church amen if we're
[37:58] going to face sicknesses boldly if we're
[38:01] going to face troubles boldly then we've
[38:03] got to come together as a body amen but
[38:06] God is so interested in the body that he
[38:09] wouldn't allow something to remain Among
[38:11] Us without saying to us bring it to the
[38:14] blood bring it to the blood bring it to
[38:17] the blood and look what he's going to do
[38:18] now God he names out this trouble aen
[38:21] and then they do something with him they
[38:25] take him over to this Valley now look
[38:28] what they do the scripture said they
[38:30] take him and his cattle his family
[38:31] everything it sounds sounds pretty
[38:34] sounds pretty amazing it sounds terrible
[38:36] but but you got to see the type yes sir
[38:39] that they took that and put it in the
[38:41] valley the Bible said they stoned them
[38:43] and burned them with
[38:44] fire and when it was burned with fire it
[38:47] was completely gone they covered it up
[38:49] with rocks as a memorial and then they
[38:53] returned to the battle now look after
[38:56] this after they return to the battle
[38:58] they go back to the same battle they had
[39:00] just lost and now they completely
[39:03] overcame it now what's that telling the
[39:05] Church of the Living God that God was
[39:07] interested in your victory of a and the
[39:10] thing that troubled you he showed you
[39:12] confess sin dropped into the blood will
[39:15] restore the victory back in the Church
[39:17] of the Living God listen I'm not just
[39:19] talking to us as a body but what about
[39:22] as an individual when you were so
[39:24] Victorious and so powerful and your joy
[39:27] was so great but what troubles you
[39:29] tonight listen think of this what
[39:31] troubles you what is it that's took your
[39:33] boldness away from you what took your
[39:36] stand away from you when you could stand
[39:38] in the face of every adversity and know
[39:40] your soul was right with God you didn't
[39:42] have to back up you didn't have to worry
[39:44] you could shout in any service you could
[39:47] Amen to any sermon because victory was
[39:49] in your life Joy was in your life but
[39:52] some devil come and stole it away and
[39:55] God is saying you don't don't have to
[39:56] stay there you don't have to remain
[40:00] there the trouble in Israel and the
[40:02] trouble in our own personal
[40:06] walks confess sin drops into the blood
[40:10] you remember our story on Redemption I
[40:12] think it's a powerful story on
[40:14] Redemption one of the great stories of
[40:16] redemption was Hosea taking Gomer as a
[40:19] wife just preached on his Sunday a bit
[40:21] and if you like to if you're a Bible
[40:23] reader it was a prophet he's married a
[40:26] Harlot and she's going back into hardam
[40:28] whoredom and and when she moves back
[40:31] into that do you think that man just
[40:33] left that do you think he just said hey
[40:37] you can go back you can stay we'll just
[40:39] not deal with it you you you can just
[40:40] stay where you are no amen that was his
[40:44] wife so he wanted to restore her back to
[40:47] that place if you read Hosea the 2
[40:49] chapter it's a beautiful read but the
[40:51] first half of it is total
[40:53] judgment Hosea the 2 chapter the first
[40:56] first half is just judgment stacked up
[40:58] on judgment but then about the 14th
[41:00] verse there's a complete change and he
[41:03] says but therefore he says I will Allure
[41:07] You Into the Wilderness now you you if
[41:10] you have time you can go through it in
[41:12] the message some of you preachers will
[41:13] really enjoy the study but the
[41:15] allurement is the attraction right God
[41:17] attracted Moses god attracting a bride
[41:20] God attracting the eagle amen look she
[41:22] was in the place of sin but God
[41:24] attracted her and and Hosea attracted
[41:27] her and look at what he said he said I
[41:30] will give you the valley of acre for a
[41:33] Door of Hope the first time I ever read
[41:36] that what a valley of
[41:38] acor you might be asking that right now
[41:41] what's the valley of acor well if you
[41:43] back up and read it that's the valley
[41:45] they put Ain in the valley of acor was
[41:49] the place they buried achen and his
[41:51] family and now hundreds of years later a
[41:55] prophet is using this as a hope unto a
[41:58] woman that's so far out she can never
[42:00] come back but God said right there in
[42:03] that Valley I'm showing you that I can
[42:06] take you from a defeat back to a victory
[42:09] again I can move you from utter failure
[42:12] back to Victory again I'll tell you what
[42:14] you you know what you know it's amazing
[42:16] you can't make this stuff up the valley
[42:18] of acor is titled the valley of
[42:22] trouble the valley of trouble that's
[42:25] where God put put Israel's trouble
[42:28] that's where Hosea could put goomer's
[42:31] trouble there's another Valley amen of
[42:33] trouble it's the blood of Jesus Christ
[42:36] wherever sin could be dropped and God
[42:39] can take you from defeat back to Victory
[42:42] again he can bring you from a lower
[42:44] state of trouble and trial and put you
[42:47] back in Victory again oh I'm talking
[42:49] about the blood the blood that is able
[42:51] tonight to change the situations of your
[42:55] heart and of your soul you say brother
[42:57] Wayne I'm troubled I say there's a
[42:59] valley to put your trouble
[43:01] in I'm troubled tonight brother Wayne
[43:04] I'm troubled by this problem I'm
[43:05] troubled by this situation there is a
[43:08] valley of acre as a door of hope there
[43:10] is hope for every man that is still
[43:13] breathing there is hope that there's a
[43:15] valley to put it
[43:17] in
[43:19] brother
[43:21] valleys valleys of hope you say brother
[43:25] Wayne what are you saying
[43:26] say that when sin is confessed it drops
[43:30] into the
[43:32] blood where does confess sin go into the
[43:36] blood confess sin has been dipped into
[43:40] the blood a man or woman that's been
[43:42] dipped in the blood of Jesus Christ it
[43:44] kills every
[43:46] symptom Hallelujah let me just say it
[43:49] like this it don't just take the sin it
[43:51] takes the guilt with
[43:54] it let me tell tell you long after the
[43:56] sin's gone the guilt's laying there and
[43:58] that's what's keeping you from enjoying
[44:00] your
[44:01] services that's what's keeping you from
[44:03] Clapping Your Hands and lifting your
[44:05] voice and amen that's what's took the
[44:07] Hallelujah out of your life is the guilt
[44:09] of it the the remembrance of it the
[44:11] trouble of it well I say tonight put the
[44:14] guilt in the same blood that you put the
[44:16] sin in put the memory in the same blood
[44:19] you put your sins in we've got a right
[44:21] as a bride to stand on the promise of
[44:24] the blood amen you said brother how much
[44:26] release can I have how much faith can
[44:29] you have in the
[44:30] blood your faith in the blood is the
[44:33] power of God in your life as much as you
[44:36] can believe in the blood is as much
[44:38] power as you can have
[44:41] tonight we stay unjustified in Christ
[44:44] now what are we talking about we're
[44:45] talking about sins after that you're a
[44:51] Believer the power of the blood is just
[44:53] as powerful after the cross as it is
[44:56] before the cross 4,000 years of mankind
[44:59] and their sin was abolished by the cross
[45:02] but 2,000 years later we are still
[45:05] feeling the effects of the Cross why is
[45:08] it when a Christian becomes a Christian
[45:10] he thinks the cross is only good for the
[45:12] sins he did before he's a sinner when
[45:15] before he was a Christian before I was a
[45:17] Christian this happened and this
[45:18] happened and this happened and the blood
[45:20] took it all away but what about after
[45:22] you're a Christian what about after
[45:24] you're a believer isn't there any
[45:26] forgiveness for a Believer isn't there
[45:29] any hope for a man or a woman or a child
[45:33] I say there's hope I say there's the
[45:35] blood I say there's a release of sin and
[45:38] a release of guilt I say God can change
[45:40] the circumstances of Our
[45:44] Lives I want our young people to know
[45:47] there's a place to confess your sins
[45:49] there's a place to start
[45:54] over let me tell you the devil's a
[45:56] Trapper not only is he a Trapper he
[45:58] don't want to just trap you he wants to
[45:59] keep
[46:01] you I used to trap animals I know what
[46:04] it's about you learn the nature you trap
[46:06] them but if you don't trap them right
[46:08] they're gone before
[46:11] morning but God God knows that devil
[46:14] didn't just want to trap you he want to
[46:16] keep
[46:18] you 30 years later Sister Marge you'll
[46:20] still have mind battles about it yes sir
[46:24] isn't that amazing
[46:26] that something can haunt a person for
[46:28] years and years and
[46:32] years and we might as well go ahead and
[46:34] punch that devil right in the
[46:37] face sometimes it things you're not even
[46:39] guilty of yourself you didn't even do it
[46:42] but had it done to you and that Devil's
[46:44] pledged your mind he's tried to take
[46:46] away your innocence and say you did some
[46:49] filthy thing when it was nothing but the
[46:51] devil trying to destroy your life and
[46:54] what God gave you well I rebuke that
[46:56] condemning devil tonight he's a liar to
[46:59] begin
[47:00] [Applause]
[47:02] with it's a
[47:06] truth it's a truth amen I don't often
[47:09] read it but I'll tell you what right now
[47:11] I can tell you where it's coming from
[47:13] it's a
[47:16] lie the body of Christ standing redeemed
[47:19] justified in his sight why are we
[47:21] Justified we are his victory the church
[47:24] is his victory we come forth in the last
[47:27] days with this glorious gospel showing
[47:29] the victory he died for this
[47:33] purpose sir he didn't die to make you a
[47:36] church
[47:37] member he didn't die so you could attend
[47:40] church he died to give you
[47:46] Victory and when we see him coming down
[47:49] and living among
[47:52] us oh God I want you to watch the
[47:56] interest of God he comes himself that's
[47:59] why the son of man was coming in the end
[48:01] time that's right the word was
[48:03] descending that's going to get real
[48:05] important in a moment yes sir but the
[48:07] word is a
[48:09] discerner of the thought and the intent
[48:11] of the
[48:12] heart isn't that amazing that the
[48:16] discerner himself was coming Among Us in
[48:18] the end time
[48:20] amen showing the difference between fig
[48:24] leaf and the
[48:27] blood you
[48:29] see justified in his sight we are his
[48:33] victory we come forth in the last day
[48:35] with this Glory showing the victory he
[48:37] died for this purpose and we prove his
[48:39] victory we see him coming down and
[48:42] living among the church that's his
[48:45] victory shows they couldn't keep him in
[48:48] the ground and neither can they keep
[48:50] us in the breach brother bam says it he
[48:53] says what we have lost is being restored
[48:56] in paragraph 102 he said if the blood
[48:59] has cleansed us back what about now look
[49:01] what the Son of God the second Adam said
[49:04] the works that I do shall you do also
[49:06] now what's he's doing he's proving the
[49:08] cleansing pattern
[49:10] now now let me just let me just take
[49:13] just a moment uh brother brother Ron
[49:16] said a little something to me here while
[49:17] back reminded me this morning as listen
[49:19] Tate brother brand brought up Charles
[49:20] finny brother Ron said brother Wayne
[49:22] said he said you're a little bit like
[49:24] that guy Charles Finley finny finny is
[49:27] his name and I said what do you mean
[49:28] brother Ron he said well he said because
[49:30] your cases are built by the law by the
[49:34] word and and when I was studying this I
[49:36] thought you know what but that's the
[49:38] only thing that the devil
[49:40] recognizes y'all remember brother Braham
[49:43] said his first first sermon he preached
[49:44] you remember that he said I had
[49:46] everybody and he said they were crying
[49:48] and they were shouting and he said I
[49:49] walked in the back room and he said he
[49:51] said I seen my pastor and I said what'
[49:53] you think about that sermon he said I
[49:54] was real proud of it' he said the old
[49:56] brother looked at me he says worst thing
[49:57] I ever
[49:59] heard he said man that hit me where Hur
[50:02] he saidh was it so bad he said well he
[50:04] said you put on all the works he said
[50:06] but you didn't put no word out and he
[50:08] said if you're going to win a case
[50:09] you're going to have to have the law
[50:11] behind
[50:12] it and when the scriptures have been
[50:14] given here the Bible said we have been
[50:17] redeemed by the Precious Blood of the
[50:19] Lamb that we were for ordained before
[50:21] the foundation of the world in
[50:23] Revelations 13 the Bible said that the
[50:26] lamb was slain from the foundation of
[50:28] the world telling us then that no sin
[50:31] committed in the world could outdo the
[50:34] blood that was slain before the
[50:36] world the debt was paid from before the
[50:40] world telling us nothing in time could
[50:43] overcome the blood that was before
[50:46] time amen all the
[50:49] blood the Redemption of it see now in
[50:53] Psalms 103 David Avid will say this
[50:56] let's build it just for a moment Psalms
[50:57] 103 David said bless the Lord all my
[51:00] soul and all that was Within Me bless
[51:02] His holy name bless the Lord oh my soul
[51:05] and forget not
[51:07] all the benefits yes sir you're talking
[51:10] about a benefit of being a Christian yes
[51:13] sir the benefit of being a Christian
[51:15] listen to this next one who forgiveth
[51:17] all thine iniquity who Health all thy
[51:20] disease can somebody say all for me all
[51:24] thine iniquity I said well well the way
[51:26] I'll tell you what that don't count me
[51:27] well wait a minute
[51:29] now brother Adam says iniquity means to
[51:32] do something you knew not to do amen he
[51:36] said or to do something you knew to do
[51:39] right well that got
[51:41] everybody he brother B so spelled it out
[51:45] to everybody was involved in this
[51:47] scripture yeah who forgiveth all that
[51:49] iniquity who Health all thy diseases
[51:52] look at the blessing that David was
[51:53] sharing with the church blessed is a man
[51:56] from Psalms 32 And1 blessed is he whose
[51:59] transgressions are forgiven whose sin is
[52:02] covered amen blessed is the man whom the
[52:06] Lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose
[52:10] Spirit there is no God now y'all just
[52:12] for a short uh short bible study I'm not
[52:15] going to I don't have time to go into it
[52:17] let's just plainly say it the word
[52:19] impute means count yeah
[52:22] amen count in other words right there's
[52:25] a difference in iniquity counted and
[52:28] iniquity not
[52:30] counted now now I I can I can take all
[52:33] night with the scripture but I I hope
[52:35] you just hear what I'm saying to you you
[52:37] say so and so did something but there's
[52:39] a difference to what's accounted and
[52:41] what's not
[52:42] accounted Hallelujah now just in two
[52:45] minutes I'll show you it in the
[52:46] scripture Apostle Peter lost his
[52:50] boldness remember he cut off the ear he
[52:52] cut off the ear of a Pharisee coming to
[52:54] get Jesus Romans cut his ear off brother
[52:57] said there it is he could doal with the
[52:58] Creeds he could take his Theology and
[53:00] cut them up he said but when it come
[53:02] down to the Cross he stood there and
[53:04] denied Jesus Christ showing he had no
[53:06] Christian Courage at all yeah denied him
[53:10] three times in the presence of the
[53:12] enemies and followed a far off but on
[53:14] the day of
[53:16] Pentecost he received the baptism of the
[53:19] Holy Ghost and brother bandam said the
[53:21] Holy Ghost is an abstract title deed to
[53:24] your property
[53:25] now how many knows what that means a
[53:27] title deed says you own it and Abstract
[53:30] says there's no leans against it so in
[53:33] other words if God had counted it
[53:36] against Peter amen the Holy Ghost would
[53:38] have never come on him we see that with
[53:40] Judas his scariot he sold out the Lord
[53:43] and the Bible said he tried to repent
[53:45] but there was no place for him and he
[53:48] went and hung himself amen showing us
[53:51] there were four crosses right amen
[53:54] that's right the Son of God come for the
[53:56] thief on the right and Judas the son of
[53:58] predition come for the thief on the left
[54:00] that's right and it never was counted
[54:02] against Peter and it never was counted
[54:05] against Paul and any man with a baptism
[54:07] of the Holy Ghost there's a difference
[54:09] in iniquity that's counted and iniquity
[54:11] that's not
[54:13] counted there is an abstract title deed
[54:16] upon every believer here
[54:19] tonight thank you Jesus I saw him do it
[54:22] but God didn't see
[54:24] it
[54:25] goodness the power of the
[54:28] blood I tell you what you can do you can
[54:31] clean up the
[54:32] viist you can change the viist from a
[54:36] sinner to a saint though thy sins be as
[54:39] Crimson they shall be white as
[54:42] snow Paul brings it up to the New
[54:44] Testament I thought it was always
[54:45] amazing Paul who was killing Christians
[54:47] when God found him says in Romans 4:6
[54:50] even David described the blessedness of
[54:51] a man whom God imputeth righteousness
[54:53] without works saying blessed are those
[54:56] whose iniquities are forgiven and whose
[54:58] sins are covered blessed is the man whom
[55:01] the Lord will not impute sin here Paul
[55:03] is a
[55:06] recipient as a seed of David who had
[55:09] killed Christians who had committed the
[55:11] violent sins a man could commit you say
[55:14] well he just did that to so and so he
[55:15] just did that to so and so Jesus said
[55:17] different when he met the pillar of fire
[55:19] he said I am him whom thou persecutest
[55:23] he persecuted the Lord but when the
[55:25] blood came into his path he had a
[55:27] forgiveness of sins upon his life and he
[55:31] oh how he must have felt when he wrote
[55:33] that blessed is a man whom the Lord
[55:35] would not impute sins
[55:38] Hallelujah you imagine when that
[55:40] inspiration struck him I bet the candle
[55:43] burned a little brighter that
[55:46] night amen now that's just a that's just
[55:48] a little background to the thought
[55:51] see she was redeemed of the blood and
[55:54] can never come condemnation here's what
[55:56] brother R is teaching us she can never
[55:57] be in judgment because sin cannot be
[56:00] imputed to her sin cannot be imputed to
[56:03] her God put our names on the Lamb's Book
[56:06] of Life and when he come to the altar
[56:08] before the foundation of the world
[56:09] that's the Bible it was slang before the
[56:12] foundation of the world preaching
[56:14] predestination will force you to preach
[56:16] a atonement in a way the world doesn't
[56:19] understand it in 1 John Chapter 2 and
[56:21] verse one my little children these
[56:23] things write I unto you
[56:25] that you sin not but if any man sin we
[56:29] have an advocate with the father Jesus
[56:31] Christ the righteous he is the
[56:33] propitiation of our sins and not ours
[56:35] only but the sins of the whole world
[56:37] Amen now they used to teach it in the
[56:39] Pentecostal church if you got a problem
[56:41] go have a talk with Jesus I remember as
[56:43] a kid hearing them talk about it just a
[56:45] little talk with Jesus makes everything
[56:46] right they're writing that from an
[56:48] advocate we got a friend who we can talk
[56:50] to brother brandom comes along and says
[56:52] that's not what that means at all he
[56:55] said that ain't what that means at all
[56:57] he said what that means is the Holy
[56:59] Ghost is an advocate to the believer it
[57:01] means he's a lawyer that stands between
[57:04] you and a righteous judge in other words
[57:07] anybody ever had to go to court yeah
[57:09] maybe I should just ask General here but
[57:12] anybody ever had to go to court I had I
[57:13] think I went once and stood before a
[57:15] judge it was scary and it was over a
[57:18] license plate or something I can't
[57:19] imagine having the blood of somebody on
[57:21] my hands or some real crime I had to
[57:22] look at him for can you imagine that
[57:25] you're guilty now you're just before the
[57:26] judge but I but I have probably needed
[57:29] to go a couple times and I called a
[57:31] lawyer and I never had to show
[57:33] up because you can actually hire someone
[57:37] to stand between you and the judge and
[57:39] he acts as though you were standing
[57:42] there but he speaks for you now this is
[57:44] called a lawyer or an advocate and the
[57:46] Bible is telling us that we have an
[57:49] advocate with the father so there is
[57:51] something between you and God but it's
[57:53] not sin it's say it's God in his Justice
[57:57] by the power of the blood he is an
[57:59] advocate brother Bram says he stands in
[58:02] my
[58:03] place now when sins are confessed it's
[58:06] put in the blood of Christ and they'll
[58:08] never be known God forgets them there
[58:11] never ever was done as long as that
[58:13] sacrifice is laying there it's an
[58:15] atonement for us that's it we're not
[58:19] Sinners no more we're Christians by the
[58:20] grace of God remember in ourselves we'd
[58:23] probably be just as as bad as we ever
[58:25] were but the grace of God has appeared
[58:28] unto
[58:29] us the brother bam says it like this the
[58:31] ink becomes bleach and that's what
[58:34] happens you're confessed sin if you're
[58:36] in Christ between you and God is a whole
[58:39] tub of bleach now you Believers know
[58:42] what I'm talking about brother B says
[58:43] you take a drop of ink and put it in a
[58:46] tub of bleach brother Errol Gregory told
[58:48] me one time he said be careful he said a
[58:50] tub of bleach because he Brother Ray he
[58:54] actually brought a a a a clear glass of
[58:56] w of
[58:58] bleach and he set it on the platform
[59:00] dropped ink in it and the bleach turned
[59:04] black he said bad idea he said he said a
[59:07] tub of
[59:14] bleach yeah right should have tried that
[59:17] at home
[59:20] first
[59:21] ah Marvel thought huh but here's the
[59:26] reality is brother Bram is trying to
[59:28] make a point that the chemical power of
[59:31] bleach is more powerful than the ink
[59:34] right so if the ink is made up of
[59:37] several things when something breaks the
[59:39] power they go back to where they come
[59:41] from yes sir and that's what happens
[59:43] when concess sin is Dropped In The Blood
[59:45] it breaks apart sin and it sends it upon
[59:50] the head of the original sinner Amen
[59:54] brother B says is it like this God
[59:55] created Power created a blood cell
[59:57] without sexual desire in the womb of the
[1:00:00] Virgin and that don't only cover sin it
[1:00:03] omits it takes it so far that it'll
[1:00:06] never come in the mind of God it don't
[1:00:08] make a bridge across the chasm it moves
[1:00:11] the chasm that drop of ink into the
[1:00:13] bottle of the bleach whatever might be
[1:00:15] you never find that color again
[1:00:18] amen now watch this brother ramman God
[1:00:21] in
[1:00:22] Simplicity if I have a red spot on my
[1:00:24] hand and cover it wide and a red spot's
[1:00:26] still there it's still there but God
[1:00:27] sent down from heaven a bleach for
[1:00:31] sin now everybody in here that wears
[1:00:34] blue jeans or has dark clothes knows the
[1:00:36] power of bleach right we don't have to
[1:00:38] preach on the power of bleach you ever
[1:00:40] got it on a dark
[1:00:42] shirt nobody has to ask what happened to
[1:00:45] your
[1:00:46] shirt I hey I even found that it's in
[1:00:49] the pool uh cleaner stuff when you pour
[1:00:51] it in there if you just get the splatter
[1:00:53] of the water you you you'll have it on
[1:00:55] your pants you think what' I do and you
[1:00:56] oh I poured that bleach in the pool cuz
[1:00:59] it's so powerful just a speck of it
[1:01:01] leaves a leaves a spot where it has been
[1:01:04] and here brother bam is saying this
[1:01:06] bleach has come from the heavens and our
[1:01:09] confess sin now here it is our confessed
[1:01:13] sins drop into God's bleach try to find
[1:01:18] it again the coloring of sin goes back
[1:01:22] through the mediators and down through
[1:01:24] time until it hits the accuser Satan and
[1:01:27] lays on him to the day of judgment
[1:01:31] that's what happens to your sin yes sir
[1:01:33] you see brother Wayne if if I've done
[1:01:34] something wrong when I confess it what
[1:01:36] happens to
[1:01:37] it it goes back to the original
[1:01:41] sinner it's broke and goes back now
[1:01:44] listen to this it's being removed from
[1:01:46] you it's not like that you're just
[1:01:49] imagining that it's being gone but
[1:01:52] confess sin drops into the blood brother
[1:01:54] brand watch now he's splitting this
[1:01:56] paragraph 407 paragraph 410 he splits
[1:01:58] this into two parts and if you'd like to
[1:02:00] study this go look at this he tells you
[1:02:03] what happens to the sin it's dropped
[1:02:05] into the bleach it hits the accuser
[1:02:07] Satan lays on until the day of judgment
[1:02:09] but in paragraph 14 he says but what
[1:02:12] happens to the
[1:02:13] sun the sun and the sin are together the
[1:02:16] bleach breaks them apart the sin goes
[1:02:19] back on the devil but what happens to
[1:02:21] the sun he asked the question what
[1:02:23] happens to the Sun he becomes in perfect
[1:02:26] fellowship with the father again
[1:02:28] standing on the other side of the chasm
[1:02:31] with no remembrance of sin against him
[1:02:33] no more stain of the bleach can be seen
[1:02:35] anywhere he's free Hallelujah just as
[1:02:38] chloroxide took the ink it can never be
[1:02:41] in no more because it's broke again and
[1:02:43] when confessed sin it's been dropped
[1:02:45] into the blood a man or a woman that's
[1:02:48] ever Dept in the blood of Jesus kills
[1:02:50] the symptoms every molecule of sin goes
[1:02:52] back to the devil and lay onto him to
[1:02:55] the day of judgment Eternal destination
[1:02:57] to be throwed into the Lake of Fire now
[1:03:00] don't you stumble at
[1:03:02] Simplicity it's covered by the
[1:03:06] blood so brother Wayne I have things
[1:03:08] that trouble me tonight I got more but I
[1:03:10] think it's time brother can you come to
[1:03:12] the
[1:03:12] music I got things that trouble me
[1:03:15] tonight yes sir there is a valley yeah
[1:03:20] amen can I just say it there's a sea
[1:03:23] yeah amen yeah there's a
[1:03:27] fountain now here's the
[1:03:30] thing if it's trouble and I say to you
[1:03:33] now I'm in the scripture right if you're
[1:03:36] if you will confess your sin he is
[1:03:39] faithful and just yes Amen to forgive
[1:03:44] you amen now ask yourself what does that
[1:03:48] mean if if you're sitting here tonight
[1:03:51] and you said brother Wayne I've got
[1:03:52] troubles how do I get out of this
[1:03:54] all right there there is sin that
[1:03:58] requires
[1:03:59] more and that would be that you know a
[1:04:02] man cheated on his wife or the wife
[1:04:05] brother bam said that you haven't just
[1:04:06] sinned against God you sinned against
[1:04:08] your mate he said so you'd have to go to
[1:04:11] them
[1:04:12] right now we you need to make a
[1:04:14] difference so you can
[1:04:15] see okay let let's see that you've
[1:04:18] committed some sin against a person
[1:04:20] where you've stolen a large amount of
[1:04:21] money and you need to return it there
[1:04:23] needs to be restitution made then that
[1:04:26] person would you would you would need
[1:04:27] that person to involve that
[1:04:30] person if that's a personal
[1:04:33] problem the issues in your life and
[1:04:35] thought life
[1:04:37] and the confession you're talking about
[1:04:39] is not to a preacher or a pastor or a
[1:04:43] pope it's a confession to
[1:04:46] God and you wouldn't even have to leave
[1:04:48] your seat to do that tonight right amen
[1:04:52] and somebody say well brother Wayne I
[1:04:53] think there should be a lot A lot has to
[1:04:55] be done to get to the place you're want
[1:04:56] it to get now I want you to
[1:04:58] watch he has come down Among
[1:05:02] Us right and when they were behind fig
[1:05:06] leaves he said you're behind a fig Leaf
[1:05:08] but he could still see the problem
[1:05:11] remember y'all remember there was a guy
[1:05:13] coming the discernment line with brother
[1:05:14] brandham and he came in brother Bram
[1:05:16] said he's living with another man's wife
[1:05:19] uh but he
[1:05:21] wasn't it actually had to do with his
[1:05:24] religion there was another he wasn't
[1:05:27] wrong he was just seeing it as
[1:05:31] adultery but it was spiritual and
[1:05:33] brother Bram told him later that's what
[1:05:35] it was it was another
[1:05:37] man he comes through the prayer line
[1:05:40] I've heard brother Bram say it a million
[1:05:41] times he'll say not a million several
[1:05:44] times he comes he says he says the altar
[1:05:46] are to be full tonight nobody was moving
[1:05:49] he said now I could walk right down this
[1:05:51] roll he said and start telling the
[1:05:53] situations in
[1:05:55] lives see because they were hiding it
[1:05:57] behind the Fig
[1:05:59] Leaf but but uh there's one story
[1:06:03] brother Tim and I were talking about it
[1:06:05] some time ago and and the girl I believe
[1:06:07] the woman him herself was in brother
[1:06:09] Tim's church and she went through the
[1:06:11] prayer line there in Louisiana she was
[1:06:14] young Methodist when she was
[1:06:16] smoking and brother bandam was in the
[1:06:19] prayer line and he was praying and he
[1:06:21] told them as he always does he said now
[1:06:23] when you get in the prayer line he said
[1:06:25] if there's sin in your life it's going
[1:06:26] to expose it he said it'll just call it
[1:06:29] out and he said and then it it won't be
[1:06:32] me it'll just be the angel so he he was
[1:06:35] talking about smoking or something that
[1:06:37] night and that little girl was coming in
[1:06:39] prayer line and her mom was in the same
[1:06:41] line and as she was walking she said she
[1:06:44] got to thinking that she hadn't really
[1:06:46] thought about how bad smoking
[1:06:49] was but when the way brother Bram talked
[1:06:51] about it she knew that it was really
[1:06:52] wrong she should have never done it and
[1:06:54] she got to pray in and she said Lord
[1:06:57] forgive
[1:06:59] me when she got in front of brother
[1:07:03] brandham he never mentioned it one
[1:07:06] [Music]
[1:07:08] time some
[1:07:11] somewhere in a few
[1:07:15] steps she found a place to put
[1:07:19] it and God had a
[1:07:22] discerner yeah to prove back to this
[1:07:26] congregation that what he said in the
[1:07:28] scripture is true that confess sin
[1:07:31] dipped into the
[1:07:33] blood that it would put it in the sea
[1:07:35] where God couldn't even remember it
[1:07:37] somebody asked him I believe it's Perry
[1:07:38] green I heard this years ago they said
[1:07:41] why didn't you why didn't you uncover
[1:07:43] the certain situation brother Bram said
[1:07:45] well it's been confessed he said God
[1:07:47] can't see it neither could his
[1:07:50] profit amen many times you're going back
[1:07:52] to God saying God God forgive me God
[1:07:54] forgive me and he don't even know what
[1:07:55] you're talking
[1:07:58] [Music]
[1:08:02] about but see something trouble you and
[1:08:04] said brother Wayne when could a person
[1:08:06] be forgiven how could I get rid of that
[1:08:08] trouble in one place brother BR said the
[1:08:10] minute you said in your heart Lord
