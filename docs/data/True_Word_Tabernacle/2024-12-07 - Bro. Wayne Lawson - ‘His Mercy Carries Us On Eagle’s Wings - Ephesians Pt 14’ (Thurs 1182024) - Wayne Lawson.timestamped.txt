[5:31] and pray every day yes sir amen you'll
[5:33] be sure to get closer to the Lord by
[5:35] doing it amen and it's certainly a great
[5:38] honor to be here tonight on the Thursday
[5:40] evening and amen we um we know the roads
[5:43] are planning to get bad a little bit
[5:45] later tonight but we've had the grace to
[5:47] get together here and earlier and amen
[5:50] it's certainly on our heart and amen we
[5:52] um got a few things here that uh if it's
[5:56] okay with you we're just going to
[5:57] continue in this eisan series amen and
[6:00] uh I know I know there's more books in
[6:02] here than the book of
[6:05] Ephesians but this is exactly where the
[6:08] church is today is the book of Ephesians
[6:12] amen it's just a special anointing seems
[6:14] that has moved in on it and amen and uh
[6:18] it's been such a rich blessing and amen
[6:20] I my goodness did y'all appreciate that
[6:23] anointing on the end of the service
[6:24] there Sunday wasn't that so powerful
[6:27] Amen brother Ericson had everyone join
[6:29] him and praying people on the on the
[6:31] streaming out there said the power of
[6:33] God was just dropping in their homes and
[6:35] amen the anointing was happening and
[6:37] amen I thank the Lord amen I thank God
[6:39] he's not bound to this room amen but he
[6:42] can go out there in in the homes and in
[6:44] the lives and he can touch every need
[6:47] and every every heart amen it just feels
[6:49] really good in here tonight amen God
[6:52] bless you and amen it's a great honor
[6:54] amen and just before we read the word
[6:57] maybe we just address the author of it
[6:59] amen let's just speak to him this
[7:01] morning this evening father it is a
[7:04] great privilege to be with your children
[7:05] Lord and Lord we've had the honor to
[7:09] stand in your presence so many times and
[7:12] father your Prophet told us of a young
[7:15] man that wanted to see the
[7:17] ocean and there was an old salt setting
[7:20] there that had lived his whole life that
[7:21] couldn't see the big
[7:23] F but Lord that young heart that had
[7:26] never seen it was so real to him
[7:30] and I pray father that you always allow
[7:32] us no matter how many times we see you
[7:35] no matter how many times we're in your
[7:37] presence Lord help it to stay fresh to
[7:39] us help us to never Lord never to take
[7:43] for granted you're coming by and
[7:45] speaking to the needs and picking up
[7:47] your word and dealing with hearts for
[7:49] father we could open this book surely
[7:52] but there's no man that can open this
[7:54] Revelation but you and we ask that you
[7:57] would come tonight and pick your word up
[7:58] Lord and flip back the pages but Lord
[8:01] open up the corridors of our souls that
[8:03] we might see deep into your word father
[8:06] and we ask you for your mercy in the
[8:09] name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and
[8:13] amen and God bless you tonight and I
[8:16] want to turn to the book of Ephesians
[8:17] the second chapter and I want to look
[8:20] here in the fourth verse of the book of
[8:23] Ephesians uh 2 chapter verse 4 amen uh
[8:27] just I'm just going to read this one
[8:29] verse I've read this section on Sunday
[8:31] but I want to specifically speak of this
[8:33] one verse tonight but
[8:36] God who is rich in
[8:39] Mercy for his great
[8:42] love wherewith he hath loved us isn't
[8:46] that amazing God who is rich in Mercy
[8:49] sir he's rich in Mercy for his
[8:52] love so his love has manifested his
[8:56] mercy and he's giving Mercy to satisfy
[9:00] his love for us isn't that amazing
[9:03] because he has love his Mercy satisfies
[9:06] his love amen but God who is rich in
[9:08] mercy God bless you as you could be
[9:10] seated tonight I want to speak to you
[9:13] tonight if I can uh if I would take a
[9:15] context in this uh in this it's fision
[9:18] series but I'm going to take a specific
[9:20] title to this amen and he carries them
[9:24] on Eagle wings and he carries them On
[9:27] Eagle's Wings and I I think tonight if
[9:30] we're looking into this word um I've
[9:33] looked and studied the the the the the
[9:36] word mercy many times and we've took it
[9:38] through the scriptures and we've looked
[9:39] at he mercy endureth forever and he
[9:42] reduth his Mercy every morning and we've
[9:45] looked at the differences of mercy and
[9:47] Grace and and but I uh I don't know that
[9:50] I've ever specifically just settled down
[9:52] in the book God rich in Mercy and just
[9:55] spoke some declaring some things from
[9:58] there and I would like to do that
[9:59] tonight I'm going to be drawing some
[10:01] points directly from there and uh and I
[10:04] think it's a powerful time that we live
[10:07] and it's amazing how that it it's so in
[10:10] the scripture and what God has done uh I
[10:13] I think as we spoke a little bit Sunday
[10:15] here and and we saw that brother Bram
[10:17] says you know uh that that you were who
[10:20] once dead in sins and trespasses has God
[10:24] quickened or made alive and brother B
[10:26] starts begins that uh series of God rich
[10:28] and his Mercy he begins that tape with
[10:30] saying he said we were once dead in sins
[10:33] and trespasses but we're not tonight he
[10:36] says he said so what made that change
[10:39] amen it was God rich in his Mercy amen
[10:43] and then brother brandom tells us he
[10:44] wants to put a little Doctrine in there
[10:47] and uh and I wondered immediately what
[10:49] kind of Doctrine it was brother Brandon
[10:50] would teach that he'd have to excuse
[10:52] himself in the Pentecostal churches for
[10:54] teaching but he had that idea amen that
[10:57] a Believer was a thought to begin with
[11:00] as a part of the genuine attribute of
[11:02] God making them Eternal as the God in
[11:05] heaven is eternal and he knew that some
[11:07] of the people he was speaking to really
[11:09] didn't believe that but I I love how
[11:11] brother brandom says things because he
[11:13] was speaking to the believer he he was
[11:16] specifically speaking to the believer
[11:17] and when you listen to this God rich in
[11:19] Mercy he's addressing this whole book to
[11:22] a Believer or to the Believers of the
[11:25] age in the book of Ephesians Paul is
[11:28] addressing the book of Ephesians to the
[11:30] Saints or to the Believers of that age
[11:32] and brother bam is trying to spell out
[11:34] to the people he's trying to tell them
[11:37] that you were once dead but you're alive
[11:39] tonight because God who was rich in
[11:42] Mercy showed you Mercy amen when really
[11:45] we would have been out in the world and
[11:47] then he spells out his his thought he
[11:49] just gives us his thought and he uses
[11:52] two different uh stories to really expel
[11:54] the thought and he takes the duck who
[11:56] was in the chicken yard and he says oh
[11:58] he was he was really an ugly duckling
[12:00] but and when he smelt the water he said
[12:03] there he went right to that water nobody
[12:05] had to teach him anything nobody had to
[12:07] do only thing you had to do is get out
[12:09] of his way because he was a duck to
[12:11] begin with and then brother Brandon
[12:13] begins on to say he said this the same
[12:15] thing with the eagle the little fell was
[12:17] born down the chicken yard and then one
[12:19] day the mother Eagle come flying over
[12:21] screaming and she didn't have to make
[12:24] that baby an eagle she only had to make
[12:26] a noise amen that was different than the
[12:29] chicken now you sometimes people wonder
[12:31] why is it that we preach so much about
[12:33] the message and we quote brother brandom
[12:35] and things it's because if you're going
[12:38] to call Eagles you have to sound like an
[12:40] eagle to call Eagles now you'll never
[12:43] evangelize the world watering down this
[12:46] message to a Baptist message or to some
[12:49] denominational message but if we're
[12:51] going to catch Eagles we've got to
[12:53] preach the message of the hour and it
[12:56] will do exactly what it's supposed to do
[12:59] it'll call Eagles to itself amen I know
[13:02] sometimes people say well maybe you
[13:03] ought to water that down some but see
[13:05] this is too late in the season I believe
[13:07] amen that real eagles are going to catch
[13:09] the word of God Amen it's the season and
[13:12] if God's anointed you for it just go on
[13:14] and preach it and leave the rest of it
[13:16] up to God Amen I don't know about y'all
[13:18] but don't make my decision for me amen
[13:20] if it comes to Holiness don't water it
[13:22] down preach the gospel let me make my
[13:24] own choice amen amen I want to hear the
[13:27] word of God I want to hear it true and
[13:29] then let me decide how I'm going to
[13:30] believe or how I'm not you know amen I I
[13:33] think it's amazing years ago I was
[13:34] preaching a little meeting down in in
[13:36] Georgia and uh it was a powerful little
[13:38] meeting and there was just groups of
[13:40] people coming and it was a little bit of
[13:41] everybody was gathering into these
[13:43] little meetings and they wasn't probably
[13:44] over about 40 50 people but they was
[13:46] just hot you know and and I was
[13:48] preaching one night preaching Right
[13:50] Along on that eagle coming out of the
[13:51] chicken yard and there was a young man
[13:53] sitting back there he he was a baptist
[13:55] boy he was sitting back there and all of
[13:57] a sudden he just jumps up in the middle
[13:59] church and start speaking in unknown
[14:00] tongues and I'm preaching right away and
[14:02] he's preaching he's speaking back in
[14:04] tongues well and somebody said well was
[14:05] he out of order well let me say this to
[14:07] you nobody had taught him Church order
[14:09] CU he didn't even know nothing about
[14:11] speaking in tongues so it just struck
[14:13] him and he just jumped up and started
[14:15] rejoicing and he told me later he said I
[14:17] never done anything like that in my life
[14:19] Heen but what he told me later he said
[14:22] what happened was he said you you when
[14:24] you said something he said that
[14:26] anointing that was on you struck me and
[14:28] he said I knew it was the Holy Ghost and
[14:31] he said Lord I'll accept that Holy Ghost
[14:33] and when he received the Holy Ghost he
[14:35] done it right in the middle of preaching
[14:37] amen you know and I pray that we don't
[14:39] get so in order that somebody can't get
[14:42] saved while we're preaching anymore I I
[14:44] pray we get out of order enough amen
[14:46] that somebody can get the Holy Ghost
[14:48] while we're preaching the gospel that
[14:50] the spirit of God can just move into the
[14:53] hearts and lives amen and we can just
[14:55] preach the gospel I don't know about
[14:57] y'all but amen I say just preach the
[14:59] word and let the word of God come and
[15:01] move in the heart of the children of God
[15:03] and make it up and so brother bam is
[15:05] telling us see it was God rich in Mercy
[15:08] that done that cuz really amen we should
[15:10] all be dead in Traditions and we should
[15:13] be caught up in Creeds and how many of
[15:15] us were but we're not tonight now why
[15:18] aren't we there tonight because God who
[15:22] is a rich in Mercy amen decided that you
[15:25] would not stay there but God would call
[15:28] you out now brother br makes it clear he
[15:30] said now the reason this happens was is
[15:32] because God before the foundation of the
[15:35] world put your names on the Lamb's Book
[15:37] of Life and he said God didn't send
[15:39] Jesus to die and then come to find out
[15:42] somebody would hear the story feel sorry
[15:44] and come to the Lord he said but he was
[15:47] slain for those which were chosen before
[15:51] the foundation of this world even began
[15:53] God who was rich in Mercy sent Jesus to
[15:56] be slain for us because we desire desire
[15:59] to be
[16:01] saved and we desire to be healed is that
[16:05] right amen so because you desired
[16:07] brother B said then that's why God sent
[16:10] something because there was something in
[16:12] you Desiring to be saved something
[16:15] Desiring to be healed amen that's the
[16:17] reason he said something I I certainly
[16:19] believe tonight amen that brother bradam
[16:22] is teaching us amen that God was leading
[16:25] his children now in God rich and mercy
[16:27] he says something that's very powerful F
[16:29] he said now we find that God was so
[16:31] merciful to Moses out there in the Dead
[16:33] Sea Red Sea he says that when he said
[16:36] there in Exodus 19 and4 he said I
[16:39] carried you on Eagle wings and brought
[16:41] you under myself now carried them On
[16:44] Eagle's Wings and brought you to myself
[16:46] there was other men in the middle of
[16:48] that sea out there that were trying to
[16:50] impersonate that he said but he carried
[16:53] them on eagles wings now God always
[16:56] Likens His prophets to Eagles and what
[16:59] was it Moses was a messenger and they
[17:02] were following Moses and they was the
[17:05] Eagle wings that they were carried on
[17:08] because he was packing God's message and
[17:10] people that followed that they that were
[17:12] following God as they followed Moses
[17:15] with his message of Deliverance now the
[17:17] Bible said that they perish not with
[17:19] them who believe not because God was
[17:22] rich in Mercy because they were
[17:24] following his Commandments or his word
[17:27] or his providing way amen because they
[17:30] was ready to follow God's way God was
[17:33] rich in Mercy and they were not
[17:36] perishing with the unbeliever now I
[17:38] think it's powerful if you want to pull
[17:40] it up Exodus 19 and verse 4 this is
[17:42] where brother Adam's getting this Amen
[17:44] in in Exodus 19 and4 he said ye have
[17:47] seen what I did unto the Egyptians and
[17:51] how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and
[17:54] brought you unto
[17:56] myself now look at this this is what he
[17:58] said says and you have seen what I done
[18:01] under these Egyptians amen I I wonder
[18:03] tonight have you seen what God done to
[18:06] these Egyptians when we start talking
[18:08] about the mercy of God listen amen those
[18:12] Egyptians were in the same sea the
[18:14] Israelites were in but tonight amen we
[18:17] know that the Egyptians died in the sea
[18:21] and the Israelites lived amen why
[18:24] because God was rich in Mercy towards
[18:27] those who were following the message of
[18:29] the hour amen they they come through the
[18:32] same thing one lived and one died amen
[18:35] because God was rich in Mercy they were
[18:38] following the message of the hour amen I
[18:42] think it's powerful when you see it now
[18:44] watch here amen let's turn to Exodus 14
[18:46] and: 13 are do you have the ability to
[18:48] EQ this if you do just turn a little bit
[18:51] of the highs down and low give me bump
[18:53] me a little bit low Amen in Exodus 14
[18:56] and13 and Moses said unto the people now
[18:59] this is we're going to take a look have
[19:00] you saw what I did unto these Egyptians
[19:03] and Moses said unto the people fear not
[19:06] and stand still for the sou for ye shall
[19:09] see look at that for you shall see the
[19:12] salvation of the have you seen what the
[19:14] Lord did stand still and you shall see
[19:17] the salvation of the Lord which you show
[19:20] to you today for the Egyptians whom you
[19:24] seen today you shall see them again no
[19:28] more more
[19:30] forever it's a long time and the Lord
[19:33] shall fight for you and you shall hold
[19:35] your peace and the Lord said unto Moses
[19:38] now why criest thou unto me speak unto
[19:43] the children of Israel that they go
[19:45] forward thank you that they go forward
[19:47] amen now watch this the Lord said why
[19:50] criest thou unto me Moses speak the
[19:52] words of these people go forward brother
[19:54] bam said he said watch he said stand
[19:56] still and see the salvation of God he
[19:58] said the people would have had Moses
[20:00] running up and down the Bank full of
[20:02] emotion trying to figure out how to get
[20:04] over it but God said just stand still
[20:07] and see the salvation of God wait on
[20:10] inspiration wait on God to to move
[20:13] something out of the way look what he
[20:14] says he said for the Lord shall fight
[20:16] for you and you hold your peace
[20:18] wherefore CRI thou unto me speak un the
[20:20] children of Israel that they go forward
[20:23] now lift up thy rod and stretch thine
[20:25] hand over this sea and divide it and the
[20:29] children of Israel shall go on dry
[20:31] ground through the midst of this sea how
[20:33] many knows what that Rod
[20:35] represented the rod in the hand of Moses
[20:38] represented the name of Jesus Christ in
[20:41] the Church of the Living God and brother
[20:43] B said had Pharaoh ever got that Rod out
[20:46] of the hand of Moses he could have
[20:48] defeated the children of Israel but as
[20:51] long as Moses held on to that Rod as
[20:54] long as the church holds on to the name
[20:56] of Jesus Christ you're never going to
[20:59] defeat a people that has the name of
[21:01] Jesus Christ as their testimony in their
[21:04] hands see while Christ amen behold I
[21:06] will harden the hearts of these
[21:08] Egyptians and they'll follow them and I
[21:10] will get me honor upon pharaoh and upon
[21:13] all the host upon the Chariots upon his
[21:15] Horsemen and the Egyptians shall know
[21:17] that I am the Lord when I have gotten
[21:19] honor upon Pharaoh upon his chariots and
[21:22] upon his Horsemen and the angel of God
[21:24] somebody say the angel of Godel of God
[21:27] the angel of God which went before the
[21:30] camp of Israel removed and went behind
[21:33] them and the pillar of cloud went from
[21:35] before their face and stood behind them
[21:38] and it came between you got that you got
[21:41] that picture of the pillar of fire over
[21:42] brother bram's head and it came between
[21:44] the camp of the Egyptians and the camp
[21:46] of Israel and it was a cloud and
[21:48] darkness to them but it gave light by
[21:51] the night to these so that one came not
[21:53] near the other all the night long amen
[21:56] now watch what's happening the one one
[21:58] that was leading the children of Israel
[22:00] that great pillar of light that met them
[22:03] down there that had led them out of the
[22:05] camp of of Egypt it had led them up to
[22:09] this place amen it's now moved out from
[22:12] behind in front of them and has moved
[22:15] behind them now what was behind them was
[22:19] Egyptian Army so what God did now watch
[22:22] this God who is rich in Mercy the same
[22:26] one who was leading the church has now
[22:29] got himself in between the people of God
[22:33] and the thing that is trying to destroy
[22:35] them now I don't know amen if you've
[22:37] studied the mar The Mercy Seat very much
[22:40] but if you study The Mercy Seat you'll
[22:42] find out this that in the Ark of the
[22:44] Covenant later when Moses builds it and
[22:46] they build an ark of the covenant in the
[22:48] Holy Place how many knows what the mercy
[22:50] seat was there The Mercy Seat was they
[22:53] see they built a box you've seen the Ark
[22:55] of the Covenant they built a box and the
[22:57] wood when in and the uh the Commandment
[23:00] of the Lord went in there and I think it
[23:02] was later David's uh uh Goliath sword
[23:04] and some other things were stacked in
[23:06] there but it was where the word was now
[23:08] any man standing in the presence of that
[23:10] word would automatically die but what
[23:13] God did was he had Moses put a lid on it
[23:16] and that lid was a shittam wood covered
[23:19] amen with a golden uh layer and brother
[23:22] man said the wood represented the
[23:24] humanity he said but between the
[23:27] humanity and the blood he said he placed
[23:30] that deity showing it would be deity
[23:32] that stands between man and judgment he
[23:35] applied the blood to the gold showing
[23:38] deity itself would die to make a
[23:41] protection from the believer between the
[23:44] judgments of God see The Mercy Seat
[23:47] allows you to stand in the presence of
[23:50] God without dying something that's
[23:53] covering you something that's making a
[23:55] propitiation for you and here the
[23:57] children of is Israel are with their
[24:00] their Taskmaster their sins all of their
[24:03] past is upon them and God says I'm going
[24:06] to get between you and whatever it is
[24:09] that was going to destroy you that thing
[24:11] that followed you your whole life that
[24:13] trouble that has been upon your family
[24:16] that has cursed you and has tried to
[24:18] destroy you he said I'll get between you
[24:21] and the and the Very enemy that you have
[24:24] now brother brandom definitely
[24:25] identifies this now I go for Redemption
[24:27] by power I think I read this to you some
[24:30] time ago it stands reading again listen
[24:33] we got to tighten up our harness now and
[24:35] this angel of God which went before the
[24:37] camp of Israel is still here amen and
[24:41] the angel of God that went before the
[24:43] camp of Israel he says removed and went
[24:46] back behind them and that pillar of
[24:49] cloud went before the face and stood
[24:50] behind them he said a go between in the
[24:54] time of trouble when trouble begins to
[24:57] face you s sickness on every hand the
[25:00] angel of God comes up and goes out
[25:02] between you and the sickness and stands
[25:05] there in the way challenging you to take
[25:09] God's word God had give Israel the
[25:12] promise that they would go into that
[25:13] Land There was a million probably coming
[25:16] to pursue them and run them down and
[25:19] chop them down like a bunch of animals
[25:22] but the angel of the Lord who was there
[25:25] to carry them to the promised land rose
[25:28] up from the camp and went and stood
[25:31] behind them and the danger Hallelujah he
[25:35] still does it he will make a way oh I
[25:38] just love him don't you he'll make a way
[25:40] for every sick person sitting here right

[25:46] is standing between you and the trouble

[26:04] person sitting in this building had the
[26:06] enemy saying I'm going to destroy you

[29:17] Mercy the angel of God now friends this
[29:22] is this is not a Disney movie this is
[29:25] not
[29:26] fanaticism this is not some hype this is
[29:30] reality the angel of God that's in this
[29:33] picture is in this building tonight and
[29:37] he's standing between you and your
[29:39] trouble you said brother Wayne what
[29:41] makes the difference between somebody in
[29:44] trouble and somebody who this Angel it's
[29:46] whether you believe it or not however
[29:49] you judge that angel is how your life is
[29:52] going to go if you judge this as some as
[29:55] some some some idea or some fanaticism
[29:58] or some Pentecostal emotions oh you're
[30:00] going to judge it that way but you're
[30:02] going to receive the reward of that but
[30:04] to you who believe that this is the
[30:07] Angel of the Lord this is Jesus Christ
[30:10] in the baptism of the spirit to get in
[30:12] the church and deliver it you'll receive
[30:14] the reward of that in your
[30:17] life the man said judge it however you
[30:19] want to judge it but you'll receive the
[30:21] reward of your
[30:23] judgment in Exodus chapter 14 watch
[30:27] continue in the 21st verse and with the
[30:31] Lord standing there at their back
[30:34] brother Bram says watch to the Egyptians
[30:37] things got darker to the believer things
[30:41] got brighter the dark days turned into
[30:44] brightness when Moses be to part the
[30:46] waters things got brighter they begin to
[30:50] see a way out they begin to understand
[30:52] things can get better it looked like
[30:55] there was no way but God God made a way
[30:59] now listen friends you you've heard me
[31:01] preach and you've heard our brother
[31:03] Ericson preach it for years it does not
[31:05] change the fact to remember that God
[31:08] makes a way where there is no way listen
[31:12] when you come up to something and you
[31:14] can't get around it and you can't get
[31:16] under it and you can't get over it there
[31:19] is a God here that says when there is no
[31:22] way he's a God that makes a way and with
[31:25] every Temptation there is a way I've
[31:28] escaped do you know what brother Ram
[31:29] said the reason these men come to this
[31:31] place in the Red Sea he said they came
[31:33] to this place to prove to the believer
[31:37] that God will make a way where there is
[31:39] no way well whatever you're facing
[31:41] tonight is not a Red Sea I'll tell you
[31:43] that whatever you're looking at tonight
[31:45] is not trying to part a red sea but the
[31:48] same God that parted the Red Sea is the
[31:50] same God that can step into the
[31:52] situations of your life and change it
[31:55] because let me say without without
[31:57] hindrance without hesitation he is a god
[32:00] of mercy and because of his Mercy he has
[32:04] given us a richness tonight to stand
[32:06] here in a way where Moses could hand his
[32:10] just put his hand over the sea hallu and
[32:13] God caused a strong East Wind well we
[32:17] ain't got time to preach on all of it
[32:18] but you know that does sound something
[32:20] fierce don't it that gospel coming from
[32:23] the East under the west and here comes
[32:26] the Winds of the son of man isn't it
[32:28] something sunset and sunrise just after
[32:31] here comes that great wind Here Comes
[32:33] The Winds of the Gospel friends here
[32:35] comes the Winds of God it's what
[32:37] happened on the upper room it was a
[32:39] great wind amen the scripture says it
[32:41] was a great wind do you know something
[32:43] about a brush fire how many's ever been
[32:44] in a big brush fire you ever seen a
[32:46] great big brush fire you know what it
[32:48] does it generates its own wind amen it
[32:50] burns unwi but in a little bit it'll
[32:53] generate its own wind and I I've seen it
[32:56] I've seen it in meetings I've seen the
[32:57] the Holy Ghost settled down in the
[32:59] church and the power of God begin to
[33:01] burn and the next thing you know all you
[33:02] got to do is stand back from the
[33:04] platform and it starts generating its
[33:06] own anointing on the inside listen we're
[33:09] not serving a different God this is the
[33:11] same Jehovah god with a same power the
[33:14] same anointing these Egyptians you see
[33:17] what they did is they seen this Great
[33:20] Wall of water that was created by this
[33:22] wind of
[33:23] God and these Egyptians amen they
[33:27] decided to
[33:29] pursue them boys were not very
[33:34] smart but they figured that if a
[33:36] Believer went they could
[33:38] [Music]
[33:40] go brother Ram called it one place
[33:44] presumed they
[33:46] presumed that if you could do it they
[33:48] could do it oh my and brother Bram said
[33:50] you can't impersonate this you can't
[33:53] make a mockery of it amen watch what was
[33:56] it they said that came to in the morning
[33:59] he says look he says uh Egyptians
[34:00] pursued and went over after them in the
[34:02] midst of the sea and even all Pharaoh's
[34:04] horses and his chariots and his
[34:07] Horsemen see it was a setup
[34:10] folks it was a
[34:12] setup God set the devil up he would have
[34:17] never struck the way he struck if he
[34:19] didn't think he had the upper hand but
[34:22] because of where they were and what the
[34:25] situation was he thought for sure we we
[34:27] can put all the hell on him and we'll
[34:29] get him but God opened up a way and here
[34:33] they go in the middle of this sea and
[34:35] God the Bible said in the 25th verse
[34:37] this we we ought to write a song I think
[34:39] Moses already did but somebody write a
[34:40] new one on this one and he took off the
[34:43] chariot
[34:45] wheels God knocked the wheels off their
[34:49] wagons isn't it amazing here's the devil
[34:52] with all of his advantages and God just
[34:55] knocks the wheels off the wagons amen I
[34:58] tell you what amen every devil that's
[35:00] ever set upon you watch God knock the
[35:02] wheels off his wagon God just knocked
[35:05] the wheels right off and the Bible said
[35:07] and they drave them Heavenly or heavy so
[35:10] that the Egyptians said let us flee from
[35:12] the face of Israel let's get out of here
[35:14] guys this is not going well the Lord
[35:17] fighted for them and it do you know the
[35:21] Bible said I will be an adversary to
[35:23] your adversary do you know that this
[35:25] Bible says that God would be an enemy to
[35:28] your enemies do you recognize this
[35:30] tonight then that enemy of your life is
[35:33] not just your enemy that's God's enemy
[35:36] the enemy of your marriage is not just
[35:38] your enemy that's God's marriage amen
[35:40] that's God's enemy and God has taken
[35:42] your you said well brother Wayne this
[35:44] great enemy that's not just your enemy
[35:46] that's God's
[35:48] enemy this ain't just about you and the
[35:50] devil there's a God who is rich in
[35:54] Mercy oh thank you Jesus and he took the
[35:57] Chariot with
[35:59] Wheels that's just too good ain't it he
[36:02] just knock the wheels off their
[36:04] wagons I wonder if that's where they got
[36:07] that old scene uh uh I'll fix your
[36:11] wagon you know it don't you I I grew up
[36:15] with that term well he'll fix his wagon
[36:17] well God fixed the
[36:19] wagon he took the wheel off The
[36:23] Chariot amen so as that they decided we
[36:26] need to get out of here here amen but
[36:29] watch this but the Lord said unto now
[36:32] I'm still in Exodus 19:4 right have you
[36:34] not seen what I did under the Egyptians
[36:38] look what he did he stretched out thine
[36:40] hand over the sea that the waters May
[36:43] Come Again upon these Egyptians under
[36:45] the Chariots and upon their Horsemen God
[36:47] said to Moses take that name I've give
[36:50] you and hold it up now and cause the
[36:52] waters to implode upon this Army amen
[36:57] and mo Moses stretched forth his hand
[36:59] over the sea and the Sea returned to its
[37:01] strength and when the morning appeared
[37:03] the Egyptians fled against it and the
[37:06] Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the
[37:09] midst of the Sea and the waters returned
[37:13] and covered the Chariots and the
[37:15] horsemen and all the host of pharaoh
[37:17] that came into the sea after them and
[37:20] there remain not so much as one of
[37:24] them what was the prophecy again the
[37:27] these Egyptians you see today you will
[37:30] see them no more forever and here he
[37:33] says there wasn't one of them got out of
[37:35] the water not even one of them escaped
[37:38] on the other side the Bible said but the
[37:40] children of Israel walked upon the dry
[37:42] land of the midst of the Sea and the
[37:44] waters were a wall unto them on their
[37:47] right and on their left and the Lord
[37:49] saved Israel that day out of the hand of
[37:51] the Egyptians and Israel saw the
[37:54] Egyptians dead upon the seashore
[37:57] I tell you the only way they ever saw
[37:59] them again was they saw dead ones I love
[38:02] how brother randam says it and Israel
[38:04] saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore
[38:07] and watch the 31st verse and Israel saw
[38:10] the great work which the Lord had done
[38:13] upon the Egyptians now in Exodus 19
[38:16] Moses is saying to the children of
[38:18] Israel did you not see what God done to
[38:21] these
[38:23] Egyptians did you not pay attention to
[38:25] what God done to these Egyptians what
[38:28] did they do God so destroyed them that
[38:30] he saw them floating in the sea I I I I
[38:33] personally I've always loved this
[38:35] portion of scripture I've always thought
[38:38] about the Believers looking back in the
[38:40] ocean or the sea and and swirling up on
[38:43] the beaches come the problems of their
[38:47] past amen but dead have you ever have
[38:50] you ever had it you you know what I'm
[38:51] talking about you ever had that thing
[38:54] that you just you had to fight to keep
[38:56] it out of your spirit or that little
[38:57] trouble that seems to just haunt you and
[39:00] then later you come face to face with
[39:02] the same situation but it's just dead
[39:04] thankes have you ever seen it when it
[39:06] just becomes powerless like it just dies
[39:10] you know what that little thing that
[39:11] bother all of a sudden it's just dead
[39:13] and it's there it's the same as it
[39:15] always is but it just don't have any
[39:17] more power because God killed the thing
[39:20] amen because God is rich in Mercy he
[39:24] kills the thing so as that the believer
[39:26] can go free brother Bram said Israel had
[39:28] overcome those Egyptians passing through
[39:31] that by grace through that Red Sea and
[39:33] drowned those Egyptians he said which
[39:35] was a type of passing through the blood
[39:37] of the Lord Jesus and the Tas maskers
[39:40] that once drove you to the sins of this
[39:42] world are dead behind
[39:45] you I don't know amen of probably a
[39:48] better part of the message of the hour
[39:50] in my life amen is to understand that
[39:53] that seed was a type of the blood of our
[39:56] Lord Jesus and the enemies which were so
[39:59] hounding you are actually dead they are
[40:03] dead they have no more movement they
[40:05] have no more power amen they drove you
[40:07] for years but they're dead now amen amen
[40:10] they're haunting people amen only in the
[40:13] memory because the death has come to the
[40:15] enemy that would hold you and brother
[40:17] random says of course amen he said no
[40:19] wonder oh Miriam had that heart
[40:22] spell she picked up that tambourine and
[40:25] begin to dance and jump on those Banks
[40:27] he said oh you know the Holy Spirit it
[40:30] just catches from one to others he said
[40:33] you know that Holy Spirit it just
[40:35] catches from one to others see it was an
[40:37] old Holy Ghost meeting that's what it
[40:39] was they just begin to realize that the
[40:42] thing were dead now now if you see a
[40:44] little dancing and shouting going on
[40:46] around here y'all don't think nothing
[40:48] about it what it is is people recognize
[40:50] things died amen and there's nothing
[40:53] more glorious in a life when you packing
[40:56] things and carrying things and it's
[40:57] heavy on you and all of the sudden it
[41:00] dies and when it dies it is dead and all
[41:03] you feel like shouting all a sudden you
[41:06] just feel like rejoicing when's the last
[41:08] time you just you just said you know
[41:10] what devil you shot but you missed and I
[41:12] want to thank the Lord tonight that I
[41:14] have Liberty to be in the house of God I
[41:17] want to thank the Lord tonight that I
[41:18] love everybody I don't hold no grudges
[41:21] no feelings amen it's it's a blessing
[41:23] now some of you come from hard things
[41:26] but you're not carrying it with you
[41:27] tonight because that old thing died and
[41:30] you seen it in the blood of the Lord
[41:33] Jesus and now you can shout you can
[41:35] Rejoice you can amen the word of God you
[41:38] can have Liberty because everything is
[41:40] dead in the blood of our Lord Jesus
[41:44] listen amen can you ask yourself tonight
[41:46] why is it that others were swallowed up
[41:49] in the same thing but you're alive
[41:52] tonight can I say it it was God who was
[41:55] rich in Mercy it wasn't the that you're
[41:57] better than somebody else it wasn't amen
[42:00] that you deserve more than somebody else
[42:03] but it's God who is rich in Mercy amen
[42:06] there's one reason that there are some
[42:08] who never make it and there are others
[42:10] that are standing on the bank tonight
[42:13] with Joy in their heart it is God rich
[42:16] in Mercy don't ever get hotti don't ever
[42:19] get high minded don't ever get on a high
[42:22] horse and say big me and little them or
[42:24] amen look how wonderful I am and how
[42:26] little they are you just say oh thank
[42:29] God tonight that me a sinner was saved
[42:31] by grace and I'm not just saved I'm free
[42:35] I'm not just saved I've got the Holy
[42:37] Ghost I'm not just saved I can believe
[42:40] the message of the hour I've got a right
[42:42] to Liberty because God is rich in
[42:47] Mercy that's why it is the way it
[42:50] is God rich in
[42:55] Mercy now watch the prophet he said they
[42:59] bore them On Eagle's Wings in other
[43:01] words he carried them through the
[43:03] sea because they were following the
[43:08] message he said see now watch him say it
[43:11] here in paragraph 78 Moses knowed that
[43:15] he was to carry those children over into
[43:17] that promised land now can I do
[43:19] something here for you brother random
[43:22] knowed that he was to carry those
[43:24] children over into that Promised Land
[43:27] because the promise was given to him and
[43:30] he must pack them into that promised
[43:32] land and
[43:34] today the holy spirit is here to
[43:36] vindicate God's word and that's the
[43:39] eagle
[43:40] Wing that we're supposed to ride
[43:43] on not some man-made theology but were
[43:47] to ride on the wings of the eagle to the
[43:50] promised land right he Bears them or
[43:54] carries them on the wings of Eagle
[43:57] what's he talking about the prophet is
[43:59] talking about prophetic word he's
[44:02] talking about the message of the hour
[44:04] when God fulfills his word it lifts the
[44:07] church up and packs them out of
[44:10] denominational Creeds it lifts the
[44:12] church up and it packs them out of their
[44:15] unbelief and their ungodliness see if it
[44:18] wasn't for the mercy of God you'd be an
[44:21] Old Crow on the ground tonight if it
[44:23] wasn't for the mercy of God you'd be
[44:25] some Hawk sitting on a telephone wi
[44:27] somewhere but God rich in Mercy
[44:31] fulfilled these Seven Seals and unveiled
[44:34] a word in this age had caused you to
[44:36] rise up with Eagle wings to a a land
[44:40] Beyond
[44:41] denomination now now look what and now
[44:43] look what brother bam is doing here
[44:45] let's let's just examine here in uh God
[44:48] rich and mercy paragraph 108 but God
[44:51] rich in his Mercy sent back the Holy
[44:53] Spirit Upon Us vindicating his word
[44:56] tonight
[44:57] as he promised he would do God promised
[45:00] he would do these things and look what
[45:04] he
[45:05] did amen amen look what he
[45:10] did now how now we can
[45:14] see what he promised in each age a
[45:17] certain thing would happen we found out
[45:19] that it happened exactly like it that's
[45:22] what he said he would do because he is
[45:24] rich in his Mercy he always has Mercy to
[45:27] fulfill every word that he has promised
[45:31] watch in Exodus 19 and verse 4 reread
[45:33] that again and watch the scriptures lay
[45:35] together with what brother randam is
[45:37] saying it's it's a very beautiful it's a
[45:40] very beautiful thing here let me get
[45:42] back to it uh we can pull it back up
[45:44] there it is Exodus 19 and4 look at what
[45:46] it says ye have seen what I have done
[45:51] unto these
[45:52] Egyptians amen you have seen what I have
[45:55] done unto these Egyptians and how I bear
[45:58] You On Eagle's Wings and brought you
[46:03] unto
[46:04] myself look here's here's brother
[46:07] brandom paragraph 109 look what he
[46:11] did how we can now see
[46:14] it here's a prophet just like
[46:18] Moses he's examining God rich and mercy
[46:22] and he's saying look look at what God
[46:25] did and and now how we can see it Moses
[46:30] standing back in the scripture was
[46:32] telling the children of Israel did you
[46:33] not see what God done to these Egyptians
[46:36] and how he took you up On Eagle's Wings
[46:38] and brought you to himself now here's
[46:40] the prophet saying God by Vindicated
[46:43] word is supposed to lift a bride up by
[46:47] Eagle wings and bear them unto
[46:51] himself now look what he did amen look
[46:56] what he did look what he did I I think
[46:58] it's powerful myself brother Bon
[47:00] preaches an entire sermon I have heard
[47:04] but now I see I have heard but now I see
[47:08] see it's like Moses Moses had heard of
[47:11] him being a great Jehovah but when he
[47:13] could see him he was in the form of a
[47:16] pillar of fire I have heard of thee but
[47:18] now I see thee what was it he seen his
[47:21] word
[47:23] Vindicated amen look at him what he has
[47:26] done what did Moses see his word
[47:30] Vindicated amen look at it paragraph 116
[47:33] that burning bush gave V Vindication
[47:36] with what prophet Abraham had said Moses
[47:39] said I've heard of it but now I see it
[47:42] amen I think it's powerful and in
[47:44] paragraph 118 brother B said this and
[47:47] the church has heard of God they've read
[47:50] about him and what he did and the
[47:53] promises he made but now we see him with
[47:56] our eyes
[47:58] the same as job
[48:01] did I have heard of thee but now I see
[48:04] thee what a
[48:07] difference I have heard God was rich in
[48:10] Mercy but now I see God is rich in Mercy
[48:14] see I heard God was a deliverer but
[48:17] tonight look and see what God has done
[48:20] look at how he brought you out look at
[48:22] this we we talk about the message of the
[48:24] hour we talk about all the Chang es and
[48:27] Luther and Wesley and all the ministry
[48:29] of brother Ram we look at all of that
[48:31] but stand back and look a little a
[48:33] little bit in a different realm and
[48:36] realize that it was God rich in Mercy so
[48:39] you wouldn't be stuck in a
[48:41] denominational trap
[48:43] tonight had God never caused brother
[48:46] brandham to preach things contrary to
[48:48] the Pentecostals like that little
[48:50] Doctrine you'd be setting in a
[48:52] Pentecostal church tonight amen if God
[48:55] had to cause brother randam to dis agree
[48:57] with them on communion and on serpent
[48:59] seed and on marriage and divorce where
[49:02] would we be tonight we would be in the
[49:04] same trap they're setting in tonight but
[49:07] God rich in Mercy carried you on Eagle
[49:10] wings out of the denominational systems
[49:13] and bore you unto himself he has brought
[49:16] you to his own self amen that's why we
[49:19] find tonight knowing amen that if we're
[49:22] going to find the word of God Amen
[49:24] brother Adam says it very clearly that
[49:26] Jesus was an attribute he said so is
[49:29] every believer that comes to God an
[49:31] attribute of God manifested for the word
[49:34] of that day now see we're living in the
[49:38] age when the shuck has pulled away from
[49:41] it and where wheat is beginning to be
[49:45] seen yeah this is not a Pentecostal age
[49:48] this is a Latter Day age this is a
[49:51] bright age this is the evening light
[49:54] this is Malachi 4 this is to follow
[49:57] God's pattern of St Luke 17:30 he says
[50:00] see it's Jeremiah and all of the rest of
[50:02] them that Joe spoke of in the last day I
[50:05] have heard Lord it was coming but now I
[50:09] see it with my eye I heard that was
[50:12] going to be a perfect bride but I'm not
[50:15] hearing it tonight I'm seeing it with my
[50:17] eye because God is rich in Mercy that's
[50:21] why we could see what God done unto the
[50:23] Egyptians and how he bore you out to
[50:26] nomination on eagles wings and carried
[50:29] you into the revelation of himself
[50:32] somebody packed you to it you would have
[50:35] never found the Revelation you would
[50:37] have never come to it you would have
[50:39] never studied your way in amen I I don't
[50:41] mean to be arrogant one time I heard a
[50:43] preacher preaching and me and him had a
[50:45] discussion or two I'll have to be admit
[50:47] but he said to me he said brother he
[50:49] said look he said if I didn't ever come
[50:51] to the message he said i' didn't preach
[50:53] these things anyhow cuz they in the
[50:55] Bible and I just laughed at the
[50:57] guy I me I don't know of one thing I had
[51:01] right before I come to the message I
[51:03] don't know of one Doctrine or one
[51:05] understanding that I had correct but God
[51:08] rich in Mercy packed me out of my own
[51:11] unbelief and my own denominational mind
[51:15] and pack me into the word of God in this
[51:17] age unless God lifts you up you will be
[51:21] stuck in the Rut of denomination even if
[51:24] it's the denomination of one person
[51:28] even if it's in your own understanding
[51:30] it don't take a whole church or a whole
[51:32] group of guys to have denomination when
[51:35] you've decided what it is and that's it
[51:37] and period and nobody can teach you and
[51:40] nobody can help you because you're so
[51:42] arrogant in your own mind you have
[51:43] become a denomination of one but God
[51:46] rich in his Mercy can break that thing
[51:49] tonight and pack You On Eagle's Wings
[51:52] and bear you into the presence of God I
[51:54] say God is Rich and mercy
[51:57] mer I say he's a rich God in Mercy look
[52:01] what he done brother man said look what
[52:03] he done now isn't it amazing God rich in
[52:06] Mercy that he actually turns the service
[52:08] right there he said look what he done
[52:10] and automatically he brings up Hatty W
[52:13] Waldrop and he said she had cancer of
[52:15] the heart I thought it was amazing I
[52:17] studying that today and he said this
[52:19] woman was dying in my prayer line she
[52:21] was a nurse over in in Louis Lex
[52:24] Louisville and come into the prayer line
[52:25] said she was supposed to be a dead woman
[52:27] he said matter of fact they have her on
[52:29] the Scrolls amen as dead tonight over in
[52:32] the hospitals he said but God was rich
[52:34] in Mercy and come to that woman listen
[52:37] she had heart cancer folks amen and
[52:40] that's exactly what this Ley and age had
[52:43] it had cancer it had cancer the Heart It
[52:46] come on church that's exactly what was
[52:48] wrong with the heart this end time it
[52:51] was the heart of man it's not what was
[52:53] coming into them it was what's coming
[52:56] out of them
[52:59] him we and we were in trouble and a
[53:03] man's heart that's dark is blind and he
[53:05] can't help himself and it's veiled and
[53:07] he can't understand and he's dark in the
[53:10] world of unbelief but God rich in Mercy
[53:13] send a seventh angel to turn the light
[53:15] on and to Quicken the heart and heal it
[53:18] to set the church back in order and
[53:21] tonight here we say it with a healed
[53:23] heart I say Look What the Lord Has Done
[53:28] I I I I could break into this and y'all
[53:30] know I can Amen in this area because
[53:32] what a heart is the main functionary of
[53:34] a human being it's a sinner right split
[53:37] up in four cental amen coming in a going
[53:40] keeps the whole body alive cuz life is
[53:42] in the blood didn't he say it life is in
[53:44] the blood and the Heart of the Church of
[53:46] the Living God Amen life is in the blood
[53:49] take the Holy Ghost out and you got a
[53:51] dead church if you water the Holy Ghost
[53:53] down you got an anemic church amen and
[53:56] we don't want anemia we don't want
[53:58] diabetes we don't want a blood disease
[54:01] we want to eat the vitamins of the
[54:03] opening of The Seven Seals until the
[54:05] richness of the blood of the abrahamic
[54:08] Covenant
[54:10] [Applause]
[54:11] flows you know what I'm talking about
[54:13] brother BR said that he said that that
[54:15] that deity spirit bit him he said it bit
[54:18] me and he said but my blood was too
[54:21] rich he said so it couldn't affect me
[54:24] and it crawled right back in the mud
[54:25] puddle
[54:26] it went back in that group of people
[54:29] because it couldn't affect me and he
[54:30] says it he said and there's coming some
[54:32] vitamins in the opening of these Seven
[54:35] Seals that you can start eating on them
[54:37] vitamins listen the reason the deity
[54:39] spirit is still alive because they
[54:41] didn't eat that seven seal and if they
[54:43] had Feast on the unfailing body word
[54:46] they would find the vitamin in there
[54:48] that it's not brother random it's the
[54:50] angel of God that does these works so if
[54:53] it wasn't brother bradam it was the
[54:55] angel of God that
[54:56] then that same Angel is in this building
[54:59] tonight to perform the same
[55:04] thing you see it was it was a heart
[55:06] cancer that was look look what brother B
[55:09] said look what he did hady waldrip look
[55:13] what he done for Congressman up sh
[55:16] paralyzed that's not to me now it's not
[55:21] it's not always just a a a simple thing
[55:24] the reason brother B picks the people he
[55:25] picks the talk
[55:27] about but he talks about an important
[55:29] man but a paralyzed
[55:33] man now when when you're when you're
[55:35] reading about Congressman Upshaw almost
[55:37] every time brother brandham gets to
[55:39] Congressman Upshaw he stops and he says
[55:42] see what was happening in the meeting
[55:43] that night and he said I was I was
[55:46] sitting here and I started praying he
[55:48] said and and there was a a vision come
[55:51] up before me and he said there was a
[55:52] colored lady and he said I see a little
[55:54] girl on the doctor's uh uh uh surgery
[55:58] and he said I see a surgeon do something
[56:01] and he's operating on the voice of the
[56:03] child and the child is now
[56:07] paralyzed now if I get too spiritual
[56:10] y'all forgive me but I think the prophet
[56:12] told us things for a
[56:14] reason you let somebody operate on your
[56:18] voice you let them fool with your voice
[56:22] and it'll paralyze you
[56:25] yes that's you let them F now now
[56:27] brother Bram said it in in the message
[56:29] perfect Faith he said either your faith
[56:31] will paralyze the world or the world
[56:34] will paralyze your
[56:36] faith brother bam uh you know you know
[56:38] brother Wayne don't quote that
[56:43] part you know there's an area of the
[56:45] message I don't know if we really are to
[56:47] get into it because you know there's
[56:48] some Fanatics out there and some
[56:50] situations you know and things it'll
[56:52] paralyze
[56:55] you the devil knows what he's
[56:58] doing amen it'll paralyze and look
[57:03] brother Bram said that little girl went
[57:04] under the operation and she's paralyzed
[57:06] and the and the lady comes running up
[57:09] and says brother brandham will my
[57:11] daughter be healed and brother BR said I
[57:14] don't know Sister he said all I've seen
[57:16] is what was wrong with her yeah right
[57:20] and he said you know what that's the
[57:21] thing he said many people who come to
[57:23] the platform he said they only stayed
[57:26] long enough to find out what's
[57:28] wrong he said they don't stay long
[57:31] enough to find out another vision for
[57:33] the
[57:34] future he said the first thing that
[57:37] happened was the gift to tell her what
[57:39] was wrong he said but she got the
[57:41] pulling you paraphrasing now and in a
[57:45] little bit when she started pulling he
[57:47] said then the vision began to break and
[57:50] he said I seen a little girl crossing
[57:52] the street holding a baby doll y'all
[57:54] remember the story and he said I've seen
[57:56] her walking I said now now sister now
[57:59] she can walk isn't that something a
[58:02] minute before couldn't walk but now a
[58:05] vision has broke over a prophet God rich
[58:10] in
[58:11] Mercy she would have stayed in that
[58:15] condition but God rich in Mercy gave a
[58:19] vision to a prophet so as to fulfill the
[58:23] word of the Lord and the fulfill fing of
[58:26] the word gave life to the child isn't it
[58:29] powerful she she received her ability to
[58:32] walk and brother said right then when it
[58:33] broke open and I seen Congressman Upshaw
[58:36] that's when it broke right then and
[58:38] here's an important man paralyzed you
[58:40] know and then brother bradam begins to
[58:42] tell it what's he doing he's he's
[58:44] telling
[58:46] us God rich in Mercy
[58:50] look what he's done
