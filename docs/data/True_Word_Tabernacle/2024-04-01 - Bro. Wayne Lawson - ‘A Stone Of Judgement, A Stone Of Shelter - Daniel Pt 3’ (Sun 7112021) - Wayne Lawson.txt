you have your Bibles today we' just like to go into the word uh and we'd like to go here to the Book of Daniel uh the second chapter and amen and uh I thought I was seeing things there for a minute folks all the way from Kentucky amen God bless you and amen or I don't know if you live in Kentucky or Indiana but Indiana okay uh and uh just want to greet everyone I was seen uh somewhere here from Arizona and Indiana and different parts and amen we just want to greet each one of you in the name of the Lord and amen we want to turn to the Book of Daniel uh the second chapter we're going to be reading here uh from the 31st verse and again we're going to read down to about verse uh 45 brother Nathan you want to read for us again amen he does a wonderful job doesn't he amen and maybe brother Al maybe brother Steven won't get us for them 30 verses 31 to 45 thou oh King sawest and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible this image's head was of fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smot the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king thou oh king art a king of kings for the god of Heaven hath given thee a kingdom power and strength and glory and wheresoever the children of men dwell the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand and hath made thee ruler over them all thou art this head of gold and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and another third Kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earth and the fourth Kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron breth in pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that breakthe shall it break in pieces and bruise and whereas thou sawest the Fe and Toes part of Potter's clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as thou sawest the iron mixed with myy clay and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with myy Clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay and in the day of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever for as much as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation that thereof sure am amen amen God bless you as you can be seated that's a powerful uh reading of the scripture amen seeing that uh this is setting forth what would be uh the future uh of the times of the Gentiles it was given all the way back in the days of Daniel and and to realize that it is still actually being fulfilled In This Very hour showing the scripture how that it can predict the future so powerfully uh we want to maybe just say as we're we've been in other parts of Daniel so we're we're coming to this image now but the answer of course we just read of how that Daniel has spoke to Nebuchadnezzar concerning the dream that he had and you remember that Nebuchadnezzar actually having this great dream wanted someone to interpret it so he invited all the preachers and he invited all the Evangelist and he invited all the wise men of that age and all of him said the same thing to him if you tell it the dream then we'll tell you the interpretation now this King he outsmarted him by saying to them yeah if I tell you the dream you'll know it and then you can tell me whatever you think it means and then none of us will know what it means uh because it'll be just an interpretation he said but if you could tell me the dream then we would be sure of the interpretation which would raise the faith of Nebuchadnezzar to know exactly what the dream actually meant and then of course then we see that nobody would know what them seals were of course because the seven seal wasn't even given a symbol to it and but God would send a messenger in the earth and then he would tell us what it is and what it means so that we could have a perfect Vindication and have faith in what the answers are so God sends an answer well when this dream Becomes Of course here uh here we're looking at the dream of Nebuchadnezzar the exact image and this image is going to lay over the history of the world uh uh from the time of Nebuchadnezzar all the way to the Rapture of the church so it's going to stand there now uh I don't want to get too much into a into just a bible school or to a Bible lesson but I think it's healthy and and and for believers to read their Bibles and to understand scripturally where they're standing in the ages they're living in other words that some of these things that seem so odd to us uh to become reality they're exactly scripture and it's not something that brother Bram just pulled out of the cloud but rather it's something that God had put in the scripture that the church would be able to identify once that the seals were revealed or the Thunders were opened that the symbols would become manifest now in the Book of Daniel the 2 chapter we start looking at the image of Daniel that he saw here and of course we we see the image I think brother Isaac downloaded an image so you can see it with your eyes uh of course what we're seeing is the head of gold and in Daniel chapter 2 the Bible ansed aners this specifically and says the head of gold of course is Nebuchadnezzar the 38th verse of Daniel says uh Thou Art the head of gold so that was the Babylonian Kingdom that was ruling at the time when Daniel was upon the Earth so that was the head of gold but he said then there would come one who was inferior so you going to watch now this image is going to start with a head of gold and end up with feet of brass or excuse me of iron and Clay so there is a devaluing of the material ials that represent these nations but there is a hardening of these now being that this image is going to start with the head and go down to the feet is teaching Us number one the image will never stand because brother B says watch the heaviest part of it is in the beginning so the head he said will never stand on this image so when you read it you're looking at an image that just cannot stand but it's going to start with a head and go downward amen but then God has an image of course in the church he builds a statue and he starts it from the bottom and then he goes to the top so you're looking at an image it won't stand while God has his image that will stand so in these times then you see the Babylonian Empire which is the head of gold now we see a a beast just to the right of it now when you see that it's an oddl looking beast but you'll find if you like to if You' like to read your Bibles uh it's pretty powerful because over in the Book of Daniel in the seventh chapter Daniel sees a vision of the very same thing later that that Nebuchadnezzar saw in the dream but when Daniel sees it he doesn't see it as an image he sees them as a beast so then you can see four beast on the right side of this of this drawing and we're going to give a little uh uh credits to brother Ronnie M Malo I hope how I Malo Ronnie Malo from the Philippines uh because it would have took somebody to draw that last part there that understood the word amen the bomi Empire is the head of gold scripture say says that the Meen Persians Which history will tell you the same was the next Kingdom that moved in after the Babylonians you can read that right in the scripture if you like to it's actually in Daniel 5 and: 28 and the Bible says that the kingdom is divided and given unto the mes and the Persians amen which is also Daniel uh chapter chapter 8 so it's the mes and the persans were given and then the next Kingdom that was following this was going to be the kingdom of the grecians you read about it in your history books called Alexander the Great and this is hundreds of years before Alexander Great's ever been born and here Daniel is telling the king of Babylon the kingdom that will follow the mes and Persians and they will be thigh of brass and of course to the right is the symbol that Daniel saw in the other verses but in the according to scripture Daniel chapter uh Daniel 8: 21 and the rough goat which is the king of Greece and the the horn that is between his eyes is the first king so it was the Alexander the Great or the Greeks it was the king of Greece that was going to follow after him now so then you have the Babylonians the mes and Persians which happened in the time of Daniel then you have the Greeks of Alexander the Great which follows but now the but the next one history will also tell you but in the scripture it'll tell you that the legs of iron and the toes uh uh the feet of of iron and Clay are mixed together as a kingdom in itself and the next Kingdom that was going to rule would be the Roman Empire now the Roman Empire was the Empire that was that was actually ruling during the time of Jesus Christ you can go back in the scriptures and read it uh if you if you'd like to see it in the actual scripture uh you can see in Daniel chapter 11 he said he shall stand up in the estate of the razor of taxes and the glory of the Kingdom but within a few days he shall be destroyed neither in Anger nor in battle and his estate shall stand a vile person uh to whom shall not give honor the kingdom but shall come in peace L and obtain the kingdom by flatteries now if you go back to the scripture in the Book of Luke you'll find out in the time of Jesus the razor of taxes of course was Caesar how that Rome in the time of the birth decided the whole world would be taxed and of course then Daniel saw the taxes coming on the world from The Book of Daniel all the way back here he was seeing the time of Christ when Rome would come in and and would settle now just in just a few verses we're seeing that there was an exact prediction of world world events in history in the time of Daniel showing us that God knew exactly who was going to be ruling he knew exactly at what time they would Rule and he knew exactly who would rule after them showing us then that God is Not on a a nerve medication this morning wondering how things are going to unfold I I want you to be assure to you this morning our God is in control of world governments he's in control of this nation and how it's going to rise and how it's going to fall he can detail the very thing before it ever happens now as a world we got in right now people are scared to death of Communism and they're scared of all the socialism and the Muslims and all these things that are rising up but Len I tell you what you need to fear more than anything a prophet said fear romanism because the Bible predicts Rome will rule from the time after the grecians all the way to the end now the problem is is how to see that Rome is still in control cuz right now today if you ask somebody who's ruling the world uh almost nobody would tell you that Rome is ruling the world but rather Rome is ruling the world right now and it's got more power today than it had when it was ruling as an imperial Rome back in the days of Christ now when you when you read these scriptures here of course Daniel 2 and Daniel 7 are actually telling you the same things and and they're uh and also through Daniel the 8th chapter so there's going to be a lot of repetitive and and maybe more things throughout Daniel that does the same thing it repeats itself and shows but now this last Kingdom when you come to it which would be the Roman Empire you can see that it's divided in two legs the iron now the iron represents Force which Rome used to rule the world throughout hundreds of years to Christ now uh of course uh if you if you like to uh if you like to read the scriptures uh brother Ram explains this very beautifully uh from the pergam age brother said show the exact truth of this matter I do not want anyone to think I'm just giving a revelation of my own but it's found in the scripture and in pergam age he reads Daniel chapter 2 31-45 just like I just did and here in is revealed an exact account of the future unfulfilled history that was prophesied to come upon the Earth from the time of Daniel until Jesus would come and reign as the son of David and it's within four historical divisions which are known by the dominating Empire in each division Babylonian medial Persian Greece and Rome the greatest and most absolute monarchies the Babylonian was typified as the head of gold now the next brother B goes through the the types and then he comes to the to the Roman to the last one here finally came the last Kingdom which is the Roman Empire typified as the legs and the feet but were in the former kingdoms were typified as pure minerals pure gold silver and Brass this last empire was pure iron only in the legs for when it came to the feed it was a mixture of iron and clay and mineral and soil just don't mix and produce constantly excuse me and produce consistency and strength but not only is it so but almost amazing The Last Empire Rome would endure its peculiar mixed state right up until Jesus returns the Roman Empire the iron signifying power and great destructive force and opposition was to be have two main divisions and it certainly was for the empire literally split in two East and West both most very powerful and crushing all that was before them now but as the glory and the power of Empires fell so the Empire began to fall thus Rome Pagan Imperial Rome was no longer iron so she crumbled she was wounded to death and Rome could not rule it was all over Sal thought the world but how Rome the world was for the head Rome which was wounded unto death amen uh we're going to read Revelation 13 and three and the heads appeared to have been mortally wounded and the throat having been slashed and his death stroke was healed the whole earth followed after the wild beast in amazement see people look at Rome like they look at a nation of Italy and as they look they did not realize that Rome with her secret strict confines where the pope has an actual area his domain is literally a nation within Nation she has ambassadors receives ambassadors paple false Christian Rome she is called the eternal City Blasphemous how she controls by religion even more ably than when Pagan Imperial Rome controlled the pure iron of force Rome took on a new lease of life when Constantine joined the church in the state backed it in the Union by force and the spirit that motivated Pagan Rome is the Same Spirit now that motivates false Christian Rome and you can see that is so because you know that the fourth Empire never went out of existence it changed its Tech texture amen from the Nik naan Council swung power of political Rome to a church and it seemed there were no limits which the First Christian Church would go the name Christian was originally brought persecution now became the persecutors it was the age of Augustine hippo set forth the precept of the church ought and must use Force necessary to bring her children back to the fold and it was the harmony with the word of God to kill Heretics and apostles Now isn't it amazing that the scripture is detecting how wonderfully God had predicted what was coming in the future when he showed the two legs of iron and how that how many ever read it in history or studied in your history books that the entire world which which what when we think of the world now we're including the United States and Canada and South America but when when when the scriptures talking about the world it was the history of the world basically was written in Europe and and when you look at Europe look how uh uh Alexander the Great controlled Europe and then how Rome controlled Europe the the the main Nations there and but the scriptures are showing you with history that it was divided in two places how many know Rome actually divided their their Kingdom the Roman Empire had a western and a and a and a Eastern leg so they were divided in two parts but they were they were actually just Iron Wheel and they broke down and they took over and they ruled and they done all of this until a bunch of Barbarian kings started getting involved and the next thing you know they couldn't rule well with just the iron and the clay and it begin and the kingdom begin to diverse and look like they was going to lose the kingdom but then history and scripture reports that when Rome looked like it was going to die Constantine Rises up and brings chrisad doome into the into Rome and then ties together the Roman Empire with the Christian faith and when he ties them together then all of the sudden Rome is now going to go into every nation in the Earth as a religion amen and it's its head is all the way back there in Rome now can you imagine think about this you couldn't you if you if you take national leaders today maybe America can't say anything what happens in France or Russia can't say anything happens in America but the Pope says what happens in all of those countries do you see then he has a he has a rulership in every country in the Earth showing that iron was going to run down in into the toes Amen in those in those teen kingdoms look at this even now amen that what used to be monarchs y'all remember Kings used to be in Europe but all of a sudden we don't have Kings anymore now we got just people who rule there amen and and think about this because the Bible says in Revelation 17 he gave them the power of Kings but they wasn't Kings now now now at that time they couldn't understand that cuz everybody was a king but not now they me they have the power of a king but they're not a king and they was given that power Power by Rome but the Bible said they would only hold that power to the scripture is fulfilled and then those 10 Kings will burn that wh amen and her and her cities which is recorded in Revelations the 18th chapter when the Bible says that Rome will be destroyed in the space of one hour now now friends I I think it's pretty powerful that John was writing that 2,000 years ago and there wasn't even thoughts of adom bombs there wasn't no way to destroy a city in the space of one hour but God knew exactly that he would send something in the last day and there would be an increase of knowledge and that knowledge would break into people think about this just a moment somebody like like Einstein could reach into the Unseen World and pull an atom out that you can't even see and could split that atom and bring it into nuclear energy which would make a bomb that could burn a city in the space of one hour which didn't even exist for hundreds of years but right at the end time when the Bible Pro prophesies that Rome will be destroyed God sends a way to destroy it on the earth at the same time now now when you when you start reading these things it's pretty amazing because you're you're you're seeing uh Daniel 2 predict world events now we could talk about the entire statue and we could take a long time and somebody said well why would you even look at any of it well I think it's powerful because the Bible says these things were written for us for an example to bring hope amen Now isn't it amazing that we're looking at the end of the world right now amen but there is hope that comes in this time and you can find that hope right here in the scripture showing that there was a kingdom that followed every kingdom is that right and when you come to the end of one Kingdom there's another kingdom coming in so so the scriptures are showing us that you got four kingdoms and the and the worldly kingdoms are going to end but at the end of those kingdoms there's another kingdom coming amen so seeing the world falling apart but it's just now the time the Christian has been waiting on for 6,000 years the kingdom of God is coming into Power into the Earth in the last day you may be out of place here now amen but in a few years amen there'll be Thrones set up in this world and the Believers will be sitting on that Throne I'm one believer that believes in a millennium I believe that Jesus Christ will rule this world for a thousand years to show that that devil you cursed them in the garden but I brought them back to the same Earth and I've gave them life and they're going to outlive your curse and they'll be a thousand years old oh glory be to God Amen God has an answer for everything the devil could throw at you amen now we're seeing amen that the scriptures is going to set the time now now I think it's powerful that when you can see the exact moment that you're living and you can do it without a Shadow of Doubt so you can prepare yourself for what's coming to you now now if you if you're a Bible student you know Jesus said amen when the Fig Tree put forth her buds no the time is nine brother Ram tells us tell time church he said tell it by Israel right when the Fig Tree put forth your buds now that fig tree put forth her buds in 1947 amen and there was a flag that flew amen over Israel I seen it picture of it in the plane amen begin to fly over brother R said I'm stand in the cave same hour the the angel came to me Israel become a nation the flag flew for the first time somebody said well the flag never flew for a year later but somebody sent me a picture the other day and there's a plane flying over Israel flying the Sixpoint Star of David Amen in 1946 amen what is it God don't miss nothing amen he amen before it was a nation it was a nation in a back room somewhere somebody already drawled it out and said what's about to happen amen man gets caught up later and my we think think we're so smart and got it all figured out but listen we just ain't got there yet when you think a prophet's wrong keep studying you just ain't got there yet it's the truth now now notice because we're at a certain point in time we can tell the time Rome and Israel look what's happening Israel's in this nation and I don't think anybody could argue that it's already speaking its own language got its own government got its own military the scriptures are are are literally living out there and people say well brother Wayne then armageddon's got to be right on us but look there's supposed to be a bride that raptures before the Armageddon so if armageddon's on top of us how close is a Rapture in the church if you think the end of the world is on us then the Rapture has got to be taking place right now it's my when you start seeing the the the very specific time that God said you can see the hand strike the clock see prophecy being fulfilled in Daniel chapter 2 we can pick it up this was projected amen thousands of years ago as going to be 10 toes to the image of the Gentile see the Gentile image would be the times of the Gentiles so at the end of the Gentile kingdoms it would be 10 Toes that would run into the Earth and that iron and Clay would run that iron would run into every nation now watch this the scripture says very clearly that there was 10 toes and the iron would run in the Bible says here in the Book of Daniel it said that they shall try to mingle with the seed of man now when brother Ram picks that up he said see mingle with a with with the seed of man do y'all realize that just a few hundred years ago the worst thing for a Protestant to do was to marry into a Catholic home or for a Catholic to marry a Protestant but here in the end now watch watch how the in Maring begin to take place and we're all the same so all of a sudden in the 1960s you see a civil rights movement remember that now everybody just thinks it's about race and civil rights and all of that brother BR said but watch if you could just see what's behind it he said Martin Luther King's being used by the Catholic Church to swing the black vote from Lincoln's party of Republic into the Democratic vote he said so they can put a Catholic president in America now look that iron was going to run right into our president's office isn't that something brother B said you think it's something when you get Kennedy here as a president he said you wait till they worm their way into the cabinet you wait till they worm their way that iron is right now whether y'all know it or not we're back again with a Catholic President amen whether you stopped and thought about it right now I think what is there nine justices on our Supreme Court seven of them are the Roman Catholic church are that meant they're not going to take control they're in control the highest office in the land is controlled by the iron that run from the Roman Empire it's run into our nation and took our politics it's joined itself together amen now it's not exercising its power at this moment but you give it a few days and they it's already set up to take place amen I'm not a crazy man it's written right here in the Bible that it'll run and it has run it's run into the toes now now if you if you study your scripture it said it'll mingle and watch how they mingled and married in and now they broke down brother B said they broke it down to break the power of the Protestant church so they brought the Catholics in married them in and broke down the Protestant church now I'll just give you one quick thing you can just take this and think about this on your way home today do you recognize that one of the number one conservative news stations is Fox News one of the number one uh news station contributors is Sean Hannity how many knows he's a Catholic then the conservative voice in America has become Catholic people are leaning on the Catholic church for conservative ideas can you imagine when we have went to the Harlot system to become conservative it's the only fight against homosexuality it's the only one standing against abortion are you seeing it now the Protestant churches are joining together to bring strength strengthen the political Realms so that they can overcome it look where we're setting friends we're right Amen to the toes of Nebuchadnezzar's dream standing right there in that hour now now you might think some whether way you're taking this too far but let me let me take you back in the scripture in 1960 when a prophet of God began to say watch now he said there is five toes on those feet East and West Rome he said from the West watch in brother Ram's time 1960 you can go look at in the history books amen there's a great big conference that happens amen and there is a five from the East and five from the West now who would have ever knew the burlam wall would be put up 1945 separating the East and West into communism and to the social governments amen but the scriptures amen tell us how that the iron and Clay would mix and they would be on toes and brother B said to every foot is a big toe he said so has this one got a big toe and in that conference he said two big toes one representing the east one the West was Eisenhower and Koff you can go read the history on it there they got they got Google pictures where kof he gets mad in the middle of this meeting and reaches and pulls his shoe off and bangs it on the desk and brother man said look it up it means Kucha means clay amen it means clay I thought isn't that something it means clay and Eisenhower means iron he said and right there is two big toes on the on the feet of this image Amen in 1960 Now isn't it amazing to you it is to me that at the same time a word Prophet is on the age that there is a big toe showing up amen right there on that image amen listen if a prophet hadn't been here we would have never recognized it we would have never identified that conference with the big toes of this image but because there was a prophet there a Prophet is announcing we are at the time of judgment we're at the hour when God will tear down this entire Babylonian Kingdom my when brother branam reads that he says it like this in the uncertain sound in 1961 he took off his shoe and beat it on the desk now I don't know if any of you have ever amen if if you're like me just s and thought about this a minute but why not his fist why not his head why not his coat why not why not a stick why did he take his shoe off amen but brother random says it fulfills exactly what was prophesied amen we can think about that how that Daniel was seeing that far ahead of time amen that God was showing in symbol that he would beat that right there and show that the that the feet of Nebuchadnezzar's dream is upon the earth now you say preacher why does that matter so much because the streak runs into every nation in other words the Catholic church has two churches it has a Protestant and it has a Catholic Rome has two churches everybody thinks if I'm Protestant I'm against the Roman church but the Protestant denomination is the same system as the Roman Church and since they couldn't make you a Roman they gave the same system under another name and you join up with that system but the Bible said that there would come one in the last days who would pull the scheme off of the whole thing and a light would be shined upon it as the church would see the the Judgment that's falling upon the Earth we are not the children of Darkness we are the children of light and we see the devil we see the schem that has been placed upon him we are not here blind this morning we are not staggering in the blindness of leard deia wondering what's happening and who's going to rule I don't know who will be the next president of America but I know who will be the next king of the world it'll be Jesus Christ the son of God and the bride is already believing him they're already his church my the Christ has already come into her he's already ruling right now in the Church of the Living God brother B said there's three curtains now an iron curtain a bamboo curtain and a purple curtain you seen the Iron Curtain in Rome you see the B bamboo curtain in China hey man look all eyes are on China right now right watch that communism watch that China watch it everybody in America watch China and and right in our own political system Rome has took over do you see it we took our eyes off of the purple curtain and looked at the other curtains but brother said the purple curtain is the one that's going to bring the persecution sure look at what happens but in the days in the days watch brother bam prophesy the 70th week of Daniel 1961 but in the days of these Empires the rock that was HED out of the mountain will hit the image in the feet now watch him he shows you perfectly that eisenh and Kucha are the big toes of that image and he said in the hour of these rulers he said the stone will be hewed out of the mountain to hit the feet do you see what he's saying they are the rulers in the feet but I'm representing the stone that's coming out of the mountain come on Church those those those big toes was not big toes they were men representing a power of a kingdom and here's a prophet on the earth at the same time glory to God Amen and he's not a stone but he's a prophet representing the coming kingdom of God he's forerunning the Millennium of the [Applause] church I know that Kingdom's at it's end but our kingdom is coming my I feel so much power in me Hallelujah there's a kingdom that's coming every Kingdom will fall every denomination will fall Rome will fall Protestant will fall but there is a bride who cannot fall she has received the grace of God in the age she's living in what an hour to live what a time to live [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] I sat there the study yesterday and something just swept through I said God how true it's so absolutely true it's so definitively true it's so powerfully true it'll destroy Every Lie it'll destroy every scheme it'll uncover every demonic power and bring this church into power in that hour the image the image will receive a blow from the stone my so way I ain't seen no Stones around well let's dig in a little 70th week of Daniel brother Ram says you don't need to miss this paragraph 133 look it up don't miss this listen close don't miss this and he begins then to talk about the church ages what does the church ages have to do with the stone that Daniel saw hitting the image brother bam then begins to build it from the Luther's age to the Pentecostal age of the baptism he said see remember it's shaping into the stone do do you actually have that pyramid is it able to pull it up the pyramid pitcher I don't know if he's able to do it I it just sprung it on him but brother random talks about this and he talks about a pyramid to the church now now it's another image right not the image of Daniel he's talking about now we're talking about the image of the church and we're going to start it in second Peter 1 and we're going to build it from Faith unto love it's powerful isn't it build it from Faith to love how many knows what the Capstone in second Peter was was love right if you if you look at Faith Temperance knowledge any virtue all of those things none of them did God ever say I am am faith I am knowledge but when it come to love amen he said God is love is that right then Paul tells us that charity is the Capstone of every life are you hearing me it was after the seals are preached it was capped off by token by the literal life of Jesus Christ because it was all put in there now if you look at that right there build that up from Faith all the way to brotherly kindness which allowed to see an age represented amen but now I I don't want to shock you but I want you to know there's something Beyond just allowed Us in age which is the bride of Christ it's a New Jerusalem read Revelation 21 and see if she don't come down out of Heaven she don't come up from the Earth but the Bible said that there was a pyramid-shaped mountain that rules over there Amen in in Mount olives divides and a mountain comes up in the pyramid shape but the city comes down from heaven which is the New Jerusalem but there is a spiritual type come on now I just brought put out a disclaimer s case somebody reads this or listens to this thanks I'm crazy let me ask you this why do we call it Le oysa there's no City here called leysia amen there's no City Ephesians and Paul in this generation or leysa or Philadelphia it wasn't because of the city it was the spirit of the city that was living in the people so you're allowed to see it by a spirit and there's allowed to see a real City that's over there in Asia is that right amen and so is there a real city of the New Jerusalem amen it'll be an eighth day but so is there a people with the spirit of New Jerusalem that's alive today and here Christ is ruling in that City no not the Bible said and there's no need of a light there's no need of a sun or a moon for the lamb is the light of that City and think about who's the light of the Church of the Living God Jesus Christ Christ is our [Applause] light by the way there's nothing Beyond it now brother brandom said there was in Revelation chapter three the Bible said that Christ was on the outside so there's loud to see in church and then there's Christ you want to see it in the plant it's easiest there's a shuck and then there's a seed Perfection comes you know Perfection has come when the seed leaves the shook then the seed is beyond the three stages of of of of what you're trying to get to you're getting to all of it you don't have a stage you have it all come on now let's just get clear baptism of the Holy Ghost ain't as far as it goes now but baptism makes a way come on I know some don't like it but it's what a prophet said it made a way for the Holy Ghost himself is it predicted in Scripture that Christ himself would come orock is it not written in first Thessalonians 4 the Lord himself would descend from heaven is it not written in John 14 yet a little while and the world see me no more but you shall see me I will be with you even in You Until the End of the Age my we ought to be able to climb on Every Mountain this morning and say this day this scripture is fulfilled in our midst God has made himself real in the Church of the Living God we're not here guessing what's about happening we see the Nebuchadnezzar's image but I'm not blind I see the stone that's shed out of the mountain keep watching till you can see it the Bible said Daniel watch till he saw that stone don't quit looking don't stop looking keep watching come on come on guys go look again go look again I don't see it brother Wayne look again it's there look again the prophecy said a former and lighter rain shall come in the last day you quit looking too quick and you put it off to another age but if you'll go look again he said I seen a cloud the size of a man's hand I believe there's a church today that has seen a cloud in the sky and we have noticed what it was well if there's a question don't just come out I'll be glad to give you scripture now remember the headstone goodby back to that picture The Headstone now you I I won't teach the whole thing I just want to bring it to your mind that pyramids you're looking at from some second Peter chapter 1 look on the left side look on the right side isn't it beautiful it's represented in two different ways look at that image back there two different ways same thing so different prophecies can speak of the same thing I think that's a real lesson we should take in our heart different prophecies but speaking of the same thing now watch what he's doing when that when that comes there brother R takes this pyramid goes back to Egypt when Enoch left a sign right he left a sign brother said Enoch's sign amen is answered in the future home book remember and showed the pyramid now the pyramid never was capped brother Bram comes back and preaches and shows the pyram was never CA when Jesus came because he was rejected is that right in the days of Jesus Christ how many knows he was the rejected headstone amen he was The Headstone now watch brother Brandon will tell this now the rejected Stone in the pyramid seventh week 70 week of Daniel you I think you got the quote let's go to paragraph 135 amen now we're going to skip a little bit I'm going reading and Skip so you'll have to just follow me but remember the headstone wasn't on yet they shaped the church exactly the pyramid to fit in the headstone The Headstone never did come now the ministry of Luther to the end of Pentecost a little bit of minority and the reason the light almost goes out in the age it's the Pentecostal age the Pentecostal denominations they do just like the leot Deans they are leot Deans so if you looking for Le oysa it's Pentecost now they did like nicians but they true church all over the world has been shaped down to the place that there's a Ministry among them that's exactly like the ministry of Jesus Christ now now they got the thing of the condition what is it the next thing the rejected Stone to the pyramid the cutting out of the mountain without hands see do you see it the rejected one the rejected stone is the head he is the Capstone the very one that is rejected to the Gentile age is Christ and Christ was cut and put in here zra the Son of God some great dignitary in the church he's the Holy Spirit and the cap of the pyramid will be the coming of Christ now because it's in the shape I got this shape like a pyramid the arising Saints makes the March into Glory understand Christ The Headstone rejected Stone the all see and eye Daniel said watch the Gentile age until the Stone come out of the mountain that wasn't cut with hands they never put a Capstone on that pyramid it wasn't cut by man's hand it's God's hands cut the stone you see it hit the image smacked it in the feet broke it to Pieces grounded in powder what happened at that time the coming of that stone up went the church into the glory the Rapture so the coming of the stone and the Rapture in the church are now paralleling look what he's saying it's at the ending of the Gentile dispensation the coming of that stone now think of this brother Bram has just tied together your Capstone to the Pyramid of second Peter with the stone of Daniel 2 that's hitting the feet of Nebuchadnezzar's image so the stone that you're accepting as the capping of your life is the stone that destroys the image of Nebuchadnezzar now think about that just a minute what you are praying to come is the thing that's going to destroy Nations now now look at this it destroys everything that doesn't belong to God just like you as an individual when this message came into your life you remember the trinitarian doctrine in one time of hearing this message it broke it to Pieces is that right look at you look at how you run up against that stone and you broke off of your Li trinitarian doctrines you broke off false baptism and and denominational thinking of every kind you broke it right off of you because if you want to think right bring your thinking to the message of the hour it's the headstone to the church it'll break it off amen it'll bring it into rights and it'll it'll straighten up the way you see things now I I think that Christ is the stone now I thought it was amazing yesterday I was sitting there reading that brother B was talking about that stone coming and crushing the whole earth and middle of him saying he said oh Church flee to the stone and I thought wait a minute the judgments are coming and we're fleeing to it we are fleeing to the thing that is bringing judgment think about it what's bringing judgment to the world is bringing Vindication to the church the judge is not putting you under judgment he's putting you under a pardon because a lawyer can't pardon you a cop can't pardon you but it takes a judge to bring a pardon and until the judge until the headstone come that could not be a true pardon of the church because then a prophet look what he does he said you never did it in the first place where was the first place it was in the mind of God and somebody had to bring the mind of God to the Earth which brought back your original identity The Headstone which is the Holy Ghost which is Christ amen now he's saying flee to that now it looks like judgment looks like judgment to the world but you remember in the first when Babylonian fell to the mes and Persians you remember what was happening in that very moment when they were following Sirius the King of Persia was moving in same time and under the prophecy of Daniel the children of Israel would return to Jerusalem and they would rebuild the Tabernacle of worship in Jerusalem at the same time of the fall of one Kingdom was Israel's Deliverance to rebuild their Tabernacle so in Zechariah 4 it said that when zerubabel shall come he shall come forth with a headstone crying Grace Grace now look it was a judgment to Babylon mes and Persians broke down their rule but it released Israel to true worship they had been waiting 70 years to return and to worship under a finished Tabernacle and to think this morning the Church of the Living God has been going 2,000 years of the church looking for God to restore to the church an original worship now I tell you this a lot of people think a lot of things about worship but this message restores true worship cuz you can't really worship god Till You Know Who You Are you can't really worship till you know who you are if you're just a if you're just a visitor you're going to worship one way you come to my house as a visitor you're going to come in the door a certain way you come in as my son it'll be a different way but you come in as my wife it'll be a whole different way and if you know who you are in the house it brings a certain measure of worship come on Church he's not announced that you're just a church you're not just a bunch of flirters but he's brought you into the third room this is the Bride of Jesus Christ restored worship has returned to the house of God Amen I tell tell you this you don't come to my house and get on to my wife for praising me are you hearing me amen don't you ever if my wife if she was doing it and she was talking about how wonderful I was don't you ever stop her and don't you ever try to stop the Church of the Living God from telling about the glory of their God and the power of their Christ let me tell you he's the king of all Kings he's the Lord of all ain't nobody like my Jesus [Applause] [Music] restored worship restored worship has begun it's put it back in its order it's placed it back zerubba coming with a headstone crying Grace Grace so the Judgment of the world and you're crying Grace the stone that destroys the world is your rescue it's your Liberty it's your husband now you all know brother B said this hour is coming to be in come on now he said why this Prophet have to come so you'd know your mate the revealed word of the hour so he was talking about a coming in the word not in his physical body which is in the future is that true when you doing away with the physical body oh no we're going to see that in the Rapture then we're going to come back with him in the Millennium but there's a bump of people living here today that'll never see that till out white Throne judgment Bible said rest the Dead live not for a thousand years now notice this because brother Bram will tie this to Revelation 3 and14 the 7th Angel which is also Elijah of Malachi 4 he'll come crying Grace Grace in Revelations 5 different prophecies same Ministry Revelations 5 you'll see that he's the Elder that said somebody here that is worthy must take the book when it actually happens in 196 63 in March brother bandam standing on the platform the message called the breach he said let him come forward now or forever hold his peace in other words the ministry that is to introduce him is here the introducer standing on the platform now let him come forward now when he come forward it wasn't a man Jesus the nails guard man come walking out on the platform right but it was the revelation of the word of the age they were Liv in and a prophet introduced you to a true Revelation come on now it's the truth he began to reveal it in a true Revelation which fulfilled the scripture brother Braham said when I seen those Mysteries unfolding I cried Grace Grace bringing the grace to the church for a Rapture it was the thing that called you out of Babylon think about it Revelations 18 and4 a great Angel come from heaven and lighted the Earth with his glory he brought a light and said Babylon is falling is falling Babylon ain't fail but Babylon is falling is falling he's announcing the fall of Babylon and he's telling the church come out of her my people come on now 1960 went beyond the curtain of time Millions come running brother M this who is these people they're your people they're your people those people in that sixth Dimension was his people he called them out of Babylon and brought him into the Rock Revelations 18 and4 come out over my people and be not partakers of her fornications the city was going to burn the systems are going to be destroyed this is the same Angel you like prophecy Revelations 14 same angel now I think it's the ninth verse he's the third angel in that verse and said you cannot worship the image of the Beast and God at the same time so you cannot be in a denominational system and worship God you're worshiping the devil but you don't know it people people get to say well well Wayne it ain't too bad it's just a nice church it's this and this listen that's the iron of Rome running in a Protestant church trying to put people's names upon their book which is receiving the mark of the beast William brandom spent an entire service one time comes toward the end and says listen now denomination is the mark of the beast he said now that's what I come to say call the prayer line I come to say denomination is the mark of the beast it's not a chip in your hand it's not a tattoo on your forehead come on church it's not your social security card it's not Y2K are you hearing me amen it's not the vaccines that's the same Devil he's been I'm old enough now you young people I'm old enough and brother Ray amen no telling how many schemes he's heard but when the S security card come that was it when the first debit card started coming that that was it amen when the first GPS has come that's it when Y2K that's it it was always been the mark of the beast and I don't blame the devil for promoting his lies because all the while he's lying to the world he's hiding under religion and he's ruling through religion in the churches they're worshiping the devil and don't know it the vaccine is not the mark of the beast religion is the mark of the beast it falls at the same time the mark of the beast and the Seal of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost seals the church come on Church seals you into God but the mark of the beast is denying the Seal of God Amen you cannot receive the mark of the beast if you have received the Holy ghost Hallelujah come on [Applause] Church you can't do it if you receive the Holy Ghost you're sealed already said preacher what are you saying let me tell you what brother random said he said who can make war with her Revelation 17 who can make war with her he said because he the pope has influence with everybody who could make war with them he said now watch this he said the reason they have a world system is because of denominational preachers he said they have give that thing Power by their denominational teaching can you imagine amen a Catholic Church holding power over you with a message preacher you take a message preacher and put in the denomination they'll throw him out or throw the denomination out and if they all get along he ain't a message preacher if you can get along with denomination you're not a message preacher you're not a message belie said brother Wayne we are to love everybody we are to love everybody but the Bible said come out of her and be not partakers of her fornication don't you realize judgment is falling on that thing brother Wayne it won't hurt me nothing it won't the anointing of that unbelief has gotten me questioning whether brother R's even a prophet because they lost their nerve to say William brandom in front of a crowd because the devil dumbed them down twisted their arm you're going to lose the church you're going to lose your ministry well listen if this message makes a man lose his ministry he didn't have a Ministry to start with but if God gives a man a Ministry he said I'm the Lord that plth and I'll Water it day and night let some man Puck it out of my hand we don't need a denominational system as a Ministry of the sons of God what we need is a church full of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll amen the word of God and we'll take down every statue and every image the devil has put up against the presence of God now brother man come along and said my Ministry is different I am here to declare him and he is here how many times you ever heard brother B say I can't be him but he's here who who is he who's he the spirit of truth of John 16 come on Church there's not three Gods The Headstone is the Holy Ghost the person of Christ who comes as the word in Revelations 19 hold on to your seats there's a sword coming out of the mouth of a white horse rider in the last day it is the word of God I know a lot of people a lot of people think well brother Wayne there's coming this great Millennium brother our lord Jesus is going to ride out of heaven with all these horses and they're going to tear down the kingdoms of the world and all listen Study Bible Study Bible prophecy just a few minutes and go to the Armageddon and see who's going to destroy the world look at Armageddon see who's going to destroy the world they destroy themselves with Adam bombs you know it's true they're going to burn themselves with Adam bombs in Gog and MOG God's going to burn the whole world with a brimstone and fire but in this one God doesn't destroy them personally they destroy themselves because they've rejected the word and can't stand the word has pulled the foundations and their confusion comes and they kill one another well that's the scripture now his ministry is different so headship is here The Headstone is here now watch what it is it's identified in the scripture now that stone there's only one thing left to strike it's that stone now I think we could say it clearly the stone then is not granite it's a person a person now you brother Wayne a rock is a person sure in SEC 1 Peter chapter 2 in verse four he's coming under a Lively Stone disallowed of men but chosen of God precious yet a Lively Stone build up a spiritual house a holy priesthood spiritual sacrifice accepted by God wherefore also contained in the scripture behold I lay and Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto therefore that believe he is precious but unto them that are disobedient the stone that the builders rejected the same as made the head it's the same person and stone of stumbling a rock of offense even to them which stumbl at the word being disobedient unto which they were appointed so he is a person a living Stone you believe it was a spiritual Rock in 1 Corinthians chapter 10 and verse4 and they drank of the same spiritual drink and they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them which was Christ Jesus he was a rock in the wilderness do y'all know brother ramam said that was before the Masterpiece was made out of that rock in the Book of Luke the 20th chapter Jesus's own words beheld them what is this then that has written the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner whosoever shall fall on that stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it shall grind it powder I don't know exactly the translation of that word fall upon or fall on but I would think it would be pretty pretty easy to say that if you want to break Spirits off of you fall on that stone if you want to be broken let the stone fall on you amen now in Acts chapter 4 the Bible says again be it known unto you all Israel the name of Jesus Christ you have crucified him God has raised the Dead who stand before you hold this is the stone which is set at not of your Builders which is become the head of the corner neither is there any salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven whereby we must be saved there's only one name that represents that stone spiritual Stone headstone rejected Stone Christ now notice this because this brings very current to us we're going to close very soon Romans the 9th chapter watch the scripture wherefore because thou sought it not by faith but as the were the works of the law they stumbled at The Stumbling Stone as it is written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling Stone a rock of offense and whosoever believeth upon Him shall not be ashamed now that's a that's a powerful reading amen but bring that to the message of the hour then because in 1962 I read to you just the other Thursday night S as this a sign how many remembers it it was six dreams and then a vision the vision brother bam was having was of them seven angels coming to him is that right he said and I prayed Lord what does this vision mean to me me he said then the spirit struck me and I came to myself reading the Bible in the corner wonder what Bible verse brother Bram was reading compared to that vision of them Angels coming to him he meant and S say this a sign brother brandham says I came to myself I found myself over in the corner and I could hear my wife trying to shake the door and in the bedroom was locked I had a Bible open it was reading I don't know but it was in I believe Romans the 9th chapter the last verse behold I lay and Zion a Cornerstone a stone of stumbling a precious stone whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed so the seals coming to a prophet he's identifying As Romans the 9th chapter now think of this because Christ has always been that stone but it doesn't say that stone would come and hit it in the head it said the stone would hit it in the feet so at the time of those emper then the stone would strike those feet and it would hit there that stone would be the rock or the revelation of Christ that would come into that age now if you just leave it as a stone that's pretty interesting but if you go to Daniel the 7th chapter we don't have time to read all this but you can read it when you get home we'll probably continue on it later but in Daniel the 7th chapter if you like a reading you'll find out this that Daniel sees the same thing in Daniel 7 but when he sees the destruction of these Beast he doesn't see it as a stone he sees it as one called the Ancient of Days now look at this in Daniel 7 watch now the beasts that are there represent perfectly the kingdoms of the world the same as the image so you can see Rome and you can see Greece and you can see Babylon you can see image and Beast image and Beast image and Beast Daniel 7 right anden but watch now the same thing is with the stone that strikes the toes also can be seen in Daniel 7 but he seen as the Ancient of Days how many knows the Bible said and when the son of man come to the ancient of days I remember when I first read that I thought there was two of them for sure I thought well the two Lord people got it right I I just messed it up the son of man comes to the ancient days that's why the world teaches it the son of man comes to the ancient days that's when that he stands up for the people when the Ancient of Days but you know when I was studying this God has a simple way to show simple people I was sitting in my living room reading this and Zach went walking across the floor and he was about I don't know maybe 13 14 year old and it was like a a voice said to me he wasn't always that size but I watched that boy move from a child to a man you've seen the transition from a young man to a father but he's the same person and you see the son of man will move to the Ancient of Days you will see he will move from a prophetic Ministry and start moving into the Judgment now now you may think that I'm crazy here and you say well brother Wayne what does this do have to do with the message of the hour we go read thinking man's fure Amen in 1965 brother bandam ties the ancient of the days with a one like wool to Revelations the first chapter when John sees one with a hair like wool and eyes like fire do you have a picture there Amen brother random tells us that this picture that was taken in Tucson in 1963 is what John was seeing in Revelations the first chapter when he said hair like wool and eyes like fire amen it was the judgment seven symbols of judgment that was coming upon the earth now Revelation one shows the seven symbols of judgment and when John seen him coming in judgment when John seen him coming in judgment remember the Bible said he fell on his face as dead but then he lifted a right hand to him and said fear not John I am he that was dead and am alive forever more so that was an evening time resurrection that brought judgment upon the Earth but when he looked at John brother said look at this picture good because the light is striking him and he is facing to the right side just like he did at Calvary when there was a thief on his left and there was a thief on his right he said he looked to the right to Pardon The Sinner he pardoned him and I tell you brother you you ain't you ain't felt a shock till you read what brother Bram said about that he said that sinner on the right that thief on the right hanging there he said God had never even crossed that boy's mind one time never crossed his mind until that moment and in that moment there was such power hanging before him that one word would give him eternal life you talk about the grace of God when the last one come in it was at an hour of judgment with full pardon and he didn't do nothing but receive what had come and the Church of the Living God has saw the Ancient of Days who has come from glory to reveal the word of God listen you might have been harlots and denominational fers and bartenders and every kind of dope smoker every kind of worldly event in your life but there was a stone come rolling out of the mountain and it struck your life and every Kingdom begin to fall and every devil begin to be destroyed what was happening the Ancient of Days was passing judgment passing judgment over your life you're suppos I don't want to go in judgment judgment is wonderful amen if you've been accused and you're not guilty a judge is beautiful if you've been accused of a crime and you're not guilty only a judge can send you home free and here is the Judgment of Christ coming to announce to a bride you are free from denomination you are free from your memberships you are free from your sin you are free from the ungodliness at this world come this is a harded from a judge destroys every image destroys every devil what is it it's a coming one who is striking this image you said but wa I need some scriptures okay 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 6 and 7 come on he shall reveal amen the son of predition in his time is that right amen how many knows what time it is when he reveals the son of predition when the first seal was opened he revealed the devil as a liar from the beginning amen and the devil's lied on you and every lie he ever told on you God has a truth to destroy it what destroys the LIE is the truth oh God you let anybody lie on you all they want to but the truth the truth Vindicated will destroy every lie and that's exactly what's happening amen the Bible said in 2 Thessalonians he would destroy him with the brightness of his coming can you imagine a bright light that kills every dark idea that kills every dark spirit that brings the light and it literally scatters every Darkness think about it when that stone hit that image it's scattered you put a good sharp light on a dark night and every ounce of the darkness is broken and Scattered and it flees let me tell you we're at the rising of the sun when Christ has come upon the Earth and darkness has shattered and Christ is coming into power so brother Wayne I don't know I don't hardly see how I don't hardly see how that we're able to defeat this this system and this devil is taking over the whole world you know what's amazing to me is when you read Revelation the 13th chapter it's telling about this same Beast Daniel seas and Daniel 7 Daniel sees it in four parts is that right he sees it in four different images but when when when John sees it in Revelations 13 read it and it said I saw a beast coming out of the sea and it's every image that Daniel saw in those creatures all four of them in one body all the powers of Hell into that one and Paul and and Daniel said I saw it crawling out of the sea brother BR said that sea was multitudes of people he said that is the Beast the Roman Church and he said we thought it was dead it was dying back there in Europe split right but but Constantine breathed life back into it now you want to read it in scripture the third chapter I saw one of the heads as it was wounded unto death and the deadly Loom was healed and the whole world wondered after it the whole world looking for it wondering after it now think about this a minute but right in the middle of the whole world wondering after it and looking at it it's written right here but except for them who have their names written on the Lamb's will go life right in the middle of it there's an open book right in the middle of it he brings up the Lamb's Book now the next verse you you can see America in here right you can see it it says that there was a beast that rose up out out of the land it's America looked like a lamb it took on Horns right brother Bram said see we fled persecution coming into America in this Wilderness he said but watch how it chased us over Revelation 12 how it chased us over and now that iron is running in political systems so now you have both land and you have sea but according to Daniel he saw an Ancient of Days coming in Revelation 10 and verse one what's it say I said I saw another Mighty angel coming down out of heaven and brother Richard it says he put his foot on land and he put his foot on sea he put and subdued every Kingdom amen of Rome that it could be built now look where we're standing here this morning church we're standing here before a message that can destroy every devil amen the ones that come out of the sea the ones that come out of the land whatever system that it comes out of this message has an answer to destroy to bring it under submission you're sitting here this morning you're actually representing another kingdom Alto together and here you're setting this morning with a desire for that Kingdom and every kingdom is falling right now now there's not going to be coming another message right there's not coming another church there's not coming another message there's not coming another hour the Bible said he watched this until the stone Struck it and this Stone became a great mountain and become a kingdom That Couldn't end now isn't it amazing that this message turns into the Millennium this this Pillar of Fire that has come is going to lead you all the way into the Millennium and if You' like to read it this Bible says in Revelations 11: 15 the 7th Angel would come and bring a message and the Bible said his message would announce the kingdoms of this world had become the kingdoms of our god what will them Jewish prophets preach anyhow what will they preach this message and what this message done for you it'll by the way I prove it by scripture it'll do for them look where we're standing this morning amen there's something smiting the image right here destroying it with the brightness of his coming won't you stand to your feet this morning destroying it with the brightness of his coming wow what an hour to live in the Ancient of Days the ancient of days the stone rejected Stone but to you it's a stone where we hide it's our hiding place is what hid Moses and to think when there is no place to hide God sent us a hiding place he's showing it to Total world obliviation all the nations of the earth totally destroyed but there'll be a little Easter lily under the rock oh aren't you glad that that rock I know I know it's judgment to the world but it's to free the church can you imagine if you'd never heard the truth and you in some little system wanting to serve God with all your heart and that iron of Rome had weeded its way down into their Doctrine and here you think that you're millions of miles from worshiping Rome and you're worshiping it right through the worshiping it right through the teachings well if you could worship Rome and you could worship the devil through teaching what about the words that come from a prophet if you can
