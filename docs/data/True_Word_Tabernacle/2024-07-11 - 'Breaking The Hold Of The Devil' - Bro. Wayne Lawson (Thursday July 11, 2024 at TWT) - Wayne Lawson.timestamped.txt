[37:39] Lord may you have honor and Glory

[37:48] Christ amen and amen amen what a
[37:53] blessing Amen to come to the house of
[37:56] God on a Thursday night in such a
[37:58] powerful presence amen how many can feel
[38:01] and sense the presence of the Living God
[38:04] Amen we thank God Amen that there's such
[38:07] a place amen that you can just come to
[38:10] steal a way in his presence and his
[38:12] mercy and we want to thank you for your
[38:14] attendance here tonight and I I I know
[38:17] there's many that can't come and I just
[38:19] want to say God bless them and we pray
[38:21] that maybe tonight they would be able to
[38:24] uh view on the line we pray the Holy
[38:26] Spirit to be there ministering in those
[38:28] places wherever his word is heard amen
[38:31] and amen tonight if you would while
[38:34] you're standing let's go into the
[38:36] scripture here for a moment I have some
[38:39] things up on our heart the book of
[38:40] Ephesians the 6th
[38:42] chapter I want to read the 12th verse
[38:46] here Ephesians chapter
[38:49] 6 I want to read the 12th
[38:56] verse for we wrestle
[38:59] not against flesh and
[39:02] blood but against
[39:04] principalities against
[39:07] Powers against the rulers of Darkness of
[39:10] this
[39:11] world against spiritual
[39:14] wickedness in high places we ask the
[39:17] Lord to bless his word you may be seated
[39:21] tonight I want to speak to you for the
[39:24] next little bit here you know we've been
[39:26] on in Ephesians and Sy for a while uh
[39:28] but I want to speak to you here tonight
[39:30] from this section of scripture and if I
[39:32] would take a context tonight a title for
[39:34] this I'd like to talk to you about
[39:36] breaking the hold of the
[39:39] devil breaking the hold of the devil now
[39:44] I think it's important that we have
[39:47] viewed uh from the scripture we have saw
[39:50] amen that this is a great and a
[39:52] spiritual battle and I think we each one
[39:55] could testify to the reality of that
[39:58] tonight that it's a great and it's a
[40:00] spiritual battle now the prophet teaches
[40:04] us that in this scripture it says we
[40:06] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[40:09] against principalities and powers and
[40:10] rulers of Darkness of this world and
[40:13] spiritual and high places and this is
[40:15] why that brother brandham teaches the
[40:17] Ascension is such a powerful part of the
[40:20] scripture he's probably the most under
[40:21] preached part of scripture is the
[40:23] Ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ
[40:26] because he teaches us that Earth
[40:28] actually belongs to the devil from this
[40:29] scripture brother Bram says Earth
[40:31] belonged to the devil and through the
[40:34] fall the Earth was given to the devil
[40:36] and every Kingdom of the world is
[40:37] governed by the devil we have to we hate
[40:40] to think that but it's the Bible that's
[40:42] the reason we have wars and shootings
[40:45] and fighting and trouble is because the
[40:47] kingdoms of this world is the kingdoms
[40:49] of the devil and the Bible said so in
[40:52] the great Millennium to come the Bible
[40:53] said Rejoice all ye heavens and all the
[40:55] holy prophets of the Earth for the
[40:57] kingdoms of this Earth have become the
[40:59] kingdoms of our Lord and He Shall Rule
[41:00] and Reign forever now they will become
[41:03] we'll have no more war then when he
[41:05] comes no more sickness no more troubles
[41:08] notice this there's so little spoken of
[41:11] the Ascension but it's one of the
[41:13] greatest days when he ascended how many
[41:15] remember us teaching on the Ascension of
[41:16] Christ amen it's the day of the Garden
[41:19] of Eden that sin was committed All The
[41:21] Heavens was shut off from Mankind and
[41:24] Satan then became the prince of the
[41:26] power of the air and remember it says
[41:29] why thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer
[41:31] thou no man could see into Glory no man
[41:35] could understand because the power is
[41:37] just above it Heaven means atmosphere
[41:40] and all these Powers were shut off
[41:43] because of sin so the prophet teaches us
[41:46] that's how Satan come into the power of
[41:48] the heavenlies that's how he took
[41:50] control of the atmospheres was through
[41:52] the fall of Satan through the fall of
[41:54] sin but our lord Jesus of course after
[41:57] death burial and Resurrection took an
[41:59] Ascension and the prophet says and he
[42:01] broke through every Veil Amen to conquer
[42:04] every Power that he might be able to
[42:06] open a way for the children of God to
[42:09] get into a Heavenly atmosphere and of
[42:11] course Ephesians starts begins with amen
[42:14] and we are seated in Heavenly places in
[42:16] Christ Jesus now in putting on the whole
[42:20] armor brother bandam teaches us this
[42:22] that we're not wrestling then against
[42:24] Natural or scientific things we're
[42:26] wrestling against spiritual Powers right
[42:30] so tonight you're wrestling against
[42:32] spiritual powers and it's amazing
[42:34] because brother B takes it to the
[42:35] Natural wrestler and he says you know
[42:37] wrestlers they make a practice on
[42:39] breaking tow holes and things and if you
[42:41] ever watched any wrestling you know
[42:43] anything about wrestling or just ever
[42:45] fought as a kid somebody get you in a
[42:47] real hold and if you haven't trained to
[42:49] know how to break the hold they can get
[42:51] you in a hold till you submit and that's
[42:53] all that that's all there is to the
[42:54] fight but the prophet says see but the
[42:57] men doing knowing they wrestle they they
[43:00] train themselves how to break the holes
[43:02] that are put upon them he says see like
[43:05] toe holds and things he said but could
[43:06] you imagine now I thought this was funny
[43:09] could you imagine a wrestler come out
[43:11] now with his fingernails polished and
[43:14] his trunks on he said with gold beads
[43:16] around it he says maybe look like a
[43:18] pretty good wrestler but it would be all
[43:20] the intellectual he says he but if he
[43:23] hadn't got a hidden strength there now
[43:25] that when the enemy gets a hold hold on
[43:27] him then he can just pull him on uh pull
[43:30] him out of it you see his intellectual
[43:32] beads and everything won't make any
[43:34] difference see when he gets in the grip
[43:36] of the enemy won't make any difference
[43:37] all the intellectual he said so our
[43:40] intellectual means nothing unless
[43:42] there's a hidden power of the spirit
[43:44] there to break the hold of the devil see
[43:47] there's got to be a power to break the
[43:49] hold of the devil see but we are in a
[43:52] wrestling match but we're wrestling not
[43:55] with fine dressed intellectual iology
[43:58] we're wrestling with the power and the
[44:00] promises of God which can break any hold
[44:03] of the devil at any time I love that
[44:06] don't you if you're looking to break the
[44:08] hold of the devil tonight you're going
[44:10] to have to have the power of God to
[44:12] break the hold of the devil Jesus is our
[44:15] Lord and He proved it when he was
[44:17] Emmanuel God himself in the flesh when
[44:20] he met Satan he showed us how that Satan
[44:23] could be defeated by the word every time
[44:27] would come to him he'd just say it's
[44:28] written oh I'd like to take time here on
[44:31] some note I got he says how many times
[44:34] that he broke Satan's power with it is
[44:37] written showing that the Fortified
[44:40] person behind the word of God can scream
[44:43] out it's written turn loose I like that
[44:46] don't you it's written Satan turn loose
[44:49] amen a person that's fortified in that
[44:52] word knows that we're it's written
[44:54] you're standing on the word of God if
[44:57] you abide in me my word abide in you
[45:00] that's right see amen you can tell Satan
[45:02] turn loose it's written in the word of
[45:04] God and and he'll have to let go of you
[45:07] I I think it's a powerful thing tonight
[45:09] if you're going to wrestle with the
[45:10] devil you're going to have to know the
[45:12] power it is that breaks the hole that he
[45:14] has on you amen and and and we find that
[45:17] in the scripture that when you begin to
[45:19] fight in this battle that it was Paul
[45:21] that told us that we needed to take the
[45:23] sword of the spirit of God and and there
[45:26] is a but one spe one sword of the spirit
[45:29] of God and that's the word of God it's
[45:31] the only thing he uses to break the
[45:34] power of the devil it is the sword of
[45:36] the spirit you see what we find is that
[45:39] God is the one that would influence a
[45:41] Believer to pick up the sword and fight
[45:44] back against the devil see Satan is
[45:46] constantly telling people that you're in
[45:48] the hold of the devil and there's
[45:50] nothing can be done you're in a you're
[45:52] in a position that it is nothing could
[45:54] be done for your case there's no hope
[45:56] you in this situation for years and it's
[45:59] just a reoccurring thing and you've
[46:01] tried everything you believe amen and
[46:03] that would only be the devil to anoint
[46:05] you to unbelief but the anointing of God
[46:08] would anoint you to believe that the
[46:10] word of God could defeat Satan anywhere
[46:13] any place any time under any condition
[46:16] it would anoint you to pick your sword
[46:18] up and fight back I'll tell you tonight
[46:20] I do not believe that we are in a
[46:22] situation to surrender our faith amen I
[46:25] say this amen amen might get bombarded
[46:28] and that's fine but I will not surrender
[46:30] my faith in this revealed word to defeat
[46:33] Satan anywhere any place any time amen I
[46:36] will not surrender my faith and I will
[46:39] live in a in in an existence that's not
[46:41] bound by five senses where I have to
[46:44] obey what I think feel smell hear amen
[46:47] but I have a soul and that Soul believes
[46:50] the word of God and with that soul and
[46:53] that word I could break the hold of
[46:55] Satan anywhere any place anytime because
[46:58] we will not surrender this thought is
[47:01] not over we will not give up our arms we
[47:03] will not lay down and walk away amen we
[47:06] are warriors in the spirit of God can I
[47:09] say this tonight I I believe we were
[47:11] born for this
[47:12] season I believe we were built for this
[47:15] season I I don't believe we just
[47:17] stumbled into this time but I believe
[47:18] God has anointed you and ordained you
[47:21] and trained you for such a season and a
[47:24] time as this amen I tell you what a
[47:26] prophet of God said he said you're his
[47:28] victory he said you are his victory in
[47:31] other words I got one that's going to
[47:33] break the hold of Satan he will not be
[47:36] able to hold on to them now now I tell
[47:38] you this amen you cannot be here as a
[47:41] spiritual being and not be influenced by
[47:44] one of these
[47:46] Dimensions the prophet of God said
[47:48] whether you're a sinner or a saint
[47:49] you're getting influenced from one of
[47:51] the reals amen you cannot be here and be
[47:54] not influenced by one side or the other
[47:57] you're influenced amen either from God
[47:59] or you're influenced from the devil
[48:00] brother B actually went so far to say if
[48:02] you're influenced by the Lord he said
[48:05] your Celestial body is on that side amen
[48:08] and I say this amen if you're influenced
[48:10] of God Amen then God can deal with you
[48:13] and do you know God deals with you with
[48:15] angels I know people don't hardly
[48:17] believe in angels and I know there's
[48:19] been a lot of fanaticism around Angels
[48:21] but I'll say this very clearly Amen in
[48:23] the midst of all the fanaticism Angelic
[48:26] uh uh Association is
[48:28] real Angelic Association is real I know
[48:31] the devil has went has took that into
[48:33] the world and the world is making movies
[48:35] and they're making all kinds of things
[48:37] and they're trying their best Amen to
[48:39] devalue what God has done but God has
[48:42] given Angelic Association to Believers
[48:44] in this age amen matter of fact
[48:46] anointing them and the Bible calls them
[48:49] ministering Spirits they meant brother B
[48:52] says they speak to the people's hearts
[48:55] as a messenger or ministering Spirit
[48:58] sent from the presence of God in the
[49:00] message of influence brother bam said
[49:02] it's the holy ghost that leads the
[49:03] church that's true but ministering
[49:06] Spirits are sent from God as special
[49:09] gifts amen and and I it shall not it
[49:12] shall be as I have was told me brother B
[49:15] says God always had ministering Spirits
[49:17] I believe in them that's right I believe
[49:21] in ministering Spirits sent from the
[49:23] presence of God the Holy Spirit
[49:25] ministers lead the church
[49:27] he says guardian angels that watch over
[49:30] us amen and y'all know guardian angels
[49:33] are real right if you find it in the
[49:35] scriptures in the Book of Matthew the
[49:36] 18th chapter their Angels do always
[49:38] behold the face of My Father which is in
[49:40] heaven amen uh now brother Ram is
[49:43] associating your theophany with Angelic
[49:45] Association y y'all know that right amen
[49:48] he's he's associating a guarding angel
[49:50] with your theophany amen I I that's what
[49:53] brother random taught I don't know some
[49:54] people don't seem to believe that
[49:55] anymore but amen that's just what he
[49:57] said amen it's just the truth amen so
[50:00] Angelic Association in other words amen
[50:03] that there is ministering spirits and
[50:05] the angel of God Amen see has no more to
[50:08] do with me than the angel is has to do
[50:12] with you and if you don't believe in
[50:14] angels as ministering Spirits then you
[50:16] don't believe the
[50:18] Bible just take a few moments now
[50:20] brother bam said the new church had more
[50:23] Angels ministering than the Old
[50:25] Testament did that's right he said
[50:27] listen he said the Holy Ghost is over
[50:29] all that's the body it's true but
[50:31] there's also ministering spirits that
[50:34] are sent from the presence of God and we
[50:36] know Mary and all of those seen angels
[50:39] and we know the new church seen Angels
[50:42] is that right people say well they seen
[50:43] Angels many of you seen Angels you just
[50:45] didn't recognize what it was brother B
[50:48] said angels has has been ministering
[50:50] spirits to the church all through the
[50:52] apostolic age they had ministering
[50:55] spirits that went to the apostles and
[50:56] disciples that's right but most always
[50:58] it appeared to them in the form of a
[51:01] light amen it mostly appeared to them in
[51:04] the form of a light most of them didn't
[51:06] see a man they saw a light but it was a
[51:09] ministering Spirit it was the angel of
[51:11] the Lord amen of course amen God anoints
[51:15] his servants now in the greatest battle
[51:17] ever fought you can take a paragraph or
[51:19] two from paragraph 162 and brother man
[51:22] begins to talk about the anointing of
[51:24] his Spirit upon his angels upon his men
[51:27] and he says now if you want to see it in
[51:29] the Bible turn over to Hebrews chapter 4
[51:31] amen uh uh chapter uh the first chapter
[51:34] in the 14th verse he said Hebrews says
[51:37] that these are ministering Spirits sent
[51:39] from the from the presence of God Amen
[51:42] to The Heirs of the Salvation amen isn't
[51:45] it amazing that the angels in the Bible
[51:47] now I'm not going to preach on
[51:48] angelology I just want to mention this
[51:50] but angels in the Bible never appeared
[51:53] until Abraham's seed come into the Bible
[51:55] how many knows that the Angels never
[51:57] appeared to anyone until Abraham and the
[52:00] first one it appeared to was Abraham's
[52:02] uh uh uh concubine Hagar it was about
[52:04] the Seed of Abraham and that's why
[52:07] ministering Spirits appear because we
[52:09] are Heirs of the Salvation of God
[52:12] because you're an heir that's why
[52:14] ministering Spirits appear can I say
[52:16] this very clearly ministering Spirits do
[52:18] not appear to you for natural things
[52:21] they do not appear to you for carnal
[52:23] reasons but if ministering Spirits are
[52:25] anointing the the church is for
[52:27] Supernatural reasons that's right
[52:30] remember they appeared to marry she was
[52:31] about to have a baby without knowing a
[52:33] man they appeared to Samson he was about
[52:35] to take over amen the Philistine Kingdom
[52:38] amen they appeared unto many up Through
[52:40] the Ages as great Supernatural
[52:43] anointings were visit him like Gideon
[52:45] when he was going to destroy amen the
[52:47] whole the whole the whole bunch of the
[52:49] confusion and he was just going to do it
[52:51] with a few hundred men ministering
[52:53] Spirit sent from the presence of God see
[52:56] Angels anointed to bring you the word of
[52:59] God Amen to cause you to believe the
[53:03] word of God now I know sometimes you I
[53:06] got a lot here so I'll run quickly but
[53:07] I'll say this sometimes when you're
[53:09] sitting in a service and some people say
[53:11] well amen maybe you maybe you really
[53:13] didn't feel anything like you're
[53:15] thinking emotional but something settled
[53:18] in your heart and and you really said
[53:20] man I believe that's the truth do you
[53:22] know that's the presence of angelic
[53:25] Association do you know that settled
[53:27] thing that settles in your heart that
[53:29] says that's the truth that's Angelic
[53:32] Association that's God anointing to you
[53:35] what you're hearing is the truth is that
[53:38] right it's God revealing to you see what
[53:41] it is it's causing the word to be
[53:44] anointed how many's ever had a
[53:45] revelation in church you sitting there
[53:47] and the power of God is coming and aen
[53:50] we've Shook and we've spoken tongues and
[53:52] we've shouted we've enjoyed and those
[53:54] are blessings of God that come and I I
[53:56] do that a lot so I'm not speaking
[53:58] against that and please never do from
[53:59] this pull pit cuz we believe in that
[54:01] around here amen but there are times
[54:03] you're sitting in the service and it's
[54:05] just a preaching of the word opens up a
[54:07] Channel of Revelation to you and all of
[54:09] a sudden it's just like a preacher said
[54:12] something and a door opened and you just
[54:15] step into that door and it feels like
[54:17] it's just you and him for a few minutes
[54:19] and and all of a sudden the word is
[54:21] coming so powerful what is it it's
[54:23] Revelation and it's opening the door of
[54:26] our opportunity it's opening the door of
[54:28] Deliverance it's opening the door of
[54:30] healing because real Revelation is what
[54:33] defeats the devil that's what really
[54:37] defeats the devil is revelation
[54:38] Revelation is powerful church when you
[54:41] get a revelation of the word that is
[54:43] true it's the most powerful force on the
[54:46] earth is
[54:48] revelation Revelation see but Satan
[54:51] would get to the carnal mind if he could
[54:54] but the prophet of God says like this he
[54:57] says see now here's the thing he says no
[54:59] wonder the carnal mind doesn't know it
[55:02] because it's Satan in that carnal mind
[55:04] but Satan is exposed and he does not
[55:07] want himself exposed now what happens is
[55:11] whenever Revelation comes it exposes the
[55:14] devil you know I I I when I was a kid
[55:16] now I'm going to fess up right here but
[55:18] when I was a kid I played some cards
[55:19] with some old boys and they were some
[55:21] pretty big Bluffs that likes to play
[55:23] cards you know amen but the worst thing
[55:25] that could happen to somebody bluffing
[55:27] is you find out they ain't got
[55:29] nothing as long as you don't know what
[55:31] they're holding they can run a big Bluff
[55:33] and usually bluffers will bet more than
[55:36] somebody that don't have I won't preach
[55:37] to you about betting tonight but but but
[55:39] but it but it exposes something it it
[55:43] exposes you know it's like somebody
[55:44] running around they act like they're
[55:46] great big and all of a sudden something
[55:47] is exposed about them that that that
[55:49] takes the air right out of them see amen
[55:52] and the devil likes to play like he's
[55:54] big he likes to really put on like he's
[55:57] big he likes to really brag it out like
[55:59] he's a really big guy amen but the devil
[56:02] ain't nothing but a bluff amen and this
[56:05] word of God will expose that devil and
[56:08] let you know he ain't nothing but a
[56:10] bluff he has no he has no he has no
[56:14] power he has no power he has no ability
[56:18] it was taken from him at the cross and
[56:20] the prophet of God said that's why he
[56:23] hates those two books of the Bible real
[56:25] bad amen the prophet of God said see he
[56:28] attacks them now what's what he does
[56:29] have you ever noticed how Satan hates
[56:31] two books of this Bible more than others
[56:33] and through liberal theologians and
[56:36] pseudo scientist he's always attacking
[56:38] that book of Genesis and that book of
[56:41] Revelation so it's the devil attacking
[56:43] through education watch you send a kid
[56:46] to school and the first thing they
[56:47] attack is creative power and they and
[56:49] they w't send your kid back as if God
[56:51] didn't create the Earth or as if if if
[56:54] it really did if Noah didn't really
[56:55] build an Arc and save and amen they try
[56:58] to go through all kinds of ideas and all
[56:59] that what is it pseo scientist attacking
[57:03] amen the scripture because the Book of
[57:04] Genesis tells you the beginning of the
[57:06] Devil look if you can know the beginning
[57:09] of something and you can know the end of
[57:11] something then you lose your fear of
[57:13] what you're dealing with Satan we know
[57:16] where you come from we know where God
[57:18] cursed you we know when God threw you
[57:20] out of heavens and I can read in the
[57:23] back of this book what's going to happen
[57:24] to you in the end and he hates This Book
[57:27] of Revelation but it says that he is
[57:30] cast into the Lake of Fire amen after
[57:33] he's bound up for a thousand years so
[57:35] we're going to put him in change and
[57:37] then for a thousand years he'll be
[57:39] powerless on the Millennium but at the
[57:41] end of that a white Throne judgment amen
[57:43] I don't know about you but I want to be
[57:45] there I want to stand on the banks of
[57:47] that burning Lake and watch God cast
[57:50] that devil in the Lake of Fire and ever
[57:53] hurt and ever mean and evil thing that
[57:56] he's ever done to God's people amen
[57:58] there's a Payday coming at the end of
[58:00] the road that's all right devil you
[58:02] throw all you got at us right now but
[58:05] one day amen we're going to throw you in
[58:07] that Lake of Fire and our God will
[58:10] annihilate you and everything about you
[58:12] amen you're going to be finished but
[58:15] there's a bride setting here that is
[58:17] eternal as God is eternal and we'll set
[58:20] in eternity throughout eternity and talk
[58:23] about the glory and the power of Our
[58:26] Risen God our worship is not cheap we
[58:30] might go through some things but we will
[58:32] worship throughout
[58:34] eternity because he's our God and we
[58:37] know that devil and who he is and where
[58:39] he come
[58:41] from that's right he hates it and he
[58:44] attacks these two books that's right
[58:46] because it tells his origin how he's
[58:49] been his destruction and the way he
[58:51] attacks he hates to be
[58:54] exposed because this these books exposes
[58:57] what he is is't that
[59:00] something now Jesus told Satan you have
[59:03] no part and I have no part in you the
[59:05] devil would like to prove that different
[59:07] but he cannot he does all he can to
[59:10] destroy confidence in the word that's
[59:13] his tactic destroy confidence in the
[59:16] word but when the church disbelieves
[59:18] Satan and believes the spirit revelation
[59:21] of the word the Gates of Hell will never
[59:24] Prevail against her
[59:26] now brother B said let me bring it into
[59:29] my own Ministry if you don't mind you
[59:31] know the gift in my life is Supernatural
[59:33] and the gift whereby the holy spirit is
[59:35] able to discern diseases and the
[59:36] thoughts of men's heart and other hidden
[59:38] things that only God could know and then
[59:40] reveal to me and I wish I could stand I
[59:43] wish you could stand with me and see the
[59:46] faces of people when Satan knows he's
[59:48] going to be exposed Now isn't the people
[59:51] that I'm talking about it's Satan that's
[59:54] got a hold in their lives through sin
[59:56] and indifference and
[59:58] disease but you should see their faces
[1:00:00] when Satan knows he's going to be
[1:00:02] exposed the most peculiar changes come
[1:00:05] over people's countenances because Satan
[1:00:07] is
[1:00:08] afraid he knows that the spirit of God
[1:00:11] is about to let the people know of his
[1:00:13] works that's why he hates these meetings
[1:00:16] so
[1:00:18] much I guarantee he don't like these
[1:00:21] meetings I guarantee he don't like these
[1:00:23] meetings that pull the covers off of him
[1:00:26] when names are called and diseases are
[1:00:28] revealed Satan hates it what is it it's
[1:00:31] not mind reading it's not telepathy it's
[1:00:34] not witchcraft it's a revelation of the
[1:00:37] holy spirit amen now of course they'll
[1:00:40] call it everything to keep you from
[1:00:42] saying it's God Amen but it really is
[1:00:46] God now here's the thing is that when
[1:00:48] God reveals it by the Holy Ghost amen do
[1:00:52] y'all know there's not going to be
[1:00:53] another Calvary right right but this
[1:00:56] time Satan is defeated just like he was
[1:00:59] at Calvary but it's by Revelation that's
[1:01:02] why that the ministry of William
[1:01:05] brandham takes us back to the power of
[1:01:07] Calvary because it unfolds the mystery
[1:01:10] and exposes the demon for what he is and
[1:01:13] puts the Revelation back in the church
[1:01:16] and breaks the hold that Satan has on
[1:01:19] the People by his unbelief amen now
[1:01:23] watch this brother B says listen now
[1:01:25] Satan is trying to hold these people and
[1:01:28] the only way he could do it is by
[1:01:31] unbelief and I condemn unbelief Satan
[1:01:35] you've lost the battle you're exposed
[1:01:37] come out of this people now watch
[1:01:40] brother brandham he only his ministry
[1:01:44] was a Ministry in the realm of spirit
[1:01:48] brother Ram's Ministry was not a a
[1:01:50] Ministry in the realm of
[1:01:52] intellectual he wasn't he it wasn't it
[1:01:55] wasn't in the educated it wasn't in the
[1:01:57] society y'all all heard brother Bram
[1:02:00] talk about how when he stood one day
[1:02:02] waiting on a a building for his crowd to
[1:02:04] come in cuz another man was speaking and
[1:02:06] he said I stood there and waited and he
[1:02:08] said and when that man's crowd come out
[1:02:10] of the building he said it was high
[1:02:12] society and well dressed and everything
[1:02:15] was wonderful and well well just great
[1:02:18] people educated and the highest part of
[1:02:21] the society he said but then here come
[1:02:24] my people he said lame and blot and
[1:02:27] crippled and insane and sick and he said
[1:02:31] everything come in to my to my meetings
[1:02:35] now somebody said something one time
[1:02:37] they said well seemed like we got a lot
[1:02:38] of a lot of bad cases around the message
[1:02:41] of the hour you know and they were kind
[1:02:43] of throwing off on it and we were
[1:02:44] sitting at a table and they were kind of
[1:02:46] throwing off on message people well I I
[1:02:48] have to be honest it kind of bothers me
[1:02:50] when somebody starts making fun of
[1:02:51] message people cuz uh uh I'm one of them
[1:02:55] you know amen and and and and brother
[1:02:57] meno FZ was sitting there and brother
[1:02:59] meno said something and he probably
[1:03:01] don't want me quoting him but I'm going
[1:03:02] to quote him but but he said he said
[1:03:04] something very powerful he said to the
[1:03:06] brother he said listen I know what
[1:03:08] you're saying he said but listen this
[1:03:10] message gives hope to
[1:03:12] everybody amen now an education an
[1:03:15] intellectual church can only give hope
[1:03:17] to somebody in education and intellect
[1:03:20] but the message of the hour offers hope
[1:03:23] that no longer h no longer how long the
[1:03:26] devil's had a hold on you this message
[1:03:29] offers hope that you can break the power
[1:03:31] of it no no matter what kind of no
[1:03:34] matter what kind of family you were born
[1:03:36] to this message offers hope I don't care
[1:03:40] if your daddy was a drunk and your mama
[1:03:42] was a harlot this message offers hope it
[1:03:45] offers hope to your life it it offers
[1:03:48] hope to your homes it opens offers hope
[1:03:51] into your life because this message has
[1:03:54] a power in it that that can break the
[1:03:56] hold that the devil has on you listen if
[1:04:00] it's a genetic hold there a power in
[1:04:03] this message to break the genetic curses
[1:04:06] that are carried down through your life
[1:04:09] there's a power in this message that'll
[1:04:11] break temper and stubbornness and pride
[1:04:14] and has captured your whole family but
[1:04:16] you don't have to carry it there's a God
[1:04:19] here to expose and it come from the pits
[1:04:22] of hell and you can walk out of this
[1:04:24] building tonight free you can walk out
[1:04:27] of here with no hold upon you tonight
[1:04:30] because this message brings
[1:04:34] hope nobody is outside of the power of
[1:04:38] Hope with this message it can bring hope
[1:04:42] it can bring life because it operates in
[1:04:45] the realm of the
[1:04:49] spirit see brother bam says when it
[1:04:52] comes time for God to use me he takes me
[1:04:56] somewhere I don't know nothing about and
[1:04:59] when I'm coming back I lose sight of
[1:05:01] places and times but that's where it
[1:05:03] speaks to me there's a land beyond the
[1:05:06] river they call the sweet forever in a
[1:05:08] place where here on Earth we can rise
[1:05:11] into a spirit realm there's a place
[1:05:14] where we can
[1:05:15] go I I love how brother Ram says that I
[1:05:18] wish tonight that everyone would try to
[1:05:20] understand closely the angel of the Lord
[1:05:24] and his great mission and his work here
[1:05:26] on the earth now we know he's here but
[1:05:31] what is commission and what is the work
[1:05:33] that he had on the earth his work here
[1:05:36] on the Earth was to restore the faith of
[1:05:39] the children of God that they could
[1:05:42] return back to the power that God had
[1:05:46] gave us at the at the day of Pentecost
[1:05:48] actually the power of the true Sons now
[1:05:51] we bring them to Pentecost but I I just
[1:05:53] have to say this from my heart I believe
[1:05:55] that that message will take you further
[1:05:57] than that I think it'll take you to
[1:05:59] Pentecost and Beyond I believe it'll
[1:06:01] take you all the way back to the Garden
[1:06:03] of Eden when God
[1:06:05] fellowshipped with his children in the
[1:06:07] Garden of
[1:06:09] Eden now that work the working of his
[1:06:12] Spirit brother brandom says my work was
[1:06:15] in the realm now you you Doctor you can
[1:06:17] tell me about your body about the
[1:06:18] anatomy but my work is in the realm of
[1:06:21] the spirit that's where I live a big
[1:06:24] part of my life is in another Dimension
[1:06:26] that the world doesn't know anything
[1:06:29] about now I don't try to explain it he
[1:06:31] said there's no reason to try you can't
[1:06:35] in demonology brother Bram says it like
[1:06:37] this that of course Christians are
[1:06:39] influenced by one or the other now these
[1:06:41] these influences of course are coming
[1:06:44] from one side of the
[1:06:46] other now the devil has His prophets and
[1:06:51] God has his do you see what I mean
[1:06:56] stop to separate
[1:06:58] it listen to Prophet stop to separate it
[1:07:03] God has prophets and Satan has prophets
[1:07:07] don't just accept it all as
[1:07:09] spiritual stop and
[1:07:11] separate the word of God will separate
[1:07:15] it it's quick and powerful and sharper
[1:07:19] than any two-edged sword it'll separate
[1:07:22] the fallacy from the truth
[1:07:25] it'll leave a man standing right in
[1:07:27] truth you see what it is get in now now
[1:07:30] now man today he cannot break into that
[1:07:32] realm and getting a righteous man
[1:07:34] brother B's talking I'm sorry he's
[1:07:36] talking about going into that realm
[1:07:38] where where Samuel uh was called out by
[1:07:41] Saul he said of course in that day that
[1:07:44] Saul could call him out in that Realm of
[1:07:46] the spirit he said but today you can't
[1:07:47] break into that spirit and call a
[1:07:49] righteous man out of there he said
[1:07:51] because the blood of Christ done away
[1:07:52] with
[1:07:53] Paradise so so that right ious man ain't
[1:07:56] there anymore to call out like they did
[1:07:58] in the days of Saul see but there is two
[1:08:00] spirits on the earth and they're
[1:08:02] influencing the
[1:08:04] people now brother R says now he gave me
[1:08:07] a gift and I can submit myself into a
[1:08:09] certain realm of that spirit that God
[1:08:12] can open to you now it's a realm of the
[1:08:15] spirit see now watch what brother Braham
[1:08:17] says he takes it to our Lord where Jesus
[1:08:19] said I do not the works but my father
[1:08:23] doeth The Works in me he says see no
[1:08:26] flesh glories in the sight of God it's
[1:08:30] all in the realm of the
[1:08:32] spirit see now now I read something last
[1:08:35] week and I want to reread it to you I
[1:08:37] want to just barrel down on it just for
[1:08:39] a moment how can I overcome it means to
[1:08:42] recognize the devil in every one of his
[1:08:45] tricks now remember Ephesians 6 says it
[1:08:48] to withstand the devil in the Ws of the
[1:08:52] devil is that right to catch him in
[1:08:54] every trick now now now there's a
[1:08:56] there's a there's a powerful thing you
[1:08:58] have to stop and separate because the
[1:09:00] Bible says that the trials of the
[1:09:03] righteous are like pure gold so some of
[1:09:07] the trials or some of the situations
[1:09:09] that you face are trials that God has
[1:09:12] sent your way that's right it's not the
[1:09:15] Ws of the devil it's God bringing you to
[1:09:18] a place that you might be able to be
[1:09:20] molded into the image of God some of the
[1:09:22] things we face you know I I know
[1:09:24] sometimes we well you know this is all
[1:09:26] the devil well sometimes it's not
[1:09:28] sometimes the holy spirit is allowing
[1:09:30] things that it might help us to perfect
[1:09:33] our
[1:09:34] character amen do you see but you got to
[1:09:37] recognize to overcome me to recognize
[1:09:40] the source of this recognize the devil
[1:09:43] in every one of his tricks a lot of
[1:09:46] people say that there is no devil it's
[1:09:47] just a thought but don't you believe
[1:09:49] that the devil is real he's as real as
[1:09:53] you or anybody else the devil is real
[1:09:56] and you must recognize him real now
[1:09:59] watch at the same time you've got to
[1:10:02] recognize him as a devil and he's
[1:10:04] against you but to overcome somebody say
[1:10:07] to overcome to overcome you might
[1:10:10] recognize that God is greater and
[1:10:12] mightier than he is that's the one
[1:10:15] that's in you has already overcome him
[1:10:19] by his grace you are more than a match
[1:10:21] for him there's real overcoming see you
[1:10:24] can break any any hold he puts on You by
[1:10:27] recognizing the devil's got a choke hold
[1:10:30] on me but there's somebody in me greater
[1:10:33] than the one that's holding me and I got
[1:10:35] a way to break the power that he's got
[1:10:37] on me I'm not Imagining the devil's
[1:10:40] choking me amen he really is trying to
[1:10:43] choke me but there's somebody in me
[1:10:45] that's greater than the one trying to
[1:10:47] hold me now watch what brother random is
[1:10:50] saying now look now he says there's no
[1:10:52] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:10:54] that not what I after the spirit after
[1:10:56] the flesh but after the spirit then you
[1:10:59] realize that you've overcome you know
[1:11:01] what he is as a devil now you can't say
[1:11:05] I got sickness but I don't believe it's
[1:11:07] sickness now this is a real this is a
[1:11:09] real spot right here that we we should
[1:11:12] take a
[1:11:13] moment it is a
[1:11:16] sickness don't go around and try to say
[1:11:19] you know I I I I've met people and they
[1:11:21] say well the doctor's trying to tell me
[1:11:22] I got cancer I ain't got cancer well
[1:11:24] brother B don't say that he says go
[1:11:27] ahead and admit you got
[1:11:30] cancer go ahead that's right he says you
[1:11:33] got cancer but you don't believe it is a
[1:11:36] cancer but it is a cancer but remember
[1:11:40] greater is he that's in you than he
[1:11:43] that's in the world this is not mind
[1:11:45] over
[1:11:46] matter you're not imagining that you
[1:11:49] don't have cancer you really got cancer
[1:11:53] but there's a God that is greater than
[1:11:55] cancer see greater is he you're not
[1:11:59] imagining that you're tempted you're not
[1:12:02] imagining that you really are tempted
[1:12:05] you're tempted in your body you're
[1:12:06] tempted in this world but greater is he
[1:12:09] that's in you that's in the temptation
[1:12:12] of your
[1:12:13] body you you see what it is you got to
[1:12:15] you got to quit imagining that it's not
[1:12:17] real it is
[1:12:19] real it really is it's a real sickness
[1:12:22] and if you don't do something it'll kill
[1:12:24] you yes are you hearing me now watch
[1:12:28] this you must realize the holy spirit is
[1:12:30] in you has already overcome this thing
[1:12:33] well brother Wayne I tell you what I can
[1:12:35] deal with that well let's let's go let's
[1:12:37] go a step further how many ready go a
[1:12:38] step further he said and Elijah he said
[1:12:41] now bless this man lay hands upon him he
[1:12:44] said and ask that this nervous disorder
[1:12:46] leave him now listen I'm ask in Jesus
[1:12:50] name nervousness is the hardest thing
[1:12:53] there is to fight
[1:12:57] worse than
[1:13:01] cancer worse than cancer isn't it
[1:13:05] amazing amen that if you tell somebody
[1:13:07] what's nerves causing it they want to
[1:13:09] act like you think there's nothing wrong
[1:13:11] with them or you just think well they're
[1:13:13] just you know they're just making
[1:13:14] something up no you've got to admit that
[1:13:18] nervousness is worse than
[1:13:20] cancer come on church now I I I put a
[1:13:23] lot of study in this I know where I'm
[1:13:25] standing nervousness is worse than
[1:13:28] cancer and brother man said the reason
[1:13:30] is because you can't hardly Min balance
[1:13:33] yourself you can't get your mind running
[1:13:36] right so when you get nervous you can't
[1:13:39] catch your balance it's like a a person
[1:13:41] that they they just don't know where
[1:13:43] Amen to go or what to do it's almost
[1:13:46] like a man that's been punched from
[1:13:48] every corner and he don't know what to
[1:13:50] do where to turn where to go oh it's
[1:13:52] going to it's going to get me I I don't
[1:13:54] know where to go I don't I don't know
[1:13:56] where to run you've got to admit that
[1:13:59] it's a
[1:14:00] devil that it's real but greater is he
[1:14:04] that is in you that is he that's in the
[1:14:07] nervousness that's trying to choke off
[1:14:10] your
[1:14:11] life Satan will kill you if you let him
[1:14:15] he'll take all the joy out of your
[1:14:18] experience he'll take the joy out of
[1:14:20] your family he'll take the joy out of
[1:14:23] coming to church he'll take the joy out
[1:14:25] of having children nervousness will
[1:14:28] wreck you but you got to admit it's a
[1:14:31] devil and then you got to pick up your
[1:14:33] sword and fight
[1:14:36] back I tell you get up and fight back
[1:14:40] tell that devil tonight I'm going to
[1:14:43] break your hold in this
[1:14:49] meeting I'm going to warn you this is
[1:14:52] not a sermon this is a ministering angel
[1:14:55] speaking to you pick up your sword and
[1:14:58] fight back break that Devil's hold over
[1:15:02] your
[1:15:03] life don't just don't just lay there
[1:15:08] it's
[1:15:10] real it's real let me let me let me go
[1:15:14] into something deep here that the
[1:15:16] prophet said now I just said that his
[1:15:19] his ministry was in the realm of spirit
[1:15:22] it was not like a doctor it was in the
[1:15:25] realm of
[1:15:26] Revelation which exposes the devil do
[1:15:30] you see brother B said you believe me to
[1:15:31] be a servant you do that's the reason I
[1:15:35] asked you that he told me if you get the
[1:15:38] people to believe and be
[1:15:41] sincere he said I don't know anything
[1:15:43] about you nothing about you but I
[1:15:45] couldn't heal you if I had to nothing
[1:15:48] that I could do to heal you nor even
[1:15:50] know what's wrong with you I'm not a
[1:15:52] doctor I have to examine
[1:15:55] and I'd have to examine you to find out
[1:15:57] what was wrong and maybe then I couldn't
[1:16:00] do it I love this he said I could put
[1:16:02] you under
[1:16:04] x-rays but the spirit of God is the
[1:16:08] master
[1:16:10] X-ray and he's
[1:16:12] here and he knows all these things and
[1:16:16] he looks back down through the cycle of
[1:16:18] time do you believe that now between you
[1:16:21] and I stands a dark object there's a
[1:16:24] patience sh in front of him and he said
[1:16:26] now I'm going to put you under an x-ray
[1:16:28] machine that is the Lord Jesus the
[1:16:31] master X-ray and I see between you and I
[1:16:35] there's a dark object there's a floating
[1:16:38] cloud moving and I know who it is and I
[1:16:42] know what it does to people you're
[1:16:45] bothered with a nervous Condition it's a
[1:16:47] middle nervousness it's upset and you
[1:16:50] think sometimes that you're going to
[1:16:52] lose your mind isn't that
[1:16:55] right I'm not reading your mind now it
[1:16:59] has moved from you your faith without
[1:17:03] prayer has made you
[1:17:06] whole now watch this here's a man
[1:17:09] standing under an x-ray machine but as a
[1:17:12] prophet exposes it it loses its power
[1:17:16] without prayer the the exposition the
[1:17:19] revelation of the devil when God
[1:17:22] revealed what was causing the problem
[1:17:24] amen he showed how small it was in the
[1:17:27] presence of that kind of God and the man
[1:17:30] was healed without
[1:17:32] prayer but by faith now watch brother
[1:17:36] bradam I I I won't read all the
[1:17:38] forefronts of these but I'm going to
[1:17:39] read a few right in the middle of these
[1:17:41] there's another one standing there he
[1:17:43] said you feel like something standing
[1:17:45] near and I see what's wrong with you
[1:17:48] it's a nervous Condition it's a mental
[1:17:50] nervousness to tell you how you feel now
[1:17:53] oh God he's not just going to tell you
[1:17:55] what's wrong with you he's about to tell
[1:17:58] you how you feel when this comes on you

[1:18:04] like you're going to lose your
[1:18:08] mind you're upset aren't you everything
[1:18:12] goes wrong it works on you and the worst
[1:18:16] time it's in the
[1:18:18] evening wow now this Prophet is telling
[1:18:21] you how you feel he's telling you how
[1:18:24] you feel about everything and then he's
[1:18:26] telling you even when it turns in the
[1:18:28] evening you start feeling
[1:18:30] worse he says sometimes you just sit in
[1:18:33] a chair you're doing something when you
[1:18:37] pray to oh you're woring some dishes
[1:18:39] when you're
[1:18:42] praying here's a here's a prophet who's
[1:18:47] completely exposing he didn't say to the
[1:18:50] person brother Samuel you got to think
[1:18:52] of this he didn't say to the person you

[1:19:37] nervous and it's causing you to have all
