[0:00] [Music]
[0:01] Till the
[0:03] storm passes
[0:06] over, till the
[0:09] thunder sounds no
[0:13] more. Till the
[0:15] clouds fall
[0:19] forever from the sky.
[0:36] [Music]
[0:37] Heat. Heat.
[0:52] In the
[0:54] dark of the
[0:58] midnight have
[1:00] I hit my face.
[1:05] While the
[1:07] storms how about
[1:10] me and there's
[1:13] no hiding
[1:17] place in the
[1:20] crash of the
[1:23] thunder. Precious
[1:27] Lord my
[1:29] God, keep me
[1:32] safe. Heat.
[1:35] [Music]
[1:46] Heat. Heat.
[1:55] [Music]
[1:58] Heat.
[2:08] Heat. Heat.
[2:14] [Applause]
[2:21] I keep me
[2:26] safe till the stor passes
[2:35] by. Many
[2:38] times Satan
[2:41] whispered, "There is
[2:45] no use to try.
[2:50] There's
[2:51] no end of
[2:55] sorrow. There's no
[2:57] hope in the valley.
[3:02] But I
[3:04] [Music]
[3:05] know with
[3:10] [Music]
[3:27] meat. Heat. Heat.
[3:30] [Applause]
[3:32] [Music]
[3:37] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[3:47] Heat.
[3:48] [Music]
[3:52] Heat. Heat.
[3:57] [Music]
[4:05] Keep me
[4:07] safe. Oh, till the
[4:12] stor passes
[4:17] by. Let's stand. Sing that verse again.
[4:20] Often
[4:22] times, will Satan
[4:26] whisper? He'll say there's
[4:29] no use to try.
[4:34] For there's
[4:36] no end of
[4:39] sorrow. There's no
[4:42] hope in the
[4:46] mountain. But I know yes I
[4:51] know. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[4:55] [Music]
[5:06] Oh,
[5:15] heat,
[5:17] [Music]
[5:23] heat.
[5:28] Heat. Heat.
[5:31] [Music]
[5:41] Heat. Heat.
[5:52] Keep me
[5:54] safe till the
[5:57] storm pass is by
[6:02] glory to God.
[6:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Aren't you
[6:08] glad there's a place? Amen. Where he can
[6:10] put you till the storm passes by. It's a
[6:13] powerful thing to know. Amen. That a
[6:16] storm comes to pass by. You know, it
[6:18] don't stay long, does it? You know, you
[6:20] can see the darkness of those clouds and
[6:22] they rise up and in that moment it
[6:24] looked like maybe they'd be there
[6:25] forever. But if you just hold on a
[6:27] little while, amen. The cloud moves back
[6:30] and the sun shines and God's grace is
[6:33] have made evident among us. And Amen.
[6:36] Amen. And we want to if we could just go
[6:38] to the Lord in a word of prayer.
[6:40] Heavenly Father, our hearts are bowed
[6:42] before you tonight. Lord, I know there
[6:44] are great and many needs among us, but
[6:47] Lord Jesus, you're a God that meets the
[6:49] needs of your people. Father, your name
[6:51] is called Jehovah Gyra, that you are the
[6:55] provider. As we bow our hearts before
[6:57] you, we thank you for this awesome
[6:59] presence that is here, Lord. We thank
[7:02] you for this group of people that love
[7:03] you and praise you, Lord. And we're just
[7:06] asking you now that you would step on
[7:08] the scene in the way of the word. And
[7:10] may you bless this congregation that's
[7:12] gathered this evening to them, Lord,
[7:14] that can't be here tonight. We ask that
[7:16] you'd just go into the rooms where they
[7:18] are, Lord, and may you bless them. And
[7:20] Father, we ask for your mercy upon us
[7:22] now as we speak. We make known before
[7:25] all men that we are weak vessels, Lord.
[7:28] We have nothing within ourselves to help
[7:30] anyone. But Lord Jesus, we ask you that
[7:34] you would take what you have given. And
[7:36] Father, that you would help us tonight,
[7:38] Lord, against this enemy. we pray in
[7:41] Jesus name. Amen. And amen. And God
[7:45] bless you. Amen. If you have your
[7:47] Bibles, I'd like to go into the book of
[7:48] Ephesians, the 6th chapter. Amen. And I
[7:51] want to read here Ephesians 6 11 down to
[7:57] 17. Amen. U Ephesians 6 and verse 11.
[8:01] Put on the whole armor of God that you
[8:04] might be able to
[8:05] stand against the ws of the devil.
[8:10] For we wrestle not against flesh and
[8:12] blood, but against principalities and
[8:14] powers, right? And against the rulers of
[8:17] darkness of this world, against
[8:18] spiritual wickedness in high
[8:21] places, will fortake unto you the whole
[8:23] armor of God. Second time, take unto you
[8:26] the whole armor of God. That you may be
[8:29] able to withstand in the evil day, and
[8:32] having done all to stand.
[8:35] Stand therefore, having your loins gird
[8:38] about you with truth. In other words, if
[8:40] you get dressed upright, you can
[8:42] stand having your loins girded with
[8:45] truth and having on the breastplate of
[8:48] righteousness and having your feet shaw
[8:51] with the preparation of the gospel of
[8:53] peace and above all taking the shield of
[8:55] faith whereby you are able to quench all
[8:58] the fiery darts of the wicked. Now, all
[9:00] this has been defensive up to this time.
[9:02] All right. Take the helmet of the
[9:04] salvation, but then watch the offensive
[9:07] come. And the sword of the spirit, which
[9:11] is the word of God. We ask the Lord to
[9:14] bless his words. You could be seated.
[9:15] Tonight, I want to take from this a
[9:18] context tonight. If I would take a
[9:19] title, I want to speak to you from a
[9:21] from a little quote brother Brandham
[9:22] quoted on press the battle. Press the
[9:26] battle. 1 Timothy 6, Paul said, "Fight
[9:29] the good fight of faith, and lay hold on
[9:32] eternal life, where unto thou also
[9:35] called and has professed a good
[9:37] profession before many witnesses." In
[9:40] second Timothy 4, he said, "I have
[9:43] fought a good fight. I have finished my
[9:45] course. I have kept the faith." Keeping
[9:48] the faith is considered a fight. Yeah.
[9:50] In Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 32, he
[9:54] said, "But call to remembrance the
[9:55] former days in which you were
[9:57] illuminated. Ye endured a great fight of
[10:01] afflictions." So Paul is addressing the
[10:04] church much as soldiers that is in a
[10:06] battle. Brother Bram said, "Sometimes
[10:08] the gospel leans its way. Maybe one
[10:11] place you're a runner, another place
[10:12] you're a soldier, but it's teaching you
[10:15] using things that we know to understand
[10:17] how to press the battle. If you're a
[10:20] warrior, you're pressing the battle. If
[10:22] you're in a race, you're enduring to the
[10:24] end. Amen. So, you're pressing that
[10:26] battle. And I I love how Brother
[10:29] Brandham says things. Amen. It's good to
[10:30] have Troy home tonight. Amen. Amen. It's
[10:33] I love how God says things uh through
[10:35] the prophet hearing him. Amen. Brother
[10:38] Brandham speaking. He says, "I asking
[10:40] for your support as we gather together
[10:43] and we put our hearts and our soldiers
[10:45] sold shoulders together to press uh the
[10:48] battle on." See, for God is with us. And
[10:52] then who could be against us? That great
[10:55] morning star is over us. The banner of
[10:57] Christ, we're bound to conquer. He said,
[11:00] "So there's sickness here tonight and
[11:03] sin and people who are oppressed of the
[11:06] devil." He said, "But we are his
[11:08] soldiers of the cross. Let us press the
[11:12] battle now as we pray and study the
[11:16] word." I like that. Don't you? Pressing
[11:18] the battle. Praying and studying the
[11:20] word. Amen. In the rejected king,
[11:23] brother Bam says it like this. He says,
[11:25] "See, I believe if the Lord is willing,
[11:28] I want to press the battle harder than I
[11:30] ever have before." Isn't that something?
[11:33] Amen. Brother Bam was getting toward the
[11:35] end of his life and he was ready to
[11:37] fight harder then than he was in the
[11:38] earlier part of his life. Amen. In
[11:41] Rejected King, Brother Bam says it here.
[11:43] He says, you remember uh he went beyond
[11:45] the curtain of time and had the immortal
[11:48] come and speak with him. And brother Bam
[11:50] said that one visit there has made me a
[11:53] different man. He said I can never never
[11:56] ever be the same brother Brandham I was.
[11:59] Whether the planes are rocking or the
[12:01] lightning is flashing, whether the spy
[12:03] has a gun on me, whatever it is, it
[12:06] doesn't matter. I'm going to press the
[12:09] battle. By the grace of God, I preach
[12:12] this gospel to every creature,
[12:14] persuading them to believe in that land
[12:16] over yonder. Amen. Beyond the curtain of
[12:19] time, Brother Bam says this. He said, "I
[12:21] was laying there and I heard a voice
[12:23] saying, you are just starting. Press the
[12:27] battle. Keep pressing the battle. Amen.
[12:30] As I lay there pondering those words, I
[12:33] imagined that I heard a voice again and
[12:35] it said, "Press the battle. Keep going.
[12:38] Keep going." See? Amen. Still, I'm
[12:41] believing. I thought that possibly I had
[12:43] spoken the words myself and I placed my
[12:45] lips between my teeth and held them over
[12:47] my mouth. He said, "My hand over my
[12:49] mouth." And then a voice said it again,
[12:52] "Just keep pressing the battle." If you
[12:54] only knew what is at the end of the
[12:56] road, it seemed to hear that words, keep
[12:59] pressing the battle. Isn't that amazing
[13:01] that if you could hear what is being
[13:04] spoken from the immortal realm tonight,
[13:06] amen, it would be saying, "Press the
[13:08] battle." See, those beyond the curtain
[13:10] of time are not dealing with the
[13:12] oppositions you're dealing with. They're
[13:15] not limited by the senses you're limited
[13:17] by. They're not limited by the sight
[13:20] that you're limited by. Amen. So they're
[13:22] telling you from another dimension with
[13:24] greater vision, with greater awareness,
[13:27] with reality of who you are. And they're
[13:29] saying to you, "Press the battle." Amen.
[13:31] Because they know that you're more than
[13:33] able to conquer this battle if you'll
[13:36] only not get discouraged. If you'll not
[13:38] put your head down in the middle of this
[13:40] battle and start to give up on yourself,
[13:42] I tell you, press the battle. You were
[13:44] built for the battle. You're anointed
[13:47] for the battle. You're dressed for the
[13:49] battle. Amen. We have been put in this
[13:51] age for this battle. It's the battle of
[13:53] the greatest battle that's ever been
[13:55] fought. And God has chose you and placed
[13:58] you into this age that you might be able
[14:00] to stand in this wicked age. Brother Bam
[14:04] said, "So when we're leaving this battle
[14:05] tonight, leaving this building and the
[14:07] contest," he said, "let us go to our
[14:09] different places and our homes and that
[14:12] we might meet outside and meet the
[14:14] world." He said, "But not let us go as
[14:16] we have in former times." He said, "Let
[14:19] us go out of this building tonight in
[14:20] the power of the resurrection. Let us go
[14:24] in the name of Jesus Christ. Let us lift
[14:27] our banners high. Let us put faith in
[14:29] the word of God. Let us handle a
[14:32] two-edged sword." Amen. With a shield in
[14:34] the form armor of God on. We're going to
[14:37] meet this enemy because we're getting
[14:39] stronger and we're getting more powerful
[14:42] than we have every other day. When the
[14:44] enemy comes in like a flood, the spirit
[14:47] of God will raise a standard against
[14:50] that enemy. When I sake of it tonight,
[14:52] if the enemy is coming against us as
[14:55] hard as he is, I say the presence of God
[14:58] must be greater than it has ever been.
[15:00] This is the age that we're living in
[15:03] that we're getting stronger and we must
[15:05] press the battle. Brother Ram said, "I'm
[15:07] coming to the end of my ministry, the
[15:09] end of these mysteries." He said, "But
[15:11] listen, I'm looking for a strength to
[15:13] come into the church now, a rapturing
[15:15] strength to meet a force that the
[15:18] rapture will take place." He says,
[15:20] "Let's meet 63 with a challenge." When I
[15:23] say this, let's meet 2024 with a
[15:26] challenge. Let's meet our coming days
[15:28] with a challenge. I want to make you all
[15:30] aware of something. This assembly is
[15:32] about to hold a youth meeting. And
[15:34] there's going to be young people coming
[15:35] from every which direction. Amen. To
[15:38] come here and have Amen. fire burning
[15:41] bush experiences. They're they're
[15:43] coming. Amen. And let me tell you, the
[15:45] devil has put a target on you. He's put
[15:47] a target on our families. He's put a
[15:49] target on our church. But I want to make
[15:52] you aware. Press the Bible. Don't you
[15:55] give up. Don't you get disillusional.
[15:57] Don't you let it take your vision. Don't
[15:59] you let it get your attention. Do not be
[16:02] confused what this is about. God's going
[16:05] to use this assembly like he's never
[16:07] used it before. And the enemy is coming
[16:10] to stop it. But I got a word for you,
[16:12] Satan. You'll not stop it. You'll never
[16:15] stop the church of the living God. Amen.
[16:17] We have been armed for the age. We have
[16:19] been anointed for the battle. Our eyes
[16:22] is open. And we know what you're up to.
[16:25] Amen. And we are here tonight to meet
[16:27] the challenge. Somebody said, "Well,
[16:29] Brother Wayne, I tell you what. You
[16:30] know, it seems like your daughter's in
[16:32] trouble. Let me tell you what Shadrach,
[16:34] Meshach, and Abednego said. We will not
[16:36] bow to these devils of this world. We
[16:39] will not take back one thing we've had
[16:41] to say. We are going to press the
[16:43] battle. I don't have one thing to take
[16:45] back about breaking the hold of the
[16:47] devil. I say tonight, pick up your
[16:50] sword, soldier of the cross, and fight
[16:53] like you've never fought before. Amen.
[16:55] If God be with us, who can be against
[16:58] us? The power of God is a reality. Yes,
[17:01] sir. So, Brother Wayne, I'm looking for
[17:04] something. I'm looking for something
[17:06] that'll help us in this battle. Can I
[17:08] say to you tonight, you will not get a
[17:10] better weapon.
[17:12] There's no weaponry coming. The armory
[17:14] is not going to set up and hand out
[17:17] better weapons for the battle. You
[17:18] already have been given the greatest
[17:20] weapon that has ever been given to
[17:22] mankind. There has never been another
[17:25] group of people more prepared or more uh
[17:28] how can I say it? More supplied for the
[17:31] battle than this group. Tonight the
[17:33] books have been opened. The revelation
[17:36] has come to the age. You have been given
[17:38] the revelation of from the Garden of
[17:40] Eden all the way to the end. You have
[17:43] been given this. Amen. That you might be
[17:45] able to look at the devil tonight and
[17:47] you know every tactic. He's already been
[17:49] exposed. The light has come on him.
[17:52] You'll not deceive her by denomination.
[17:55] She knows what denomination is. You'll
[17:57] not deceive this pride. Amen. With your
[17:59] ideas and amen theology. She has seen
[18:03] the exposure of it. I'll say this
[18:05] tonight. You're not going to receive a
[18:07] better weapon than the word of God. The
[18:09] only thing for us to do is pick up our
[18:12] weapon and press the battle. Amen. I
[18:15] believe the infinite God who knew all
[18:18] things. Now, now I don't have a lot of
[18:20] time to prove this to you, but I believe
[18:22] he knows all things. Don't you? Don't
[18:24] you think he knows the end from the
[18:26] beginning? Don't you think he knows
[18:27] every gnat that'll that'll be alive?
[18:30] Every brother said the tattle of the
[18:32] net. Every time every Jesus said he knew
[18:35] every hair on your head. He knows every
[18:38] sparrow by name. He put every star in
[18:40] the heaven. Listen, there's a lot of
[18:42] hair in this age. Amen. There's a lot of
[18:45] people on the earth and he knows every
[18:47] hair. He knows every head. He knows
[18:49] every move. He Amen. There is nothing
[18:52] caught by surprise. He is an all-
[18:54] knowing God. Don't you think he knew we
[18:57] would be here in the type of battle
[18:59] we're in tonight? And he gave us a
[19:02] weapon knowing what we were facing. He
[19:05] knew exactly what we would need to get
[19:07] through the times that we are living.
[19:09] God was the one that chose the word and
[19:12] God's the one that gave us the word. We
[19:14] don't need to improve the word. We need
[19:16] to take it with both hands and whack the
[19:19] devil with it. We do not need to improve
[19:21] the message of the hour to get more
[19:23] power. We need to believe it works. Pick
[19:26] it up and beat back against that devil.
[19:29] Brother Bam said it like this. Just
[19:31] whack that devil. And if he don't move,
[19:33] whack him again. And if he don't move,
[19:36] whack him again. And if he don't move,
[19:38] whack him again. And if you just keep
[19:41] whacking after a little while, that
[19:44] devil's going to move out of your way.
[19:46] Yes, sir. I believe it tonight. Amen. No
[19:49] matter how many things Satan ever gets,
[19:52] how much his army gets, or anything,
[19:54] it'll never take the place of God's
[19:57] word.
[19:59] And Amen. And the enemy knows as long as
[20:02] you stay with that word, he will never
[20:04] be able to touch you.
[20:06] [Music]
[20:07] That's right. In Revelations the 12th
[20:10] chapter when you read it in the 11th
[20:12] verse it said and they overcame him by
[20:15] the blood of the lamb and by the word of
[20:19] their testimony. Now that's not the word
[20:21] of Luther.
[20:23] That's not the word of Wesley but the
[20:26] word of their testimony. What is the
[20:29] testimony of the bride? Amen. It is the
[20:32] spirit of prophecy that's coming the
[20:34] bride. Her testimony is the testimony of
[20:37] Jesus Christ. Her testimony is not
[20:40] justification. Her testimony is not
[20:43] sanctification or even just the baptism
[20:45] of the spirit. Her testimony is the
[20:48] token life of Jesus Christ. She don't
[20:51] just speak the name of Jesus. She has
[20:54] the life behind the name. That's what
[20:58] makes the devils tremble. Church, it
[21:00] ain't how loud we shout. It's the life
[21:02] that's in the revelation. Amen. But I'll
[21:05] tell you what, if you get the life, it
[21:06] makes you want to feel good about it.
[21:08] Amen. But it's the life that's behind it
[21:11] is what makes it powerful. It's the life
[21:13] behind the name. Amen. Now, I don't know
[21:16] if you're a Bible reader upon
[21:17] Revelations 12, but sometimes read it
[21:20] and see if it don't say there was war in
[21:22] heaven and Michael and his angels fought
[21:25] and they threw out the devil. Now, what
[21:27] the Bible said is the Satan prevailed
[21:29] not. I love that. And Satan prevailed
[21:32] not and he was cast out of the heavens.
[21:35] We're talking about angelic battles
[21:37] happening in the heaven. But when it
[21:39] comes to the 11th verse, it said they
[21:41] overcame him. Is that angels that
[21:43] overcame him? But the Bible said, "And
[21:45] they overcame him." They are the bride
[21:49] or the overcomer of Revelations 3 when
[21:52] the Bible said, "And they overcame
[21:54] shared with the throne of God." What was
[21:57] it? They had the word of their
[21:58] testimony. By the message of the hour is
[22:02] how you will overcome. The revelation
[22:05] that God has sent by this message is
[22:07] your overcoming revelation. If you just
[22:10] say what a prophet said, listen, the
[22:12] profession of this age is not to come up
[22:15] with a new remedy or new mystery. It's
[22:17] to say what a prophet said. It is
[22:20] powerful what a prophet said. It cast
[22:23] out demons back in the days of the 60s
[22:26] and the 50s because he exposed the
[22:28] devil. That same message will expose the
[22:31] devil in this age. But these people of
[22:34] Revelation 12:11 is powerful, brothers,
[22:36] because they fought like people who
[22:39] didn't care to lose their life. I tell
[22:42] you, you never fought anybody until you
[22:43] fought somebody wasn't scared of you.
[22:47] When I was a kid, we done a little share
[22:49] of fighting. I was a a little bitty
[22:51] fell. I didn't like to fight at all.
[22:53] Amen. But there was people that just
[22:55] Amen. they were just going to fight.
[22:56] Wasn't nothing you could do about it.
[22:58] Amen. But when you decide there's going
[22:59] to you're going to have to fight. Well,
[23:01] then you might as well fight.
[23:04] If you don't have a choice but fight,
[23:05] you might as well fight. Don't fight as
[23:08] one to lose. Don't fight as one just to
[23:11] stay in the fight, but fight as one
[23:13] who's going to win the fight. Now, the
[23:16] only way to win the fight is you have to
[23:17] lose the fear of who you're fighting.
[23:21] You got to lose the fear of what you're
[23:22] fighting. I remember specifically
[23:25] fighting guys when I was 4' 10 in tall
[23:27] and they'd be 6'2 and amen about 220
[23:30] lbs. And and when I was in my right
[23:32] mind, I wouldn't fight. When I was in my
[23:35] right, I wouldn't fight. But let them
[23:37] push me far enough. Just keep pushing.
[23:40] When you push me far enough, then if I
[23:43] fight, I fight to win. I don't fight
[23:45] just to get through the fight. And you
[23:47] just keep pushing and keep pushing and
[23:49] keep pushing. Amen. But after a while, I
[23:51] I would just tell them, "Hey, if we're
[23:53] going to fight, then let's fight." But
[23:55] let me tell you, Amen. When that old
[23:57] temper kicks
[23:59] in, when that old temper kicks in,
[24:01] you're 6' tall and bulletproof, even if
[24:03] you're 4 foot 10. Amen. And weigh 110
[24:06] lbs.
[24:08] Because it makes you invincible.
[24:12] That's the devil's way of energizing a
[24:15] person to get into a battle is a temper.
[24:18] But God has another way of energizing a
[24:21] person into the battle. He don't give
[24:23] you a temper. He gives you an anointing
[24:25] with a revelation. And he says, "Look, I
[24:28] know the devil looks big and I know that
[24:30] he looks great and I know look like he's
[24:33] going to destroy everything, but if
[24:34] enough anointing gets on you and the
[24:37] spirit of God drops on you, listen,
[24:39] you'll tackle whatever devil is in front
[24:42] of you. You let a devil get on your baby
[24:45] and you just might be a mother, but
[24:47] you'll pray and pray until an anointing
[24:50] comes and then you'll attack that enemy
[24:53] because you love not your life unto
[24:55] death.
[24:57] You love not your life unto death. In
[24:59] other words, Amen. If you got a man that
[25:02] has a reputation or a reason to not
[25:04] fight, Amen. You can fight with that
[25:06] guy. Maybe you could win, but if you
[25:07] take a guy don't care to die, come on.
[25:11] You got a guy that's got basically like
[25:12] a death wish. He just don't care that he
[25:15] he just barrels in. This bride has
[25:18] already given their life.
[25:21] They've already given their life.
[25:23] They've already give everything up. So
[25:25] they don't they're not looking to
[25:26] preserve themselves. They've already
[25:29] died. So they run right into the battle.
[25:32] And they love not their lives unto
[25:35] death. Sister Barb, they were right.
[25:37] They fight like somebody that don't
[25:39] care.
[25:42] Hard to deal with. I think it's
[25:44] something, brother uh brother Ray there
[25:46] and Peter, it said the devil is like a
[25:48] roaring lion.
[25:50] He's seeking whom he may devour. You
[25:54] know what I think it's powerful? Like a
[25:56] roaring lion. I like that. Don't you?
[25:59] Like a roar. He's not a roaring lion.
[26:02] He's like a roaring line. You know in
[26:04] Christ the mystery, brother Bam said,
[26:05] "We now have the answer to the devil's
[26:07] questions."
[26:08] How many knows he said that? We have the
[26:10] answer to the devil's questions. And
[26:12] when he said that, he said, "That's why
[26:14] Satan is howling the way he is now."
[26:17] Well, the like a roar is a howl. And
[26:20] then the devil's all howling about the
[26:23] message. He's howling. He's going around
[26:25] like like a like a roaring line. Like
[26:28] he's going to devour somebody. You know
[26:30] what it's built for? It's built for
[26:31] fear. It's like a It's like a pressure
[26:33] or a fear like it's going to come on
[26:35] you. You know, I probably shouldn't tell
[26:38] about my childhood, but I'll let you
[26:40] I'll let you just imagine this, but I
[26:42] can remember a few times in my life.
[26:44] Amen. With a I can't I can't We're
[26:46] online, but Amen. I can remember. Amen.
[26:49] I can remember, Brother Ray. Amen. You
[26:52] ever hear that term here kitty kitty
[26:54] kitty?
[26:56] And you got a little something hid
[26:57] behind you. Here kitty kitty kitty.
[27:00] Well, listen. Let me tell you something
[27:02] about that roaring lion tonight. I think
[27:04] it's time that the bride of Christ kind
[27:07] of look at him with her sword tucked
[27:08] behind their back and say, "Here, kitty
[27:10] kitty kitty. You just get up close
[27:13] enough. I can get you." That's all you
[27:15] need to get on up here a little closer
[27:17] because I got something for you. Listen
[27:19] to me. We are not afraid of this devil.
[27:22] We do not fear the enemy that has come
[27:25] upon us. I say here, kitty kitty. Amen.
[27:28] Take the sword of the spirit of God and
[27:32] cut the head of that devil off of you.
[27:34] Don't you back up. Don't you get
[27:36] discouraged. Don't you let fear get into
[27:39] your life. You're healed tonight by the
[27:41] anointing of God. Brother Dallas. Amen.
[27:43] I know that devil's attacked you in the
[27:45] last couple weeks, but it's time to pick
[27:47] up your sword and say, "Here, kitty
[27:52] kitty." You say, "You making fun of the
[27:55] devil." You bet I am. My Lord stripped
[27:57] him and left him without clothes, left
[27:59] him without weapons. He spoiled
[28:01] principalities and powers. And when he
[28:04] left hell, he was weaponless in hell.
[28:08] And in case you think he had weapons all
[28:10] the way down the end time, Amen. A
[28:12] prophet comes along and opens the seals
[28:13] and said, "What's the white horse mean?"
[28:15] Nothing more than he's a devil and he's
[28:17] a bluff.
[28:20] Oh yeah, he's a bluff. You said, "Well,
[28:22] brother Wayne, what time is it?" Brother
[28:24] Bam said, "The great hour of charge is
[28:27] at hand." The great hour of charge is at
[28:30] hand. Soldier with armors gleaming,
[28:32] colors streaming. Faith and doubt is
[28:34] setting itself away in this tabernacle.
[28:37] Doubt on one side, faith on another
[28:38] side. Stand at your post of duty.
[28:41] Hallelujah. Our captain, the morning
[28:44] star, leads on and he never goes back.
[28:47] He never don't know the word retreat. He
[28:50] don't have to retreat. Hallelujah. He
[28:52] don't have to retreat tonight. Our Lord
[28:55] don't have to retreat tonight. He is the
[28:57] captain of the host, the God we serve.
[29:01] Amen, brother Kyle. He don't have to
[29:02] back up. He don't have to walk away. He
[29:05] is the captain. He is the creator. He is
[29:08] the God of all creation.
[29:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The greatest
[29:13] battle is ever fought is going on right
[29:15] now between life and death. Between
[29:19] sickness and health, between faith and
[29:22] doubt, between liberty and bondage, the
[29:25] battle is on. Shine your spear,
[29:28] soldiers. Polish up your arm. God is
[29:30] getting his soldiers ready. God is
[29:34] anointing his army.
[29:37] God is anointing his army. Brother
[29:40] Logan, no retreat.
[29:43] Come on. No retreat. Come on. No
[29:47] reserves. No regrets. I love this
[29:50] tonight to think of we're not going to
[29:52] give the devil any quarter. We're not
[29:55] going to give the devil a quarter. We're
[29:57] We're not going to give him a place to
[29:59] get out of the way. We're not going to
[30:01] give the devil a place to hang around
[30:03] and hide in a certain place. The Bible
[30:06] said when they cross the Jordan River,
[30:08] he said, "Go and and establish the whole
[30:11] land. Don't leave places unoccupied.
[30:14] Don't leave little bush places around
[30:16] for the enemy and the beast to hide in.
[30:18] I say tonight, you tear down every
[30:20] stronghold that the devil has built in
[30:23] your life. Listen, the anointing is upon
[30:26] the church in this hour. Reach up and
[30:28] pull down the strongholds of your life.
[30:31] This is the hour to do it. This is the
[30:33] season to do it. This is the anointing
[30:36] to do it. Listen, God, Satan don't have
[30:39] to have your whole life. He don't have
[30:42] to have it all. just needs a part of it.
[30:45] That's right. Ain't it? He just needs a
[30:46] part of it. He don't have to have
[30:48] everything. Amen. It's just like It's
[30:50] just like you you can push somebody far
[30:52] enough and they just finally they push
[30:54] back, right? Amen. You You know what I'm
[30:56] talking about, brother Alex. You You
[30:58] come up in your life and somebody push
[30:59] on you, push on you, push on. Well, at
[31:01] some point you go to pushing back. Amen.
[31:03] And and why do you do that? Because
[31:06] you're not a coward, right? You're
[31:08] you're not somebody that's just uh
[31:10] you're not just going to lay down let
[31:11] some devil in your family or let it come
[31:13] in your house or let it may maybe
[31:15] somebody showed up and they say hey you
[31:17] know hey uh uh this is my house I said
[31:20] no it's my house actually they said well
[31:22] I'm going to eat you food and I'm going
[31:23] to drink your coffee said no you're not
[31:25] going to eat my food and drink my coffee
[31:26] and he might be nice for a little while
[31:29] but you let it persistently keep on and
[31:31] a little while brother's going to say
[31:33] look fella enough is enough okay amen
[31:36] and something will cause them to begin.
[31:38] A fellow that wants to be pacifist, a
[31:41] fellow that don't want to fight, a
[31:43] fellow that would rather let things go.
[31:45] There is a point where they cannot let
[31:48] it go. And the church of the living God
[31:50] has come to a place in this hour that
[31:53] the devil is pressing. He's pressing
[31:55] every direction. And there is a bride
[31:57] said, "No, I won't let it go no
[32:00] further."
[32:02] Satan, I'm going to call you out.
[32:05] Isn't that powerful? When the Holy
[32:07] Spirit gets to that place in life, now
[32:10] what is it? It's a battle cry. It's a
[32:12] battle cry of the believer that God has
[32:15] no retreat. There is no retreat in God.
[32:19] Go forward. The doctor says it's cancer.
[32:22] Go forward. If he says it's TB, go
[32:25] forward. Amen. I just just was visiting
[32:28] Brother Andy yesterday. Brother Ray was
[32:29] there as well. Went in talked to him a
[32:31] little while and he had some he had some
[32:33] pneumonia and had some infection. They
[32:35] done a scan and found a lesion on his
[32:37] liver. And I was in there and I could
[32:39] see somebody had told him more than
[32:41] likely that that cancer had spread. They
[32:43] got a fancy word they use. It's a I
[32:46] can't even say the word, but but but it
[32:49] spreads a little bit. And he said he
[32:51] said, "I got a lesion on my liver. It
[32:52] looks like that it's metastasized."
[32:54] That's the word that it's metastasized.
[32:57] And you could see the in his spirit. You
[32:59] could see. And we got to talking and he
[33:02] said, "But I've got this other
[33:03] infection." And I said, "Well, Brother
[33:04] Andy, if you got infection in the rest
[33:06] of your body, why don't we just believe
[33:08] that's just an infection on that liver?
[33:10] Why don't we just believe right now that
[33:13] that's all that is?" Amen. He said,
[33:14] "Brother Wayne, I believe that." Well,
[33:16] today they text and they said, "Well, I
[33:19] tell you, he had the biopsy and it
[33:21] wasn't nothing but a but a but an
[33:22] infection on the liver." Now, I don't
[33:24] know what it was when they first saw it.
[33:27] Amen. But God has given us mercy. that
[33:30] brother end it. If it's cancer, press
[33:32] the Bible. If it's TV, press the Bible.
[33:36] If it's depression, press the Bible.
[33:39] We're not going to back up. We're not
[33:41] going to stand by. It's time to charge
[33:45] the enemy before us. This is the hour
[33:48] that we're living. There is no place to
[33:50] retire. There is no place to retreat.
[33:54] There is no way to get out of the
[33:55] battle. Yes, sir.
[33:58] There's no way to get out of the battle.
[34:00] You're in the battle whether you want to
[34:02] be or not. If you're a Christian, you're
[34:04] in a battle.
[34:08] Said, "Preacher, what are you going to
[34:09] say?" I said, "Moses got behind a rock
[34:11] and prayed until he got marching
[34:13] orders." And he come out from behind
[34:15] that rock and he said it said to me,
[34:18] "Speak the rock. Speak to these
[34:20] children. Don't cry. Go forward.
[34:24] Speak the word and go forward. Amen. Do
[34:28] you see what it is tonight? You see the
[34:30] marching orders? Press the battle. Don't
[34:34] back off. No matter what stage of the
[34:37] battle you're in,
[34:40] if you backed up and said, "I'm afraid
[34:41] of divine healing. I'm afraid of this or
[34:44] other. I'm afraid of the baptism of the
[34:45] Holy Ghost." Speak the word and go
[34:47] forward. No retreat. Don't you come
[34:49] back. There's nothing to come back to.
[34:52] All right. Yeah. Hallelujah. Nothing to
[34:54] come back to is like Pharaoh's army.
[34:56] What was Moses going to do? Run back to
[34:58] Pharaoh.
[35:00] Are you hearing me? There's nothing
[35:02] behind you. There's nothing to back up
[35:04] to. There's no retreat to go to. It's
[35:07] either It's either go forward or die.
[35:10] Well, I'll tell you this. If I'm going
[35:11] to die, I'm going to die fighting. If
[35:14] I'm going to die, I'm going to die with
[35:15] a sword in my hand. And there'll be a
[35:17] bloody demon laying at the feet. Amen.
[35:20] I'll tell you this tonight. We did not
[35:22] come here to be defeated. We did not
[35:24] come into this earth, amen, to be a
[35:27] lukewarm, washed down, saw so Christian.
[35:30] We are sons and we are daughters of God
[35:33] which have been anointed for this age to
[35:36] face the battle which we are facing.
[35:39] Yes, sir.
[35:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[35:44] So, brother Wayne, I ain't got nothing
[35:46] to fee him with. Jesus defeated him
[35:48] every way with the word of God. Brother
[35:51] Brandham said, "What you are to do is
[35:52] stand toe-to-toe with that
[35:54] devil." I say this, you ought to fight
[35:56] like somebody invincible.
[36:00] Yes. In southern terms, just go off on
[36:04] that devil.
[36:08] People see people that study martial
[36:11] arts. I don't know. Did you study with
[36:13] Brother Craig? I thought you did.
[36:14] Brother Craig and studied martial art
[36:16] and boxing. I thought you guys all
[36:18] studied together. And people that study
[36:19] martial arts, they have defensive
[36:21] mechanisms and everything for other
[36:23] people that have martial
[36:25] arts. But you let them meet a crazy
[36:27] street fighter and he just goes off on
[36:29] them. That's not in the book. That's not
[36:33] in the plan. We don't have defense for
[36:34] that. We don't have defense for for
[36:36] insane fighting.
[36:40] We supposed to fight a certain way. And
[36:42] you're supposed to be a gentleman. A
[36:43] gentleman. I don't understand that fair
[36:46] fight. I don't get it. There's nothing
[36:48] fair about a fight. Come on. There's
[36:50] nothing fair about it. Pick up a rock
[36:52] and throw it. Pick up a sword and get at
[36:55] it. Amen. Whatever you got to do to win,
[36:58] win.
[36:59] [Applause]
[37:02] You say, "Well, that's street fighting."
[37:04] Well, that's scrapping.
[37:07] That's scrapping. That's what the bride
[37:09] is. Scrappers. That's right.
[37:12] No formal training. Come on. Spit and
[37:15] slobber and stomp and holler. But devils
[37:18] move.
[37:19] [Applause]
[37:21] But devils move. Jibberj and talk in
[37:24] tongues and cry out loud and snot flying
[37:26] and slinging. But devils get out of the
[37:29] way because we're the children of God.
[37:32] Anointed and led by the spirit of God
[37:36] for the age that we're living in. Yes,
[37:38] sir. Amen. Now remember Christ in the
[37:41] true church is a continuation of the
[37:42] book of acts but the book of revelation
[37:45] shows how the antichrist would come into
[37:46] the church and defile it making lukewarm
[37:49] formal and powerless. It exposes Satan
[37:51] and it reveals his works. Attempted
[37:54] destruction of God's people and
[37:56] discrediting God's word. I like that.
[37:58] Don't you? Attempted destruction.
[38:01] My the English language that's powerful.
[38:04] Satan attempted destruction of God's
[38:07] people and discrediting of God's word
[38:09] right down to the time he's cast into
[38:11] the lake of fire. He fights it. He
[38:14] cannot stand it. He knows that if these
[38:16] people get a true revelation of the true
[38:18] church and what she is and what she
[38:20] stands for, she can do the greater
[38:22] works. Amen. That's just the part I want
[38:24] to read to you. She will be
[38:30] Somebody say it louder.
[38:33] She will be
[38:36] Well, can I ask you when's this going to
[38:38] happen? Right now. Who's it going to
[38:41] happen to? I believe this is the time.
[38:44] And I believe we are the people. I
[38:47] believe the people of invincibility have
[38:50] come upon the scene. We are not
[38:52] invincible because we're smart. We are
[38:54] not invincible because we're
[38:55] intelligent. We're invincible because
[38:58] God made us invincible. His word has
[39:01] fortified us. His word has come into our
[39:04] lives and has stood up us upon our feet.
[39:08] An invincible army.
[39:10] Well, with my limited language, I had to
[39:12] borrow the dictionary and I went beyond
[39:15] I went beyond I went beyond this fella
[39:18] just local. I went to Oxford. Come
[39:25] on. Just Webster. Yeah.
[39:29] Oxford. went to Oxford
[39:33] language. Invulnerable.
[39:35] Yeah. Indestructible.
[39:38] Yeah. Unconquerable.
[39:41] Yeah.
[39:42] Unbeatable.
[39:45] I love the English language.
[39:49] Indomitable. Yes. Unassalable.
[39:53] Yeah. Unyielding.
[39:56] Unflinching.
[39:57] Unbending.
[39:59] Unshakable. impregnable,
[40:02] secure, and safe. You won't dominate
[40:05] her.
[40:06] You won't impregnate her. You'll never
[40:09] impregnate this bride of man's seed.
[40:11] Amen. The devil will never break into
[40:13] her doors. You'll never find a way in.
[40:16] She shut off every gate, brother. Amen.
[40:19] She's got the 10 gates sealed off. And
[40:21] there's a soul in there with the word of
[40:24] God. It's indestructible, incorruptible.
[40:27] It's invincible. It's the word of God
[40:30] which will stand forever. The prophet of
[40:32] God said, "This bride will never fail."
[40:35] The first day he fell by disbelieving
[40:37] the word. He said, "But this bride won't
[40:40] fall because she is the word." That's
[40:44] right. You're not just believing
[40:46] something. You are something. You're not
[40:48] just believing the word. You are the
[40:50] word. Come on. You read it. There'll be
[40:53] a bribe without spot or wrinkle. Well,
[40:55] you're not reading it tonight. You are
[40:56] that. Yes.
[40:58] Amen.
[41:00] Now, it's not just because, amen, of how
[41:02] powerful you are. It's because of the
[41:05] word of God which dwelleth in you
[41:06] richly. In Isaiah 54:17, my Bible says
[41:10] that no weapon, somebody say no weapon,
[41:13] no weapon is formed against thee
[41:17] shall prosper.
[41:18] Now, that is the word of God. That's not
[41:21] a that's not an almanac, right? That's
[41:24] not a dictionary. That is the eternal,
[41:27] everlasting, undefiable, indestructible,
[41:30] incorruptible word of God. It said no
[41:33] weapon, brother. That's a big statement
[41:36] cuz there's been a lot of weapons.
[41:39] But you're dealing with a God that knows
[41:41] the end from the beginning. He knew when
[41:43] the stone age come. He knew when the
[41:45] bronze age come. He knew when the
[41:46] atomics came. He knew when every weapon
[41:49] ever formed of man was formed. And he
[41:52] looked at them all and he said, "No
[41:54] weapon.
[41:56] Nothing the devil has, nothing that he
[42:00] did have, or nothing that he's going to
[42:02] make will work on this bride to prosper.
[42:06] No weapon that is formed against thee
[42:10] shall prosper. You said, "Preacher, what
[42:12] are you doing?" We asked the kitty,
[42:13] said, "Come on, kitty. We got a little
[42:15] something for you." No weapon. I I don't
[42:19] care what he says or what he thinks. No
[42:21] weapon. Somebody say it. No weapon.
[42:25] I know that Satan is devising weapons
[42:27] right now against your home. But Brother
[42:29] Kyle, no weapon, Brother Rodney, no
[42:32] weapon. Brother Isaac, no weapon, no
[42:36] weapon formed against thee shall
[42:38] prosper. Amen. I know the enemy has a
[42:40] great arsenal. I know he has depression.
[42:43] Oh, that's one of his that's one of his
[42:45] elite machines. Depression. I say no
[42:48] weapon.
[42:50] Amen. Oh, I'll pull anxiety out and I'll
[42:52] blow your family. No weapon. Amen. You
[42:55] said, "Well, I tell you what, if that
[42:57] don't get you, we'll bring fear in."
[42:59] Well, I say no weapon. No weapon,
[43:01] brother Randy. No weapon. No neurotics.
[43:04] No anxiety. No demon of depression. It's
[43:07] form that can prosper against the bride
[43:10] of Christ. This is not just a sermon.
[43:13] It's my heart. I want you to hear me.
[43:15] There is no weapon. There is nothing the
[43:18] devil's got. There's nothing the devil
[43:20] can say. There is nothing that he has
[43:24] that shall prosper against thee. He
[43:27] cannot prosper.
[43:29] Because the Bible said he can't prosper.
[43:32] You said, "Well, brother Wayne, that's a
[43:34] big thing. No weapon." It's a very
[43:36] inclusive statement, isn't it?
[43:39] Amen. No weapon. Can I say it? No
[43:42] instrument of war. All right. No sword,
[43:45] no spear, no instrument of persecution
[43:48] or torture that is made shall prosper. I
[43:54] think about this. No depression.
[43:58] I just want to say that three or four
[43:59] times.
[44:02] No depression.
[44:04] No depression. No depression.
[44:07] I don't care how heavy it gets. It's a
[44:09] demon. It's a bluff.
[44:12] We got his answer. We know how to break
[44:14] the hold of it.
[44:18] Yes, sir. I tell you, I wish I wished I
[44:21] had a cigarette lighter. I guess I call
[44:23] it a fire starter. I don't like that
[44:26] cigarette lighter. I don't like to say
[44:27] it like that. What's a good word to call
[44:29] it? Huh? A fire starter. Yeah, a fire
[44:34] stick. I wish I had one of them. I could
[44:36] get the strongest guy in this building
[44:38] to put me in a headlock. I'll get out of
[44:39] it in a minute.
[44:42] Just crank that baby up on his arm.
[44:44] He'll let go.
[44:46] And this bride has a fire that'll make
[44:48] the devil turn loose.
[44:52] It'll make the devil turn loose,
[44:53] brother. Our God is a consuming fire.
[44:57] And if you just turn loose on that
[44:59] devil, he'll turn loose of you.
[45:03] He'll never hold her. No. No disease
[45:06] will hold her. No anxiety will hold. No
[45:08] sickness will hold. No oppression will
[45:10] hold, no fear will hold. And this is the
[45:13] big one. No discouragement.
[45:17] I think of the weaponry that Satan has
[45:20] in his armament. I would say the
[45:22] greatest one he has is discouragement.
[45:25] I want to think honestly from my heart
[45:27] to yours the weapon that he has a best
[45:29] choice because he has quietened the
[45:32] greatest of soldiers. He has took the
[45:35] most powerful of people and discouraged
[45:39] their heart that they might not fight in
[45:41] the battle.
[45:43] Amen. I tell you what, Satan has
[45:46] discouragement. Amen. He tries to say,
[45:48] "It's too hard. It's too difficult.
[45:52] It'll never help. It'll never change."
[45:54] God's preaching, "It'll never help. I
[45:56] won't never make it. It'll never be
[45:58] enough. I might as well just quit."
[46:00] Well, that's what he wants you to do.
[46:03] I might as well just quit. I tell you
[46:05] what, I don't think people like to hear
[46:06] me sing. I'm just going to quit singing.
[46:09] Well, if id have did that with
[46:10] preaching, I'd quit a long time ago.
[46:13] There's plenty of people didn't like to
[46:15] hear me preach. They don't have to come.
[46:18] But I'm going to preach anyhow because I
[46:22] was called of God. Amen. Encourage
[46:25] yourself in the Lord. Say, Satan, I'm
[46:28] not singing for you. I'm not testifying
[46:30] for you. I'm not preaching for you. And
[46:33] if you don't like it, you don't have to
[46:35] listen.
[46:37] Discouragement.
[46:39] Oh, prayer don't work.
[46:42] Oh, I've prayed and I prayed. It just
[46:44] don't work. Lying, devil.
[46:48] I was reading the other day and Brother
[46:50] Brand was talking about people coming
[46:51] back to the Lord and he was at the end
[46:52] of a service and he said right here some
[46:54] of these people coming tonight. He said,
[46:56] "There's a mother's prayer setting in
[46:58] glory tonight." He said that she never
[47:00] saw it when she was alive. But tonight,
[47:03] God is fulfilling it cuz he kept that
[47:05] prayer. He never lost that prayer. You
[47:08] see that? God don't just throw away your
[47:10] prayer. Many times, brother Ben will
[47:12] call somebody out. He say, "I see you've
[47:14] been praying. I see you in a prayer line
[47:16] and you were here and this happened and
[47:18] this happened." Amen. And they're
[47:20] standing there discouraged because they
[47:22] didn't think anything happened.
[47:25] But a prophet knew there were. He could
[47:28] tell them they were in prayer lines. He
[47:29] could tell him what happened because God
[47:31] sees you. He sees your prayer. Listen,
[47:34] God sees what you do. Can Can I preach
[47:37] to you? It was an angel that went to
[47:39] Cornelius's house. And remember what he
[47:41] said to Cornelius. He says, "Thine arms
[47:44] and thy prayers have reached unto heaven
[47:47] up in heaven." They knew that Peter gave
[47:49] offerings unto the Lord up in heaven. Or
[47:52] Cornelius. See, it mattered. Maybe maybe
[47:55] Cornelius said, "Well, this don't
[47:56] matter. We've done this for years and it
[47:57] really don't matter. And the angel
[47:58] stands there and says, "Hey, your
[48:01] prayers and your arms have reached under
[48:05] heaven." You see, discouragement comes
[48:08] and it's one of the greatest weapons
[48:10] that Satan has. Amen. And when you can
[48:12] get discouraged, that's when things you
[48:14] you listen, I don't have time to go back
[48:17] in the scripture, but when they were
[48:19] building the walls, amen, of the of the
[48:20] temple, the second temple, remember
[48:22] that? And they were working and the
[48:23] Bible said they become discouraged
[48:24] because of much rubble.
[48:27] You know what I'm You know what? They've
[48:28] been already working in that rubble a
[48:30] long time. But all of a sudden the
[48:32] rubble was on their nerves. You know why
[48:33] it was on their nerves? Because of their
[48:35] because of their attitude. The problem
[48:37] was the same as it's always been. But
[48:40] when you get discouraged, all of a
[48:41] sudden problems that you've been dealing
[48:43] with for years seem to be mountains in
[48:45] front of you. Amen. It seems
[48:47] unobtainable. It seems like it will
[48:49] never change. It can never happen. But
[48:51] Satan's just trying to discourage you to
[48:53] lay down your weapon because God is
[48:55] going to use you to fight.
[48:58] You don't know when God's about to use
[49:00] you for something powerful. You don't
[49:02] know when God is going to use you to
[49:04] testify and bring somebody to the Lord
[49:07] or encourage somebody in a powerful way.
[49:09] I was standing in Norway one time
[49:11] speaking to a guy. He was a heavy metal
[49:13] guy. This just come on my heart. He was
[49:14] a heavy metal guy. He actually was a was
[49:16] a rock star. Big guy over in Norway. I
[49:18] mean big rock star. Come to the message.
[49:20] got saved. He started raising a family.
[49:23] Had a young daughter and and I was there
[49:25] preaching their family camp and had met
[49:27] his daughter, kind of knew her a little
[49:28] bit and had been there two or three
[49:29] years in a row. And one day he come up
[49:31] to me and was talking to me and he had
[49:33] got real discouraged. Amen. There was
[49:36] some there was some problems that had
[49:37] come up in the church and he had took a
[49:39] critical spirit towards the pastor. And
[49:41] when he took that critical spirit,
[49:44] everything started piling up on him. He
[49:46] started keeping a record of every wrong
[49:48] and every he thought every wrong
[49:49] judgment. And I'm not preaching for
[49:51] myself, but I'll say something to you.
[49:52] Don't never judge somebody making
[49:54] decisions until you know the whole
[49:56] story. Okay?
[49:58] Cuz as a pastor, brother Ray will tell
[49:59] you this. There's a lot of times you
[50:01] can't tell the whole story. You can't
[50:04] tell the other side of why you're making
[50:06] a choice. So just if you really really
[50:08] really got to know, then maybe you ask
[50:10] somebody. But this guy got so loaded up
[50:12] with things in about two years. And he
[50:14] was standing there and he was about
[50:15] ready to leave the church, ready to
[50:17] leave the message. He was just tore all
[50:18] the pieces and discouraged and he was
[50:20] standing there talking to me, man. He
[50:22] was just unloading. It was just a
[50:23] darkness about him. And while we were
[50:25] talking, I kind of looked over and all
[50:27] of a sudden his daughter walks up to the
[50:30] side. And when his daughter walked up, I
[50:32] saw
[50:33] something. Amen. And when she turned
[50:35] around and walked away, I said,
[50:36] "Brother, listen to him. Let me tell you
[50:37] a secret." I said, "That devil, he's a
[50:40] snake. and a rattlesnake, it's rattlers
[50:43] on the tail, but you don't have to watch
[50:45] the tail. You better watch the head. And
[50:47] I said, "What's happening is what you're
[50:50] discouraged with, this criticism that's
[50:51] on you is the rattle of the tail of that
[50:54] serpent. He's got your attention away
[50:56] from his mouth and he's biting your
[50:58] daughter." He said, "Brother Wayne, you
[51:00] think so?" I said, "I'm telling you in
[51:02] the name of the Lord, go talk to her and
[51:04] tell and you'll find out that the
[51:05] devil's about to steal your daughter out
[51:07] from under you while you got your
[51:09] attention on somebody else's problem.
[51:11] And when your daughter ain't in church
[51:13] no more and she's out there in the world
[51:15] and all these things, what difference
[51:16] will all of that matter then?
[51:20] What difference will it matter then? who
[51:22] sat where and what the carpet was there
[51:24] and what the
[51:28] [Applause]
[51:30] Yeah, man. I've seen families where boys
[51:32] move or girls move halfway across the
[51:34] country and come to a church and parents
[51:36] are safe and they got their little
[51:38] family around them and then they start
[51:40] nitpicking the church and next thing you
[51:42] know they start feeding that into their
[51:43] family and they don't know that they got
[51:46] a son-in-law that might want to go
[51:47] somewhere else and they don't know they
[51:49] got a daughter-in-law that might be
[51:50] ready to pack up and go somewhere else.
[51:53] That devil starts doing you that way,
[51:55] he's going to bite something you love. I
[51:57] tell you what you do. You tell that
[51:59] devil, I'm going to put my head on your
[52:02] my foot on your head. I'm not going to
[52:04] listen to your lies.
[52:08] That was free. I don't know who that's
[52:10] for. But I'll say this to you that he's
[52:12] always trying to get your attention away
[52:15] from the battle. Yeah.
[52:19] And while your head is turned,
[52:22] he's trying to take something from you.
[52:25] Now, watch this. Amen. Now, the reason
[52:27] it says no weapon, put that back up
[52:29] there. No weapon. No weapon. Now, why no
[52:32] weapon? Why is it no weapon formed
[52:35] against thee shall prosper? How is it
[52:37] that God could say no weapon? If you
[52:39] look at the verses above it, it explains
[52:41] it. He said, "Because I have created the
[52:44] smith that bloweth the coals and fire
[52:47] and bringeth forth the instruments of
[52:49] work, and I have created the waster to
[52:51] destroy." In other words, God created
[52:54] the man that's going to build the
[52:55] weapon. God created the fire that's
[52:58] going to form the weapon. God is supreme
[53:02] control over the whole thing. And the
[53:05] God that's in control tells you there is
[53:08] no weapon. Now, can I say it like this?
[53:10] You have an iron dome about you.
[53:13] You've got an iron dome. And natural
[53:15] Israel, this is natural Israel speaking
[53:16] now. Amen. Natural Israel has an iron
[53:19] dome. It don't matter what missile has
[53:21] shot at her. Amen. Look, look. Now,
[53:23] because of that Iron Dome and the fierce
[53:26] wrath of Israel, there's a lot of
[53:27] missiles never get off the ground.
[53:29] There's a lot of little fellas sitting
[53:31] over there with a missile that would
[53:32] love to bomb Jerusalem, but they look at
[53:34] that and they look at that and they go,
[53:36] "No, it's
[53:37] okay." They put their little they put
[53:39] their gun away because they fear the
[53:42] wrath that will come upon them. But the
[53:44] people that get the nerve to do it and
[53:46] shoot it, Amen. There's an Iron Dome
[53:48] that shoots the missiles before they
[53:49] ever land. Can you imagine being an
[53:52] enemy and I'll send a hundred of them at
[53:54] one time and watch them in the
[53:57] air and they're just leaving as they fly
[54:00] in the air because see, amen, that
[54:02] there's somebody that developed the
[54:04] weapons that are being shot.
[54:07] So they can they can develop a defense
[54:10] against the weapons that are shot
[54:13] because they formed the first weapon.
[54:16] They know how to defend you against the
[54:18] second weapon. But those missile defense
[54:21] systems every now and then will let
[54:23] something get through. But the defense
[54:26] system of this bride, amen, is a defense
[54:29] system of the word of God and it will
[54:32] protect you. It will secure you. It will
[54:35] make you invincible.
[54:38] [Applause]
[54:39] Amen. In other words, God has created
[54:41] the whole thing as a manufacturer. He
[54:44] says that they shall not prosper. Now
[54:46] watch this. Because they shall not
[54:48] prosper. That word is an interesting
[54:49] word right there. It shall not have
[54:52] prosperity. Meaning that it might be
[54:54] permitted for a time to appear. Amen.
[54:58] That it might persecutors and oppressors
[55:01] have done. But there will not be a final
[55:04] and complete
[55:07] success. So when it says no weapon
[55:09] against thee shall prosper, doesn't mean
[55:11] there's no battles coming. But it means
[55:14] there will be no final success of
[55:17] whatever the devil throws at the church.
[55:20] I love that. Don't you? Whatever he's
[55:22] got, there will be no final success of
[55:24] it to come. It will not prosper. Now,
[55:27] now you say, "Preacher, Amen. Uh, can I
[55:29] just explain to you? There is battles in
[55:31] wars."
[55:33] That's right. And somebody can win a
[55:35] battle, but it doesn't mean they
[55:37] prospered in the war. Yeah. So there
[55:40] might be battles in your life where you
[55:41] think, well, I've lost that battle. I've
[55:43] like listen, you may have lost a battle,
[55:46] but the weapon that is formed will never
[55:49] prosper. It will never complete its
[55:52] destination of destroying the bride
[55:55] church. Listen, this is the idea of it.
[55:57] Amen. Now, can can I just bring it to uh
[56:00] common terms? There's two halves in some
[56:02] ball games. You know, you take a take a
[56:03] football game, there's two halves in it.
[56:05] And there's a lot of times that people
[56:07] lose the first half, but it don't mean
[56:10] the game's over. They like going the
[56:13] dugout down, you know. There was a there
[56:14] was a there was a Can I tell a story?
[56:18] There was a there was a football game
[56:19] played one time with animals, you know,
[56:21] and there was uh giraffes and there was
[56:23] uh elephants and there was uh there was
[56:26] all kinds of animals and they were
[56:27] playing football and they were passing
[56:28] and they were going
[56:30] off and and and the side that had the
[56:33] the elephant and they had a giraffe and
[56:35] a reeba and they had a little group
[56:37] there, man, they was losing pretty bad.
[56:40] But they were just one guy short the
[56:43] whole time. just one guy wasn't on the
[56:44] field the whole time and they went in
[56:47] halftime and they were down pretty bad
[56:48] and when they come out after halftime
[56:51] there was a millipede that had
[56:55] been that's not farfetched you know
[56:57] there was a millipede ain't them
[56:59] millipedes the guy's got all them feet
[57:01] there was a millipede come out and
[57:04] somebody threw the ball and that
[57:05] millipede he caught the ball and he went
[57:07] running and man he could just take a
[57:10] leap and he could step on the head and
[57:11] step on the head and step a touchdown
[57:12] down and he'd run and he'd take a step,
[57:15] take a step, take a step, touchdown.
[57:17] They'd throw the ball and he'd take
[57:19] step, step, step, intercept, touchdown.
[57:21] Was it a little while until they just
[57:24] stomped that other team and at the end
[57:27] of the game they won the game, somebody
[57:28] come up and they said, "My goodness,
[57:30] first half of that looked like y'all
[57:32] were going to completely lose." But then
[57:35] that millipede showed up and somebody
[57:37] said, "Where was that millipede the
[57:38] whole time?" He said he was in the
[57:39] locker room. Said, "What was he doing?"
[57:41] and he said he was putting on his shoes.
[57:48] Well, I don't know. Maybe there's a
[57:50] situation in your life where it looks
[57:53] like that you have lost. I say put on
[57:55] your
[57:56] shoes. Put put your shoes on and pick
[58:00] your sword up and go to fighting. Said,
[58:04] "Preacher, what are you talking about?
[58:05] Slaves don't have shoes, but sons has
[58:08] got shoes." Amen. Amen. The sons of God
[58:11] wear shoes. The shoes of the preparation
[58:14] of the gospel. Amen. There's some Bible
[58:17] to it, folks. Peter was laying back
[58:19] there in the inner prison and the light
[58:21] of the Lord came in there. It looked
[58:23] like Peter had been defeated. But the
[58:25] spirit of the Lord knocked him on the
[58:28] side, said, "Wake up from what you're
[58:29] doing." And the chains begin to fall off
[58:32] of him. And he said, "Put your shoes on.
[58:35] You're going to leave this place." Let
[58:37] me tell you something tonight. You may
[58:39] be in a place of discouragement. You
[58:42] could be in a place of anxiety or
[58:44] depression. Put your shoes on. We're
[58:47] coming out of it. We're going to walk
[58:49] right out of it. We're going to walk out
[58:52] of the situation with the shoes of the
[58:55] gospel of Jesus Christ.
[59:00] Oh yeah.
[59:02] If you read above Isaiah 54:17, just
[59:05] read above it and it'll say, the Lord
[59:08] will say to him, it was a little wrath
[59:10] for a moment. I love the way the
[59:12] scripture says it, a little wrath. And
[59:15] then it'll say, but with great mercies.
[59:18] And then it'll say, but for a moment,
[59:20] and then it'll say with every We should
[59:22] read it, shouldn't we? You want to take
[59:24] a moment and read it? Isaiah 54. Read
[59:26] read back up there and read how he says
[59:27] it because it's real powerful. If you're
[59:29] a scripture, if you love your
[59:31] scriptures, look how he says that in
[59:33] Isaiah 54. Go to the seventh verse and
[59:35] watch him. He said, "For a small moment
[59:38] I have forsaken thee, but with great
[59:41] mercies I will gather thee." I love
[59:44] that. Don't you? In other words, amen.
[59:47] My attitude toward is you is love. I got
[59:52] mad at you last five
[59:54] minutes. I know nobody. I know nobody in
[59:58] here has ever got upset at their spouse
[1:00:00] and say, "I'm going
[1:00:02] to." None of y'all ever done that. I
[1:00:04] know you never You never got a little
[1:00:07] bit disturbed and said something you
[1:00:09] really didn't mean. You never had a
[1:00:12] brother or sister that you got upset at
[1:00:15] and said something that really wasn't
[1:00:17] your true attitude toward the person
[1:00:21] for a small moment.
[1:00:24] I have forsaken thee, but with great
[1:00:26] mercies
[1:00:27] I will gather thee. Watch this. In a
[1:00:30] little wrath
[1:00:32] I have hid my face from thee. For a
[1:00:35] moment, but with everlasting kindness
[1:00:38] will I have mercy.
[1:00:41] In other words, for a moment I was
[1:00:43] upset. For a moment I hid my face. For a
[1:00:47] moment you thought you were going to be
[1:00:49] destroyed. But right below it, he says,
[1:00:51] "No weapons shall prosper." In other
[1:00:54] words, you might be going through
[1:00:56] something that looks like you're going
[1:00:58] to be defeated. But it was just for a
[1:01:00] moment.
[1:01:02] It's just a moment. It happens for a
[1:01:04] moment. It is not your destination. Come
[1:01:08] on. It is not your dwelling place.
[1:01:10] Listen. Hey, man. I I tell you, the
[1:01:12] devil, he's stupid. You know, I studying
[1:01:15] today, brother Ben seen it. My computer
[1:01:18] literally has had took a mind of its
[1:01:19] own. I never seen anything like it. It
[1:01:21] started changing screens and going up
[1:01:22] and down and this and this and cursor
[1:01:24] and I was sitting there riding read
[1:01:25] reading Bibles and stuff and all of a
[1:01:27] sudden a a scripture flashed up on the
[1:01:29] right side and started blinking and it
[1:01:31] was out of the book of Job. And I had
[1:01:34] never tied together Isaiah 54 with Job.
[1:01:38] See, but for a
[1:01:40] moment, but for just a little while,
[1:01:45] just a little while. Job for a reason,
[1:01:48] for a situation. You're going through
[1:01:50] something, but there's a turning point
[1:01:52] in that situation.
[1:01:54] There's a there's a time where it looks
[1:01:56] like that Job was going to be destroyed,
[1:01:59] but then it turned
[1:02:02] and he got everything he lost back
[1:02:04] double
[1:02:06] because the enemy couldn't prosper
[1:02:08] against him. You know why he couldn't
[1:02:10] prosper? Because God wouldn't let him
[1:02:12] take his life. That's right. See, see
[1:02:15] the game would go long enough for the
[1:02:18] change to come. He wouldn't let him take
[1:02:21] his life. I was just hearing the other
[1:02:23] day, I don't know, sometimes I read I
[1:02:24] read the Bible. I listen to the Bible.
[1:02:26] Just listen. And I was listening to the
[1:02:27] story of Joseph and I heard something on
[1:02:30] it that really piqu my interest is when
[1:02:32] they took Joseph and the Bible said they
[1:02:34] got angry at him. Now, you know, there's
[1:02:36] a lot there, but they got angry at
[1:02:38] Joseph. Can I just say why they got
[1:02:40] angry at him? They got angry at him
[1:02:42] because God blessed him. That was the
[1:02:44] only, you know, but but Joseph didn't
[1:02:47] help anything. He told these dreams how
[1:02:49] he was going to lead, you know, and and
[1:02:51] they didn't like that at all. And he
[1:02:53] started telling these dreams what God
[1:02:54] was doing. And they decided, we'll rid
[1:02:57] ourselves of this man. Yeah. And they
[1:03:00] threw him in the pit. But the dream, the
[1:03:03] direction happened before the experience
[1:03:05] in the pit. But when they threw him in
[1:03:08] the pit, the intent of them was to
[1:03:10] destroy him, to get them out of their
[1:03:12] sight. But when they threw him in, hey
[1:03:14] man, there was one of the brothers said,
[1:03:17] "Don't take his life."
[1:03:20] I thought that's odd. Over there in Job,
[1:03:24] you can try him, but don't take his
[1:03:26] life. Over here in Joseph, you can put
[1:03:29] him through the trial, but don't take
[1:03:31] his life. Amen. And he heard that in the
[1:03:34] pit that he was in. Listen, let me tell
[1:03:36] you something. But God was going to get
[1:03:38] him out of the pit.
[1:03:41] But God was going to get him out of the
[1:03:42] pit. Can I say to you tonight, I don't
[1:03:44] know what picture is, but God's going to
[1:03:46] get you out of the pit. Amen. God's
[1:03:49] going to It's just for a moment, but
[1:03:52] there's a vision of your victory and
[1:03:55] it's already out in front of you. You're
[1:03:57] a Joseph tonight. I'll tell you why. No
[1:04:00] weapon against you can prosper. I'll
[1:04:02] tell you why. Because you are the son of
[1:04:05] prosperity. Because the word of God has
[1:04:08] said all things, somebody say all things
[1:04:11] work together for the good of them that
[1:04:13] are called of God. I am a son of
[1:04:17] prosperity. The devil will never prosper
[1:04:20] against me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I
[1:04:24] tell you what you can do. You can start
[1:04:26] shouting right now. You're going to
[1:04:28] prosper. The devil's going to come, but
[1:04:30] you're going to prosper. You can get in
[1:04:32] a pit, but God's going to get you out.
[1:04:35] I'm glad tonight to know he's got an arm
[1:04:37] that's not short and he's got an ear
[1:04:40] that's not heavy.
[1:04:42] Amen. Somebody sitting here tonight
[1:04:43] said, "Brother Wayne, what are you
[1:04:44] saying?" I'm saying it's a temporary.
[1:04:46] It's a moment. It's temporary. No
[1:04:48] weapon's going to prosper. I don't care
[1:04:50] how dark it looks. You're coming out of
[1:04:52] the pit cuz you're going to go to the
[1:04:54] throne. You're going to come out of the
[1:04:56] darkness cuz you're going to the light.
[1:04:58] I tell you, the Bible says it. You know,
[1:05:00] it says it in Corinthians. Paul says it.
[1:05:02] He said, "But these moments of
[1:05:05] affliction, these temporary things
[1:05:07] workketh but for a moment."
[1:05:11] And they're not to be compared with the
[1:05:13] eternal glory that God has for you. It's
[1:05:16] just for a moment. If it lasts for 5
[1:05:18] days, it's just a moment. If it lasts
[1:05:21] for 10 miles, it's just a moment. You're
[1:05:24] going to come out of it, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:05:28] I believe it. said, "Preacher, well,
[1:05:30] I'll tell you what I'm talking about."
[1:05:32] In Proverbs, it says it. He said,
[1:05:34] "Listen," he said, he said, "the night
[1:05:38] comes." He says, "But listen,
[1:05:42] sorrow. It only endureth for the night."
[1:05:46] Right?
[1:05:49] Darkness will not prosper. It will not
[1:05:51] get its desire to shut out your world
[1:05:55] into darkness. It won't It won't happen.
[1:05:57] Uhhuh. Because joy is coming in the
[1:05:59] morning. Yes, sir.
[1:06:02] And one time I studied the scripture and
[1:06:04] I got to thinking about this like you
[1:06:06] have a house, you know, and let's just
[1:06:08] say you got one guest bed and you and
[1:06:11] you know you go and I don't know how
[1:06:14] else to say it, but maybe I don't we
[1:06:16] isn't we got any nancies in
[1:06:17] here? No. But no nies. I don't think we
[1:06:21] got any nies. Negative Nies coming to
[1:06:24] stay the night with you.
[1:06:30] If your name's Nancy, I'm
[1:06:32] sorry. Negative. Nancy's coming to stay
[1:06:34] the night with you and you know she's
[1:06:36] coming, but before she can get there,
[1:06:38] you just got one bed. You make good
[1:06:41] arrangements
[1:06:42] with somebody else to show up the next
[1:06:46] day. So, you have a pre-arranged
[1:06:50] appointment that when negativity shows
[1:06:53] up to stay the night,
[1:06:55] you can tell it. and say, "Hey, you can
[1:06:56] stay
[1:06:57] tonight, but I got joy coming in the
[1:07:00] morning.
[1:07:03] You can hang around a little while, but
[1:07:05] you can't take residence.
[1:07:08] You might stay the night, but joy is
[1:07:11] coming in the morning. It only endureth
[1:07:14] for a night." Listen, I want you to lift
[1:07:16] up your head. It only stays for a night,
[1:07:19] but joy, it cometh in the morning.
[1:07:24] I tell you, you know, Brother Ram said
[1:07:26] it. He said back in the days of those
[1:07:28] slaves, he said in that emancipation
[1:07:30] proclamation, he said, "Oh," he said
[1:07:32] they'd climb high on the mountain at the
[1:07:35] at the daylight. Remember that? He climb
[1:07:36] high on the mountain for the sun to
[1:07:38] rise. Remember that? Yeah. And he said a
[1:07:41] strong would climb up where they could
[1:07:43] see the light, right? Where they could
[1:07:45] climb above the fields. They could climb
[1:07:47] above everything. get up in a high place
[1:07:50] that they could see the first rays of
[1:07:52] the morning. Of course, he's talking
[1:07:54] about the message, but let me talk about
[1:07:56] your situation. Let me say that I I've
[1:08:00] been on the mountain today. I've been up
[1:08:02] there up on that mountain and I see the
[1:08:05] light coming. I see the light breaking.
[1:08:08] There's a light coming. You said,
[1:08:09] "Preacher, what are you saying?" Amen.
[1:08:11] The Bible said, "Watchmen, what are the
[1:08:13] night?" He said, "The night cometh, but
[1:08:15] the morning cometh also.
[1:08:19] Oh, I know the night
[1:08:22] cometh, but the morning it cometh also.
[1:08:26] And our musicians come tonight. No
[1:08:29] weapon. Amen. No weapon.
[1:08:33] Won't you think about what the enemy is
[1:08:35] fighting with you tonight? No weapon.
[1:08:37] Hallelujah.
[1:08:38] No weapon shall prosper. Said,
[1:08:40] "Preacher, what are you doing?" I'm
[1:08:42] putting on my shoes.
[1:08:47] You ever been late for the
[1:08:49] fight? You've been hanging out in the
[1:08:51] locker room. Put your shoes on. There's
[1:08:55] a battle
[1:08:57] on. Christian soldiers, press the
[1:08:59] battle. Amen. Poster
[1:09:04] duties. Draw your swords.
[1:09:08] [Music]
[1:09:09] The enemy comes like a
[1:09:12] flood, but the spirit of God,
[1:09:16] it raises a standard. Maybe you've been
[1:09:19] noticing some unusual
[1:09:21] battles in your life. I tell you what
[1:09:24] it's
[1:09:27] about. You got camp
[1:09:31] coming. Camp's coming. Let me let me
[1:09:34] tell you something.
[1:09:36] You remember you remember that old that
[1:09:37] old song where somebody preached a
[1:09:39] famous sermon years ago. It's Friday,
[1:09:42] Sunday's coming.
[1:09:47] What you what you have to do is you have
[1:09:48] to see what's behind things.
[1:09:52] You see what Satan's up to
[1:09:55] trying to disturb,
[1:09:58] testing every corner.
[1:10:06] Well, it just comes for a night
[1:10:10] with joy.
[1:10:14] Just a
[1:10:15] moment. Just a little
[1:10:19] wrath. I hid my face for a moment.
[1:10:23] Don't be discouraged.
[1:10:25] That's good. Don't be discouraged. It
[1:10:28] was a moment, but my covenant with you
[1:10:31] is everlasting.
[1:10:34] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:10:37] His anger endureth. If you read that
[1:10:40] again, it actually separates it again in
[1:10:42] the scripture in Proverbs, the joy
[1:10:43] cometh in the morning. A
[1:10:46] little, and he said, but his life, his
[1:10:49] favor is
[1:10:51] life. So, a
[1:10:54] little, but there's something coming
[1:10:56] behind it.
[1:10:58] It's a joy.
[1:11:00] It's a success.
[1:11:03] Satan going to prosper.
[1:11:07] The word of God is against him.
[1:11:10] Sister Rachel, get up in the morning.
[1:11:12] Put your feet on the ground. Say, "Here,
[1:11:14] kitty kitty."
[1:11:20] So, brother Wayne, you making fun of the
[1:11:22] devil? I am.
[1:11:26] I am.
[1:11:28] He ain't nothing but a bluff.
[1:11:33] Jesus whipped him at Calvary.
[1:11:37] He ain't scared of me.
[1:11:40] But he's scared of the one I represent.
[1:11:45] Won't you stand to your feet with me
[1:11:46] tonight?
[1:11:50] Press. Press the battle. Amen. Press the
[1:11:56] battle
[1:11:59] tonight. Let's just bow our hearts.
[1:12:02] Almighty God, we've come to you tonight
[1:12:04] in this
[1:12:06] service and Father, we have read in your
[1:12:08] word and we have encouraged
[1:12:10] ourselves hearing the prophecy of these
[1:12:14] scriptures. Lord, we put our shoes on
[1:12:19] tonight. Lord, we got a sword in our
[1:12:21] hand. Your children have gathered for
[1:12:24] the battle, Lord, and they're ready to
[1:12:27] press. Some of them have needs tonight
[1:12:29] in their bodies, in their homes, and
[1:12:31] their families. And Lord Jesus, I pray
[1:12:34] tonight, Father, as they pull their
[1:12:37] sword. Lord, may they lead tonight with
[1:12:40] blood on their
[1:12:41] sword. May the enemy suffer tonight from
[1:12:44] the belief and the faith that drops into
[1:12:46] their heart. He's lied to some of them
[1:12:49] and told them that what has come has
[1:12:51] come to stay.
[1:12:53] But it ain't come to
[1:12:55] stay. It's just for a
[1:12:58] moment. Father, I thank you tonight and
[1:13:01] I ask you to bless this congregation.
[1:13:03] May you strengthen them, encourage them,
[1:13:05] Lord. Give them strength for the battle.
[1:13:07] Father, I pray in the name of Jesus.
[1:13:13] You know,
[1:13:16] [Music]
[1:13:21] David went down into that
[1:13:25] valley and he cut the head of that
[1:13:28] Goliath off with his own
[1:13:34] sword. Do you know the Bible said that
[1:13:36] he drugged the head of Goliath back to
[1:13:38] the city of Jerusalem?
[1:13:41] and he hung it up on a pole. Yeah.
[1:13:46] Cuz he wanted everybody to know the head
[1:13:48] of Goliath was hanging.
[1:13:51] Me and Timothy Puit used to used to
[1:13:53] laugh. He'd send me a text every now and
[1:13:55] go and he'll say, "Skull drag that
[1:13:56] devil."
[1:13:58] What that means is get the get get it
[1:14:00] get your Goliath by the head, right? And
[1:14:04] drag him somewhere, right? and put him
[1:14:06] up on a pole and say, "This is the thing
[1:14:09] that haunted me, but it won't haunt me
[1:14:12] no more."
[1:14:15] Come on.
[1:14:16] I know
[1:14:17] Satan, but Darren, Satan creates perfect
[1:14:21] traps. He creates perfect
[1:14:23] storms. That's exactly what happened
[1:14:25] with
[1:14:26] Pharaoh and the children of Israel. It
[1:14:29] was a perfect trap. Mountains on both
[1:14:32] sides, sea in front, enemy behind.
[1:14:36] Perfectly trapped.
[1:14:39] But who was trapped?
[1:14:41] [Music]
[1:14:43] Who was trapped? Was it the believer or
[1:14:45] was it the devil?
[1:14:47] God led them into that place to destroy
[1:14:51] their enemy. And it may look like you're
[1:14:54] surrounded. It may look like there's no
[1:14:56] way out, but God has designed this to
[1:14:58] get that enemy in that place.
[1:15:01] [Applause]
[1:15:04] Yes sir. Yes sir. The children of the
[1:15:07] living God. Go ahead. Brother man weapon
[1:15:10] may be for money but it won't
[1:15:15] [Music]
[1:15:20] prosper won't prevail.
[1:15:25] The God I serve knows only how to
[1:15:33] triumph. My God will never
[1:15:40] f Oh my God will never
[1:15:47] f I'm going to see a victory. Heat.
[1:15:51] Heat.
[1:15:53] [Applause]
[1:15:56] [Music]
[1:16:04] I'm going to see a
[1:16:07] victory. I'm going to see a victory.
[1:16:20] [Music]
