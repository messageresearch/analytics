[37:53] [Music]
[38:00] arms that will raise
[38:04] a voice
[38:07] [Music]
[38:25] i've got to
[38:27] praise him

[38:36] [Music]
[38:56] may the congregation rise please

[39:43] [Music]
[40:03] [Applause]
[40:04] [Music]
[40:15] who give it this woman to be married to
[40:17] this man
[40:20] amen
[40:33] congregation may be seated
[40:47] we appreciate everybody coming and being
[40:50] a
[40:50] witness of this great event in this
[40:53] couple's life
[40:56] they're turning the corner both of them
[41:00] not only in their natural life their
[41:02] christian life
[41:04] and so we thank god how he orchestrates
[41:09] marriage and how he orchestrates a
[41:11] couple coming together
[41:14] many times of different
[41:17] maybe nationalities or whatever it might
[41:19] be different walks of life
[41:22] different situations in their lives
[41:25] but today i can as a pastor as a
[41:28] minister of the gospel
[41:30] i can say
[41:32] with all my heart that i'm uniting a man
[41:36] and a woman
[41:37] that both have the holy ghost
[41:40] and both have
[41:41] the word of god as their absolute
[41:44] and so we appreciate that we can uh
[41:47] marry them with confidence
[41:49] that this marriage will hold
[41:52] because they will be searching the word
[41:53] for answers
[41:55] and their livelihood and their leading
[41:57] and their guiding
[41:59] so we thank god
[42:01] brother
[42:02] john david
[42:05] sister hannah
[42:07] we thank god for both of you
[42:10] and we thank god for all the friends you
[42:12] have
[42:13] all the brothers and sisters in christ
[42:15] all the beautiful family
[42:17] i see some from out of state i
[42:19] i heard way away from idaho i believe
[42:21] are utah
[42:23] there's come to be a blessing
[42:27] in this marriage
[42:34] in a believer's life
[42:39] it's already pre-planned
[42:42] by an almighty god that they serve
[42:47] and so he already knew the end from the
[42:50] beginning
[42:52] he knew that these two would eventually
[42:54] meet
[42:56] and they would fall in love
[42:59] but that's just a part of filial love
[43:03] but in this love is more than just feel
[43:06] your love feel your love can come and it
[43:08] can go
[43:10] it can compromise
[43:12] it can give up
[43:15] it doesn't sometimes feel your love does
[43:17] not make a commitment
[43:19] but because these two are believers in
[43:21] jesus christ that is the same yesterday
[43:24] today and forever
[43:26] that they can put their lives
[43:28] into the promised word of god
[43:31] and live by thus saith the lord
[43:34] not by all the emotions
[43:36] not by their own thinking or reasoning
[43:40] but taking it back to the bible in the
[43:42] message of the hour
[43:44] and getting an answer
[43:46] i want to say to you both
[43:49] life is not a dream
[43:51] marriage is not a dream
[43:55] but it's a reality
[43:58] it's a reality of growing
[44:00] together
[44:02] in the love of christ
[44:04] and believe me
[44:06] i know your trust
[44:07] in the living god
[44:09] so we appreciate that
[44:11] so much today
[44:14] your love
[44:16] that you have for each other and the
[44:18] love you have for christ
[44:20] nothing will separate you
[44:23] nothing will separate you
[44:25] at all
[44:27] this marriage i believe
[44:30] was orchestrated before the foundation
[44:32] of the world
[44:33] amen no man put it together no man can
[44:36] take it down
[44:38] because jesus christ is here in our
[44:40] midst his presence is with us
[44:43] today
[44:45] that you can take these vows
[44:47] that you're going to exchange and
[44:50] knowing that you mean it from your heart
[44:53] and you'll stand by them
[44:55] through sickness
[44:56] through death
[44:59] through riches through poor
[45:01] you will stay together in the love of
[45:04] jesus christ
[45:07] i say to you
[45:09] to these people that are here as
[45:11] witnesses
[45:15] that your prayers
[45:17] be greatly appreciated
[45:20] for these two people
[45:23] that are no longer going to become rb2
[45:26] but to be joined as one
[45:34] no marriage would be a
[45:36] complete without reading a scripture
[45:39] which is very familiar to us
[45:42] wives submit yourselves
[45:45] onto your own husbands is unto the lord
[45:48] for the husband is the head of wife even
[45:50] as christ
[45:52] is the head of the church and he is the
[45:54] savior of the body
[45:57] therefore the church is subject under
[45:59] christ
[46:00] so let the wise be to their own husbands
[46:03] and everything
[46:05] husbands
[46:06] love your wives even as christ also
[46:08] loved the church
[46:10] and gave himself for him
[46:12] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[46:15] with the washing of the water by the
[46:17] word
[46:19] that he might present it to himself a
[46:20] glorious church
[46:23] not having spot or wrinkle
[46:25] or any such
[46:26] thing that it should be holy
[46:29] without blemish
[46:32] so on men to love their wives as their
[46:33] own bodies
[46:35] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[46:39] for no man ever hated yet hated his own
[46:42] flesh
[46:43] but nourished it and cherished it even
[46:46] as the lord the church
[46:48] for we are members of his body
[46:51] and of his flesh and of his bones
[46:53] with his cause shall a man leave his
[46:55] father and mother
[46:57] shall be joined unto his wife
[46:59] and they too shall be
[47:01] one flesh
[47:03] this is a great mystery
[47:05] but i speak concerning christ and the
[47:07] church
[47:09] nevertheless let everyone in particular
[47:12] so love his wife even as himself
[47:15] and the wife see that she
[47:17] reverence her husband
[47:22] i know in many of the marriages that i
[47:23] perform
[47:25] i read this
[47:27] quote from the kinsmen redeemer those
[47:29] that are familiar with the message
[47:33] because i think it's so fitting
[47:36] hatred had a beginning
[47:39] so it has to have an end
[47:42] love had no beginning
[47:44] so it has no end
[47:47] hatred is forever
[47:49] love is
[47:50] eternal hatred begins
[47:53] and hatred will be will end
[47:56] love never did begin
[47:59] and it'll never end
[48:02] it was
[48:04] always
[48:05] eternal
[48:06] amen and when a man loves a woman
[48:09] and marries her because she's pretty
[48:12] there'll be an end to that
[48:14] but when the man finds a woman that he
[48:16] loves he don't know why
[48:18] but he loves her
[48:20] and she finds a man she loves
[48:23] no matter what he looks like like he
[48:25] loves her
[48:26] she loves him
[48:28] that's eternal
[48:30] made in glory
[48:32] death
[48:33] nor nothing else can ever separate them
[48:37] because they are
[48:38] from eternity
[48:40] and they stepped out into a space of
[48:42] time
[48:43] and will return back to eternity
[48:47] eternity has dropped down in a body
[48:50] called time
[48:52] then goes right back up into eternity
[48:54] again
[48:56] it cannot perish
[48:59] another quote
[49:02] but the man makes it
[49:04] so clear
[49:06] that outside of salvation
[49:08] there couldn't be a greater gift
[49:11] than a godly wife
[49:13] so brother john david
[49:16] you're getting a godly wife
[49:19] she said under my ministry i think for
[49:21] 12 years i've seen her character
[49:25] i've seen her life dedicated to people
[49:28] she'll dedicate her life to you brother
[49:30] john
[49:31] brother john you're a real man of god
[49:34] you may not speak loudly
[49:37] but your life
[49:38] is what counts
[49:40] so i want to say to you
[49:42] god loves you
[49:44] god cares for you
[49:46] and he'll make it all work
[49:48] for his glory
[49:50] so we see here another quote
[49:53] notice
[49:54] there is nothing that god could give a
[49:56] man
[49:57] outside of salvation better than a nice
[50:00] wife
[50:01] there is no man that can console a
[50:04] person
[50:05] when they're tired they won't confine
[50:07] anyone like they do their own wife
[50:10] what a fortunate thing your brothers are
[50:12] when you've got a nice little wife
[50:14] that's clean
[50:15] and upright
[50:16] and moral
[50:18] and you can come in when you're tired
[50:20] and weary
[50:21] and sit down
[50:23] and she can talk to you
[50:25] she can do more for you than anybody
[50:27] else
[50:28] that's right
[50:30] she's your jewel
[50:32] she
[50:33] is your queen
[50:35] we thank god
[50:37] we thank god for both you
[50:40] and we love you in the lord jesus
[50:43] and we know that eternity
[50:46] will spell this all out one day
[50:48] how this really came about
[50:51] amen
[51:31] [Music]
[51:40] it was a day
[51:42] in early springtime
[51:46] [Music]
[51:52] to rest his camel train
[51:57] he had found a bride for isaac
[52:02] near the evening shadows fell
[52:06] for his weary journey had not been in
[52:10] vain

[52:36] fair
[52:37] oh it must have been a happy wedding day

[52:54] don't you hear the aliens

[55:06] hey
[55:20] before i go into the wedding vows and
[55:23] exchanging the rings sister hannah

[55:27] what brother bannon spoke in
[55:30] one of his
[55:31] marriage ceremonies
[55:33] we are gathered here together in the
[55:34] sight of god
[55:37] in the face of this company
[55:40] to join together this man and woman in
[55:42] holy matrimony
[55:44] which is commanded by saint paul to be
[55:46] honorable among all men
[55:49] it is therefore not
[55:51] by any to be entered into in
[55:54] advan inadvisedly or lightly but

[56:34] couples that are joined otherwise
