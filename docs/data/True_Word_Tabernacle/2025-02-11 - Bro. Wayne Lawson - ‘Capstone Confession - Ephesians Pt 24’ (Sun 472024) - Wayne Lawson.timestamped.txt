[6:18] I'm going to be in Ephesians chapter 4 I
[6:21] want to uh read here in the 11th to the
[6:23] 15th
[6:25] verse amen Ephesians chapter 4 I want to
[6:29] speak 11 to verse
[6:41] 15 and he gave some Apostles and some
[6:45] prophets some
[6:47] evangelist some pastors and
[6:51] teachers for the perfecting of the
[6:54] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[6:57] the edifying of the body of Christ
[7:00] till we all come into the unity of the
[7:02] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[7:05] God unto a perfect man now that perfect
[7:09] man is measured unto the measure of the
[7:13] Statue of the fullness of
[7:15] Christ that we
[7:17] henceforth be no more children now we
[7:21] have a Greek word for that in Spanish as
[7:27] well and uh but don't be be tossed to
[7:30] and fro and carried about by every wind
[7:34] of
[7:35] Doctrine by the slight of man and the
[7:38] cunning craftiness whereby they lay lie
[7:42] in wait to deceive now what he says is
[7:45] don't be children anymore tossed around
[7:47] can I just say it by
[7:50] lies and by the slide of man and by
[7:53] cunning
[7:54] craftiness amen that weight to deceive
[7:56] us but speaking the truth and love I
[7:58] love how he places this don't
[8:02] lie speak the truth in love that we may
[8:07] grow up into him in all things which is
[8:10] the head even Christ amen we ask the
[8:13] Lord to bless his word as you could be
[8:15] seated this
[8:16] morning I want to uh if I can uh just
[8:20] take a just a a couple moments here Amen
[8:23] in this scripture and I want to speak to
[8:24] you today on Capstone confessions
[8:27] Capstone confessions amen uh this last
[8:30] verse here speaking truth and love it
[8:32] just uh I was going to continue on but
[8:34] it I just have some things here that I
[8:36] want to I want to stick with for uh this
[8:38] service if we can amen uh speaking the
[8:41] truth and love I want to talk about
[8:43] Capstone confessions amen uh here Paul
[8:46] is telling the church to not be children
[8:49] now we know what he's speaking of he's
[8:52] not speaking of uh of of Christian and
[8:54] not Christian he's talking about mature
[8:57] Christians and baby Christians he he's
[8:59] very simple in his saying you got to go
[9:02] back into the Greek to find it but when
[9:04] he says perfecting Saints it's what made
[9:06] me think of it he said perfecting Saints
[9:08] is is and I thought oh my how you going
[9:10] to perfect Perfection uh the Saints
[9:13] already been perfect brother Bram makes
[9:14] a big a big point out of the Ephesian
[9:17] book that it was to the Saints which are
[9:19] in Ephesus which those which already are
[9:21] in Christ so how would you perfect
[9:24] perfect people other than realizing that
[9:26] it was a spiritual growth and the
[9:29] prophet then of course tells us about
[9:31] the growth or the equipping of the
[9:33] saints of God equipping them in the in
[9:35] the things which they need for this age
[9:37] so when he speaks about this he speaking
[9:39] about not being uh children but rather
[9:42] being adults in in the word and and we
[9:45] know uh that this not being children not
[9:48] speaking lies amen and anything that is
[9:51] contrary to the word is a
[9:54] lie that's right see it's anything
[9:56] contrary to the word that that is a lion
[9:59] how to recognize a li now the thing that
[10:02] we are dealing with this morning is that
[10:04] we have found and and what has been
[10:06] brought to us is has brought us to a
[10:10] perfect word now I love how the prophet
[10:12] says this amen I want to read something
[10:14] here from Paul 1 Corinthians 13:10 but
[10:18] when that which is perfect has come then
[10:21] that which is in part shall be done away
[10:23] with amen that when the maturity is come
[10:25] amen then that which is in part shall be
[10:27] done away now when I was a child I spake
[10:31] as a child and I understood as a child
[10:34] and I thought as a child but when I
[10:36] became a man I put away childish things
[10:40] amen for now we see through a glass
[10:43] Darkly but then face to face for we know
[10:47] I know in part but then shall I know
[10:50] even also am I known nowen Paul is
[10:54] definitely pointing to the idea that
[10:56] there's coming something in the future
[10:58] that's going to reveal and give to
[11:01] knowledge the people of God who they are
[11:04] in God he's saying there's coming a time
[11:06] that you're going to know the way you're
[11:08] known in other words God knows something
[11:10] about you has something in his heart
[11:12] about you has something in his knowledge
[11:14] about you that you don't know but
[11:17] there's coming a time that when you
[11:19] won't look through a glass Darkly amen
[11:22] but you're going to see him now
[11:24] Corinthians tells us we're going to see
[11:26] him an unobscured view of the word of
[11:29] God and when we look into the face of
[11:31] that it's going to change us and it's
[11:33] going to change us from Glory unto glory
[11:36] amen I believe that this morning I don't
[11:38] believe we change the word I believe the
[11:40] word changes us and as we look into the
[11:43] unobscured face of our Lord Jesus Christ
[11:46] and we see the great image and we
[11:48] recognize who we are in him now that is
[11:51] the Perfection amen of course that we're
[11:53] talking about in the message perfect
[11:55] faith brother bandam tells us this that
[11:57] nearly 2,000 years God God has been
[12:00] making himself a masterpiece amen he
[12:02] struck Adam and get a piece off of him
[12:05] and a rib to make a wife and now that
[12:07] perfect Masterpiece that he struck at
[12:09] Calvary he's got a piece off of him and
[12:12] it's just the New Testament that's all
[12:14] he fulfilled the Old
[12:16] Testament now it's the New Testament and
[12:19] another piece to be fulfilled see the
[12:22] new and the old is husband and wife see
[12:26] the old to foreshadow the new Christ has
[12:29] come the Masterpiece to fulfill that now
[12:33] his bride will fulfill everything that's
[12:35] in the New Testament amen another
[12:38] Masterpiece in the making and it tooken
[12:41] him 4,000 years to make that Masterpiece
[12:44] he said now 2,000 years he's making
[12:47] another Masterpiece a bride for Christ
[12:50] another Masterpiece in so doing he he
[12:53] does it in his never changing method the
[12:56] same way he made the masterpiece his
[12:59] word and that's the way he makes his
[13:01] masterpieces because he can only be
[13:04] perfect Masterpiece when it's a perfect
[13:07] word do you believe he was a perfect
[13:10] Masterpiece because he was the
[13:12] Fulfillment of the Old Testament then
[13:14] this bride church will be a perfect
[13:16] Masterpiece because she's the
[13:18] Fulfillment of the New Testament just as
[13:21] he stepped out of the Book of Genesis
[13:23] and the book of Isaiah and the Book of
[13:25] Malachi and the Book of Ezekiel so does
[13:28] the bride step out of the New Testament
[13:30] prophecies and what he fulfilled in his
[13:33] time the Church of the Living God will
[13:35] fulfill in her time because she is the
[13:38] perfect manifestation of the Fulfillment
[13:41] of almighty God Jesus tells us in
[13:43] questions and answers Amen brother bam
[13:46] says it like this he said I I go to
[13:48] prepare a place for you amen and I'll
[13:50] come again and receive you unto myself
[13:52] he said there amen there's many mansions
[13:55] in my father's house is that right and
[13:58] brother B said see the father's house
[14:00] I'll go and prepare a place for you take
[14:02] you out of this pest house and deliver
[14:04] you into my father's house there you are
[14:07] take you out of this old Earthly pest
[14:09] house he's going to prepare a place
[14:11] it'll be a perfect place where no evil
[14:14] exist where no sickness exist we no old
[14:17] age exist we no death exist it's a
[14:21] perfect place and it's calling you to
[14:25] that Perfection and you have to be
[14:28] perfect to get there and the Bible said
[14:30] so be ye perfect even as your father in
[14:33] Heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom
[14:36] so it must be a perfect people come
[14:38] because you have to stand to be married
[14:40] to a perfect Son of God and you must be
[14:43] a perfect bride and how are you going to
[14:46] do it through anything else but the
[14:49] perfect word of God Amen there is no way
[14:52] for this bride to do this outside of the
[14:56] perfect word of God listen I I want to
[14:58] make make a a declaration to you and I
[15:01] know many of you know it but I want you
[15:02] to hear it again this morning amen we
[15:05] already have the perfect interpretation
[15:09] to the perfect word of God Amen we are
[15:11] not waiting this morning the Bible said
[15:14] them that wait on the Lord shall renew
[15:16] their strength and they shall rise up as
[15:18] Eagles and amen now that's what he says
[15:20] when they that wait on the lord well
[15:22] listen we're not waiting this morning
[15:24] amen we are not waiting because we have
[15:26] already received of the Lord amen I
[15:29] believe we ought to F like eagles this
[15:31] morning I believe we ought to walk and
[15:33] not be weary this morning we have
[15:35] received a perfect word from the perfect
[15:38] God about who we are where we're going
[15:41] what we are doing amen I say the devil
[15:44] is a liar and he's put so many lies out
[15:47] to the age to try to deceive amen and to
[15:50] bring people under captivity amen but
[15:53] there is a bride who is alive this
[15:55] morning and there's a perfect word on
[15:57] the inside of her
[15:59] amen I believe it this morning you won't
[16:01] get there any other way than the perfect
[16:03] word of God and the prophet of God said
[16:06] we do have today by God's help the
[16:09] perfect interpretation of the word with
[16:12] Divine Vindication oh you don't know
[16:15] what that means to have a perfect word
[16:18] and not just the word of a man but a
[16:20] perfect Vindication of the word that was
[16:23] spoken amen this word never came amen
[16:27] amen just by the man William brandom it
[16:30] came from the Creator himself this is
[16:33] not the fleshly mind of a man this is
[16:36] the quickening power of almighty God
[16:40] that has told us of the generations and
[16:42] where we live we're talking about the
[16:44] perfect word now listen I know this
[16:46] morning that that perfect word came to
[16:49] the church and the prophet of God tells
[16:51] us in the loudan age he tells us that
[16:53] the age is not yet over he said and
[16:56] we're going to have a messenger that
[16:58] will reveal the mysteries of God is
[16:59] revealed to Paul he will speak out and
[17:02] those that receive that prophet in his
[17:05] own name will receive the beneficient
[17:08] effect of that prophet's
[17:11] Ministry and y'all know brother Ram told
[17:13] us that when we saw that Ministry he
[17:16] said however you judge it is the reward
[17:18] you get from it he said if you look at
[17:20] this and you see the devil you'll get
[17:23] the devil's reward he said if you look
[17:25] at this and you see it as God you'll get
[17:27] God's reward I believe we can say this
[17:30] morning that we've been rewarded I I
[17:32] believe that I believe we've seen the
[17:34] benefici and effect of this message we
[17:37] have seen God benefit our families he
[17:40] has benefited our lives he has benefited
[17:42] our Ministries amen I believe we've had
[17:46] a benefit of this message in our lives I
[17:49] certainly believe it I I come from a
[17:51] family around this message from
[17:52] Jonesboro all the way back in 1947 so
[17:55] when I talk to you about the message
[17:57] it's not just things that I read or even
[17:59] my personal experiences but a
[18:01] grandfather and grandmother on both
[18:03] sides of my family mine and my wife amen
[18:07] were there in the meetings back in the
[18:09] early years in the 40s and they saw
[18:11] these things and they saw them happening
[18:13] my personal family has saw both sides of
[18:15] this message I had an aunt that was been
[18:18] on one of the sides she was a
[18:20] Pentecostal woman and she had epileps or
[18:23] she didn't have epilepsia she went to
[18:24] the meetings and wanted to get in the
[18:26] prayer line for something and she wasn't
[18:28] able to get in the prayer line and she
[18:30] got angry at brother brandham and she
[18:31] sat there with a hard spirit and brother
[18:33] brandom said I'm going to cast out this
[18:35] Spirit of epilepsy and you're going to
[18:37] close your eyes and humble yourself now
[18:39] I'm going to I'm going to release this
[18:41] thing in the congregation and brother B
[18:43] said when he C Cast that Spirit out you
[18:46] heard him say it many times I'm not
[18:48] responsible for where it goes reverence
[18:50] yourself humble yourself bow your head
[18:52] close your eyes this thing's going to
[18:54] leave here and it's going to want to go
[18:55] somewhere I had an aunt sitting there
[18:57] that refused to her head she wouldn't
[19:00] close her eyes she had a hard Spirit
[19:02] watching what was happening and that
[19:04] epilepsy left that kid and went right
[19:06] into her and she died having epileptic
[19:09] fits years later amen because of the
[19:12] effect she had when she come in the
[19:14] message let me say something to you this
[19:15] morning this message will affect your
[19:17] life this message you cannot ever come
[19:20] into this message and it not affect your
[19:23] life somehow either it's going to bring
[19:25] great reward and great benefit amen or
[19:28] it will bring bring judgment to you at a
[19:30] latter time amen but there was another
[19:32] part of my family that saw the Miracles
[19:35] they saw the power of God my my great
[19:39] uncle Henry darus was a Pentecostal
[19:41] preacher had a great big church had a
[19:42] lot of women preachers he went there and
[19:44] heard brother brandham he'd come back
[19:46] they actually thought he was a a prophet
[19:48] CU he'd see visions and have some dreams
[19:49] and and they really pushing him as a
[19:51] prophet amen he come home he told his
[19:53] church he said look I'm no prophet he
[19:55] said but I've met one down there amen
[19:58] and he's fulfilling Malachi 4 and he's
[20:00] fulfilling behold I send unto you Elijah
[20:03] these men had the Revelation that it was
[20:05] Elijah before brother brandham ever told
[20:08] the congregations in 1960 brother
[20:10] brandham he started telling that Elijah
[20:13] was to return before 1960 he wasn't
[20:16] saying it publicly but we had an uncle
[20:19] who already knew he was Elijah before he
[20:22] ever even told the world because they
[20:25] took the message and it had a
[20:26] beneficient effect and to they I have
[20:29] been affected by the message of the hour
[20:32] because see see it's how you receive the
[20:35] message it's how that it will affect you
[20:37] as's a beneficient effect of this
[20:39] prophet's Ministry amen and what is that
[20:42] great benefit they will hear him and be
[20:45] blessed and become a part of that Bride

[21:35] different than allmighty God but because
[21:38] there has been a prophet Among Us you
[21:41] can say exactly what God says you can

[22:08] prophet spoke the bride amen and the
[22:10] Bible has already said it I don't
[22:12] believe this morning that we are at the
[22:14] doors of dogmas and Creeds we have been
[22:16] called into the land of a perfect word
[22:19] by A Perfect manifestation do you see
[22:22] God is send a Vindicated Prophet sending
[22:25] a prophet after 2,000 years he sending
[22:28] ing someone so far from organization and
[22:31] education and the world of religion as
[22:34] John the Baptist of the Elijah of old we
[22:36] will hear only from God and we will have
[22:39] thus sayith the Lord and speak for God
[22:42] he will be God's mouthpiece and as it is
[22:46] declared in Malachi 4:6 he will turn the
[22:49] hearts of the children back to their
[22:50] fathers he will bring back the elect of
[22:53] the last day and they will hear a
[22:56] Vindicated Prophet give exact truth as
[22:59] it was with Paul he will restore truth
[23:02] as they had had it and those elect will
[23:04] have in the last days the on who truly
[23:07] manifest the Lord and be his body and be
[23:10] the voice to perform his Works do you
[23:13] see it he will restore truth back to the
[23:16] church listen what Paul is saying he
[23:19] said that we ought to speak truth in
[23:22] love how are you going to speak truth
[23:25] without a prophet how are you going to
[23:27] keep from speaking Baptist are speaking
[23:28] Lutheran or speaking Pentecostal amen
[23:31] what kind of language has the world got
[23:34] today and what kind of way do they
[23:36] explain God but there's a benefici and
[23:39] effect of a prophet's message in the
[23:41] last day there'll be a bride that their
[23:44] voice will speak the truth hallelujah
[23:47] the truth has returned the truth has
[23:50] come to us the truth has made its
[23:52] entrance into our hearts the truth has
[23:55] made its way into our lips speaking
[23:58] truth in love my goodness think about it
[24:02] this morning the prophet of God says
[24:04] this if you would just consider the
[24:06] church history you'll find out that
[24:08] those who followed Luther's message
[24:10] become the voice of Luther's message
[24:12] after that he left amen and it was
[24:15] Generations now the brother BR said this
[24:17] if Luther would have lived long enough
[24:19] amen he would have believed
[24:21] this amen amen but we find out amen that
[24:24] brother R says it like this amen those
[24:27] people that took the Revelation from God
[24:30] became living Epistles read known of all
[24:32] men for the generations when the
[24:34] Methodist failed God raised up another
[24:37] and he's gone through the years until
[24:38] the last day there will be another
[24:41] people in the land who under their
[24:44] Messenger will be the final voice to the
[24:48] final age the final voice to the final
[24:51] age isn't that amazing that you are the
[24:54] last people to speak that you are the
[24:57] last people to speak speak in this
[24:58] generation listen let me say something
[25:00] to you the words that you are speaking
[25:03] are the last things that God will say to
[25:06] a dying world Amen the things that you
[25:09] have to say Amen they're more important
[25:12] than the devil would want you to believe
[25:14] he would like to take it and he would
[25:16] say it was more important when this one
[25:18] was speaking in Luther's day it was more
[25:20] important when this one was speaking in
[25:22] Wesley's day oh it was more important
[25:24] back here Amen in the age of Pentecost
[25:27] but never has there ever been a group of
[25:29] people that have lived upon the face of
[25:31] the Earth that what they have to say is
[25:34] god-given and it's so important that
[25:37] your words are becoming the last words
[25:40] that this world will hear from God
[25:44] hallelujah amen the last words to be
[25:47] spoken the voice is the final voice let
[25:50] me say this I know the devil wouldn't
[25:52] like us to stand in the platform even
[25:54] today there are those that have grew up
[25:56] around the message amen and they have
[25:58] done everything they can to shut down
[26:00] the five-fold ministry even from
[26:02] preaching the word but let me say this
[26:04] to you today I believe from my heart
[26:07] that we finally have a five-fold
[26:09] Ministry that has something to say we
[26:12] have something to say that no other age
[26:15] has ever knew and no other age has ever
[26:17] had a hold of do you recognize the
[26:20] Lamb's Book of Life has been opened up
[26:23] the Seven Seals have been peeled back
[26:26] the Thunders have thundered the voice of
[26:29] God has issued into this Earth how you
[26:32] going to shut her up how you going to
[26:34] shut her up when she sees she has the
[26:37] answer for every age we have the answer
[26:40] for the
[26:42] resurrection oh you ever seen somebody
[26:44] sitting in a class and the and the
[26:46] teacher ask a question and and and some
[26:48] people they start talking here and they
[26:51] really don't know the answer but they
[26:52] like to hear themselves talk you know
[26:54] amen but there's somebody sitting there
[26:56] that really knows the answer and finally
[26:58] it just overwhelms them and they just
[27:01] throw their hands up because they have
[27:03] the answer let me tell you this morning
[27:05] no matter your nature Meek or bold no
[27:08] matter whether you're a quiet person or
[27:10] you're a reserved person this answer has
[27:12] been given to you for you to speak up

[27:25] Christ you can tell us it's unimportant
[27:27] let me tell you you are the most
[27:29] valuable thing that God has on this
[27:31] planet
[27:33] today I know people have tried to set
[27:36] you aside and say you're invaluable
[27:38] because of this reason or this reason
[27:41] but let me tell you this Thou Art
[27:43] precious my beloved amen this Bible
[27:46] tells us that in all of the things that
[27:48] God had he gave everything that he might
[27:52] possess you that he might possess a
[27:55] voice oh if you ever see yourself in the
[27:58] scripture amen you'll hear him say I
[28:00] find no spot in
[28:02] thee wrote an entire Bible about
[28:05] you had prophets sing about you come on
[28:09] David's first song in The Book of Psalms
[28:11] is she's like a tree planted by the
[28:13] water amen you could cut it down amen
[28:17] take it to the stomp but you'll never
[28:19] keep it from coming back again because I
[28:22] shall restore sayith the Lord of host we
[28:25] are serving a god that is on your side
[28:29] let me tell you this morning it don't
[28:31] matter who else is on your side when God
[28:35] has chose you in this generation there's
[28:38] no devil there's no power there's no
[28:41] anointing there's no Family Ties there's
[28:44] no religion there's no church nothing
[28:47] can keep you from restor the way God
[28:50] said you could
[28:52] [Applause]
[28:52] [Music]
[28:56] come yes sir he's calling a bride back
[29:00] through a channel he promised to
[29:03] have let me say something this ain't
[29:05] Luther's
[29:07] day I'll read you what a prophet said if
[29:10] you want to know what day it is look at
[29:11] the calendar
[29:16] right if you want to know what time it
[29:18] is look at your
[29:20] Bible that's right hey man you're living
[29:23] brother B said a calendar look at the
[29:24] calendar to find out way the day of the
[29:26] your year you're living and you look at
[29:28] bible God's Bible to see what age you're
[29:30] living amen and we're not living in a
[29:32] Methodist
[29:35] age they preach sanctification and we
[29:38] had to go there but we didn't stay
[29:40] there and there's a Baptist age and
[29:42] there was an age of believing but we
[29:43] didn't stay there right but brother Ram
[29:45] said but we are living in the bright age
[29:48] oh Hallelujah the calling the bringing
[29:52] back to God through a channel he
[29:54] promised to bring it back in he promised
[29:58] to do
[29:59] it God had a channel to bring
[30:04] truth now here's the beauty God is an
[30:07] unchanging God with unchanging ways
[30:09] that's right and according to Amos the
[30:11] third chapter that the Lord Our God
[30:14] would do
[30:15] nothing until first he shows it to a
[30:19] prophet now let me ask you something if
[30:21] he wouldn't do nothing why would you
[30:23] think he would let the end of the world
[30:25] come and not send a prophet if he won't
[30:28] do nothing why would he let a junction
[30:30] of time amen where immortality and time
[30:33] are coming together and not send a
[30:35] profit if he sent a prophet in other
[30:37] changes and other times how much greater
[30:40] the change we're living today we are not
[30:42] just ending an age we are ending history
[30:46] we are standing on the ends of the world
[30:49] Amen and God has made a junction in time
[30:52] if God would have did it in other ages
[30:54] what about the age we're living in I say
[30:57] he did some prophet and I say I'm here
[31:00] with the message of a prophet amen
[31:02] because we can speak the truth
[31:07] now amen it's a dedicated Channel now a
[31:11] prophet is different than other
[31:14] preachers a prophet is a
[31:16] mute brother bam explains it clearly he
[31:19] said this microphone is a mute right and
[31:22] he said you only hear something because
[31:24] of something spoke into
[31:26] it and brother B said a true Prophet was
[31:28] a dedicated channel to God and he could
[31:30] only speak when God
[31:32] speaks come on now a prophet is not one
[31:36] who becomes a prophet he's one who's
[31:39] born a
[31:41] prophet brother Bram said so he now
[31:43] there's Minor Prophets and that's what
[31:45] I'm talking about I'm talking about a
[31:47] prophet a Vindicated Prophet you judge
[31:51] Minor Prophets a major Vindicated
[31:54] Prophet is the
[31:56] judge so all gifts are judged by this
[31:59] message all prophets are judged by this
[32:02] message all pastors are judged by this
[32:05] message let me just give you a complete
[32:08] permission right now Judge Me by it test
[32:12] me by it don't test me by opinions don't
[32:15] test me by the latest feeling or the
[32:17] latest move in the message test me by
[32:20] the message of the
[32:21] hour and if I fail the test I'll repent
[32:25] on the spot and say I've been wrong
[32:26] let's get back to the word of God I say
[32:29] there's a message this morning get back
[32:31] to the
[32:32] word get back to the word of God let the
[32:36] word of God be the guide of the church
[32:39] let it be the guide of our hearts listen
[32:41] it's a dedicated channel of prophit is a
[32:44] mute it is a trusted
[32:47] channel it's one that you can trust yes
[32:51] sir don't you just love sitting down
[32:53] listening to the
[32:54] messages sometimes I don't know about
[32:56] y'all but I turn the tape on it's like
[32:57] going home
[32:59] home good morning friends and my heart
[33:02] just melts I sat there I put all my
[33:06] filters away I put all my defenses away
[33:10] and I just said under that voice and I
[33:12] say Lord mold me m me to this character
[33:16] this man's talking about I want to sit
[33:18] here and be molded because it's a
[33:20] trusted Channel now brother brandom
[33:23] himself had to come through a change of
[33:25] ministry to speak this truth truth it's
[33:29] amazing when you start studying I pray
[33:31] played uh three uh uh uh Visions back to
[33:34] back for you and those three visions
[33:36] back toback are talking about the change
[33:38] that happened to brother brandom in his
[33:40] ministry and look now to speak the truth
[33:43] he personally had to undergo a change
[33:47] now he said that the ministry wouldn't
[33:49] change but the man with the ministry
[33:52] would change now y'all y'all y'all have
[33:55] been around enough to know some of these
[33:57] prophecies that's been over brother
[33:58] bradam but you know it's uh it's it's
[34:00] beautiful when you go into birth pains
[34:02] and I'll just read from birth pains cuz
[34:03] it was the place but brother Bram first
[34:05] TS talking about this in the Easter seal
[34:08] in
[34:08] 1961 but it's when brother Bram had just
[34:11] finished a sermon and and and a man come
[34:13] up on the platform Danny Henry he was
[34:15] Ken folks to maryn Monro I believe it
[34:17] was and and and he come up on the
[34:19] platform and he hugged brother brandom a
[34:22] baptist boy and he was just going to
[34:24] tell brother bradam that this could be
[34:26] the 23rd chapter of Revelations they
[34:27] didn't he was just so beautiful and when
[34:29] he hugged him he started speaking in
[34:31] unknown
[34:33] tongues well this he
[34:35] did he started speaking in unknown
[34:38] tongues to him but come to find out
[34:41] there was people sitting in the room
[34:43] that said that wasn't an unknown tongue
[34:45] that was
[34:46] French and there was three of them come
[34:49] together two of them wrote it down the
[34:51] interpretation and the third one walked
[34:53] up to the platform and read it and he
[34:55] said he was Victor Leo he was The
[34:57] Interpreter
[34:58] uh for the U of the French and in this
[35:00] in this translation he said because thou
[35:03] has chosen the Narrow Path a harder way
[35:06] thou H has walked of your own choosing
[35:09] and thou has picked the correct and
[35:10] precise decision it is my
[35:14] way well that's powerful isn't it and
[35:17] because of this momentous decision a
[35:19] huge portion awaits thee what a glorious
[35:23] decision you have made this in itself he
[35:27] says is that which will give and make
[35:30] come to pass the tremendous victory in
[35:34] love divine now watch speaking truth now
[35:37] here's the prophet with a with a
[35:39] prophecy laying over his life because
[35:42] thou H has chosen the harder way and
[35:44] brother bam I immediately identifies
[35:47] that to Moses and his decision to walk
[35:49] with God that he made a choice if you've
[35:52] ever read it the book of Hebrews said
[35:54] that Moses seen the Unseen amen decided
[35:57] to to take the reproach of Christ and
[36:00] esteem it Greater riches than Israel so
[36:03] he took the worst thing God had to offer
[36:06] and esteemed it greater than the best
[36:07] thing the world had to offer and brother
[36:10] man Likens his choice to Moses's choice
[36:13] to abide in the calling that God had
[36:16] gave him he actually goes on to tell us
[36:18] amen that what it does he said he said
[36:20] now I don't know what the rest of that
[36:23] meant and may it come to pass perhaps
[36:25] one day in the tent we'll get to it says
[36:28] this true Easter seal 1961 now he says
[36:31] here he said see now he said now watch
[36:34] perhaps it'll come setting back under
[36:37] he'll make it known now not because we
[36:40] had it to do not because of that see
[36:42] it's just easy you can be popular you
[36:45] can have everybody patting you on the
[36:47] back money flowing from everywhere for
[36:49] radio or televisions and so forth they
[36:51] said that they would take it and
[36:53] televise it and I don't believe in
[36:55] taking God's things and putting them out
[36:56] there on such vulgarity stuff of the
[36:59] world I don't believe in all this
[37:01] whooping it up and making something that
[37:02] it isn't I believe in just letting it
[37:05] alone the way God see let him do it with
[37:08] it the way he wants to we servants just
[37:11] serve the Lord just as God said do it
[37:14] now what was it brother Brandon made a
[37:16] choice that he wouldn't let him put them
[37:18] out there on television because they
[37:19] wasn't going to let him preach the truth
[37:21] like that he was going to have to start
[37:23] taking things away from the message
[37:25] before they could support it but but the
[37:28] love in his heart meant that he desired
[37:31] to see a bride for Christ greater than
[37:34] he wanted his own Ministry come on
[37:37] Church brother Brandon wasn't just
[37:38] trying to build himself matter of fact
[37:41] in the end of his ministry they came to
[37:43] him and said brother brandom the reason
[37:44] your ministry is fading he said because
[37:47] you don't have the right promoters and
[37:49] brother brandom told the greatest
[37:50] promoters he said it's come my time that
[37:52] I must decrease because it's the time
[37:55] that he's got to increase and I pray
[37:58] this morning amen that we remain in that
[38:01] position of letting it be less us and
[38:04] more
[38:07] him I I I I guess I'm home I preach what
[38:11] I believe ain't I I say what is I I
[38:13] think it's time amen that we quit
[38:15] beating around the bushes and trying to
[38:17] convert denominations and trying to get
[38:19] people to believe this that don't
[38:20] believe this and while we're doing it
[38:22] we're letting the people of God starve
[38:24] to death amen because we're afraid to
[38:27] say the name William brandom we're
[38:29] afraid to preach the truth of the
[38:31] message of the hour well I'll tell you
[38:33] this God called me to preach this
[38:35] message he didn't call me to hold hands
[38:38] with every denomination and every manm
[38:41] thing he called me to preach the message
[38:45] of the hour and the love of God would
[38:48] make us do
[38:49] [Applause]
[38:50] it
[38:53] Hallelujah I know I know what I'm
[38:54] talking about there's a great pressure
[38:56] right now through this hour we're living
[38:58] don't quote brother brandham let me tell
[38:59] you what I'm going to quote brother
[39:02] brandom you cut my head off but I'm
[39:05] going to quote Willam brandom you can
[39:07] you can feel me full of darts you can
[39:09] tire and feather me and put me in a
[39:11] prison and I'll be moving my pinky in
[39:14] prison just so you know that means I
[39:16] believe God's Prophet is a man named
[39:18] William brandom you can't shut me up you
[39:21] can't close me up but one day God's
[39:23] going to take me up he's going to take
[39:25] his bride in a rapture of
[39:30] Glory I tell you how to know it's a
[39:32] devil you can quote you can quote woodro
[39:35] Wilson what's that cigarette smoking
[39:37] Englishman amen we'll fight them on the
[39:39] beaches and we'll fight them in the
[39:41] streets huh Churchill you can quote
[39:44] Church Hill all day long oh Church Hill
[39:47] you can quote him but when you quote
[39:49] William brandom somebody's going to draw
[39:52] up on that listen let me tell you that's
[39:54] the way you know it's a devil all of
[39:56] hell is scared of this message they are
[39:59] scared for the people to get a true
[40:02] understanding of the Revelation this
[40:04] word because the truth of this matter is
[40:07] it was a dedicated voice to anoint you
[40:10] as the Bride of Jesus Christ that's why
[40:13] denomination's fighting it friends
[40:16] that's why they're fighting it so
[40:17] hard because a prophet didn't name the
[40:20] Baptist as the Messiah he didn't name
[40:23] the Lutheran as the place of worship he
[40:25] didn't name the Pentecostal he named you
[40:29] the called out church and said I won't
[40:31] call you church I'll call you
[40:34] [Applause]
[40:37] bride oh they hate his voice but I say
[40:40] we love his
[40:42] voice see it forces a man to a
[40:46] decision and the prophet had to come to
[40:49] his
[40:50] decision and that decision was a
[40:52] momentous decision it was the harder way
[40:54] but it was God's way right amen and the
[40:57] of God said it brought a victory in love
[41:00] divine he said just change it he said
[41:02] it's the verb before the adverb it
[41:03] brought a victory in Divine
[41:06] love Paradox in 1961 brother Brown
[41:09] revisits it and brings it together with
[41:12] another another vision and in this
[41:15] Vision he said I was walking on a map of
[41:17] Palestine and he said I looked over and
[41:20] I had come 2/3 of the journey and he
[41:23] said I was looking over the Jordan and
[41:25] there was a third part laying over over
[41:27] there and the voice said to me that's
[41:29] where all the promises are come on now
[41:32] first two pulls didn't bring all the
[41:34] promises but that's where the
[41:36] Pentecostals wanted to stay but in that
[41:39] third part there was going to be an
[41:41] opening of the mind of God to say whose
[41:44] names were for the inheritance of the
[41:47] heavens and earth that that the Church
[41:49] of the Living God your name was on the
[41:51] wheel denominations did not want the
[41:54] reading of the will of God
[41:57] they wanted to make their own claims on
[41:59] it and say it belongs to them when it
[42:02] belonged to you the whole time but God's
[42:04] dedicated messenger would not be detered
[42:08] and when he come to the Jordan he heard
[42:10] the voice say over there's where all the
[42:12] promises are he said oh now I see what
[42:15] coming to the Jordan meant he was coming
[42:18] to death he was coming to the end of
[42:20] that popular Ministry if you go into the
[42:23] scriptures 2 Timothy chapter uh 4 you'll
[42:26] find brother bam discuss it and he talks
[42:28] about the first part of his ministry he
[42:29] said do the work of evangelist but
[42:31] there'll come a time they won't endure
[42:32] sound Doctrine and he said that's all I
[42:35] read for years he said but later I found
[42:38] later in the book of Timothy where that
[42:40] Paul said for them that Deus has
[42:42] forsaken me and bring my coat and come
[42:45] to me brother man said there he is a
[42:46] prophet down to one coat he said there
[42:49] Deus had forsaken him he said Demus
[42:51] hadn't went back in the world and
[42:52] gambled and things he said he just gave
[42:54] up on Paul that his ministry had come to
[42:57] its end isn't it amazing Paul had a
[42:59] Demus and William brandham had a Demus
[43:02] sharan and when brother BR started
[43:04] teaching the word all of a sudden they
[43:06] believe brother Ram's Ministry had come
[43:08] to an end because it wasn't in the
[43:11] Pentecostal fashion anymore so what did
[43:13] we find out so brother randam comes to
[43:15] the platform and he said the flash of
[43:18] another Revival is blinding you from
[43:21] seeing the Revival that is on today come
[43:24] on the glare of the Pentecostal r
[43:27] Revival was blinding them to the
[43:29] greatest Revival that has ever hit the
[43:32] face of the Earth God was going to
[43:35] reveal the seven unknown Thunders and
[43:38] they would not look at
[43:42] it hey it was divine love it was in the
[43:46] message now watch this because brother
[43:48] bam was told this in the early 60s now
[43:50] in 1963 brother brandom comes along then
[43:53] and he comes to this great decision and
[43:55] standing in the gap youve all read the
[43:57] message if you had go go home listen
[43:59] today or the next day you'll enjoy it
[44:01] but standing in the Gap brother Bram
[44:03] comes along and he says I'm wore out
[44:06] with a with a fussing amen now this is
[44:08] in 1963 this is an ' 06 he just preached
[44:11] the seals now and he said when these
[44:13] tapes go out thousands of my friends are
[44:15] going to leave me and he was wore out
[44:17] because can you imagine this guys
[44:20] standing and talking the seven angels
[44:22] and getting the Revelation divinely
[44:24] revealed to you from God and then you
[44:27] preach it to the church is supposed to
[44:28] be God's church and they call you a
[44:30] false prophet a heretic a crazy man and
[44:33] there he stood knowing where it came
[44:36] from amen but they started setting him
[44:39] aside and brother BR said and I picked
[44:41] myself up a
[44:44] complex y'all y'all remember it right he
[44:47] said I picked myself up a complex he
[44:49] said and as Moses here it's back to
[44:52] Moses and as Moses had done the same
[44:55] thing remember when Moses got that
[44:57] complex against God's people brother Ram
[44:59] said I got the complex against God's
[45:01] people and had made up in my mind that I
[45:05] was going to sneak away in the
[45:06] wilderness and I was going to be a
[45:08] prophet God called me to be a prophet I
[45:11] would be a prophet then I would go up in
[45:13] the wilderness I was he was going to
[45:14] trick his wife you'd have to trick a
[45:15] woman into that cuz it was about 1100
[45:17] miles up Amen in the wilderness and he's
[45:20] going to trick her and take her up there
[45:22] with Bud Southwick and then when they
[45:24] got there brother Bram said I was going
[45:25] to tell her honey I like it so well here
[45:27] why don't we just live off the grid for
[45:29] the rest of our lives amen and brother
[45:31] Ram said that was what was in his mind
[45:34] he said but I had this dream and in this
[45:36] dream he said I was wandering around in
[45:39] this dump yard and he said there was
[45:41] there was trash and he said it was an
[45:43] old dumps field and he said people were
[45:45] living in boxes and things and they had
[45:47] fires and it was cold and he said I was
[45:48] wanding around and cold and dark and he
[45:51] said there I was he said I was rugged
[45:53] and ragged and looking for a place and
[45:56] he said I was walking and I started
[45:57] thinking one time I used to leave God's
[46:00] church and now here I am in this
[46:03] condition and brother B said I just kept
[46:05] walking he said then all of a sudden I
[46:06] looked over and there was Fletcher my
[46:08] brother-in-law setting at a fire and
[46:09] said come here Bill you've been so good
[46:11] to us and you fed my kids when I was
[46:13] gone and and there there he was in a
[46:15] position now that a drunk was had to
[46:18] take care of him he used to be a prophet
[46:20] now a drunk was going to care for him
[46:23] now watch this and brother man said I
[46:25] sat down there with him and the dream
[46:26] faded away and he said I went and
[46:27] checked on Fletch and things he said and
[46:29] he was doing okay he said so I thought
[46:31] well I don't know what it means he said
[46:33] and just a little while later Billy and
[46:34] I was up in Montana and he said I got up
[46:37] early one morning went down to the cafe
[46:38] and he said we were going to get
[46:39] something to eat he said I walked in the
[46:41] cafe and he said I seen this rugged
[46:43] Rancher come in now if I'm I'm making it
[46:45] a short one so you can you you're
[46:47] getting the whole tapate in 10 minutes
[46:48] here he said this old Rancher come in he
[46:51] said I looked him over and he said now
[46:52] there's a man right there he was a
[46:55] little bit rugged his hair wasn't cut up
[46:57] real good and he had a beard and brother
[46:58] Ram said he was he was a rough looking
[47:00] fell he said when he sneezed he sneezed
[47:03] you know he just let her out you know he
[47:07] said wasn't one of them little
[47:08] sneezes he just sneezed said oh man
[47:10] after my own heart and he said that's
[47:13] the kind of guy I'm going to be now I
[47:15] know some of you sitting in here this
[47:17] morning let let me let's learn one
[47:19] little thought from this some of you
[47:21] sitting here this morning maybe you're a
[47:22] young man and you're looking out here in
[47:24] this world and you're seeing what you
[47:26] think you want to be but listen let when
[47:28] you get that settled well I'll be like
[47:30] this guy and I'll be like this guy and
[47:32] I'll be like this guy listen to me
[47:34] without God you ain't going to be
[47:36] nothing without God Amen listen the
[47:39] dirtiest Rascal out there is a boy
[47:42] running from God the filthiest woman in
[47:45] the bar is a girl running from God Amen
[47:48] these just just nice common people
[47:50] listen maybe they settled where they are
[47:52] but you take a daughter or a son of God
[47:55] and let them run from this word and
[47:57] they'll go deeper and fall further amen
[47:59] listen don't you ever judge somebody by
[48:02] how far they have fell because they're
[48:04] running from God but the same God that
[48:07] called them amen won't give up on them
[48:11] until he brings them back into the
[48:13] presence of God without God we are
[48:17] nothing without God you're
[48:22] nobody hey you watch you watch how that
[48:24] Prophet went to that and he said I was
[48:26] going to be like that guy and he said
[48:28] all of a sudden he said there was a two
[48:30] men stood up and older and he said they
[48:32] were dressed bad and didn't have much
[48:34] clothes on or you know as far as
[48:36] dressing wise he said they were rugged
[48:38] and didn't have any money he said he
[48:40] said he said maybe they had a breakfast
[48:42] that was 20 cents between the two of
[48:43] them so they didn't had no money amen
[48:46] and and he said all of a sudden Billy
[48:47] said Daddy that looks like you in
[48:50] flet amen and all of a sudden he found
[48:55] what he thought he would be and then he
[48:57] saw what he was going to be and you know
[49:00] what God was doing he was showing him if
[49:02] you make your choice your way that's
[49:05] what you would be but if you make my
[49:07] choice and you do it my way you'll be
[49:10] standing there as a leader of the Bride
[49:13] of Jesus Christ listen God's Got Away
[49:16] church
[49:19] he brother M said there it was Fletch
[49:22] and I there it was right there in that
[49:24] dream he said then watch what happened
[49:26] happens he said we get in the car and go
[49:28] to driveing he said Billy went to sleep
[49:30] and a voice started speaking to me and
[49:32] he said you've wondered and you wondered
[49:34] now this is Elijah how many knows what
[49:36] his first Bible was it was the
[49:38] Wilderness it was the nature do you know
[49:41] God knew that by his nature that Elijah
[49:43] was a nature John the Baptist that's all
[49:45] he read was books of of the trees and
[49:47] serpents and the rocks and it meant more
[49:49] to him than the scripts and the prophet
[49:51] said as I was driving the angel said to
[49:53] me your name is written in this mountain
[49:56] I got the pictures here I won't show
[49:57] them this morning for time he said but
[49:59] your name is written here in this
[50:01] mountain and brother R said I looked
[50:02] over now he's showing him his name in
[50:04] his own Bible that mountain meant more
[50:07] to brother brandham than just the
[50:09] written letters on the page amen he saw
[50:12] his name brother BR said there he said
[50:14] how many letters is in your name and he
[50:16] said there's that now if y'all watch it
[50:17] William Mary and brandom there seven
[50:19] letters in all of them and he said he
[50:21] said well there's seven letters brand
[50:23] and he said he spelled it b r a n h a
[50:27] and said there was seven snow Peaks and
[50:29] he said my name fit right across them
[50:31] mountains now listen folks I don't know
[50:34] if if you're if you're if you're where
[50:35] I'm at on this but I'll say this to you
[50:38] that the West Coast was not civilized
[50:41] until the 19th
[50:42] century right we're in Montana we're on
[50:46] the western coast and it says as the
[50:48] light shines from the East unto the West
[50:51] so shall the coming of the Lord be now
[50:53] notice because in the west coast here is
[50:56] is a seven-letter name of a man that
[50:59] there's not been a major Ministry in the
[51:02] Earth with seven letters ending in hm
[51:05] since Abraham from The Book of Genesis
[51:08] the 17th chapter and Abraham only had
[51:11] five letters in Genesis the 12th chapter
[51:14] but God added two letters to Abraham's
[51:17] name so that it would be a seven-letter
[51:21] messenger who was
[51:24] first who was first I ask you this was
[51:27] those mountains there before Abraham got
[51:30] his name or
[51:32] after before seven letters was ever in
[51:35] Abraham's name that was a seven-letter
[51:37] mountain and in God's mind that was a
[51:40] gentile bride that would receive a
[51:42] Malachai for a prophet and his name
[51:44] would be seven letters not six like
[51:46] Graham seven like brandom and God would
[51:49] have a prophet on the
[51:51] scene now if you're a reader of the
[51:53] Bible in Genesis 17th chapter in Genesis
[51:55] 18 you you find the 17th chapter Lord
[51:58] God Almighty appeared unto Abraham and
[52:00] he draw from the breast and got the Holy
[52:02] Ghost but it was only one verse or so
[52:04] later that he was called Abraham and he
[52:07] became the father of Nations he went
[52:09] from the baptism of the spirit unto
[52:12] being positionally placed by the same
[52:15] anointing Hallelujah church this message
[52:18] didn't come amen just to make us another
[52:21] church it came for adoption it came for
[52:25] placing it came to teach you who you are
[52:28] what you're doing here what your
[52:30] promises are and where you are
[52:34] going it was written in the Bible and it
[52:36] was also written in that mountain and
[52:39] the prophet said it was given unto him
[52:40] for an everlasting sign and you my zo he
[52:42] was powerful is three of those Peaks was
[52:44] taller than the others and there was
[52:46] three parts of his ministry and the
[52:48] first pull in healing then the second
[52:50] pull in Prophecy but in that third pole
[52:53] it was the last and final Peak after
[52:55] that third po you went to the
[52:57] Continental Divide and it went straight
[52:59] out to the Pacific Ocean amen isn't it
[53:02] beautiful that there is a continental
[53:04] divide that has come into this age
[53:07] between Mortal and immortality and it's
[53:09] under the third pull that there is an
[53:12] entrance made into the kingdom of God by
[53:16] the word of God listen you are entering
[53:19] an Immortal Realm by the power of the
[53:22] message that has been spoken unto you
[53:24] you have heard from another world this
[53:26] ain't just an education it's not just
[53:29] another schooling it is the voice of
[53:32] almighty God sounding From Another
[53:36] [Applause]
[53:39] Dimension Hey Brother Bram said now I
[53:43] understood what it meant a great victory
[53:46] in love divine he said it meant that I
[53:48] would stand in the gap for the
[53:51] people I would return to the field
[53:53] though I am uh uh resented he was going
[53:57] to go preach the message to people that
[53:59] was resenting him and hating him he said
[54:02] oh he said something in me see the
[54:05] complex had said if they don't want to
[54:07] hear you I won't preach it anymore but
[54:09] he said the love of God dashed out there
[54:12] and stood in the gap between the people
[54:14] and God just like Moses stood in the Gap
[54:18] we've had a prophet stand in the Gap are
[54:21] you hearing me the breach has been made
[54:24] somebody stood in the breach
[54:28] between the churches and the seals
[54:30] somebody made a breach for you and I in
[54:33] this evening time message praise the
[54:35] Lord see here's a prophet standing in
[54:38] the Gap hey man look and this is this is
[54:41] explaining now amen that why that his
[54:44] momentous decision and his great victory
[54:46] in love divine he had to love the people
[54:48] enough to preach the message even in a
[54:51] time of rejection look at Jesus in the
[54:53] first crucifixion there from the cross
[54:56] love was projected but that love he
[54:58] projected from the cross must make it
[55:01] way through the statue of the perfect
[55:04] man and it must come into maturity not
[55:07] just in the bridegroom but it's got to
[55:09] come to the bride it's got to be known
[55:12] as the token it's got to be known as the
[55:14] literal life somebody has got to be
[55:17] capped amen by those Thunders somebody's
[55:20] got to be capped and divine love has got
[55:23] to settle down and the voice of God is
[55:26] going to speak out of that church now
[55:29] listen friends here's a prophet saying
[55:31] this now he's saying this all the way
[55:33] back there in the 60s and he's talking
[55:35] about this he's talking about this this
[55:37] happening now I think it's
[55:39] beautiful because before brother Ram
[55:41] goes to this great trial of trying to
[55:43] decide about his
[55:45] ministry amen you know what he's also
[55:47] done is he has now come to the place
[55:51] that he's understanding the change that
[55:53] is happening to
[55:54] him he's going to be pushed out how many
[55:58] knows that do you know why he's going to
[56:00] be pushed out for the
[56:03] word now think of this friends the seed
[56:06] is coming out of the shuck not because
[56:08] the seed has a bad attitude and it's
[56:10] going to just have a fight and it's
[56:12] going no no no no because of the
[56:15] word listen this message will separate
[56:18] you from some of your
[56:20] friendships but let the message do
[56:24] it let it be the message that separates
[56:28] amen do you see that the message itself
[56:31] was separating and watch here here's a
[56:34] prophet now he's saying because of this
[56:36] tremendous victory in love divine now
[56:38] it's amazing to me that he's going
[56:40] through this but in 1960 in the message
[56:42] rejected King going to tie another
[56:44] Vision in 1960 rejected King now this is
[56:48] 60 standing in the Gap 63 1961 he's
[56:52] already told us amen about these other
[56:54] visions and 62 but in 1960 he has a
[56:58] translation or a vision where he goes
[57:01] beyond the curtain of time now remember
[57:03] amen he's laying on the bed and he's
[57:05] depressed and he's in a state of
[57:07] depression because he's thinking he's
[57:09] not doing enough for God he's about 56
[57:12] years old he's settling into that I'm
[57:14] not doing anything for the Lord and amen
[57:16] I need to get out and do something and
[57:18] I'm going to make something happen he
[57:19] said all of the sudden The Voice spoke
[57:20] to him and said would you like to see
[57:22] beyond the curtain remember brother R
[57:25] didn't I'm just paraphrasing now you go
[57:26] back and read the it's on the fifth seal
[57:28] it's real well so you can read the whole
[57:30] account I'm just pulling something from
[57:31] the account but here's a prophet Lane
[57:33] here and he said all of a sudden he said
[57:36] I was in another place now here's the
[57:39] beauty friends I I don't want you ever
[57:40] to miss this he was only one breath from
[57:43] that
[57:44] Dimension and he literally could see his
[57:47] own body laying on the bed so you you
[57:51] you see and he turned and looked from
[57:52] looking at his body with his wife and
[57:55] turned and looked and saw Millions
[57:57] coming with white robes he was literally
[58:00] Amen in view of the body and in view of
[58:04] the other dimension at the same time he
[58:07] wasn't 20t from his
[58:10] body amen that I've had people mad at me
[58:13] over this but I really don't care but
[58:14] let me just say this I believe that
[58:16] there's theophanies in this
[58:19] room and I believe they're not any
[58:21] further than 20 ft from our bodies
[58:26] amen sometimes you feel a charge of the
[58:29] anointing coming in the building and you
[58:31] say what is that I believe sometimes the
[58:34] positive and the negative come together
[58:36] at the same time I say come on up a
[58:38] little higher come to the perfect word
[58:42] amen my theophany is calling me into
[58:45] that perfect realization of almighty God
[58:49] what was it brother R had broke over
[58:50] into that other dimension now now later
[58:53] he tells us amen that he he saw people
[58:56] in there and he said one of them was 90
[58:58] and had come into conversion and he said
[59:00] he looked over there and he said well
[59:01] these are not all brandom they're all
[59:03] your converts and remember later brother
[59:06] brother Richard he said there was a girl
[59:07] I used to date had died and I went back
[59:09] to Jeffersonville and he said they let
[59:11] me in the back room to see her and he
[59:14] said when I walked back there and saw
[59:16] her he said I thought Oh Glory to God he
[59:19] said because the other day I saw her
[59:21] over there on the other side in white
[59:23] robes amen here's a prophet could stand
[59:26] in the face of death and not be shooken
[59:29] by the death of a mother and by the
[59:31] death of a wife because he already knew
[59:34] what was on the other side let me say
[59:36] something to you amen there was a lot of
[59:38] pressure for him to not tell that Vision
[59:41] there was a lot of pressure from a lot
[59:43] of people don't you speak that Vision
[59:45] out like that but love for the people
[59:48] gave us a truth that only a prophet

[1:03:43] the truth on it this ain't my thought
[1:03:46] this is God's thought concerning the
[1:03:49] death of his
[1:03:51] [Applause]
[1:03:54] Saints I know the Darkness it comes at
[1:03:57] death I've sat in those dark times and
[1:03:59] those funerals and I've seen it and
[1:04:01] looked at it and if we didn't have this
[1:04:04] message we'd lose our
[1:04:06] minds but God has given us a
[1:04:09] message to stabilize Us in the most
[1:04:13] unstabilized
[1:04:16] moments yes sir we have a truth there's
[1:04:19] been a change and there's been a climax
[1:04:21] into this prophet's
[1:04:23] Ministry can I can I can I tell tell you
[1:04:26] that brother randam was about to forget
[1:04:28] about the church and his needs and just
[1:04:29] go
[1:04:30] hunting and Moses was just going to hurt
[1:04:34] some
[1:04:35] sheep yeah but an angel of God came down
[1:04:38] in the pillar of fire and said to Moses
[1:04:41] I have come down to deliver my children
[1:04:44] and you may have forgot about them but I
[1:04:46] have not forgot about them I made a
[1:04:49] promise to them and if you listen listen
[1:04:51] if you would have been Moses you would
[1:04:52] have looked at the situation and said
[1:04:54] God there is no way to get them out now
[1:04:58] 400 years under bondage 400 years under
[1:05:01] slavery and you pick me with a stutter
[1:05:04] how are they going to believe me how
[1:05:06] they going to get out of here how's this
[1:05:07] going to happen but you see God had come
[1:05:10] down but he was just going to send Moses
[1:05:13] and brother BR said he finally had Moses
[1:05:14] weak enough to use him now Moses used
[1:05:16] his weakness for an
[1:05:19] excuse so the prophet of God said
[1:05:21] honestly you're not too weak you're too
[1:05:23] strong right amen so if you surrendering
[1:05:26] to the thing that God called you to you
[1:05:28] would find that God's behind it already
[1:05:32] GL and look what Moses did he left there
[1:05:35] and went down and delivered the children
[1:05:37] of Israel and he brought them out with a
[1:05:39] mighty hand because he had the word of
[1:05:43] power he had a word that was powerful
[1:05:46] enough to break the hands of Pharaoh's
[1:05:48] grip upon the children of God Amen I'm
[1:05:51] told according to the scripture that
[1:05:53] there is to be an abrahamic seed right
[1:05:55] rise up in the last days and I'm told
[1:05:58] that the Bible said that they would have
[1:06:00] Liberty and they would have freedom and
[1:06:02] they would come out of to God for a
[1:06:04] marriage and a Rapture and God is going
[1:06:07] to send a messenger to break the grip of
[1:06:09] denomination off of their
[1:06:12] lives amen I I can read it for you in 1
[1:06:15] Thessalonians 4 he said the Lord shall
[1:06:17] descend from heaven with a shout what is
[1:06:20] it it's a message of God it was a
[1:06:22] message coming see a message with enough
[1:06:27] power to break the stronghold that enemy
[1:06:30] had on
[1:06:32] lives you know I I was just I was just
[1:06:34] thinking over this this morning just
[1:06:36] sitting here thinking over this uh this
[1:06:38] situation and I thought of I thought of
[1:06:41] the
[1:06:42] prophet and I thought of how how he
[1:06:45] would place things he preaches standing
[1:06:48] in the Gap in June and preaches why
[1:06:52] Christ speak in July same year what a
[1:06:57] transition standing in the Gap why CHR I
[1:07:02] speak and he and he shows Moses's
[1:07:05] Ministry and how Moses had come to the
[1:07:08] place to whine like a
[1:07:11] baby listen to this he was whining like
[1:07:14] a baby why was Moses doing that whining
[1:07:17] why was Moses crying because he was
[1:07:19] looking at the
[1:07:21] situation and not the god that sent him
[1:07:26] and if Satan can ever get your eyes on
[1:07:29] the situation rather than the promises
[1:07:32] and the vision that God is made then he
[1:07:34] will defeat you every time but I want I
[1:07:36] want to take this in this why cry I want
[1:07:38] to show you something brother random
[1:07:39] says he says you see I had that Vision
[1:07:41] the other day of that boy over there in
[1:07:43] Vinland now there's some people don't
[1:07:45] think that happens and and I just told
[1:07:47] him here a while back I said well I
[1:07:48] didn't even know you were
[1:07:51] there you want to tell me what happened
[1:07:53] in Finland and you wasn't there and
[1:07:55] here's a Vindicated Prophet that was
[1:07:58] there and he told that there would be a
[1:08:01] boy raised from the dead that was hit in
[1:08:03] the car told how he would be laying told
[1:08:05] what he would look like told the told
[1:08:07] the very uh clothes he would be wearing
[1:08:08] the kind of car that would do it he told
[1:08:10] that there would be lapping rocks and
[1:08:12] cedar trees and brother BR said he
[1:08:14] explained it wrote it on the fly leaf of
[1:08:16] his Bible even told it and it it was it
[1:08:19] was well enough known that people were
[1:08:21] coming and getting brother brandham in
[1:08:22] Florida out of meetings and showing him
[1:08:24] dead boys to see if it was the one he
[1:08:26] was talking about it was that well known
[1:08:29] but when brother Ram went over there in
[1:08:31] Europe he never thought that that would
[1:08:33] be the place or the time but he but he
[1:08:36] was driving down the road and look how
[1:08:37] it come on him all of a sudden he gets
[1:08:39] out and there's a great wreck and
[1:08:40] there's two boys laying there and one of
[1:08:42] them's dead and one of them's about dead
[1:08:44] and they're standing there and brother
[1:08:45] BR said they come and got me and said
[1:08:46] brother Bram come and look and he said
[1:08:48] the minute I saw it my heart left me I
[1:08:49] couldn't stand to look at it he said it
[1:08:51] ain't been that long ago with my babies
[1:08:53] and he said I just couldn't stand to
[1:08:54] look at it I turned to go go back to the
[1:08:55] car he said a hand put it hand a hand
[1:08:58] put me on the shoulder and he said look
[1:09:01] around and he said I started looking
[1:09:04] around he said oh my goodness there was
[1:09:06] them evergreen trees he said there's the
[1:09:09] lapping rocks oh there's the boy with
[1:09:12] the knickers there's the car there's the
[1:09:14] scene everything is exactly as it was in
[1:09:18] the vision look what he says here in why
[1:09:21] cry he said it's a situation under
[1:09:24] control
[1:09:26] it is a situation he said but now it's
[1:09:29] under control the moment he recognized
[1:09:33] this has been pre-old me he knew now all
[1:09:37] he had to do was speak not to cry about
[1:09:41] the situation he didn't have to worry
[1:09:44] about the situation he knew what was
[1:09:46] coming next speak you see maturity he
[1:09:50] didn't fall apart in the trial he didn't
[1:09:52] fall apart looking at the situation he
[1:09:55] he knew the outcome of the situation
[1:09:58] come on folks amen real anointing is
[1:10:01] supreme power under control it's when
[1:10:04] you know what to do with the word of God
[1:10:07] when Satan boxes you in and he's made it
[1:10:10] dark on every corner you don't have to
[1:10:12] lay down and whimper and say I don't
[1:10:14] know if I'm going to make it I don't
[1:10:16] know if I can get out of this listen to
[1:10:18] me you have been seen in a vision you
[1:10:21] have been seen on the other side I don't
[1:10:24] care what the devil does or how it comes
[1:10:27] or what he throws at us just speak the
[1:10:30] word and keep moving it's under
[1:10:37] control but said it he said immediately
[1:10:39] right after that story he says it like
[1:10:42] this he said I was out there hunting
[1:10:43] with brother bisc and he said I come up
[1:10:45] on there by the way sister Joanne done
[1:10:49] me a solid in this trip to Switzerland
[1:10:51] she showed me a picture when brother
[1:10:53] brandom and brother Ed was on that trip
[1:10:56] and and in the picture it's got brother
[1:10:58] Ed wearing that Green checkered shirt
[1:11:00] it's the neatest thing she won't give me
[1:11:02] a copy y'all pray for
[1:11:06] her but he said they were walking up
[1:11:08] there and he said a caribou with 42 Ines
[1:11:11] he said we went over and killed that one
[1:11:13] and he said we were carrying that one
[1:11:15] down the hill and he said before we got
[1:11:17] to the bottom I had said I'd kill a 7ot
[1:11:19] Grizzly and he said Bud was looking over
[1:11:21] at me and he was saying brother brandom
[1:11:24] didn't you say we'd get a grizzly before
[1:11:25] we got to the end didn't you say we'd
[1:11:27] get the bear before we got to the end
[1:11:29] finally he said bud are you doubting me
[1:11:31] he said no brother brandom I just can't
[1:11:33] see the
[1:11:34] bear yeah I just can't see it from here
[1:11:37] and brother Bram said but the situation
[1:11:39] was already under control he said I
[1:11:42] already knew how it would come he said
[1:11:45] we didn't have to get worried he said
[1:11:47] just speak the word he steal Jehovah
[1:11:50] Gyra see it was under control when it
[1:11:53] looked like it was going crazy but a
[1:11:55] prophet knew what was fixing to happen
[1:11:58] oh Church of the Living God we've got
[1:12:00] the truth on the situations we're living
[1:12:02] in I say situations under
[1:12:08] control I know your Bible readers and we
[1:12:10] don't have time to read it let me run it
[1:12:12] through you in Revelations the n9th
[1:12:14] chapter and read it right out of the
[1:12:15] Bible it said there was an angel coming
[1:12:16] out of the bottomless pit and was given
[1:12:18] the key to unloose the Bottom's pit and
[1:12:20] then smoke that was coming from the
[1:12:22] bottomless pit was going to fill the
[1:12:23] Earth and it was going to affect
[1:12:25] everything like a house fire it does
[1:12:27] smoke affects everything this Smoke From
[1:12:29] Hell was going to affect everything and
[1:12:31] the and the and the Gates of Hell
[1:12:33] basically was going to be Unleashed upon
[1:12:34] the Earth and according to Revelations 9
[1:12:36] and 11 there would be a king who would
[1:12:38] be over them and he would be the angel
[1:12:40] the botus pit it' be Satan himself
[1:12:42] Lucifer would be leading an army of
[1:12:45] demons in the last days upon the Earth
[1:12:47] having a key to come out and be leashed
[1:12:49] upon the people between the six and
[1:12:51] seven Trump and the six seven seal you
[1:12:53] can go read the prophet said it he he
[1:12:55] said that under that fifth seal he said
[1:12:57] what happened was you fre he dried up
[1:12:59] and he said demons that had been bound
[1:13:01] there from the old days he said was
[1:13:03] released and we've seen 200,000,000
[1:13:06] Horsemen released upon Israel he said
[1:13:10] and Hitler and musolini and Stalin and
[1:13:12] they shot him with bullets and they
[1:13:14] killed him and they burned them what was
[1:13:15] it it was
[1:13:17] Devils it was demons out of Revelations
[1:13:20] 9 and it looked horrible and it looked
[1:13:24] like it would never end and it looked
[1:13:26] like there was no
[1:13:28] hopes but see there was already a
[1:13:30] scripture laying in the
[1:13:32] Bible that told us that in the third day
[1:13:35] I will revive you again and I will
[1:13:37] gather you back under my wings and God
[1:13:40] already prophesied of the return of
[1:13:43] Israel and before they kicked them out
[1:13:45] of Russia and Germany and Hitler and
[1:13:48] Europe before they kicked them out they
[1:13:50] had a place to
[1:13:51] go come on God Did It for a
[1:13:56] purpose it was already under control
[1:13:59] that's
[1:14:01] right said preacher what are you talking
[1:14:03] about if if you get it now if you go to
[1:14:05] Revelations 9 just read it it turns dark
[1:14:07] it's dark enough in Isaiah the Bible
[1:14:09] said Darkness will cover this Earth and
[1:14:12] gross Darkness will cover this people
[1:14:15] and it'll be a dark it'll be so dark
[1:14:18] that their understanding will be
[1:14:19] darkened and they will kill the very
[1:14:22] ones who serve God believing they're
[1:14:24] doing God of service
[1:14:26] scripture tells us it'll be the darkest
[1:14:27] of all hours that has ever been but if
[1:14:30] you read from Revelations 9 just don't
[1:14:33] quit reading and read right into
[1:14:35] Revelations 10 and see if it doesn't say
[1:14:38] and another Mighty Angel amen we talk
[1:14:40] about an Angel that's leading hell but
[1:14:42] what about an angel leading Heaven
[1:14:44] there's another angel coming down out of
[1:14:47] Heaven amen just like it came unto Moses
[1:14:50] the angel of the Lord came down in this
[1:14:54] generation listen to me in the darkest
[1:14:56] of all hours that's when Jesus stepped
[1:14:59] in in the middle of the storm that's
[1:15:02] when Jesus stepped in I tell you the
[1:15:04] situation is already under control
[1:15:08] another Mighty Angel descended Out of
[1:15:10] Heaven you know what he had he had a
[1:15:12] book in his
[1:15:14] hand let me let me give you good news it
[1:15:17] was
[1:15:19] open I'm sorry for these folks running
[1:15:21] around and believing that book's still
[1:15:23] closed because every situation is the
[1:15:26] end every situation there's no hope
[1:15:29] every dark time they just got to
[1:15:30] together they waving amen wavering like
[1:15:33] children from one place to another they
[1:15:35] can't settle in their Spirit where
[1:15:37] they're going and what God's going to do
[1:15:39] with them but listen to me when that
[1:15:41] book opened up unto them the Bible said
[1:15:44] seven Thunders uttered their voices and
[1:15:46] John was about to write it but a voice
[1:15:48] said seal it up John it's not quite time
[1:15:52] yet but in the days of the the voice of
[1:15:56] the seventh angel Ved in the days of
[1:15:59] William brandom God was going to unseal
[1:16:02] that book and there would come the voice
[1:16:04] of seven Thunders now listen I don't
[1:16:06] have time to preach seven Thunders let's
[1:16:08] just get it out here amen seven Thunders
[1:16:10] is a symbol for the voice of God come on
[1:16:14] and the voice of God will wake the Dead
[1:16:17] the voice of God will give you Grace it
[1:16:20] will give you faith for Rapture the
[1:16:22] voice of God will awaken the bride the
[1:16:25] voice of God y'all know what I'm doing
[1:16:29] I'm preaching you the message of this
[1:16:33] hour and we can see we can see that
[1:16:37] William brandham was the messenger of
[1:16:40] the seventh angel and we can see that he
[1:16:42] was a messenger of that open book that
[1:16:44] was in Revelations 5 was closed but in
[1:16:47] Revelations 10 is opened that's right
[1:16:51] listen I think it's powerful to know
[1:16:53] this
[1:16:55] the book that was closed in Revelations
[1:16:56] 5 couldn't be looked at by anybody or
[1:16:59] touched by
[1:17:00] anybody but in Revelations 10 the scene
[1:17:04] changes and John who is a type of the
[1:17:07] Bride amen is not only able to take the
[1:17:10] book he is commanded to take the book
[1:17:13] and to eat the book so preacher what
[1:17:15] does that mean it means eat this message
[1:17:18] it means consume the word of your day it
[1:17:21] means consume these tapes and these
[1:17:23] books and feed on them they are
[1:17:25] spiritual food in due season to give you
[1:17:28] the the it gives you the vitamins you
