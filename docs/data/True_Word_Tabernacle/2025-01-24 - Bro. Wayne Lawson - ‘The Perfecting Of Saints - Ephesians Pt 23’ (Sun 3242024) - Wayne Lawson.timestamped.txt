[7:10] prophets and some evangelists and some
[7:14] pastors and
[7:15] teachers now brother Brandon calls those
[7:18] angels in the pulpit and he said they're
[7:21] standing right next to God and he again
[7:24] says that it is the highest form there
[7:26] is to hear from God amen amen and now
[7:30] they're giving for the perfecting of the
[7:33] Saints for the work of the
[7:38] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[7:43] Christ till we all come in the unity of
[7:46] faith and un the knowledge of the Son of
[7:48] God unto a perfect
[7:51] man unto the measure of the stature of
[7:54] the fullness of Christ that we
[7:57] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[8:00] and fro carried about with every wind of
[8:02] Doctrine by the slight of man the
[8:04] cunning craftiness whereby they lay and
[8:06] wait to
[8:07] deceive but speaking the truth and love
[8:11] yes may grow up into him in all things
[8:15] which is the head even Christ we ask the
[8:19] Lord to bless his word as you could be
[8:21] seated this morning and I want to speak
[8:23] to you just a little bit today if I take
[8:24] a context over this I want to talk to
[8:27] you about the perfecting of saints
[8:31] about the perfecting of saints now one
[8:34] thing we uh have established and if you
[8:36] were with us in the last series uh
[8:38] moment we were talking about the
[8:39] ministry of the New Covenant and we were
[8:42] talking about the moving from an old
[8:44] Covenant to a New Covenant we're talking
[8:45] about moving from law to Grace we're
[8:49] talking about moving from carnal
[8:50] Commandments to the spirit of the Living
[8:53] God we're talking about a Messianic
[8:55] Covenant of where the that the Old
[8:58] Testament Covenant was unto the Jew and
[9:00] it was unto the Seed of Abraham
[9:02] naturally speaking but this New Covenant
[9:05] was unto every part of the human race
[9:07] through all the nations of the earth thy
[9:10] seed shall be blessed so it was a
[9:11] blessing unto all of them and we're
[9:13] finding that the that the word in the
[9:16] book of Hebrews being a key chapter the
[9:18] book of Hebrews was a chapter that was
[9:21] going to separate law and Grace it is a
[9:24] key book in the Bible uh it was where
[9:26] Paul took the Old Testament law and
[9:29] begin to divide it and show you what it
[9:31] was coming uh Paul tells us here of
[9:34] course that we're looking for perfection
[9:36] in Hebrews chapter 7 he says that if
[9:39] there be a Perfection were under the
[9:41] levitical priesthood under it the people
[9:44] receive the law what further need was
[9:46] there for another priest to arise after
[9:49] the order of mezc and not be called
[9:52] after the order of Aaron now we're going
[9:54] to talk about perfection and if if
[9:57] Perfection would have been under the
[9:58] other priesthood there would have been
[10:00] no reason for him to speak of another
[10:03] because it would have been complete or
[10:05] full it would have been enough but
[10:07] because it wasn't enough there had to be
[10:09] a change in priesthood and the Bible
[10:12] says for the priesthood being changed
[10:14] then there is a necessity also of
[10:16] changing the law so if you have a change
[10:18] in priesthood then you have to have a
[10:20] change in order or it didn't do any good
[10:23] because the old priest under the Old Law
[10:25] could not bring Perfection to the people
[10:28] but he's saying there is become a new
[10:29] one a necessity a changing of the law
[10:32] this is evident that God has designed
[10:35] both the law and the priesthood to
[10:37] introduce Jesus as the priest and only
[10:40] sacrifice and he's taken and taken the
[10:43] gospel system and placed it in the place
[10:45] of the law and the and the Old Testament
[10:48] way of doing things so what we find then
[10:50] is that our lord Jesus gave us a place
[10:53] at the altar where we had no place for
[10:56] it was only the levite only under the
[10:58] son of Aaron were allowed to come into
[11:01] that place but here there was by oath of
[11:05] God that there would be another priest
[11:07] arise after the order of MDC and that he
[11:10] would not be of the tribe of Levi but he
[11:12] would be of the tribe of Judah is that
[11:15] right now and and when you study the
[11:17] tribe of Judah it's very powerful
[11:19] because that tribe was the one that
[11:21] Caleb got into wasn't it it was the
[11:23] tribe of Judah where his possessions
[11:25] were it was the tribe of Judah Caleb was
[11:27] a gentile and found possession in Israel
[11:29] under the tribe of Judah amen that tribe
[11:32] of Judah was where Rahab found her place
[11:34] in the Covenant was under that tribe of
[11:36] Judah and under the tribe of Judah is
[11:39] where the spiritual Seed of Abraham
[11:41] would give a blessing unto all the
[11:43] nations of the Earth would be blessed
[11:45] unto the tribe of Judah so For unto them
[11:47] things were spoken per pertaineth to
[11:50] another tribe of which no man gave
[11:52] attendance at the altar it's evident
[11:54] that our Lord spring out of Judah which
[11:56] Moses spoke nothing concerning the
[11:58] priesthood it is yet more far evident
[12:01] for after the similitude of mcedc there
[12:04] arises another priest now watch the
[12:06] beauty of this who is made not after the
[12:08] law of a carnal commandment other but no
[12:10] no law made Jesus a priest he wasn't
[12:13] born right for it he wasn't in the right
[12:15] tried for Moses's law but after the
[12:18] power of an endless life then his
[12:20] priesthood was not a law his priesthood
[12:23] was the power of an endless life and
[12:25] that is the calling of every one of this
[12:28] five-fold ministry under the priesthood
[12:30] of mecdc that we have been empowered by
[12:33] the power of endless life there's no
[12:35] there's no denomination somewhere that's
[12:37] saying that we can preach the gospel
[12:39] there's no headship somewhere there's no
[12:41] big church system set up somewhere that
[12:43] says we can preach the gospel but we
[12:46] preach it under the authority and the
[12:48] power of an endless life not of carnal
[12:50] Commandments see we're not under
[12:52] denominational ages we have come under
[12:54] the power of endless life there is a
[12:56] priest Forever After the all after the
[12:59] after the order of MDC the law amen
[13:02] therefore verily disannulling the
[13:04] Commandments before the weakness and the
[13:06] unprofitable thereof so if they're no
[13:08] good they're disen alled they was not
[13:10] profitable for the law could make
[13:12] nothing
[13:14] perfect but the bringing of a better
[13:16] hope which we draw nigh unto God that's
[13:18] why he says in Romans 8 that the the
[13:21] weakness of the law he says he couldn't
[13:23] do it because the law was weak through
[13:25] the flesh so as long as there is a flesh
[13:29] there's going to be a weakness and the
[13:30] law could never perfect you because it
[13:33] was all done in the flesh that's why in
[13:35] Hebrews 10:4 amen Paul said it is
[13:38] impossible somebody say impossible it is
[13:41] not possible amen that the blood of
[13:44] goats can take away sin it's not
[13:46] possible amen and it's not possible that
[13:49] you can quit smoking and take away sin
[13:51] or that you can quit gambling and take
[13:53] away sin or you can join a church and
[13:56] take away sin or you can shake hands and
[13:58] take away sin or you can be the member
[14:00] of a church and take away sin there is
[14:03] only one way to take away sin and that
[14:06] is by the effect the power of the blood
[14:09] of Jesus Christ the son of God that shed
[14:12] his blood for every man woman and child
[14:14] sitting in this building it's not for
[14:16] just a Jew it's not for just the servant
[14:19] it's not just for the male or the female
[14:21] but it's for every bit of the human race
[14:24] that God has called to the authority and
[14:27] to the power it is not possible for it
[14:29] to do it but God has made this possible
[14:32] amen that he has taken away the first
[14:34] and established the second that's why it
[14:36] says in Hebrews 10:14 for by one
[14:39] offering he hath perfected forever them
[14:42] that are Sanctified now watch this by
[14:45] one offering he has perfected forever
[14:48] that is the key verse of perfection for
[14:51] the church for by one offering Heath
[14:53] perfected see if we have a perfect
[14:55] sacrifice then we have Perfection if
[14:58] there's no perfect sacrifice there is no
[15:00] Perfection but we have perfected forever
[15:04] come on by that
[15:06] sacrifice so then what we then therefore
[15:09] find is we find the words of Our Lord in
[15:12] Matthew 5 and 48 is both a command and a
[15:16] promise be ye therefore perfect even as
[15:19] my Father in Heaven is perfect there's
[15:22] your there's the requirement Perfection
[15:24] which of you can obtain it come on now
[15:28] amen get your bootstraps and pull
[15:30] yourself to the
[15:31] Moon let the leopard lick his spots off
[15:36] he'll only make them shine brighter amen
[15:39] but what we found amen that the word of
[15:42] the Lord included both command and
[15:45] promise when he said be ye therefore
[15:47] perfect he has got to supply a way of
[15:50] perfection if God requires it he's got
[15:53] to provide it because man cannot obtain
[15:56] Perfection he bled thousands and
[15:59] thousands of gallons of blood trying to
[16:01] wash away sin and he couldn't do it but
[16:04] in one offering our lord Jesus perfected
[16:07] forever them that are Sanctified the
[16:10] subject is
[16:11] perfection brother Ram says it per the
[16:14] position of believer 1955 if you like to
[16:16] study these sermons this is a good one
[16:18] for you 1955 the position of a Believer
[16:21] the subject is perfection that's his
[16:23] words he he said how can a mortal man
[16:25] ever become
[16:27] perfected see see yet the word said that
[16:31] he chose us to be holy and perfect
[16:34] before the foundation of the world
[16:36] Ephesians 1 amen now how you going to do
[16:39] it Jesus even said be perfect even as
[16:41] our father in Heaven is perfect now if
[16:44] God before the world ordained that you
[16:46] should be holy and Without Blame and
[16:49] perfect in the sight of God and we are
[16:52] struggling and we are murmuring but
[16:55] don't you think God seen all these
[16:57] things come on right amen amen and he
[17:00] fornew it and he predestinated and he
[17:03] ordained it us to be so elected before
[17:07] there ever was formed now here's the
[17:09] power of this that you were perfected
[17:11] before you
[17:16] began so God perfected you in eternity
[17:19] and let me ask you this can you change
[17:21] in time what God did in
[17:24] eternity no but what we do find is that
[17:27] we struggle and we murmur and we wonder
[17:29] how could this be but see God commands
[17:32] it and he also promises it by his
[17:34] command if it's calling un Perfection he
[17:37] has to provide the Perfection if we need
[17:40] a perfect sacrifice we had none he had
[17:43] to provide perfect sacrifice in Hebrews
[17:46] chapter 6:1 Paul says it beautifully let
[17:48] us leave the principles of the doctrine
[17:50] of Christ and let us go on unto
[17:54] Perfection not laying again the
[17:56] foundation of repentance from dead works
[17:58] in the faith toward god brother man
[18:00] breaks into this and he said quit doing
[18:01] what man can do in other words dead
[18:04] Works Amen in other words man can work
[18:06] you can do a lot of Works amen but if
[18:08] them works are dead they don't bring
[18:10] life you can just keep doing the right
[18:13] works and it won't be
[18:15] right you see a man that's unsaved you
[18:18] can do all the works right but you're
[18:20] still a dead
[18:21] man he remember if a man ever gets life
[18:24] and gets perfection in him then his
[18:26] Works become Perfect by the one that has
[18:29] perfected him listen he said let us go
[18:31] on un Perfection I don't know about you
[18:34] but that's where I want to
[18:36] go I want to go on unto Perfection amen
[18:39] now watch Matthew 5:28 again he said see
[18:42] then therefore there is a Perfection and
[18:44] brother bandam says that perfected
[18:46] forever then we are then perfect through
[18:49] Christ we are free from judgment through
[18:52] Christ we shall never die through Christ
[18:56] we have lost we have lost death and
[18:58] found life through Christ not through
[19:00] any church not through denomination not
[19:03] through any fantastic not through
[19:05] speaking in tongues not through shouting
[19:07] not through shaking not through dancing
[19:08] in the spirit but by Grace God calls you
[19:12] who he will and it's all by
[19:15] election Oh Glory to God then you want
[19:18] to shout a little while don't you
[19:20] because see it's by election and when
[19:21] you learn it's by election and it's not
[19:23] by works brother get out of my way just
[19:27] get out of my way cuz I'm going going to
[19:29] Perfection and there's nothing that can
[19:31] stop the Church of the Living God
[19:33] because Perfection is their calling it's
[19:36] the it's the calling it's a promise it
[19:38] is a destination of the bride and God
[19:42] himself has come to lead us and guide us
[19:44] unto Perfection Perfection is where
[19:46] we're going God calls us and it's not
[19:48] him that willth and it's not him that
[19:50] runneth but it is God that shows his
[19:54] Mercy if you're going to get Perfection
[19:56] you're going to have to get man out of
[19:57] it cuz there's no per man as a perfect
[20:00] God so the only way to bring Perfection
[20:02] to the church is move on from the dead
[20:05] works and get to the baptism of the Holy
[20:07] Ghost and where Perfection can come into
[20:09] the soul amen it does away with the old
[20:12] and it brings a new it's not just a new
[20:14] Leaf or turning over it's a new birth a
[20:17] new
[20:18] creature a new creation yes sir right
[20:22] old creation has the same nature is that
[20:25] right uh me and brother gorb was walking
[20:27] the other day long the creek and I was
[20:29] just talking to him about raccoons and
[20:30] trapping raccoons and things and I said
[20:32] the thing about a raccoon is nature
[20:34] never changes see so you can accumulate
[20:36] deception you can accumulate how to trap
[20:39] a raccoon because from generation to
[20:41] generation you can get smarter and
[20:43] smarter he don't move he's the same
[20:44] creature so you can you can advance in
[20:47] your deception of that creature but if
[20:50] you're if you're talking about an otter
[20:52] he don't trap the same as a traps
[20:55] right so you take about a human being
[20:58] the Satan has been compiling deception
[21:01] to trap human beings since the beginning
[21:04] of time and he's getting better and
[21:07] better and better and better at it
[21:09] matter of fact by the end time the Bible
[21:11] says It'll be such a deception that the
[21:13] elect will be deceived if it were
[21:16] possible but it's not possible see
[21:18] because there's another life in there
[21:20] there's a gene in there that's another
[21:22] creation they have Theos or deity inside
[21:26] of them so when you take a nature change
[21:28] you're no longer just a human being with
[21:31] human nature now you're a Divine being
[21:34] with divine nature and you react
[21:36] differently than other people react
[21:38] because it is a change of nature is that
[21:41] right it's a nature of God so don't act
[21:44] like a human because you get trapped
[21:45] like a
[21:48] human right now now somebody said
[21:51] brother Wayne do you believe in New
[21:52] Birth of course I believe in New Birth
[21:54] it is the first Doctrine Jesus ever
[21:55] preached yes sir and he didn't say you
[21:57] should be born again he said you
[22:00] must you must because it's got to be
[22:03] creation you must be born again we have
[22:06] some of our our friends here from
[22:07] Pennsylvania this morning amen and God
[22:10] is that you Johnny amen I like that
[22:13] haircut God bless you amen amen but but
[22:16] they were in the house the other night
[22:17] and was it in your house Johnny amen he
[22:20] would called me the other night he said
[22:21] brother Wayne something's just happened
[22:22] here now you know that the Amish
[22:24] wouldn't have electricity back there in
[22:25] Pennsylvania amen but there was
[22:27] something happened back back there they
[22:29] were all in the house and even mom and
[22:30] dad was outside and there was a voice
[22:33] spoke out in the home that was the same
[22:36] voice that you would hear on the tape
[22:38] and it said be born again you
[22:43] must you know you know friend when God
[22:46] begins to deal with
[22:48] somebody he begins to deal with them and
[22:51] it's not him that willth nor him that
[22:53] runneth but it's when God begins to call
[22:58] amen when the Holy Spirit begins to draw
[23:00] and the Bible said no man come unto me
[23:03] unless my father draw them but when God
[23:05] begins to draw them there ain't enough
[23:07] Devils there ain't enough tradition
[23:09] there ain't enough family there ain't
[23:11] enough trouble but by Grace God begins
[23:13] to call a man he's going to bring them
[23:15] to Perfection it's Perfection let's go
[23:19] let's drop our bags let's drop our
[23:22] popcorn let's get aside and let's get on
[23:25] this train of perfection it's moving
[23:27] into the promises of God God Amen that's
[23:29] what it is amen what is it amen you're
[23:32] getting in the body of Christ now here's
[23:34] the thing this entire chapter of
[23:37] Ephesians had been dedicated from the
[23:39] beginning to the Saints which are at
[23:42] Ephesus sir Saints right the Sanctified
[23:46] ones brother brandom says this is not an
[23:49] Evangelical book this is a book of
[23:52] positioning right to the Saints which
[23:55] are in Christ Jesus now how are you
[23:58] going to to get into Christ except you
[24:00] be baptized into that body 1 Corinthians
[24:03] 12 the Bible said by one Spirit we're
[24:07] baptized into one body and that being
[24:10] the body of Christ to be a saint see
[24:12] people say well you know St Cecilia or
[24:14] Saint uh Joseph or there's all kinds of
[24:17] sainthood and we were actually walking
[24:19] and found a little thing to the saint of
[24:21] bicycles I don't know who that is
[24:23] bicycle rares guess but everybody's got
[24:24] a saint you know and and we were
[24:29] I guess they've been around a while I
[24:30] don't know but but everybody's got a
[24:33] saint you know and that's the problem
[24:35] brother R said the problem is is people
[24:37] are praying to
[24:38] Saints but they they don't get to be
[24:40] sainthood till they
[24:42] die he said but we believe in Saints
[24:45] which are alive the Saints which was
[24:48] living in Ephesus because when you
[24:51] commune with dead people it is communing
[24:53] with dead it is
[24:55] witchcraft it's witchcraft folks to to
[24:58] deal with dead people amen now now watch
[25:01] this because somebody said to brother
[25:03] brandom they said but you talk to Jesus
[25:05] he said but brother he's not
[25:08] dead that same Jesus we're talking about
[25:11] is not in a tomb in Jerusalem he rose up
[25:14] on the third day and appeared unto his
[25:17] disciples and he spoke to them of the
[25:19] kingdom of God what I'm telling you this
[25:21] morning is you can talk to Jesus all day
[25:24] and all night he is a saint but he's
[25:26] still alive he's still still alive and
[25:29] to them that are Sanctified listen you
[25:31] can't get into heaven without
[25:33] Perfection now I'm tell you you can't
[25:35] get there brother B said the shadows of
[25:37] things to come subject Paul is speaking
[25:39] Perfection and God requires it no one
[25:42] can ever come to Heaven outside of being
[25:44] perfect you must be perfect yet the
[25:47] scripture says None is perfect well
[25:50] there you
[25:51] go you're locked out there you go you
[25:54] got to be perfect and none of you
[25:56] are that locks it out so if you must be
[26:00] perfect to come to heaven and the
[26:01] scripture said none is perfect we've all
[26:04] come sinned and come short of the glory
[26:06] of God how we ever going to get into
[26:09] God's living place and Dwelling Place
[26:11] when he requires Perfection Jesus said
[26:13] in the sermon be you therefore perfect
[26:15] even as my Father in Heaven that God
[26:17] requires of a person is perfection
[26:21] that's what he requires but the
[26:22] scripture said be you perfect but listen
[26:25] how you going to do it brother Bram says
[26:27] how can you do it how can you be as
[26:29] perfect as god is
[26:32] perfect now we're not talking about kind
[26:34] of perfect we're talking about like
[26:36] perfect
[26:37] perfect we're talking about God perfect
[26:40] but that was a commission or a
[26:41] commandment by Jesus Christ in heaven
[26:44] was to be perfect you say then who can
[26:46] be saved he said hold on a minute and
[26:48] let's find out how Perfection is made
[26:51] goe sir how is perfection made then
[26:55] brother brandom goes all the way back to
[26:58] eternity and he says all the way back
[27:00] there there God foresaw through the
[27:03] streak of time and knew he would have a
[27:05] remedy to save those that were desired
[27:07] to be saved so he says Perfection didn't
[27:10] begin here Perfection began there amen
[27:14] and when God seen you in the heavens he
[27:16] said listen if you desired to be saved
[27:19] he said God had to make a way for you to
[27:21] be saved so he literally how many knows
[27:24] when he slayed the lamb he slayed it
[27:27] before the foundation of the world right
[27:29] do you know the prophet said that he
[27:31] spoke your name when he spoke of the
[27:33] lamb and he said you were associated
[27:35] with the lamb in him before the
[27:37] foundation of the world and your name
[27:39] was written and recorded on the Lamb's
[27:41] Book of Life before the foundation of
[27:43] the world now that's a powerful thing
[27:45] because if you're in the Lamb's Book of
[27:47] Life Now get me you're not going to join
[27:49] the Lamb's Book of Life you were in the
[27:51] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[27:52] foundation of the world and the Lamb's
[27:55] Book of Life amen is only names
[27:58] right somebody say only names now now
[28:01] you say preacher why is that important
[28:03] because there's no box beside it for
[28:05] your works there's no there's no place
[28:08] to add your like if you ever filled out
[28:10] something and you run out you got a long
[28:12] name like mine it's a bunch of letters
[28:13] and there's no more room in the box and
[28:15] it's just your name and amen you maybe
[28:17] want to put something else but there's
[28:19] nothing there it's just your name and
[28:20] God just put your name in the Lamb's
[28:22] Book and there's no Works beside it
[28:26] somebody said well what what are we
[28:27] going to do in judgment that's just it
[28:30] the bride never goes through judgment
[28:32] there's no reason to have works with a
[28:35] name there's no judgment to the bride
[28:37] for them that have heard the word of God
[28:39] believe the word of God has passed from
[28:42] Death un life and shall not come into
[28:44] condemnation well Glory I Think It's
[28:46] Shouting Time to know that God has put
[28:48] us somewhere can I say it to you he put
[28:51] you high and dry and there's no
[28:53] priesthood there's no doctors of
[28:55] divinity there's no theologians can take
[28:57] you out if God put you in brother thank
[29:01] God this morning you can't blot my name
[29:03] out you can't add sin to my name I'll
[29:06] give you scripture who can bring
[29:08] anything to the charge of God's elect
[29:11] they were elected before the foundation
[29:13] of the world the blood of Jesus covered
[29:16] it Sanctified them and perfected them by
[29:20] his own atoning offering so only can you
[29:23] come this morning either you're going to
[29:25] bring your works or his works but if if
[29:28] you're going to bring one of your works
[29:29] you got to bring all of your works so I
[29:31] don't want none of my works I want the
[29:34] work of Christ because I was condemned
[29:36] at my birth but by the grace of God I've
[29:39] had another
[29:41] [Applause]
[29:44] birth
[29:47] brother you can't help when you're born
[29:49] that you were born into genetical
[29:54] imperfections you
[29:56] know some of you some of you got all
[29:58] kinds of genetical imperfections and you
[30:00] were born into that and you're no more
[30:02] responsible for that than the man of the
[30:04] Moon you were born into that well why
[30:08] can't we have genetical Perfection right
[30:11] amen come on now spiritually speaking
[30:15] you've had a new birth but when you were
[30:17] born again you were born of another
[30:19] parent and there is a perfect genetics
[30:22] in
[30:25] God I'll tell you what that now listen
[30:28] if there had never been sin you would
[30:30] have been born perfect in the garden
[30:31] y'all know
[30:33] that come on now but the devil got in
[30:36] and brother Bram said the Perfection
[30:37] chain was broken right and God invented
[30:40] time right and it was for the devil so
[30:44] in this little hickey of time Perfect
[30:46] Circle broken Perfection remember
[30:48] Perfect Circle broken and a hickey of
[30:50] time came down and God let them and he
[30:53] calls it a time space so that time space
[30:57] is like just a you have a perfect circle
[30:59] and then there's just a little hump down
[31:01] at the bottom it broke Perfection but in
[31:04] that little space now we're going to
[31:05] call it 6,000 years but in that little
[31:08] 6,000 year space something's going to
[31:10] happen in there what's going to happen
[31:13] in there the prophet said that's where
[31:15] Redemption takes place that's where
[31:18] Redemption place takes that's where you
[31:20] learn he's a savior and he's a Healer
[31:23] that's where you learn what kind of God
[31:25] you're serving and you see the glory of
[31:27] God the power of God and brother B said
[31:29] someday he's going to pull it back into
[31:32] Perfection again and that'll all be done
[31:34] away with so in the eternities you'll
[31:37] know what he is to be a savior but you
[31:39] won't remember the sin you'll know he's
[31:41] a Healer but you won't remember the
[31:44] sickness now now look look at the power
[31:46] of this you say what happens in see that
[31:48] element of time it is an imperfection
[31:51] and we're all in in Perfection because
[31:53] of that element of time but the element
[31:55] of time is what makes you realize
[31:56] Perfection do you you know that your
[31:58] arch enemy is the devil did I need to
[32:01] preach on that or you you you good with
[32:03] that how many knows he's your enemy he's
[32:06] not your
[32:07] friend even when he's friendly he's not
[32:09] your friend he's your enemy all the time
[32:12] that Devil's an enemy to the Church of
[32:14] the Living God but that devil was in
[32:17] heaven your enemy was in heaven and your
[32:20] enemy would have always been there
[32:22] except God made this little place of
[32:24] time and in that place of time the enemy
[32:28] your arch enemy will'll be destroyed
[32:30] forever you tell you today that God's
[32:32] going to annihilate that devil because
[32:34] he's not a part of the original
[32:36] Perfection he's going to be destroyed
[32:38] now what that really means to you is
[32:41] that there is a place in your new birth
[32:43] to destroy your
[32:46] enemy amen now it's a great chain of
[32:49] perfection and it's coming down through
[32:51] there now it's the it's it's questions
[32:54] and answers 1964 brother brandom they
[32:56] ask him should we we come to the church
[32:59] for
[33:00] Perfection should we come in in one
[33:03] place should we listen to the tapes and
[33:04] things for Perfection and brother BR
[33:07] said well you're going to get fellowship
[33:08] with one another at the church but the
[33:11] perfecting comes between you and
[33:14] God the blood of Christ is what perfects
[33:18] Us in the holy
[33:21] spirit so preacher what are you getting
[33:23] at let's look at this sin's judgment the
[33:26] Judgment of sin this day you should die
[33:28] is to take life now notice how people
[33:31] now can look and see that how we believe
[33:34] so supremely in the blood of the Lord
[33:37] Jesus why do we believe so supremely in
[33:40] the blood of the Lord
[33:42] Jesus because it's the only place to
[33:45] take away sin right amen see it's the
[33:48] only Perfection for the church let me
[33:50] just let me just continue in this and
[33:51] say this that if you're in the blood of
[33:53] Jesus brother R said I used to think it
[33:55] was Jewish blood I used to think it was
[33:58] a gentile he said but then one day I saw
[34:01] it was the blood of
[34:03] God I seen that the Supreme blood of the
[34:06] Lord Jesus is the blood of God now you
[34:09] see what he's saying in the exposition
[34:11] of the church ages brother Bram said
[34:13] since it's the blood of God then it is a
[34:16] perfect
[34:17] blood my goodness then it is a perfect
[34:21] blood is loosing us from the power and
[34:23] bondage and defilement of sin it is
[34:26] loosing perfect perfect and
[34:29] complete now now it's beautiful brother
[34:31] Josh gave me a good definition the other
[34:33] day I was preaching on that uh go into
[34:35] the world and preach to every creature
[34:37] that creature you kind of wonder what
[34:38] that is I've wondered what that was I
[34:40] don't know why I didn't have had seen
[34:41] the definition he was just looked the
[34:43] definition he said brother Wayne did you
[34:44] ever see this and it just said creature
[34:46] anything under
[34:48] bondage anything that is is being bound
[34:51] I'm I'm paraphrasing the definition but
[34:53] that's what it meant so so so the
[34:55] preaching of the Gospel is to liberate
[34:58] people who are under bondage now listen
[35:01] there's no greater bondage than
[35:03] religious bondage when religion takes a
[35:06] bind and holds you they hold you by fear
[35:09] that if you don't step to their tune if
[35:11] you don't join their church if you don't
[35:13] go and hear their preacher if you don't
[35:15] do it this way you don't do it this way
[35:18] they control your eternal life let me
[35:20] tell the devil and all of his angels God
[35:23] gave us eternal life the word promised
[35:25] us eternal life and the new birth
[35:27] guarantees us eternal life come on
[35:31] church amen I'm I'm not breeding
[35:32] Rebellion but I'm telling you this we'll
[35:34] not hold still for a religious spirit to
[35:37] bind us constrain us hold us this gospel
[35:40] promised freedom and brother it's
[35:42] Freedom we'll have Give me liberty or
[35:46] give me death there's not one part of
[35:48] this message we are scared of there's
[35:50] not one part of this Bible we are scared
[35:53] of I thank God this morning I can report
[35:55] to you that we can use this entire Bible
[35:58] and it is good for Doctrine and
[36:00] instruction and correction we don't have
[36:02] to come through here amen and say oh we
[36:04] can't use that one and we can't use that
[36:06] one and we can't use that one no sir
[36:09] this is the age of the full word every
[36:12] book of every part of this book is good
[36:14] for Doctrine and instruction come on
[36:16] Church let's just keep them moving and
[36:18] so is the message of the Hour come on
[36:21] you're not going to go through this
[36:22] message with me and say you can't quote
[36:24] this part and you can't quote this part
[36:27] and you can't qu this part listen amen
[36:29] the next time I hear that I may take a
[36:31] series on the part you tell me I can't
[36:35] quote come on church we won't we won't
[36:38] we won't be bound amen we won't be tore
[36:41] down we're going to be liberated in the
[36:43] presence of God Amen the Rapture may
[36:46] take place in the
[36:47] [Applause]
[36:49] morning
[36:50] wo since it's the blood of God it's a
[36:53] perfect
[36:54] loosing the loosing is complete and
[36:57] perfect now there is no more
[37:00] condemnation
[37:03] gone
[37:05] amen who shall lay anything to the
[37:07] charge of God's
[37:09] elect I love how brother Braham said
[37:11] don't you get tied down to no tradition
[37:14] create an organization don't be led
[37:17] astray by listening to those that deny
[37:19] the power of the word of God am and deny
[37:21] Jesus saves he heals he fills with the
[37:24] Holy Ghost in power you are God's free
[37:27] man
[37:29] man perfectly free in the Holy Ghost you
[37:32] are God's free man loosed by his own
[37:37] blood now watch this if you still hold
[37:40] to your faith to Creeds and
[37:42] denominations it is certain by the
[37:45] evidence that you lost your faith in the
[37:50] word so even in that freedom if you if
[37:53] you if you hold to the
[37:55] tradition then by that evidence you're
[37:57] denying the word itself that is
[37:59] liberating you amen I'll tell you this
[38:02] amen I will not deny this word if it
[38:05] says I'm
[38:07] free if it says I'm
[38:09] perfect I say be it unto me according to
[38:12] Thy word Lord cuz you know something
[38:14] about me I don't know about me and
[38:16] you've done something for me that I
[38:17] couldn't do for myself so last thing I'm
[38:20] going to do is take it out of your hands
[38:22] I'm going to give my perfection to him
[38:24] and I'm going to worship him every day
[38:26] and thank him for the good in my life I
[38:28] think somebody ought to worship him
[38:30] right now amen amen I think we ought to
[38:33] I think we ought to give praise for the
[38:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost I think we
[38:37] ought to give praise for The Liberation
[38:39] sister Megan thank God that God still
[38:42] comes in the midst of church and heals
[38:45] and saves and
[38:48] delivers I praise the name of our Lord
[38:51] Jesus for his mercy and His
[38:53] glory when Josh told me that testimony I
[38:56] about shouted in my truck I said glory
[38:58] to God that's it amen when you break the
[39:01] spirit then there's liberty in the heart
[39:04] amen I pray this morning God break every
[39:08] Spirit of bondage every Spirit of
[39:10] Oppression and tradition and allow his
[39:13] children of Liberty in
[39:15] God there's nothing so beautiful as the
[39:18] taste of Freedom amen I know I'm not a c
[39:20] Civil Rights Movement but I'll tell you
[39:22] this it was another I I just remember
[39:24] Martin Luther King sping out them great
[39:26] words free free at last thank God we are
[39:30] free at last but was they free was they
[39:34] better come on now they got tied up
[39:36] again in racism and and ideas and and
[39:39] and come on even being free they still
[39:42] have great complexes that are holding
[39:44] them in that kind of mentality in the
[39:47] civil rights in this age I refuse to
[39:49] turn around having been liberated and go
[39:52] back to denominational bondage and
[39:55] denominational ideas of prophets stood
[39:57] on the platform and said you're free
[40:00] you're free you're free you're free and
[40:03] I say thank
[40:07] God I'm
[40:11] free
[40:13] perfect perfect blood so God is a spirit
[40:17] and he overshadowed Mary and created in
[40:18] her the blood cell that brought forth
[40:20] the Son of God and through his blood we
[40:24] have access to life and our sex ual
[40:28] blood is
[40:32] dismissed hallelujah
[40:35] hallelujah amen I've had people come to
[40:37] me say brother Wayne I wasn't born right
[40:38] my I come in an illegitimate family and
[40:41] I seen the questions and answers and I
[40:43] was curious whether I could even be in
[40:45] the Rapture because some things that was
[40:47] said there and then I've heard preachers
[40:49] use it and I've been worried and I've
[40:51] wondered hey man let me let me give you
[40:53] good news they brought that question to
[40:55] brother brandom privately because of
[40:58] sister Dalton had come from that same
[41:00] kind of home and she said brother bandam
[41:02] does that mean I can't go in the Rapture
[41:04] and he wrote out a letter back to her
[41:06] and said sister we were all illegitimate
[41:08] children under Adam but Jesus by the new
[41:11] birth made us legitimate listen to me we
[41:14] were all bastard born but there's a
[41:17] legitimate promise of a new birth and
[41:20] when God gives birth to somebody they
[41:22] are legitimate and he dismisses the
[41:24] sexual birth so let me dismiss it this
[41:27] morning morning that curse of sugar
[41:29] diabetes is dismissed this morning that
[41:32] heart disease is dismissed this morning
[41:35] that stubbornness and temper and Malice
[41:37] and envy we dismiss it this morning by
[41:40] the new birth we have a new genetics
[41:43] brother listen one of these mornings
[41:44] this Soul's going to break over this
[41:46] body and there'll be a
[41:49] [Applause]
[41:51] change
[41:52] dismissed oh thank you Lord Jesus the
[41:55] prophet dismissed it
[41:58] our sexual blood is
[42:07] dismissed
[42:09] Perfection holy completely in Jesus
[42:14] Christ the book of
[42:17] Ephesians it's not an Evangelical book
[42:20] it is a book of
[42:22] positioning and
[42:24] placing it is a place to grow the church
[42:28] into a
[42:29] maturity that you know who you are you
[42:32] know what you believe you know what you
[42:35] stand for and you're able to withstand
[42:37] the enemy because of the maturity in
[42:40] your life listen this is the thing this
[42:44] book is not addressed to unbelievers
[42:47] it's to the called out to the Sanctified
[42:49] and called ones in
[42:50] Christ now as you reread Ephesians
[42:55] 4:12 it says for the perfecting of the
[42:59] Saints now let me just rephrase this for
[43:01] you what it doesn't say the perfecting
[43:05] of
[43:08] Sinners this is the perfecting of saints
[43:10] the five-fold ministry all right now
[43:13] watch there is a there is a compound we
[43:15] know the atonement brought the birth the
[43:17] atonement brought the Perfection but now
[43:20] to the
[43:21] Saints he's talking about perfecting
[43:24] them what is he talking about
[43:27] go ahe how do you perfect a perfect
[43:32] people I just spent 30 minutes proving
[43:35] to you you're perfect Beyond
[43:36] doubts and Paul to them same people is
[43:40] now saying
[43:41] perfecting so this must be something
[43:44] besides the English word that would give
[43:47] meaning so it's amazing if you go into
[43:49] the Greek here amen it's it's oh I can't
[43:52] pronounce Greek but it's a card cardos
[43:55] it's C it's k a k t a r you got it oh
[43:58] there it is you can just read
[44:01] it everybody that can read yes
[44:04] sir we can get Nathan to pronounce
[44:08] it go ahead amen but it means
[44:13] perfecting but complete
[44:16] Furnishing
[44:18] equipping so what we're doing in this
[44:20] church amen you people get saved they
[44:23] get birthed under the preach and the
[44:25] atonement and they come to perfection
[44:27] but when you come into a new birth of
[44:29] perfection God has got this fivefold to
[44:32] equip
[44:33] you he's not equipping you in natural
[44:36] things he's equipping you in spiritual
[44:39] things now what kind of equipment would
[44:41] God give his church brother B said when
[44:44] it come to war he said the devil is
[44:46] getting the best equipment he could get
[44:47] and he advances in Warfare every year he
[44:50] said but God doesn't Advance he was
[44:52] perfect to begin with so he gave Adam
[44:55] and Eve the word in the garden
[44:57] and he said it's the word is the best
[44:59] weapon we have to equip the church with
[45:01] so what the fivefold is to do is to
[45:03] equip the church with the word of their
[45:06] age that they might be able to bring to
[45:09] an
[45:09] adulthood those which have been born
[45:12] into the things of Goden listen when I
[45:15] look at this this morning you see
[45:16] there's a Furnishing or an equipping of
[45:20] the believer this refers to the
[45:22] restoring of anything to its place
[45:26] putting it in
[45:28] order making it
[45:30] complete my goodness when I look at this
[45:33] see Christians may have every possible
[45:35] advantage of becoming complete in love
[45:37] and in knowledge isn't that amazing amen
[45:40] that you that you come in you become
[45:42] perfect in your birth your soul is saved
[45:45] it's completely done but you approach
[45:47] something in your life and you don't
[45:48] know how to approach it you come up to
[45:50] something you say well I'd like to do
[45:52] this but I don't know how so what you
[45:55] have is someone equips you to bring you
[45:58] to the position in your life where you
[46:00] can handle things as Jesus would handle
[46:02] them I think it's powerful this morning
[46:05] he didn't only perfect us in our birth
[46:07] he put us an instruction over our life
[46:09] to teach us train us to move us forward
[46:12] in his mercies listen amen Christians
[46:15] amen it gives you an advantage see it
[46:17] brings an equipment under your life it
[46:20] is an equipping so that word that I just
[46:23] gave you starts with a K there amen
[46:26] y'all forgive my
[46:28] inabilities the only time in the Bible
[46:32] that this Greek word
[46:34] appears the word perfect perfecting
[46:36] Perfection appears many times in the
[46:38] English but the meaning behind it this
[46:41] is the only place in the Bible it comes
[46:44] in the perfecting the equipping of the
[46:47] saints of God now what's amazing is the
[46:50] next vers is also use this uh uh use
[46:52] some explanation watch this next verse
[46:55] uh go to Ephesians 4 and let's look in
[46:57] the 13th
[46:58] verse look in the 13th verse of
[47:01] Ephesians 4 if if I hadn't got you too
[47:03] messed up amen um I've already shut this
[47:06] portion I'll come back to it here
[47:08] Ephesians 4 and13 till we come into the
[47:12] unity of the faith and the knowledge of
[47:15] the Son of God unto a perfect
[47:19] man now isn't this amazing because now
[47:22] amen this perfect man here now give me
[47:24] the Greek on that one brother but y'all
[47:27] didn't know you coming to Greek class
[47:28] did
[47:30] you now they got a different Greek word
[47:32] for this word Perfection now we're at
[47:34] tellos that they all think that can we
[47:35] agree that's
[47:37] okay that's hillbilly for greet
[47:43] teos Man full age yeah brought to its
[47:46] end finished wanting nothing necessary
[47:50] to completeness perfect that which is
[47:52] perfect consummate human
[47:55] integrity and
[47:58] virtue of men full
[48:02] grown
[48:04] adult full of age
[48:08] mature now come on y'all Y y'all
[48:10] carrying babies with you right now but
[48:12] you still teaching them how you still
[48:14] teach them how to get dressed how to tie
[48:15] their shoes how to say their ABC you're
[48:17] teaching them how to respond how to
[48:18] socially but that's been a perfect baby
[48:21] since it was born it's a perfect human
[48:24] the moment it has life it's a human
[48:27] being it's perfectly a human but it's
[48:30] not an adult yet come on so you can't
[48:34] just get born again and set it home and
[48:36] say well I'm coming to be
[48:38] perfect there's an instruction of the
[48:41] word of God that instructs a man how to
[48:43] be an adult how to be a mature son what
[48:46] he supposed to do now watch this the
[48:48] next verse in Ephesians 4 and verse 14
[48:51] that we
[48:53] henceforth be no more children right now
[48:58] watch this tossed to and fro carried by
[49:00] every wind of Doctrine slided men and
[49:02] cies that we be no more children now
[49:04] we're going to get another Greek
[49:06] word one
[49:08] more it's a it's it's it's it's a it's a
[49:11] beautiful little
[49:13] word in in the in the Spanish I think
[49:16] they call it Nino or baby what's a baby
[49:19] in Spanish you know it's almost neee
[49:24] poost
[49:28] how y'all like
[49:30] that overnight Greek
[49:35] Theologian knee poost child babe
[49:39] childish an infant a little child a
[49:41] minor not of
[49:43] age
[49:44] childish
[49:48] untaught
[49:50] unskilled untaught see the powerful
[49:54] thing is that the the that the the Bible
[49:57] is laying out Paul is laying out the
[49:59] idea that Perfection is through the
[50:02] atonement but this five-fold ministry is
[50:04] going to equip the church and bring them
[50:08] from untaught children to mature Sons
[50:11] and Daughters of God Amen what is it it
[50:14] is a perfecting it is a referring to of
[50:18] bringing this life now here's the thing
[50:20] it's unto the perfect man watch this
[50:22] under the measure of the Statue of the
[50:25] fullness of Christ if you're going to
[50:26] tell me Perfection I got to know your
[50:29] measurement amen if I say to you she's a
[50:31] perfect wife who's measurement that's a
[50:34] perfect car whose
[50:35] measurement amen some of y'all think
[50:38] Ford's are
[50:43] perfect three Sundays in a
[50:48] row come on guys but see what I mean now
[50:52] I would never unless it's the Shelby but
[50:55] but I would never think think it was
[50:57] perfect but to the man that loves it
[51:01] that's perfect to him it perfectly
[51:03] fulfills his vision his dream his ideas
[51:06] not perfect to
[51:07] me amen and you see that Perfection is
[51:10] relative to the one who speaks a
[51:13] Perfection so when he statues when he
[51:15] draws him out God don't God don't have
[51:18] Paul pick Moses up and say until you
[51:20] come to a perfect man like Moses until
[51:23] you come to a perfect man like Paul
[51:25] until you come to a perfect man he says
[51:27] under the statue of the
[51:29] measure of the fullness of Christ can I
[51:32] say it unto the personality of
[51:36] Jesus a training listen if you would
[51:39] have been born in the Garden of Eden you
[51:41] would have had his personality back
[51:42] there but you
[51:44] wasn't so you had to have a new birth
[51:47] and when you got a new birth now you're
[51:49] passing through the word because you
[51:52] bypassed your theophany up there and you
[51:55] don't know how a son acts you don't know
[51:57] how a son talks and you don't know how a
[51:59] son does things but we're now walking
[52:01] through the message of the hour being
[52:03] developed into a full maturity of a son
[52:06] and daughter of God that you can stand
[52:08] in this earth and know exactly who you
[52:11] are where you come from what is taking
[52:13] place into a
[52:19] personality now it's promised in 1
[52:21] Thessalonians 4 a person would come the
[52:24] personality himself now watch these two
[52:27] Greek words and I'm just going to take
[52:29] for a moment NE is it knee poost can we
[52:32] can we use that and and tellos so in
[52:35] Hebrews 4:12 for when the time you ought
[52:38] to be
[52:39] teachers you have need that one teach
[52:41] you again which to be the first
[52:44] principles of the Oracles of God and
[52:46] become as such as having in need of milk
[52:49] and not of strong
[52:50] meat for everyone that useth milk is
[52:53] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[52:56] he is a
[52:59] babe knee POS be not
[53:02] children this is now calling babe but
[53:06] watch 14th verse but strong meat
[53:10] belongeth to them that are of a full
[53:14] age now that is the Greek word amen
[53:19] tellos so it could just as well say to
[53:22] them that are perfect even those by have
[53:24] reason of use their senses exercise to
[53:27] discern good and evil so what he's doing
[53:31] is he's building the principle to you
[53:33] that there are young Christians and
[53:35] there are adult Christians perfection in
[53:38] Christianity is maturity it is an adult
[53:42] Christian it's not that you don't make a
[53:44] mistake it's not that you didn't have a
[53:47] struggle or you had a bad attitude or
[53:48] you didn't do something right that's not
[53:50] the Perfection he's talking about that
[53:53] Perfection is in the blood of Jesus he's
[53:56] talking about come on to adulthood amen
[53:59] eat the word of God and manifest the
[54:01] word of God grow up into all things
[54:04] which are in Christ he's talking about
[54:06] being the teaching of the word now in
[54:08] galatian chapter 4 amen it says it
[54:11] clearly now I say that the heir as long
[54:14] as he is a child in OS same Greek word
[54:18] child babe as long as he's a child he
[54:21] differed nothing from a servant though
[54:23] he be Lord of all but he's under the
[54:26] rers and governors until the appointed
[54:28] time of the father somebody just say
[54:30] appointed time we'll get to it in a
[54:32] minute appointed time amen now watch
[54:34] this even so when we were
[54:37] children we were in the bondage under
[54:39] the elements of the world so he's
[54:41] talking about again knost now in 1
[54:43] Corinthians 14 and 20 Paul said Brethren
[54:45] be not children in understanding but in
[54:49] Malice be your children but in
[54:52] understanding be men now watch what
[54:55] we're talking about when you get
[54:57] converted there is a button about
[55:00] brother bam says a button of light about
[55:02] the size of your B uh your shirt button
[55:05] he said that enters into that converted
[55:07] man when he's born again he lets that
[55:10] Spirit grow and take out all of the root
[55:13] of bitterness and it God presses his way
[55:16] through him back in the same condition
[55:19] that he was in the Garden of Eden all
[55:21] the way to Mark 11: 24 if you say under
[55:24] this mountain can you imagine and he's
[55:26] telling you now that there's something
[55:28] about the size of this button's going to
[55:29] come in you but when it gets in there
[55:31] it's going to take
[55:33] over that when God's holy ghost gets in
[55:36] you it's going to take over listen when
[55:38] you go out here in the spring of the
[55:40] year now I'm I I got to I see things
[55:42] simple you go out here in the spring of
[55:43] the year there's no tree leaf removal
[55:46] fellow God don't have Angels come out of
[55:49] the heavens put ladders up against the
[55:50] oak trees and get up there and pull the
[55:52] old oak leaves off of the tree but
[55:55] somehow the oak Le gets off of there
[55:58] it's because under the spring of the
[56:00] Year there is a resurrection power of
[56:02] new life begins in that tree and when
[56:05] New Life Starts putting on it pushes old
[56:07] life off so that old dead leaf just
[56:10] falls off and a new leaf takes its place
[56:12] listen Christianity is a growth and when
[56:15] you get born again all you got to do is
[56:17] start eating and drinking and growing
[56:19] eating drinking and growing eating
[56:21] drinking and growing and after a little
[56:23] while you'll push malice out you'll push
[56:26] jealousy out you'll push that part out
[56:28] that old dirty thing will go away that
[56:31] habit will leave you won't have hunger
[56:32] for this or hunger for that and after a
[56:34] little while you'll turn around and say
[56:36] what happened to me I'll tell you what
[56:38] happened it is a progression of your
[56:41] faith from Glory unto Glory we are
[56:44] changing by the word of God being
[56:49] equipped hallelujah hallelujah amen it's
[56:52] the growth of it see you're maturing
[56:54] you're growing when you ought to be
[56:55] teaching teachers you're still babes
[56:57] having need of teaching but watch
[56:58] something in you growing out pushing out
[57:00] making bigger it's the Holy Spirit the
[57:03] new birth is a born from the outside
[57:05] you're born from the inside out it grows
[57:09] it
[57:10] lives listen when the birth is on the
[57:13] inside shouldn't it grow and when Christ
[57:16] is in your heart it should be growing
[57:18] daily getting bigger more powerful
[57:20] understanding forgiving walking as God
[57:22] would walk until Christ is formed in you
[57:26] am let me give you a part of this one
[57:29] Christ growing in you growing out malice
[57:32] taking it out of you pushing it out God
[57:34] comes in pushes it out how little
[57:36] juvenile little things how much kids to
[57:39] argue and fuss but the first thing you
[57:40] know it just grows over the top of it
[57:43] ain't got no more room for it oh I like
[57:46] that don't you amen when we ain't got no
[57:48] more room for that thing it used to hate
[57:50] it we used to hating things but I just
[57:52] don't pay any attention to it anymore

[58:04] sometimes we have growing pains in the
[58:06] church but listen that's all it is it's
[58:08] just a growing pain don't don't don't
[58:10] get shook up don't get troubled amen

[59:21] your eyes and you find out the old
[59:23] lustful things that used to look at you
[59:25] turn your head then the first thing you
[59:27] know amen you turn your head but you're
[59:29] thinking and after a while it grows into
[59:31] your mind and you don't think about it

[59:35] great big boy then and you're coming
[59:37] into a full matured man living for the
[59:40] Lord he so then you are Christ you are a

[1:00:08] pyramid that brother random draw us it
[1:00:10] will become in a minority but it'll have
[1:00:12] greater power than any part of the
[1:00:14] church that's ever had she'll speak
[1:00:16] where he speaks she'll live where he
[1:00:18] lives she'll come into the image of God
[1:00:21] Amen let me tell you the Church of the
[1:00:22] Living God is growing up in Christ can I
[1:00:25] say this to you we are not in the foot
[1:00:27] age we are not in the knee age or the
[1:00:29] hip age or amen we're not even in the
[1:00:31] mouth age we're not even in the eye age
[1:00:34] we're in the mind the Divine
[1:00:35] intelligence of God has come down into
[1:00:38] the church she knows what he wants done
[1:00:40] with his
[1:00:42] word he's sharing his mind how does how
[1:00:45] does a how does a grown man share with a
[1:00:47] three-year-old how to build a house how
[1:00:50] do you teach your three-year-old how to
[1:00:52] how to lay the roof and how to I can't
[1:00:54] even get it good how 412 I know what it
[1:00:58] means but I have no clue how to get
[1:01:00] it amen how you going to explain that to
[1:01:02] a three-year-old God wanted to share
[1:01:05] eternal life and how could he share
[1:01:08] eternal life with Adam but he said
[1:01:10] through the Tree of Life when it become
[1:01:13] mature it would produce fruit and that
[1:01:15] fruit would mature in a certain age I I
[1:01:18] pray I didn't get too deep into that but
[1:01:20] you see what I'm saying there's got to
[1:01:22] be a sharing of life there's got to be a
[1:01:24] sharing come on now you if a grown man's

[1:04:27] and what did David reflect I tell you
[1:04:28] what brother Ram said he said it
[1:04:30] reflected the coming of a perfect
[1:04:32] bridegroom amen David was reflecting one
[1:04:35] was coming cuz he wasn't perfect and
[1:04:38] Moses was reflecting one coming cuz he

[1:04:49] brandom says watch this now and Luther
[1:04:52] reflected
[1:04:53] something and Wesley reflected something
[1:04:57] and Pentecost reflected something they
[1:05:00] reflected the coming of a Perfect
[1:05:04] Bride come my goodness think about this
[1:05:06] this morning can I say this to you I
[1:05:09] don't care how you feel the alpha has
[1:05:11] become the Omega amen let me ask you who
[1:05:16] has the right to announce
[1:05:21] Perfection is it is do do do I have the
[1:05:23] right to look at you and say well you're
[1:05:25] perfect
[1:05:26] listen the only one that can do that is
[1:05:29] the author of
[1:05:30] you no different than it was with
[1:05:33] Michelangelo when he was building his
[1:05:35] Moses amen he said it was perfect the
[1:05:39] one that was creating it said it was
[1:05:41] perfect listen and it is per perfect
[1:05:44] when the Creator says it's perfect and
[1:05:46] here we come to this age with a season
[1:05:48] of perfection with a prophit office of
[1:05:51] God to announce perfection in an age
[1:05:54] amen let me say say this to you
[1:05:56] perfection in the wheat field is when
[1:05:58] the seed comes to
[1:06:00] maturity perfectly wheat it's not husk
[1:06:04] it's not Chuck it's not stalk it's seed
[1:06:07] Perfection right now in the Old
[1:06:10] Testament you know what they did Brother
[1:06:11] Levis they took the sheath waving of the
[1:06:14] of the field and they would take the
[1:06:16] first mature seed they take a they take
[1:06:18] a big bunch of what they believed was
[1:06:20] perfect seed and they' take it unto the
[1:06:23] to the levite and they would call a wave
[1:06:26] offering and they would wave that sheath
[1:06:28] before the Lord and the sheath would be
[1:06:32] accepted as mature
[1:06:35] grain then the whole field it come out
[1:06:37] of was accepted with a sheath offering
[1:06:42] the prophet of God said there's got to
[1:06:43] come a sheath offering in this bright
[1:06:46] age there's got to come one to maturity
[1:06:48] and somebody said well Christ is the
[1:06:50] sheath of course Christ is but we're
[1:06:52] talking about Christ getting in a human
[1:06:56] we saw him do it in a virgin born body
[1:06:59] okay amen we saw a man born of Virgin we
[1:07:03] saw the sinless Perfection we saw how he
[1:07:05] acted we saw how he walked but the
[1:07:08] promise is the nature that's in him
[1:07:10] would come into my bride in the last
[1:07:12] days so we see a man William brandom
[1:07:15] come to the Earth and he's born of sex
[1:07:17] and he's got issues and he's got
[1:07:19] troubles but God made a promise
[1:07:21] Perfection was going to come upon the
[1:07:23] Church of the Living God so God God
[1:07:25] picks this man up and begins to wave him
[1:07:28] before the world and say this is what
[1:07:31] maturity looks
[1:07:33] [Applause]
[1:07:34] like and if there was a mature son in
[1:07:37] our age he has announced it is the age
[1:07:41] of maturity the seed has come the seed
[1:07:46] again I wish I had a way to explain it
[1:07:48] to you but there's seasons of your crop
[1:07:50] and you look out there and everything's
[1:07:52] putting on leaves and then you see a
[1:07:54] season everything's putting on shuck and
[1:07:56] then you see a season when seeds and
[1:07:58] never shook and you see it's the seed
[1:08:00] age now it's the seed time now well if
[1:08:03] there was a mature son in this age it
[1:08:05] was an announcement brother Larry
[1:08:07] there's a whole field
[1:08:10] full listen there's a whole field full
[1:08:13] and you might not think much of yourself
[1:08:16] but the god of heaven sent a message to
[1:08:18] declare she has reached perfection in
[1:08:22] the word of God nothing else to add
[1:08:26] amen
[1:08:27] amen four said preacher what are you
[1:08:30] talking about for an appointed
[1:08:35] time it's necessary help me preach for
[1:08:39] an appointed time Galatians 4 as a child
[1:08:45] until an appointed time what happened in
[1:08:49] that time father take the boy out and
[1:08:50] he' stand in the public and say this is
[1:08:51] my son and he's good for it my words his
[1:08:56] word appointed time do you know the
[1:08:59] scripture declares appointed time do you
[1:09:02] do you see the prophet in the breach and
[1:09:04] until you that studi the message you'll
[1:09:06] catch this and I don't have time to
[1:09:07] preach here but in the breach brother
[1:09:09] bram's talking about the aling of Seven
[1:09:11] Seals and he said that they stayed a
[1:09:14] secret until an appointed time right
[1:09:19] amen just like Jeremiah's documents
[1:09:21] stayed in an earn vessel until an
[1:09:24] appointed time time and at the appointed
[1:09:27] time the Earth and vessel carried the
[1:09:29] message of the
[1:09:31] inheritance and the Church of the Living
[1:09:34] God has been looking for its inheritance
[1:09:36] and here the appointed time is when the
[1:09:38] seventh angel messenger an Earthly
[1:09:41] messenger comes to the Earth he's
[1:09:44] carrying the inheritance of the church
[1:09:47] somebody said well God don't heal no
[1:09:48] more but we've seen him do it God don't
[1:09:51] have visions anymore but we've seen him
[1:09:53] do it amen God don't raise the Dead
[1:09:55] anymore but we seen him do it we saw a
[1:09:58] man born like we were born use the word
[1:10:01] and create a squirrel and speak to the
[1:10:03] lame and they walked amen and he was so
[1:10:06] powerful that he controlled the greatest
[1:10:09] creature of him all his own
[1:10:12] flesh woo you talk about maturity
[1:10:15] friends amen maturity has come upon us
[1:10:18] and the Bible said don't seal the Saints
[1:10:20] of this book for the time has come can I
[1:10:23] say it openly to you the Thunders have
[1:10:26] thundered the seals have spoken God has
[1:10:30] sent a message maturity has come to the
[1:10:34] church and I receive it I receive the
[1:10:37] headship of almighty God upon the church
[1:10:40] I say this to you maturity has come now
[1:10:43] what's amazing in Revelation 10: 7 in
[1:10:45] the days appointed time in the days of
[1:10:48] the voice of the seventh
[1:10:50] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:10:54] mystery of
[1:10:55] God would
[1:10:58] be
[1:11:00] finished the Greek word
[1:11:04] Tello it means what has been promised
[1:11:07] has been
[1:11:08] executed it means it has been
[1:11:12] accomplished it means it has been
[1:11:15] performed it means time has expired for
[1:11:19] the prophecies they're now in effect the
[1:11:23] finishing of the church is app point to
[1:11:25] the time of the seventh angel messenger
[1:11:28] and when he begins to sound Perfection
[1:11:30] will come upon that church that hears it
[1:11:33] amen I amen I I I've got a lot laying
[1:11:35] here and I won't get to all of it but I
[1:11:37] want to take you to the scripture 1
[1:11:38] Corinthians 13 and: 10 amen but when
[1:11:41] that which
[1:11:42] is
[1:11:45] teos when that which is teos is come
[1:11:49] that which is in part shall be done away
[1:11:52] what need is it when Perfection comes
[1:11:55] watch what he's saying when I was a
[1:11:57] child there it is I spoke as a child
[1:12:00] understood as a child I thought as a
[1:12:02] child but when I became a
[1:12:06] man do you see what Paul Paul's saying
[1:12:09] it clearly to you when that which is
[1:12:10] perfect has come now we're correlating
[1:12:13] the Perfection of the church with the
[1:12:15] appointed time of Revelation 10: 7
[1:12:18] brother Brandon correlates that with the
[1:12:19] appointed time of adoption we are at the
[1:12:23] age of sunship
[1:12:26] listen this is the age we're living in
[1:12:28] it's the age not as a child now watch
[1:12:31] this this is this is not a rebuke if
[1:12:33] you're if you're an infant in the
[1:12:34] message that's not what this is it's
[1:12:36] telling you the potential of the age
[1:12:38] you're in now watch this because you no
[1:12:41] longer speak as a
[1:12:43] child an untaught one see if if let just
[1:12:47] say you was living in the days of Martin
[1:12:49] Luther and and and I was a preacher in
[1:12:51] the days of Martin Luther what would my
[1:12:53] sermon sound like right a
[1:12:57] child because that was all that I could
[1:12:59] operate
[1:13:00] under could there would be no more
[1:13:03] understanding to the church than what
[1:13:05] Martin Luther gave me so a five-fold
[1:13:07] Ministry could only grow the church up
[1:13:10] to the Statue of the age he was living
[1:13:13] in but then we find out the scripture
[1:13:16] tells us that God is progressing the
[1:13:18] church from childhood to maturity that's
[1:13:22] why we didn't stop with Martin Luther
[1:13:25] right amen just shall live by faith but
[1:13:28] the Bible also says that we're
[1:13:30] Sanctified by the word and it also says
[1:13:33] that you've got to receive the Holy
[1:13:35] Ghost what is it it's moving into the
[1:13:37] adulthood of
[1:13:39] Christianity oh Church of the Living God
[1:13:42] that's why we don't stop
[1:13:44] halfway that's why we don't stop in the
[1:13:46] middle when I was a child I understood
[1:13:48] as a child I thought as a child I became
[1:13:50] a man but now we see through a glass
[1:13:52] Darkly but then shall I know even as
[1:13:55] I've been known now what are we talking
[1:13:57] about we're talking about maturity
[1:13:58] coming to the church can I say this to
[1:14:00] you God is making a masterpiece again
[1:14:03] sir and when that Masterpiece comes into
[1:14:05] his Perfection this bride will fulfill
[1:14:08] everything in the New
[1:14:12] Testament now that's the way he makes
[1:14:15] his
[1:14:16] masterpieces because he can only be a
[1:14:19] perfect
[1:14:20] Masterpiece when it's a perfect word
[1:14:25] Perfection of what I'm speaking of was
[1:14:27] not obtainable in another
[1:14:30] age Perfection is not attainable under
[1:14:33] your Baptist preaching it's not
[1:14:36] obtainable under Pentecostal teaching it
[1:14:39] is only obtainable when that which is
[1:14:42] perfect has come listen I'll tell you
[1:14:44] what brother brandom says he said it's a
[1:14:46] perfect place you're going to it's a
[1:14:49] perfect Son of God you're being married
[1:14:51] to and how are you going to do it in any
[1:14:53] other way than the perfect perfect
[1:14:58] word now we're talking about
[1:15:02] perfection now some people would look at
[1:15:04] this bride and they don't see Perfection
[1:15:07] matter of fact they see
[1:15:09] imperfection they see Fanatics and crazy
[1:15:12] people and they see every kind of issue
[1:15:14] and they look at brother Ram's teachings
[1:15:16] and they see this problem and they see
[1:15:17] that problem but Perfection was being
[1:15:20] given according to God and that
[1:15:23] Perfection is calling on the church and
[1:15:25] somebody is going to begin to see this
[1:15:27] now watch this next verse I'm just going
[1:15:30] to be closing in here now watch that
[1:15:31] 13th and then move into the 14th verse
[1:15:34] and watch watch the scripture how it
[1:15:36] begins to translate and now about uh
[1:15:39] sorry not 13 uh Ephesians
[1:15:42] 413 and watch how the scripture begins
[1:15:44] to progress and bring the church from
[1:15:49] childhood to maturity and look at the
[1:15:52] result and we come into the unity of
[1:15:54] faith and knowledge of the Son of God
[1:15:56] unto a perfect
[1:15:58] man unto the measure of the stature of
[1:16:01] Christ now that's the book of Peter you
[1:16:02] all know that and we henceforth be no
[1:16:06] more children tossed to and fro carried
[1:16:08] with every wind of Doctrine by the slide
[1:16:10] of man the cunning craftiness whereby
[1:16:12] they lay and wait to deceive next verse
[1:16:15] but speaking the
[1:16:19] truth result of adult
[1:16:23] Christianity speaking truth in love let
[1:16:26] me ask y'all something what is the
[1:16:28] Capstone of your
[1:16:30] life Divine love now watch brother Bram
[1:16:33] coming into his own Ministry in 62
[1:16:35] switching to 63 and brother Bram said
[1:16:38] I'm coming up to a Jordan now and a man
[1:16:40] comes up and prophesies over brother
[1:16:42] brandham yeah amen and he says unto him
[1:16:45] that you have chosen the harder
[1:16:48] way and because of this momentous
[1:16:51] decision you have made you will receive
[1:16:53] a greater
[1:16:55] you got a greater greater reward in
[1:16:58] other words you've received this it is a
[1:17:00] victory in love divine what was his
[1:17:04] victory folks brother BR comes back and
[1:17:06] he says now I don't really know what
[1:17:08] that means I know the choice part but
[1:17:10] the victory part I don't know right now
[1:17:13] he said maybe we'll get to it in the
[1:17:15] tent and then he comes back just a
[1:17:18] little later in Paradox and said here's
[1:17:20] what it means it means that we have come
[1:17:23] up to the Jordan
[1:17:25] Pentecostal age we've come up to the
[1:17:27] Jordan and I've looked over there and
[1:17:29] saw he said now a highand would turn
[1:17:32] around at this bank and go backwards
[1:17:35] because you're about to receive
[1:17:36] rejection for what's coming so he said
[1:17:39] look it was love that made me go over
[1:17:43] there into those
[1:17:44] seals it was love that made him preach
[1:17:48] the truth to the people when he knew he
[1:17:51] would lose people by the thousands but
[1:17:54] but love forced him to do it adult
[1:17:57] Christians speak truth in love it is the
[1:18:01] victory of your life it is the grace of
[1:18:04] your life this message must be preached
[1:18:06] it must be preached into every nation it
[1:18:09] must be preached to everyone but love
[1:18:11] must take it there love must take it to
[1:18:13] your family Love's got to take it to
[1:18:15] your home Love's got to take it to your
[1:18:17] church Love's got to take it to your
[1:18:20] neighborhood listen it'll have to be the
[1:18:22] truth in love and if you speak the truth
[1:18:24] in love love Hornets will go back in
[1:18:26] their nest and Bulls will lay down under
[1:18:28] the tree if you speak truth and love
[1:18:31] cancers will fall off in the middle of
[1:18:33] the service if you speak the truth and
[1:18:35] love demons will be broken Powers will
[1:18:37] be shattered young people will be filled
[1:18:40] with the Holy Ghost when I was a child I
[1:18:42] spake like a child it was full of
[1:18:45] denominational nonsense but when we come
[1:18:48] to
[1:18:51] adulthood speaking the message of the
[1:18:53] hour with love knowing what it will do
[1:18:56] for this
[1:18:57] church let me say something to
[1:19:00] you this message is riding the trail
[1:19:06] again and if you're going to follow that
[1:19:09] Prophet it'll be a harder
[1:19:12] way but it will evolve into speaking
[1:19:17] truth in love can our musicians come it
[1:19:20] will evolve into speaking
[1:19:23] truth and love can I say it to you
[1:19:27] Christianity adult
[1:19:29] Christianity is perfection yes sir
[1:19:34] speak not like
[1:19:36] children like
[1:19:39] men do you see that speaking like
[1:19:43] men
[1:19:45] adult knowing who you are knowing what
[1:19:47] your dimensions of your command knowing
[1:19:50] the The Authority that you carry
[1:19:55] it wasn't until Moses perfected his
[1:19:59] Masterpiece that he struck it and
[1:20:02] commanded of it to
[1:20:04] speak Perfection commanded
[1:20:09] speaking he struck it brother B said
[1:20:12] there it is that's the mark of the
[1:20:14] Masterpiece because it so matched His
[1:20:18] Image now now watch this this leay out
[1:20:20] is seean
[1:20:22] age he was never put out
[1:20:25] until
[1:20:27] perfection in Isaiah 53 it says he was
[1:20:30] smitten of
[1:20:32] God in Revelations three it shows you
[1:20:36] the bride will be smitten out of
[1:20:41] Leota to
[1:20:43] speak to speak God's truth in love
