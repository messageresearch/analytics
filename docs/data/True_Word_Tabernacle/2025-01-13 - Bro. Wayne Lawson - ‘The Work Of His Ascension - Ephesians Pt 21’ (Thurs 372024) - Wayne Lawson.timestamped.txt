[6:52] be in the house of the Lord tonight and
[6:54] amen to feel his presence and his
[6:56] anointing isn't he good to us Amen in
[6:59] Ephesians chapter 4 tonight amen we're
[7:01] going to be reading the scriptures
[7:03] Ephesians chapter
[7:05] 4 for there is one body in the fourth
[7:08] verse there is one body and one Spirit
[7:12] even as you are called in one hope of
[7:15] your
[7:16] calling one Lord One Faith one
[7:21] baptism one God and Father of all who is
[7:24] above all and through all and in you
[7:27] all but unto everyone of us is given
[7:30] Grace according to the measure of the
[7:34] gift of
[7:35] Christ wherein he saith when he ascended
[7:38] up on high he led captivity captive and
[7:42] gave gifts unto
[7:44] men now he that ascended what is it but
[7:49] that he also descended first into the
[7:52] lower parts of the earth and he that
[7:55] descended is the same also that ascended
[7:58] up above far above
[8:00] all Heavens that he might feel all
[8:05] things that's a very important part of
[8:07] this scripture that he might feel all
[8:11] things amen let's just bow our hearts
[8:14] for a word of prayer almighty God we
[8:15] thank you tonight we thank you for the
[8:18] children of God that have come into this
[8:20] room Lord that have come within the
[8:21] gates tonight to worship you I pray
[8:24] father that you would bless them that
[8:26] you would strengthen them Lord father to
[8:29] the visitors that are among us I pray oh
[8:31] God that your mercy would be to them may
[8:33] a welcoming Spirit God move upon each of
[8:36] their hearts may clear speech and
[8:38] understanding strike hearts Lord and
[8:41] we're asking you tonight for just a
[8:43] special anointing to put the scriptures
[8:45] together Lord in a way Lord that
[8:48] understanding could bring strength and
[8:49] anointing Lord now we're committing this
[8:52] service into your hands and asking you
[8:54] for your grace in Jesus name we pray
[8:57] amen and amen and God bless you as you
[9:00] can have your seats tonight and again
[9:03] I'm going to speak here on this Ephesian
[9:05] series and I'm going to speak here on
[9:07] this a section of scriptures and I want
[9:09] to if I would call it something tonight
[9:11] for a context I want to talk to you
[9:13] about the work of his Ascension the work
[9:16] of his Ascension uh as I speak to you
[9:19] tonight about this I think that it's a
[9:21] powerful thing uh as we were speaking to
[9:23] you on Sunday about keeping the unity I
[9:27] kind of like that I like the Lord gave
[9:28] us Unity and we just want to keep it so
[9:31] I don't believe we have to establish it
[9:33] he established it by his spirit amen but
[9:35] we just want to keep that and that's why
[9:37] Paul says here that there is one body
[9:40] and there is one Spirit even as you are
[9:43] called in the hope of your calling now
[9:46] there is one Lord there is one faith and
[9:49] there is one baptism now that's pretty
[9:51] that's pretty powerful tonight because
[9:53] there's just one Lord amen isn't that
[9:56] amazing that that one Lord and and many
[9:59] people would saywell then who would that
[10:01] be because of course it's Peter in the
[10:03] book of Acts in the second chapter that
[10:05] announces and he said this same Jesus
[10:07] that you've crucified God hath made him
[10:10] both Lord and Christ amen then I believe
[10:14] that Jesus is the Lord Of Glory I
[10:17] believe that he is the Lord of lords
[10:20] amen and it's written upon his vesture
[10:21] and his great return on his wi horse it
[10:23] said he is the king of kings amen so I
[10:26] believe that our lord Jesus is that one
[10:29] Lord Lord amen God is just one and he's
[10:31] manifested through many offices but he
[10:34] is just one there is one lord and there
[10:37] is one Faith now here's the thing that
[10:39] we're living in a world today that most
[10:41] of the time you meet somebody at the
[10:42] grocery store you meet them somewhere
[10:44] and they'll say to you uh are you a
[10:46] Christian you say yeah next question is
[10:48] what faith are you well actually there's
[10:50] only one Faith amen I know people want
[10:53] to separate our faith into Baptist or
[10:55] Lutheran or some other Doctrine but
[10:57] there is just one faith amen and that
[11:00] Faith according to the book of Jude is
[11:02] the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ it's
[11:04] when Jude would say that we should
[11:06] contend for the faith he doesn't say a
[11:09] faith he said we should contend for a
[11:11] the faith and that faith is the faith of
[11:14] Jesus Christ amen so there isn't just a
[11:18] faith there is the faith you reading
[11:20] scripture in the book of Timothy it said
[11:22] they're ever learning coming to the
[11:23] knowledge uh uh never coming to the
[11:25] knowledge of Truth amen reprobates
[11:28] concerning the faith so it is a the
[11:31] faith but you can't have the faith
[11:33] without one Lord there just has to be
[11:35] one Lord and then you can have one Faith
[11:38] see if you got many different Masters if
[11:40] there's many different ideas amen then
[11:42] there's going to be a lot of different
[11:43] faiths amen but if you can just bring it
[11:46] down to the preeminence of the word now
[11:48] this is real powerful later on because
[11:50] if you can bring it to the preeminence
[11:52] of the word you'll just have one faith
[11:54] in other words if you can get uh uh
[11:56] everybody's mind under one word amen one
[11:59] Lord one one one place of lordship then
[12:02] there would just be one Faith amen and
[12:05] that Faith amen would be the faith of
[12:07] Jesus Christ you go back in the in into
[12:09] the scriptures and find out if it wasn't
[12:11] the moment that Eve brought in another
[12:13] Lord is when she lost her faith that's
[12:16] when Faith was broken was when she took
[12:18] reasoning on the word and she lost the
[12:21] lordship of God and when that lordship
[12:23] was lost then the whole earth was
[12:25] plunged because there become more than
[12:27] one Lord so if you want to restore One
[12:29] Faith you had to restore one Lord and
[12:32] that Lord is the Lord Jesus Christ is
[12:35] that right amen the one Lord one faith
[12:38] and there is just one baptism is that
[12:40] right the prophet said some people's
[12:42] going to try to tell you that that is a
[12:44] water baptism I got many Church of
[12:46] Christ friends and we've had long
[12:48] discussions over this amen but they
[12:50] believe that when you get baptized in
[12:52] the water that's your salvation but
[12:54] listen friends water does not save you
[12:56] not water only even Jesus said not water
[12:59] only but by the water the blood and the
[13:02] spirit that's why Paul says in 1
[13:04] Corinthians 12 that there is only one
[13:07] Spirit by one Spirit we are baptized
[13:09] into one body so brother man say Paul is
[13:12] not speaking of water baptism he's
[13:14] speaking of spiritual baptism so in
[13:16] other words if there's one Lord there's
[13:18] one faith and there's one baptism then
[13:20] it would be just one body and every
[13:23] person in the body would be in a member
[13:25] of that body by the baptism of the Holy
[13:28] Ghost amen I tell you wouldn't it be
[13:30] something tonight if the Holy Ghost
[13:32] could fall into every Church in America
[13:34] and every Church in life and it would
[13:36] baptize them into that one body and then
[13:39] they would be given the measure of Jesus
[13:41] Christ now you all know tonight that as
[13:44] Christians that we carry a portion of
[13:47] deity inside
[13:48] us but the prophet said notice as Jesus
[13:51] was the fullness of the godhead bodily
[13:54] he said the whole ocean was in Jesus but
[13:56] to you and I it was like a teaspoon
[13:59] devotion has been placed into every one
[14:01] of us now it's the same kind of water it
[14:03] has the same qualities it has the same
[14:06] makeup but it's not the same measure as
[14:08] it was in Jesus Christ but as Sons and
[14:11] Daughters of God we've been given a
[14:13] measure of the gift of Christ which is
[14:16] the Holy Ghost and us having that
[14:18] measure of Christ amen he has given us
[14:22] that this this evening and thank God for
[14:24] it because he's given it to us for a
[14:26] reason I believe according to the
[14:29] scriptures that God has given us of his
[14:31] spirit amen to as we say in the
[14:34] scriptures the next verses it's amazing
[14:36] because the way that Paul builds this is
[14:38] he's taking us into the idea that one
[14:41] Spirit One Faith one baptism being in
[14:44] Christ with a measure of Christ and then
[14:46] in Ephesians 4:8 he begins by saying
[14:49] wherefore he saith when he ascended upon
[14:52] high he led captivity captive and gave
[14:56] gifts unto
[14:57] men wherefore he saith amen when he
[15:01] ascended upon high he led captivity
[15:04] captive and gave gifts unto men now
[15:06] here's the beauty of this is when he
[15:08] saith now this is actually amen Paul
[15:11] quoting Old Testament scripture Psalm 68
[15:14] and verse 18 amen the scripture is
[15:16] telling us that when Peter excuse me
[15:19] when David wrote this in the Book of
[15:20] Psalms he said thou has ascended upon
[15:23] high and thou has led captivity captive
[15:27] that thou receive is for men yay for the
[15:30] rebellious also the Lord God might dwell
[15:34] among them isn't that powerful talk
[15:36] about you Gentiles again amen even got
[15:38] gifts for you rebellious also amen for
[15:41] you that wasn't the Commonwealth of
[15:43] Israel he so conquered that he gave a
[15:46] gift of the measure of Christ even to
[15:48] the rebellious he brought you into the
[15:50] manifold wisdoms of God by his spirit
[15:53] and made you a part of his body the
[15:55] scripture said he ascended on high and
[15:58] led captivity captive now this is the
[16:00] Book of Psalms definitely David is
[16:02] speaking of God that God did this but
[16:05] now Paul is definitely saying Jesus did
[16:08] this so he's taking the Old Testament
[16:11] prophecy that God had led captivity
[16:14] captive and show that Jesus did this
[16:17] himself to fulfill the scripture
[16:19] according to what was written of him for
[16:22] it saith of him amen it's in psalm 16
[16:25] that Jesus himself again amen speaking
[16:28] of his death burial and Resurrection
[16:31] when Jesus was to be buried in Psalm
[16:32] 16:9 David is speaking of someone he
[16:35] said therefore my heart is glad and my
[16:38] glory rejoiceth for my flesh shall also
[16:41] Rest In Hope for thou will not suffer th
[16:45] th will not leave my soul in Hell
[16:47] neither will th suffer thine Holy One to
[16:50] see corruption now David is talking
[16:52] about the Holy One and Jesus applies
[16:55] this scripture to himself in Matthew
[16:58] chap 12 when Jesus is speaking to the
[17:00] Pharisees and they begin to ask him for
[17:02] a sign he said he he answered and said
[17:05] unto them in the evil an adulterous
[17:07] generation Matthew 12:39 after a sign
[17:11] and there shall be no sign given to it
[17:13] but the sign of the Prophet Jonas for as
[17:16] Jonas with three days and three nights
[17:19] in the Well's belly so shall the son of
[17:21] man be three days and three nights in
[17:24] the heart of the earth so Jesus is
[17:26] taking psalm 16 and making it mean that
[17:30] he will go into the Earth for a period
[17:33] of days amen that will be for sure less
[17:36] than 72 hours because corruption sets in
[17:39] a body after 72 hours and he's saying
[17:43] corruption will never enter the Holy One
[17:45] Of God now why is he calling him a holy
[17:47] one because he's not just another Homo
[17:49] Sapien he's not just another human being
[17:52] he's not just another man born of any
[17:55] woman but this is the Holy One Of God
[17:58] this is in Isaiah 9 it was it was the
[18:01] son shall be born and the government
[18:03] shall be given to him and of his
[18:05] Dominion there will be no end this is
[18:07] who it's speaking of in Isaiah 7 when he
[18:09] said a virgin shall conceive and it says
[18:12] and God would be with us isn't it
[18:15] amazing that Psalms is speaking of the
[18:18] Holy One of Israel and Jesus is telling
[18:21] them that I'm going to go into the Earth
[18:23] but I'm not going to stay I'm going to
[18:25] come back again as a sign under this
[18:28] generation
[18:29] it will be a sign of the Resurrection I
[18:32] think it's amazing to see that our Lord
[18:34] using scripture to make sure you
[18:37] understood that he was the one that was
[18:39] being spoken of now the reason we we
[18:42] must identify these things is because
[18:45] Jesus laid in the Tomb for three days
[18:47] now here's the thing he laid from Friday
[18:49] to Sunday in the Tomb and the prophet of
[18:52] God said see he was barred from the
[18:54] resurrection until everything was
[18:56] fulfilled he was barred from raising
[18:59] from the dead until all was fulfilled
[19:02] see it was spoke of him he wouldn't stay
[19:04] too long but it was also spoke that he
[19:06] was going to go amen he led captivity
[19:09] captive in other words you're going he's
[19:10] going to go but he ain't going to stay
[19:12] long because there is a work that he
[19:14] must do in the regions of the lost that
[19:17] was a work that he must do before he
[19:19] ascended he had to descend to the lower
[19:22] parts of the earth listen what he says I
[19:25] will not leave his soul in hell he was
[19:27] going but not staying isn't that amazing
[19:31] he was going but he wasn't staying now
[19:32] there was a reason that he was going is
[19:35] because there had to be a work done for
[19:37] the Church of the Living God see what we
[19:40] find out is according to Hebrews chapter
[19:42] 2 this Bible speaks to us and it tells
[19:45] us that Jesus was descending from God
[19:48] into man and into the lower parts of the
[19:51] earth it says before he ascended he
[19:54] descended yes sir amen before he
[19:57] ascended he desc ended amen now it's
[20:01] pretty amazing if you if you look at it
[20:03] in this manner amen because if you're a
[20:06] Bible reader you know over in the Book
[20:08] of Genesis it's when Jacob amen is
[20:10] traveling he lays down and he puts his
[20:13] head on a stone and he has a dream that
[20:15] night and he dreams about a ladder that
[20:17] reaches into the heaven and upon the
[20:19] earth and the Bible said he saw angels
[20:22] ascending and descending upon that
[20:25] ladder but now what we're going to be
[20:27] viewing tonight is this not going to be
[20:30] Angels up and down that ladder we're
[20:32] going to see God and man on that ladder
[20:35] see because God who was in heaven had
[20:38] lost the attribute of his sons and they
[20:41] had fell out of the Heavenly atmosphere
[20:44] and Jesus said I got to go after them
[20:46] God has said I got to go into the Earth
[20:48] to get them and watch what he does he
[20:50] brings Jacob's Ladder and comes right
[20:53] down into the Earth brother BR said
[20:55] notice in the first place it was Angels
[20:57] but in the second place here we're going
[20:59] to see God and man using that ladder to
[21:02] come out of the heavens you know Jesus
[21:04] amen actually come from the heavens into
[21:06] the Earth you you it's amazing when the
[21:09] Bible speaks it says unto the Angels he
[21:12] have not put in subjection the world to
[21:14] come he said in a certain place he
[21:16] testified Hebrews 2 and6 saying what is
[21:19] a man that thou art mindful of him and
[21:21] the son of man that thou would visitest
[21:23] him now thou mest a lower than the
[21:27] angels and th crownest him with a glory
[21:29] and honor and did set him him over the
[21:32] work of thine hands now watch this Jesus
[21:34] is going to be as descending before he
[21:39] ascends he's descending and the
[21:41] scripture says he's going to come lower
[21:44] than the Angels Hebrews 2:7 he will be
[21:47] lower than the angels and thou put amen
[21:49] all things in subjection under his feet
[21:52] and under him have left nothing that's
[21:54] not put under him but now we see not all
[21:57] things yet put under him but we see
[21:59] Jesus who was made lower than the angels
[22:03] for the suffering of death now there's
[22:05] the answer he was made lower than the
[22:07] angels for the suffering of death he had
[22:10] to die in the human body he was crowned
[22:13] with Glory and Honor that he might by
[22:15] grace of God should taste the death of
[22:17] every man now I think it's amazing that
[22:20] he became at the next verse he became
[22:22] the captain of our Salvation amen isn't
[22:25] it something that we have a captain of
[22:27] Salvation brother man said he said I was
[22:29] down there he said I seen the the
[22:31] Indianapolis or excuse me the uh the
[22:34] city he was from Jeffersonville there he
[22:36] said I seen him come to a house fire one
[22:38] day and he said I seen the captain of
[22:40] the fire truck he said he jumped out of
[22:42] the truck and the fire chief you know he
[22:44] said he run over and looked at the fire
[22:45] and he told everybody said hey squirt a
[22:47] little water here and squirt a little
[22:49] water here and squirt a little water
[22:50] here he said they wasn't getting no
[22:52] fires put out at all he said and all a
[22:54] sudden here come Louisville he said he
[22:56] said all of a sudden they run up there
[22:58] in the Chief jumped out and threw a
[22:59] ladder up and run up the ladder and
[23:00] broke something grabbed and started
[23:02] putting the fires out he said see there
[23:04] was a captain on the scene amen and the
[23:06] captain of our Salvation was the leader
[23:09] of our Salvation he didn't just show up
[23:11] and said do a little here a little there
[23:13] amen but he was the captain of the
[23:14] movement of Salvation in that he came
[23:17] from the heavens of Heavens down Jacob's
[23:20] Ladder and descended into the Earth and
[23:23] bypass the angels to come to Mortal men
[23:25] that he might walk in the darkness of
[23:28] the ages that he might stay in the human
[23:31] body of Deery and de humiliation amen it
[23:34] was the degradation of almighty God to
[23:36] come into a human body who could who
[23:38] could be tempted according to scripture
[23:40] if you read on he came past the angels
[23:43] and he took on him the form amen of the
[23:46] Seed of Abraham amen now that's
[23:48] something isn't it and he became our
[23:50] brother that he might be tempted in
[23:52] every manner like we are now you might
[23:54] think that now I remember years ago I I
[23:57] come up I come up with a a great uncle
[23:59] he came out of the Pentecostal movement
[24:01] into the message but there was one
[24:02] little area he always had a little
[24:03] trouble on he he he always kind of felt
[24:06] like Jesus wouldn't have roted in the
[24:07] grave you know he always felt like Jesus
[24:10] couldn't have had a had a had a body
[24:12] that he could have had a wife and a
[24:13] family amen because of the one that's
[24:15] teaching but here the prophet teaches us
[24:18] amen that Jesus's body was altogether a
[24:21] human body he said he was 100% man and
[24:25] 100% God many people try to say well was
[24:28] he God or was he man the beauty is he
[24:30] was both it was the Paradox of a union
[24:33] between God and man and God himself in
[24:37] his fullness came into a human body and
[24:40] come down Jacob's Ladder as a germ in a
[24:44] woman's womb and he might come after
[24:46] falling man that had fail through a
[24:49] woman he would redeem through a woman
[24:51] because he was almighty God and in him
[24:53] was the attribute of Redeemer yes he
[24:56] bypassed angels and he came in into a
[24:58] human body that he might suffer after
[25:01] death now in John chapter 8 and verse 42
[25:04] I hope you can stay with me tonight
[25:06] please please forgive me for so much uh
[25:08] building here and John 8:42 he said Heen
[25:11] if he said Jesus said to them if God was
[25:14] your father you would love me for I
[25:17] proceeded forth and came from God
[25:21] neither came I of myself but he sent me
[25:23] he proceeded forth from
[25:26] God and John 16 and 27 for the father
[25:30] himself loveth you because he loved me
[25:33] and hath believed that I came from God
[25:37] isn't that powerful I came forth from
[25:39] the father and am come into the world
[25:43] and I leave the world and go to the
[25:45] Father John 16:29 his disciples said
[25:47] unto him Lo now thou speakest plainly
[25:50] speak not in a proverb now we are sure
[25:53] that knowest all things and needest not
[25:55] that any man should ask thee We Believe
[25:58] thou camest forth from God isn't that
[26:01] powerful amen the disciples believed it
[26:05] Jesus spoke it Paul believed it I
[26:08] believe it tonight Paul wrote it in a
[26:10] better in 1 Corinthians
[26:12] 15-45 and so it is written the first man
[26:15] Adam was made a living Soul the last
[26:18] Adam was made a quickening spirit how be
[26:21] it that was not first which is spiritual
[26:23] but that which is natural and after that
[26:25] which is spiritual the first men is of
[26:28] the earth Earthly the second man is the
[26:31] Lord From Heaven I tell you he's the
[26:34] Lord Of Glory tonight he issued out of
[26:37] the bosom of the father and he turned
[26:39] around and said I come from God and I'm
[26:41] going back to God I tell you he came for
[26:44] a purpose and it was to redeem Fallen
[26:47] man he had a work to come from God Amen
[26:50] when I look at this tonight I think it's
[26:51] powerful Amen in John 3 and: 12 he said
[26:55] I told you Earthly things and you
[26:56] believe them not how how shall you
[26:59] believe if I tell you Heavenly things
[27:02] and no man hath ascended up to heaven
[27:05] but he that came down from heaven even
[27:08] the son of man which is in heaven well
[27:11] Glory you're talking about an
[27:13] omnipresent God he was standing there
[27:15] talking to Nicodemus sitting on the
[27:17] housetop and he was in heaven at the
[27:19] same time I'm talking about a God Amen
[27:23] that could be standing in a human body
[27:25] and still be in the heavens at the same
[27:27] time I'm talking about God tonight
[27:30] friends you can't box him up in our
[27:32] mentalities or our theologies he is
[27:34] almighty God and he visited the Earth
[27:37] for the Bible said God was in Christ
[27:40] reconciling the world to himself I I
[27:43] want you to know tonight Ain nobody can
[27:45] help you but Jesus there ain't a
[27:47] denomination there ain't a church there
[27:49] ain't a human being amen Jesus the son
[27:52] of God proceeded out of God and came
[27:54] into this Earth amen that he might be
[27:57] the merci ful high priest unto every man
[28:00] that reaches out to him I'll tell you he
[28:02] descended into this Earth but he brought
[28:04] heaven with him wo Glory you might think
[28:08] I'm crazy but I'm so glad to know
[28:10] tonight that Jesus didn't have to leave
[28:13] heaven in heaven but he was so much God
[28:15] that he come out of the heavens and
[28:17] brought heaven with
[28:19] him my goodness you know he did it you
[28:23] know he brought heaven with him the very
[28:25] night he was born Angels appeared on the
[28:27] earth and said good will and peace unto
[28:29] man amen Heaven and Earth was coming
[28:31] together Jehovah was being born in a
[28:34] manger the Creator the Bible said he
[28:37] created the world and they didn't even
[28:39] know he was in the world that's right
[28:43] see it was God yes sir that was coming
[28:46] into that look at what he did he
[28:48] descended into the earth now look what
[28:51] happened as he came into the
[28:54] Earth the
[28:56] atmosphere of Heaven came with him see
[28:59] he was he was coming into the
[29:03] Earth to bring Heaven into the
[29:07] Earth do you see he was only the only
[29:10] one of the gods that didn't have
[29:12] sin all of you Sons were created Gods
[29:17] amen right but he was the only one
[29:20] without
[29:21] sin so he was called the first of the
[29:24] head of this new race of a Goden being
[29:27] or God Church that's right in the
[29:29] Messianic Kingdom so when he came into
[29:31] the Earth he brought heaven with him
[29:33] isn't it powerful when he got on the sea
[29:36] that night and he's going to go over
[29:38] there amen and he's going to deliver a
[29:40] man who's over there in the tombs now
[29:42] that man was crying over in them tombs
[29:45] and you know he was crying desperately
[29:46] for help because there wasn't nobody in
[29:48] that area could help him there wasn't
[29:50] nothing that could that could that could
[29:52] help him at all but when Jesus came now
[29:55] listen he was on the boat the whole time
[29:57] and even the demons got upset and said
[29:58] we'll prevent his coming but they
[30:00] couldn't prevent the coming of the Lord
[30:02] and when he got to the other side and he
[30:04] stepped out into public view amen that
[30:06] devil could not resist that man from
[30:09] coming to the Lord Of Glory the prophet
[30:11] of God said that little that little that
[30:13] little little humble man Jesus the Bible
[30:15] said he was a small man told us he
[30:17] wasn't nothing to look at brother man
[30:19] said he wasn't nothing to look at said
[30:20] just probably just a skinny fella small
[30:22] guy he said wasn't nothing to look at at
[30:24] all he said but whenever that fell in
[30:27] those tombs thought he was big and you
[30:28] know he was able to conquer Jesus he
[30:30] said he come running out after him and
[30:33] he was going to destroy him till he
[30:35] looked into the eyes of the of the
[30:36] Messiah and brother Ram said those
[30:38] famous words I remember years ago I was
[30:40] preaching a meeting it hit me like it
[30:42] never had I ain't forgot it yet but it
[30:44] was a beautiful statement brother bam
[30:46] looked he says that the the that the G
[30:48] Maniac of gardea looked into the eyes of
[30:50] Jesus and he said what are you doing in
[30:53] there he realized the one that had threw
[30:57] him out of the h Heavens come on now
[30:59] Satan didn't fall he was cast out of the
[31:02] heavens Michael threw him out is that
[31:05] right and now he was on the earth and he
[31:08] had taken over this man and he seen in
[31:10] the eyes of this little human being the
[31:13] same one that had challenged him in the
[31:15] heavens had chased him into the Earth
[31:18] and Satan thought I got this one where I
[31:20] want him I got a captive the way I want
[31:22] him but Jesus went to where the captive
[31:25] was but when he got there heaven was
[31:28] with him he took heaven to the graveyard
[31:30] he took heaven to Garda and he let the
[31:33] maniac see what it would have been like
[31:35] in
[31:37] heaven glory to God when Jesus is here
[31:41] Heaven is on the
[31:43] earth hey Earth is just a place Heaven
[31:46] is an
[31:47] atmosphere and when Jesus stood there
[31:49] and looked at them and the demons left
[31:52] that man didn't he sir sir y'all
[31:54] remember the story amen it's pretty
[31:57] power cuz that fell went back and
[31:59] testified and I've always thought it was
[32:01] amazing the people that heard the
[32:02] testimony said won't you go with him we
[32:05] don't even want you in this
[32:06] country make Jesus leave our our our
[32:10] Coast make him leave the coast brother
[32:13] said why they want him to leave he said
[32:15] because he cost him too much when he
[32:17] came
[32:19] by there was too many hogs died in that
[32:23] Revival come on there's too many too
[32:25] many hogs and they were hog Farmers what
[32:27] was Hogs doing there in Israel anyhow
[32:30] amen they ain't supposed to have that
[32:31] amen but you see what happened it cost
[32:34] them too much and sometimes people
[32:36] really don't want Jesus to come by what
[32:39] they really want is a church doctrine or
[32:41] some little Creed every kind of devil
[32:43] can hide under theology but you let the
[32:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost get a hold of
[32:48] a Son of God and he begin to preach the
[32:50] message of the hour it'll uncover every
[32:53] devil it'll stomp down every Hallelujah
[32:57] it'll liberate the
[32:59] [Applause]
[33:01] church am yes sir amen it it was costly
[33:05] amen but the man had life after that and
[33:07] his family had a daddy and do you see
[33:10] what it was it was the atmosphere of
[33:11] Jesus it was the same thing when he
[33:13] stood there with a Roman Centurion you
[33:15] remember the Roman Centurion a gentile
[33:18] like you understood the authority of
[33:20] atmosphere and word and and and he said
[33:23] I got a sick baby at the house and Jesus
[33:25] said I'll come and heal him it was a
[33:27] beautiful thing he said he said look you
[33:30] don't need to come to my house I'm not
[33:31] worthy but if you'll just speak the word
[33:35] wo there it was there's that Gentile
[33:39] Faith he knew he didn't have to lay
[33:41] hands on me he knew that the word had an
[33:45] atmosphere that when it was spoken there
[33:47] was an authority in that word that Roman
[33:51] knew that and when Jesus spoke let me
[33:53] let me just say it clearly that Gentile
[33:55] knew that the word spoke by Jesus was as
[33:58] powerful as his physical
[34:02] presence glory to God that word into
[34:06] that atmosphere was powerful amen and
[34:08] that child was healed in the 11th hour
[34:12] now what was going on was Jesus was
[34:15] exercising and showing Heavenly
[34:17] Authority on Earth in a human being now
[34:20] this is beautiful because if you could
[34:22] see that it was from that atmosphere he
[34:25] ruled and it's where death Spirits were
[34:28] healed it was where blind eyes were
[34:30] opened in the atmosphere is how that the
[34:33] lane got up and walked it was the
[34:36] atmosphere that he brought that brought
[34:39] healing and it could deliver the harlots
[34:41] and it could deliver the the
[34:43] self-righteous and it could let the
[34:45] Pharisee laws amen be lifted off of
[34:48] people that they could have Liberty do
[34:50] you see what it was it was the
[34:51] atmospheres that he was under and that's
[34:54] what had been blocked off from mankind
[34:57] yeah
[34:59] now I'll say this to you today most
[35:01] people maybe don't understand I know you
[35:02] do here at the church but all over this
[35:05] Earth brother B since the day of the
[35:06] Garden Eden that sin was committed
[35:09] Heavens was shut off from
[35:11] mankind Heavens atmospheres amen was
[35:14] shut off from mankind Satan is the
[35:17] prince of the power of the air so
[35:18] brother B is telling us that man and
[35:21] Satan switch
[35:23] places that Satan robbed from man the
[35:27] author prority over the
[35:29] atmosphere and he took it
[35:32] himself and became the prince of the
[35:35] power of air why are thou fallen from
[35:38] Heaven oh Lucifer see no man could see
[35:40] into Glory no man could understand
[35:43] because the power is just above it
[35:45] Heaven means atmosphere above and all
[35:48] these Powers have been shut off from
[35:50] mankind because of
[35:53] sin do you see it was the atmosphere
[35:56] that was cut off do you know that's what
[35:57] really matters in your life is the
[36:00] atmosphere you know that what matters in
[36:02] a church is the
[36:04] atmosphere listen Adam was standing at
[36:08] the Garden of Eden but had lost the
[36:10] atmosphere do you see that he wasn't a
[36:13] different man but sin had took the
[36:15] atmosphere you can come to a church all
[36:18] day long but if there's no atmosphere
[36:20] it's just a church amen you can have a
[36:23] home but if there's no atmosphere it's
[36:25] just a house amen but when you get the
[36:28] atmosphere of the holy ghost in a church
[36:31] in a home in A Life That's where things
[36:34] matter is the kind of atmosphere and the
[36:37] atmosphere was cut off brother bam said
[36:39] atmosphere is what matters now you can
[36:41] see this it's atmosphere that matters
[36:44] now I'll just show it to you very
[36:45] quickly it was atmosphere when brother
[36:47] Ram was standing there and those Hornets
[36:50] come raging out of that bees nest
[36:52] Prophet was just mowing his yard folks
[36:55] he was out in the backyard brother Chaz
[36:57] didn't he have a shirt on look like a
[36:58] preacher I'm sure amen he's out there
[37:01] sweating and wiping his brow mowing his
[37:03] own yard amen probably just out there
[37:05] enjoying the the moment and he hits a
[37:07] branch and bunch of hornets come out of
[37:10] it brother BR said here they come now
[37:12] you know why they did that that was a
[37:14] fallen atmosphere had that happened up
[37:17] there in Eden there wouldn't have been
[37:19] no
[37:19] trouble but since the atmosphere not
[37:22] even man had fallen the whole earth has
[37:24] fallen so those Hornets took out after
[37:27] God God's son and look what he did
[37:29] Brother Ram said in a moment it come
[37:31] right out you divine love brother R's
[37:32] been preaching on it but look what
[37:34] happens right out of that atmosphere
[37:35] come those words he apologized them
[37:37] crazy
[37:38] bees now I tell you what and you talking
[37:40] about some humility now I you know I
[37:43] know you got to be careful here but you
[37:45] know what it mean amen sometimes you're
[37:48] looking for somebody to apologize to you
[37:49] to get thing over but it might be that
[37:52] God has so arranged
[37:55] it that he's not going to allow that to
[37:57] make you humble yourself to be able to
[38:00] take a wrong to make somebody right wow
[38:03] preacher I could never do that isn't
[38:04] that amazing Jesus was the only right
[38:06] one that ever lived and become wrong so
[38:08] all of you could be
[38:11] right he was right folks and he took the
[38:14] argument and became wrong that you might
[38:17] have Liberty brother Brandon wouldn't
[38:19] have never worked out a deal with MBS
[38:21] hey look if you'll apologize to me then
[38:23] I'll apologize to you and we'll go back
[38:24] to no sir he just looked at that beast
[38:27] and said I'm sorry I've trespassed you
[38:29] go back and I won't harm you and those
[38:31] things turned around and went flew can
[38:33] you well wouldn't that have been
[38:34] something to watch seen them Beast
[38:35] flying right back in that
[38:37] Nest is't that amazing it was atmosphere
[38:40] doesn't that Brother Richard in the
[38:42] backyard in the middle of the summer in
[38:45] Indiana with a man with his shirt off
[38:47] and sweat running down didn't have a
[38:49] nice suit didn't have a nice cushion
[38:50] chair he didn't have atmosphere of a
[38:52] bunch of music and organ beautiful
[38:54] singing amen but he lived somewhere with
[38:57] God God that the atmosphere of the Holy
[38:59] Ghost was right there all the time
[39:03] Hallelujah my feel like preaching
[39:05] tonight to know that God walks with a
[39:08] man think about that bull brother man
[39:11] jumped there hey man we've been brother
[39:13] R's been on it for a while that bull he
[39:15] jumped over that bull and look what he
[39:16] done pulled for that gun first nature
[39:18] remember pulled for that gun he said
[39:20] then something kicked
[39:22] in that y'all know that bull would have
[39:25] never attacked him in Eden
[39:29] but because of the Fallen nature it was
[39:33] living in an atmosphere it was ready to
[39:35] destroy God's son but the prophet stood
[39:38] back you could preach while I remember
[39:40] can I just preach to you minute here I
[39:42] remember I was preaching one time
[39:43] Brother Andy I was over in India and I
[39:45] was preaching and there I had a brother
[39:47] travel with me because I need an
[39:48] interpreter and so we traveled about
[39:49] four or five churches and he heard me
[39:51] preach on Divine love and I had a little
[39:53] story I told on that bull and I got to
[39:56] talking about how sometimes s you run
[39:58] into people and like a better word to
[40:00] say it some people's
[40:03] bullheaded and I said you know when
[40:05] somebody's a little bullheaded and
[40:07] they're not going to make things
[40:09] right sometimes you have to be the
[40:11] brother brandom in the picture yes sir
[40:13] now don't call him a bull or it's going
[40:14] to get
[40:16] bad but I was telling that story as we
[40:19] was traveling I was preaching on love
[40:21] and I and and I was preaching at his
[40:24] church it was a couple Services later
[40:26] and I was preaching at his church we
[40:27] preaching right along and I got up on
[40:29] this bull story and I just touched it
[40:31] and went on and I kept on preaching in
[40:33] many kind of looked at me funny he said
[40:35] the story and I said what's that he said
[40:37] the bull the story you got to tell it so
[40:41] brother brother Carri we Circle back and
[40:43] picked up the Bull story there a pastor
[40:45] for
[40:46] you there's a pastor for you amen it's
[40:49] see but it's the
[40:51] atmosphere that's what matters is the
[40:54] atmosphere brother Brandon was saying to
[40:56] you see that's what happened the
[40:57] atmosphere hung over the Earth of
[40:59] darkness and Gloom and death and weary
[41:01] and prayers couldn't come up because the
[41:03] atonement wasn't
[41:05] made woo because the atonement wasn't
[41:09] made the atmosphere was blocked off from
[41:12] man that's what it was brother bandam
[41:14] attributes everything to Atmosphere you
[41:16] know what he said he said the attitude
[41:18] brings the results that's the reason
[41:20] Pentecost got to go to the upper room
[41:22] cuz they got in one place in one Accord
[41:24] it's the atmosphere what brings the
[41:28] results let every man or woman in this
[41:31] building boy and girl get everything out
[41:33] of their mind but the Lord Jesus and
[41:35] believe he's standing present night and
[41:37] you'll see something happen that'll
[41:39] cause headlines in the
[41:41] newspapers I believe that look at what
[41:43] he's saying it's the atmosphere that
[41:45] brings the miraculous and the Wonders
[41:48] and the powers of God Among the people
[41:50] it's the atmosphere when people get to a
[41:53] place they're reasoning wondering
[41:54] stewing and thinking and tore up and
[41:56] they you don't know where they're stand
[41:58] half of them is not scripturally taught
[42:00] how can you expect the atmosphere to be
[42:02] right you can't do it it won't be right
[42:04] it's got to be in one cord one place
[42:07] settled down with one motive one thing
[42:09] you're going to see something happen
[42:11] then hallelujah you're going to see
[42:13] something happen because it turns into
[42:16] an atmosphere of faith it turns into an
[42:18] atmosphere of Bel and I got a lot of
[42:20] quotes I won't read them to you but I'll
[42:21] say this amen I believe that we can come
[42:24] into an atmosphere and if you ever ever
[42:27] been in that atmosphere one time you'll
[42:29] never be satisfied anywhere
[42:32] else you'll never be satisfied anywhere
[42:35] else if you ever been there one time you
[42:38] want to be there every time you want
[42:40] your heart to be sanctioned by the power
[42:42] of God I'll tell you this amen the holy
[42:46] spirit amen amen you see what it is it's
[42:49] the atmosphere now brother randam and
[42:50] maybe I'll deal with this later but the
[42:52] atmosphere brother bam deals with is
[42:54] Dimensions or the spirit amen and you
[42:57] know what atmosphere can get to the
[43:00] place where it becomes
[43:04] creative and atmosphere can get so
[43:07] powerful that it can become
[43:11] creative now brother B was out in the
[43:13] woods and created some squirrels that's
[43:15] right there you go atmospheres can
[43:17] become creative amen things that you
[43:20] don't have that you need right can come
[43:24] from the atmosphere of creation am you
[43:27] get under the all impulse of the spirit
[43:29] of God and let him go to speaking I'm
[43:32] I'm looking here brother B said a man or
[43:34] woman that ever walked in the shakan of
[43:35] Glory the whole world shut off behind
[43:37] them and no matter what the devil says
[43:39] you don't pay no attention they're
[43:41] living in a different atmosphere they're
[43:44] living in there where they put Aaron's
[43:47] Rod now that now I'm not just off on a
[43:52] limb when Moses built God a place in the
[43:56] desert he built the tent right yeah and
[43:58] brother Bram said it was three different
[44:00] atmospheres to eat the
[44:02] Mana one was on the
[44:05] outside one was in the inner court and
[44:08] one was in the holies of holies but that
[44:11] holies of holies in that atmosphere
[44:13] remember it the food never went bad in
[44:15] that
[44:16] atmosphere it was in Aaron's Rod it's
[44:19] where it budded it's where the word was
[44:23] it's where the Shak of Glory was but
[44:25] there was only one man allowed in that
[44:28] atmosphere that he might be able to
[44:30] sprinkle the blood on the day of
[44:32] atonement now there's a whole law set up
[44:35] on the day of atonement what he would do
[44:37] is the high priest would come into that
[44:39] atmosphere and he would sprinkle that
[44:41] now brother Brandon was saying that the
[44:43] New Birth has put that atmosphere in
[44:45] your life the same atmosphere that was
[44:49] in Aaron's rod and caused the bloom and
[44:51] that's where the Ark of the Lord was is
[44:54] the same atmosphere a Believer lives in
[44:56] today
[44:57] isn't that powerful it's called a
[44:59] Heavenly place in Christ Jesus amen amen
[45:04] now watch because this atmosphere was
[45:07] preserved by a priesthood yeah now that
[45:11] wouldn't remain there if there wasn't
[45:13] blood sprinkled every year so they would
[45:15] go in every year and they would sprinkle
[45:17] the blood and I think it was seven times
[45:19] they would do it uh uh you know there's
[45:21] a lot of different uh writings but if
[45:22] you look in Luke 16 the day of atom is
[45:24] very powerful but they would actually go
[45:26] in there Luke 16 and ex Leviticus 16 and
[45:31] they would it was started with an
[45:35] L I jumped over the others but but you
[45:39] see what it is when they would go in
[45:41] there the blood of the Lamb would
[45:44] preserve the
[45:46] atmosphere that Adam used to live
[45:50] in but because of the Fall there was no
[45:53] real blood to let man walk around on the
[45:57] earth in that atmosphere he could only
[46:00] experience it back there in that
[46:02] Veil but that blood was what kept that
[46:05] alive now here's the beauty of this
[46:07] because when Jesus comes to the Earth he
[46:10] has the same atmosphere in his life
[46:14] that's in that Tabernacle in the
[46:16] wilderness he is actually the Ark of the
[46:20] Lord he is the word of God on the earth
[46:24] amen my goodness in the beginning was
[46:27] the word the word was with God and the
[46:29] word became flesh and dwelt among us he
[46:32] was the fullness of the godhead bodily
[46:36] come on church all God dwelt in him he
[46:39] was the Throne of God he is the king of
[46:42] kings you see that heaven had came to
[46:46] the
[46:47] earth now I think it's powerful here
[46:50] because when Jesus dies do you see what
[46:53] he's happening is Jesus is descending
[46:56] now before he can Ascend he has to
[46:59] descend so this this song sang it living
[47:03] he loved me and and dying he saved me
[47:08] and buried he carried my sins far away
[47:12] it's a beautiful song sir Liv and he
[47:15] loved me in other words God's love
[47:16] brought him to the
[47:17] Earth but he had to Die to Save Me So
[47:21] the blood of the Lord Jesus on the cross
[47:25] brought the Salvation to man kind so
[47:27] we'd know that right but when they
[47:29] buried him he also fulfilled the law of
[47:32] the Two Goats of The Book of Leviticus
[47:35] y'all all heard of the escape goat you
[47:36] know when somebody does something and
[47:39] then they then they blame it on you
[47:42] you're called an
[47:44] escapegoat well brother Bram said of
[47:46] course a lot of the theologians believed
[47:47] that was the devil he said no it wasn't
[47:50] he said no because see if the devil was
[47:52] your escapegoat there was a law that
[47:55] when when the high priest would bring
[47:56] two goats and he would take one and he
[47:59] would he would Slaughter him and then
[48:01] take the blood of the of the first goat
[48:03] put on the second goat and confess all
[48:05] of the sins of the camp upon the goat
[48:08] and then he would run it off into the
[48:10] Wilderness but if that goat came
[48:13] back it brought its sins back with it
[48:16] brother Ram said there you go it's proof
[48:18] it wasn't the devil he said could the
[48:19] devil bring it
[48:22] back the devil wouldn't take it and keep
[48:24] it the devil would bring it back yeah
[48:27] but what Jesus did was he took it on
[48:30] himself right and he carried it into
[48:33] hell to the the Bible said he went to
[48:36] the lower parts of the Earth the Lord
[48:39] Jes now he had a work to do and the
[48:42] Bible said in Peter that he preached to
[48:44] souls that are in prison in other words
[48:46] he took our sins into hell now the Bible
[48:49] tells us that he descended into hell now
[48:52] he ain't going to stay long but he got
[48:53] to go there because there's two
[48:55] compartments of Hell according to Luke
[48:57] 16 there's a golf that's between the two
[48:59] there's one compartment that's called
[49:01] for torment with the souls in prison and
[49:04] there's another apartment called
[49:05] Paradise amen where the sons of God that
[49:08] have lived under the blood of the Lamb
[49:10] of the sacrificial lamb have been
[49:12] waiting Amen on the Lamb of God for two
[49:16] th 4,000 years had been waiting and
[49:18] Jesus is descending to take the sin of
[49:21] the world and dump it off into hell
[49:24] brother B said where it would stay there
[49:26] until the day of
[49:27] judgment now you think about this but
[49:30] while he was there amen he preached a
[49:32] beautiful sermon amen the Bible said he
[49:34] preached the souls in prison the first
[49:35] thing he done Amen brother Michael he
[49:38] had to make sure the devil knew that the
[49:40] sacrifice had been paid he preached in
[49:43] hell the power of his own death at
[49:46] Calvary the prophet said he looked up at
[49:49] the cross and he told the devil Satan I
[49:52] want you to look at that cross and the
[49:54] blood on that cross is still w
[49:57] but my father has accepted it for the
[50:00] sin of my people oh my goodness gracious
[50:04] brother man said that's when he kicked
[50:05] open the the gates of hell and took the
[50:07] keys from the from the devil of death
[50:09] Hell In The Grave he took all his keys
[50:11] that's why the Bible says that he
[50:14] spooled amen he spooled principalities
[50:17] and powers and made a show of them
[50:19] openly triumphing over them in other
[50:22] words when a man conquers when a man
[50:25] conquers a city great conqueror he would
[50:27] spool and he would take all the goods
[50:29] out of the city and take them with him
[50:31] isn't it something he would take the
[50:33] goods out of the city and he would take
[50:35] him with him and Jesus did this he so
[50:37] spooled hell until tell all the way up
[50:40] in the end time in the first seal amen
[50:43] it reveals he's got a bow but no arrows
[50:46] it found out that he wasn't at one
[50:48] weapon left in hell to defeat the church
[50:50] with he was stripped of every Power amen
[50:53] Jesus stripped him of his grave and his
[50:56] power so much that Paul actually even
[50:58] said that sting amen of death had been
[51:01] lost other words he you could still die
[51:04] but Brother The Sting of it's gone any
[51:06] man that dies in Christ he only sleeps
[51:08] and he goes into the six diens and
[51:10] waiting on the presence of God now what
[51:13] he did when he got there as he preached
[51:15] the souls in prison he told him how they
[51:17] missed him in the days of Noah they told
[51:19] him you turn me down when you turn down
[51:21] Enoch's prophesying you turn me down
[51:24] when you turn down the blood there with
[51:26] Noah and the Ark of the Covenant and
[51:28] Jesus was able to tell them he was the
[51:30] Christ of every age you see what it was
[51:33] they turned him down when they turned
[51:35] down Noah and they turned him down when
[51:37] they turned down Moses and they turned
[51:38] down it was him they were turning down
[51:41] is that right and he told them all that
[51:43] but but brother B said but see that
[51:45] wasn't his only job it wasn't just to
[51:47] preach the souls in prison and tell them
[51:50] what they had lost total loss the total
[51:53] loss was being preached to yeah now come
[51:56] on yeah you said preacher preaching oh
[51:58] yeah he was preaching now this is the
[52:00] beauty of this sister of Barb his body
[52:02] was in the grave his Spirit had went
[52:05] back to God but his soul had went to
[52:08] hell brother Brandon said he preached in
[52:11] hell in a theophany
[52:13] body come on church he preached in hell
[52:16] in a theophany body Oh Glory to God it
[52:20] wasn't a physical body it was a
[52:22] theophonic body it was the angel of the
[52:25] Lord and with their priest no wonder the
[52:27] prophet said in JC Pennies we're back in
[52:30] hell again Souls that are in prison but
[52:33] Jesus body's not here is it but that
[52:36] same Pillar of Fire has come in this
[52:38] last day and preaching here today the
[52:41] same as he did back
[52:44] there yes
[52:46] sir he was preaching to souls in prison
[52:48] to tell them you're not coming out of
[52:50] here but I want you to know where you
[52:51] missed it y is't that something oh they
[52:56] would they missed it and then he says he
[52:57] moved from there and he went to Paradise
[53:00] now that's where the sons of God were
[53:02] remember when when Samuel in the witch
[53:04] of indoor the witch called Samuel up and
[53:07] brother BR said it could only be done
[53:09] because the blood of Jesus hadn't been
[53:10] shed yet he said that's where the
[53:12] Catholic people get mixed up and they
[53:13] try to commune with the
[53:15] dead somebody said well you're communing
[53:17] with the Dead with Jesus no He's
[53:20] Alive no He's
[53:22] Alive
[53:24] Hallelujah now look at what he done
[53:27] these saints were in Paradise right yes
[53:31] sir now they were there
[53:34] preserved under sacrificial blood of
[53:37] lambs and right there in that place was
[53:40] high priest who had offered those
[53:43] Lambs all of the work of Mosaic law and
[53:47] the Revelation but they were still in
[53:48] that
[53:49] place but when Jesus left
[53:52] there he led the Captivity captive and
[53:56] he took the captives out of the prison
[53:58] doors now this is beautiful to me
[54:00] because when he started his Ascension he
[54:03] went as far down as a man could go right
[54:08] but when he started on his way back up
[54:11] that's when brother Bram tells it I
[54:12] don't have time to preach it tonight but
[54:14] you know the story but that's when
[54:16] Abraham and Isaac and Joshua and Moses
[54:19] and can you imagine what A
[54:23] procession the Bible says in Matthew 27
[54:26] chapter it's recorded that when Jesus
[54:29] died the Rocks rent The Temper veil was
[54:32] rent the Bible said and they which slept
[54:35] in the dust of the earth arose with him
[54:38] can you imagine brother said that's when
[54:40] job come out and he said he standing
[54:42] there wasn't a teaspoon left of him
[54:44] right but here he is standing in his own
[54:48] body now here's the beautiful part of
[54:51] this is when they resurrected Brother
[54:53] Richard they're walking around in
[54:54] Jerusalem yeah
[54:57] the Bible said they appeared unto
[55:00] many man now you you're talking about
[55:03] some powerful times
[55:05] folks that
[55:07] Saints are
[55:09] appearing among the
[55:11] people now now
[55:14] Jesus can't take these folks into heaven
[55:17] yet right now this is something's
[55:20] amazing there has
[55:23] been no sacrifice on on the throne of
[55:27] God
[55:28] yet but you here here's a beautiful
[55:31] thing the work of Ascension now in John
[55:33] chapter 20 when Jesus comes it's Mary
[55:36] who's there at the grave right and Jesus
[55:38] said unto Heroman why thou weepest whom
[55:41] thou seekest thou she supposing him to
[55:44] be the gardener said unto him sir if
[55:46] thou had borne him hence tell me where
[55:49] thou has laid him and I will take him
[55:51] away and Jesus said unto her
[55:54] Mary and she turned herself and say unto
[55:57] him robona which is to say master and
[56:00] Jesus say unto her touch me not for I am
[56:04] not ascended to my father but go to my
[56:07] brethren and say unto them I Ascend unto
[56:11] my father and your father and to my God
[56:14] and your
[56:15] God now that's amazing in the morning
[56:18] time but in the same day late in the
[56:21] evening there they are amen after8 days
[56:24] again his disciples we're with then that
[56:26] Thomas then Jesus came the doors being
[56:29] shut stood in the midst and said Peace
[56:31] be unto
[56:32] you and then saith he to Thomas reach
[56:35] hither thy finger and behold my hands
[56:38] and reached hither thy hand and thrust
[56:39] into my side and be not faithless but
[56:42] believeing and Thomas answered and said
[56:44] unto
[56:45] him my
[56:47] Lord and my God anybody ever says that
[56:51] Jesus is not God well there's your
[56:52] answer yeah Thomas had his hands on him
[56:55] and said said my Lord and my God now
[56:59] what's amazing here is he just told Mary
[57:02] you can't touch
[57:04] me and now he's telling Thomas to touch
[57:07] my side touch my hands the prophet
[57:10] actually picks this up in resurrection
[57:12] of Jesus and he said see it's the most
[57:15] neglected thing any Scripture I know of
[57:17] is the Ascension of the Lord Jesus what
[57:19] he did after his resurrection now he did
[57:22] not sit down on the tomb after his
[57:24] resurrection because his work wasn't
[57:26] completed it wasn't finished the ones at
[57:30] the grave the morning was forbidden to
[57:32] touch him but that night they were
[57:34] bidden to come and fill his hands he
[57:37] forbid his mother to touch him and he
[57:38] said I've not yet ascended unto my
[57:40] father my God and yours and he had not
[57:42] yet he was only ready to do his great
[57:45] high priest work at that time isn't that
[57:48] amazing amen questions and answers
[57:51] brother Ram said that's right he wasn't
[57:52] to be touched until after the
[57:54] resurrection he had come from the earthy
[57:56] he come out from the earth and was
[57:58] walking among men but he had not yet
[58:01] ascended Mary don't touch me don't touch
[58:04] me I'm not yet ascended to the father
[58:06] but I Ascend to my God and your God and
[58:09] that night after he had done went up
[58:11] before God Amen had rose from the dead
[58:15] went up before God coming back he
[58:19] invited Thomas to come and touch his
[58:21] side you said preacher what was he doing
[58:24] in that moment of time now look look at
[58:26] this it's beautiful because there's
[58:27] actually two two ascensions of Christ
[58:31] because in this one he's doing it in a
[58:33] secret and how many realizes a high
[58:35] priest has to do this work alone there's
[58:38] nobody could go in there with him amen
[58:41] so watch what he does he brings out the
[58:43] disciples in paradise and leaves them in
[58:46] the city and while they're in the city
[58:50] amen fellowshipping one the other he
[58:52] slips off and Mary sees him on his way
[58:55] where's he going the high priest he's
[58:57] going into the Throne of God in Hebrews
[59:00] chapter n he said All Things Must Be
[59:02] sprinkled by the blood and Jesus
[59:05] becoming the high priest oh thanks be to
[59:08] God
[59:09] mdct hallelujah he went back to heavens
[59:13] and he slipped in there by himself and
[59:16] he atoned the sins of the people oh but
[59:20] it wasn't all there was to it friend he
[59:22] didn't just want to atone the blood he
[59:24] wanted you to know it was happening he
[59:27] wanted you to understand what had taken
[59:29] place in the secrecy of the work of the
[59:32] Ascension he had broke through the veils
[59:34] of sickness and disease and spookiness
[59:37] and Superstition and every Power that
[59:40] held you out of the presence of God and
[59:42] he slips back into the Earth and starts
[59:46] 40 days establishing his kingdom with
[59:48] his children and at the end of 40 days
[59:51] now I can't preach all night so we'll
[59:53] get here at the end of 40 days it's a
[59:56] powerful happening they're all standing
[59:58] out there together and there is he the
[1:00:01] high priest but now he stands among them
[1:00:04] and brother
[1:00:05] Stephen can you
[1:00:07] imagine watching the master the Lord the
[1:00:13] one that come from Heaven that has done
[1:00:16] all this work and he starts
[1:00:22] levitating and before all the crowd
[1:00:26] they saw him going into the
[1:00:29] heavens Now isn't it
[1:00:31] amazing why did they want him to see
[1:00:35] that why did he want the world why did
[1:00:37] he want his Believers to see
[1:00:40] this you know what he was
[1:00:43] doing he was letting them know that not
[1:00:47] only had I raise
[1:00:48] alone but now I'm going to take a human
[1:00:51] vessel and I'm going to return into the
[1:00:54] heavens and I'm going to show you
[1:00:56] I'm going to go sit on the throne of God
[1:00:59] and I'm going to intercede for you in a
[1:01:02] human body in the heavens so that you
[1:01:05] can know because I live you live also
[1:01:08] and you can know tonight there's
[1:01:09] somebody sitting in heaven that knows
[1:01:11] how you feel there's somebody in heaven
[1:01:13] tonight that knows your Temptation
[1:01:15] there's somebody in heaven tonight that
[1:01:16] knows what it is to be a man in the
[1:01:18] struggles and the stresses of life amen
[1:01:21] but he overcame and sat down on his
[1:01:23] father's throne and so will you overcome
[1:01:26] and sit down on that Throne listen
[1:01:27] tonight you have a power by the work of
[1:01:30] this Ascension here tonight every man of
[1:01:33] you that's got the Holy Ghost has got a
[1:01:34] right to break into the atmospheres of
[1:01:37] God to subdue the spirits of depression
[1:01:40] and negative feelings and unbelief amen
[1:01:43] and doubts and fears and every dark
[1:01:45] spirit that covers the church I say it's
[1:01:48] time to break through church break
[1:01:50] through the thing and let God Amen let
[1:01:52] his mercies be aligned with yours listen
[1:01:55] I'll tell you it's become a glorious
[1:01:56] thing to see that God is so LED
[1:01:59] captivity captive brother B said when he
[1:02:01] went up into the heavens he took all of
[1:02:03] them from Paradise with him and they
[1:02:06] walked through the streets of the New
[1:02:08] Jerusalem that he could show the the
[1:02:11] whole of Heavens that his children had
[1:02:13] been liberated oh I'll tell you this
[1:02:16] morning I believe there's a church been
[1:02:18] liberated with him I believe we've been
[1:02:20] liberated from every dark Spirit until
[1:02:23] the power of the Holy Ghost has been
[1:02:25] released and real
