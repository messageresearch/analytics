[0:03] um in the book of Ephesians uh we want
[0:06] to take uh for reading Ephesians chapter
[0:09] 1 I want to read those first four
[0:12] verses and I'm not going to be able to
[0:14] of course do justice to this as I read
[0:17] it but I'm just going to read it and
[0:19] then we're going to speak about it in
[0:22] Ephesians chapter
[0:24] 1 and one Paul an apostle of Jesus
[0:28] Christ but the will of God and to the
[0:30] Saints which are at Ephesus and to the
[0:32] faithful in Christ Jesus now Grace be to
[0:35] you and peace from God our Father and
[0:37] from the Lord Jesus Christ and blessed
[0:40] be the God and the father of our Lord
[0:41] Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all
[0:45] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[0:48] in Christ now according as he has chosen
[0:52] Us in him before the foundation of the
[0:55] world that we should be holy and Without
[0:58] Blame before him in love and I'm just
[0:59] going to add this next verse having
[1:02] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:04] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:07] according to the pleasure of his will we
[1:11] ask the Lord to bless his word as you
[1:13] could be seated this
[1:15] morning I want to uh just travel here in
[1:19] this uh portion of scripture and I'm
[1:21] going to be uh speaking uh uh generally
[1:24] uh about some of this as well as
[1:25] detailed maybe but uh I'm I'm uh you
[1:28] know me I'm not all together teacher I'm
[1:30] more preacher probably than teacher so
[1:33] uh when the anointing comes it just
[1:34] starts putting things together a little
[1:36] better for me you know and and it's such
[1:38] a blessing it's good to have brother
[1:40] gourd here this morning God bless you
[1:41] brother gour a dear friend of ours from
[1:43] Saskatoon area there and amen uh we
[1:46] certainly good to see you today and
[1:49] we're uh we're going to be taking in
[1:50] this book of Ephesians and I just want
[1:52] to speak here in this second part and I
[1:54] I want to maybe to say that I think it's
[1:57] a powerful uh time that we're living
[2:00] and the book of Ephesians is something
[2:02] that is very uh it's very relevant to
[2:04] the time we're living as a prophet would
[2:07] say it he would tell us this that the
[2:09] book of Ephesians is the greatest book
[2:11] of the New Testament and he says because
[2:13] it actually parallels that of Joshua of
[2:16] the Old Testament which was where
[2:19] brother Bram says Calvinism and armenis
[2:21] arism is going to run together it's
[2:24] where it's going to meet and it's going
[2:25] to bring a balance into the teaching uh
[2:28] this is where that it's going to bring
[2:31] balance into lives and and if it it
[2:34] parallels of course the Old Testament
[2:36] Joshua then it speaks of how that when
[2:39] the children of Israel receiving promise
[2:41] had crossed the Jordan River amen which
[2:44] was a type of the Holy Ghost and when
[2:46] they crossed the Jordan River and they
[2:47] got on the other side they didn't sit
[2:49] down on the banks but rather they were
[2:51] directed into portions of that land
[2:54] according to the calling of God upon
[2:57] their lives which had been for ordained
[2:59] by their mother mothers even in their in
[3:01] their ordination of hundreds of years
[3:04] before they was born their forefathers
[3:06] their names were placing them in there
[3:09] and Joshua caught that inspiration and
[3:11] would begin to place them in those same
[3:13] places by the grace of God and and
[3:15] showing that for thetion of course is
[3:17] what Paul is doing with the New
[3:19] Testament Church and he's saying now
[3:21] that we've crossed into the Holy Ghost
[3:23] now we're not just going to sit on the
[3:26] banks of the Jordan or just say we got
[3:28] the Holy Ghost but it's going to be
[3:30] doing something the holy spirit is going
[3:31] to give us inheritance it's going to
[3:34] place us it's going to put us in those
[3:36] positions where God had been with of
[3:39] course this is a type of Joshua going
[3:42] into the Canaan land and the Canaan land
[3:44] does not really type Heaven the Canaan
[3:47] land is a type of the Overcomer how
[3:49] they're overcoming in their lives and
[3:52] and of course there's battles amen and
[3:54] if somebody ever tells you would you get
[3:56] the Holy Ghost the battle's over well
[3:58] now the battle is over of whether you're
[4:00] saved or not but the battle with your
[4:03] enemy has just begun amen and if you're
[4:05] thinking that everything's just going to
[4:07] be wonderful and there's no hindrances
[4:09] well somebody sold you the wrong gospel
[4:12] because the gospel of the Salvation the
[4:15] Gospel of Jesus Christ amen is a is a
[4:18] gospel that we're fighting a real
[4:21] enemy amen but we're going to overcome I
[4:24] I love the Bible don't you and we're
[4:25] going to overcome amen now this Canan
[4:28] does not represent the Millennium it
[4:30] represents the Overcomer and and so we
[4:33] recognize then that we're coming out of
[4:36] and we're going into now I look at this
[4:39] age that we're living mostly the church
[4:41] that we're speaking to is a going into
[4:44] Stage we're not really coming out of
[4:47] denominations or coming out of things
[4:49] but rather we're more going into
[4:51] something is where our emphasis usually
[4:54] lies on going into the promises because
[4:57] of where we are positionally as a church
[5:00] and and you can feel however you feel
[5:02] but I'll tell you how I feel amen I'm
[5:04] speaking to an adopted Church of people
[5:07] who knows their positions our our
[5:09] leadership is in position our our songs
[5:12] are in position our deacons are in
[5:14] positions our people are in positions
[5:16] you see positioned in the power of the
[5:19] holy spirit amen under Authority that
[5:22] comes from God now uh now somebody say
[5:24] well brother why a't everybody no I'm
[5:26] talking about the church but I'll say
[5:27] this individuals Within the church as
[5:30] well have found their adoption now I can
[5:32] say that to you because I know the
[5:35] Harvest season's on right now amen and
[5:37] there's one thing we found out about a
[5:39] harvest not every plant comes to
[5:41] maturity at the same time but some of
[5:43] the field is in maturity why others are
[5:46] still maturing but you can't
[5:48] disassociate and say that it's not part
[5:50] of that field is not mature because part
[5:53] of it really is amen and you're not
[5:55] waiting on the mature part you're
[5:57] waiting on the part that's not mature
[5:59] but if you let the sun shine just a
[6:01] little while longer amen the rest of us
[6:04] will catch up amen it's going to there
[6:06] there's a catching up Amen in the in the
[6:09] quick work of God in this end time now
[6:12] this is what we're looking at as a new
[6:14] testament believer we're believing in a
[6:16] Land Of Promise of the spirit of God now
[6:19] this this this what I'm teaching this
[6:22] morning what Paul is teaching this is
[6:24] not for
[6:26] babies this is not for the outside world
[6:28] in other words this is not an
[6:30] Evangelical sermon per se amen or
[6:33] Evangelical book this book is to
[6:35] Believers Ephesians is to Believers it
[6:37] is a going into what you have been
[6:40] positioned or what you have been saved
[6:42] for now not for grown-ups brother Ram
[6:44] says but watch it to the faithful who
[6:46] are in Christ Jesus not to Sinners
[6:48] babies but to them that are grown up
[6:50] remember Paul saying I have some things
[6:53] to say but really I can't say them now
[6:55] he said but he but he did say but I'd
[6:58] like to talk about milk kind ack and I
[7:00] I'd like to say these things he said but
[7:02] but you have need of milk he said but
[7:05] but mature people have a that they're
[7:07] able to take strong meat amen so MDC was
[7:11] considered strong meat right mcdc was
[7:15] considered strong meat so Paul wasn't
[7:18] saying amen that not everybody could
[7:20] take something or nor am I speaking to
[7:22] this church this morning saying that
[7:24] you're a bunch of babies needing milk
[7:26] but rather to the age that the age of
[7:29] Paul
[7:29] he wasn't able to teach the things he
[7:31] wanted to teach then but he knew there
[7:34] was a harvest coming a mature church and
[7:37] adopted people would come in the end
[7:39] time to receive mature teaching now
[7:42] isn't it amazing Paul only meets mecdc
[7:45] talks to MDC just a little bit amen but
[7:47] when brother bandam comes along he makes
[7:49] entire sermons called MDC the great
[7:52] priest king then he comes in and speaks
[7:54] on who is this mdic because it become
[7:57] the season of meat it become the season
[8:00] amen and y'all know this amen that that
[8:02] all the all the anointings of the ages
[8:05] they were Earthbound wasn't they and all
[8:07] of them start on milk but the eagle age
[8:09] is an age of meat eaters it's never milk
[8:13] even the babies in the eagles eat the
[8:15] meat amen because that's what the father
[8:18] does he feeds them the meat this is the
[8:20] age amen of of meat this is the age amen
[8:24] of strong meat that belongs to the
[8:26] Church of the Living God and some things
[8:28] are so strong they're little hard to
[8:31] swallow so this isn't to everybody it's
[8:34] to Abraham's seed right and we proved
[8:37] that heavily Thursday night this isn't
[8:39] to everybody this is to Abraham's seed
[8:42] so if it seems so far stretched it might
[8:45] not be for some people but it's for
[8:48] Abraham's seed amen it's for those that
[8:50] can take it now brother bradam himself
[8:53] had the ministry of Joshua to position
[8:56] the church and if you go back and you
[8:58] find amen pick up your pen and write
[9:01] there spoken word Original Seed then in
[9:03] the church age book you'll hear brother
[9:04] randam say that that that that Joshua
[9:07] represents the end time messenger and
[9:10] Caleb represents the believer of that
[9:13] end time messenger amen so we find out
[9:16] then that Joshua was the one leading
[9:18] them into the promises he was there
[9:21] positionally placing them like Ephesians
[9:24] does US promises that were given that
[9:27] must be fought for promises
[9:29] that's not just going to the devil's not
[9:32] just going to lay down and let you
[9:34] receive these things that God has
[9:36] promised you're going to have to fight
[9:37] for these things it's not just going to
[9:39] be amen that the devil's going to roll
[9:41] up the curtain said y'all come on in get
[9:43] all these promises and take this land no
[9:46] he's going to do everything he can to
[9:49] prevent you from coming to the maturity
[9:52] of receiving the promises that you have
[9:55] been foreordained to take according to
[9:58] the word of God amen this is a time as
[10:00] it was in Joshua when they fought the
[10:03] great Kings when when the Kings started
[10:05] coming together to fight against Joshua
[10:08] it was in that stage even that Joshua
[10:10] exercised great Authority and power for
[10:14] possession of his land that's when
[10:16] Joshua a man told the son to stand still
[10:20] he could do that because he was going to
[10:22] take what belonged to him amen and when
[10:24] you get ready to take what belongs to
[10:26] you you'll find out you're serving a
[10:29] supernatural God and the god that gave
[10:32] it to you has the ability to help you
[10:35] receive it he's not a God that can just
[10:37] be overrun or he's not a God that we
[10:40] just have to lay down and take whatever
[10:42] the enemy puts upon us but as Sons and
[10:45] Daughters of God we have an authority
[10:47] that when it belongs to us we can stand
[10:50] with the god-given rights and say this
[10:53] belongs to me and if we got to make the
[10:55] sun stand still brother there's a power
[10:58] in the Church of the Living God that can
[11:00] make the sun stand
[11:03] still amen now I I can give it to you in
[11:06] the scripture if you want to see it
[11:07] it'll make the sun stand still it's it's
[11:09] a power that God give the church now it
[11:12] was in the greatest battle ever fought
[11:14] wasn't it amen it was in the Battle of
[11:16] Joshua for the promises of God and kings
[11:20] were conglomerating against him amen
[11:23] other words they were they were forming
[11:24] unions against him to keep him out of
[11:27] them promises when he told that son to
[11:29] stand still do you see where we are in
[11:32] the end time is the greatest battle that
[11:35] has ever been fought is fighting now now
[11:38] when did that battle begin brother Ram
[11:41] says in greatest battle ever fought it's
[11:42] about to begin now because the seals
[11:45] were going to be opened and when the
[11:47] seals were opened it was revealing
[11:49] Redemptive rights of the Church of the
[11:51] Living God and when you got ready to
[11:54] take your rights the enemy said no you
[11:56] can't have these rights amen but God who
[11:59] is rich in Mercy knew that Darkness was
[12:02] settling upon the Earth but he sent a
[12:05] messenger in the earth to speak the word
[12:07] of God and the spoken word became light
[12:11] at the time that when the when the when
[12:13] the very time itself stand still and
[12:16] there we are fighting under the light of
[12:19] the evening message what is it it's a
[12:21] positive thing tonight this morning it's
[12:23] a positive thing it's the it's a
[12:25] position of the church to be in the
[12:28] right position it takes a complete
[12:31] understanding positionally of who you
[12:34] are teaching positions the
[12:38] church that's right teaching positions
[12:41] the church now y'all heard me Thursday I
[12:43] don't believe amen just in just in a a
[12:46] in a icle teaching I don't believe in
[12:48] just dry theology but teaching positions
[12:51] the church because teaching breaks open
[12:54] the word and shows you positionally what
[12:57] is yours what belongs to you and the
[13:00] power behind it to take it from the
[13:02] devil who's trying to keep it from the
[13:04] church now see what it is Hope turns to
[13:07] Faith and when Faith Comes it already
[13:10] belongs to you do you see the difference
[13:12] many people are hoping today that they
[13:14] can be healed that they can be saved
[13:16] they hope that something's going to
[13:18] happen but you see faith is different in
[13:20] that is Faith believes that it's already
[13:23] there faith is believing it's already
[13:25] settled then we find out I'm not hoping
[13:28] I'm going to be a son faith says I'm
[13:30] already a son hoping is not I'm going to
[13:33] be sealed with the Holy Ghost faith says
[13:36] I'm already sealed amen come on Church
[13:38] When Faith takes a hold faith will stop
[13:41] the devil in his tracks because brother
[13:43] R said faith has muscles Faith knows
[13:46] where it's at faith has hair on his
[13:48] chest Faith don't have to ask nobody
[13:51] Faith already knows and in the hour
[13:53] We're living the Bible said that the
[13:55] Faith of Our Fathers would be restored
[13:58] back to the Church of the Living God
[14:01] faith amen Faith to believe there's a
[14:03] God when you don't see it when you don't
[14:05] feel it when you don't hear
[14:08] it now now there's laws and and and one
[14:12] of those laws I just touch it here this
[14:14] law the law of electricity heyen would
[14:16] it be something if you come in this
[14:17] morning Brian started to flip on the
[14:19] light and the light don't come on you
[14:21] wouldn't have left church and said
[14:22] there's no such thing as electricity you
[14:24] would be hunting with what's
[14:26] wrong with the electricity you be
[14:29] looking at the breaker You' be looking
[14:30] at the wiring did you pay the light bill
[14:33] amen because you're not going to if it
[14:36] don't work you're not going to say oh
[14:38] there must be no electricity on but
[14:41] you're going to be saying I don't know
[14:43] why the electricity ain't working here
[14:45] and we find out that sometimes when
[14:48] people come to places in their lives
[14:50] they start saying well is there really a
[14:52] god or is there really but that
[14:53] shouldn't be the question the question
[14:55] should be what could we do to get the
[14:58] god that we know is alive and real into
[15:01] my situation there's a way to get
[15:03] electricity in this building there is a
[15:05] way to get the god of Heaven in your
[15:08] situations amen if you want him in your
[15:10] finances bring him into your finances if
[15:13] you want him in your marriage bring him
[15:14] in your marriage if you want him in your
[15:16] church bring him in your church the
[15:18] Bible said I stand at the door and knock
[15:20] and if any man will open I will come
[15:22] unto him the Bible says if you resist
[15:25] the devil he will res he will flee from
[15:27] you if you draw nigh to God he'll draw
[15:30] nigh to you if you want him involved
[15:33] then invite him into your situation to
[15:36] Lord Jesus I don't know what to do with
[15:37] this come on and get in this situation
[15:40] because when you get God involved he is
[15:42] an omnipotent force that can change the
[15:46] situations whatever is it going
[15:49] along ever presentes water from the rock
[15:51] I love how brother Bram says this he
[15:53] said the power that's in the church now
[15:55] we're talking about positioning the
[15:57] power that's in the church now now is
[15:59] controlled by a law the law is a law of
[16:03] Faith it's not keeping
[16:06] Commandments listen to that it's not
[16:08] keeping Commandments it's a law of faith
[16:12] and all things are possible to them that
[16:15] believe in my law this morning all
[16:19] things are possible to a Believer the
[16:22] law of faith says if you can believe it
[16:26] it's possible this morning you said well
[16:28] brother I I don't know about this
[16:29] situation I listen if you can believe it
[16:32] it's possible this morning because the
[16:34] law says all things are possible to them
[16:38] that
[16:39] believe that's right all things are
[16:42] possible if you can believe it now this
[16:45] is a powerful quote this should be on
[16:47] your refrigerator if it's not and if you
[16:49] can believe it whatever God leads your
[16:52] soul to
[16:54] believe that is
[16:57] yours see God leads your soul to believe
[17:01] every place The Souls of your foot can
[17:03] set upon God gives it to you it's yours
[17:07] you possess it if you can find the key
[17:10] to the law faith will open it up for you
[17:13] now watch every place every place that
[17:15] you put your foot do you see there in
[17:17] Joshua every place be strong and of good
[17:21] courage don't be discouraged amen I have
[17:24] given you the land but how are they
[17:26] going to take it they wasn't taking
[17:28] Israel at Palestine at that time they
[17:30] wasn't taken it at one time they took it
[17:33] 6 Ines at a time they took a step and
[17:36] they possessed that land they were on if
[17:38] they had to fight for it and then they
[17:40] took another step and they took another
[17:43] step and sometimes when you look at the
[17:45] situations that are in your life or in
[17:47] the Amen in in your in your area or
[17:50] whatever that Fellowship you're in and
[17:52] you look at that and and you say I I
[17:55] don't know how that's ever going to
[17:56] change well I tell you it can change 6
[17:59] Ines at a
[18:01] time because if you can take a step now
[18:04] what does that mean it means God leads
[18:07] your heart to believe do you know the
[18:09] beauty of absolutes we all need
[18:10] absolutes don't we absolutes lead to
[18:14] Paradox if you have an absolute it leads
[18:17] you to a paradox in other words when God
[18:19] said cross this Jordan I have given you
[18:21] this land there was the absolute but the
[18:24] Paradox is how can we take a land when
[18:27] they're bigger than us and they're
[18:29] meaner than us and they're amen they're
[18:31] trained men how can we do it who cares
[18:33] how we're going to do it we can do it
[18:36] because God said we can do it so there's
[18:38] an absolute that is laying over every
[18:41] Paradox in our life if God leads you to
[18:44] it you can do
[18:47] it if God leads you to it you can do it
[18:50] now how will God lead he leads by his
[18:54] word is that right God leads by his word
[18:58] it leads to Paradox
[19:01] uh I wouldn't have a lot of time to go
[19:03] here but I'll say this whatever God
[19:05] leads you to
[19:07] believe do you see if he leads you to
[19:10] believe something by his word then
[19:12] whatever the word says you can do that
[19:14] you can do because he leads you every
[19:16] place the souls your foot set God gives
[19:19] you that amen then you can have it I
[19:22] love the bottom part of this quote
[19:24] brother Ram says it like this as much
[19:25] Faith as we be released that's how much
[19:28] much power you can have because in you
[19:30] dwells power to make heavens and earth
[19:33] and God dwells in you and your sons and
[19:36] daughters of God there you
[19:40] are it's your
[19:43] faith it's according to your
[19:48] faith it's according to your faith now I
[19:52] believe God is leading the church to
[19:55] Mountain Moving
[19:57] faith amen I believe there's challenges
[20:00] going on in your life because God has
[20:03] led you to that challenge knowing that
[20:06] he's put something in you that you can
[20:08] make it move out of your way come on
[20:11] church that Red Sea didn't get up and
[20:13] get in the way of Israel God LED them to
[20:16] the Red Sea because God was with them
[20:20] and knew that he could cause a way for
[20:23] them to go through when there was no way
[20:26] I tell you what brother Christopher tell
[20:28] you what the prophet said he said God
[20:30] led him there for a purpose he said it
[20:32] was to prove by Moses and that and those
[20:35] people that God Will Make A Way when
[20:37] there is no
[20:38] way hallu that's why they went through
[20:41] that because God can challenge the
[20:43] situation and there's situations going
[20:46] on in lives across this room this
[20:48] morning but I'll say this Heen I believe
[20:50] God's leading
[20:52] us and if God's leading us he knew we
[20:55] were coming to this place then he put
[20:58] put something in you that you can speak
[21:00] to the mountain in front of you you can
[21:02] speak to the challenge in front of you
[21:05] and you say preacher what are you
[21:06] talking about I'm talking about Gentile
[21:08] Authority I'm talking about a positioned
[21:10] believer that knows who he is that knows
[21:12] where he's standing knows where he's
[21:14] going this belongs to me Satan is in my
[21:17] way get out of my way Satan it's my
[21:20] possession it's my inheritance I don't
[21:23] care if it's a wall I don't care if it's
[21:25] a Red Sea I don't care what the problem
[21:28] is there's a God here this morning to
[21:30] back up the word of God and make every
[21:33] mountain
[21:35] move yes sir amen the prophet of God
[21:39] said there must come an Ephesians to
[21:40] this in the in God who is rich in Mercy
[21:43] coming out of going into watch what he
[21:46] says there cannot be one thing in your
[21:48] way to really have genuine Faith you
[21:51] must absolutely leave everything that's
[21:55] contrary to the word of God behind you
[21:58] yeah and enter into
[22:00] Faith enter into Faith isn't that
[22:04] something how do I get into Faith how do
[22:07] I step in you led into Faith by the word
[22:10] of God faith cometh by the hearing and
[22:13] the hearing of the word of God if the
[22:15] word says you can do it there's your
[22:17] leadership to do it come on if the word
[22:20] says you're able I say we're more than
[22:22] able because there's your leadership we
[22:25] are leading by the word of God come on
[22:27] Friends
[22:28] y'all know I'm telling you the truth
[22:30] this little church is not led by dreams
[22:32] and Visions we don't go down amen and
[22:34] come up could you imagine if every
[22:35] Sunday if I come up here and said well I
[22:37] had a dream and we are to go this way
[22:40] yeah can you imagine how that would
[22:42] begin to feel amen you'd be like this
[22:45] one week amen he had a good dream next
[22:47] week he had a bad matter of fact
[22:49] somebody come to me one time and told me
[22:50] said I had a bad dream about you I said
[22:52] well would you go back and dream another
[22:53] one for
[22:54] me I don't want to hear a bad dream I
[22:58] want you prophesying over my life some
[23:00] negative something and I got to lay
[23:01] awake at night and wonder what it meant
[23:03] and how it meant if you know people
[23:05] talking about me don't tell me that I
[23:06] could care less I want to know what the
[23:08] word of God says about me I want to know
[23:11] what a prophet spoke over my life and he
[23:13] spoke blessing he spoke healing he spoke
[23:16] truth it's a positive faith on a
[23:19] positive word and I believe the Church
[23:21] of the Living God can press through it I
[23:23] believe it can press through every
[23:25] enemy that's the truth we find out watch
[23:28] this we find out he've got to come
[23:30] another Ephesians an Ephesus to this
[23:33] there's got to come an Ephesians of this
[23:35] journey of all Journeys there's an
[23:37] Ephesians to
[23:40] it you're on a journey and you take off
[23:43] and you and you're coming from a certain
[23:45] place there's a leaving and and but when
[23:48] you're when you're arriving ain't like
[23:50] when you're
[23:52] leaving and and and most people want to
[23:55] make the message today like it was when
[23:58] we were
[24:00] leaving they want to take us back there
[24:02] when we were leaving back from that day
[24:04] and how it happened and what do amen
[24:06] that was when we were leaving we're in
[24:08] another hour We're arriving in the
[24:11] promises of God and there's a generation
[24:14] here maybe that didn't even start with
[24:16] the leaving amen but here they are on
[24:18] the arriving side and amen the power of
[24:21] God is just as real today as it ever was
[24:24] do you see what it is it's the it's it's
[24:27] the arrival or the entrance
[24:30] into it's a different type of time now
[24:34] watch the book was sealed brother B said
[24:36] Seven Seals in the last day Revelations
[24:39] 10 said we would find out the L out to
[24:41] sea of the last messenger during the
[24:44] time of his prophecies the Seven Seals
[24:47] would be opened now that's Revelation
[24:49] 10th chapter if you want to read that he
[24:52] said and we're promised according to
[24:54] Revelations 10 and Malachi 4 and St Luke
[24:58] that there would come an Ephesians to
[25:00] this there must come an Ephesians the
[25:02] Sevenfold mystery of the word of God
[25:05] must be unfolded the unfolding of the
[25:08] word is one thing but the church has got
[25:11] to go into the word that was unfolded
[25:14] and I believe right down in the shadows
[25:16] of the coming of the Lord as Joshua just
[25:18] before the Ephesians raised up John the
[25:21] Baptist raised up before the next
[25:23] Ephesians and we're promised another
[25:25] Ephesians and it's predicted here in the
[25:27] scripture therefore I think we are
[25:29] living in the Ephesians
[25:32] again amen we're living in the Ephesians
[25:35] again amen what is that Ephesians we
[25:39] will receive an understanding isn't that
[25:42] amazing that a prophet's going to lay
[25:45] Ephesians over understanding in other
[25:47] words amen we're not moving into a
[25:49] physical land we're not going to step
[25:52] it's not a physical land we're dealing
[25:54] with it is a spiritual land and
[25:57] spiritual Authority comes from
[26:00] understanding now church I mean I I tell
[26:03] you when the seals were opened you
[26:04] didn't know who you were but as you
[26:06] begin to know who you are you know what
[26:08] belongs to you and the clearer it is who
[26:12] you are the clearing is what belongs to
[26:15] you and here we are with the clarity of
[26:18] the word in the last days you you you
[26:20] Elders know what I'm talking about when
[26:22] you first come into the message they
[26:23] couldn't figure out if the seven seal
[26:25] was open or
[26:26] not well there ain't a sermon like that
[26:28] preached at all
[26:30] anymore not at least Among Us there's
[26:33] not even a suggestion that it couldn't
[26:35] be open as's a Clarity here for our
[26:39] young people that wasn't here when I
[26:41] first come in this message in the in the
[26:43] '90s I remember hitting the field and
[26:45] the biggest argument in the field seven
[26:47] seal was open seven seal was closed
[26:49] funny thing is I had already read the
[26:51] prophet without all the ideas and the
[26:54] prophet of God said it was the opening
[26:55] of Seven Seals that's right so I just
[26:58] believed it and it was so much easier
[27:00] because I didn't have to comb through
[27:01] all those things had an understanding
[27:04] could just come upon my life do you see
[27:06] what it is the availability you don't
[27:08] have to be an elder in the message to
[27:10] get an understanding of what God is
[27:12] doing because we're further down the
[27:15] road now than we were 40 years
[27:18] ago come on young people this is a
[27:21] season of the generation of God to pick
[27:24] up this word and begin to believe this
[27:26] word we're not trying to come through
[27:29] well whether is it one God or is there
[27:30] two Gods come on that stuff
[27:33] settled is there a Prophet coming or is
[27:36] there not a prophet coming listen it's a
[27:38] settled matter we are not here debating
[27:41] whether there's a prophet or not a
[27:42] prophet of course there's a prophet if
[27:45] you believe your Bible you would have to
[27:47] believe that so I'm not trying to tell
[27:49] the world a prophet is here I'm trying
[27:51] to tell the world what a prophet said
[27:54] and not what he said about Rome and not
[27:56] what he said about Russia but what he
[27:58] said about the bride it affects me what
[28:02] did he say about me what is the
[28:04] prophecies over my life where am I going
[28:06] to live what am I going to do what is my
[28:10] [Music]
[28:13] inheritance got a titled need to it my
[28:16] name has been spoken over it and
[28:18] wherever you can put your foot whatever
[28:20] you can believe it belongs to
[28:26] you it's an Ephesian and we're
[28:30] here it's what brother Bram said and
[28:32] we're here now it's amazing to me when
[28:36] you start when you start Landing in
[28:40] those heavenly places in Christ when you
[28:44] take the seat that belongs to
[28:47] you when you're seated in the right
[28:51] place if you try to take something
[28:53] that's not your it won't work right but
[28:57] when you're seated there by God yes it's
[29:00] something alltogether different am now
[29:03] now I say that watch watch how watch how
[29:05] the scripture says we're blessed with
[29:07] all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[29:08] places brother BR says Heavenly places
[29:11] is
[29:12] position it's your position in the word
[29:16] now how can you be the bride and not be
[29:19] a part of that word but you got to know
[29:21] what part of the word you
[29:23] are see build an ark that's the word but
[29:27] not our
[29:29] part amen put a blood streak over the
[29:32] door that's the word but not our
[29:36] part you got to know what part of the
[29:38] word you
[29:40] are now first first Thessalonians
[29:43] chapter 4 the Lord himself shall descend
[29:45] from heaven with a shout not my part but
[29:47] he would have a voice there's your part
[29:51] that there would be a voice of the
[29:55] Resurrection now I'm talking about
[29:57] Joshua folks he placed every messenger
[29:59] and placed every Age first guy that ever
[30:01] did it he laid it out and said he was
[30:03] here and he was here and he was here and
[30:04] he was here and then he looks at the
[30:06] bride and says you're the final voice to
[30:08] the final age so the same one that
[30:10] placed Paul over the Ephesians that put
[30:13] Luther over his age put you and I as the
[30:16] voice of the
[30:19] Resurrection placed Us in the
[30:24] Rapture that's why I'm not falling apart
[30:27] this
[30:29] morning with all the things that are
[30:32] happening in the
[30:34] East if you're an unwise virgin your
[30:37] time's
[30:38] coming but for the wise virgin she sees
[30:42] her signs her lamps trimmed her Fire's
[30:46] burning she's eating her food with her
[30:49] shoes on her feet and her staff in her
[30:51] hand cuz she knows it's going on
[30:55] time he I'm going
[30:58] [Applause]
[30:58] [Music]
[31:03] home if you don't have that you you you
[31:06] you you you might want to look at
[31:11] things now they're coming to a land the
[31:15] prophet has said in adoption part two
[31:16] they're coming to a land where they're
[31:17] going to get settled down they're going
[31:19] to rest they're going to plant a little
[31:21] corn have Vineyards and they'll eat from
[31:23] their
[31:24] Vineyards he says then we'll leave it to
[31:26] our children
[31:28] you know some of you are right in that
[31:30] stage right
[31:31] now where either you're enjoying what
[31:35] was left to you or you're building
[31:37] something to leave to someone yeah it's
[31:40] just uh there's some talk going on I
[31:42] know brother brother Aiden's doing some
[31:44] moving around right now because he's
[31:45] starting phasing out and leaving
[31:47] something here behind him and but you
[31:49] know wouldn't it be would it it be
[31:50] horrible if you didn't have something to
[31:53] leave or if you didn't have somebody to
[31:54] leave it too you imagine working your
[31:57] whole life and building something and
[31:59] then there's no one to
[32:00] enjoy what's behind it it it but fear
[32:05] not it's the father's Good
[32:08] Will to give to you to leave to
[32:12] you the
[32:14] kingdom now here's the beauty is that we
[32:18] we we leave it to our children now
[32:19] here's the thing in paragraph 16
[32:22] adoption part two he says it was a great
[32:25] thing that inheritance is inheritance in
[32:27] a land that no one else but a close
[32:29] Kinsman could redeem The Inheritance now
[32:32] let me drop a little token here that I
[32:34] touched on the other night to your
[32:35] mothers this is powerful now how many
[32:39] here has ever prayed for a lost loved
[32:42] one he asked it I want to ask it he says
[32:46] listen that's your
[32:48] inheritance now we're we're this is
[32:51] Joshua
[32:52] folks and this ain't to
[32:55] everybody but to them that were under
[32:58] him it was a positioning of what belongs
[33:03] to
[33:04] them now watch him lay that belonging to
[33:08] you as an inheritance he says now watch
[33:11] this amen he carries this now now the
[33:15] reason he gets into this is a woman in
[33:17] adoption part one I'll just give you a
[33:18] brief he adoption part one a woman comes
[33:20] in the prayer line brother R praying for
[33:22] people praying for people and he comes
[33:23] to the last one he said because you're
[33:24] the last one I'm going to do some
[33:25] teaching here and then he starts
[33:27] teaching on what it means to pray for
[33:30] your children so on adoption part two he
[33:33] comes back picks it up and he says see
[33:35] this inheritance of these
[33:37] children brother Eric this inheritance
[33:40] of these children he said let me drop a
[33:42] little token here I touched the other
[33:44] night mothers amen how many here ever
[33:47] pray for a lost loved one Paul told the
[33:50] Roman believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[33:53] and thy and thine house shall be saved
[33:58] now if you got
[33:59] faith enough for your own self to be
[34:03] saved have faith enough no matter how
[34:07] wavered the boy is or how wavered the
[34:09] girl is they'll be saved
[34:12] anyhow somehow if he has to lay them on
[34:15] a black if they have to lay in a
[34:17] hospital die they'll be saved God
[34:20] promised it it's an inheritance they
[34:23] shall be
[34:25] there I'll read it to you from Isaiah
[34:27] they shall not labor in vain nor bring
[34:29] forth trouble for their seed of the
[34:32] Blessed of the Lord and their offspring
[34:34] with them and the prophet of God took it
[34:37] to the book of Isaiah and said God has
[34:39] made a promise to the believer they
[34:41] Offspring with them now now there's a
[34:44] that's that's theologically uh uh
[34:46] troubling for some people but see it's
[34:48] also theologically trouble for people to
[34:51] believe Matthew 25 that some people
[34:52] could even be in heaven without a birth
[34:55] yeah yeah I know I know amen
[34:58] theologically they're having a hard time
[35:00] with it but the prophet of God said
[35:01] somebody could give you a cup of cold
[35:03] water and Jesus said it wouldn't go
[35:06] without reward come on Church how
[35:10] powerful is your blood how powerful is
[35:13] your god I tell you he's powerful enough
[35:16] that he's Sovereign and he can do what
[35:18] he wants to and how he wants to and he
[35:20] can save who he wants to cuz he's God
[35:24] and there is nobody beside him to csel
[35:27] him or tell him he's done
[35:29] wrong the prophet said they'd be there
[35:31] without of birth he said granted eternal
[35:34] life because they were good to their
[35:37] brethen it's in the word of God somebody
[35:40] said well they in the bride I don't know
[35:42] how they fit amen he just said they' be
[35:44] there well I tell you glory to God I
[35:46] Think It's Shouting Time To Know amen
[35:49] that we don't live by law we live by the
[35:52] grace of God and the same Grace that
[35:54] come into your life is the same Grace
[35:56] here this morning to change all kinds of
[36:07] Hearts it's a powerful it's a powerful
[36:11] section amen Ephesians parallels
[36:16] Joshua right when you cross the Jordan
[36:20] the first battle that happened was
[36:23] Jericho but in e in Joshua chapter 2
[36:27] before they ever crossed the river spies
[36:29] went over and found rahab's house y'all
[36:32] know the story they found rahab's house
[36:35] and remember amen Rahab took in The
[36:37] Messengers and hid them from being
[36:40] destroyed and the minute she got them in
[36:42] the house she started on them and she
[36:44] said we know your
[36:46] God and we've heard about your God and
[36:49] we fear and tremble at the hearing of
[36:51] your God cuz we knows what he can
[36:54] do and she said now they seek your life
[36:56] lives but I'll hide you man it's
[36:59] powerful isn't it she knew what to do
[37:01] with the word she just knew what to do
[37:03] with them she knew how to she knew how
[37:05] to preserve her own life by the
[37:07] Messengers God sent
[37:09] her she could have just said hey I'm
[37:11] scared and put them outside the but she
[37:13] would have never got what she got had
[37:15] she did that but when she received the
[37:18] messengers she was receiving the word of
[37:21] faith that would change her whole
[37:24] life and not just her life life the life
[37:27] of her
[37:28] family now it's a it's a powerful you
[37:31] can go over and read it and you can see
[37:33] how that when when she hit them amen
[37:35] that when they got ready to leave she
[37:36] told them the story of what she would
[37:37] tell and how they could go and when she
[37:39] got ready she said but listen I require
[37:41] of you something I want a token from you
[37:45] I want a true token now I want a token
[37:47] from you that whenever this place is
[37:49] destroyed that my life will be saved
[37:52] give me some kindness and when she said
[37:54] that to them they said look now amen the
[37:56] very cord you're letting us down with
[37:58] this scarlet cord amen take this cord
[38:01] and when Joshua comes hang it out the
[38:02] window and th and thy house whoever you
[38:06] can get under this is going to be saved
[38:08] and it will not be judgment upon them
[38:10] now now listen I I'm I love to read my
[38:13] Bible and when I read Joshua 2 I see
[38:15] this great promise I see a promise
[38:17] because you know what I'm seeing here
[38:18] Jaden I see that they ask her what do
[38:21] you want and she said I tell you what I
[38:24] really want I want the salvation of my
[38:25] mom and my dad and my family she didn't
[38:28] have children but had she had children
[38:30] she would have said and my children so
[38:32] she didn't even have children but she's
[38:33] claiming family without even having a
[38:36] child under the token of the Lord and
[38:39] when she says this what do you want now
[38:41] Sister bar what she's revealing is her
[38:45] desire right and that and would that be
[38:47] your desire come on would that be your
[38:50] desire do you see that would that be
[38:52] your desire now the beautiful thing is
[38:55] when you have a desire you got to know
[38:57] where that comes from when you have a
[39:00] desire it's got somewhere it came from
[39:03] and watch this woman when she's told
[39:06] them her desire they made her desire a
[39:11] promise and it switched from being what
[39:14] she wanted to what she had as a promise
[39:17] and you might have always wanted your
[39:19] children you wanted your family but your
[39:22] desire has became a promise when a
[39:24] prophet of God said lay the to over them
[39:27] and they'll be saved it's not just my
[39:29] desire it's a promise of the Holy
[39:35] Ghost and if you go on and read Joshua
[39:38] am me just read a couple verses later in
[39:40] Joshua chapter 6 and you'll see the
[39:42] reality that whenever that whenever
[39:43] Joshua come he was a he was an Avenger
[39:46] and he was there to judge he was there
[39:49] as a judge to tear down the walls of
[39:50] Jericho but she didn't come under
[39:52] judgment she was under a token so when
[39:54] she looked out the window she didn't see
[39:57] what the rest of Jericho saw they saw
[40:00] judgment and destruction and the end and
[40:02] she saw opportunity and she saw
[40:04] deliverance and she saw I'm leaving this
[40:07] place because I've got a token what
[40:09] window see she looks out of Made A
[40:12] Difference by the promise she
[40:15] had Joshua chapter 6 says she was saved
[40:18] and her parents was saved and all that
[40:20] was under it was saved so it turned from
[40:22] desire to promise to
[40:25] reality
[40:27] desire promise
[40:30] reality some of you are in the promised
[40:33] stage but some of you know the reality
[40:35] of it
[40:38] already now can I move into the New
[40:41] Testament with it acts the 16th
[40:43] chapter Paul this man who's writing the
[40:48] Ephesians he he stirred things up a bit
[40:50] maybe he wasn't uh maybe he wasn't the
[40:54] uh he didn't just go through town
[40:55] without a mixup you know he always had
[40:58] things stirred up you know he he goes in
[41:00] here in Acts 16 and he's preaching and
[41:02] there's this woman following him and
[41:04] after a while he cast The Demon out of
[41:06] her and the Bible said when her master
[41:08] saw that they couldn't get any more
[41:10] reward from her it wouldn't going to
[41:12] make any more money by her because of
[41:14] this Paul man that they sought to beat
[41:17] him yeah and put him in prison yeah so
[41:20] it was accusations it wasn't honest
[41:22] right but they got it they put him in
[41:24] prison and they had silent with him
[41:27] there and the Bible said at midnight
[41:29] Paul and Silas began to sing praises
[41:31] unto the Lord and the prisoners heard
[41:33] him and suddenly there was a great
[41:35] earthquake and the foundations of the
[41:37] prison were shaken immediately all the
[41:38] doors opened and everyone's bands was
[41:41] loosed wonder what kind of song they
[41:43] were
[41:45] singing and The Keeper of the prison
[41:48] Awakening out of his sleep seeing the
[41:50] prison doors open Drew out his sword and
[41:52] would have killed himself supposing the
[41:54] prisoners had been fled yeah but Paul
[41:57] cried with a voice saying do thyself no
[41:59] harm we are all
[42:02] here and then he called for a
[42:07] light oh I'm so glad when the light
[42:10] shows up in the dark
[42:12] places and then he calls for a light and
[42:15] it sprang in and came trembling and fell
[42:18] down before Paul and Silas and brought
[42:21] them out sir what must I do to be saved
[42:25] he said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[42:27] and thou shall be saved in thine
[42:29] house and they spake unto him the word
[42:32] of the Lord and to they that were in his
[42:34] house and he took them the same hour of
[42:36] the night and washed their stripes and
[42:38] baptized and all this straight away look
[42:42] at this this wasn't a six-month period
[42:44] the man heard the gospel and him and his
[42:47] house got baptized because he knew he
[42:49] was hearing
[42:51] truth powerful thing right they were
[42:54] right there they were the prophet of God
[42:55] said there they they were in that jail
[42:57] he said now remember this is the days of
[42:59] lepers and everything and they're laying
[43:01] on concrete floors and their food and
[43:03] their water and the conditions must have
[43:05] been a hard thing they've been beat the
[43:07] Bible said beat and cast into prison I'm
[43:09] sure they wasn't feeding them good they
[43:10] wasn't washing their clothes they didn't
[43:12] look like clergy at
[43:13] all they wouldn't have looked like
[43:15] clergy they wouldn't have looked like
[43:17] men respected they wasn't wearing a nice
[43:19] suit and clean clothes in a nice car
[43:21] they were in the bottom in the inner
[43:23] part of the jail the Bible says and they
[43:25] were they were right there beating and
[43:27] chained in stocks so the man who was
[43:30] watching them maybe he didn't even know
[43:32] why they were
[43:33] there but he heard them down there
[43:36] singing might have got on their nerves I
[43:39] don't
[43:40] know but brother man said they were
[43:42] singing some good gospel
[43:44] songs he said one place he said maybe it
[43:46] was Power in the
[43:49] Blood don't you know it was wonderwork
[43:52] in power he said maybe they were singing
[43:54] I love him he said but at midnight they
[43:57] were praising God in this kind of
[43:59] condition does that teach us something
[44:02] it matters the atmosphere can be built
[44:06] anywhere it does not matter the room
[44:09] you're in atmosphere can be built
[44:11] anywhere they were building an
[44:14] atmosphere in the innermost part of the
[44:15] jail and they started amen I I I've
[44:18] studied a study one time years ago that
[44:20] said even when people walk across the
[44:22] bridge they make them walk out of Step
[44:24] because they're afraid if they getting
[44:26] the right step that the unity of the
[44:28] vibrations will break bridges down and
[44:31] you can imagine the harmony that must
[44:33] have been in that room that day when
[44:36] they started making Harmony and Paul and
[44:38] Silas started singing amen and the Angel
[44:40] Band started joining in and there was a
[44:43] Harmony and vibrations begin to happen
[44:45] Revival begin to break out brother the
[44:48] walls of the jail housee Begin to
[44:50] Fall I tell you what I'd like to have a
[44:53] worship service like that today wouldn't
[44:55] you amen to when you get to praising the
[44:57] Lord amen till the walls of your prison
[45:00] begins to break away the stocks and the
[45:02] bonds I know good Christian people amen
[45:05] that are under problems right now it's
[45:07] like a prison house to them but I don't
[45:09] care what kind of problem you're in you
[45:12] can sing you can sing and you can
[45:16] praise you can praise God anyhow I tell
[45:19] you what we ought to do this morning we
[45:20] are to take a moment and thank God we
[45:22] are to thank him for the beautiful place
[45:25] for the hour for the days we are to
[45:27] thank him for our families we are to
[45:28] thank him for the Holy Ghost we are to
[45:30] praise him for it amen we're not in that
[45:33] kind of condition but we can praise God
[45:36] [Applause]
[45:37] anyhow and the walls begin to fall and
[45:41] they begin to shake the walls of that
[45:43] prison house I tell you this morning I
[45:45] feel some walls shaking right now I tell
[45:47] you what I tell the devil I give you
[45:49] fair warning devil you better get back
[45:52] cuz your kingdom is coming down when the
[45:54] saints of God begin to work worship God
[45:56] it doesn't matter the condition they're
[45:58] in the praise of God will change the
[46:03] situation and it'll open doors where
[46:06] there is no
[46:08] [Applause]
[46:10] doors was dark down
[46:14] there brother Noah it was dark in that
[46:17] room and they were Chained and they were
[46:21] barred but you can't bar a man from his
[46:24] praise
[46:28] Jonah was in the belly of a well Brother
[46:30] David he could still praise
[46:35] God when they begin to praise the
[46:38] walls walls started coming down the
[46:40] Walls actually
[46:42] fell and when those walls fail look at
[46:45] what happens this man in
[46:48] darkness he thinks I've lost my
[46:50] prisoners now he's in darkness I've lost
[46:53] the prisoners I can't
[46:56] there's nothing I can do yeah out of the
[47:01] darkness soldja
[47:04] boy you w't take your
[47:07] life sir out of the darkness so boy
[47:12] Hallelujah you won't take your
[47:17] life you see that you may be in the
[47:19] darkest hour but Paul was not subject to
[47:22] the darkness Paul was not subject to the
[47:26] fear of that Roman Jailer he was a free
[47:28] man no matter how much bonds he was in
[47:30] no matter how dark it was he was living
[47:32] in light and I'll tell you this a real
[47:35] Son of God you can put him in the worst
[47:37] conditions you can put him in the worst
[47:38] trouble but he's never subject to
[47:41] it I know what I'm talking about when
[47:44] you preach the gospel you can't be
[47:46] subject to the problems that's going
[47:48] on I know what I'm talking about you get
[47:51] people in great troubles in their homes
[47:52] and in their families and if we get
[47:54] subject to it you have no
[47:57] hopes amen but we don't get subject to
[48:00] it we stand in a position of knowing
[48:02] that if God gets in the situation walls
[48:05] are going to
[48:07] fall bars are going to
[48:09] [Music]
[48:15] break we're all here no worry don't
[48:18] worry don't don't don't take your life
[48:20] it's it'll be okay don't kill
[48:24] yourself and Paul calls for
[48:27] light now it was
[48:31] midnight I don't have time preach these
[48:33] subjects do it was
[48:36] midnight but there was
[48:41] light and that light brought
[48:44] something in the darkest hour light
[48:47] brought
[48:51] instruction can you imagine brother Bram
[48:54] said it like this he said how did he he
[48:55] know them men could help
[48:58] him that's that's getting powerful now
[49:02] they're beaten they're look like common
[49:04] prisoners yeah but he believed they
[49:07] could help him yeah wow brother M said
[49:10] it was something with their
[49:11] testimony in their singing and they're
[49:14] talking about the
[49:15] word that made him believe they were
[49:18] spiritual people no matter the condition
[49:21] they were in
[49:23] physically brother BR said it was
[49:25] because they were so faithful to God in
[49:28] such a condition he said and God is not
[49:31] a respector of person and if you're
[49:34] faithful in your position he said the
[49:36] same God that was there for them is here
[49:38] for
[49:40] you look what he said to them he said to
[49:43] them amen what can I do brother R said
[49:45] there's your testimony right there that
[49:48] they ask him how to get
[49:50] saved their testimony was having
[49:53] influence now here's the thing brother
[49:55] has when their testimony has an
[49:57] influence we don't know how powerful our
[49:59] testimonies are you really you really
[50:01] don't know many people don't understand
[50:03] the depth or the power of their own
[50:05] testimony but your testimony is powerful
[50:08] and and let me just take the Old
[50:09] Testament can I amen when in the book of
[50:11] Kings there was a little girl from
[50:13] Israel taken captive by non in the
[50:15] Syrian Army and he took her back to his
[50:18] house amen and the Bible said it was a
[50:20] leper and she went to the mistress and
[50:23] said if my if my Lord could go down to
[50:26] my
[50:28] country he could be healed of that
[50:31] leprosy now if you're a Bible reader go
[50:33] to the Book of Luke the fourth chapter
[50:35] Jesus himself said though no leper was
[50:39] healed in the Days of Elijah other than
[50:41] nonon the
[50:42] Syrian she had not one instance to tell
[50:47] them non hey man this person was healed
[50:50] of leprosy or this person she just knew
[50:53] the God I'm serving can do do anything
[50:56] if you can believe it and her testimony
[50:59] influenced the man and he got his
[51:01] healing from her testimony do you know
[51:04] amen I know that we that we uh that we
[51:06] don't believe in women preachers but we
[51:07] certainly believe in women
[51:09] testimonies cuz you know it was a woman
[51:11] that won the whole city of Saar in the
[51:13] Bible amen a woman standing by the well
[51:17] when Jesus approached under her and let
[51:19] me just say this she was a harlot by
[51:21] amen she was a harlot that's what she
[51:23] did she was a loose woman she was a no
[51:26] good woman matter of fact her morals
[51:27] were worse than every person probably in
[51:30] the
[51:31] city and the reason she was at the well
[51:34] at the time she was at the well cuz she
[51:36] couldn't come with the virgins amen but
[51:38] Jesus said I have a need to go down to
[51:41] Samaria and because there was a seed in
[51:43] that woman she was more righteous than
[51:46] all of the Pharisees were
[51:50] righteous now look what happened when
[51:52] Jesus walked up to her amen he could
[51:54] have just been a common man race got
[51:56] into trouble right quite quick race and
[51:58] religion entered right in conversation
[52:00] bring me a drink she said it's not right
[52:01] for you to ask me a
[52:03] drink we're of two different
[52:06] races and he said well our fathers
[52:08] worshiped in this mountain so they start
[52:10] talking about worship and Jesus said
[52:12] well hey man my father seeks such a
[52:14] worship in spirit and truth and she said
[52:15] well when the Messiah comes you know
[52:17] he's going to set up worship
[52:20] yeah she looks over at him and he said
[52:23] well bring me a drink she said she said
[52:25] you don't have nothing to draw from he
[52:26] said if you knew who I was you'd ask me
[52:28] for a
[52:32] drink if you knew who that was You' ask
[52:35] for the drink now watch what happens and
[52:38] then he tells you go get your husband
[52:40] remember the story go get your husband
[52:42] she said I don't have one said well you
[52:45] true you're speaking truth you had five
[52:47] the one you're living with right now is
[52:48] not
[52:50] yours isn't that
[52:53] something but the the seventh one has
[52:56] just
[52:59] arrived and look at what he does he
[53:02] unveils her secret sin which she as a
[53:05] harlot recognizes immediately he's the
[53:11] Messiah sir I perceive thou art a
[53:14] prophet he
[53:16] says now she says there was a prophet
[53:19] and the Messiah cometh when he comes
[53:20] he'll tell us these things she said he
[53:23] says I'm he
[53:26] woo now the Bible said she ran into the
[53:29] City and many believed because of her
[53:33] testimony a woman without any influence
[53:36] at all had influence because she had
[53:38] been influenced under the gift that God
[53:40] had promised to be send into that
[53:44] age now I think it's a reality church I
[53:48] think it's a reality that Jesus stood
[53:51] here in Matthew the 12th chapter and he
[53:53] says it very clearly
[53:56] and he says as Jonah was three days in
[53:58] the belly of the well he said there will
[54:00] be no sign given except for the sign of
[54:03] Resurrection in the in the last days he
[54:05] said as Queen of the Queen of Sheba he
[54:08] said she'll rise up in judgment against
[54:10] this wicked and adulterous
[54:12] generation now now the scriptures takes
[54:15] two people Jonah and takes Queen of
[54:18] Sheba do you know both of them come in
[54:20] contact with that Messiah
[54:23] sign now I'm not off my subject both of
[54:27] them come in contact with that Messiah
[54:30] sign those were changed by the Messiah
[54:34] sign Queen of Sheba was changed by by
[54:38] the interview that she spoke unto
[54:41] Solomon the Church of the Living God in
[54:44] the last days here's the same sign that
[54:48] the queen of Shea heard what she would
[54:50] have heard one time we have heard
[54:53] thousands of times and watch the prophet
[54:56] say it and if the Queen of Sheba would
[54:58] judge the generation that Jesus was
[55:03] in what about this generation when the
[55:07] prophet says he does more of that in one
[55:09] meeting than he done in the entire Bible
[55:12] that you're
[55:14] reading Jesus said it very clearly he
[55:16] said a greater than Solomon is
[55:19] here a greater than Solomon's here you
[55:21] said what does that mean amen he said he
[55:24] was a glorified Jesus now he says what
[55:27] it is it's the Holy Ghost that's here
[55:29] now and watch this here Paul is in that
[55:32] dark place and the creator of Heaven and
[55:35] Earth was in there with him amen he was
[55:38] in a jail but God was in the jail amen
[55:41] he was in bonds but God was in bonds and
[55:44] when he began to worship God began to
[55:46] take down the walls and he reached out
[55:48] and said thy and thine house shall be
[55:51] saved now to understand thy house you
[55:54] know it's not it's not your home it's
[55:56] not your home it's not your house
[55:58] brother BR said go right back to job and
[56:01] look at what job did when the Bible said
[56:03] he lost seven
[56:04] children job offered blood for his
[56:08] children before they died how many knows
[56:11] that the Bible said he offered pre-
[56:13] adventuring that something would happen
[56:15] brother B says watch job met
[56:18] righteousness by the sacrifice of that
[56:20] blood he said but you and I today are
[56:22] not asked to sacrifice a lamb for our
[56:25] children he said but according to the
[56:27] scripture that if we believe it will be
[56:30] imputed unto us for
[56:32] righteousness righteousness in this age
[56:35] is our faith in the word of God to think
[56:38] this morning we've been given an
[56:39] opportunity to stand there where that
[56:42] Roman soldier stood when he heard Paul
[56:44] say believe in thy and thine house shall
[56:47] be saved the testimony that they have
[56:49] believe and thy and thine house shall be
[56:53] saved and they they heard the word and
[56:57] were changed I could go back here and
[56:59] and and find brother brandham saying
[57:01] some very powerful things he says now
[57:04] here's the thing if you drop back to job
[57:06] you can see that job lost it
[57:08] all but then God turned it around and
[57:11] gave it back to
[57:14] him he didn't double his children but he
[57:17] gave them to him in
[57:21] heaven
[57:23] oh
[57:28] brother
[57:29] Kevin he gave them in
[57:32] heaven brother B said see he doubles
[57:36] everything but he gave this to them in
[57:39] heaven with eternal
[57:42] life now I know I know that has to that
[57:45] has you you got to you got to you got to
[57:47] have a little maturity on you to swallow
[57:49] that it's not going to be for a baby
[57:53] now position in church positioning under
[57:57] a prophet positioning setting in a place
[58:00] where the law says if you can believe it
[58:02] it's possible setting in the place amen
[58:05] knowing that whatever you can get under
[58:07] the token God will give you the same as
[58:09] job offered the righteousness we have
[58:11] offered our faith and the destruction of
[58:14] this world cannot change what God has
[58:16] gave us I'll give you direct instruction
[58:19] if you got an unsaved child lay the
[58:21] token right on top and say the Lord God
[58:23] I claim him
[58:25] yes and you stay right there if you got
[58:27] a mother or a loved one that's lost lay
[58:30] the token on them and say Lord God I
[58:33] claim them come on I believe it's good
[58:37] for right now I don't believe I believe
[58:39] right here in this atmosphere right now
[58:41] amen do you are to say Lord God I claim
[58:44] them in the name of Jesus and I know
[58:46] what the devil's doing the devil's
[58:48] trying to turn everything to look this
[58:50] way or look that way but God who is rich
[58:53] in Mercy told the truth truth concerning
[58:55] these things and gave us an example in
[58:57] the age we're living in we're not living
[59:00] we're not living here today amen as a
[59:02] bunch of ha Heretics we're not standing
[59:04] here with a bunch of fairy tales and
[59:06] ideas we have faced the reality of these
[59:09] quotes in our own
[59:11] lives come on it's right on tape amen
[59:14] it's right on tape brother Bram speaking
[59:16] squirrels the third poll now we're
[59:19] talking about positioned people Mountain
[59:22] Moving Faith speak the word and move
[59:24] forward Prophet is squirrel hunting and
[59:27] uses the commission of Mark 11 and Mark
[59:30] 9 says if you can ask anything and
[59:32] believe it it's possible Mark 11 says
[59:35] you can speak it and it'll happen and a
[59:38] prophet standing there under that
[59:39] anointing created
[59:42] [Music]
[59:43] squirrels I know it's not for everybody
[59:46] but to the believer it's a powerful
[59:48] reality that the spoken word can create
[59:51] something that ain't even
[59:53] there come on that creation story was
[59:57] taken to hady Wright's house listen
[1:00:01] folks it was only a story until she
[1:00:04] believed it it was only a story but when
[1:00:08] her little heart said that's the truth
[1:00:10] brother brandham something quickened on
[1:00:13] the inside of her and she moved from a
[1:00:15] fairy tale to a reality knowing the same
[1:00:18] faith that created squirrels that saved
[1:00:22] her soul could get a hold of her
[1:00:24] children
[1:00:30] what she did that day was she said
[1:00:33] sister Courtney she said that ain't
[1:00:34] nothing but the
[1:00:35] truth because you know what she did she
[1:00:37] did ask a question and asking questions
[1:00:39] are not wrong it's according to how you
[1:00:42] ask it because she did ask brother
[1:00:44] brandom you created that squirel brother
[1:00:46] BR said H what happened out there and he
[1:00:49] said Haddie I can't tell you other than
[1:00:51] he's the same Jehovah jyra that created
[1:00:54] the realm in the wilderness for Abraham
[1:00:57] and he created that squirrel for me and
[1:00:59] she agreed that's true because it was
[1:01:02] Abraham seed and we were heir to the
[1:01:05] same promises and when she said it's
[1:01:07] nothing but the truth brother randam
[1:01:09] that turned right toward her woo can you
[1:01:13] imagine when it turns towards you and
[1:01:16] your life and your heart you're just
[1:01:18] setting in a meeting Amen in the word of
[1:01:20] God but all of a sudden the anointing
[1:01:22] turned on you and it's speaking right to
[1:01:25] you and it's saying brother Mark God
[1:01:27] hears your prayer and the anointing
[1:01:29] turns and when it turns God can move
[1:01:32] heavens and earth but he can't fail with
[1:01:34] that
[1:01:37] word look had your R standing there
[1:01:40] nothing but the truth somebody said well
[1:01:41] is that scriptural brother brother Wayne
[1:01:43] of course it's scriptural the first
[1:01:46] Gentile that ever had a miracle in the
[1:01:48] Bible was a woman with a sick baby and
[1:01:51] she came to Jesus and Jesus wouldn't
[1:01:53] talk to her because she was trying to
[1:01:56] approach him in a certain word that
[1:01:59] didn't belong to her
[1:02:02] position she came to him as a son of
[1:02:05] David wrong position
[1:02:08] lady all power in Heaven and Earth was
[1:02:11] standing right there the Son of God was
[1:02:13] right there everything was right there
[1:02:16] but she had to switch
[1:02:20] positions and the moment she switched
[1:02:22] positions she said to him Lord Lord that
[1:02:26] did
[1:02:27] it Lord amen when she called him Lord
[1:02:31] she got his attention because that's
[1:02:33] what he is to this Gentile Church he's
[1:02:35] not the son of David he's your Lord he's
[1:02:37] your husband man he's the king of kings
[1:02:40] but he's not the son of David to the
[1:02:42] church he's the son of man and when she
[1:02:45] recognized her her Authority come under
[1:02:48] the son of man dispensation she began to
[1:02:52] agree with him and he even looked at and
[1:02:54] now this is hard and he even looked at
[1:02:56] her amen and he says to her he says look
[1:03:00] I know you want healing but it's the
[1:03:01] children's
[1:03:02] bread and you Gentiles are just a bunch
[1:03:05] of dogs let me just put it plain
[1:03:06] language you're just a bunch of dogs and
[1:03:08] this belongs to the
[1:03:10] Jews and she didn't get aggravated and
[1:03:13] stomp out she switched her
[1:03:17] position and she said Lord but even the
[1:03:20] dogs could get the crumbs from the
[1:03:22] master's table and when she took that
[1:03:25] position with
[1:03:27] him Hallelujah change come over their
[1:03:31] lives change come into their hearts when
[1:03:33] you get in the right position with
[1:03:36] God hallelujah all things are
[1:03:40] possible and you know what you know the
[1:03:42] rest of the story you know the rest of
[1:03:44] the story he said because of this saying
[1:03:46] lady brother BR said there's the first
[1:03:48] miracle ever done in a gentile and it
[1:03:51] was because of this saying and because
[1:03:53] of your saying Haddie
[1:03:55] yeah and because of your agreement with
[1:03:57] the word of
[1:04:00] God listen hady didn't have a prayer
[1:04:02] meeting that morning church she believed
[1:04:05] the message she was hearing and God
[1:04:08] quickened faith and Faith got a hold of
[1:04:10] her family and everything was
[1:04:17] changed said well that's just one time
[1:04:19] it wasn't actually there was a Dalton
[1:04:21] family from Kentucky Jim had Dalton
[1:04:23] friend of mine from flagst Pastor a
[1:04:24] while his dad Ed Dalton they were down I
[1:04:27] think they were actually men andite
[1:04:28] wasn't they originally it was some kind
[1:04:30] of a cultish Amish menite something
[1:04:33] another cuz when they left uh they
[1:04:36] blocked them you know you know what they
[1:04:37] call it they kick them out they shunned
[1:04:40] them yeah they shunned him and when they
[1:04:42] done that he lost his business pretty
[1:04:44] much so he sold all of his equipment and
[1:04:47] then turned around and bought himself a
[1:04:48] bunch of trucks and brother Jim said he
[1:04:50] wrecked every truck they wrecked every
[1:04:52] truck he said finally he drove the last
[1:04:55] one himself and he said Dad wrecked it
[1:04:56] himself he said he was setting it
[1:04:58] bankrupt cuz they back then they just
[1:05:00] bought the stuff themselves you know so
[1:05:02] he went he said he went on the platform
[1:05:04] he's going to brother bram's meetings
[1:05:05] he's standing on the platform he said
[1:05:07] brother Bram was standing there and
[1:05:08] there's a woman in front of him this is
[1:05:10] from Brother Dalton's testimony he said
[1:05:12] the woman's in front of him and he was
[1:05:13] sitting there in his heart saying Lord I
[1:05:15] got a house full of unsaved kids but I'm
[1:05:18] at bankruptcy and my family I'm at
[1:05:19] bankruptcy I don't know what I'm going
[1:05:21] to do I need this finances and he said
[1:05:23] he was standing there wondering what he
[1:05:25] was going to say when he got in the
[1:05:26] prayer line he said and when he stepped
[1:05:29] up he said instead of questioning he
[1:05:31] said the first thing out of his mouth is
[1:05:32] I'd like to have my
[1:05:34] children he said in the minute when he
[1:05:36] spoke it brother BR said it belongs to
[1:05:38] you and he gave them to him in that
[1:05:41] prayer line so years later I'm
[1:05:42] listenting tapes I didn't even know
[1:05:44] about this one there was a lady out in
[1:05:45] the Phoenix meeting it's in the evening
[1:05:47] meeting and she steps there and she
[1:05:49] starts uh in the prayer line and brother
[1:05:51] BR says oh I see why you're really here
[1:05:53] now'
[1:05:54] he said 'you sick he said' but you got
[1:05:56] an unsaved husband unsaved daughter and
[1:05:58] they're home right now he said but in
[1:06:00] the name of Jesus Christ I give them to
[1:06:03] you you call in in the next service
[1:06:07] brother Bram comes along and he said I
[1:06:08] was listening back over the prayerline
[1:06:10] last night how many of y'all heard the
[1:06:12] angel of the Lord give that woman her
[1:06:14] her
[1:06:15] people I read that out there in Oregon
[1:06:18] one time in a meeting stoval is the name
[1:06:20] stoval and I was spelling the stoval
[1:06:23] amen and after I got done with the
[1:06:24] meeting Brother Ray a lady met me on the
[1:06:25] outside there in Oregon and she said God
[1:06:28] bless you brother Lawson she said I'm
[1:06:30] the little girl in the prayerline you
[1:06:32] were talking about said me and my dad
[1:06:35] were saved in those meetings said see
[1:06:37] there's a reality to this message
[1:06:40] there's a reality to these things these
[1:06:42] are not just little mths floating around
[1:06:44] but there's reality in this there's a
[1:06:47] truth behind this listen all the devils
[1:06:50] in hell will never stop the faith I'm a
[1:06:53] Believer once he gets gets a hold of God
[1:06:55] and says it belongs to
[1:06:58] me I was in a meeting down at Tim PR
[1:07:01] back maybe five six years ago a little
[1:07:03] girl come up in the prayer line a young
[1:07:06] a wear girl and she said brother Wayne
[1:07:08] said my my brother is at home he's in
[1:07:10] bad shape and I'm asking prayer for him
[1:07:13] and I prayed for him that night brother
[1:07:14] Tim and I in the in the prayer meetings
[1:07:16] on a Wednesday
[1:07:17] night that little girl walked off it was
[1:07:20] early in the evening brother Tim had
[1:07:22] called a Deliverance she's still on tape
[1:07:24] they called the Deliverance line the
[1:07:26] entire line just kept coming kept coming
[1:07:31] and I spoke about the 11th Hour people
[1:07:33] getting the 11th Hour promises and I was
[1:07:36] talking about that 11th Hour well while
[1:07:37] I was standing that prayer line it just
[1:07:39] got longer and longer and longer and
[1:07:40] longer and longer and after a while I
[1:07:41] thought these poor people that come in
[1:07:43] here at 9:00 they got a different
[1:07:46] preacher than the ones that came in at
[1:07:47] 11:00 as you start getting weary in your
[1:07:50] body you know and I was getting weary
[1:07:52] and I was getting tired and I was saying
[1:07:54] Lord don't don't let me do this don't
[1:07:56] let my body fail me Lord and and the and
[1:07:58] the Lord spoke to my heart and he says
[1:08:01] didn't you say the 11th Hour that the
[1:08:03] people in the end will get the same
[1:08:05] thing as those in the beginning and I
[1:08:07] said yes sir Lord and when I said that
[1:08:09] Holy Spirit just pick right up just like
[1:08:10] it was the front of the prayer line and
[1:08:12] about that time brother Tim Taps me on
[1:08:14] the shoulder he said look right over
[1:08:15] there and I look and there's a young man
[1:08:17] standing there brother we and couple of
[1:08:20] the people was standing around him and
[1:08:21] he was in I don't it seemed like he was
[1:08:24] in pajamas maybe it's probably on tape
[1:08:26] but he he definitely was in some kind of
[1:08:27] bed clothes just shorts or I mean
[1:08:30] jogging pants and a shirt or something
[1:08:32] and he had that bed head I don't think
[1:08:33] it's normal wear but it was all messed
[1:08:37] up kind of like mine probably right now
[1:08:41] but he was standing right there and I
[1:08:42] look over at him and and uh and brother
[1:08:45] Tim says brother Wayne that's the young
[1:08:47] man that we were praying for just a
[1:08:50] little while
[1:08:51] ago that young man was at home
[1:08:54] and when and when we were praying the
[1:08:56] Holy Spirit woke that boy up and he it
[1:08:59] the meeting kept going later and later
[1:09:01] and he got to WAN he got to wanting to
[1:09:03] go home so so he wondered why is mom not
[1:09:05] home why is Dad not home why is the
[1:09:07] family not home so he so he he looks out
[1:09:10] and some of the neighbors go to church
[1:09:11] they're not home well the first thing
[1:09:14] comes to his mind I've missed the
[1:09:16] Rapture I've missed the Rapture so he
[1:09:19] jumps in his truck and goes barreling
[1:09:21] and I think they said he wiped out a
[1:09:23] vence and knocked out his transmission
[1:09:26] he he he he pulled up to the front front
[1:09:28] that when he parked his truck in front
[1:09:30] of the church it never moved again they
[1:09:32] had to tow it
[1:09:33] off he run through fences and up
[1:09:36] pastures and I mean it was a reality to
[1:09:39] him I've missed this thing and he comes
[1:09:42] running in the back door of the church
[1:09:43] and he looks and they're still having
[1:09:45] church at whatever time 11:30 at night
[1:09:47] and he looks in there and when he
[1:09:49] realizes there's time for me brother he
[1:09:52] come running down that all alar and gave
[1:09:54] his life listen amen that little girl
[1:09:57] prayed the prayer and it wasn't an hour
[1:09:59] later that boy was in an altar because

[1:15:41] picture the other day was it about 29 or
[1:15:47] 30 from
[1:15:52] faith
[1:15:54] said brother L you're crazy no I got
[1:16:00] children if you ain't got them yet you
[1:16:02] you
[1:16:03] wait but when something drops into your
[1:16:07] heart and the Lord said I've given them
[1:16:09] to
[1:16:13] you brother then all the demons in hell
[1:16:17] they got to stop right
[1:16:20] there
[1:16:22] faith
[1:16:23] do you know do you know that it was
[1:16:26] $20 that brother Braham had for Hatty
[1:16:29] rright many ever hear
[1:16:32] it $20 she had give $40 to the building
[1:16:36] fund and brother Neville saw her do it
[1:16:39] so he gave her 20
[1:16:42] back brother Bram say she lived on $200
[1:16:44] a
[1:16:45] year that was a lot of
[1:16:49] money she had brother Bram said when I
[1:16:51] went down there squirrel hunting I had
[1:16:52] the the extra 20 in my pocket to give
[1:16:56] her
[1:16:57] back and he said and when I went to do
[1:16:59] it he said the Holy Spirit spoke to me
[1:17:01] and said no I have something greater for
[1:17:08] her I I don't want y'all to think I'm
[1:17:10] crazy but in our in our youth camp the
[1:17:14] other day during that prayer line some
[1:17:16] of you young ladies were working in that
[1:17:18] prayer line and God bless you he'll
[1:17:20] bless you greatly for what you've done
[1:17:22] amen
[1:17:24] but I hope this is
[1:17:27] okay but sometimes when you're a player
[1:17:29] line it's the oddest thing something
[1:17:31] somebody something will speak to you and
[1:17:32] you just you don't even know why but it
[1:17:35] just comes to you and we were sitting
[1:17:37] there praying for those people and I
[1:17:38] seen those little girls and some of them
[1:17:41] were going out under the anointing and
[1:17:42] they were rejoicing and and I looked up
[1:17:45] and just as the anointing just was
[1:17:47] coming by and I looked up and Sister
[1:17:49] Elma was coming through and she was
[1:17:51] helping them but she was dancing in
[1:17:53] while she was doing it and it just it
[1:17:56] just touched my heart I just just in
[1:17:58] that moment it just something inside my
[1:18:00] heart it just I think it was the Lord
[1:18:03] and when I looked at her I said Lord I'd
[1:18:05] like to do a little something for her
[1:18:06] when this is over maybe just maybe you
[1:18:09] you put something on her heart just do a
[1:18:10] little special something for being an
[1:18:12] Elma and when I said
[1:18:15] that immediately he spoke back to me he
[1:18:19] said I had something greater than that
[1:18:21] for her thank you Lord and about three
[1:18:25] steps that one stepped in the prayer
