[4:37] enemy amen amen that's powerful isn't it
[4:41] amen that Revelation is one of them that
[4:44] uh puts you in a different sphere amen
[4:47] amen fighting a defeated enemy amen
[4:51] Ephesians chapter 2 and I want to read
[4:54] six verses here Ephesians chapter 2
[4:56] veres 1-6 and amen um
[5:00] Ephesians chap 2 verse
[5:04] 1-6 and you hath he
[5:07] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[5:11] and
[5:12] sin wherein time passed you walked
[5:15] according to the course of the world
[5:18] according to the prince of the power of
[5:20] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[5:24] the children of
[5:26] Disobedience now among whom also we had
[5:29] our conversation in times past and the
[5:31] lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires
[5:34] of the Flesh and of the mind and were by
[5:37] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[5:40] others I like that don't you by Nature
[5:43] not by seed amen not not by seed but by
[5:47] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[5:50] others now but God somebody say but God
[5:55] who is rich in Mercy for his great loved
[5:59] we with he loved us even when we were
[6:02] dead in sins hath quickened us together
[6:05] with Christ Now by Grace you're saved
[6:09] and he hath raised us up together and
[6:12] made us sit together in Heavenly places
[6:15] in Christ Jesus we ask the Lord to bless
[6:18] his word as you can be seated this
[6:19] morning amen I'm uh going to continue of
[6:22] course in the book of Ephesians I have a
[6:24] few more things I want to bring from
[6:26] this but uh this morning amen uh I I
[6:30] want to speak a little bit here to you
[6:32] from just a subject and just I'll take a
[6:34] title to kind of give you my topic here
[6:36] but uh I want to talk to you about
[6:38] quickened by his quickening power
[6:41] quickened by quickening power uh I think
[6:44] it's a powerful thing uh when you see it
[6:47] in the scripture and that sometimes I
[6:49] get to think and I I talk a lot about
[6:51] quickening power and brother Ray talks a
[6:53] lot about quicking power and the other
[6:54] brothers talk a lot about quicking power
[6:56] but if you're studying scripture there's
[6:58] a lot in here about quickening power
[7:00] amen because it is a uh it is a theme
[7:03] subject for the church amen about
[7:06] quickening power because that's exactly
[7:09] what it is that God uses to awaken the
[7:11] church is quickening power now uh if
[7:14] you're uh if you'd like to study this
[7:16] the messages uh there's three sermons
[7:18] that we're going to be looking through
[7:20] some of these points uh it is the rising
[7:22] of the sun uh it is the Easter seal in
[7:25] 65 and also uh the sermon God rich and
[7:29] mercy and brother BR specifically takes
[7:31] these scriptures and God rich and mercy
[7:34] and specifically talks about Ephesians
[7:37] chapter 2 and verse one down through so
[7:39] you can get a real a real concept of
[7:41] where brother Bram took this and what he
[7:43] believed and of course we we recognize
[7:46] that it does us no good just as
[7:49] something as a history lesson but when
[7:51] we start seeing the events of our day
[7:53] transpiring then it becomes a different
[7:56] kind of reality amen and uh I I I think
[7:59] it's amazing because brother bradam
[8:00] begins God rich in Mercy when he reads
[8:03] this Ephesians chapter 2 he begins with
[8:05] something he says here now what caused
[8:07] this change he says now what caused this
[8:10] change you who he hath quickened were
[8:13] dead in sins and trespasses and I I I
[8:16] thought it's amazing because you asked
[8:17] yourself what kind of change is it that
[8:20] Paul's talking about and if you read uh
[8:23] this actual scripture Paul is discussing
[8:26] what it what we were and what we have be
[8:29] come and what was it that caused this
[8:32] and brother bam brings this point out
[8:34] amen that what caused the change what
[8:37] caused this from one time you were dead
[8:41] but Quicken means to make alive so there
[8:44] was a change one time you were dead now
[8:48] you all could go back in your memories
[8:50] and remember when you were dead but
[8:52] you're not dead this morning amen so
[8:55] that caused the change brother B said
[8:57] there was a change from Death To Life
[8:59] now there is no other thing he says that
[9:02] could happen to any person so great as
[9:04] to change from Death To Life a man if he
[9:07] was dying physically could be healed
[9:10] physically and that would be a great
[9:11] thing but nothing so great as when he is
[9:15] spiritually dead and God has quickened
[9:18] him to life amen what that change amen
[9:21] means that you were one time dead amen
[9:25] now that that's something you were dead
[9:27] now but you can look back and know know
[9:29] that you were dead but now why aren't
[9:32] you dead tonight now you have to ask
[9:34] yourself now we were but why aren't we
[9:37] this morning why are we alive this
[9:39] morning well the brother Ram tells it
[9:42] very powerful because God made the
[9:44] change amen because God made the change
[9:47] now we didn't deserve it we were dead
[9:50] but God who is rich in Mercy made a
[9:52] change in our lives that we couldn't
[9:55] make and I always think it's about
[9:57] something like you think about a man
[9:58] who's out in the graveyard now he has no
[10:01] ability to wake himself up somebody has
[10:04] to resurrect him and you think about you
[10:06] and I in the positions that we were in
[10:09] our life we had no hope and we were
[10:12] without God and we had no way to awaken
[10:14] ourselves and we would only be in a
[10:17] grave this morning of death and of sin
[10:20] but yet God who is rich in Mercy came to
[10:24] our lives and showed Mercy To Us by
[10:27] awaking us out of that day death and
[10:29] that deadness now if somebody's dead and
[10:31] see this morning don't feel bad at them
[10:34] don't don't think don't don't don't
[10:36] think bad of people because they're not
[10:38] where you are in life it's just when you
[10:40] see someone that's way drifting in sin
[10:42] and they're dead to the things of God
[10:44] stop and take a moment and realize you
[10:47] deserve the same thing but God who is
[10:50] rich in Mercy has given you Mercy when
[10:53] you didn't desire it and you didn't
[10:55] deserve it and you were running your own
[10:57] way but God who is rich in Mercy we have
[11:01] nothing to brag on ourselves this
[11:04] morning we can only say with Apostle
[11:06] Paul but it was God who was rich in
[11:09] Mercy you Paul if there's anybody could
[11:12] say it Paul could say it he was a dead
[11:14] Theologian he was a dead Pharisee he was
[11:17] a Pharisee of Pharisee he said above
[11:20] above all he said I was a Pharisee of pH
[11:22] law he said I was blameless but in faith
[11:25] the man was dead he was so dead he was
[11:28] persec in Jesus Christ but when he met
[11:31] that angel of the Lord on the road and
[11:34] he said he spoke unto Jesus he was
[11:36] changed from the dead man to a man that
[11:38] could write the scriptures because the
[11:41] quickening power of Jesus Christ made
[11:43] him alive to the realities of almighty
[11:46] God now I think it's a powerful thing
[11:49] that's what made the change right there
[11:51] God rich in Mercy now here's the thing
[11:55] God doesn't change so whatever he done
[11:57] for you and whatever he done for me he
[12:00] will do for someone else because he's
[12:03] God rich in Mercy amen so so what
[12:05] happened to you God rich in Mercy what
[12:09] happened in your life it was God rich in
[12:11] Mercy and that's all we can say we can't
[12:14] say big ey or little you or or we we
[12:17] can't say any of that we just have to
[12:19] say God is rich in his Mercy amen that's
[12:22] what happened to you and I God who is
[12:25] rich in Mercy now God rich in Mercy
[12:27] brother bam is preaching this sermon and
[12:29] and I love how he does things because of
[12:31] course he wasn't at his own church so he
[12:33] said I'm going to inject a little
[12:35] Doctrine in here and I thought now when
[12:38] brother Bram said I'm going to inject a
[12:39] little Doctrine I want to hear what he's
[12:41] considering Doctrine what what was he
[12:44] teaching that others didn't believe that
[12:46] he was concerned in saying it from
[12:49] someone else's platform but he felt it
[12:51] was so necessary to say it he says see
[12:54] injecting Doctrine he says now if you
[12:56] don't believe it it's all right amen
[12:58] he's a gentleman wasn't he i i i i i
[13:01] when the man was born in a world and
[13:03] when you were a little baby born into
[13:05] the world you could not have been here
[13:08] without being the forn knowledge of God
[13:10] because he is infinite and he knows all
[13:13] things and when that little baby is born
[13:16] into the world there is something in
[13:19] that baby if it's ever going to have
[13:22] life there is something in there in the
[13:25] child when he comes to sooner or later
[13:28] that little seed is in him now if you'll
[13:31] take it the scriptures plainly declare
[13:33] it I thought isn't that something
[13:35] brother man takes your experience as a
[13:38] Believer not to the time you come to the
[13:40] altar he takes your experience as a
[13:43] Believer back before the foundation of
[13:45] the world and when you were born into
[13:47] the Earth God deposited something in you
[13:51] amen that's not in every person in the
[13:53] world Amen it's just not in every human
[13:56] doesn't have that in them but God who is
[14:00] rich in Mercy deposited an eternal germ
[14:03] life inside of you when you were even
[14:07] unaware that you had a mama or a daddy
[14:10] or you couldn't feed yourself you
[14:12] couldn't bathe yourself you could look
[14:14] at the grace of God folks this this
[14:16] wasn't something that you grew up and
[14:18] found God and you did and and this all
[14:21] this thing and I could tell you how
[14:22] wonderful I was and amen look look at
[14:25] God putting this in a baby when he was
[14:28] born how many realize when brother Adam
[14:29] came to the Earth within just a couple
[14:31] minutes of his birth the angel of the
[14:33] Lord settled over the bed where he was
[14:35] born he wasn't he wasn't doing anything
[14:38] yet amen but God had for dained that
[14:41] birth and he was testifying my gift lays
[14:44] in this part of the flesh amen I tell
[14:47] you God who is rich in Mercy now now now
[14:50] brother R says now this is a if you're
[14:52] going to later in life you'll see maybe
[14:54] a little more how important this is but
[14:56] there's a lot of Concepts in people
[14:58] believe in things like you know you you
[15:00] when you hear the message you get the
[15:01] seed now they got reasons to say that
[15:04] because brother Bram said the word is a
[15:06] seed right so when you hear the word
[15:08] you're hearing the seed of God and
[15:10] that's a virgin wound so it's deposited
[15:12] in there and Jesus gives the parable in
[15:14] Matthew 13 that's why people teach it
[15:17] for the seed fell in the ground some was
[15:19] Rocky and some had cares and some so
[15:21] some people re they they hear that
[15:23] portion of it but the but if the ground
[15:26] is not prepared to receive that that's a
[15:28] seed right
[15:29] but there's also you as a jean seed
[15:32] which is like Mary she received the word
[15:35] of Isaiah that was a seed but she was a
[15:38] predestinated seed for that word to be
[15:42] born into so both things were
[15:44] predestinated both Jesus and Mary were
[15:47] predestinated and so is the word of this
[15:50] age coming through a prophet there has
[15:53] to be somebody who's going to believe
[15:55] that and you can't no more help that you
[15:58] believe this amen than nothing you can't
[16:00] no more help that you believe this
[16:02] because God who is rich in Mercy put
[16:05] something in your heart to believe it
[16:08] and you believe it in the midst of
[16:09] criticism and you believe it when people
[16:12] are doubting but there's something in
[16:14] you that you can't even explain it maybe
[16:16] you don't even know how to take the
[16:18] scripture and prove what you believe but
[16:20] you believe it anyhow because God who is
[16:23] rich in Mercy deposited something in you
[16:26] when you didn't even know what you were
[16:28] doing so when you come to the altar you
[16:30] don't get a seed now now I think it's
[16:32] powerful that you catch this amen when
[16:34] you come to the altar you don't get a
[16:36] seed the prophet of God said because
[16:38] there is nothing in a nonseed to Quicken
[16:41] but the reason that you came to the
[16:44] altar is because there was a seed in you
[16:47] already amen so it wasn't you coming it
[16:50] was God pulling it was God rich and
[16:53] mercy knowing I have a seed somewhere in
[16:56] this building and he scatters his word
[16:58] and pulls that individual to his own
[17:01] word amen it's it's God if you have
[17:04] eternal life tonight amen now uh if you
[17:08] have eternal life tonight he said then
[17:11] you always were because there's only one
[17:13] form of eternal life and we always were
[17:16] and the reason we were because we are a
[17:18] part of God and Only God is the thing
[17:20] that is
[17:22] eternal now that's a pretty powerful
[17:25] Doctrine you're is eternal as God is
[17:27] eternal because you're seed of God Amen
[17:31] now God rich in Mercy brother B lays
[17:33] these things down very clearly you being
[17:35] a part of God you had to be a part of
[17:36] the word and when you heard the word you
[17:40] knew where you come from that's right
[17:44] isn't that powerful you know where you
[17:46] come from you know it was the truth you
[17:50] always were the seed was always in you
[17:55] the word sing the word that was before
[17:57] the foundation of the world and and that
[17:59] you come to it now brother Bram only he
[18:02] he's I love how brother Bram does things
[18:04] cuz being that he's a bit of a a a
[18:07] simple man he takes it to weed just so
[18:09] the people could hear him gladly and he
[18:11] takes beautiful things like this and and
[18:14] makes a duck story out of it takes us to
[18:16] the farm and and he takes us out there
[18:18] and says there's a little duck one time
[18:20] Amen in God rich and mercy he said there
[18:22] was a little duck there and he said it
[18:23] was born into a chicken yard same as his
[18:26] Eagle story he said a little duck was
[18:28] born is in that and he said that little
[18:30] duck was born there he said but he
[18:32] couldn't understand why he was so odd
[18:35] now he couldn't understand why he wasn't
[18:38] fitting in now you all have felt that
[18:40] same feeling amen why am I so odd amen
[18:44] why is it that I don't just fit in like
[18:46] other situations and other people why
[18:48] don't I just fit in because there was
[18:50] something in you that made you different
[18:53] because God who is rich in Mercy now
[18:55] brother BR said that little duck lived
[18:57] in that chicken yard for a long long
[18:59] time he said to one day he walked around
[19:01] the corner and saw a pond for the first
[19:03] time and when he got a scent of that
[19:05] water he realized there's something
[19:07] different about me amen now if you
[19:10] wanted to keep the duck in the chicken
[19:12] yard you should have never let the duck
[19:14] smell water amen and you find out in
[19:17] this last day amen that if you want to
[19:19] keep a believer in an intellectually dry
[19:21] place you better never let them know
[19:23] there's an availability of the
[19:25] quickening power of God because the
[19:27] first time they really ever get a smell
[19:29] of the moving of the Holy Ghost they'll
[19:31] say this is what I've been missing my
[19:34] whole life and they won't understand it
[19:36] amen but they know that there's
[19:38] something in them that was eternal to
[19:40] begin with and whatever that is moving
[19:43] in the room it it is recognizing on the
[19:46] inside of me something that was there is
[19:49] something that is here now brother Ram
[19:51] said it's the same thing with the
[19:52] believer I remember we had our life and
[19:55] it was pasted and those things of the
[19:56] world but once we got a hold of that
[19:58] real thing something quickened us it was
[20:01] a seed come to life now watch these
[20:04] these things are very powerful when you
[20:07] take them as a reality brother man said
[20:09] the word cannot deny itself think of
[20:11] man's filter what made you desire it in
[20:14] the first place is because down in your
[20:16] soul there is a predestinated seed which
[20:19] was eternal life always laying in there
[20:24] always was in there and all the father
[20:27] hath given me will come unto to me and I
[20:29] will know and wise cast them out look
[20:31] the prophet is teaching something very
[20:33] carefully God is not nervous about
[20:37] you he is teaching us that God laid the
[20:41] seed himself knowing the power of seed
[20:45] he that's the way he created the Earth
[20:47] and that's the way he created his bride
[20:50] now the prophet tells us this in
[20:51] thinking man's filter what is it he said
[20:54] the germ the seed word from the
[20:56] beginning that was in God in the
[20:58] beginning standing there drawing Seed
[21:00] Life the seed is in Your Heart by for
[21:03] ordination the seed is already in there
[21:06] by the for knowledge of God
[21:07] predestinated and when it draws it can't
[21:10] draw nothing else but this word isn't it
[21:13] powerful amen what a wonderful thing
[21:16] Amen to be able to stand here today and
[21:18] say that we're quickened see the word
[21:20] Quicken means to be made alive it means
[21:23] that something is a seed now the farm uh
[21:26] uh the greenhouse folks all know about
[21:28] this amen it's it's it's you could you
[21:30] could have a whole I think you get
[21:31] sprigs mostly but everything that
[21:33] they're selling comes from seed amen and
[21:36] you could you could throw a light Amen
[21:38] on a on a on a whole bed uh of dirt but
[21:42] if there's no seed in the dirt you ain't
[21:45] going to have no crop and you can have
[21:47] the power of God and you can have the
[21:49] baptism of the spirit but if there's
[21:52] nothing in the person it's not going to
[21:55] change them a bit you can have all of
[21:58] God and have no change if there's
[22:00] nothing in the individual to change amen
[22:03] but what we find amen is there is
[22:06] something that caused your change and
[22:09] the devil is constantly trying to make
[22:11] it like up here somewhere you're going
[22:13] to lose what you got and the devil's
[22:15] going to take it from you or something's
[22:17] going to happen and you ain't going to
[22:18] make it but don't you recognize the
[22:20] reason you started it's because God was
[22:23] the one that started that in you he
[22:26] began you with a seed and you was
[22:28] quickened and made alive and I'll say
[22:30] this he that have begun the work is able
[22:33] to finish the work and he knows exactly
[22:36] what it'll take to finish it oh what a
[22:38] wonderful thing it is to be made alive
[22:40] to be quickened from the dead Jesus
[22:43] himself said in Revelation chapter one
[22:45] he says that he was dead but I am alive
[22:48] forever more John you don't have to fear
[22:51] I was dead but now I'm alive amen I
[22:54] think it's powerful and brother bandam
[22:56] thought it was he said to be made alive
[22:59] after death to be made alive after death
[23:02] see what it means is that Jesus himself
[23:05] was quickened and he will send the same
[23:08] life that quickened him he said the
[23:10] power that brought me from the grave I
[23:13] will send it upon you isn't that
[23:15] powerful that Jesus said I was dead but
[23:19] I'm alive and there was something that
[23:21] caused him to be from Death To Life
[23:24] something caused his body that was dead
[23:27] in the Tomb to be Resurrected Ed and the
[23:29] and and the watch now brother R said
[23:31] here's what he's saying and I will send
[23:34] the same power that awakened me I will
[23:37] send it back upon this seed to awaken
[23:40] you amen no wonder in Luke 24 and 49 he
[23:44] said behold I send the promise of my
[23:46] father tearry you and wait in the city
[23:48] of Jerusalem until you be endued from
[23:52] Power upon on high amen so the Holy
[23:55] Ghost is what it was that awoken Jesus
[23:57] Christ because the holy ghost look folks
[24:00] is not emotion the Holy Ghost is not
[24:03] theology the Holy Ghost is God is a
[24:07] person and that person is Elohim and
[24:10] Elohim had a word laid in a tomb and he
[24:14] was saying this is my body so he
[24:16] quickened that body to life to prove the
[24:20] power of the Resurrection in him and
[24:22] then he said whatever it was that woke
[24:24] him I'm going to send it to you now
[24:26] here's the question brother ROM asked in
[24:28] the beginning of this sermon what caused
[24:30] the change amen and whatever caused the
[24:33] change in him is what causes the change
[24:36] in you now I know we've had a had a lot
[24:38] of long years of Theology and Doctrine
[24:41] and everybody's got their own idea what
[24:43] causes change in humanity well let me
[24:45] say this the only thing that'll ever
[24:47] change a human being is the baptism of
[24:50] the Holy Ghost a is the only lasting
[24:53] change that'll ever happen is the seed
[24:55] that is in them must be quickened by the
[24:58] power of God if there is no quickening
[25:00] of that seed there is no changing of
[25:03] that nature but when God quickens a man
[25:06] he quickens him from Death to life again
[25:09] and if God did it for him and he did it
[25:11] for Paul he will do it for you amen it
[25:14] doesn't have to be a special person if
[25:16] the seed is on the inside they might not
[25:19] have social skills they might not have
[25:21] education maybe they got money or they
[25:23] don't have money maybe they got looks or
[25:26] they don't have looks but if they got a
[25:28] SE on the inside of them when the power
[25:30] of the Holy Ghost begins to move there
[25:33] will be a change in that life because
[25:36] the same power that raised Jesus from
[25:39] the dead will also Quicken this Mortal
[25:41] body Romans 8 and chapter uh chapter 8
[25:44] and verse 11 you just want to pull it up
[25:46] we'll read it together Romans 8 and
[25:48] verse 11 amen do you see what it is it's
[25:51] the same Spirit of him that raised up
[25:54] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[25:57] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[25:59] also Quicken here it is this is Paul in
[26:02] Romans and Ephesians using the word
[26:04] quickened your mortal bodies by his
[26:07] spirit that dwelleth in you what is it
[26:09] that causes the change he uses the word
[26:12] quicken in Ephesians 2 and in Romans 8
[26:15] but now he shows you that it was the
[26:18] spirit of God that was the quickening
[26:20] power amen Paul answers the question
[26:23] doesn't he what caused the change he
[26:25] says if the spirit that changed Jesus
[26:28] from Death To Life dwell in you it will
[26:30] also change your bodies or Quicken your
[26:34] mortal bodies and this is the good news
[26:37] folks this is what it was that Jesus
[26:39] sent his disciples to tell the world he
[26:42] T he sent them with good news and I tell
[26:45] you what there's enough bad news is it
[26:47] all right if we preach the good news is
[26:50] it okay if we dedicate TT to Good News
[26:54] this is the place to get good news you
[26:56] can tune in to uh TN n or CNN or Fox
[26:59] News or C all them has news but there's
[27:03] never been news like this news there has
[27:05] never been news like this news that
[27:08] Jesus raised from the dead he said the
[27:11] very gospel itself is to prove to people
[27:14] that he is risen go tell my disciples
[27:16] that I am risen from the dead and I will
[27:18] meet with them to confirm this to them
[27:21] oh God in the last days there'll be a
[27:23] light again on the earth that'll prove
[27:25] to my disciples go tell them that I'm
[27:27] not dead and not a tradition but I am a
[27:29] living Christ and I will meet them do
[27:31] you see the commission on the ministry
[27:33] today is to tell the people of God I
[27:36] know it's been 2,000 years and it's been
[27:38] a gloomy day but in the evening time the
[27:41] same son that quickened those disciples
[27:44] is the same son that'll Quicken this
[27:46] believer in the end time generation
[27:48] listen I'm here to tell you this morning
[27:50] he is not a tradition and you can keep
[27:53] all the Traditions you want but it'll
[27:54] never bring change to your life he is
[27:57] not a Creed you can memorize all the
[28:00] Creeds you want to remember but it'll
[28:02] never change your life he is not a Dogma
[28:05] he is not a church he is a quickening
[28:08] power he is the spirit of Jesus Christ
[28:11] and he will meet you here this morning
[28:14] he promised I will meet you I will meet
[28:16] you in that place I met them because
[28:19] what is it go tell them I'm not dead
[28:21] take my message to the disciples here's
[28:23] the beauty of it it's not my promise so
[28:26] I don't have to make it work I tell you
[28:28] what I'm responsible to do is to preach
[28:29] the gospel come on y'all remember the
[28:32] story of Paul Raider and he said go down
[28:34] there and cut that log and bring it back
[28:36] to the camp he looked at the size of
[28:38] that tree said there's no way I can pack
[28:41] that back to the camp he said then I
[28:43] heard that sweetest voice I ever heard
[28:45] he said Paul there's a river laying next
[28:47] to you and Paul looked at the river and
[28:49] he looked at the log and he had a job to
[28:51] do so he cut down the log and rolled it
[28:55] in the river and got on the log and rode
[28:57] it back to the camp he didn't have to
[29:00] carry it to the camp he rode it into the
[29:02] camp and let me say this morning I don't
[29:04] have to prove this message I'm riding
[29:06] this message I don't have to prove the
[29:08] resurrection I'm riding the resurrection
[29:11] we have took on our White Horse and the
[29:14] sword of the Lord is out of our mouths
[29:16] and I say we are to ride down every
[29:18] enemy of the Gospel of Jesus Christ by
[29:20] the power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[29:23] this is the best news anybody's everever
[29:25] heard in their life he is alive he is
[29:28] not a tradition he is not a church he is
[29:30] not an education he is not shaking hands
[29:33] with a preacher he is a quickening power
[29:36] that will change your existence from
[29:38] Death unto life amen how can it happen
[29:42] listen how if if this is the commission
[29:44] of the church we cannot do it by word
[29:47] only
[29:48] right the gospel came not by word only
[29:51] scripture now he said but power and
[29:53] manifestation of the Holy Spirit to
[29:55] prove it is alive I know people get
[29:58] where they don't like prayer lines and
[29:59] they don't like the moving of the spirit
[30:01] and all that but look folks that's what
[30:03] accompanies the
[30:05] gospel people say well why don't they
[30:06] have it over here why don't I don't know
[30:08] why they don't have it amen other than
[30:10] if you don't water it down it'll produce
[30:12] it right amen I I know sometimes people
[30:15] get excited I've had people say why you
[30:17] get them people all excited well
[30:19] actually it ain't me I'm just preaching
[30:20] the gospel you've noticed me I don't
[30:22] even hardly ask for an amen or I don't
[30:25] make people stand or set or nothing amen
[30:27] we just pre the gospel amen but you got
[30:29] the Liberty to amen or stand or say
[30:31] whatever you want to do it's okay amen
[30:33] but what I mean is there's something
[30:35] else doing that to you it ain't me amen
[30:38] but there's a power that's in this
[30:40] gospel that'll cause people to change
[30:42] their lives it'll stir the heart of a
[30:45] Believer sometimes I know sometimes I'll
[30:47] be sitting over there where Nathan's at
[30:49] right now and and there'll be a word
[30:50] spoken it charges me so much and I
[30:53] almost feel I'm sorry I know as a pastor
[30:55] I should be more dignified but I don't
[30:56] feel very dignified when that anointing
[30:58] starts coming around and all of a sudden
[31:00] I want to just jump up and do a jig and
[31:02] holler Hallelujah why because of the
[31:05] quickening power it ain't got nothing to
[31:07] do with emotion or or somebody seeing me
[31:09] and not seeing me it's the angel of the
[31:11] Lord's using a man's voice and he's
[31:14] speaking directly to my need and I want
[31:16] to know I want him to know I see it I
[31:19] see it's not the man it's the Lord and
[31:21] he's speaking to my heart and he's
[31:23] speaking to my love I'll tell you what
[31:25] it is Amen brother Bram said this gospel
[31:28] El has got power in it manifesting
[31:32] power now the gospel manifest his
[31:37] power there is not another
[31:42] gospel brother BR ties This Together
[31:45] rise of the sun he said I'm surprised so
[31:48] many turn to another kind of gospel yeah
[31:51] which there is no other gospel it's a
[31:53] mate belief it's a denominational
[31:56] fiction it's turning from the good news
[32:01] can you imagine turning from the power
[32:05] and demonstration of almighty God to
[32:07] having a good reading or just have a
[32:10] good lecture
[32:13] or there is not another
[32:17] gospel listen and because I live and I
[32:21] live in you the works that I do shall
[32:24] you doen the works that I will do what a
[32:27] message no one Wonder we've had a dark
[32:29] day of theology but in the evening time
[32:31] there will be a resurrection in the
[32:33] evening time it shall be light in the
[32:37] evening time what is it in the rise of
[32:39] the sun brother Bram said what was it he
[32:41] said see we were living in a darkened
[32:43] world of unbelief now watch he's he's
[32:45] now laid out that the gospel is what
[32:48] Jesus told his disciples so Jesus raises
[32:52] appears to his disciples and sends them
[32:54] out to preach the gospel now brother
[32:57] Bram just divided denominational
[32:59] teaching from the gospel the gospel is a
[33:03] gospel of power manifesting its
[33:06] teachings in the lives of its people
[33:08] that's right he says see but then
[33:10] watched but we were all in a darkened
[33:12] world of
[33:14] unbelief isn't it wow darkened world of
[33:17] unbelief even in a
[33:19] church even in denomination some of you
[33:22] come from denominations you know exactly
[33:24] some of you were in Tradition some was
[33:26] menite we have Amish here we have people
[33:28] were Baptists and some maybe is there
[33:29] any Catholics Among Us that come out of
[33:31] Catholics some Catholics as among and
[33:33] all of them can tell you that they were
[33:35] in a darkened
[33:37] world Amen even though religious there
[33:40] was nothing of light that could get in
[33:43] because amen it blocked out the Master
[33:47] look at this amen it came now watch this
[33:50] because here's the prophet telling us we
[33:51] were in the darkened world he says we
[33:53] were hungering and thirsting and look we
[33:57] joined the
[33:58] Methodist look at their forms we joined
[34:01] the Baptist look at that believe it and
[34:03] you got it nothing to follow it look at
[34:06] this he said We join the Pentecostals
[34:10] isn't that something cuz you'd think for
[34:11] sure CU there noise then they'd be power
[34:13] right amen but brother brand just kills
[34:15] that all together and shows that their
[34:17] noise is a tradition it's not the moving
[34:20] of the spirit I've been there I know I
[34:23] preached I've only been in a couple
[34:24] Pentecostal churches in my life and I
[34:25] preached him one in Arkansas one time
[34:27] and it was like you sitting out in the
[34:29] parking lot and somebody hollered yep
[34:31] woo Glory uh there wasn't nothing in
[34:34] that building I don't mean to make fun
[34:35] of people but it was just a bunch of
[34:37] people H I've been to auctions it was
[34:39] the same
[34:40] atmosphere it's all it was it just
[34:43] somebody hollering and somebody saying
[34:44] get it and somebody go there was no
[34:46] movement there was no power there was
[34:48] nothing behind it it was just a bunch of
[34:50] empty noise like brother BR describe
[34:52] that wagon going across the field
[34:54] there's nothing in it at all amen but
[34:56] people were joining it and their
[34:58] Presbyterians and they were joining it
[35:00] because now I can prove it was just
[35:02] noise and I tell you how I prove it let
[35:04] me preach this word right here in the
[35:06] middle of that noise and it'll quien the
[35:07] whole thing but why don't it quiten you
[35:11] because this ain't just
[35:13] noise this is an eruption of Faith
[35:16] because of the word of God you see what
[35:19] it is and brother R said there they were
[35:21] Pentecostal and Presbyterians and
[35:22] whatever he said and they stood there
[35:25] and we knew something was wrong but we
[35:28] just couldn't find it yet and all the
[35:30] sudden while we were groping in the
[35:33] darkness Resurrection came to us through
[35:37] the manifested word of God Resurrection
[35:40] came to us through the Gospel of Jesus
[35:43] Christ when you're preaching the gospel
[35:45] you are preaching the resurrection power
[35:48] of Jesus Christ listen I'm not an
[35:50] intellectual I'm not a psychologist I'm
[35:53] not a doctor I'm not a doctor of
[35:55] divinity I am not a good intellectual
[35:57] speaker but one thing I know I have met
[36:00] him in the power of his resurrection and
[36:02] it caused a change to come over my life
[36:05] and somebody said well brother Wayne
[36:06] Amen I think you have an error here and
[36:08] I don't think you're good here and I
[36:09] don't think you're listen I don't I had
[36:11] never claimed to be perfect I had never
[36:13] claim to be a perfect man but I do claim
[36:16] this amen what I am not what I need to
[36:19] be or want to be but I'm certainly not
[36:22] what I used to be I know this morning
[36:24] without a shadow of a doubt that
[36:26] something met me and caused a change to
[36:29] come over me what was it the
[36:31] resurrection came and brought us out of
[36:34] denomination the resurrection came and
[36:36] brought us out of Creeds the
[36:38] resurrection came do you see it it came
[36:40] to you and brought you out of
[36:42] denomination it brought you out of creed
[36:44] and some of those denominations might
[36:46] have been right in the message of the
[36:47] hour some of those false teachings that
[36:50] you were involved in that had cut you
[36:52] off from God and made you a follower of
[36:54] a man well we're not following a man
[36:56] we're not following a certain preacher
[36:58] we're not even following the man William
[37:00] brandom We are following the angel of
[37:02] the Covenant Jesus Christ the son of God
[37:05] which was anointed and pushed To Us by
[37:08] the angel of the Lord amen I believe
[37:10] today that there is a Believer on the
[37:12] face of the Earth that has been
[37:14] quickened by quickening
[37:16] [Applause]
[37:18] power Resurrection came to us right we
[37:22] didn't just receive a message it was
[37:24] resurrection that came to
[37:26] us and it came to us through manifested
[37:29] word I tell you what brother bam said he
[37:31] said through manifested word he said
[37:33] what are you going to do pray him down
[37:35] he said you want to see the Lord what
[37:37] you going to do pray him down he said it
[37:38] ain't like that he said he's in you so
[37:41] if you want to see the Lord he said let
[37:43] him manifest through you he wants to use
[37:45] you to manifest through you to show this
[37:49] dead world he is more than a Doctrine
[37:51] he's more than a teaching he's more than
[37:54] a church joining he is the changing of
[37:56] the human being
[37:57] that'll bring life into your body
[38:00] Hallelujah I believe the token is on
[38:02] display in this age through the Bride of
[38:05] Jesus Christ there will come a
[38:07] resurrection for the bright
[38:11] age out of dark denomination be a
[38:14] resurrection out of denomination there
[38:16] will be a message full of maturity and
[38:18] the word has turned it back into its
[38:21] full power because I
[38:24] live you live also see because there's a
[38:27] Resurrection you're
[38:29] alive right because there's a message
[38:32] you
[38:33] live otherwise you'd be subject to
[38:36] whatever it was you were being taught
[38:38] right but Resurrection came to
[38:41] you oh

[39:23] Resurrection but you all know me amen we
[39:25] believe in a general Resurrection we

[40:28] just did it all for me I don't know
[40:29] about you he knew a dumb hbil he was
[40:32] going to preach his message and I had to
[40:35] have something that I could understand
[40:37] so he takes it from quickening power and
[40:39] changes it to the engine of your car so
[40:42] all your mechanics he said you got the
[40:44] car there's your mechanics but you need
[40:47] the Dynamics which is the fire fire gas
[40:50] and compression right that's what you
[40:51] need to make something run amen so so
[40:54] you you had the compression you had the
[40:55] gas he said but see the fire and he and
[40:59] he brings the fire of the car engine as
[41:01] the quickening power that brought Jesus
[41:03] from the grave and he said look you
[41:05] can't have a movement without having
[41:08] both mechanics and
[41:11] Dynamics you can't move without it you
[41:14] can have the best looking
[41:20] Cadillac it could be a gift from
[41:26] God I ain't supposed to tell so I
[41:30] won't you know but but but but but it it
[41:33] could be a gift from
[41:36] God I ain't calling you
[41:43] God but it'll set still Without fire
[41:46] that's and you can look at the
[41:48] electronics and you can look at the
[41:49] seats and you can man it's a beautiful
[41:51] ride but it ain't going to take you
[41:53] anywhere until Fire Hits the plug that's
[41:56] right right and that that is the truth
[41:59] whether it's a Cadillac or a
[42:01] Toyota come on no whether if it's an
[42:03] Asian or if it's an African or it's
[42:06] American it's the truth anyhow if it's a
[42:09] black or a white or a yellow or a blue
[42:11] it doesn't matter what color the car
[42:14] what make the car what model the car if
[42:16] it's going to move it's got to have fire
[42:20] in the engine Church of the Living God
[42:23] we put too much stress on the mechanics
[42:26] while nothing on the Dynamics we need
[42:30] the Dynamics of God in the Church of the
[42:32] Living God he's a Healer but we need to
[42:34] see it happen he's a death Razer but we
[42:37] need to see it happen he opens up
[42:40] blinded eyes but we need to see it
[42:42] happen he's the he's the light he's the
[42:45] light that charges he said too much
[42:47] stress on the mechanics paragraph 104 if
[42:49] you want to look at it he said but it
[42:51] needs Dynamic power the resurrection
[42:56] power dyamic power resurrection power
[42:59] quickening power are you are you
[43:00] catching my my point the holy spirit is
[43:03] that power remember Psalms 110 and
[43:07] there's a willing people in the day of
[43:10] his power what power the quickening
[43:13] power the son of man power the power of
[43:16] God there's got to come one brother BR
[43:18] said a true bride that has both
[43:21] mechanics and
[43:23] dynamics that church will move in the
[43:26] power
[43:27] of the
[43:28] Resurrection my goodness that's the
[43:31] Easter message the Dynamics and
[43:32] mechanics it's not Easter but can it be
[43:34] this
[43:35] morning amen the Dynamics and mechanics
[43:37] come together the mechanics without the
[43:42] Dynamics is no
[43:45] good I like this one and neither is the
[43:49] Dynamics without the
[43:52] mechanics come on that's why I'm
[43:55] standing here reading these things
[43:58] it's not to do away with the Dynamics
[44:00] but if you have the Dynamics without the
[44:02] message it's no good to you but if you
[44:05] got the word and you don't have any fire
[44:07] it's no good to you but if you put the
[44:10] two of them together brother the move is
[44:12] on and may I say this the prophet said
[44:15] thus saith the Lord the move is on for
[44:17] the bride in other words he started the
[44:19] car and left it warming up for the bride
[44:22] you're not going out into a cold morning
[44:24] with a dead car he left the car running
[44:27] the Church of the Living God if we're
[44:29] going to go home we got a ride this
[44:32] morning we can ride the bus of God into
[44:35] the presence of God it's been cranked up
[44:37] amen it's ready to
[44:39] go
[44:42] hallelujah it's the truth amen what is
[44:45] it it's here to bring
[44:47] hope the message come to bring hope now
[44:50] brother brand types it here's another
[44:51] Direction he'll take it he'll say look
[44:53] now here it is for you Farmers he said
[44:56] you can have all these Fe Fields out
[44:57] here but when the sun comes up and it
[45:00] goes across the field he said not all
[45:02] the dirt is quickened no he said not all
[45:06] the dirt is quickened but the sun
[45:09] quickens the part of the dirt that holds
[45:12] the seed so you can bring the presence
[45:14] of God but without there being a seed in
[45:17] the dirt it won't do them any good but
[45:20] if a Sun hits dirt with a seed in it
[45:24] something's going to happen you won't
[45:26] have to p up you won't have to prop it
[45:28] up you won't have to make it happen just
[45:30] let the sun shine and you will see the
[45:33] power of God move in the church I
[45:36] believe it I believe the predestinated
[45:37] people there's part of this that is
[45:39] predestinated to life amen I'll tell you
[45:42] what when you start looking at this
[45:44] quickening power amen see what it has
[45:46] done for Jesus it has done for you it
[45:50] has quickened your mortal body look what
[45:53] brother Ram said he said then if the
[45:55] spirit that raised him from the dead the
[45:57] Dynamic word dwells in
[46:00] you ain't that powerful it also quickens
[46:04] your mortal
[46:06] body you used to be a sinner but you're
[46:08] not you used to smoke but you don't you
[46:12] used to sister used to wear those pants
[46:14] and cut but you don't no more what
[46:16] happened to you what caused the change
[46:19] it was Dynamic power of the Holy Ghost
[46:22] over the seed of life that brought you
[46:25] into change there Therefore your body is
[46:28] the Temple of his
[46:31] Dynamics I need a whole service on that
[46:34] don't I your body is a temple of his
[46:36] Dynamics there's something happening in
[46:39] the
[46:40] church and the church is not just this
[46:42] building but the church is you and
[46:45] you're a temple of that Dynamics
[46:47] therefore the Temple of Dynamics from
[46:49] the beginning you're a part of the
[46:50] mechanics there there is your
[46:55] Resurrection the church is the church in
[46:58] the resurrection with him the bodies now
[47:02] are
[47:03] quickened Hallelujah now you brother
[47:05] Wayne that's over my head but it's not
[47:07] it's not look at this brother BR says it
[47:09] like this and when the Dynamics and the
[47:11] mechanics see it comes together a true
[47:15] Eagle will understand
[47:18] that in John chapter 5: 24 he that
[47:21] heareth my words and believeth upon him
[47:23] that sent me hath passed from Death unto
[47:27] life amen passed from Death quickened
[47:29] from Death to life it's the Book of John
[47:32] that's Jesus's words and he that
[47:34] believeth on me hath everlasting life
[47:36] brother man said he that believeth he
[47:38] said now you could believe and go out
[47:39] here he said and your life didn't change
[47:41] at all he said that's not what Jesus is
[47:44] saying he's saying he that understandeth
[47:48] now here's where you got to be careful
[47:50] because I I I I've been through the
[47:51] school already is that you that you can
[47:54] see someone will take a quote like this
[47:57] and then if you if they study a little
[47:59] more than you do or they have a little
[48:01] better understanding in in the knowledge
[48:03] of how scripture lays together or
[48:05] something then they'll they'll show you
[48:07] that you don't have any understanding
[48:08] they have the understanding so then that
[48:10] puts a superiority you got to go to the
[48:13] individual all the time well listen that
[48:16] that that's just not at all what this
[48:18] quote's talking
[48:19] about listen Peter couldn't read or
[48:21] write
[48:23] folks couldn't read or write but he knew
[48:26] the Messiah when he spoke to him he
[48:30] understood remember the woman at the
[48:32] well she
[48:34] understood the same way you understand
[48:38] you can't make all the scripture fit
[48:40] because that's not your calling but
[48:42] something in you understands this is
[48:45] that something in you just agrees come
[48:49] on now you know it's true you can study
[48:51] the word but without the quickener
[48:53] there's no understanding there but when
[48:56] Zoe life is passing through you now this
[48:58] is Brother Ram's teaching when Zoe life
[49:02] is passing to them I give unto them a
[49:04] Zoey life he says watch now he says
[49:07] which moves through you and quickens
[49:09] your mind to this
[49:11] word some reason you changed your
[49:14] baptism quickening
[49:16] power some reason you changed your
[49:18] belief on predestination quickening
[49:21] power see what caused the change
[49:24] quickening power that was a time brother
[49:27] Mike he was in that in that certain
[49:28] denomination what caused the change
[49:31] quickening power the seed took him to a
[49:34] Pentecost right and he could testify
[49:37] this morning the no the noise was there
[49:39] but the life wasn't there but the seed
[49:42] life in him said there's life somewhere
[49:45] so he searched until he found life well
[49:47] that life was in this message amen it
[49:50] awakens the Church of the Living God the
[49:53] spirit quickens the mind to the word of
[49:55] God listen there's some something in you
[49:57] that made you believe it when others are
[49:58] turning it down he says it moves you in
[50:01] that word Jesus was the word manifested
[50:05] on the earth and look what he says he
[50:06] could not do this as a
[50:08] man do you ever think about Jesus saying
[50:12] it is not me that doeth the works but
[50:13] the Father which dwelleth in me he doeth
[50:16] The Works isn't it odd how he showed you
[50:19] a separation between his humanity and
[50:22] what done the works his humanity and
[50:25] what raised him from the dead that's
[50:27] good he was showing you that the
[50:29] quickening power in him was his father
[50:32] yeah and as my father sent me so send I
[50:38] you as a human you can't do these things
[50:42] as a people you can't do this but he
[50:44] sends a quickening spirit to Quicken
[50:47] your mind this is the word see they
[50:50] shall lay their hands on the sick and
[50:51] they shall recover something quickens to
[50:53] you that's the truth that's the word
[50:56] somebody well ask for another age and
[50:57] you say well some reason it's not to me
[50:59] though it's real to me am see something
[51:04] quickens your mind what causes the
[51:06] change is quickening power now uh and I
[51:11] I'll have to maybe sometimes we explain
[51:13] the difference and most of you know me
[51:14] well enough to know that I quite quite
[51:17] believe in a Pentecostal experience I
[51:19] just don't believe asza Street was the
[51:21] original Pentecost and I don't believe
[51:23] the Pentecost we got out here today
[51:25] resembles anything what it wasn't the
[51:26] first
[51:27] church right but a Pentecostal
[51:30] experience began without an
[51:32] ending quot the prophet now it began
[51:35] without an ending and according to the
[51:37] Easter seal it's the only way to confirm
[51:39] the
[51:41] Resurrection The only confirmation of
[51:43] the Resurrection is a Pentecostal
[51:46] experience so it's manifest as its life
[51:48] in you brother R said a Pentecostal
[51:51] experience today is the coming of the
[51:53] Holy Ghost in these last days and it is
[51:56] like like an abstract title deed now
[51:59] watch him lay these thoughts one after
[52:00] the other the whole time he's talking
[52:02] about the Holy Ghost he's telling you
[52:04] it's the fire in your car it's the
[52:06] scream in the eagle it's the sin in the
[52:09] duck of the water it's the it's the life
[52:11] that's in the Jour he's explaining to
[52:13] you what his message is doing for the
[52:16] church and he stands here and says this
[52:18] Pentecostal experience today is like the
[52:20] coming of an abstract and he tells us
[52:22] quickly that the Baptist and the
[52:24] Presbyterians received the ground
[52:27] when they believed upon the Lord Jesus
[52:29] Christ so the ground of Christianity was
[52:31] received through the promise of if you
[52:33] believe on the name of the Lord Jesus
[52:35] thou and thy house shall be saved see
[52:36] they believed on it brother R said and
[52:38] they received the ground he said problem
[52:40] is they never went down to the office
[52:42] and got the abstract for the property so
[52:44] there's all kinds of reasons that they
[52:46] can't have the manifestation of the
[52:48] spirit they can't manifest cuz every
[52:51] time it starts to manifest there's
[52:52] something held against it there's some
[52:55] lean there's some you see they they go
[52:57] down to the ground of the Gospel to get
[52:59] something out of the ground and somebody
[53:01] meets them there and says you can't have
[53:03] that see and because they've got that
[53:05] tradition or because they've got that
[53:07] idea it holds them out of that ground
[53:10] but when a man gets a Pentecostal
[53:12] experience with god he has an abstract
[53:15] to that ground and there is nothing that
[53:17] is held against that individual or the
[53:21] ground itself so you can have everything
[53:24] that's in it because you hold the
[53:25] abstract of it
[53:28] in other words nobody can keep you out
[53:30] of it every promise of it belongs to you
[53:32] how you going to keep me out of
[53:34] healing how you going to keep me out of
[53:36] prayer lines how you going to keep me
[53:38] out of Visions or dreams or
[53:40] interpretation of tongues how you going
[53:41] to keep me out of the N spiritual gift
[53:43] somebody said well we don't believe in
[53:44] those things anymore no you don't
[53:46] believe in them things anymore I believe
[53:47] in those things the Bible believes in
[53:49] these things brother random believes in
[53:51] these things and anybody that's got the
[53:53] abstract to the ground knows they belong
[53:56] to the Church of the Living God they are
[53:58] our possessions by the word of
[54:01] God come on now there's an abstract
[54:03] titley to this brother B said that means
[54:06] every debt is settled and everything
[54:08] that has been struck off all glory he
[54:09] said you might think I act silly but I
[54:11] feel good an abstract deed do you
[54:14] realize what that means do you know what
[54:16] it means brother there is nothing that
[54:19] can take it away from
[54:21] you brother brother Ray screamed out the
[54:24] other day you can't have my tongues you
[54:26] know he said that cuz he's got an
[54:27] abstract for it amen he's got an
[54:30] abstract you can't have my experience
[54:32] I've got an abstract on it you can't
[54:34] have what God's did for me I've got an
[54:35] abstract it belongs to me as an
[54:38] individual you got to get your own you
[54:41] got to get your own abstract you got to
[54:42] get your own
[54:44] experience but I believe every person
[54:46] can have their own
[54:48] experience what is it the property is
[54:51] boughten and you hold the abstract of
[54:53] assurance I love how brother Bram says
[54:54] it paragraph 111 there's there's no
[54:56] devil there's no church there's no
[54:58] theology can overstep the boundaries of
[55:00] God's proof in abstract the baptism of
[55:03] the Holy Ghost recognized Us in Jesus
[55:04] Christ and we're just as sure to raise
[55:07] as he raised because potentially we have
[55:10] already raised in him right I love it he
[55:13] drop down to paragraph 113 he said sure
[55:16] he says there on the day of Pentecost
[55:18] they received the abstract Deed from God
[55:21] it glorified their
[55:23] souls they screamed they saw tongues of
[55:26] of fire separated upon them they
[55:28] quickened their body till they couldn't
[55:29] even speak an Earthly language it
[55:31] quickened their body to Heavenly
[55:33] language the place they were going
[55:34] quickening power of God shook their
[55:36] mortal bodies until the entire mortal
[55:39] language was transfigured transformed
[55:42] into an immortal language with a
[55:43] quickening power what something that
[55:46] belongs if the spirit that raised Jesus
[55:49] from the dead dwells in your mortal body
[55:51] it will also Quicken your mortal body we
[55:53] are quickened by the power of the Living
[55:55] God tongues quick into a new Heavenly
[55:57] language to speak to them I raptured up
[55:59] raising up into a different atmosphere
[56:02] that's what they had ever lived in amen
[56:05] I tell you what it was it was designed
[56:07] to give them an abstract and it was
[56:09] designed to give you an abstract upon
[56:11] the things of God now don't think I'm
[56:13] losing my balance I'm just following
[56:14] scripture I'm in a series right so if
[56:16] you're in a series now watch this I
[56:18] don't believe we ought to go around
[56:20] these things to satisfy somebody who
[56:22] thinks this is out of balance come on
[56:25] that's what's out of balance when
[56:26] someone starts trying to balance the
[56:28] church this is a balanced assembly just
[56:31] get on board and ride and watch the
[56:33] power of God come down through the
[56:35] church in teaching and healing and
[56:38] manifestations listen if you don't have
[56:40] enough Faith to walk like Enoch just get
[56:42] out of the way while somebody else does
[56:44] if you don't have enough Faith to see
[56:46] the power of God moving in your life get
[56:48] out of the way so somebody else can come
[56:51] on Church we're not out of bance we have
[56:54] found our bance in the D dyamics and the
[56:57] mechanics of the word of God when those
[56:59] two come together it is perfectly
[57:02] balanced in the word of
[57:04] God what did it do it quickened them I
[57:07] love this because we have this Bible we
[57:10] have the we have the example of this
[57:11] Bible amen as a as a history book but
[57:14] also as an example to you and I and
[57:16] brother man said let's see it let's look
[57:18] back and let's see what the quickening
[57:21] power done on them what it did for them
[57:23] let's look back and see what happened
[57:26] amen what happened he said look at
[57:28] Steven and all of them he said' look how
[57:30] that whenever Jesus was dying at the
[57:32] cross the whole bunch of them was
[57:35] afraid everybody was scared everybody
[57:37] was scared to say what they believed
[57:39] everybody was afraid to read that quote
[57:41] everybody was afraid to say they
[57:43] believed in that kind of movement of God
[57:45] but brother R said but when they went
[57:46] into that Upper Room when they come down
[57:49] Peter who was ashamed of the moving of
[57:52] God in Jesus Christ when they came down
[57:54] he looked at them and said this is that
[57:57] which Joel prophesied he lost his fear
[58:00] when he found the quickening power come
[58:03] on brother man said you won't be afraid
[58:04] of this message he said whenever you get
[58:07] quicken in power you won't be afraid
[58:09] amen of this message I believe I believe
[58:11] with all my heart when you see that it's
[58:13] God you'll never be afraid of this you
[58:16] won't be afraid to witness look at
[58:17] Steven standing there in the face of all
[58:20] those critics look at him stand there
[58:22] and the Bible said his a his face shine
[58:24] like an angel brother said what did that
[58:25] mean he knew what he was talking about
[58:28] he knew what he was talking about and a
[58:30] man that's got an abstract knows what
[58:31] he's talking about I don't mean to be
[58:34] mean it's just some people don't have an
[58:36] abstract so they don't know what that
[58:38] means and how can you teach it when you
[58:40] ain't got it how can you preach it when
[58:42] you've not received it but if you've
[58:44] ever had an abstract if you've ever had
[58:46] an experience with almighty God I can
[58:48] tell every person in this building if
[58:51] you get along with God long enough there
[58:53] will come a dynamic power in your life
[58:56] how'll make this message the truth
[58:59] everything in it'll be true somebody
[59:00] said well I don't know if this is true
[59:02] or that's true get an experience with
[59:05] God and you'll know that God wrote it
[59:07] and sent it into this age hallelujah
[59:11] amen what was it that quickening power
[59:13] on stepen didn't make him afraid he
[59:15] stood in the face of critics and said
[59:17] amen now look at Peter preaching he says
[59:19] you stiff neck and uncircumcised of
[59:21] heart do always resist the Holy Ghost
[59:23] and he took them all the way in the
[59:24] scripture where they resisted it where
[59:26] they wouldn't receive it and how they
[59:27] wouldn't get it and the Bible said he
[59:29] made him so mad they picked up stones
[59:30] and begin to Stone him and the man was
[59:32] so full of the quickening power of God
[59:34] he didn't curse them he didn't hit them
[59:36] he didn't get mad at them he just simply
[59:39] looked into the heavens and quickening
[59:40] power and began to say amen I see the
[59:43] heavens opened up and the Jesus standing
[59:45] at the right hand of God I tell you this
[59:47] morning church there is a quickening
[59:49] power that can get on a man until all he
[59:52] can see is Jesus glorified in the
[59:55] presence of God
[59:57] he was ducking stones but he was
[59:59] preaching the
[1:00:00] gospel I'm not ducking Stones this
[1:00:02] morning

[1:00:06] Stevens I'm preaching to right now heyen
[1:00:09] look what was happening out brother Bram
[1:00:10] says it actually happened he says look
[1:00:13] how that quickening power now brother
[1:00:14] Bram is the kind of guy to put it on
[1:00:16] somebody and see how it acted we' seen
[1:00:18] what it done for stevenh he said let's
[1:00:20] move over here about Phillip he said
[1:00:22] he's in the big middle of a Great Big
[1:00:24] Revival and the Lord sends him down down
[1:00:26] to one man he said see quickening Power
[1:00:28] made him follow the inspiration and he
[1:00:31] goes down to one man and he starts
[1:00:33] preaching the scripture under quickening
[1:00:36] power and then he baptizes a man and
[1:00:38] brother B said he had so fulfilled The
[1:00:40] Obedience of the Lord he said until you
[1:00:43] don't see him for a couple hundred miles
[1:00:45] away he was translated under quickening
[1:00:48] power of the Holy Ghost listen his body
[1:00:51] was translated it was not Rapture time
[1:00:54] it was not time for the rapture but the
[1:00:56] very thing that will Rapture the church
[1:00:59] was already in Phillip and it was what
[1:01:01] was preaching and it was what was
[1:01:03] baptizing and it was what was causing
[1:01:05] revivals and that same thing causes a
[1:01:08] change of the Mortal body Hallelujah he
[1:01:11] was so full of quickening power till he
[1:01:13] was changed and translated to another
[1:01:16] place look that's what quickening power
[1:01:18] do it changes things I love how brother
[1:01:21] bandam takes it he said he takes it he
[1:01:22] goes he goes watch philli quickening
[1:01:24] power but watch that quickening power on
[1:01:28] Enoch he didn't just get translated for
[1:01:30] a few hundred
[1:01:34] miles he just didn't come back no more
[1:01:37] he took a walk with God and he just
[1:01:40] didn't come back he was so full of the
[1:01:43] quickening power until a man could walk
[1:01:46] from one dimension to another and it was
[1:01:49] before the Holy Ghost was given oh
[1:01:52] Church of the Living God he did it with
[1:01:54] the Enoch and brother said watch him
[1:01:56] come right to Elijah he said it was the
[1:01:58] same quickening power what he's doing is
[1:02:00] he's showing the power of God's
[1:02:02] quickening power he said it was the same
[1:02:04] thing on Elijah it was the same power
[1:02:07] that was on Elijah and when Elijah
[1:02:09] crossed he said he looked over the
[1:02:10] Jordan and he said he could see it
[1:02:12] coming he could see all the way almost a
[1:02:14] home from over that Jordan and when he
[1:02:17] crossed it there was fiery chariots
[1:02:18] laying there and he said he went and
[1:02:20] climbed up in one of them chariots and
[1:02:21] Sister Shelby the quickening power of
[1:02:23] God caused that man to leave the Earth
[1:02:26] while Elisha was standing there watching
[1:02:28] him brother said the quickening power
[1:02:29] took him up in the Chariot took the coat
[1:02:32] off of him and threw it back down to
[1:02:34] Elisha it was quickening power that put
[1:02:38] the coat on Elisha look at that it was
[1:02:40] quick brother said it was quickening
[1:02:42] power I don't know if y'all ever caught
[1:02:43] that but it was good for me it was
[1:02:44] quickening power that raised him but it
[1:02:46] was quickening power that took the rment
[1:02:49] and put it back upon Elisha it's the
[1:02:52] same quickening power that raised up
[1:02:55] Elijah was quickening Elisha in his
[1:03:00] miracles yall know Elisha doesn't double
[1:03:03] the Miracles of Elijah right cuz he
[1:03:04] asked for a double portion and you know
[1:03:07] brother BR said you could have a double
[1:03:08] portion not of brother bradam but of
[1:03:10] Jesus Christ it's it's a double portion
[1:03:13] it's the first birth inheritance right
[1:03:15] it's a double portion of the inheritance
[1:03:17] and you could receive that inheritance
[1:03:19] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost it
[1:03:21] is the inheritance of the church and
[1:03:23] look at the beauty of this when Elisha
[1:03:24] received this he done double the
[1:03:26] Miracles except
[1:03:28] one he done double the Miracles except
[1:03:31] one and and I was reading some time ago
[1:03:33] and it come to mind this morning amen
[1:03:35] but somebody was asking about how how
[1:03:37] many miracles and and and it looks like
[1:03:39] Elijah done uh uh so many miracles and
[1:03:41] Elisha done one less than than the
[1:03:44] double of Elijah but you know it's
[1:03:45] amazing that just after Elisha dies they
[1:03:48] bury him in a seler and brother B said
[1:03:51] but watch now the quickening power that
[1:03:53] had raised Elijah that had anointed
[1:03:56] Elisha he said did not leave him in
[1:03:59] death he said watch him all the way into
[1:04:02] the SRE they come by one day with a dead
[1:04:04] man and they threw him in the seler with
[1:04:07] Elisha and the quickening power that was
[1:04:10] on the bones of a dead man raised him
[1:04:12] back from the life and the Bible said he
[1:04:14] was revived and he stood on his feet
[1:04:17] isn't that powerful you know what
[1:04:18] brother Bram says he said he was laying
[1:04:20] hands on them from the dead he said
[1:04:22] there he was in the Tomb still laying
[1:04:24] hands on them he was still such an
[1:04:26] anointed man that his bones were
[1:04:29] Anointed with the power of God I say oh
[1:04:32] anoint our bones anoint our shadows
[1:04:35] anoint our clothes give us that
[1:04:37] quickening power
[1:04:39] Lord Brother B said that was Elisha he
[1:04:42] said you're the bones of Jesus you
[1:04:44] know and that quickening power didn't
[1:04:46] leave him in death brother said watch
[1:04:49] now Moses was so quickened it didn't
[1:04:52] leave him in death remember he died in
[1:04:55] know disob but God let him see it but
[1:04:58] 800 years later he's standing in the
[1:05:02] promised land with the Lord himself on
[1:05:06] Mount Transfiguration brother said see
[1:05:08] it is there death didn't destroy the
[1:05:10] promise 800 years later Moses was so
[1:05:13] full of the quickening power that he was
[1:05:15] seen in the great land of Jerusalem I'll
[1:05:18] tell you this if that quickening power
[1:05:20] was good 800 years after what about Job
[1:05:22] who stood there on an ash Heap and
[1:05:24] brother Ram said watch him he said there
[1:05:26] he is under that Ash Heap his boils upon
[1:05:28] his body but the quickening power of God
[1:05:31] fell onto him and he jumped up from the
[1:05:33] where he was standing and said look look
[1:05:35] at this though the skin worms eat this
[1:05:37] body in my flesh I'm going to see God
[1:05:40] and he knew the quickening power when he
[1:05:43] said I shall see him for
[1:05:46] myself I shall see him for myself amen
[1:05:50] my redeemer is
[1:05:53] alive yes sir God quickening power was
[1:05:59] living see when quickening power got on
[1:06:01] J I'm not left my subject now when
[1:06:04] quickening power got on John he saw the
[1:06:07] entire
[1:06:10] Revelation look look it'll Quicken your
[1:06:12] mind to the word he saw the entire
[1:06:15] Revelation and wrote the Book of
[1:06:17] Revelations it was quickening power that
[1:06:19] wrote that word it got on Isaiah and he
[1:06:22] wrote an entire Bible and he seen the
[1:06:25] millenni
[1:06:26] him it was because of quickening power
[1:06:29] because it's what led him look into that
[1:06:31] now brother brandom takes us through all
[1:06:33] these and then he said but what has
[1:06:35] quickening power done in your
[1:06:37] day we see what it done in the Bible
[1:06:40] what has it done in your day he said it
[1:06:42] let me prophesy 6 months before it ever
[1:06:45] happened and I went up on Mount Sunset
[1:06:47] and met with seven angels He said what
[1:06:50] was it up there it was not the
[1:06:52] intelligence of a man it was the
[1:06:54] quickening power of God
[1:06:56] that come to open these Seven Seals what
[1:06:59] gave us this seal book it's the
[1:07:00] quickening power of God this is not
[1:07:04] intellects of man this is not doctrines
[1:07:07] of divinity this is the quickening power
[1:07:09] of God come to Quicken the church to the
[1:07:12] revelation of the son of man that would
[1:07:15] come forward in this last day what was
[1:07:17] it that caused William brandham to
[1:07:19] preach the greatest Revelations that
[1:07:22] have ever been preached it was
[1:07:23] quickening power that same same
[1:07:25] quickening power that caused him to
[1:07:27] preach the seals is the same quickening
[1:07:29] power that caused him to look at the
[1:07:31] storm and tell it to go back where it
[1:07:33] come from the same quickening power that
[1:07:36] preached it is the rising of the sun is
[1:07:39] the same one that looked at a little
[1:07:40] fish in the water and said little fishy
[1:07:43] I give you back your life the same
[1:07:45] quickening power that preached God rich
[1:07:48] in Mercy it's the same one that looked
[1:07:51] at Hatty R and said I give you your
[1:07:53] children in the name of the Lord the
[1:07:55] same quickening power at priest Jesus of
[1:07:58] Nazareth also said to Georgie Carter
[1:08:01] rise up out of your bed after nine years
[1:08:04] of laying on a bed and she rose up and
[1:08:06] walked by the quickening power it wasn't
[1:08:09] just a quickening power of Revelation it
[1:08:12] was a quickening power of their bodies
[1:08:14] in their healing in their manifestations
[1:08:17] of their life it was a quickening power
[1:08:19] that come upon them listen I I I I I
[1:08:22] think it's a beautiful thing to see when
[1:08:24] quickening power begins to move
[1:08:26] quickening power would move in the
[1:08:27] church on a Sunday morning brother Ron
[1:08:30] would be here quickening power would
[1:08:32] move over brother Tyler and the power of
[1:08:34] God would drop out but see quickening
[1:08:36] Power don't stop at the end of church
[1:08:38] quickening power don't stop when the
[1:08:39] preaching stops but quickening Power was
[1:08:42] with them at their house in the middle
[1:08:43] of their home when the angel of the Lord
[1:08:45] steps in the room and Troy became
[1:08:48] manifesting of that spoken word and he
[1:08:51] spoke to Sarah you can have your healing
[1:08:53] and right here we are a year later and
[1:08:56] we're seeing the Divine Healing what was
[1:08:58] it it was quickening power something

[1:09:28] to your
[1:09:29] life come on you you don't don't think
[1:09:31] I'm crazy Brother David what was it the

[1:09:36] spirit it was quickening power sister
[1:09:38] Faith broke out in tongues it was
[1:09:40] quickening power what was it it's the
[1:09:43] power of
[1:09:45] God sister Lia what was it made you come
[1:09:47] to the altar when you didn't know what
[1:09:49] me and brother Ray been praying about
[1:09:51] but it was quickening power that did it
[1:09:53] and the inspiration began to move over
[1:09:55] to the church and you said brother Wayne
[1:09:57] we ain't seen no results yet that's the
[1:09:59] key word
[1:10:01] yet yet CU one thing it is I've got an
[1:10:04] abstract folks and it belongs to me and
[1:10:07] brother Ericson's got a token and it
[1:10:09] belongs to him and we're going to claim
[1:10:11] it and we're not going to back off of it
[1:10:13] and we're not going to let no devil take
[1:10:15] it away from us this experience belongs
[1:10:18] to every believer in this building and
[1:10:20] we're going to hold it until every
[1:10:22] person gets it until healing has
[1:10:25] received until people are raised out of
[1:10:27] unbelief
[1:10:29] until it's quickening power and I say
[1:10:33] it's here this
[1:10:34] [Applause]
[1:10:35] morning his quickening
[1:10:37] power it's the same spirit that raised
[1:10:40] Jesus from the
[1:10:42] dead what is it could hit a man brother
[1:10:45] Mike as big as you are and knock him on
[1:10:47] the ground he'll roll around and cry
[1:10:49] like a big old baby it's the quickening
[1:10:51] power of God what was it last Sunday
[1:10:54] that swept through here and our young
[1:10:55] ladies started dancing in the spirit
[1:10:57] amen our dancers let's put it that way
[1:11:00] the ones appointed of the Lord to dance
[1:11:02] before the Lord somebody said brother
[1:11:03] Wayne I Don't Dance that's okay it's not
[1:11:05] your part one out of every seven was
[1:11:07] given a certain job that might not be
[1:11:09] your job but if the Holy Spirit has put
[1:11:12] it on them amen then I say let the
[1:11:14] quickening power of God move the way he
[1:11:17] wants to
[1:11:18] [Applause]
[1:11:22] move well okay can I say something here
[1:11:27] sometimes see you see one manifestation
[1:11:29] of it and then you see another and you
[1:11:30] think of one in a different way than you
[1:11:31] think of the other sometimes Brother Ray
[1:11:33] gets carried away I sit beside him
[1:11:36] sometimes sometimes he gets carried away
[1:11:38] and then I get carried away with him I
[1:11:40] can't help it he gets under the spirit
[1:11:41] it puts me under it every time I we must
[1:11:44] be soulmates or
[1:11:46] something Hallelujah he'll break out
[1:11:49] like that now what now what me and him
[1:11:52] are doing shouting and praising out like
[1:11:54] that or maybe even crying out in unknown
[1:11:56] language it's a quickening spirit but
[1:11:59] when it moves maybe when it moves on
[1:12:01] Ella it moves differently and she's not
[1:12:04] crying out but maybe she dances out in
[1:12:06] the spirit it LO on somebody else
[1:12:07] different maybe maybe somebody else now
[1:12:09] I seen it hit sister Hannah and she went
[1:12:11] to run in the building but you don't
[1:12:12] know what was being spoke to her you
[1:12:14] don't know that the angel of the Lord
[1:12:16] was answering a question for her and it
[1:12:18] wasn't the man it was quickening power
[1:12:20] of God we're not up here bragging about
[1:12:22] what a man can do the only man I'm
[1:12:24] bragging on is that man Christ Jesus and
[1:12:27] I say he's not dead I say he has Rose
[1:12:29] into the heavens and he sits at the
[1:12:31] right hand of God with the quickening
[1:12:33] power of the Holy Spirit can move he has
[1:12:36] many manifestations and many attributes
[1:12:39] but he's the quickening power of God
[1:12:40] that was on Steven that was on Elisha
[1:12:42] that was on Elijah it was on Paul it was
[1:12:44] on James it was on John it was on
[1:12:46] William brand it's on Brother Ray it's
[1:12:48] on me it's on the Church of the Living
[1:12:50] God and I said we ought to F the Flames
[1:12:53] of the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost and
[1:12:54] let it
[1:12:56] [Applause]
[1:13:00] burn yes I believe I believe we need the
[1:13:03] Pentecostal power of almighty
[1:13:06] God what caused the
[1:13:11] change it was quicking
[1:13:13] power I went up to the altar one night
[1:13:16] and that fire come rolling up through
[1:13:17] the Altar and hit me it was quickening
[1:13:20] power that was there at
[1:13:22] night that was quickening power
[1:13:27] it was quick it's look folks this this
[1:13:29] is this is real amen it is it's
[1:13:34] real something is changing
[1:13:37] you so brother Wayne there's there's
[1:13:40] there's a a there's an anointing comes
[1:13:41] through the church sometimes and almost
[1:13:43] breathtaking what is that quickening
[1:13:48] power quickening power is what taught
[1:13:52] the Book of Revelations yes yes are you
[1:13:55] are you with me when you hear the
[1:13:58] teaching of the Revelation it's still
[1:14:00] quickening
[1:14:02] power when you see the moving of the
[1:14:05] spirit it's still quickening
[1:14:09] power what caused the change is
[1:14:12] quickening power let stand to your feet
[1:14:15] with us this
[1:14:16] morning Hallelujah and
[1:14:19] you who he hath
[1:14:23] quickened who made alive
[1:14:32] I I tell you I had some powerful quotes
[1:14:34] here I get to preach and I I don't have
[1:14:36] time to read all day but I say this is
[1:14:39] powerful death don't stop
[1:14:43] [Music]
[1:14:45] it oh
[1:14:50] my brother Daryl death don't stop it
[1:14:56] quickening
[1:15:00] power quickening power it don't stop
[1:15:05] it so I'm pretty sure what you talking
[1:15:07] about I'm talking about the same
[1:15:11] thing that met our sister Liz when she
[1:15:13] come out of the water of her
[1:15:16] baptism and caused her to live this
[1:15:19] message is the same thing that'll raise
[1:15:22] her right out of a grave one of these
[1:15:23] mornings
[1:15:25] but Josh death don't stop
[1:15:30] it one of the last things I've seen out
[1:15:32] of
[1:15:34] Rachel was her coming to an
[1:15:37] altar death don't stop
[1:15:40] it now to our
[1:15:43] minds but the change that happens to an
[1:15:46] individual in the spirit death can't
[1:15:48] harm
[1:15:50] that I remember a couple weeks
[1:15:53] before
[1:15:56] before the explosion
[1:15:57] there I remember standing up here and
[1:15:59] watching sister Rachel came I remember
[1:16:02] she sitting here somewhere and she went
[1:16:03] out that door right there one door
[1:16:05] wasn't there I don't think then but she
[1:16:07] came and she started walking out and
[1:16:08] just as she started walking away brother
[1:16:10] the Nick I looked and there was a white
[1:16:12] Veil white just as white as this was
[1:16:15] hooked into her hair and it was hanging
[1:16:17] all the way down her
[1:16:19] back and I thought what is
[1:16:23] that come back in it wasn't there
[1:16:26] evidently what never was
[1:16:28] there but I seen it
[1:16:32] there do you see quickening
[1:16:35] Power is what causes the change so when
[1:16:39] you welcome when you welcome quick and
[1:16:42] EMP power sometimes it comes so
[1:16:45] different and it's one mightbe more
[1:16:47] suiting to one person one way and it's
[1:16:50] just maybe more suiting to another
[1:16:52] person another
[1:16:53] way but quickening Power when it comes
[1:16:56] it's so
[1:16:58] beautiful that you just make a way for
