asking you to lead us in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and God bless you today if you have your Bibles let's look into the Book of Daniel the 11th chapter The Book of Daniel the 11th chapter I've uh I've been stuck here um it's uh we had uh had planned to speak a little bit here uh from uh Daniel 11th chapter and tied into some things and the Lord just began to open and bring inspiration in it so we've stayed here for a few services and um I'm I'm still intending to carry this into the third pool um but we want to uh we want to just follow the lord here from Daniel the 11th chapter and the 32nd verse I want to take this and read and as such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall be corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do great exploits amen can we also read here in the ninth verse of the 12th chapter and he said go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed to the time of the end so we're finding out that the people that know their God is going to have to wait till the end that's the people he's talking about for the time of the end for many shall be purified and made wi and tried but the wicked see again from the 11th chapter the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand we thank the Lord for the words you could be seated I want to speak to you again this morning on the exploits of faith I believe this is about the third service that we've been on this subject uh but I I believe it's a very powerful uh thing that we're looking at here speaking of end time events and um and I'm one who believes that the Bible speaks specifically of people I don't believe believe that it's just a general statement the people such as like maybe just somebody might perhaps fall in to fulfill this word but I believe when God writes something he had an intention uh in it when he wrote it I believe he could have wrote your name right here I believe he could have listed the names of the people that he was meaning the people I don't think that God has to learn who the people are when they come but I believe he knew when he said this the people that he was speaking of a certain people people um and uh I I want to maybe continue here and saying the people of course these are the people of God and I I like it because this is not speaking of any specific church it's not speaking of any specific person as far as an individual but rather that the people being a group of people uh I believe I I love how the Apostle Peter will say it that we're A A A peculiar people a chosen generation the people of course coming from the book of Hosea where the Bible said they that were not a people shall be called the people of God according to Romans and I Chapter Paul also says that this is not just the Jew only but also of the Gentile um if you take that to Bible prophecy of course through Abraham's Covenant Abraham saw his seed as the stars and as the Sands of course those are the people and that would move right into the Gentiles according through scripture uh the Bible tells us that not Jew only only but also the Gentile which were Jew inwardly or that they were com into the abrahamic Covenant according to Galatians the 3D chapter the Bible says them that are in Christ are Abraham's seed and Heir according to the promises isn't it amazing just one seed but many promises meaning that you would identify through our lord Jesus the Romans The Book of Romans the eth chapter also says that if we are the sons of God of course by his Spirit then we're also joint HS with every promise that God has made and we're joint hirs with Jesus Christ this morning amen so our our uh blessings our our Grace comes from the spirit of God Amen according to scripture here in Philippians chapter 3 Paul was one of those people who wanted to know their God and he said that I may know him in the power of his resurrection so we do want to know God but we want to know God in the power of his resurrection matters matters who is introduced ing him to you and how that you know him uh when you uh think of this brother Ram will say it to know him by the word now to know him by the word's all right but it's a long ways from sufficient to know him by the word you've got to know him by the person of his resurrection amen you got to know more than just to know his word cuz even the devil can read the Bible and believe amen but but uh he's never saved amen the Bible the Bible is truly surely true and the devil above above all knows that God is real so you've got to have an experience with God that's different than just a learning knowledge amen of course many people had a knowledge of God but not a saving knowledge or not a resurrection knowledge uh so we want want to want to know that we need to experience him and then that's a a true experience when you go into the Bible Luke 24 you'll see the two were walking on the road to EMAs and the Bible says their eyes were opened and they knew him so God has experiences he has things that he does that you would know him of course I believe that that was an end time prophecy of what God would do in the last days that there would be a people who would see God they would know him in the power of his resurrection of course the two on the road to m is a beautiful picture because they met Jesus after his resurrection and was showing that Jesus would make himself known after his resurrection amen which is the ministry of the Holy Ghost today is that we don't believe that Jesus is dead I I am one preacher that don't believe that Jesus is just a symbol of history or he's just a man that lived 2,000 years ago but but I propose that Jesus Christ is alive and just as real this morning as he ever was in any day in history and it's one thing just to say that but it's another thing to know that by an experience with him or an encounter with God that's deeper than just acknowledge of I've read about him or I heard about him amen that's a little bit like a painted fire amen you can you can look at a painted fire but you don't get very warmed by that fire amen but but you literally can set by a fire all you can do is start one I don't believe that we have to just read about men who who met Jesus or who talks about Jesus but I believe that we can know him in a personal encounter in a very powerful way I believe we can know him today the same as did then actually Jesus in John 14 and 20 made a direct prophecy concerning this and he said at that day now he said ye shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you a direct prophecy now that you would know some people don't even believe that you could know when you got saved but Jesus said you could amen some people don't don't even realize that they could know when they received the Holy but Jesus said you could so there is a way that you can actually know amen you can actually know that you're saved and I believe that you need to know that you know amen I I believe that is a something you should know that you know that you have met him Amen on a different level now I believe that's why this message has came to us that we might be able uh to know and to realize the god that we've met now uh when you go into the scripture of course you can read of the abrahamic Covenant and uh I I think it's a powerful thing because the Covenant that God made with his church again the Covenant was the Corporal body of our Lord Jesus Christ which was taken to Calvary and it was broken too now God took his part of the Covenant that he made with man and he took the Corporal body into heaven and he gave back the spirit of Jesus to the church so there's there's there's a covenant that God has made with the people now god holds his part of the Covenant in heaven tonight this morning his part of the Covenant what he holds as a covenant people is the very body of Jesus Christ but what the church holds as a covenant is the very Spirit of Jesus Christ and we have received of his Spirit now God gave that Spirit but I I would say that Through the Ages we could prove with with time and I'm not going to take it this morning but we could show simply how that through the Reformation men like Martin Luther who smoked the PIP and baptized wrongly believed in three gods and and yet he was uh he was a man who was used of God for reformation so it showed that God uses his Spirit sometimes not in a fullness when you look at John Wesley and the sanctification move it was a little further advanced than what John Wesley was amen but yet it was not yet in its fullness so just as a seed is put in the ground and you watch a seed grow through a a a season you can see the seed when it's first put in the ground maybe a piece of corn but you see it coming forward at first and it don't look like corn at all but it is corn but it's just in the stock or it's just in a phase of that corn but it's corn life the whole time so so the whole time it's corn growing to something but if you wait to a certain part of the season the sun itself will become strong and in that season of strength it will give the strength of fullness to the plant itself and then this the plant will begin to reflect the strength of what it's receiving and it can know its full potential in that hour so that's an hour of fullness and so is it in nature that represents God in fullness so has God given a fullness to the Gentile Church in the last day in the baptism of the Holy Ghost where the Holy Ghost was only justifying some people or sanctifying others or others that came to the place where they had gifts and manifestations but there's got to come a fullness of that anointing of God upon the church and I I believe that we're living in the season of the fullness when God would give to the church I I could take the scripture and stand here for an hour and I'm going going to but I want you to realize that it's scripture in this where the Bible said that there's a season of favor that comes upon the church or there's a season where God met Abraham and he told him he said that according to the time of life amen I believe God chooses seasons and times to bring favor to bring blessing to bring anointing and God has chosen the last days I think it's powerful myself in the in the season of wickedness in the season of darkness in the season when the wicked are doing wickedly I don't think anybody could could argue that that Bible prophecy is true I don't think anybody would argue with me in Daniel 11 where it said the wicked shall do wickedly amen I don't think anybody would say that that's not true the wicked are doing wickedly and there's an atmosphere today that you can do any wicked thing that you want to without a resistance because the atmosphere of in the world is in an atmosphere of wickedness it's wicked everywhere just like the Bible said in John in the Book of Luke that it would be as the days of Noah even when the imagination of man is upon evil but now they're not just imagining it they're doing it it's wicked is doing Wicked but but how is it that we can give that power to the devil and restrain That Power from God why is it that witch doctors are the only one that can have power why is it that psychics is the only one that can see the future why is that the world readily accepts psychics and witch doctors and Witchcraft and they say that it's real but when you talk about the power of God coming into a surrendered vessel some reason they look at that as something that is wrong but the same as the Bible said the wicked shall do wickedly it said the Saints of the righteous shall do exploits in the power of God if a man can fall under a demonic attack and and some become so possessed that he could have 10 times the natural strength of a human being what would happen if a man or a woman who is a Christian that's Redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ if they would surrender their being to the invisible God by the power of the Holy Ghost anything is possible to that believer because they have surrendered their lives to Jesus Christ I tell you it's Amen there's amen there's no amount of wickedness no shortness of wickedness in this age amen but in the samee generation of time I believe we are to create an atmosphere in the Church of God that anything could happen are you the atmosphere of the world's there isn't it Anything Could Happen amen young people walk into school and shoot it's such an atmosphere a little kid can decide they're a a boy if they're a girl and dress like a boy and act like a boy and the whole world plays along with them am mean you can take a grown man put a skirt on and and take long hair and act like a a well it's the truth anyhow amen and the whole world plays along bunch of psychos trying to act like people's this and that and something else and it's an atmosphere where anybody can do it and it goes just fine but but when you try to create an atmosphere that the spirit of God can freely move in somebody thinks something's wrong with that but I'm one that believes that we ought to have an atmosphere of Miracles we ought to have an atmosphere of the baptism of the Holy Ghost there ought to be a sumon amen and a shouting to the word of God there ought to be a feeling in the power of the spirit of God why could people feel evil they can feel wickedness they can feel jealousy they can feel malice they can feel any feeling if it's a wicked feeling but when it comes to feeling the spirit of God something's supposed to be wrong with that but I believe that we ought to feel the power of the anointing of almighty God run through our bodies we are to feel the anointing of life and Truth amen I think I think God to energize the church amen I I don't think anybody has a problem I sometimes the the theologians have so messed up the godhead that they took something very simple made it very complex that people don't understand how many gods there are in heaven amen I it's funny to me if you see a person doing something maybe one man murders another man rapes another person does something else whatever they do everybody will go well that's the devil but when you see the Holy Spirit doing things people wonder which God that is amen but I I'm one that believes that just one devil isn't he nobody has no trouble with that well I don't think it thinks takes three Gods to beat up one devil I think they just one God we can get it real simple can't we it's just one God so what is that that heals it's God what is that that moves in the church by manifestations and power it's God Amen it's not a different God it is the god it's the god that David served when David destroyed Goliath because he knew the god that could do that is that right he had that kind of strength because he had been introduced to that kind of God he didn't learn that from Saul he didn't learn that from the armies but he had had an encounter with the Holy Ghost back there as a shepherd and when he had that encounter he found out he was serving a God that could slay a lion he was serving a God that could kill a bear he knew he could do it because he knew that God he was serving so when he became in a challenge in the Goliath's challenge when he met that challenge he had already had an encounter with God he knew his God so he went into action knowing that this Giant's going to fall amen and I believe today that that kind of man David said the Lord is the strength of my life and that's the that's the strength that I want blessed is the man whose strength is in thee amen if if a man's strength is in the Lord he can walk from strength to strength from increasing power to increasing power David was speaking of course but we can we can give you biblical answers here in the book of numbers of course Caleb himself was 85 years old when he took the mountain that Moses had promised amen uh uh one of the great Patriarchs of our faith Abraham was a hundred years old when he had his child with Sarah who was unable to have a child he was strong in faith being not weak but his strength came from elhad the all breasted almighty God who had met him that's where his strength was coming from was an encounter with God a a a a a a an experience with God gave Abraham the encounter he needed to get strength to believe my body's getting older but my promises are true amen and I I believe today that the the strength the the the contact the the grace that we need in our lives is to encounter the god that would tell us this word is true these promises are true now according to Revelations 10 a mighty Angel is the descend in the last days of course that's none other than Christ The Covenant Angel and they that wait upon him they will renew their strength they that have been waiting on the dissension of that angel will actually renew their strength and receive something that they would not faint according to Revelations 12 the Bible said amen that when this great uh this great uh battle could I put it like this this Angelic battle that began in the heavens when Michael and lucer was fighting amen went from an Angelic battle to a human battle is that right amen you can read in Revelations the 12th chapter you can see an Angelic battles becomes a human battle the Bible Begins by saying that Lucifer and Michael was fighting and then it then it comes over in the 11th verse and said they overcame him by the blood and the word amen who's they of course it's the people who were over there in Daniel the 11th chapter the people who know their God will be the people that overcome the Antichrist in the last days now an Angelic battle becomes a human battle but in that battle there must come a strength for a victory there's got to come a strength for a victory in the church or in individuals something has to give the people an overcoming power amen you got to you got to have something to give you an overcoming power you've got to actually face the battle knowing who's going to win this battle we we're not going to sit here and wait till it's over to find out who's a winner amen but David himself told Goliath amen what he was going to do to him before the battle he asked Saul what's my reward before he ever fought the Battle he knew he was the anointed he knew the God he was serving he knew the battle was won before he ever went into the battle and that's why he overcame because the strength that he overcame by come from the knowledge of the God he served and I believe if anybody's going to overcome this wicked lead toan age the going to have to receive strength from God and a knowledge of what the devil is and what God is so they can overcome that Wicked one can I can I say this amen I I believe now is come strength now is come salvation I believe the strength for the church is here amen I I believe the overcoming strength the 11th verse says they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony in Daniel chapter 11 one of the one of the of the translations to Daniel 11:32 one of the translations powerful translation it says it like this with flatly he will corrupt those who violated the Covenant but the people who know their God will firmly resist so the word exploit can also be translated as the word firmly resist the people that know God will firmly resist the devil isn't that something you got to know who you're resisting though now there's a famous football game years ago y'all remember amen that I think it was even a Super Bowl wasn't it when one of the guy caught the football and and he made the best run of his life but he was running the wrong direction and the crowd was roaring for him but it was the wrong crowd and he was knocking off tackles but it was his own men cuz they were trying to stop him from running he was running the ball for the enemy but he just didn't know he didn't know what he was doing he was fighting hard running hard breaking tackles getting chairs but he was going the wrong way because he wasn't aware he he didn't know had he knew he wouldn't have did it you see that they wouldn't have crucified the Lord had they knew their God they wouldn't have did it you see today people crucify God and don't even know they're doing it they're working against God don't know they're doing it you said preacher I need an example Apostle Paul did it he he thought he was doing something for the Lord and was working against the very thing that he was Desiring to do because CU he didn't know but the moment he met that Pillar of Fire remember what happened he said Lord who are you he said I am Jesus and when he knew is God look what happened Paul became the Gentile to the Church of the of the Apostle to the Church of the Gentiles my because he knew is God look at the strength and look at what Paul did and I believe in the last day that there is a people who can firmly resist the devil because God will make known who is God and who is the devil in the last days you can find it in Bible prophecy in 2 Thessalonians the Bible said that he will reveal the Antichrist in his time amen that's under the first seal isn't it when the first seal is revealed that's the time of the when the Antichrist is reveal the word so so sometimes the defeating of your enemy is not in God uh doing something special but just making known something to you truly overcoming the devil is recognizing the devil in his in his trick and then overcoming him by knowing that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world if you can really see that then you would know that God becomes in this last day fully manifested I believe when God becomes fully manifested amen that the vessel he manifest is in begins to be decreased but then God becomes increased if God could be made known then the individual himself is not the one you follow it's what's been made known now the prophet tells us something powerful I thought I thought it's powerful he told us that today amen just as John in the Bible introduced Jesus Christ and he said now I must decrease and he's going to increase for I was a light for season but now this is the light this is the true light and when he when he made this introduction he said I must decrease and he is going to increase brother BR says we're told that this will repeated again in the last day to introduce the Messiah to the people now and why it had to be Shepherds I think it's a powerful sermon that whenever the angels went to the Shepherds and they told them about Jesus being on the earth can you imagine the Shepherds receiving this kind of message that Jesus was on the Earth that the Messiah had been born now that kind of message went to a certain kind of people those angels went to those Shepherds because they were common people and they could receive a word from the Lord that didn't have to come through the theology or through their ideas but these were simple men who could just receive the word of God that God bypassed the schools God bypassed everything to bring this message to Common herdsman the greatest message of all times he says see we think of Noah's day and the prophets and the great priest and had been in the days G gu the learn Men Kings pones Martin anarchs but when he comes with the greatest message the message was the greatest message it ever give to the Earth was the Messiah is here now see he came to make that known but he bypassed the train to come to the humble to make them know the Messiah is here now can you imagine the greatest message that has ever been preached is the Messiah is here amen I'm thinking today of the message that we are preaching on the Earth today I believe we ought to be preaching the same message the Messiah is here now iist said well preacher how do you say that John 14 said in that day you shall know that I am in the father that you are in me and I in you didn't he say it yet a little while and the world see me no more but you shall see me for I will be with you even in You Until the End of the Age amen then we believe today that the Messiah is the promised word of God for the age that we're living in and that Messiah is not a man the Messiah is the Holy Ghost amen isn't it powerful when you realize that the Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ he said I will go away but I will come again unto you the Messiah then is not a man he said brother ma said I'm your brother the Holy Ghost is here and that's the Messiah we have seen the sign of the Messiah now think of this a messiah in human flesh a super sign the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost resurrected Messiah living among his people amen I believe this I believe a supernatural God in a supernatural body is in a natural people when God moved into the Holy Ghost he could move into the church amen I think it's powerful a natural people can receive a supernatural God in a supernatural body The Immortal Jesus Christ enters a pillar of fire and by that Holy Ghost Fire enters into the church amen he's able to do it that Supernatural God is in a supernatural people now those people will know their God and they will do exploits they will show Supernatural signs to the people in Daniel CH 12 the wise shall understand their God uh let let me let me just go here to Revelation book of symbols when the time is at hand is when this book's going to be revealed now God is going to send something to make known the time that we live in is that right in Daniel the 11th chapter the Bible says amen that he will make known and they shall be strong and they shall do great exploits now can we move into this word exploits for a little bit the word exploit means a bold or daring feet the people who know their God shall be strong and do some daring Feats how many knows of God this morning come on Gideon come on theyve going to do some daring feats they're going to have some daring Deeds the word feat actually means an achievement that requires Great courage skill or strength amen great feats an achievement or an accomplishment a coup or a master stroke the people that know their God is able to do a feat they're able to they're able to overcome the enemy they're over to withstand or resist the devil I I like this one this is another one a deed amen it it it literally they'll be able to do a deed a deed for God Amen in other words a deed something similar would be an action or an activity an exploit a performance or an achievement I give you one more definition amen an exploit means an act those that know their God shall be strong and they shall act theater biblically Parliament law University what is it it's a display here's one of the uh the translations they that know their God will display strength and take action will'll display strength and take action I think it's time for the church to take action amen I believe the people that know their God should know this is the hour of their action I believe it would be the time amen that that would be able that the church should go into action now now you can have churches but I mean an original church I don't mean just the church here in bluon Ohio or just another church but the Church of the Living God Amen should be a church that is universal is that right it should be a universal church it's the body of Christ how do you get into that body by one Spirit now we're not talking about a presbyterian or Baptist or some denomination but we're talking about the Church of the Living God the people of God the church the first born of God do you see that if if if God would grow a tree ever have you ever seen a grafted tree amen you can graft a limb into a tree and that don't mean you're going to get the fruit off of that limb and that's the reason you graft maybe you graft a lemon into an orange tree and and that limb will always produce lemons because it's a lemon limb on an orange tree but if an orange tree produces a branch then you're going to get oranges off of that tree and not lemons and if God ever raises up a church a book of Acts church that will be another book of Acts written by behind that church I believe the True Church of the Living God the people of God is a continuation of the book of Acts amen according to John chapter 15 he said I am the vine and you are the branches and if there is a people that God can move through with his strength and unction those people those people will have another book of Acts written behind it amen I believe these people will live in a certain time I believe they're living in the end time when brother bam ties it together he said these people that lives in this day he said they will live in the day the stone hits the image in the feet the people that do know their their God prophecy after prophecy and seminaries of the world can't take it out God's going to do it anyhow and the people's going to follow it what is it it's God giving an action to the church I believe we've seen these things take place in this age that has given an action to the church Daniel said in the last days the people that do know their God they shall do exploits these scriptures must be fulfilled these scriptures are powerfully true they that know their God shall do exploits that is a promise to the church they will have strength God makes himself known they'll have strength and they will do action I I I love the scripture Jesus said it like this verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater work shall I do because I go unto the father in Mark 11 Jesus said to his disciples after them seeing him curse a fig tree he said to them if you would have faith in God if you would say unto this mountain to be moved it would be done according to what you have asked when a man has an experience with that kind of God he begins to believe that all things are possible to him the same as they're possible to God because you're an heir or a joint air with God Amen I I believe this I believe the things that we're seeing has never happened happened since the coming of the former reign in the first of the Apostles but in the last days now people the kind of church God is looking for I know some people think God's looking for a formal dignified church but I don't believe the first church was a formal dignified church I mean I believe the first church was at the beginning was filled with the spirit it healed the sick it prophesied it had signs and wonders it wasn't ashamed of their religion they shouted and danced under the spirit like drunk men they had clothing tongues of fire they' done signs and wonders exploits followed them that's the kind that was at the beginning that was the kind that's in the middle and that's the kind that's going to be in the end I believe we are that kind of church amen I'm not ashamed of being that kind of church I believe we ought to get an atmosphere with that kind of God that Paul worshiped can come into our church the kind of God that Peter amen let me ask you what kind of God have you been introduced to I believe that we have been introduced to a god that could speak the word of God and cripples could rise up and walk off we've been introduced to a God Amen that could raise the dead that could save The Sinner that could revive the entire world we have been introduced to a living God not a not a determinant or some Creed or some Dogma I don't know about you all but I'm a little sick of religion I'm a little sick of a bunch of people gathering around arguing about money and carpet colors and and who's going to run and what who's going to do I'm a little sick of the religion already a bunch of Hypocrites filling the pull pit amen doing everything they can do to get followings but what about a real genuine Holy Ghost anointing to come in the Church of the Living God with fire and power giving Revival and life until the Holy Ghost takes over every heart and every believer I think we ought to bring Jesus back in the church we ought to bring Jesus with power and with authority we are to take the handcuffs off of God take take the duct tape off of his mouth let God speak again let God act again let God have Miracles again you say how can Jesus do it well let me say this Jesus's Corporal bodies in heaven I think we all believe that that he's got to have another body on the earth and I believe that body is the body of Jesus Christ and if his spirit is in the body wouldn't it act just like he did when he was on the earth when he raised the dead oh my amen I believe it's this hour I believe it's it's an hour where God can perform and work through the church amen I realize that's the hour we're living in now I know I know people say to me say well brother Wayne why AR why aren we just seeing these things now why are we just seeing scripture now amen other men in other ages didn't teach things quite like this well let me tell you can you imagine living in the days of Jesus when Jesus had talked to his disciples he told them about the coming of the crucifixion he told him that he would raise in three days but right after his death on the third day in the moment that the resurrection was to be manifested he found two men walking on the road to EMAs and they were they were downhearted and discouraged and was having a corrupt communication among themselves and Jesus appeared and they didn't even know it was him amen why because God hid from their mind the things that Jesus had said about the resurrection until the moment was being Vindicated and the things concerning this word had been hid right in the Bible until the last days until we had need of it he let us become blind to the things that we see today for the hour we have need of it our fathers didn't know these things the Bible said they wouldn't know them he had them HIIT up but in the last days they would be revealed to the sons of God or they would be made manifested my when I think about this I think of the four knowledge of God when God releases his word when this message came when a prophet Came Upon the Earth and introduced Jesus Christ to this generation as more than a denomination or as more than just some kind of worked up something or some group of of certain men making rules he introduced God as a real God and when he did it there was some people in the mind of God that is wrote about in Daniel the 11th chapter amen that God for ordained them to see that when it happened God or ordained he put somebody on the earth to see the manifestations of God he ordained you to see it if he didn't ordain you you'll never see it but if he did you will see it this is the hour it's here I love how brother Bram says this and I've heard but now I see he said do you see what happened Moses went to the burning bush I think it's powerful Mar as Moses going to the burning bush how many knows Moses went there he's in pretty big trouble his weakness was evident by this time right but when he went to the Bur burning bush it gave Vindication to what Abraham had had promised to him see he received Vindication he saw in the burning bush the same God that Abraham had met and had encountered with and had prophesied and got strength from Moses met that same God as a burning bush because it was as a Vindicated word when job saw him job rose up in job 19 and said I know my redeemer liveth and though the skin worm would eat this body in my flesh shall I see God he prophesied of the Resurrection because he saw the resurrection and William brandom says this he said but see we seen him we see him the same as job saw him we seen him in resurrection power we've not seen him in the grave we didn't anoint him he laying in the Tomb we have seen him after his resurrection we see him this morning in Resurrection power the church amen they heard and read about him and the promises were made but now we see him with our eyes amen I think of this I think of of job and how he saw him people say well I'd like to see him like job up you could see him the same way this morning look at what brother random says it like this he said I know that's how job seen you I know that's how Abraham saw you I know that's how the rest of them saw you because it was your promised word being manifested that's right and I believe this morning we're looking at him with our own eyes amen I believe that I don't believe the third pull is just abstract from the church amen but I believe we are a manifestation of that third pull I don't believe that the Bible is one thing and the church is another I believe we're on manifestation of that Bible I believe when you read that there will be a people who know their God I'm literally looking at a people who will know their God it's not just in the Bible this morning it's living in individuals who are filled with the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost Amen in the hour we're living in I tell you what if you would look at it as Bible prophecy if receiving the Holy Ghost you can see Joel chapter 2 said I shall pour out my spirit sayith the Lord and you could see the spirit poured out and you could say this is that that Joel prophesied it ought to do something to you because you're seeing God coming into action you ought to see it in Acts the 2 chapter when they were filled with the Holy Ghost if you could see that same thing take place it ought to do something to the church amen when God said he would heal the sick and these signs shall follow them that believe when you see that it should put you into action because it's God In Action when the people of God are in action amen no man can heal another man no man could save another man so it has to be God I believe it I believe it'll put you in action when you see the word of God fulfilled in your AG I believe it I believe that the pillar of fire met Paul and put him into action what did Paul do after that he went immediately and received the Holy Ghost and then went and preach the gospel it put him into action I believe that I believe if you see him in action it'll put you in action when you look at Jesus doing the word it ought to put you in action to believe that word could be fulfilled I think of the scripture in John chapter n a blind man that's what we were before we we met the Lord we were just blind we didn't know him but we knew we needed him and the Bible records a blind man meeting Jesus and and he goes to him amen and he's Desiring a healing but it's a powerful thing to see that Jesus met him at a certain place he met him at a certain time amen there was a reason that man was blind until that time somebody said well hey man the man was a sinner is his parents was a sinner and Jesus said no it's not true there's nobody s this was done for the glory of God Amen that his eyes might be open to give Glory unto God now look at what happened I I think it's powerful when you read it and you see that that Jesus met this blind man brother Steven met him at a certain place so there was an ordained meeting ground for Jesus and this blind man and when he met this man Jesus actually spit on the ground and took a certain portion of the Earth mud and put it in that Man's eyes well I'm one of them that believes that Jesus was the creator of this heavens and earth I believe he created the heavens and the earth I don't think that he was just another one I think he was the creator of it how many knows when God created the Earth he laid your bodies out in the dust amen he laid them out in the Garden of Eden that's why Adam was laying there as a tree in the ground until the life came into him and he came out of the ground so your body was in this dust the Creator laid you out in this dust he knew where you'd be born born white Place amen think about this blind man his body part of his body the eye was laying in that dirt until the Messiah met him in the right place at the right time and he took the dirt and put in his eye and gave him the substance that he needed to put the man into action for the Messiah in his age look when he received his side he ran into the City and they begin to question what happened to this man what took place to this man the Great leader said what happened he was a blind man unimportant to this moment but with his eyes open exploits had took place in his life and now he was under question what happened to you what doctor did you see how did this happen what took place amen and and and this man said Jesus healed me that's what happened to me Jesus healed me amen and they said well who is he he said you mean to tell me amen that you being the leaders of this of this religion and man healed me who was blind from his mother's womb and you don't know who he is and you don't you know your books and you know your things but you don't know him or you would know that no man could heal the blind save almighty God Amen his own parents was asking him they asked his parents what about it amen his parents wouldn't even take up for him brother Seth they said well ask the boy he's a full age I tell you ask him he can tell you he said well this is what I'm going to tell you amen I I believe it don't you I believe it speaks of a lot of things I believe adoption time comes amen amen I believe it I believe mature age you speak for yourself and they asked him what happened he said well I'll tell you this I was once blind and now I see and I didn't get it in your in your in your in your Creeds and I didn't get it through your organizations but I met this one who was rejected among you and he gave me his sight amen I tell you something this morning I have received spiritual sight from the almighty God and I know where it came from it came from the Messiah he hath anointed him to preach the gospel to Open the Eyes of the Blind and when the eyes of this man come open he went into action I believe if your eyes would come open to what you're in the presence of this morning I believe you'd go into action I believe if you could believe the Bible where it said wherever two or three are gathered in my name I will be there in the midst of them listen to me if you can open your spiritual eyes Jesus Christ the son of God is in this building this morning in power and manifestation I'm not a crazy man I'm a Biblical man I believe the Bible wherever two or three are gathered I'll be there a little while the world see me no more but you'll see me I'll be with you even in You Until the End of the Age either the Bible is true or it's not but if it's the truth you're in the presence of the Messiah Jesus Christ and he has never changed Hebrews 13 and8 said I am the same yesterday today and forever and what he did in one day he'll do it again or he isn't God if he saved a man he still saves if he healed he still heals I know people don't want to hear about a Healer today they think it's fanaticism but listen when Jesus was on Earth the first time they said he could heal but not save remember that they said he was a Healer and not a savior now they're trying to say he's a savior and not a Healer but I testify that the atoning blood of Jesus Christ is the atonement for my salvation it's the atonement for my healing and one of these mornings I'm not just going to get a healing of a cold or a cancer but my entire body will be healed in a change at the moment of the twick of an eye I believe in Rapture I believe in an atmosphere and anointing of the change of the body not just a historical God sure as long as he's in history everybody worships him but what about a God today what about Jesus Christ here today what if what if you would have been in Jerusalem when he come riding off of the hill on a white mule and everybody fanatically hollering and praising where would you have been sitting would you have been saying hosan hosan to the king or would you have been saying you got to quieten these people down amen we got to do something with these people Lord what are you going to do with them what are you going to do with them they saw Zachariah 9 riding in front of them they saw the Messiah in the presence and I say today we see in Acts chapter 2 right here in the Church of the Living God we see Joel chapter 2 right here in the Church of the Living God what are you going to do with the people when they see Bible prophecies come off of the page and enter into life woo brother gory worship him in another age but what about today people don't want it they don't want the embarrassment of it they don't want to be identified with this kind of God I want to be identified with him I want to be identified in his resurrection I want to feel his resurrection power I want to feel his resurrection and anointing this man got his eyes open and he went into action you can say well the brother Wayne that's back in the Bible what about in our season there was a man named John Ryan entered one of brother Ram's meetings he was a blind man he was a Catholic blind man sit in the middle of the meetings under discernment he saw the power of God come up in the prayer line he said I want my eyes to be open if Jesus is the same I want to receive healing and brother brandham looked into his life and told him who he was and where he was from and what he done for a living and he said thus sayth the Lord John you're going to be healed you're going to be healed of that blindness he walked back to his seat and sat down a little while he got back up and come back in the prayer line he said to brother brandham he said brother brandham he said he Saidi thought you said I was healed' he said brother John I thought you said you believ me he said but brother random I can't see he said John healing has nothing to do with that he said the healing is here he said all you got to do now is go and confess that word until that healing is manifested now that's not crazy that's the Bible Hebrews the third chapter amen the high priest of our confession hold fast by faith our confession remember that and John needed something to say he needed something to go into action with because he didn't know God like that but something gave him strength that Prophet said to him you I see you sin just go confess your sin that's all you got to do and John be to confess that for two solid weeks praise the Lord I'm Healed blind is about praise the Lord I'm healed amen what was it he had been given strength through a word that he couldn't understand but he believed it and because he took the word he received a healing in his eyes I don't understand everything that I know but I know there's a God I know he's the god of his word amen and if you can get past the Giants there's some honey and milk in this story hallu sure enough John two weeks later sitting in a barber chair and they was laughing at him heard you got a heal the other day he said that's right I did sitting there blinding his b that's that's right I did and about that time his eyes come open he jumped up from where he was sitting run down the run down the street praise God I'm healed amen praise God I'm Healed I tell you amen I want to say this morning thank God I'm saved amen you remember when you first got saved the Temptation didn't go away did it you was tempted after you started confessing your salvation even years later still tempted but you never give up your confession of Salvation amen do you you know that healing works the same exact way you do not have to lose your pain the same day you're healed but if you'll hold on to it somebody said well brother way if if God is this real and you guys believe us go down and empty the go out and empty the hospitals out well that's a good that's a good thought but it's just not biblical Jesus went to the pool of Bethesda Heen heal one man among the the multitude now now think about this you said well then then then why wouldn't God heal everybody in the hospital well let me ask you this go down to the barro this morning and preach the gospel and save everybody in that building you said well I can't do that and neither can you go to the hospital and heal every sick person but to them that were healing is ordained to that place where faith will find its resting place there's a healing there not every person is healed but Jesus Is A Healer not every person is saved but Jesus is a savior come on now every person you ever testified was was delivered but I have never quit preaching a delivering Jesus because somebody wasn't delivered it has nothing to do with the power of God Amen if you have faith all things are possible to them that believe he is a delivering God this morning he's a saving God I'm from Jonesboro Arkansas just about 30 miles from there hey man I I I was my my wife wife's grandmother was sitting in a meeting in Jonesboro Arkansas where there was a little color girl blind come from Memphis Tennessee completely healed in that meeting you know what you know what got heard of that meeting she heard that Jesus healed a blind man that morning and her Grandpa got her on a bus from Memphis and brought her to Jonesburg about an hour and a half drive there was so many people in that meeting there was more people in the meeting than there was in the city of Jonesboro Arkansas the meeting was bigger than the city the little girl being blind was out in the parking lot at night got separated from her Granddad couldn't find her way well they had slipped brother randam out of the back out of the back door had brought him in Disguise up to an ambulance and was praying for a woman that was dying the woman was healed brother B said I come up out of the ambulance was headed back to sneak to the platform he said if I got caught out in the parking lot it'd be a prayer line in the parking lot he said so I was sneaking back to get back in the building he said and I heard a little girl holling help me help me and he said I went over there and saw she was blind walking around the parking lot he said so I walked over he said until she would have to bump into me when she bumped into him I love it when she bumped into him she she said can you help me sir he said well what what do you need she said well I want to find my grandpa I got separated to him I'm on a bus here from Memphis and I'm here to get healed I and brother Bram said well he said now now what did you say you were here for she said well I come for I come to see the Healer he saidwell what do you mean the Healer she said well I read this morning about a man praying for the sick over here and and and it was on the radio I think actually and the blindness said there was a boy blind this morning was healed and I'm blind and I got my granddad to bring me here to this meeting so I could receive my side and brother BR said I I I I I looked at her with compassion and she didn't know who she's talking to so he said to her he said well listen sis he said you mean to tell me that you believe that story about an angel coming to that man and how healing would come and you believe all that she said absolutely sir she said let me tell you this if you'll get me to that man I'll find my own grandpa I won't need you anymore if you get me to that man because she knew that was a healing virtue coming out of that Ministry because it was ordained of the Lord to bring sight amen and brother Bram said he said I said to her honey I'm brother brandham and she reached up got him by the coat and held on to him and he began to pray for her brother her eyes come open right there in that parking lot now I I'll tell y'all this I don't want you to get offended at me but this is the truth he when he began to pray for her you know you know what his prayer was he said Lord right here is a granddaughter to the man that helped you up calvary's hill he said this is one of the granddaughters of the man that helped you pick up your cross when you were going up calvary's hill and she's here blinded tonight would you just open her side in memory of that man and her eyes come open brother B said amen when her eyes come open he said that's the last time I saw her he said she was running out through the parking lot thank God I'm Healed thank God I'm Healed I was blind and now I can see listen to me this morning I think it's time for the church to go into action I was blind but this morning I can see I was lost but I've been saved what happened to you his name is Jesus brother yeah I don't know what about the book of Isaiah what about it when Isaiah went into an encounter with the great Angel amen when he seen the presence of the Lord he covered his face he watched he watched Isaiah watched an Angel cover his face with two Wings cover his feet with two wings and then he flew with two wings that angel had six wings brother Ram says it like this he said that angel has been in the presence of God for the time of creation till that day of Isaiah if anybody knew how to enter the presence of God that angel knew how he said and he was showing the servant Isaiah how to come into the presence of God he said with two hand two two Wings he covers his face in in reverence and with two Wings he covered his feet with humility he said but the third set of wings put him in action and because Isaiah was humble and reverent before the presence of God his actions was the actions of God oh listen I believe this morning that if we were to reverence oursel to the Holy Spirit H humble oursel to the word of God then the action in the church now watch some people come in contact with God and they think that means let's go build a denomination let's go make an organization let's Feed the World Let's do let's build some hospitals those are tremendous things those are humanitarian things but that was not the commission of the Bible the Bible said that we should go into the world and preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ we should baptize them that believe the gospel amen and to them that believe should be filled with the holy ghost power and these signs shall follow them that believe they should go into the action of God I believe I believe it myself I believe it I believe this is the hour for action I believe it's the season for Action I believe this is the time for it can can I say this I believe we're close enough to home as our brother said I believe the immortal Waters of almighty God wave after wave are crashing into mortal Realms and they're washing up in the banks of mortality and we are here waiting in the immortal Waters by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are feeling the Life coming from another place we're enjoying the presence of God and I believe it's an hour if there ever was an hour to do something for the Lord I believe it's right now amen now I I think sometimes you hear things that you know but I believe Paul Peter said it like this we ought to to stir you up by putting you in remembrance to stare you up going in the Greek the word stare means to render into action we ought to put you into action by the things that you know it ought to it ought to make you go into action you you've read about him you've heard about him but when you get in that Spirit it ought to make you go into action you ought to be activated by it let mean let me give you an example of a woman in the Bible who was an illame woman and she came by the house of Simon one day and while Simon was had invited Jesus he was there but he wasn't entertained Jesus wasn't entertained he was only invited but there was a little woman come walking by and saw him sitting there unentertained remember remember the story in the Bible amen she ran to the house amen got everything she had MoneyWise and went down and bought some Alabaster oil and she come back to anoint the feet of Jesus to wash his feet now remember the story it's a powerful story but what made that woman think she could do that what made her do that what made her get into that amen I I believe that there was another little Harlot that she must have had some friendship with brother random said that they knew one another and there was a woman in the Bible who had been caught in adultery y'all remember the story she' been caught in adultery with a man and the Pharisees caught her and they drugg the man and the woman down to Jesus and threw the woman at the feet of Jesus and they quoted the word to him and they said the Bible the Moses law said that she should be stoned for adultery through threw right at the feet of Jesus and while she was there they said this is what the word says but what do you say I'll never will forget the first time I read that where Jesus knelt down and he never answered them he just knelt down and started writing in the sand I thought the god that knows everything I wonder what he wrote about the Pharisee and the sand cuz he looked up and said you that don't have any sin cast the first stone and remember what happens when they looked up the accusers were gone the accusers were were left and then it was just her and him and he said neither do I condemn you amen and he didn't write nothing else down amen I tell you you talking about that Lamb's Book amen there wasn't nothing else written down amen amen he just scratched it out because there was nothing written about her in him she was for ordained before the world began and at the feet of Jesus Amen we're judgment was supposed to happen Deliverance took place where judgment was supposed to be there she left a sinless woman she came she came in adulterous and she left a clean woman because Jesus didn't condemn her either now I guarantee you that girl went into action I guarantee she told every one of the harlots down there at the whale what had happened to her at the feet of Jesus Christ and that little girl amen that had the alabaster had been very much in knowah the story of that other woman and when she come walking by and seeing there was nobody at the feet of Jesus she said I know what happens at his feet I know what takes place at his feet I got to run and get something and she wouldn't got that Alabaster oh and man there's too much to preach in it but I think it's powerful she went right in the crowd amen she elbowed her way right in brother being she didn't care what anybody thought she didn't care how they felt that was Jesus she had a need and she had an opportunity and she elbowed her way in to get to his feet you know what she did that Alabaster oil they say is the most costly of all the oils and she had a whole bottle full of it brand new she had just bought it amen you know what she did she didn't open the top of that bottle and sprinkle his feet a little but the scripture tells us that she that she broke the top off of it she broke open the vessel you know why she did that because she was going to pour everything in it on him whatever she had saved was now going to be poured out on him let me say something this morning amen you might have been holding some things back from God for a long time but when you see him in his power it should be the moment that you take the reservations off and pour on him everything that you've been holding back I think you ought to Quick holding back I think you ought to get into action this morning you ought to say this is the Son of God this is the truth and I want to give my life to him it's a Time for Action brother Wayne I don't know can this even happen in our day listen I'm preaching to you this morning and I can confess to you and testify that he is the same Jesus this morning you home folk have heard me tell it let me just re me just retell this our musicians come I was in a prayer meeting one morning or a Sunday morning service actually I wasn't even speaking I was sitting on the sidelines that morning the pastor was gone we had a special guest preacher and I was sitting in there and after the brother got down preaching he went and sat down and my sister that had been uh suffering with a stroke had been there in the church that morning and and when she seen me with a mic she well we had a special relationship let's just put it that way she was a she was a believer she' backslid about 25 years and she went into some serious sin she she really she' really got in bad trouble and when she got ready to come back I went and seeing her at the hospital and and was testifying to her and she said to me she said brother Wayne She he said do you really think the people would let me come back to church they forgive me I said sister I said the bride of Christ is the most forgiven people in the planet if you just humble your heart and repent and seriously ask him to forgive you those people accept you like you never done anything to start with and sure enough it happened just like that so we were had a little special connection you know and uh I'd knew her since I was a baby I guess but that morning she she wanted prayer so she come up for prayer for a stroke she come got in the line when she come and stood in that line I put my hand on her and began to pray for her I got finished and I said now sis what you need to do is just go testify your healing you need to go testify about this go confess your healing according to scripture that's what it said to do and she said to me she said well brother Wayne I've got a daughter that's a nurse and she said now when I go home and I tell them that I'm Healed she's going to say Mom what are you lying for I said sis listen my Bible said let every man's word be a lie that the word of God stand true I said you just tell her honey mom's not lying I'm confessing I'm confessing what Jesus Christ has done for me she come back that night and it's the oddest feeling you've ever had when you're the one in the prayer line you prayed for someone that morning and they come limping down she come limping down the aisle for prayer I thought so I got up met her again I saidwell Lord you know there's nothing I can do but pray that's that's that's I can pray I can believe I can pray but God's got to do the work so I laid my hand on and began to pray for or was going to pray for her and she said to me I looked at her I laid my hand on I looked at her and said something about it she said no honey she said I want to come up here and testify that God had healed me and she just as crippled she was that morning she said I'd like to testify so when she did that I was preaching with a mic about like this and I went to hand her the mic to testify and there she was with that crippled I believe it was her maybe her right side but her arm was all crippled up just like this and when I went to hand her the mic she reached out and took a hold of that mic with that crippled hand I watched the I watched that crippled leg straighten right up and that sister danced all over the front of that [Applause] building Jesus is not dead that's right he's surely alive thank you Lord and he's here right here this morning could you stand to your feet
