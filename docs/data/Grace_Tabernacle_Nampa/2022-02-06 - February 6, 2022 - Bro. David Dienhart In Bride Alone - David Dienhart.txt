someone's got a nobel for the ones with little guys uh check your whatsapp we'll uh you'll you'll see what's going on there all right as we we're gonna we're gonna turn the service right over to brother brother david give him the extra time he needs let's sing this a little song it's 8 26. it's more of a prayer whiter than snow amen i trust this is our desire as we sing this lord jesus i long to be perfectly whole i want thee forever to live in my soul break down every idol cast out every foe now wash me and i shall be wider than snow wider than snow yes wider than snow now wash me and i shall be wider than snow lord jesus looked down from thy throat in the skies and helped me to make a complete sacrifice i give up myself and whatever i know now wash me and i shall be wider than snow

flow now wash me and i shall be wider than snow whiter than snow wider than snow now wash me and i shall be wider than snow lord jesus thou seest i patiently wait come now and within me a new heart

receive from above o glory my soul is made perfect in love my prayer has prevailed and this moment i know the blood is applied i am wider than snow oh wider than snow yes wider than snow now wash me and i shall be wider god bless you [Music] you believe you can be whiter than snow how many is whiter than snow amen why the washing of the water of the word amen amen amen the washing of the blood amen life comes through the blood no other way does god's life come but through the blood that's the only way it comes so the way it can come and the life in that blood is the token you can claim to believe the blood all you want but until you have the token you know have no identification that you believe and have faith in that blood that's a striking statement isn't it but that's the truth amen god bless you i think i'm here with songs did you get that the token is the identification that you have come through the blood it's the only identification and it's the required identification today you're not making a rapture without the token the token is the literal life of jesus christ that will recognize the word promise for the hour and live it amen amen so that that's what comes through the blood there's a lot of professors that believe in the blood but no token you see there's something that follows the baptism of the holy ghost we know the baptism of the holy ghost is the new birth how many know that the baptism of the holy ghost made way for the holy ghost himself to come right down in perfection again back to the word where would he be found today in mary where would he be found today in the bride she had a revealed mystery that only she knew amen i'm not going to preach on paul's message but i i had that already to preach and he preached my message now that's how close it is but i want to carry on maybe with something on that a little bit here and i want to title this sermon this morning in bride alone in bride alone the mystery was revealed as it was in mary so is it in the bride alone by the same power only that's a natural birth this is a supernatural birth leading to a natural supernatural body amen are you with me that's waiting for us amen but unless we come through that union first we'll never be there amen that's right you've got to have the token that can may not be overemphasized revelation of the word amen in you living it's a little stone living remember the capstone and i'm going to say this is way ahead of my message here but the capstone was in the pyramid it wasn't till the seventh angel's message was that capstone revealed you say well it's been revealed all the way through that's right we knew who the capstone was but now we see who he is and what form he said he would be in to rapture a church in this hour it's still his working amen it's his working it's his doing amen it's his it's not anything that we could do but it's grace a headstone coming with crying grace grace unto it unto what who's crying who's crying grace grace it's the grace of god you see we have life we are elect with life we have a little stone a revealed word in us living word we are the living word we are eternal life made manifest in human bodies time bodies you see that's pretty rough statements brother david that's pretty straight but it is straight but that's what the message is today the seventh seal is revealed but it's not known to the public it's only known to her alone and now you know where we're going amen i want to read something to you before i take the scriptures but before we do let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer our heavenly father we thank you that you are here hallelujah you are here to feed the bride you are here because you and your bride are becoming one for the wedding supper as you pour yourself into her they are becoming one for the great celebration that we're looking forward to and are caught away and are meeting in the air because at that time the wedding supper follows we're so thankful for this great union lord this secret union this spiritual union lord of the coming son lord we're so thankful for this great time that we have in this hour because we know that the message of the seventh angel was the revealing of those seven seals it was the third pull we know it was the opening of the word and father people may say brother david you're too deep but there's one thing i'm doing i'm sowing seed lord it's got to take life your word will never return to your void but it will accomplish what you've sent it to do lord and i'm praying that this seed is sown is sown in the right ground that can receive that he that has an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches lord we've had a a great unveiling a full unveiling a complete revelation of the word given to us things that those in the ages longed for to see lord the apostles those things were hid they spoke of it's not out of the word it's in the word but lord the full revelation hadn't come out yet but lord in this hour we're carrying that revelation we're bearing your name now father i ask you to take these lips of clay and you speak for i can do nothing in my own self i need you lord and i'm so thankful that you're present and you're ready to not only anoint my lips to speak your words and i'm expecting you to speak and speak what the message has spoken because lord there's a bride today who is under her messenger the final voice that's what that's what joseph that's what god vindicated to joseph that mary had that voice lord she had to voice that out and it was unusual to him but you backed it up and you vindicated that voice to be your voice and so father here we are today with a great revelation unfolding to a body change that's what we expect it to do lord because rapture has begun in the heart of your bride we thank you lord that it's changing us from glory to glory he's changing me hallelujah i can't get enough of it father it just is overwhelming sometimes but lord i'm on to you and asking you to speak your thoughts this morning not mine open hearts to receive it in here may we leave here raised to a higher plane we ask these things in thy name the lord jesus christ amen amen they're speaking about the subject the capstone revelation of the creation of god or the capstone revelation of the whole thing now that's that's a powerful statement you say brother david to take a stand like that and speak a word like that it would be pretty powerful but we have a powerful message and it's so powerful it's going to change our mortal bodies and it is little by little we're possessing the land amen the land's been opened to us brother sister what are you going to do about this jesus called christ amen that's the land possess all he is amen amen he gave it to us he's open we noticed the angel standing in revelation 10 2 with an open book and the prophet said this sword was put in my hand but he said it was the word he said it he said it was the word in the hand amen we saw a mighty angel stand with a word open book in his hand now in that book contains revelation that's been sealed since the foundation of the world that could not be opened until the seventh angel's message brother brown said the third poll is this is revelation 10 is the third pole it's the message of the seventh angel and the message of the seventh angel was the seventh seal you say brother david it's the secret that's exactly right it's opened in secret amen are you with me these things sound foreign but if you've been in the word it's not a foreign thing to you and the thing is you better start feeding on the word or you're missing the going home of the bride because we have a bride coming of christ taking place right now and that's the fulfillment of the scriptures of the whole revelation of jesus christ taking place and it climaxes in a body change and that moves right from there into a millennium we are taken amen there's got to be something to transform this bride there's got to be something in her that brings forth that son because he promised he would come through the woman hello you say what mary more than mary it's the bride in the end time amen amen hallelujah because it's him again it's the seed again it's bride time it's the bride time of that seed that full seed has to come to manifestation let me get through this message a lot faster you know my printer stopped working i can hardly read what i got on notes i told i told her i was really tore up in my spirit but i thanked the lord i had ruth and diane pray for me coming down the road and brother prayed for me and i just the holy spirit just dropped just a few moments ago prayer it just dropped all is well i may never touch my notes but i'm going to speak my heart i can back it up what the prophet said i can back it up in the word and we know i got a picture right this thing's been unfolding all the way from genesis brother sister the seventh seal is no new thing it just hid but he's gradually unfolded it down through the ages he was unfolding it until it's capstoned right here in the day in our hour and it's amazing to us but the caps known as christ but what form is he in today is what fools the people and he's manifested himself and he's done that for a purpose so we could meet him physically in a rapture we'll see him how many know we're going to see him in a body caught up in the air to meet him but before that time there's a union takes place she has to the bride has to conceive that life amen that's exactly it's our spirit see there's natural spiritual all the way through this brother bam said it was a natural bride a natural see and then a spiritual which is greater the natural or the spiritual that's the real that brings about a natural change a supernatural change in a natural body amen all right now let's i just want to get too closer ahead of myself but in the bride alone you might as well just get that in your heart right now this secret mystery that god has unveiled to us in this day is only known to the bride you say well you know who it is no i don't but i know i'm one of them because i have the promised identification of this hour seeing it not only revealed but lived through me amen it's not it's more than just an anointing brother sister it's the word himself unveiled in your soul many can be anointed we already said that you know that can be anointed cast out devils speak in tongues prophesy shout and never see the word for the season that's right that's anointed one's the end time you know that false anointed their anointing is the holy spirit but they're faults on the inside they're trying to produce something that's outside of the word that's right oh they're doing great things they're doing good works and they shout and they prophesy but they'll never see the word promised for the season and never be able to live that word and when we try to we try to do anything through a see see our warfare is not carnal it's not intellectually taught you don't deliver people by intellectual talk things it comes through the word because our warfare is not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds bringing every thought in our spirit realm it isn't it isn't the it isn't the product of a man's mind his teaching that brings deliverance in our spirit it's the word and you try to do it any other way you're going contrary to the word because you're trying to produce something to a carnal learning that will never produce life and never produce the truth so you might as well get away from that and start feeding on life and get into an open book and start feeding on that open word and let your psychology go amen that was free all right i want to bring something here brother brown says on the first first seal paragraph 43 i think 3 20 63 is the first either first or second seal but it's 3 20 63 and when he takes this oath seven thunders utter their voices and when john was taken up was supposed to write what he saw and he started to write it down and said don't write it don't write that he said seal it up something was uttered brother brahms they didn't utter for nothing it's got to happen but he said you seal it up even daniel seal the words in the book daniel they cannot be open till the time of the end the words in the book and the prophet said this little bride today happens to be the words in the book amen and so and so he said and he said don't write it seal it up and then brother branham said what in seal it up what in now we know the bible said when these things were these things were done they were sealed up but they were sealed up where in earth and vessels amen that's exactly where the seal that's what sealed it it couldn't be opened see all them preached paul preached laid the foundation brother said i preached what paul preached but you know paul didn't have the revelation of these seven thunders he wrote about it but it's still to be unfold it's not out of the words why i'm trying it's in the word brother madam says this is not something out of the word it's hid in the word it's been hid it's been hidden god's back part of his mind and could not be revealed what was in the back part and purpose he had the full purpose until the angel's seventh angel's message amen so see without us they can't be made perfect because the full revelation of the word never came until the seventh angel's message because there was saying sealed up in fact john never wrote it the book of revelations wasn't even written yet when they were here in the first sages it was written by john that they had it writing in the ages but paul never had that writing of john never had the book yet amen what's the seal sealing the book of redemption the full redemption the full redemption revelation of jesus christ and if you'll ever get a hold of who you are it'll change your thinking and you'll let go of the things of this world amen all right so he so he said he took they said what in seal it up seal it up don't say it it's to be revealed don't say it it's to be revealed and he says now we stand justified in christ before him you know what justified means declared righteous we stand declared righteous before christ before him because he cannot pass judgment for he's already judged that body which i am a part of amen what part of the body am i christ's own body i'm not talking about physical i'm talking about the mystical body of jesus christ the word living amen it's manifest in human bodies yes when he comes in and identifies it he owns this body that's right it is all right so then the blood purchased that all right so then here we are we're justified in christ before him because he cannot pass judgment for it he's already judged that body which i'm a part of what he said how am i a part of it here it is it's in me he said here it is it's in me he said seal it up don't say it it's to be revealed now where is it it's in me where was the capstone brother bam said it was in the pyramid sealed amen i i got that quote right here i can anybody wonders where i where i'm getting these ideas we can tell you all right so it's not it's not some intellectual that sounds like a good quote i'll plug it here it's the inspiration of the holy spirit to take this over here put this over here it brings us over here and it's the picture and it flows right with the word amen so so he said see it's in me he said what how am i part of it it's in me see he said it's in me he said if you abide in me and my word in you you know what the prophet followed that in the message perfect faith then he said you know who you are if you abide in me and my word in you then you know who you are it's always the soul that controls the spirit that's why i said you can't control it any other way you're gonna be what you are in your spirit and you try to change that spirit another way brother paul said you bring your spirit under obedience every thought that's a spirit realm at your emotion realm you bring every spirit under obedience to the word and you try to bring it under obedience to something else what are you doing going contrary to the word these things our warfare is not carnal man's ideas man's thinking man's learning you don't learn it amen and the soul controls the body so what are we trying to control the spirit with something else outside of what's in that soul then get the soul changed and it'll control the spirit and the spirit will control the body then you're gonna see the word made manifest in flesh your deliverance doesn't lay in man's thinking it lays in the word amen the devil is subtle he'll make things look so reasonable but it was reasoning that made it fall you're biting off of the tree amen don't let that dominating female spirit govern you that's absolutely right you see that offended me i'm sorry it's be offended i'm i have to say some things here it may have very well offend you but look to the word that dominating female is a is a dominating spirit of denominationalism will always go back to the carnal it'll know the word carnally it can say the word carnally that has no revelation of the hour and the time so always revert back to man amen i don't know why i'm i don't i'm saying this wasn't in my notes at all amen all right here it is it's in me he said it's in me if he abide in me he goes right back to scripture if you abide in me and my word in you identified then you're identified oh he says oh the devil is howling about this i've heard him howl pretty loud today and yesterday and the day before coming up to this message he hates this the carl the carnal man the carnal thinking the carnal mind hates it too because it's out of your ordinary thinking and reasoning it's up in the realms above this realm it's in revelation any revelation that hasn't been vindicated by the word is the wrong revelation everybody's got their revelation but if the revelation is not vindicated by the word and god identifies it through the word it's the wrong revelation but when your revelation comes that god immediately takes you right back to the word right back to what the prophet said and there it is and there it is and there it is and there it is now you're seeing your picture right that's the truth all right we have a perfect interpretation of the word and don't you think for a minute god's word comes to his prophets don't you let anything belittle you in thinking that that's not absolute that word was put in his hand what are we going to do with it dominating female spirit will come in i didn't come to preach that sermon but i got it to preach lord willing sometime it's a denominational spirit of nicolaitanism balaamism it's idolatry and god hates it it's the seeds of the catholic church and it tries to worm itself right among the message a lot could be said right there but i'll just hold that back he said that's what the devil's howling about this the manifested truth of the promise of the word in her alone listen to me again identified he said the devil's howling about this the manifested truth of the promised word in her alone that's what he howls against that's what all the hell is against because jesus said i'll build my church upon the revelation of myself then what will it come when it comes to the building when it's the building is completed the revelation of the word was the completion of the building it'll be the capping off time what would it be it would have to be himself in bright form amen the devil don't want this he just say oh that that's just some far out kind of idea you call it far out if you want but it's so far out it's out of the carnal thinking amen it's in the word his own thinking and his church stands alone she's not hooked up with nothing she's not hooked up with nothing i'll say it again be careful what you're hooked up with she's not hooked up with nothing to her it's the word that settles it right she doesn't have to take some carnal idea some carnal thinking some reasoning and learning of man to bring forth a producer something to give deliverance it's the word that gives the deliverance and it's in your mouth don't you let the devil reason you out of that i'm you'd well i won't say any more about it that part let's say time to wake up but she'll wake up men time to take care of controller of your families bring them under the headship of the word i hope you hope you know the unwritten spoke unspoken word there now he said brother david you keep preaching like that nobody's going to want to hear you it's all right but i come to preach it i love it and i know god loves it don't have to look and say well i don't like the way you preach they didn't like the way john preached either and they didn't like the way jesus looked on with anger and braided ropes either and they don't like any of the preachers either they didn't like elijah either you're the troublemaker or paul or any of them brother branham called him a high-tempered jew i'm sure he lost a lot of that high temper but i'll tell you what if he was the preaching he didn't preach with just little theories he told them the truth do you believe the word are you willing to follow the word then take communion yeah you say brother david you shouldn't preach like that i'm telling you you claim to be a believer in fellowship with this word why aren't you partaking of what god said in his commandments three things he said to command for you to do foot washing communion baptism water baptism and until you do that you have not come under the full obedience to the word and you can't take that communion unless you're in fellowship with him so it's showing you up if you won't take it you have no part with him and if you take it unworthily then you did you're you're bringing damnation upon yourself you've got to have the token you've got to have the holy ghost amen i don't like your preaching well that's all right pray for me i'll pray for you but that's the truth if you don't believe it go to communion 1965 go to the other communion see what he said you're coming there because it's a divine revelation that you're a part of him and you're a part of one another and you're in fellowship with him and you say you're a believer of this message he won't line up with the word what kind of belief do you have well i was taught another way then you're listening to a false teacher because paul didn't preach it neither did brother brown preach that this due in remembrance of me till i partake with you anew at the wedding supper i didn't know it would come like this god knows brother sister i maybe not get to this message i just i don't know god just keeps bringing me back around line up with the word it's this this is rapture time what if it's too late what if the door's already shut but if you have that tug in your heart for more of god you better run as quick as you can into his presence and start feeding on life instead of books that's right i'm talking about other books the one book we ought to feed on was sealed with seven seals why don't you find out what he said because you've got your mind on other things that take importance over going home going in a rapture it's idolatrous it's an idolatrous spirit that would take place position you anything above him that's the truth i know i know it's hard preaching isn't it it's hard preaching some even go to sleep while i'm preaching i'm going to preach it anyway because it's going on record i have to answer it someday and i don't want to i don't want you to point your pointy finger at me and tell me you didn't tell me the truth because someday i'm going to stand there with those words before you again i want to give witness to that yes lord i was the one that said that that's what they heard we're just not here to play around we don't play church we don't come because everyone people are going to think of us if we don't come to church it's a love affair all right and the howling devils howling because it's being revealed this is what he's saying he said and this church stands alone she's not touched with anything he was identified by god being the body that god dwelled in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing doing the same thing she is his body whoa she is his body she's him she's him brother sister she's him it's not some little off something thing here he said he said the bible is the complete revelation of jesus christ he said see it is his body what's the bride his body the complete revelation of him okay i haven't got to my scriptures yet this all come out a little bit quicker let's just keep moving because that these scriptures will bring it out haven't you read the scriptures yet isn't that something oh you're out of order all right [Music] the last day she alone stands by it amen she stands by it and this great organizations are set up to close her up she'll never be closed up she'll be taken up amen she is now risen by the power of the vindicated word promised to her she has now risen by the power of the vindicated word promised to her what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is i personally have raised from death to life it's already begun working what a resurrection this is amen amen amen all right how the bible holds that promise he told me he would return after me i believe it do you believe it amen we ought to lay in the word of it because he himself stepped forth and took the book hello who opened it a lion when he turned around he saw the lamb that was worthy to open it but his thunder and roar was god speaking out and when he did seven thunders uttered their voices what were those seven thunders the mysteries contained the revelation contained in the seals and that book contained names amen and those names had to be revealed claimed because he redeemed them but unless the book was opened unless the title deed was open no one would know what they owned and and what he didn't come to claim what he owned it would have been lost are you with me you don't realize what a great thing god's done in this day and we're a part of you say how many years down the line because we had to lay in the presence of the sun to ripen how can there be a marriage if the sun hasn't come amen we gotta lay in his presence to ripen to take the greenness out of us get all this denominational thinking and ideas out of our mind amen well i think well i think well i think god tell us what he thought and we don't have a free thought coming somebody can turn their phone off all right god bless you you just forgot like we all do okay praise the lord don't interpret that alex okay that's all it was okay no no no no i don't mean that to be harmful or hurtful as i said we all forget it i'm telling you well i say that they'll probably misunderstand so all right see christ that's it christ the word he was the word he's the word and the church becomes a word by making him a part of him making her excuse me a part of him and that's the word again personally identified by him his property alone his property alone she is redeemed by him and for him amen that's what the devil's howling about it's being revealed turn with me to matthew 24. i'd like you to stand with me and i'll read this one scripture now we're just getting started with this service those that are taping it that was a prelude you heard the beautiful music hear the songs amen are you ready for the word i've given you a word already but i'm matthew 24 verse 3 starting i want to refer back to what brother branham preached in 1962 12 62 9 12 30 i believe it was is this the sign of the end sir question sir asking god remember how he's questioning god what is this what is this is this a furthering of my ministry does this mean i'm going what is this he said is this the sign now remember they asked jesus three questions the last questions matthew 24 3 is that now verse 3 it says he sat upon as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what should the things be other words the temple the the destruction of the temple he said when will these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and and the sign of the end of the world are you following me okay brother brown preached a message called sirs is this this excuse me he said he titled different things in there but but in the in the book and the way he titled it was this is this the sign of the end sir amen brother branham made it very clear the sign of the end was the opening of the seventh seal he said the reason those seals when they opened up and that seventh opened it showed us we have arrived we have arrived this is the end now in the end we've been here 50 years what i'm saying the end meaning it was done right then but this is the time what is the sign of the end and he told us what it was and he said we have arrived and that's after those denominations denominate and the life leaves the shuck and they put the word out then the seals are opened up seven thunders utter their voices to someone and it was ordered to john and he knew it and he was the type of the bride and it was the seventh angel's message to reveal what those thunders said because that was an unwritten word in revelations 10. don't put it as an unwritten word through the whole bible because brother branham said it's been opened up by god gradually all the way through the bible he'd been letting his mystery that he had in the back part of his mind opened up but he said we couldn't see it until the seventh angel's message because he being a prophet came with the revelation of it it took a prophet to reveal it do you understand what i'm saying he played the part he had to have the book and brother braham said that the the lamb stepped forth and put it in the hand of his seventh angel to give it to the people oh oh then then who where'd we see the lamb he was already showing the sign who was it the revealing of the son of man making himself known and he said but i'm going to return to you in the time of life the word will come to you again amen see we have the day of sodom is that right that was to be at the end time all right then we see what he said there turn to matthew 24 or matthew shoot me again 24 and verse 27. for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so also shall the coming of the son of man be he's coming unveiling his word from east to west are you with me it rises in the east sets in the west and and and remember he said now he said being that that see we have that setting all right all right i mean that's setting in time then he says for wheresoever the carcasses are the body word of the son of man he said you're not feeding on a man you're feeding on the body word of the son of man he said he said wheresoever the carcasses there will the eagles be gathered together you want to know where the eagles are that's where they are they're not in this church and that church they're spread around the world but they're together under one headship they're together under one feeding they're together under the promised word of the hour and it's the revelation that unites them together they will be together someday but they're together now because they're all in christ amen amen all right so there will the eagles be gathered together wherever that message of the third pull is they're going to be feeding on that open book that's the body word fresh manna in due season spiritual food in due season i don't care how much of a of a famine is out here and how much this is going on that's going on we have spiritual food in due season all right now he said immediately after now he goes right immediately after the tribulation of those days so the shun be done what tribulation he identified it he identified and remember he's speaking to israel here he's speaking to his disciples is that right but in this we gather our time of where we're at he's speaking to israel here and he's telling immediately after the tribulation of those days what days eichmann hitler brother man called it a pre-tribulation on them is that right people gave their life they were slaughtered they were wounded they were killed everything is that right okay and he said and and then all the tribes of the earth shall mourn excuse me as medially after the tribulation of the day shall the sun be darkened the moon shall not give her light the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of heaven shall be shaken so we see then something is moving in this time and here in the same time here comes a message here comes a messenger out of the of of the pentecostal move hidden way back in there coming up through that is that right the seventh messenger and the same time these things just after their finish then he comes now watch and then see because it's not only pertaining to israel but the gentiles are in this involved in the scriptures here and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven oh wonder what we saw wonder if we've seen the sign of the son of man the appearing what is that cloud ring on mount sunset it's a fulfilling of scriptures the prophet said it's a fulfilling of the word who is it we saw his picture was taken amen where was who was that our head or wasn't it uh-huh he had to go up in that consolation to get the revelation of that seventh seal and come back and tell us all right are you with me so who is it speaking our lord up there quickening power lets us see his coming the mystery of the seven seals the mystery of his coming absolutely doesn't all the alcohol is coming is it out there when we meet him in the air it happens to be his coming is going on right now because there had to be a fulfillment of scripture and he had to come to produce it and that's the bride coming of christ out of dark denomination a rapture out of that we had a first maturity son come to maturity full manifestation showing the others would come amen there had to be in order to fulfill the mystery in order for those sealed what spocial said there had to be a fulfillment of genesis again for the millennium as you can go back and find right in genesis the seventh seal mystery and we'll refer to that brother brown refers to it often over and over amen and he plays that whole thing right out because god had a heart purpose he has a full purpose that he wants to achieve and he said i'm going to hold it i'm going to withhold it because if i reveal that to john then it'll all be messed up my plan satan will get a hold of it but if i do it at the end there's no way he can get a hold of it too late we don't realize what kind of people we're privileged people to be here in this hour to be a witness to be a true witness to be a true manifestation we are his thought manifested god when he spoke this message he revealed those in the book that revelation in there was the revelation of god in flesh in bride form and he revealed every name that was in that book is your name there you know it because that mystery is revealed to you personally that's what the devil's howling about hallelujah amen it's being revealed being opened it's been open and as she feeds on it it comes closer and closer what is it what's happening she's taking a rapture moving towards that fi she's marching right in step with the word not going down going up just like enoch one step at a time was in the light he just kept rising higher and higher and that's what's happening to you i wonder if you could tell me are you rising higher and higher what's happening to you day by day is his mercies new to you every morning great is his faithfulness is the word continued to open up i never saw that before there it is all right 27 where am i 30 29 oh 20. oh oh i'm off my there i got to turn a page all right and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn why would the tribes tribes start mourning why because they're going to be brought to their day of atonement they're going to realize what they did he's revealed to them now but first there's a revealing to someone else that's the secret in that book there's a little interval right here because he reveals all six seals then between the sixth and the seventh chapter brother ram said there's something's happened and in order for her israel to get her message gentiles have to be taken out of here what produced it what produced the rapturing faith what brought it forth it lays right in the message of the seventh angel amen you see why i can't finish this today don't you i'm not even off the first page i guess it's all right me then i guess i i just have to come back for the next 10 services and finish it if i'm going to break it down the only way i can amen but i'll go as far as we can what time is it oh i still got lots of time about two hours yet got you to smile anyway okay so he said i'm still i keep flipping that page for some reason all right must be the wind something supernatural i can't do it now all right and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory okay then and he shall send his angels too something's bypassed right here we see the six we see the fifth seal we see the sixth seal in israel receiving their message that's their seventh trumpet where's our seventh seal brother braham said the seventh seal and the seventh trumpet are the same ones to the gentiles the others to israel are you with me something something because now he's going on watch what he's saying he said then he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet that's revelations 11. two witnesses what happened to the gentiles here see see with a great sound of a trumpet and they and because they're asking him questions what's the sign of your coming we've seen the sign of his coming and it's a great uniting time sign hello what about our uniting times sign it was a sign of him uniting with who his bride a marriage and they that went through their pentecost were made ready and went in with him to the wedding supper or to me went in with him to the marriage amen that right the marriage becomes before the wedding supper amen they went in been with him some were left out those that didn't have oil were left out because they couldn't see the message they thought you were just too deep hello you're just talking riddles you're too deep you know you can't cake it that deep you just need to you just need to get the holy ghost it won't be so deep it'll be too simple then that's the truth i'm not talking the riddles with you that's the truth without the holy ghost you'll never see the message of the hour you must be born again in order to be born again our pastor took that right back to the quote in church age book only the seed can be reborn only the elect you have to have that seed planted in you before the world began you who are part of him in his thinking of himself before the world began you always were alive you know that you know that you were always alive i know i'm keeping you standing but just stand a minute you know you are always alive but then you come into the world of sin and came born in a body and you were asleep to life it took something to awaken you just like awakened lazarus lazarus come forth loud voice hello said lazarus what if he said bride what if he called your name what if he called the mystery of himself which is your name what if he called that but that voice of that resurrection which is now the bride in this hour has that voice mary was the voice of that revelation in her amen and it manifested i'm not talking about having a revelation you do nothing well just go out and live the world i'd go to church and i'm fine i go out and live the world and i know where's the revelation of the word in your life where is it manifesting it's got to manifest it's not you make up and work up and pump it up it's got to manifest itself automatically because that's the characteristic of the holy spirit it'll manifest the word for the hour for the time it can't live something else amen amen amen you're gonna bear that fruit what fruit the fruit of the season when somebody comes along preaching another season another fruit you know it's not right who discerns that david dean hart with his great intellects no the word revealed in me jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i was always him i was always a part of him i existed in the thoughts of him those thoughts of him are eternal i was eternal in him there had to be an awakening because i was deep in sleep i wasn't dead you can't be alive in eternity and now be dead that's eternal separation but you were dead in sin trespasses it hid it hid you from him you lost your position you bypassed your theophany amen amen you bypassed it but then when you're born again you begin to hear from it and it's real and it exists and it's alive and it's a living stone and it's jesus christ and it's me mama it's me i look in the mirror of this open word and i can't see another person i see who i am and he sees who he is and he is she and she is him and he said he sent his angels this is a message going to the 144 000 revelation 7 revelations 11. but in between that is revelations 10. the message to the church but it opens up not to the public it opens up to secret within secret in her hid brother branham said god he said unveiling of god how could he preach a sermon like that the mighty god unveiled the unveiling of god like he just said oh the um god is just unveiled he said little children little seed you elect god's come in full view of you amen amen are you with me come full view of you hid okay i'll let you be seated in just a minute and he shall send his angels they shall gather his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other that elect is elect israel not bride brother branham identified that angels as two witnesses is that right he tied that right in with two witnesses of revelation 11. angels plural with the sound of one trumpet [Laughter] amen are you with me all the trumpets sound under the sixth seal to israel they're gathering in the lands under the sixth seal amen their their their position in the land is the sixth seal the tribulation is a sixth seal amen amen it's judgment it's a judgment seal and we see judgment striking beginning to strike how close are we to a body change because right in between here is a mystery being unveiled is a mystery being revealed it's the bride going home and the world says oh i don't get it we don't see it where is it she sees it she sees it i'll be with you even in you you'll see me you'll see me amen all right and then you go on here to the to the now he says learn a parable of the fig tree now speaking of israel when the fig tree putteth forth are buds amen what's going to be the sign of your coming what's the sign of what's the sign what's the sign showing it's coming he showed it here and now the time showing the time of end now watch he said now when you learn the parable of a fig tree when he put when his branch is yet tender and put it forth leaves you know that summer is nigh so likewise when you shall see all these things know that it is near what is near what is near well it's coming to israel and the end are you with me what is near his coming and the end the end hadn't come yet amen but it's close and you're seeing this fig tree putting forth their leaves brother brandon made it very noted to us when you see israel coming in he said there's got to be a message come right directly to the bride amen okay so we see a sign that they're coming in it's a sign and you know the time is getting close my coming i'm going to unveil i'm going to these two witnesses i'm going to i'm going to start i'll reveal myself to you but first whisper a little secret i've got to get my bride i got to go get her she's got to come out of that thing and she's going to be the full revelation and manifestation as it was in adam she'll be the mystery of myself and the world's going to know nothing about it churches won't know anything about it and the carnal won't know anything about it and only the elect because they're seed and when they have a new birth they'll be changed just like adam and sarah i mean abraham and sarah i didn't intently do that i just come out wrong but good adam and sarah all right abraham and sarah he had to have a name change and his name was changed because a victory had been won he had waited patiently in faith for that promise to come and he said i'm going to meet that promise and when they had their little change come over him they went down to abemelic now let me just back up you can be seated i'm not going to finish it with you standing i could now brother jason you keep us standing sometimes too so anyway i love that brother anyway he knows that and i love you all and i hope you know that i may get a little loud a little gruff but you know what god chose i'm gonna i'm just gonna send someone out there like that that's gonna it's gonna blow them away there's outward expressions and they're gonna judge me by the outward expressions and that's not what i'm judging by hello hello anybody say amen to that yourself personally okay where was i oh yes abraham and sarah i'm adamant i mean abraham and sarah all right good name adam you're part of the mystery right from the very beginning there was a second adam muddiner and something came out and something came out of that bride right there that met the met the requirement of the day she he had to come because satan got to eve first before adam did the natural woman and corrupted her seduced her by reasoning you see why the bible says you stay away from reasoning you start taking this word and let the word start judging your life and start ruling your wife and your life and your wife and your home with the word she wasn't made to be the head of your house amen takes discernment takes the holy ghost to tell the difference amen all right because you're commanded to keep your home in order that devil's so subtle i'm back on it again aren't i the devil is so subtle you'll come in such reasoning it looks wonderful it looks right silly women laden with divers lust and ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth from such turn away you better check what you're doing with the word all right getting back to abraham and sarah they received their pentecost they were changed getting back to adam and eve you know what let's just read these scriptures first i want to finish this if i don't get anything else done but those two points and read my scriptures then i'll have to probably have to cut it back i'm starting to get laid here let me finish matthew here first i'll come back to this learn a parable of fig tree verily verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass what generation the generation that sees israel become a full nation brother branham said in 1963 or two one he said she just recently become a full nation beyond 47 now she had her own army she had her own currency she had everything she did she was a declutteration declaration of a nation back there but she fully became a nation you go back and search it i don't have the quote right in front of me but he said she just recently about 1961 i think you've even referred to it he said just fully became a nation her own battles her own flag everything all right established in among the nations as a nation all right now he said this generation will not pass until these things be fulfilled what things something's going to be fulfilled here and the thing's not going to end without me coming to you bro to to you bride and israel so see we're very close to our body change okay but we've had to lay in the presence to get the to get the greenness out of us now watch he said verily i said okay heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away now watch what he says but of that day and hour knoweth no man they didn't know it now here's the sign is this the sign of the end sir is this the sign of the end is something coming out that no one knows is this what the father has held secret in his mind since the beginning before the foundation of the world that he would loose is this is this it sirs jesus said himself the man he said i don't know only the father knows when this is going to take place brother braham said notice when jesus turned to the seventh seal it was a secret and when he revealed it under the seventh seal when he spoke it it was still a secret but he said it will be revealed as they have need of knowing it and he said and he said and he did he did he went right there and and if you want message that he revealed it in is christ the mystery of god revealed he explains the secret even told that this seventh seal is in a three-fold manner and he tells us the threefold i've got this all down in this message further amen it's all unveiled in a threefold purpose a threefold manner he said and he revealed it he said it's the mystery it's the secret that no one knew but i'm going to i'm going to make it known i'm going to tell you my revelation he couldn't until that time because when it opened again at this opening of the seventh seal and brother braham said notice the lamb opens it it's not a shut seal it's an open seal and when he did he said the seven thunders uttered their voices amen he said now i've got i've got something i want to read here i'm going to try to find a place that i can start closing off but he said i want you to notice here sirs is this the sign of the answer as it was in the days of noah so shall the becoming of the son of man a mystery a secret brother brown said it's his coming now watch i want to get to that quote here real quick let me just say something here because if i don't get to that portion you're going to leave you hanging i've got it way back in this message yeah now those seven voices never uttered for nothing brother brown said there will be seven of these thunders that will reveal the great revelation at that time a member of my mess my title is in her alone amen great is the mystery in her alone christ in you makes you the complete revelation full of complete cleave he's full the complete or full revel the seventh seal was the full revelation of himself and he said and that's those seven thunders are going to be known by somebody before the body change amen amen it's got to be revealed he said and he said he said it's revealed now watch he said he said no wonder he said it wasn't even written it written where now see it sounds like brother brahma said you won't find it written anywhere no you won't find it written in the opening of revelation 10. it wasn't written but it's in the word because brother brown said god can't do that if there's a revelation laying in there which there is because he said the seven thunders are the revelations contained in the seven seals oh you said but that won't be known yes it is known the bride's going to know it because it's opening the book it's opening the message and you're the message see it's a love affair it's coming to her personally it's individual to you it's not the groups he's gone it's not church anymore brother graham said it's not church it's the bride this is the bright age this is the raptured age this is bride time let's be glad and rejoice the marriage of the lamb has come all right so he said no wonder it's not even written he said they hushed heaven hush nothing took place angel didn't know it nobody knows when he's coming all right but it'll be revealed in those seven thunders and that will reveal that greville great revelation at that time what time when you need it brother brown said later on he said you will it'll be revealed to you amen now he didn't leave us without the message of that what do you think he preached all the way until the time of his departure was that revelation who are you bride where are you now watch watch what he said that the opening of the seals were would you like to know what he said the opening of the seals were he said he opened those seals the seven mysteries the seven-fold mystery of the bible that's been closed since the foundation of the world will be revealed and yet we yet a little humble group compared with all the world we've enjoyed those blessings of hearing the mysteries marriage divorce serpent seeds all those that little loose ends loose ends notice he could not preach marriage and divorce till after the opening of the seal who is this melchizedek could not be preached till after the opening of the seals the seed does not air with the shock could not be preached all these things christ the mystery of god revealed brother brahm said right there in that message i'm revealing to you what his coming would be how when has been sealed up and he said it's been a good thing that it has been because satan would have got it but now is the time he said for it to be revealed all right and he began to unfold it i just could spend a lot of time just on the quotes but look he said now he said he said see all these different questions has been he said has been the reason i'm leaving indiana to arizona where i was to meet in the form of a pyramid seven angels not knowing what would happen later when i got there thinking it was the end of my life that no one could stand the blast and i'm sure you all are acquainted with the story but in sabino kenya that one morning while in prayer there'd been a sword placed in my hand he said this is the word other words he said now but he said brother brahm said the word is in my hand the word is in the hand all right and he said and he said now it took they took the picture all the way from mexico i won't go into all that a mystic something in the spheres and he says and they wanted to know science one of them wanted to know any significance but he said i didn't tell them could have he said i didn't tell them he said you all it was you all knew it beforehand but it wasn't for them it was for you all right now they he said and there he spoke to me and said the seven seals will be open the seven mystery the seven-fold mystery of the bible that's been closed up since the foundation of the world will be revealed amen he said we'll be revealed and we yet a little humble group compared with the world we've enjoyed these blessings of hearing these mysteries and he said he says now and these different questions has been been answered he said now he said all these different questions has been completely revealed to us not by man but by god himself then who's unveiled here by god himself that's all he said that's that's who opened those seven mysteries of what the watch what are those seven mysteries revealing of what the church was how it was in christ at the beginning and how it would be revealed in the last day amen well you turn the picture like this you can probably see it from the audience it's christ supreme judge and it's the truth this is the truth he said it's a vindication it's an identification a perfect identification and a perfect vindication that this message is the truth if you want a vindication identification he said that's a perfect identification because what's the message him all right see him not third person the only person you're not a third person you're the only person hello you're not somebody else you're him and another form but it's still him eve mrs adam was revealing mr adam that's right she was she was his mystery it was hid in him he had it hid in himself it had to he had to be unveiled in order for that mystery to be revealed amen all right and it was in the seventh day that the mystery was made known that's why i said the subject here is the com the capstone revelation of the creation of god because when the seventh angel's message sounded he said when he sounds his message the mystery the mystery of god would be finished finished what in where is she where is he where is it finished what's the capstone where what what was the crowning act of that creation when god finished it on the seventh day genesis 2 he finished it it was the seventh day is that right the message that was hid in and remember he he said in verse 27 of chapter one male and female created he them in there in his image created in his image in his image he made him male and female in his image so what is his image male and female what would be the full complete revelation of himself it would have to be the portion of himself to revealed in the seventh day because the second adam paid the price for somebody and he came and opened the book of the revelation of who that is and would reveal it and you would take your position amen all right i'm losing you because you're tired but i'm just going to try to close this off come back to it i wish you'd shut up so we could go home now i hope you didn't say that because it's not me i keep being pressed here to get this out we've got to get this much it's not something that just has hid well it'll be revealed someday it's already been revealed and it's being revealed and she's growing in that light she's moving right up to her right up to the position of maturity all the greenness is baked out of her she's not afraid to declare what he is who he is what she is and the thing that the that the earth and then jesus said he didn't know until revelations chapter one the brother brahm said then he comes with the full revelation of what that was only the father knew it but it was sealed with seven seals there you are and here we are here's our sign to the end sir here's the sign of it right here it's a mystery that god had in his mind the back part about his purpose what was his heart purpose without going to the quote page 149 church age book what was god's heart purpose brother brahm said he had one purpose in mind one purpose to fulfill one purpose to make known and he he waited until this very end put it in the hand of the seventh angel came down himself and unveiled it so that he could unite he would come uniting with the body head with the body don't you see this is head time brother braham said the head and the body has not will has become one unit amen and he says and he says now here we are he said in that number two he said the message of the seventh angel he said this this revelation of thunder the mess excuse me the the messenger of malachi 4 and revelation 10 are going to do two things you're aware of that he said he said the second thing let me just find that here would be oh let me finish one other thing here before i go there i'm trying to i'm going to try to close now there was some reason that god let these seven these seven voices be thundered because it must come we find that christ the lamb took the book in his hand did he he sure did he said he christ the lamb took the book in his hand and he opened the seventh seal remember when he took the book everything began to rejoice amen he did the work of redemption he's doing the work he continued the work he intervened till the last one comes in is that right but he's opened the book and claimed what he owns are you with me it's a part of his redemption okay and he's interce he's always been doing that until that last one and the door shuts remember they that were ready and i'll come back down to abraham and sarah but they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and we don't know how much later down the load that was but and the door was shut last one got the revelation the last one come in the last one to know our position in place matured amen that's it look at what day we're in see right here israel's in her homeland fig trees putting forth their buds this economical council's communism is uniting to destroy catholicism and the church is uniting to try to destroy communism hello we got a catholic president see everything is timed right up here perfectly coming right down the line breaking the government so he can step in make a compact with rome and brother bram said the bride won't even see that and there's one thing about it he said when it comes to that place of not being able to buy or sell he will not allow his bride to go through it go back to the first seal and see if that's not what he said he'll keep her from it so how close are we by the coming of the lord okay i'm saying the mystery is a coming but you're that coming it's his coming but he's coming in an unveiled secret isn't known to the public can't be known to the public until that time that she he who let us will let until he the bride christ the bride be taken out of the way then that that beast will be revealed when she goes up our our pastor said she goes up no it wasn't our pastor said that i think it was another preacher was here anyway when she goes up satan is kicked out amen is that right see but how have we overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the testimony that we're spoken about right here this morning by our testimony of what he has provided and is doing we're not afraid to testify of that and we're testifying of it we have victory through the blood and the testimony which we hold this is his word this is his promise this is what's happening this word this day the scriptures are being fulfilled in your ears hallelujah oh brother sister can't you just give me two more hours it's not a laughing matter is it all right i wish i had it maybe the lord let me well i do i have two more services lord willing coming up i shouldn't have said that i want you all here now two more services coming up here in the first of march and i think brother you'll be gone chris will be gone i think they're going back to a marriage seminar which we had when i was a pastor in arizona we had barry out when you're just starting those so we enjoyed them i think you'll enjoy them i think other you think trevor carrier going i don't know all but i hope somebody's here maybe i'll continue i'd like to get in who are those righteous that are saved that are given eternal life at the judgment that's another message i'd like to bring that's a great mystery and why and why are they saved and why are those that had their name of the book taken away why are they cast into outer darkness what's the separation between the sheep and the goats what makes the difference lord willie you pray for me i've had that in my heart for a year or better to bring that message i'm gonna have to take a little time hopefully i'll have a printer that prints and do it if not i should have brought my laptop down here it's the size of this screen but i could have used it but maybe it's a good thing i didn't use it see god does all things well absolutely he's got full control i'm saying that because i believe that with all my heart i don't care what it is is he leading you or he's not leading you what do you believe if you believe he's leading you just give yourself to him and quit trying to figure out how he's doing it but but but if the holy spirit is leading you he'll keep you in line with the word he's not going to lead you away from the word remember that he can't lead you away from the word you've got another spirit leading you then okay can i finish this no i mean can i get done what i want to get done right no just this much all right let's get this there's some reason they thundered we find that christ the lamb took the book christ the lamb who did we see christ lord let's just see is coming quickening power lets us see his coming let me say that again quickening power direct quote rising of the sun quickening power lets us see is coming and he says notice it was our lord up there we see our lord our husband wonder what he came for probably the marriage absolutely that's exactly right the rapture he said is the wedding supper amen he said let us be glad to rejoice because now the son of man revealing himself unites the two together and they become one brother brown said it very emphatically the head and the body here come one unit he said no longer or twain they are one that way but not a different person than adam she was adam revealed in fullness she had to be manifested in order for the mystery to be completed she had to be manifest are you hearing this this morning all right in her alone all right because it's her time now he says but you see he said with the book in his hand he opened the seventh seal the lamb took the book and with the book the book in his hand he opened the seventh seal and they all began to shout and john said all in heaven all above all below heard i shout brother brown said he must have looked behind the veil into that little room and said there's john yeah i didn't vision it this way but there's that little room he said i didn't envision that tent vision this way but he said do you understand it's been manifest right here before us amen and he said that little room right there going behind the veil they couldn't explain what they'd just come out and see neither can i this morning i can only tell you what he said but i'm speaking the revelation of the hour it serves is this the sign of the end brother brown said it was amen so he said he had the book in his hand did he he sure did the word of the lord comes to his prophets it had to be a prophet because the revelation that was hid now was being revealed and he can't do it any other way but through prophets amen do we really understand what god just said that he will do nothing himself until first he reveals it to his servants the prophets do you not think he had to get that revelation firth and express it to us and when he did that we become alive we are a spoken word seed a spoken word creation a spoken word bride is that right do you realize that when he spoke these things that had to come to manifestation somewhere amen that's exactly and here you are and here i am and here she is there is again in this day another people in the land you see there is again another this is another day there is again another people who with this word amen is going out i wish i could find that quote i think i got it in here somewhere but we'll have to pick it up another time it's hidden mystery but you see he had it in his hand he opened that seventh seal do you understand why the seventh seal opened and als and brother brown said seven voices seven thunders one message amen remember what he said there he said seven seven seven one message one message he said seven thunders what he said amen we heard the trumpet what'd we hear the seventh trumpet trumpet always denotes a gathering amen or war spiritual warfare amen are going out a time of of leaving satan doing everything warfare taking the promise but it's a gathering amen all right and in that time of that seventh trumpet what's going to come forth a rapture a rising of the of those asleep what'd they hear what are they hearing they had to hear the voice of the resurrection all right what do we did what did you hear when you come alive and come out of your sleep you heard this voice the seven thunders is our awakening do you realize that brother branham said they don't realize the awakening of the bride they're missing it they don't realize the awakening of the bride being spiritual being religious they they say well there are certain things the word's got to come to pass everything we're still looking for that great thing to happen and what they haven't recognized message recognizing your day and its message he said what they haven't recognized is the awakening of the bride all right we were in a deep sleep but we were never dead we were always we're alive in him we just had a time to be awakened and right back around to our theophany then in a glorified body we had to bypass we had to come down here in the earth to be tested and tried amen because those those attributes of him had to be manifest every one of them oh what a great plan what a great time let's close this off can i am i allowed to close it off now don't stop pulling no let me just get to one one more two things here it's a hidden mystery he had the seal he opened the seventh seal but you see it's a hidden it's a hidden mystery he didn't say it was an obvious revealed he said it's hidden it's a hidden mystery he said no one knows it but right what he said he said no one would know his coming they would not know about this seven thundered mystery so you see it's connected together amen it's connected he said the public wouldn't know it but he said the bride would so he's not talking about nobody knowing it be the bride amen nobody in their own carnal thinking never figured out but it's his coming it's his mystery of his coming and that's what's taking place that's why it's so mysterious because the bride's catching the revelation and preaching it and the devil says i can't stand this i can't stand this she's going to destroy me she's going to put me in the lake of fire she's going to say away with you she's going to judge me someday and i can't stand this why because the bride with an open book is being judged right now we're not judged out there at the white throne we're judged right now and we may have to go through a millennium before the white throne to learn how to rule like we should see there can be a lot more unveiled than more than you realize how to act like a queen more see see it's all we don't know we know there's a millennium and we're going to rule over someone because we rule the rod of iron he does is that right i'll just let you feed on that a little bit amen all right it's connected together but he said these he said this said this number two after he turned the hearts he'll turn the hearts of the children to the father's two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals which are divinely revealed truths those divinely revealed truths will literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal father so you see this is happening before we rapture in a body in a meeting in the air there you are so it's it's the mystery of his coming amen and it's the revelation contained in the seals what is that mystery you you you're the finished mystery of god amen amen amen amen you had to come to your position and place the only one that could bring you to that place is him that's always done it all along nobody else you can't figure it out you were you weren't even looking for it he was looking for you but when he found you you knew it was right because when he screamed inside you answered well that sounds good i'll just figure it all out no something inside you answered and said that's what i've been looking for and when you get a hold of that you can't get enough of it it doesn't become drudgery to you it becomes an everyday living and everyday walk it becomes an everyday unfolding it just is a love affair with her him and his bride and the more you get into it the hotter the battle becomes because you're an overcomer you're more than an overcomer you're victorious you are his victory because you are himself reveal you are his victory do you love him in the light of his resurrection we still go forth in his name amen aren't you glad that little germ that was to be you that was in him found you aren't you glad that the full heart purpose of god as i said i didn't get to a lot of this but the full purpose the full he said remember this seventh seal cannot be broke to the public until the bride leaves see in order for her to leave she had to see that oh i'm just so thankful do you realize the seeing the revealing of it seeing yourself positionally placed oh it's so good bride to see ourselves positionally placed in christ christ is the mystery that's revealed in her alone the hope of glory amen amen amen do you realize there's no such a thing if well someday i'll have to i'll fall away and i'll do no no you never could fall away you always were in him your name is revealed there you're the mystery you're his thought you can get up in the morning crawl out of bed maybe achy and everything else and but say lord i'm your thought expressed i'm rising in your name i'm your thought express i was in that book of yourself the record of yourself i was in your very thoughts i existed in your thoughts i was eternal in your thoughts and i never can be anything but eternal and you have awakened me with the reality and revelation and the unsealing of yourself you've awakened that in me that i've looked forward to and see no more do i have confidence in this old man out here in my enemy but this enemy is conquered i have no confidence in that i don't confidence in my mind in my my thinking lord just let me preach the truth or be silent preach the word or be silent amen i have no business flirting around with other things eating off of that tree carnality carnal thinking our warfare i'll say it again the weapons of our warfare are not carnal you don't deliver anybody by carnality it's the word or nothing you bring the word or stay out of it god doesn't need your theology it doesn't need your reasoning god wants to do something with my spirit let his word it's in my soul quicken that word to me it'll release me what am i doing i'm bringing every thought under obedience i bring my spirit under obedience to what's in my heart and then that what does that do rules the body your soul rules your spirit your spirit rules the body so keep your head out of those carnal books and that carnal warfare and carnal psychologies and carnal everything of man and realize to do that and continue with that you're breaking the word you're tearing down everything that god said for you to do and if you don't think so prove it by the word what you're doing because i can prove it by the word that you're not doing it all right do you love him i haven't said these things to confuse you i've said these things to deliver this is not a confusing what's it what's it what is it it's himself revealed you have one thing hold to god's unchanging hand hold to god's unchanging hand build your hopes on things eternal hold to god's unchanging hand amen who's willing to do that who willing to take a stand in the midst of all confusion and all everything contrary to it learning of man you aren't here to learn a man you're here to worship and serve and honor the lord learn all of him everything you can of him and you don't learn that through other things you learn it through this message that if we didn't have this message this would just be words on a book all they'd be you would never understand what it was unless the holy spirit that wrote this that brought the message you would never see it even if the message did speak it you've got to have the holy ghost in order to lighten give you light amen we have the perfect interpretation of these scriptures given to us by a prophet all i need is just the bible no you need more than the bible but yet you need nothing but the bible but this message isn't the bi how's it outside the bible it is the bible amen it's just exactly what the bible said would send amen amen i'm thankful god kept his word aren't you sent us a message in this hour so we wouldn't stand in darkness and confused because now we see everybody has a written word but not many have reality of it we have the written word but now it's more than a written word to us it's a full revelation a manifestation going onward onward do you think i know everything no far be it from me i don't i don't know the things that ought to know yet i know the things i do know but there's things a lot of things i still you know what i say god keep revealing yourself to me keep revealing keep opening your word thankful for what i have lord there's got to be more that was sure good lord but what's what's what's today show me some more lord keep revealing it keep opening it until i step right in by revelation i step right into that body change let's stand i won't keep you any longer god bless you oh there's just so many i don't wanna i don't wanna go through my notes again because it'll be just something else i'll try to bring out i can say now come up and i'll start preaching another half hour but i won't do that either amen but the full i just i just keep pulling pull back to something here and i want to find it if you don't mind just a moment i just i can't i can't leave it until he i can tell i get it here and i just let me see if i can find it see he said brother brown said this this is a secret he kept it a secret amen he kept it through the ages he kept it but we see that secret is the coming of the lord [Music] that's why i took you to matthew i haven't even got to the other scriptures i apologize for that i had three other scriptures to read actually four genesis but i i talked to you about adam i mean yes adam and eve [Music] but that's what had to be restored back oh yes oh yes just a quick view here carnal eve got impregnated by adam first before he before adam i mean be the satan the serpent before adam knew her how may know that it was his wife but he hadn't been with her yet got to eve first the serpent satan all right then christ did the same thing are you with me he got to marry first before satan are you with me he got to her he had to come through the woman again he had to reverse the crime so he had to come through a woman and he did that are you with me all right that word was promised to return to her again the second adam amen and he died for took her place died for you and i took our place to redeem us is that right and poured out his life which is the germ of life which is in the blood life and by that we could come in union with him amen are you with me but he hadn't finished it until down here at the end when we could come in union see because when that pentecostal bride the beginning started out before god could get to her for the marriage satan got to her again are you with me you understand what i'm saying all right then she went through the dark ages [Music] and then up here at the end that chain had to be broke he had to break that cycle is that right how could he break that cycle because there was a second atom that didn't go naked with her are you with me there was a second adam that already paid the price said she's mine i can't lose her and i'm going to reveal myself to her and she's going to come out of that dogma and that dark denominationalism and she's going to fulfill the scriptures of my coming my coming in bride form i have to come and repeat that again back amen now look at abraham and sarah abraham and sarah had their pentecost they had a change body physical i'm talking about physical natural they had a body change brother bam said noticing what will happen with every predestinated is that right by their by their then so they had that so what'd they do where'd they go from there it went down to bemelic is that right they went right down into that old denominational religious system down there and caused abraham to lie and said you say to that king i'm your brother you imagine that and they let seed thank god for grace that's my prophet you'll pray for him see all right see god didn't even see it did he he had a predestinated plan he had a plan of redemption that had to be fulfilled i don't want you to miss this now and so here here they already had they had their change they went through their pentecost but something follows pentecost it's called marriage the same thing that followed pentecost at the beginning but they didn't get to the marriage now god said i'm going to save you from this i've redeemed you and i've interceded for you and i'm going to reveal my word and what do you do they went down there and abimelech had a dream god stopped it right there he wouldn't let the devil come in there and to get to eve first before she had abraham she hadn't even conceived yet are you with me she hadn't even conceived yet neither did this bride of pentecost conceive yet but they had a change they were a new creation they were a new birth they were a new creation is that right so if we come to our pentecost a new creation well we've got to come into marriage they that were ready went into marriage with him [Music] if if abimelech would have been allowed to do that he would have got to sarah before abraham [Music] and just think about it sarah was a little weak you know in a week in faith but i'll tell you after all those happenings she saw the mighty god unveiled because after that verse 20 chapter 21 of genesis and then after coming back out of that country out of that denominational system she conceived and she started bearing his son unto us the son had given unto us a child is born amen are you with me it's just like it's just like mary the secret brother branham said is that he's in you the word is in the bride just like mary in order to have the coming sun she had to bear that seed and they had to be changed to do it are you with me okay i'll just drop that in maybe cover that a little bit later but there it is glory you see the hour you're in you see the mystery of his coming my father had it hid it was hit in the back part of his mind i don't even know it i can't even say it jesus speaking as a man he said i don't have that revelation [Music] that'll skin you i thought he had revelation of everything brother brahm said no he didn't he said because there was things that had to be fulfilled that he couldn't fulfill back then but now he will now do do within the bride through the bride he will now work in and through his bride to finish what he didn't finish and she knows it and knows that it's him working and she has his mind do you glad you have the mind of god you have his thought you're as thought you are his thought expressed right on time right in season right in your turn [Music] in your decreed season it took the spoken word to wake you up glory to god i feel like singing a song i just about saying something right then i you know that that song i feel like i feel like what's that say i feel like huh yeah ah well i feel like traveling i feel like traveling uh in his name let's go forward home is bright and fair i feel like traveling on oh i feel like traveling on oh yeah i feel like traveling on my heavenly is coming in full view coming to you all the time amen do you feel like traveling on brother braham said just keep right on in his name you have his name you're impregnated with his name you're bearing life you're bringing the fruit of life amen travel on don't look out here at the church don't look over here what this group's doing don't look over here you just keep your focus on the things that are not natural you keep your focus on those things that are eternal right satan will do everything he can to get you mixed up into things that are not that are not eternal don't tell me he won't every day i face him amen you face him amen amen while we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal god don't take your cues from some man's wisdom take your cues from the lord jesus christ our head put it in his hands say lord let me be a real witness let my testimony not be a man's knowledge let my testimony be of the word focus on those things which are real eternal amen amen keep your focus amen then you'll travel just exactly brother sister right here before the end of this day i may meet my loved ones won't that be wonderful brother jason won't that be wonderful to meet my loved one gone on amen think of it before the end of this before this right here come walking right in the back well hello there everybody's looking around what's he talking to maybe you'll see maybe you won't but i will why because i'm right into that cycle i'm right up here in the rapture cycle this words pull me right into that very thing aren't you glad to be the very image of god the very himself reveal aren't you glad to be himself revealed in this hour not a mystic not some idea some story you are himself revealed don't lose that focus you're here to please him amen are you going to please him there's only one way you can please him not by your little works of psychology but by revelation can you only please him so you see what the devil's trying to do he's trying to get you away from that pull you aside over on another thing so the full purpose the full purpose i know i said i wasn't going to do this but i'm doing it [Music] amen [Music] he had a full purpose oh my this mystery this secret is only revealed to his beloved bride that's brother brown's quote it's only revealed to his beloved bride the only one that could see it it's an individual not a group it's an individual amen [Music] amen anyway he had a full purpose what to do maybe oh there it is about ready to close it up the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible [Music] that heart purpose the heart purpose the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal decreed it before the foundation of the world you are decreed you'd be right where you are right now right in that pew right where you are everything about you he knew it right now amen it's exactly what it is [Music] and you know where it's being revealed i told you didn't i you were in this thinking you existed in his saw think of it you are you are the eternal you are the eternal all this mystery revealed only as he promised to his bride only to her all hell's against the revelation of this mystery but god the bride is standing on it he said that's her stand look what was once god's great secret mysterious secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believer matthew 24 36 [Music] amen all look what once was god's great secret mysterious secret is now put in the hearts of the believer other words is unveiled right there [Music] that is the body of christ what was god's once great secret in his mind before the world foundation of the
