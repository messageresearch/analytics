your seats thank you amen as we get raided turn the service to brother Chris let's see number 1065. amen one thing I can say about the preaching here we've gotten braver we've got more bolder and I love this song because it it testifies what's been happening here so I I like I love the song it's fantastic it's been tried search and find your satisfied though the story The Message still is true it's been pretty cool it's been changed still its power is never changed it will stand the test forever [Music] give me the world make it plain and clear to me [Music] it's a light that I might see give me the word victory over every situation give me the world on it watered down down [Music] so that the whole world can hear it will change our lives forever give me the world give me the word make it plain and clear to me give me the words [Music] sugar coating on profound give me basic truth truth that lasts a course of time and preach it strong and preaching clear so that the whole world can hear it will change your life forever give me the word let's all stand oh give me the world make it Flame foreign [Music] it's my totally victory everything amen big song to come out to amen praise the Lord maybe maybe we'll sing that course again you can sit down we got some announcements but we'll sing that again that way before we go into the preaching of the word but um so I talked to brother Paul yesterday he called me um and uh everything is going really well just just shared a few testimonies with me what God's done and the young people and and um if even just one of those testimonies was all that came out of that um just my goodness it would be everything would be worth it um they just the whole Trip's been a whirlwind or you heard from brother Trevor last Sunday and busy busy busy in Israel and then busy busy busy in South Africa so they're they're uh getting the end of the Rope I think tired wise but God's really speaking through him and doing great things today and and uh probably now I don't know how far ahead of time they are they're not too far ahead um because he called me yesterday morning it was the afternoon there so they're probably right in the middle of the service they were not going to have a afternoon service but brother Gideon felt led to so whenever God whenever you hear God's servants they're feeling LED and I'm gonna do this saying you watch God's gonna do something so we just want to in our prayers remember that service that's particularly God is probably giving someone a chance to receive something another opportunity to receive what they've that they've come for so he he said tell everyone hello that loves you and misses you um and also we thank you for your prayers as we traveled our trip ended up being a week instead of a weekend but we had a wonderful time with Brother John Andy's group there in in Washington last weekend but they're Steve Clark sends his greetings as I'm sure brother John does as well but brother John was over in New Zealand he's still over there and um so he says they send their greetings tell everyone hello I also spoke with brother Jose and he wanted me to tell you all hello from from Tri-Cities area so um but uh Brother Rich Cobb and brother Vlad and brother they they send their greetings as well but if black came for Camp here from Brother Rich's last summer so he said tell everybody hello so um but Brother Rich as well since his greetings amen again I I believe that God spoke both places and and his word will not return to him void amen so we also I also yesterday when I was on the phone one of the reasons he called uh yesterday but Paul was about the Christmas day service so uh he's decided we'll have a Christmas day service uh Sunday morning regular time um no one's obligated to come uh but when the pastor says that I'm kidding I'm kidding um so looking forward to that time together amen let's sing that course again give me the word and then we will get into the sermon this morning give me the word make it plain and clear to me [Music] over everything situation give me the word make it plain and clear to me give me the world I might see give me the world story over every situation give me the word amen praise the Lord thank you Lord Jesus thank you musicians sister and me yes down family amen why don't we stand this morning the devil tried to take us out earlier this week but I knew God would come and heal us enough right on time that we were able to speak Wednesday night Thursday and this morning so you pray for me still but uh my son Jackson he said I don't want to go to church this morning and I said you know sometimes me and Mom don't want to go to church but we go anyways and we never regret it I said do you want to give the devil a black eye do you want to chop his head off do you want to run him through and you know first he was saying no and I said well the best way to do that is to go to church and so we always getting ready of 30 minutes later something he comes in all dressed for church and he says Dad I want to stab the devil so praise the Lord you're here this morning amen you're giving the devil a black eye praise the Lord why don't we turn in our Bibles to Hosea Jose 14 verse 9. been listening to the sermon Brother David preached last Sunday and enjoying it tremendously I purposely did not touch Wednesday night because I didn't want to know what he preached so I wouldn't get in my way in the way of me this morning because I could say well I had no idea what he preached so God's God's uh just gave me this direction Friday or a couple days ago whatever it was and there's a quote where brother Branham says when he when he gets a sermon sorry I'm Jose let me just get to my spot in the scriptures here Isaiah chapter 14. the Lord lay this on my heart and but remember says he makes a quote where he says I get my my sermons through prayer and then they pray a little more and a little more and then it keeps coming closer and closer and so I just sorry are you sure Lord is this it I don't want to re-speak of what I've already spoken but then as you begin to open it up it turned and and right there in line with so just pray the Lord have his way this morning Hey Man Hosea 14 verse 9. who is wise and he shall understand these things prudent and he shall know them for the ways of the Lord are right and the just shall walk in them but the transgressors shall fall therein 8 14 Same Same Book sorry I'm trying to catch the mic best I can probably gonna have to do that a few times well no I'm not going to claim that the Lord's going to come Jose chapter 8 verse 14. for Israel hath forgotten it's really good to be home by the way I love preaching to you people it's good to preach in the home pulpit it's a lot more relaxing nothing against we stream see so you say stuff and then you stream and then people see that nothing against going I feel at home at other places as well but I believe everyone just everyone understands the home Church okay just preach Chris okay Jose 8 chapter 8 verse 14 for Israel hath forgotten his maker and build his temples and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities but I will send a fire upon his City cities and it shall Devour the Palaces thereof so this verse here is where I get my subtitle so I'll give you my title this morning and I did it in such a way because I made do more Wednesday night on the same kind of thing but um the rise rain and fall Ephraim and my subtitle is forget not thy maker Deuteronomy chapter 4. so I wrote the title in that in such a way that we wanted to bring more Wednesday night we could same con uh continuity Deuteronomy chapter 4 Deuteronomy 4 verse 1. thank you now therefore hearken o Israel unto the statutes and then to the judgments which I teach you for to do them that you may live and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you you shall not add unto the word which I command you neither shall you diminish art from it that ye may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God which I command you your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Bill peor for all the men that followed Bill pure of the Lord thy God hath destroyed them from among you but you ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day this day he doesn't give the date because it's always this day cleave unto the Lord and I I that's my desire this morning let's let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're leaning heavily into your arms this morning as you we should do every day but Lord Jesus I pray you just anoint these words Lord this sermon this morning Father that it would come exactly as you would have it Lord speak exactly to our hearts Lord Jesus help us to see this father Lord to catch father what you're trying to tell us this morning because father it's the best thing we could do Lord we pray that you would be with your people if I pray for brother Paul Lord I think he's probably speaking right now may you just anoint him Lord to push through that barrier Lord Jesus father may we get good reports Lord Jesus we commit these things now into your hands Lord this holy work Lord this service this morning he would speak to us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated this morning so your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Bill pure for all the men that followed Bill peor the Lord that God hath destroyed them from among you but ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day so we were the story referenced here this morning is is the is the Feast of belpure and I wanna I would allow me to lay a foundation this morning before we step into our our subject rise Reign and fall of Ephraim in Numbers chapter 25 we can read the story and we have a lot of scriptures this morning and I I pulled out all I could and uh as we go you know the Lord sometimes brings it a certain way and maybe we won't have to read it each one exactly but If he if he does well that's just how he's planned it this morning Numbers chapter 25 and that yeah amen number chapter 25. an Israel Abode in in shitam and the people begin to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab and they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods and the people did eat and bowed down to their gods and Israel joined himself unto Bell peor and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel pior was a a God in of Baal and this was a feast they were that they were having and the Lord said unto Moses take all the heads of the people and hang them up before the Lord against the son that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel and Moses said unto the judges of Israel slay ye every met everyone his men that were joined unto belpure everyone who committed fornication and behold one of the children of Israel came and brought unto the his Brethren Brethren a midianitish woman in the sight of Moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel who were weeping before the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and when Phineas the son of Eliezer the son of Aaron the priest saw it he rose up from among the congregation and he took a javelin in his hand and he went after the men of Israel unto the tent and thrust both of them through the man of Israel and the woman through her belly so the plague was stayed from the children of Israel and those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Phineas the son of Eliezer the son of Aaron the priest hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel while he was zealous for my sake so why did Phineas run her through at the valley why didn't he run her through in the heart because the problem was the seed she carried because if you read this story through they go and they attack Midian after this and then they they bring back women and children and and Moses says go kill why did you bring them back he said this is what caused the problem to begin with he said go kill all the women who have who have known a man and all women who are pregnant and all the children and then keep the rest you can keep the rest because it's the seed amen those arrests they kept that was God's plan they were Sanctified totally different situation but this seed Phineas runs the her through in the belly because it's the seed brought forth a fornication of God's people God's word mixed with belpure mixed with that spirit this is so this is this is how this is how God looks at this yes sir and that and that's what I that's my heart this morning is to see to look into this why why did we talk about this why do we why do we preach on belpure and mention this feast and Balaam and all of these things and what is Brother Brad I'm so heavily talk about it in the church age book and I pray that God will bring us down to the very core of that this morning so he gives Phineas his Covenant of peace anytime you take the word of God and you apply it in your life God gives you the Covenant of peace so I think we can we get so let's finish let's let's finish the chapter it just lays it out so well 13 verse 13 and he shall have it in his seat after him even the Covenant of an everlasting priesthood because he was zealous for his God and made an atonement for the children of Israel now the name of the Israelite that was slain even that was slain with the midianitish woman was zimmri the son of Salu a pre Prince of of a chief house among the simianites and the name of the midianitish woman that was slain was Cosby the daughter of Zur he was head over a people and a chief of a chief house in Midian and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Vex the midianites and smite them for they Vex you with their Wiles wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of pior and in the matter of Cosby the daughter of a prince of Midian their sister which was slain in the day of the plague for Pure sake numbers 31. Numbers Chapter 31. so there's a story we have it we read it now you don't have an you don't have an excuse we've read this story sometimes praise the Lord you got to go read the story you got to go read it for yourself in the Bible when you when you hear it preached about and the story is not read when you hear a preached about go back and read it for yourself because many times as a minister and study I'll go back and I'll read even though I can tell you the story I go back and read it because there's always something there you missed always something that you missed uh numbers 31 verse 1 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Avenge the children of Israel of the midianites afterwards shalt thou be gathered unto thy people Moses's last big fight you think wow he's going to die right after this it says that Moses went to the mountain he never died he was translated and Amma to the very last moment here on Earth they said his strength never waned his Vigor never lacked he was strong as the day he was as the day he became a man I'm unbelievable amen so gather unto thy people and Moses spake unto the people saying arm some of yourselves unto the unto the war and let them go against the midianites and avenge of the Lord of Midian of every tribe of a thousand throughout all the tribes of Israel shall you ascend to the war so there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel a thousand of every tribe twelve thousand armed for war and Moses sent them to the war a thousand of every tribe them and Phineas the son of elieza the priest to the war with the Holy instruments and the in and the and the trumpets to blow in his hand and they Ward against the midianites as the Lord commanded Moses and they slew all the males no no more seed no more seed and they slew the things of Midian beside the rest of them that were slain namely El Eevee and Zur and her and Reba even five Kings of Midian Balaam also the son of bior they slew with the sword okay so this quote here and and I don't I don't try to get don't try to be over spiritual and get weird yesterday I was studying this out and and at the core of this it's Christianity versus idolatry and I was studying it out and I found this quote from Christianity versus idolatry and he preached it on December 17th and I was studying this out yesterday and I just was like Wow Lord so he says he says numbers 25 give the guys a chance we see whether it matters anything to God or not let's see if it does whether these Creeds dogmas and so forth doesn't matter he is a good god he just overlooks the whole thing he doesn't he lays a line and draws a plummet and you've got to come to it he reads numbers and then he goes on to say he says or he I think he reads this chapter slay every one of them God wants to be God and if he ain't God he ain't going to be second place he don't have to let Baal and some man-made dogma and some theory of some man or some idea of a Creed or some idea of a denomination stand in his way he's God and he's able of these stones to rise children to Abraham you don't have to have your denomination you don't have to have your big societies and your schools and things he takes what he can get in his hand that's nothing breeds the breath of life into it and it becomes something that'll serve him so that's what he did to you and I that's what makes it him God certainly it matters to God the foundation I want to lay is moab's Israel's fall at the face develop your why did it matter so much to God or show you why show you that it mattered so much to God it was his people which is his word mixed mixed with a seed that started in fornication Moab was the son of of lot and his daughter and then they they fell in idolatry and in that falling they brought forth seed of idolatry and the man that caused them to do that was Balaam and God slew him why is it listed in the Bible Balaam died because God wants to show us this is how I feel about it I feel very strongly about it and this is why it's in the message over and over and over again God hates idolatry so now we see what God did with Moab in the situation that lays our foundation but we want so we want to now we want to talk about Ephraim what happened with Ephraim First Kings chapter 12. all right you can turn the Bible the physical book into an idol that's the point I'm not I don't want to make a point about you know working out too much or or food or or your car as an idol I don't want to talk about that I want to go deep down to the very root of the problem you can turn the Bible the physical book into an idol when you mix it and you take away the power of Christ that's what happened the power of God was removed because Israel mixed amen with idolatry that's right you can turn the message brother Branham and we know this you can turn brother branometer an idol you can turn the message into an idol when you mix it and take out what happened as soon as you mix it there's no more power of God there's no more power of Christ it's not just the physical book because lots of people have the book it's not the the message lots of people have the message it's the power of Christ through the word of God which is Anointed which is anointed word that can only continue to channel into your life continue can can continue to bring you into the statue of the perfect man continue to bring you into a position in the bride of Christ when it's not mixed amen not mixed with your opinion or any other preacher's opinion it's God's complete and holy word so Ephraim what is it what did Ephraim do you say Ephraim he's he's the ox he was on the I can't remember which side of the Tabernacle West or something at something along along those lines North or whatever North anyways you can go look it up but he was one of the guards the main Ephraim was there Ephraim was was was blessed instead of Manasseh but those situations were examples but Ephraim as a tribe what happened first Kings chapter 12. that's right well the preacher the people want to say well the preacher you know the church I went to they they caused this they'd say oh well Solomon taxed the people too hard so then what of course were you born what is he supposed to do in the in the Kingdom splits every person is given their own choices and you answer for yourself not anybody else and if you can cleave unto the word of God when though when they fall to Bell pure when they fall to their judgment you will be standing with God First Kings chapter 12 verse 25 we find the situation here rehoboam says I'll tax you worse than my father and jeroboam's anointed of the Lord for this moment but then he breaks that Judas anointed of the Lord but when it came time he didn't go into the word he denied the power of God brother Brennan was talking about I think it was Saint Augustine of Hippo I think it was him the Holy Spirit actually came to him and he refused it and he's the one who went down he went to Africa and he wrote in there anyone that disagrees made it a statute of Catholic religion anyone who disagrees with the Roman Church can be put to death but he was given the opportunity and he refused it that's what it is the holy spirit comes and they refuse it they don't want it okay it's not you struggling it's not that because you have a desire in your heart it's when you refuse the word of God but but our focus is the idolatry here so First Kings chapter 12 verse 25. so jeroboam takes the children of Israel then jeroboam built shechem in Mount Ephraim and dwelt there and went out from thence and bit built panuo and jeroboam said in his heart thou now now shall the kingdom return to the House of David every time man says God's not going to be here fast enough God's not going to work things out enough I gotta do it myself they mix that's it and it becomes idolatry why did God hate Saul's sacrifice it was a sacrifice it was the word the word said sacrifice but Saul turned it into idolatry because it was not his position to do so he said Samuel won't be here on time we got to go fight in other words God's not good enough to bring Samuel on time when whenever and that's that's man lifting himself above God and as soon as man lifts himself above God it's idolatry as soon as you lift yourself up above God and you tell your children something you make a judgment on them you've lifted yourself up you've created the turn the message and the word of God into idolatry that's right it is God's grace and until you're passed away there's no judgment until you're gone there's no judgment first Lord I'm gonna leave it there 27 12 27. hey this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem then shall the heart of his P this people turn again unto their lord even unto reborn king of Judah and they shall kill me and go again to rehoboam King of Judah God had already told jeroboam I've anointed you for this purpose so why is jeroboam worried about it you see you see how close this comes down to where we live every single day God has given you the message God has given you the token don't take it into your own hands don't try to explain it if you don't understand it see I don't know but I know God is faithful whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem Behold thy Gods this was the first nicaea Council by the way oh Israel which brought the up out of the land of Egypt and he set the one in Bethel which is in Ephraim and the other put he in Dan because Dan also same law but we're talking about Ephraim this morning and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one even unto Dan and he made in House of high places and made priests of the lowest of the people which were not of the sons of Levi he's got priests he's got a house he's got it in Bethel the house of God having the form of godliness but denying the power thereof this is where we're living today God help us God help us and he made a house of high places and made priests okay 32 and jeroboam ordained a feast on the eighth month on the 15th day of the month like unto the feast that is in Judah he mirrored the feasts got all the same feasts he offered upon the altar they got an altar so did he in Bethel sacrificing unto the calves that he had made and he placed in Bethel priests of the high places which he had made so he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the 15th day of the eighth month even in the month which he had devised of his own heart and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel and he offered upon the Altar and birth incense this verse chapter 13. I didn't give this to the to the guys and behold there came a man of God out of Judah with by the word of the Lord unto Bethel and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense and he cried against the altar in the word of the Lord and said o altar altar thus saith Lord behold the child shall be born in the House of David Josiah by name and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee and the men's bones shall be burnt upon thee so there's always a butt God's Gonna gonna move and God's gonna come but so so so if jeroboam the king the pastor anointed of a spirit sets up in Bethel in Ephraim idolatry but he mirrors it to Temple worship and he sets it up in the house of God Bethel means House of God he sets that Idol up directly in the house of God saints of God this Spirit of idolatry is in our house it's in our church stop calling them churches call them lodges do you know why do you know why and and that angel just hammered him on it do you know why he was so strong about that so there would be no confusion on what church means in the Bible denominations are not churches they are Lodges of belpeor they are Lodges of idolatry but jeroboam a brother a man of the message set up idolatry in the house of God this is church Church all over the world message churches that's a church nothing outside of that is a church it's a lodge and it's so that we don't get confused when God talks about church and whether Branham talks about church he's talking about he might say Pentecostals because that was church for a while but when we talk about Pentecostals you you bring that and roll that into message [Music] message because that was the closest thing to what he was preaching those are his people that's right for that that was the season where God was right but today he's here so when brother says you Pentecostals he's talking to you message people amen amen amen [Music] um Deuteronomy chapter 29. hey you sing that song you clapped that song give me the word God loves loves you I prayed God I want to bring this in your Divine love and true compassion but when I say compassion was when Jesus braided the whip in the temple and beat the money changers out what did they what had they done they had turned changed Temple worship into idolatry but God in his compassion beat it out of the church God and His compassion today is coming and he's warning us and he's telling us and he's giving us the Revelation the ability to see the two Spirits operating within the framework of the church Christianity versus idolatry that is what it's going to come down to to the very end that's right Deuteronomy 29 verse 16. for you know how how we have dwelt uh Deuteronomy 29 verse 16. oh you got it right there okay I was asked to give the slide guys time in our and our interpreter Lord blessed brother Alex for his labors for you know how we have wealth in the land of Egypt and how we came through the Nations which he passed by and ye have seen their Abominations their idols and wood Stones silver and goldlets were among them so he identifies here idols as being part of Egypt and those Heathen countries in other words part of the world he says you've seen it you've seen those worldly things he says Verse 18 lest there should be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord Our God to go and serve the god of gods of these nations lest there should be among you a root that bears Gall and wormwood I believe gold is like a vinegar bitter bitterness says bitterness will drive the Holy Spirit right out of your life so it's the root God today is not worried about the branch the what it looks because guess what a branch can be grafted in you may not identify the fruit but you get down to the root of the problem you see what what's what's the problem what's going on God wants you get to give you the eyes to see the root in his word because if you can identify here's it here it is if you can identify yourself with the root wins May Come floods may come hurricanes everything tornadoes and your roots will stay in the word of God your roots will stay so he says and it come to pass when he heareth the words of this curse that he blessed himself in his heart saying I shall have peace so so even though they hear the word of the curse which is going to say they say well I I I'm fine I'll have peace though I walk in the imagination of my heart to add drunkenness to The Thirst the Lord will not spare him but then the angler of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven that is what God thinks about idolatry and this you've been hearing this so if this is the word of God does God keep his word does God make a statement and then change his mind these are simple things and and that we understand so therefore if God says your name's blotted out Brother David covered that so well your name's blotted out of the book if you fall in idolatry and receive seed of that idolatry so Ephraim now has fallen in idolatry embraced it king after King came up some of them good but not until Josiah came did those high places get removed good men came up but they were never removed for a time for a season in the message high places were set up by jera Bowens bad men rose up good men rose up word was preached but it wasn't until Josiah the word the Revelation began to open up that God began to stir everything up you go talk to brother to people like brother Ron Peterson who was around in those times when men begin to catch revelation there was arguments and fights and and all kinds of chaos happen because people are saying you're taking you're going outside of the context of the message you're you're doing all of this thing but it was Revelation it was Josiah tearing down those high places but now today still that spirit is going to is always knocking at the door always present with us right it's not going to go away until we go out of here Revelations chapter 7 verse 4. if you think I'm pointing fingers at a certain Message Church es certain preachers I challenge you to go check your experience that's right that's right this is just the word of God Amen amen I can vehemently disagree with somebody and still call them brother and still love them because I don't know when God will give them a revelation I don't know if they aren't seed of God so don't ever think when when this is being preached through God is using brother Chris to preach this that I am pointing fingers at somebody Revelation chapter 7 verse 4. and I heard a number of them which were sealed and they were sealed 140 and 4 000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel of the tribe of Judah were sealed to twelve thousand so Judah Reuben Gad Asher Nephilim verse 6 Manassas of the tribe of Simeon were seal twelve thousand verse 7 of the tribe of Levi were still twelve thousand is the car was still 12 000. Zebulon was sealed twelve thousand so we're at ten Joseph was still the twelve thousand and Benjamin Ephraim it's not mentioned okay Hosea 4 17. and I just pause to give them a chance says Ephraim is joined to Idols let him alone you can jump to the PowerPoint brothers or I'm going to read the seventh this quote from the seventh seal I have here foreign CE from at Bethel and Dan they set up idols and these went out to worship this and here we are plumbed down into the Millennium age almost and God still remembers that sin they're not even counted in there just as sure as he remembers every good promise he remembers everyone evil too that's the reason I believe friends I've always tried to stay with that word no matter how strange it seems for the brand I'm admitting sometimes the word of God is strange see now they wouldn't think about that that sometimes it's strange think about that there then they they didn't think about it then they thought well they got by with it you see what he's saying they everyone knew what Deuteronomy said most everyone hit we're looking at Ephraim they fell in idolatry but they're going to be bought out from under Heaven people who are probably waiting watching and nothing happened they said well they gotta play with it they're still getting away with it today but God says come the end of time they won't be mentioned Brother David cover the white Throne judgment oh they're getting away with it now but come that judgment time when the books are opened but here they are over here okay in this Millennium age sitting in when when their names and tribes is blotted out from it because they served idolatry that God cursed didn't he say he hated the Nicolaitans and that Jezebel well Jezebel was a follower of Baal she was a very involved in it she brought it with Ahab and Ahab married her you see Ahab if you go watch and I'm gonna just gonna take the Liberty to say this my own personal opinion so you know Ahab tried many times God come forward come to Ahab and Ahab will repent I believe they have when he had he married a good woman would have had a different story but she brought him down to hell the bride we hey man we have to be married to the right thing married to God's word to bring us up into Heavenly places stay away from it didn't he say he would kill Jezebel's daughters with the killing of death which is eternal separations from his presence don't trust in it at all get away from it so God remembers God never forgets his word one one in in in in as a Jew as in the Bible the worst thing is that is a is a dog that's the lowest is a dog and that's who cleans up Jezebel that's right that's who licks up ahab's blood God using every opportunity to show us how much he hates idolatry that's right how much he cannot stand that spirit that wants to come in and say oh yeah we can have the same Feasts we can have the same traditions we can look and have and act like a message church and but there's this portion of the word that disqualifies me or is it a portion of the word that we're not sure we're going to leave out right there you might as well go worship at the Buddhist temple because God is not in it amen and God hates it so much because he created you why does he hate it so much because he created you to be a part of him and he can't do that if you have fallen fornication to belpure and that desire is burned from your heart because you've crossed the line that's right but God's people their names are reserved somewhere don't identify yourself with those who fell at LPR just make sure your life is good just make sure your your your your your your marriage with Christ is the way it should be your relationship is strong spend time with him however after this period of tribulation during the Millennium as seen by Ezekiel in 48 1-8 and 22-29 we see the tribes back once more in divine order but from the time that Ephraim and Dan joined themselves to Idols they died what is death in the Bible Eternal separation and those and those tribes have no more recognition now I realize that since the destruction of Jerusalem all records of all tribes have been lost so that no one can say for sure what tribe he is from but God knows that great God who is bringing Israel back to Palestine knows exactly which tribe every true Israelite is from and from all the assembled 144 000 Dan and Ephraim will be missing amen foreign that is not to say some child of Ephraim in modern days can't find Christ and become a part of the bride of Christ they're just not part of this the tribe it's not part of this Hosea 5 verse 3. I have all these these here just in my notes I I like I said I tried to leave out as much as I could it says I know Ephraim and Israel is so he says okay excuse me I know Ephraim and Israel is not hid from me from now o Ephraim thou committest hoardom and Israel is defiled Hosea 5 verse 5. and the pride of Israel testify to his face therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity Judah also shall fall with them the pride of Israel Christ testifying to their face but they fall in their iniquity Hosea 5 11 to 14. Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment because he willingly walked after the Commandment he willingly walked in idolatry he willingly walked away from the word therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth into the house of Judah as rottenness when Ephraim saw his sickness and Judah saw his wound they went to Ephraim to the Assyrian and sent to the king jereb yet could he not heal you nor cure you of your wound they didn't even go to God they went to the Assyrians more idolaters for I will be unto Ephraim as a lion and as a Young Lion to the house of Judah I even I will tear and go away I will take away and None Shall rescue him this is how God looks at idolatry the whole book of Hosea I pray pretty much we're pretty much reading the whole book so go back and maybe with now with with this in your heart you'll better understand this book of Prophecy amen because it is a book I think it's this is the book of uh well anyways so Hosea 6 verse 4. oh Ephraim what shall I do unto thee o Judah what shall I do unto thee for your goodness is as a morning cloud and as the early do it goeth away no goodness is found in you Ephraim what am I going to do with you a morning Cloud as the sun comes up it just vanishes what am I going to do with you you've fallen in idolatry you've forsaken me what am I going to do with you therefore have I hewed them by the prophets I have slain them by the words of my mouth and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth for I desired Mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings revelation of Christ more than your burnt offerings oh brother I've been on the mission field month after month where are your children where's your relationship as a minister I get and I study and I preach but I still have to keep myself in devotion in serving God this is just a channel that God uses but if I don't keep myself in the devotions for my personal life you see me get up here and preach and you have zero confidence because my family is falling apart knowledge of God more than burnt offerings foreign but they like men have transgressed the Covenant God has put so much into a covenant he made a covenant with Noah he made a covenant with Adam and Eve when they he dressed them in bloody skins he made a covenant with Noah he made a covenant with Abraham God's covenant but you they transgressed the covenants they're there have they dealt treacherously against me while we were yet sinners Christ died for us how could we not put our heart into serving him amen how could we allow idolatry to come in to where we look at the word if we look at the Bible as just the book and we turn it into rules and regulations for our kids we turn into rules and regulations for ourselves and we'll go to church when we feel like it yeah while you were Sinners God died for you he wants relationship not idolatry he doesn't want your burnt offerings he wants you to have a revelation and he wants you to serve him and he wants you to follow his word amen Saul said oh we saved The Oxen from the enemy for burnt offerings Samuel said that's not what God wants he wants obedience to his word we're no longer in a season of playing around we are face to face with our enemy if you're face to face with your enemy and you look away one second what's he gonna do he's gonna strike you amen that's why you have to be you want to stay fake face to face with the Enemy you take care of your devotions I preach I preach this at Thursday night in Portland and I preached Sunday night and brother Jones a sermon called brother dig another ditch talking about the story of the make the valley full of ditches you have to constantly be digging ditches to prepare the way for the water of the word to wash your life because when the wind blows the ditches fill up and you have to go dig them again you have to keep on digging up that route that Spirit of idology that wants to come in your house that wants to come into your life go into your your your kids rooms surprise them that's right surprise and let me look at your phone know what they're wearing look let me see your outfit okay now or okay that looks good be the holy spirit amen and then when they're not with you you say God I can't be there but be there with them give them the strength because they're fighting battles just like you and I give them the strength do not put the pants on again at school God give them the strength when they're alone to not look at the pornography give them the strength and they're alone to not pick up the the cigarette from the body or the vapor The Vape the e-cigarette because it tastes good right the devil is just so brought it down to anybody can just pick up and vape it there's no learning curve and they're addicted to nicotine because it's sweet it's flavored blueberry what do you want watermelon that's where the devil has fine-tuned it but so has God because when the enemy comes in like a flood God raises up a standard are you one of them yeah Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity and is polluted with blood Gilead right in Ephraim I believe so the mount what was the what was that religion sacrificing of their children innocent blood of kids and as troops of robbers wait for a man so the company of priests murder in the way by consent for they commit lewdness immorality fornication lewdness that's what that is what is this this is this he's talking about iframe but this is the same thing as belpure that same spirit it was sex at the beginning it's going to be sex at the end that is why it's in your face and that is why we as men and God have to just start saying it across the pulpit man you go on a store you say God guard my eyes because guess what you're going to see what 20 30 30 50 years ago I don't know how long you had to go find somewhere now they're it's right there in the magazines and they're wearing it in public that's right I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel there is whoredom in Ephraim Israel is defiled what is Israel the church the church is defiled how do we keep that Spirit bring this right down home today how do we keep that Spirit out of Grace Tabernacle amen each one of you keeps that Spirit out of your life and out of your home okay that spirit's not in your home your kids have to go outside of your home somewhere else to fight it exactly right and that's a lot harder to do when you say nine o'clock is your curfew you got someone you got a kid who's and I I don't have teenagers yet but I remember being a teenager if you got a kid who's not doing well then make their curfew 6 pm now if they break that well you you can punish them discipline them but sometimes we have to get serious all I'm trying to say I'm trying to tell you how to parent I'm trying to tell you got to get serious about this stuff the spirit I was talking with the brother who's a who's an FBI agent and uh very well aware of the sex trafficking in the world today and uh just different things and online and and um we were talking and it's the elephant in the room nobody wants to talk about but it's lewdness is the is the byproduct of that Spirit of idolatry well we'll talk about the spirit of idolatry in the church and you know the doctrines and but it's immorality is the cause of that amen parents have that discussion with your kids at age appropriate of course but start when they're young you can say it a different way well why Dad well I'll tell you when you're overall you always say that Hosea 7 verse 1. when I would have healed Israel then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered and the wickedness wickedness of Samaria brother I'm standing on the platform he says step right this way brother I see you I see okay you're from Illinois you live on 4250 Baker Street oh you want to be healed of cancer will you give up those cigarettes and serve God I would have hit Israel but the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered God comes to heal then he discovers the sin in your life he discovers that in your life now Ephraim that they were over with they're off the book you're still there the words comes I the Lord desires to heal you will you take care of that thing in your life will you go do that and take care of that thing in your life you don't have to be like Ephraim we're gonna get there the wickedness of Samaria for they commit falsehood and the thief thief cometh in and the troop of robbers spoileth without verse 10. and the pride of Israel testify oh I have that one in there twice to his face oh excuse me it's not in there twice and the pride of Israel testifies to his face and they they do not return to the Lord their God nor seek him for all of this the pride of Israel Christ directly to their face and they still don't return to the Lord the word spoken and they turn it down that's the that's the dividing line you say oh no I've sinned and I've done all of this no no use of a desire to do what God wants you to do you are not here for him but this is a this is an admonishment this morning of what that Spirit of idolatry can do to your life can do to your family can do to our church we go here this is where we live chapter 8 verse 9. for they are gone for they are gone up to Assyria a wild ass Alone by himself Ephraim hath hired lovers oh we we can't find love in the end God so we're going to go hire it out we're going to go hire some prostitutes 8 11 because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin altar shall be unto him to sin 9 verse 1. Rejoice not o Israel for joy as other people for thou has gone a whoring from thy God thou Hast loved a reward upon every corn floor the floor and the wine press shall not feed them and the new wine shall fail in her God's seed will never anchor in a womb that has the seed of idolatry the new wine the Holy Spirit brother God says that's why brother I said you can't put new wine in an old bottle you got to be changed first don't let that new wine fail within you don't let that happen say God change me they shall not dwell verse 3 in the Lord's land but Ephraim shall return to Egypt yeah that's it and you'll eat the unclean things in Assyria the manifestation of that spirit is a return to the world like a dog back to its vomit that Spirit manifests and brings them in that individual back to the world maybe they're still in the they're still in church but they're looking like the world more and more every day why is worldliness such a problem I don't know how much of you travel around but you travel around and you see it and you wonder what are we missing why are you dressing like that don't you have a clue I think part of it is parents not being open about it dodging around it the elephant in the room no tell your girl you dress like that man looks after you and wants to have sex with you that's how we have to that's the devil's doing it he's speaking it like that so we're gonna hide and no oh you know we got the profit and it's holy no it's messy I heard a song I think about it was not a silent night when Jesus was born Mary screaming what trying to find a place and I thought you know they kind of have a point there I understand the Silent Night part was peace and and everything that came but there was a time there was a bit of a chaos you know don't get the hay on the new baby don't get the poop on the new baby pick up Joseph pick it up quick pick it up it's a mess sometimes we have to get in and roll up our sleeves and just say this is this is just what we're going to have to do we're going to have to have this conversation and you know what parents as a youth leader I can tell you this your parent your kids know more than you think they do about the world because today it's everywhere right on down to NASA's and Elena's age they know stuff that you would be surprised they know even in a message home because that's the devil he's anointed it at a younger age because God has the 11th Hour worker it's the devil's coming for them 9 verse 10. I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness I saw your fathers as the first stripe in the Fig Tree at her first time but they went to Bell peor at one time part of the of the anointing at one time a part of the word Judas at one time ifram at one time but then he said I gotta handle this myself and set up an idol right in the house of God but they went to belpure and separated themselves into unto that shame and their Abominations were according as they loved as for Ephraim their Glory shall Fly Away like a bird from the birth and from the womb and from the conception though they bring up their children yet will I bereave them that there shall not be a man left yea woe also to them when I depart from them no seed raised up Ephraim as I saw Tyrus is planted in a pleasant place but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer give them O Lord What wilt thou give them a miscarrying womb and a dry breasts no life dead Eternal separation Eternal separation all their wickedness is in gilgal for there I hated them for their wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house I will love them no more all their princes all revolters Ephraim is smitten their root is dried up they shall bear no fruit yea though they bring forth yet will I slay even the Beloved fruit of their womb my God will cast them away because they did not hearken unto him and they shall be Wanderers among the Nations couple more Hosea 12 verse 1. Ephraim feateth on wind the eating the thin air nothing no meat to their words nothing to their actions oh they can sound right but there's nothing packed backing them up and follow us after the East Wind he did he delay increased lies he daily excuse me increases lies and desolation and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians and oil is carried into Egypt Ephraim was the had the oil their oil is carried away into Egypt the world swallowed the flame no oil no fire don't let the world swallow your oil you keep that flame burning bright you got to keep adding that oil pouring in that oil from the word 13 Verse 1 when they're from spank trembling he exalted himself in Israel but when he offended in Baal he died that's it right there if from spake trembling it was humbleness in God and he exalted in Israel but then he fell in Bell and he died God took took them away you say wow brother Chris what a hopeless picture saying I was studying just yesterday and I mentioned the December 17th but I began to read in Ezra chapter 9 and 10. and a lot of times I'll listen to like soft music instrumental music while I study helps block the noise of the kids out too and this picture has been painted for me already of Ephraim and idolatry I thought oh God what what are we doing in our lives how are our lives because I'm not gonna my name's not gonna be blotted off the book but God what am I doing to cause what am I doing that's idolatry and then begin to read in Ezra chapter 9 and 10. and as I'm reading it that song begins to play in my ear oh man Zing Grace how sweet no sound and I thought oh God that's it that's it say well what's Ezra 9 we're going to read it but first we have Hosea 13. verse 9. o Israel thou Hast destroyed thyself but in me is thine help I will be thy King when there is any other that my safety in all thy cities and the judges of whom thou said is give me a king and princes I gave thee a king and my anger Saul and took him away in my wrath the iniquity of Ephraim has bound up his sin is hid the Sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him he is an unwise son for he shall not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children I will Ransom them from the power of the grave I will redeem them from death o death I will be thy plagues oh great Obe thy destruction repentance shall be hid for mine eyes I will Ransom you bride I will Ransom you from the power of death I will bring plagues upon death I will bring destruction on the grave I'll Ransom you amen oh Israel Hosea 14 1 oh Israel return unto the Lord thy God for thou has fallen by thine iniquity God calling out to Israel to his bride his church his love 14 4 I will heal their backsliding I will love them freely in other words I'm not going to love them reservedly because they backslid no I'm gonna pull them I'm gonna rescue them from their backsliding and I'm gonna love them freely I'm not gonna hold anything against them I will love them freely for my anger is turned away from him Ephraim and that is for an example of how God looks at idolatry and what's going to happen at the Judgment but you have a chance today amen for God is ready to heal your backslide to love you freely his anger is already turned from you and he is here calling you I was pondering why this is being preached so much and I thought of that quote this is from The Tote The Rapture and as soon as it went out can you mute me real quick I got a as soon as it went out every time one of them would come they'd go out to a certain place then drop off I just hear the sound of it as it went away this is the preview of the Bride the vision then I heard something like Onward Christian Soldiers I looked and here come that sainted bunch of little girls just exactly the way they was all correctly dressed their hair hanging way down their backs smooth clean marching like this to the step of the Gospel not the song The Gospel she was the word they look like one of out of every nation you say what were the word brother Chris we don't need this kind of preaching today finish the quote they look like one out of every nation I was looking at it as they passed by and seen them pass by instead of going down they started going up I noticed one of them trying two or three of them trying getting out of the line that's right I screamed stay in line and the vision left me and I was standing in the room screaming stay in line Wonder Could it already be Pat could it be already passed could the bride already be called is that what we're going through today she has to be molded and made into the image of Christ and Christ is the word that's the only things that see it's in there in the word there cannot be one thing added can't be a woman with one hand like a man and the other hand with a paw like a dog it's got to be exactly the word of the Lord yes it matters yes it down to the finest detail it matters don't let it sit there in your life even if it's just mostly okay don't stay there in your position if it's the minister just mostly okay you need the full word of God being ministered to your soul the Bride is a part of the bridegroom the woman is a part of her husband because she's taken out of the husband Eve was a part of Adam from his side and so is the bride not taken from a denomination but taken from the bosom of the word of God for this day amen all right I'm closing soon Ezra chapter 9 verse 1. if you know the story of Ezra the King of Persia allows many of the refugees of many of those that were were take the captives go back Nehemiah helped with the building of the wall and everything but Ezra was the one who helped with the re-establishment of Temple worship so Ezra's back here in Jerusalem nine verse 1. now when these things were done the princes came to me saying the people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the people of the lands doing according to their Abominations even of the canines the Hittites the parasites the jebusites the ammonites the moabites the Egyptians and the amorites for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons amen delpio but watch this story is a little bit different so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands yea the hand of the princes and rulers have been Chief in this trespass the leaders verse 5 I tried to cut it up not to spend too much time and at the evening sacrifice so he's smitten in his heart he hears this news and he's spitting in his heart at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness having rent my garment and my mantle I fell upon my knees and spread out my hands unto the Lord my God and said oh my God I am ashamed and blessed blush to lift up my face to thee my God for our iniquities are increased over our head in our trespass is grown up unto the heavens I'm ashamed Lord to even tell you to even come chapter 9 verse 15. he lays out the situation in prayer and he says oh Lord God of Israel Thou Art righteous for we remain yet escaped as it is this day behold we are before thee in our trespasses for we cannot stand before thee because of this in in this if we'll read it I don't know but he says the King of Persia has given us this opportunity help us to seize it Lord help us to take this chance this morning God has given an opportunity for me for you help us to seize this chance for we cannot stand before thee because of this in other words the King of Persia he's given us this opportunity but it'll never work if we cannot deal with this trespass God don't let it come to not chapter 10 verse 1. now when Ezra had prayed and when he had confessed weeping and casting himself down before the house of God they're assembled unto him out of Israel a very great Congregation of men women and children for the people wept very sore struck in their hearts realized what they had done wrong and they come and Shekinah the son of jahil one of the sons of ilam answered and said unto Ezra I can imagine his face is red his eyes puffy his voice broken we have trespassed against our God and have taken strange wives of the people of the land yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing there was nothing these women we're normal women except that they belonged to Moab but if you met them you might have been nice people but God had a word that he wanted them to keep now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives such as our born of them and such as our born of them according to the counsel of my Lord and of those that tremble at the Commandment of our God and let it be done according to the law here you have a people Married With Children and so we're ready to keep the word of God this is a spiritual application today not literal we're ready to keep the word of God broken in their hearts because they're going to have to send their families away but let it be done according to your they knew Bel peor they knew what happened they said now's our chance to restore Israel if this trespass can be taken care of chapter 10 verse 44. so they go and they send these they count I said we need time to do

all these had taken strained wives and some of them had wives by whom they had children this was not an easy thing to do but God forgave them they put away this was God gave them a chance the word was brought forth and God gave them a chance but brother Branham came and he preached marriage and divorced God gave them all those people present a chance that said just teach your children right don't go on that was then now we have the word today but God gives a chance God's giving a chance to you today to say I don't want idolatry in my life I don't want to look at going to church and as the message as as just something that I do and something that I'm supposed to do and and make it a tradition an idolatry and we're gonna use meeting and we got a potluck and different things like that I'm
