your ears died yet it's going to be tough fight it I'd love to hear how your trip went Let's uh and remember Sister Sue's son-in-law in prayer there was an incident at work involving a loss of life and they would just like Saints remember the family in prayer and also Ellie's at home with the flu Heidi's at home with the flu you can tell they're hanging out together so we just want to pray for a little Heidi and Ellie as well Lord would just touch their bodies and sister Sue she texted me this morning station saying she wouldn't be here so God bless you Sister Sue I know you're listening in she's having a bit of a sinus infection also 15 inches of snow will kind of hinder anybody from coming to church so we just want to pray for her lower just the presence we're feeling here will be in her room as she's listening to the service and also myself as you can see I'd rather lose my voice praising worshiping our Lord so it's a good time to lose your voice so just remember me in prayer just both my wife just having this little congestion that we're dealing with and brother Paul is it's about quarter to eight now I guess where he is so I'm sure he's preaching so let's just lift him up in prayer and brother Chris this morning as he's preaching for Brother John Andy's Lord just be with them both and give them leadership and guidance as they preach to the Saints amen if you have a need on your heart just raise your hand as we go to our heavenly father he sees our hearts he loves nothing best or better than to come and say I'm going to answer your prayer for you so why don't you coming Trevor his life okay and also saying some of the some of the saints that we were with on the bus when they got home they tested positive for covid and so we just would also like to lift them up in prayer so uh that's about our heads heavenly father thank you Lord Jesus for this opportunity to be here Lord with Saints of like Precious Faith Lord our brothers and sisters father that we lord Jesus have come together we are melded together Lord by the word of God and your spirit Lord which from the other Lord your spirit and your word are one Lord Jesus and we are your body father and you are our mind Lord Jesus and we love that Lord brother Brandon said we don't even have a thought coming Lord Jesus it's it's your will Lord and we pray for your will father and concerning these these petitions Lord that have been spoken over this Pulpit this this person who lost his life father sister Sue's son-in-laws friend or co-worker father we lift up this family Lord Jesus we we pray for comfort for them Lord we pray father that your spirit would visit them Lord Jesus and just Lord just bring them the peace of God that only you can do father we pray for salvation if there are souls Lord that can be saved Lord we pray that they be saved if if this is the wake-up call for some Lord Jesus let it call forth father those who would be saved Lord Jesus those who would hear Lord and receive Lord and father for these saints that were on the bus with us Lord we we pray for them too Lord Jesus we pray that you'd heal them Father and Lord for brother Paul we know he's speaking Lord

Jesus and may we hear from you father that it may be good that as we leave this place we'll say was it not good that as we walk walked and talked along the way that Lord you were with us and we know that you were with us father we love you Lord we thank you in Jesus Christ name we pray amen [Music] I'd actually like to read a couple of scriptures just really quick and you can read along if you'd like Psalm 143 starting in verse 6 and I'll read through 12. I stretch forth my hands unto thee my soul thirsteth after thee as a thirsty land Salah Hear Me speedily O Lord my spirit faileth hide not thy face from me lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit cause me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning for in thee do I trust cause me to know the way wherein I should walk for I lift up my soul unto thee Deliver Me O Lord from my enemies I flee unto them to hide to hide me teach me to do thy will for thou art my God thy spirit is good lead me into the land of uprightness Quicken Me O Lord for thy name's sake for thy righteousness sake bring my soul out of trouble and of thy mercy cut off mine enemies and destroy all of them that afflict my soul for I am thy servant also I just would like to read out of Deuteronomy 8 8. I know I'm not a pastor I'm not your minister brothers and sisters I'm not super spiritual now that I've been to Israel so everybody just relax including me Trevor just relax okay [Laughter] lawyers might have a yamaka I probably brought one back let's see uh Deuteronomy 8 and verse 8. isn't that interesting eight and eight it's interesting a land of Wheat and barley and Vines and fig trees and pomegranates a land of olive oil and honey a land wherein Thou shalt eat bread without scarceness thou shalt not lack anything in it a land whose stones are iron and out of whose Hills thou mayest dig brass when thou shalt when thou Hast eaten and Artful then Thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath given thee so those scriptures are very touching to me right now having just been back I think for sister Kerry and I both right now our head is spinning we can scarcely take in everything we've seen in nine days on a bus with 40 believers well a total of 40. and a quite a lovely man he's a a secular Jew who was our guide but very full of knowledge and a very just a delightful person and uh in nine days on a bus we we kind of hunkered down in four different areas um first at the Sea of Galilee that's where our first hotel was Carrie and I got there three days early we spent three lovely days in Netanya and brother Paul met us and sister Jerry about a day and a half later but um so the Sea of Galilee was our first tour Hotel then on down to the Dead Sea and then eventually to Jerusalem and um we saw about 42 sites and many of them biblical sites now brother George um he really tried to encourage us to not be upset with the Catholics because they have preserved these sites brother George says that if it were up to the Protestants or some of the locals there there would be no sites to see so we can at least thank the Catholics that they have preserved these sites and so not to undermine brother George because I do I actually appreciated that after he said that I'm glad he did but um uh unfortunately many of these sites that we would love to see raw and end their crude form as the way not only Christ but Peter and you know Elijah and many of the the different locations we went to were Joshua crossed the river and such it would be nice if we could just see them the way they were and there is a Catholic a Catholic stigma kind of on everything I don't want to discourage anybody if you'd love to go I think you should it was a an amazing experience but I can't go into every detail of every place we saw because first of all as Carrie and I compiled this list of these 42-ish sites that we went to and I have to give Kerry a great deal of credit because she was diligent every day to journal everything that we had seen so we referred to that journal a lot when we started compiling this list so we could kind of keep things straight in our minds you'd be surprised on day four of a day nine trip or like where have we been uh well we uh let's see you know and you're kind of Soo but some of the more touching areas that we got to see is my five minutes up yet give us your height we all went across the Sea of Galilee and um that day was really kind of Cloudy and as we did um it was just a really nice time it was cool there was just a just lovely little boat that held the 40 plus yair and George I think there was maybe 42 of us and the crew of this little vessel and then brother George asked if you know he arranged with the crew if we could just stop the boat and he played some brother Branham we listened to maybe 20 25 minutes of brother Branham and my did it set an atmosphere it was really amazing brother Brandon was just telling stories about being on the Sea of Galilee and Peter meeting Jesus and and uh afterward I can say the Holy Ghost fell on that little boat we had just glass like Sea and the sun was setting and it was very cool and the Saints as you know brothers and sisters we've all experienced just the love that we feel for each other and that was an amazing amazing experience also let me just state that one of the most significant things impacting things for me it's wonderful to see those sites it truly is but what's even greater in part of the reason I read this scripture is to see how the Lord is working today in these promises he has kept to see the Israelites their military we got to visit one of their military sites and formidable you guys these young soldiers carrying m4s and who are delightful people to speak to and they have a lot to be proud about another site we went to was just a garden where I'm not sure of the whole story I believe it was a Ukrainian family that actually decided you know we're gonna we're going to take this piece of land that's kind of between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and we're going to plant all of the different fruits and vegetation that are mentioned in the Bible and in many cases brothers and sisters these places in natural they don't grow together you don't find this anywhere in the world except Israel Israel where you find this Lebanese Cedar right next to a date palm tree and pomegranates growing and this family who did this some 75-ish years ago and of course the sun took it over and made it into what it is today and yair really shined in this area he was very knowledgeable about all these plants and he has a very good understanding even as a secular Jew of the scriptures and so showing and demonstrating how all of these things and how God has kept his word and brother George was diligent throughout that the reason all these things are taking place is because they were prophesied it was thus saith the Lord and now today it's amazing to see that Israel is is blooming a blooming flower and it's it's delightful to see I'll stop right there brothers and sisters I appreciate this opportunity but uh if you ever get a chance go to Israel God bless you all all right I was just warming him up for dinner dates all right so you have a lot of dinner dates praise the Lord let's turn the service to Brother David as he comes let's sing 7 14. [Music] we'll sing the first and the last verse a country where no Twilight Shadows deep end and then unending days where night will never be a city when a storm clouds cannot yeah together all this is just what heaven means to me what will it be when we get all the Yonder and join the throne around the glasses we'll join our loved ones and Crown cries forever for this is just what heaven means to me and when at last we see the face of Jesus before his image of all sleep and when they crown him Lord of all I'll be there oh this is just what have I mean means to me one will it be accomplishment David Yonder and join the throne around the glasses [Music] forever [Music] for this is just like what heaven needs to me hallelujah amen you're looking forward to meeting him face to face amen we have and we will amen we will we're looking forward to seeing Jesus Christ Our Lord and Savior meeting him in the air amen we have a message just carrying us to that meeting it's called The Coming of the Lord [Music] amen it's the mystery that only the bride can understand because she's born again amen and so God bless you brother Trevor sister Carrie we've been there we know what you're going through and I would encourage behind him to say if you have an opportunity go to Israel we were on that sea that's when that Dove appeared above us in the cloud such a presence exactly I know exactly what you're talking about I can feel it already right now [Music] appreciate the testimony amen I know you've come back change we did nobody can express yes there's a lot of other things but to know you were walking on the very ground that Jesus Christ did the word made flesh now here he is in Bride form walking on the same ground the word made flesh that's enough to make me shout the roof off if you want to know I don't want to take any more time I'm starting a little bit here late and I want to title this again as we take the word if you'll stand with me the white Throne judgment part three and actually I'll probably I'm going to say part 3A because I want to finish it on Wednesday so you bear with me please and give me your undivided attention don't that doesn't mean stop drawing that means draw in the harder you draw the faster I'll preach so so it's just God knows all things and he's in control and I want to be submitted completely to him and stop where I should stop is that what you want do you want God to have his way or are you just playing Church let's have his way that's all we want let's God let God have his way amen the white Throne judgment part 3A you that weren't here and haven't been here and weren't here last Wednesday I encourage you to get or when I ministered last Wednesday that was on I don't know I was the 30th and get that message because these things all go together and I I can't go back and reiterate everything and this is taken out of the Smyrna or not summer and Sardis Church age and at the at the at the beginning of it it's it's on the promise to the overcomer and it goes right on to the end so if you want to read it and can read it I suggest you will and let God speak to your hearts amen because it Blends every I had you can't take everything it's all over the message just everywhere I spent all day yesterday going through quotes saying Lord how do I break this down I just stepped on the scene this is the way I want it I answer to nobody here I'm answering to God for what I can be I'm saying and God knows I have nothing but Divine love for you and I trust you have the same for me because I speak the truth there's someone going to receive the truth the bride speaks the truth amen okay turn with me to to your Bibles to Revelations 20. and before we well I'll take the scripture and then I'll come back to a few things here my subject under this part 3 a is names blotted out this is a very hard subject to preach but it's a very needed subject to preach name splotted out or other words we re we are are speaking of removed from The Book of Life these that are removed are borderline Christians we're talking about borderline Christians the seed of discrepancy their name is on the book but then blotted out removed Revelations 20 11 which we've read at the start of this through 15 and I saw a great white Throne judgment or excuse me I saw a great white throne in him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and I saw the dead small and great stand before God this is the second Resurrection after the second resurrection and the books were opened the books here are is of your life the books is the record of your life so everyone that stands before there everyone that stands Before the Throne to be judged come up at the second Resurrection those books were opened and the record of their life was absolutely opened foreign it's the book of your life and the books were opened then another book was opened which is The Book of Life Now not not plural their books books its book of life and only names are therein names are persons and and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books so there's their works there's their life everything is wide open I've already covered all that so I won't try to and according and they're at the written in the books according to their works so their Works had to match if their names in The Book of Life their Works had to match that book and the Book of Life Is The Word has to be found in the word amen amen and the Sea gave up the dead Witcher in it second resurrection and the death and Hell gave up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book singular of life was cast into the Lake of Fire you may be seated have other scriptures to blot brother Brandon used the word blot and the and the and the brother bran and the scriptures also use the word blot because in the scripture found in in Revelations 3 and 5 it says he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and his only angels brother Brown said he that overcometh referring to the scripture again paragraph 101 he that overcometh I will not blot now when I say paragraph numbers I'm using Brother George's book here okay so if you wonder where the paragraph numbers I do that for those online and greetings to those that are in line God bless you welcome this morning amen and I say welcome to every one of us amen because we're here now in the presence of the king I hope you're aware of that you're not in the presence of a man a preacher you're in the presence of the king of kings amen and he I believe is going to speak and does speak through the same voice of his seventh angel speaks to the same that voice speaks through the ministry today of the fivefold ministry amen we're all going to stand at that time all will be there there will be some standing before the judgment and a bride standing in judgment of them amen so we're all going to be there at that place it's going to be a final disposition of the whole thing after that the books are sealed that's it amen all right so we're so now we're why are you bringing this in this hour because we're very close the bride's so close of leaving remember the Gentiles are finished then are you with me it turns completely to Israel amen that's why they're in their land that's why they're prospering he said it would return that way and we see scriptures being fulfilled my my and if you really are in the message of the hour and feeding on the word and feeding on the message I took those both the same you know you must have your Bible in this message must go together and you're never going to understand what the Bible's saying of this day unless you come through the interpretation of God using a prophet to interpret his word you'll never do it you can have all the words you want but you'll never come to the revelation of this without hearing what a prophet has said what God has said to a prophet and what God has said to the prophet the bride will say the same thing right amen so so you see we're we're in a we're in a real position today at this time we're at the end how many realize we're at the end the prophet said we've arrived the Seven Seals defined that that we have arrived we are at the end of time we're not the end we say the end the end we don't know when that day will be for the Gentiles but that day of the Resurrection but we're at the end and it's this and no other age to follow we are in the grain time amen we're in the bride time Jesus Christ in Bride form time okay I won't want to get to preaching if I don't I won't get finished what I want to do today I say what the Lord would have us to do so I want to take this and so I've just read here where he said he said and he that overcometh I will not blot out his name out of the book of life and brother Graham said we come to a most difficult portion of the word because God has before the foundation of the world written not now no names being written now the old statement is when a a son or daughter is born of God the name put on the book no it isn't it was put on the book before the foundation of the world amen through the sovereignty and you've got to realize God is Sovereign how he wants to you but he has his foreknowledge and we were and those that were in him were written down his elect before the foundation of the world in a section of This Book of Life the book of life and the land Book of Life is the same book and the bride section is another record in that book and if you want to go to that first John chapter 5 verse 10-12 and this is the record Revelation 10 2 he held that little book that record in his in his hand was sealed with Seven Seals amen and so we see then that without being on that record and God Knows by foreknowledge who's on that record and already put them on it he put Judas in the book of life chose him but his name was blotted we'll cover that later on taken away and the reason why and God wants you to know the reason why these names are removed I went back on the last time we ministered and took took to you showed you there's going to be righteous ones amen and why they were righteous and why they were given life now some of you weren't here and I suggest you if you're going to get the whole picture you'll want you to go back and listen to that not that I'm wanting to hear you hear me preach but if you're going to if you're interested in hearing what is being said go back and hear the rest of it the rest of the story all right so blotting to blot something in scriptures to blot out of the book of life is to reject him from the number of those who are to rejecting from the number of those who are to be saved remember there's going to be those that the white through judgment given life on a basis and I won't go into detail how they were but it's based on their works that were found in the scripture we went and covered those scriptures but they were also righteous so there's righteous ones besides the bride that are at the Judgment that will be given life based on being good to the people of God the bride amen amen all right now so blot to blot out a name a person or a nation is to destroy the person or Nation to exterminate or consume now we want to look at this I want to take another description here which I'm going to go into and I've already said the borderline Christians the subject is the name removed from the book and these are the borderline Christians and the seed of discrepancy now discrepancy means a deviation I'm taking this now from the King James dictionary there's a dictionary of the King James meaning of words and you can take it whatever you want but I'm going to come to what brother Branham said and I'd rather take his definition than any others but it goes with that and so discrepancy is a deviation because I believe the way God interpreted his these words and put them and interpret the scripture we have no right to add to or take away what that Prophet said about it or put your interpretation or your opinion to it to do so if you're not careful you better watch out because your name can be easily removed amen so you must take word by word don't you put your thought to it you do what he says do because it was disobedience is the reason these things were blotted amen all right now so a deviation of discrepancy is the deviation the action of departing from an established course or accepted standard our standard the bride standard is the word the seed of God's absolute see the seed of God's absolute that the that's the bride's standard the word is the seed of God's absolute in other words the word is this you and I I believe I'm seed it's revealed to me that I'm a seed of God so the the seed of God's absolute is the word because that is the seed all right they can't deny that see that is the seed so that's the bride's standard when the enemy comes in like a flood the Holy Ghost will raise a standard what does he raise up imagination reasoning conscience no he raises up his word amen amen okay now so so I standard and so a discrepancy also is a variance or variation and it's a lack of compatibility compatibility with what the word amen it doesn't take very much Eve disbelieved one word and and caused every every death every dying baby every ambulance everything that could be evil it came through that woman and that's what started this seed of discrepancy this idolatry this is that is that fornication which is idolatry to begin right there where to carry through we see it we we see it carried right through and the sons of God cess line Seth chose the word which was the seed but then to begin to mix and saw the daughters of man not Daughters of God amen and cause the fornication and went into idolatry and God had to wipe the whole thing in Noah's day are you with me all right this this is a as I said this is a very touchy subject but it has to be ministered in this hour okay now so it's it's so and brother Branham says and it means it's sowing Discord discrepancy is sowing Discord now God hates it if you'd like to if you just turn with me over to Salt Proverbs what didn't know if I'd read this or not but I'm going to read it proverbs 6. Proverbs 6 no yeah six right and and uh verse 16. starting with verse 16. These six six things does the Lord hate yea seven are an Abomination unto him a heart that devises Wicked imaginations excuse me a proud look it's number one number one proud look a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood a heart that deviseth Wicked imaginations feet that be Swift in running to mischief you watch all this comes right down the Discord all right a false witness that speaketh lies and he that soweth Discord among brethren all right that's pretty straight that's pretty pretty strict isn't it all right brother Brown said sowing Discord this excuse me discrepancy means a sowing a a sewing Discord or being contrary Webster says sowing a Discord something different or being contrary to what's already been you can't change God God doesn't change all right you can't come along and say well we have a brand new thing no Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever he doesn't change his Revelation brother Brown said he can add to it but he never changes the revelation right and so he's he's brought us more light on the same Revelation at the opening of these seals this message has done this all right so it so it means variance it's a variance it's opposition contention and strife it's a clashing a clashing is Discord now that's a big word and brother Brown speaks much about how what clashes together when the carnal and spiritual come together there's always a Clash amen you have that every day you're in you're alive and awakened you have a clash what's clashing your own carnal thinking to what's inside your soul The Living Word Brother Brad said which voice are you going to listen to here's the promise the outside man says that's not for you the inside man says it is now which one you're going to take so he said let go of the outside man and take the Inside Man I was talking to born-again believers do you have that Clash sure you do every day Jesus said if you're going to follow me you have to deny yourself take up your cross and follow me all right so let's go over here brother Branham says this I preach here sometime to go on the disappointments at the Judgment I said The Bootlegger The Gambler The Prostitute and so forth they will be surprised they know what's coming to them and what's going to be and what's going to be the surprise is that is those fellows who thinks who thinks he's right and not that's when you see your name is not on the book that's what it's going to be hard when you think you're a Christian when you're not there's a way that seemeth right you believe intellectually that you are right you've done the right things that you thought was right you've been good you've been kind and we play with it we tamper with it with what we play with it we tamper with it and just Petty around with it and never get right into it what the truth the message the word the message is the word opened without the opening of the word there is no body change for you without the word opening in you without the opening of the word without the revelation of the word without the operation of the word we're not playing with this this is this is between death and life it takes the opening of the word to put you in your position in place amen all right now so there's where so many people today is going to be so terribly disappointed at the day of judgment he said today and we want to remember everything that's being judged in the judgment is happening to you now other words other words what I'm trying to say is if whatever you are now and whatever you're is what you're going to be there Now's the Time to make things right you can't get it right there you're not going to have opportunity to to well Lord I'm sorry no there's not going to be that is going to be forgiveness your works are happening now you're portraying what you are now right now in this hour in this time that you're alive here on this Earth so we must make sure not take an imagination we must be sure where we're standing you must be know that you met Christ don't take it because you imagine you have don't take it because you hope you have you got to have a no-so it's got to be a revelation in your soul that you have he said I'll build my church Upon This Rock of the revelation of who I am and the Gates of Hell will prevail against it you've got to have that the new birth is that opening of that word in you who is it Jesus Christ in you amen all right so he said that's where there's so many people is going to be so disappointed the day of judgment today he said today is to know that they've lived in church to know that they've done good deeds to know that they have treated their neighbor nothing can be said about good deeds and those things that's all right we believe in Good Deeds but you can have good deeds and still not be that now watch what he says treat their neighbor right to know that they have been loyal to the people loyal to the church and in their mind they believe that Jesus Christ and in their mind have believed that Jesus Christ the son of God and be condemned at the day of judgment amen all right remember these ones that were given life had done those deeds didn't even know they were doing it those righteous ones that were given eternal life that the Judgment did not know that they gave him a drink and and met him when he was in hospital and did those things I had something happen just here the other day that absolutely took place that I that fulfilled I just after I preached that on Wednesday something happened I said There It Is didn't know what they were doing they didn't know they met the word but it was already positioned in their heart to do what they did and who who determined that the Lord determined that when their name was put on The Book of Life to be receive eternal life at that day see they already did something here they don't do it over there they do it here amen they will help remember that well I'll go into that a little bit later here I'll get ahead of myself all right now Jesus said many are called and few are chosen straight is the gate and narrow is the way that leads to life and but few there be that find it so many can be called but there's few chosen amen no man he said can come to me except my father draws him and all that the father has given me will come now you didn't have anything to do with that you weren't looking for him you were the elected that God chose in his mind before the foundation of the world and you cannot be lost because you always were a part of him you were his heart purpose you were in his thoughts as substance and he spoke the word and you had to come here in this day an hour and receive that word because you cannot deny Who You Are and he can't deny you that's the elect and they come because the father Tross them they didn't have anything to do with it they were drawn by him amen so it's not a make-believer not a made-up religion it's absolutely the achievement of God through and through absolutely all the way through so don't try to get eternal life he said I go out and do good deeds and do this and try and try and try by my Works to find favor with God know it's by grace through faith faith is a revelation you can't manufacture that you can't work up enough to get that that's given you sovereignly by God amen all right now many are called and few are chosen I'd say let's brother Brown said it's not something you make up and have to do and must they think you have to do and and no he said it's just him and you living out his word a lot could be said on these little things they're all little messages but I I just got to continue on here with this all right and few that said now and I don't know how many few I pray that everyone in here makes the bride I don't know it's none of my business to know who few and who isn't few I don't know only but God does know where you're standing today and does know your heart and knows your motive and objectives you couldn't hide from him if you wanted to we already know that's been Vindicated to us that word is the discerner and the word going out right now will discern hearts and the bride will hear the word for she has an ear to receive to hear the word of God and receive it for her day and her season I don't know who that is Ministry preaches the word I'm not responsible for how you react to it how if he could get it or don't get it that's not my responsibility that's God's responsibility my responsibility is spread it every day I live I'm here to spread it you're here to spread it no matter what part you have in the body if you're born again that little portion cannot it's not bigger little portions it's absolutely God's portion it's his portion it's his doing it's his thoughts in action amen all right now the people here this morning I want you to set up and take notice of this you're old enough now you've heard enough gospel preaching till you ought to be able to get off of milk and come to a real solid gospel diet come to a place where men and women ought to stand Paul said when you ought to be teachers why you have to be taught yet he said let's go on to Perfection let's leave these little principles amen principles are okay this will do if God's so desire or so permit but let's go on Perfection I'm gonna I don't even know if I'll get to that I have Hebrews six I gotta bring out but I don't know if I'll get there but let's let's see this they have to come into Wednesday the Revelation I want you to go with me to Revelations 22. verse 8. I have to really watch here because I little Marks here that I have written down let me just look at something here yeah I think I made that clear to come today when all stand together as seen in Daniel 7 that's speaking of the same thing we just read in Revelation 20. the king will be there with his bride and in front of them will be multitudes multitudes who are to be judged yes all are there all books are open books and a final disposition of all is made amen at the Harvest indeed is over amen all right so Revelations 20 2 verse 8. and I John now John is the type of the Bride how many know that so I want you to position you are positioned in the Book of Revelation because the Book of Revelation is the full complete revelation of Jesus Christ amen all right and so I John saw these things what he saw he was commanded to write what he saw et cetera et cetera you know and heard them and when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things now I'm not afraid to tell you that angel happened to be that Prophet that stood before us in this hour that had the revelation of those seven sealed given to him the sword of the King was put in his hands and the King set forth and roared like a lion and seven Thunders uttered their voices which was the Mysteries contained in those seals revelation of those things contained in those seals I'm not ashamed to tell you that was the prophet that he went right to and bowed was going to bow at his feet right I wonder if we can see our self-identified in the scripture here all right now 9 verse 9 he showed me these things he said who was it God or the man no God did the messenger Angels the messenger all right then saith he unto me watch this messenger see thou do it not don't bow at my feet for I am thy fellow servant how many know that that's exactly the attitude our Prophet had yes never never will you find brother Branham exalting himself never he always pointed us right to Jesus Christ friends it's Jesus Christ that's in your midst who is this you say it friends it's Jesus Christ in your midst he said I can do nothing I'm waiting on him and now here he is in Bride form the same son of man is revealing himself as he promised to in this hour in a bride coming of himself it has to have that happen to fulfill the full revelation amen and the full Revelation and the opening of that word is the third pull and Satan cannot receive that neither can anyone else besides the bride I don't care it's you I believe in being good you could have all kinds that you can be good you can have every picture on the wall of brother Branham you can have all the tapes you want you can have all of that and still be lost now we're going to come to that I said this is not an easy message to preach but we're going to come down and lay it on the line can you do anything what are you going to do you're gonna if if you're one of his that word's got to come alive and open in you and it's not your guesswork you know where you're standing and you will not be flirting with these other things and trying to mix this message with other things because that Spirit of denominationalism that idolatry that that fornicating spirit is very strong is very strong and very much alive trying to infiltrate message churches right and I think if you lack discernment of that is the reason is because you need a new birth and these two spirits will be so close they will deceive even their very lack if it were possible all right now I want to keep reading here verse 9 we read okay now it says I am thy fellow servant of thy and of thy brother and the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship God verse 10 he saith unto me he says worship God who keep the sayings of this book worship God I'm of thy brother and the prophets and of them who's them you and I are portions of them amen that worship God who keep thus excuse me who keep the sayings of this book amen if God said it that settles it I don't have a right to put what I think upon it do what he said at Thy word Lord I'll let down the net Behold thy handmaid at Thy Word that's right amen but you want to put your interpretation to it and add something I'm going to get to that scripture I'm coming right to it all right now he said and he saith unto me same Angel seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book see it's been unsealed don't you seal the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still he that's filthy let him be filthy still he that's righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy still you're holy you're gonna be holy here you're righteous you can be righteous here you're filthy you'll be filthy here this word is the discerner and this word of this message of this full Revelation is a separator amen it's going to separate it's got to separate and separation is never easy because you're going to be think down upon you're going to be misunderstood because you're separated to the word amen you're going to be separated from your own carnal thinking amen amen all right now he that is unjust okay now verse 12 and behold I come quickly see behold he's saying now right behind that there's something going on then he says I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according to his work shall be now there there's a dual meaning in that because there's a bride will stand before him to receive reward or lack of reward but their salvation is set that's after the Rapture they're already in a raptured position meeting the Lord is well done by good and faithful servant Henry and I'm not talking about that's not the white Throne judgment that's another that is another standing before the bride stands before that throne to receive reward amen all right but that's not the one judgment we're talking about here okay blessed are they that do his Commandments hello here's the criteria blessed are they that do how can you do it without having revealed to you and how can you do it without the Holy Ghost in you to do it amen how can you do it without the Holy Spirit working through you and if something's being worked through you and just contrite the word without the Holy Spirit you won't even know it but with the Holy Spirit you will know it and you will repent and you will make it right so by your fruits you're known are you still with me amen all right so we come down here blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city the only one dwelling in the city brother sister is the bride and the groom there's many come in and out of the city but the only one that dwells in that City and is that City on that mountain that's the brighter self all right he said if or without without what the city are dogs and Sorcerers and warmongers and murderers and adulterers that goes right down here to today who's without who's without the truth those names that have never been put on The Book of Life are going to be there too you know never had their name even written anywhere such as pharaoh and such a certain one see their names weren't anywhere they were ordained to do what they did but what for what purpose to make the word of God shine that's a whole that's another portion we'll get into not today blessed are they that okay go down I Jesus see now watch see without our dogs sorcers War mongers even the Bible even the scriptures speak of dogs as being ministers and Sorcerers and more mongers and murders and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie be careful what you imagine someone's doing and go scatter it to somebody else amen all right bless thou watch I Jesus has sent mine angel now who's speaking through that angel I Jesus has sent mine Angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and The Offspring of David he wasn't Only The Offspring of David he was the root not only are you the Are You The Offspring of him but you're in the root to begin with to be a right Branch to Bear the the orange that the tree was in the root you're gonna the true branches will bear what was in the root I am the root and offspring of David and I'm the bright and Morning Star and the spirit and the bride brother Brown said what the spirit says to the prophet the bride will say and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let them deceit speak the same word same message and let him that Sarah say come and let him this thirst come and whosoever will take let whosoever will who has the will let him take the Water of Life freely you don't have to work up something to get it you don't have to manufacture something you don't have to try to be this and try to be that it's him working through you what a place brother Adam said what a place to live what a place to to relax and let off the pressure because you know that you've met him face to face inside that little room of your soul and you know where you've come from you know where who you are and you know where you're going I'm not saying it's being revealed more and more it is because we have that maturity growing into that headstone that headstone is our complete revelation of who we are and there's a bride today that will be absolutely their position is The Headstone the Capstone Ministry and without us they can't be perfect the ones before us we received the perfect ministry the message of the Capstone now you can take stature of a perfect man amen you have to be born again of the spirit to grow in that stature amen amen all right now let's take another oh go keep going verse now here comes the meat of it I wasn't going to read all that but I felt like the Lord wanted me too far I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book every man every individual If any man shall add unto these things God will add unto him the plagues that are written in this book If any man shall take away from the words of the book remember these two things will go right together if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of The Book of Life and out of the holy city now watch he already had his had his part in the book but it was taken out why because he add to or take away brother Brandon put those two things together to add to or take away is the same you add it or you take it away and he said their part is taken out of the book of life though they're in it as Judas was his part was taken out in fact he went right up and believed all the message except coming to the revelation of who he was the birth he couldn't take real Pentecost I'm not talking about your denominational Flair of Pentecost I'm talking about the real eternal life living and Abiding and dwelling in you it's not a make-believe it's not a bunch of emotion it's not a bunch of of works all those things are fine but it's a reality and revelation of himself living and you recognizing the day you're living in amen amen all right amen now let's go to Matthew 13. Matthew 13 brother Brown read this in seed of discrepancy and I want to take Matthew 13 36 and he said this was Jesus coming back and expressing what he just said to them about how sower went forth who the sower was and for the 36 then Jesus sent the multitude away and he and and went into the house into the house you have to meet him in the house you went into the house and his disciples came into him saying declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field and he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man now brother Branham went back to this when he first met the Pentecostal people in Mishawaka Indiana he said I met them and I hear two men prophesy and it'd be exactly right speak in tongues and prophesy but I found one was a devil and the other was a genuine Christian how could he said the Holy Spirit be falling and it was the Holy Spirit be falling on both amen and one was a hypocrite one was a fornicator living with a woman had a child by her and had still had a wife and yet the anointing was the genuine Holy Ghost falling on that man so you see tongues and interpretation there's no evidence that you've got it in your soul at all I know this rubs the wrong way that's the absolute truth amen all right now brother Brown refers to that I know these things are deep this is not something you just lightly take all right but I'm expecting God to reveal it to those that have ears to hear all right now so he said so he goes on to verse 37. they wanted to declare the Terrors of the field and he answered and said unto them he that soweth good seed to the son of man I want you to notice that went first remember in the vision he saw the son of man going around first sowing seed upon the Earth the Earth was the world the Earth okay in our day there's a sower went forth to sow the son of man went forth to sow the messenger of the hour is the son of man not the prophet the son of man he was revealing he was used to reveal the son of man you're not feeding on the bot on the on a man you are feeding on the body word of the son of man that's the carcass of our day there you'll find the Eagles are gathered where the word for the season is being preached the Eagles will gathered will gather right we're old Pentecostal brother Brown said we have gone beyond speaking in tongues countdown 1964. we're beyond that so if you use that as an I believe we speak in tongue don't get me wrong anything God put in the body but that's not that that is not the evidence of today that is not that is not the emphasis the emphasis is the revealing of the son of man in the bride form ah Hallelujah that's it because here the son of man is revealing the full revelation of himself and without that bride he's not complete it has to be an unveiling of that bride that bride is none other but himself revealed the bride brother Brown said the body the bride is himself revealed amen all right not another person it is not another voice under her messenger she is the she the bride is the final voice and it can't deviate from what God already brought and if you see what this messenger said you're going to see it in the scriptures it's not some your idea about what this quote said give me a bunch of quotes that doesn't put you in the bride revelation of the word is the evidence that you're in him and always was by the revelation of himself living in you and working through you to the promise to the hour to the time and its characteristic is known in her amen not in others in her alone that's right his nature you'll see it right in her she's a different person physically but she's the same person spiritually Hallelujah Eve looked like a different she was a woman figure and Adam but she was Mrs Adam to Mr Adam she was the mystery of Adam revealed she was the climax she was the culmation she was absolutely the finished revelation of Adam incomplete it was all in Adam but he had to express himself into a form amen Hallelujah that is your secret revealed all right now so we go on to verse 39 the enemy that sold them so we see we see the son of man went for sowing the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one so both have seed children all right and we see that from very beginning Abel Cain and Abel met two different seeds out of two different fathers but the same mother so you see where that denominational thing went through it came through the woman Hallelujah we can follow it all the way down the scriptures go right down through the scriptures to this very day right now and you find a dominating female with an iron disposition they will try to usurp the authority of man or of God himself the word by an organizational denominational Spirit which is not of God it is a fornicating idolatrous spirit and it's the spirit of organization it's the spirit of denominationalism it's a system that is against the word and yet so close without the Holy Ghost the elect would be deceived because they appear informed to be exactly alike and good works my reasoning my reasonable oh yes but not the word not the truth we better thank God that this book was opened I'm telling you what you better get yourself in that book and you better start feeding on that until all of your videos and all of these other nonsense and foolishness and everything else that you got to feed on that Satan's taken from you and hidden away from you you're going to end up on the short end because every time you feed on something off of this word you're allowing another Spirit to come in and influence you and tempt you away from the word Satan hates the word Satan hates revelation of that word but we the bride love it but that's the faith that is our Salvation that's the faith that is who we are that's the faith seed that possesses every gate of his enemy all right now God help me to get through here I just started now he says verse 39 the enemy that sold them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels and therefore now the Harvest is when is the end of the world I've got something the prophet said he said we've arrived all right he said then therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world now you're looking at the end of the world where at the end time now we're at the end of the world all right the new heavens and new earth hasn't come forth yet the millennium's over with now we're at the judgment all right now the son of man shall send forth his angels now he's come right back here at this hour that we're in the son of man shall send forth his angels and they Shall Gather out of his kingdom all things that offend it is a binding uh or bundling of the tares what's doing the separating I'll go that just a minute it's the angels but the voice of those angels comes through an angel at the end said we've arrived and this is Harvest and he sends an angel all right now he says of the Kingdom all things that offend in them which do iniquity do iniquity do what do that which they know is the right thing to do but they will not do it because they have to say face before others that's a lot of the reason that's not the only reason they can't do it because it's not in them to do it see it's got to be in you if you have a pull towards god you're an individual when you have that pull you better yield to that pull toward him you've got to yield to that that's what God wants you that's what he put that thirst in you to do and quit trying to lift yourself up among the people and think I've got to do something to serve the people to satisfy the people what will they think about me if I don't that's exactly those names that are removed I'd said that because that is true but if you have me one of his bride it'll strike your heart say God forgive me I don't mean to do like that okay now and so they offend he'll draw out and they shall and shall cast them brother Brown said they aren't burned at the bundling they're burned later at the white Throne they're cast so he says and then shall cast him into a furnace of fire there shall be there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth that's the Great Tribulation they miss it amen all right and then shall the righteous shine forth as the son as what as the sun I wonder if that could be s-o-n in the Kingdom of their father who hath ears to hear Let Him hear all right I want to take you to the seat of discrepancy here paragraph five and this was this was preached on 65 January 18th Jesus given the interpretation of the parable himself therefore we know what the interpretation means and now as we approach this of this sowing of the seed and of the reaping now he interprets it and then I believe that Jesus was speaking of the parable in his day but was meaning it to be at the end of the world at the end of the age he said or he said at the end of the world or the End of the Age which is this day so brother Brown I'm saying this is what this is the day we're in everything going to fall right off and certainly it's going to come to full manifestation and judgment all right okay now he said which is this day so work to what's happening the word goes out the Revelation goes out the bride picks it up the others can't receive it and we'll move off into tribulation come up at the second resurrection and what they did what they how they thought and what their attitude was toward the word that was ministered to them will be judged amen all right now the Gathering he said it said I believe the little text tonight is very appropriate for the hour we're living in because Jesus distinctly said here the Gathering would be at the end of the world and that's when the end would be the Gathering of the wheat also the garnering of the tares and burning them and take and to take in the wheat into the kingdom all right then we go to then we go on here to uh paragraph six now Jesus said the two would be so close next paragraph would be so close together till it would deceive the very elected if it were possible almost exactly the same so it's not that closeness isn't out here in these denominations the closest is right here in the message around the message we've been 50 some years since the denomination put the word out been knocking trying to get that last one to come out is that right on the door of the church to the individual calling the individual out come out go into what life and at the same time the bride that comes out then laying in the presence of the sun to ripen but so the sun shines upon them and the tares and the prophet already sent out his word it already went out his mouth as a sharp sword the word did and it's going to separate those two gonna bundle one gonna deliver the other amen all right gonna gather one and get bundle the other one gather the other one into the into the let's go back here and see what something the prophet said here I want to pick this up right here talking about those borderline Christians no that isn't where I want it at all let me see just a minute now um well we'll get to it I just can't locate it right now oh I think I know where I'm at now 226. well I'll just go to it I just felt checked on that so let me just I'll get to it because I have it in my in the book here okay I have page 91 and 92 of this church age book page 91 and 92. okay and I just read to you if you add to or take from 91 and 92 paragraph 75 70 75. brother Graham said it sounds like to you this anti-word Antichrist spirit is a complete repudiation of the word a denial of the Bible culminating in its rejection no sir it's not that he said what it is it's the changing of even just one word and by taking away or adding to it oh my God sent a prophet we believe that okay but what did he say well we we believe in dressing long dresses what's that slit there kind of like cutting hair why are you trimming it it's the same as cutting well my dress is long yeah but how skin tight is it what are you drawing attention to the holy God or the holy self a man that will look upon you because you dress that way and lust after you is committed adultery with you that and will be accounted in adulterer and he'll say well who would I do it with here she is or who'd I do with here he is don't tell me they're not religious they're more religious than what you think and they can act religion a lot better than the bride can and put on clothes that pertain you can have a dress that even even pertains you look up the word pertained you want to have pockets you want to have something that pertains to a man even pertaineth to them be careful don't see how close you can get to the edge see how far away you can stay from it see I didn't know what brother if you were here Wednesday I didn't know what brother Chris was preaching on but I said brother don't go any further because he was talking I took up Judas I had the same quotes I said it seamlessly put together he didn't know it I I was preaching on and I didn't know what he was preaching on so that's the Holy Ghost working Among Us not the man all right now it's changing even just one word Eve fell by one word well I'll let him get by today without with one word they don't disability I don't believe that one word you know I thought that's all right I'm a wishy-washy God I can compromise with him no he won't one word disbelief taken from this are added to it don't you put your interpretation of what God spoke through a prophet and interpreted to you this is what the scripture means well I don't believe what he said be careful your name can be easily removed right there and you go and live and act that out what is in your heart to make you do that you say Brother David what are you preaching for I pray that somehow the word might strike and uncover a spirit that you might be delivered aren't you afraid of pending people if the word offends you I'm sorry but if David has in his Spirit to be an offensive thing to you I need to be at the altar but woe unto me if I don't preach this gospel because I'm going to have to give answer well who said this when did I hear that hear am I Lord there it is right before him here's what was said amen on the 11th of December 2022. amen that's how real you've got to recognize this message is not a play thing coming to church is not a play thing either you have the love to come to church and want to be among the people or you don't and you're doing it because you think it's your duty may God Smite that soul and open up if there's anything to be opened in your soul may you realize where you're standing huh well I don't like the way you preach it I'm sorry God does amen you see it Pricks my heart it defends me well well can we live a Christian Life and not be offensive to someone can the gospel be preached in its straightness and not offend I guarantee you the gospel itself the living word for this season preached in that power of revelation will never offend the bride never she may wonder how it's why and then God unveils it to her you can be absolutely sure that if you're right with God God's not going to let you deviate off the path that he'll scream and say get in line quit getting your eyes out here upon what other people are doing quit comparing yourself with someone else especially young people it's you between you and God it's an individual Affair you are answerable to him you're not answerable to your friends you're not answerable to anyone else but him right all right but just change one word by adding or taking it away just see how close you can do and to dress and be careful what you're doing because you have a spirit motivating you on everything you do everything you say even the color clothes you wear right it's got a spirit that motivates you one way or the other look what you're dabbling into trying to mix the word with some something else that's off the word instead of taking the word as your absolute you've got to take that plus it's not Jesus Plus it's Jesus alone his word is absolutely perfect and the fruit you're bearing is not that word it's a mix a little of the world a little of what others have said trying to bring something else that's contrary to the word but you can't discern it the reason you can't you need a new birth you can be Sanctified and still go to hell hello if you don't retain that sanctification and you trample under feet because you won't believe the word and despise that blood that did sanctify you and counted an Unholy thing the prophet said you you are absolutely indicted as crucifying Jesus Christ afresh and he's here right here in Bride form bringing the word to you every day not only the preacher the members of his body can't do anything but declare him today to be the same will they suffer yes they'll suffer they'll suffer the very closest thing to them a lot of times their own family that's the truth what God what Brother Brad what'd the word say I bring a sword to do what Jesus said I bring a sword to separate separate you to who to some theology some idea to something off his word to some other dictate to some other book to some other reading to some other psychology it's the word everything you need but the devil's buffaloing you and making you believe you don't have everything you need in this message if you are in the message you would absolutely live it amen all right it's the original trick of Satan in the Garden of Eden he just added one little word to what God Said that did it it brought death and destruction and Ephesus it was the same just a word added just a word taken away and the anti-word Antichrist Spirit began to flourish did you get it there are those twins again and today we have twins again brother Brandon said that the one twin will be a Pentecostal denominational Fair and the other will be a genuine word birthed it's grain seed of the season again Alpha and Omega and the prophet said she is omega he's Alpha she's Omega he's Alpha he's Omega amen it's him you can't separate the bride from him whatever he is and promise of him Promises of her for she is in him she doesn't come before him she comes in him men amen a man amen hallelujah those two trees are growing again side by side in the same the same Earth ground partaking of the same nourishment drinking in the same rain benefiting by the same Sun but they come from different seeds one tree is for the word of God exactly as God gave it and loves and obeys it the other tree is the seed that is anti the word of God and changes it where it wants to it substitutes its own Creed and dogmas for the living true word exactly as did Cain who ended up killing Abel but fear not little flocks stay with the word keep that word between you and the devil Eve did not do that and she failed and when the church lets down on the word and she goes into the depths of the darkness of Satan that's not speaking of the church bride going in the depths of Satan the bride comes out of that church that she will go into those depths because she will not keep the truth but if you're really born again if you're really truly child of God you'll be in that word the prophet said all the way he said there's your evidence amen amen I love it I love the word it just lays it out straight I love it amen all right now first John 4. now let's let's go back here to seed of discrepancy I'm coming I got to come to a close and I haven't even touched this message I don't know how I'm going to finish it on Wednesday God help us that's all I can do maybe I'll have another opportunity some other time first John 4 I mean excuse me you can turn there but in in chat in verse in uh paragraph 17 of the seed of discrepancy and the vision was interpreted the rain falls on the just and the unjust The Same Spirit can fall in a meeting and everybody rejoice in it Hypocrites Christians and all together exactly right but what is it by their fruits they are known brother Brahm to it over and over again anointed once the end time said what is the fruit it's the fruit it's the word for the season not your emotion not how many Devils you he said never judge your life by how many Devils you can cast out because Judas cast out Devils through the name of Jesus Christ and he was a son of Satan then what did it was it Satan cast out Satan no but it was the it was the word that he received from Jesus I give you power over it and he took that word and believed that amen are you with me and the Holy Ghost casts out that devil and Satan using that anointing see how close it is you can dress the part you can live the part you can work the part everywhere part you want to but unless that soul is the seed of God you're going you're not going to go in the rapture and who determined that God in his sovereignty placed it on the book of life before the foundation World by what he knew now who's going to tell him he made he didn't know the right thing so you see where we're at but I'm not saying you're in and you're out you're in you're out no but they're fruit the word has to be ministered because it's by the opening of the word is the only way you're going to be delivered from that thing that wants to hold you bound and that thing happens to be the devil amen he's anti-word Antichrist but God wants you to see your position is Christ the devil doesn't want you to see your position as Christ and if it's Christ then you're going to stay with the word and if something you're doing and preaching and no woman has a right to your serp authority over a man and go out and teach something that's contrary to this word you can't even do it you can't even teach it and try to take a position even as a preacher we know that I think we're versed enough in that but what these other things that you think you can go out there and mix with the word and it's off of the word I I say to you if you don't think that's true go and search it out and find out if it's off the word or not if you say you've got the Holy Ghost why aren't you Discerning what's right instead your your wife is your serpent authority over her husband and you don't have enough discernment to keep your house in order where are you ending up amen that wasn't me that said that that may have been my voice but that wasn't me that said that he said that and God knows who he's talking to it's time you better make sure where you're standing don't just play with this message well I'll come and see if it's right or not all right now I've got to have to close because I have something I wanna I wanna I wanna read a testimony so I may have to skip a lot of this by the fruits they are known see you see how Wild Oats and wild wheat and grain sometimes impersonated genuine domestic grain so close that would deceive the very elected I think we're living in a timely age when these things should be preached on and talked about I'll read that quote again what's he talking about Hebrews 6 Hebrews 10. the rain falling of the just and the unjust what makes it what makes the difference their soul not the anointing they can't hear the word they can't receive the word and therefore they come away and they reject the word they don't obey the word they say well it doesn't mean it there it add to and take from amen all right and he said now notice these things he said we're living in a timely age when these things should be preached on and talked about notice verse 41 2 very close so close in the last days he could not depend on some certain Church to separate him you say the well I'm just going to take it from Methodist the Baptist to some message church out here over there somewhere else around the world to separate them amen all right it's not you belong to church you need to come to church but you better be careful where you're feeding on what you're feeding on all right now he said he sends his angels to separate them now watch what the prophet says an angel Not Angels an angel he sends his angels did not isn't that what we had shown to us in the sky angels what'd they do made up is what Authority God had his authority to those angels Seven Stars seven angels met with one messenger in a little room an angel and God took that word and put it in the hand of that angel his own sword then who are we who are we hearing from when we feed on this open book we are hearing from the king of kings that ought to make some difference to you put it in his hand and said it's the sword of the king not a king the king and he cried with the voice of the lion roarth and when he had cried the book opened and in that book was the mystery revealed that called your name amen there it is right there that little book was the record it was a record it was a section of the Book of Life whose names could never be removed because the record he gave us the records of his own life which is eternal and he who hath that son hath life who has the seed has life he who hath not the son hath not life amen and brother Branham In This Very message I'm taught I've already done it the first message I preached right here on this series he said right there he said that little book that open book which he called the bride book he said and also he called the the weddings the marriage certificate he said be an opened calls her amen come right by his side and take her position as Queen having this having under him the the ownership of the property he owns and under under his sovereignty she's Sovereign under sovereignty amen she's given Authority Under sovereignty are you with me just go back to Esther and queen and king assurus and see if that isn't right Ashera so whatever you call it okay now I've got to close off and I gotta get to one quote here well watch this but an Angel is coming to bring the separation he said brother Branham bringing the interpretation an Angel is coming to bring the separation the segregation between the right and the wrong and no one can do it but the angel of the Lord he's the one that is going to tell which is right and which is wrong all right brother Bradham said I had to be caught up in that that those angels to make the seventh I had to meet that Mighty Angel and I had to meet him to come back with the interpretation of that seventh seal all right so there's something pertains and brother Brad and the prophet said it's the revelation of his coming and he said only the bride knows that secret why because only she can see that the words being fulfilled now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in his bride coming in his bride okay Christ The Mystery of God revealed now we see it he didn't say we're going to that's our Lord up there he said and you talk about something the devil wants to water down and water down and water down is the Turning of the corner in 1963. you say that's not Soul then how why'd he turn a corner in 1956 he said God doesn't turn those Corners oh yes he does he said we're building a house not a straight wall it had a meaning absolutely had a meaning or he said this this this nation's either going to receive or reject this gospel and make the difference in 1956 he divided it he turned the corner and in 63 he did it again nobody's taken away with what he said earlier nobody's taken away anything but we see the Turning of the corner to the grain itself and to see that uniting of the Bride with him and it's his coming and now she is fulfilling that in another form and it has to be fulfilled that way because we've got to meet him in the air and without this Revelation there would be no meaning it's the Revelation and it's that mystery that you are was in him and was hid away under that seventh seal that's completely opened up to you and Vindicated to you amen amen now so an angel Not Angels down through here these Seven Ages Not Angels but Angels but Angels at the last time would gather together amen angels with the last time would gather together foreign now we know that this is the coming Harvest time now now an angel is actually interpreted a messenger and we see there are seven angels through the churches but now he said now now he said no the seven angels not now Angels now he said no he said no through the church ages but now an angel comes to deliver the message amen the hidden Mystery the hidden secret what is it through there that pertains to you who you are and your ordained position he uncovered that devil and he can't have what you've got he can't receive it and God hid it right down to the end he has no time to do anything with it too late Glory amen so the seed of God the word of God and the children of God the children of the Kingdom has become the seed of God and they must be the word of God the word of God manifested in the age that they're living in they're the pro they are the promised seed of the age each age had its seed its time its promise now we see the Promise all right now each age is given a promise of the word and the people of that age that manifest the promise word is the seed of that age the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operating through his children brother Brown said he would come and he would work in and through his bride all right now he said there's only the now I could speak a lot about Judas but if I get into that I'm going to carry way over you know I'm only on page two and I have seven of them so God help us I've got to get to this and I will intend to get to it all the way through as God will open the door but listen I'm just trying to hit the synopsis of it fast here because Judas was one of those that the spirit fell upon but his name was removed why because he couldn't come up to Pentecost to receive a new birth amen he couldn't the Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost falling upon a genuine seed of God is the new birth now will you give me about 10 minutes okay and I will I will try to close this off so the seed of God brother Branham said is the interpretation of the word you are written Epistles red of all men now I didn't say she was You're The Interpreter you're the interpretation it went from Prophet to his prophecy and you're the interpretation of the Word of Promise of this day that's the seed if you only realize that you're the seed it'll change you because that thought of you had to come forth as a word and you were in that thought then that thought of himself which is what you are was eternal if you ever get a hold of that I'll tell you right now you can't unless you're born again but if you ever get a hold of that you'll never doubt it again you know you're walking with God and if you're walking with God I say what do you have to fear amen don't you depend on you have knowledge of the Mysteries you can have an intellectual knowledge of every mystery find every quote that won't do you a bit of good unless you have charity which is God himself in you it's of no good you have faith to move mountains amen every bit of it I'm going to First Corinthians 13. the difference is that God is love he is that love and without him and you none of those matter exactly because without him dwelling abiding dwelling I'm not talking about just an anointing I'm talking about him coming in and and that seed becomes alive it's been quickened to the promise you are that Living Word made manifest for this day you are the word living and in action you are the operational Living Word absolutely that can discern the difference between good and evil light and dark I don't care how close they are it's that word that discerns the difference it's that real seed that's inside of you that was birth in you that holds you and keeps you that's the real gift not my many Devils you can I believe in casting out devil don't let me I'm not trying to give a negative to that because the bride does it first then then the impersonators come behind it how many know that's right who went first Moses or Janice and Jeffries that's right he obeyed what God Said to do he didn't try to say here here you can't do that I'm the only one no they were carnal impersonators and anointed of God to do it yeah go back to Second Timothy three and find out if that's not so having a form of Godless but denying the power thereof having a form I I wanna I'll have all these things down here to get to having a form what is the form shadow it's a shadow it's just a form of a true object they look the part even believe God sent a prophet Naval able to receive the true revelation of the message that he brought not being born again or have the seed of God in their soul quickened to Life by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen the Bible said this is the message God is light and the Bible said in James 1 17 there is no variableness discrepancy or Shadow discrepancy of turning you can't add anything to white white is the original color you know what the prophet said to add anything with white is to go pale and go to death so you can't add or take away this perfect truth the perfect word this message this message which is this Bible made known in this day the promise of the day ought to be your absolute right yes sir praise the Lord that's exactly right because you know it's been Vindicated by God you know it's perfectly the truth so there's no shadow only the elect can be reborn did you know that only the elect can be born again because in them lays the seed of God to be quickened in non-elect there's nothing there to Quicken they're where soul there you are okay then so of James 17 there's no variable this is neither shadow of turning no mixing light and darkness it will not mix it cannot mix all right now we have we did I just I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to stop oh Lord Lord have we crossed out devils in your name spoke in tongues in your name done this prophesied in your name cast out Devils saw Mighty Miracles done miracles in your name he said depart from me you worker of those that knew to do what's right and you wouldn't do it iniquity I don't know you is that right yeah he never said they didn't do it Jesus said if I cast out Devils by the Finger of God who do you Pharisees and Sadducees who do your children cast them out by cathus prophesied it was correct this prophecy Balaam prophesied and was correctness prophecy both anointed to do so but faults in their teaching their teaching of Balaam was idolatry the teaching of Balaam was to mix the true word and God looked upon that Israel and said you belong to no Nation I've accepted you as a separate people and you don't belong to those other nations I've got that scripture to bring I'm just kind of hitting these side points right now did you know you can have the baptism the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost on your spirit you are Spirit man is that right you can have that genuine baptism on your spirit and go to hell because the soul is the thing that God sent his holy ghost to Quicken you say well you're judging me I'm not judging nobody if anything's judging you it's the word that's the truth and these things need to be talked about and preached on but there's a lot of scared preachers that don't want to preach it why because it'll cleanse and set you free when you can recognize what this spirit is today it's an antichrist anti-word Spirit that's so close to the real it could deceive if it was possible the elect right now I've got quote after quote let me just let me get to one here you'd want you don't want your garment unspotted so leave alone let me let me just read something I know I'm I know I'm going a little over time here but just bear with me just a minute if you were in my shoes you wouldn't well I won't say that it doesn't matter you're not in my shoes so there all right 97 paragraph 97 of this same of this message he said he said he's referring to the few who have not defiled their garments he said years ago we used to have a saying No Doubt was taken from this verse it was keep your skirts clean now I'm talking about unspotted here you don't have a form we do we want more than a form brother sister we've got to have the real thing not a form of godliness oh I go to church I believe the message I believe the prophet then why are you doing and dabbling in those things that's contrary to the word why are you doing it because you're not certain of where you stand you don't know all right now watch he said it was keep your skirts clean I mean it means don't get involved in questionable things hello questionable you have a pure word what do you need something else for nothing will deliver the soul or any Deliverance outside of this word I could say something real strong here but it would be too pinpointing I pray that you'll get the revelation stay away from questionable things others will be involved and might be tempted to be in to might be 10 you might be tempted to be involved now I'm leading up to something I want to read on the testimony here to close this service off so bear with me it's a true testimony of a sister I'm gonna read it it was sent to me by a minister a well-known minister in this message I requested it I heard him give it he said absolutely no problem he sent it to me and I'm intending it to stir stir you up I'm intending it for it to just put you under conviction if you're doing what I'm about to read and if you're dabbling around questionable things you better forget it because if you've got the Holy Ghost you know if there's a question you know what you ought to do about it leave it alone because everything we do is by faith and if it's not Faith it's sin and if it's not Faith it's off the word because Faith only one thing that pleases God and the just shall live by faith and only one thing that pleases God and that's faith true revelation of the word amen that's how Enoch went home in a rapture was by revelation all right now let's go right here he says now he said they he said God's going to reward those who follow this advice he said he said you might be tempted to be involved or someone may even try to involve you or you or you or here or anyone someone may be tempted to involve you into this questionable activity that has nothing to do with feeding your soul you need to be looking to the word if you want Deliverance not to some psychology of a man written in a book all right you say you offended me by saying that okay that's all right it's the truth now God is going to reward though he said you might even he said or someone might even try to involve you he said but stay clear of it all do you believe what that Prophet said he said stay clear of it all by setting a course away from it flee it get away from it don't you dabble in that thing it's removing you yourself away from the truth well but I had a spirit tell me whatever Spirit told you to do it is not of God he said why because it's off the word all right now God is going to reward those who follow this advice they are going to be clothed in white even as he is clothed in white he said his clothes were as white as light that is how the Saints are going to be clothed these their garments will be shining exceedingly white this sin is the message God is light and in him is no shadow you can't inject something else into this word you quit your dabbling and get where you need to be and start feeding on this open Word and things will start straightening up in your house and in your life and everything else and your children amen that's exactly right you are here to apply the token you say I walk with God then walk with him why are you trying to mix him with somebody else then start applying the token to your own life to what you read to what you hear to what you're teaching others to do that's off the word amen all right now I won't go any further with that okay he said no he said he said that the Believers have always been spoken against criticized watch what he said on a message 57 9 22 evening paragraph 349 and you people with these saw blade tempers that's always spouting off at the mouth of somebody can't put up and things like that be careful you're guilty if you speak a word against your brother that's not right not just go around and tear down you don't have us you don't have to stick a knife in a man's back to kill him you have you can break his character and kill him kill his influence speak against your pastor and say something bad about him you might as well have shot him amen told something that wasn't right about him be careful you're guilty said and you go off and spread something contrary and maybe him out of it just your imagination and you go on and influence somebody else against what's being ministered and put it on uh whatever books they call it Facebook or everything else and you talk about it to somebody else you are guilty you need to repent because that's the very thing that remove the names one of the very things that removed the name from The Book of Life amen I can prove that to you I'll go right back to what the prophet said what I'm saying it for now because I hope there's a space to repent and get right don't you do it if you've got something you feel it's not little not right with somebody you go to prayer your Prophet told you to go to prayer not scatter it to everybody else now go pick up the pieces you broke his character you broke his influence over the people and you spread it to this one into that one and everything else and here's the damage you see you see where we're standing today be careful what you're doing let's judge the spirit of what motivates you to do what you're doing all right I think it was laid out real good by brother Chris Sunday about the parents the children or Wednesday excuse me of the children the parents amen you can see what I'm talking about these names taken away brother Chris said I felt to go a little deeper to that but then the Lord checked me amen why it isn't anything about the preachers it's about God as a headship over his body and he knows how you need to hear it somebody else can preach the same message to another church and deal with different needs all right now there's a lot of things you just okay and I'm going to close off here now so don't get unspotted don't get a spotted garment don't think you got a form of godliness silly women Laden with diver's lust ever learning but never able to come to the true knowledge of the truth ever learning ever learning knowledge intellectual learning and Satan talking to him and say well you know this is this makes sense this is reasonable yeah and it takes you exactly the way you're going off of the word and taking now another Direction able okay all right 1206 1965. there's many people just can't believe it message even Spirit-filled people and watch what he said I'm going to give you one that'll choke you the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean you're going in not at all not on that don't have anything to do with your soul all right he said that's the baptism see that's the baptism brother Branham in in 1205 65 that was 1206 this is on uh the message I have uh no things that are to be I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that still has nothing to do with it that's only a temporal gift for you you've got to have it but that's temporal watch what the real gift is the real gift is your soul down in there that was born of God how is it born of God the seed would lay in there it was born of God and that controls the whole thing what does it control the whole thing too the word of God that inside will control you to the word of God so when you see something that's off the word Let It Go if you can't discern that then it's fruit you're bearing the wrong fruit it's not the word for the season that's your answer what's Satan trying to do take you down another Direction and you're going to come up short and you you think I've got I why I hear prophecy I prophesy yes you prophesy you can even prophesy truth it still doesn't make your soul right amen is that cast out Devils speak in tongues shout and dance and Hallelujah louder than any bride member could do and I'm not against any of that because the original is that but that's not the evidence God never said that was the evidence brother Branham in First Corinthians 12 never said that these things you could do having those gifts working in the body he said I wish I could say that was the evidence but I can't amen go back and see what he said the reason you don't know what he said because you're not reading what he said you're not hearing what he said you're not feeding your soul and asking God to reveal it to you you're too busy with other things you're too busy in yourself you're too busy caught up in your own program your too self-centered you haven't died to self you've got to die to self completely to resurrect in a new birth amen the gift the real gift is that soul that was born of God the whole controls the whole thing to the word of God and the will of God and there you grow up there you grow up and your son and daughter of God you're a child of God and these things you come up like a mother you're now in the bottles of the earth trying to come forth and he said you're a Son of God coming forth and you see the word says I should do this I should be born again well I belong to church that don't mean one thing see well my My Method my mother and father were well let's make it what it message believers that's good for your mother that's good for your father well I'm Pentecostal I belong that if you don't line with that word there's something wrong then you see your real father ain't God because the real start in your soul before it was even a spirit it was your soul the soul didn't come from God if it wasn't a germ of God to begin with or a gene of God a seed of God you're deceived you're in a patch of weeds bearing the world's record of the weeds coming forth acting like the world loving the world is because you love of the love of God is Not In You and you're dabbling with the world you're mixing the world with the word amen I hope that's straight I want it to be straight all right look here he says in leadership your spirit he said can be anointed I just I haven't read that yet remember in that Spirit you can be baptized with the genuine spirit of God and still be lost it's the soul that lives that was ordained of God okay I'm gonna I'm gonna break that off I want you to turn to be the first Corinthians I'm going to go into this testimony and I know I'm late you're just going to have to you'll have to just love me and if you believe God's in control you will because I believe he is I do too I do amen all right and God knows how bad I want to get to the rest of this but I will in due time God knew all about it all right now First Corinthians foreign I've got I've got Jude five to go into Jude Matthew 7. there's a lot of other scriptures First Corinthians 10 1. see you can all you've all come through the we've come through the we've come through receiving a prophet we come through the baptism we come we we shouted at the other side of the baptism we came down through the Wilderness but when we come to Moab foreign idolaters that say why we ought to all come together what's wrong with Fellowship anyway aren't we supposed to love them I'm sorry people we just someone keeps pulling okay let's go back here and find out page 220. 6 foreign so he planned away Balaam he formulated a plan that would force force Israel to force would force God to deal with Israel and death just as Satan knew he could single out even cause her to fall in fleshly sin thus God to pass judge pronounced sentence of death upon sin Balaam see he so his Doctrine the Bible said we didn't get into Jude yet but the doctrine of Balaam his teaching was false brother Branham in Matthew 24 24 why are they false prophets false teachers because their teaching is false not their anointing all right all right so he said so he planned a way to get them over and join in sin he went out he sent out invitations to come to the Feast of Baal peor which was an idolatrous Feast it was fornication it was an organized Church calling for the rest of them who were not organized just wanders so they said to see God from the top of the Rocks God said I see Israel I see him I see Christ I Behold Him to the people that dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the Nations Israel could not be reckoned among those Nations they were on their way out and Nations to us is denominations it's an idolatrous spirit that began right in Eden and went through Cain's wives and even Cain had to go to the land of not to get his wife and it was his own sister you tell me where that Spirit went into her to marry a man that was a seat of the serpent where did that come it came from her mother Eve even though Adam was her father what about Jacob and Esau both righteous parents where did that spiritual seed come from I'm talking about spiritually now where'd that spiritual seed come from and Esau where'd that spiritual seed come from in the LA I've went to the Land of Nod and brother Branham said Cain had to marry his own sister were those children of men come from that that tempted the sons of God which was Seth into a fornication Spirit which was brought out Wednesday said it's a marrying which is a giving of seed all right what is wrong so he planned to get them to come over and join in sin he sent out invitations they don't think that was reasonable looking well I word don't have anything why we just got Moses look how reasonable this man is look at this looks reasonable this looks well it looks like the way to go we're all supposed to be one aren't we not that kind of one we're supposed to be one if God's in you and God and Me It's that kind of one all right what is wrong with Fellowship anyway we are supposed to love them aren't we come on over and worship with us what is wrong with Fellowship anyway we're supposed to love the army or how can we win them pretty reasonable isn't it but God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief are you going to take his word or are you going to take God's word you can take the devil's word or God's word that's just not one place he said that was never forgiven Israel for what they did they went and flirted with that spirit it's Spirits brother sister I thought that was brought out very good Wednesday it was Spirits it's not people it's spirits those Spirits are at work right here in this congregation those Spirits are at work in every congregation we have three kinds of believers but I'm telling you brother brownham said this he said that Anna 97 things if I ever think because of the the the uh the because of the maturity of that church will not put up with that thing sin he said ought to be called out and it will be not because I intellectually decided it's in God's time in God's season and in God's way but he will expose it amen okay all right so he said well well we're being friendly never hurt anyone or so they thought prophet's words but when they but when those sexy moored by this woman and sexy spiritually because they're sexy because they're bringing through a word that they've already rejected the truth turned against it got up and walked out a dominating female spirit against the truth and yet we think we have to fellowship with them why they're so nice I wonder what was said what was scattered around with them I just said watch out what you say because you can you can kill a man's character and influence preachers influence and character by just you're spreading around those imaginations and those little ideas that you have that's contrary to the word it's better to this person the other person this person oh you know well you know I you know they said this the other day and this well I wouldn't believe that way you know okay begin to dance and undress Whirled around doing their rock and roll and twists and and and and lust rose up in the Israelites this is natural but brother Branham said the the natural fornication is the same as spiritual fornication he said it's the same spirit he said idolatry is fornication spiritual fornication idolatry is anything that comes between you and the word even questionable things okay I know you're getting tired and I'm quitting but I'm going to read this testimony First Corinthians is what I told you to turn to First Corinthians 11. okay and I want to read I want to read this quote at the back here you're gonna have to bear with me about five minutes I know I'm late but am I late is God ever late is I'm I'm if I'm trusting in Him am I late are you late you know what we're such in a world of time time time time time I don't have it right now and God comes along and says make you wait um gets me I don't like that preacher because he preaches so long really where are you going you stand out there in that foyer out there a half hour and talk you go out there to the rest of what you do all right I know I know that stings you go to a ball game you don't think of three hours or a basketball game or a football game this is feeding your soul and your flesh hates it is the problem nice well say what it is all right now let's go over to what he said here closing I even have it written down closing I'm far from it but all right 63 evening of 63 6 30 Evening of 63. paragraph 223 they cut their hair wear the worldly clothes walk out in the street like that and God's Bible warns against it even forbids a woman to even pray with bobbed hair and and says that a man she does that she claims herself to her husband that she's immoral she claims to herself if she cuts her hair listen I'm going to read it in just a minute I cuts her hair Bobs her hair she claims to her husband that she's immoral herself and he has a perfect right to give her a divorce and send her away from him that's exactly right the word of God saying that and a woman hear that and continue to wear short hair and then call herself a Christian and dress in clothes that are so tight that it shows everything about you why do you do it because there's a spirit of lust in there that causes you to do it he said bless God will never hear that preacher again do what you want to do they didn't want to hear Brother Brown them again either and you hear the same thing but when a preacher comes down and lives among you and starts bringing it oh he had no right to say that all right look it is that my motive to tear you down no to awaken you if God told you about it isn't he have to turn around and then forgive you with it when there's still Mercy if you know what's right let's not be iniquitous all right First Corinthians 11 1. this scripture is very seldom ever read again but I want you to know something in this first Corinthians I got second here first Corinthians 11. now I praise you brother and that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as I have delivered them to you what's an ordinance communion is an ordinance foot Washings and ordinance I've delivered these ordinances now you keep them as I've delivered them but I would have you to know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of every woman is who okay and the head of Christ is God every man praying or prophesying with his head covered dishonor his head well bless God I shouldn't wear a hat that's not talking about hats that's talking about uncut hair uncut hair okay A man should cut his hair you cut his hair it's not long hello women if you cut your hair even trim it you might as well shave it because it cuts your hair is defying headship you you said I'm not under the headship of my husband I defy his headship and you defy Christ to cut your hair it's no longer long I'm talking about just trim it that's the testimony I want to come to in a moment I'm leading up to this okay but every woman that prayeth or prophesied with her head uncovered dishonest her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven so uncover it means to cut it okay for a man indeed ought to cover no excuse me affordable woman be not covered let her be also her also be shorn see there it is if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered for a man indeed ought not to cover her his head for so much as he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the man amen for this cause ought to women to have power on her head because of the angels I want you to hold that tight that scripture it'll be in this testimony for as the women as the woman is of the man even so the man also by the woman but all things of God see for the woman is of the man it was she was she an Adam even as the man also then is by how'd you get here what the woman come out for she was a man with a womb she was to Bear another Adam but what she yield to see okay another seed adulterous she bowed she reverenced another word besides her husband's word God's word are you with me and when she did that it was idolatrous anything that comes between you and that word is an idolatrous spirit you need to wake up to that Paul said flee idolatry First Corinthians 10 last verse okay now let's get over here so nevertheless neither is a man without the woman see you can't have a man without being both masculine and feminist neither the woman without the man in the Lord so you see I hope you catch all that I don't have time to go into it for as the woman is of the man even so the man also by the woman judge in yourselves is it comely or seemingly comely I was going to mark that down what that meant but anyway is it comely or seemingly or or or right just that a woman pray to God uncovered unto God uncovered doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it's a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her now look at this it is a glory and to her for her hair is given to her for a covering so air is their covering and then you cut it you cut your glory all right now page 238 of the church age book page 238 Church age book paragraph seven that is why a woman cannot wear that which pertaineth to a man excuse me let me back up here just a minute the woman that is truly female all-female will want to be submissive to the mail that is commanded of her she will be of that disposition she will not be a doormat not a doormat no real male makes a female a doormat but she will want to be under Authority and not rule over the mail for he is the head of the house if she breaks then you are responsible if your wife's doing something that is not right you are going to answer for your home man listen to me you're going to answer for it that's why you better start applying the token you better talk the word and start applying it well I walk with God then apply the token that's him and the token must be on display and it has to be applied to be on display all right now for she is the head for for he is the head of the house if she breaks that image that God made for her she is perverted any male that lets the woman take authority has also broken the image and he is perverted that is why a woman cannot wear that which pertaineth to a man why she's entered into man's domain she's usurping Authority all right and and pertaineth to a man or cut her hair she is never to wear garments that pertain to a male or cut her hair when she does just pertain to it let alone pants just wear some that pertains all right and when a woman invades the pulpit which she's commanded she must not do she shows what Spirit she's of being a dominating female is Antichrist and the seeds of the Roman Catholic Church which are in her though she may deny this ever so vehemently when it comes to the word let God Be True in every man's word a lie who caused the fall a byproduct of the man she's guilty of the transgression that's why she's no longer equal to a man she's putting on a different position now the man will rule over her be careful that that denominational Spirit don't come sweeping on in and you just suddenly say I don't believe and don't care about what my husband said I'll do what I want to do okay all right now page 394 lady Lucian church that was in that was in the thyatiron church age we could say a lot about that page 394 of the ladocian church age now I know you ladies don't like the kind of preaching this kind of preaching he said but sister you're dead wrong in what you're doing the Bible forbid you to cut your hair God gave it for recovering he gave a command to you to wear it long it is your glory when you cut your cut cut your hair you signify that you've left the headship of your husband like Eve you walked out and went on your own you need to repent and come back to God okay I want to read this to you it's quite striking and I hope it stirs all it stirred me I want to I want to get this to you here this testimony was given on 329 of 18. I won't give the sister's name I can give it to you personally if you'd like but I don't think it's necessary to give her name but it is a true testimony and it's called the importance of long hair it was early in 2007 when I became very tempted to cut my hair although I knew it was wrong and that I've been taught that long hair in the Bible means uncut hair at that time in my life I was struggling with a few worldly things and several sisters I knew had begun to trim their hair and I heard every excuse as to why it was okay so I eventually decided I would trim my hair but when I went to do it I felt so convicted thank God that I decided I would first ask God to clearly show me if I should cut it at all and if he didn't answer me I would cut my hair the following week look what she did know she went to God okay now God's not going to tell you to do something you're prophet and the word said no new okay I think it was two days later I had a dream where a man was chasing me with a knife and had me cornered and tried to stab me but was unable to touch me with it though he was stabbing wildly towards me then a voice said to me he can't touch you because you have uncut hair the next night I had another dream I saw myself holding scissors about to cut my hair and all her and all around and all around Angels were crying and pleading for me not to cut it saying they only have authority to protect me if my hair is uncut I want you to remember that scripture in verse 10. I told you to remember I suddenly realized though I can't write it in the words in Words what it would mean in the Unseen spiritual world if I cut my hair and I started screaming at myself don't cut it please don't cut it and needless to say I didn't cut it about three to four weeks after this it was a strangely quiet afternoon at work I work in our family business the knife shop selling knives at about 4 pm there wasn't a person in sight when a drunk crazed man staggered in swelling swearing and shouting that he was going to stab me and kill me he was very worked up and angry and used extreme foul language I looked at him and suddenly realized that this was the same man who had unsuccessfully tried to stab me in my dream and I felt such a peace and just looked straight at him knowing he could do absolutely nothing to hurt me he suddenly went all nervous and ran out a few seconds later he walked back in and said sorry about that lady and then left it's just the grace of God to have prevented me from cutting off my god-given protection when I was already determined to cut my hair praise the Lord a couple of years after this I was walking home from work the route I took was one I had walked many times before and the majority of it was along busy roads and out in the open but there are a few secluded sections at one of these sections I came across a man standing in the middle of of path her path with a dog which I had to walk past as soon as I got right by them three other men jumped out from behind the bushes and I was surrounded at first I was really terrified because I knew they planned this attack on someone and it just happened to be me but then I felt a power on my head and I realized that they couldn't harm me at all because I have uncut hair and all fear left me I pushed the dog out of the way and continued walking on and they just stared at me as if they couldn't really move as soon as I got out of their sight I ran all the way home rejoicing and praising the Lord First Corinthians 11 10 for this cause the woman for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the Angels let's Stand Together all it takes it takes brother sister you say why'd you read that Brother David well number one is because the holy spirit said to read it and number two just takes one word is all it takes disobeyed you can even give in your heart the Lord been baptized all come through it Sanctified but all it takes is one word of Disobedience I don't believe it and walk away from it what happens I pray this won't happen but they fall away and the Bible says in Hebrews 6 never to come to repentance again be careful we're not playing with the church let's take this to Heart if there's a sister here or even a husband that will allow his wife to do it you're guilty too but now because the word has come to you you have the you have a chance by grace to repent God would have never told you you're wrong if he didn't know and he'd give you a space to repent leave your hair alone he said well the dirt the dryer you can take every reason you want to take but don't you put a scissors to your hair again you keep off of trimming those ends uncut hair is the same as having it off and shaven it's not long so it's not length that determines what long hair is it's uncut because there's our brother David knows in the mission field there's a lot of women that can't grow their hair hardly over that or that or whatever but they don't cut it you know what that God God's eyes she's covered and the angels are here to protect those that stay with the word are you with me you go out of the grasp of the word of God and you're in trouble there's a lot of things we could have said and I apologize I'd sincerely do for taking so long that I can't say apologize for what's been said hey man we're gonna go home we have a whole week to recuperate come back Wednesday I'll try to go as far as I can Wednesday not as long as this obviously it's a Wednesday through God help us Sundays you have a more Liberty [Music] amen [Music] you say well it's tiring In the Flesh Brother David which is your head the flesh or the word which is my head you think you're tired you ought to see me after I preach inspired preaching is worth eight hours of hard labor with the jackhammers that right brother David and here I preached two over [Music] oh really you know the time sure I do and it bothers me but I know I can't stop until he stops it that's one thing I've committed to God let's borrow heads our heavenly father I don't know but you know this may be the last time I see some of these people we don't know what's going to happen as soon as we leave this place but let us carry out the trueness of the word if there's things that you put your finger on there's much that could be said Lord many many other things and if it be pleasing to you and your will let me come back and let it be open some more and if I can't open it finish it Wednesday May there be another opportunity Lord I just feel very strongly and that's between you and I that this has to be gotten out father that you know my heart and now I just expect you to come back and fulfill what you purpose your word will never return to you boy I commit every individual to you every person what they thought what they think someday will be opened once again what I've said I've got to meet at the day of judgment not to be judged by it but to give answer to it Lord Jesus I realize that I'm very aware of it and oh God how I labor how it scares me to death to think I've got to stand before this same group and every person in their generation giving a true witness of the word giving a true testimony will have to stand with their group at that day and give an answer for what they've talked who they talked to and give witness yes Lord I did say that yes that was me [Music] now Lord Jesus letter let our mortys let our objectives let our attitudes let our thoughts be pure and right and if there's anything outside of that and they've convicted our hearts and let us get right with God right now and confess it and turn away from it change course confess it and forsake it
