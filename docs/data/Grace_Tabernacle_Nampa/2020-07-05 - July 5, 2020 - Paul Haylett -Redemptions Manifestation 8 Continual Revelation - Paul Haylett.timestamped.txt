[44:35] wasn't looking at me
[44:39] when it appears
[44:43] he wasn't looking at my heart
[44:48] I will
[44:51] I said
[44:53] he was against the blood
[44:57] [Music]
[45:02] fresh blood
[45:10] it was looking at me

[45:47] amen aren't you glad that blood covers
[45:49] you today hallelujah we kind of forgot
[45:52] to mention our brother Isaac Nash he's

[45:58] they put over the incisions and stuff
[46:00] and it's starting to come off and the
[46:02] doctor told him he'll be as miserable as
[46:05] he's ever been as that happened so we
[46:08] just we want to remember him in prayer
[46:09] my brother Trevor's we said it's not
[46:12] feeling too well today they called me
[46:14] first thing this morning kind of a
[46:15] little apologetic that they hope that
[46:17] whatever brother Trevor's not feeling
[46:19] good from didn't get passed to anyone
[46:22] else but you know it's interesting as we
[46:25] arrived yesterday to the fellowship I
[46:29] just felt led of the Lord before we even
[46:32] got out of the car I just stopped and I
[46:34] bound every virus every spirit
[46:37] everything that could just hinder the
[46:40] body of Christ and you know I believe
[46:42] that with all of my heart Saints these
[46:43] are not just words I believe God's
[46:45] granted us the authority amen to stand
[46:48] upon the word to loose the word in our
[46:50] lives to bind anything contrary to the
[46:53] word amen
[46:54] so definitely remember brother Trevor
[46:57] sister Kari brother Mason today and so
[47:00] I'm gonna do something that brother
[47:02] Jason forgot to do

[47:17] remember brother Jake when I first met
[47:19] you what you are 17 you don't have to

[48:52] Venessa not feeling well okay well I saw
[48:55] her kissing the dog yesterday so amen
[49:00] well let's remember the whole family
[49:02] then in prayer today amen but we need to
[49:06] remember and sister that the fresh
[49:09] revelation was not a one-time revelation
[49:11] God didn't just stir your heart one time
[49:13] that it was fresh only once no he said
[49:17] I'll be with you even in you amen and we
[49:20] need to remember that God does not have
[49:22] a long-distance relationships Amen now
[49:26] we can be anywhere on the earth but God
[49:28] Himself does not deal in long-distance
[49:31] relationships Amen God's not looking for
[49:35] us to just wander off somewhere he wants
[49:38] you to be up close and present amen
[49:40] or he's your ever-present help in the
[49:42] time of trouble amen
[49:44] let's just stand his will turn in our
[49:46] Bibles this morning to Genesis the
[49:48] fourth chapter and we'll we'll take our
[49:51] fought out of the Word of God amen
[49:56] Genesis 4:1 and Eve knew his wife I mean
[50:01] an Adam knew his wife start over and
[50:05] Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived
[50:09] let me you know it's terrible
[50:11] where I hate to just be this way there
[50:13] have to take him off and get really
[50:15] closer I have to get back and out of
[50:17] knew Eve his wife and she conceived in
[50:20] bare Cain and said I have gotten a man
[50:22] from the Lord and she again bare his
[50:26] brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of
[50:29] sheep but Cain was a tiller of the
[50:31] ground and in process of time it came to
[50:34] pass that Cain brought of the fruit of
[50:36] the ground an offering unto the Lord
[50:39] now we'll touch on if we get to it I
[50:42] have a lot on the platter today if we
[50:44] get to it will kind of tie this into
[50:46] this offering portion also and Cain
[50:49] brought of the fruit of the ground an
[50:51] offering unto the Lord and Abel he also
[50:54] brought of the firstlings of his flock
[50:56] and of the fat thereof and the Lord had
[50:59] respect unto Abel and to his offering
[51:02] but unto Cain and his offering he had
[51:06] not respect and Cain was very wroth and
[51:10] his countenance fell and the Lord said
[51:13] unto Cain why art thou wroth and why is
[51:16] thy countenance fallen and if thou doest
[51:19] well shalt thou not be accepted and if
[51:23] thou doest not well sin lieth at the
[51:25] door and unto these shall be his desire
[51:28] and thou shalt rule over him and Cain
[51:31] talked with Abel his brother and it into
[51:35] pass when they were in the field that
[51:37] Cain rose up against Abel his brother
[51:39] and slew him now we oftentimes don't
[51:43] look at this scripture this way but I
[51:45] just want to make this comment before we
[51:47] move on and Cain talked with Abel his
[51:51] brother you know what they were talking
[51:53] about Saints doctrine they were talking
[52:02] about what was right what was wrong what
[52:08] was rooted in the Word of God
[52:09] now they had brother Branham says no
[52:11] Bible but we'll touch on that in a few
[52:15] minutes
[52:16] Heavenly Father Lord we ask you Lord to
[52:19] come today father we have those that are
[52:21] sick in our midst
[52:22] Lord just ask you to go to each and
[52:24] every hole
[52:25] Father and touch each one Lord those
[52:28] that father recovering from surgery our
[52:30] brother Isaac to those who might not be
[52:32] feeling well father just ask you Lord
[52:35] just to move in our mitts for Lord we
[52:38] are already healed it's a past tense by
[52:41] your stripes father so Lord we're just
[52:43] claiming what's already been given to us
[52:45] rightly so and Lord asking it to come to
[52:49] pass today Oh Lord as we open the word
[52:51] let us only speak according to thy word
[52:53] father for thy pleasure in the name of
[52:56] Jesus Christ amen you may be seated you
[53:07] see Satan has from the very beginning my
[53:10] brother and sister tried to dispute the
[53:12] Word of God he's tried to dispute what
[53:15] God would give to his people amen so
[53:18] there is that you can study that if you
[53:21] go in and dispute disputer you'll find
[53:25] the context and how that it comes all
[53:27] through the scripture and that Satan is
[53:30] constantly there trying to refute in a
[53:33] very subtly everything that God is doing
[53:37] now we go on here and I want to just lay
[53:39] this a little foundation because we're
[53:41] going to take our thought from the
[53:43] position where Abel come from the
[53:46] prophet of God says you want to know
[53:48] about something you go back to the
[53:51] beginning or the origin amen
[53:53] Hebrews 11 and one says now faith is the
[53:55] substance of things hoped for the
[53:58] evidence of things not seen
[53:59] for by it the elders obtained a good
[54:01] report through faith we understand that
[54:04] the worlds were framed by the Word of
[54:06] God so that things which are seen were
[54:09] not made of things which do appear by
[54:12] faith Abel offered unto God a more
[54:14] excellent sacrifice than Cain by which
[54:17] he obtained witness that he was
[54:19] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[54:21] and by it he being dead yet speaketh
[54:26] amen
[54:27] you know I was just reading some
[54:29] commentary by a very intellectual
[54:32] theologian has written many works of is
[54:35] considered by many to be an authority on
[54:38] things of
[54:38] Bible and talking about going back to
[54:41] the originals and and these kind of
[54:43] things very like I said very
[54:46] intellectual and you know in one of his
[54:48] writings he makes a statement that we
[54:50] have misunderstood the teachings of the
[54:53] Apostle Paul that it is not by we being
[54:57] sinners saved by grace it is not by his
[55:00] his merit not our merit but he says you
[55:04] know that that you have to have all
[55:06] works and much of what Paul was speaking
[55:08] was drawn out of other context and not
[55:12] necessarily represented correctly and
[55:14] you know it's interesting because there
[55:16] was a lot of comments upon this writing
[55:19] and I thought you know isn't that the
[55:21] world we live in today
[55:22] I thought brother Pavel's special sister
[55:25] Gerry's special both spoke to me in the
[55:28] fashion because you see my brother and
[55:29] sister without God opening our eyes men
[55:32] intellectually look at the Word of God
[55:34] and they come to intellectual
[55:36] conceptions or intellectual conclusions
[55:40] and you know to realize that by an
[55:43] intellectual conclusion all you can do
[55:46] is take what was spoken here and what
[55:48] was spoken here and logically put them
[55:51] together but we understand by the Word
[55:54] of God that revelation is how God has
[55:57] chose to work God has come in our
[56:00] generations we can look back all through
[56:02] the Bible all through the ages and we
[56:04] can look at that and we can see with the
[56:06] with the side note of of time past right
[56:09] looking back that we can see those
[56:11] things coming to pass but look at the
[56:13] day that we're living in Amen God still
[56:15] working God still present his word is
[56:18] still unfolding amen
[56:20] just as they have discovered that the
[56:22] galaxy is still unfolding amen that we
[56:26] look at the word today and know that the
[56:28] word is still unfolding amen
[56:30] it did not come to a place that God put
[56:33] a period on the end of it
[56:34] but God said I'm gonna let it be
[56:36] manifest in this day that we're living
[56:38] in through sons and daughters of God
[56:41] they will be that a living epistle
[56:44] that's going to be read of all men now
[56:46] God could have just as easily chosen to
[56:49] come back in a flash as he did in Jesus
[56:52] Christ in that flesh he could have come
[56:54] back and revealed himself in this last
[56:56] day but God had such confidence my
[56:58] brother and sister-in you and I that he
[57:01] said I'll just come and dwell in them
[57:03] and let them shine my gospel to the
[57:05] world now if you don't believe that is a
[57:07] great degree of confidence my brother
[57:09] and sister then you are mistaken because
[57:12] God is entrusted the very representation
[57:15] of who he is to you and I Amen I think
[57:19] that's pretty special myself amen to see
[57:21] how that God would come and in that
[57:24] fashion would make himself known to the
[57:27] world in human flesh amen Oh as we look
[57:31] at this I got a lot like I said here and
[57:34] I'll just try and hurry along
[57:35] amen he said wait now brother branham I
[57:38] want you to take these if you have time
[57:40] feel led to go back and get the whole
[57:42] context of what he's saying here because
[57:45] obviously we can't take the whole sermon
[57:47] that he preached and draw it out but
[57:49] brother brown says here in the sermon
[57:50] the rapture he's talking with a
[57:52] gentleman amen and this man has a
[57:55] certain idea about the Gospels and
[57:57] brother Browns in a conversation with
[57:59] him and he said we'll never be able
[58:01] brother branham to get the things
[58:02] together till we get every word upon
[58:06] word upon word exactly with the Greek
[58:08] and so forth amen brother Favell I
[58:10] enjoyed that right because you see God's
[58:13] gonna hide it my brother and sister he's
[58:15] gonna choose those who are willing to
[58:17] say Lord show it to me I have no idea
[58:20] revealed your word to me lord I need
[58:22] revelation of that he's going to open it
[58:25] to them hide it to that intellectual man
[58:27] amen and so this man is telling brother
[58:29] Branham we won't know until we get every
[58:32] word upon word upon word exactly with
[58:34] the Greek and so forth nowhere in the
[58:36] Bible my brother does that say if you
[58:37] know the Greek that you got the faith of
[58:39] God amen he said Oh sir you know III
[58:43] said Oh sir you know better than that I
[58:45] said even then I see a council way back
[58:48] as far at 300 years from the death of
[58:50] Christ they were still debating which
[58:53] Greek scholar was right you can know
[58:55] it's a revelation the whole thing
[58:57] he said I cannot accept revelation now
[59:01] my brother and sister this sounds kind
[59:03] of strange but we have
[59:05] people who are standing on the earth
[59:07] today that when the Prophet left the
[59:10] scene they have no further desire to
[59:13] know anything more than they can find on
[59:16] the written page but the Prophet never
[59:19] taught that the bible does not teach
[59:22] that amen so we see here they're saying
[59:25] I cannot accept revelation I said then
[59:28] how can you accept Christ he said why
[59:30] the Bible said he that believeth on
[59:32] Jesus Christ has everlasting life and I
[59:35] said that is true it also says no man
[59:37] can call Jesus a Christ only by the
[59:40] revelation of the Holy Ghost that's
[59:42] revealed it to him so we have this
[59:45] paradox that people say well if I say
[59:47] Jesus is the Christ I've witnessed to
[59:49] these people and they say well I believe
[59:51] Jesus is the Christ I'm saved but my
[59:54] brother and sister that is just an
[59:56] outward anyone in infidel could repeat
[59:59] those words so there has to be something
[1:00:02] more that is there and my brother
[1:00:04] branham come here and he says you know
[1:00:06] it says no man can call Jesus the Christ
[1:00:09] only by revelation of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:11] that's the Word of God amen see there
[1:00:13] you are right back around again falls
[1:00:15] right back to the revelation it's got to
[1:00:19] be revealed in the Bible amen
[1:00:23] Cain and Abel didn't have a Bible to
[1:00:25] read but it was revealed to Abel by
[1:00:27] faith oh look at this now I want you to
[1:00:30] catch this it was revealed to Abel by
[1:00:33] faith which is revelation is a
[1:00:38] revelation you see faith my brother and
[1:00:41] sister is a revelation people say well
[1:00:44] you know I've never in my life I I
[1:00:46] believe the message I've listened to the
[1:00:48] preaching ideas and I don't know that
[1:00:50] I've ever really had a revelation you
[1:00:52] had faith to believe the Word of God
[1:00:55] that was a revelation come down upon you
[1:00:58] amen otherwise we would then be good
[1:01:00] Methodists or Baptists or whatever it
[1:01:02] might have been that is in your lineage
[1:01:04] amen
[1:01:06] Abel offered unto God a more excellent
[1:01:08] sacrifice than that of Canaan which God
[1:01:12] testified that he was righteous amen so
[1:01:16] as we look at this my brother and sister
[1:01:18] we real
[1:01:18] lives and I just encourage you to read
[1:01:21] your Bible read the message and
[1:01:23] understand that this of faith that God
[1:01:27] has put in you is a revelation you say
[1:01:29] well okay I just read I just picked up a
[1:01:32] message book I know many a individual
[1:01:34] that their their testimony theirs down
[1:01:37] in Chile testimony about how a young man
[1:01:40] and his wife were living and and in
[1:01:43] Chile they oftentimes a share like a lot
[1:01:46] of the Latin American countries their
[1:01:48] trash is actually on a pole out on the
[1:01:51] street and it's up in these baskets up
[1:01:53] high so the dogs and whatever won't get
[1:01:55] in and tear up the trash and oftentimes
[1:01:57] people share and it's a culture now not
[1:02:00] so much
[1:02:01] you guys mostly would be a little
[1:02:02] weirded out if you looked out on trash
[1:02:04] day and brother Paul was out in your
[1:02:06] little trash can or a little dumpster
[1:02:08] digging through your trash you'd be like
[1:02:10] whoa what are you doing going through my
[1:02:12] trap
[1:02:13] but you see their culture is such that
[1:02:15] one's man trash is another man's
[1:02:16] treasure and so oftentimes you will find
[1:02:19] right in reasonably nice neighborhoods
[1:02:22] people going through someone else's
[1:02:24] trash because there might be something
[1:02:26] in there that they could use and so this
[1:02:29] is not an uncommon thing and so here it
[1:02:32] was with this this young man raised in a
[1:02:34] messege household went off into the
[1:02:36] world got married he's just living his
[1:02:39] wife and his mother had such a burden
[1:02:41] for him that she was constantly sending
[1:02:43] him message books and he would look at
[1:02:46] them and he would just go home I you
[1:02:48] know and throw him in the trash and the
[1:02:50] neighbor lady would haul her trash out
[1:02:52] and just according to the culture would
[1:02:54] dig through the trash amen and she was
[1:02:58] finding these books and she's like now
[1:03:00] why would he be throwing something away
[1:03:02] that could be read or something of this
[1:03:04] nature and the lady takes it home and
[1:03:07] she starts reading this message books
[1:03:09] now you tell me God is non-sovereign
[1:03:10] amen and so she's reading this message
[1:03:13] books and something starts stirring
[1:03:15] inside of her heart and she starts
[1:03:18] sharing him with her husband and with
[1:03:20] her children and they come one day and
[1:03:22] are just like Oh hallelujah she meets
[1:03:24] him one day in the driveway and says
[1:03:26] where did you get these she said oh my
[1:03:28] mom and dad send them to me but I don't
[1:03:31] believe
[1:03:31] and she says how can you not believe
[1:03:35] this and he felt so convicted in his
[1:03:38] heart and he went away from there
[1:03:40] and it was many months later but it was
[1:03:42] there deep in his heart how can I not
[1:03:44] believe that something kept telling him
[1:03:46] this is the truth this is the truth this
[1:03:49] is the truth and he come one day and he
[1:03:52] is talking to his neighbor and he says
[1:03:54] well you know I was raised up in a very
[1:03:56] strict this and a very strict bat and
[1:03:58] the woman says don't tell me about
[1:03:59] strictness I'm a Catholic well I'll have
[1:04:11] to find another excuse I was raised in a
[1:04:17] messege house and my parents were so
[1:04:19] strict and they were so this and we
[1:04:21] couldn't do this and we couldn't drink
[1:04:23] and we couldn't smoke and we couldn't
[1:04:25] dance and we couldn't look my brother
[1:04:28] and sister half of the population on
[1:04:29] earth Christian or not doesn't do those
[1:04:31] things right where's your excuse hmm God
[1:04:37] will tear down our excuse my brother and
[1:04:39] sister and he'll replace it two sons and
[1:04:42] daughters of God with revelation anyway
[1:04:45] so now get this now the trash that she's
[1:04:48] digging in brings the word to her and
[1:04:50] then she has such a burden for a young
[1:04:53] man who won't take what he was raised in
[1:04:56] and she is now certain it's the truth
[1:04:58] and she starts going to his house now
[1:05:00] you got to understand neighborhoods like
[1:05:02] that many times the neighbors can be
[1:05:03] almost like family and she starts going
[1:05:05] and she just starts telling this guy's
[1:05:07] wife you know that if you don't follow
[1:05:10] the Bible that you'll be lost
[1:05:13] and the young lady had just enough
[1:05:15] religion she's like yeah we know we
[1:05:17] should just as well my Bible says that
[1:05:19] are you dressing like you're dressing is
[1:05:22] the wrong spirit my Bible says that you
[1:05:25] cutting your hair is the wrong spirit my
[1:05:27] Bible says and my brother and sister
[1:05:30] this woman was relentless until one day
[1:05:32] the young man said fine fine fine please
[1:05:35] stop please stop now you've got my wife
[1:05:38] believing this
[1:05:42] now imagine not to sound crass but
[1:05:45] imagine now you sleep in the bed with a
[1:05:47] person who's witnessing to you it don't
[1:05:52] get any closer than that God let it be
[1:05:55] that powerful if we need moved Lord let
[1:05:58] the one that sleeps beside us at night
[1:06:00] be witnessing to us maybe not in words
[1:06:03] but maybe in deed
[1:06:05] amen because you see when God wants to
[1:06:08] get all the overburden you know when
[1:06:10] they go mining they dig the overburden
[1:06:12] off right and many of us have a lot of
[1:06:14] overburden and God will keep sweeping
[1:06:16] away that overburden until he can get
[1:06:19] down to the place that he shows you
[1:06:21] really what it's all about in the
[1:06:24] beginning amen and so here it is Abel
[1:06:27] offered unto God a more excellent
[1:06:28] sacrifice than that of Cain did he have
[1:06:31] an intellectual understanding no my
[1:06:33] brother and sister he didn't have an
[1:06:35] encyclopedia he didn't have some kind of
[1:06:37] reference book but he had revelation and
[1:06:40] revelation ultimately must come and stir
[1:06:44] the heart of who it was sent to and it
[1:06:46] will bring forth the birthing of the
[1:06:48] word amen and so Cain come now imagine
[1:06:52] this as we look at this story the Cain
[1:06:53] is there now talking I mean to Abel a
[1:06:57] men boy I'm just rattled and going 90
[1:07:01] miles an hour this morning pray for me
[1:07:03] Abel no doubt now having conversation
[1:07:06] with Cain and telling him look brother I
[1:07:09] don't know why I believe it has to be
[1:07:11] the blood I don't know why I do this and
[1:07:14] Cain says well this is what I see look
[1:07:17] looks like a modern day that we live in
[1:07:18] this is what I think it is and Abel's
[1:07:21] over here saying this is what I think it
[1:07:23] is and there had to be something my
[1:07:25] brother and sister that convicted Cain's
[1:07:27] heart to the point that he would rise up
[1:07:30] and slay his own brother and anointing
[1:07:32] right there what was it he was anointed
[1:07:34] to reject the word Amen and he would
[1:07:37] persecute anything that believed the
[1:07:39] word Amen so as we looked at this this
[1:07:42] morning my brother and sister God
[1:07:43] doesn't come just open his word once and
[1:07:45] went on he didn't say just let there be
[1:07:47] light my brother and sister the
[1:07:49] manifestation of light became the
[1:07:51] testimony of him saying let there
[1:07:53] like amen so there has to be a
[1:07:55] manifestation amen so as we look at this
[1:07:59] we recognize I just jumping over to the
[1:08:01] Apostle Paul for a moment amen now look
[1:08:04] at the Apostle Paul we know his life
[1:08:06] very educated man amen and he was a very
[1:08:09] zealous man oh my that we could be as
[1:08:11] zealous as soul was amen and God takes
[1:08:15] him now and takes Paul to the backside
[1:08:17] of the desert and there was two things
[1:08:19] that happened there in the backside of
[1:08:21] the desert one he had a complete death
[1:08:24] to self and he received revelation from
[1:08:30] God there's actually a deeper
[1:08:32] correlation there than many times we
[1:08:34] give that credit and when the Apostle
[1:08:36] Paul went to the backside of the desert
[1:08:37] mother brother and sister if he went out
[1:08:39] there and said well the Sanhedrin says
[1:08:41] or these say or they say he would have
[1:08:44] come out of the desert with the same
[1:08:45] revelation he went into the desert with
[1:08:47] but the Apostle Paul went out into the
[1:08:49] backside of the desert God met him there
[1:08:52] he had a complete death unto himself and
[1:08:54] in that as a new creature he was able to
[1:08:58] receive revelation from God in other
[1:09:00] words the vessel had been empty out
[1:09:02] completely now it was not a vessel to
[1:09:04] honor that was converted dishonor that
[1:09:06] was converted to a vessel of Honor he
[1:09:08] always was a vessel of Honor my brother
[1:09:10] and sister but God just showed him what
[1:09:13] his calling was so as he comes out of
[1:09:15] the backside of the desert he has a
[1:09:17] revelation amen
[1:09:19] that he can see and God anoints him to
[1:09:21] preach and to write and he has written
[1:09:24] Rutten Rutten a great portion of the
[1:09:28] Bible by revelation see he didn't even
[1:09:32] have anything to go back and reference
[1:09:33] to himself he didn't have any cross
[1:09:36] reference he didn't have any he wrote by
[1:09:38] revelation now the world thinks that
[1:09:40] Paul may be kind of just you know went
[1:09:42] off on a whim and wrote this and then
[1:09:45] we've just as a Christian Church
[1:09:46] accepted this but my brother and sister
[1:09:48] we come down to the simple point we
[1:09:50] either believe that the Word of God is
[1:09:52] infallible or we don't and if we don't
[1:09:55] believe it's infallible then what are we
[1:09:57] doing here
[1:09:59] so as we look at this and realize that
[1:10:02] the scripture declares that these things
[1:10:05] were not of men but was of God and so
[1:10:08] that's where we stand on the word of God
[1:10:10] today amen
[1:10:12] now you know I'm going to touch on this
[1:10:13] and I hope it's not touchy to you and
[1:10:15] some people it might be but my brother
[1:10:17] and sister I have had conversations
[1:10:19] where people have looked me in the face
[1:10:21] and said all new revelation ended when
[1:10:24] the prophet left the scene oh my brother
[1:10:27] and sister I'll tell you I don't agree
[1:10:29] with that at all because you see the
[1:10:31] prophet of God come he opened the word
[1:10:34] he restored his back to it made it a new
[1:10:36] book amen just thinking not trying to go
[1:10:39] off in this vein but the prophet of God
[1:10:41] showed us how we had to clean the
[1:10:42] channel out now if the channel being
[1:10:45] cleaned out was just for the Prophet
[1:10:47] then he wouldn't have needed to have
[1:10:48] taught us that we needed to get the
[1:10:50] channel cleaned out we were just said
[1:10:52] well pray for the Prophet pray for
[1:10:54] brother Blanton Branham that the channel
[1:10:56] would be cleaned out for him so he could
[1:10:58] bring us the word but the prophet of God
[1:11:00] go back through the message amen
[1:11:01] he said you got to get that channel you
[1:11:03] got to get all them sticks and leaves
[1:11:05] and all that garbage out of that channel
[1:11:07] you've got to get it cleared out and
[1:11:09] clearly shows us as that channel is
[1:11:11] between you and God amen so when we get
[1:11:15] that channel cleared out is that just so
[1:11:17] God can drop a tidbit here and there to
[1:11:19] us make us feel good no my brother and
[1:11:21] sister them that was so we could come
[1:11:23] and we have a direct intercession with
[1:11:26] the throne of Almighty God and God would
[1:11:28] deal directly with you and I Amen how
[1:11:31] often is it my brother and sister just
[1:11:33] to reiterate things we've spoke on how
[1:11:36] often is it that you come to church and
[1:11:38] you say wow the pastor spoke on the very
[1:11:41] situation that we are facing or dealing
[1:11:44] with in our life now my brother and
[1:11:46] sister you got one really smart pastor
[1:11:47] don't you know you've got a clear
[1:11:51] channel to the throne of God and God is
[1:11:55] then sending confirmation to you I heard
[1:11:57] your prayer and I have given the word to
[1:12:00] you and we stand upon that knowing that
[1:12:02] God is mindful of the needs of his sons
[1:12:05] and daughters amen now you look at this
[1:12:08] my brother and sister so revelation did
[1:12:11] not leave us in fact for
[1:12:12] a restored Church revelation was just
[1:12:16] opened up
[1:12:16] it was then just brought to awareness to
[1:12:19] you and I that we would be able to come
[1:12:22] and God Himself would come down and
[1:12:24] speak to our need revelation won't stop
[1:12:27] my brother's sister because this is
[1:12:29] God's Way of revealing himself in his
[1:12:33] bride see not on the page not on a book
[1:12:37] on a shelf somewhere not in some kind of
[1:12:39] archaeological thing but God Himself
[1:12:42] revealing himself in his bride day by
[1:12:46] day if we accept anything less than that
[1:12:51] then you might as well just go wrap
[1:12:52] yourself up and become a mummy well
[1:12:57] excuse me
[1:12:59] see how personal this is you can just
[1:13:03] look at a bride and see what kind of
[1:13:04] relationship she has with her husband I
[1:13:08] remember one time a sister looked me in
[1:13:11] the face and said you know what I and my
[1:13:13] husband are not one I have a brain I
[1:13:17] don't need him to do my thinking for me
[1:13:25] out I hope her husband never finds out
[1:13:29] she feels that way because he's gonna be
[1:13:31] one disheartened man my brother and
[1:13:35] sister you see the very nature that is
[1:13:37] there as you look see you can look at
[1:13:40] the church and see what kind of
[1:13:41] relationship she has with her husband
[1:13:43] and oftentimes you'll find that those
[1:13:46] two go hand in hand when you have a
[1:13:48] church that does not have a close
[1:13:49] relationship with the Lord you will find
[1:13:51] people in that church without a close
[1:13:53] relationship with the Lord now some of
[1:13:55] you required this morning and I hope
[1:13:57] that it's not because you're bored but I
[1:13:59] hope maybe something Stern or hard to
[1:14:01] realize the prophet of God said the
[1:14:03] natural and the spiritual are parallel
[1:14:05] amen you cannot be cold on God and have
[1:14:09] the kind of relationship you should with
[1:14:12] a spouse amen and that goes both ways
[1:14:14] amen it's not just our sisters right and
[1:14:16] in the church is just a type or the
[1:14:18] bride is just to type amen but you look
[1:14:20] at that
[1:14:21] I tell you sister Geri and I have these
[1:14:23] kind of conversations you know we are
[1:14:26] she is feisty amen she lets me know how
[1:14:29] she feels about things but my brother
[1:14:32] and sister you see we've never gave up
[1:14:33] on working on being one there's a few
[1:14:37] things we don't agree on hey men well
[1:14:38] anyway ah hey we won't go there
[1:14:45] amen we don't have enough time whew can
[1:14:48] be pretty broad amen
[1:14:50] no I'm just using this for a type Saints
[1:14:52] I know you realize this there's things
[1:14:54] that we disagree on and there's times we
[1:14:56] fuss with one another but the thing that
[1:14:58] we always have in common is
[1:15:00] reconciliation amen we always come back
[1:15:04] knowing that I am NOT complete without
[1:15:06] her she's not complete without me
[1:15:08] amen and we want to be complete amen and
[1:15:11] so we as the Bride of Christ are not
[1:15:14] complete without a full blown on fire
[1:15:17] relationship with God a half-hearted
[1:15:20] long-distance relationship will not work
[1:15:23] my brother and sister don't fool
[1:15:25] yourself and say well I pray I read my
[1:15:27] Bible well remember my brothers sister
[1:15:29] you can pray and read your Bible but
[1:15:31] unless you submit yourself to that it
[1:15:34] will not do one thing for you it's in
[1:15:38] the submission to the word that we find
[1:15:41] deliverance amen so people say well we
[1:15:44] belong to this church we believe the
[1:15:45] message we this we that that's good are
[1:15:48] you obedient to it have you died to
[1:15:50] yourself and accepted Christ's headship
[1:15:53] for your life amen in the message
[1:15:56] awakening Jesus now brother Branham says
[1:15:59] here he says all down through the
[1:16:00] scriptures they had a commandment that
[1:16:02] the Jews did that if there be one among
[1:16:04] you who is spiritual or a prophet I the
[1:16:07] Lord will make myself known unto him in
[1:16:10] visions and what he says comes to pass
[1:16:12] then hear that prophet for I'm with him
[1:16:14] but if it doesn't come to pass then
[1:16:16] don't hear him now that's just logical
[1:16:19] that's just sensible like when there was
[1:16:22] a man stood up on time Jeremiah major
[1:16:24] prophet the Lord told him that Judah was
[1:16:26] going down to be down in Babylon for 70
[1:16:29] years said don't you listen to a dreamer
[1:16:31] to a prophet or anything says contrary
[1:16:33] to that he put a yoke on his neck and
[1:16:35] Hananiah now Hanna and I was a prophet
[1:16:38] and not only that but he
[1:16:40] the son of a prophet his father was a
[1:16:42] prophet and he came up under inspiration
[1:16:45] and took the yoke off of his neck and
[1:16:48] broke it now God put a yoke on a
[1:16:51] prophets neck neck and told him this is
[1:16:53] the word and this is what I was doing
[1:16:55] the yoke was refract or if from
[1:16:57] reflecting that that is now binding
[1:17:01] God's word he spoke it Amen just like
[1:17:03] thus saith the Lord is binding my
[1:17:05] brother and sister and so that yoke was
[1:17:08] placed there that this will be seventy
[1:17:10] years but Hananiah under a different
[1:17:12] inspiration he comes and he takes in
[1:17:15] this yoke off his neck and broken and
[1:17:17] said thus saith the Lord in two years
[1:17:19] they're coming back who the people could
[1:17:23] clap their hands on it my that was good
[1:17:28] they got excited they've heard something
[1:17:31] that got them excited you know what
[1:17:33] we're all all did I say all going in the
[1:17:38] rapture well come on get excited all
[1:17:48] that are in Christ you see the word
[1:17:51] quantifies it but we could come and
[1:17:54] preach that everyone's going in the
[1:17:56] rapture I don't care how you live no see
[1:17:59] it wouldn't matter if somebody come and
[1:18:01] spoke those things because you see God
[1:18:03] put the yoke upon you and I according to
[1:18:06] the word that we know see we often look
[1:18:08] at this yoke is bondage but you have to
[1:18:10] understand the reference that's being
[1:18:11] made so he puts this yoke on on him and
[1:18:14] he comes and he says going to be seventy
[1:18:16] years and he comes and says nope thus
[1:18:18] saith the Lord in two years they're
[1:18:20] coming back the people could clap their
[1:18:21] hands on that my that was good they
[1:18:23] wanted to listen to Hananiah but it was
[1:18:26] contrary to the word it wasn't the word
[1:18:29] you see therefore Jeremiah said Hannah
[1:18:32] and I Amen the Lord grant your words to
[1:18:34] come to pass but wait a minute let us
[1:18:36] remember there has been prophets before
[1:18:39] us and when the prophet prophesies and
[1:18:41] he is known the Prophet is known when
[1:18:43] his prophecy comes to pass oh my my
[1:18:47] brother's sister not because the words
[1:18:49] are spoken now many people I've heard
[1:18:51] this and everyone's got the right to
[1:18:52] their point of view but I
[1:18:54] people say well I studied the message
[1:18:56] and I see here here and here
[1:18:58] where brother branham said these things
[1:18:59] would happen and they never happened
[1:19:00] well my brother and sister I'll just
[1:19:02] give a little insight God is dealing
[1:19:05] with you can someone say Amen I don't
[1:19:07] always know how God answers your prayers
[1:19:09] imagine if everyone of us come to church
[1:19:11] every single service and told of the
[1:19:14] things that God had done for us we
[1:19:16] almost would have no time for preaching
[1:19:18] or praying or anything because God is
[1:19:21] moving amen and people expect all of
[1:19:24] this to be done on the public stage this
[1:19:26] is their problem they expect it to be on
[1:19:28] the public stage that will see God move
[1:19:31] but the Word of God shows us and the
[1:19:33] Prophet reiterated it that the bride is
[1:19:36] a very small group Oh
[1:19:38] so God is moving in the midst of the
[1:19:41] bride and the world out here which could
[1:19:43] be the make believer unbeliever hearing
[1:19:45] the same message and they're saying
[1:19:47] God's not doing this and we're starting
[1:19:50] to question in this but it's what God's
[1:19:51] doing in the bride because that word he
[1:19:53] prophesied wasn't to the world as it
[1:19:56] were but it was to the bride now some of
[1:19:58] it concerns the world but my brother and
[1:20:01] sister God's not out here as it is
[1:20:03] preaching to the world trying to convert
[1:20:05] the unrepentant the sign and the word to
[1:20:09] the unrepentant is to confirm a judgment
[1:20:12] is coming hmm right they'll be judged by
[1:20:15] the word Amen so it's there that we
[1:20:17] realize God's got a word the bulk of
[1:20:20] this Bible my brother and sister is just
[1:20:22] words and that people read the bulk of
[1:20:25] this Bible is just something they have
[1:20:26] on a shelf the bulk of this Bible is
[1:20:29] something they can make a casual
[1:20:31] referral to but my brother and sister to
[1:20:33] the Bride of Christ this is the word of
[1:20:36] life this is not something casual it is
[1:20:39] not something vague it is not something
[1:20:41] to be just set to the sign but it is
[1:20:43] literally the word of life amen now have
[1:20:47] some I see some Indian friends sitting
[1:20:49] here and I was reading on their history
[1:20:51] some time ago in the early Christian
[1:20:54] days of the Indian and they had to
[1:20:56] follow the game to live and if there
[1:20:58] come a prophet among them and he
[1:20:59] prophesied and told them where the game
[1:21:01] was he become chief but if he prophesied
[1:21:03] a lie that was the end of his road
[1:21:05] imagine if we practice that
[1:21:08] No oh my that's right brother Pavel
[1:21:11] oh my sorry brothers forgot to take this
[1:21:13] guy out behind the church and shoot him
[1:21:15] oh my we wouldn't stand for that there's
[1:21:19] just no way we could stand for that no
[1:21:21] no no no they got rid of him right now
[1:21:25] he didn't live no longer just in case
[1:21:27] you was thought I was being vague about
[1:21:29] what happened to him he didn't live no
[1:21:31] longer well that was the same basis that
[1:21:33] God did God told Jeremiah Hananiah has
[1:21:36] lied I never told him that wait
[1:21:39] the man stood in all his priestly
[1:21:42] garments he stood with the authority God
[1:21:45] said thus saith the Lord but that spirit
[1:21:49] is so strong it anointed him supply
[1:21:53] wouldn't it have been a lot better if
[1:21:55] he'd have just said lord please reveal
[1:21:57] to me is what he Jeremiah is saying is
[1:22:00] that the truth huh not the lift brother
[1:22:06] Pavel up but I really think that song
[1:22:07] was anointed right it's gotta be to
[1:22:10] those who are willing to learn look how
[1:22:11] different this story would be if
[1:22:12] Hananiah went out and said before I open
[1:22:15] my mouth I'm just gonna go out here and
[1:22:17] I'm gonna get down and I'm gonna pray
[1:22:18] and ask Lord Lord what is it I want to
[1:22:21] know the truth Lord are they gonna come
[1:22:23] back in two years or are they coming
[1:22:24] back in 70 years cuz Lord I want to be
[1:22:27] right with your word but you see that
[1:22:29] anointing is so strong that religious
[1:22:31] spirits so strong Hananiah comes there
[1:22:33] but God you know shows Jeremiah says
[1:22:36] look I never told him that it's contrary
[1:22:38] to his word and he'll be off the earth
[1:22:40] within a year in the seventh month he
[1:22:42] died he took him off the earth now you
[1:22:44] see although he was inspired but it was
[1:22:47] contrary to the word no matter how now I
[1:22:50] want you to catch this this would apply
[1:22:51] to me brother David brother Chris
[1:22:53] whoever might stand behind this pulpit
[1:22:55] we're not trying to cut some exemption
[1:22:57] for us it's about them not us my brother
[1:22:59] and sister this pertains to you and I
[1:23:02] amen at the ministry amen look look at
[1:23:05] this now no matter how forceful a
[1:23:08] preacher can preach or how well he can
[1:23:11] make look if it's contrary to the word
[1:23:13] leave away from it stay away from it
[1:23:16] clear it's the word that's God's program
[1:23:19] the complete
[1:23:21] revelation of what he was what he is and
[1:23:24] what he will be it's a continual this
[1:23:27] where I got my title just in case you
[1:23:29] want to know it's a continual revelation
[1:23:33] of Jesus Christ
[1:23:35] so it can't be on the word most of the
[1:23:37] time and off here a little and off they
[1:23:39] are little and then back onto Jesus
[1:23:41] Christ well this is our idea this is our
[1:23:44] idea this is our deal here now no my
[1:23:46] brother and sister it's a continual
[1:23:49] revelation of Jesus Christ a complete
[1:23:52] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:23:54] because you can have something this
[1:23:56] continual but never is complete oh but
[1:24:00] the word here the prophet of God saying
[1:24:01] it's complete Oh hallelujah
[1:24:04] God's not gonna leave any loose ends
[1:24:06] amen
[1:24:08] it's a continual revelation of Jesus
[1:24:11] Christ you know I'll just give myself
[1:24:13] I'll just slap myself a little bit just
[1:24:15] make up for slapping sister Jerry
[1:24:17] earlier now you know sister Jerry and I
[1:24:19] are working on that house remodeling
[1:24:21] away on a house
[1:24:23] she says Paul for the first time my life
[1:24:25] I'd like to live in a house it's
[1:24:26] completely finished you know what she's
[1:24:31] saying she wants all the loose ends tied
[1:24:35] up brother Jake and sister Lisa look at
[1:24:37] each other like go ahead sister Lisa
[1:24:39] lift your hands and just say Amen come
[1:24:45] on we can't laugh at ourselves we're in
[1:24:47] trouble
[1:24:47] but you see not a lot of loose ends
[1:24:50] right cuz we can leave loose ends I you
[1:24:54] know I told sister Jerry probably 14
[1:24:55] years ago don't worry about honey we'll
[1:24:57] look at this stuff and times not over
[1:25:00] yet
[1:25:04] but see God's not doing that my
[1:25:06] brother's sister he's not just leaving
[1:25:08] you won't look down through the Bible
[1:25:09] and find a lot of loose ins just left
[1:25:11] out there or God was like oh just forgot
[1:25:14] to that I'm a little too tired I got a
[1:25:16] new program no my brother and sister
[1:25:18] don't work that way amen
[1:25:20] continual revelation of Jesus Christ and
[1:25:23] a complete revelation of Jesus Christ is
[1:25:25] this Bible anything revealed contrary of
[1:25:28] him telling what he would do what he is
[1:25:30] now old that was in the days of the past
[1:25:32] don't you believe it it's got to be the
[1:25:34] same Jesus
[1:25:34] you see and that's the word now Amen so
[1:25:38] we look at this and realize you say
[1:25:40] brother Paul why'd you read that because
[1:25:41] we have to come to the understanding
[1:25:44] that when God gives revelation it fits
[1:25:47] clearly in his program it is not
[1:25:50] something that has to have an addendum
[1:25:52] and be put to the outside another
[1:25:54] reference or referral as it were coming
[1:25:57] to another book being pulled off a shelf
[1:25:58] my brother and sister I don't mean to
[1:26:00] speak ill of this but I got a lot of
[1:26:01] family background in Mormonism my
[1:26:04] brother and sister what they did is just
[1:26:05] took and created at their own book and
[1:26:08] added it they do not deny the Bible but
[1:26:10] they just basically imply that their
[1:26:12] books supersedes the Bible it's the
[1:26:15] continuation of the Bible but the
[1:26:18] prophet of God don't you love this gives
[1:26:20] you confidence to stand on the word when
[1:26:22] he said there is no other there is no
[1:26:24] other add on here everything must go
[1:26:28] back to the Bible and so then when I
[1:26:31] pick up my church order when I pick up
[1:26:33] adoption when I pick up demonology when
[1:26:35] I pick up all of these things the
[1:26:37] rapture and I read that my brother and
[1:26:39] sister I know that I have the right
[1:26:41] context when it fits seamlessly back
[1:26:43] into the word and if I can't put it
[1:26:47] seamlessly back into the word I don't
[1:26:49] then take this message and throw it out
[1:26:51] and say it's wrong
[1:26:53] I realize that my revelation is not
[1:26:56] lining up with the words and so because
[1:27:00] that is an anointing my brother and
[1:27:02] sister and people would put their their
[1:27:04] revelation above the Word of God and
[1:27:06] then they find a way to make the
[1:27:08] revelation fit now imagine that you
[1:27:10] would take your Bible and I'll kind of
[1:27:12] wished I had some pages you know little
[1:27:14] things slip your mind but imagine you
[1:27:16] know my brother and sister you come
[1:27:17] along and brother Paul would have you
[1:27:19] know have a page here and I would come
[1:27:22] here and tell you now here we are
[1:27:23] revelations 10 seven and you know
[1:27:26] because you can't get this and you don't
[1:27:28] understand it I've added this page right
[1:27:30] in here and that now becomes the
[1:27:33] continuum know who's going to accept
[1:27:36] that but some people think that's what
[1:27:38] the message is
[1:27:39] oh I don't hope I don't offend no one
[1:27:42] but some think that's what the message
[1:27:44] is but my brother and sister the message
[1:27:46] is to take the
[1:27:47] bird and it come back when I say the
[1:27:50] word meaning the message and it come
[1:27:51] back and seamlessly will fit in there
[1:27:54] without changing the context of one
[1:27:56] single scripture there's when revelation
[1:28:00] has come amen
[1:28:02] not revelation that you all have to sell
[1:28:04] everything and give it to me my people
[1:28:06] do those kind of things
[1:28:07] amen and people fall for those kind of
[1:28:10] things but this isn't what God's doing
[1:28:12] he's moving right here in the midst of
[1:28:15] his people amen
[1:28:16] so it's there that he's stirring in that
[1:28:19] place now as we look at this my brother
[1:28:21] and sister we understand how it must
[1:28:23] have been to those people no one would
[1:28:26] want to be sitting there and when
[1:28:28] Jeremiah said you know what you're gonna
[1:28:30] be down there and Babylon seventy years
[1:28:32] some of them would have said oh my 70
[1:28:35] years I'll be dead somebody comes along
[1:28:38] you'll be back in - oh hallelujah I'll
[1:28:42] just go ahead and make this investment
[1:28:44] and I'll just go ahead and do this and
[1:28:45] I'll just go ahead and do that because
[1:28:47] I'm gonna be back in two years they
[1:28:49] would have loved that my brother and
[1:28:50] sister but the word of the Lord was 70
[1:28:54] years no matter how they felt about it
[1:28:58] now look I have made a claim pretty much
[1:29:01] my whole life since I come back to the
[1:29:03] Lord the Lord I want to be one of those
[1:29:05] that's alive and remains at the coming
[1:29:07] of the Lord that's my heart's desire I
[1:29:10] even claim that claim for my mama and
[1:29:12] she's getting quite elderly now 88 years
[1:29:14] old or so 89 you know my brother and
[1:29:18] sister now I can claim that but I can't
[1:29:21] make it soul but I don't really care
[1:29:27] whether I'm here alive and remain at the
[1:29:29] coming of the Lord just as long as I'm
[1:29:30] there with him you see sometimes we get
[1:29:33] an emphasis on things reminds me years
[1:29:36] ago those situation happened down in the
[1:29:38] south and the United States and and I
[1:29:41] use this a little bit loosely a sister
[1:29:44] had a dream that they were all to go on
[1:29:47] a certain date and stand on top of a
[1:29:49] mountain and that was going to be the
[1:29:51] rapture a Moakley it was revealed to
[1:29:53] them and them only and so you know there
[1:29:56] was a lot of people I know some of these
[1:29:57] people I know them personally and they
[1:29:59] quit jobs they sold houses and land
[1:30:01] and everything they had and you know the
[1:30:03] pastor said well you know the thing is
[1:30:05] is to make this come to pass you know
[1:30:07] you probably need to give some of that
[1:30:09] money and we can use it for good things
[1:30:10] before the rapture that should have been
[1:30:14] the first thing that got you going in
[1:30:16] the other direction but you know they
[1:30:19] went stood on top of a mountain on the
[1:30:21] very morning went up there in the dark
[1:30:24] and this mountain has a look out there
[1:30:25] beautiful beautiful view of the
[1:30:27] countryside and they said that in the
[1:30:30] dream when the Sun cleared the top of a
[1:30:32] certain mountain the rapture was taking
[1:30:35] place so the Sun clears the top of that
[1:30:37] mountain nothing has happened and they
[1:30:39] got to looking around and there was a
[1:30:41] certain brother and his wife and
[1:30:42] children were not there and they said
[1:30:45] well it's his fault the rapture never
[1:30:46] took place does that fit the scripture
[1:30:54] you know what they did they went back
[1:30:56] down to the valley and blamed everything
[1:30:58] on him but you know what he says you
[1:31:02] know what his defense was I've got the
[1:31:06] message and I've got my Bible and that
[1:31:09] doesn't fit into either one it's still
[1:31:15] your fault oh by the way talking about
[1:31:19] the money they never saw it again
[1:31:23] you see my brother and sister don't be
[1:31:26] deceived don't be deceived the word is
[1:31:30] here revelation has come it's alive it's
[1:31:35] for you and I amen
[1:31:37] believe it amen the continual revelation
[1:31:41] of Jesus Christ
[1:31:42] the complete revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:31:44] is this Bible amen now as we look at
[1:31:48] this hopefully I'm not speaking too
[1:31:49] strongly to you today amen this is the
[1:31:51] food that's going to keep us amen
[1:31:53] sustain us this is the the life that is
[1:31:56] here this is our roadmap this is what's
[1:31:58] keeping us safe in the day that we live
[1:32:00] in is the Word of God now in the patent
[1:32:03] or vision brother Brown says now this
[1:32:05] actually this morning was more of a
[1:32:07] sermon type placing a foundation upon
[1:32:09] the deity of the revelation God being
[1:32:12] revealed in Christ how many believes it
[1:32:15] was revealed in Christ Jehovah revealed
[1:32:18] in Christ
[1:32:19] now where's God to be revealed in his
[1:32:22] church with his people in us hallelujah
[1:32:28] the same spirit the same works the same
[1:32:31] manifestation the same love the same
[1:32:33] forgiveness the same long-suffering my
[1:32:37] gentleness patience peace mercy all that
[1:32:41] was in Christ is in the church
[1:32:43] remember keep this in mind all that God
[1:32:45] was he poured into Christ he was a
[1:32:47] fullness of the Godhead bodily and all
[1:32:49] that Christ was he poured into the
[1:32:52] church hallelujah who's the church is
[1:32:54] that these four walls and a roof no my
[1:32:57] brother's sister we are the church
[1:33:00] hallelujah God above us God with us God
[1:33:03] in us the tri-unity of God God
[1:33:06] manifested in three different manners
[1:33:07] Father Son and Holy Spirit
[1:33:10] so this revelation my brother and sister
[1:33:12] as it is see it's the revelation that
[1:33:16] God was revealed in Christ
[1:33:20] [Music]
[1:33:21] Jehovah revealed in Christ and God
[1:33:25] revealed in his church you have neat why
[1:33:35] don't you just ask God to reveal to you
[1:33:38] Scott word let the word be revealed to
[1:33:41] us or would you rather I've started
[1:33:46] wearing a collar that turned around
[1:33:47] backwards and maybe even a robe I saw
[1:33:50] really cool in the other day I don't
[1:33:53] know if I would look like a priest or
[1:33:55] Dracula well they're both sucking your
[1:34:01] blood come on Saints you have an
[1:34:07] intercession right to the throne of God
[1:34:11] amen now God's got a he's got the
[1:34:14] minister he's got the evangelists a
[1:34:16] teacher all of these in place for the
[1:34:18] perfecting of the Saints according to
[1:34:19] the word but my brother and sister
[1:34:21] they're not Jehovah they're not Almighty
[1:34:24] God they're men and they're not even
[1:34:26] fallible so when you put
[1:34:29] in the right context put them in the
[1:34:31] right position what will they do I tell
[1:34:33] you I know brother I respect this
[1:34:34] brother a whole lot and I have through
[1:34:36] the years practice the very thing that I
[1:34:38] learned from him and as a pastor people
[1:34:40] would come and they would have all kinds
[1:34:43] of troubles and they would come and say
[1:34:45] pastor you need to give us advice and
[1:34:46] they would pour their troubles out and
[1:34:48] then they were waiting in anticipation
[1:34:50] of a great answer and then he would look
[1:34:52] him in the face and say have you prayed
[1:34:55] about it and they would say yes yes yes
[1:34:57] yes so we prayed about it how long well
[1:35:05] hallelujah then he wouldn't hear from
[1:35:08] him for a little bit and they'd ask him
[1:35:11] now brother sister what about that
[1:35:13] problem we took your advice pastor and
[1:35:16] we prayed about it and God answered it
[1:35:20] mama that's a pretty wise pastor wait he
[1:35:23] doesn't even know really what God's
[1:35:25] answer was right they could tell him we
[1:35:27] got problems in marriage problem in
[1:35:29] finance a problem with children we got a
[1:35:30] problem with this we got whatever it is
[1:35:32] but he don't even know he's not even
[1:35:34] aware of what God did to answer it but
[1:35:36] they are standing there testifying that
[1:35:38] through prayer God answered it what was
[1:35:40] that revelation on the personal level
[1:35:42] come down to them and spoke to them and
[1:35:45] they were then able to go forward in
[1:35:48] their life with an answer with a
[1:35:50] direction because God had revealed to
[1:35:53] them well that's what revelation is
[1:35:55] isn't it or is that the thing that
[1:35:57] everybody gets nervous when someone says
[1:35:59] I have revelation oh my goodness what is
[1:36:02] this going to be no my brother and
[1:36:03] sister God is revealing himself to each
[1:36:05] and every one of us every single day
[1:36:07] every day that the bride is coming
[1:36:10] closer to him is revelation Amen him
[1:36:14] revealing himself to you and I
[1:36:16] hallelujah now let's take all the scary
[1:36:19] part about this what revelation is and
[1:36:22] to realize my brother and sister without
[1:36:24] ever coming to some great conclusion oh
[1:36:26] the scripture meant this and the
[1:36:27] scripture meant that or I saw this or I
[1:36:30] saw that that if you are praying reading
[1:36:32] your Bible submitting yourself to the
[1:36:34] Word of God you will have revelation in
[1:36:37] your life you say brother Paul that's
[1:36:40] pretty far-reaching no that's the truth
[1:36:42] amen you don't have revelation in your
[1:36:44] life is because you are not reading your
[1:36:46] Bible you are not praying and if you're
[1:36:48] doing those two you're not submitting to
[1:36:50] God hallelujah
[1:36:52] oh my the other day I really like this
[1:37:00] quote right here the other day I was
[1:37:02] talking and we were thinking of
[1:37:04] Scripture I said why can't people see
[1:37:06] that now my brother and sister sometimes
[1:37:10] things just seem so clear to us oh that
[1:37:13] that everybody ought to see this
[1:37:15] everybody ought to see this why can't
[1:37:18] people see that I said there it is and I
[1:37:21] happen to think hmmm I don't care how
[1:37:23] clear it is how much scripture teaches
[1:37:25] us you'll never be able to see it until
[1:37:28] God Himself shows it to you don't care
[1:37:36] how clear it is and the whole Bible is
[1:37:39] built and the whole Church of the Living
[1:37:41] God is built upon a spiritual revelation
[1:37:46] of the word look my brother and sister
[1:37:51] not because we can read quotes not
[1:37:52] because we can read scripture but it's
[1:37:55] built upon the spiritual revelation of
[1:37:59] the word amen and I just jump back up I
[1:38:03] want to do ever look this over again it
[1:38:05] is how much the scripture teach it
[1:38:08] you'll never be able to see it until God
[1:38:10] Himself shows it to you don't care how
[1:38:14] clear it is and the whole Bible is built
[1:38:16] in the whole Living God is built upon
[1:38:19] spiritual revelation of the word why did
[1:38:22] they will offer a more excellent
[1:38:24] sacrifice than Cain why didn't a below
[1:38:27] King do you see what the prophet of God
[1:38:32] says right there his church Cain's
[1:38:36] church was nicer I think I want to go to
[1:38:43] a nicer church
[1:38:48] why didn't Abel follow Kane he had the
[1:38:52] most beautiful church but it was
[1:38:55] revealed to him not revelation didn't
[1:38:59] take him over into beauty it took him
[1:39:02] over here into this messy gospel this
[1:39:05] messy gospel now get this I hope you
[1:39:07] catch the spiritual correlation where
[1:39:09] things had to die where blood had to be
[1:39:12] spilt and the blood had to be placed
[1:39:15] correctly oh god help us Lord let us die
[1:39:19] and then let the blood be placed
[1:39:21] correctly upon us amen it's not a
[1:39:24] beautiful church it's not a beautiful
[1:39:26] this and a beautiful that my brother and
[1:39:28] sister if it was we'd all be going to
[1:39:30] Cain's church but God by revelation
[1:39:32] showed us that the very blood of Jesus
[1:39:34] Christ is the only hope that we have
[1:39:37] amen and us dying is the only hope that
[1:39:42] we have because if we don't die my
[1:39:45] brother and sister the blood cannot
[1:39:47] change a single thing that's the part
[1:39:49] that's not really revealed my brother
[1:39:51] and sister when you look down in goshen
[1:39:52] and the blood was over the doorpost hey
[1:39:55] man you didn't have a rebellious father
[1:39:58] saying oh well if they're gonna make me
[1:40:01] get a lamb I'll kill it and I'll put the
[1:40:03] blood in the bowl and I'll put it on the
[1:40:05] doorpost my brother and sister that
[1:40:08] didn't work but that was a father that
[1:40:12] was a man had a revelation that this is
[1:40:15] the only thing old parents I hope you
[1:40:17] get this today this blood over the
[1:40:20] doorpost of my home is the only thing
[1:40:24] that's going to save my children it is
[1:40:28] not we believe the message it is not God
[1:40:30] is good is none of this is the blood
[1:40:33] over the doorpost of my house is going
[1:40:37] to save my children and not buy AB
[1:40:41] Ribble yes parent not buy a rebellious
[1:40:44] household but by submitting to the Word
[1:40:46] of God if this Lord is what you ask then
[1:40:49] Lord this is what I give hallelujah and
[1:40:53] the life in that blood then become God's
[1:40:56] own life over their household and God
[1:40:59] then would say
[1:41:00] their children Oh hallelujah but then
[1:41:04] again if we want a beautiful church that
[1:41:05] doesn't mean we let our church fall
[1:41:07] apart the scenes because we want to be
[1:41:09] humble but by the same token when
[1:41:13] everything has to be so perfect my I'll
[1:41:20] just shut up hallelujah
[1:41:26] I got a pot load of quotes that's sorry
[1:41:29] the slang I'm sorry I've got a lot of

[1:41:52] encourage you go back read these we're
[1:41:55] not trying to twist anything away from
[1:41:56] this or just pull it out because not me

[1:42:01] of God that you see what about these
[1:42:03] days here when all these things taken

[1:42:14] horns and things today if the Lord
[1:42:16] willing you'll see where it's at it's
[1:42:18] the hour that we are in that these
[1:42:20] revelations are supposed to come so

[1:42:25] sister we're not in another day we're
[1:42:27] not looking back we're not looking
[1:42:28] forward we're in the right time it's the
[1:42:32] Book of Revelations the revealing of
[1:42:35] Jesus Christ and we found out that the
[1:42:37] very first chapter he revealed who he
[1:42:39] was and now he's getting the seven seals
[1:42:42] revealing how he redeemed the earth now
[1:42:46] did you catch the real context of the
[1:42:47] last sentence right there he's talking
[1:42:50] past tense
[1:42:51] he's not talking future tense how he
[1:42:55] redeemed the earth that is a finished
[1:42:59] work hallelujah amen we're not waiting
[1:43:03] for some other day for this to happen it
[1:43:05] is redeemed to my brother and sister
[1:43:07] just as sure as we stand here and
[1:43:09] breathe oxygen today there will be a
[1:43:11] millennial
[1:43:12] man just asurs we are here today that
[1:43:14] thousand-year reign with Christ will
[1:43:16] lead us right into eternity with him

[1:43:38] harness on the on the seats or something
[1:43:40] but look at this
[1:43:41] amen revealing how he redeemed the earth
[1:43:45] right now that sets a very firm context
[1:43:48] God's revealing how he redeemed the
[1:43:51] earth one of them was by the name of
[1:43:54] Jesus Christ amen of the ways he's
[1:43:57] redeeming earth one of them was by the
[1:43:59] name of Jesus Christ the other was
[1:44:03] taking the fear out of the people Oh God

[1:44:28] money they can't even back up except for
[1:44:31] with a printing press you talk about
[1:44:34] prophecy coming to pass was that just a
[1:44:36] lucky shot for the Prophet no my
[1:44:38] brother's sister God revealed it was God
[1:44:41] that said this nation would be bankrupt
[1:44:43] but you understand this some people in
[1:44:45] foreign countries go yeah America is
[1:44:47] going right down the drain but you look
[1:44:50] my brother and sister the Prophet also
[1:44:52] and many other places connects every
[1:44:54] economy of every nation every people
[1:44:57] connects it in a chain all together and
[1:45:00] he said that there is one Oh China's
[1:45:02] buying us out well the prophet of God
[1:45:04] didn't say China had the money my
[1:45:06] brother and sister the prophet of God
[1:45:08] said the Catholic Church holds the
[1:45:10] wealth of the world
[1:45:12] look let's get it all in the right order
[1:45:15] hey men not only is our nation
[1:45:17] financially bankrupt it is spiritually
[1:45:20] bankrupt hallelujah all prophesied by
[1:45:24] the prophet of our day amen so what is
[1:45:28] it we come the word tells us everything
[1:45:30] we do we do in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:45:33] amen so there is a recipe you need God
[1:45:37] to come on the scene anybody need God to
[1:45:39] come on the scene you need God to come
[1:45:41] on the scene you call him in the name of
[1:45:43] Jesus Christ you know come and come some
[1:45:45] other back away some other kind of thing
[1:45:47] Oh pastor pray for me Oh pastor this Oh
[1:45:50] what about this no you come on you I'm
[1:45:53] not here my brother and sister to tell
[1:45:55] you what to believe but I'm here today
[1:45:57] to tell you you need to seek the face of
[1:46:00] God you need to ask for revelation you
[1:46:03] need to get behind that veil being on
[1:46:05] that veil you need to do that my job is
[1:46:09] just to encourage you to do that if
[1:46:11] you're waiting for me to give you
[1:46:13] something to get you in a rapture you're
[1:46:16] out of luck because I'm gonna fulfill
[1:46:20] Scripture and I'm gonna keep my
[1:46:22] vegetable oil and I'm gonna trim my lamp
[1:46:28] but God's gracious
[1:46:30] we haven't heard behold the bridegroom
[1:46:32] cometh we haven't heard that voice call
[1:46:34] that we still got time to get oil in our
[1:46:36] lamp we still got time to trim it we
[1:46:38] still got time to clean the globe that's
[1:46:42] shut you all up
[1:46:50] we need forgive me Saints I just keep
[1:46:57] running into people that are doing
[1:46:59] things did you pray about that no what
[1:47:04] kind of result did you expect if you
[1:47:06] didn't even bother to pray about I don't
[1:47:09] care if you want to own a boat a train a
[1:47:11] plane want to buy a piece of land in the
[1:47:14] country you want to build a house you
[1:47:15] want to do this you want to do I don't
[1:47:17] care about those things pray about it
[1:47:20] maybe God will let you get a blessing
[1:47:22] like you've never believed maybe you'll
[1:47:24] stop at a little old wore-out faded for
[1:47:26] sale sign and somebody come along and
[1:47:28] say we've just been waiting for a family
[1:47:29] like you oh it's not impossible I know
[1:47:33] some believers back east a brother just
[1:47:35] went and asked him about a church that
[1:47:37] was he'd heard might be up for sale this
[1:47:40] has been back a few years he goes in
[1:47:43] there in the past years a quite elderly
[1:47:44] man and this brother pastor and the
[1:47:48] message and he says now brother we heard
[1:47:50] there might be a chance you're gonna
[1:47:51] sell your church
[1:47:52] the man says tell me about what you
[1:47:54] believe and he's not ashamed he just
[1:47:57] starts in goes through it and the guys
[1:47:58] like I've heard of you I've heard of you
[1:48:00] guys I don't know that I agree with
[1:48:02] everything that you preach but I hear
[1:48:05] your godly people he said let me talk to
[1:48:07] the board of trustees and to the church
[1:48:11] because we're thinking about closing
[1:48:13] this down and going over and becoming a
[1:48:16] part of another church because we're all
[1:48:17] elderly calls him a couple weeks later
[1:48:19] says can you come see me he goes over
[1:48:22] there sits down the man's very solemn
[1:48:24] and the brother thought you know how we
[1:48:25] all kind of get that little something
[1:48:26] thought oh no the brother said well I
[1:48:29] talked to the trustee board and I talked
[1:48:33] to the church and we're not going to
[1:48:37] sell you the church we're going to give
[1:48:40] it to you but there is a catch there's
[1:48:45] still I think it was like sixty seven
[1:48:46] thousand dollars owed on the building
[1:48:48] you have to assume debt
[1:48:53] hmm we probably can't do that we
[1:48:59] couldn't accept God's blessings in such
[1:49:02] a fashion oh come on
[1:49:04] Saints when are we ever going to come to
[1:49:07] the place that we completely trust God
[1:49:09] come to the place that we just say Lord
[1:49:11] you're in control reveal to me whether I
[1:49:14] go north south east or west Lord not my
[1:49:16] idea not this person's idea not the
[1:49:18] husband not the wife not the children oh
[1:49:21] this might almost sound like heresy
[1:49:24] maybe not even the pastor you know he
[1:49:28] doesn't always get it right either last
[1:49:32] I checked he was human in fact the other
[1:49:34] day I can assure you he sheds blood but
[1:49:41] I'm looking this taking the fear out of
[1:49:46] the people we're only gonna make it
[1:49:48] halfway through here so sister and me
[1:49:50] come in that way I won't just keep going
[1:49:52] I've still got so much I look like a
[1:49:54] smorgasbord this morning I've got it
[1:49:57] piled up so deep here amen Saints would
[1:50:02] you guys do me a favor mmm we got one
[1:50:10] response that was very overwhelming I
[1:50:13] guess you won't do me a favor I'd like
[1:50:18] you to go home and ask the Lord Lord if
[1:50:21] there's fear in any shape or form
[1:50:23] controlling my life Lord will you reveal
[1:50:28] it so I can get rid of it because fear
[1:50:32] paralyzes and if we don't get rid of the
[1:50:37] fear now brother branham uses these
[1:50:40] examples this is not all-encompassing he
[1:50:42] says the other was taking the fear other
[1:50:44] people like like eternal redemption
[1:50:46] justification my faith sanctification
[1:50:47] baptisms no Holy Spirit and one that we
[1:50:50] are eternally secure taking all of the
[1:50:55] doubts out away from the people if
[1:50:58] you've got the earnest of your salvation
[1:51:00] God has already sealed you to the day of
[1:51:03] your Redemption Ephesians 4:30 says
[1:51:06] grieve not
[1:51:06] the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are
[1:51:08] sealed into the day of your redemption
[1:51:12] oh my brother and sister look at this
[1:51:15] now look at this amen
[1:51:17] oh now people you know there will be
[1:51:19] people that just can't fathom this now
[1:51:21] how are you going how are you going to
[1:51:23] backslide you might backslide but you
[1:51:26] can't be lost almost sounds like a
[1:51:28] contradiction doesn't it I back slid the
[1:51:32] young man I got baptized I believed God
[1:51:35] was real I believed everything about God
[1:51:36] I got to about 15 or 16 years old and I
[1:51:39] just back slid and I went away and I
[1:51:42] spent many years away even I had a wife
[1:51:45] and three children and still met hadn't
[1:51:47] made it back but my brother and sister I
[1:51:50] understand this I don't want to sound
[1:51:52] arrogant I don't want to sound bully-ish
[1:51:54] or anything like that but I understand
[1:51:56] this amen you might backslide but you
[1:51:59] can't be lost if you stay in that state
[1:52:01] it showed that you didn't have it in the
[1:52:03] beginning but if you're a child of God
[1:52:05] Oh hallelujah the worshiper once purged
[1:52:09] has no more conscious of sin says he
[1:52:11] bruised that's true so you can't you
[1:52:13] can't be a Christian you can't the Holy
[1:52:15] Ghost and run out and live in the world
[1:52:16] if you love the world in the things of
[1:52:18] the world the love of God is not in you
[1:52:20] so you're just listening to a fault
[1:52:22] sound somewhere the devil got you all
[1:52:25] pufta but if you examine your life by
[1:52:27] the Word of God and it shows you're
[1:52:29] living right down to that Bible pages
[1:52:31] then you've got eternal security and
[1:52:33] there's nothing to be fearing about what
[1:52:37] God promised God will do it hey man now
[1:52:41] you say brother Paul what about all of
[1:52:43] this well I believe when my heart says
[1:52:45] he's talking about Kovan nineteen
[1:52:47] coronavirus or whatever it is out here I
[1:52:50] don't think we have to put an exception
[1:52:53] here or exception there he said by His
[1:52:56] stripes we are healed hey man there's
[1:53:00] nothing to be fearing about what God
[1:53:02] promised God will do it I challenge oh
[1:53:05] I'm glad I can say these are the
[1:53:07] prophets words so I don't have to
[1:53:08] boastful I challenge any person to take
[1:53:12] to that you just take that and walk with
[1:53:15] that word and watch what happens to you
[1:53:19] brother it'll bring to pass everything
[1:53:21] God said so everything that God promised
[1:53:25] it'll happen
[1:53:26] hallelujah whoa I'm sorry I'm gonna quit
[1:53:30] right here because I've got some of the
[1:53:31] best yet to come oh my oh my Saints
[1:53:35] sorry about this well maybe that'll just
[1:53:36] give me a reason to preach another part
[1:53:38] but you look at this my brother and
[1:53:40] sister Oh
[1:53:42] see what God is doing and how he was
[1:53:44] doing it oh my brother and sister I just
[1:53:47] want to make this one point before I
[1:53:48] close did you know that revelation cost
[1:53:53] Abel his life now see if we don't
[1:53:58] understand it will think I'm saying that
[1:54:00] revelation killed Abel but my brother
[1:54:03] and sister revelation brought able to a
[1:54:06] place that he stood on the word by
[1:54:10] revelation and that was contrary to the
[1:54:13] spirit of the day amen and he had to
[1:54:16] this is the part I really mean by cost
[1:54:18] him his life Abel had to submit to that
[1:54:23] revelation but when that revelation was
[1:54:27] revealed he saw it and said that is the
[1:54:29] truth and he submitted himself to that
[1:54:32] and that revelation then started control
[1:54:34] his life but Abel the man while living
[1:54:38] was dead submitted to the revelation
[1:54:42] amen do you know revelation costs
[1:54:44] Apostle Paul his life now these men gave
[1:54:48] up their life literal my brother and
[1:54:49] sister but we're looking at this the
[1:54:51] Apostle Paul he was so zealous for God
[1:54:54] that he was out crucifying the
[1:54:56] Christians believing he was doing a
[1:54:58] mighty work for God but when revelation
[1:55:01] come he went to the backside of the
[1:55:04] desert and he died to himself that
[1:55:07] Christ might live through him amen and
[1:55:10] the Apostle Paul speaks pretty strong
[1:55:12] doesn't he I Paul oh go look back
[1:55:16] through the scripture I Paul he's not
[1:55:19] ashamed he stands up i Paul was called
[1:55:22] of Almighty God
[1:55:23] to bring this word to you but it cost
[1:55:28] him his life
[1:55:33] revelation it's gonna cost your life
[1:55:38] you're gonna die to yourself you got to
[1:55:40] die to your ideas you got to die to your
[1:55:42] nature amen
[1:55:44] you got to die to everything that's
[1:55:46] contrary to the word I'm still amazed
[1:55:50] Saints how people will turn and follow
[1:55:55] you know brother Branham said it's the
[1:55:59] time and age or whatever how he puts
[1:56:01] those words and almost any men can get a
[1:56:03] following
[1:56:04] well sorry the prophet of God said I
[1:56:07] don't want you following me
[1:56:08] I want you following Christ so any
[1:56:10] prophet that would be able to declare
[1:56:13] that right a powerful ministry no don't
[1:56:16] follow me follow Christ then who are we
[1:56:19] anything but to follow us follow christ
[1:56:23] follow Christ but you see the revelation
[1:56:26] of that will cost you your life you're
[1:56:31] gonna have to die to self you're gonna
[1:56:34] have to submit to the world you're gonna
[1:56:37] have to come and present yourself the
[1:56:39] living sacrifice oh you know it'd be a
[1:56:44] lot easier just to you know just just
[1:56:46] kill me get it over with come on I know
[1:56:50] this sounds crass the simpler thing my
[1:56:53] brother and sister would they to come
[1:56:54] and say look you know are you a
[1:56:56] Christian you stand for Jesus Christ
[1:56:57] yeah
[1:56:58] [Music]
[1:57:01] may not even feel not even one tickle of
[1:57:03] pain but the harder thing my sister
[1:57:09] Sharon just graduated from University it
[1:57:12] can't be easy going out in the
[1:57:14] university and being a Christian there
[1:57:15] it can't be easy going out in the
[1:57:18] workforce and being a Christian there it
[1:57:20] can't be easy being amongst family that
[1:57:23] are not believers amongst all of this
[1:57:25] around us it's not easy but if we're
[1:57:28] willing to die to ourselves then Christ
[1:57:31] will take us resurrect us right back up
[1:57:34] into the living image of his word for
[1:57:38] our day oh that's that's what takes
[1:57:41] rugged Christians amen not somebody just
[1:57:44] simply put me out of my misery and it be
[1:57:46] over it takes a rugged Christian my
[1:57:48] brother and sister to be an overcomer in
[1:57:50] the workplace when everybody wants just
[1:57:52] a little nip off of a bottle just a
[1:57:54] little look in a magazine just a little
[1:57:56] of this music just a little of this
[1:57:58] thing and just a little of this thing
[1:57:59] over here you know what's the most
[1:58:03] infectious disease on the earth today
[1:58:06] unbelief the most infectious disease I
[1:58:12] see men some of it close I'm sorry to
[1:58:15] speak this personal my own father-in-law
[1:58:17] stood up for the message for so long I
[1:58:20] don't even know how many years so many
[1:58:21] years but that infectious disease is
[1:58:24] unbelief started putting an emphasis on
[1:58:26] this and I don't understand an emphasis
[1:58:28] here I don't see I can hear in here
[1:58:30] until pretty soon Issa I don't know what
[1:58:31] to believe now we don't want to be that
[1:58:34] doing but the only way we won't be
[1:58:36] getting ovulating by the word Amen let
[1:58:39] God give you that nice big injection of
[1:58:42] faith amen let that faith course through
[1:58:45] every portion of your body where you
[1:58:47] stand on the word and you say I don't
[1:58:49] understand it man I tell you Saints I
[1:58:50] feel bad sometimes there's a pastor I
[1:58:52] read things and I'm like I don't even
[1:58:55] understand that Lord I'm sorry I just
[1:58:56] don't even but you know I'm just gonna
[1:58:58] believe what the prophet of God said and
[1:59:00] Lord this is your word and I believe it
[1:59:04] sounds pretty bad doesn't it because we
[1:59:06] think that maybe the pastor on to be
[1:59:08] really really super smart or something
[1:59:10] no Saints now have my days when I look
[1:59:13] at myself in the mirror and say God how
[1:59:15] could you have me in that office but God
[1:59:21] in His mercy allows me to go die and
[1:59:25] come back and say Lord thy will be done
[1:59:28] amen Oh hallelujah hallelujah Saints
[1:59:32] Amen you say brother Paul you should
[1:59:35] preach this happy I was trying I was
[1:59:39] trying cuz when you make the rapture
[1:59:41] when you stand on that Shore you stand
[1:59:43] in the presence Almighty God you stand
[1:59:44] before the throne if you even had any
[1:59:47] memory of it you look back and say

[2:02:36] a racehorse around the building because
[2:02:38] this is there's just these things I look
[2:02:40] at this and it's just so real and I just
[2:02:42] keep uh uh uh oh my
[2:02:46] Oh hallelujah come on can I just one
[2:02:50] more quote one more quote hallelujah
[2:02:55] amen look God's provided way
[2:02:58] 53:12 Oh one I just got to share this
[2:03:01] can't help myself now to those that are
[2:03:05] all like part me I'm not being flippant
[2:03:08] but to all those that are goody
[2:03:10] two-shoes you never make mistakes you
[2:03:15] never have an attitude you never been
[2:03:17] troubled you never write hopefully we
[2:03:23] don't have any here yeah who is that
[2:03:26] I'm never well I have met him I have met
[2:03:30] oh yes I think they were lying to
[2:03:34] themselves but I've met him near bound
[2:03:39] to be backsliding constantly now here
[2:03:41] again look Saints don't just take this
[2:03:43] as cutoff here back you can find it easy
[2:03:46] enough read what's in front of it read
[2:03:48] what's behind it you're bound to be
[2:03:50] backsliding constantly so it takes
[2:03:53] constant prayer to God Paul said I die
[2:03:56] daily and if Paul had to die daily how
[2:04:00] much more am I going I'm going to stay
[2:04:03] dead have to stay dead all the time
[2:04:07] oh oh my yes and if Paul had to die
[2:04:12] daily to stay right with God and so
[2:04:15] we'll all have to do that just die out
[2:04:17] to yourself and that's getting God's Way
[2:04:21] now there's only two ways of anything
[2:04:23] and that's the right way in the wrong
[2:04:24] way and then ways are your ways and
[2:04:27] God's ways and you can't be in your way
[2:04:30] and God's Way at the same time
[2:04:33] amen that means my brother and sister
[2:04:35] that you can't have behavior contrary to
[2:04:39] the Word of God and say I've got
[2:04:43] hmm that's the right way wrong way then
[2:04:48] ways are your ways God's ways and you
[2:04:51] can't be in your way in God's Way at the
[2:04:53] same time you've got to forget your own
[2:04:55] way to get in God's Way and you got to
[2:04:58] get out of your own way
[2:05:00] to get in God's Way for as long as
[2:05:02] you're in your own way you're out of his
[2:05:05] way
[2:05:06] I like tongue-twisters so forsake your
[2:05:11] ways
[2:05:12] forsake your thoughts forsake everything
[2:05:14] and just rely on one thing thus saith
[2:05:18] the Lord that's all then you know you're
[2:05:20] right and though you can't see it none
[2:05:23] of the senses look at this we got way
[2:05:26] too many people going on census way way
[2:05:29] way too many people going on census
[2:05:30] then you know you're wrong though you
[2:05:32] can't see it none of the census will say
[2:05:35] it's right every one of them will say
[2:05:37] it's wrong but you know it's right
[2:05:39] because God said so that's what makes it
[2:05:43] right now that's his provided way has
[2:05:45] been his word it is his word God
[2:05:48] provided way for human to live is not by
[2:05:51] your senses it's by his word hallelujah
