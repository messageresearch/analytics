the dearest thing from me that's how it should be it shouldn't matter lord whatever it takes is our end goal we want to be on the other side amen so let's sing this as we get ready to hear the word

trade sunshine for brain and comfort for pain that's what i've been willing for whatever it takes for my will to pray oh that's what i'll be willing to do that amen you know it just sounds like something so difficult and you know sometimes and i say this with a bit of humor we say well let's just pray for patience and we get nervous about that but about to give our whole life simply surrender every drop of our whole life to him anyway i want to disagree sister elizabeth brother isaac's family i think that would be second cousin and uh just i don't want to embarrass her but just a wonderful sweet young lady and uh we're happy to have her here she's come to uh celebrate uh eliana's birthday and so it is good to be greet our visitor here god bless you sir pray the lord just bless you today amen is it good to serve the lord today amen you know i just want to say this that we have the third row on on my left here is what i would call the veterans role and um we look right here and when i say that i say that as a great compliment because here is the evidence of the keeping power of god right here in our midst we don't have to look somewhere else we can see that how lives can be blessed and enjoyed and and fully given as a testimony to our lord jesus christ and the ages passed quickly don't they but how glorious it is and amen brother william god bless you my friend happy to see you back amen i pray that your travels were good and a blessing to you and good to see you here in the house of god hallelujah to each and every one of you this morning i say god bless you let's just go into our thought uh quickly today i i just have quite a bit that i want to share with you today and i want to do it in the shortest time possible i want to speak to you this morning on our return and then i would have as it were a subtitle to that to our correct position and i i believe that you will understand that as we press forward brother david sister diane sister ruth send their greetings this morning brother david has shared that the lord just blessed their time in the services and to the ministry was right on time to the needs of the people and we know that that can only be god because there's no way you can travel halfway across the country and know exactly what's going on in someone's life in fact we can't even drive the short distance to grace and know what's going on in someone's life but the lord does amen and he's always right on time he knows exactly what he needs you know the world you know scientific they say let's believe science let's believe science and science says there's no way a whale found jonah and swallowed him and spit him out on the shore but my brother and sister i look at that and i understand where science come from it didn't come from a laboratory it didn't come from man's thinking and man is so man is so incredible in his knowledge and abilities that uh he's he's uh you know still working on discovering what makes grass and so you know they can't do it in a lab right they can't take their own resources they have actually made grass grow in the lab but they had to go out and they had to take something from something else so when they have created their own substance to build from then we will totally trust science but um you know i just think about that you talk about being right on time if your name was jonah this morning you would be thanking god for that whale amen and that it would be right on time for you let's just stand and and just go right into genesis gonna start off here with laying a little foundation uh and um you know this takes us back you might say to the roots and we understand you know that the devil certainly he acts like everyone's friend but i've been quite fond for years of that saying you know that the devil's the one who talked you into robbing the bank and then he's also the one who called 911. and so you know it's it's uh just kind of this this uh relationship we see that as the scripture says he come to kill steal and destroy genesis the third chapter starting with the eighth verse and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the pool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself now my brother and sister i want you just a little comment before we move on right here you see god knew exactly what happened to adam and eve but he never quit calling isn't that beautiful he knows what's happened in our lives and he's just never quit calling and we're in the house of god today because god is talking to us he's communicating he's calling and and i thank the lord that that never ends amen heavenly father lord we come this morning lord it's by your grace and mercy father that we stand here today lord truly if we was to examine our life from the human perspective we would just see a series of mistakes and faults and failures and stumbles but father i'm so thankful today that we can look through this precious blood and lord we see men and women young people father the word of god says they never done it in the first place lord the word of god says that we're clean and white and holy and righteous in your sight and father lord we're not going to listen to the devil's perspective we're going to listen to you lord and just ask you to bless this time this service today this thought help us to express it lord in your precious name we pray amen you may be seated so i start with this scripture because i'm going to use as you might call it the antitype to start off with because this is really not our focus because really truly my brother and sister when a man or a woman uh realizes who they are in jesus christ uh you would say that from that point we have no past amen and so the devil's always trying to to uh open up or bring about what was the past and what happened in the past and we see there in the garden what's so clearly laid out in scripture how this great chasm was opened between god and man and and satan's intention was to uh put something there that was insurmountable that mankind would never never be able to get across would never be able to to uh um uh bridge that chasm and you know this has been a hindrance uh for mankind ever since it's there that there's always the sin question but i thank god that the word shows us so clearly how the sin question has been solved and it is no longer a question but has become a declaration or statement of redemption and uh we realize the whole bible the whole plan of god as it is unfolding is a plan of redemption and it is my brother and sister such a beautiful thought when you realize that it is the recovery it is the bringing back the returning of and it's there that we um only way that mankind cannot return back to the presence of god is that he himself is hindered to the place that he does not respond and so we know that wherever we would call out whenever we would call out the word of god says that he would answer our call amen but you know you look at this and and we can get focused and often times you know people just preach on uh being a sinner and you need to repent but what we really i feel like now don't take this in a hard and fast but i think really what we need to realize is yes we are sinners we need to repent we need to be baptized and be filled with the holy ghost but you have to have a vision beyond that and i think what really changes the heart of men and women children today is when they catch the vision of who they really are not what they have been and and so by catching that vision of who you really are uh repenting and giving your heart to god and moving forward is just a natural reaction to recognizing who you are amen so it's not that we have been so evil and therefore we are no good but it is that satan has thrown this chasm in our way and god says don't worry about it i'm building a bridge across the chasm and so what i need you to do is not look at the depth and width of the chasm but i need you to look at the bridge that i have built across it for you amen and so you know it's it's a such a beautiful thing but men can be hindered in that and and all they can see is i can't do that you know i have dealt you know is in ministry here for a few years now uh and you know you go and you see and you run into people and it breaks your heart because they're they're just saying you know i made so many mistakes i just can't live it that's right you can't but if you just simply would see who you are if you come to the place that you say you know what i saw in the word that i am a son of god then you just keep focused on that my brother and sister and watch god build the bridge hallelujah you know it's not the bridge it's not going to appear overnight it's going to be drilled down to the bedrock first and there's got to be a lot of things that are pushed out of the way a lot of things that are taken away before the bridge can be built but in the whole process i want you to catch this in the whole process the bridge is being built hallelujah and so the word said you know that something's going to change you know and i say that is a broad statement but is that not what you see in your bible when you read it it is talking about what judgment would be for those who have not repent repented not received the word but god is there showing us hey i said something's going to change amen well it won't be god's word that changes amen now we look at this my brother and sister as we'll look at this for just a moment of what something would change now now here we have in joel 2 28 and it shall come to pass afterwards that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions now my brother and sister the prophet of god clearly tied this to the end time it was applicable to israel at that time but it is clearly applicable to the day that we live in that god once again pouring his spirit out upon his people it's no longer just hey we're part of a message movement or we identify with this or we identify this my brother and sister he says that he will pour out his spirit now i say lord i'm here today to receive of your spirit i'm not here today just to say i went to church today but i'm here because i'm expecting something greater than i had yesterday amen and sometimes as uh the song jason sang there is a closing song to the song service my brother and sister sometimes it's hard to say lord thy will be done not my will because let's face it saints it's a very fine line you've heard me say this before very fine line between being stubborn and determined if we have a stubborn spirit we resist all things but if you have a determined spirit god can still stir steer you still turn you but you won't quit hallelujah we don't want to be quitters do we we want to be identified as solidly in the word of god in the will of god and in that we just press forward if it wasn't my brother and sister we would have quit because stubbornness will not get you to heaven well praise the lord now joel 2 28 is so profound of scripture in my opinion that we come along in acts 2 and 16 and find that they want to directly quote that in other words they made foundational the words of the prophet joel brought it into the new testament new covenant said no no that's not just an old testament thing i'm going to bring it forward into the new testament because it applies to you and i and so it comes along and i don't need to read it you know but here it is testifying but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel so bringing this over my brother and sister you'll find in the world when you and i don't want to use the word debate but when you have conversation with people they oftentimes say well no we're not living under the law any longer that's the old testament but they somehow forget that jesus said i didn't come to do away with the law i come oh imagine this now we've all used one i come to magnify it in other words i'm holding this now to the law and you're going to see the details of the law that they didn't even see in the old testament you're going to see the depth of what it was about that they never taught because we are under a new covenant and i'm making it real i'm going to place it and write it have you not seen the little picture of the grain of sand that suppose or rice i mean that they supposedly wrote several thousand words on have you seen that look it up on the internet mr not right now mr google will find that for you that supposedly some the japanese scholar and the way that their words are done has wrote all these words tons and tons of words on a grain of rice now my brother and sister if a man can write multitudes of words on a grain of rice what can god write on your heart he can write all of his word all of his will predestination eternity can be written on your heart amen oh hallelujah thank you lord and i imagine even that some of that might be written in bold you know how in the day we live in if you're texting i never knew this for the longest time i wonder what people thought of me i had no idea that when you put something in capital letters when you sent a text that you were supposedly yelling i've yelled at everybody and i still like to write it in bold text because i can see it but i imagine some of these things that god wrote on her heart is probably in bold text my brother and sister because he wants you to get it he doesn't want you to just gloss over this and he wants you to get it so he's going to write it in bold letters upon your heart i'm going to write these on the tables of your hearts hallelujah so we see this my brother and sister we'll look at these words real quick here of joel 2 28 and acts 2 and 16 17 and you'll realize i could bring ourselves to the idea and say you know what something's fixing to happen but i want to put it this way to you today my brother and sister i want you to see it like this it's not something's fixing to happen something's already happen the word has been spoken and the word will come to pass now i want to know can you identify yourself in the bible can you identify yourself in the word and say that's me he's talking about when he talks about those that will be filled with the spirit amen with their lambs trimmed and clear and when he talks about those that are ready behold the bridegroom cometh and they're not foolish uh who are they talking about is it someone else or is it us today hallelujah it's us my brother and sister that we take a hold of that word and realize when he wrote this he didn't just write it on this page but it resonates to you and i because it's written on our heart amen and it's the word in us saying amen to the word on the page and the word that's anointed by the spirit or heart is saying amen to it because it is one god doesn't have two messages scott doesn't have you know something for him and something for someone else's we'll touch in a minute god's got one word and that word is his identity and that word in you identifies you as him and him in you hallelujah you can't lose on something like that when you become identified completely in him hallelujah i've phrased it this way for many years and i will continue to phrase it this way the rapture my brother and sister is god calling his word home and when his word is in you and he calls his word home you'll go with it because we see clearly the prophet of god said you know it's those who identify in the word and can say amen and act upon it that's the believer not acknowledging that that appears to be true you see too many times and these are not even my own words i won't i won't enlighten you of where they come from but it's not even my own words but too many times we preach god as a historical god what about a real god said i'll be with you even in you did god come to church this morning well we have to say amen to that if we believe the scripture amen god came to church this morning thank you oh we're not looking for something to happen saints it's happening already now ephesians the third chapter this is really in a nutshell the plan of god it is broken down right here in in its utter simplicity if by revelation we can see this and that is what i'm cutting in here at verse nine but catch this to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ now to give clarity to this the prophet of god says whether you're talking about god jesus christ the lord elohim it's all god amen so people get confused even around the message i've run into them that they're they're they're trying to segregate this it's like well you know god's on the throne but i've got the holy spirit in my heart no if you've got the holy spirit my brother and sister you've got god himself amen so you look how this comes down it created all things by jesus christ what is god's name on earth jesus christ amen that's how he chose to be identified to the intent that now and to principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church so what's he doing he's making the church to know amen you know what that's called revelation it's also called relationship i won't go into that my brother and sister but you'll find through the ages and even in the courts of our land right now that if a marriage is not consummated it's not considered a marriage because a man must know his wife and the wife must know the husband so you see there's a deeper depth to this so a deep relationship of the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church see the church is not sitting here in a superficial relationship she's getting a very deep deep deep deep deep relationship it was brought up here talking about esther coming before her husband my brother and sister you know i remember years ago i become enthralled with that story but when it became real to me that it wasn't a king she was coming before she was coming before a husband the relationship by which she dressed herself up and went and stood in the fourier of the king's court was not a queen coming to a king it was a wife coming to a husband oh hallelujah and it was in that that he responded to her not because she was queen he had a queen called vasti if he wanted a wife that was indifferent rebellious and stubborn he would have just kept vashti he was looking for a wife that loved him as much as he loved her and was willing to go above and beyond to express that love and a confidence in the relationship that was there oh hallelujah hallelujah might be known by the church manifold wisdom of god according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord in whom we have a boldness amen now this is the same word my brother and sister in a different form you might say that esther lived by in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him you realize that that is esther in a nutshell right here isn't not that's right hallelujah she was a type of this bride and we are the bride hallelujah so what she was a type of what she give a pre-figure of we are living out hallelujah amen wherefore i desire that you think not at my tribulations for you which is your glory which is your glory amen come on saints god's glorifying the bride he's not just leaving you here you got some preaching go to church go home live life dress like this talk like this do this do that no god is glorifying a bride right here on the earth today now the world my brother and sister they look at you and say they're weird they're odd they're different our church is this look how little they are look how great we are my brother and sister's got nothing to do with it god's not marrying a polluted bride god's marrying a pure bride he's marrying a bride that looks to him and says all we want to do is please our husband have you noticed in the world we live in today that's a very difficult spirit for people to grasp right hallelujah where was it now look what we have inserted right here i have no idea where this come from but it fits perfect i don't know is this a typo i'm serious my notes don't say it maybe i wrote it on the paper maybe brother alex added it but regardless i'm looking at that right there prayer for spiritual strength that's what we need today my brother and sister not not to come and and just be physical oh you know what are we going to do in this age but you see it'll be the spiritual that takes you through the age because the flesh is weak but the spirit is willing the spirit is powerful and god's going to come down and discern and divide and clean and cut away everything that is not in the day that we live in now look at this now for this cause i bow my knees into the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named so what is it we've said it for years but just let me remind you your name is not message believer your name is mrs jesus christ and when you catch that revelation that he's not coming for church goers or message people he's coming for a wife after his own name amen so what is this she's got to be willing to take his name to be identified in him some people find that hard to swallow in india very strong spirit they want to identify themselves as a bride as mrs william branham but the prophet of god said there's only one mrs william branham and she's the one that goes home with me at night so you see how deceptive that spirit is they try to twist the identity by which we come and place it all on the prophet to the age when the word of god says that our identity is in jesus christ and that is the name that we will bear not another that's right the scripture also tells us that he is jealous and will have no others before him no no don't go blaming the prophet my brother and sister it's man's ideas that does this hallelujah a whole family in heaven and earth is named now look as we move on i want to just keep going that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man now when you look at that being strengthened by might or with might by his spirit in the inner man my brother and sister i want to just ask you a question this morning do you ever feel weary you ever feel a little blue i hope you don't mind brother sergey but i'm just going to share it he sent me a text an encouraging text this morning and i was sitting in the office in the early hours and i was feeling a little blue my phone goes ding and i read this and i'm like thank you lord brought me to tears actually thank you lord i needed that encouragement oh i know i know it's just not very manly i don't really care what man thinks any longer that's right hallelujah what i want is what god thinks what god wants it to be amen hallelujah in whom we have boldness in whom we have boldness the christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love it doesn't even say being rooted and grounded in the message rooted and grounded in love you see if we can't have the spirit of love my brother and sister it won't matter how much you quote this bible or quote this message if you have no love in your heart amen so you'll find that the closer you get to god brother branham says this the closer you get to god the humbler you become somebody suddenly realizes i'm not nearly as important as i thought i was right i tell you you don't know how important one little gear on a one tooth on a gear is until that tooth is missing and then it things don't move things don't work right they make a lot of grumbling noises a lot of rumbles and a lot of problems until it just simply falls apart every little tooth every brother every sister every young person everyone has a value intrinsic value to this gospel it's not just about keeping our kids from the world my brother and sister it's not just about oh we got to keep seeing out of the everybody everybody but this is about you and i recognizing god called you and i to fulfill something he called us to a purpose and it's not just to to conform to this but to recognize our purpose in the gospel of jesus christ and when we recognize our purpose we no longer will grumble and growl and shake and shudder about fulfilling our part but we'll say thank you lord that you made me an integral part of your gospel you made me an integral part of the word to be manifested in laodicea the world out here needed to see me and but we're so caught up in well i've got problems i've got problems forget your problems forget looking at the size of the chasm god is building a bridge for you and he wants you to fulfill his word he wants you to walk across that bridge not defeated not your head bowed not struggling along but he wants you to walk across the bridge and say i am victorious in jesus christ hallelujah i've shared this with before i used to have the mentality when i struggled in my life lord if i could just crawl oh come on i don't want to embarrass you but i want to make it real to you i thought if i can just crawl across the threshold of heaven if i can just drag myself beyond the gates right and one day god spoke to me and said that's not what i called you to i called you to march into the gate victorious i called you to fulfill my word and not be there saying oh i'm not worthy i'm not worthy we know we're not worthy and the devil wants to make emphasis on that but for you to realize this is what god called me to i will do it with every fiber of my being i will press the mark of the high calling my brother and sister pressing is not crawling pressing is not staggering pressing is moving forward with strength and determination come on somebody say amen this morning it's time for the bride to recognize we're not a whimpering little bride can you imagine a young man young woman in the prime of life and a man marries a wife only to find out he's got a wife that snots and snivels oh i'm sorry i use such farm language snots and sniffles at every little thing oh honey i would fix you breakfast but it takes effort honey i would do your laundry i'm not picking on your sisters but i hope well anyway i won't go there i'd do your laundry but you realize i'd have to carry that basket into the machine and oh separate the laundry oh i would have cleaned the house but no sir what a man wants he's not a slave not a servant but a partner he's going to go out kill the brontosaurus drag it home he'd like to come home knowing that he's got a wife that has made that building with four walls into a home anybody can buy a house what we're looking for is a home now let me flip this to the spiritual side so many people say oh i want to make heaven my home as though it's dry and sterile and so it's just a destination we're going to what if we realize my brother and sister this house this temple this tabernacle god speaking about in so much of the word is us it's us god's not in the real estate business god's in the relationship business and he's wanting a wife that says i've cleaned the house i've made everything ready and i'm welcoming you i can come there now look i i tell you we preach and you know we can get slaughtered over these things so don't look at the critical side look at look at the point reminds me of a pastor once a couple verge of divorce in the message i know you guys think that's impossible but it's very possible this man this brother sits down with his pastor and says pastor we're done this pastor is like okay you're done i know that's not what you want to hear you want somebody to go oh no please don't do that and look bad for my ministry look bad for our church look bad for this and that what about the children and the cousins you're done remember we sing the song i got my mind made up and i won't turn back i'm gonna divorce that woman this week you'll never change that man's mind are you with me vice versa and he says i don't know what to do finally when the man's just exhausted himself the pastor says could i share a word or two yeah now i want you to remember this goes both ways saints there's no one-way streets in relationships and he says uh when's the last time you bought your wife chocolates now none of you look at sister jerry okay she uses my money to buy herself chocolates there's ain't no chocolates out there in the field where i'm at and he says i i don't and he says when's the last time you bought your wife flowers when's the last time you took it to dinner i haven't i don't well before you divorce her why don't you start give it a try now i want you to see my brother and sister the depth of despair that can be contained amongst people that say god sent a prophet that should be the fix all for us right no it's not i'm sorry to tell you he brings chocolates home comes in the door sets up on the kitchen counter which is full of unwashed dishes pots and pans it's just filthy and his wife looks at him what are you trying to do what's that for just thought i'd do that for you a couple days goes by comes flowers and this goes on for a period of time and finally one day she meets him at the door and she confronts him and says what's this all about what are you trying to do he said i'm trying to tell you i love you but he comes home the next day there's not a dirty dish on the counter there's not laundry piled up in the laundry room and i'll cut the story short comes back one day she meets him at the door and when he walks in the door she wraps her arms around him says i love you now my brother and sister do you realize that's also a perfect type of our relationship with christ god is not going to force you to do the laundry your laundry god's not going to force you to clean yourself up but he's constantly letting you know i love you i love you i love you i love you and this bride of christ in this day that we're living in right now is going to meet him at the door with her arms wide open saying i love you i love you this is not a silent i can give you quotes if you want them my brother and sister brother branham says this is not a little timid bride this is a bride that knows what she wants this is a a a a redeemed people that have a voice and they're going to tell god that they love him that they care for him give praise to him come on can we get it out of the natural into the spiritual amen right and to know might be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which pathos i never can't say that word isn't that terrible pass this close enough you got it knowledge that you might be filled with all fullness of god now unto him that is able to exceedingly to do exceedingly abundantly all where's your expectation saints come on i want you to get get out of the stupor get into the expectation that he is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think now i want to know what are you asking for a divorce no sir a relationship lord i want to have a relationship with you i want to be filled above all things to comprehend what is the breath and the length and the depth and the height that's what i want i want an all-encompassing relationship hallelujah you imagine what marriages would look like if we could all go that far come on saints possible lord help me yeah now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us this is not something he's doing helter skelter here there nor saints he chose you and i to do this work in he's bringing us back to this place in the garden we see that as he's there adam adam where art thou and he was finding this my brother and sister he already knew they had fell already knew they had transgressed he knew they were hiding but he didn't come and say you rotten unbeliever you get out from underneath that fern bush and come over here he called from the depths of the garden in the coolness of the evening time and he was calling come come adam where art thou oh put your name in there today paul where art thou insert your name i ask you today insert your name in there hallelujah unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout the ages world without end i hope you're with me on those thoughts this morning hallelujah now look at this excuse me for for just getting a little excited this has been something that that i've been just uh chewing on for for way too long here amen now look here brother branham now this is also in the message what the holy ghost was given for what was the holy ghost given for the church has been in the world for some time and the church really after the reformation of 1500 years of dark ages luther was the first reformer to come forth after the round of the apostles and then when luther come forth god tipped up a little bit of the spirit and poured it out upon the church in justification now almost i almost and then i thought this is too silly and then i realized i'm silly anyway so i should have just done it but my brother and sister i meant today to put the little table out here and put an empty container and a full picture beside it and just give you a very visual of him pouring a little bit out in justification now my brother and sister the justification would that be enough to satisfy the age we're living in not at all he poured a little bit out but he comes along now and then in the days of wesley he poured out a little more of himself see this is not just something people get i don't understand that they get this idea the holy ghost is somehow detached from god it's a separate some kind of entity it's god himself my brother and sister that's being poured out hallelujah they poured out a little more of himself into sanctification okay here we got this now we're gonna just pour this picture and you know it's now maybe a third full and as the age has grown on to the end time god has been filling his church amen it's not just here's my message here's this here's that believe it leave it whatever god has chose you and he's been coming by the holy spirit and he's been pouring into your life now our seasons are not all the same amen so you can't judge the whole body of believers this is a problem the unbelievers or people out here on the fence or having my brother and sister they're looking around and they're judging this whole body of believers by their relationship with god and saying there's nothing to the message nothing to the message i'm telling you they need to just go find somebody else and look at that life and realize god is pouring out and he's filling up a bride with himself hallelujah and as he fills this bride up just look around and find out if that's truth or not and so we look at this my brother and sister just you've got to be open but if we put cellophane or we put a lid on the picture pretty hard to pour into it isn't there now this might sound a little direct but i literally in the last couple years had somebody look me in the face and say we have heard enough of the message we don't need to hear anymore it ain't no wonder they're in the condition they're in that's right they're looking at the message as though it's a encyclopedia and of course i know all of you have read your dictionary recently come on saints all we got to do is stop and look around and find out if it's truth or not brother bob sister joanne is it truth amen i tell you what like i told you i didn't realize what i was saying when i said this is a veteran role brother bob sister sue is it truth or not hallelujah right when the word says the keeping power amen i know we know that brother bob's sister sue brother bob cecilia joanne have never had troubles they're they're the really blessed ones life has always just been a cakewalk everything they've ever wanted to do just fell in their lap and they've never been tempted by this or tempted by that or had a struggle with that it's just all been glorious but he poured out his spirit on all flesh some received it and some rejected it but those that received it gave he the power to become sons and daughters of god oh lord lord i just poured out lord jesus we're here pour it out saints this is not just a game this is not just words to be spoken you yourself have got to literally say lord i'm taking the lid off my picture i'm taking the cellophane off my picture and i'm going to be ready lord for you to pour something into me i want to be filled up i'm not ready for a third of a picture a half a picture two-thirds of a picture lord i want to be full and i can tell you this morning as i was studying the message the prophet of god says that's part of the problem is people are not sincere enough they're not seeking they're not sighing they're not crying they're just saying oh we've got it we believe no wonder he'll have an indictment for this generation amen amen am i preaching too hard i hope not john in 8 and 31 he said then jesus said to those jews where's the quantifier which believed not those that were there and heard it not those that saw it happen not those who heard it second hand but those which believed those jews which believed on him if you continue in my word see another quantifier can't turn on you've got to continue that means you get up wait it might have been this morning i just love that joke i'm sorry you know i don't mean to insert it but i think a little bit of toned down humor would be good for us this morning you know the man's laying in bed with a pillow over his head and his wife saying honey get up get up come on go to church he's like i ain't going to church i don't want to go to church honey you got to get out of bed you got to go to church after this goes on for a few minutes finally the man says why give me one good reason why i should go to church because you're the pastor i know you all never never never have to fight yourself to get up and go to church you're all busting at the door up at 6 15 dressed just waiting no sir i'm not here to criticize those that struggle in a little late or anything like that don't misunderstand me but what is it there's a spirit like we have heavy feet i'll sleep in just 10 more minutes just 10 more minutes just 10 more minutes hallelujah those of you have that problem and how you fix that is really simple you put the alarm as far away from your bed as you can and you put it behind something so you can't throw your pillow at it you can't throw a book at it why is that spirit there saints come on can i be blunt with you today why is it sometimes it is so hard to find enthusiasm now i'm not picking on brother adam he's our resident hunter as we all know but this is held true i've watched this and witnessed this through the years hunting trips fishing trips vacations oh can't believe it we got a flight out of boise at 5 00 am we're up at 3. god church at 10 30 we're up at 10 15. why is that why is it it's the spirit of the age because if he can keep us from this my brother and sister every little detour every little hindrance to keep us from going in the words oh i know i'm gonna i'm probably skin and knuckle or whatever coming to church in the spirit isn't your wife reading to you out of the bible while you drive to church lord just bless the service bless the pastor today amen we're in church sit down and the world is all over us we haven't shed the spirit of laodicea it's all over us and then the pastor just certainly wasn't very inspired this sunday morning i'll tell you what for every sunday the pastor gets up and preaches that it wasn't inspired i'd like you to compare with honesty how many services you came and you weren't inspired praise the lord lord jesus is all the pastor's fault and i'm not saying that don't feel sorry for me i'm trying to prod you now look right here what what brother brown says this is actually previous to the quote of what the holy ghost was given for what was the holy ghost given for these are actually earlier but i read that in that order on purpose and that's the way god did followed his own laws god cannot follow give you one law to follow and him follow another no imagine that so god's got us right on the same page with him he follows his own laws then god in order to redeem the lost church the lost world the lost creation god who is infinite in spirit to redeem the lost human race god himself become kin folks i like that i like family most of the time a man a son that he created in the womb of mary then he made an ensign or a testimony outside the gate of jerusalem he was lifted up between the heavens and earth and died and redeemed everything and in bleeding he sanctified a church that he himself might live in come on this this is my brother and sister i'm going to take this in a very very very strict method god wants to live in the four walls of grace he doesn't want this sometimes saints if this fits you then receive it if it don't fit you don't worry about it but sometimes it bothers grieves me that we can have a moving of the holy spirit in this church and the doors be wide open and people laughing and joking and whatever and the very spirit of god that was right here moving on hearts is then evaporated because we we want to just walk through the sanctuary we want to do all of these things where's our reverence grace tabernacle i'll speak really hard to you this morning we're losing our reverence of this sanctuary this is a church god wants to live in four walls god wants to be honored in amen now i said that kind of harsh i don't mean it harsh but i believe it's the truth i believe it's the truth we're not here to laugh and joke in the sanctuary this is god's house amen god became kin folks a man a son that he created in the womb of mary made an insider a testimony outside the gates of jerusalem he was lifted up between the heavens and the earth and died and redeemed what did he redeem everything and in bleeding he sanctified a church that he himself might live in and fellowship and commune with that lost spot of fellowship from the garden of eden where god came down every evening church time come on saints we can have our own time to walk as it were in the garden with him well do we want to or are we going to just hide under the fern and say well i'm naked i'm blind i'm this i'm that come on come out from underneath the fern come out and face it up lord i got something in my life if you have something in your life this morning and i'll just put it this way i personally feel like every one of us sometimes harbors some little something in our life that we need to just get rid of it might be frustrations at family members wife children it might be a little something that we just need to let go of i personally think that's why the prophet of god said repent every day don't let the sun set on your wrath just repent get those things settled up don't let them build up amen that's why the garbage man comes to your house once a week and takes the trash away that we don't end up with the alley full and the garage full in the driveway full right get rid of it wash it away let it go amen he sanctified a church that he himself might live in and fellowship and commune with that lost spot of fellowship from the garden of eden where god came down every is that what it says every evening did you notice god come down in the cool of the day in the setting of the sun now there's something about this just struck my heart this morning i sat there in tears there's something about when it starts to get night people think of church and of god christians you see the sun setting you realize your sun is setting i told sister jerry here a day or two ago how did we how did we get here how did we look at this face i can't imagine another 20 years somebody's going to be say well i don't know who who that brother was but he's the skinny brother over there with the wrinkly face where of the year is gone you know we can serve god just as good today as we can in the future start something good today worship today praise today give glory to god today be obedient to the word today don't put it off don't let it go come on you say well brother paul you're kind of preaching straight this morning that's right because i'm getting older and i'm going to stand before the lord one day brother branham says you're going to answer paul i know you didn't find that quote but i did you're going to answer paul for every single thing you say and i want you guys to be aware my brother and sister the time to play is over the time for games is over the time to just come to church and just be able to say god sent a prophet that's all over god's looking for a relationship god's looking for a people that want to move into his house hallelujah because he's there knocking on the door to move in to our house you know reminds me it didn't end well for this couple but in the message quite a few years ago as young men i believe in the beginning they were truly in love mary's a bride marries a wife then he goes out of state goes a couple thousand miles away and works for eight nine ten months at a stretch and then when it didn't work out and their marriage fell apart neither one could figure out what went wrong seems silly doesn't it i'm sorry some people say i'm dependent and i am i am dependent yes sir brother jason's lifting a hand some of you can go ahead and lift your hand that's right i'm dependent god gave me a godly wife who is not only a good cook that is actually fairly high on the list believe it or not for most men okay i'm sorry i shouldn't make fun of this we're dependent on god we can't live without him i don't want to see him every six eight ten months i don't wanna see him once a year i don't i wanna see him every day i wanna i wanna be in his presence every day i wanna be fed every day i wanna be comforted every day imagine what adam and eve felt like in the garden they knew they had sinned they knew they transgressed the word of god and and now they're walking through the garden and they're they're hiding there's no open fellowship we'll get to that if i can just hurry along and he lost that fellowship because sin would not let him do it oh in the cool of you come down and commune with them and there he lost that fellowship because sin would not let him do it and then he was made flesh and dwelt among us in order that he could come back again to man live in man restore man to a state of communion with him again and give him back his god-given right what was that god-given right communion fellowship with god in the cool of the evening come on i'm going to just take what the prophet of god's word said communion in the cool of the evening church are you with me saints i'm not chiding you i want to just bring you aware if we come into church and there's no presence of god there's something that has kept him from coming down and communing with us what might that be i've already picked on you enough i won't even go that direction give him back his god-given right what is that to dwell in the presence of god that's what he did that's the purpose of the holy ghost it's the father again god the father dwelling in you working out his plans to finish his plan of redemption working through you amen making you remember i told you the other day the word of god is not self-fulfilling i told you i had a quote for that word of god is not self-fulfilling prophecy is not self-fulfilling right here this is what supports what i was saying dwelling in you working out his plans to finish his plan of redemption working through you making you a co-worker not god coming down and saying okay you're going to be saved you're going to have the holy ghost you're going to live right you're going to do this you're going to do that no god making you a co-worker lord you need somebody to pray here i am lord you need someone to worship here i am you need somebody that cares about the body and supports and lifts up the body here i am lord you need someone to dig in the word here i am a co-worker amen giving you a place giving you a part for your fallen lost brother or sister you know oftentimes my brother and sister we get to the place that we look out for believers really well but we don't look out for much of anybody else we're not worried about the person on the street we're not worried about that i'll tell you what happened here the other day and i felt very checked in my heart and brother isaac did at the same time we're here in the church doing some stuff and this man you know normally we'd lock the door but we didn't and this man comes stumbling in and he's talking about how he's in the homeless shelter in boise and he's missed his bus and now he's going to lose his bed and i need you you have to he's talking to me you have to drive me to boise so i don't lose my bed and i'm like i'm here working i was a little annoyed i hate to admit this but i believe it's good we do i was a little annoyed it's like look i'm here working i'm not here to drive you to boise because you can't get on a bus on time and then the man was there for the longest time even talked to the homeless shelter and they said well we'll save his bed if he can get here uh if some assurance of getting here and i said well it don't look like he'll get there and he said well could you drive him to the salvation army uh they have a few open beds he could stay there the night we'll save his bed for him doing this and doing that and and i was like okay well that's probably what we'll do we'll just drive them over salvation army and and they can you know get a bus tomorrow and whatever then i just felt a presence what if this was jesus christ i'm not caring about this man's plight god help us god help us can we get so callous and so caught up in our life that we can look at this and forget why we're here the man in the meantime was discouraged walked off then we're like you know what we're going to find a compromise on this when isaac called an uber i went and found the man almost up to the boulevard got him to get in the car brought him back we waited for an uber and i took that time to sit on the seats in the foyer and ask him if he knew jesus christ the whole time repenting in my heart what if what if what if what if the lord sent a homeless man in our midst to see if we actually had any love for those that are lost i hate to admit this to you in the first half of that narrative i failed miserably but i thank god that he just nudges us and nudges us and is there lord i told the gentleman i said sir i'm sorry sorry and he was there i don't know i could be honest and say i think he was a little mentally uh cognitively impaired gentlemen but what's that got to do with me what's it got to do with you have we lost saints have we lost our care for those around us in this world now we have to use wisdom tell you about a time in phoenix that a man come and i i thought he was sincere and i gave him money and literally five minutes later he's over there some man we never even saw in the dark buying drugs off of him but i told the man whatever you do it's up to you now you want to lie to me use it for something else that's fine but don't let those kind of things stop you from losing your care for the lost your heart's desire to the lost our visitor today sat for just a few minutes and chose to leave it's okay we can't we can't change to make it fit somebody but we can be real of who we are in jesus christ he's alive he's well now look at this there's not enough spirit touching it to go to the souls oh let me go back up when it strikes in their heart let me back up way further let's just go to the top i'm lost here adam adam where art thou that's what the holy spirit does to a man or woman when it strikes in their heart and takes its abode there's a thirst and hungering for lost souls that's what's the matter with the meetings today there's not enough spirit touch in it to go for the souls of the lost and the dying it's more to make a name or a church or a building or a denomination instead of a soul-winning program yeah how pitiful we could stay on it much god poured himself into christ correct christ poured himself into the church therefore now watch at that day you will know that i am the father and you are in me and i am in you hallelujah you see my brother and sister we got to think beyond the here and now come on i gotta go work tomorrow i gotta fix this i gotta do this we're gonna go here we're gonna you're gonna get beyond the here and now and you got to think about eternity we got to get to the place that what we think about what we focus on is not here and now but it's on eternal things amen have i skinned you enough you ready to quit and that day you'll know it first the whole thing is one plan of redemption coming down that god coming back to live in dwell with and commune to his people now i want to tell you my brother and sister he doesn't just want to be in your house he wants to be in you and he doesn't just want to be in your house now i know none of you married folks but unfortunately jerry and i have experienced this i'll just make it easy for the rest of you you don't have to say amen get a little miffed your wife or your husband or your children or your parents and we give them the cold shoulder they're in the house with you but you don't talk to them amen amen amen amen amen cold shoulder here and a cold shoulder there and i am justified i am justifying i'm right there wrong i'm right there wrong i will give them a cold shoulder you don't want the second verse we've got picture jesus christ on the wall we've got a picture of the cross or a cross we've got a picture of brother branham and we've got a cold heart and a cold shoulder if you put confidence in those pictures you're an idolater god's not on your wall he's in your heart amen the cross is not on the wall it's in your heart and the words of a prophet for this generation are not on your wall they're in your heart so we can come to the place saints that we will be there and so we have to come back god coming back to live in dwell with and commune to his people as he did at the beginning imagine if god came so real and walked literally in the doors of our house would he have to say sorry brother adam adam adam where art thou paul paul where art thou chris chris where art thou j j where art thou come just saying just saying i like these this is what motivated this whole sermon right here now then as soon as he gets his church in speaking conditions you know what speaking conditions is you talking to him just as much as he's talking to you some people you know i've done this lord forgive me the people i've tortured through the years i remember not falten sister jerry but i can remember going home spending you know an evening dinner with someone and jerry going um paul i don't mean to be rude honey but do you realize that they couldn't even get a word in edgewise it's like me yeah you you see that wasn't a conversation conversation has to include someone speaking back so it's not all us lord now lord i need a better job i need a car i need a house i need this i need that i don't need to need my kids to do this i need my wife to do this i didn't need it's not a conversation and if god speaks and you never answer that's not a conversation are we all on the same page as soon as he gets oh i hope you see this this is very very important to the future of this this quote as soon as he gets his church in speaking tradition gets his church to a place that he can flow himself through love and persuade and fellowship then there will come an eden then we return back amen where we walk in the cool of the evening with our lord jesus and he'll take his church back to where it left him at back to an eden again near where it fell and now that's made its first start or fall there is where it will be taken right back with every clean slate of redemption bringing them straight back to that place again oh hallelujah just can i have a couple more minutes amen now look at this malachi 4. now if you feel free to just go ahead and voice it when someone says malachi 4 what do you think of that's right that's right brother bob why did we kick the other verses out why have we sidelined the other verses but we've done that we have done that my brother and sister we don't make any less emphasis of verses five and six but we're not giving emphasis to the others for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven has that taken place not physically on the earth yet all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble so we're not quite here yet right now we understand that the word of god is not a chronological reading right so god lays a seed leaves that seed in the ground for a season other events take place while the seed is coming to pass right happens all the time on the farm that revelation is very real to me because we'll do things plant a seed and we might be spraying something over the top of that crop or we might be irrigating or we might be doing whatever fertilizing doing whatever but that didn't change the fact the seed's been planted all they do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts and shall leave them neither root nor branch i'll tell you what verse 2 actually means quite a bit to me now some of you might stumble if i say verse 2 means as much to me as verses 5 and 6 do you following me oh i know some people said paul left the prophet behind no i'm sorry i'm following where he pointed me to he said there it is go but unto now who is this who is this hallelujah sister hit it right on the head the you there is me me as you you is me but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the sagebrush dry hill no sir you'll grow up as calves of the stall what is the calf of a stall i will provide every thing you need i will take care of you morning noon and night i shall shelter you i shall give you brother brown preaches about that right goes into her about the calf raised over in the weed patch and the one stall and all the whole thing that goes with that my brother and sister you look at it he covered it look it up but you look at that now the calf of the stall is god's promise to you that everything you need he's going to provide i want to ask you if you feel that way this morning come on we ought to be able to say i feel that way this morning we shouldn't say i i i feel like something's missing we should be able to say i know that my god is a provider and he's providing for me i'm trusting him i'm not crawling out of the stall i'm not picking the lock and going to another pasture i'm not going to do anything i'm going to stand here and take what god has provided for me hallelujah amen grow up as calves of the stall and ye shall wait i thought god was doing this come on saints look at this malachi 4 replies let's not go cutting those letters out of our bibles now and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes unto the souls of your feet in the day that i shall do this saith the lord of hosts you know what's happening god's word four five and six god's word in you it's what's overcoming the world god is not leaving you as some little baby to follow along behind him while he fights this battle of the spirit of laodicea god said i will be with you even in you and you are going to come out here and tread down the wicked you amen not the prophet amen not these great preachers over here you the bride of jesus christ are going to tread down every evil spirit every wicked thought every wicked and perverse situation you are going to tread that down you are going to be identified as the overcomer because you see my brother and sister to wrap this up going back to the garden who was in control adam was in control until he relinquished it god help us we're not here today in control and then relinquishing it we can bind every spirit we can loose the holy spirit is this not the word of god have i ventured off the word into some man's ideas this is what the scripture says that you will do this you will fulfill the word you shall be the one filled with the spirit that will then bind and release and loose and whatever that you have loose will be loose and whatever you have bound will be bound it's not someone else we don't got to look back i'm sorry i don't mean this rude but we don't got to wait for a prophet to come back my brother and sister the word right here empowered you hallelujah and if you're waiting well you just might miss it you just might miss it because i'll tell you if you want to google it google it perry stone on youtube is standing right there line by line going through brother branham's prophecies saying could it be the fulfillment he's not he's not there as a critic he's not saying well this guy was this and this guy was that he wouldn't claim to be a message believer but he recognized his truth he's there does kamala harris fulfill this the first prophecy is fulfilled second one's fulfilled third one's fulfilled fourth one's fulfilled fifth one's fulfilled we have number six and he talks about kamala harris could she be that beautiful but cruel woman and then he brings up and what is the prophecy of i see america in smoldering ashes you know what the prophet also said when you see them coming for the oil we're right at hand we're right at hand they're not looking to someone else out here these people are increasingly looking to these prophecies and saying what does it mean where is it you know even voices that said in the past william branham was good until he got off at the end have quieted their voice saying we have seen unparalleled fulfillment of prophecy they can't explain it they don't see it they can't come back to malachi 4 5 and anchor their soul in that and say praise the lord i'm the one that the word that word my brother and sister now let's turn this around because god chose to do this and he he put verses four five and six together tied them together in this but look at this now my brother and sister you can turn this around because we would have not been a calf in the stall except for verse five come to pass we would not be enlightened to realize that we were called to bind the spirits of laodicea and tread them under our feet except for elijah the prophet come once again you see what happened while all of this was here the seed was watered and it come forth to fulfillment i'd almost invite you all to our young our grace kids today you know i told you church about how we gave the kids corn seed and put them in a little dish and different things have happened and we're not here to criticize any of the children that their corn seed isn't growing or it's gone or whatever but i've got another point that i'm going to make with the corn seed today you see my corn seed that i planted i don't know kids you still have your corn seed probably most would say no but mine's about that tall but i cheated because i had a point i wanted to make so i knew i had to make my point but i also got another point do you know i got two corn plants growing in this little dish and on purpose i never gave them room to grow now they're starting to lose their color their vigor they're starting to show evidence of lack of nitrogen lack of potash they need a little sulfur if you're in a dish today and you find yourself stalled out in your spiritual walk why don't you give yourself room to grow why don't you get out of your little pot this is how i see the message this is how i see myself this is how i see church this is how i see get out of that pot plant it somewhere because we're actually today give the kids young kids a little pre-figure today we're actually going to pop those plants out of that and they're going to see roots that instead of going down into deeper soil have turned back on themselves because they got nowhere to grow now it might sound like i'm anti-message this morning and i'm going to tell you i'm 150 percent or 200 or 5 5000 whatever number you want to put to it sold out on this message but if you don't give god room to grow in you you're going to turn back on yourself and then ultimately you're going to run out as matthew declares some amongst the stones and some amongst the thistles some in good soil some sinking their roots down and saying that word of god right there that we've read today i've heard today i'm gonna fulfill that i'm the one that's gonna be ready and when the rapture comes i'm gonna be there giving praise to the lord and i'm gonna be saying this was for me hallelujah it might not be for you might not be for you but it was for me i'm fulfilling this word because god promised and a prophet brought the words gonna take me right back to eden hallelujah and i get a walk in the cool of the evening not just in a pre-figure but i'm going to walk in the cool of the evening with my lord jesus christ and he's going to talk to me oh no paul that's that's that's old days that's time gone by that no you know no no i'm sorry get rid of that catholic spirit get rid of that old denominational spirit that's turned it into a form but no godliness amon i want power my brother and sister amen so it's there i'll send you elijah the prophet why'd he send us a prophet come on let's get down to the rubber hits the road why did he send us a prophet the prophet's own words i don't have the quote right here was that he would tie up all the loose sins his own words my brother and sister he didn't say i myself will give you rapturing faith he said rapturing faith is on those tapes and what was on the tape preaching jesus christ there's where rapturing faith is that is in jesus christ hallelujah and he's going to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers i want to ask you has it happened yes hallelujah it's happened mr emmy will you come i still got quite a bit more i'm telling you what if i ever start a restaurant it's going to be a buffet hallelujah oh my no oh praise the lord i gotta stop gotta stop gotta stop so you know there's that song he's still working on me he's pouring into his church into his people we're not gonna sing that song it's just he's pouring into his church show me one place he said he was going to stop right into the time that you take a body change god's going to be pouring into you come on you know what i'll tell you what go to chili they live in a dusty dirty environment every sister that's got a pitcher of lemonade or juice or something they're real fond of putting cellophane over the top of it that's where this idea is rooted they put silicon keep the dust out but it also keeps everything else out it's kind of a funny story and this is rooted in my deal one time you know they don't have much ice most of them don't even have a refrigerator that would be much more than just a little cool box and this sister is a good friend to me i laughed and laughed and laughed at her and she got all embarrassed but she come in there with a big picture with ice and she sees these these pictures with lemonade and stuff in them and she's talking she just walks over the first one starts pouring ice but there's cellophane on my eyes just like a trampoline and i just laughed and laughed and laughed at her sister ellie and um but it anchored a phone as clear as it might be saints that you don't even see that there's things in our lives that are keeping the spirit imported to us i want to caution you to encourage you i want to i want to stir you to recognize it might be something you can't even see but would you just today maybe tonight tomorrow whatever just stop ponder your life and say lord what is it if there's something lord in my life that would keep you from pouring into me would you take the cellophane off of me lord would you take that off of me that's keeping the holy spirit from filling meal saints we're living in a serious hour we're living in a serious hour it's not a time to play games any longer and say well if you just understood the circumstance of my life well maybe i won't understand maybe i'll never know the circumstance of your life but i'm telling you you have the ability yourself to pull the cellophane off and let god pour his holy spirit into your life that you could be full having need of nothing contrary to the spirit of laodicea that says ah we're rich we have need of nothing my brother and sister god's wanting to pour into this bride of christ his spirit his life that we would need of nothing right take that back you say brother paul where are you coming well look the prophet of god said everything you need to make a rapture is already in you but something's got to bring that to life god let it come to life in me lord let it come that i could see amen now i'm going to close with this right here before seal oops what did i do my oh my in the fourth seal sister jerry shared this with me and i just thought it was wonderful maybe it'll make you feel a little bit better about yourself he takes something ignorant and stupid something that don't hardly know your abcs or anything then he takes that type of a person because he can take something that's nothing and then work through it as long as something thinks there's something then they can do nothing with it he's always did that you have to become nothing to become somebody with god oh hallelujah you love the lord today you know i'm trying to break this old long-winded habit praise the lord when i think of the goodness of jesus and all he has done for me and my soul cries out hallelujah praise god for saving me oh when i think of a goodness hallelujah praise god for saving me one more time christ hallelujah hallelujah you know i just felt like the holy spirit just moved you know i had in my notes here he has forgiven me then brother jason gets up at the start of service and sings that and i thought thank you lord a little confirmation tapped into the same spirit amen not an idea of man like hey you do this and i'll do that and everybody will think something's working together amen but to know god's movement let's just stand and worship him for a minute before we go today oh saints we love him you know look if i come across a little direct saints just realized i want to see you in a rapture and the very word selfish motive here what do you think of a preacher with a selfish motive the very word that would put you in a rapture will put me in a rapture hallelujah so this is not just you being preached at the preacher is being preached at because the preacher wants to be in a rapture also hallelujah he hi [Music] come on brother chad have since washed oh aren't you glad this morning been washed from his memory by the glory [Music] i know he has forgiven me my sins have

mind made up right and i'm not going to turn back i've got my heart fixed on the word of god which is the only way it can be fixed right is on the word amen and i'm going to go with jesus all the way
