if he did well he just heard it twice so that's okay amen let's open our Bibles to Acts chapter N9 we are in uh the book of Acts part 4 Acts chapter n chapter 9 verse 8 and Saul arose from the earth and when his eyes were opened he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus and he and he was three days without sight neither did he eat nor drink and there was a certain disciple at Damascus named ananas and to him said the Lord in a vision ananas and he said behold I am here Lord and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straet and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of tarus for behold he prayeth and hath seen in a vision a man named ananas coming in putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight then ananas answered Lord I have heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to thy Saints at Jerusalem and there he hath Authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and the king and Kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake and ananas went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother Saul the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou comest hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight forth with and arose and was baptized when he received meat he was strengthened then was Saul certain days with the disciples which are at Damascus amen let's bow our heads Gans 7 father Lord we have one desire and one desire

with you now that we have set aside may we not waste it Lord but may we give it to you Lord for the glory of God we pray we love you Lord and thank you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated tonight praise the [Applause] Lord so my title tonight is do you remember Grace we uh spoke last Wednesday uh the book of Acts part three we talked about Paul and his conversion on the road to Damascus and um how that we are called once we have seen the light and heard the voice we are called to be bearers of the light and so I wanted to pick up again here at Paul's conversion because the Lord tells ananas to go go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles so Paul's uh Ministry was to go to the Gentiles but and that right there is the grace of God because the Jews were God's people his his uh little Benjamin his brothers Israel and that's where that's where the Lord came down he didn't come down to the Gentiles he came down to the Jews but for the grace of God he blinded their eyes so that we could see the truth and that right there is race and um that transition that he made there from the law into the dispensation of Grace he did so amen under grace because he gave us his message that was for the Jews but their eyes were blinded regardless they turned it down and uh we see that Paul was given the ministry to go to the Gentiles and that that was a a message of Grace and so remember that and we'll read this quote it's a little lengthy lengthy but that's okay um or I hope it's okay with yall 1954 the law having a shadow but R says then I thought well I'll find I looked across there and I said there's a place that's a restaurant just an ordinary place and I walked across there and this is shocking brother when as soon as I walked in the door there was a policeman standing there with his arm around a woman playing a slot machine gamblings illegal in Ohio and there was the law that's supposed to uphold righteousness gambling himself and he was a man as old as I am so he must have been married and had a wife somewhere else what a disgrace I looked back there and there was a young lady at the table waiting on some boys and they was all drunk and the way that young lady was acting letting them employ boys act to her it was a disgrace and I thought look you there if it isn't from Paradise into a rat Den almost he's um in between services on Sunday getting some lunch and he says listen let me tell you don't you worry about Russia coming over here and whipping the United States don't you worry about some Nation coming over here to whip on us we're whipping ourselves all morals is breaking down yes it isn't the robin that pecks on the Apple that hurts it it's the worm at the core that kills the apples that's what gets the apples so it isn't some other Nation it's our own self communism is not Russia communism is a spirit amen a little further down he goes on to say but notice this woman when she was sitting over there at that table that young woman I thought oh my and I looked over here and seen an old fellow sitting there and there said two fellows drunk one with a great big long Army Overcoat on and a dear old mother sitting there old enough to be my grandmother and the clothes that the woman had on little bitty short clothes and her poor poor old wrinkled arms and flesh and she had on this here manicure orever what you call it on her lips you know with that I know it's that's not the right stuff I can't ever what it what it is it's paint and she had it all over her lips like this and it was blue was blue looking you know and she had it and I looked at the poor old thing and she was sitting there with a cigarette smoking it and I looked and I thought oh my and two old men I said God why don't you just strike this thing off and just wipe it off the map you will be disgusted as well especially on Sunday you walk in and you see this you see this display of sin and your first reaction is to say these people are disgusting that's what's going through brother br's mind basically you would experience the same thing you do experience the same thing when you go and you say these people are disgusting this is gross what these people are doing but watch what God does and you all know the story so just slow down if me a sinner he said could look and just despise such as that how can your great Holiness look at such a thing as that and stand it I thought oh God my little Rebecca and Sarah are going to have to come up here one eight and the other 1 three I thought how they going to come up here and see such as that what will it be in the in their day God why don't you just clean the thing up imagine what our what my kids are seeing amen I don't need to go into and explain it and then God taught me a lesson ain't he faithful yeah to do so we get a thinking in our own heads we're you know some big idea some big revelation we have and God comes along to teach us the lesson that's right you know the two men got up and went to the restroom and I was standing there looking around and I thought oh god look here what is it nobody yet waited on me I was just standing at the door looking around kind of dark back towards the door and the Holy Spirit said to me come over here and I went over and as I sat down see it's important to be sensitive to the moving of the holy spirit that still Small Voice in your heart being aware of it and being having the confidence to act upon it amen I I uh I myself have missed opportunities because I didn't have confidence that what I was what what was being ministered to my heart was not just my own idea or my own feeling but being in tune with God's moving of his spirit amen and doing what he asked you to do regardless of how awkward it may seem at the time and I saw and I went over and as I sat down I looked and I saw like the world and it was revolving around and around this world was a rainbow looked like a streak of red like a rainbow going around and around the world and then I went right into that and when I was standing there in that I looked and I seen somebody standing just above it with his arms out like this probably like this and it was our Lord and I noticed myself every time I go do something wrong just then according to Grace according to the word the father would have took my life right there but Christ every time I would do a sin then it would and he hits the pulpit it would hit him like that he'd shake his head like that in other words his blood was acting like a bumper on the automobile it was protecting me from death and I thought oh I see it I seen it come again and there was an old book laying out there and my name written at the top and it was a sinner's book smutted up amen I don't feel read to lead the read the entire quote if you want to go back you can but the Lord shows him that the blood his mistakes are going up and hitting the blood and he says and and and he looked back at me and say father forgive him and then I'd go along and do something else and there it would come again like that he'd say father forgive him I thought oh I see if that's the reason God can't take the life of those people Sinners because they are yet protected they have a chance yet the blood of Jesus is still protecting them and then I seen him as my sins kept beating him I got so broken hard and I come crawling up to him I laid down like this I said Lord look at my name up there I said is that my name he said yes that's your name amen is your name on the Lamb's Book of Life Tonight by God's grace I said God forgive me I didn't mean to make you suffer like that says please forgive me he took his hand in his side like that and rode across there pardoned he said now I forgive you but you want to condemn her right Amen in this moment that brother bradam was standing there God had to remind him of Grace Grace is the blood of Jesus Christ shed for your sins to bring you protection here on Earth God had to remind him of Grace you say the prophet yes the prophet God had to remind him so how much more amen do we need to be in remembrance of Grace and he said he says then that made things different I come out of the vision I looked over there that poor old woman sitting there toddling now he says that poor old woman amen he doesn't describe how gross and how disgusting now it's a that poor woman just toddling like that I said Lord God please forgive me I'll not be critical anymore I walked over to where she was and I said how do you do he sat down and he talked with her first he was ready to condemn her ready to have God strike her dead but then God showed him God said let come here son let me REM remind you of Grace let me remind you of the grace of God that I even is is shed over you is put over you on the daily basis that you live even you are making mistakes and that's going up and covering by the blood of Jesus Christ and you're ready to condemn her and what sometimes what happens is we can forget about God's grace we can get to a place where we're we're comfortable doing church and we're comfortable we don't have anything big in our lives we don't have any this any that well what happened is you may not need to be delivered from smoking you may not need to be delivered from lust you may not need to be delivered from carousing and going out in the world but you needed to be delivered from self-righteousness you need to be you need to be reminded of God's grace and reminded that the grace that God gave to you is still available to every living soul that is out there around us amen do you remember Grace and so he he sits down he talks to her and he in in that moment he he extends the grace of God to her and he and he begins to talk to her you know what what is what is he starts the conversation what basically what is wrong with your life and she told him the whole story you know she was she was cast out and all these things happened everything and he led her to the Lord right there not because he went up there and tried to correct her for her sin they would have chased him out or she would have slapped him in the face because that's not what God did to you God didn't come up there with a stick ready to smack you upside the head because you were sinning he said Son let me tell you about my grace he said daughter let me tell you about my grace that I have for you and at the same time you need to remember Grace because you've got a self-righteous attitude and you and you can tend to think maybe not even realizing that you're better than the next person but you can also need to be reminded of Grace because you beat yourself down too much and you forget that God's grace covers your sins you are no longer a sinner having received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you stand in confidence you stand shadowed by Grace you stand shadowed by the blood of Jesus Christ and your name is written on the Lamb's Book of Life the remembrance of things that you have done wrong where does that come from I come straight from the pits of Hell God doesn't remember it it's forever put in the sea of God's forgetfulness roten off washed away amen by the bleach the blood of Jesus Christ amen do you remember Gra we can read about another man in the book here in Jonah 3 some of you can quote the story and the word of the Lord came under Jonah the second time Jonah gone down into the well Belly of the fish I always want to say that backwards but arise and go un n Nineveh that great City and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee so Jonah arose and went unto Nineveh according to the word of the Lord now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of 3 days journey and Jonah began to enter into the city a Day's Journey so to go from one end of the city to the other on foot took three days and Jonah began to enter this into the city a day journey and he cried and said yet 40 days in Nineveh shall be overthrown so the people of Nineveh believed God and proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth from the Great of them even to the least of them would you imagine an entire city of six six score thousand so I don't know 12 12,000 120,000 something like that correct my math but it was a lot uh you walk down the streets preaching and the entire city begins to repent and that's what happened you think wow a Revival miracle but let's see what happens here to Jonah and for word came unto the king of Nineveh and he rose from his throne and laid his robe from him and covered him with sackcloth and sat in ashes and he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his Noble saying let neither man nor Beast herd nor flock taste anything let them not feed nor drink water but let man and Beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto God when as far as to put sackcloth and Ashes on their cattle on their cows let them turn everyone from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands who can tell if God will turn and repent and turn away from his Fierce anger that we perish not and God saw their works that they turned from their evil way and God repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto them and he did it not there's still walls of Nineveh standing to this day there was a the big gate but Isis Isis blew it up but there's walls still there that you can see amen perhaps a reminder to Iraq that God's truth is still alive but it displeased Jonah exceedingly and he was very angry what imagine a preacher in in our time preaching a power sermon and the altar full of people repenting and he storms off in anger that's what Jonah did he stormed off in Anger first of all Jonah was a backsliding preacher so brother R calls him he went running off the tares he says I ain't going to go to Nineveh Nineveh had a reputation that was you know like like Las Vegas right I've driven through Las Vegas a few times I'd rather drive around it right that's how Nineveh was and um so did uh do you want to go walking down the streets of Las Vegas saying repent not unless God God told you to and even then Jonah ran right so who knows you don't know until you walked a mile in their moccasins as the saying goes so Jonah says forget this I'm not following the word of the Lord I'm going to Tarsus gets on a ship I think get funny he's got to run from the presence of the Lord sometimes we get crazy ideas in our heads and God has to teach us the lesson so Jonah goes off now now God um God knows and God works things out and and if he if if you will if you permit me to take a little side step here when Jonah's on the boat and the the storm comes up and tosses the ship back in forth and and and um I'm talking like this ship's about about to sink and you have all these Sailors on the ship and they're all praying to their gods it says and um they they they finally get everyone together and they cast lots and the lot falls on Jonah and Jonah tells him his testimony and then they begin to call on the Lord God the Bible says and then when they threw Jonah in the water they sacrificed it says they sacrificed to the Lord and made vows in other words they gave their heart to God so how do we know that that Jonah's desire to to to not to go against God's will wasn't actually God's will to bring those Sailors the message you never know amen praise the Lord and so you see another display of God's grace so Jonah had had had this thought in his head that he was doing what he was wanting to do but God was writing a story of Grace the sailors received the message and then we know that that uh the Nineveh believed in the fish God and here Jonah comes walking out of fish so God has a way of doing things that is entirely different to ours so don't ever look amen do you remember Grace don't look at somebody and judge them for what they're doing CU you don't know God might be working the whole thing out to his will and so so here's Jonah he says you know what toss me overboard right he he's coming into a it takes a humble and a broken Spirit to say it's my fault toss me overboard that's the last thing last place you want to go on a storm because it's um what's the word it's uh um you're going to die there's no there's no U untruth about it you're going to if you're going overboard you're dying so they fought the sailors fought to prevent it and to to to hold the ship but they couldn't so they finally threw him overboard and and um so Jonah sinks down and fish a fish the Bible says swallows him up so now you have Jonah and a fish and he's thinking you know what that was probably not the greatest idea I ever had to uh try to run from the presence of God and so he he takes and this is the best thing you can do when you find yourself in the belly of a fish apply God's word to your life brother BR says it's 180° shift right you just go the other way if you find yourself in wrong you turn around and go the other way did you know that if you're going uh the Bible says your sins are gone as far as the East is from the West did you know if you're going West and you want to go East all you have to do is turn around you don't have to go find East and you can go east for as long as you want and never ever find West unless you turn around that's right that's why brother that's why you can't look back behind you don't look back to those sins that are as far as the East is from the West because East never connects to the West in that sense right you go east as long as you can you're never ever going to come West but anyway so here Jonah and he turns toward the temple best he could guess and he prays and God pro keeps him alive for three days am me a type of Christ three days in the ground and he brings him out and then he tells him again okay Jonah go to Nineveh so now Jonah just experienced a uh um a tremendous testimony of God's grace he was given a second chance he was given another chance to go do what God had origin originally told him to do and he walks into the city this is funny how sometimes you know it's like that story um in the Bible the the the man he's he's given a chance he says hey look Lord uh king or whatever just give me a chance I'll get the money and I'll pay it back and then a c and so he says okay your debts are forgiven and then a servant comes to that man and says please just give me some more time and he says no put him in prison he was extended Grace but he didn't turn around and extend that Grace that he was given how can God forgive you your sins if you won't forgive your brother their trespasses the Bible says so what happens is you turn Grace into disgrace and so here's Jonah and he's walking out and he's just like the man giv another chance forgiven of his debts and he goes into Nineveh and he preaches the message that God had given him and then when the people begin to repent he gets upset why why is he not extending that same Grace he was given in the belly of the fish right to the people of nin Nineveh you would think well what happened in that short time Jonah forgot about Grace so he had to be reminded of it and oh ain't that the truth God will remind you the devil will remind you but the devil has a perversion of what God does and the devil doesn't have guess what the devil has no original idea he's a parrot but he twists it to his own gain and he makes it evil makes good evil so God is going to put Jonah in remembrance he's going to teach Jonah a lesson and so um but it displeased Jonah we're in chapter 4 if you're reading along but it displeased Jonah exceedingly and he was very angry and he prayed unto the Lord and said I pray thee Oh Lord was this was not this my saying when I yet in my country in other words which is funny when he's in Israel he said he knew God was going to forgive him but yet he didn't want to go therefore he said what I when I was yet in my country therefore I have fled before unto Tarsus for I knew that thou are a gracious God and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repentance thee of evil there now oh Lord take I beseech thee my life from me for it is better for me to die than to live you see there was in the natural Jonah was coming off of what's called inspiration so he was experiencing a moment of melancholy is what it's called Uh you pray for preachers they they go through that same thing Thursday morning after you're preaching is the worst morning of the week I don't say that to make you feel bad for me or trying to make myself special I'm just saying that's the fact so here's Jonah just in a a Revival preaching you know under the inspiration and then the inspiration goes away and he's like why are all you Wicked people repenting you need to be struck dead and so I can't stand this so he goes outside of the city to sit on a hill to watch God's judgment come and he says I didn't want to go to Tarsus Lord you ever you ever just you ever just vent to God In Prayer just I don't understand and so here's Jonah I I knew it he said I knew it God I knew that's why I didn't want to go here because I knew you'd forgive these Wicked people who need to die you're either thinking of yourself or somebody else you know that's the attitude we get sometimes because we forget about Grace we forget what God's done for us and we want to pass judgment on people and we want to seal their faith and we want to say you know we see that that gay dude in in Starbucks or that gay woman and we just want to just oh they're disgusting I can't even yes their sin is disgusting but that's a lost soul in need of Jesus Christ how will you conduct yourself don't condone their sin amen stand up and tell them the truth but there's a way to do it in the love of God you can say the same words but if your attitude isn't an attitude of Grace they're going to catch on to it because all of that is going on in the spiritual realm amen I've seen it done both ways in a way of an actual Love Of Christ expressed and the people receive it they don't get upset even though they know you disagree with them and then you see it the same thing happen in an attitude of aggression one of Flesh because they're upset this person is sinning and just creates an argument and that person what who knows where they go so it's all in in in in your heart that's what it comes down to amen cuz everything in life that we deal with in with people is not a condition of the flesh it's a condition of your heart that's right cuz if it was the condition of the flesh we would not be called Sons and Daughters of God but God looks at our heart that he is change and he says you know what the outside don't look right yet but it's coming from the inside out just like a worm ruins an apple the presence of God in your life fixes the apple and so Jonah gets upset so Jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city and there made him a booth and sat under it in the shadow till he might see what would become of the city and the Lord God prepared a gourd and made it to come up over Jonah that he might be a shadow over his head to deliver him from his grief so Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd one of my titles I had before I came up with this one was was uh sitting on under a gourd so maybe you find yourself sitting under a gourd tonight well just join up with Jonah but God prepared a worm when the morning Rose the next day and it smoke the gour that it withered and it came to pass when the sun did arise that God prepared a vinant East Wind and the Sun Beat upon the head of Jonah you know I wonder how many times uh one day comes to mind I was working in Phoenix landscaping and it was uh just about 120 it was like 115 I wonder sometimes those days you have is not just the Lord teaching you a lesson right you just think it's a bad day but maybe the Lord's trying to show you something um praise the Lord and the son beat upon the head of Jonah that he fainted and wished in himself to die and said it is better for me to die than to live and God said to Jonah dust thou well to be angry for the gourd you're right you should be mad about the gourd and he said I do well to be angry even to death so God says to Jonah you you you you should be mad at the gour and Jonah says I am I'm mad at the gour that the gourd died then said the Lord see ah the Lord is just well he's all knowing so he knows how to do this stuff but he just he pulls in right he comes alongside Jonah says you're mad huh you're mad about the gour Jonah's like yeah I'm mad about the gour and then there's this there's this softness of his heart right even though he's upset there's this connection to God right God understands and then God says Thou Hast had pity on the G for the which thou Hast not labored J's like yeah I didn't even he says neither made a thck grow which came up in a night and perished in a night yeah and should not I spare Nineveh that great City wherein are more than six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand and also much cattle and that's the end of the book you know why Jonah learned his lesson Jonah remembered Grace and he went back down into the city we don't know anymore about Jonah he briefly mentioned in the book of Kings if it's the same man same name same father um but we know don't know much more about Jonah so perhaps Jonah went down into Nineveh and he preaches his first sermon to the new church of Nineveh and he says my title this morning is the grace of God and he talks about how you know he he went to run away from bringing them the message and he went to run away from preaching I tried to do that once don't ever do that and and he come back and he and he says you know what I sat on the hill and I wished God judgment upon you I wish all of you for your wickedness would have died I wish you would have been all destroyed but see God brought up this gourd it gave me some shade and then it died and I got really mad and then God reminded me you cared about that gourd that gave you shade and you had pity upon it that you did nothing to bring it up what about the people of Nineveh how much more important are they to you that I have come and I have risen up and I have given a second chance and he says so you know don't forget about God's grace amen so this is do you remember Grace part two Jo uncovered part one so praise the Lord instead of Min ministering to those people for 40 days being with them helping them he stood back to watch their judgment sometimes I get ahead of my notes forget I have notes Here praise the Lord now the same thing happened to brother brandham in um 1963 or in the message standing in the Gap right and these Ricky and ricettas have so sased the words and I've called them Ricky and Retta God give me to understand I shouldn't do that because that's many of them are still his children right I was listening to a brother actually it was brother Shawn Martin preaching uh back it was a few years ago and I was watching it as I was working and um he says preachers sometimes he says men sometimes take message and want to preach people into Bond and tell them how bad of a person they are and put them in prison he says we already know how bad we are we need to hear what God thinks about us so brother so the Lord is schooling the prophet here and he says you're calling these people Ricky and retas but they're my children but they yet they they're my children but they yet don't know it amen they can't help because they ask so different some of these old cold formal churches has got them in other words some of them cold formal churches have true Sons and Daughters of God that's denominations and that's those churches in the message same thing and there in much in in prison as Israel was he says formal churches has got them that Spirit upon them and they're in much in prison as Israel was in prison just as much as Moses went down to deliver them from slavery human beings that loved Jesus Christ would serve him if they only knew what to serve him by amen do you remember Grace and they are in bondage under denominationalism that tells them don't you do this and don't you do that amen the message he says the message won't denominate but I believe by prophetic Insight he's talking about the message churches yes denominationalism that tells them don't you do this and don't you do that nobody's going to you're going to get a bunch of people that are conforming and they're doing it and those that stag just because because they have greater self-discipline or there's just they're fine with living two lives rather let's preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ which is the power of God unto salvation we don't need we don't need to stand up here and and and put you behind bars cuz you're such a bad person or pray that God's judgment comes upon you because you're acting like a Nineveh Neva ninevite whatever a person of Nineveh we need to preach to you the Gospel of Jesus Christ which is the power of God unto salvation which is Paul's message Paul had to deal with a lot of starchy stuck up Jews he had to deal with a lot of problem churches that's why I believe he had the greatest experience of God's grace he was killing Christians having them put in prison having them beat and then God turns his life around and gives him makes has him be the first church age messenger wow God's grace there's there's there's there's Sons and Daughters of God who have been to prison for murder and now are are children of the king well they always were they just didn't know it amen you say God's grace is not amen there is nothing too great for the grace of God that's right nothing too great for the love of God but the call of God must come whoever wants to March towards the promised land let him March we're on our road to the promised land amen let them come I know people who quit young people who quit going to church because they thought they were sitting there hindering the church and that it would be better if they just left because of what the preacher said that's right let me ask you a question is that God's grace I don't care what kind of life you're living sit in that Pew come to church amen there's certain situations if you don't want to you don't have to but if you want to be here and you just can't get your life straightened out come God will straighten it out we have testimonies in this Church of God doing that very thing amen amen I remember a testimony of of a couple of of young men who were were young men and they went to go to a uh some of you will know him I'm not going to name them um to a youth camp and the Pastor said no they're not allowed to come here that's how bad off they were and they didn't want to be there they had bad attitudes but yet God took them see you look right now at some young person or you look right now at some old person older person and you see their life and you say what you can't see 20 years 10 years 15 years down the road and see what God's going to turn their life around to be both those guys are now preachers of the Gospel amen praise the Lord that was I don't know where we were going with that one there but amen you never no we don't we want to preach the gun barrel straight gospel we're not going to conform we're not going to be Hypocrites we're not going to water it down but guess what we're going to do it under God's grace amen and underneath the inspiration of the Holy Ghost because God has given every single one of you an opportunity and who are we to say that you've lost that opportunity we're not going to know till the end of time Moses okay so he says but the call of God must come let him March okay we're on a road to the promised land let them come March we're on a road to meet Christ at the end time and I wanted to bring this to you so that you would see and show you that the mistake that a man can make yet being sincere Moses lost the feeling of his people because they wouldn't listen to him and brother Roy you see your dream now I cannot go with a Ministry like that until I feel different in my heart about it no matter if God didn't did tell me but that is that change that brother Roy that scene coming something's got to change me because I in my heart if I go out there feeling the way I do now I still feel that way ought to have heard that message in other words he preached the seals and he's saying these PE he got upset because they they have should have heard the message and they didn't they didn't catch it and he and he's losing the feeling for the people they ought to have done it he says and I don't have the feeling for the people that I should have until I can get that feeling there is no need in me going because I'd be a hypocrite and all these years I've tried to serve him with a true heart and I won't go out there being a hypocrite I got to feel that that isn't that I've got to feel that it isn't Ricky and Retta and it isn't this Bunch it's God's children that's in bondage that I must go to until I can feel that way I'll just have to loaf around preach some conventions and things but wait in other words God had to bring him aside and said do you remember Grace he had to come aside and and you forgive me I don't remember the details or how long he was off the field or if it was just a short time but God gave him that feeling for the people back um and and because do you remember Grace right we can't forget about God's grace we we have we can't forget that the only reason you're here isn't because of your doing right it's because sorry if I keep fiddling with this it's coming off my ear isn't because of what you did that's right it ain't your pride no that's what happened with the Jews and we're going to read that here but the Jews right and this is this is this is an interesting thing because you see this sometimes I mean people like you amen necessarily you but oh you know they take the they take the truth of we are the elect of God and pervert it into we are better than them that's right and then there's no feeling for the people that's right there's no way to extend God's grace and there's no way to share the truth with them if that's how you feel about it and so that's what happened the Jews they were the Jews those Gentiles what are they doing when the when the when the gospel went to the Gentiles there was a big Council all the apostles right all the big men got together you know they need to be circumcised Paul says whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa hold on a second here what are we preaching are we preaching the law or are we preaching the grace of God Amen what do they need to be circumcised In the Flesh when God now circumcises the heart that's right and they by God's grace figured it out but then he went he goes to he goes to uh well we'll read it you know what we're just going to skip ahead then we'll skip back Acts chapter 13 uh if you want to turn there you don't have to Acts chapter 13 excuse me verse uh 42 so Paul uh is is um partnered up with Barnabas and he goes out to Antioch I believe it is and he begins to preach and and when the Jews were gone out and and then they they they go to the synagogue they read the Scrolls and then the Jews there and they say Hey you know brother Paul or Saul at that point I think no Paul you have do you have any words to say so they get up and they preach okay oh wow brother Paul that was good verse 42 when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath so they weren't allowed to partake of the service if I read this correctly forgive me if I didn't and so they say hey preach to us next Sabbath now when the congregation was broken up many of the Jews and relig religious prelit followed Paul and Barnabas who speaking to them persuaded them to continue in the grace of God wow Brothers we enjoyed that amen continue in the grace of God yes amen right these Jews okay and the next Sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God and when the Jews saw the multitudes they were filled with Envy jealousy and spake against those things which are spoken by Paul contradicting and blaspheming wait a second it was brother Paul and brother Barnabas last week now when they're preaching to those Gentiles it's Paul and Barnabas not brother you know some people do that right they don't call him brother brandom anymore he's brandom interesting anyways I'm not going to get on that and they and they they turn against this right they were stuck up it was for them and them only that's for and no more and then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold see there's a time to stand up and be bold all in God's in God's grace and it was necessary he said Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourself Unworthy of everlasting life low we turn to the Gentiles wait and judge yourselves unworthy they judged themselves in their Pious self-righteousness they cast judgment upon themselves God help us to remember Grace not to become Pious and self-righteous and uh praise the Lord for so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou should us be for salvation unto the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed and the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region and the Jews here we go stirred up The Devout and honorable women and the chief men of the city and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them out of their Coast but they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came unto Iconium and the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost they shook their feet said we go to the Gentiles they gave them the chance God in his grace even though Paul was called the Gentiles still gave the Jews a chance amen underneath his ministry all those Jew he would have still gone to the Gentiles but those Jews could have accepted the truth but they turned it down because they thought they had it all figured out amen how many how many how many times have we thought we had it all figured out and we miss missed the moving of the Holy Spirit how many times have we' been sitting in church and and and the spirit of God moves but you know we've been message Believers for years we can't go to the altar there's a time to grow out of that I'm sorry there's is's not of time to grow out of that but Brown the story say was one of the first ones to the altar if there was an altar call now unless God leads you you don't have to go but don't sit there starchy right don't get starchy loosen up we all need to loosen up I need to loosen up I was watching uh uh the choir for brother Tim puit church singing if you watch any of the service it's common there and this sister gets off the choir stand and starts running the aisles and I was like man I am I'm starchy it makes me nervous but we got to just we got to loosen up amen you know why you don't raise your hands or worship God and put your enthusiasm into it because of your pride because we have pride I don't want to be negative forgive me Lord we got to remember it's the grace of God you remember God's grace and what he did for you you're going to get excited if you but if you're just coming to church cuz it's time to come to church just take a moment and say where was I before God found me where was I before I fell off the ship on the way to Tartus and got swallowed up by a fish where was I wow God your grace is marvelous it's Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a Wretch like Me amen I once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I see and you remember God's see I can't stop smiling you remember God's grace and what he's done for you boy you're going to look out Sunday morning hey guess what Sunday morning is Easter the rest of the week remind yourself of God's grace in your life everywhere you look say you know what if it wasn't for the grace of God you see somebody walking down the street you say now be careful you don't say therefore before the grace of God go why you go wow God thank you for your grace they need to know about Jesus that's how you do that praise the Lord and then you come to church guess what we ain't gonna be able to hold the roof down amen praise God so and the disciples are filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost so Paul goes on to the Gentiles so the message was for the Jews but God's grace brought it to you now we're going to go read another story in the book of Acts because that's what we're on right now careful what you name a series you probably will never leave because the book of Acts I mean anything fits underneath that no it's all by the leading of the Holy Spirit if you forgive me uh chapter 10:23 if you want to turn there then called he them in and lodged them and on the tomorrow Peter went away with them and certain Brethren from japa accompanied him so the Jews were raised up they couldn't eat certain Meats they couldn't eat certain things because it was unclean God shows Peter a vision as he's in the vision seeing the food come down and God saying partake there's two men knocking at the door bringing coming to take Peter to this Roman Centurion Cornelius so he says come inside spend the night then we'll go tomorrow and the tomorrow after they entered into cesaria and Cornelius waited for them and had called together his Kinsmen and near friends and as Peter was coming in Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him but Peter took him up saying stand up I myself also in a man amen we still have that in our day people worshiping a man Y and that man never condemning it God help us not to get that way God help us not to lift men up cuz it's not about me it's not about Brother David it's not about our pastor I don't care to name any brother in the message you want who's a preacher or a pastor it's not about them they're no special more more special than you and if they think they are watch out God's going to bring them back down because they are God's servant that's why I pray the Lord always keep me humble but then when you pray for humility it seems like it's like praying for patience praise the Lord and Cornelius waited for them okay verse 26 but Peter took him up saying stand up by myself also in a man and as he talked with him he went in and found many that were come together and he said unto them you know how that it is unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company or come unto one of another Nation but God ha showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean therefore came I unto you without gain saying as soon as I was sent for I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me okay so hey God showed me a a vision I'm not supposed to be here but God show me a vision and by his word I've come into your house contrary to everything I was taught contrary to everything I was made to think about things but because of God's grace coming down now I can stand in your house and talk to you so what what do you have need of called into the house of the enemy the Romans what the Zealot the zealots the Jews the crazy used even Peter himself upset about was it paying taxes or something like that amen Peter used to have a in his heart towards the Romans the the soldiers and now God's taking him says hey you need to go preach to this Roman Centurion I'll be like hey Sean you need to get a ticket and go speak to the head of the Taliban couple Isis dudes come or they're not I knew couple ISIS studes come knock on your door you come with us right God shows you right God God you're going to know what God's will is when in situations like that but that's what it would be like right anyways okay here we go so um and cor Cornelius says well four days ago I was fasting until this hour and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house so he he was a Godly Man already and and behold a man stood Before Me In Bright clothing and said Cornelius thy prayer is heard and thy alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God send therefore to japa and call hither Simon whose sirname is Peter he is lodged in the house of one Simon a Tanner by the seaside who when he cometh shall speak unto thee immediately therefore I sent to thee and thou Hast well done that thou art come now therefore are we all here present before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of God talk about being in season and out of season so you're here preach to us then Peter opened his mouth and said of a truth I perceive that God is no respector of persons doesn't matter who you are where you come from what you're doing God can use you and change you but in every nation he that fearth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him in other words Jew Gentile Samarian Samar Samaritan cross doesn't matter god um is it there any those are all accepted of God the word which God sent unto the children of Israel preaching Peace by Jesus Christ he is Lord of all that word I say you know which was published throughout all Judea and began From Galilee after the baptism of John preach everybody knew about Jesus in that area how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that world pressed of the devil for God was with him and we Are Witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree him God raised up the third day and showed him openly not to all the people but unto Witnesses chosen before of God even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead and he commanded us to preach un the people so he continues to preach on for they heard okay excuse me for they heard them speak with tongues magnifying God then answered Peter can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we and Comm he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord then prayed then then prayed they him to ter certain days so the grace of God brings the message to a Roman Centurion and member of the known enemy another story in the book of Acts another example another remembrance of who what we are called to do as children of God is to follow God's calling follow God's will amen and keep in our hearts the remembrance of Grace to be reminded of these things to put your mind in remembrance of these things that the musicians want to come tonight amen do you remember Grace next time you feel a judgmental towards somebody who probably deserves it remember Grace he I got oh four fingers pointing back at me I needed to hear this tonight amen I mean God forgive me for the times I judge people because they're not lining up with the word of God right now but I needed Grace and they do too amen do I disagree with them yes will I follow them will I go along with them no CU it's contrary to the word of God but I'm not going to judge them I'm going to say Lord help them forgive them show them truth show them Revelation and give them Grace because I believe in my heart that they are still children of God whether or not their life at the point at this moment in time lines up with God's word I can't see their heart I can't see the future but God can Lord let me be in remembrance of Grace to extend to them H to them the love of God the love of Christ this this ties in very closely with last Wednesday Wednesday to be a light bearer to be a true bearer of the light you have to remember God's Grace you have to know that it was God's grace that put you where you are and it's God's grace that you go forward every single day because that fast everything can come crashing down around you we don't worry about that because we know that God is in control but it is God's grace that has you where you are it is God's grace that you are here in this church it is God's grace that you were brought here amen that God had God foreordained you for this moment amen amen it's and this is those young the youth that made it into Camp it's God's grace that that happened you better be expecting because God didn't do that just for you to have fun God did that for a reason and you're going to watch you're going to watch God do great things every day your life you go to bed at night it was God's grace you live through another day it keeps you humble and when you're humble God can use you also when the devil tries to bring up your past remind him of Grace say I'm sorry that doesn't exist anymore CU God's Grace washed me of that and by God's grace I'm going to continue forward amen do you remember Grace amen let's bow our heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord you are great and you are so [Music] gracious thank you Lord Jesus help us Lord to stay soft I guess that's what we're trying to say tonight is when we are in remembrance of Grace our spirit stays soft keep us humble Lord remember that we have one thing and that is to sh to Bear the Light of Christ to the world father and if we get proud and we get lifted up we become uneffective ineffective can't use us cuz our flesh is in the way but when we remember Grace and we're in remembrance Lord that you brought us here and it's you that's going to take us home father then we can be humble and we can know that it's all up to you Lord and father you can use us whether that's to witness to the guy in the corner Lord or witness to the coworker or father witness to those who call themselves message Believers but have never

disciples over 2,000 years ago father Lord in a couple of days Lord Jesus you would be hung on the cross for our sins God if that ain't Grace I don't know what is amen we put you there our sins put you on the cross the devil would like us to to end the story there but as it seems to circulated every every year father that preacher said but Sunday's coming Lord and Sunday came and you you rose from the dead and with that Resurrection came a revelation father in our day Lord Jesus Through the Ages that went by was buried in the ground but Lord the full truth and revelation of who you are

we thank you Lord Jesus be with us now each one we pray in Jesus name amen amen every time you turn on the tape you're reminded of God's grace a revelation of everything that everyone wanted to know about but couldn't because it wasn't time yet you were given in your in your language for most of us in our language amen but God Will Make A Way can we sing that song God Will Make A Way actually you know what can we sing Amazing Grace you know I didn't even get to it I had the story of John Newton if you haven't read that story in a while go read that amen talk about administering major suffering to your kind your own kind those slaves and those ships yet God turned his life around there's some great men of God and there's it it's I don't have the words sometimes to describe when I'm thinking there's a direct correlation to men have who have gone through horrible things and received God's grace to their effective Effectiveness in the ministry whether they're preachers or not they say John Newton's Ministry was so powerful they they never had room for everybody constantly he and incidentally he was actually in the time of John Wesley the the churches they they couldn't hold it in the churches every time he preached it just packed out because he had experienced a great measure of God's grace amen praise the Lord oh maying Grace how sweet the sound oh that [Music] sa like me why
