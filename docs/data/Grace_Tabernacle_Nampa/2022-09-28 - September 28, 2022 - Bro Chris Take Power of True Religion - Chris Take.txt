amen if you have your Bibles turn to John chapter eight thank you musicians John chapter eight and stand with me this evening it's good to be in the house of God you know well we'll read the scripture here and we'll pray but sorry talk louder foreign we uh I was told you to talk a little bit louder when I first start because then I started preaching and it blows the speakers out so um but uh tonight's Wednesday night and um sometimes we come we come on Wednesday night and uh even myself we come with our expectations a little bit too small and uh that's to be expected you spent all day thinking about the world and dealing with the Mammon and the money and all of that stuff and now to come tonight so I just want to challenge you or read the scripture and we'll pray but challenge you to really ask yourself why you are here tonight we know the obvious reason you have a desire to grow closer to God but why are you here tonight John chapter 8. now we might come back to John 8 I'm not entirely sure I'd read the whole chapter if I could but um you go home and you read it we're going to pick it apart tonight uh John chapter 8 verse one Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them and the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst they say unto him Master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act now Moses and the law commanded us that we should be stoned but what sayeth thou this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not I'm sure that just frosted their cake they were expecting an argument and when someone comes and they expect an argument and you give them them it kind of deflates them so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst when Jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned him and she said no man Lord and Jesus said unto her neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more that's powerheads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we have a desire tonight to hear from Heaven Lord to hear from from you father nobody wants to hear from Chris tonight we want to hear from you I want to hear from you Lord so I pray you'd harness this flesh Lord harness this vessel to do your will father to do your bidding and may you speak to our hearts tonight though we lay ourselves at your feet we surrender to you Lord and we ask that you would come Lord many times on a Wednesday nights Lord we're tired but God I pray Lord that you would bring a special anointing Lord that upon your people Lord Jesus and that you would speak to their hearts Lord Jesus whether there's an outward expression I don't really care Lord but I won't and that inward expression Lord that abundance of life to swell within their hearts Lord Jesus father we need the strength we need to be fed tonight Lord we're coming to you and asking in your great Mercy father would you be gracious and speak to our hearts tonight we pray we love you Lord we thank you in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated tonight Maya my uh title tonight is of True Religion power of True Religion and we stopped in verse 11 here and we're going to go on to 12 and then spake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life now I've been I've been uh pondering a couple of different things lately and one of them is is religious spirits the other one is the power that Satan can hold over somebody when they have something in their life that's not taken care of that's right I wrestle between many different titles and this sermon it actually brought I just kind of keep a track as I go through life of sermon titles and notes to go with them and and I don't know if they'll ever turn to sermons or what will happen but this is a a bringing together of several different little one-liners that I put down and the one that was really on my heart and and just really stirs my soul is the thought of burning burning the devil's blackmail now when someone has blackmail over you that means that you've done something wrong that no one else knows about but you and that individual and they say you need to do this or I'll tell everybody what you did now when you have something in your life that you're keeping a secret that you're holding on that you're afraid to let go of afraid to surrender the devil can come along and say and hold that power over you but when you finally take care of that thing when you finally make that thing right or you repent or you finally go before God and and lay in full surrender you can take that piece of blackmail and set it in the fire the devil will come along and try to remind you of that thing again and say but I have the I you this you did this and but now he holds no more power over you because you've burned the devil's blackmail there's a couple of scriptures here in John chapter eight it's set at 8 32. ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free John 8 34 Jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you whosoever committed sin is the servant of sin so thinking on these things and then trying to find the Lord's Direction I just I've been drawn to this chapter in John for for quite a few days now just pondering and and uh a week or more and reading it over and over and over again it's it's a long chapter it's about 59 verses and if you're like me I needed some time to digest what I've read and and um if you're like me I I sometimes skim um I guess that's they call it the millennial skim but um I miss things all the time because I don't actually read it so sometimes you get in a chapter and you're in the morning and devotions and you begin to skim so you have to back up and start over again and I'll be honest with you tonight I don't exactly know everything that the Lord wants to pull from this chapter but I'm going to just lean into his will so if you if you start at the beginning of the chapter Jesus is preaching to a group of people he's on the Mount of Olives and and he's and he sat down and he's teaching them and in the middle of service the Pharisees and um the scribes bring they bust in the door and bring this woman they found committing adultery um this was all a setup no doubt they probably knew already knew this woman and her habits but they set it up to catch him in the to catch Jesus in this moment so they they interrupt the service and they they bring this woman and um in their righteous their arrogancy they had a religious spirit they bring her what say you let me tell you something Sin is Sin their iniquity their ability to see truth was just as much sin as that woman in adultery their sin was the spiritual fornication and yet they bring her in in in their arrogancy and they throw her down before him and uh the Lord in his perfect will and sovereignty just gives them a chance to fume and he says you without sin cast the first stone the Bible says the eldest to the youngest because the older you get hopefully the wiser you get and they realize they have no place to stand on now it seems a bit interesting a bit weird for me to take that and use that as as the power the devil has over you in this context but if you look at it if these men were not living in the position they were living in now bear with me they could have thrown the stone but if they had been living in the position they would have they should have been living and they would have never drugged her to the feet of Jesus but the Lord knew the sin in their life the Lord knew the position that they had that they were arrogant in their self-righteousness in their religious spirit turns me to Romans chapter 13. Romans 13. verse 11. thank you and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our Salvation nearer than when we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantingness not in strife and in being but put you on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not Provisions for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof verse 11 again and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now as our Salvation nearer than when we believed awake light you hide from the light if you're hiding something in your life and and if in whatever that thing may be unchecked can produce a bit of a religious spirit amen if you've buried it underneath reasoning brother Branham I have the I gave them the whole quote it's just it's really long but it's a story he's talking about when he's over in India and this blind man comes to him and he was given a vision that the blind man would stand before him and that his eyes would be open so God has given him Authority based upon the word and he can act upon that faith and so he begins to challenge the these uh muhammadans and sheikhs and jains and all of all of them he says I challenge you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to come give the man his sight if your religion's so great surely if there's somebody got to be right somebody's got to be wrong that's right don't never be afraid to put Christianity to a showdown God's real or he isn't God there's only one true religion and that's Christianity now you can't play it you've got to know what you're speaking of and you've got to know that God has told you to do it or it'll never work what's the one of the big does the the big divide between True Religion and false religion is the power of Christ one does not contain the power of Christ because it is the it is Antichrist religious spirit is Antichrist so he says you cannot you can't play with it and you've got to know what you're speaking of you got to know that God has told you to do it or it'll never work I wouldn't have said that for nothing if I hadn't have seen the vision that he was going to happen just like I imagine Elijah on Mount Carmel um he said so I'd seen there was a there was this man that was going to receive his side that said what would you do he said that he would serve the god that gives him back his sight so he asked the man what will he do and he said I'll serve the God who gives me back my sight so he puts the challenge and he says he said you muhammadans would tell him he was wrong and you Buddhas would tell them the holidays was wrong what would you do you'd only change his way of thinking thinking it's all intellectual no power no sight but no one they would not stop to say hey the man's still blind um it is not a coincidence that in this moment God used a blind man to show his power because what has God what was God's word underneath that that messenger coming to do bring sight to the religious blinding of the the eyes that were blinded spiritually so he challenged them and he says you know we got the same thing in America Baptist wants to make all the methodists Baptist and the Methodist wants to make all the Pentecostals methodists and Pentecostals wants to make them all Pentecostal it's just a change a way of thinking all psychology he said but we have one God we worship just different methods of worshiping I said but truly the real true Jehovah God who made the man and I say he was wrong he was a sun worshiper he worshiped the creation instead of the Creator that's true back to the real Creator let the real Creator give him back his sight so he can be of a benefit to him he said I challenge you all to come to the platform and give him his sight he says it was quieter than it isn't here now over 500 000 people you never heard they would just piled on each other as far as you could see one great dark mass of people I said why are you so quiet this afternoon he was telling how little Christianity was how powerless it was and how it was all broke up in different organizations I said now come let's see what your religion can do for him nobody said a word I said of course you don't because you can't now I mean human Muhammad didn't see there's all the muhammadan priests and all everybody's quiet the floor is open he says I'll believe on the god that you serve I say because you can't do it and neither can I but the god of Heaven who raised up his son Jesus Christ has sent his spirit and his spirit's working through his church he was in a position of power and authority because he was in the position of Christ there was nothing standing between him to come boldly with the word God had given him and stand and speak so therefore I would be the same but the Lord has showed me showed a vision that he's going to receive his sight now let the god that really is God speak they brought the man up close they don't interpret the prayer I said Lord God you're just as much God today as you ever was we could take lessons from the prayers that brother Branham spoke when he prayed for people in need this is what all he said Lord God you're just as much a God today as you ever was and you showed this Vision that the man would receive his sight now let the man receive his sight in the name of the Lord Jesus no more than said that and he let out a scream and grab me run up the mayor of the city was sitting there he grabbed him people began screaming that was the last meeting I could have in India they barely pulled him out of the out of the meeting he says what is it the same God that's and I love this line here the same God that always was always will be he's the same yesterday today and forever don't be afraid of Christianity But be sure you know what you're speaking of be sure that God has showed you and definitely told you if he tells you to do a thing don't you be afraid you go do it because God said to do it so that was a that was God the power of True Religion on display what is a religious spirit in Israel in the church number one 1953 but it says no the Antichrist spirit is so close like the real thing tell them to deceive the very elect if possible Jesus said so Matthew 24 it's a religious spirit oh why Cain and Abel were brothers The Crow and the dove sat on the same Roost Esau and Jacob Judah and Jesus preacher and Treasurer see they're always just the deceiving the lie that Satan told Eve was 90 truth 90 truth and the lie that you can tell how I've heard men bypass pieces in the scripture just to keep from it hurts their theology see but if that this part's right that part's right let's put it together and make it fit through the whole Bible invasion of the United States 1954 don't you see how religious the devil is the devil is not no anti-great big thing like communism all against Christianity that's not that oh well of the devil sure but it's not the Antichrist the Antichrist is very religious very religious it was a religious spirit that crucified Jesus it's always been a religious World a religious people that crucifies it's the religious people that was against the true Christ it was the religious prophets that was against my kids the religious people of the day that's against the message of God is this an is this Baptist is this Pentecostals no it's the message that religious spirit hides within the shadows of almost truth the devil loves Darkness he loves Shadows you can take Shadows and make things and and make things appear to be different than they are and and you can sneak through Darkness easier than you can in the light but when you turn the light on there's nothing to be afraid of it sometimes there's things and we have we have questions and secrets that maybe aren't even sin but doubts amen but what is sin but unbelief we have doubts doubt that in the secret most truth we have p truth come to church here they come to church over other places around the world that are message churches you can go through a season of being anointed by a religious spirit God can bring you out because God's Mercy is great and God's Mercy is new every day he'll do whatever it takes to get his son or daughter back to him but you see what happened is we get in a position and we find ourselves living in almost truth in Acts chapter 19 we found another display of this religious spirit Acts 19 verse 11. you can turn if you want I'm gonna go right to it and read it and God wrought special Miracles by the hands of Paul so that from his body were brought into the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and evil spirits went out of them foreign the insertion of the Vagabond Jews Exorcist took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying We Adore You by Jesus whom Paul preaches now Exorcist as Jews were these holy men that had the way with the incense and different things and they and they they would ex they would exercise the demons or they thought and so these were were what considered you know holy men they weren't they were they had a spirit of Witchcraft on them but they were accepted into the church and so they're like they see this and they're like oh this is exactly what we do we're going to do the same thing but but look we need to take the words and we need to say the words differently so they they they they they they took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying we endure You by Jesus whom Paul preacheth so they saw power in the spoken word but you see it's not just the words right that's right it's not the the you know the classic example which we don't have today so I'll bring it current when the cop pulls you over and he walks up and he says I need you to step out of the car nobody has a right to tell you that except for him in the old Joker walks up you say adios and you're just gonna drive off right you're not gonna let just anybody pull you over but it's the authority that he has behind him so you listen to him I hope anyways and um the ones that don't know they don't never get away anyways so as as as no matter how it sounds I would I would have conversations with people of a certain group and they all had this same sound now it wasn't the way they they wasn't their voice it wasn't how they formed words it wasn't necessarily what they said or though it was but it was just something about the anointing on their words and I would I would I would pray and I would Ponder and and I I just I I was just what is that thing I did I wanted to I wanted I wanted a label for it I wanted to identify it and so I was in conversation with them recently sitting at the at a table and all of a sudden the Lord spoke to my heart and said there's no power in their lives they can talk like the message but there's no power in their lives they don't look right they dress Holiness but they don't look right amen you know what that is that's the spirit of Christ on you and me identifying the spirit of the Antichrist on them our they Antichrist no they're underneath an anointing and God can deliver them from that anointing if he sees fit so they're saying the same thing they're going and they're doing this stuff and they and they present it in such a way and to me it it to me and this just sounds a bit awful but it's dripping with with it's oozing with overs over sympathy you ever meet somebody who's just pity it's dripping with pity they try to be to to perceive themselves as humble but it's arrogancy in a different way and it disgusted my spirit I it just made me feel gross and then you'd meet somebody and they're genuine and you just you're lifted up just by being in the same room as them and what it is it's a spirit I don't know how true it is or how accurate is but there was a woman one time who said she saw she saw demons and she saw the demon that was the religious spirit and she drew it and it was this this weird looking creature with like a tie and a stack of books that's the religious spirit she saw I don't know if that's true but I'm gonna use that as an example fictional example that it's just a man with a tie walking around with a stack of books parroting words but no power amen parroting words but no power and if you're not careful you're not careful you'll struggle with that because the words will be the right words and they'll say it in such a way you know you know the serpent was he beguiled Eve he seduced her smooth not he wasn't this demonic looking man she would have ran screaming he was smooth they're smooth and they got money to back it up and that's the problem but God has given us the eagle anointing eyes to see into the spirit Realm let me tell you something that an important lesson I learned though I be young things would happen I would meet somebody and I would have this very bad feeling good people good Christian people this very bad feeling in my spirit and I would feel bad but I can't recount all of them to you except for the one right now but time after time again something came up from the past that revealed a spirit that revealed somebody who didn't believe it someone was what was had a homosexual Spirit or different things like that and I started to pay attention to that and I'm gonna tell you tonight even you young people pay attention to that when you meet a man or you meet a woman and something doesn't sit right don't be stupid something doesn't say right do not go along with them do not even do not even come around this side of the church alone with them stay with other believers stay with other people if there's a something in your heart that touches you that that's the that's the Holy Spirit warning you don't ignore it amen praise the Lord that one was free like they say um and there were seven sons of one Siva a Jew and the chief of the priest which did so so they say we adore you by Jesus whom Paul preached that they even had the warrable in their voice and the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are you let me ask you tonight is your name on The Devil's registry you want your name on The Devil's registry you want him to know who you are but if there's blackmail he's God over you he's going to do what we're going to read here and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded and this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus and fear fell on all on them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified and many that believed came and confessed and showed their deeds amen God has a way of putting fear in your heart good Godly fear that will bring it to a place where you say I don't even care I'm gonna repent of this thing amen amen because I'm tired of the devil having power over me many of them also which used curious Arts so in other words I think they're an Ephesus if I read this correctly Ephesus was a city a place where people were into the the spiritual and the Magical and all this stuff and they bring their Curious Arch witchcraft black magic all of that stuff it's it's real brought their books together and burned them before all men and they counted the price of them and found it 50 000 pieces of silver fifty thousand pieces of silver I don't know why they equates the dollars but I think it's more than fifty thousand dollars a couple of hundred thousand dollars in books these people had invested their money in instead of selling them to get the money back to give it to the church praise God they burned that trash outside I'm sure that caused quite a stir so myly grew the word of God and there's an in there so mildly grew the word of God and prevailed and prevailed the word of God prevails against all things the word of God prevails against the fear that the devil tries to hold over you you know you can be delivered and the devil will get you in a place of condemnation and fear and steal your victory always talks about that that Crow wherever had the thing tied to his leg and then he was set free and he refused to fly off remember him he who the son has set free amen is free indeed the word indeed is used that means no matter what you think or the devil tells you you are free indeed amen yes indeed you are free and and the Book of Esther chapter 2 verse 10. Esther had not showed her people nor her Kindred for Mordecai had charged her that she should not show it she had kept this secret that she was a Jew this is an interesting situation here because Esther was living a holy and a Pure Life but she had a secret I often wonder if the if the king knew who she was would he have signed the papers that Haman presented him probably not because Haman said these people the Jews so Esther keeps who she is a secret from the the king and um I am not reprimanding Esther her situation I just want to show you what happens when you reveal everything to the king you surrender all even your doubts even your questions you surrender it all to him Easter's Esther's Secret perhaps wasn't totally wrong but look at the freedom that happened when she revealed to the king everything about her so the king and Haman came this Esther chapter seven and to the banquet with Esther the queen and the King said again unto Esther it took her some time to work up the courage only again she has them to a banquet of wine what is thy petition Queen Esther and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request and it shall be performed even to the half of the Kingdom she was afraid she had fear but she still knew her position so she comes then Esther the queen answered and said I have found favor in thyro King if I have found favor in thyroid King and if it please the king let my life be given at my petition and my people at my request without the king probably has this puzzle look on his face like what in the world for we are sold I and my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish but if we had been sold for Bond men and bond women I had held my tongue although the enemy could not countervale the king's damage then the King has you wear his answer to unto Esther the queen who is he and where is he that there's presume in his heart to do so who is it tell me Queen who is this person and the Esther said the adversary and the enemy is this wicked Haman the king's right-hand man the men he spent every day with pretty much got all his counsel from pretty much you don't think Esther in her position was afraid to say it's your right hand man king now that no we've laid this out many times and if you've been going to church for long enough to understand the position Esther was in as the queen she was the queen but even there was the right hand man she had to approach the queen a certain way but the right-hand man was part of the king's daily duties and had the king's ear and so she says it's your right hand man and the king gets up and he's just guess what he never doubted her he believed her he walks out into the garden the Bible says he walks out but then Bob says they said we'll keep reading so he walks out and from the banquet of Juan and in his wrath went into the palace garden and Haman set up to make a request for his life to after the queen he begins to beg and and he for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king then the king returned out of the palace Garden into the place of the banquet of wine I I love the scripture and Haman was falling upon the bed where on Esther was that's in the king will he Force the queen also in my presence this man was fighting for his wife and said the king uh will he Force the queen also before me in the house as the word went out of the king's mouth they covered haman's face they grabbed him the guards grabbed Haman and harbinaw wanted the Chamberlain said before the king behold also The Gallows 50 cubits High which Haven had made for Mordecai who had spoken good for the king standeth in the house of Haman then the king said hang him thereon Now esther finds Liberty by revealing everything about her to the king see her secret of being a Jew necessarily wasn't a bad secret but the king didn't know everything about her God wants to know everything about you he said well he's all-knowing up he wants to hear you tell him everything about you Haman has your number until you do so um in the back I I actually read into the next chapter and I I found something I hadn't seen before maybe I'm the only one tonight on that day King has words gave the house of Haman the Jews enemy unto Esther okay so he gives unto Esther for Esther had told what he was unto her and the King took off his ring which he had taken from Haman and gave it unto Mordecai and Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman and Esther spake okay now listen Esther spake yet again before the king and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put away the mischiefs of Haman the agagite and his device that he had devised against the Jews then the king held out the golden scepter before Esther so what Esther did the first time in coming to the queen and risking her life she did a second time you see what happened confidence in the king amen she both she bore everything to him every last secret of her heart and he accepted her right he didn't say what you're a Jew get out of my presence he accepted her no matter what secret you hold in your heart God will accept it God will accept you he'll do whatever it takes and he'll accept that and so the king in accepting that guess what he became identified with the Enemy he became identified with his when Christ came down and accepted a mortal body he became identified with Fallen Humanity but he did that so that you could become identified with him now everything the queen had in her heart the king knows there is no secrets there is nothing that Esther has to be afraid of now she has full and total confidence so without she bypasses all the legalities it just walks again into his presence and he just sends out the golden scepter confidence in her King and now he had greater confidence in her there's also a type of a man and a wife husband and a wife Naturally Speaking bear everything to your husband bear everything to your wife there'd be no secrets and there'll be a confidence there that nothing can come between Esther found her confidence in the king when she surrendered everything to him amen now you notice one thing the king he doesn't say hey let's go ahead and write a document we're going to make you know I'm gonna I'm gonna overrule what I said and we're gonna make a truce no the king said give the Jews whatever they need to fight back you see when it comes to God there is no truces with the Enemy don't make a truce with the enemy Deuteronomy chapter 9 verse 1 to 8. hear o Israel Thou Art to pass over Jordan this day to go into possess Nations greater and mightier than thyself cities Great and fenced to Heaven A people great and Tall the children of the anakims whom thou knowest and of whom thou has heard say who can stand before the children of anach understand therefore they say that the Lord thy God is he which goeth before thee as a consuming fire he shall destroy them and he shall bring them down before thy face so shalt thou drive them out and Destroy them quickly as the Lord hath said unto thee speak not an eye not thou and thine heart after that the Lord thy God has cast him out from before they saying for my righteousness the Lord hath brought me in to possess this land he says this is not done for your righteousness but this is done to condemn those those in the Promised Land and he goes on to say he says don't forget um actually I just feel led to just skip past that part so let's end in verse three understand therefore to say that the Lord thy God is he which goeth over before thee as a consuming fire so God went before them there was still a fight the Jews still fought against all those people that rose up to take their land and their possessions and they had they barely lost anybody and they had an overwhelming victory they didn't make a truce with the Enemy if you turn with me to Joshua chapter 9. now Deuteronomy ends make sure I'm going to say this right in the Joshua as they're crossing over the river Jordan Joshua chapter nine we find them directly I find it's interesting this is directly after the battle of AI now you know what happened in aega in AI Aiken sinned against the camp of Israel because he took the garments of The Spoils of Jericho Aiken had a religious spirit do you know a religious spirit feeds on past truth amen truth out of season because when they catch victory over AI they took all the spoils if Aiken had waited for present truth he would have not got a religious spirit that brought him to death so here we hit we find and they had the victory over Ai and directly after that oh I I the devil knows when to come along you're feeling high on the hog and just as spiritual and anointed as possible and you forget it's not you you've had the victory over AI you got rid of the sin in the camp you see the sin of the camp can be the church or you sitting in your life got rid of the sin in your life you're feeling high on the hog and and you have the Victory and everything's going good and you feel spiritual and anointed but you get in your flesh you get you get in your flesh you get a little bit too religious in the other side that religious spirit and here is Joshua in chapter nine and you can go read it if you want and a people out of gibeon come to Joshua and they they put old garments on them wore out shoes and they get moldy bread and they act like they've been traveling for months oh the bread was fresh when we left and now it's moldy and our clothes were brand new when we left and now they're Rags but they only traveled three days they were the devil is wild the Wilds of the devil and um it and so Joshua says look uh 9 verse 14 and the men took of their victuals and asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord and Joshua made peace with them and made a league with them to let them live and the princes of the congregation swear unto them they were told to annihilate everyone that stood on their promise but they made a truce with the Enemy you say well they got deceived yes they did but why did they get deceased because they sought not the counsel of the Lord they didn't go to the Lord sometimes they get in a position where we just we forget it's not us it's Christ it cannot stand on your own two feet ever it's got to be Christ now there comes a place when you're living in a close relationship with Christ you can't necessarily have to you know actually spray you know over what you're gonna do but you're seeking the Lord's will always and in all things and you're listening for the Lord to say no turn right not left go ahead and pull that pull up that slide it's got to be all the word amen all the time all the word all the time we were talking about this in class let's see how he's gurning at me on last Sunday morning I remember God's provided place of worship you can find God you can find God's provide a place of worship out somewhere listening to a tape you can find God's place of worship sitting in church but you can't do one without the other per se you can't just come to church you gotta feed on the word it's the Bible says get away quietly feed on the word the Bible says go to church we know to go and lit feet on the word listen to the tapes but the Bible says the faithful Ministry you don't just take a slice here and a slice there it's got to be all the word amen all the time and you know what happens when it's not the devil hides if you find a church that's not founded on all the word all the time there'll be people who struggle for years and never find victory because the devil's hiding in the shadows of almost truth full surrender you know almost truth equals almost victories but it's not about well I almost met you see that guys I almost made nobody cares because almost is not all the way almost even has the word all in it but only one L it's got to be all the word all the time you've got to be able to take the idea from the front to the back now if something happens when you find yourself in position God is calling out to your heart pulling on you to awake to righteousness First Corinthians 15 33-34 be not deceived evil Communications corrupt good manners awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of God I speak this to your shame Ephesians 5 verse 8. and there's a lot of scriptures tonight Ephesians 5 verse 8. there we go for you were sometimes Darkness but now are you light in the Lord walk as children of light for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and Truth proving what is acceptable unto the Lord and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them somebody asked me the other day about something and I won't say because I don't want to call them out but let me tell you if you ever have a question about something is it unfruitful works of darkness you say well the Bible doesn't exactly say it's bad but what kind of fruits that's it come from it unfruitful works works of darkness but rather reprove them for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret willing to know what they do we don't need to talk about what they do in New Orleans on their Mardi Gras we don't need to discuss sin like that but all things that are approved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever does make manifest is light in other words all things he says reprove those fruitful works of darkness and then he says the light will make manifest them that's right the darkness can only hide for so long I preached the sermon appointment with Destiny and and um do you know that coming to church and hearing what's being said tonight pushes you along to your appointment with Destiny you hear the word and you hear the word I heard the word and I heard the word and I heard the word and then finally I made this step you have an appointment with Destiny but you got to come and hear the word and hear the word and hear the word and hear the correction amen of the word wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light amen the scripture talks about light as a substance give you light become children of light it discusses the word it discusses the concept of life as is something you can pick up and hold amen let me ask you what is a light Christ amen what is Christ faith what is Faith a substance amen something you can literally take a hold of you can't grab Darkness but you can take light to the darkness and the Darkness comprehends it not you know I've said it before or maybe you remember if Mary walked through those doors tonight pregnant and told you it was by an Angel would you believe her if you had the right an awning and you had the right Spirit you would but how odd that would be did you know every day you walk outside you're pregnant Mary amen and the world just can't accept it so don't expect them to accept it don't try to convince them to ex accept it just keep bearing the life also you can't hide hide it when you're she couldn't hide being pregnant it was obvious I pray God help will be obvious that your life is growing inside of me awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give Delight in the uncertain sound 1960. behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before that great and terrible day shall destroy the world he'll restore the hearts of the children back to the original faith back to the gospel back to the power of God back to the real Holy Spirit back to Christ again before that great day come he says we hear the trumpet sounding oh my what is it awake your Saints of the Lord why Slumber when the end is nearing let's get ready for that final call if it gives an uncertain sound who shall prepare themselves for battle if it's uncertain but it's not uncertain people say what is this stuff they're talking about the Holy Spirit reading the very minds of the people and the thing that he's doing that's the certainty of the sound of the Gospel Christ said it would be that way a couple of paragraphs down there's only one certain sound that's the gospel prepare for the battle what battle the coming of the Lord prepare yourself for battle now against evil when evil is besetting the people on every hand everything going wrong and home life going wrong and covet falling and Russia attacking Ukraine and threats of war and homes splitting up and motherhood in other words people denying motherhood and it going low and immorals among the people and distrust amongst one another all denominations all message churches fussing and stewing but what you want to do be certain prepare yourself for the battle now the only way Feast of the Trump it's 1964. now the only way you'll know what the trumpet sound is is to look what the music sheet says that's all it's a great Symphony C and beating Psalms 144 verse 1. this takes me into the next Point blessed be the Lord my strength which teaches My Hands to War and my fingers to fight if you look up that word hands in the scripture means strength yeah so he says Lord You Are My Strength teach my strength to war train me how to use the strength you've given me to war you have the whole open word you have the strength that you need but when you lose a battle you need to ask God show me train me how to use my strength to war say to God we're in a battle every day of Our Lives we battle why why do we get sleepy in church and you can stay awake for hours doing something else why do weeds grow uninhibited you just barely sprinkle accidentally spill a little fertilizer in a forest the blue weeds grows next door you do a little so we you gotta fight for grass to grow the Earth is under a curse why do you gotta fight for grass to grow in your life because your body is under a curse it's a battle that you're in amen First Corinthians 14 8 for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle you see you will never find what is an uncertain sound a religious spirit Antichrist amen it doesn't ring true it doesn't blast truth and when you're listening to an uncertain sound so when the devil lies to you and he says you're defeated that's an uncertain sound because I got another word for you tonight from the gospel trumpet that says you are more than a conqueror you could have the victory over the fear in your life you can have a victory over your complacency amen especially as men we like to live in our nothing box and just be complacent and drift and leave the things that we need to take care of I said well that's carnal I'm I'm listening to a tape all things in balance are you taking care of your Affairs are you dealing with what you need to be doing don't become complacent and just drift through life and what happens happens take it by the tail Lord teach my strength to war and my fingers to fight the only way you find strength is when you live in present truth I wrote something I'm not I'm not trying to make this super spiritual but I wrote something last night when I was studying underneath the anointing and I don't normally just put written out things but I wanted to just read this so these this is my words don't make a truce and I'm doing this in closing here tonight don't make a truce with the Enemy to appease him to keep him quiet the devil loves secrecy to hide in the shadows of almost truth the people find themselves in bondage when the whole truth is not present all the word all the time none of this half-truth 99 truth we need the power of the pure unadulterated word of God now this must be applied to a church but also to your life anything hanging on that's almost truth will riddle your life with almost victories remember Aiken that religious spirit in the camp of Israel affected the whole body body as in church and body as in you and me as individuals the scripture says is your that if your heart condemns you you must go make it right amen you must come boldly Before the Throne like Esther but you will never do so if the devil has blackmail on you Esther's approach would have never come off right if she had sin hanging in her life she would have never found the courage to step into the king's court Uninvited unless she was perfectly aligned with the king's will live in present truth magicians if you come tonight Matthew 24 28 for whereas whoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together Eagles vultures it depends on the state of the carcass is it fresh is it present truth why did Brothers say over and over and over again people looking to what God has did and look into what God's going to do they're out of season so they're speaking words that might seem true they're they're acting like the truth but there'll be no victory Aiken was acting like the rest of the children of Israel he went to battle the fight why didn't he die in the battle foreign because God wanted to show us a lesson care of that Aiken that's in your life and watch God brings Victory it's hard it's in it's you know maybe depending on the situation might be embarrassing but when you get to take that letter that the devil's written to tell you look you got no rights and you know he's right but when you get to a place where you take care of that you can burn it you can burn the devil's blackmail and now you have full confidence to step into the king's court Sparrow heads tonight Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I just sometimes Lord I just get to this place ministering Lord just overwhelmed on the

her voice please come open the door and she's making all these excuses why she can't she's already washed her feet she's already gone into bed she can't do it and she puts it off and he keeps beckoning and finally she drags herself up and she complains that she goes to the door and when she opens the door he's gone all he's left is a little myrrh to remember him by and she goes out into the streets and and she's calling for him looking for him knowing feeling guilty for for denying her bridegroom when he beckoned with his voice to come in and she find herself herself at the Watchman watchmans are the ministers and they correct her what are you doing out here you need to go back home and and she takes the correction as beating and they were being so mean but it was the guilt in her heart for denying the voice of Her bridegroom that makes her perceive the words of the minister in such a fashion Saints the Lord comes and he knocks and we can spend all day talking about oh
