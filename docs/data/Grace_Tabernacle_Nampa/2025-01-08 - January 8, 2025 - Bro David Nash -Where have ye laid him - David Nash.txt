live lives worthy of the Gospel of Jesus Christ help us Lord to As we sing that other song to be like Jesus and as we would enter this service tonight by the word of God may you reveal yourself aresh to us tonight in Jesus name we ask it amen amen praise the Lord if not to keep you standing too long let's turn to uh it's John H and it's the 11th chapter and I believe we'll start about the 32nd verse I'll say Lord willing as always sometimes we start service we were in Portland not so long with the Hispanic Church there and I got the first scripture read and the whole thing changed from right there and I had to just tell them you did that because the The Notebook was page was empty and uh Lord really blessed that service and amen so we just I'm sure David and Paul both understand so amen but tonight just uh if we could start with actually we'll start with verse 23 of 11th chapter John and this is where Jesus has been waiting and they've told him Lazarus is uh sick will you come and he waits and he waits until he tells them Lazarus is dead up in verse 14 and when he comes down well I'll start with verse 21 uh then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou has been here my brother had not died but I know that even now now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha said unto him I know he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever lives and Believes In Me shall never die believest thou this she said unto him yay Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of God which should come into the world and when she had said so she went her way and called Mary her sister secretly saying the master has come and calls for thee and when as soon as she had heard that she Rose quickly and came unto him and Jesus was not yet coming into town but was in the place where Martha had met him and there were Jews which were with her in the house and comforted her and when they saw Mary that she rose up hastily and went out they followed her saying she goes unto the grave to weep then when Mary was come to Jesus and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto the Lord if you had been here my brother had not died then Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in his spirit and was troubled and he said where have you laid him and said unto him they said unto him Lord come and see gracious Heavenly Father we I give you this service I give you this man I give you the hearts and souls of these people Lord Jesus take full control of all these things in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen please be seated I thought how appropriate that you would sing that song uh more of him because uh by about this time next week I'll be boarding an airplane for Nicaragua and I haven't heard that song sung in quite a while and brother usabo Orosco who used to take us night after night after night in that country different churches all over the place sometimes driving three or four hours each Direction after a service up in the mountains and different places that was one of his favorite songs and in the Espanol or the Spanish it's m m m and so when I was hearing that I always when I've learned a song in Spanish a lot of times I I want to sing it in Spanish and people look around and I I have to tell people I don't know Spanish I'm sure the there are those who know I don't know Spanish and my friends down there they always tell me that's Spanglish David because we know what you're saying but that is not Spanish so please remember us and uh as we will be headed there we'll be in Tri Cities this uh weekend to the little home Church up there who would send their greetings of course and also we spoke last weekend in Louisiana and they always tell us hey wherever you go greet the people they're from Manny Louisiana so be thou officially greeted and uh but yes we will leave we'll come back to Boise and board for Nicaragua San through San Francisco and uh looking for the Lord to do great things Ezekiel called the other day said we could be looking at between 15 or 20 services in 14 days so if you write David N on the bottom of your list for prayer I would appreciate it the prayer request tonight actually I sat next to a man coming down here on the airplane and we started talking scripture I he's from San Jose California and very uh knowledgeable man of wisdom a Christian man and when we got out we were getting ready to get off the plane he that is his wife's mother and she lives in Colombia has a ter has had a terrible health condition in her lungs and we prayed together on the airplane and as we were getting off he said you know of all the years and flights I've made he goes this was the best flight I've ever made he said because we talked about the word of the Lord for a good hour and he was just excited and and uh so do remember her name is aresia I believe was how he said it so his name is Ted and he gave me his number and he said when you get to San Jose come look me up so that's kind of what that was all about and then a couple of unspoken considering other people we've been talking to and we just praise the Lord for those things so looking at this scripture tonight we know that it was Jesus had turned to his disciples when he knew that John that Lazarus was dead and how that uh he had waited until that time and he even told him you know I'm glad we weren't there when he because he because he had a a duty from God to do we know one place he said he never did anything he said except the father show him and so the Lord has showed him Lazarus is dead and so when they go there to Lazarus and when he gets to he gets to the place near where they live and Bethany by the way means the house of bitterness and when he gets close to this house of bitterness and Martha gets up and goes out to greet him uh near the place and when she sees him watch what her testimony is she's a Believer she really believes that Jesus Christ is the Messiah that he's the one that God has sent and she makes that statement in verse 21 Lord if you had been here my brother had not have died but even but know that even now whatever you ask of God he will give it to you what a statement of faith her brother has been dead and I believe at this time he'd been dead four days because later on when he tells him to roll back the stone she said he stinks he's been dead four days they didn't have the bombing things like we do today and his body would stink it's starting to rot and so but in this place she said but whatever you if you'd been here he wouldn't have died but whatever you ask now I believe God will do it for you and watch what Jesus answers to that he said unto her thy brother shall rise again now we know that in the word of God the word of God here is here and that God always corrects the error and so when she speaks to him and he tells her thy brother shall rise again what did he just do do yeah what has he just done when he says this to her he is speaking in a prophetic tone because her brother is dead and so he's saying your brother will rise again now the common she was well taught she'd been around the Pharisees she believes in a resurrection unlike the the Sadducees and so she's a believer in the resurrection she's heard all the common doctrine of the day and so as she's listening or when she hears him say this then Martha says unto him I know that he shall rise again at the resurrection at the last day good true honest Doctrine but it was the wrong one amen it was a true honest Doctrine but what was wrong was the author of that Doctrine was standing there and that author of the doctrine this thing that we call resurrection and life it's not an event friends that we're waiting for right it is not an event the event will follow but the one that causes the event said I am the resurrection and the life our resurrection and our life is Jesus Christ Living in each one of us personally that is our resurrection that is our life or the past because he continues and said I am the resurrection and the life he that believes in me though he were dead yet shall he live that's right so he's saying as a Christian if you have received Jesus Christ is as a born again believer you received Jesus Christ you lifted your hands and said Jesus Christ take a hold of me and some people they belittle that and they say well there's no power in that he didn't get nothing he didn't speak in tongues he didn't do this he didn't do that she didn't know you know and they tell you that but look back to the thief on the cross he said the right word to the right person and said Lord remember me and it was enough that the power of God through the memory of God looks at that man and said you'll dwell with me this day in paradise another prophecy and and I've heard the story you know the guy crosses over and here's all these people and they have there all their testimonies and you can read in Hebrews 11 I think it is or about all the things that they went through those people those those great Heroes of Faith and how he walks over and they say how did you get here I don't know I just said the right thing at the right time but the power was in those words to the place it brought salvation unto him so anyone anywhere anytime that touch Jesus Christ that calls on the name of Jesus Christ Jesus take my heart take my life he'll do it friends amen he said and there's I want to say it's in the book of Acts I I might have it wrong he said anyone that calls on the name of Jesus Christ is Reed salvation will they be in the bride can't tell you that that's completely his that's completely his choosing right but what you can receive is salvation through the name and the power of Jesus Christ when we and and I remember the case where there was a woman praying and the congregation uh brother brandham was talking to at the time they they were kind of hesitant about what's going on because they hadn't seen they weren't familiar with prophetic gifts and as they were uh there was a woman she started crying out Jesus Christ Jesus Christ remember me and he kind of rebuked the congregation and I believe it was on the tape decision time and he said what's the matter with you he said anyone that what else can that woman calling on the name of Jesus Christ touch but Jesus Christ when you call on Jesus Christ and ask him into your heart into your life you receive Jesus Christ according to your faith because even when he said the resurrection and the life what was the only requirement was was that whosoever liveth and believeth shall never die believest thou this believe that when you ask you receive and you receive by the faith and when you raise your hands how many times you heard it another place where he said the fact that you raised your hands shows that the life that's in you is reaching out to Jesus Christ and he has to respond because the life that was in you reached out to the life of God Amen and so as he says this he says un her I am the resurrection and the life who is the I am Jesus said I and the father are one who spoke to Moses when he said who should say sent me I am that I am that's who sent Jesus Christ and the I am God we call him the father who is in living in Jesus Christ and that I am God said that's your resurrection that is the what we call it also as it moves into the New Testament after the death burial resurrection and Ascension of Jesus Christ he sends our portion of that I am back that we might receive the same resurrection and life the same father that lived in Jesus is now living in Us by way of repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you shall that's a Bible promise that's a promise from almighty God you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and that's the spirit of God that he pours back to us because of the birth birth life daral burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ praise the lord well it's good we're already out of text but that's okay and he continues there though he were dead yet shall he live and yeah he's tying it together yeah and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this how many times have we heard it the Christian that's born again that has the the holy ghost that has received Jesus Christ has the seed or the G Gene the word of God dwelling in us and there's no death for the Christian he say well so and so he passed away so what all he did was like I walked out that door a few minutes ago and all we do is step out of an Earthly body that was condemned to death from the Garden of Eden and step into eternal a life a Christian Never Dies Never Dies you cannot die because the Bible says the seed of God dwells within us praise the Lorden and all that it do that it is the only requirement was do you believe it believest thou this can we believe it I believe it amen amen and so he gives this these statements and after he gives these statements they go out and uh she says unto him Lord yay Lord I believe that you're the Christ the son of God which came into the world and when she goes out she calls and her sister comes and well the other people they they even hire people to mourn in those countries they pay them to come I I don't know why if it makes it look better for the funeral service I don't know do anybody have why they do that but they do that and so the other people they see and they they're so they're going to go and to the the place they they think that that's where she's going to go see him and when they uh do this we'll drop down to verse 32 and when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him Lord if you had been here my brother had not died what have we just witnessed what are we witnessing because this is almost The Identical words that her that Martha had said when Jesus first come on the scene when she came into the presence of Jesus Christ that was her statement of belief and now as Mary comes into the presence of Jesus Christ she gives the same testimony the almost exactly the same testimony if you had been here my brother had not have died and so she is giving her faith testimony that you're the Christ you're the one that was sent into the world and she didn't even hear the things that Jesus said to Martha as far as we know but she had that same Abraham's seed in her to believe this is the Messiah that was sent from God you are that Messiah if you had been here he would not have died and Jesus had told the people if any two can agree on any one thing you can have what you ask for that should encourage us without even knowing what her sister had said and when he comes to into her presence the presence of God to her said if you'd been here he wouldn't be dead right H what about in our lives what when we when we take these prayers requests when we pray for these things what about those things what about when we agree we come together and and it says we have the mind of God Amen and when we bring these requests it's because in someone's mind it was in Ted's mind to pray for his wife's mother and when we I took it and we prayed for her on the airplane and I and of course course we give him testimonies of how God has healed and how he has raised people up and done all these things he said that is the most encouraging thing I've ever heard considering I said there's a difference between a miracle and Divine Healing that's right she will have to fight for it as you tell her about it but there's no reason and and we gave him the testimony of how you know the doctor said if this guy wakes up at all right he might be a vegetable for the rest of his life and I said you know look at me you saw me walk onto the airplane I said the hospital rode off $80,000 because they said it was I I I guess they said it was impossible number one for me to they they were looking at me being in a hospital bed for maybe two years and on the seventh day we walked out of the hospital that's the healing power of Jesus Christ I remember my son All of You Prayed For Us brother Paul came up prayed for us and it hurt just to be honest it really hurt but I remember Jonathan was the I think the first one that told me he said Dad I know it hurts he goes it has to hurt I mean they had tubes on my spinal cord but every each step we took I do this in the name of Jesus Christ you remember you know and I couldn't walk but in the name of Jesus Christ we walked out of that hospital using the granny Walker we were down here for Isaac and Kristen's wedding amen when I was supposed to be maybe dead or a vegetable that's the healing power of Jesus Christ that's the power of God Unleashed from our hearts when the Holy Ghost begins to speak for our lives oh friends if you're out out there in the tapel land or wherever give your heart to Jesus Christ let that power of God come into you let it come and take a hold of your life and all it takes is Jesus Christ remember me amen and the power is there to give you eternal life amen amen do you believe it I remember I sent someone not too long ago a text because uh we'v been sharing some things and I said you know this is your day to uh I remember how I said it receive it seize it and receive it is that right anyway there was three but to receive it we seize it I'll believe it receive it and or seese it and believe it there we go I got it right that time and that's all it takes by faith we hear it and then and when we seize a hold of the promise then we receive the results of the promise so she go goes there and now she has done what was already commanded of Jesus for the New Testament Believers if any two can believe on any one thing you can have it do you know that in the message of the hour he said that's you and God Amen that's the two just it doesn't take you know a big crowd it takes you and God coming into the mind of God and that's why how the thief on the cross he had the mind of God and when his mind touched the the mind of God in Jesus Christ that responded When Love projects love responds and that man received eternal life in the last moments of his life because he said the right thing with his dying breaths and so we see and uh in verse 33 when Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews weeping which came with her he groaned in his spirit and was troubled this is the Messiah and when he sees this crowd of people and he sees Mary Weeping at his feet as this is going on it says he groaned in his spirit and I like it because we know that the Hebrew they read from from left or from right to left we read left to right and we know we've had the instructions you can take and flip the words around as long as you don't change the words and all it does is change your perspective of what you're looking at and so as he he does this he groans in his spirit and that in the Hebrew every single letter can have a meaning because they even count in their alphabet and how that it says that he groans it means that he sigh in indignation in other words he's kind of disgust usted at these people he as he groans he's sighing it's like oh man that's how I would think of it and he's like what's the matter with these people and it also means to blame or to murmur or to straightly charge when you start adding up all those letters and reading back through it he's he's groaning he's because he's upset with what he's seeing because he's all he's just announced himself I am the resurrection and the life but these other people are there this crowd of people and as he looks at them and another one when you begin to break it down because the other thing each when you start into those letters a lot of times you follow it out and it actually goes it'll take you back to the very root meaning of the word and the root meaning means it's a fixed PL a fixed position I was just eating one of those things for the throat my come tongue is sticky I'm sorry but a fixed position between time and place and a relationship of rest wow H so he's upset because they can't see he is there for a purpose and to show them where to rest and yet it goes one more part and that is a time a place and a purpose or intent that proceeds from the origin point from the origin point from the I am God he has sent Jesus Christ to this place with a purpose and an intent to show who he is the I am living in his son Jesus Christ the origin point he said I am the beginning I am the ending in the Book of Revelation I am Alpha I am Omega and the origin point is there to fulfill the purpose of God and it said there that he was troubled and that's uh agitated or like water just as it starts to boil and as it starts to boil and and and so he was agitated when he was troubled and I thought about how that uh or also like water that's boiling as it comes over the waterfall or you know hits the water and it's like it boils and you can see the Mist coming up off the water and how that this was he was troubled and in uh Psalms 42 it says the deep is calling to the Deep where at the noise of the water spouts as that water begins or when it boils bubbles up out of the out of the ground or we see the geysers I had friend that there lives outside of the grand that used to uh they knew the hours that the geyser would shoot off and if they had a pig or something they wanted to cook and get the skin off they would go out to the hole and drop it down the hole and then wait for the geyser said it's the easiest way to skin an animal you can ever think because when it pops out of the geyser he said you can just take your knife just peel it right off so I don't know why I'm telling you that but but that was the boiling of the water because when the water when that geyser comes up it is so hot it's boiling water and how that this when he was troubled he was agitated he was like boiling water about to announce this deep calling to the Deep God calling not just it will see in a moment here not just for Lazarus but for those people to understand I am the beginning I am the ending and all of that's locked in those little words that I often times just pass over him but they're there for a purpose and he's using that purpose tonight for you and I and so then he takes that next verse in verse 34 and this was really you know if we took a title for it is where have you laid him because that's the next thing they said unto him Lord come and see and that was the question where have you laid him who is him that he's talking about who is this himy who is this well we know if you go back up there Lazarus is dead verse 14 that's who he's talking about where is Lazarus where have you laid him do you know what the name Lazarus actually means Lazarus strength strong the ram the chief the the post of the door the oak tree the lentil the strong body to twist or be powerful the mighty strength I want that to soak in Where have have you laid the strong one the ram the chief one the one that's the strong and mighty one as the post of the door what is that representing where were they told to place the blood on the Leno and on the sides or the posts of the doors the strongest place of the house if you're ever in a tornado they have them down south they said get in that door frame because it's the strongest thing of the house it's the strongest part get into a good door frame and hold on because that's where the strength of the whole whole house lies is in that door frame it's the strong one the mighty Ram the chief the posts of the door the oak tree what does the oak tree have to do with this if you ever listened to the message who is this milk aidic when we were in Israel I loved brother ruven he was an old fellow he's passed away now not so long ago he was born and raised I believe in Israel he was a Jew but he believed in Christ and he that's he traveled with brother George and was their our uh like our travel adviser I guess you would call it and how that he would tell us things you know from the Jewish perspective about Jesus Christ and I would call him just not often but every once in a while I would have a a question and I remember talking to him I'd been studying some things about the plains of mamory and I wondered what you know what is it why is it a special place and why is and you know and so I was talking to him on the phone and finally he said David I know you're going to come back to Israel he said when you come back he goes I would like to take you there but it's in Palestinian held territory I can't go there now but I have been there before things were the way they have been in and he said I want to tell you that oak tree is still there wow we're talking friends 4,000 years old or more I don't know exactly where Abraham met mzed the one who had no father had no mother had no beginning had no no ending it was almighty God had stepped out of his Heavenly throne and he took a little dust or something and and steps into a body because he ate calf meat and drank milk it was God and he said the tree is still there I've seen it and he says Where have you laid this Lazarus where have you laid yes where have you laid the experience that was there at the Oak Tree where have you put meaz a dick where have you laid him where have you laid the strong body of God the powerful one the Mighty the strength the strong one where have you put him now think about the rest of it where have you laid him where have you put the strong the mighty one the chief of Israel and why have you laid him as dead where where have you put him where have we put the strong the mighty one where have we put the ram of God the one that when Abraham was ready to slay Isaac and God said stop Abra now I know you love me because you would have gone through with it and when Abraham he stops and was he he he's looking there at his son and it said he lifted up his eyes and when he lifted up his eyes because God has just spared his son and we find in the Book of Romans the reason he spared him when he lifted up his eyes it means he opened the fountains what do you think comes out of your eyes the tears and the things like that but it also it opens us up to look and behold the word of God we open our fountains when we come to this book amen and when he lifted up his eyes he opens The Fountains of God for him and what did God just say to him I know do you ever look at the let's look turn it to that so maybe we can remember it it's in Genesis 22nd chapter said Abraham lifted up his eyes actually the verse before that it's in the verse 12 and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou any thing unto him for now I know now I know who's the I am God I am God is ever present he is the now that's right yes and he says to Abraham now I what I know you ever notice the name of the place and Abraham in verse 14 Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Gyra as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be what it shall be seen God saw not just the fact fact he's pulling the knife he looked right into the very heart of existence that was in Abraham and when he looks into Abraham's heart and sees that Abraham has the faith as we read of him in the in the Book of Romans I believe it is where he said he wasn't afraid to kill his son because if God could give him that son that was as good is dead when his wife's womb was Barren and when he had no seed left and God gave him that son God was able to raise him up again and he' already prophesied the first time if you go back in that chapter and it says Abraham lifted up his eyes and he saw the place of sacrifice a far off amen well I told the little brother I guess I'm the Evangelist tonight when he lifted up his eyes what did he see when The Fountains of the deep were opened and Abraham looked he knew that the sacrifice was far off a thousand years away when he looked and that's why he turns back to his men he said me and the boy are going up and we're coming back because he knew in that sacrifice that he looked a far off there was the power of the resurrection and he believed it praise the Lord am and when he said that he prophesies we're going up and we're coming back and yet it was full within his heart to slay his son because if God could give it to him the first time he could give it back to him that's the faith amen of Abraham's seed and so now he asks Jesus asks him where have you laid him before we get away from Abraham think one more thing because as he's raising his hand hands and opening his eyes and looking into that realm he said it says that and Abraham lifted up his eyes in verse 13 and he looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a Thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stad of his son have we read this correctly really he lifts up his H hands he's you know and his eyes are being open and behind him is the ram yeah have you ever seen think about God because the the name that God has called here is the Lord in the mountain of the Lord it shall be seen and we had a prophetic message where a man turns his head back to the audience it says you over there sister so and so with the cancer on your and you Mr so and so what was he showing us it's the same God of Abraham the same oak tree experience oh people open our eyes to the power of God with the back turned to the tent he said why did Sarah laugh and now behind Abraham is the offering of the sacrifice in the place of Abraham's son God provides because even Abraham when Isaac ask him going up the hill father I have the fire the sword the every you know all the stuff for the sacrifice but where's the RAM and Abraham remember he' had his eyes lifted up and he says God will provide himself the sacrifice he saw God himself becoming my sacrifice far off amen and then he finds out the ram is behind him caught in the thicket friends caught in the thorn bush it's all Jesus Christ this whole book is Jesus Christ okay and he says Where have you laid him where have you laid the strength of Israel where have you laid the oak tree where have you laid the lentil where have you laid this strong body of the Lord I love him or I wouldn't be here tonight that's right I love him because he first loved me and how that sometimes I have doubts and fears in my life I do certain things the Lord says you know do this and I start to do it and I think man am I really supposed to do this Lord you know it's like the you ever do that is it just me is it just me but sometimes God puts us to the test just like Abraham I wonder what he was going through his mind when he raised that knife how is God going to make this work I know the sacrifice is way there but I got to go through with this because God told him to do it it said he was tempted at the first of chapter 11 that's right said God did this to tempt Abraham to see Abraham are you really going to believe my word are you really going to believe that your vision matches with what I'm telling you it looks ridiculous to Man's eyes but Abraham said had already spoken through his son God will be our sacrifice God himself provides the sacrifice and so here Jesus now back at into the New Testament and how he says Where have you laid him where have we laid the power of God why do they have the power of God outstretched and dead what about them now Jesus has announced who he is and then he Grieves because they're not catching the idea and so he's grieved with them and then he makes that statement where is he where is the oak tree the strong body the powerful one and why have you laid him out dead what about this world of religion that we live in they have laid out Lazarus as dead that's right that's right and he was hidden behind the stone yeah and when he was hidden there and laid out as though dead and when we know that after that Jesus uh it says Jesus wept and they and the Jews they look at this say oh how he loved Lazarus like he's not going to do something about it you know hey love look how much he loved him and and they even said could not not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused even this man that he should not have died what are they looking we know from the message of the hour a denominational spirit says looks at what was done back there and looks what's going to be done up there and ignores what's happening right now this religious world has laid Lazarus the strength the power of the almighty God as though he's dead laid him flat and low as dead and they said couldn't he have done it well yes he could have done it but he had to show that I am the everpresent god is on the scene to take care of your problems my problems the problems of those that we testify to the problems of whosoever will let him come and drink from the fountain Christ Jesus tonight and then he tells him he's groaning within himself as he gets to the grave in a in a cave and there's a stone laid upon it and he says take away the stone and this is where Martha says uh you know hey Lord he's been dead for a while he stinks for he's been dead four days but Jesus has to turn to her again and correct the error he said didn't I tell you this that if you would believe you should see the glory of God mhm and they took away the Stone from the place and when they removed the stone when they rolled back the stone huh you mean now you can see into that tomb you can see the dead man and he stinks I'm sorry to say this but there are certain people in this world there's it's the truth their religion stin it's been dead a long time and if they don't roll back the stone to where they can see the power of God restore what is he doing with Lazarus and he stops they take away the stone where he's laid and Jesus lifts up his eyes he opens the fountains huh he lifts up his eyes and says father I thank thee that thou Hast heard me and I knew that thou heard me always but because of the people which stand by I said that they may believe that thou has sent me and when he said thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth Lazarus thou strength and power the oak tree experience the lentil the strong body he's calling that life to come forth forth from the darkness of a religious tomb hidden behind the stones the stone he's calling it back to life amen he was calling the strength and the power of God back to life and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave cloth clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin and Jesus said to him said unto them loose him and let him go tonight friends I'm asking you loose him amen and let him go let the power of God roll back the dark Stones we' you've heard the Seven Seals they were hidden because Jesus was hidden in that tomb and when the stone was C rolled back and the the woman goes to see him and he's not there why because he had been called back amen he had been loosed and the power the strength the mdic experience the strong body the almighty God had been loosed from the power of the grave and I'll close with Hebrews the 2 chapter we know know this these things and we know them by the power and the glory of God and in Hebrews the 2 chapter it's talking here about Jesus and in the 14th verse of chapter 2 he book of Hebrews for as much then as the children are partakers of the Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same so God himself in his son Jesus Christ in that Earthly body is going to take the same thing that every man woman child on Earth was given in this world a fleshly body he became partakers of the Flesh and Blood he also be took part of that and the reason the purpose was that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that's the devil where did the devil get the power over death let me read the next portion and deliver them who the through through the fear of death were all their life team subject to bondage where did he get that where did the devil get that because he used the serpent to talk to Eve to change the word because the word was the day you eat thereof you shall die and when they partook of that God even went to to to Adam and Eve Adam where are you where art thou what if they had repented right then right but they didn't right in fact what they they do because of fear they hid themselves from the presence of God and and that's where Satan got his hand to hold was the fear of death the fear of death the fear of loss the fear that they had no way back yeah that's it so he says okay here put these lamb skins around you because the alter sacrifice is a long ways off but it will come and it will be paid and the stone has been rolled away for us to be able to look in there and say I'm not in there anymore that's right we don't have to fear death no sir some of us may see it before it's over I don't know doesn't matter just don't fear it that's right don't fear it because the fear has been deleted by Jesus Christ who took the devil's sword away remember when Goliath what did he hold he held the sword what's the first thing David did he took the sword and cut the head off the enemy that's right the head of the enemy has been vanquished through Jesus Christ let us stand amen amen I'll read verse eight just while there cuz I have it underlined and now H has put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that was not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him we don't see it yet because of the blind the blinders of this flesh we live in as they were talking about before service the circumstances circumstance has nothing to do with this the price was paid through Jesus Christ let us pray gracious heavenly father I thank you tonight I love you I praise you we give you the honor the glory I give you my hands are raised my heart is raised Lord Jesus Take It All restore unto us the joy of our Salvation And even the word rapture I believe is like Joy upon Joy upon Joy upon Joy how important is
