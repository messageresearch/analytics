circumstance father Lord and those that are here bless each one I ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen well first off before I forget I'm I I bring a lovely hello greeting and God bless you from Brother uh pant and sister aona and we actually got to sleep in your guys's bedroom that uh I assume it's yours has your picture in there and uh so but we had just such a lovely time a little short visit but they were very thankful just a little encouragement to them and and uh they thank you for your prayers for your constant reminder before the Lord and uh uh they get a little Lonesome down there and uh there's several things we won't announce over the pulpit but even things back home sister conscious uh family and some different things that are there that weigh heavy upon them and obviously some change in the government and their point of view here uh in the United States that weighs very heavy upon them and so God bless you and um normally we don't give greeting on on things like birthdays but I just have to say Brother David uh sings how you are the Elder of our church uh yes yes yes that's a good Revelation to have anyway it's wonderful we appreciate you I have to just say that we sat there and streamed this service on Sunday and um really enjoyed it all four of us just sitting there we really really enjoyed that service let's turn I want to speak to you um God bless you thank you musicians amen always leaves me feeling good amen the Lord's blessed us with with these musicians and song leaders and each well each and every one of you amen um I just want to speak on being positionally placed for a positive outcome and a big title for actually a simple thought amen but sometimes you got to you know kind of Pizazz it up a little bit but I think we could all agree as we look at the word right now just to grab a quote so to speak out of thin air the prophet of God said when we see who we are is that not us seeing our positional Place amen he says when you see who you are the bride you'll become and oh yeah say that louder someone Invincible who's Invincible amen we might not feel like it all the time but come on the prophet said when we see who we are we become an invincible Army that is being positionally placed amen the Army doesn't all fight to be in the cafeteria amen that's not the weapon of their Warfare amen they're not all you know just but everyone's got to be in their proper position amen Jeremiah 29 11-13 very simple scripture tonight and uh I want to just draw this out we all uh would recognize uh Jeremiah 29 as it is that God placing this before us to remind us that we are positionally placed now we can be positionally placed in our flesh and we can be positionally placed you might say spiritually but we are also directly positionally placed in Christ and so to me it should eliminate a lot of our battle that's exactly but it actually increases the battle because Satan says wait when they get in their position I can no longer control them and you know every nician type spirit is about control right that is what the nician spirit is and the Holy Spirit is dealing with the lamb and a dove and you can say yes the Holy Spirit controls us but I think we're all tonight understanding of the difference of the kind of control that a nician spirit has and what the Holy Spirit has the holy spirit is wooing you and I into the the presence of the Lord a nickan type spirit is actually demanding that you do it in a certain fashion whether it's right with the word or not it's trying to cause it to happen in a certain way Jeremiah 2911 for I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall ye call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart every one of those shs is a oh I forget you know I read this stuff and then I can't I I'm this won't be quite right but just bear with me is a subtle type of command you shall so it's not directive but it is a command that causes us to react and so he says here uh that uh when you when you uh come to this place then you shall call upon me amen has that command influenced your life amen we call upon him we're calling on him and and you shall go and pray unto me here again a commands he that is not a dictative type command it's something in our heart compelling and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me I say this scripture even though it's here in Jeremiah is just as real today with the bride of Christ as it was the day when the Prophet Jeremiah spoke it and I say thank you Lord Heavenly Father we just ask you tonight just come be with us lead us guide us in this thought let us speak your word according to your word Lord bless all the saints and all the needs Lord L and each and every one father in the precious name of Jesus Christ we press forward Amen to the mark of the High Calling knowing Lord that you have called us to that position thank you Lord ask for your blessings tonight in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated you know as I look at that I I see this scripture in in my mind as not just these verses right here but as the whole Jeremiah 29 when we read that it it's a wonderful scripture to me it's just uh really vibrant it's authorative do you like it when the word is authorative amen I I like that I I don't I don't want uh I'm glad that the the the gospel is not a well if you feel like this or you feel like that but God says you know what you shall seek me amen and we read that and there's something in US responds to that and says yes Lord I'm going to seek you and so it's very authorative and yet at the same time you might say well authoritative uh you know such such a way but look how it's encouraging my brother and sister the word of God no matter you know in the times that it's corrective it's still encouraging if we ever view the word as as so corrective that we cannot find joy in the Lord something's wrong something's out of kelter because even when the Lord corrects us there is an encouragement that comes with the word and you know being the bride of Christ now just not some average person out here uh my brother and sister we we are the Bride of Jesus Christ can we say Amen to that tonight and we should identify with that it should not be a cliche it should be an identity and so as we do this we find that the word Even in our most difficult times when we're down in the valley and everything seems to not be going right and the devil's there whispering in our ear you know trying to convince us that that see you've finally come to the end of the road this is only as far as you're going to go but then the Lord comes and even if it's through corrective word it's an encouraging word that reminds us this is who I am and I can no more I I was going to include this tonight but I I didn't want to drag it out too far but you know the prophet of God I do have a little reference to it but the prophet of God's talking about Who We Are we cannot make ourselves something else that's right we we just have to stop and identify this is who I am in good days in bad days when things have just gone completely wrong and I'm so discouraged and might even voice the words I've never felt so low in my life but yet my brother and sister we'll we'll touch on this in just a little bit God already knew that low was there amen and so as we come to these places in our life God is saying I need you to come and identify this place in other words you know sometimes when you travel a little bit you know uh uh you know uh suddenly on your phone or something it'll be a little pinpoint and a little um oh I forget what they call a little flag or whatever that is and and you know suddenly it shows up oh London I've been to London yes that's right I've been to London God says look I want to show you right now you've been in Heavenly places amen it's not marking a London of our life or a you know Amsterdam of our life he's saying you've been in Heavenly places you actually know what Heavenly places are like and he reminds us then as we start to remember and God's healed us and he's delivered us and he he's answered prayers and and the devil's there saying I need to keep you down in the pit and God just speaking to us and reminding I'm your healer and we say yes I've been healed I'm your deliverer yes I've been delivered and you can't stay down in that if we uh uh uh some things you know that we will probably announce this Sunday but uh my brother and sister just a reference to to emus as they were walking along I'll put it in Paul's words okay not exactly the scripture Jesus steps out now how did he just step out on them Supernatural stepped right into that and was right there and they could touch him they could see him they wanted to offer him food they wanted all of this but he's walking with them and he says uh Brethren what kind of conversation is this that you are so sad W if I could just tell you we thought he was the Messiah we thought he was to deliver we thought this and this oh you fools and slow of heart ouch a little correction right there he called them fools and slow of heart but they didn't say well I don't know who you are but go walk on your own there was something that compelled them to hear and I and I know the scripture says that we're not to call men fools and I don't I don't like to be called one and I don't want to call people fools but my brother and sister if the Lord Jesus would come and speak to me tonight I don't know about you but if he would come and speak to me tonight I would say Lord you can call me a fool and slow of uh you know of heart here and and because it's Jesus and he knew what they need needed to hear another man walking up calling him a fool might have just upset them but there's anointing there amen and you know sometimes we we are definitely slow of heart and uh we look at this now the word as I go back here authorative encouraging but the word's also final the word brings a finality to our lives that we recognize you know this is who I am and and I want to uh I want to walk with the Lord amen it's not a matter just listening to the prophet today and my brother and sister you can say you have faith we can talk about faith I can this and I can that and I but my brother and sister Faith is something tangible amen faith has substance to it and as we look at this we realize there has to be something in us now we can't go get a bucket full of Faith it's not how it works but the prophet of God says you know what it's in you faith is in you and so as we'll see that we're walking along here and we realize you know what I I I I have faith amen I I'm I'm going to just you know as it were be bold tonight I have faith in fact I have all the faith I need to make the Rapture what I got to do is get me out of the way and let the word come and as the word comes my faith is increasing but then every once in a while the devil gets us to volunteer to put our s back in our own way and then we become Our Own Worst Enemy and our faith declines as our fears and anxieties rise and so it's a very simple equation that Satan has figured out so apt that I can just come and cause or toss the cares of this life in your way my way toss it out front of these people and it's going to hinder their faith I don't even have to I don't even have to you know do these devilish things I'll just let them trip their own self but what he doesn't realize is the word of God has already declared that we are positionally placed amen so as we look at this and realize more and more it's not about what we claim we are it's about what God said we are cuz we can claim a lot lot of things but when God said it amen he never fails amen so you know we look at this now it's whether we're in the uh very center of the road or whether we are On The Fringe uh as it were the um prodical son we're more naturally attracted to the man who's never wavered stood solid all the days of his life in church faithful all the Commandments in other words we would have loved the Rich Young Ruler just like Jesus did but the prodical son once he found his position was just as valuable actually more so because one relied on his own Revelation and one well looked like he was a wreck yeah but he wasn't positionally Place imagine tonight we don't want to justify these things but it's it's really interesting when you look at this just very focused that um the prodical son was positionally placed for a season in a pig pin now we'd have a hard time saying praise God my son is in a pig pin no we don't see it that way way but God said you know I'm going to the song was good tonight cuz it just fit right in more of you he's down there in the pig pin let's just call it what it is he's a backslid message boy in a pig pin positionally placed in other words there was no other place for him to be at that time my that should actually give us a little bit of a of a happy understanding that sometimes you know little things happen in our lives and we say Lord why why did this why did I do this why did I think this or what action and this and that but to remember God's perfect we're not and god is perfect so if he positionally places you in the midst of a certain circumstance don't be moaning crying and whatever how horrible life is is I'm down in the valley and it's just so terrible down here maybe we ought to lift our hands up and say you know what all I see is a bunch of stinking seaweed and but you know what let's see I'm going to orient myself somehow and I'm going to pray to Jerusalem I'm going to pray that God would be here there's got to be something good come out of this I am not going to die in the belly of a whale and it turns out that was God's plan the whole time to place him right there we look at as a backslid preacher who wouldn't do what God told him to do but God knew he wouldn't do that and God said why I know the nature of humanity will not follow my word the first time every time so I just make the way for him to come that my will be done and the prophet brings that out so happily over and over again in the message showing us amen that no matter what we stumble and fumble and all about that we'll find that in the end we fill exactly what God called us to do and I say tonight my brother and sister we're called to be the bride of Christ Eternal Witnesses amen not temporal Witnesses Eternal Witnesses called to witness in this generation we sometimes don't think that our light shines very good but the darker it gets the more the light shines so even a little light will shine a long ways reminds me of a story years ago about a man he he um he crashed a little airplane he had a little experimental plane and I don't know he's down in the edge of California Nevada down there and and was just flying when I say crashed I I don't know the little something happened he has to set the plane down and it won't fly again and uh but he sees a light in the distance and he says well I'm saved all I have to do is walk to the light turned out that light was 80 miles away that's how much a little light that's right will shine in the darkness amen that's what we're positionally placed for we don't have to go out and say I need to be a super Christian and convince convince everyone just let my light shine Lord right amen and let there be more of you so this prodical son did he not have an expected end yes sir God knew exactly and what's sad about that story is a son who is there faithful the whole time instead of rejoicing got angry that that person got delivered right it seems hard it's hard to comprehend why would he be angry that his brother got delivered yeah but you see sometimes selfish Spirits they tend to work their way in and we tend to feel like wait pardon me but I'm more spiritual than you sister Carrie so that's why they make the platform taller so I can look down on you you see how Spirits are people will create their own platform so they can spiritually look down on someone else that's right and yet God said the expected end is ex exactly the same amen Lord help us Lord help us Amen in fact the scripture says we should prefer our brother that means in essence for this example we look up to them and lift them up that's great and so you look at that we realize what God's doing he is positionally placing us everyone no matter what we're going through today we're positionally placed amen for a positive outcome so as we could go back to the scripture and read it again but God has said I know my thoughts is't that wonderful I'm glad that my thoughts amen are subject to God's thoughts and not the other way around and I'm glad that my thoughts being subject to God's thoughts doesn't mean that you're subject to my thoughts because we'd have a real problem here amen so we have this expected end but look how Satan comes he he comes along and says if if you don't mind can I share a little something with you I'd like to join this conversation I actually can I borrow your notebook I actually have a little list here of some of your faults and um if you need I could turn here to this page and and share this one from um oh 10 months 3 weeks and 2 days ago I thought I had faith I thought I was an overcomer I thought remember greatest battle ever fought yeah amen that battle amen as I used for an example is finished it's done it's gone we can't change it and neither can the devil but the Lord Jesus already did amen so we look at this and Satan's still trying to put us back in a position that God has run us and I'm going to just speak in this Essence to my own life we have become sick and tired of being sick and tired of a position that we were in and God allowed that we get to the place like oh oh you know um I I don't know about this you know iniquity it just eats me up you know God's right there behind it saying yep just let the iniquity move let it flow amen amen just let iniquity roll through your life and then one day you wake up and say I'm done yeah I am done I'm tired of dealing with this Lord I need deliverance and I need it now and the prophet of God said God moves when we get desperate amen and so we come to places in our life and what is God doing he's positionally placing Us in the devil's mind we are not perfect in our own mind we are not perfect but we should have come in the position where our soul knows that we are perfect because he is perfect amen that we are righteous because he is righteous and that's the only way my brother and sister we will ever be perfect only way we'll ever be righteous is because we'll look to him and he is the word from the beginning and when he said that you're perfect in me then we need to say I'm in the right position I'm in the position that I can now say Lord you said I never did it in the first place and I don't desire to do it again but you might that's right but God says it's about the desire so we get in the right position that God puts us Works us into and we stand in that position and he is strong when we are weak hallelujah amen and no other place no other time he's not going to be strong when you're strong only time you'll be strong is when you're completely in him and then he can shine forth so we look at this now see Satan wants us to see his way I'm sad to say there's been a lot of times I sat down with the devil oh and I read the book yes but then God comes and says what are you reading you're on the road to emus what are you talking about and why are you sad amen they share the story what did it do it took a faithful loving God to First rebuke them and then start pouring into them that's right that when it all come down and they recognized him they ran back to the city that's right why they were then positionally placed the Revelation that they'd had before of what Jesus was going to do for them was a man anointed Revelation it was not what God wanted them to see he wasn't coming as the kind of Mighty conqueror that they interpreted to be but he came as a mighty conqueror he came as the Conqueror and they interpreted that in a fleshly mind way and said oh great they're going to kick everybody out of the country it's going to be ours again but God was there and finally showed these men I have come I have fulfilled it I've done the word now it's your turn have you ever done something in life maybe went hiking with friends somebody scrambles up some Rocky Trail and you actually realize I'm not really capable of scrambling up that you know I hand coordination ey foot coordination amen we're joking about doing exercise a little bit and realize you know what people can do um I'm sorry I just struggle to lift this body off the ground it's just what it is and you see some people with two fingers over a bar and I'm over there going can they lower the bar I'd rather try to push it up than pull it down you see we're not in their position that's right but they're not in our position that's right and and physical strength will not get you in a Rapture but spiritual conditioning will train us hone Us in to where we actually can take the word and accomplish exactly what God wants done with the word amen now Romans 8:1 14-19 for as many as are uh as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God now to me that is so beautiful because it gives a very definitive very clearcut line that when we are led by the spirit of God that can only be so because we are sons of God so God doesn't allow now now uh please bear with me when I say this God does not allow imitation there are imitators but it's not nothing to do with God that is that is Satan trying to trying to catch the eye of the people but God in the midst of a holy ghost atmosphere will not allow imitation you say but brother Paul the imitation there but remember the classes of people a Son of God daughter of God God does not let them imitate the word he will and now for a simple example he will send you on the road to emus and he'll straighten you out has he done it he's faithful isn't he and we should tonight be saying Thank You Lord that we've had a road to emus and you called us slow of heart and foolish and and you dealt directly with us but we now have Revelation that we have understanding to see what the plan of God is and we can step into that plan we don't have to imitate it any longer we occupy it it's who we are it's what God has brought us to be not in transitional form now you could say a sinner being saved a drunk being saved becoming faithful Son of God is Transitional but my brother and sister it's not really it's Revelation that's right what was already in him is slowly being revealed transitional is when something becomes intellectual and the more intellectual we become the greater the picture is and we transition into a picture but that picture painted fire won't do anything for us so as the painter painted the painted fire there might have been inspiration behind that but it didn't even hardly warm up the painter maybe other than his physical brush stroke the next man comes it won't do a thing for him but when you get a real positionally placed Son of God he changes the atmosphere of where he is at if we'll stand for what we believe not back down not cower but just stand for what we believe we change the atmosphere of where we're at amen see we've not received a spirit of bondage uh to fear but we've re received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father now my brother and sisters so much difference between a servant of the house and the son amen when we come to the place that we can cry ABA father my father my father my brother and sister they we don't need a priest to get us there we don't need an anointed preacher to get us there now the anointed minister is all part of God's plan but amen we have our positionally placed place or position this is this is where I'm supposed to be God's going to feed you he promised I'm never leave you I'll never forsake you I've never left my children begging bread amen so coming spiritually we come to this place that we've receive the spirit of adoption let's not adoption become just a Doctrine a subject we talk about don't let it just become a a cliche word that we put out there we become adopted my brother and sister let's be adopted not just talk about adoption but be adopted whereby we cry ABA father and the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God now see I like the wording of it the spirit itself beareth witness with our SP Spirit what if it didn't would we just be fools and slow of heart or maybe it never would but this scripture is telling you this is God this evening Saints this is God talking to you this is not Paul talking to you this is God talking to you and he's telling you that his Spirit Bears witness with your spirit amen that we are the children of God and if children then we're heirs Heirs of God joint heirs with Christ it so be that we suffer with him that we may also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings the sufferings that's right absolutely yes sir of this present time that's today that's Wednesday night at whatever time this might be here of this present time are not even worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us and when the this bride recognizes who she is that's right then she stops and says praise God the wheels fell off the wagon I'm a Son of God a daughter of God Amen might even be as far as the house burnt down it doesn't matter I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God lost my job it doesn't matter I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God Amen because there's nothing we can suffer that's greater than the suffering that brought us here for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God so you look at that my brother and sister and realize now now maybe Excuse Me Maybe I'm looking a little Prejudice because I've been studying it along this line but my brother and sister when I look at this I see uh someone LED he's positionally placed if he's being led he's been positionally placed and and when they receive you have to be in the right place to receive and everything down through here is about us being positionally placed and when we're positionally placed God comes on the scene and honors his word and it changes our life He blesses us and so as you look at this we realize that every bit of this is all about us being positionally placed now I simplify this because it's much deeper than this but my brother and sister when we catch the whole revelation of being positionally placed all the rest of the gospel and the message Falls right in place it will just it'll just just come and lay itself right out before us as long as we're fighting against the placing that's right then we cannot receive the blessing so God's wanting us to realize that people are I I'm praying that God would bless us we need a blessing in our household in our family in our finances in our health and and that but we're not positionally placed and God says oh I'm not a spoiled father I'm sorry I'm not going to bless you until you get in your correct place it's kind of like parents you know their kid won't eat his supper and they say well no dessert cuz you didn't eat your supper but 30 minutes later the boy sitting at the table eating dessert you're never going to place that child ever he's going to realize I can just do what I want to do and my parents will give in I'm sorry our our father is not going to give in he's not going to turn us into spoiled children we have to be under leadership headship and without being under headship remember the prophet of God just listening the last few days different tapes brother brandom is talking about that and he's there and he's talking about the Holy Spirit moving and people people that would not receive it it just moved right on they needed healing brother Brown says you you have gallbladder problem you you need but they're not believing the Holy Spirit just moves on imagine they hurt themselves let me focus and drill on that for just a moment when we get a stubborn Spirit who are we hurting right right no one but ourself now the collateral damage might be a wife and children or a husband and children or just children or just wife or husband but what we're really hurting is our s because I can pick a fight with the wife I've done that a couple times I actually am quite experienced um at the end of the day I get her upset but who did I hurt I hurt her but I really actually hurt myself yeah the most because then when I get Com when I want Comfort I get chaos my brother and sister I hope that made sense so as we look at this we go down we receive the spirit of adoption we become Heirs of God joined airs with Christ we suffer with him we will be glorified with him so the sufferings of this present time are not even worthy to be put on the same page for an Earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God see what it's doing there's a lot of the word my brother and sister let me just kind of nutshell this CU it's pretty big topic but there's a lot of the word that's not really open alive and effective to us because we've not allowed ourselves to come to spiritual maturity yeah and God's not going to give us Authority without maturity and so when we want to see the word really open to us then we should be laying in the presence of the son get mature and as long as we choose to remain immature then the seed will not reproduce itself let me hurry up and go on here in the Paradox and if you notice these Hebrew mothers let me just preface this with a little bit what I want to bring out of this is is what I would call uh principle I'm not really so much focused on the Hebrew mothers it's the principle of what they're doing those Hebrew mothers when they was in labor and gave birth to those Patriarchs I'll get on that one of these days the Lord willing gave birth to those Patriarchs when she spoke their name in labor she also positionally place them in their place in the Kingdom oh my inspiration is a paradox see you you just can't catch it but it's inspired and God moves it right along into its place just at the hour when you think not and I want to tell you my brother and sister from the foundation of the world Amen before there was one Speck of Stardust amen now we look at this and and please bear with me I I just want to lay this out in a fashion that is kind of natural to us when God was speaking a amen the heavens into position he was giving birth he was giving birth to all of this and and when you go listen to birth pains you'll realize God was actually experiencing a pain as it were as he's speaking these things into existence it's coming out of him what was in him contained in him is now coming out of him like a natural birth coming out and and there is and it's not just like oh let there be a Milky Way oh let there be but God was like I want this I need this I want to I want to have my children my bride needs a a earth to live on she needs all of these things and they're being birthed out of him are you with me amen and so there it was he's there and there not a speck of Stardust out here and he birthed your name into the Lamb's Book of Life no simple thing my brother and sister the lamb had to die to put put our name in the book and he birthed it but you realize also in that birthing when he spoke your name and to the Lamb's Book of Life he positionally placed you and I and he chose you and I to be right here on this Earth at this time in a time of wars and rumors of wars a time of insanity a time of people double-minded a time of I I don't need to go through all of that a time though and God said I birth you amen right into this day and we think we go through pain but we've read this scripture that says his suffering we're not even our suffering is not even worthy to be compared so he births us into leoda and he says in leoda this son this daughter they shall experience this you see positionally placed wasn't just being throwed into Le O deia my brother and sister positionally placed is every tragedy every hard time every bitter tear every suffering we have faced and every blessing that we've ever been blessed with all of that was poured out at that time positionally placing us and he said I'm going to prepare them I'm going to prepare them to overcome everything of the greatest mind battle ever and the age all the darkness everything and as he speaks out our name and we are birthed into our position God suffered amen it wasn't just Calvary my brother and sister God suffered to put us in our right position amen that's it and so it is positionally placed spoken of God thank you Lord for putting us in this position amen my brother and sisters I I've heard people say well it would have been good maybe it been the Philadelphian age it might have been good to and whatever else my brother and sister they had their own trials that's right and they didn't have as much Revelation as we have they were still you might say living a slightly blind story that's right our story is revealed our story is right here every bit of word is open it's alive we can look back we can by God's grace look forward amen no Philadelphia or any of the other ages could look and see a bride going up that's right in a vision that's it and the prophet represented that we were in that Vision right talk about being amen perfectly placed amen thank you Lord for placing me in the vision that I can see myself by Revelation that I'm in that Vision amen excuse me I stumbling around a little bit I just keep getting beside myself amen positionally place names because of no other reference I I just use this but my mother as I was growing up said I named you Paul Daniel because I knew one day you'd be a preacher and then later she would say well sometimes I thought you'd be a preacher cuz you just would never shut up so you know maybe not too much spirituality in that but I use that as an example because every one of us and our name was spoke out we couldn't be named any other name right right that's right and the reason brother Bram didn't like the Ricky and whatever is what those names represented so our names are important you saywell I don't know that I really like my name so much well praise God live with it you know bear it amen there's a sister up in Canada that we know she said when she was a teenage girl in school her name is Sister Edna and she said you know it just she got harassed oh what an oldfashioned name it's such a German name one day she woke up and said wait I'm German there's nothing wrong with this name all that matters is I'm a daughter of God Amen and I've been positionally placed amen oh praise the Lord amen hallelujah now look here I need to hurry along Jehovah Gyra see we have to be what we are see that can be used as an excuse well I am just who I am yeah that's right I'm mean I'm rude I'm a slob I just have to be who I am no that's nonsense we have to be what we are gifts and callings are without repentance when you're born in this world before the world world ever began God knew you positionally placed you and if that isn't so then the Bible isn't so that's exactly God put our names on the Lamb's Book of Life not when you come to the altar but before the foundation of the world that's right that's what the Bible said Thank You Lord that I was there in birth pains my name was spoken and placed in the book Hallelujah God spoke us out into the heavens amen before it was before the foundation of the world God spoke our names into the heavens amen isn't this how precious this is you talk about God writing or laying out a clear picture to you and I how he planned so carefully to put us in the bride in the Rapture it's not some accident no some Churches some denominations think you just fortunate that you got saved no I'm actually very happy I'm got saved don't misunderstand but you see it never was my decision right right never was my decision God if I I don't want to overemphasize this but God in birth pains called out my name amen amen and when he called out my name there had to be something to respond amen and that something was that seed in my soul seed in your soul Hallelujah let's go here amen uh I didn't go ahead and write this one down it won't be there brother Isaac I'll just read I just go ahead and read this the God who is rich in Mercy uh 1 in 19 of 65 and he never fails to fulfill what he promised I once was young and now I'm old I've never seen him fail in his word because he can do anything but fail he cannot fail God cannot it's impossible for God to fail and remain God he has to do that now my brother and sister you see we fail and we're still his bride that's exactly right if God failed he can't be God that's right right that's called Grace and God is the one who set all of that in Motion in other words God bound himself amen I can't make even one mistake so that's why the word is perfect from beginning to end and people Through the Ages not to go off into this but people Through the Ages say that applied for that time that applied for this that applied for that that isn't and we're deciding where it applied and didn't apply but God said it applied and we as the bride having his seed Gene say that applies to me I'm I identified in that position and it isn't whether it fit our little box or not right it's because God said so that's right amen God is the only one that can't fail he can't fail it's one thing God can't do is fail God is the word and the word no matter how it looks like it's going to come this other way it'll come just exactly the way the word said amen amen I I want to revisit that prodical son for just a moment took his father's inheritance to him and squandered it rightest living is he positionally placed or is this a mistake no I think it should change our way of looking at things just a little bit amen prodical son a problem or placed amen amen the circumstance just happened upon him or was it in God's plan now this is redundant but bear with me was it accident or ordered see we can't have it both ways right that's right we are either positionally placed of God right NE place the prophet talking along this line we're either positionally placed of God or we're lost amen it's exactly we can't have it both ways thank you Lord amen amen 1 Corinthians 10th chapter 13th verse sister via would you come thank you there's no hath no no temptation taking you oh I know I get too personal and I'm trying to break my habit but have any of us had a Temptation overtake us I mean let's we might as well just have a little laugh associated with this because anything else would be a lie so so we've all had a Temptation overtake us that we we just have fallen under that but here the scripture when we interpret it correctly we can come up with this other conclusion there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to Bear it amen God will positionally place you and I for a positive outcome amen amen there's nothing can come upon us that is going to cause us to fall away from the word we can't we are the word he is the word and he is in us any way you want to put it my brother and sister oh I got the Holy Ghost he is in you amen it's not another it is our Lord himself in US amen and we look at this and realize everything that's happened in our life there's been times not so much anymore I seem to be beyond that but there was a time I was married I have three children my kids are in school I had such regret that I did not finish school that I didn't apply myself that I was rebellious and one day I woke up and it just Dawns on me I don't need to have regret I don't need to look back back that's right that was a path that God said I want you to walk down that's exactly not an excuse kids do your studies especially you young lady no oh and you smile that smile you too you're oh you're on the list too oh no see God knew the story when he spoke our name he knew the whole story oh but brother Paul we do have some opportunity to make decisions on our own well I'll tell you what they will those decisions I'm talking about people with a real seed Gene of God in them those decisions might make the journey difficult but they're not going to make the journey incomplete that's right aren't you glad tonight our God is so perfect he knows just exactly how to place us where to place us and then how to encourage us to fulfill the word amen I want to say tonight I believe everyone here Grace Tabernacle tonight has been positionally placed for a positive outcome Hallelujah I believe that amen let's sing uh uh the original life 462 amen we just ask our brother Alex and this song popped up to me and I thought man I could have just kept this sermon really short if we would have just quoted the words out of this song exactly you guys could already been home having some toast and [Music] tea well I'm not I'm not allowed to talk about ice cream anymore so I have to something but you know the thing is is here's the beauty of it God reinforces anointing
