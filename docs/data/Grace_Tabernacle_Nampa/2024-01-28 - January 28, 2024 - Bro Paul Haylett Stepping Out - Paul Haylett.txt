amen greetings to our visitor I believe if I understood correctly a friend of brother Tim so pray the Lord just bless you today amen each and every one of you so happy to see each one and uh just uh a couple momentary things I want to just put up on the on the uh highlight in case somebody has missed it uh we have put everything in place I say we I didn't have anything to do with it but anyway uh for the Youth banquet on uh April the 20th brother Steven McNeely will be our speaker and uh we just look forward to that so those of you that are uh social network type people just share that uh those young people in the Northwest Mountain West um we just want them to know that this is taking place and also just a early warning on the radar uh that Family Camp will once again be uh on that Father's Day weekend um I my brain slips I think that's around 13th through 17th and uh so just you know if you got to apply for time off uh if uh you need to arrange your life I just encourage you to uh apply for the time off arrange for that uh we had such a lovely time last year I I know that I thoroughly enjoyed myself and uh maybe that was partly because I didn't have to do anything but be a be there amen you know and uh but I can say the brothers did a wonderful job last year and I am fully in faith that it will be a wonderful time this year with our brother Dan stemon being our speaker amen I miss sister Carrie she's in Arizona City she's in Arizona yes wor warm yes yes Sydney is just the excuse amen let's turn in our Bibles today good to see each and every one of you it's once again good to be home and thank you musicians thank you brother Alex um amen Proverbs the 16th chapter veres 1-9 I had so many titles for this thought um was pulled this way and that way and I just shortened them all down to the simple title of stepping out and um there Comes A Time my brother and sister that we just have to step out uh it it's a two-sided thought in that realm sometimes we just got to step out of the things of this world Amen you got to just detach yourself from that and some times when it comes to the things that God is doing in our presence in our lives we have to step out we step out in faith every day amen and you know if you're not stepping out in faith then I I'm just actually going to pray that God challenges you greater that causes you to step out in faith to claim the promise and and be able to step into that promise that he's given Proverbs the 16th chapter verses 1-9 the preparation of the heart in man and the answer of the tongue is from the Lord all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes but the Lord weth the spirits commit thy Works unto the Lord and thy thoughts shall be established you know in a day that we're living in that Satan is fighting against the mind in all aspects my brother and sister never an age that so many people and I'm not speaking down on this but it's just a a spirit of the age never been an age like this where we need help to wake up we need help to go to sleep we need help to have Clarity and and people would say well that that's that's that's a bad thing but it's an Evidence of the Battleground that Satan chose amen he chose to to fight against the mind uh and so if we'll just commit our works unto the Lord th thoughts shall be established the Lord hath made all things for himself yay even the wicked for the day of evil everyone that is proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord uh though hand made uh though hand join in hand he shall not be unpunished but mercy and Truth iniquity by Mercy and Truth iniquity is purged and by the fear of the Lord men depart from Evil when a man's ways please the Lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him better is a little with rightous nness than great revenues without right a man's heart deviseth his way but the Lord directeth his steps Heavenly Father we ask for your blessings upon this thought today bless the Saints father Lord all those who are not here today brother Isaac sister christen's children not feeling well father we ask you to be with them if there be any that were missed today Father we just ask that your Holy Spirit would just go out speak to hearts Lord Lord give us strength to serve you I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated you know the scripture tells us that there is a season for everything under the sun and as we look in the world that we live in today uh I would say this is certainly a season for us to have confidence in God it is a time when the world is so troubled my brother and sister you can go very easily very quickly on the computer and and uh just ask it to give you the results of recent polls and you'll find that they have a poll for almost everything in the world today they have polls on how many Christians uh uh take their Bible to church they have polls on how many people believe the future of our nation is at risk and a poll for everything and often times if we're not careful we get caught up in the the uh atmosphere you might say of the season that we're living in but you know it is there that we are called by the word of God in this season a season that has been prophesied to uh bring about these things uh it's just time for us simply to step out and say you know Lord I'm not going to look at news I'm not going to look at the financial world I'm not going to look at what's going on around us I'm simply going to look at your word and I'm going to have confidence in that word amen and I will say it this way I I know this from a personal point that a little trust in the Lord goes a long way in our life amen we don't have to be some Supernatural super spiritual person you know that's always got a great manifestation of something going on around us but sometimes just a simple trust before you go out the door in the morning to say Lord I give this day to you and ask you to just guide my footsteps and keep me today and you know it actually changes your atmosphere now I I for one like to get up in the morning and at some point in the morning there I I like to go and kind of see what the news is in the world I like to kind of see just a more of curiosity I don't use it to influence what I think or what direction I'm going but I'm really wanting to see just what the world is doing today and you know when you look at that my brother and sister if you take that to heart you walk out the door of your house with a very negative atmosphere about you they're they're projecting the economy to decline they're projecting that this to fail and that to fail but I'll tell you one thing that they don't ever talk about is the fact the word of God cannot fail amen and and as we are there you look at this and realize God's in control the scripture just said that he directs our steps now we make plans I I I'm a firm believer I I don't know where you stand but I trust you should be a firm believer you make plans for tomorrow amen you you work you buy a house you pay for that house you you make a good responsible decisions and you do all of that believing that the coming of the Lord is imminent believing that the coming of the Lord could be this very day but we don't just sit down and we don't just say well the Lord's in control I'll do nothing no if the Lord's truly in control then you will come to him and present your future and then let him guide that future amen so it's time as I said to have confidence in God Amen and in a world we live in today I just looked at a recent poll I found it disturbing less and less Christians are believing the word of God is infallible I want that to soak in if this is not infallible what part do we trust and what part do we distrust some would say well I trust Ed and it didn't work maybe you didn't take the right attitude to the word if God said no and you were sure it should be yes maybe you won't trust the Lord but you see calling back to our scripture you see if we devise our way and we believe that God should follow our footsteps you're going to be disappointed but if you're willing to make plans and then say Lord give me wisdom give me direction Lord guide me then you will find that God will take you through circumstances I I could give so many uh examples in my own life that that uh would just take all of our time but there's been times in my life I was certain of a certain direction and then things didn't go that way things didn't happen the way that I thought and at the time I have to to tell you I was disappointed but just a few short years down the road I realized how much God had had his hand on my life because a few short years down the road I realized if it had worked the way I wanted it to work I had just moved disappointment from there to here I would have just moved struggle from there to here but you see God knew what today would be what we thought 5 years ago 10 years ago we can look back now and know what was the perfect will of God to make the right decision amen you know I I look at Luke 24 when you get a look back down the road Luke 24 is speaking of those on the road to emus and here was these brothers they're walking down the road to emus and they're speaking one to another of the struggles that they've had and how that they were sure that Christ would have delivered Christ would have been the answer and the scripture says that they were sad they're reminiscing of what they have just experienced they've just saw their delivered the one they had faith and confidence in they've just saw him crucified and without Revelation my brother and sister the crucifixion is the end without understanding of the plan of God the crucifixion was the Finish they're walking down the road very sad I Can Only Imagine by by human nature that they're saying you know I thought that this would happen and he had said this and I was sure that that meant this and they're walking along there but the emphasis I want to give to you as they were walking along there not in Revelation not in joy not in happiness there was nothing in their hearts that was bubbling over but they were walking truly down the road H as a sad people and you know that you can by human nature just look at people how their body English is now I don't want this to sound creepy but if you ever look into those aspects of what body English means those people who know it very well you know they understand the very subtities of of people's movement and eye movements and hand movements head gesture posture all of these things and I'm telling you these two brothers were walking down the road to emus almost dragging their feet they were walking down that road in such a heavy load of disappointment of what could have been and should have been but did not happen they hardly even notice when one comes from the shoulder of the shadow of the road and comes and starts to walk with them but as he starts to speak to them they start to realize something a little different here something's going on and I I can just see them starting to react to the words that Jesus was speaking to them and as it is it starts to change an atmosphere aren't you glad we have Revelation to understand we can change atmosphere around us we can change atmosphere in our home sometimes as simple as putting on the right music will change the atmosphere sometimes picking up our Bible change the atmosphere picking up you know our praying would change the atmosphere we don't have to sit and dwell in that old sad and disappointed atmosphere but we can live in an atmosphere of joy and happiness and I'm glad today it's not psychology my brother and sister it's not something that man's doing but it's when we call the presence of God or open the door for the presence of God to come down with us in other words if you meet people that have a welcoming Spirit you feel welcome and if you meet people who have an unwelcoming Spirit you know what I'm talking about you don't have to like ask them do you have an unwelcoming Spirit you know that they don't want to talk to you they know you know that there that atmosphere is not conducive but my brother and sister you you can well I'll just give you a little example I was driving on the highway headed out towards our house and I noticed there's a pickup on the side of the road I noticed there's a man on this side of the road I noticed there's a woman on the other side of the road much closer to me and a little dog running down the middle of the road and this couple had been driving down there and and they saw the little dog dodging in and out of the traffic and a couple cars almost hitting it and and they admitted that they have a soft spot for animals so they pulled over they're trying to catch the little dog and and uh so I I put on the flashers and got out and we got the little dog to go over and one of the parking spaces off the side of the lake and and finally the little dog let the man catch him and and uh so we're we're just interacting and uh as we're talking I find out you know a little bit of where they live they were real very open people and where they live and um you know what happening in their life and um just uh a great interaction and as we close this out I don't even know why but something I just uttered God bless you and somebody poured cold water on us love lovely people but at the words of God bless you they got all stiff and awkward now I'm not judging them by that but I'm telling you atmosphere can change and just as sure as atmosphere can go chill atmosphere can be warmed amen and so we realize that the atmosphere as they're walking down the road to emus that they're talking about what could have been and this missed opportunity and uh you know they're going home to figure out what's next they're not going home to hold a Revival they're not going home to testify of Jesus Christ to their neighbor because Jesus Christ has just been crucified and the atmosphere that must have been with him but in that time in that atmosphere Christ said I'm going to come on the scene and that is what we should look for my brother and sister not what is wrong but we should should look for Christ coming on the scene we should be saying Lord I know you're real and I know you're here and I'm just opening myself up to receive you I I want to hear from you I need to change this atmosphere amen and you know as we look at this that's the reason the scripture tells us that uh there is uh uh the scripture saying without a vision the people perish and how many times I'm not expecting you to lift a hand but how many times has Satan come in and kind of tampered with our vision of who we are as Sons and Daughters of God and when that happens it it drastically changes how we see everything you know the devil Works in such a fashion he can take and turn positive things into negative in a snap of a finger but I'm here to tell you that the presence of the Lord will take those negative things and turn them positive and the snap of a finger we see people my brother and sister that have not been serving God for years the Holy Spirit come down and move in their presence and they break down and give their heart back to Christ my brother and sister when people thought this is the same as it's always been this will be what it will be to the coming of the Lord no my brother and sister you ever get someone in the presence of Jesus Christ it will change the atmosphere it will change their point of view it will change the direction of their lives but we live in a world we become so ingrained by the spirits of the age that we become a little bit cynical I don't expect anyone to raise their hand this morning but I believe I'm safe to say that if we're not careful we can find ourselves moving from a position of Faith to a cynic in a heartbeat people f fail us we fail us can someone say Amen we fail us it's easy to look at what they did and failed us but what about the time we fail us and how much that we fail our Lord Jesus Christ scripture says that we all come short of the glory of God this is not comparing us to them me to you you to me this is us looking at the word and saying you know what I wasn't called to fail my Lord amen and if I'm living a life that doesn't fail him then I'm not going to be living a life that fails me or my spouse or my children or my parents amen it is a point we have to figure out where we want to stand I say we have a vision and I'm going to speak real blunt this morning Grace Tabernacle what is our vision what is our vision do we do we want to come I I just was speaking to the young people a little a little bit tied together in thought but you know what is our vision today do we want to just be a church we come to we got come on Sundays we have some activities we have some fellowship it's good to beong or do we want to be a church that the holy spirit is comfortable in the Holy Spirit wants to be here with us and we want to be with him in his presence and and there atmosphere that we actually would cry out to God and say Lord when I get to church today let me be a contributor to the lick of fire let me be a contributor to the atmosphere positively now I realize Saints don't don't misunderstand me there's times that we come to church and if I could just do this figuratively there's times we come to church that we literally just need a little something but often times that's because we haven't dealt with the atmosphere before as we come into this position you don't don't deal with atmosphere Sunday morning you deal with atmosphere in the days before then you come in there you come fortified you come strengthened you come filled with the spirit of God come in the house of God now look I'm not preaching down on you I'm preaching to myself this morning amen are you okay with me preaching it myself today amen but we come and the difference then that it makes is we come and we're a contributor my lick of Fire tied with your lick of Fire tied with your lick of Fire tied with your lick of fire we come in the house of God and we say boy it was a good service today amen what is it because our lick of fire is not diminished by being in the house of God with other Saints but it's reinforced it's uh it's influenced to a greater calling amen you guys are quiet this morning Hallelujah that's all right I had a brother tell me we're quiet because we're eating amen just as long as you don't leave cracker crumbs in the church amen but you see we need a vision I want to ask you kind of directly as we're walking our road to emus is our conversation about what is wrong what is missing is our conversation about what is wrong here and what is wrong there our road to emus what are we talking about my brother and sister are we talking about how great it was to be in the house of God to be in the presence of the Lord are we talking about the positive things or are we talking about what is wrong cuz you know you can spoil a perfectly good conversation with criticism with a negative comment even a negative thought we can pull the power right out right amen the prophet taught us that the holy spirit's like a dove it it's not going to hang around while we're eating Buzzard food it's going to fly and sit on a limb and wait for us to get correct yes I tell you what I want the Holy Spirit to be in every service that's in this church I want the power of God not to be here that we're begging for God to come and do something but God's right here in our midst doing something amen can you say that's what I want to I want the power of God to be with me to walk with me and I can tell you right now I'll make a public confession the preacher sometimes has negative thoughts are you with me yeah amen none of us are exempt but we have the word we know what the word said and the word gave us a solution how to get our thoughts back on track to be thinking on the things of God to be coming to a place my brother and sister that the holy spirit says I'll meet you in there I'll meet you in there I'm telling you the song says that the cynic's not going to be there and the doubter is not going to be there the criticizer if I can just add some more to the the verses criticizer is not going to be there amen the unbeliever certainly won't be there the one that didn't do anything at all is not going to be there I want to be there can you say amen amen I want the word of God to be so alive in me that I'm not over here battling these things oh I I just don't even want to go I don't even want to do this I don't even want to do that I don't even I don't think I don't want to go to church I go to church amen there there is just uh I don't know there's a bunch of Hypocrites in church I seen a little deal the other day it's why it's why real Believers don't go to ball games have you guys seen that one do real Believers not go to ball games because of Doctrine it was a Twist on Words real Believers don't go to ball games because there's Hypocrites there and there's Liars there and the the pitcher and the coach didn't come visit me at home no it was actually turning this around uh throwing it back to people's excuses why they don't go to church amen so nobody's going to go to the ball games but the ball games are clear full yeah while the polls say that churches are getting emptier and emptier and emptier the ball game's getting Fuller and Fuller and Fuller now I I I'm just I hope you have a little humor this morning the average cost of a Major League baseball game in the cheap seats is now over $75 so we offer you very nice seating if you could just go ahead and um buy your ticket for this morning amen come on my brother and sisters see the world we're living in is full clear full of inequity of thought and emotion and reasoning so we find how Satan works his way in and he uh blurs the line that we feel this way about this but feel totally the opposite about something else and it is that we ought to have consistency amen hallelujah now I wasn't really honestly speaking about ball games I just wanted to make that point amen so as we look at this let our conversation be about what is right not what is wrong now we don't stick our head in the sand as a church or men of the church to have proper guidance and Direction but the same direction same thought Saints we don't spend our time focus on what's wrong amen you know if you study Moses Israel coming out of Egypt it's not very hard to come to the conclusion of what happened to all the people who only saw the negative now I'm not okay I don't know where this come from probably the devil no no you have a voice if there's things that ought to be in the church you have have a voice that's not what we're talking about I'm talking about everyday conversation everyday Spirit everyday attitude if the church is out of line Ministries out of line something's out of line you don't have to remain silent you don't have to feel muzzled you have a voice but our everyday life amen ought not be about what's wrong it ought to be about what's right amen amen I've got a promise in the word the Lord Jesus said I'll lead you and guide you into some of the truth some of the time no that's not what my Bible says my Bible says he promised he would lead me and guide me into all truth every single time amen I don't have to settle for less you don't have to settle for less amen so we look at this let's make sure our vision as a church is a correct vision amen our conversation is a correct conversation amen but the speaking of the word they're walking with this unknown character unnamed character this walking down the road to emus and he starts to speak to them can you remember the scripture kind of in your mind can you kind of bring that up did Jesus soft soap them he spoke kind of direct did he not you people of little faith no Revelation no understand have I been with you and this is what it produced he spoke very strongly he didn't cut them any slack he didn't baby them he didn't say oh maybe maybe when I was speaking The Sermon on the Mount I I I didn't express it corre right no sorry he spoke the word the word changed the atmosphere the the word changed their focus and the word started uncovering see Revelation was already in them but the word started shoveling all the doubts and all the fears that are trying to blanket Faith are we doing okay amen okay so what was what was the Lord doing amen they're Walking In The Presence of Jehovah and they in this walk as he's speaking the word something starts to change amen burdens are taken off they realize the word's still living the word didn't die at the crucifixion of Jesus Christ the word's still living it's still alive and they started to realize there is still something happening God is still doing a mighty work and so In The Presence of Jehovah they stepped out of the old atmosphere into a new atmosphere but it was subconscious now look I I I don't know if this is striking you today but my brother and sister s you don't have to lift a hand but how many times we come in the house of God we're burdened by a burden or we're burdened by an attitude or we have an issue with something and at the worship and the preaching of the word we actually feel our burden lightning we actually feel the atmosphere in ourself around ourself changing what is that that's the presence of Christ just as he was on the road to emus he's right here with us and it's changing our atmosphere on our road and as we're walking along he's coming now we might actually you might say be sitting but it is in this travel this road that we're going he comes and says I'm going to walk with you aren't you glad he'll walk with us amen he's not just sitting back as a God in the heavens somewhere letting us just labor and labor and labor but he comes down and he walks with us and he talks with us us amen you know had somebody one time say well I don't think the Lord's everever spoke to me and I I I me how how are you going to answer but we just go on in conversation just go on in conversation oh yeah let me share this with you I was in my hometown and I was going through there and I just started to go in the intersection and I don't know why I paused car behind me honked and and then I started to go and a car completely run that red light went through the intersection 50 m an hour if I had just been 20 feet farther forward I would have been broadsided I'm thinking God doesn't speak to you oh you know I the other day my little granddaughter got sick and you know we were thinking do we take her to the doctor or not do we take her to the doctor or not and then we decided we should just lay hands on her we're Believers and we do what believers do what do believers do they believe amen so we we just you know decided we're going to just lay our hands on on our little granddaughter and then they prayed for their little granddaughter and 30 minutes later she's over there in the closet tearing the toys out playing with them but God doesn't speak to me you see what happens is Satan has tried to redefine what the voice of God is in our life we need some kind of outright voice that is echoing booming off the walls almost like driving down the the freeway and and the sign changes and says Paul no we don't need that my brother and sister we need need to become sensitive to the moving of the Holy Spirit he's walking with us amen do we believe that is a promise today he's walking with us if he is walking with us my brother and sister we are hearing we are directed in our footsteps by him and and so Satan will come and say well God hasn't spoken to you yes he has yes he has you read your Bible you say Amen to it you sing the songs of praise and your heart is stirred God is speaking Satan is trying to redefine what the voice of God is in our generation amen it is not a cultural voice my brother and sister it's not even a religious voice amen God is Not veiled in religion he's veiled in his word amen religion as we're speaking to the young adults is a covering amen now it's one thing you can feel religious and not be out of the will of God but just cuz you feel religious doesn't mean you're in the will will of God that silenced y'all so they stepped out of the presence of the old into the presence of the new subconsciously you'll see it wasn't until he broke bread that they become conscious of who was in their presence they walked down the road the atmosphere being changed subconsciously you see the atmosphere had to be changed on the road so that when they were breaking the bread they could receive it he didn't come at that moment and break the atmosphere and then open their eyes he was already opening their eyes by the conversation of the word see how that shows us how important our conversation is amen so the Lord was directing their steps you know what they didn't receive my brother and sisters the crucifixion of Christ the preaching of the word The Sermon on the Mount and all these other oper opportunities what they didn't receive there God didn't say well I guess you're not mine you didn't get it no he said I've got a Divine appointment with two brothers on the road to emus and I'm going to meet them there because they're mine they're sons of God I'm going to meet them there and I'm going to use them to become a witness or a testimony that God will meet you where you're at amen God didn't say well I'll just wait till they get back in church sometime no he went to them aren't you glad yes I'm telling you I look at my own life and just realize how gracious God is to meet you where you're at amen it's no less significant if he met you on the backside of the farm he met you in the park he met you walking out to a mailbox that's irrelevant my brother and sister the fact is he met you amen people are like I I got saved in this great big church here I got saved over here under this ministry that's well and good I'm not going to fault that but that has no more significance than the one who's in the cow pasture and God met him yeah come on let's be honest with ourselves the before during and after I think every one of us that's old enough to comprehend this sees the before the during and the after amen Corinthians 2 Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold All Things become new isn't that a lovely scripture I I like that scripture it is to me a very significant scripture to give us the understanding as we walk on our road to emus we get to step out in faith that having met Christ he's changed our life and we get to meet him by privilege again and again and again and we're constantly being changed the old things are passing away and those things are becoming new you know it was by the opening of the word our lives were changed now my brother and sister this might be subject to opinion I don't mind if you view it from a different angle I've kind of got caught up with the analogy that we sometimes struggle that I don't see it like you see it well let's just park a horse right here in the middle of the church okay y'all mind if our imaginary AI horse is now standing here in the middle of the church is that okay now you guys on that end he's he's facing you tell me what you see ears eyes nose horse lips chest but the brother say brother Trevor's over here looking at it now from the left side and you say well I see I see you know certain colored eye or something I see a little scar on the nose brother Trevor is going to say I don't see that what I see is a sweat mark from a cinch and maybe a a certain little Mark on the horse and I see this and I see that and I see a a little scar on the back of the left front and you'll be up there saying I don't see that now we're going to ask somebody that's over here on this side of the horse what do you see and it's going to be entirely different than what they saw and then there's poor old Paul cuz I was late to the show I'm looking at the tail and you know what your doctor about that horse head is not my Doctrine cuz there is no horse head on this end of the horse there is a big fat rump with a tail amen that's what I see same horse but we get so caught up in what we see and how we see it that it must be the way I see it it's the same horse and if you shift your position you'll have a different vision or if the horse shifts to a different position you have a different Vision same horse now look at us around the message fussing over I see this I don't see that I don't know where he's coming from that's not what I see come on let's have enough Grace for one another to say you know Lord maybe I need to look at this from a different point of view maybe I will see I'm not talking about false doctrines and lying Spirits I'm talking about good good people living Godly lives looking at the word and we're judging them because we don't see what they see or they don't see what we see and it's there that we need to stop sometimes and say is this not the same God that called you is the same God that called them is this not the same vision of making a Rapture and standing in the presence of God that they have that I have and if we would have a little more grace for one another but stay totally on the word amen I'm not talking about compromise I'm talking about as it were pardon me tying this back to analogy I can walk up and I can lay it's not very smart actually if you're a horse person you know you don't go up and put your hand on a horse's rump from behind because they have this mechanism and you don't want to experience that but properly go I I can lay my hand on the horse brothers let's come together I I can lay my hand it's a horse it's a horse it's a horse it's a horse we don't argue that it's the word but our argument sometimes is Anointed of the devil about how we see the word it's still the same word are you guys able to handle that amen see what the devil's trying to do is he's coming here the scripture says trying to drive a wedge in the body of Believers he's trying to drive have a wedge amongst it and my brother and sister we were taught if you're eating the Cherry Pie I draw I always draw my wife into this sorry about this folks but you know few years ago we had a little Cherry Pitter thing there and the cherries were extremely small and Paul was pitting cherries and Paul wanted to be done with this job Paul is pitting cherries there's so many cherries I'm tired of pitting cherries and I quit really looking about what I was actually doing and then down the road ways my wife makes a cherry pie and I first piece out of the pie pit second bite out of the pie pit I think there was like 20 pits in one piece of pie now get this how we are as Believers sometimes Jerry what did you do with this pie she sits there for a moment you pitted the cherries I just have a hard time admitting this is my fault it surely is the one who made the Pie's fault she she should have known their husband was incompetent at pitting cherries but but you see my brother and sister how the Devil comes in I hope you all love me when I'm done with this statement we just didn't have a very good service today I wonder what the deal was with the pastor do a better job of pitting your cherries yes sir do a better job of praying before you come to church bring a different atmosphere spere to church come on you guys don't want me to be the atmosphere police amen hallelujah I don't like the way you're slouched bad attitude here I'm in different Spirit here you just no no that's not what it's about it's what the holy spirit's doing in our life it's God speaking to you it's not Paul speaking to you it's what God is speaking to you and what we bring to church is not the evidence of the priest preacher my brother and sister what we bring to church is the evidence of you pitting your cherries don't want pits in your pie want the holy spirit in church service amen we have to give our part amen you know Sister Jerry she handled that quite well didn't she I told her what do we do about it I hope you catch my thought here she said you can go back through and repit every single Cherry no I'll pick them out of the pie that's all right I'll just pick them out of the pie you see often times we actually come to that position what I should have took care of here we choose to just kick the can down the road I know I made a bad decision I could fix it I'll fix it later now who does that influence I don't want to point it at You me pushing it down the road and not dealing with it doesn't just impact me it impacts every one of you we come to church with an attitude with things in our lives thinking it's just my problem it's not it changes the whole atmosphere Lord help us are you all still in love with me is that okay come on it's time for us Saints to step out of our old position to step into the word and say you know what I know a way to deal with this I know a way to come to the house of God with my fire burning I know a way to come into the house of God and be a contributor something that will change the lives of those around me my neighbors on each side and behind and whatever is the scripture says that when we're I'm interpreting this here when we're in our right position it even makes our enemies our friends that's quite a thing in the world we live in today my brother and sister to be able to have an atmosphere of the holy spirit that will even change the atmosphere of people who think they don't like you and contain that amen are we called the chaos we are not called to chaos now we're called we're going to have battles come on I want you to see the difference between you having a battle and you living in chaos amen there's a lot of difference amen how many of you would want to end job any volunteers to be job man we're sure timid this morning aren't we but see God never even gave job any warning God goes over here and opens a hedge and job finds himself camels stolen oxen stolen donkeys stolen sheep stolen children crushed and everybody's like you got secret sin job what would the world say today with our hedge open boy sure seems like brother so and so are that family struggling am I getting too close to home am I digging too deep and it won't do you any good remember brother juel that time was preaching on patience then he makes a statement no no no no no I don't pray for patience I told him after the service brother juel it don't matter whether you pray for patience or not God's going to give it to you sister Vanessa is like bu Paul don't say that too late too late because God's going to give us patience and do you realize well praise God not one of us said we wanted God to open the Hedge but do you realize it's open the Hedge is open Satan has full access to assault you you know why that you are who you are is because when God opened the Hedge he already knew what he put in you just like job he already poured his Spirit into you Satan's doing everything come on we know this don't we things that happen in life we know Satan's trying to destroy us trying to trip us trying to knock us down now the word of God I need to shorten this but the word of God has given us a promise my brother and sister why don't we forget about what Satan's trying to do out here and step out in the promise step out in what God promised to you and I he said I've sealed you with the holy spirit amen I I've made a way for you I believe that's like I don't know is it Ezekiel 6 talking about going into the City and destroying everything but yet he says stop until we seal every True Believer and then when they're sealed you can destroy you realize what God's done he sealed you against the Judgment does that make you perfect no nothing's perfect but Christ but you see when he poured the Holy Ghost into you he sealed you to the day of your Redemption Can someone say thank you Lord amen we're sealed to the day of our Redemption every destructive judgmental spirit and evil spirit out here can't touch you because you've been sealed amen hallelujah I'm going to cut my sermon a little short here I believe we've been long enough amen praise God so I just want to read a couple very quick they're just very very short amen now look at this so flashing red light of the sign of his coming now if this sounds old and fogy now we know that's the term most of you wouldn't be using today to somebody check back a few years and look what's going on now and then imagine a future there's no future but the coming of the Lord now when I was a boy my brother and sister we would ride bicycles from the farm all the way to town never fear our parents didn't chew their fingernails of somebody kidnapping our children but we live in a present world right now where destructive forces are everywhere we look at a time I'll put it out like this we look at a time that when brother brandom spoke about America being bankrupt nobody belied that but look at our nation right now look at it right now you know I I don't recommend you do this I almost broke in tears the other day I went on the computer and looked at the debt clock and more money than I'll make in my whole lifetime flashed across that screen just about that long everything I could possibly make in my life has become a debt in about 10 seconds trillions it's no longer what our children can repay they'll never pay the debt but look at this manifestation if I could spiritualize this we were in debt we could never pay but the coming of the Lord Jesus wiped our debt away he became sin so that we could become him in righteousness Hallelujah aren't you excited about that my debt wiped out even faster than Satan could wind my debt up God eliminated it I say thank you Lord praise the Lord today hallelujah thank you thank you Lord now look one more little short quote I know that's hard I'm not here to baby you or make you laugh or make you shout I'm here to tell you the truth in God and you'll see someday if you don't believe it now someday will come when you'll say that was right true you got to get back amen he's talking about how Revival they're trying to create Revival and he says they're trying to get back brother Brown's talking about in a different angle get back let's get back okay let's quit playing Church let's quit having a emotional this and conflict there and misunderstanding there and offense over here let's get back to the word let's get back to Christ let's get back to the point that it makes a difference in our lives my brother and sister not just sitting here this whole thing the whole thing is in this condition there's nothing left for it to come but the coming of the Lord Jesus and he won't come for Assembly of God he won't come for Baptist he'll come for each individualise Lord now the point that he named out different churches that's not really the point he's telling us it's not about because I belong here and it's not about because I belong there it's about who you are and where you belong aren't you glad we belong to Jesus Christ today I tell you church I want to encourage each one of us every one of us let's step out in faith and let's come to a little higher calling and to a little higher position in Jesus Christ let's tell ourselves and believe it I'm no longer going to live at the level I've been living I'm ready to move up I'm ready to move out amen I'm ready to move on Amen into the presence of almighty God cuz I'm telling you it's going to take more than just average Christian faith to make a Rapture it takes rapturing Faith yes rapturing Faith doesn't just come because you pick your Bible up every so often and read it it comes from when you immerse yourself in the word of God amen immerse our lives in Christ Hallelujah I think I'll just stop right there amen if our musicians would come is it good to be a Christian today amen amen you know I don't think that well I know for a fact nothing wrong with getting people to laugh amen nothing wrong with getting people to shout but we need the the truth amen we don't need to be humored we don't need to have a comedian for a pastor we need to have the word we need a life that's something solid we can hook onto I think I shared with you I I I kind of got caught up in looking to things about Everest and um you know quite quite interesting because there's this Zone in Everest that they call the I forget now The Killing Zone or death zone and and you know people can a lot L of people can make it to that point a lot of people make it that point but of the percentage that start those that actually make it to the summit it's quite small percentage and what struck me was like that's that's a Christian experience there comes a point in time that we have to die to ourself to get any further and very few Summit Lord help us in that article I was looking at you know climate change has come to Mount Everest also snow has melted different storms have blowed in different Fashions and literally not far from the summit on Mount Everest is this gradual slope that is deceiving because it goes off and keeps falling away at the point you can't climb back up and it's littered with dead [Music] bodies I know that's a little graphic you'll have forgotten about it by the time you eat lunch today the word of God shows us we can't enter into the presence of God unless we're prepared and almost every one of those individuals either had no oxygen or ran out of oxygen and they couldn't exist in that atmosphere I'm telling you Saints God is bringing us to a place as Sons and Daughters of God place of rapturing faith we can't do it on our own we need the Holy Ghost we need Christ every fiber of our being we need Christ or we will be like those people who tried to climb the mountain believe they were capable on their own I pray God would just deal with our hearts and let us just see who we really are and the fact that when we step out in faith it needs to be real faith not our idea of Faith or what someone said have faith but we need to know where our faith is anchored let it be anchored in Jesus Christ can we say amen amen hallelujah amen we'll sing a song or two I got a little itch in the back of my throat just probably ask brother Alex here to just come and help me amen let's just stand and sing a new creation Hallelujah are you a new creation today Hallelujah I know I am amen by God's grace Hallelujah that we're we're not the old man we're not going to try and do this on our own well let me just put it this way I I'll just a moment of transparency I fail so [Music] often sometimes I feel the revelation of my failure is more real to me than the revelation of the word do you follow me we come face to face with our failure over and over and over again but I tell you my brother and sister the failure of the flesh is the revelation of Christ that seems a little to struggle right the failure of our flesh is the revelation of Jesus Christ because you're not standing here this morning in your flesh you're standing here in the revelation of Jesus Christ otherwise we wouldn't be here otherwise we wouldn't be standing in this hour otherwise we couldn't make it to tomorrow but with Christ in US amen we're going to make it Hallelujah Hallelujah he redeemed me can you sing this as a [Music] testimony been born again to I thank God he just defi me of fullness have we all receiv received of H I'm a new creation I'm a brand
