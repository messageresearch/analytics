we ask for i believe that right now i have it that's his promise amen and we'll see the manifestation god bless you you can thank you for the songs it's a joy to be here tonight and to express the love of god amen express him that's what the bride is here to do her ministry is the son of man she has no other ministry her ministry is christ amen outside of that there's not not no church no this no group none that her all in all is christ everything is christ the all in all is christ that's what she lives for that's what she's we just say it simply is what she breathes for is to express christ in this hour and god has ordained her as individuals to do just that she's ordained to do it right it may not be in the way we think it may be unusual and out of the ordinary but if it goes with the word it's got to be christ it has to be with the word amen it's not a not here to agree with our theology or our thinking it's not uh our our understanding is not our absolute it's not the bride's absolute how we feel how we don't feel that's not the bride's absolute bride's absolute is christ in her god's god's uh great revelation amen and i'm so thankful for that tonight i don't know of anything else to be more thankful for but to know i'm ready to have a body change amen that's that's the great thing to know that you know you're in him and he's in you if you don't know that tonight i invite you to know it because if there's a desire in you for him there's him to get to to satisfy the desire amen if there's a deep calling to the deep there's got to be a deep to respond to that call and there is right here tonight he's in our midst amen amen and he's here to do the exceeding and abundantly above all that we could ask or think if we just realize that and realize he wants to do for you just simply take him at his word and don't accept no other opinion don't accept your reasoning about it take what he said amen and use the faith that god put in you his own faith amen amen what god reveals to you is yours what god makes known to you have a right to act on it amen because we just shall live by faith amen faith is a revelation amen if you'll stand with me and like to take the book of starting out with the revelations chapter 3 and we're going to speak on the genuine evidence of the holy ghost in you amen the genuine evidence there is a genuine evidence you hear people say oh there's no certain evidence i beg your pardon it's been laid out perfectly what the evidence of the holy ghost is amen so we we we have a genuine not just a make-believe not just a hope so not a theological understanding of what the holy ghost is there's a genuine evidence of the holy ghost amen and i trust that this will encourage you to press toward the mark for the prize for the high calling you know the bride has a high calling you know that she has a very high calling and we're pressing toward the mark for the reward of that high calling it's not that we want reward but he promised reward amen and as our brother paul would have said many times his ministry just to hear him say it was well done my good and faithful servant is all the reward i need amen just to know he's pleased just to know that and you know i can't please him without faith the bible said faith is the evidence of things hoped for i mean the evidence of things not seen faith is the evidence amen amen and the real believer has god's faith amen revelations 3 and 22 he that's an individual i want you to never forget that the bride is called as individuals it's not called as a group it's called as an individual brother branham may refer to a bride as a group but the group is made up of individuals and so it's it's individuals that god calls it's it's between you and god he doesn't he doesn't make it a group revelation it is a individual revelation and god identifies himself in that individual and that's what you must have to make a rapture amen you must have the identification of himself and you recognizing your faith has been received as his faith amen now that can only be to a certain group and we'll get into that in just a minute and that group is a very special group you say well who do you think we are i'm the wife of jesus christ that's exactly who i am that's a very special position that is a a sovereign position under headship did you hear what i said it's a sovereign position don't leave out this part under headship amen amen all right so so here again verse 22 he that hath not he that doesn't have he that hath an ear why brother david everybody has ears but that's not what he's talking about here our physical ear everybody can hear the word we can we can hear it preach we can hear it but what is it doing to you what effect does it have on you he that hath an ear to hear an ear let him he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches now in every church age that's repeated at the end he that hath an ear in that church age he the individuals that hath an ear to receive it he that hath an ear in the ear to hear i'm saying to hear as we'll find out means to receive it he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches amen you may be seated i'll just read that one scripture but i have several more here so turn with me to john 8 start out here saint john 8. it's been a good fight of faith today satan has done everything he could to stop this meeting to hinder me from getting here everything from a closed down printer to a whatever but accidents in the middle of the road blocked our way and all kinds of things but but god's right on time and i say it's a good fight of faith every day is a good fight of faith not a bad fight we are in a fight i guess you know we are in a fight we are not on a picnic we are not on a holiday we are pressing toward the mark for the prize of the high calling christ you're not going to just get it casually you're going to have to press into it and pressing means a daily dying out to yourself and taking up your cross and following the word amen it takes a daily feeding it takes daily prayer now just pray because you but a love affair between you and christ amen amen john 8 and the 43rd verse why do you not understand my speech here's here's jesus speaking to these sadducees pharisees ones that would call him the devil and he already told him you're you're the you're he said we're not born a fornication why would they think that right we're not the opposite we're not the other seed well jesus says right here he said he said why do you not understand my speech in other words my words what i'm speaking why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word well they all had ears so it's a different kind of hearing isn't it amen and so then we find out in the 47th verse he that is of god this is really potent but he that is of god heareth god's words you want to know what the evidence is amen see we could just say amen and go home because there's the evidence but we're going to bring out some more things in the evidence here he that is of god anybody of god here how do you know who told you how do you know you're of god brother branham asks a similar question if i could just interject this right in here don't know how god would take this he said well here brother branham if it he said you might read the bible and say well here brother brown the bible says this that's true that's exactly right that's where people say today well i believe jesus christ is the son of god and i'm saved how do you know he's the son of god the bible said so bill graham said see question mark and i say well how do you know he's the son of god mother said so preacher said so they just said the bible said so see it takes more than just an intellectual reading of the scriptures we've got to ask for revelation and if the spirit lives in you he's already promised that he would reveal his word to you and you can't receive revelation you can't see the things of god in the word until you receive the spirit of that word in you i'm going to make that very blunt that's as blunt as i can say it right you will never under you will never receive the message nor know what the message is saying without the spirit of this message dwelling in you and without jesus christ in you you'll never see your position or the revelation contained in those seals or the the message of the hour amen are you with me so see it's a must amen there's only one thing it's going to allow god's going to see today and only there's only there's only there's only one there's one thing he expects one thing he's looking at it's not your church affiliation it's not your group affiliation amen he requires the token he requires his own life to be seen in you and you can't do that in your own self you can't get enough religion to do that you can't get enough message religion to do that you can't belong to enough message churches to do that i don't care what affiliations and how many books and tapes you've got is it revealing itself in you is it coming off of the books and the tapes and is it becoming flesh in you that's the question how do you know he said mother said well they're right how do you know the bible said you cannot know until you have received the holy ghost you're only taking somebody else's word other words you have a second handed religion we don't want a second-handed religion can you turn this this this down just a little bit i feel like i'm blasting myself out maybe it'll help me i don't maybe let me speak a little softer i don't need to speak a little softer i want liberty to speak like i want to speak forgive me a little bit flesh there anyway all right but let's go back here what he's saying you're only taking somebody else's word but that's the truth quote it no man can say jesus is the christ he said what is that what's the truth he said quote it tell him quote it no man can say jesus is the christ only by the holy ghost think of that you say jesus is lord jesus is my lord how do you know these are tough questions but they're easy questions you know because god's revealed it to you if it's not revealed to you don't know and without the holy ghost you can't know it because he said what he would do when the holy spirit would come he would reveal his word to you i'm going to come to that now i'm not just pulling that out of the air out here all right all right so we're see you're only taking what the you're you're taking son of god or you're see the holy ghost has to bear record to the resurrection and jesus being the son of god or you're only taking somebody else's word for it you're only taking what the bible you're only taking what the bible said and he said the bible is right or only taking what the minister says the minister's right or some other good person said they're right but you as an individual doesn't know that jesus is the christ until the holy ghost has brought it to you amen amen that's right he must be in you living right now he must be abiding in you amen see see our brother paul pastor brought the word to us the other building up in your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost but without the holy ghost how are you going to pray in the holy spirit how are you going to pray in the holy ghost if you don't have the holy ghost that's right because it said praying in in underline inn amen if we walk in the light as he is in the light god is light and in him and in him is no darkness so if you're in him you're not walking in darkness you're walking in light amen if you're walking with god you're walking in light amen you're walking in the light to walk with god is to walk in the light and the light is the promised word for the day revealed amen the life of god manifested in you the word of god opened in you is the light that makes you the light of the hour amen amen all right now because light is life and the life manifested is the light light brings life and the life manifested is what light all right i'm not talking about human life i'm talking about christ's own life so it's not just a criteria we come to it's not an imagination it's not some feeling amen the new birth is not that is a absolute direct revelation of jesus christ in you amen that's what he said he would build his church on and there you grow up you're built on that foundation of the revelation you wonder why i say you must be born again there is no other criteria to this what if what if we what what if we knew that there was no one else coming in what would you think about that and the prophet said it very well could be that we don't know but i say if there's even a little pull of christ pulled for christ in you and you don't know you don't know you do not know that revelation the new birth is jesus christ opened revealed unveiled in you the secret is known it's manifested it's a revelation christ in you it's not a hope it's not a it's a revelation you know he's in you i'm selling about something you know not something you hope you have it's something you know you say brother david what do you mean it ought to bring you to desperation every young person in here every person if you don't know that it's time you got very desperate if you've got even a smidgen of desire for god in you hallelujah yes i i'm not afraid to talk direct amen i'm not afraid to tell you what the truth is i'm not doing that to be arrogant i'm doing that because i love you and i love this word amen and i am like you i need him every moment of every day i've got to die to myself take up my cross jesus said deny yourself that means death to self deny or die to yourself and take up that death of your own self and and get rid of it and take the word and take it as your absolute and walk forward with that word revealed in you that faith in you cannot and will not disbelieve the word and god has got god is calling for weaklings today strong in faith god is calling for weaklings in yourself know at nothing's so he can work through you that you come to a complete total dependency on him you become a weakling that's the only way god can work he was crucified in weakness so his resurrection would prove his power it was without he had to go forth he had to die as a man he had to be a man he had to be weak hallelujah god requires weaklings perfect strength by perfect weakness okay i don't want to get sidetracked here but that's a very good track to follow because until you come to that place you've still got something of yourself in the way and as long as you're in the way god's out of the way amen and every one of these challenges every one of these every one of these trials every one of these things we go through is to pull out what he put in you have himself to pull out that character don't you despise don't you try to subjugate the the the testings and the trials and say oh i don't have i don't have to suffer oh yes you do to say you don't is contrary to the word it's contrary to what the prophet even said he said a church that's not suffering doesn't have it you see do you want suffering no i don't want suffering but i say god give me grace to go through it and take a hold of your word in those circumstances and glorify you by taking the word and believing the word hallelujah hallelujah god loves to test his people he loves to bring out he's doing it for a purpose he does nothing as a frustration he does it with purpose life is meant the prophet said to be a struggle and quit your put your face in these psychological books that tell you don't have to you're working contrary to the word you see i got the holy ghost and work contrary to his word it can't be the holy ghost working in you because he isn't going to work and he's not going to lead you away from his word and you can have all kinds of sensations you can have you can shout and do all you want to do and that spirit realm of that second realm that second realm could be anointed and still not have the word in the third realm of the soul that's where you've got to meet him as on the inside the inside you must break through that veil into the word itself into the shekinah brother braham said break into the spirit and see where you are at unveiling of god he said break into the spirit and see where you're at break into the shekinah glory and come face to face with who you are break into the shekinah glory and see where you're standing then you'll realize the real you is on the inside the real you is the holy ghost when you're praying and you speak you're praying in the spirit you're singing in the spirit you're praying in the spirit and speaking his name it is the holy ghost in you praying that's the real you that unveiled work that revelation of the word in you is the true believer that is exactly what he said in perfect faith he said that real faith that faith that faith inside of you he said that faith in you is the believer he said that's god's faith that's god's own faith hallelujah what is it the revelation of the word of promise for the season who's going to see these things who's going to be the ones to receive it those that have an ear to hear what the spirit says hallelujah all right so you don't get it by just reading i know i'm i'm not discouraging from reading but you ought to be laying in the messages too along with reading your bible because god sent a prophet to bring out what the bible said and without a prophet you're not going to get what he said there's promises laying hid in that word that had to be unveiled in this hour and without god sending a prophet and separating himself to a prophet and bringing the word of life through that prophet you will never see what's in the word you cannot make it by reading the bible alone you see that's a tough quote but that's why god sent a prophet to tell you what's in that bible that's why he sent it to you and without that you'll never get a true divine revelation don't you try to put your own opinion to what that prophet said leave it alone if you don't understand it leave it alone don't go off and put your opinion to it god don't mean mine you don't need your opinion let god reveal his word amen amen he already promised you do it be careful who you're influenced by devils and wolves stand around the outskirts of where the eagles are fed where the carcass is they can't get to it but they'll try to bring somebody else under their wing and influence you away from the word be careful the holy ghost will deserve those things and if you can't desert it there's something missing amen you'll see all we ought to just be fellowshipping with everybody that's not according to the word amen we just don't we just don't we just don't join up with everybody that comes along they don't live the life of christ and i can you can see they're not living life of christ they're living they're dressing they're walking they're talking what they're eating on what they view what they see and what they're giving you is not the word of god and you say well i just don't see that i don't see that then you need to be awakened it's the awakening time it's the awakening of the bride it's a union taking place i know there's only a certain number going to enter in but you what's what is it stops you to know you're that number i said god open the warp to us amen a real genuine christian will cope with the inside man you're gonna bring out i don't care what it is what's ever laying in that soul is the light is so great today it's going to make manifest what you are on the inside of that soul it's got to the message of the hour that's why people don't want to get into it they want to hear some reasoning they want to have a church affiliation they want to have a group affair they want to have some little organized dominating female spirit dominating them i'm not talking about just females i'm talking about the carnal church man or woman it's a dominating denominating female spirit it's not god's word and you say well well we shouldn't have listen god is a segregationist i just read it on the message we've been fellowshipping in the morning on a family altar i trust you have a family altar i don't talk to that because i have it you need it every day you have a time where you can get alone and pray together as a family pray together with your children pray together with your husband and wife sincerely you know what the problem is we're in this message we need more sincerity that's for sure we need more sincerity we need to get down to business with god we just don't realize many many many many don't realize how close we are to a body change and i don't think i realize it because it is close you realize any day this bride can come up missing and you're left behind we better make our calling in election sure it doesn't matter where husband does what about you sis doesn't matter what you your wife does brother what about you brother what about you young man well i've been raised the message i'm okay that's denominational hogwash you aren't because you're raised your parents are believers you need an absolute personal contact a face-to-face contact with jesus christ and you're not too young if you have the conviction in your heart and you know that that's in you pulling then you need to let go of it i don't care if you have to get out there somewhere and just get on your face and say god you're going to file a pile of bones here get desperate about it say i need to make contact with you you gave this word to me and i want that feeling of the holy ghost i want a new birth that is a revealing of the word in me i need to be born again and the new birth is jesus christ then who are you that's born again that's what you have to meet i hope you got that amen it's not it's just not something we we just well it's okay i believe the message i'm born again no no no no no no no god revealing himself in you is the birth god undead unveils himself in you i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not be able never will be able are impossible to defeat it they cannot defeat it amen you must meet the light you've got to meet the light you've got to go in beyond that second realm and the only way you can go beyond that second realm is because there's a seed of god planted in your soul that's pulling you in amen you've got to go beyond that second veil you've got to go into the holiest of holies you've got to come out of your own skin you've got to get meat face to face with him and know where you're standing and know who you are amen and then you can't explain revelation you can't give it to somebody else they've got to have their own experience so how do you know that jesus christ is right now is the son of god he that believeth jesus christ is present tense the son of god takes the holy ghost in you to unveil that because now you know praise the lord and if you grow up you can only grow up into one person i'm talking about spiritual growth as you feed on the word from revelation to revelation from light to light the path of the justice as a shining light that grows greater and greater and greater to a body change to a perfect day amen hallelujah all right so so there's something that's inside of all reasoning something inside of all emotions that's what i'm talking about this morning this evening there's something beyond emotion the second realm is a realm of reasoning and it's emotion and it has feelings and has sensation but you've got to go into faith that has no reasoning faith doesn't reason faith believes the word faith accepts the word they don't care who the person is or what it is you will not relieve anything or have anything to do with anything else but christ christ jesus is your all in all he's everything he's the fullness hallelujah when you're in him you've already been accepted you've already been received that has to be a revelation to you in order for it to be expressed in flesh in order for you the word to become flesh you has to be that has to be open up in you christ is the anointed word revealed christ is the mystery of god revealed christ in you makes you the complete revelation of jesus christ go back to the beginning tell me who was the complete revelation of adam and tell you who the complete revelation of jesus christ is it's the bride what do you think the message was about yeah right it's to take us home this message was set to take us home it's rapture days we are in the raptured age you want to say it like this we're in the days of elisha a fulfilling of the prophet's prophecy it turned from the prophet to his prophecy we are the prophecy manifested we are the message of the hour manifested we're fulfilling the scripture this day the scripture is fulfilled there's got to come a royal seed it's got to be a royal bride the prophet said and she must come on the scene in this last days it's got to be a bride coming of myself i've got to have the bride to complete the hidden mystery of who i am the complete revelation that's what the seventh seal opened i don't care who hears this i'm not ashamed to say that that's exactly what the seventh seal opened amen amen i don't know if i'm going to get to my message tonight or not but i'll just follow the lord the paul's i i just follow i just what i want brother paul to do that's what i want brother chris to do i want to follow the lord i'm not interested in finding out what he intellectually thinks and what he intellectually thinks or any other person intellectually thinks i want to know what god thinks i want to hear god speak out of them i want to hear and receive the word for the hour not another day not another age the bride age the day that the prophecy is being fulfilled the message of the hours being manifested that's the bride's position hallelujah amen hallelujah there you are that's that inside man that inside man will punctuate the word regardless you can't move that inside man that inside man is the word you can't move that inside man that inside man that faith that's in you that revelation of christ in you you come face to face with who you are this isn't who you are i have no confidence in this man doesn't matter how many mistakes or how many faults and failures i do i don't get shook up with that i've already been sealed i've been accepted i've been received in christ already and it's a revelation to be a happy evidence amen glory to god hallelujah i'll say brother david this is too deep no it isn't it's too simple we speak revelation because it is simple and you can't know right simple things unless it's revealed to you how are you going to be able to how are you going to be able in your own intellectual thinking be able to come down so low to a god that's so simple and beyond your intellect it takes revelation it takes the working of the holy spirit in you to do that you let a man see that and see what's really the hour and for the time and see his portion in it it's so simple that you can't give it to somebody else i'll chew on that a while and you know what god's come right down and become a part of a weakling come right down in your failures man's failures and faults and said that's all right that's what i want him to get to so i get most like i did moses and realize he's defeated realize he's cured realized and and moses just sort of said well god i'm so well cured and so such a weakling i'm making excuses of why i can't do what you want and god got angry with him and he said i'm not asking you to do anything i'm taking what i put inside of you moses i'm anointing it and i'm going down to egypt and i will deliver the people and i'm sending you and just simply tell them i am sent me yeah and i'll back it up where's the voice today where's the voice and if they speak them that heareth let him that heareth let him that heareth the spirit speaking through the prophet that spoke through the bride let him hear that voice let him hear it let him hear the voice and him that heareth let him say come hallelujah amen there you are the word will always trumpet ill triumph i mean it will never fail no matter what it what no matter what that outside an obstacle may be amen don't let the devil influence you i don't care how nice a person is i don't care how beautifully they can place their words what are they bringing you to what are they pulling you into what's the outcome of the fruit what is it it a furthering in the revelation for the hour or is it just some kind of friendship affair you know you'll fulfill your love which i'm not against philly love i have it for my wife but you know the filial love and divine love are so close together it's deceiving amen people have to feel you love when they think god a divine love divine love will recognize the word and live it for the season because it is the holy spirit himself the person of christ in you amen i better get going or i'm not going to get done here all right now let me read here something like i didn't even get past hardly passed it scripture verse 47 did i but he that is of god heareth god's word so therefore ye therefore hear them not because you are not of god oh oh you therefore hear them not because you're not of god so they that are of god heareth god's words looks like a pretty good evidence brother paul how do you know because it's revealed to you and it's identified every true revelation will be vindicated in scripture how many believe a message that has a real true revelation then you feed on that revelation to say what he says got to be a revelation to you he pointed us to this word the message unveiled this to you and you found yourself hid in it always in it always were in it amen amen amen amen hallelujah all right i get pretty excited you can anyway well let me read the rest these scriptures i got so much i'd like to say here all right let's go to matthew 13. matthew the 13th chapter i'll try to go through this a little quicker what time is it okay i've still got a little bit of time matthew 13 verse 9 jesus speaking who hath ears to hear let him hear and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou to them in parables he answered and said them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given he was hiding it it was hid what was he wanting his disciples to do doing what they were just there doing ask me to reveal my word praise the lord yes he wanted them to ask you receive not because you asked not and it was brought up here a couple of servants go you don't get what you asked for because you ask a miss to consume it upon your own lust god's not an errand boy god's not a messenger boy when you ask according to his will you have confidence that he hears you and if he know you here he know you know he hears you then you have your request you've got to ask according to his will outside of that you have no authority hallelujah but if you ask according to his will and his will is his word don't you ever forget that he said i want to do the will of god then it's in the word and the prophet's message brought us into this word and showed us what was hidden there as i said without that message you never know what's it in there you can read it intellectually all you want to read it right i encourage you young people to get in this message and take your bible and read it along with that prophet and go search the scriptures out them jesus said search the scriptures the prophet of the age says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me hey amen you like singing a song amen amen all right now watch he said because it is given to you no okay for whosoever hath has hath what an ear for whoso and what is that ear the seed because it is given unto you know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven excuse me for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he that hath and that he and he shall have more abundantly i've come to bring life and that more abundantly the thief cometh not but to steal and destroy what you do have amen but i have come that you might have life and have it more abundantly all right then he said and him and and he that hath be given more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath amen verse 16 but blessed are your eyes for you see they see and your ears for they hear amen all right then he comes over here in the next scripture here uh saint john 16. now get into a few things here i can't begin to cover it all so you get the picture just says the lord leads amen that's that's his business saint john 16 13. you see i brother sister you say why did you say you're not afraid to be direct if god wants to be direct i'll speak direct this is not the time to speak in parables now's the time to speak direct we're speaking revelation faith cometh by hearing hearing what not an intellectual speech hearing the word hearing the word of faith hearing faith preached yes amen and faith is in the word that's why faith comes by hearing hearing the word remember that faith is in the word that's why your faith anchors in the unmovable word of god that's why it anchors there that's it it doesn't move from that because it's in the word it's a part of the word and so are you you are that faith you are that unveiled christ i'll just point blank tell you you are eternal life i'm not talking about david i'm talking about that being manifest through david say oh well bless god you ought to be out there raising the graveyards and all this that you may not even see it done but i do and it's for you but it's not a show but it's being preached amen all right and the words are mine and the words i'm not talking about just me i'm talking about the five full ministry if we're true ministry we can't say opposite of what the prophet said we've got to speak it by revelation and if it's not a revelation leave it alone amen i'm talking about the ministry leave it alone until you know where you're standing amen amen we don't have a right to put what we think out there it's too important not to put what we think we're we're representatives and here to encourage we're here to edify building up the body for the work of the ministry what ministry his ministry right here revealing a kingdom we're here opening we're here to reveal christ bring christ i should say bring christ to you that's why when the light comes on the scene there's two things happen what's ever in that soul and that light determines and shows what's in the soul you're going to come against it or you're going to be for it one or the other and i am not responsible for how you react hey amen i'm not irresponsible for you getting it hallelujah so we need to take our eyes off off the outward and go on to the inward because the devil's always pointing you to some outward thing amen i i believe in amending the word i believe it absolutely believe it but whether you do or don't i'm not responsible for how you react to it god knows your heart i want you to know sitting here tonight god knows your heart and knew what you would think before you even came in here right he knew what you would do he knew what i would say amen i just can't well that's all right lord you just direct it no i don't have to look up i just look here it's all right lord i looked let me never lose consciousness of how little i am up here in this is man what the prophet said didn't he see the first step to doing anything for god is two wings over the feet two wings over the face now you can be put in action all right all right now let's get see if i can i can only get to a certain portion of this i'll close it off all right now i know there's a lot been said already saint john 16 13 how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into i just read about it so bad brother david i just read about i'm going to miss something oh really how are you going to miss it if christ is in you [Applause] he's already identified you in him how are you going to miss it cast down the spirit of fear when we begin to look at ourself and project if i project myself up here it's because i'm fearing your reactions right amen i'm afraid of how you're reacting i gotta keep you and i gotta keep you here i don't have to fear any of that just let me preach the truth and let the truth separate that's exactly right let the truth do the separating as long as i got my man part in it won't do you any good but if i bring this revealed word of this hour it's gonna it's gonna speak to that predestinated seat they'll never get out of it because it's not my voice it's not paul's voice it's not chris's voice it's his voice it's not the bride's voice it's not your voice bride has a voice it's not the ministry amen we have a position ours is a position ours is a calling ours is a love you know what we're to do dress the bride that's what the prophet called the fivefold ministry the bride's dress swear amen all right now my okay saint john 14 oh i got to finish 13. how be it when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear he shall hear sounds like he has an ear to hear you have an ear to hear because he shall hear what is that predestinated seed whatever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you amen and i'll show you where brother braham said that's revealed to you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive receive key word here he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you hallelujah pretty confident isn't it where's the fear then it's the love of god that leads you into these scriptures and opens the word to you and it's the love that's in your heart that receives that word is projected back to him it's the love that brought you in it's the love that takes you on and it's a love that comes to you that can't fail and projected through you our love for him by doing what believing what he said and conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom has allowed to come to pass amen don't despise where god god's leadership just become a weakling i know it nothing god picks up knowing nothings you don't have to be a big speaker you don't even have to speak your words right brother brown said you don't even have to do that just get a love affair with him amen oh i love that scripture rise my love who who are you god said you're my love arise my love amen it's his own love amen come away amen that's what's happening i'll just tell you right now that's what's happening we're coming away let me get down here i want to close maybe i can only close with these couple things let's go real quickly now real fast real fast no 14th he shall glorify me for he shall receive a mind and shall show it unto you brother branham and broken cisterns oh 14 chain john 14 26 let me read this one thing the comforter which jesus speaks of there but the comforter which is the holy ghost when he the father whom the father will send in my name hallelujah in my name who's the real you the holy spirit that's in you whom the comforter will send in my name he shall teach you brother braham said teach you there means revealed to you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you that's thus saith the scriptures right why can't we rely upon that and rely upon and have faith in who we are you know why the devils couldn't stand against jesus christ because he knew who he was and he had no beauty outward beauty we would desire it he's not manifested that way he was manifested as nobody we would desire no beauty we would desire rejected and despise the men amen is that right come up as a dry root out of ground kind of homely looking stoop shouldered thin little guy nobody wanted him yet he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he was all of god and he's all of us and we're all of him amen he's everything we are what we are he is and what he is we are amen and if he was despised and rejected nobody would desire him what do you think of the bride so cheer up everything's going exactly according to order it's just that our own senses get in the way but we can take authority over that can't we by bringing under obedience those thoughts all you got to do is change your thought yes amen amen that's too simple brother david is change your thought if the devil presents one thought go back to the word that's right that's just too simple yeah i know it but it's powerful all right you have to go stomping around just take the word just rely on the word amen rely on what god's revealed to you when he reveals it to you then move paul was such a prisoner that that little that little witch or that divination that girl came behind them declaring something she had no right to declare trying to proclaim something she didn't know anything about amen trying to amen are you with me and it wasn't god's way and yet for several days they followed and paul couldn't do one thing about it wait paul had authority but god paul was a prisoner and he couldn't move until god said move and that's the walk we have we have a walk of faith we can't move until god inspires you to do it and what you confess you confess what you believe you don't confess it out of hope you don't confess it out of nothing you confess what you believe and it must work when you speak in his name it's the revealed word inside of you it's the reality of who you are because you and him are one when you speak in his name it is the holy ghost speaking through you hallelujah he said if you ask anything in my name i will do it that's right hallelujah all right all right all right now broken cisterns paragraph 65 you cannot make a man see the word of god till his nature has been changed and when his nature is changed from what it is to a son of god and the holy spirit comes into him the holy spirit wrote the word of god today i was talking with a good friend of mine dr lee vale present now he's quite a theologian we usually have some very pretty good discussions on the scripture very smart and he asked me one time he said what i thought about the initial evidence of the holy ghost was and it is it speaking in tongues it's been wasn't speaking in tongues it meant many years ago and i said no can't see that he said neither do i said though i've been taught that he said what would you think would be an evidence i said well the most perfect evidence i can think of is love so we got to talking on that and then i thought that sounded pretty good so i just held that if a man has got love i just let it soak in a minute love satan can impersonate love it's not true love but he can impersonate it [Laughter] all right are you with me he can't come into divine love because he's not of god i hope you got that right all right amen so now but watch what he says and i held to that if a man's got love but one day the lord in a vision straighten me out he said that the evidence of the spirit was those who could receive the word neither love nor speaking in tongues it's receiving the word that's scriptural because in john 14 jesus said when the holy ghost has come upon you he will reveal these things to you that i've taught you and will show you things to come so there is the genuine evidence of the holy ghost he's never told me anything wrong yet that is that is the evidence of the holy ghost he is he who can believe the word he you he said believe it means to you can receive it now there you could stop right there you still wouldn't have a full picture we got to go on some more things so bear with me a minute all right jesus never said when the holy ghost has come you'll speak with tongues he never said the holy ghost come you do any of those things too bad but you can dance and shout all you want and i believe in dancing and shouting i believe in getting happy over revelation this stimulation it's wine this new wine you're so happy you can have a fit you ought to see me sometime out there walking you ought to see me in my room no you shouldn't see me they don't have to see me if i live this life i don't care what you see amen that's right because that holy ghost in me is not going to accept anything contrary to that word i don't care who it is or what it is or where it comes from amen and god will have nothing to do with the denominational spirit i don't care if it does claim to believe the message he will he will get you away from that he'll separate you from that thing when the bride begins to say i am the father and one that dominating denominational church female spirit will get away but it'll still want to stay on the fringes out here because what satan is afraid of is revelation and he hates it but we love it and with true revelation with revelation being brought with revelation being preached he'll do everything he can to keep you out of it and we expect that we expect that battle but what's the when the enemy will come in like a flood this the what will happen the spirit of the lord will raise a standard against him and you know what else the prophet said he said are you one of them where is that standard where does it live where is it where is it failed it's behind the skin of the bride that's where it is amen all right there's the genuine evidence he said but he will take these things of mine and show them to you you won't do any of those things or evidence but he will take these things of mine and show them to you reveal them to you and will show you things to come so there is the genuine evidence of the holy ghost according to jesus himself what will he do he will reveal these things to you that i've taught you all right and when i s when you see that oh what a rest you've entered into what satisfaction because god himself has identified yourself in him and you and him are one when the bride begins to say i and my father are one. oh that devil don't like that it's one thing to say it it's the next thing to say it and live it and that's what it'll be done it's a token on display in your everyday life they watch because they'll see you won't take anything off the word the holy ghost can't do that well i may make a mistake i do that but you know what i'll do i'm quick to say forgive me and i'll make it right i'll go to be quick to the lord and say it listen that doesn't move him and it doesn't move who you are that doesn't change the scene at all because you know this is not who you are and god will allow you to be challenged by that he'll allow you to be tested by mistakes he'll allow you to be tried by mistakes and all of it's for the purpose of developing his own character he wants to see your reaction he wants to see what you're going to do about it he wants to see your decision and he said that's what glorifies me in the midst of weakness in the midst of everything their strength is myself amen lord help me to become a total absolute dependence weakling upon christ who by the way is present who do you say this is who do you say the bride is who do you say jesus christ is today he's the bride [Laughter] i don't want to choke you now but the son of man is being revealed in bright form amen amen that's what is that's what he meant to do it's the bride coming of christ amen what a position all right now let's continue amen the members of his bride will love him they will have his potentials brother paul there it is they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him he has not come to bring fear is that right they come to bring power and all my power he said is yours to use amen i forget that quote page paragraph six or page six page 64 of church age book i've not come to bring fear but power how many knows that quote i i could quote it to you but i can't quote it to you i can almost quote it i just think about it a little bit all right now i go ahead and think about it here let's move on they will have his potentials for thee as their head all power belongs to him they are subject to him oh that's what he said at the end of that quote he said you speak the word and i will perform it there you are they are subject to him as the members of our the bride is subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads the harmony of the father and the son notice this harmony now i'm i'm right at the point where i have to close off if i'm going to close on time but what is time trick question what is time a space of eternity brother brown said time is eternity space all right and eternity and time are blending together so now what about it i'm not saying that to be funny that's the truth we're moving more and more to the eternal than time it's being swallowed up what's swallowing time up brother david christ revelation amen being here as he promised now for his bride i got to get to this point if i don't get any further just a couple things will you bear with me about five minutes 10 minutes maybe 15. it's up here but it's got to come down here okay all right now jesus never did anything until it first showed him by the father hello hello are we prisoners or aren't we where's your confidence i've got to reason this out i got to get down i got to do something i got gotta do something that's denominational you don't do anything just believe what he said and walk with him and let him take care of it let god be god let god be god in your life quit trying to inject yourself into it i'm talking to me one two three four back at me but that's the truth all right jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father you say brother david he saw vision it's still a revelation all right saint john 5 19 that's saint john 5 19 you just quoted he said this harmony is now now not later now not will be now this harmony is now to exist between the groom groom sounds like a marriage between the groom and the bride isn't it interesting you performed a wedding at the opening of those seals isn't that interesting that's exactly what christ was performing he's come for his bride he had to unveil himself in order to have union with her boy that was good amen all right the harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can har she let me say it again i didn't it didn't go over right she never doubts it right who's the she yes that's right but who's the she who is this that raised his hands the bride yes the seed himself all right for watch what he says therefore nothing can harm her praise the lord not even death for if the seed be planted predestinated anybody in here predestinated it's been planted before the foundation of the world down in a third realm called your soul amen for if the seed be planted the water water the washing of the word wait what word the word for the season bride age bride time rapture time seed time elisha time bride time said see be planted the water holy spirit the word in the form of spirit same person not another person the threefold is that god that poured himself into christ christ pours himself into you and now what are we ready for the kingdom be restored on earth again amen going right back home what's the fold of it it's not another god it's god above us god with us god in you the same one you're a son because god poured himself into that veil behind that skin of your skin and that's what makes you a son [Laughter] hallelujah god the son god the holy ghost these three are one you can't be somebody else and be his wife because you're the mystery of himself revealed amen you were the hidden mystery of revelations 10. you are the hidden mystery of the book of revelations which is a complete revelation of jesus christ and he had a hidden mystery and that hidden mystery was you amen you had to come forth to finish the mystery he said you are the complete revelation of the whole thing christ in you identifies you the complete revelation of the whole thing and while we see the promise being fulfilled christ the true headship then coming in going in or no he said going in he said now we see the promise being fulfilled promise now we see it being fulfilled now brother sister now we see the promise being fulfilled christ the true headship going in where are we going brother david where are we going going in he's going david who said don't you even move out of these mulberry breeze you stand right here you just turn the clockwise around that enemy and you wait here until you see the sound of the going going in how many's heard the sound of the going how many scenes going how many seeing it going marching she went right up yes preview marching going going in who's going in he's going in right time going in amen coming in and well i don't nobody's coming you're we're beholding it coming in it's too simple denominations hate it right they can't get it i'm not talking about the people there i'm talking about that denominational spirit that's idolatry that spirit that dominating female that i don't trust spirit i pull no punches with that we could take that i've got a message i'd like to preach on that someday called dominating female 1 i do i've got it written out lord willing if god maybe not here maybe somewhere else i don't know but god willing i'd like to preach that and let us see where you're where we're standing and how subtle these two spirits are so deceptive sin is such a shrewd bird it looks so beautiful it looks so overwhelmingly reasonable you'll fall to it if you don't know him on the inside of the inside if you're not settled if you haven't entered into his wrath you're going to miss it you say you say that pretty desperate i'm saying that out of desperation you better wake up quickly we've already seen the coming storm i preached the messi no longer coming storm and right behind it they'll covet come in don't you see don't you realize this thing of these churches there's going to be that dominating spirit right here amongst the message believers claiming to believe the message are going to fall right line the confederation of churches and it's going to look so reasonable and so right and so beautiful that we can operate under that you air doing that and it's going to be such a simple thing and look so reasonable you better know him because the only way you're going to discern that thing is to know him you say you don't have to tell us we'd better we better yeah maybe i do maybe it'll shake somebody to desperation here right here in this assembly because we're not playing church we didn't come here to play church we come here jesus christ that should be the very absolute absolute of our coming here is to meet him that's right i gotta close let me just close i could go on and tell you more evidences of super sense revelation of who you are he's headed to all but the seed of god he said i've hid these things the wise and prudent amen no man in himself can hear god the ability has to be given from god it's only revealed to a special group nobody can get it but the elect because the elect can only be reborn on and on we go you see on and on we receive it i'll let you look all those things up it has to be given the bride speaks the same thing the evidence is hearing what the spirit says the spirit is talking the evidence is hearing he told the evidence of what happened being baptized with the holy ghost the teacher would come in and teach all truth the teacher is an inside teacher not an outside teacher if the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by revelation if you heard it every moment of the day that was the sign of the indwelling spirit in the days of paul those who were filled with the holy ghost heard the word received it and lived it those who did not have the spirit heard it only as carnal men those that did not have the spirit heard it only as carnal man put a wrong interpretation on it and went into sin and if we don't see that happening amen he said sad but got to see it happening we've got to have the we've got to have the the carnal against the spiritual that's dominating females a carnal spirit it's a carnal church and all it can walk in is carnal claiming to believe a message carnally amen under false teachers that build a kingdom around them instead of pointing it to the word who are we preaching brother brown said ourselves or christ all right the evidence is the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and the and the spirit took it and lived the word and taught it other words taught it i told you here's what he said and taught it brother brown said revealed it the spirit taught it revealed it to them they were of the group that heard the messenger and his message and took that message and lived it in other words that message became flesh in them just exactly what god wanted you have to grow into this if he gives you an acorn potentially you have an oak tree is that right but you have to grow into it but everything that oak tree would ever be the number of leaves the number of acorns that would ever bear and everything is in that seat right then and brother sister everything we have need of for this journey is in us right now when the holy ghost is in us and it's going to be brought to us as we have need of it amen god wants you to let go of yourself and have confidence in him and let him lead you every day out of your senses out of the camp of man you've got to go out of the camp of man you've got to come out of that thing you've got to come out of laodicea and eat him outside the camp god expects you amen to to follow by obedience follow just submission and let lead you contrary to your own better judgment because you've got to let your own better man's judgment become nothing completely weak you can't rely upon it i'm so thankful god is bringing a people to that total dependency she doesn't have independence she is dependent that's what god wanted us that wherefore we know when we're coming more and more dependent god cutting away cutting away this cutting away that showing us we gotta die here and die there and die here and die there what's all these trials and what's these what's these tests doing showing us persecutions everything's showing us he's got it all under control all right i'm closing yeah almost 15 minutes later all right one more thing here if the seed be planted the water will raise it up here again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in mary what does that mean we go to matthew 1 18 to find out matthew 1 18 and be matthew 1 18 let me let us turn over there real quickly matthew 1 18. i know you've read this paul's read it i've read it we'll just read it again we can't read enough here because every day it comes brand new see the spirit has to be on the word but remember brother brown said christ lives the word christ living through his own word you are that word christ revealing himself living through this word you are the word all right 18 matthew excuse me i'm sorry 1 matthew 1 i'm sorry matthew 1 18. i said 18 1 didn't i oh okay 118 now the birth of jesus christ hello not natural this is beyond the natural right right supernatural spiritual yeah in fact because when you have that birth in you you become you are spiritual yeah oh he's just too spiritual i've heard that all my life he's just too spiritual i'm glad i am because he that is spiritual judgeth all things yes are you with me he that is spiritual either the spiritual has the spirit oh how we go back to first corinthians you read it you've read it we've read it many times without the spirit of god you can't receive the things of god without the spirit of god you can't speak the things of god all right now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise on this wise here it is when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together physically before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost so if we're going to have the word as it was in mary we're pregnanted yeah yes right right caught you let us be glad to rejoice for the marriage has come what are we going to wedding supper there's a union taking place we have the sign of the union the sign has been shown the headstone has been shown the head has come what for the union the bridegrooms come for the union and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut are you with me it's a secret thing brother brandon called it a secret coming a secret catching away he didn't come to everyone it wasn't a public show he came to the one he was espoused to he come to the one that he already made promise to and he come for a union and we must have the union or we can't meet the son are you with me just go back to abraham and sarah they had to have a union all right spiritually i'm speaking now not natural that was natural spiritually it's an invisible union now watch i'm just going to drop this in he said matthew what before they be before and before we meet jesus christ in the air physically i'm not talking about union physics i'm talking about physically how many know you're going to meet him going to see him going to meet him hug his neck all at his feet he's the king of kings lord of lords we the bride are going to be caught up together going to meet and unite with those that gone on first and we're going to meet with them and be together caught up is that right before that happens before they come together before mary and joseph came together she was found with child amen and you go back to christ the mystery of god revealed it's the same thing with the bride's spirit so before we come together we are found with child of the holy ghost praise the lord what brought that revealed to the bride amen there's your time there's your season here we're fulfilling the scriptures amen amen all right before we meet him physically in the air we are found with child of the holy ghost spiritually by invisible union with our bridegroom bearing word children eternal children the only thing a bride can bear is that christ amen what is he the body what is he wanting to bear himself bringing forth what bringing forth the evidences bringing forth the life bearing the life we're just getting fatter and fatter all the time what did she feed on she had to feed that child you can't feed it on education you can't feed it on psychology you better let go of psychology i don't care if anybody in this church wants to bring something psychologically to you reject that thing you have everything you need right here in this message why are you looking around for something else amen you've got everything you need right here and everything you read you better let it be filtered through the word but without the holy ghost how are you going to filter it right because the holy ghost will draw through the word for the hour i don't need i got i got these i'll leave that alone just go with it but be careful you better be aware of it you're being warned of it i don't care how close a person is to you we're not accepting anything contrary to this word that psychological gobbledy goulash is in the spirit realm not the soul realm the soul realm is where your deliverance lays not in your reasoning realm all you can reason is so pretty and the things happen under that realm but it doesn't give eternal life amen and when that thing comes up there to work contrary to the word watch out anything contrary the word is your enemy anything contrary to what this message spoke i'm talking about the message i'm not talking about william branham's mistakes and failures i'm talking about the message anything the message spoke which is jesus christ you better if contrary to that leave it alone because this message and this bible are won amen amen i don't care don't you try to say well brother brown said this then put a wrong slant on what he said if you can't say what he said and find it in this word you leave it alone what he said because what he said brought light on this it was sent for that purpose all right before we meet him physically there we're found the child of the holy ghost spiritually by an invisible union with our bridegroom the bride has the mind of christ for she knows she knows shows her she knows revealed led by the holy spirit what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord she can't have the mind of god and not have thus saith the lord then the word is quickened by the spirit then the word is quickened by the spirit if it's thus saith the lord the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that's planted and watered it comes to full harvest serving its purpose praise the lord do you love him i'll have to click quit quit quit stop stand with me amen you want to become a prisoner if revelations beyond you look up and seek god for it that's that is the only way you are ever going to get it amen that's the only way you're ever going to get it the elect group the elect always heard the word and received it the elect always heard the word

baptism of the holy ghost for a genuine baptism of the holy ghost is being born again it was sent because the real the real seed the real the real lord you said the the real thing is inside of that soul that real [Music] gift is in that soul that will believe the word receive it that comes alive by the baptism of the holy ghost without that being their lord that's why only the elect can be
