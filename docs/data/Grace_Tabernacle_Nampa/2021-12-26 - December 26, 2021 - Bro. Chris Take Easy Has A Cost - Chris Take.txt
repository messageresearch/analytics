brother scott reminded of the time that at 6 45 on a wednesday that i called brother chris up and said brother chris i'm i'm not going to be there and we're sitting there last night brother scott hold this watch out and at first i didn't catch it he holds his watch out and goes brother pollux 6 45. and i'm like oh oh oh brother chris was sitting across with me i said do you want to preach tomorrow

to have an action [Music] [Music] is is again [Music] is hallelujah amen we just want to take these prayer requests brother vasily gives this request to be praying for sister thomas she's going to be

it's just been a very very short while that she started having some pains and went to the doctor and the doctor's diagnosis is that she was clear full of cancer it had just traveled to all parts of her body but the beauty of this my brother and sister is that there's no crying there's no weeping there's no begging but a life lived for christ is ready at any moment any time any place and god granted time for their family to come together and to love one another and just celebrate her life but let's continue to remember the family in prayer and we want to remember brother bob and sister joanne always remember them and prayer lord just keep strengthening them brother jason of course my brother sergey and i have an unspoken request which is quite broad because there's several situations that are contained within this it's not really unspoken it's just many saints families have decisions that they need to make and these decisions have an impact on the days coming weeks months and so my unspoken request is just to pray for one another that the lord would help us make decisions that we must make amen and just to come and family relations financial different things

own thoughts and opinions lord jesus may it be the pure word of god amen you have your amen this morning turn with me to philippians chapter 3. it's good to be in the house of god brother jason is listening there's a lot easier ways to get a break i hope the lord touches his body amen philippians chapter 3 verse 10. pick up here paul in the middle of a sermon that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of christ jesus brethren i cannot count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth under those things which are before i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus in matthew 11. eleven verse 28 but we're gonna start in 27 uh apologies to the overhead guys all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in my in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light amen isaiah 53. isaiah 53 verse 2 to 10 and then i will let you have your seats for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor calmlyness that communist and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief his we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed amen all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord to prosper in his hands may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word may be seated this morning the uh kind of have to read it all but the main the main scriptures the main thing there is jesus paid it all he didn't leave anything no that's right behind he's not a per uh he's not a man that he could do such a thing he's perfect yeah amen and uh we read in matthew my yoke is easy and my burden is alliance uh title this morning is my uncle our pastor will probably have a chuckle with this is easy has a cost amen i hadn't thought of this until he mentioned well that should that would make a good sermon the other day and i was sitting last night studying and i had a totally different title and a totally different subject or so i thought but that was just the way the lord was going to push me into the scriptures and into the message and i was sitting there just thinking over what i had read and the notes i had written down i looked up and on my blackboard in my office i have this written easy has a cost and it just struck me that was the perfect subject and exactly what the lord was pushing me towards last night so we trust that he had his way this morning i read this scripture uh in philippians here over and over again last night just you know there's so much in the bible yes and there's so much in paul's letters the book of romans is just i've always said it is every verse is just packed full and sometimes we in our reading catch different things because the word of god is alive and when we're in certain seasons certain things speak to us but i just began to read over this several times and and just asking the lord that we would i would soak it up because i knew there was something in there that was starting to to manifest and come to to my attention and so i took the word apprehend and and paul says that i i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of christ jesus i know we can turn it down a little bit up here but apprehend uh the definition is arrest for a crime understand or perceive um but the apprehension is where that word comes from and that means to a rest so apprehend us to arrest the rest of our attention arrest um our focus strong concordance for that word in that scripture is to lay hold of so as to make one's own to obtain to to obtain attain to to make one's own to take into oneself appropriate appropriate so paul's desire in this scripture is that that he would apprehend that the bible that the word that should be all cap all caps because it's the thing that has fully apprehended paul already he says also for that that for which i also i am apprehended of christ jesus so the one thing that that that would bring out it would be christ what christ has in store the revelation of christ paul's desire is to apprehend a rest to have full focus full full uh from uh full take of it full partake of the thing that has already apprehended him and that thing that is of christ so before i get too far ahead of myself you know this happens to be their our last service of the year uh aside from our fellowship uh new year's eve and um the last sunday of the year and uh as as we all do and i i hope we all do we it's always good to reflect we don't have to do it at the end of the year we should always reflect on our life and the past what behind us but my title being easy has a cost over the past year where did you take the easy route where would you be today if you hadn't right whether that be in your health you know it's easier to not avoid the donuts it's easier to just swipe the credit card for something you can't really afford and not worry about it's easier to skip the budget meeting that month that week it's easier to just not pay attention or is it easy has a cost so we want to take that now into the spiritual so paul here is saying he's he's desiring to press he says i pressed toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus is that easy we are called to take up our cross every single day that's hard that is hard but to do the opposite would be quote easy has a cost to be taken of he his desire to be taken by christ and i'll read the quote here and and i don't know i you know the guys want the the things in order and i was just kind of scrambling so um i may jump to the quote sooner but brother branham says it's not i got the holy ghost it's the holy ghost got me and that is right here i am apprehended of christ jesus i'm just gonna i'm gonna cherry pick that i am apprehended of christ jesus because that is what paul is trying to say and um he says he says these days and he says he says but so we finished verse 12 and he says brethren i count not myself to have apprehended so he's not has not apprehended yet and i do believe that until christ is eternal even in glory we will be learning and apprehending more and more of him so paul's saying i haven't apprehended and perhaps we we won't on this side or will we ever because he's an eternal being but he presses forth so he says i have not apprehended so you guys haven't we haven't either but he says but that's a little word this one thing i do this one thing i do you see action is required it's easier to sit and do nothing but action is required because when you sit if you sit long enough you die both naturally and spiritually do not take action is to deny faith in god's word god has called us to step up and act upon his word to take up our cross every day we have that thing that we must do every day so he says this but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before so what is he doing what is the action he's calling us to in his testimony forget and reach forget what's behind you once it's taken care of forget it you don't need to revisit what you've made right you don't need to revisit unless it is to remind yourself of god's grace if it's god's quickening look what i did here and you testify of this that is one thing but he's saying forget those things which are behind you so over the past year as in the spiritual and the natural we still have a week left forget the times you took the easy route forget that pay the price stand up and take the hard or straight way to press forward so he says i have not apprehended but i forget that behind me i forget that which i have failed which i have mistaken because the devil loves to bring that to your remembrance because if he can make you feel weak he can make you think of yourself as weak you will begin to act as weak and he will cause you to fall so depressed forward toward the mark that in the scripture that for which also i'm apprehended all the the all caps that cannot be fully apprehended only fully pressed toward by forgetting what is behind so what is paul meaning what is his meaning in this that this that thing requires full attention and focus full attention and focus he says this one thing i do in other words the one thing i do to attempt to push to press to fully apprehend i forget what's behind me and i reach in other words you can't do both you can't look back and look forward at the same time you can't do both things you one of them is going to take your full attention is it easy or is it hard they both have a price they both have a prize it's going to cost you all to focus on the mark that god has set before us it's going to cause require our full undivided attention we need to be a arrested with our goal we need to apprehend what god is calling us to another definition is to eagerly take a hold of apprehend eagerly take a hold of so we can turn this around because he says that he is i am apprehended of christ jesus in other words god arrested you god eagerly took a hold of you god eagerly seized you i have it here in my written notes yes he wanted to make you his own to take eagerly to seize you and when you come to the realization that you have that to apprehend you have already been apprehended [Music] you see how god works he's his grace is all sufficient his grace goes beyond our understanding fully arrested of what god has called you forward taking action on what is in front of you living intentional you know i i hope this is i can take the liberty to say this it's a bit of a maybe a secular idea but they have new year's resolutions and last year came to my attention that there's a thing where where people say you know well new year's resolutions have never worked um they or they they maybe have but the percentage of success is very very low so they say just pick a theme for your year and try to to live for that theme last year i picked the fortify was it was our theme and this year just feeling the past month or so and i believe this is fully uh blessed of the lord to live our lives in such a way i think christians should be um focused and uh intentional with their life and so we told my wife that this coming year our word or theme is intentional and i believe as as christians that what paul is saying here is you have to be intentional with what you're doing you have to be intentional with the word of god you have to be intentional with the time you spend with god because if you're not easy will take over if you this we all know this if you don't tell your money where to go it disappears because you have to be intentional if you don't tell your time where to go it disappears you have to be intentional next thing you know you haven't spent the time that you need to with the word of god or taking care of that thing that god has been calling you to take care taken care of and so in that um oh i had something and i just slipped away be intentional praise the lord well maybe it'll come back to me there's always a price i'll go back to my notes that's what you do you find your notes and then that's where you start over again there's always a price to pay there's an example a couple examples first kings chapter 22 first kings chapter 22. you can turn there if you like you might beat me there verse 5 and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel in choir i prayed thee at the word of the lord today so rather than read the past few scriptures jehoshaphat makes a league with ahab to go and fight against syria and he says okay i'll before josh jehoshaphat being a man of god says before we do this let us the choir of the lord and on the side note after ahab dies and his son takes up reigning his son requests jehoshaphat that he sent his men along with his with jehoshaphat's men in the ships and joseph says no so he learned his lesson verse 6 then the king of israel gathered the prophets together about 400 men and said unto them shall i go against ramoth gilead to battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king and jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord besides that we might inquire of him now you would say well joseph at man there's 400 prophets and they're all saying the same thing but you see jehoshaphat was a man of god and there was something wrong with the atmosphere something wasn't lining up and pay attention saints of god when the atmosphere doesn't line up right don't don't just always say all that that's just me that's it if you have the holy ghost you've got that inner teacher you have that guard protecting you and your family pay attention when the atmosphere is not just right i don't care if everyone agrees upon this individual or this idea if the atmosphere doesn't set right with you stop there's nothing wrong with slowing down and making sure is it my own emotions my own pride whatever or is it god because there's been times in my life and and uh even as a young man i met this this couple and um it just something was off well down the road stuff came out that was very very off and it was the holy spirit witnessing uh picking up on that so not to lift myself up just to say i have had experience where over time it's proved that atmosphere that wasn't correct was the lord that's right so here we have jehoshaphat he says you know just not feeling quite quite right and and you know everyone's in agreement and and i don't know if you if you've experienced it but there's a group of people and everyone's all happy but it's a weird happy it's a surface happy it's you almost feel like if you said something they'd all just right that's the best way i know to explain it so joseph that's like okay this is a little bit too happy and and sure enough the happy was just on the surface because he says isn't there not another one and ab goes yes but i hate him but we were all in revival with 400 prophets testifying of the victory about to come past and all of a sudden there's this coming out of ahab jehoshaphat probably began to question right there his allegiance with ahab amen but as you can read the story the lord protected joseph act we do dumb things as sons and daughters of god but god still will protect us he'll school us jehoshaphat was chaste they were chasing him down to kill him it scared the boots off of him he learned his lesson but he god spared his life so he says there's this guy micaiah and uh i hate him he always prophesies against me and joseph says let not the king say so so the king of israel says come on run over there and get makaya the son of in-law and like verse 10 and the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah satan on his throne having put on their robes there was a nice sophisticated gathering in front of samaria in the gates where everyone could see it's a nice you know here's the 400 prophets all testifying cheering the king on would you like to be the one to disrupt that would it be hard to disrupt it or easy it would be hard now sometimes see let's bring this down home 402 we just say it's the prophets and the kings 402 people 402 in this message church all in agreement but your bible and your message tells you otherwise that's right is it easy or is it hard and which price do you want to pay that's right so micaiah so zedekiah the son of shania made him horns of iron and he said thus saith the lord man this guy was enthusiast enthusiastic he spent the time to craft these horns of iron with thee shalt thou push the syrians until thou have consumed them everyone had chills up and down their spines and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramoff gilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the king's hand and the messenger that was gone to call mikaya speak unto him saying now listen micaiah everybody down there at that revival is saying ahab will have the victory if you really want to have a position in this church you should do the same thing you see with the devil he charges interest oh 12 months no payments required that's the devil when i was younger and um i did that and then the interest came don't do that the interest comes and it charges you on all the back all the way back to day one and it's the worst interest you can ever have that's the way the demo works oh come on it's easy now it's so easy to go to buy that climb in that brand new pickup truck and drive off the parking lot it's easy to do but then the payments and the interest that's what the devil does he charges interest amen and so he's saying hey look this messenger to makai is saying look 12 months interest free simple down payment of two hundred dollars it's yours i said as the lord liveth what the lord saith unto me that will i speak you see wisdom in his response i'm sure in his heart he thought there's no way all them guys are right but until the lord i will only speak what he says so he came to the king and the king said unto him micaiah shall we go against remote gilead to battle or shall we forbear and he answered him found this humorous go and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king and the king said unto him how many times do i have to tell you tell me the truth in other words makai had done this several other times go ahead king do it no no tell me the truth go ahead king do it no tell me the truth see ahab even in his deception knew knew the truth you see you don't always know the people that you're interacting with or con having confrontation with you don't know their heart sometimes and they may know it's the truth and that's why they're acting the way they are that's why ahab was so upset didn't want makaya to come because he knew he was wrong so mccain says i saw all israel scattered upon the hills as sheep that have not a shepherd and the lord said these have no master let them return every man to his house in peace and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat did not i tell thee see i told you this guy does not like me all he does is prophesy evil but it wasn't machia it was the word of the lord it was the word of the lord so we could preach a whole sermon about this story but the the the what the i want to pull from it is and zedekiah goes up and he smacks makai and he says where did the spirit of the lord go when he left me and he says you know you you will see you will find out uh he says behold thou shalt see in that day when thou shalt go into an entertainer to hide thyself so he says that the lord sent a lying spirit down to anoint all of those prophets so it would have been my point is it would have been easier for makaya to go with the flow but it would have costed cost him a lot it would have cost him everything you see easy or hard it costs you all but easy is deceiving to make you think it doesn't really cost you all when you swipe your credit card it's scientifically proven it doesn't really hurt when you hand over cash it does yeah because your brain doesn't think you're actually partying with anything of value that's the way the devil works it up oh you're not really losing anything on this deal it's it's you're the one you get everything you see when everything's free you need to look for the fine print because nothing is free if it's free they're getting something from you even if it's just your email address so mikaya of the son of in-law makaya is is who is like god in-law whom god will fill up do you want to be a person whom god will fill up whom god has fully apprehended and then you have to take the way that is straight the way that is hard um interesting note side note zedekiah means jehovah is righteous son of shanna means traitor t-r-a-d-e-r he traded his position with god for the easy way out jehovah is righteous is the meaning of his name but he traded his name he traded his name for the easy way out for good standing with the king for for for um personal success the world's definition of success he traded that but micah was fully apprehended by god there's another example in jeremiah chapter 28 and some of you have probably already figured out this uh where we're going but that's okay keep it to yourself jeremiah chapter 28 jeremiah another prophet in the bible who really gave it all a good a good one to to look as an example and it came to pass at verse one the same year in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah in the fourth year and in the fifth month that hananiah the son of azura the prophet which was of giving spake unto me in the house of the lord in the presence of the priest and of all the people saying thus speaketh the lord of hosts the god of israel saying i have broken the yoke of the king of babylon within two full years will i bring again into this place all the vessels of the lord's house that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took away from this place and carried them to babylon and i will bring again to this place jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah with all the captives of judah that went into babylon say the lord for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon and the prophet jeremiah said unto the prophet hananiah in the presence of the priests and the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the lord he says amen the lord do so the lord performed thy words which thou hast prophesied to bring again the vessels of the lord's house and all that is carried away captive from babylon into this place he says yes restore but he says but listen here this doctrine doesn't line up with the word of god you see it sounds good right the lord would want to restore his temple lord want to restore everything that the enemy had stole from you the enemy had taken from the temple of god that is according to the word right but jeremiah says that idea now in this season does not line up with the word you see you can take some pretty good ideas and some pretty good doctrines from the bible and find a few scriptures or a lot of scriptures that line up with what you're trying to say but if it doesn't follow the continuity of what has been prophesied then it cannot line up with god's word so he says the prophets have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries and against great kingdoms of war and evil and of pestilence the prophet with which prophesieth of peace when the word of the prophet shall come to pass then shall the prophet be known that the lord hath truly sent him excuse me so um then hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet jeremiah's neck and break it he didn't like what he had to say right and hananiah spake in the presence of all people saying thus say it the lord even so will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years and the prophet jeremiah went his way so jeremiah spoke his peace and hananiah still tried to make his point still tried to take it you know i off i wonder if at that point if han and i would have said you know what you're right if you would have had grace i believe that was his warning but he stepped past it he goes forth and then so jeremiah just walks away then the word of the lord comes to jeremiah the prophet he says go and tell hananiah saying thus say the lord thou hast broken the yokes of wood but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron for those say the lord of hosts the god of israel i have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all those these nations that they may serve nebuchadnezzar king of babylon they shall serve him and i have given him the beast of the field also then said the prophet jeremiah unto him and i the prophet here now hananiah the lord hath not sent thee but thou makest this people to trust in a lie therefore thus saith the lord behold i will cast you from off the face of the earth this year thou shalt die because thou hast taught rebellion against the lord so hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month a price was set the cost of easy was hananiah's life death am i saying physically you're going to die no i mean that god can't do that god can't take you off the scene but death spiritually amen the cost of easy is death spiritually we're in a world of of ease if you don't want to walk and tour you know this historic downtown don't worry we have a little buggy you can ride on it's a little too hot don't worry all you have to do you don't you don't even have to walk the thermostat just pull your phone out and change the temperature is that stuff wrong not necessarily but it's easy i don't know who was it recently said it may have been our pastor was we were talking but it was someone and it's it's it's the devil it was a pastor it's the devil trying to push the curse that god put upon man back that's right that's exactly right the beginning in the garden of eden the man was cursed to live by the sweat of his brown woman um in child bearing and satan has worked over these years to push that curse back till he says i can sit on my desk in ease and comfort and work you see but easy has a cost they say for every like 12 hours of sitting if you don't do things to keep yourself healthy you take like a day of your life away it's actually detrimental to your health so easy has a cost but heart has a cost which are you willing to pay and i have it here the devil charges interest so jeremiah had a burden to bear jeremiah chose the straight way now here's what i want to get down to you say oh well i'll just pick which one i want to pay well this is what i want to get down to jeremiah had a burden to bear but he did not bear it alone when you pick the hard way guess what by his stripes you are healed amen he took your sin upon his back and he took it to the cross and he already paid the price of hard he already paid the price of doing the right thing doing that hard thing and guess what in the natural they've proven this as well if you do the hard things you are a happier healthier person when you sit on the couch and instead of going and getting fresh air or going for a walk and you just sit down it actually makes you depressed easy has a cost but if you do that thing the thing about easy is it costs a whole lot more in my opinion it costs a whole lot more you see the big sting of death has been taken from the heart by jesus christ he paid it all and he gives us he says look take up your cross follow me he preaches the hard way he preaches it i've come to bring division between a father and his son and his son and his mother and the families i've caught to bring the vision put you know just drop your nets and don't look back live with me do the hard things but then he says but my yoke is easy and my burden is light there's some brother brown says it's it's feather coated or it's the yolk is coated in love in other words it's the hard thing but it's the thing that gives you the greatest benefit and reward when serving god because ultimately amen you the reward at the end of that amen is eternal life with christ and there is a reward on this side just like in the natural you feel half happy and healthier when serving god amen you have strength and courage to face the day i'm not talking about people who have given up serving god i'm talking about you on a daily basis choosing to do take up your cross and follow him you will be a stronger and more courageous christian to face the next battle you see it's a it's a it's a waterfall effect i guess you could say you do take it easy well now this one is it's twice as hard and then three times and four and it just kind of trickles all the way down until you find yourself at the bottom wondering how it happened and it was just a few simple things here and there the devil slowly slipping in right that's right but easy has a cost remember praise the lord brother says in the message what does it take to make a christian life wow i didn't know that was the title when when you get this spirit in you then the burdens of life becomes light you see it's hard but his yoke is easy and his burden is light you don't notice them anymore the yoke is lying with feathers they become so easy and then the people that pile things on you you know what you're like samson at the gates of gaza who picked up the big brass gate and packed it up on the hill and when you get to a place that the holy spirit has you not you the holy spirit but the holy spirit has you you say i got the holy ghost i don't think that should be said you must say the holy ghost got me and then when the holy ghost gets you the burdens the yoke is easy then you pick up the big gates of gaza and pack them straight to calvary see you have to do the hard thing and pick up the gates but you have a place to take that burden to amen you have a way to let off that pressure you have a way to let jeremiah even though he was i think it was at this point he was sent down into the dungeon even though he was put in shackles and sit down there i'm sure he was humming oh me amazing grace how sweet the sound you see says god when you serve god when you put your foot forward you say i'm i have not fully apprehended but i desire to attain to that which has already apprehended me so i put what is behind me forget that and i press and i reach do you know what you have to do or something's a little bit too far you have to reach you have to reach that thing on the top shelf for short guys like me you got to reach to grab it in other words you have to put effort into what you're doing you got to reach for that that thing amen that that revelation that that that staying power you have to reach for it but god is there to tip it off for you to grab amen he says he says um the burdens the those cases and there and there on mount calvary you lay them at the feet of jesus and pray for your enemies not with a grudge lord if you'd bust him open no but with something though from your heart that dear god that man is a man like i am you see what's lacking in the church friend and now what we need is we need to be we need to start all over i've seen the quote there praise the lord you see jesus paid it all we don't owe anything but full surrender to him right fully surrendered to him and you see with the devil there's a catch there's always a catch there's always a hidden claws or or an asterisk or a fine print there's always a cost yes sir eternal life with christ is a free gift all you have to do is accept it amen victory in christ is a free gift all you have to do is accept it all you have to do is step up and take up your cross and god said he'll take the rest you know that song god he never promised that the cross would not get heavy or the hill would not be hard to climb yeah that's right but he promised he wouldn't leave you there he promised when the devil comes and the devourer comes to tell you take the easy road come in you know what it was christian the prodigal or the program was progress christian come on this way is a little bit easier when that devourer begins to whisper in your ear take the easy road amen he's not gonna christ ain't gonna leave you there to fend for yourself he's gonna provide a way of escape and when he does escape as quickly as you can you see it's hard the world says oh it's hard you know you got to wear a dress it's 100 degrees outside oh it's hard you got to wear pants and i mean why are you in you know we had this guy visit the office in phoenix there and we're all in pants because we're all believers he's like man i don't know how you guys do this because he was from like colorado or something wearing pants when it's 100 degrees outside and it kind of the conversation kind of moved on but i was like yeah we're not going to wear those women's underwear you see oh it's hard you see but but but it's not you understand what i'm saying it's not because god christ already paid the price amen and now all we have to do is accept it and he'll give us everything we need you see you see the devil tells you he'll give you what you need but he doesn't yeah he's lying through his teeth oh they don't worry about that man it's like you know it's like the classic you know double crossing i'll we'll take care of you he's got a god he's trying to rob the store run you know they're the guys that set it all up that's what he does he takes you in he says look i got your back and he doesn't not at all you played into his hands if you will but you see god gives us gives us wisdom he gives us wisdom so that circle back to matthew we're closing here in a minute let's go back to matthew 11 verse 27 i don't have it you do that for me oh i i didn't give you 27. so he says all things are delivered i gotta have to jump to it real fast matthew chapter 11. i'm sorry about this all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father state the son enter and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him see this ties right right into a paul saying i am already apprehended of christ jesus who the son will reveal amen amen on all things all things are delivered unto him amen all these things we don't have to worry about anything being left out all things have been delivered unto him he knows the ins and the outs he knows the other side of the schemes and he will give you wisdom and whosoever hit the son will reveal him amen i what an what a privilege and an honor saying to god for god to have come and eagerly seize you arrest you from your while we were yet sinners christ died for us from and even in our daily life you know all right you take the wrong exit the lord just arrested you out of harm's way amen easy has a cost thank you god all that all you that are labor and are heavy laden i will give you rest in other words before coming to christ they were heavy laden but you see when you go across into christ to do the hard you see it's a deception it's a deception to do the hard thing he says hey look my yoke is easy and my burden is light all we have to do is one thing and that's take up our cross brother brown says you have one thing you have to do lay your self-will down and when you take up your cross that's exactly what you're doing surrendering fully to him so i pray that we reflect over the jesus you want to come reflect over the past year and and strive saints of god to press toward the mark of the hulk high calling in christ jesus finding comfort and strength in the fact that he has already apprehended us and we though we were who knows where you were already hand selected already picked out so the devil won't want to tell you take the easy road you know just give in to the temptation it's easier but remember easy has a cost and remember as a son or daughter of god nothing will come along to tempt you that you can't overcome it see that's the devil tries to convince you well you're weak because you don't have enough strength to overcome this thing this temptation but that's contrary to the word god so when you go through great temptation find it and honor that god would say you are equipped for such a difficult battle you go through a hard trial find strength and courage that wow this is hard because that's how much confidence christ has in me don't she doesn't that want to make you do the absolute best that you can when your dad when you know your father has so much confidence in you he's asked you to do this very difficult thing you you you want to just lay it all down and just go 110 because of the confidence he has you see sayings of god many times we lack victory in our life because we accept the lie the devil has told us about ourselves but god's grace says we are more than able we are more than conquerors more than con what what is the word they use for the world the ones that can just defeat every conquerors but we're more than conquerors conquerors plus conquerors plus amen praise the lord let's bow our hands heavenly father lord jesus we pray that you would take this thought this morning lord father i know it spoke to my heart father and i know this kind of hits down where the rubber meets the road but isn't that where we are isn't that where we live lord jesus i pray father that you would encourage your saints lord if there's some here this morning maybe feeling a little bit condemned or convicted for taking the easy road for the mini today spiritually speaking and say i'm gonna forget what's behind me and i'm gonna reach forward and the next time the devil says take the easy road i'm gonna take up the cross and follow you lord it's a hard and rough way but it's the way that leads to life lord jesus and father you said your yoke is easy and your burden is light the devil wants to try and say it that that's not true that it's it's a heavy yoke and it's a hard burden a father your word rings true in this day that we live in today father that your yoke is easy and your burden is light father we thank you lord jesus lord we thank you for how you brought us through the past year father may we take these next few days lord to just kind of reflect lord where we are father by your grace lord jesus father looking forward to next year looking forward to the future to to being home with you we thank you father we

guys know she's not serving the lord right now and some kind of tricked her i guess so you pray that god would do something if not start something there that night amen don't go with me and take the hard ways that i will fall [Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] you
