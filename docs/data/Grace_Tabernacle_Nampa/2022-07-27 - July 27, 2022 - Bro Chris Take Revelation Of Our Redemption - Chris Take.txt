you start to think this is your reality that's when you start to go off the track but when you keep your eyes on heaven that's right and how beautiful it is compared to this how beautiful it is by itself it needs no comparison then that is when your focus stays on what you need to stay focused on plus it lets the pressure off amen just put on that put a song sing sing a song about your home and that feeling of homesickness kind of comes upon you amen while you're standing already you're gonna turn in your bibles to judges chapter seven so good to be in the house of god you'll have to forgive us tonight we uh had issues with the internet so we don't have the quotes but uh but ivan's pulling up the scriptures here for us if you want the quotes uh you can i can send them if you if you want the quotes come ask me i'll give it to you amen judges chapter 7 verse 2. and the lord said unto gideon the people that are with thee are too many for me to give the midianites into their hands lest israel vaunt themselves against me saying my own hand hath saved me luke 21 25. we'll come back to that scripture there if you want to save your spot luke 21 verse 25 25-28 and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring men's heart failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth in other words rumors news of what might happen for the powers of heaven shall be sacred shaken is this you are you perplexed are you distressed are your hearts failing for fear this is you verse 27 and then shall ye see they see the son of man coming in the cloud with the power excuse me power and great glory this is you and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your redemption draweth nigh ephesians two verse 8 to 9 your redemption ephesians chapter 2 verse 8 to 9. for by grace are you saved through faith that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast heavenly father lord jesus we thank you tonight for your word lord every time i have the privilege and the honor to stand and speak to your people lord i am reminded of just how beautiful your scriptures are lord how beautiful the revelation of christ is lord how beautiful what what an honor it is to be called a child of the king lord to be a part of this kingdom father the satan's eden is is all around us but god we have peace we have a time that we can gather together and feed on your word and pull up a chair to the table of god and there's more than we could possibly eat lord but father as long as we're hungry there's food to feed us lord so i pray that you just continue lord to move within us a hunger for your word lord a desire to get to know you more and more and more father we love you lord we commit these words tonight into your hand a portion of your scriptures that we desire for you to speak to us lord to take these thoughts or that you have anointed on my heart to put them together in your way and speak them to your people that my words would not get in the way but god that you would speak tonight we love you so much lord we thank you in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may have your seats tonight so my title tonight is a revelation of our redemption revelation of our redemption and my subtitle is whose hand hath saved thee now we read in luke that your redemption draweth nigh in other words it belongs to you it's not dad's redemption or mom's redemption or the pastor's redemption it's your redemption you get it by firsthand experience you're the one who walks up to the throne if you will and takes the book for yourself john typed the bride in revelations when he took the book that is your redemption that book is your redemption sometimes i think we at least i have in my my walk in times past separated redemption from the word it was redemption was something that was in the word but redemption is the word redemption the book of redemption is the whole entire thing and redemption is not just christ died on the cross that was necessary for redemption but that's not the whole that's a part of the whole and so i was thinking along these lines the other day and you know thinking about the uh restoration of redemption or redemptions restoration uh thinking along the lines of what of revelation's purpose because for me growing up and the message hearing preachers talk about uh the seals and and the thunders and different things those those kind of those key phrases that you hear tossed around i always wonder no those are the deep things in my brain as a kid would kind of turn off because i didn't understand it and so as i as i began to grow begin to think and and lately really been impressed upon me that what is the purpose of revelation why are these things in the word and who has taken them and made them complicated who has taken them and made them seem to be something that sister vanessa can't understand who has taken them and said you know we can't teach it in children sunday school it's it's it's it's a bigger thing and i began to think you know what is the purpose of revelation brother brown says revelation is more important than uh to us then we realize and he says that that if the bride can catch a revelation of the two frameworks in the church she'll be an invincible army but still for me that that wasn't what i that wasn't enough that wasn't deep enough i was talking to our pastor the other day and i know this is nothing new when you read the word of god there's a surface revelation but then there's a deeper revelation that requires work on your part it requires work you have to dig in you're sure the the denominations read and they can tell the story of the crucifixion but if you if but by revelation you dig deeper you find out god's great plan all the way back in the garden of eden from genesis all the way to revelation there's something deeper that god is trying to show us and and um brother brahms talks about the deep that call us to the deep because there's a deep to respond deep not as in complicated deep as in a secret that only has only been revealed to an elected few it's revelation what is the deep the deep is only attained by revelation so there's something in you that god put in you that can that can reach out and catch that that's predestination the deep within you is predestination to respond to the deep in the word which is revelation that was a lot um alana i feel like that was a big uh sentence there but so what what what is revelations purpose and and and i i uh i i laugh about this i finally realized my wife says you over complicate everything you overthink everything and i finally realized today why i'm an engineer i work i am a software engineer i think like an engineer and we are notorious for overcomplicating things if we can make something more difficult we will not because we want to make it more difficult but because we just over complicate it in our heads and we end up with way too much code than we actually need and so on and so forth and then you guys have to put up with that but um so for me but but i i think i take that and i have to i have to be uh i have to be discerning and conscious that i don't take that too far but i believe that that is something that god has given me because i don't just take it first glance i want to i want to take it and i wanna and i wanna dissect it and i wanna break it down not intellectually not intellectually but i pray god i can tell there's something more here there's something more than what i'm just reading in the pages and sitting in the back room i was thinking that's the difference when brother bram says don't read the bible like a newspaper that's what he's talking about there's something deeper he says read between the lines and you listen to his later his later messages he says a lot of things as well but the elect will catch what i was saying and he stops he says so much without saying anything at all because it's by revelation you see you that's not a man a man can't do that a man can't put the words together no it's god putting something a secret for for us to to catch a hold of him please uh just put your spiritual thinking caps on and and don't um young people especially don't they go it's a it's a an adult service you can understand this the bible talks about the 11th hour worker a fresh born or or a young person coming up in the youth group you can have the revelation this revelation that we talk about god can reveal you don't have to be a certain age to catch revelation of christ who christ is to you that will be contrary to the scripture so what is the important things and and uh um the importance of the revelation of the seasonals and thanks because because it's not just in the bible to be in the bible to be and i struggle to to to bring this out and i i just have to trust god to to to anoint your ears but it's it's it's when we look at and this was from my own experience and maybe i'm the only one i doubt it but uh this in my own experience i would look at these things and i would separate them say oh oh i love god and i have the holy ghost and then there's these things the seals and all that and so i began to think and god began to deal with my heart that you obviously we know you can't separate it's all god's word but what's the purpose why is that there what is god's desire so laying the groundwork there in we read in judges chapter 7 the story of gideon and i apologize for always actually i don't gideon is just on my heart the past years and abraham every time i study i come back to either one of those guys and um so in jud i was reading this the other day and it just stuck out to me in judges 7 2 the lord tells him why he had too many men that's right the people that are with thee are too many for me to give the midianites into their hands because i know israel and they'll take the battle and they'll walk away and say look what we did now i'm not what the what the groundwork i laid just put a little asterisk in your notes we're going to come back to that but he's getting god says gideon you you have too many men and gideon says well that doesn't make sense have you seen the midianites the bible says there were so many midianites and amalekites and their their camels and their donkeys that they they they basically trampled the ground the the the the uh where the israel lived they just consumed everything in their path and so god says look if you don't go to battle with these men israel's going to take credit for it and i was reading in ephesians because brother bannon says joshua parallels ephesians and i was reading in ephesians and if we read it here ephesians 2 9 not of works lest any man should boast so what what is this what is this thing that we're talking about for by grace are you saved through faith which faith is revelation that not of yourselves it is the gift of god so in other words it's a gift of god there is nothing you could do and the reason it was that way it was the same reason in judges that god had to take and separate the men because god wanted you to walk in this life to walk the life of a christian and know you cannot do it your own what does that take what it we're going to see here in gideon what it took for gideon to get to that place so gideon he he he puts okay let me back up here i'll get you ahead of myself judges 6 13 i just have it here and gideon said unto him oh my lord if the lord be with us why then is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the lord bring us up from egypt but now the lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites so the angel comes to gideon actually the bible says i thought this was interesting that the angel was sitting under the oak and then he appeared to gideon so the angel came down to watch gideon for a while he sat under the oak and he was watching gideon threshing the wheat what was that brother brown said i'll read a quote but the man says gideon was thinking about the word while he's threshing with his death it was the angel anointing his thoughts preparing him for the message he had to bring so gideon is is threshing the wheat have not i sent thee 1962 now gideon when he was out there threshing his wheat no doubt but that prophet's message was going through his heart what that prophet said i'm the god of abraham isaac and jacob i'm the one who brought you out of egypt i'm the one that give you what you've got turn to me there he and his father out there are threshing this sweet and an angel come to him or he thought it was an angel listen it happened to turn out it wasn't an angel it was god himself because it's capital l o r d s you see and when he spoke again so god himself came down god couldn't allow an angel there wasn't enough god said my son needs to hear from my mouth god said the same thing about you and i he came down himself in a cloud fulfilling scripture says my children need to hear from me directly not that brother branham was is god the voice hearing directly from god a revelation because gideon had some needed to catch something and when he spoke to gideon gideon was a little surprised this is the quote he said now mighty man of valor he didn't know he was maybe you don't know who no you are not now let me just stop there for a second did gideon jump and shout and get all excited when the angel said you're a mighty man of valor there was no kind of excitement in gideon gideon i like this gideon was a careful man he said wait a second you say that god is forced and all these things but i'm not seeing it he took the message from the angel and ran it through the word paul says if an angel comes to you and preached anything then what i have told you let him be false so gideon checks it with the word then he says okay let me let me really make sure let me prove the word i'm going to get a fleece and do these things you know we many times we take that those oh gideon just couldn't have faith but if we take it in that context and there's nothing wrong with using that example the the word can go many directions if we take it in in that way we would say oh god is is imperfect he came to gideon too soon but see gideon was making sure gideon was making sure he had a hold of faith now i got ahead of myself gideon wanted to run this thing out completely and see this god going to keep his word is this really god now he said might not he didn't know he was maybe you don't know you are you might be many of those mighty men of valor tonight sitting here you saying the old little church some little the little church small group oh my there was only two there him and his daddy there only has to be two here you and christ and that's all it takes to be a mighty man of valor so um here's gideon and he takes the word and he takes and he puts an offering on the rock and we know the fire comes from the rock and consumes it and gideon says oh this is this is this has to be god so so let me take and he does the fleeces and he puts him before the angel and god and he he gideon is is is what is gideon doing he's digging in like i said earlier he's digging in he saw this is an angel this is a message from the angel that that that i'm gonna go that he wants me to go and fight the midianites let me make sure i have the scripture right so well i want to back up here because the angel of the lord in verse 12 6 12 says and angel lord appeared to him and said unto him the lord is with thee thou mighty man of valor then gideon says unto him o my lord if the lord be with us why then is all this befall on us and where be all his miracles so gideon's response to that statement is if the lord be with us where is he where is the lord and the lord doesn't say oh get in you know drop that attitude knock it off um listen we're i'm here just just you know no god says go god that ignores that he ignores that he says he says i know your heart gideon i know what you're searching for and that's why i'm here so let's not bother with with bringing an argument to people who say well where is god then show them god live god out until people say i see christ in you people want to argue and say well this that or the other don't argue with them just live a life that will shut them up i'm sorry if that comes out too harsh i don't mean it in that context and then you know you're in competition against them but live a life live a life that will preach christ out to the world and so he says so the lord just goes on he says ignore that statement he says go in this thy might and thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites have not i sent thee in other words you're looking for the god you're looking for this the god of yesterday the god that the word the prophets told you these the same yesterday today and forever you're looking for these miracles you're wondering where god is i'm going to show you go after the midianites go after the midianites he says so then he says you know how can i how can i save israel i'm poor and lease in my father's house and the lord says i will be with thee thou shalt smite the midianites as one man. so he goes through the signs and different things but gideon he was digging in digging into the message he heard digging into the word that came from the lord you're going to take the midian heights so gideon after after he after he he does this and then he begins to gather an army that is too large now remember tonight our title is revelation of our redemption whose hand hath saved thee he gathers this army together and the lord says look gideon that's too big we'll need to cut it down to size because i want israel to know it's me so gideon obeys the word of god cuts the army down to 300 men judges seven verse seven if you want to turn there with me you can and the lord said it to gideon by the 300 men that lapped will i save you and deliver the midianites into thine hand and let all the other people go every man unto his place so the people took victual victuals in their hand and their trumpets and he sent all the rest of israel every man under his tent and retained those 300 men and the host of midian was beneath him in the valley and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him arise get thee down unto the host for i have delivered it into thine hand now look at this look at how gracious god is but also look at what god's trying to do god knew the lord knew gideon could not go in his current condition he was missing something we've talked about shamgar what was shamgar's defining moment i've said this enough times here you probably can repeat it his defining moment was he caught a revelation of his position it wasn't when he picked up the ox code it wasn't when he hit the philistines the battle was already won before he even touched the octagon because he got a revelation of his position now what is that position so gideon's in the same boat and brother and the lord says for i have delivered it into thine hand but if thou fear to go down go thou with furo thy servant down to the host and thou shalt hear what they say and afterwards shall thine hands be strengthened to go down and unto the host then when he down with fury his servant onto the outside of the armed men that were in the host and the midianites and the amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude and their camels were without number as the sand by the seaside for multitude and when gideon was come behold there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow so gideon sneaks on down to the camp in the midianites and he sits next to a tent and he begins to listen in and he hears this fellow begin to tell a dream he says behold i dreamed a dream and lo a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of midian and came unto a tent and smote it that it fell and overturned it that the tent lay along and his fellow answered and said this is nothing else save the sword of gideon and the son of job the son of joash a man of israel for into his hand hath god delivered midian and all the hosts the devil testifying of god's victory the devil knows he's beat but he lies to you to make you think otherwise the devil already knows he's defeated why does satan hate revelation so much right here this was gideon's defining moment he caught a revelation of his redemption the defeat of the midianites was just as much a deliverance for gideon as it was for the children of israel the defeat of the midianites was just as much a deliverance for gideon as it was for the children of israel gideon was hiding from the midianites gideon was having his food stolen gideon was dealing with the enemy on a daily basis this deliverance that god gave to him wasn't just for israel was for gideon as well but gideon had to catch a revelation of his redemption redemption for israel had to become a possession of gideon's he couldn't just say this is the redemption story of israel god said he's going to save the the israel from the midianites and all these things no that had to become something personal it couldn't just be god's redemption it had to be your redemption it has to be your redemption but how can you get to that position how can you get to that position as a son and a daughter of god you have to catch a revelation that it's your redemption you need revelation what placed the children of israel in their promised land they crossed over jordan they caught a revelation that the word given to them the redemption because that was their land abraham the bible says footsteps is possession abraham done walked every square mile of canaan it belonged to them there's actually a scripture and i think it's judges where's where the uh i forget who it is they come and they say hey israel you're on our land it's ours and they said and the it's j it's jephthah jeff the one who makes the vow and has to to kill his daughters he says to them he said if your god told you if your gods told you this land and this land was your land would you not go after that and take that god told us this is our land we'll fight you for it see jephthah had a revelation you see jeff that was cast out from his brethren as a as a vagabond but before you ever hear the story of jephthah the first thing in the scripture says jessa was a mighty man of valor so before we begin to hear of what the world says was wrong with jephthah because he was an illegitimate child cast out from the his brothers but he says he was the mighty man of valor and and and then when gibia uh the gibeonites got in gileadites excuse me got in trouble they went to him they said look can you save us you see what do they say they say when they want to make fun of you and they want to laugh at you but when they're in trouble who do they come for prayer you because they recognize christ in you they recognize something in jephthah said this man has the ability to slay enemies is that how you want to be known you want to be known as as the as the son and the the individual who can slay enemies yes i kind of like that title guess what you already are you have the potential to be an enemy slayer so jeff that goes and he says you know you and and this god gave us this land we're going to fight for it so um praise the lord i don't know what where i where i got off onto that but we'll just come back to the notes and so um gideon caught a revelation of his redemption but what was it that he grabbed a hold of what was it that he was able to grab a hold of something you see his fear was doing nothing for him i keep coming back to this god's trying to tell us something there's fear and there's faith fear whether i'm says is nothing but faith is an actual substance i have the quote right here perfect faith 1963. now here's where many people fail to receive their healing or what they're asking for so he says he healing and then he says or what they're asking for that covers everything because they take faith to be something that it is not see they don't believe it in other words so he's saying they're not saying they don't have faith they're putting faith in the wrong category they don't believe it he says it's not imagination this is his words and i love this it is a actual substance it is an actual substance again in the same message or in the same message notice it is something that you possess not imagination if you really have it saints okay i think i did this the other day but if i gave brother david this bible and he had a hold of it could i tell him he wasn't holding a bible no i couldn't talk him out of it they you all think i was crazy if i tried to say no that's not a bible that's a dictionary and the words of say bible right there on there you think i was crazy because that's faith that's faith you can grab a hold of it you couldn't tell gideon after god gave him a revelation god gave him a revelation of his redemption you couldn't tell gideon no you're going to be defeated by the midianites that's right michael you see sometimes sometimes our opposition doesn't just come from the outside when the devil comes with opposition from the secular world you could yeah well that's them but what happens when you're michael and your opposition comes from preachers in the message that was straight what happens when opposition comes from my brother or sister in the message who come to you and tell you you're wrong what are you going to do if you're right what are you going to do what's going to keep you what's going to protect you what is your shield what is your shield faith what is faith revelation so how are you going to fight like how was my care able to stand alone even with with um jehoshapha jehoshaphat sitting there a fellow brother who believed like my care kept his mouth shut he was scared to speak up he learned his lesson by the way if you go later on and you read it i think it was jehoshaphat he learned his lesson and when ahab's son said hey will you fight with me he said nope see a real son of god learned his lesson but even he kept his mouth shut he said you can't look to somebody else to back you up you can't look to somebody else to anchor yourself and you need to stand alone on what god has given you gideon stood alone when he put his entire sacrifice when he put the meal he prepared with his hands upon the rock he stood alone where was his dad his dad wasn't there he was by himself and he put his sacrifice upon the rock and when he saw the fire of god consume it he got a revelation this is god's word but then he needed to build his faith faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of god we know what hearing is its revelation so he said so he waited he listened to a few tapes he listened to uh part one of fleece is wet ground is dry uh then part two fleece is dry ground is wet then he went down and he and he put his ear to the tent and he and he heard the message of of of the deliverance of by the loaf of bread and something moved within him something moved with him and he realized you know what the 300 men are not i know i'll be victorious i had a a a a a christian but not a believer tell me something that was i just i took it to the you know i could tell me something that really spoke to me i believe it was it was the lord he says you must especially as a man you must become autonomous meaning it's just you and god no matter what happens in the world it doesn't move you that's right you're not dependent on your job you're not dependent on your spouse you're not dependent on your parents you're not dependent on your church you are autonomous it's you and god no matter what falls down around you it doesn't affect you but there's channels to get there that means coming to church so you do need church you do need your wife but you're in a position where it doesn't matter what somebody will say because that's the that i that's what i think which is the word so closely we would deceive the very like if it were possible is not just doctrinal right it's someone with good intentions telling you that's not the will of god it's someone with good intentions telling you no this is the will of god but you have to get to a position like gideon where you said the midianites are big the rest of israel is back cozy in their beds in their tents me and these 300 guys are going to go fight but i know i have a revelation he could have never found his victory unless he first caught a revelation of his redemption possessed he caught up he faith he had he had a hold of something the revelation excuse me the revelation that the same god for moses and joshua was the same god for gideon became gideon's revelation what happened the word from the lord and gideon's revelation pulled christ from history you hear about it jesus christ is saying yesterday today and forever you saw the miracles you saw these things you see you hear the word preach but it's revelation that's going to pull god from this bible this bible contains prophecy but this bible itself is a record of history it can't just sit there and be history this is your redemption you need to ask god for revelation so you can pull christ out of history so that christ stands directly before you and you catch a revelation of your redemption i hope you're tying this back by god's grace to what i said at the beginning with the purpose of revelation why is revelation so important why is is catching a revelation of the of the of the open word why is that so important and why do people listen this is this is actually easy people who don't have a revelation of the open world don't live christian lives the way they should you will find things in there that don't line up with the word of god so let me ask you something is it open or is it closed because you can never bring christ you can never display christ unless he's open amen in genesis chapter four we won't turn there for the sake of time i have become amen never mind not gonna make it just genesis chapter four we read the story of abel i'm gonna train her just because for reference because i have a hard time recollecting sometimes from memory but we see you see abel and cain come into the into the end of the earth adam preached to his home you don't have to to read it verbatim you just look at their lives what what else would adam and eve do but testify of what they did wrong and talk about how they they had the fig leaves and and then god gave them the animal skins you see in that ministering forth abel caught a revelation abel caught a revelation of his redemption the redemption of his parents became his redemption the redemption of adam and eve became abel's redemption now we know in context for the sake of context their their redemption was coming and they didn't live a thousand years but the blood of the of the lamb of the skin that the slain lamb covered adam and eve so abel caught a revelation of that abel had a revelation of his redemption and he goes and he offers a a firstling of this flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering but unto cain and to his offering he had no respect now in the message identification when cain offered the fruits of the field as apples and the fruits and so forth and made his altar pretty and said god will accept this because i've done all this and fix the great altars and i've decorated i made it pretty we got the biggest church in the city now this is you'll see here in a second why i pulled this quote or so forth god will accept it in this now quotations end so cain's no longer speaking but it says he god he accepts the work of no man's hand in redemption he accepts the work of no man's hands in redemption redemption cannot be manufactured by man you can't do it you can impersonate the gifts you can impersonate speaking in tongues you can impersonate these healings and different things but you cannot impersonate redemption the veneer will crack you cannot impersonate it why because brother branham said this is a secret so that the devil can't get a hold of it there was a silence in heaven for the space of a half an hour it was a secret revealed to god's elect you see the purpose behind it that was your redemption story that was your redemption story it's a secret and redemption cannot be manufactured abel abel brought a lamb and offered blood and god testified that he was righteous he says now pay attention right here he says how did he know it there was no word written in them days it was a revelation and so it is today but we have the word written yes but what's written deeper abel had this the the the ministering from adam but it still took revelation he had no written bible you have a written bible but brother brown says it's and so it is today we have the bible but so many people are living lives completely contrary to the bible confessing that they got it from the bible why because you cannot impersonate redemption it's a revelation that this is your redemption so then if i ask you whose hand hath saved thee whose hand hath saved thee who gave you victory over the midianites who is going to give you victory over the midianites is it you no it can't be because you have caught a revelation of your look up lift up your heads victory and what is christ coming back for an overcoming bride praise god that's why it's important don't focus on your problem don't necessarily if i can put it this way with liberty don't necessarily play god deliver me god deliver me god deliver me say god give me revelation because as soon as you realize oh praise god as soon as you realize this person here is not you you'll stop acting like that and as soon as you realize that that testimony of the devil that he's telling you who you are as soon as you catch a revelation of who you actually are you'll stop acting like that that is faith that is when god said abram you are now abraham then god could take abraham onto the mountain and said sacrifice your only son you want to see what was abraham's faith go read that story abraham take your only son and sacrifice him on the altar isaac on the way up says dad i see wood and fire but where is the lamb abraham watch what he says abraham who caught a revelation of his redemption knew this son this son was his redemption knew that this song would be he think abraham was a prophet abraham knew there was something coming there was something coming that would bring him that would bring adam that would bring the future generations to come that would bring job and these different ones back into their full position abraham had a revelation of that and he said son god will provide a lamb you see what was that was that for isaac that was for you and i god will provide a lamb he's asking you to take your one and only son that precious thing you hold in your life that thing that you hold up that you can't let go of he's asking you to take it and put it upon the altar no matter what it is it doesn't have to be sin or addiction it can simply be a revelation or something in the word you don't understand take it then put on the altar say god will provide a lamb what is the provision of a lamb your redemption your redemption the provision of the lamb is your redemption and that revelation is you as a son and daughter of god positionally placed in the land you're not going to be an ephraim you're not going to try to be growing corn in manasseh that's right that's right but the bear mentions that in the adoption series number two or something you're not going to be what does that mean you're not taking the word of god and putting it in the past or putting it in the future you're saying it's today you're positionally placing god's word all god's word is truth but it can cause where the eagles are where the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered but the bible says it's the condition of the carcass because the greek says vultures he says it's the condition of the carcass when it's fresh present-day god when it's fresh present-day word that you can eat it's eagle food but as soon as it's god in the past now catch this this isn't false doctrine as soon as it's god's word what is that as soon as you try to say let's go build an ark you're feeding on vulture food because that was noah's message praise god anyways another example here if i can caleb and joshua had a revelation of their redemption and jordan's crossing brought them into position in adoption number one 1960 but the believers the caleb and joshua outfit that was going on to the promise they moved on over into the land and took the land and settled down in the land as a possession and we never stopped by justification sanctification let's go on to the baptism of the holy spirit let's not stop at believing on the lord jesus being baptized let's not stop because he cleansed us from a life of sin but now we pressed on into a position to a promise of the baptism of the holy ghost the next paragraph down so ephesus here sets us like joshua positionally you notice joshua after crossing over the land and taking the land then he divided the land if from here manasses here and this one here god here benjamin here he divided the land you see when joshua crossed over into his promise how how was joshua and caleb able to stand against the opposition from within the church and then live through the wilderness wandering and cross over jordan how were they able to do it they caught a revelation of their redemption they call a revelation that that land was there that revelation will carry you through the wilderness that land will that revelation will carry you through false doctrine until god can bring you to a position that you can step into god god can bring it to a place that you can step into your position so when they got over there then then god could speak through the prophet joshua which is the type of the holy spirit could speak and say you go here you go here you go here it's god the holy ghost within you something that you have caught a revelation you see revelation places you as a son or daughter of god so it's got to be your redemption now in revelation chapter 5 part 2 1961 we find out what was being revealed let me make sure what is the revelation of redemption see he only says that once what is the revelation of redemption in those exact things he only says that once how was we redeemed so he says he says okay so he's he's putting out the question here what is the revelation of redemption and how were we redeemed he puts that question out and then he says just look here in these last few years what's happened so he asks a question and then it kind of looks like he moves off but he says the revelation of the name of jesus in water baptism the revelation of no eternal hell never was known before and you can't have eternal life unless you're saved you've got eternal life then you cannot be burned in hell for for eternal okay let me move on down a little bit now what is it what other things so he's answering the question what is the revelation of redemption he's answering it the plan of redemption just look what's been given to us lately by the holy spirit that's right abraham's seed what the revelation meant the serpent seed see this book of revelation watch when we get to it how it peels off and i proved it right here by the scripture that's exactly the truth i go plumb back in or plumb back in genesis and pick it up and show when that seal opened it come right back down through the bible from genesis to revelation did he answer the question absolutely what is the revelation of redemption water baptism in the name of jesus christ the truth of no eternal hell not no now listen just hang on a second i i caught that there um what is the the uh serpent seed what is it those three things no but what were those three things a part of the mysteries so what is the revelation of redemption all the loose ends tied together what are the what is that is it a mystery still absolutely not he popped the lid off the top of the mountain christ did that's the revelation of redemption god's word opened to you the book that was handed to john was your redemption the open of opening of the word we use that phrase but that just what that means is what that means is there's no more mysteries you can dig into the word underneath the anointing of the holy spirit by revelation and catch everything you need why why benefit himself to you you're going to speak truth you're going to be a doer of truth nicodem god was calling nicodemus to be a doer of truth but he couldn't get past being born again he manifests okay what he does is the truth what he does he manifests christ how you judge him by the way he stays with the word right with the word you know we say and maybe you've heard me say it in conversation time will tell do you know why time will tell because of this right here how do you judge him by the way he stays with the word it's easy if i can say it it's easy to live the word for a day or two or a week or two but give it time give it time amen manifest christ see that's how you know all man is by the way he stays with the word if they speak not according to the word now he's quoting scripture there's no life in them says the bible see leave them away so it's you you want to manifest christ and and in closing musicians want to come you want to manifest christ you want to you want to bring christ forth is that your desire i believe we can all put our hands up all not our heads all say amen i'll say yes i believe that if that's your desire you have to you have to get in because faith cometh by hearing the word of god that's right which is revelation so when you when you when you when you read the bible i'm going to do something risky here and you open the bible and you begin to read second chronicles 22 and the inhabitants of jerusalem made a heisei his youngest son king in his stead for the band of men that came with the arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest so alhaji of the senator horam king of judah reigned he he also walked in the ways of the house of ahab for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly there's a story at the surface but why is it there don't read it like i know okay bob and sue finally got married you know how they do and they used to do it in the paper i don't think they still do it you read the paper oh steak's on sale for 99 cents a pound why wouldn't that be nice but when nathalia the mother of a hazel saw her son was dead she avoids and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of judah but jehoshaphat the daughter of the king took joash the son of a hazard and stole him from among the king's son joe ash hidden away you read you're reading a story but what is god trying to say what is god trying to bring out and you can go into you can go into the book of job which i know for when i was young it was hard for me to understand and you pick up chapter 25 that answered bill dad the shoehorn said dominion and fear are with him he maketh peace in his high places is there any number of his armies upon whom does not his light arise how then can man be justified with god or how can he be clean that is born of a woman that's a story you're reading there talking to joe but what is god saying that is deeper how then can ban me justify with god or how can he be clean that is born of woman what does he put it there just to fill a spot but guess what god is his word and the word is god correct what does it say we will be learning about him for all eternity maybe there's things in this written in this book we won't understand this side of glory do i care no you know why because i know whatever i need god will reveal it to me see don't don't take somebody's word it says oh it's just too deep you don't need to know don't take a man's word you know what that is that's the devil saying shoot you don't need revelation that's what he's saying it's coming out of the mouth of a person but we wrestle not against flesh but against the principalities and the powers of the air we were fighting against spirits says god and those spirits can talk through your brother and your sister that's why you need the word of god to say to your brother get thee behind me satan we are still flesh we can say things that are wrong but if we all take each other accountable to the word of god and i want to i really feel pressed upon to say this and let's just bow our heads so i don't have to look you in the eye no i shouldn't have joked like that feeling what to say is you see good men with good intentions can tell you something contrary to the word of god which you need to pray is god i'm feeling led to do something a certain way now please this is this is coming from inspiration this is not coming from what i know or of you individuals here tonight but this is something that is coming from inspiration from the word of god and that is that you need to take god and say god what what in the word of god do i need to know to shed light upon what your will is for me please i i pray that you would accept that from the from the lord and not from my from what i know because i i'm telling you it's not just from me tonight i'm feeling pressed upon by the holy spirit to speak those words god you need to pray say god i don't understand why your will would say to do this show me in the word what i'm missing to realize this is your will and i pray i believe we can all pray that tonight god in prayer tonight lord jesus i pray father that lord certain things that you have called us to do lord that you know where we stand father but sometimes we don't realize what's around us we can't understand what the future is or why things happened a certain way in the past or or why they're happening in the present but god we pray you would show us what we're missing so that god we can better grasp what your will is for us there is a scripture is in ephesians that says something along the line of be not unwise but seek out the will of the lord in other words it is wisdom to seek out your will and father what you're calling us to do might seemingly go against what we know but god may we find in your word because maybe it's our thinking that is contrary to your word not you what we think your will is contrary thank you lord jesus i pray lord that the the the the befuddled and and the this thought and that thought different ways lord you just tie it all together father if i said something in my own opinion forgive me push that aside may they not even remember it lord and you your word correct the error father lord i love you i thank you father i thank you lord jesus for your word it's beautiful lord it is beautiful and we are privileged to stand up and confess that we are children of the king oh god that's not a mark we wear in shame but we stand proudly yes yeah i'm a son of the king yes i'm a daughter of the king yes excuse me sir can i tell you something i'm a son of the king it's something we wear with proud for i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ
