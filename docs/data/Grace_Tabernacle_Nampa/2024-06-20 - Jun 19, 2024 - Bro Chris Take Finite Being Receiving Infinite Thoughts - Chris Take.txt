looking now across the [Music] river to where my faith we live in inside there's just a few more days to labor then I will take my heavenly flight bu the land and I'm longing for you and somay on thee I'll stand there My Hope shall be eternal [Music] bu land sweet land amen praise the Lord man looking forward to that one day amen if you have your Bibles tonight let's turn over to 1 Corinthians chapter 2 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 14 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually deserved amen but he that is spiritual yes good all right praise the Lord he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath excuse me let's start over verse 14 now that we've got the sound here fixed be be distracted says but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God but for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ amen so we pause there and say well Paul um how's that work how can the natural man not receive the things of the spirit of God yet we have the mind of Christ right he's not talking about he's not selecting those of the world saying they're natural you're natural just me and you are super or super what we are me and you are natural for a natural man he says a natural man cannot receive those things of the spirit of God for foolishness to the natural right that's right that's why when you don't feed the spiritual the natural man says what are you doing in church it's nice outside or what is all of this you know because it's invisible can't see it but he says but you have the mind of Christ amen we just want to look at that tonight and by God's grace look at this impossible combination let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we ask that you'd come and speak to our hearts tonight Lord some things of the scriptures Lord are just far beyond actually lord they're all far beyond our finite Minds because you are Eternal and by by inheritance so are your words I pray Lord you'd speak to us tonight help us Lord just to maybe some of us are tired or what not I pray you just bring an atmosphere Lord father we already feel you near may you just come now and speak to us Lord as the as the words would come forth as the foolishness of preaching may you grab a hold of the word and and Lodge it in our hearts Lord mine as well Lord I want to hear from you tonight Lord Jesus I pray you just come and help us father this evening may you speak to us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you can be seated tonight so if we could uh take tonight this thought is finite being re finite being receiving infinite thoughts and my subtitle is Eternal Word transferred into time and uh sometimes you have these titles and um then you then you put pin to page and you say well Lord It's the inspiration that you have because the notes hardly match the title but God inspiration in in my heart that it's just been all of these different things my wife asked me do you know what you're preaching earlier today and and I said well I've just for weeks just had thoughts here and meditating over here and hearing brother brandham say this and and the reading of scripture here and and it all just kind of floating and moving together all kind of related in a way and and sometimes that inspiration in your heart just you feel like you fail to put it on the page so as we always should I'm depending on the Lord tonight to speak to us but taking this this thought here and and a lot from this scripture or Paul says you know the natural man can't receive the spirit of God it's foolishness to him and then he says he says he that is spiritual judgeth all all things yet he himself is judged of no man so so Spirit of Christ judging you right but this focus of that we have the mind of Christ so let's go to chapter 3 and let's keep reading here at 3:1 says and I speak and I Brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as as unto carnal even as unto babes in Christ I have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto you were not able to Bear it neither yet now are you able for you are yet carnal for where whereas there is among you EnV envying and strife and divisions are you not carnal and walk as men for while while one say say I am of Paul and another I am of Apollos are you not carnal who then is Paul and who is Apollos but ministers by whom you believed even as the lord gave to every man so so he's saying you want the meat of the word you got to get rid of envying and strife these divisions don't walk carnal don't think carnal don't walk as men right you're well how did that work you're a natural man it works the same way it does that you as the natural man can be take on the mind of Christ the same combination Paul's continuing his sermon and he says who then is Paul who is Apollos but ministers by whom you believe even as the lord gave to every man I have planted Apollos watered but God gave the increase so then neither is he that planteth anything neither he that WTH but God that giveth the increase so it's God it always is God it always will be God that moves in our heart and he's the one that makes this connection right so so you you are a you are an you are an act actual attribute of God and before we um let's go to Genesis 1 vers 1-3 really quickly in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light brother Bron makes a statement he says he says there is no light without God why is that because it was God's word spoken you know it's just I'm trying not to keep this from just because of the inspiration but slow down so you get it because if it just turns into mumble jumble so in in the beginning right we have we have time and you you can't have light outside of time time light is is is I'm not going to get too technical here but light is is is particles moving across time so God saids in the beginning so God laid forth time he laid forth the dimension that we live in right now he set it in motion and then he said let there be light and so his word spoke so now light has a place to live right before there was before there was light was just all of darkness and I've heard it said that light is an element used to measure the how old things are on the earth so how do you measure past when light was so light didn't used to be now light is because God spoke it but you see it was always in the mind of God and and you see brother bam talks about this and I think it's in the church age book and uh but he's he's it is the church age book and he's talking about he says I jumped way ahead guys it's the Smur Church Church AG he says thus the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint who has drawn up and which one day will be translated into substance sorry for how small that is and form but they are already real and eternal and part of God so you have to remember God is eternal he created time ready in the beginning first time of measurement God created time and into time he set forth his word so so his this is not his his thoughts are not potentially substance they are currently substance so you say well God's I am God's thought expressed and because we're humans you know we made up words to express what happens around us we made up language and we looked and we said oh that is chair right so when God said in the when God spoke and said let there be light did he say it in English there was no English right now you can argue with me about the beginning where everyone spoke the same language and God divided languages sure whatever but before men be to St talk to each other there was no language it was a way to express our thoughts to each other but we are F infinite finite thank you finite I don't want to mess that up tonight we are finite we we are we are created by God we are we are creatures of light so we didn't have no beginning we had a beginning the natural man had a beginning So when you say well well God I am you know God had a thought and he expressed it and that's how we talk about it but if God's thoughts are real and they're substance they're not potentially substance they are currently substance how does they become how do they become expressed that is how we ex that's how we express that's how we talk about God transferring his word into time say oh God's thoughts are expressed no they're already were there they are currently substance they just are now made manifest in time because God is outside of time so he's looking at if if I could be so so plain he's looking at it say this is time and he says okay in his his will has a season and a time so God says it always were there you his thoughts were always there and it's just you know you stop and you think about this for too long you lose your mind but but you don't want to get technical you want to get spiritual so God thought you were always a substance in God's mind you always were an attribute because if you are part of God you then have the ability to receive God right receive his word because God's word is eternal his word is eternal his word is outside of time brother random says and now we're back to the first quote there gentlemen things that are to be he said God in the beginning being the infinite God he's infinite and we're the finite his mind is so much greater and we are our we in our little finite mind cannot understand his great Infinite Wisdom but therefore when he speaks anything it may seem very strange to us to hear him say a certain thing in the scripture but it's got to happen just want to jump back real quickly on the fact that language and words you realize how much God condescended down yeah to interpret his thoughts in what we call words amen right he didn't leave up and and and hover up there and just just you know figure it out no he used our language to express himself to you and me so he calmed us it it down he you know little little us right creatures of time first second third right like time matter this Dimension yet he put He transferred this down so that we could get a hold of it amen you see so so much more than him coming down and living as a man and and dying on a cross it's him condescending to in communicate amen with me and you amen he brought his words what through the prophets why because God's words are Eternal you can't put a finite meaning and finite interpretation to them you have to have a man you have to have a being that has an open channel from the dimension that God dwells in to bring that down through into your dimension but the B talks about it all the time he said there's words voices floating through the atmosphere but you tune the radio in you can pick it up so God's words is floating through but he picked a vessel an anointed Prophet who has access to those words to bring them down to our Dimension God really does care about you so he goes on to say here he said says cannot understand his great infinite wisdom but therefore when he speaks anything it may seem very strange to us to hear him say a certain thing in scripture but it's got to happen I believe that his words will never pass away profound statement yeah because guess what if God's words are Eternal they never started that's right and they will never End Amen in order for something to end it has to start amen wrap your head around that that you are an attributing God somewhere somehow before there was even light time or matter thank goodness we don't have to understand that to make it but it's this it's this transferring right that's our subtitle Eternal Word transferring into time how how can Eternal mesh with time time is beginning and ending Eternal is not the how do the two go together you can't because you can't have Heaven and Hell at the same time right you can't have you you the the spirit of man the your spirit within you God comes in he pushes it out this what now you are a new creature in Christ because Christ pushes out that Spirit you still got the flesh right that flesh becomes the more subject to the spirit of God but the two can't dwell dwell together you know praise the Lord as soon as Jesus as soon as Jesus got off the boat from the Sea of Galilee the demons came the demon and the man came running down to what why are do you why are you here and what do you want because they instantly become subject because heaven is present so now me and you when we live our lives and we're we're sealed to God Heaven is present you know I I before this became known to me in a greater way you know we'd go to hotel rooms and traveling around and and you think oh we got to let's pray and bless the room but sometimes we would forget and I would I would Ponder why is there already such an atmosphere in here because the two can't dwell together so we step into that room guess what all those demons whoever was there before away they go they are subjected to you you are you you as a child of God you can't be possessed by a demon because you're already possessed by Christ the the womb right the womb the womb has been sealed nothing else can get inside of there amen amen but how how how does how how in the world does the Eternal Word of God come down and dwell inside of me and you because you have eternal quality you are not what the world thinks you are you are not even what you think you are before the foundation of the world you are in the mind of God so therefore there is a literal part of you that Eternal that is predestination that is that seed Gene of God we talk about without that you do not have a communicator to Heavenly places that's your antenna that is your connection to you know the radio right and there is none of this okay no there's a Clear Connection the only time that connection is broke is when we put the antenna down and say I got this God but you keep in tune to the word now you are receiving messages of Grace from eternity why because it's a spoken word through the foolishness of preaching amen written words will not save you that's right spoken word will amen why because when God's words are spoken there's something happening Beyond this Dimension something that is going and coming down inside of you and changing you to push back against this lifetime in matter because if we confined ourselves to this we would never understand God right you cannot do it the believer what walks in Heavenly places he says but it's it's God to happen he says I believe that his words will never pass away therefore I believe that God knowing that we in that we in our little finite mind could not interpret his great mind ready he transferred his internal word into time amen let's read what he actually says he interprets his own word yes sir how does God interpret his word he brings it to pass amen why does he bring it to pass because we're creatures of time his word over time God says look you're already healed but over the course of time you see the manifestation of that so God not only not only did God condent to use our language to communicate to us but he G giv you the promise over time because we understand time sometimes it's instant Miracle sometimes it's not but it's the progression of he uses 's progression to build your character that's right you say but God's Eternal you're right he he he doesn't need time he uses it because we understand time so he uses that to build the character inside of you Thea that builds from his word from the victories that you the victories that you receive in your life because John said God is is light I think there's just so much here we just have to think about because if God is light and he spoke light into existence and brother said you can't have light without God every day the sun rises every night the moon shines every night the Stars glow God is present amen so the actual elements that make up your body guess what they need they need light amen so God testifying even in the natural how much you need light the light says it's time to get up the light says it's time to to go to sleep the man said we can fix that so they made lights and now we're all tired and hooked up on caffine praise God he doesn't need any interpreter he interprets his own word by vindicating that word in its season amen now I've already kind of talked about light but I have this slide here because I've been thinking a lot about light because because there was a time when there was no light and light is is an integral part of everything that we do everything we do revolves around light hey you got a light you got a flashl you know it's dark is is the light is the power light on I got a problem is the light on right I mean everything we use light to indicate on or off charging or not charging right we have we have phones and with with lights we use those lights to interpret everything someone who who's blind they needed those that know the light to interpret the world to them and and and and and T light can't exist outside of time light as we know it cannot exist outside of time it needs it cuz light travels across time that's how you see it that's how you see something you know we we have the the light year and that's just simply a a way to determine how how uh I can't remember never mind I'm not going to go there but light doesn't exist outside of time brother in Revelations 21:23 he says and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof you ever wondered why because there is no time there that's right it is so light as we know it won't even work there that's right because there is no time so you need a different source of light the light of Eternity the light of a different dimension you see how much we just how much we interpret God through our finite thoughts says oh well light you know let there be light and well we'll argue about when there was light and if there was light and well in the beginning when and and and then the Earth was dark without for was there seeds there was there a previous civilization and we're confining God to our own interpretation of the world around us right and I think if we can break out of that box we'll see God in a greater way Amen brother says Jesus was the complete complete thoughts of God expressed so other words for the first time in history the complete logos amen walked in flesh amen amen you see before the cross there was a different kind of understanding of God he was God he was God on the mountain oh Moses you speak to us let not God speak to us he was a god of wrath and judgment prophet would come and and there would there was Parables and you know marrying the The Prostitute and having the children and all these things and they're going about their world there is no relationship so God the understanding of God shifted now Jesus is on Earth wow the complete logos so Peter says let's build the Tabernacles right here right and God says I am not done amen you see Peter what was he doing he was finite interpreting the infinite right that's it he was trying to interpret the thoughts of the infinite with his time bound mind amen you know time isn't even a isn't even you know we think we measure time but we don't really know you know I I read it me you know this is something man has created the measurement of time you say well the son yeah you know there's the days and the thing but 24 hours 12:00 that's something we created oh it's been three days you know we created this that's right days right God doesn't know days he uses days in the Bible to describe to us an event he's talking about but he isn't days that's right he's not time so I can't I can't take credit for these but present is now and only briefly past exists only in our memory and the Future Never Comes it is simply imagined that's what we call time we punch a clock by it we set God by it that's it but God is not measured in time amen God is measured in light that's right God is measured well that sounded hypocritical because light doesn't exist outside a time but God is measured by his word yes right which is his will you see even when you preach God corrects you in mid sentence so you know even and I already said this used we know words we've created words to Simply express our thoughts but you think about God you know and and and the fact that that he is not he's not bound to this so let's go back I remember where I was Peter says let's build the Tabernacles but then God said I'm not done you you you can't oh goodness gracious Brother David brother Paul you just you got to get it out so so God is there and and he's present and he's he's logos complete but it's not enough why isn't it enough why are are they not made perfect without you that's right because God had to do something he had to bring the Eternal Word manifested in a finite being but he couldn't do that on Mount Transfiguration he couldn't do that on Mount Si he couldn't do it before the cross amen so he comes and he and he dies on the cross and now we have the first church but John has a vision and the angel says seal it up why John's there he saw the vision go tell everybody it wasn't the time that's right you see God using time the corn of the grain of we had to go into the ground because God had you and I in mind yes the devil's gospel is you are worthless the gospel of Christ is you are me in flesh this is God all this we're talking about God you have those attributes in you amen seal up those things so that means during the ages down through the church ages you know up to we always say uh you know Luther and Wesley I say that CU I don't remember the other ones by by memory but we come down through this then we have Pentecost right everything's good but we still don't have whatever it was that was sealed up so God is going to shift his expression in time amen he says oh well you know the seven seal and God needed to shift God needed to move something in time because he's outside of it his thoughts are currently substance they're not potential so it was always there but there was a time there was a season there was a place where he needed a complete manifestation of himself on Earth again amen and he couldn't do that with what John saw sealed up that's right he says well why because a part of God was still hidden amen that's right so you see it's just a matter another manifestation of Jesus in flesh so you go back and you say well yes through the Old Testament yes there was a part of God that was hidden from the people then Jesus came and he and brother man says he was the complete logos the complete thought of God in flesh amen so he has to do that again because he needs himself revealed in flesh today amen amen that's exactly so he took the word amen and now we have this sealed up word we have this this thing there and and so God did what he brought a prophet because the word says he has to come through the prophet amen that's right it is said in the word that we need all the word to be ready for a Rapture there was no Rapture back then that is here that is right now at the End of Time amen amen that's right so he brought the word now we had an an instrument we had a being who had a connection to that Dimension and God said it's time it's time now to transfer this Eternal Word into their Dimension amen amen that's right how in the world do I take on the mind of Christ when the natural man calls it foolishness because you were already in him before the foundation of the world so they had the potential to be you today but they were in the wrong time right that's it that's right but you're in the right time so the word transferred the Eternal thoughts of God transferred down in this time right perfects them that's exactly right because they need you to complete it amen you see the word why did God seal it why didn't God end it there because you didn't exist yet that's it how could God close things up when a part of him is still not exposed so you say well the word's been manifested yes but guess what if you are a part of God before the foundation of the world and you are not yet expressed amen God is not finished that's it because God cannot close time one day the book of time will be shut but he cannot do that until all of himself has been transferred into time amen amen because you are an actual Eternal attribute go the church age book that's not my words you are an actual attribute so you see the Seven Seals then is not a great mystery because it is you expressed it is you expressed today it is the Eternal Word of God coming down into time it is the Paradox of a finite being receiving infinite thought that's right amen because God's word is the thought expressed so at a time expressed is just simply a manifestation of Eternity in time so therefore there's parts of you there's parts of you not bound that's right to time that's right amen so you say well God is not bound by time hello that's right neither are you that's right are you an attribute of God or are you not cuz if you're not you're not bound by time driving through the mountains I was thinking about death and when you really begin to understand how God is Not somewhere up there you know God is just a little faster brother brandom says he's a little faster and then we in flesh here in time we have the ability to walk in Heavenly places because we literally have the word inside of us which is eternal so therefore sister Joanne is just a little faster that's right amen death is just simply something we have labeled that's right but God looks at it as a transferring old praise God a transferring of time to Eternity if he can transfer his word from eternity into time why can't he just pluck time out into eternity oh we're creatures of time so this robe of Flesh lays in the ground but the real you steps out of time and we say death death right but it's just the transfer amen amen amen it's just the transfer exactly right amen you know I made them statement a little bit ago how we measure time and the future is never comes it is simply imagine that's not true for God's promises they're not imagined that's right the thing about God's promises God's future promises amen exist right now exactly righten but you being a creature of time you have to come to that that's right you have to come to that place why because you're a creature of time that's right and God says you will move through time to the promise that's it but what gives you the faith in the promise the fact that it's already now amen he told Moses I am that I am that's it in other words he's always present that's right he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that doesn't just mean his patterns are the same through time that's right that means that he always is that's it we quote Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and then we say look what he did then he'll do now guess what then was now for him amen he's not in time that's right so here here it is laid out for you and I just said it the other day but says you have all the power you need just you don't have the faith that's it so how do you break time how do you break time the thing that your flesh is bound by how do you break it Faith that's right Revelation that's right faith is revelation that's right so the promises is there ready let just bear with me as I give this crude example there's a conveyor belt of time and here you are traveling upon it God's holding the promises right here you want to hear you want to hear you want to hear that's it and he's watching you you you got a little faith meter above your head goes up and down sometimes and you got it you it's right here whenever you want it and then along the way like I said crude example along the way your faith Bing God goes drops it right where you are amen crude example right but I'm a creature of time so I can't help it amen so God's thoughts literal Eternal thoughts that's right that's exactly right he says well the disciples said it well then it's impossible for any man to be saved any you know as God says well nothing is impossible with God you see if you look at the promises of God as time he says well I remember when God did and you know God will brother Bram said don't miss God in the present that's it that's it because no matter when you are I just said no matter when you are that's past that's history already that's right it's it's a Memory that's right a memory may be recalled in five minutes but that's not how God works and so if we if we bound our the promises of God then we're always talking about what he did and what he's going to do but vam said so much in his sixth grade education that is just absolutely profound he says oh they're always looking to what God did in the past what always going God's doing in the future and they miss him right now what is he talking about stop looking at time that's it God is Not time he created it he said in the beginning what was before Genesis 1:1 God that's it and God is the word we gave him he told Moses I am that I am amen he used our language to express his name to us call him Jesus Mary praise God what language will we speak over there we will speak God's language let's stop fighting about if it's Russian or if it's English or if it's Spanish whatever it is there's too many language it's God's language why would we want to use a okay praise the Lord it's God language because a language of time will never suffice for eternity every language you've ever heard spoken will not suffice because it's the language of time amen but God is outside of time Hebrews 11:6 but without faith it is impossible to please him why because faith is the vehicle for you to reach into eternity amen faith is the vehicle for you to reach into eternity says Oh Brother Bram yes you know I just can't accept faith and he says well this big argument you know he's done there's several different places in the message where he talks about you know discussions with people and it comes down to the thing well you got to have faith well I just can't accept that well there's no other way to contact eternity that's right I I think it was correct me if I'm wrong I think it was before the seals the angel of the Lord says you brother BR you need to be more sincere he's talking about the proph more sincere why there was too much white noise you know what white noise is turn the radio and you miss the channel white noise and you got to tune it then you get the voice brother bam had too much white noise he had too much time too much time blocking his channel to Eternity amen you see when you can get sincere with God where you realize you walk those doors God will speak to you not if he will so you sit on the Pew all the kids and this and that and if you could be more sincere the channel That Faith Channel yeah that's right is wide open amen right we say oh God won't speak that's because you won't shut up I'm not talking about your voice voice I'm talking about the white noise you won't tune your channel you won't tune your heart to God because you're filling it with the wrong thing amen anything outside of God anything outside of God too much will clog the channel anything anything of time too much amen will clog the channel cuz you need less time more eternity amen am but the more eternity you feed on the less time you have that is the mystery of Enoch that is the mystery of Enoch amen he had no time for time that's good amen for he that cometh to God must believe that he is that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen sincerity just drives you to seek him more diligently cuz you realize wow this is real this is real that's it Samaran Church age thus thus the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real they are not simply like a okay I read this one already Yep they're not like something that God that has to come it's already there later on same chapter he says that means that we were right there with him that's in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world you're read ahead that gives an eternal quality to the elect ready you can't get away from that amen amen you can't get away with it like God can't stop being God Amen how can an eternal being stop being eternal that's right and how can an eternal quality be stuck in time this is the connection that's why he says well the elect will hear why because there's a literal part of you that is eternity that's it time can't hear eternity that's it time cannot hear eternity time is is manipulating or excuse me time is manipulated by eternity but time cannot hear eternity you know there's an example it's an old one but if about the second and 2D versus 3D right we're Liv a threedimensional world but and if you took and you shoved an apple through the second dimension they would just see the slices and if you pick them up and pull them into the third dimension they would have no idea what's going on so threedimensional can manipulate the second dimension right flat but they can't do anything to us they can't come up here so time can't do nothing to Eternity so they look at you and they say what what do you believe there's nothing they don't have that attribute that's it so they can't all they're all just they're just time and how do we and and that's why we write hell will cease to exist because it's time God created the angels He created Lucifer Lucifer fell time so then when God closes time well they'll go away with it because they're just creatures of time that's it oh man I don't think you're getting it that's the negative side the positive side is you have a literal quality of Eternity inside of you so when time folds guess what you keep going am because you can't be bound by time where do you find more victory in your life you tune to Eternity that's it amen where do you find more revelation of God you tune to Eternity time can't feed you time can't help you besides you don't have enough of it anyways praise God John 5:24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passes from death death unto life how many of us have read this scripture and interpreted as we have to receive we have to bring in the word into us so therefore we live forever that might be an interpretation of it but he that heareth the word guess what only those with an eternal quality hear the word so they already have everlasting life he that heareth my word in other words in plain English if you can understand what I'm saying unto you and you can believe what I'm saying unto you then that means you have eternal inside of you and if you have eternity inside of you you've already passed from Death unto life before the foundation of the world you passed from Death unto life because you always were and always will be that is how a finite being can receive infinite thoughts because an eternal quality hlu lays inside of you there is no other way for eternity to come down into time and Lodge inside of your heart unless you are eternity that's EX EXA right praise be to God that's exactly right and we've already passed from Death unto life right both spiritually and naturally oh goodness amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's right and no man's better than his word if you make a promise you should always keep it or tell the reason why you can't let them know because a man's word is his bond that's right and God's word is his bond if God doesn't keep his word then it isn't the word of God that's right telling you slow down when you read the message but if he does keep his word then he's God in his word is he God in his word is he God in his word God is still in his word and when his word comes in you then your word becomes his word that's it praise God you see there was a time you didn't know you had Eternal attributes but then you heard his word for the first time why did it make a difference you know it doesn't matter the doctrine you heard you know we say well we heard serpent seed and the light turned on it wasn't serpent seed it was the truth amen that's it you heard the truth for the first time brother B tells a story about the eagle in the chicken yard what made the difference just the pitch in the Eagle's voice when she cried out no it was a voice he recognized and when he recognized that voice he remembered who he was it was Truth for the first time he heard truth that is why the Bible says know the truth and the truth shall set you free how does the truth set you free because it's God's word amen and if it's God's word then his word becomes your word amen and what is he he he is Victory that's it he is eternity amen he is Faith that's it he is healing that's right he is Deliverance somebody asked me to otherday says brother Chris I'm really trying to overcome bitterness in my life and I thought I had it under control I just don't know what to do I said you just need more word it's that easyy you don't need to go somewhere and find something that's right you just need more word because word can't dwell with nonword right right in other words truth cannot exist in false that's it because the two together is what still Al lie that's right so I said you just need more word and I said some sometimes speaking on bitterness sometimes you'll have that in your life and I don't even know if there's ever a way to completely rid yourself of that remembrance and that feeling because you're Are a Human Being I said but the way you know God's in control and has taken care of it is that Spirit comes and Whispers those memory of the past and that bitterness raises up and the Holy Spirit says not today that's right that's how you know that's it right a man that's been delivered from lust guess what there's always a woman there's always a temptation but when the spirit of God comes around and says no that's right that's when you know God's got under control the desire to lie someone has a has a problem with lying the desire is going to come you're going to feel that well you could just tell a lie here right now and every time before you did so what changed there's too much word that's it so the word say says Nope not today amen and without even thinking you avoid the Trap without even giving us the flesh says no no no no and all of a sudden you just go the other way amen and you wonder how did that happen how did that happen the word said no not today amen if you go if you get anything from tonight just remember this one line the word said no not today so God's word is his bond if he doesn't if God doesn't keep his word okay when his word comes in you then your word becomes his word in other words you have no word of your own that's it you you he is your logos that's it that's it you know you are known by your words amen your word that's how we know you you know somebody who doesn't ever say anything you've never had a chance to talk to you don't know them that's right you can judge them because you know the world today we have cultures you might be able to tell which culture they're from which fad they're a part of depending on what they wear whether they have a Stanley or whether they have a a pair of Birkin stock sandals on right but until they talk you don't know them so I know Brother David because of the fellowship that we've had and you can't Fellowship without word that's right so you're known by Your Word so you say man how do they know I was a Christian because you don't have your own word you have logos his word your word becomes his word amen so now what word are you known by you're not known by Paul haly you're known by Jesus Christ that's right because your word became his word that's right I'm not knowing I Chris take no I'm known as Jesus Christ that's right well they call me Chris because that's what the flesh is named but my spirit man is Mrs Jesus Christ his word becomes your word becomes his word that's why if you speak amen amen it hopefully you can sleep tonight he don't just laying B thinking wow wow wow wow because I probably will that's what brings it to pass whatever you've asked just as simple as that God is a Creator God created everything all good things come from God and wrong things evil things is the right thing perverted you know he he he's talking it might even be in this message I can't remember but he's talking about how how the devil can't create he says that the devil can't create he says if I cut my hand and I go to the doctor they can sew me up they can put the whatever it is on there to to and they say well you know brother's talking about if he's talking to somebody else they say well yeah the doctors healed you and he says he says no he says God healed me excuse me the medicine assisted and he just lays it out so beautifully now I wish I would have put the quote in here but he says if if I was if I cut myself and then I died all the medicine in the world can patch that up and it will never heal he says so the devil can't create so no matter what happens to you in your life spiritually speaking there's a cut well the healing attribute is already inside of you amen right amen you're alive in Christ right so you cut yourself now you'll put a band on it it'll heal itself right up because there is a life that's what he says he says the person said well yes of course you won't ever heal while you're dead because there's no life and he says now you've got the main line that's right he said exactly it's the life the life so what what is it that that heals oh goodness the world's going to cut you your brother's going to cut you your sister's going to cut you but when you already have that life inside of you that's right that's it it's going to heal it that's right it's going to heal it take the knocks and the drags of the people but God comes because it's the life so you say well that's good for for injuries spiritual injuries natural injuries yes but all that does is prove there's a life amen right the life is there brother talks about the hemoglobin hemoglobin is the life is the life in the blood that's right so it's not just the blood there's a lot of blood but is the life in the blood if the life's in the blood then guess what so you've got Christ in the blood you've got that Eternal attribute in the blood you have a connection to Eternity and your word is replaced with logos amen I feel like I could keep going but that's that's all we have for tonight Saints when you really stop and you think about how much how much we can find God to time you you you really stop and and and say is you know what time is time is doubt okay that's right it's doubt because the opposite of time is eternity amen and that's Revelation that is faith that is God so time is just there to make you doubt says well you know oh they passed away oh they're still sick our sister Elizabeth still sick what God's outside of time we look at it say well the progression of time you know she's just you know going through it and going through it but God is not bound by time and if God isn't Bound by time his word isn't Bound by time his promises aren't Bound by time so what do you have need of you have need of something and you're not there yet guess what he's waiting for you amen he's waiting for you but he's patient because he told the the disciples on the ship oh ye of little faith when stop that's how you do it not in an arrogant way he says children that's how you do it you see what happened was you didn't have the faith oh you have the power but you didn't have the faith oh praise God Amen you know they've even proven that time is relative right Einstein's theory relativ relativity I have watched and I have studied that and I do not know it well enough to try to explain it except for the fact that if you can speed up fast enough time pauses tell me God ain't in that where is he how is it look you see God himself created everything and Lord can help me say this in closing so when you Rapture it's not going to be magic it's going to be God saying all right now it's time to show you what's been laying there all this time and he pulls he grabs light by the tail he pulls it through time and there you go amen it's not going to be magic same thing when he heals you when he delivers you when he sets you free you know I was reading I I said I was closing I was reading uh I'm reading again this book that that sister April shared with us about a year ago called God's Smuggler and I'm reading it again and and and the man had a crippled ankle and and here God's calling him to the mission field and he can't even walk and says how am I going to go if I can't even walk a city block and so he's sitting on the the poers as they call him over there the Netherlands and and he's sitting there saying God what is it that I haven't haven't given it to you what what what am I holding on to that just I can't seem to to break free of all of the cares of everything and it just struck him I've always said yes but yes but my ankle yes but he said Lord right here right now I'm going to say yes to you and whatever it is however it is you want to do it it'll be yes so he says I say yes he got up and his leg went and he went oh no and he touched it and he walked for the first time since the accident painfree amen God completely healed him what was it total surrender to the word amen so what is it what what is your crippled ankle what is your ankle in your spiritual life you just keep saying yes but yes but when I'm a better Christian yes but when I can do this yes but all God is asking you to do is just say yes every time just say yesen that's right just say yes amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Lord I just pray that you would just take everything that was said and and father it would just be each individual here tonight has a certain need and father by your grace you filter the word spoken to that need and so each one may be heard it a little bit different but because it was your word it was direct to their need I pray now father they would take it they would hold on to it father further study further devotion is needed Lord as always with the preaching of the word there's more to see more to chew on more to read I pray Lord that each one would take home father and just put to study what has been said tonight Lord that father as they study not in may may seem to be in an intellectual way but it's the transferring of your word into our hearts because we hold the key to Eternity and that's only because you said so we didn't we didn't we weren't even alive enough we weren't alive to even know to say yes we'll be Eternal you who chose us we didn't even have an opportunity to turn you down thank you God we didn't even have an opportunity to say yes or no we always were a part of you the victory therefore as we heard it said last weekend we are fighting from Victory because we are Victory because we are a part of you anything that was said of my own opinion my own thoughts may you move that aside father we only want you your word inside of us so that our word becomes your word so that the logos would just take over everything Lord we said a few things tonight on bitterness lying different things Lord if you've hid an n in someone may you give them the strength to just take on word and more word give us all there's all we all have something Lord we all have a little thing here well we all have a thing there is no size in your eyes may you just help us to overcome help us to take in the more of that word father we can climb up the ladder father because our goal is perfect love our goal is perfection and if we can reach that point father you we will separate from time forever thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you know one little closing comment we all we talk about faith so much but do you realize faith is the first rung on the ladder that's right that's right amen listening this I'll say yes Lord yes I'll say yes Lord yes your will and to I guess I know Lord yes I will trust you and with my whole heart I'll agree and my answer will be yes amen amen praise the Lord I don't know that one sorry amen can we can we um amen actually can we sing that right there you have 979 the power of your love amen condescending down to just be to communicate to us why why did he have to take on our language because he cares that much because you're his attribute expressed into time and he needs to find you and get you he need you back for him to be complete amen Lord I come to you let my heart be changed renewed flowing from
