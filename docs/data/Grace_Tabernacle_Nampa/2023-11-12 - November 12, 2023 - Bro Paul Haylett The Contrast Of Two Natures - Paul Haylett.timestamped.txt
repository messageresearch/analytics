[42:34] the first are Amen to testify amen amen
[42:39] sir I don't want to let all the other
[42:41] options all the other voices be
[42:44] finished and then say well maybe I do
[42:47] have something to say you know we kind
[42:49] of view it in humanity a little
[42:51] presumptuous when somebody says you have
[42:52] a testimony and somebody jumps up I do
[42:56] but you know I was just reading and the
[42:58] prophet of God says you know we ought to
[43:00] be quick to give praise and honor to the
[43:03] Lord amen Lord help us to be quick amen
[43:07] is it good to be in the house of the
[43:09] Lord today Hallelujah you know it's uh
[43:13] it's just a good good time to be a
[43:16] Christian amen we're living in a world
[43:18] that's falling apart economies falling
[43:20] apart countries are falling apart and
[43:23] the bride is coming together amen that's
[43:26] the word of God the the very adhesive of
[43:30] this gospel is drawing a people together
[43:33] not around personality not about power
[43:35] not about the beauty of a church but
[43:37] about the word of God and I say thank
[43:40] you amen and um you know I just uh a a
[43:45] little prayer request that I would just
[43:47] like to bring up to you um I just made a
[43:51] deal with a little sister the other day
[43:54] uh and I won't go into it here here uh
[43:57] but uh I made a deal with a little
[43:59] sister the other day and kind of caught
[44:01] her off guard and I just said um it was
[44:04] a visitor uh and I just said um you know
[44:07] can I make a deal with you and she
[44:09] looked at me a little bit you know not
[44:12] suspicious I would say but like okay
[44:14] what and I said I'll pray for you you
[44:17] pray for me and she eagerly grasp that
[44:21] and you know I I got to thinking about
[44:24] that Saints and I I've been uh doing my
[44:27] best to to remember to pray for her not
[44:30] just once a day but to lift this little
[44:33] girl now if we look at the
[44:36] outside sometimes we look at the
[44:39] outside we look at the outside that's
[44:42] right absolutely right and we judge by
[44:45] the
[44:47] outside but down inside can be a heart
[44:50] that is so hungry for the things of
[44:53] God and in that some sometimes all they
[44:57] need is just a little help amen starting
[45:01] out in the walk am a little help to take
[45:04] those first difficult steps because if
[45:08] we could see into the spiritual world we
[45:10] would see every step that a son or
[45:12] daughter of God makes towards the Lord
[45:14] the devil's over there saying oh no no
[45:17] no remember we're your
[45:19] friends
[45:22] right we need to lift one another up in
[45:25] prayer amen our young people our
[45:29] families our elderly how easy it is I
[45:34] try my best and I I don't say this any
[45:36] kind of judgmental Factor don't
[45:38] misunderstand me I try my best to keep
[45:41] brother Bob and sister Joanne's name on
[45:43] our prayer list before the church
[45:45] because you see if we're not
[45:47] careful they're not here what's the old
[45:54] phrase we're not examp
[45:57] right let's continue to lift one another
[46:01] up in fervent prayer amen amen amen I
[46:07] pray let that be our commitment to one
[46:08] another amen amen I pray for you you
[46:11] pray for me amen and then as we have a
[46:14] whole body praying for one another if we
[46:16] was to draw the graph I've seen it done
[46:19] this way you draw the graph and every
[46:21] connecting line leaves almost a perfect
[46:25] perfectly solid painted
[46:28] picture because there's the prayers
[46:30] going every which
[46:32] direction and I say God help us to have
[46:35] that commitment to each other let's
[46:37] stand this morning I I I can tell
[46:39] already I'm going to be in trouble
[46:42] because um I I have left a lot of holes
[46:46] in this you'll find there there's you
[46:48] your mind will take you to a lot of
[46:49] scriptures and say brother Paul didn't
[46:51] touch on that I did but they're on the
[46:53] desk I cut them off and it's still a lot
[46:56] of food amen anybody come hungry this
[46:59] morning hallelujah hallelujah let's turn
[47:02] in our Bibles to Matthew 24:
[47:08] 3-13 and as we would just look at this
[47:10] we're going to draw uh just one verse
[47:13] really is my main focus but um you know
[47:17] it's good to just have a good foundation
[47:20] right um it's uh good that we we don't
[47:23] just isolate things but we keep things
[47:26] continuity amen Matthew 24 and3 and as
[47:30] he sat upon Mount of Olives the
[47:32] disciples came unto him privately now
[47:34] there's already been a public expression
[47:39] you know the public has all kinds of
[47:40] questions my brother and sister but let
[47:42] me just speak kind of boldly today if
[47:44] yall don't mind we serve a God who gives
[47:47] answers amen he doesn't leave us with
[47:51] questions he answers the questions now
[47:55] it might be in his time his season and
[47:57] we'd say Lord why didn't you come sooner
[47:59] but his plan is perfect but I'm telling
[48:02] you my brother and sister when you do
[48:04] and I I won't go into this because I've
[48:06] just been wandering all kinds of rabbit
[48:07] Trails this last week but I'm telling
[48:10] you my brother and sister you go into
[48:11] the world of major denominational
[48:14] Theology and they have answers that you
[48:17] look back at scripture and say how can
[48:19] they come up with that conclusion but by
[48:22] God's grace Can someone say by God's
[48:25] grace
[48:26] amen we have a word that has aligned us
[48:30] and we look and it's not just oh this is
[48:33] our Theology and we're going but it's
[48:35] there that the word has its own Rabbit
[48:37] Trail and if you'll understand what I'm
[48:39] saying is you'll start down this path
[48:42] and it will connect you here and it will
[48:44] connect you here and it will connect you
[48:46] here and here and here and here and here
[48:47] and here until you find out what you
[48:50] believe is the Bible That's Right amen
[48:53] you say well of course it is brother
[48:54] Paul no there's a difference you see
[48:56] what some people believe is in the Bible
[48:59] what you believe is the Bible there's a
[49:03] lot of
[49:03] difference lot of difference absolutely
[49:08] Trinity has scriptural
[49:10] footing without Revelation that's
[49:13] right amen anybody know where I
[49:19] was okay he said upon Mount olives the
[49:22] disciples came unto him privately saying
[49:24] tell us when shall these things be and
[49:26] what shall be the sign of thy coming and
[49:28] of the end of the world Jesus answered
[49:31] and said unto them take heed that no man
[49:33] deceive you that's a good start isn't it
[49:36] for many shall come in my name saying I
[49:38] am Christ and shall deceive many now the
[49:41] prophet of God said if they actually
[49:42] come and said they were the Christ no
[49:44] one would believe them but they are
[49:47] Christ meaning anointed one so they've
[49:50] come saying they're anointed and ye
[49:52] shall hear of wars and rumors of wars
[49:55] and hamash shalt attack Israel see that
[49:59] you be not troubled for all these things
[50:01] must come to pass but the end is not yet
[50:04] for nation shall rise against nation and
[50:07] Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall
[50:09] be famines and pestilence and
[50:10] earthquakes and diverse places and all
[50:13] these are the beginning of Sorrows then
[50:17] shall they deliver you up to be
[50:19] afflicted and shall kill you and you
[50:21] shall be hated of All Nation for my
[50:23] name's sake and then shall any be
[50:26] offended boy that sure come to pass and
[50:28] shall betray one another and shall hate
[50:30] one another and still believe the
[50:32] message and many false prophets shall
[50:34] rise and shall deceive many and because
[50:39] of iniquity I put the of in there
[50:42] because iniquity shall abound the love
[50:46] of many shall wax cold but he that shall
[50:49] endure until the end the same shall be
[50:51] saved can we say Amen thank you Lord
[50:54] Jesus father for the enduring power of
[50:56] your word Lord the protective power of
[50:59] the blood Lord that holds us day by day
[51:02] in the E and flow of everything of Life
[51:04] Lord you're here you are our Strong
[51:06] Tower our sword our Shield you are all
[51:09] in all you're the King of Kings the Lord
[51:12] of lords father we fail to even identify
[51:15] you Lord correctly and in fullness
[51:18] father help us Lord Jesus to see you
[51:21] give his eyes to see Lord I pray in the
[51:24] name of Jesus Christ Christ amen and
[51:27] amen you may be
[51:31] seated now Webster says that iniquity is
[51:34] the quality of being unfair or evil
[51:37] something that is unfair or evil a gross
[51:41] Injustice a wickedness a wicked act or
[51:44] thing sin now as we look at this my
[51:48] brother and sister the prophet of God
[51:49] actually brings out to us a slightly
[51:53] different uh definition and and as we
[51:55] look at that I just want to uh put a
[51:57] little more scripture and thought into
[51:59] here uh to understand or lay it out that
[52:02] you see some people well mostly critics
[52:05] amen I don't think a real believer is
[52:07] going to have a problem with this but
[52:08] they say you know that's misquoted
[52:10] that's not really got the right
[52:11] foundation how he's presenting that but
[52:14] I'm telling you my brother and sister
[52:15] this might to them sound crazy but I'm
[52:18] sold out far enough to look Beyond
[52:20] Webster to the word and God sent the
[52:24] word in our hour to be clarified and
[52:26] Webster's good they've collected
[52:28] everybody's opinion on what what means
[52:30] what but I tell you what when you have a
[52:32] Divine interpretation of the word of God
[52:35] then we can rest upon that and so you
[52:37] know we look at this and James 4:17 says
[52:41] therefore to him that knoweth to do good
[52:44] and doeth it not to him it is sin very
[52:47] straightforward we don't have to try to
[52:50] interpret that amen but you know the
[52:53] prophet of God put it to us as uh and
[52:56] these are my words as to knowing to do
[52:59] right and not doing it so my brother and
[53:02] sister one might be in sin and not know
[53:05] that he's in sin and therefore it would
[53:08] be hard in sense to say that you have
[53:11] iniquity because there's no knowledge of
[53:14] the right and the wrong you know as it
[53:16] was in the mission field many years ago
[53:18] there were people that was the
[53:20] missionaries went to I remember reading
[53:22] in Papa New Guinea these people had no
[53:25] no clue of words like up and down and
[53:27] right and left and right and wrong they
[53:30] had no clue of that but they had a very
[53:32] strong moral fiber in their tribes and
[53:35] there were certain things you just
[53:37] didn't do no one had to explain why you
[53:40] don't do that you just don't do it and
[53:43] so we recognize my brother and sister
[53:46] that the uh Sadducees and Pharisees uh
[53:49] had the word but they tossed the word
[53:52] for their tradition they tossed the word
[53:54] for their ideology and added as it were
[53:58] history shows us that when a
[53:59] circumstance would arise they would
[54:01] simply add another chapter to their
[54:04] books of how to deal with that and that
[54:07] then become the law and they claimed
[54:09] that that was attached directly back to
[54:11] Moses they claimed that this really was
[54:13] just an extension of Moses's words but
[54:17] my brother and sister man had his hand
[54:19] in there so strongly that after a season
[54:23] after Generations people didn't know
[54:26] because let's face it Saints I hope this
[54:28] doesn't apply to
[54:30] us there's such a strong Spirit on the
[54:38] land I don't know whether take this as
[54:40] an example or
[54:44] not people know all the teams that play
[54:47] hockey or football or basketball they
[54:50] know the names of the
[54:52] greats they don't know who brought the
[54:54] word
[54:56] yeah it's a matter of priorities it's a
[54:59] matter of what the focus is and you know
[55:02] we won't go into this because it gets
[55:04] quite lengthy and drawn out but my
[55:05] brother and sister words believe it or
[55:07] not affect
[55:08] everything amen who we actually speak of
[55:13] oursel how we actually speak of
[55:15] ourself is is a major foreteller of how
[55:19] we actually view ourselves in the eyes
[55:21] of God and so it's there that we
[55:24] recognize is that a man that knoweth to
[55:26] do good and doesn't do it to him it is
[55:29] sin and brother brandham brings it down
[55:31] to us that if you you know to do
[55:34] something and you are not doing it it is
[55:37] Iniquity to you and the word is very
[55:39] clear that iniquity is sin and so it's
[55:42] there that as we won't get to all of it
[55:44] today we see how that as they're
[55:46] speaking to Jesus and he speaks to them
[55:49] very strongly and he tells them depart
[55:52] from me you workers of iniquity now
[55:55] these were people that come and said you
[55:57] know what we've done many mighty works
[55:59] in your name but they missed a key
[56:01] element and we could preach on that
[56:04] today and and draw a lengthy deal but it
[56:06] wasn't really what was on my heart amen
[56:09] but I want to just also to 1 Corinthians
[56:11] 10 and 21 it shows us that we cannot be
[56:15] caught between two opinions we cannot be
[56:18] caught between our ideas and and someone
[56:20] else's ideas or or what they think of us
[56:24] my brother and sister
[56:25] it's a it's an interesting thing we live
[56:27] in the world uh you hear testimonies of
[56:30] such of of neighbors very critical to
[56:33] Believers uh their children making fun
[56:36] of of uh believer's children about uh
[56:39] old doy oldfashioned you know you look
[56:41] like you come out of another Century but
[56:43] when their child is sick and laying on a
[56:46] deathbed whose door do they knock
[56:49] on acknowledging we haven't even called
[56:52] our pastor we have not even called our
[56:54] church because we see God in you amen my
[56:59] brother and sister this is the god that
[57:00] we serve now First Corinthians 10:21
[57:04] says you cannot drink of the cup of the
[57:05] Lord and the cup of devils you cannot be
[57:08] partakers of the Lord's table and of the
[57:11] table of devils so a very clear line
[57:16] dividing amen don't you like things
[57:18] clear-cut I like things when they are
[57:21] just you know uh just dividing you know
[57:24] down in the in the in the supply room we
[57:26] have that paper cutter and I was just
[57:29] one day doing some stuff and the blade
[57:31] was raised up and I brush my Knuckles
[57:33] over it and then I look down it's like
[57:35] where did the blood on that page come
[57:36] from I never even felt it my brother and
[57:39] sister I want the word to be that sharp
[57:41] in my life I want the word to come and
[57:44] just rightly divide my life I don't want
[57:47] to be one who is sitting here with
[57:49] iniquity thinking I'm making
[57:52] it amen but look look how it is God Has
[57:56] Come aren't you glad we can today make
[57:58] the profession or the claim that we have
[58:02] a restored word amen amen we're not
[58:04] looking now backwards it's good there's
[58:06] nothing wrong with looking back but my
[58:08] brother and sister the fullness of the
[58:10] manifestation of the mystery of Jesus
[58:13] Christ was not fulfilled a thousand
[58:16] years ago it was fulfilled and revealed
[58:19] today and so we are standing in the
[58:21] greatest of times in and the most
[58:23] beautiful of times to be standing not
[58:26] looking back I remember one time a
[58:28] brother he's kind of a western guy he
[58:30] said oh if I could just go into the old
[58:32] west and I just couldn't help myself
[58:34] brother I said you don't want to do that
[58:36] with that nice wavy hair of yours
[58:38] hanging on the pole in a teepee
[58:41] somewhere and he was like brother Paul
[58:43] that was kind not kind but you see we're
[58:46] not called to go back there we can't
[58:48] live out a fantasy of I wanted to be a
[58:50] cowboy or I wanted to be this or I
[58:52] wanted to be that God called us to this
[58:54] this hour and he's brought a restored
[58:57] word everything put back in place to
[59:00] take us to our real home amen now we can
[59:04] I I'll tell you what you know they're
[59:05] building them out in our country out
[59:07] there uh uh you know nice
[59:10] homes nice homes beautiful homes brother
[59:14] Ivan and sister nauy are building a
[59:15] beautiful home but you see there's a
[59:18] difference they are looking at that as
[59:22] their
[59:23] future but this house we are building is
[59:26] our
[59:27] future amen praise God those of you
[59:30] blessed to be able to do that amen it's
[59:34] wonderful but praise God that this world
[59:38] is not our home amen that whatever we
[59:41] have here we say thank you Lord for and
[59:44] we're willing to walk away from it in a
[59:46] heartbeat
[59:48] hallelujah amen cuz this word come to
[59:50] turn our hearts back and I guess I'm
[59:53] just feeling this way this morning
[59:54] morning if you don't mind is a heart's
[59:56] turn back Hallelujah not turn back to
[59:59] Egypt amen I'll tell you I just can't
[1:00:03] even imagine now I know scripturally if
[1:00:04] you don't mind a little humor I I'm kind
[1:00:06] of a finicky eater I can't imagine
[1:00:08] anybody that would like garlic and
[1:00:11] leaks I'm serious I mean what what are
[1:00:13] they thinking sister Jerry fried some
[1:00:16] brussels sprouts put them on my plate
[1:00:18] it's like this goes with your lunch you
[1:00:21] know she's got me so buffaloed saints
[1:00:24] that I actually ate a few of them and
[1:00:26] then I finally was like that tastes like
[1:00:29] dirt and I'm not in the mood to eat
[1:00:32] dirt but my brother and sister people
[1:00:34] constantly drawn back oh that tasted so
[1:00:38] good I remember when I was drunk in the
[1:00:40] alley I remember when I was this and
[1:00:42] smelled like well I won't go into all
[1:00:44] those descriptions and they they they
[1:00:47] almost talk with a
[1:00:49] fness but this world's not our home I'm
[1:00:52] so glad a restored word come and and it
[1:00:54] might be painful but God's pulling you
[1:00:56] root by root out of Le oysa he's pulling
[1:00:59] them up Saints and I think I know you
[1:01:01] well enough that I can say amen for you
[1:01:04] it's not always comfortable when God
[1:01:06] takes a hold of something and pulls a
[1:01:08] root out of Le oysa he pulls us loose
[1:01:11] but yet there's a liberty to come amen
[1:01:15] there's something there that's so
[1:01:16] incredible our hearts are being turned
[1:01:20] back yes sir we're feeling a pull we're
[1:01:23] we're hearing a call
[1:01:26] you know I hear my fony that's right oh
[1:01:30] it's calling me somewhere beyond the
[1:01:36] veil not just wooing us to church that's
[1:01:39] right God doesn't have attendance record
[1:01:41] of wooing you to church he has an
[1:01:42] attendance record of wooing you home
[1:01:45] back into his presence amen hallelujah I
[1:01:49] say it's momentum momentous it's
[1:01:51] incredible blessing to be
[1:01:53] chosen and I mean I don't even know how
[1:01:55] to put it in words but I just remember
[1:01:57] as a little boy I was pretty good at
[1:01:58] baseball uh played some of it and did
[1:02:01] different things up into high school a
[1:02:03] little bit and and you know uh you're
[1:02:06] out there and just a a a game you know
[1:02:09] not official game just a game and you're
[1:02:11] standing there with all these kids and
[1:02:14] their twos and
[1:02:15] teams it's a
[1:02:18] heartbreak to be the one still standing
[1:02:21] there when they go to
[1:02:23] play
[1:02:26] and sometimes they just chose because of
[1:02:28] favoritism of friendships and whatever
[1:02:30] because maybe you're
[1:02:33] there why did they choose that
[1:02:37] boy and you watch the game and he
[1:02:39] strikes out every time he gets to the
[1:02:40] plate and the ball comes to him and he's
[1:02:43] like and the
[1:02:46] ball and you're
[1:02:48] like why didn't they choose
[1:02:51] me I want you to pull that into a
[1:02:53] spiritual Realm
[1:02:57] we are sitting here not of our
[1:02:59] abilities not how good we are at
[1:03:01] anything in this life but God says you
[1:03:05] know what you might not be the best
[1:03:08] outward Christian in the church but I
[1:03:11] chose you and because I chose you you
[1:03:15] will live and fulfill and manifest and
[1:03:18] overcome and you will lift a voice and
[1:03:21] praise me you'll call to the heavens my
[1:03:23] name and glorify it and we're over here
[1:03:26] saying but I am a poor Christian it
[1:03:29] doesn't matter you were chosen that's
[1:03:31] right it didn't matter how good the man
[1:03:33] on the bench was if he wasn't chosen
[1:03:36] he's not playing and God has come and
[1:03:40] chose you and I has made it possible I
[1:03:42] say it's an incredible blessing to be
[1:03:45] chosen to be found in his
[1:03:48] righteousness amen but look at this
[1:03:50] unless we would boast of ourselves right
[1:03:52] the Apostle Paul lays that out very
[1:03:54] clearly L we would boast of ourselves
[1:03:57] God let your flesh get in your way so
[1:04:00] you can't boast amen cuz I'll just tell
[1:04:04] you what just as humble as I
[1:04:09] am my daddy raised me when people say oh
[1:04:12] I'm so humble my daddy's like don't
[1:04:15] believe
[1:04:15] them humble people don't have to tell
[1:04:18] you they're humble humble people are
[1:04:20] just humble so in my humble of
[1:04:27] opinion
[1:04:29] yes could I bid half a cent for my
[1:04:31] opinion can we get a half a cent four10
[1:04:35] 310 two10 okay I'll just give it to you
[1:04:38] for free amen look at this my brother
[1:04:42] and
[1:04:43] sister it's not our righteousness right
[1:04:48] so when the scripture deals with this
[1:04:51] cup of righteousness deals with this
[1:04:54] righteousness we realize what's being
[1:04:56] filled into that cup is not us amen no
[1:05:02] place for us to stand and say you know
[1:05:04] I've been such a good Christian for x
[1:05:06] amount of
[1:05:10] years that's
[1:05:13] right but there's a washing taking place
[1:05:16] Hallelujah Can someone say Amen there's
[1:05:19] a washing We Believe most of us here I
[1:05:21] believe in the building have believed
[1:05:23] the message for years and we got young
[1:05:25] people coming up and they're and then
[1:05:27] they're they're grasping that with their
[1:05:29] hearts and my brother and sister that's
[1:05:31] so wonderful but you see my brother and
[1:05:33] sister it's all about the washing amen
[1:05:36] you know I I I just you know well my
[1:05:39] mind goes to a lot of examples I've
[1:05:41] known some very interesting people in my
[1:05:43] life and one was a Rancher out here in
[1:05:46] the awai he's uh he was worth literally
[1:05:49] tens of millions of dollars and he would
[1:05:51] wear his his pants
[1:05:54] he wore Levis and he would wear them
[1:05:56] until they were so crusty that they
[1:05:58] literally could stand up in the corner
[1:06:00] by
[1:06:01] themselves and when he passed away and
[1:06:03] his family come one of his daughters
[1:06:05] which we know come and they were taking
[1:06:08] care of things in his house they found
[1:06:10] something on the order of 4550 brand new
[1:06:13] pair of Levis in the house because
[1:06:16] through the years the daughters and
[1:06:17] grandchildren and Friends it be like he
[1:06:20] must surely not be able to afford a a
[1:06:22] pair of pants to wear those but what he
[1:06:25] would do he would wear those until they
[1:06:27] could almost walk by themselves and at
[1:06:29] the day he declared them he didn't go
[1:06:31] wash them he threw them away and started
[1:06:34] wearing another
[1:06:37] pair there might be some issues
[1:06:42] there one time one of his grandchildren
[1:06:44] said
[1:06:46] Grandpa do you ever take a
[1:06:49] bath and he said what are you talking
[1:06:51] about boy I took one this year
[1:06:57] year but here's the bride of
[1:07:00] Christ every
[1:07:02] day Wash Me Lord amen Wash Me Lord amen
[1:07:07] cleanse me Lord that I might be wider
[1:07:10] than snow cleanse me Lord my heart is
[1:07:13] crying out cleanse
[1:07:15] me do we approach God because we're
[1:07:18] afraid of missing the
[1:07:20] Rapture no sir because we know we were
[1:07:24] called to be like him and we desire to
[1:07:29] be like him because we are part of him
[1:07:33] and so there's something in us that
[1:07:36] recognizes here's our cleansing here is
[1:07:39] the washing here's what I long for this
[1:07:42] is what I need amen and I tell you what
[1:07:45] we got to do Saints and we got to just
[1:07:47] stand
[1:07:48] still I just reading in the message the
[1:07:50] other day and brother Bram says you know
[1:07:52] God can't use flighty people
[1:07:55] Lord anchor my feet in the word don't
[1:07:58] let me be flighty if the preaching of
[1:08:00] the word hurts anchor me and let me take
[1:08:03] it
[1:08:05] Lord don't let me be
[1:08:09] flighty you see some religions they have
[1:08:12] prescribed
[1:08:13] methods there's part of the reasons the
[1:08:15] methodists have the name Methodist is
[1:08:19] because they had a method for
[1:08:22] everything
[1:08:27] my I come across a very interesting
[1:08:31] quotation amen oh let me
[1:08:35] say we have a prescribed
[1:08:39] method so they're not out of line in
[1:08:41] their thoughts we have a prescribed
[1:08:43] method so does that leave us equal to
[1:08:46] the
[1:08:49] methodists
[1:08:52] no yes
[1:08:58] not a method of man's
[1:09:00] thinking but a method of the word amen
[1:09:04] there's where the difference comes so
[1:09:06] religion give prescribed methods right
[1:09:08] now we know religion says you know what
[1:09:11] what you do you sin and you need to come
[1:09:13] and uh we're not going to serve you Holy
[1:09:15] Communion unless you've come to conf
[1:09:17] confession and so they set a time for
[1:09:20] confession and and those of you that
[1:09:22] have come out of that
[1:09:24] how that is and uh I had a friend um he
[1:09:27] was a man I worked on a ranch with many
[1:09:29] years ago and and he was like I got I
[1:09:32] got to leave early tonight can you
[1:09:33] finish my my work with these cattle Paul
[1:09:36] because I I got to go to confession
[1:09:38] tonight and I said well it's Friday and
[1:09:40] he goes I know if I go to Friday night
[1:09:42] confession I can sin all weekend and
[1:09:44] I've got till next Friday to make it
[1:09:47] right now did he come up with that on
[1:09:49] his
[1:09:51] own no it was something a foundation
[1:09:54] that was
[1:09:55] laid and so it was there that we see my
[1:09:58] brother and sister how that they are
[1:10:00] then brought because there is a contrast
[1:10:02] between these
[1:10:04] Natures there's a strong contrast
[1:10:07] between these natures and so it's h you
[1:10:09] know I have a prescribed time the priest
[1:10:11] knows I'm faithful about being there
[1:10:13] I'll be there and he knows I'm coming
[1:10:16] amen so you come to confession at this
[1:10:18] time and he was also taught that
[1:10:21] salvation was in the church so if he
[1:10:23] made the church happy he was
[1:10:29] saved I just want to tell you I I
[1:10:32] enjoyed brother David's sermon Wednesday
[1:10:35] night how high are we going to set the
[1:10:37] standard
[1:10:39] saints come on if the church is going to
[1:10:42] be the answer I'm going to tell you I've
[1:10:44] got the standard way up here I haven't
[1:10:46] reached it myself yet but I'm working
[1:10:49] towards reaching
[1:10:50] it would that give us any encouragement
[1:10:54] to know that the man preaching to you
[1:10:56] every service doesn't see you as an
[1:10:59] overcomer he sees you as a a
[1:11:02] Trier or a
[1:11:05] failure no my brother and sister so
[1:11:08] God's got this he he he's giving us this
[1:11:11] uh there and and if you teach that
[1:11:13] salvation's in the church or maybe it's
[1:11:15] a church movement that's how we describe
[1:11:17] it around the message if if you're
[1:11:19] believing like we believe everything
[1:11:21] will be okay even if you're sinning
[1:11:23] you're going to be okay cuz you believe
[1:11:24] like we believe my brother and sister
[1:11:26] that's nonsense that's a denominational
[1:11:28] divisive Spirit that's just trying to
[1:11:30] separate you from the word amen because
[1:11:33] if he can get you out of the word then
[1:11:35] he's got you amen now I want you I know
[1:11:39] you guys will probably think man what is
[1:11:40] Paul studying where's his brain been I
[1:11:43] want to read you a quotation from Joseph
[1:11:47] Smith y'all know who he is don't
[1:11:50] you no he is not the guy that lives down
[1:11:53] here on Smith
[1:11:55] Avenue quotation from Joseph
[1:11:58] Smith repentance is a thing that cannot
[1:12:02] be trifled with every day daily
[1:12:06] transgressions and daily repentance is
[1:12:09] not that which is pleasing in the sight
[1:12:11] of
[1:12:12] God did you
[1:12:16] comprehend maybe I should have had the
[1:12:18] brothers put it on the screen let me
[1:12:20] read it
[1:12:21] again repentance
[1:12:24] is not a thing that cannot be trifled
[1:12:27] with every day in other words we can't
[1:12:30] mess with this every
[1:12:35] day repentance is not something you can
[1:12:38] deal with every
[1:12:40] day daily transgressions do we have any
[1:12:43] of those my Prophet said I backslide
[1:12:46] daily I said amen when I heard it amen
[1:12:50] and daily repentance is not that which
[1:12:54] is pleasing in the sight of God so your
[1:12:58] daily transgression and your repentance
[1:13:00] of it does not please God so if I read
[1:13:04] that in correct context I flunked
[1:13:06] English almost every year I took it so
[1:13:08] but in the right context so you can
[1:13:11] transgress he's saying that your
[1:13:13] repentance Daily doesn't please
[1:13:18] God is that not
[1:13:20] interesting because the prophet of God
[1:13:23] told us we backslide daily and then he
[1:13:28] taught us soon as the Holy Spirit brings
[1:13:31] that to your attention lays that on your
[1:13:35] spirit brings it to your mind you repent
[1:13:39] and make it
[1:13:42] right now look where religion's going in
[1:13:44] this world my brother and sister what
[1:13:46] they're doing is allowing a people to be
[1:13:49] justified of their cup filling up
[1:13:53] are you with me their cup is filling up
[1:13:56] and they're being encouraged let the cup
[1:13:59] be filled up that's not the Holy Spirit
[1:14:03] that's another
[1:14:06] spirit and so you see this now and what
[1:14:09] is this I I I really struggled in in
[1:14:12] kind of putting this together in in the
[1:14:14] sense of there's such a vast information
[1:14:17] but let me put it this way my brother
[1:14:19] and sister I I almost titled this the
[1:14:21] tale of two cups
[1:14:24] and you see right here that this world
[1:14:26] that we're living in this cup of
[1:14:28] iniquity the scripture says when it gets
[1:14:31] completely full then God is coming to
[1:14:34] judge the world and so it's there that
[1:14:37] we recognize if Satan is filling a cup
[1:14:41] then God's got a cup also that he is
[1:14:44] filling amen and so it hear when the cup
[1:14:48] of iniquity in other words a vast
[1:14:51] multitude of record Ed events in our
[1:14:55] lives that did not please God not
[1:14:58] according to Joseph Smith's pleasing but
[1:15:00] truly pleasing God and so it's there
[1:15:03] that you would look at that but I'm
[1:15:05] telling you oh Hallelujah I get excited
[1:15:07] this is farther down but I can say it
[1:15:09] two or three times it'll still be as
[1:15:11] good amen we'll still say Amen to it
[1:15:13] even if we hear it a few times my
[1:15:15] brother and sister my cup of iniquity
[1:15:17] was filling up and then God got a hold
[1:15:20] of me and started speaking to me started
[1:15:22] speaking to you and he started pouring
[1:15:24] in righteousness and when righteousness
[1:15:26] went in my brother and sister iniquity
[1:15:29] couldn't stay in the cup and iniquity
[1:15:31] started leaving the cup and
[1:15:33] righteousness started filling the cup
[1:15:35] but the only thing that will push
[1:15:37] iniquity out of our cup is righteousness
[1:15:40] is the Holy Ghost is relationship with
[1:15:42] Jesus Christ and so if the
[1:15:45] culture that's anointed my brother and
[1:15:48] sister they are there oh it's all right
[1:15:51] it's all right God under understands he
[1:15:54] does he understands you don't care about
[1:15:56] your cup he understands that you are
[1:16:00] have a you're a
[1:16:03] religionist hopefully I'm not preaching
[1:16:05] too
[1:16:06] straightened but look at this my brother
[1:16:08] and sister so an encouragement Saints
[1:16:12] just do whatever you want in business in
[1:16:15] relationships every just do what you
[1:16:17] want God
[1:16:21] understands David
[1:16:23] said my cup runneth
[1:16:28] over he was not talking about a cup of
[1:16:31] iniquity he was talking oh oh he'd had
[1:16:34] iniquity I was just reading a little
[1:16:36] history about be Sheba amen now I don't
[1:16:39] know why I was reading history about BBA
[1:16:41] but I was reading history about BBA and
[1:16:43] you know I didn't realize it was such a
[1:16:45] controversial we're not worried about
[1:16:47] getting you in the Rapture we're worried
[1:16:49] about what Beba did was intentional or
[1:16:52] not
[1:16:56] and we're worried
[1:16:57] about did
[1:17:00] David dismiss all of his servants so no
[1:17:02] one could see him
[1:17:05] sin and we're worried about where was
[1:17:08] Bas made was she complient to this would
[1:17:13] she be judged
[1:17:17] also and
[1:17:18] we're digging through
[1:17:22] things it's called
[1:17:25] religion it's not the word oh it's the
[1:17:27] word but it's not the word it's not the
[1:17:31] word that saves souls and delivers
[1:17:33] mankind it's
[1:17:34] theology it's man's idea of what's
[1:17:40] important oh I I think knowledge is good
[1:17:43] be honest with you knowledge versus
[1:17:45] ignorance is good I want to know the
[1:17:49] Lord I want to understand him I want to
[1:17:51] see him I want to know his voice voice
[1:17:54] you know one of the things that we miss
[1:17:55] is God's present we believe he's here
[1:17:57] today some people walk out of church
[1:18:00] maybe today and say I don't know what he
[1:18:01] was even talking about my brother and
[1:18:03] sister you got to have an ear to hear
[1:18:05] amen we can't just go and automatically
[1:18:07] walk out blessed it's not like we're
[1:18:09] giving candy at the door you know just
[1:18:11] reading about where brother Brown was
[1:18:12] talking about Christmas now Saints if
[1:18:15] we're going to do it the way brother
[1:18:16] Brown did the kids exp an orange at
[1:18:19] Christmas
[1:18:21] time yeah they think that's what church
[1:18:24] is about they think it's about all this
[1:18:27] little
[1:18:28] stuff it's about the
[1:18:30] word amen this is God's place he chose
[1:18:33] to put it it doesn't limit it to here
[1:18:35] but this was God's choosing he said not
[1:18:38] to forsake yourself and so we come and
[1:18:41] what do we do when we're in church we
[1:18:42] should be eating on the word amen and
[1:18:44] what is the word amen it is the very
[1:18:48] spiritual nutrition that gives you
[1:18:50] strength enough to Face Tomorrow gives
[1:18:52] you strength enough to face your problem
[1:18:54] face your children face your husband
[1:18:57] face your wife face your boss face
[1:18:59] everything that might give trouble to
[1:19:04] you what are you trying to say brother
[1:19:06] Paul yeah yeah know every man that ever
[1:19:09] got married has wife
[1:19:11] trouble and every wife that ever got
[1:19:13] married has husband trouble Man

[1:19:33] relationship with the Lord it can be
[1:19:34] better have a good relationship with my
[1:19:36] brothers and sisters in the church it
[1:19:37] can be better amen let's not settle
[1:19:40] let's not decide we've reached a plateau
[1:19:42] we don't need to go no further we've got
[1:19:44] it we've got the message we've got it no
[1:19:46] my brother and sister I want to rise up
[1:19:47] into Heavenly places amen that's not
[1:19:50] some miraculous thing of God jerking you
[1:19:52] out of your attitude and your situation
[1:19:54] and putting you up here God's going to
[1:19:56] make you climb them steps God's going to
[1:19:58] make you walk up that mountain he's
[1:20:00] going to make you walk through the
[1:20:01] valley of the
[1:20:02] bitter and in the end you rise up and be
[1:20:05] able to say praise God God gave me the
[1:20:08] perfect wife give me the perfect husband
[1:20:10] oh come on Saints don't just don't fall
[1:20:12] down on me here gave me the perfect
[1:20:16] children but they're not serving God
[1:20:19] they're still God's chosen gift to
[1:20:21] you
[1:20:24] boy I could really be humble this
[1:20:25] morning and say God gave you the perfect
[1:20:29] pastor but that might be going just a
[1:20:32] little bit too
[1:20:37] far really like Joseph Smith's
[1:20:41] Outlook we don't have time to be worried
[1:20:44] about our little lives and our little
[1:20:48] arguments in our temper tantrums and our
[1:20:51] thises and thats and
[1:20:54] I mean look Saints I hope you don't mind
[1:20:57] I don't get too sidetracked here when I
[1:20:59] was a kid my sister would know all about
[1:21:02] this little town of green leaf had one
[1:21:04] of them little Old Country Stores pot
[1:21:06] belly stove in the middle old wor out
[1:21:09] drooping porch on the outside everybody
[1:21:13] in the country knew everybody in the
[1:21:14] country's business kind of like
[1:21:17] church and
[1:21:19] um as a kid we'd go in there and
[1:21:23] you know it'd be not necessarily winter
[1:21:26] time but we'd go in there and the candy
[1:21:27] iow was backways from the checkout and
[1:21:30] kids don't you take this for an example
[1:21:32] your parents don't spank you I will but
[1:21:35] we'd go back there and I just shovel
[1:21:38] some candy in that coat
[1:21:41] pocket we were so
[1:21:43] clever oh look at us nice
[1:21:50] ceiling God dealt with our heart we go
[1:21:52] back to deal with the Robertson family
[1:21:54] we stole from
[1:21:57] you yeah you never fooled
[1:22:01] us H
[1:22:03] really you never called the police no we
[1:22:07] prayed for you that's it and here you
[1:22:10] are today coming to confess your
[1:22:14] shortcoming our prayers have been
[1:22:17] answered that's right oh God help us not
[1:22:20] to judge one another his people free
[1:22:26] methodists amen that looked at it and
[1:22:29] said all these kids need all this family
[1:22:31] needs all that husband needs all those
[1:22:33] children Need Is Christ there's our
[1:22:36] answer there's what will solve this
[1:22:38] problem this is what will change it what
[1:22:41] is it my brother and sister it is the
[1:22:43] contrast of two natures and when we
[1:22:46] recognize we're not dealing with an
[1:22:48] individual brother Brown didn't say now
[1:22:50] that person is a devil he tells us he
[1:22:52] shows us that person has a spirit on
[1:22:56] them and so you can love the person
[1:22:58] without loving the spirit that we as
[1:23:00] humans often times quit loving the
[1:23:03] person
[1:23:07] right yeah now look this is contrasted
[1:23:12] as I said with the prophet telling us to
[1:23:14] repent amen every single day and look I
[1:23:18] think the prophet May base that on the
[1:23:20] Apostle Paul that said I Die daily amen
[1:23:23] Apostle Paul didn't say I wait once a
[1:23:24] month or when it's convenient he said I
[1:23:27] Die daily oh let me just be like the
[1:23:30] Apostle Paul Amen in the message look
[1:23:34] brother Brandon preaches this says this
[1:23:36] we're at the end time friends can we say
[1:23:38] Amen I'm looking for Jesus to come that
[1:23:40] blessed Lord Jesus who I loved and has
[1:23:43] give my life to as a young man I'm still
[1:23:45] looking for him to come I believe he
[1:23:48] will though like Abraham it may
[1:23:51] linger oh my I just listening to the
[1:23:53] prophet the other day and he was like we
[1:23:56] are looking the coming of the Lord is
[1:23:59] going to be any day
[1:24:06] now oh wait I can figure that out 61
[1:24:10] that's how old I'm that's 61 years
[1:24:13] ago any
[1:24:17] day if you're hanging on with a blind
[1:24:19] hope just hang on long enough oh
[1:24:22] if I can just hang on long enough if I
[1:24:24] can hang on long enough I'll make the
[1:24:25] Rapture no you
[1:24:27] won't no you won't cuz you got all the
[1:24:31] wrong reasons that you're pursuing this
[1:24:34] all the wrong reasons give up die just
[1:24:37] die God will take care of it he's the
[1:24:40] promise we're not the promise he's the
[1:24:42] promise he chose to fulfill the promise
[1:24:45] in us so we now become the manifestation
[1:24:48] of the promise in other words I'll put
[1:24:50] it this way when he promised that he
[1:24:52] would be in you he was guaranteeing that
[1:24:55] deity would be residing in you so you
[1:24:58] are here filled with
[1:25:01] deity but I don't live like deity no
[1:25:04] God's got that covered you just keep
[1:25:06] following him you walk with him you talk
[1:25:10] with him and you keep your life
[1:25:15] clean I'll tell you nothing worse than
[1:25:17] being in a house with a bunch of
[1:25:19] Bachelors I hung out with some guys
[1:25:21] Colorado many years ago we never visited
[1:25:24] a laundry mat until we were down to our
[1:25:26] last pair of socks and now Walmart
[1:25:29] wasn't around back in them days but
[1:25:31] Kmart was and there's a whole bunch of
[1:25:33] young men that were guilty of I don't
[1:25:35] want to do laundry it's easier now I
[1:25:38] wasn't serving the lord it's easier on
[1:25:40] the way to the movie stop by Kmart buy
[1:25:42] more
[1:25:43] socks pry soon you own 40 pairs of
[1:25:47] socks my brother and sister if we apply
[1:25:51] that spiritually
[1:25:53] look at how
[1:25:55] stinky we
[1:25:57] get come on I know this is church and I
[1:26:01] know we're dignified people but do you
[1:26:03] know what a man smells like after he has
[1:26:06] worked
[1:26:08] hard yeah we won't go
[1:26:11] there that's what our Dirty
[1:26:14] Laundry smells like
[1:26:17] right not
[1:26:19] good amen though like Abraham it may
[1:26:22] linger yet I get stronger and more in
[1:26:25] love with him expressing myself that's
[1:26:29] right not just when I come to church on
[1:26:32] Sunday special meetings come on let's
[1:26:34] just settle for special meetings then
[1:26:36] then we can just pour it all out and
[1:26:38] jump and shout and scream and tear
[1:26:39] around no no no he says I express myself
[1:26:43] daily to him I know every believer in
[1:26:46] here does the same thing now I want to
[1:26:50] put emphasis on the prophet of God
[1:26:51] saying every believer here does the same
[1:26:55] thing he doesn't say every believer
[1:26:57] might hold the same
[1:26:58] opinion every believer thinks that's
[1:27:01] probably what we ought to he says they
[1:27:03] do the same
[1:27:06] thing
[1:27:10] Hallelujah you know there's so much to
[1:27:12] be spoken of about iniquity maybe we'll
[1:27:15] come back in Future services but you see
[1:27:17] my brother and sister it really comes
[1:27:20] down I like things in
[1:27:23] Simplicity I I love things in Simplicity
[1:27:26] brother Isaac was helping me on a little
[1:27:28] problem I had and and there is a wiring
[1:27:32] diagram and
[1:27:35] um me and wiring diagrams don't speak
[1:27:37] the same
[1:27:40] language brother Isaac's just like going
[1:27:42] okay this goes here and this goes over
[1:27:44] to this switch and this comes down here
[1:27:45] to this little thing and comes back
[1:27:47] around here and comes up ties into this
[1:27:49] and and at the U-turn over here I was
[1:27:52] like like just tell me where we're
[1:27:55] going that's all I need to know tell me
[1:27:58] where I'm going cuz I'll tell you what
[1:28:00] Saints I've been preaching a little bit
[1:28:01] on Wednesday nights about
[1:28:04] Vision I don't want to know where you
[1:28:06] came
[1:28:08] from I want to see where you're
[1:28:10] going and if you see where you're going
[1:28:13] you won't care where you came from but
[1:28:16] when you lose your vision you'll start
[1:28:19] saying now okay I'm not sure where I'm
[1:28:21] going maybe I need to go back to where I
[1:28:23] came from to figure out where I'm going
[1:28:25] and Satan draws you in a giant U-turn
[1:28:28] and many people have found themselves
[1:28:30] right back sitting on a bar stool and
[1:28:32] wondering how they got there amen
[1:28:35] because their Vision got clouded and
[1:28:38] they started looking back my brother and
[1:28:40] sister they didn't leave Egypt to turn
[1:28:42] around and go back they were having a
[1:28:45] jubile they were having a Revival they
[1:28:48] were shouting they were screaming but
[1:28:51] somewhere along along the way maybe a
[1:28:54] few thousands or tens of thousands of
[1:28:56] steps into the
[1:28:59] journey they remembered about
[1:29:04] that perfect mattress they had back
[1:29:08] there my feather pillow my mattress my
[1:29:11] reading
[1:29:12] light I put my eight hours in at the
[1:29:15] factory I go
[1:29:17] home I let the priest pray for
[1:29:20] deliverance
[1:29:23] come on leoda is an extension of Egypt
[1:29:27] it's the same spirit and if you're not
[1:29:30] careful you go out there and you do a
[1:29:31] U-turn and you look back and you
[1:29:34] remember our church had good
[1:29:37] meetings we were good people we didn't
[1:29:41] sin but you didn't have
[1:29:44] Revelation see Satan diminishes
[1:29:49] Revelation okay I I'm just falling off
[1:29:51] the track track here but you see in
[1:29:55] iniquity my brother and sister there's a
[1:29:58] spiritual motivated and the spiritually
[1:30:03] unmotivated now I want to ask you the
[1:30:06] last time I trust that someone here
[1:30:08] would be able to identify but the last
[1:30:10] time you walked up to somebody and said
[1:30:14] forgive
[1:30:17] me that didn't come
[1:30:20] natural you had to be
[1:30:23] determined to set the
[1:30:27] misunderstanding
[1:30:29] right determined I don't care if we're
[1:30:31] talking about husbands and wives or
[1:30:33] parents and children or you know
[1:30:35] whatever it might be the body of
[1:30:37] Believers but you see a spiritually
[1:30:39] motivated man or woman is the one when
[1:30:43] the prophet said read they read pray
[1:30:46] they pray repent they repent why because
[1:30:49] they're motivated now we all go go
[1:30:51] through moments of motivation right here
[1:30:54] a while back you know I dug out some
[1:30:56] barbells and I thought you know it's a
[1:30:58] little it's a little you know whatever
[1:31:00] but I I can go out here in the shed and
[1:31:02] I could lift a few weights and and um
[1:31:06] and I um thought about it some more and
[1:31:11] um I thought about it the next day and
[1:31:14] um then it was too close to the weekend
[1:31:17] I need to study for church so you guys
[1:31:18] were the reason I didn't go lift them
[1:31:20] then and
[1:31:22] you see if you're
[1:31:24] unmotivated it doesn't matter what
[1:31:27] excuse we
[1:31:29] use the contrast but when the Rapture is
[1:31:33] in plain view do we believe the Rapture
[1:31:36] is in plain view hallelu that's what
[1:31:38] this message is about the Rapture coming
[1:31:40] into Plain View and when the Rapture is
[1:31:42] in plain view and we're looking at this
[1:31:44] we start to recognize you know what I
[1:31:46] can do this by God's grace I can
[1:31:49] literally get out of bed in the morning
[1:31:51] and I can say Lord here am I here am I
[1:31:55] Lord but the unmotivated always says
[1:31:57] maybe tomorrow I'll start tomorrow
[1:31:59] remember you know that's the same thing
[1:32:00] why diets are what they are is because
[1:32:03] we're always starting
[1:32:05] tomorrow and that's what the spiritual
[1:32:07] world is it's always about I'm starting
[1:32:09] tomorrow what is that if you know you
[1:32:12] should start today and you don't
[1:32:15] start it's a proc
[1:32:18] procrastinating blond we have some blond
[1:32:20] hair blue eyes I shouldn't say it that
[1:32:25] way forgive me I'm going to say it
[1:32:27] anyway we have some blond-haired
[1:32:31] blue-eyed procrastinating Devils
[1:32:33] anointing us and the reason I use that
[1:32:36] is because usually people associate
[1:32:38] blonde hair and blue eyes to being
[1:32:40] attractive so we've got these attractive
[1:32:43] demons they don't come my brother and
[1:32:45] sister they don't come with big snaggly
[1:32:47] teeth and fangs and Claws they come
[1:32:51] attractive
[1:32:53] I have a
[1:32:55] reason now those of you are blonde hair
[1:32:57] and blue I know who you are so I wasn't
[1:32:59] picking on
[1:33:00] you actually I gave you a compliment
[1:33:03] didn't I I said you were
[1:33:05] attractive so anyway look at this see
[1:33:08] we're not we're not speaking to the
[1:33:10] unbeliever or the makeb believer Saints
[1:33:12] I'm speaking to the believer today
[1:33:14] because it's there we do not want
[1:33:17] iniquity to be named amongst us we don't
[1:33:20] want to become I mean the first church
[1:33:22] of the
[1:33:25] iniquity yeah over in Oregon there going
[1:33:27] to brother riches there's a church over
[1:33:30] there I won't go into it but you know
[1:33:32] they finally changed their sign last
[1:33:33] time we was over brother riches he was
[1:33:34] like praise God they changed their sign
[1:33:36] because you know you don't want you
[1:33:38] don't want your sign to give a pre uh um
[1:33:41] you know an idea of what you are and we
[1:33:45] changed our sign out here and said First
[1:33:46] Church of the iniquity you think we'd
[1:33:48] have any inv visitors well actually we
[1:33:50] might
[1:33:52] I never thought about
[1:33:54] that in the seven Church ages revelation
[1:33:56] of Jesus Christ brother Brown says you
[1:33:59] recall that I mentioned at the beginning
[1:34:00] of this message that this book we are
[1:34:02] studying is actual revelation of Jesus
[1:34:05] himself in the church and his work in
[1:34:07] the future ages then I mentioned that it
[1:34:09] takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[1:34:11] Revelation or we will fail to get it
[1:34:15] bringing those two thoughts together you
[1:34:16] will see it won't take just any ordinary
[1:34:18] study or thinking to make this book real
[1:34:21] it's going to take the operation of the
[1:34:23] Holy Ghost Can someone say thank you
[1:34:24] Lord that means that this book can't be
[1:34:27] revealed to anyone but a special class
[1:34:29] of people that is as great a compliment
[1:34:32] as God could give you the prophet could
[1:34:34] give you to declare you a special class
[1:34:38] of people not the ordinary not the just
[1:34:41] bypass of the you know the junk the
[1:34:43] rejects no uh special class of people
[1:34:47] amen hallelujah hallelujah any anyway it
[1:34:52] will take one with prophetic Insight I
[1:34:55] want to just ask you any of you got
[1:34:56] prophetic
[1:34:57] Insight on one side we'd say
[1:35:01] no but just stop and think about it
[1:35:03] that's
[1:35:04] right when the
[1:35:06] PHD g d l
[1:35:09] d double D
[1:35:12] whatever I've always thought D's were
[1:35:15] associated with dentist as a kid I'd
[1:35:18] hear brother brandham say that you know
[1:35:19] there there Double D I'm like they're
[1:35:21] Den
[1:35:24] H but look at this we get this idea God
[1:35:29] only deals with the
[1:35:31] preacher we get this idea that God only
[1:35:34] deals with the husband we get this idea
[1:35:37] that God only deals with the
[1:35:39] parents we get this idea that God only
[1:35:42] deals with someone else's
[1:35:44] family why don't we get the idea God
[1:35:47] called
[1:35:48] you is there any use here amen
[1:35:51] hallelujah amen amen we don't want to be
[1:35:54] unidentified right I was just asked to
[1:35:56] take a poll the other day and down there
[1:35:58] at the bottom are you white uh Hispanic
[1:36:00] black blah blah they had all these names
[1:36:03] or I
[1:36:06] unidentified and I looked at that and I
[1:36:10] just said here take your
[1:36:12] pole I am identified and I'm not
[1:36:15] identified with
[1:36:16] you sorry but you see this special class
[1:36:20] ability to hear from God that's right
[1:36:23] now my brother and sister I'm getting
[1:36:24] off track but that's fine we've got if
[1:36:26] the Lord comes tomorrow we don't have to
[1:36:27] worry about preaching it if he doesn't
[1:36:29] come for a long time we got plenty of
[1:36:30] time but look at this my brother and
[1:36:32] sister it takes an ability to hear from
[1:36:35] God I'll tell you what we need to do we
[1:36:37] need to teach our young people not all
[1:36:39] the doctrines we don't need to teach
[1:36:41] them about this is this and this deep
[1:36:43] thing over here and this is over here
[1:36:45] and this is why God sent a prophet we
[1:36:47] need to teach them how to hear from God
[1:36:51] because when they hear from God all of
[1:36:54] this other stuff will make sense but if
[1:36:57] we are trying to educate them into the
[1:36:59] message that they would come because
[1:37:01] they know what page in the seals book
[1:37:04] and what page in the church age book and
[1:37:06] what prophet said here but they don't
[1:37:08] have Revelation they can't live it amen
[1:37:12] amen but you get them to the point they
[1:37:15] know when God is dealing with them and
[1:37:18] it won't matter because God will speak
[1:37:21] to them amen no matter where they're at
[1:37:24] brother Flint uh will be aware of this I
[1:37:27] believe we were I was in Tac with you
[1:37:29] brother Flint at the time they shared
[1:37:30] the story of the grandfather I don't
[1:37:33] remember his name was in the hospital I
[1:37:34] believe it was in Bethal and God comes
[1:37:36] to him and he realizes what the word is
[1:37:41] he didn't have a book in his language he
[1:37:42] didn't speak English but he's laying
[1:37:45] there I believe it was a heart attack in
[1:37:46] the hospital and God gives him a vision
[1:37:49] and later when he shares that Vision to
[1:37:52] brother Andrew who spoke his language
[1:37:54] it's there and what it was was an
[1:37:57] unfolding right there he didn't need a b
[1:38:00] he didn't have a Bible he didn't have a
[1:38:01] church age book he didn't have the seals
[1:38:03] he didn't have all his things he had a
[1:38:05] desire for God Amen and God come to him
[1:38:07] and he got out of bed borrowed a snow
[1:38:09] machine from some relative of his and
[1:38:11] drove across I don't know if how far
[1:38:14] that is farther I'm going out in the
[1:38:15] cold amen and drove back there because
[1:38:18] he had to tell his
[1:38:20] people
[1:38:23] come on let's not start putting well
[1:38:25] this has to happen that has to happen
[1:38:27] this has to happen what we need to do is
[1:38:30] have an ability to hear from God it'll
[1:38:33] require Supernatural
[1:38:35] instruction what instruction now what's
[1:38:39] the problem I want to ask you this might
[1:38:40] be controversial I know where I stand on
[1:38:42] it
[1:38:43] instruction who's
[1:38:47] instructor God is who's he using
[1:38:54] we could argue who the instructor is
[1:38:56] instructor could be a
[1:38:59] pastor can be a brother sister
[1:39:02] teenager with a holy ghost
[1:39:05] experience be an instructor to other
[1:39:10] teenagers H come on that's right every
[1:39:14] one of
[1:39:17] us hear from God Supernatural
[1:39:20] instruction not just just a student
[1:39:21] comparing a verse with verse though that
[1:39:24] is good amen now but the mystery
[1:39:28] requires a teaching of the spirit or it
[1:39:30] never becomes clear how we need to hear
[1:39:33] from God and lay
[1:39:36] ourselves
[1:39:38] vulnerable now I want youall to go study
[1:39:40] the word vulnerable and you'll see why
[1:39:42] I'm throwing that in there do you
[1:39:43] realize very few of us are vulnerable
[1:39:50] amen
[1:39:55] I might have a hard time sitting down
[1:39:57] and telling
[1:39:59] you all of my complexes and all of the
[1:40:02] little issues of my life and all the
[1:40:05] doubts that wake me up in the middle of
[1:40:07] the
[1:40:12] night but when God makes you
[1:40:16] vulnerable that's when
[1:40:19] you
[1:40:21] open that's right and become
[1:40:25] yielded Lord I'm
[1:40:28] afraid Lord I'm
[1:40:31] confused I have unanswered
[1:40:36] questions I have something against a
[1:40:38] brother I recognize I don't have
[1:40:39] Brotherly
[1:40:41] Love come on it takes a vulnerable
[1:40:45] person one who will lay themselves over
[1:40:51] open
[1:40:53] amen amen amen that's right but what if
[1:40:55] I
[1:40:56] do how will people look at
[1:40:59] me well if you are
[1:41:02] looking or living or worshiping with a
[1:41:04] group of people and by God's grace the
[1:41:08] opening the opening the opening the
[1:41:12] opening the
[1:41:14] opening it will only be those who have
[1:41:17] remained
[1:41:18] closed who will be judgmental amen
[1:41:21] that's right it will be those that are
[1:41:26] closed that will be critical of
[1:41:29] you because everyone who has laid
[1:41:31] themselves bear will be saying Thank You
[1:41:35] Lord amen thank you Lord your power your
[1:41:38] majesty has come once again in our
[1:41:42] midst oh hallelujah
[1:41:45] amen well Saints don't want to
[1:41:48] disappoint any of you but we ain't even
[1:41:50] off page
[1:41:51] one amen sister
[1:41:54] Sarah come if you would
[1:41:58] please want to back up
[1:42:01] though what does that Top Line
[1:42:08] say but a mystery that's right
[1:42:13] requires not
[1:42:15] voluntary it
[1:42:19] requires I'll just give you a hint of
[1:42:21] what's farther down the pages you see
[1:42:23] there's a mystery of
[1:42:25] iniquity and a mystery of
[1:42:28] righteousness right amen it requires a
[1:42:31] teaching of the spirit that's right
[1:42:34] rightly divide the word of God to be
[1:42:36] able to allow and I'm going to
[1:42:39] abbreviate this I'm
[1:42:42] done once again the
[1:42:44] [Music]
[1:42:45] cups cup of iniquity filling
[1:42:48] up bitterness
[1:42:52] vanities
[1:42:54] Pride maybe serious
[1:42:57] stuff those are
[1:42:59] just Child's
[1:43:03] Play prophet of God says you know people
[1:43:05] murder people all the time now we're
[1:43:08] getting down serious right the
[1:43:10] shoplifter doesn't go to prison for 40
[1:43:12] plus years no
[1:43:14] parole but the murderer
[1:43:17] does but God comes and through the
[1:43:20] mystery
[1:43:21] the manifestation of the
[1:43:23] mystery he pours righteousness
[1:43:26] in and
[1:43:29] iniquity
[1:43:30] fleas it
[1:43:33] oil and
[1:43:34] water and when the oil the spirit of
[1:43:37] God's poured in that dirty
[1:43:41] iniquity flows away and we can stand
[1:43:44] literally today and let's stand we can
[1:43:47] stand today and literally say I am
[1:43:52] free I am free the
[1:43:55] chains the
[1:43:58] bonds Satan's
[1:44:01] snares all broke
[1:44:04] free and the scripture says he who is
[1:44:06] free is free
[1:44:08] indeed
