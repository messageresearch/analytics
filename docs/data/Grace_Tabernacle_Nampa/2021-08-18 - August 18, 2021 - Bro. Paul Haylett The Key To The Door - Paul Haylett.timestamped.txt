[25:18] um
[25:19] no place like home though
[25:21] amen so
[25:22] good to be here tonight amen
[25:25] and uh
[25:27] brother sergey shared a just a
[25:30] lovely little video of i'm pretty sure
[25:33] it must be the church in danesque
[25:35] uh but the believers there and and uh
[25:40] so just definitely keep him in your
[25:42] prayers
[25:45] for all the things that are happening
[25:46] you know and things that are necessary
[25:48] to take care of and
[25:50] and each and every one missing brother
[25:53] ivan sister nadia tonight i don't know
[25:55] maybe maybe you know where they're at
[25:56] but i don't
[25:58] but anyway just uh each and every one
[26:00] that's a part of the assembly we just
[26:02] just want to keep them up in prayer amen
[26:06] let's just
[26:08] stand and go into the word tonight just
[26:10] want to be kind of timely a lot of
[26:13] things
[26:14] that um
[26:16] we want to preach on i want to it
[26:18] doesn't really fit into my original
[26:22] age-old proverbs but uh these things are
[26:25] are you know kind of you might say
[26:27] coming out of um
[26:31] those studies uh that they just kind of
[26:33] keep speaking so tonight i'd like to
[26:35] speak uh a key to the door amen
[26:39] and um you will find as we get a little
[26:41] farther in the service this is actually
[26:42] a message brother branham preached and
[26:45] and uh just inspired by what i'm
[26:48] studying in that and how
[26:50] it just reflects uh in in our lives
[26:53] uh that certain things you know are a
[26:56] key to us
[26:57] and uh
[26:58] uh
[26:59] it's kind of ironic and i'll share that
[27:01] a little later in the service today that
[27:03] even while i was
[27:05] thinking these last few days and and uh
[27:08] you know studying towards this
[27:10] um
[27:11] had a very event today happened to me
[27:13] just just happened and i'll share that
[27:16] with you in in just a little bit amen
[27:19] key to the door amen let's turn in first
[27:21] corinthians uh very familiar scripture
[27:24] to you
[27:25] uh that uh we have uh no doubt all of us
[27:29] read many many times
[27:32] um and uh uh
[27:35] just um
[27:36] still speaks to us right the word just
[27:38] is always speaking amen this message is
[27:42] just always speaking it's not a message
[27:44] of some day gone by where we're just
[27:47] reciting things it was spoken
[27:50] by now
[27:52] mind how i say this
[27:54] by a man that others say is not
[27:58] and we say is
[28:00] if you understand what i'm saying we're
[28:01] not just reciting words
[28:04] it has come so alive to us
[28:07] that what we read on the page resonates
[28:11] down in our soul that this
[28:13] is truth
[28:15] this is life
[28:17] sister jerry uh just shared a blip of a
[28:19] quote i almost just spontaneously added
[28:22] it into the service but brother
[28:24] branham's saying
[28:25] uh that you know the reason satan can't
[28:28] deceive the very left you see he gets a
[28:30] little of it here and he gets a little
[28:32] of it here but he can't get it all
[28:35] together
[28:36] and so
[28:37] he won't deceive the elect because
[28:39] something has stirred into the heart
[28:41] of the elect that
[28:43] is is a recognition of who she is
[28:47] and i i would use this kind of earthly
[28:50] example
[28:51] that you have a young lady
[28:53] uh she gets married
[28:56] and uh um we would have to stop and say
[28:59] there's an issue if one year two years
[29:01] three years later she stops and says now
[29:04] who am i
[29:07] doesn't remember
[29:08] who she is see we'd say okay she has
[29:11] amnesia
[29:13] and this bride is recognizing
[29:15] who she is and brother branham you know
[29:18] a quote we might almost say is famous he
[29:20] says you know
[29:21] when she recognizes who she is
[29:24] she'll become that invincible army and
[29:26] saints that's not something far off in
[29:28] the future that's not something like a
[29:31] pie in the sky thing that we're just
[29:32] hoping oh when will this happen
[29:34] it is happening
[29:36] and this this bride is coming to a place
[29:39] that she is stalwart she's faithful
[29:41] she's unmovable amen
[29:45] first corinthians second chapter
[29:46] starting with the fifth verse that your
[29:49] faith should not stand in the wisdom of
[29:52] men
[29:53] but in the power of god i say amen to
[29:56] that
[29:57] how be it we speak wisdom among them
[30:00] that are perfect yet not the wisdom of
[30:02] this world nor the of the princes of
[30:05] this world that come to naught but we
[30:07] speak the wisdom of god in a mystery
[30:10] even the hidden wisdom which god
[30:12] ordained before the world unto our glory
[30:16] so you look at this my brother and
[30:17] sister because it's not really my focus
[30:19] but i want to just speak on it just real
[30:20] quick
[30:21] this hidden wisdom
[30:23] see
[30:24] this is what god is revealing this is
[30:28] as we would often times say is
[30:30] revelation
[30:32] but
[30:33] i want you to catch this now we would
[30:37] not expect our young children
[30:41] to
[30:42] understand trigonometry
[30:46] are you studying that kind of stuff vika
[30:49] not yet okay i just say that for an
[30:51] example see
[30:52] we wouldn't expect
[30:54] a a young student to be in trigonometry
[30:58] but the foundational stones are being
[31:01] laid
[31:02] that are bringing to the day
[31:05] that she will or all of our young people
[31:08] will
[31:09] study something of that form
[31:12] and so the steps have to be put in place
[31:14] you can't draw a child from the cradle
[31:17] and then tell them now figure this out
[31:20] this is what god's doing this hidden
[31:22] mystery my brother and sister is not
[31:24] someone coming
[31:25] as it were and writing it out on a
[31:28] chalkboard
[31:30] that we can look at and say oh there's
[31:33] the mystery
[31:34] the mystery
[31:36] is being revealed
[31:38] because we are part
[31:41] of that mystery
[31:44] amen we can't say that we are the whole
[31:46] mystery right because the prophet of god
[31:48] says that uh we are a part of him and he
[31:50] is a part of us and the two parts make
[31:53] the whole
[31:54] amen isn't that beautiful
[31:56] i love that but we speak the wisdom of
[31:59] god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom
[32:02] which god ordained before the world and
[32:04] to our glory which none of the princes
[32:07] of this world knew for had they known it
[32:09] they would not have crucified the lord
[32:11] of glory but as it is written i hath not
[32:14] seen nor ear heard nor have entered into
[32:17] the heart of man the things which god
[32:19] hath prepared for them that love him
[32:22] but god hath revealed them unto us by
[32:25] his spirit
[32:27] for the spirit searcheth all things yea
[32:30] the deep things of god
[32:32] for what man knoweth
[32:34] the things of a man save the spirit of a
[32:36] man which is in him even so the things
[32:39] of god knoweth no man but the spirit of
[32:42] god
[32:43] now we have received
[32:46] see i love how this is put because
[32:48] really if we accept the word as it was
[32:51] given to us
[32:52] it is speaking in a past tense we are
[32:55] not looking at that saying someday right
[32:58] before the rapture god's going to pour
[33:00] one last burst of revelation out to the
[33:03] bride so shall have faith enough to take
[33:05] a rapture
[33:06] no my brother and sister this is being
[33:09] birthed as it were in the bride of
[33:11] christ right now day by day now we have
[33:16] received can we say amen
[33:18] not the spirit of the world but the
[33:20] spirit which is of god that we might
[33:22] know the things that are freely given to
[33:25] us of god which things also we speak not
[33:29] in the words which man's wisdom teaches
[33:32] but which the holy ghost teaches
[33:34] comparing spiritual things with
[33:36] spiritual
[33:37] and let me elaborate real quick here
[33:39] sorry to keep you standing but my
[33:41] brother and sister without the spirit of
[33:43] god
[33:44] all we can do is approach these things
[33:47] from
[33:48] intellect
[33:50] from learning
[33:53] brother branham i'll jump ahead of
[33:54] myself a little bit brother brown says
[33:56] you'll never figure these things out by
[33:58] some casual study of the word of god
[34:02] you can't just say i'm going to study my
[34:03] bible i'm going to read what this
[34:05] commentary is and this commentary and
[34:07] all of these and i'll get this figured
[34:09] out it won't work
[34:14] but the natural man receiveth not the
[34:16] things of the spirit of god for they are
[34:18] foolishness unto him neither can he know
[34:21] them because they are spiritually
[34:23] discerned but he that is spiritual
[34:26] judgeth all things yet he himself is
[34:30] judged of no man for who hath known the
[34:32] mind of the lord that he may instruct
[34:35] him
[34:36] i just i i just never tire of this
[34:38] scripture
[34:39] but we
[34:41] oh i could almost just jump up and shout
[34:43] right now but we
[34:45] have the mind
[34:47] of christ
[34:49] oh hallelujah heavenly father we just
[34:51] thank you today
[34:52] lord your love your grace your mercy
[34:54] father
[34:56] lord just
[34:57] how we can't even hardly sing of these
[34:59] things father but our heart becomes
[35:02] tender
[35:03] lord we just are moved father not just
[35:06] by a realm of emotion but father
[35:10] by the great presence of you and our
[35:13] life and
[35:14] how lord we love you for what you've
[35:17] done and
[35:18] father we just want to give our part
[35:20] back to you
[35:21] give you praise give you glory give you
[35:23] honor
[35:24] lord once again father just lift up
[35:27] every one of these needs and lord just
[35:31] several needs in this assembly lord that
[35:33] are very strong upon my heart
[35:35] father you know them and i just ask you
[35:37] to touch them in the precious name of
[35:40] jesus christ amen you may be seated
[35:44] now as we would look here tonight
[35:47] i would just like to
[35:49] just give a reminder my brother and
[35:51] sister if we hold to the scripture if we
[35:54] have not let something come in
[35:56] that has anointed us with a spirit of
[35:59] future tense
[36:00] uh but if we have held on to the word of
[36:03] god and and uh embraced it for what it
[36:06] says
[36:07] uh
[36:08] never forget
[36:10] we have the mind of christ
[36:13] that is what the word in this hour was
[36:15] sent to do was to bring us from all the
[36:18] confusion bring us from all of the
[36:21] shadowy figures that were out there one
[36:24] saying this one saying that
[36:27] you know i i won't tell you what
[36:29] scripture to do but if you'd like a
[36:30] little homework just pick some of the
[36:33] what we would consider foundational
[36:35] scriptures
[36:36] and just go online and type those in and
[36:40] ask you know the
[36:42] search engine for commentary
[36:44] and you will find things that uh just
[36:47] directly
[36:48] conflict with each other things that are
[36:50] so convoluted as things that that just
[36:54] you no wonder the world's in the
[36:55] condition it is and uh reminds me of one
[36:58] time listening um while i was in a
[37:01] tractor uh on the radio and the uh
[37:04] catholic uh bible's answer hour and uh
[37:07] this man called in and says uh you know
[37:10] i i thought i'll tell you what i thought
[37:12] i thought maybe this man had encountered
[37:14] a message believer because he says now
[37:16] you know i i haven't been on fire
[37:19] catholic but it's still the foundation
[37:21] my faith but i'm working with this
[37:23] individual who is talking to me about
[37:25] prophets and talking to me about end
[37:27] time scripture and talking to me about
[37:29] things like acts 2 38 and uh talking to
[37:32] me about all of this and and you said i
[37:35] it troubles me because when i ask him
[37:38] questions he has answers
[37:41] and he says i'm calling you today
[37:43] because i i want to settle this
[37:45] confusion and so
[37:47] why what about and he names off several
[37:49] questions what about this this this and
[37:51] this and so this man that was the the
[37:54] man on the catholic answer hour is there
[37:57] and he starts going in uh to this deal
[38:00] and takes quite a lengthy uh discourse
[38:03] and as he he winds up his discourse uh
[38:06] he kind of all cheer he says uh well i'm
[38:09] so glad i could uh
[38:11] you know
[38:12] speak to you about this and then there's
[38:14] a dead silence and the man's voice comes
[38:16] on and says
[38:17] you didn't answer even one
[38:20] of my questions
[38:22] you see there was somebody that you know
[38:24] not to look at the critical side but
[38:26] there was someone who was caring about
[38:28] his soul enough to look into this and
[38:32] and you know one thing that struck me
[38:34] was is this man when i talk to him he
[38:36] has answers and i say my brother and
[38:39] sister we have the answer we might not
[38:41] be scholars but we have the answer
[38:43] because the mystery is not been revealed
[38:46] to us it's been revealed in us
[38:49] amen the very life of jesus christ is
[38:52] being manifested and we'll read some
[38:54] things here in a little bit kind of
[38:56] reinforcing that now you know we look at
[38:59] this and i want to just bring this up
[39:00] because i found this to be a very
[39:03] encouraging little quote i was looking
[39:06] into another thought as it were and i
[39:09] just i'm just sharing this it's not
[39:11] necessarily
[39:12] in line with what we're talking about
[39:14] tonight but i just liked it and yes i
[39:16] cherry-picked it
[39:18] so if anybody hears this and says it
[39:20] looks like brother paul is
[39:21] cherry-picking quotes we all do you
[39:24] imagine if we wanted to draw from two or
[39:26] three thoughts that we would be six or
[39:28] eight hours while we go through every
[39:31] bit of the the the sermon or the
[39:33] whatever but look at this but god's
[39:36] little group
[39:39] is his bride
[39:40] hallelujah don't that just make your
[39:42] heart happy we're not a sideline amen
[39:45] god didn't just say you know what i've
[39:46] got these people they're doing their
[39:48] very best they're reading and they're
[39:50] studying and they're praying and they're
[39:52] trusting but they're a sideline
[39:56] no sir
[39:57] god's little group is his bride
[40:00] centered
[40:02] on that word
[40:04] by not leaning to the writer leaning to
[40:06] the left not not getting some
[40:08] perspective over here that we have to
[40:11] just be all emotional to have it or over
[40:14] here that we must be all scholarly to
[40:16] have it or uh we must uh you know set
[40:20] under a certain ministry as it were i'll
[40:23] tell you the ministry we need to sit
[40:24] under and that's the ministry of the
[40:26] holy ghost amen because he uses who he
[40:29] chooses to use amen so let's just get
[40:32] under the ministry of the holy ghost and
[40:34] then whoever god uses to speak to us
[40:36] will be sufficient amen centered on that
[40:39] word may the dear heavenly father ever
[40:42] keep you and this is the word i actually
[40:43] looked up stabilized well the dear
[40:46] heavenly father ever keep you stabilized
[40:49] right there don't you never move from
[40:53] that word
[40:54] so i i think we can take this um this is
[40:58] uh you know april of 65. i think we can
[41:01] take this as as a a a a anchor point as
[41:05] it were that he's he's telling us don't
[41:08] ever move from the word
[41:10] if there's something comes along and
[41:12] with uh this little quote that jerry
[41:14] sent me you know satan's gonna come you
[41:16] see what he's trying to do he tries to
[41:18] come in and get us to get caught up on
[41:20] one little idea or ideology or one
[41:23] little thing over here and then if he
[41:25] can get us off center and get us into a
[41:28] certain little thought then the door is
[41:30] open and he can magnify or work on that
[41:33] but if we as sons and daughters of god
[41:36] never move from the word if we're always
[41:39] just come right back to the center of
[41:42] the word amen satan's got nowhere to get
[41:45] to us because what happens is is the
[41:47] word is the only thing we're resting on
[41:49] we're not resting on our own ability our
[41:51] own intellect or on whatever reminds me
[41:54] brother doug baker down in tucson this
[41:57] was shared with me one time
[41:59] a brother was talking to brother doug
[42:00] baker and and uh he said you know i just
[42:03] don't understand why why
[42:06] people don't get this he says you know
[42:08] it's not rocking science
[42:10] and and brother doug was a
[42:12] rocket scientist
[42:14] and
[42:15] and he goes you know it's actually
[42:16] closer to rocket science than you think
[42:20] because in rocket science you have to
[42:22] first build the rocket
[42:24] and it has to be done right according to
[42:26] the plans
[42:28] and it has to be done and he explains
[42:30] this out you know and i always thought
[42:32] that was a little bit humorous right
[42:34] because somebody's just uh verbiage
[42:36] would be ah it's not rocket science but
[42:39] really think about it saints it really
[42:41] is rocket science because if we deviate
[42:44] from the plan
[42:46] amen remember years ago sadly enough one
[42:48] of our our uh uh space shuttles blew up
[42:52] because somebody didn't put an o-ring
[42:56] incorrectly
[42:58] so millions of dollars and i don't know
[43:00] seven eight nine lives
[43:02] because someone didn't follow the
[43:04] directions and put an o-ring in
[43:06] correctly when that o-ring blew out it
[43:09] allowed oxygen to be sucked into a place
[43:12] that oxygen wasn't supposed to be and
[43:15] that
[43:16] peroxide whatever that they were using
[43:18] for jet fuel when it comes in contact
[43:20] with oxygen explodes
[43:22] so it was something so simple so i i
[43:26] hope that you know kind of spoke to you
[43:28] we just want to say centered on the word
[43:30] amen we want to be stabilized there
[43:33] hallelujah now to
[43:38] when we look at this uh to know that the
[43:41] mind of christ is to have the correct
[43:43] revelation of the word right so god will
[43:46] never take us or draw us away from his
[43:48] own word so when we say you know i've
[43:51] got the mind of christ that is us
[43:54] understanding the revelation of the word
[43:57] in the hour that we live in now this
[43:59] gives us
[44:00] i'm using these words interchangeable
[44:02] and i hope that's all right with you
[44:04] tonight but he gives us wisdom
[44:08] but we can also term that is revelation
[44:11] because once we really see the opening
[44:13] of the word that is wisdom as it were
[44:16] that we then understand how this applies
[44:19] to us in the day that we're living and i
[44:22] didn't want to go into politics tonight
[44:23] but several things that have just
[44:25] happened in the last few days is just uh
[44:28] speaking out to me my brother and sister
[44:30] that that these things that we see in
[44:32] the scripture things that were
[44:34] prophesied are coming to pass they don't
[44:36] even make the headlines of the world
[44:38] news they don't even make any of this
[44:40] but it's coming to pass it's all just
[44:43] like the move of god is most the time
[44:45] it's out of sight kind of out of mind
[44:48] it's not it's not catching the the
[44:50] attention of the people but still it is
[44:53] clearly coming to pass
[44:56] and so in that we recognize that this
[44:59] will be such that one day they will say
[45:02] hey wasn't elias
[45:05] supposed to come
[45:08] but he did come
[45:10] but he didn't show up on cnn
[45:13] he didn't show up on the front page he
[45:15] didn't we were too preoccupied i hope
[45:18] you catch this and then we'll move on we
[45:20] were too preoccupied
[45:24] with a southern border
[45:27] we were too preoccupied
[45:30] with inflation
[45:31] now having broached 25 growth
[45:36] in eight months or seven months or
[45:38] whatever it is see
[45:40] we're too preoccupied
[45:44] that didn't stop it from coming to pass
[45:48] see that's satan's little thing he's
[45:51] doing is we get to looking here we're
[45:53] looking to hear and all of this is
[45:56] happening
[45:57] and it will be just as it was what was
[46:00] not elias supposed to come
[46:03] so he gives us wisdom which is
[46:04] revelation my brother and sister this is
[46:06] not just general knowledge that's where
[46:08] i got ahead of myself brother branham
[46:10] said this wonder can't come just by a
[46:13] study of the scriptures you can't just
[46:15] pick up a bible and commentary and look
[46:18] through this and come up with the
[46:19] correct conclusion it takes a a
[46:23] knowledge a wisdom of god which is in
[46:26] this revelation so through this wisdom
[46:29] revelation we then have a key amen and
[46:33] what it is is god is giving to you and i
[46:36] it doesn't matter our age our young
[46:38] people it's their don't say oh well when
[46:40] i get older no it right now is just as
[46:43] good a time to get the key as any time
[46:47] in your life in fact it's better satan
[46:48] works as we get older it's harder for us
[46:51] to break certain things in our life and
[46:54] so it's as a young person uh just uh let
[46:57] it be part of your everyday cry to the
[47:00] lord lord i desire this key i desire to
[47:03] possess what is necessary for me to see
[47:06] who i am amen we have now in the united
[47:10] states one of the greatest psychological
[47:13] wars going on and it is called an
[47:16] identity crisis and so we have now uh
[47:19] just uh i won't get sidetracked to this
[47:21] but we have now a place where people are
[47:25] teachers in schools they might be in
[47:27] their 20s 30s 40s 50s they themselves
[47:30] have an identity crisis and so they feel
[47:34] compelled to pass that same identity
[47:37] crisis on to the students that are in
[47:39] their classes so because they have never
[47:42] really found who they are and unless
[47:44] they cry out to the lord they never will
[47:47] amen this is not just about gender it's
[47:49] not just about those things my brother
[47:51] and sister it's about who we really are
[47:53] all the rest of this is satan's smoke
[47:56] screen for the reality of finding out
[47:58] who we really are amen so we come and
[48:02] through revelation through wisdom uh we
[48:04] find the key and in this sermon right
[48:07] here and i would encourage you to read
[48:09] it or listen to it it's just a very good
[48:12] a strong foundational message sermon
[48:15] that was given he says now in hebrews
[48:17] the 11th chapter i got a great string of
[48:20] them wrote down here of these heroes of
[48:22] faith it was the key to the door that
[48:25] stopped the mouth of lions
[48:27] right it wasn't a frantic man's prayer
[48:29] my brother and sister that stopped the
[48:31] mouth of a lion it was someone who
[48:34] possessed the key amen
[48:38] it was the key
[48:41] faith
[48:43] see there's the key
[48:45] to the door that stopped the mouth line
[48:46] it was the key faith that unlocked the
[48:48] prison houses it was faith the key of
[48:51] faith that quenched the violence of fire
[48:53] escape the edge of the sword brought the
[48:55] dead back to life again it was faith the
[48:58] key of faith in the living god that hand
[49:01] that man that woman who can take that
[49:04] key of faith they can unlock every
[49:06] promise of god made
[49:08] see this is not confined to a ministry
[49:12] this is not confined to us looking to
[49:14] brother branham we respect that we hold
[49:16] them to the highest regard amen we we
[49:19] just i i look for the day to be able to
[49:22] stand before him as a son of god and say
[49:25] thank you for what you have given to us
[49:28] but my brother and sister this promise
[49:30] amen this word is a covenant because
[49:33] between god almighty our lord jesus
[49:36] christ and you and i amen we don't have
[49:38] a second or third or fourth person to go
[49:40] through we don't have a man that's an
[49:43] intercessor we don't have as it were in
[49:45] the flesh a high priest amen this is
[49:48] something god has given to us amen and
[49:52] we can unlock
[49:55] these promises
[49:57] we don't have to look to someone else
[49:59] and say oh they've got a key
[50:02] our pastor's got a key we'll we'll just
[50:04] wait till the pastor unlocks this
[50:07] no
[50:08] we have
[50:10] a key yes
[50:16] who can take the key of faith they can
[50:18] unlock every promise god made but if you
[50:20] haven't got that key
[50:22] you're just pragging and i was going to
[50:24] spend a moment and i got kind of
[50:26] distracted
[50:28] i don't guess i've ever heard the word
[50:29] progging before
[50:32] is it what
[50:33] search
[50:34] okay somebody's looked it up
[50:36] you're just progress you'll never unlock
[50:39] it you'll beat against it because this
[50:42] key any correct made key has levers on
[50:45] the inside the lock and it takes a
[50:48] certain form a certain shape of them
[50:51] keys to turn those levers and just one
[50:54] little lever out of the way will mess
[50:56] the whole thing up isn't that uh
[50:59] interesting you know because as we look
[51:02] about that my brother and sister it's
[51:04] it's just so interesting therefore
[51:06] i believe the full gospel every word of
[51:10] god that turns the power of god loose
[51:12] that turns his blessings to the people
[51:15] is the key to the door that unlocks it
[51:18] but oh those great heroes those prophets
[51:21] a great men of the bible
[51:22] that have that key that's the reason
[51:24] they could stop the mouth of lions
[51:26] quench the violence of fire escape the
[51:28] edge of the sword bring the dead back to
[51:30] life and do all kinds of miracles is
[51:32] because they held that key and they
[51:35] knowed it worked because it was a
[51:39] scripture-born key
[51:42] i love that my brother and sister you
[51:44] and i possess a key this evening can you
[51:46] say amen we possess a key why because
[51:49] that little quote that i read earlier i
[51:51] said that just turned it is because god
[51:53] not because somebody preached it to you
[51:55] not because somebody said you got to get
[51:57] balanced and centered on the word you
[51:59] need to get stabilized it's something
[52:02] god is doing in us
[52:04] amen it is not that we we do this to
[52:07] conform to a certain creed or ethic of
[52:09] our church it is just happening
[52:13] all i can say is thank you lord it is
[52:16] happening
[52:17] we are coming to a place that we find
[52:19] ourselves we look this way and if god
[52:22] corrects us then we move we don't say no
[52:25] no i'm going to continue i'm going to
[52:27] continue to go down the way i'm going we
[52:30] become tenderized to the moving of the
[52:33] holy spirit and if he says no you went
[52:35] too far left or too far right we we say
[52:38] yes lord now show us the center once
[52:40] again take me right back to the word and
[52:42] you see what it is is we are being
[52:44] stabilized in this scripture-born key
[52:48] and because that word is now in control
[52:50] of our life
[52:52] you know it's interesting um uh
[52:55] we were over in oregon one time there
[52:57] with brother rich and sister charity and
[53:00] and uh they took me to
[53:02] a place and we were looking at a uh
[53:05] wasn't a leader it was citation
[53:08] and um
[53:09] you know it was so funny uh how that god
[53:12] just dealt with me i'm just there to
[53:14] admire this fancy jet that this guy
[53:16] flies and and um you know it's so
[53:20] interesting so
[53:21] um
[53:22] he had silas get out of the plane silas
[53:25] boy he was just enjoying sitting in this
[53:27] cockpit of this state-of-the-art plane
[53:30] and he had silas get out and go
[53:32] and put his hand on the metal case that
[53:35] holds the fire extinguisher and he put
[53:37] his hand on there and then he said come
[53:39] back silas and silas like hurry goes oh
[53:41] you don't need to hurry my brother and
[53:43] sister
[53:44] in the infrared landing system of this
[53:46] airplane that handprint the heat
[53:50] from that handprint was just as clear as
[53:52] a handprint before you
[53:55] and it stayed there forever
[53:58] and he says this is what struck me
[54:01] he says this infrared deal you come
[54:03] landing in the fog
[54:06] you can't see anything
[54:08] but if the lights on the runway were
[54:10] ever turned on that night
[54:13] the heat
[54:14] from that
[54:16] shows up
[54:17] just as though the light is shining
[54:21] so
[54:22] sensitive now i want to take you what
[54:25] struck me
[54:27] the holy spirit so faithful to you and i
[54:31] in our worst days
[54:34] struggling wondering if
[54:36] we love ourself if anyone loves us if
[54:39] god loves us
[54:40] anywhere the hand of god
[54:43] has touched our life
[54:46] the holy spirit
[54:48] can guide you right back to that place
[54:51] it's not i'm
[54:53] too far gone
[54:57] he said when they first bought that
[54:58] plane he actually had the owner
[55:01] they did a demonstration one night and
[55:04] the plane has ils on it and they turned
[55:07] off the landing the the runway lights
[55:09] and the plane was ils
[55:12] and not only were they coming in on the
[55:13] glide scope
[55:15] but he said he's looking out there
[55:18] and every light as it comes down to the
[55:20] runway there's no lights on but every
[55:22] light
[55:23] was though it was still shining
[55:26] and i'm telling you in the darkest of
[55:28] times which we are living the power of
[55:30] god is visible to the bride of christ
[55:34] it has never and it will never satan
[55:37] thinking i'm blocking this all out i'm
[55:39] putting darkness over the earth i'm
[55:42] smothering all truth on the earth but
[55:44] where the holy spirit's ever been god's
[55:47] enlightening to the bride of christ it's
[55:49] so real to her god's revealing that to
[55:52] her and while the whole world has taken
[55:55] a compromised position this bride in
[55:57] this darkness
[55:59] can just move right to the center of the
[56:01] word and continue on i hope that made
[56:03] sense to you amen i remember it just
[56:06] stirred my heart i thought praise the
[56:08] lord
[56:08] praise the lord satan commits to you and
[56:11] i in the flesh it looks like the lights
[56:13] are going out
[56:14] but to god it's like don't worry
[56:16] i've touched you i've touched the world
[56:18] you live in right creating your own
[56:20] atmosphere i've touched the world you
[56:22] live in i've touched your life and it is
[56:24] all visible and i will reveal that and
[56:27] you will not lose your way in laodicea
[56:30] hallelujah now if i'm pragging with a
[56:32] creed key
[56:34] i don't know what it's going to do if
[56:36] they say my church teaches this i hope
[56:38] we don't ever use that as a fallback
[56:41] i don't know about
[56:42] that but when the bible teaches it i
[56:46] hold the key of faith in my hand or in
[56:49] my heart that says that's god's word
[56:52] that'll quench the violence of fire
[56:54] it'll unlock the healing for the sick
[56:55] it'll unlock salvation to the lost i
[56:58] have come to the door and everything's
[57:00] in his name
[57:02] whatever you do in word or dude indeed
[57:05] do it all in his name
[57:07] knowing that the key that you got is
[57:10] faith
[57:11] now saints you don't have to lift a hand
[57:13] you don't have to say a word
[57:16] but i believe i
[57:17] kind of understand human nature enough
[57:20] sometimes
[57:22] we get these feelings
[57:24] i don't have enough faith
[57:32] how are you going to get more faith
[57:35] the word
[57:37] the answer is right there right cometh
[57:39] by hearing the word of god
[57:42] but if you ever come to a place that
[57:43] satan's just beating on you and you
[57:45] think i don't have enough faith
[57:47] don't despair don't sit down and cry
[57:49] don't don't you know just
[57:52] have a pity party just
[57:54] go get centered back up on the word and
[57:57] let it stabilize you because i
[58:00] this is just a paul opinion okay don't
[58:02] make a big deal out of it
[58:05] i think we have misunderstood faith
[58:09] i think i'm looking at people that faith
[58:11] is in action every single day of your
[58:13] life
[58:14] i look at a people that faith is what is
[58:17] stabilizing you and that's the reason
[58:18] you haven't been washed away with the
[58:20] tide of unbelief in the day we live in
[58:22] it's faith that held you when you felt
[58:24] like you couldn't do this when you
[58:26] couldn't you couldn't make it no more
[58:28] further
[58:29] when you say i can't do this i just got
[58:31] a prayer request from a brother for his
[58:33] grandson today and his grandsons
[58:34] breaking up cracking up saying i can't
[58:36] do this any longer i can't do this any
[58:38] longer
[58:41] and in the native world my brother and
[58:43] sister that means the devil's telling
[58:44] him kill yourself
[58:46] kill himself
[58:48] nothing matters kill yourself
[58:51] it's the devil's language
[58:52] but you see faith is here it's what's
[58:55] stabilizing us
[58:57] it's not i i have an understanding of
[58:59] the message of the hour no it's god in
[59:01] you
[59:02] it's this word down deep in the heart
[59:04] and soul that just holds you when all is
[59:07] dark and to realize that oh i hope you
[59:09] catch this that god has touched your
[59:12] life and it's visible
[59:14] i don't care about the darkness he's
[59:16] touched you and it's visible
[59:20] hallelujah
[59:26] denominational key i don't know what
[59:27] it'll do but if it's scriptural key it
[59:29] unlocked because god said so now oh no
[59:32] wonder they could stop the violence of
[59:33] fire so forth they had the key
[59:36] now god's first nod
[59:38] to one of those prophets nothing could
[59:40] stop them he didn't have to do like he
[59:42] does to me sometime
[59:44] wow
[59:45] hope i don't get accused of criticizing
[59:47] the prophet by reading this
[59:50] he didn't have to do
[59:51] like he does to me sometimes pound it
[59:54] over and over
[59:55] oh okay we're good we're good
[59:58] and perhaps you
[1:00:01] we balanced it out
[1:00:03] the prophet god's like god this has to
[1:00:05] pound it pound it pound it oh wait just
[1:00:07] like you two
[1:00:10] i hope not but keep telling me
[1:00:13] go do this and then you'll stumble along
[1:00:16] then go do this i know he's not talking
[1:00:18] to any of you tonight amen then go do
[1:00:20] this and go back and do it again you
[1:00:23] didn't do it right
[1:00:25] just one little nod
[1:00:26] just they could just feel the spirit
[1:00:29] tell them
[1:00:31] it's the thing to do
[1:00:33] and nothing's going to stop them
[1:00:36] now i want to ask you tonight i hope i'm
[1:00:37] not just too homegrown tonight for you
[1:00:41] do god ever just like deal with your
[1:00:43] heart and you don't even know why you're
[1:00:44] doing what you're doing
[1:00:48] you just feel
[1:00:50] to pick up a phone
[1:00:53] you feel
[1:00:54] to just do something i don't want to
[1:00:58] go into a detail that you just feel to
[1:01:00] do it and yet some might say well we
[1:01:03] don't go by feelings
[1:01:04] well i'm sorry i do
[1:01:07] i do
[1:01:08] because the holy ghost comes down and
[1:01:10] moves upon us
[1:01:12] and something inside of us because of
[1:01:14] the way god created us
[1:01:16] we have no explanation
[1:01:19] and we just do it
[1:01:21] and find out that what we did was the
[1:01:24] will of god
[1:01:25] it was the desire of god but he had a
[1:01:28] vessel that he could move
[1:01:31] amen it's not really a move of god if we
[1:01:33] have a d9 caterpillar and a great big
[1:01:36] trackhoe and all these things and god's
[1:01:39] over there saying okay i'll move you
[1:01:43] that's not god moving
[1:01:45] my brother and sister god is stirring
[1:01:48] the very very feathery heart
[1:01:50] heartstrings
[1:01:52] of the hearts of sons and daughters of
[1:01:54] god because this is the kind of
[1:01:56] relationship
[1:01:58] we're moving into
[1:02:02] well praise the lord
[1:02:10] i got myself lost here
[1:02:15] and go back and do it again you didn't
[1:02:17] do it right boy
[1:02:19] i'm telling you i've i've heard that one
[1:02:21] just a little nod just could just feel
[1:02:22] the spirit tell them it's the thing to
[1:02:24] do nothing's going to stop them brother
[1:02:26] they they stopped the mouth of lions
[1:02:28] they escaped the edge of the sword they
[1:02:30] quenched fire they done everything just
[1:02:33] a little nod from god
[1:02:35] because they held the key in their hand
[1:02:37] that great faith they've done things for
[1:02:40] god because nothing will stop them oh
[1:02:43] glorious i'm going to ask you tonight
[1:02:46] my brother and sister was there
[1:02:47] lightning was there thunder was the
[1:02:49] writing on the wall that caused daniel
[1:02:52] to open the shutters
[1:02:55] and just do
[1:02:56] what he always did
[1:02:59] no
[1:03:00] he had
[1:03:01] to pray
[1:03:03] he had to express who he was
[1:03:07] and i can see daniel the world would
[1:03:09] have expected him to be clawing at the
[1:03:11] at the rocks the stones and don't throw
[1:03:14] me in there no i don't want to die don't
[1:03:16] do this
[1:03:17] and how it must have disturbed even the
[1:03:19] guards
[1:03:21] when a man yes in his heart would have
[1:03:23] trepidation i'm about to be thrown in a
[1:03:25] den with very hungry lions
[1:03:28] but he didn't cry he didn't weep he
[1:03:30] didn't scream he didn't compromise make
[1:03:32] a plea agreement
[1:03:34] why
[1:03:36] if this is how i'm supposed to go
[1:03:38] praise the lord
[1:03:40] and if god wants me to live
[1:03:43] i'll live
[1:03:45] it's very simple in that sense my
[1:03:47] brother and sister but it's the flesh
[1:03:50] that is holding us back from these
[1:03:51] things it's the flesh sometimes keeps us
[1:03:54] from worshiping god like our heart
[1:03:56] really is crying out to and so we are
[1:03:59] then
[1:03:59] caught in this this realm of the flesh
[1:04:02] because the flesh
[1:04:04] is satan's tool
[1:04:06] to keep us
[1:04:08] from taking the key
[1:04:10] and applying the key
[1:04:12] hey oh my
[1:04:15] because nothing stopped them oh how
[1:04:16] glorious
[1:04:18] amen
[1:04:22] now let me find where i'm at
[1:04:27] now
[1:04:28] this is something
[1:04:30] that happened to me today i
[1:04:33] never have really liked packing a bunch
[1:04:35] of keys but it's become necessary in my
[1:04:37] life and today the day is finished
[1:04:41] i'm going over
[1:04:42] and it's my habit i went to the office
[1:04:46] and the door was unlocked so i reached
[1:04:48] in i turned the little click on the knob
[1:04:50] i closed the door i reached in my pocket
[1:04:52] i glance down
[1:04:54] and there is the key for the door of the
[1:04:57] office same key
[1:04:59] uh and and the same brand of lock
[1:05:02] as the shop is
[1:05:05] and i thought i grabbed the right key
[1:05:06] and i reached out and i slid a key into
[1:05:09] the lock but it wouldn't turn
[1:05:11] and i looked down
[1:05:13] and it was a key
[1:05:15] to an entirely different building an
[1:05:17] entirely different brand of lock
[1:05:21] but it slid in there
[1:05:23] oh i hope you guys are with me tonight
[1:05:25] i'm not being critical i want to make a
[1:05:26] point
[1:05:28] i believe the message
[1:05:31] and it slid right in there
[1:05:36] but i want you
[1:05:37] to unlock the promises
[1:05:40] i don't want you to say praise the lord
[1:05:43] my key fits i've got a key to the lock
[1:05:48] no i want you to unlock
[1:05:50] the promise
[1:05:52] let's make sure we haven't settled for a
[1:05:54] key
[1:05:55] that fits
[1:05:56] but doesn't do anything
[1:06:02] i hope i hope that resonates with you
[1:06:05] it's not enough to say we have this
[1:06:08] message it's not enough to say i have
[1:06:10] this i have this my brother and sister
[1:06:12] there's promises of god that have been
[1:06:14] given to you and i and the key is right
[1:06:18] here not to have us boast that he fits
[1:06:22] in the lock but i want by the grace of
[1:06:25] god if there's needs in our lives needs
[1:06:27] in our children our marriages our own
[1:06:29] self to have a key that i can put in
[1:06:31] there and unlock that promise that i
[1:06:34] need
[1:06:38] see because they held the key in their
[1:06:39] hand that great faith they done things
[1:06:42] for god because nothing will stop them
[1:06:45] and when we recognize by experience that
[1:06:48] the key that i have in my hand fits the
[1:06:51] lock as it were of this promise of god
[1:06:54] amen as for me and my house
[1:06:58] oh my brother and sister not hoping not
[1:07:00] there in desperation jiggling the lock
[1:07:03] hoping it will work
[1:07:05] but a key with confidence we can insert
[1:07:07] into the lock and turn it
[1:07:10] hallelujah now i want you to catch this
[1:07:12] because it will become here in just a
[1:07:14] moment but look at this remember
[1:07:17] the key
[1:07:19] that unlocks
[1:07:22] also locks
[1:07:25] wherever you lose
[1:07:27] in my name
[1:07:29] amen and whatever you bind in my name so
[1:07:32] that same key we don't have to go find
[1:07:34] another key and say well you know
[1:07:36] there's certain things happening within
[1:07:37] the family within the church within
[1:07:39] whatever and the lord i want to bind
[1:07:41] this now i've got to find a key so i can
[1:07:42] make no it's same key
[1:07:44] same key hallelujah
[1:07:46] amen
[1:07:47] so i was a little amazed today to
[1:07:49] realize that the key to the green shop
[1:07:52] will fit in the office door which means
[1:07:54] it will fit in our other shop door but
[1:07:57] not even the same brand of lock
[1:07:59] probably the truth is they're all owned
[1:08:01] by the same company or something
[1:08:03] but it struck me because here i already
[1:08:05] have this on my heart to do this and i
[1:08:08] i'm serious i stopped and i said thank
[1:08:10] you lord this was not just a a you know
[1:08:13] hey this is how it might be but it
[1:08:15] struck home to me that this is entirely
[1:08:18] different shape it seemed
[1:08:21] but have you ever noticed my brother and
[1:08:23] sister brother i was talking about the
[1:08:24] pins and every pen has to be in its
[1:08:26] right place to unlock
[1:08:29] you realize
[1:08:30] all
[1:08:32] the valleys
[1:08:35] have to be there too
[1:08:38] so it's not just the high points
[1:08:40] it's the valleys
[1:08:42] and it's everything we've gone in fact
[1:08:44] you might say it's the very character of
[1:08:47] the key
[1:08:48] that's needed to unlock the things into
[1:08:51] our life
[1:08:52] and the key that worked for my life i
[1:08:54] hope you catch this now the key to work
[1:08:56] for my life won't work for you
[1:08:59] it won't work for you
[1:09:00] you've got to have your own key
[1:09:03] we can't just put a a basket or a bucket
[1:09:05] or something full of faith in the back
[1:09:07] of the church we've got to possess this
[1:09:09] ourself
[1:09:10] we've got to take a hold of this and i
[1:09:12] think sometimes now i don't mean to be
[1:09:14] critical but i think sometimes we have
[1:09:16] given our young people growing up in the
[1:09:19] message such a disadvantage because
[1:09:21] we've injected into their thinking into
[1:09:23] their minds then i was born i was raised
[1:09:25] in a message family in a message church
[1:09:28] and therefore all is well my brother and
[1:09:30] sister they're going to have their key
[1:09:32] you can't have another key they gotta
[1:09:34] have their key
[1:09:38] oh my
[1:09:40] now look i gotta keep going on i just
[1:09:42] was got so much here sorry smorgasbord
[1:09:46] tonight
[1:09:47] like the
[1:09:48] time now this all just struck my heart
[1:09:49] and that's why you'll find this all
[1:09:51] together it's one great big long quote
[1:09:53] and uh sorry i'm doing that and i just
[1:09:55] about didn't and uh but i'm doing it
[1:09:57] like a man one time that come up to an
[1:09:59] old brother that was a godly old man o
[1:10:02] prophet of god and he heard that man
[1:10:03] constantly testify constantly telling
[1:10:06] about the goodness of god and how that
[1:10:08] god was and what christ was and just
[1:10:10] going ahead speaking finally this young
[1:10:12] man was going to be ordained in the
[1:10:13] ministry so he come up to this certain
[1:10:16] old sage and he said to him sir
[1:10:18] i want to ask you a question
[1:10:20] and he said ask on young man he said
[1:10:23] does christ literally
[1:10:26] now i want you to catch this in the
[1:10:28] wrong context it would be like he's
[1:10:30] questioning him
[1:10:31] negatively you know
[1:10:33] but this young man something had stirred
[1:10:35] his heart so much he says does christ
[1:10:38] literally
[1:10:39] mean as much as you say it does
[1:10:45] i'm going to share something that's
[1:10:46] going to come across
[1:10:48] so wrong
[1:10:50] [Music]
[1:10:52] i hope you don't mind
[1:10:54] we were talking
[1:10:57] to a very sweet
[1:11:00] very pretty very sweet young lady
[1:11:04] i put the next day after the wedding
[1:11:07] and i got talking to her and i kind of
[1:11:09] steered the
[1:11:11] the topic or whatever to things of god
[1:11:16] this young lady was dressed in such a
[1:11:18] fashion
[1:11:19] i basically spent most of my time
[1:11:21] looking over was it would have been her
[1:11:23] left shoulder at the wall
[1:11:29] and it made my heart ache i didn't feel
[1:11:30] it was a time or place to change
[1:11:32] something but the way she was dressed
[1:11:34] was just atrocious
[1:11:36] and she looked at me
[1:11:38] and said yes it bothers me so much in
[1:11:40] the university
[1:11:42] because
[1:11:43] talking about christianity
[1:11:47] people say one thing
[1:11:50] and say what they believe
[1:11:52] and do something
[1:11:54] entirely
[1:11:56] different
[1:11:58] i'm telling you saints my heart broke i
[1:12:00] so wanted to say look can we grab a
[1:12:02] bible right now
[1:12:04] can i show you the way you're dressed
[1:12:06] right now and all of
[1:12:09] but you see sometimes the atmosphere's
[1:12:11] not right you can't do that my heart
[1:12:14] literally broke
[1:12:16] because this girl jumped into
[1:12:18] a child's
[1:12:20] spandex
[1:12:25] i think that'll be the kindest way i can
[1:12:26] put it right there
[1:12:28] and she was a
[1:12:30] mature young woman
[1:12:32] and yet see the spirit of the day
[1:12:36] is
[1:12:38] people say they're christians
[1:12:41] but really they're not
[1:12:43] and my heart broke right there
[1:12:46] because i was like can't you see
[1:12:49] can't you see
[1:12:50] but this is satan's camouflage
[1:12:53] this is what satan has done she she does
[1:12:56] her very best
[1:12:59] to live all the ordinances of the bible
[1:13:03] but missing those deals why
[1:13:06] because there's a key
[1:13:08] sisters i give you a compliment tonight
[1:13:10] young ladies
[1:13:12] i'll give you a compliment tonight
[1:13:15] it takes a key
[1:13:18] to be modest and holy
[1:13:21] and live it from the heart
[1:13:23] before the lord it don't just happen
[1:13:28] that's why you can cro close line
[1:13:30] religion preach it in the church oh
[1:13:32] don't dress like this don't do that you
[1:13:34] know people would be like well i know he
[1:13:36] was talking to her because this and he
[1:13:38] was talking to her because of this
[1:13:41] it won't work
[1:13:42] if there's no key
[1:13:46] it's got to be a key that unlocks that
[1:13:48] and when the key is unlocked it doesn't
[1:13:50] matter what the world says and how they
[1:13:52] ridicule or whatever you say no i've got
[1:13:54] a key i've got a revelation god himself
[1:13:57] after all
[1:13:59] i'm his
[1:14:01] amen
[1:14:03] he says i ask on let's see
[1:14:06] uh
[1:14:08] he means more to me than what i could
[1:14:11] ever have breath to speak there you are
[1:14:13] what was it he had found the key that
[1:14:15] young man said upon that if you claim
[1:14:18] these things and you say to me that
[1:14:19] they're as real as you then i want to
[1:14:22] know that same jesus
[1:14:24] in the same reality
[1:14:26] see that man's life it wasn't a preacher
[1:14:29] getting up you have to do this mark this
[1:14:31] do this follow this it was so real to
[1:14:34] him and when he spoke my brother and
[1:14:36] sister he was testifying of what he
[1:14:40] found after the key had unlocked the
[1:14:42] door
[1:14:45] what was it he know the old man had a
[1:14:47] hold of a key that he could unlock and
[1:14:50] could
[1:14:51] lock up
[1:14:52] oh hallelujah
[1:14:54] you know a key that locks unlocks two
[1:14:57] see
[1:14:58] you can loosen or bind that's right the
[1:15:00] same key that locks unlocks the key that
[1:15:02] unlocks can lock up that's exactly c
[1:15:05] because it works both ways how pitiful
[1:15:08] it is that the church has ever lost its
[1:15:10] vision of that what a sad thing it was
[1:15:13] when the church sold itself out to
[1:15:15] creeds as we've done today and now
[1:15:18] called to unite we've seen
[1:15:20] where the great roman hierarchy and then
[1:15:22] was going to meet now and they're going
[1:15:25] to change some programs i thought they
[1:15:27] didn't change
[1:15:29] but they're going to anyhow
[1:15:32] now i want to insert this my brother and
[1:15:33] sister if jesus christ
[1:15:36] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:15:40] and that is revelation to us that is
[1:15:42] true
[1:15:43] mind of christ
[1:15:45] wisdom or revelation to us
[1:15:48] do you realize what we're saying when we
[1:15:50] say that
[1:15:52] this gospel
[1:15:53] that we believe
[1:15:55] can't change
[1:15:58] it cannot be molded to our culture
[1:16:01] and i'm going to say something direct
[1:16:02] because there's little things that
[1:16:04] filter around and i i'm not talking
[1:16:05] about people i hope you guys never think
[1:16:08] that i'm here beating on a person but
[1:16:10] i'm telling you my brother and sister i
[1:16:11] was called of almighty god to guard the
[1:16:14] door as it were of the sheep code and
[1:16:16] i'm not going to stand by while spirits
[1:16:18] come and go and people say and leave
[1:16:21] little hints and little words here and
[1:16:23] little subtle things there my brother
[1:16:25] and sister when you have people that
[1:16:27] have now not subtly but brazenly come to
[1:16:31] the place that they will promote to you
[1:16:34] things that were told to them and does
[1:16:37] not line up to the word and they
[1:16:39] brazenly promote that
[1:16:42] under the guise
[1:16:43] of he
[1:16:44] was with the prophet
[1:16:49] come on
[1:16:51] the prophet said
[1:16:53] now are we going to take what somebody
[1:16:54] says the prophet said or are we going to
[1:16:56] take what the prophet said
[1:16:58] see there's the real ground and there's
[1:17:01] the subtle side of it right because
[1:17:02] satan gets part of it here and so we
[1:17:05] have people taking and embracing certain
[1:17:08] things in the message i won't go into it
[1:17:10] tonight but they embrace certain things
[1:17:12] in the message that there is in one case
[1:17:15] a hundred and nine quotes
[1:17:20] where the prophet says differently
[1:17:23] but they are embracing
[1:17:25] an influence
[1:17:30] now you wonder why i get all wound up
[1:17:31] sometimes why i don't get wound up
[1:17:33] because i'm angry i get wound up because
[1:17:35] i'm almost in distress
[1:17:37] lord don't let these spirits spread
[1:17:39] don't let this take root don't let this
[1:17:41] become a normal
[1:17:44] because otherwise
[1:17:46] we don't really believe the message
[1:17:47] because the message will be the same
[1:17:49] yesterday today and forever prophet of
[1:17:52] god said this fell down as it were into
[1:17:54] the church on the day of pentecost we
[1:17:56] cannot unwind history go back and
[1:17:58] rewrite pentecost
[1:18:03] but it's promoted and it's accepted and
[1:18:06] it's amended
[1:18:08] and it splits churches
[1:18:14] oh that was all right
[1:18:23] hey man let's just keep going here
[1:18:26] that's where they left the key right
[1:18:28] there that's the reason the great
[1:18:29] miracle and signs are not done amongst
[1:18:31] the people today that they used to be
[1:18:33] they've lost the key yeah they know the
[1:18:35] door
[1:18:36] they know the door is there
[1:18:38] but the next thing is the key to open
[1:18:40] the door
[1:18:41] the treasures
[1:18:43] is behind
[1:18:44] the door
[1:18:46] once again i want to reiterate not just
[1:18:48] the fact that we have a key that will
[1:18:50] slide into the lock
[1:18:52] we've got to get beyond the door
[1:18:56] they're locked up out of sight from the
[1:18:58] unbeliever
[1:18:59] but the believer who has faith and can
[1:19:01] take the key of faith can unlock these
[1:19:03] doors yes sir one time here a few years
[1:19:06] ago i hope you guys enjoy this part this
[1:19:08] is not really part of my sermon but once
[1:19:09] i read it i just thought i have to share
[1:19:11] this
[1:19:12] one time here a few years ago there was
[1:19:14] a missionary brother and he felt he had
[1:19:15] a call to africa he was a young fellow
[1:19:18] wife and two children very pretty
[1:19:20] the young girls about seven eight years
[1:19:22] old a piece and this young fellow
[1:19:24] couldn't get away from it he was a
[1:19:26] minister he had a nice church in the
[1:19:27] country but he just couldn't get away
[1:19:29] from that call must go to africa and he
[1:19:32] prayed day and night
[1:19:35] he didn't want to go
[1:19:38] but god kept speaking to him you must go
[1:19:41] and finally come to a place till he a
[1:19:43] showdown where he must go so he went to
[1:19:46] the mission board of his church and he
[1:19:48] said god has called me to the mission
[1:19:50] fields way back in the jungles of
[1:19:52] rhodesia
[1:19:53] and in this jungle that's infested with
[1:19:55] malaria and fever and hot sun and
[1:19:59] plaguery or however you say that leprosy
[1:20:01] and all kinds of diseases back in this
[1:20:03] jungle
[1:20:04] uh be where he was going to make or take
[1:20:07] the rest of his life
[1:20:09] sold his home and all he had so the
[1:20:10] mission board wanted to test him and
[1:20:12] they said are you sure now and he said
[1:20:14] i'm positive they said to him sir
[1:20:17] you thought it was in this manner that
[1:20:19] you've got two pretty little girls
[1:20:22] and you've got a lovely young wife and
[1:20:24] if why don't you just go over and see
[1:20:26] how it is and then come back
[1:20:29] and he said no
[1:20:30] the lord told me oh
[1:20:33] it's so real aren't you glad you have
[1:20:35] that experience in your life that the
[1:20:37] things that god deals with you is so
[1:20:39] real it's not a vague i think i'm a
[1:20:42] christian i think i'm a son of god a
[1:20:43] daughter of god i think i'm going to
[1:20:45] serve him it's so real that we can say
[1:20:47] i'm going to
[1:20:50] it's real to me
[1:20:52] i don't want to leave my church and i
[1:20:54] don't want to leave my home i don't want
[1:20:56] to leave my church my people but the
[1:20:57] lord called me back there in that jungle
[1:20:59] and he said sir did you know your little
[1:21:01] girls could take yellow fever or black
[1:21:03] water fever and die overnight and to
[1:21:05] refer to different people that had lost
[1:21:07] their children the little fellows to
[1:21:09] take them back in there on diseases that
[1:21:11] they had no inoculation for
[1:21:14] and said think of leprosy of your pretty
[1:21:16] wife and your two little girls with
[1:21:18] leprosy and that hot sun and things that
[1:21:20] you've got to put up with said aren't
[1:21:22] you afraid in the danger of taking your
[1:21:24] children and wife in such a place
[1:21:29] i don't know maybe i'm just really off
[1:21:31] the rocker but my brother and sister we
[1:21:33] live in a world
[1:21:34] that right now we
[1:21:36] are beset by supposedly the world's most
[1:21:38] dangerous disease
[1:21:43] it seems to me this mission board
[1:21:46] and our government were anointed by the
[1:21:48] same spirit
[1:21:51] be afraid of this what if this happens
[1:21:53] what if that happens what is this what
[1:21:55] is this let us imagine some more this is
[1:21:56] not affecting you enough
[1:22:01] i love this response i say this just
[1:22:03] because of this and the missionary stood
[1:22:05] there the young fella in tears began to
[1:22:07] run down his cheeks he turned around and
[1:22:09] said my brethren my vision of god's call
[1:22:12] if god has called me to africa
[1:22:16] if god has called me to this message
[1:22:20] my children and family is more safer in
[1:22:23] africa
[1:22:24] than any place
[1:22:26] in the world
[1:22:28] what do we have to fear we serve a god
[1:22:31] who said we are part of him
[1:22:34] and he is part of us there's no
[1:22:36] separation there should be no fear
[1:22:39] people are like oh my i heard this the
[1:22:41] other day well you know brother
[1:22:43] so-and-so you know that covet got him no
[1:22:46] my brother and sister i'm sorry clovid's
[1:22:48] not sitting just be on the ether with
[1:22:50] his brother in his hand saying i got him
[1:22:53] it's almighty god said i will use a time
[1:22:55] i will use a season i will use whatever
[1:22:58] it is but i'm calling him home and he is
[1:23:01] not there wrapped up in covet he's
[1:23:04] wrapped up in jesus christ and people oh
[1:23:07] we become afraid of this
[1:23:10] i'm sorry
[1:23:11] i'm sorry
[1:23:13] i'm going to take the stance this young
[1:23:15] man had if i am in god's will grace
[1:23:17] tabernacle if we are in god's will
[1:23:21] there's no safer place for us than in
[1:23:24] his will
[1:23:25] hallelujah
[1:23:27] oh
[1:23:28] safer there than any other place on the
[1:23:31] face of the earth he had the key
[1:23:33] that's
[1:23:34] what it takes
[1:23:37] oh my he goes right on here i gotta
[1:23:39] hurry saints
[1:23:41] when you got the key there's no fear
[1:23:44] there's no doubt there's no question
[1:23:46] you don't have to ask anybody else about
[1:23:48] it you know exactly
[1:23:50] you've got it in your hands you know
[1:23:52] what to do amen you know what the score
[1:23:54] is
[1:23:55] you know the door is going to unlock
[1:23:57] you've checked the levers and you know
[1:23:59] it's strictly the right thing the door
[1:24:00] is going to fly open when you throw the
[1:24:03] key in it oh
[1:24:05] if the church
[1:24:07] only possessed the keys
[1:24:09] if the church only possessed the key of
[1:24:11] faith we could unlock any door
[1:24:14] any sickness any plague any case that
[1:24:17] there is it could be unlocked to us if
[1:24:19] we could only possess this key
[1:24:23] the man this man
[1:24:25] has had the key to his calling
[1:24:28] hallelujah i hope i've made a little
[1:24:30] sense to you tonight i'm just going to
[1:24:31] kind of move on here i have one last
[1:24:34] little quote i want to
[1:24:37] put up here
[1:24:38] amen now i had
[1:24:40] brother alex post the
[1:24:42] whole thing but
[1:24:45] really kind of starting right in here is
[1:24:47] more of the thought but dear god we
[1:24:49] thank thee tonight
[1:24:50] first for jesus christ our savior we
[1:24:53] thank thee because that he is the same
[1:24:56] yesterday today and forever we thank
[1:24:58] thee for people
[1:25:00] who believe that
[1:25:01] we're so glad that we have a god
[1:25:04] not just an imaginary god
[1:25:08] an imaginary
[1:25:10] idol an imaginary spirit
[1:25:14] there's nothing
[1:25:16] imaginary about it
[1:25:18] a true and living god
[1:25:21] who lives with us
[1:25:24] and in us and works
[1:25:27] through us
[1:25:31] why does this mean so much to you
[1:25:32] brother paul
[1:25:34] because i'm hearing the verbiage of
[1:25:36] people
[1:25:38] who are almost like saying
[1:25:40] the bible's an allegory
[1:25:43] they're
[1:25:44] oh i forgot to tell you yes they believe
[1:25:47] god sent a prophet
[1:25:51] but there are certain things they can't
[1:25:53] help themselves but voice
[1:25:56] that really tells me and i'm not trying
[1:25:58] to be critical saints but it tells me
[1:26:00] that somehow or another some of this
[1:26:03] has become imaginary
[1:26:06] not a reality to them
[1:26:09] the reality
[1:26:11] that we have
[1:26:13] should be
[1:26:15] in the spiritual sense right to discern
[1:26:17] the spiritual things you have to be
[1:26:18] spiritual that literally my brother and
[1:26:20] sister this probably starts some kind of
[1:26:22] firestorm but you need to believe god is
[1:26:25] in you so strongly that if you pricked
[1:26:27] your finger and the blood come out that
[1:26:28] that would be the blood of jesus christ
[1:26:31] not not some well that's my blood and
[1:26:34] i'm part of god and god's part of me and
[1:26:36] i'm his and i'm trying to separate this
[1:26:39] i'm drawing this line here that keeps a
[1:26:41] distance as it were between me because
[1:26:43] i'm just human and god
[1:26:46] know my brother and sister we should be
[1:26:47] so sold out
[1:26:49] that we know that every part and parcel
[1:26:51] of our being is god's and he's the one
[1:26:54] who said i'll take care of you that
[1:26:55] young man we just read that quote he had
[1:26:57] the revelation if i'm in the will of god
[1:27:00] i'm doing what god wants i've got no
[1:27:02] safer place
[1:27:07] we're so glad that we have a god not
[1:27:08] just an imaginary god an imaginary idol
[1:27:11] imaginary spirit there's nothing
[1:27:12] imaginary about it a true and living god
[1:27:14] who lives with us
[1:27:18] you know if we're talking about in the
[1:27:20] world of moral decorum
[1:27:23] when a man and a woman
[1:27:24] live together they're married
[1:27:28] he's living with us
[1:27:30] amen are you with me
[1:27:33] we're we're living together
[1:27:36] amen we're not living as fornicators or
[1:27:39] adulterers or anything else we're living
[1:27:41] with our husband
[1:27:43] amen
[1:27:45] he lives with us and in us
[1:27:47] and works through us not making a statue
[1:27:50] to god but we being living images
[1:27:55] look how real this is we got to get god
[1:27:57] out of the ether land he's not out there
[1:27:59] behind the eagle nebula somewhere in
[1:28:01] another galaxy he's right here dwelling
[1:28:04] in our midst because he's in us
[1:28:08] not making a statue to god but we being
[1:28:10] living images of god the holy spirit not
[1:28:13] speaking through a statue but speaking
[1:28:16] through a redeemed vessel
[1:28:19] god manifested in flesh
[1:28:23] how we thank thee for this the great
[1:28:25] pillar of fire following us or we
[1:28:27] following it rather for all the great
[1:28:29] manifestations of the same spirit doing
[1:28:32] the same work that it's always done when
[1:28:34] it come to earth what a consolation
[1:28:37] it gives us
[1:28:38] hallelujah amen brother alex if you just
[1:28:41] come
[1:28:42] praise the lord brother chris i'm doing
[1:28:44] better it's only two minutes till nine
[1:28:47] hallelujah
[1:28:49] hallelujah saints i just trust tonight
[1:28:51] there's something that you glean from
[1:28:53] this tonight to realize god's given us
[1:28:56] the key
[1:28:57] we don't have to sit back and say woe
[1:28:58] unto me he's given us the key
[1:29:03] now
[1:29:04] let's unlock some doors
[1:29:06] amen only you know
[1:29:09] you know i had brother he's a pastor he
[1:29:10] thinks maybe i'm too hands off maybe he
[1:29:12] thinks i should be coming in peeking
[1:29:14] over your back fence would that creep
[1:29:16] you out as brother paul showed up at
[1:29:17] your house you look out there he's
[1:29:20] looking
[1:29:23] but you know what i have confidence in
[1:29:24] you
[1:29:26] have confidence you've caught the
[1:29:27] revelation that god answers your prayers
[1:29:30] god hears your cry
[1:29:33] amen god wants you
[1:29:36] amen
[1:29:37] take the key

[1:29:44] god's given you the authorities giving
[1:29:46] you the power saints let's start putting
[1:29:48] it in i want you to pick you know i've
[1:29:50] kind of half-heartedly i hate to admit
[1:29:52] that but tell the truth i half-heartedly
[1:29:54] follow dave ramsey
[1:29:56] you know the money guy
[1:29:58] [Music]
[1:30:00] don't go out here saints
[1:30:02] please hear me out
[1:30:04] don't go out here and tackle the biggest
[1:30:06] issue in your life
[1:30:08] and say now i'm going to prove god
[1:30:10] one way or the other
[1:30:11] [Music]
[1:30:13] don't do that
[1:30:14] you'll get discouraged before you run
[1:30:16] out of problems
[1:30:17] [Music]
[1:30:19] but i want you to stop and
[1:30:21] maybe there's just a little something
[1:30:22] that's besetting in your life
[1:30:25] i want you to just take that key
[1:30:27] and i want you to put it in there and i
[1:30:29] want you to unlock it
[1:30:31] and then remember what the prophet said
[1:30:33] what it unlocks it will also lock
[1:30:36] so take those littlest things
[1:30:41] and bind them in the name of jesus
[1:30:42] christ
[1:30:44] you know what will happen
[1:30:45] is it starts to move in your life and
[1:30:47] you see god actually answering
[1:30:50] now don't just sit back and expect a
[1:30:52] postcard and god say i i did this for
[1:30:54] you
[1:30:55] amen you've got to be there
[1:30:58] to be moved by that very gentle nudging
[1:31:01] that very gentle moving of the holy
[1:31:03] spirit
[1:31:05] and then take the key
[1:31:07] and move on to the very next thing in
[1:31:08] your life
[1:31:10] and unlock it or lock it
[1:31:12] and just keep doing that
[1:31:14] until as dave ramsey promotes in his
[1:31:16] program you'll wake up one morning
[1:31:19] debt-free
[1:31:21] well i'll tell you my brother and sister
[1:31:22] you say well brother paul
[1:31:24] we are debt-free our sins are forgiven
[1:31:26] that's right but some of you still have
[1:31:28] a temper
[1:31:29] and some of you still have little petty
[1:31:31] things in your life and some of you
[1:31:33] easily offended and some of you are easy
[1:31:35] to offend others and all these things
[1:31:37] say i'm not preaching down to you
[1:31:40] just take the key
[1:31:42] start dealing with it
[1:31:44] you know i mean i say this a little bit
[1:31:47] humor
[1:31:48] i think the way god created men and
[1:31:51] women
[1:31:52] sometimes our wives definitely
[1:31:55] need to have a big dose of grace
[1:31:58] because they live with us
[1:32:02] but sometimes y'all not so easy either
[1:32:06] so
[1:32:06] whatever it is
[1:32:08] take the key
[1:32:10] loose it or bind it
[1:32:12] the key works
[1:32:14] and god will answer your prayer and your
[1:32:16] faith will increase
[1:32:18] and when these things come in your life
[1:32:20] my brother and sister i've lost it i had
[1:32:22] some notes one time that was shared with
[1:32:24] me with a sister went out in her
[1:32:26] backyard and her child's floating face
[1:32:29] down in the swimming pool
[1:32:32] imagine
[1:32:34] it would be just like being struck
[1:32:36] struck so hard i mean it would just be
[1:32:38] like oh my
[1:32:40] she jumps in the pool she drags her baby
[1:32:42] out gets it on the deal there she calls
[1:32:44] 911
[1:32:45] and she's there trying to remember you
[1:32:47] know it's like most of us in ninth grade
[1:32:49] or something she took a first date class
[1:32:51] and she's like oh my don't know what to
[1:32:52] do something come over and said pray
[1:32:56] she didn't do cpr she didn't do advance
[1:32:59] this or advance that
[1:33:01] she
[1:33:02] went to the throne of almighty god
[1:33:04] [Music]
[1:33:06] and when the ambulance or fire engine or
[1:33:08] rescue squad or whatever showed up
[1:33:11] she's sitting there with a living baby
[1:33:15] in her lap
[1:33:18] oh the skeptic can say well maybe he
[1:33:19] wasn't dead
[1:33:22] now
[1:33:23] the believer says
[1:33:25] god
[1:33:26] give her the key of faith
[1:33:28] and when the holy spirit nudged her and
[1:33:31] said pray for your baby
[1:33:34] god was there saying you pray
[1:33:36] i'll answer
[1:33:38] you pray and i'll perform this
[1:33:41] for you
[1:33:43] that's the kind of faith we need to have
[1:33:45] saints
[1:33:46] don't let satan rob you and say well
[1:33:48] i've got so many shortcomings of course
[1:33:50] you do
[1:33:51] you're human
[1:33:54] but just stand upon it
[1:33:56] never lose holds right the prophet of
[1:33:58] god says they lost the key
[1:34:00] let's not lose the key
[1:34:03] let's stand sing a song or two
[1:34:05] praise the lord
[1:34:07] i boasted that i was done before nine
[1:34:09] and i wasn't
[1:34:11] amen i am redeemed
[1:34:13] i've been bought with a price
[1:34:16] amen
