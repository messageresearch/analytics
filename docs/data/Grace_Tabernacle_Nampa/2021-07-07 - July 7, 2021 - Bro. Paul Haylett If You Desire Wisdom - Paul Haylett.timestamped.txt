[15:15] someone a sinner such as i
[15:17] lord but yet you have done it lord and
[15:19] the greatest battle ever fought is in

[21:56] hallelujah is it good to be here tonight
[21:59] amen you know sometimes
[22:03] i hope i'm not misunderstood here but
[22:05] sometimes
[22:07] i i just simply love coming to church
[22:11] um kind of sounds like a little selfish
[22:13] motive but it
[22:14] it's my break from the world
[22:18] out here it's my break to come into the
[22:20] presence of god with saints of like
[22:22] precious faith and just
[22:24] just block all of that out and once
[22:27] again we're
[22:28] happy to have brother peter with us and
[22:31] brother oleg god bless you amen i know
[22:34] you probably was there
[22:36] on i-5 and took a wrong turn and ended
[22:38] up here but
[22:40] you and brother pavel god bless you you
[22:43] know i i jokingly say i like
[22:45] powell so much because we share a name
[22:48] but he's a very fine young man and
[22:51] tonight brother alex has as let me know
[22:54] that there's a little
[22:55] problem with the internet so we'll have
[22:58] scriptures but we won't have quotes and
[23:00] i hope that's not
[23:01] a deterrent we'll just have a few things
[23:05] once again i want to speak to you uh
[23:07] from the book of proverbs
[23:09] i age old proverbs and and i want to
[23:12] title it tonight if you desire
[23:14] wisdom and i believe every one of us
[23:17] here tonight
[23:17] desires wisdom i know that we
[23:22] kind of make this in a broad sense
[23:24] brother person sister concha
[23:26] uh look at the sacrifice to come so far
[23:29] for communion
[23:30] uh to stay over you know have to drive
[23:34] home tomorrow i believe and
[23:36] and uh but there's just a hunger in
[23:38] god's people
[23:40] and uh we're desiring the wisdom
[23:43] and it's uh as the word says it's not
[23:45] the wisdom of this world but we're
[23:47] desiring
[23:48] god's wisdom and we're desiring god to
[23:50] deal with us and so
[23:52] as each one of us comes and uh it's just
[23:55] good to see everyone not to embarrass
[23:56] anyone but good to see sister alice here
[23:59] tonight
[23:59] uh sister alice i will embarrass you i
[24:02] love you girl and
[24:04] uh and she's just a special girl amen
[24:07] and uh turning into a young lady and
[24:10] and uh you know it's just good to see
[24:13] this you know
[24:14] each and every one i was commenting to
[24:18] sister jerry
[24:19] the other day that it's scary to see our
[24:21] young people growing up so quickly
[24:24] we have albums or or piles and piles of
[24:27] pictures that need to go in an album
[24:29] and a lot of our children just looking
[24:31] through this and here
[24:33] here is children just little
[24:36] i i i just i won't i won't get
[24:39] sentimental here or whatever but it's
[24:41] just precious when you look at that
[24:43] and now they're growing up and it's good
[24:45] to see them worshiping the lord
[24:47] let's just stand and turn in our bibles
[24:50] to
[24:51] uh the book of proverbs the second
[24:54] chapter
[24:55] now if you go back into one of our
[24:57] earlier uh um
[25:00] wednesdays out of the book of proverbs
[25:02] this will
[25:03] be scriptures that we have already read
[25:06] but i want to tie together this thought
[25:08] about wisdom
[25:09] so we'll turn in proverbs the second
[25:12] chapter verses one through three
[25:14] the scripture says my son if thou wilt
[25:18] receive my words
[25:20] now that my brother and sister is the
[25:22] challenge of our day
[25:25] is for people to be able to receive
[25:29] the word of god to receive what is
[25:31] spoken
[25:32] it's easy enough to claim or say i'm a
[25:34] christian
[25:35] it's easy enough to say i belong to this
[25:37] church
[25:38] but it's easy enough my brother and
[25:40] sister to
[25:41] vocalize it but we have
[25:45] to receive it and to receive that
[25:48] is not just to acknowledge it exists or
[25:52] acknowledge that there is a general
[25:53] acceptance of it
[25:55] but to receive that you must
[25:58] take that in
[26:01] and there's where the difficulty lies
[26:04] if thou will receive my words and hide
[26:07] my commandments
[26:08] with thee so that thou incline thy ear
[26:12] unto wisdom and apply thine heart to
[26:16] understanding
[26:17] yea if thou criest after knowledge
[26:20] and lift us up thy voice for
[26:23] understanding
[26:24] heavenly father we ask you to come this
[26:26] evening
[26:27] lord for those who are not with us
[26:29] tonight lord we just send your holy
[26:31] spirit to be with them
[26:33] lead guide strengthen comfort lord
[26:36] and father we ask you to speak to us
[26:38] tonight
[26:39] here father as we have come together
[26:41] lord just to
[26:43] rally around the word of god not around
[26:45] man
[26:46] not around a building but you lord is
[26:48] why we have come
[26:50] asking you to speak to us in the name of
[26:52] jesus christ
[26:53] amen you may be seated so as we would
[26:57] look at this my brother and sister i
[26:58] want to focus for just a moment
[27:01] on verse 3 there if thou criest
[27:04] after knowledge and lift us up thy voice
[27:08] for understanding these are not simple
[27:10] you know when the prophet of god said
[27:12] that we should pray for revelation my
[27:14] brother and sister i believe
[27:16] um now if i if i'm not speaking in the
[27:19] right context
[27:20] forgive me but i believe we don't put
[27:22] enough emphasis on that we would maybe
[27:24] in our prayer sometime oh lord give me
[27:27] some revelation
[27:28] but the scripture here out of the book
[27:30] of proverbs says
[27:31] that we should be crying after knowledge
[27:35] we
[27:35] should be crying for understanding and
[27:38] we
[27:38] look at this as we there's there's too
[27:40] much to cover this tonight but
[27:42] uh look at this and realize that the
[27:45] wisdom and how it is
[27:47] my brother and sister it's not just a
[27:48] simple little
[27:50] passing prayer of lord give me wisdom in
[27:52] this situation or
[27:54] or give me you know some revelation over
[27:56] here
[27:57] but it is something that should be a
[27:59] heart's cry it should be
[28:01] something that is coming from deep
[28:03] within us
[28:04] to desire to know because my brother and
[28:07] sister when we
[28:08] can make this connection and i pray i'm
[28:11] not trying to oversimplify it i don't
[28:13] want to
[28:13] make it sound like it's some really deep
[28:15] thing but when we can make the
[28:17] connection
[28:18] of knowing the mystery of god is
[28:21] directly connected to
[28:23] crying out for knowledge and wisdom and
[28:26] revelation
[28:27] because there you're telling god i want
[28:30] to know you
[28:31] now my brother and sister we can live
[28:32] what they call the superficial parallel
[28:35] life
[28:35] and many people do that you'll see this
[28:38] now sorry to bring this in a negative
[28:40] context
[28:40] but you'll see that sometimes when a
[28:42] marriage has failed or faltered
[28:44] that people will choose for the sake of
[28:46] the children or sake of the family name
[28:48] or reputation
[28:50] they will live parallel lives it is not
[28:53] a life that is connected
[28:54] it is not a life that is intertwined it
[28:56] is not a life that has a degree of
[28:58] intimacy
[28:59] but they are existing in the same house
[29:02] and
[29:03] existing under these conditions but not
[29:06] connected and i'm afraid sometimes my
[29:08] brother and sister
[29:09] people are living in this house in a
[29:11] parallel life
[29:12] without the intimacy of the word in
[29:15] their life
[29:15] and and it's there that we must get
[29:17] beyond this the simply
[29:19] a spirit of the day that we live in that
[29:22] i belong to the message our grace
[29:24] tabernacle is our home
[29:25] church that is it's not about that my
[29:28] brother and sister
[29:28] it is all about jesus christ the reason
[29:32] we live as it were in this house
[29:35] is him amen not not to come and be
[29:38] identified my brother and sister
[29:41] you know and i don't say that everyone
[29:43] who might use these words would fall
[29:45] into this category
[29:46] but often times uh i in the years gone
[29:49] by i've heard people
[29:50] say things like well i've been following
[29:53] the
[29:54] message for 40 years well my brother and
[29:56] sister they followed it for 40 years in
[29:58] the wilderness and they're still there
[30:05] come on i don't want to be a follower
[30:09] i want to be this message i want to be
[30:12] so close the mirror image of jesus
[30:14] christ
[30:15] that people would say you know what i
[30:17] see you now don't get the idea that
[30:19] we're going to suddenly wake up and
[30:20] we're this perfect image and never makes
[30:22] a mistake and never does this
[30:23] but people can see christ in you
[30:27] my brother and sister they can literally
[30:29] see christ in you
[30:32] sometimes you do business as it were
[30:34] maybe very simple in context
[30:36] and people will say things like what's
[30:39] different about you
[30:41] well i'm a extraordinary individual
[30:46] i'm very i'm very let me
[30:49] but am i very you see we don't find much
[30:53] in ourself
[30:54] to boast about we don't find
[30:57] much in ourself to say the reason that
[30:59] i'm different than this world
[31:01] is because i'm this this this and this
[31:05] the reason we're different than this
[31:07] world
[31:08] is jesus christ and christ alone
[31:12] isn't it beautiful and i'm not ashamed
[31:14] to say there's nothing extraordinary
[31:16] about me
[31:16] i'm not ashamed to say that without him
[31:19] i would probably be a complete failure
[31:21] i'm not ashamed to say
[31:22] that i want to be like him and i want to
[31:25] be different
[31:26] than laodicea there's nothing of
[31:28] laodicea out here my brother and sister
[31:30] that is so appealing amen now you look
[31:34] at this so i i just want to encourage
[31:36] you and i'm encouraging myself tonight
[31:38] i want to encourage you that we should
[31:41] get more serious about
[31:42] crying after knowledge and crying out
[31:45] for understanding
[31:46] which we're desiring as the prophet said
[31:49] to pray for revelation
[31:50] it shouldn't be superficial lord if
[31:52] you've got nothing else to give me give
[31:54] me a little revelation
[31:55] it ought to be something that becomes a
[31:57] benchmark of our prayer life
[32:00] to to reach out and say lord i want to
[32:03] know you
[32:04] because this my brother and sister is
[32:05] the revelation of the mystery
[32:07] which is christ in you and i and and we
[32:09] can't uh we can
[32:11] well we could oversimplify i guess
[32:15] could we oversimplify christ in us
[32:20] how could we how could we oversimplify
[32:24] christ in us we could sum it up by
[32:28] simply saying christ in me
[32:31] christ in me that's it there's there's
[32:33] no other quantifiers i don't need to
[32:34] have
[32:35] christ and my 401k christ in my
[32:37] investments christ in my real estate
[32:39] christ in my education he says there's
[32:42] nothing we can add to this
[32:45] it's christ in you the hope of glory
[32:48] there's what makes that benchmark
[32:50] difference in our life that
[32:51] sets us apart from the world that we
[32:53] live in and you know my brother and
[32:55] sister
[32:56] i um it wasn't an influence in this
[32:58] service tonight but i
[33:00] was watching a little clip and and you
[33:02] know it's really sad because they're
[33:04] interviewing young people in some of the
[33:06] uh very preeminent universities of the
[33:09] united
[33:10] states and these are uh you know not
[33:13] freshmen fresh out of high school these
[33:15] are
[33:15] are people who are graduating with very
[33:17] high degrees and different things and
[33:19] and uh it was heartbreaking to to
[33:22] uh listen to their response because you
[33:26] see
[33:26] they have been robotically ch uh trained
[33:31] they have answers to questions
[33:36] but the questions come from a box or a
[33:38] can
[33:42] you know there's
[33:45] different names that they've used in
[33:47] different times and places
[33:51] but there's a a young man a minister has
[33:54] went to college campuses and he's
[33:56] went amongst these students he himself i
[33:59] believe has a master's in something or
[34:01] other
[34:02] and he got saved imagine that
[34:08] and it's interesting because he asked
[34:10] these fellow students you know
[34:13] where are you going to go when you die
[34:18] oh don't tell us that stuff we know
[34:21] where you're going
[34:22] but there is no god that is what i ask
[34:24] you
[34:26] i didn't ask you whether god exists or
[34:27] not i ask you where
[34:29] are you going to go and they get nervous
[34:33] they start wringing their hands and they
[34:34] don't want to talk about it
[34:36] but you see my brother and sister isn't
[34:38] that one of the beautiful things about
[34:39] the gospel
[34:40] is it comes and it starts out with us
[34:43] having a very
[34:44] vague understanding of where we're going
[34:47] to go when we
[34:48] pass from this life and as time goes of
[34:50] the opening of the word
[34:52] our confidence is not a confidence in an
[34:54] intellectual understanding that there's
[34:56] heaven and hell
[34:57] it is not an intellectual understanding
[34:59] of the
[35:00] diagram of all of the universe and
[35:03] creation
[35:04] but it's a confidence that comes because
[35:06] this relationship is growing
[35:09] and we now have a confidence of who we
[35:12] are
[35:14] and where we stand and what it's all
[35:16] about
[35:17] do you realize how much of a mystery
[35:19] that is my brother and sister
[35:21] that is not just some simple thing oh
[35:23] yeah we go to heaven
[35:24] no my brother and sister the real
[35:26] reality as they were praying over the
[35:28] prayer here and stuff and it struck
[35:30] me and these words have struck me you
[35:32] see the prophet of god says when
[35:34] she knows who she is i'm paraphrasing it
[35:36] when she knows who she
[35:37] is she'll become an invincible army and
[35:40] that's what god's doing see
[35:42] he's giving us knowledge my brother and
[35:44] sister it's not
[35:46] textbook knowledge it's soul knowledge
[35:48] it is knowledge down in the depths of
[35:50] who we are
[35:51] he's giving us knowledge of who we
[35:54] are how precious is that that
[35:58] we're not just sitting here saying i'm a
[35:59] message believer or i'm a christian
[36:01] but this knowledge coming down is being
[36:03] poured into
[36:05] us and we then are stabilized by this
[36:08] knowledge and wisdom that has come from
[36:11] the revelation of the word
[36:12] now i don't know maybe you guys don't go
[36:14] through struggles maybe you don't have
[36:16] trials
[36:17] maybe problems don't come your way but
[36:19] to those of you that do
[36:21] isn't it wonderful to know that we are
[36:24] then
[36:24] stabilized by it's not this book
[36:27] knowledge not a carnal knowledge
[36:29] but a knowledge in the soul of who i am
[36:33] and we can then stand on that and be
[36:36] able to say you know what yes i i made
[36:37] mistakes or
[36:38] i had bad thoughts or or something come
[36:41] along
[36:42] but you know what i know who i am and
[36:45] and
[36:45] thank you lord for this stabilizing of
[36:48] this knowledge
[36:50] that has come for this is the revelation
[36:53] my brother and sister
[36:54] of the of the mystery of who we are in
[36:56] jesus christ
[36:58] see oftentimes if we're not careful we
[37:01] spend so much
[37:01] effort trying to validate the message
[37:06] and we forget that we are the message
[37:09] we forget the whole purpose that god
[37:11] come to reconcile the world
[37:13] to the word and the word back to the
[37:15] world that we're the reason he did that
[37:18] and
[37:18] so we're out here taking the message as
[37:20] some abstract
[37:22] and we're trying to validate it when we
[37:24] ought to just stop
[37:25] and say you know what i am the reason
[37:28] god sent a prophet
[37:29] in this day i am the reason the word has
[37:33] been
[37:33] opened up and revelated i'm the reason
[37:37] for that but you know what we all
[37:38] oh woe unto me woe and me i i make
[37:41] mistakes and i
[37:42] won't unto me but but but brother
[37:44] branham was a vindicated prophet
[37:45] okay that's good my brother sister
[37:47] you'll find that if people want to argue
[37:49] over
[37:50] his validation or vindication my brother
[37:52] and sister they're missing the whole
[37:54] point
[37:55] they are missing the whole purpose of
[37:56] the scripture they're missing the whole
[37:58] reason god did this
[37:59] because the very reason god did this a
[38:02] portion of is sitting right here tonight
[38:04] and this is the reason a revelated word
[38:07] come
[38:07] in our day to put you and i into our
[38:11] place
[38:12] that we could stand by a knowledge of
[38:14] the word not knowledge
[38:15] of intellectual meant by the knowledge
[38:18] of the word that we can stand
[38:19] because it's only in that position of
[38:21] standing that we are able to recognize
[38:24] this is where i must go and i must go
[38:27] forward
[38:30] otherwise we can go around in circles
[38:33] and
[38:33] we can struggle here and struggle there
[38:35] and question this and question that
[38:37] never gaining the full realization or
[38:40] revelation
[38:41] of what the whole thing is about
[38:48] wisdom and revelation are to be sought
[38:50] after
[38:52] my brother and sister not to wait till
[38:53] it comes now i want you to understand
[38:55] there is a fine line in this
[38:57] that we can get confused because if we
[38:59] take in a man's method
[39:01] to seek after wisdom in revelation then
[39:04] we will go
[39:05] off in an ism are you with me
[39:08] we'll go off and it is and we'll start
[39:10] taking the last one out of this quote
[39:12] something over here put a scripture in
[39:14] here come up with this and create our
[39:15] own thing
[39:16] but my brother and sister it's to be
[39:18] sought after and i validate that by the
[39:20] simple fact the prophet of god said pray
[39:22] for revelation
[39:24] first and foremost pray for revelation
[39:26] so he's laying a foundation for you and
[39:29] i
[39:29] to seek after this lord i don't have to
[39:32] just sit here now remember
[39:33] the prophet of god also told us if you
[39:35] don't understand something
[39:36] you don't just walk away from it you
[39:39] take that and set and let god answer
[39:41] that
[39:41] so sometimes we have to have patience do
[39:43] we know what patience is
[39:45] amen there are some days i think i left
[39:47] my patients at home
[39:50] and i have become the patient
[39:58] but god's grace and mercy it comes down
[40:01] does this now colossians the second
[40:04] chapter
[40:05] um we'll look at this now
[40:08] colossians 2 6-8 amen
[40:14] no okay we're good colossians 2 6-8
[40:18] as ye have
[40:22] therefore received
[40:25] christ jesus the lord now let me just
[40:28] jump back real quick
[40:30] i hope that i'm not jumping around too
[40:32] much for you
[40:33] but just a few verses ahead it says my
[40:36] son if thou will receive my words
[40:39] okay so it's putting out as it were
[40:41] we're going to say just a small question
[40:43] mark
[40:43] if thou will receive my words
[40:48] so what we're going to do is focus on
[40:50] the reception part
[40:52] the receiving of it verse 6 says as ye
[40:55] have therefore received so we went from
[40:58] the question mark
[40:59] of if you'll receive it to now speaking
[41:02] of
[41:02] we have received it
[41:06] can someone say thank you lord you no
[41:08] longer
[41:09] no longer looking out if we can receive
[41:11] this but we can stand and say thank you
[41:13] lord
[41:13] i have received the word for my hour
[41:18] that's beautiful isn't it as ye
[41:22] have therefore received christ jesus the
[41:25] lord
[41:26] so wonky in him very simple you've
[41:29] received it
[41:30] i would hope tonight that every one of
[41:32] us here and might listen to this at some
[41:33] point
[41:34] in time would be able to lift a hand and
[41:35] say i have received
[41:37] so there's our commission now you've
[41:40] received it
[41:41] start walking in it don't walk next to
[41:43] it don't walk before it walk behind it
[41:45] or be sighted
[41:46] my brother and sister walk in it amen
[41:49] don't come up with another idea of what
[41:51] i should do or what we should do
[41:53] or what the church should do or what
[41:54] brother branham should have done listen
[41:56] to a little video clip
[41:57] that a man made here recently and this
[41:59] man was talking about
[42:01] this very dynamic ministry of william
[42:03] branham and uh you know
[42:05] it just is very i thought wow this is a
[42:06] wonderful endorsement but he gets down
[42:08] to the end and says you know if he'd
[42:09] just did this
[42:10] and if he just did this and if he'd just
[42:13] did this
[42:15] his ministry would have been successful
[42:18] and i thought to myself with lettuce and
[42:20] i thought what what how does he describe
[42:22] successful
[42:23] exactly right but the word of god said
[42:26] this isn't going to be done as an open
[42:28] show it's not going to be a tbn special
[42:31] it's not going to be broadcast to the
[42:33] billboards and whatever
[42:34] the the message of the highway and byway
[42:37] my brother and sister
[42:38] is you and i we are the message to the
[42:41] highway and the byway
[42:42] we are not gonna rely on you know the
[42:45] the billboard on the freeway to do the
[42:47] work
[42:48] people drive by it yeah whatever
[42:51] another religious whatever but when they
[42:53] see
[42:54] the word they see the word walking and
[42:57] talking and
[42:58] they see the word oh but paul
[43:01] i make mistakes this is so cool
[43:05] are we allowed to use that word in
[43:06] church this
[43:08] is so cool saints when we make a mistake
[43:14] and god deals with us god
[43:17] deals with us the world don't see
[43:20] someone walk back
[43:21] in and say you know what i had the wrong
[43:23] attitude i want to apologize
[43:26] god dealt with me who dealt with you
[43:29] not the judge not the sheriff not this
[43:32] not that it was almighty god
[43:34] and my brother and sister that is a
[43:35] message that if they're willing to
[43:37] receive that god
[43:38] actually moves upon people to walk back
[43:41] in and apologize to strangers
[43:42] that's not going to be a phenomenal that
[43:44] oh yeah that happens to me every day
[43:47] no it don't work that way you see we
[43:50] have become
[43:51] we have become the billboard we have
[43:54] become the message of the highway and
[43:56] the byway
[43:58] hallelujah as ye have therefore received
[44:01] christ jesus the lord
[44:03] so walk ye in him rooted and built
[44:06] up in him now i hope you don't mind me
[44:08] kind of dissecting these things for a
[44:10] few minutes tonight
[44:11] but my brother and sister have you ever
[44:13] i know you have i'll just put it in that
[44:15] way
[44:16] i i you you're driving down the road
[44:18] after a big storm
[44:19] and there is a big beautiful tree that
[44:21] stood in the yard
[44:22] and now it's uprooted and it didn't
[44:25] break off at the trunk
[44:26] it didn't get sheared off but all of its
[44:29] roots
[44:30] have just been peeled out of the ground
[44:32] and all of the roots are now just
[44:34] standing up
[44:36] but if you look really careful
[44:39] none of the main roots no no tap root no
[44:43] anchor root
[44:45] it's just all on the surface
[44:49] you know what causes that
[44:54] too easy never had to
[44:58] search for moisture i got this beautiful
[45:01] little tree in my yard
[45:02] i water it every day mistake
[45:06] never puts a root down everything that's
[45:09] there
[45:09] you know what's happening my brother and
[45:10] sister we're creating
[45:13] rootless christians we're creating
[45:16] a rootless gospel oh
[45:19] no no we don't want you to suffer we're
[45:21] going to pray prosperity prosperity
[45:22] prosperity on you
[45:24] remember what we just preached this last
[45:25] sunday sometimes god wants you to go
[45:27] through the fiery trial
[45:29] sometimes god wants you to get shook in
[45:31] every way
[45:32] possible and you might even face this
[45:35] mind battle
[45:36] this mind game where you're like i don't
[45:38] even know if i'm saved i don't even know
[45:40] if i can go on and serve the lord
[45:41] oh i don't know i don't know but you see
[45:43] what happens is you do have roots
[45:46] so you can't just you know this is just
[45:48] a cartoon i remember from my childhood i
[45:50] don't know why it's just silly
[45:52] you know and you see the tree out there
[45:55] well i'm in the backyard
[45:57] and they're all in the front yard why do
[46:00] i have to be in the back
[46:01] i'm not going to be in the backyard
[46:03] anymore and in the little cartoon he
[46:04] just pulls his roots up
[46:08] goes out to the front yard
[46:14] no wherever god placed me amen amen lord
[46:17] i need roots that will stand the
[46:19] pressure of loudness
[46:22] when the hard hot winds blow i don't
[46:24] want to wither up and die
[46:26] when the laodiceans spirit becomes so
[46:29] powerful my brother and sister
[46:30] that people say oh the antichrist is
[46:33] here it's this it's that
[46:35] no my brother's sister the antichrist
[46:37] spirit is here
[46:38] but they haven't seen nothing yet
[46:46] rooted now remember
[46:50] if there's no roots there can be nothing
[46:52] above it
[46:53] that will be sustained right amen
[46:57] shallow roots ultimately
[47:00] will not support rooted and built up in
[47:04] him established
[47:05] in the faith amen i love how this
[47:08] scripture brings such balance you see
[47:10] it's not established in the church
[47:13] it's in the faith as you have been
[47:16] taught so there has to be some good
[47:18] teaching there had to be some preaching
[47:20] that causes you and i to stop and
[47:22] examine where we're at
[47:24] and you know sister jerry made a comment
[47:26] and i i'm not rah-rah and pat myself on
[47:28] the back but she made a comment she goes
[47:30] you know i i never looked at it quite
[47:32] that way uh
[47:33] that the reason people are offended when
[47:36] they're judged is because they're not
[47:37] judging themselves
[47:40] now see if we come to church and say you
[47:41] know what lord
[47:43] what the preacher said was right and
[47:45] i've got to deal with this and i'm
[47:46] asking you lord i'm putting it under the
[47:48] blood
[47:49] because i'm unworthy and that kind of an
[47:51] atmosphere that kind of a thing
[47:52] is not healthy lord it's not what a
[47:54] christian should be
[47:56] and when you've judged that and the
[47:57] preacher gets up to the pulpit and says
[47:59] you've got something
[48:00] you're hiding something you're holding
[48:01] something back you're not surrendering
[48:03] you don't get up and go he can't talk to
[48:05] me that way
[48:06] and the reason is because you already
[48:08] talked to yourself that way
[48:10] and you realize okay he's just
[48:14] reminding me what god's already spoke to
[48:17] me
[48:18] he's not picking on me it's out of the
[48:21] mouth of two or three witnesses in the
[48:22] holy spirit dealing with your heart
[48:24] and maybe then the preacher speaking on
[48:26] those things
[48:27] and then i've seen this happen in my own
[48:29] life is it okay i judge myself a little
[48:30] bit before you
[48:31] and then you'll go home and you're
[48:33] thinking okay you know that's more than
[48:34] once i i've kind of heard that lord
[48:36] and then you go home and you put on a
[48:38] tape or something and the prophet of god
[48:40] goes
[48:41] and you're like there it is there it is
[48:44] what are you doing you're judging
[48:45] yourself see
[48:46] so therefore you can't get offended
[48:49] by the preaching of the word
[48:52] i i just i i love these these words here
[48:55] in colossians
[48:56] um rooted and built up in him
[49:01] established in the face that you've been
[49:02] taught abounding therein
[49:04] with thanksgiving
[49:08] thank you lord for correcting me thank
[49:11] you lord for the fiery trials right are
[49:13] these not scriptural
[49:14] thank you lord for what's happening
[49:16] thank you lord that you
[49:17] have called me that ought to be one of
[49:19] our greatest thanksgivings that we give
[49:20] every single day
[49:22] is thank you lord for calling me
[49:25] amen but look at this now and and i i
[49:28] don't want to go into it but i just want
[49:30] to make an emphasis because i believe
[49:31] verse 8
[49:32] is what is happening in our religious
[49:34] world right now
[49:35] in the world of christendom right now
[49:37] what is happening is
[49:39] we have too many people who are
[49:42] being spoiled through philosophy
[49:46] they're preaching all the rudiments of
[49:48] the gospel right
[49:50] right but it's there that without the
[49:53] life right
[49:54] without the life behind it right brother
[49:56] branham emphasized
[49:58] that the gospel my brother and sister is
[50:01] the life
[50:02] behind the word so without the life
[50:05] behind the word you can go click onto
[50:08] something a radio
[50:09] or whatever it might be and listen to
[50:10] somebody preach and go my
[50:12] that is powerful they must be listening
[50:15] to brother branham that's a comment
[50:16] sister jerry and i make to each other
[50:18] all the time
[50:19] little things here and there oh they
[50:20] must be listening brother branham my
[50:21] brother and sister they may
[50:23] never have listened to brother branham
[50:24] they're catching that anointing of the
[50:26] day
[50:27] but there is no life behind it and so
[50:30] what happens is they're spoiling the
[50:32] people
[50:33] through all these words of healing and
[50:35] deliverance and blessing
[50:37] and they're spoiling them in this
[50:39] philosophy that's empty
[50:42] and so then it becomes a vain deceit
[50:44] after the tradition of men
[50:48] then look at the scripture there after
[50:50] the tradition of men
[50:52] after the rudiments of the world
[50:58] after the foundational
[51:02] teachings of
[51:05] the world can i put in my own words
[51:08] tonight
[51:11] they have conditioned them
[51:14] to a vain version of the word
[51:19] empty version of the word
[51:26] so they believe they have it
[51:31] i should have snatched onto the quote
[51:33] that brother jason just read me
[51:36] talking about why you should go to
[51:38] church because you're the priest
[51:40] why you should lead your family because
[51:42] you're a priest i should do all these
[51:44] things maybe brother jason can share
[51:46] that
[51:46] later but you see we do that because of
[51:49] what
[51:49] we are or who we are so we're not here
[51:52] to be spoiled
[51:54] isn't it nice to be spoiled though
[51:57] now if i was to throw a little tantrum
[51:59] tonight
[52:00] would you guys give me what i want
[52:08] see some of you say no but you don't
[52:09] know what i want
[52:12] what if what i said i wanted was every
[52:14] one of you on the altar crying out to
[52:16] god
[52:17] if that was the case yeah
[52:25] but you see just look at the world we
[52:28] live in need to cater to the church we
[52:33] need to fill it up
[52:35] we have a building program we have this
[52:37] program we have that program
[52:39] and so what they're doing is they're
[52:41] catering
[52:42] but to get the church full
[52:46] they have to bring them into the
[52:48] rudiments
[52:49] of the world we've got to have
[52:53] this and we're going to have that and
[52:54] we're going to have that and that
[53:01] and when it's all done it's not after
[53:04] christ
[53:05] amen right wow isn't that so let me just
[53:08] sum up this little portion as we move
[53:10] forward they become
[53:13] shallow rooted christians
[53:16] lord help us but i think it's happening
[53:18] in the message
[53:20] we have people that hardly know what the
[53:23] prophet taught
[53:24] but they can identify i'm a message
[53:26] believer my brother and sister that's
[53:28] not good enough
[53:29] the fiery hot winds of laodicea will
[53:32] blow
[53:33] you've got to re be rooted deeper than
[53:35] god sent a prophet
[53:37] amen now proverbs the 9th chapter in the
[53:41] tenth verse
[53:42] the fear of the lord is the beginning of
[53:45] wisdom so
[53:45] we want wisdom right i think we could
[53:47] all agree tonight we want wisdom
[53:49] so we have now the starting point
[53:52] to get to a place that we understand
[53:55] this word in the hebrew
[53:57] is not fear as in quaking with anxiety
[54:00] but it is the reverence amen
[54:04] so the reverence of the lord is the
[54:06] beginning of wisdom
[54:08] and the knowledge of the holy is
[54:11] understanding now this knowledge is not
[54:14] as though we would learn
[54:15] my brother and sister in a seminary that
[54:18] we could go and
[54:19] and tie this together and tie that
[54:21] together i've got plenty of references
[54:22] in my office
[54:24] that tie every scripture in the bible
[54:27] and and ties it all together in a very
[54:29] complex web
[54:30] where you can go and say what is this
[54:32] word and how many other places is it
[54:34] used
[54:35] in this fashion or under this definition
[54:37] we can
[54:38] do all of that but my brother and sister
[54:40] in the knowledge of the holy if i can
[54:42] just put it to you tonight
[54:43] our brother put it in his prayer amen
[54:45] hallelujah we
[54:47] are the bride the wife of jesus christ
[54:51] now to have that knowledge we will not
[54:54] do that in absentee
[54:59] sister jerry told me the other day i've
[55:01] been married to you 38 years and i
[55:02] haven't figured you out yet and i'm like
[55:05] i've been married to you for 38 years
[55:07] and i haven't figured out near as much
[55:09] as you figured out
[55:12] now you think i'm just doing i'm making
[55:14] a point
[55:18] we've been trying
[55:23] what happens to the christian his
[55:26] relationship
[55:27] if he's not even trying
[55:31] that's right we'll never come to the
[55:33] knowledge
[55:35] and the understanding of jesus christ we
[55:38] have to do our homework as it were we
[55:41] have to put out the effort we have to
[55:44] study
[55:45] and the scripture people say well that's
[55:46] kind of applying to the preacher
[55:48] but study to show yourself approved
[55:51] study to
[55:52] know what you believe my brother and
[55:54] sister it's kind of sad that we can come
[55:56] to a place the message having been
[55:58] around so
[55:59] long in so many forms and so convenient
[56:02] to us
[56:02] and and many people and and i'll just
[56:04] raise my hand okay so i don't look
[56:06] judgmental act judgmental
[56:08] there's things well i don't understand
[56:10] it's right here in the message
[56:12] but you see we've chose to just sit and
[56:14] say amen
[56:15] without as it were opening the book
[56:18] and looking what is it i believe
[56:21] now i was going to title this sermon a
[56:23] little bit different i was going to
[56:25] title it
[56:26] if you have questions
[56:29] because how do you find answers for
[56:31] questions
[56:33] now we're going to just take this more
[56:35] in a carnal
[56:37] uh approach how do you find answers for
[56:41] questions
[56:42] no you don't ask siri
[56:46] you search for them right
[56:50] now what's happened this spirit now i'm
[56:53] not going off on this but i just want to
[56:55] lay this in here
[56:56] what's happened is this spirit is common
[56:58] people say well i have questions
[57:00] unanswered questions
[57:03] and i feel like my pastor failed me or
[57:06] this person failed me or that
[57:07] person failed me but
[57:12] what does the scripture say
[57:15] one it says seek ye first the kingdom of
[57:18] god
[57:19] it doesn't say seek ye a pastor or
[57:22] evangelist that can
[57:23] tell you it throws it back on
[57:27] us to search this out also
[57:31] it shows us that we have in multiple
[57:34] scriptures
[57:34] shows us that we have a responsibility
[57:38] to be the apt pupil we have the
[57:41] responsibility
[57:42] to be studious uh the whole scriptural
[57:44] type brother branham uh
[57:46] uh elaborates on that that his son would
[57:48] show himself worthy
[57:50] he gets good grades he studies and it
[57:52] comes then
[57:53] into adoption
[57:56] but if we're just going to sit and wait
[57:59] well i
[57:59] i had questions they never got answered
[58:03] so i i ended up just leaving i ended up
[58:05] just quitting
[58:06] because they didn't answer my questions
[58:09] what i'd like to do that i've never
[58:10] actually had the opportunity the one
[58:12] person actually kind of come to that
[58:14] basically looked at me and shut me off
[58:16] and walked off but
[58:19] are we are they is humanity
[58:22] actually doing their part to seek out
[58:25] the answer
[58:29] come on somebody say amen say ouch
[58:32] say something say time's up
[58:39] see the fear of the lord so we got to
[58:40] come to a reverence that it's not about
[58:42] what our church was
[58:44] this i want to reiterate this this is
[58:46] not about a relationship of you
[58:48] and your church and so i walked away
[58:51] from the church because there was
[58:52] nothing there
[58:53] my brother and sister you can't if you
[58:55] have a real relationship with jesus
[58:56] christ you can't walk away
[58:58] there's nowhere to go
[59:03] now the definition of wisdom is
[59:05] experience this is the brief
[59:07] uh definition uh experience knowledge
[59:10] and judgment
[59:11] so you must have to have wisdom you must
[59:14] have
[59:14] experience in what you're dealing with
[59:18] and you must attain a degree of
[59:21] knowledge
[59:23] right we can't say that we're wise in
[59:25] the way of
[59:26] whatever this is this is i like to use
[59:29] computers for an example because i
[59:32] well i can usually find the on button
[59:36] but i couldn't say i have wisdom when it
[59:38] comes to that
[59:42] listening to brother prashant and my
[59:44] son-in-law brother isaac
[59:46] yesterday discussing computer stuff and
[59:49] i actually like the conversations
[59:51] because then i can zone out and sit over
[59:53] there and go
[59:54] yeah yeah yeah
[59:57] interesting yeah can you repeat what it
[1:00:00] was
[1:00:01] well yeah you take a piece of sand or
[1:00:03] something like that and
[1:00:04] you give it some intelligence and you
[1:00:07] put it in your iphone
[1:00:09] and that what you told me brother person
[1:00:14] just like that
[1:00:18] so see you have to have experience and
[1:00:20] then you have to have
[1:00:22] knowledge but you know those two are
[1:00:25] no value at all if there's no judgment
[1:00:28] now i'm not talking about judgment as in
[1:00:30] being judged or to be sentenced right or
[1:00:33] wrong but to have judgments
[1:00:34] of when and where and how to apply this
[1:00:37] right the scripture tells us
[1:00:39] do not throw the pearl before the swine
[1:00:41] so some people will say
[1:00:42] i'm never i i've heard this saints and
[1:00:45] and you know you get distressed because
[1:00:47] there's been some poor teaching
[1:00:48] people say i never witness to people
[1:00:50] because i'm not going to throw the pearl
[1:00:51] before the swine
[1:00:53] no i'm sorry my brother sister is where
[1:00:55] you have to have knowledge
[1:00:57] you know you have to have this
[1:00:59] experience you have to do this then you
[1:01:01] have
[1:01:01] have to have judgment when someone has a
[1:01:03] real heart's desire for something of god
[1:01:06] they're not the swine
[1:01:10] but you don't go so slinging the message
[1:01:12] or slinging scripture in front of
[1:01:14] somebody who's just there to prove you
[1:01:15] wrong
[1:01:17] just there to take a scripture another
[1:01:19] scripture or something and prove you
[1:01:20] wrong
[1:01:22] so we have to have experience and
[1:01:23] knowledge and judgment
[1:01:25] now i want to hurry along here uh
[1:01:27] proverbs the 14th chapter
[1:01:29] verses 8 through 12 says the wisdom of
[1:01:32] the prudent
[1:01:34] is to understand his way now this is a
[1:01:38] small h
[1:01:39] in this my brother and sister so it's
[1:01:41] not actually
[1:01:42] speaking of our lord jesus christ it's
[1:01:44] not speaking of god
[1:01:46] it's us having understanding of the way
[1:01:49] we have been called
[1:01:50] the path that we have been called now
[1:01:53] i've heard people say before well
[1:01:55] you know the lord led me here but if it
[1:01:57] had been up to me i would have done this
[1:02:00] you know what you really are in your
[1:02:02] mind you're at odds
[1:02:04] with what god has called you to do now
[1:02:07] the scripture tells us also in the book
[1:02:09] of proverbs that we should not do or
[1:02:11] serve god grudgingly
[1:02:15] so we have to accept it it's either
[1:02:16] god's will or it's not and if it's god's
[1:02:18] will
[1:02:19] then don't say i have a different mind
[1:02:21] than god has because you can't then say
[1:02:23] i have the mind of christ
[1:02:25] i have another mind but the folly of
[1:02:29] fools is deceit
[1:02:31] fools make a mock at sin now i won't
[1:02:34] repeat
[1:02:35] you know in my studies i won't repeat
[1:02:37] some of the things that i come across
[1:02:39] at this but you talk about mocking it
[1:02:41] sin
[1:02:42] is when they debase themselves and then
[1:02:45] laugh
[1:02:46] and in this one deal this very i guess
[1:02:49] the world thinks a respectable person is
[1:02:52] like well
[1:02:53] christians are prudes
[1:02:58] thank you lord amen thank you lord i'm
[1:03:01] glad i'm a prude
[1:03:04] because you see they're just fulfilling
[1:03:06] this scripture
[1:03:07] and so am i so are you amen
[1:03:10] amen so they come and they knock
[1:03:14] at sin but among the righteous there is
[1:03:16] favor
[1:03:17] the heart knoweth his own bitterness and
[1:03:20] a stranger doth not
[1:03:22] intermittal with his joy the house of
[1:03:24] the wicked shall be overthrown
[1:03:27] but the tabernacle of the upright shall
[1:03:30] flourish
[1:03:31] you know i've told this story many times
[1:03:33] here in the church of brother back east
[1:03:35] uh amen you know never had much in life
[1:03:39] and then they got old he
[1:03:40] you know to take care of himself he had
[1:03:42] a whole family
[1:03:43] there that uh took you know care of
[1:03:46] their parents
[1:03:47] and um somebody talking to this brother
[1:03:50] about you know uh how that he ended up
[1:03:54] financially you know in the natural in
[1:03:56] his position
[1:03:57] and um and the brother just said well
[1:03:59] you know i just always worked it just
[1:04:01] was always god provided enough to
[1:04:02] support the family
[1:04:04] but i'm rich
[1:04:07] he was rich he had quite a few children
[1:04:09] well in my thinking
[1:04:11] had like seven eight nine children all
[1:04:13] of them serving the lord
[1:04:15] all of their spouses serving the lord
[1:04:17] all of their children
[1:04:18] serving the lord and some of their
[1:04:21] children now
[1:04:22] getting married and serving the lord
[1:04:27] would you trade that for anything
[1:04:32] i don't think so when we're young we'd
[1:04:34] say well it doesn't matter but when we
[1:04:36] get older you look out and see the
[1:04:37] legacy of god moving in your family
[1:04:40] see god doing this you realize you're
[1:04:41] rich when you get to the other side
[1:04:43] imagine
[1:04:44] as it were this is just a human
[1:04:45] interpretation of and imagine the crown
[1:04:47] that god's going to give this man
[1:04:49] that he left behind a legacy of those
[1:04:52] whose faith
[1:04:53] rose up to meet their day and their
[1:04:56] faith was sufficient and their children
[1:04:58] get these saints their children saw god
[1:05:02] in mom and dad the children saw god and
[1:05:05] grandma and grandpa
[1:05:07] the children saw god and their siblings
[1:05:13] oh my amen there's not enough money on
[1:05:16] earth to buy that
[1:05:18] you talk about being rich
[1:05:21] there is a way which seemeth right into
[1:05:23] a man but the end thereof
[1:05:24] are the ways of death now let me hurry
[1:05:26] along
[1:05:27] now look at this i don't know
[1:05:30] i don't want to act like i'm some real
[1:05:33] free
[1:05:34] thinker outside the box but have you
[1:05:36] ever thought about the fact that satan
[1:05:38] serving satan has no reward
[1:05:42] and no reward is offered
[1:05:46] amen people labor
[1:05:50] for the devil for free
[1:05:55] unless of course you place value on
[1:05:56] worldly pleasure
[1:05:59] and if we place value on that then some
[1:06:00] of these people are billionaires
[1:06:04] there's nothing that places value on
[1:06:07] that
[1:06:08] so satan has no reward has offered no
[1:06:10] reward
[1:06:11] nothing does he encourages people
[1:06:14] nothing to
[1:06:15] encourage them to live for
[1:06:19] offers the reward of the present tense
[1:06:22] now the prophet of god lays this out
[1:06:24] several different places but
[1:06:26] he said there's actually only two laws
[1:06:29] in the universe the law of life
[1:06:33] and the law of death jesus christ brings
[1:06:36] life and
[1:06:37] satan brings death and so as we look at
[1:06:40] that we just realize
[1:06:42] my brother and sister how that these
[1:06:44] things of the scripture are played out
[1:06:46] right around us but yet sometimes
[1:06:48] we just it goes by us and we don't we
[1:06:50] don't recognize it
[1:06:51] now i wish we had the quotes here but it
[1:06:54] is what it is tonight
[1:06:55] in the pool of bethesda brother brown
[1:06:57] preached this in 1950
[1:06:58] he's speaking of man he says he
[1:07:00] destroyed himself with his gun powder
[1:07:03] if it's electric lights he pulls gases
[1:07:05] out of the earth wisdom
[1:07:07] run to and fro knowledge shall increase
[1:07:10] and they brought their self
[1:07:11] a hydrogen bomb now i don't know what
[1:07:13] they're going to do
[1:07:14] automobiles i mean look at this we're
[1:07:17] worried about a virus
[1:07:19] get this it's a lovely little fact that
[1:07:21] that one of these
[1:07:22] radio commentators brought up while we
[1:07:25] are worried about
[1:07:26] and they had these hard numbers were
[1:07:28] worried about a virus
[1:07:31] cars have continued to kill people
[1:07:35] at the same pace and no one said
[1:07:40] we must get rid of the car i'm going to
[1:07:43] vaccinate our car
[1:07:47] you see heart disease
[1:07:50] still taking its toll the flu
[1:07:54] disappeared they cured the flu when the
[1:07:57] coronas showed up
[1:07:59] but you see my brother and sister what
[1:08:00] it is is man
[1:08:02] is destroying himself now brother
[1:08:05] branham says this
[1:08:06] automobiles every time a man god
[1:08:08] destroys
[1:08:10] nothing oh here it is beautiful
[1:08:15] god destroys nothing you know saints now
[1:08:18] i want to put this maybe it doesn't
[1:08:19] apply to anyone here but maybe you'll
[1:08:21] just have it
[1:08:22] somewhere hard people will be angry at
[1:08:24] god for years for things that happened
[1:08:26] in their life
[1:08:28] angry i'm not talking about there just
[1:08:30] have a question mark
[1:08:31] angry at god i won't serve a god like
[1:08:36] that
[1:08:38] god destroys nothing man destroys
[1:08:41] himself
[1:08:42] by worldly wisdom the first conflict
[1:08:45] that ever come in the world was because
[1:08:46] somebody was seeking after worldly
[1:08:48] wisdom instead of
[1:08:50] simple faith in god
[1:08:54] my what if cain you know our lord jesus
[1:08:56] offered him the opportunity
[1:08:58] he come he couldn't help that his
[1:09:00] understanding
[1:09:01] was such that he brought every beautiful
[1:09:03] melon and and fruits and vegetables
[1:09:06] and flowers and all of this and laid it
[1:09:08] all on the altar
[1:09:09] and then when the word come to correct
[1:09:11] him
[1:09:12] he just got angry and the holy spirit if
[1:09:16] you want to put it that way because it
[1:09:17] is god right prophet of god shows us
[1:09:19] clearly it's a whole god
[1:09:21] the holy spirit comes down and deals
[1:09:23] with him and says all you have to do is
[1:09:25] just repent
[1:09:27] say lord i'm sorry i thought this was
[1:09:28] what i i was supposed to do
[1:09:31] give me revelation lord i'm going to get
[1:09:32] down and pray for revelation imagine if
[1:09:34] cain
[1:09:34] had got down on that day and prayed for
[1:09:36] revelation
[1:09:38] instead by wisdom he said my offering
[1:09:41] that offering was gross that was
[1:09:44] disgusting it was bloody and it was
[1:09:46] just horrible mind was beautiful
[1:09:50] and painless
[1:09:56] so he sought after worldly wisdom
[1:09:57] instead of simple faith
[1:10:00] so you see how that this wisdom that
[1:10:02] god's wanting to give to you and i
[1:10:03] saints
[1:10:04] there's some of you very educated i'll
[1:10:06] just speak it out i know you won't take
[1:10:08] no offense
[1:10:08] there's some of you here that are too
[1:10:10] smart for your own good
[1:10:15] but we just on sunday saw where the
[1:10:17] prophet of god says you know god saves
[1:10:18] rich men
[1:10:20] i'll make the declaration god saves
[1:10:22] really smart people
[1:10:25] but it's when we seek the wisdom of the
[1:10:27] world
[1:10:28] over simple faith in god's word that we
[1:10:31] have
[1:10:31] an impasse when we believe that we can
[1:10:34] solve the sin equation
[1:10:36] ourself you know almost like a
[1:10:40] synthetic blood our version
[1:10:45] you see isn't it interesting and i won't
[1:10:47] go in depth because there's so much in
[1:10:48] this
[1:10:49] isn't it interesting that the spirit of
[1:10:51] this age is in spirit of separation
[1:10:55] satan is coming the word of god says
[1:10:57] that it would be mother
[1:10:59] and father and son and daughter
[1:11:01] everybody against everybody
[1:11:03] but it's also the age you say how would
[1:11:05] that happen because it's the age god
[1:11:07] said
[1:11:08] come out of her my people so
[1:11:11] satan has to come and mirror that so
[1:11:14] while the bride of christ is being
[1:11:16] called out of this world
[1:11:18] and something's stirring her and she's
[1:11:20] had to make some hard decisions can any
[1:11:22] of you say amen on that
[1:11:23] they that you've come at times in your
[1:11:25] life that you've had to make decisions
[1:11:27] and there's been family members that you
[1:11:29] know thought you would lost your mind
[1:11:31] and things happen
[1:11:32] and because you have faith in your heart
[1:11:34] you've had to make the decision to just
[1:11:35] keep moving on in the word of god for
[1:11:37] this day
[1:11:38] and so god is coming and bringing
[1:11:40] separation amongst the bride
[1:11:42] but the bride is also just simply being
[1:11:44] called out of this world my brother and
[1:11:45] sister
[1:11:46] that there's a lot of pleasures now can
[1:11:48] we be honest with ourselves today
[1:11:50] there's a lot of pleasures that we as
[1:11:52] humans would
[1:11:53] enjoy
[1:12:00] but the word of god says
[1:12:03] i don't want you in the swimsuit on the
[1:12:06] beach
[1:12:09] i don't want you over here doing this
[1:12:13] i don't want you doing that
[1:12:16] now this is not a blanket law that comes
[1:12:19] from the pulpit
[1:12:20] i'm talking about the holy spirit
[1:12:21] dealing with lives
[1:12:23] i'm talking about about the holy spirit
[1:12:26] you know dealing with
[1:12:27] us that that so so you know little
[1:12:29] things that we would look at
[1:12:31] now it doesn't mean we never go swimming
[1:12:33] doesn't mean we never do these things my
[1:12:34] brother and sister
[1:12:35] we just realized god wants us to do
[1:12:37] things in a certain fashion
[1:12:39] so we do those according to what a
[1:12:41] christian would do we
[1:12:42] we don't go out and behave like the
[1:12:44] world we don't
[1:12:46] present ourselves like the world amen uh
[1:12:48] you know it it's just
[1:12:50] i i'll get my foot in my mouth if i keep
[1:12:52] going down that route but
[1:12:54] i i just want to tell you he's calling
[1:12:56] us out of the spirit of this age
[1:12:59] and there's as the scripture says
[1:13:00] there's many things that are
[1:13:03] but they are not expedient
[1:13:06] and the holy spirit's what gives us the
[1:13:08] knowledge that this is not expedient
[1:13:11] this might be you know just use my good
[1:13:13] friend brother trevor an example
[1:13:15] that that we have to be careful i might
[1:13:17] you know have a desire to do something
[1:13:19] and it's not wrong but when i do that
[1:13:24] if it cause my brother trevor issues in
[1:13:27] his life
[1:13:30] then wisdom shows me i don't do that
[1:13:34] i pull back from that because
[1:13:38] we don't want to be the detriment
[1:13:44] amen
[1:13:49] so see the world is calling
[1:13:52] the word i mean is calling the bride out
[1:13:54] of the world he's calling on her
[1:13:57] by revelation that she sees then
[1:14:01] and pulls back from those things now
[1:14:04] ephesians the first chapter
[1:14:06] verses 15 through 18 says wherefore i
[1:14:09] also after i heard of your faith in the
[1:14:11] lord jesus
[1:14:14] and love unto all the saints cease
[1:14:17] not to give thanks for you making
[1:14:19] mention of you in my prayers
[1:14:21] isn't that wonderful i love this paul's
[1:14:24] speaking to the ephesians here
[1:14:25] he's telling them i just heard i didn't
[1:14:27] even see it i just heard
[1:14:29] what god was doing in your life now
[1:14:31] saint you're not going to find i
[1:14:32] this sounds creepy forgive me but you're
[1:14:34] not going to find brother paul peeping
[1:14:35] in the windows of your house
[1:14:37] you know like is this family doing right
[1:14:40] is this family doing right are they
[1:14:41] doing
[1:14:42] right are they going to do no because i
[1:14:43] have much more confidence in you
[1:14:45] and i have that much more confidence in
[1:14:47] the holy spirit that as sons and
[1:14:49] daughters of god the holy spirit
[1:14:50] leading us and as the reports i want to
[1:14:53] put it this way as the reports
[1:14:55] of what god is doing comes back i praise
[1:14:58] god
[1:14:59] and i stand upon that i hear of your
[1:15:02] faith i hear
[1:15:03] of prayers that were prayed and prayers
[1:15:06] that are answered
[1:15:07] and decisions that i would if i would
[1:15:09] come i would say don't do that don't do
[1:15:11] this don't do but see it's not my job
[1:15:13] i'm not a dictator
[1:15:14] and so you know you go and you pray and
[1:15:16] then you hear well we decided to do this
[1:15:20] and you know that was the holy spirit
[1:15:21] leading that individual leading that
[1:15:23] family
[1:15:24] and we praise god we hear of that
[1:15:27] and so we cease not to give thanks for
[1:15:29] you making mention of you in our prayers
[1:15:31] i try to practice this scripture right
[1:15:33] here i try to practice this right here
[1:15:35] that the god of our lord jesus christ
[1:15:37] the father of glory
[1:15:39] may give unto you and this right here i
[1:15:41] got so excited i've read this scripture
[1:15:43] so many times
[1:15:45] but it hit me today just today at noon
[1:15:48] time as i was trying to finish up this
[1:15:50] it may give unto you wisdom
[1:15:55] spirit spirit
[1:15:58] hallelujah the holy ghost coming down
[1:16:01] and it's not just some kind of wisdom
[1:16:03] i can do this i've got wisdom to do this
[1:16:05] but it's the spirit of almighty god
[1:16:08] stirring the hearts of sons and
[1:16:10] daughters of god giving us wisdom
[1:16:12] the right words to say the right time
[1:16:14] and the right things and
[1:16:16] and it's there that the holy spirit
[1:16:18] moves down and it says you know as the
[1:16:20] scripture says
[1:16:20] that that don't even try to find your
[1:16:22] own words
[1:16:24] don't even try to find your own way just
[1:16:26] let god move upon you
[1:16:28] this is the spirit of wisdom god dealing
[1:16:30] with us
[1:16:31] how it can be that you can be going and
[1:16:33] somebody you
[1:16:34] know that just is not religious at all
[1:16:36] but one day
[1:16:37] something comes and you just make a
[1:16:39] statement to them
[1:16:40] and then they pour their heart out well
[1:16:42] we've got this issue in our family
[1:16:44] there's this disease there's this happen
[1:16:47] will you
[1:16:48] pray for us well that doesn't come from
[1:16:51] just us we don't have oh i'm just so
[1:16:52] smart i figured this out
[1:16:53] what is it it's a spirit of wisdom god
[1:16:55] coming down saying just
[1:16:57] say these words but he doesn't come down
[1:16:59] and say now i would just want you to say
[1:17:01] these words you just feel
[1:17:02] are you with me you just feel
[1:17:04] overpowered
[1:17:06] i've got to speak to him i don't even
[1:17:09] know why
[1:17:11] they're not religious they don't care
[1:17:14] but something inside of you so speak
[1:17:23] and many times they come afterwards and
[1:17:25] say
[1:17:26] my wife my child brother-in-law
[1:17:29] sister-in-law
[1:17:30] mom dad whatever we got better
[1:17:34] yeah thank you for praying you can't
[1:17:38] buy that kind of influence you can't buy
[1:17:41] that kind of testimony
[1:17:43] but the spirit of wisdom coming upon you
[1:17:46] can lead us
[1:17:47] to present jesus christ to this world in
[1:17:49] that fashion
[1:17:51] hallelujah i hope i'm not too intense
[1:17:53] for you tonight
[1:17:55] hallelujah may give unto you the spirit
[1:17:58] of wisdom
[1:17:59] and revelation in the knowledge of him
[1:18:03] my brother and sister to me that
[1:18:04] encapsulates that whole idea right there
[1:18:06] it is just right there we need the
[1:18:08] spirit of wisdom and revelation
[1:18:10] in the knowledge of him hallelujah to be
[1:18:13] able to look in our bible
[1:18:15] why does the world this is homework i
[1:18:18] could give you
[1:18:19] go online my brother and sister and
[1:18:21] search out scriptures
[1:18:22] and look at how many of the key
[1:18:24] scriptures that people
[1:18:25] write into these forums and say i read
[1:18:27] this over and over and over and over
[1:18:29] again
[1:18:29] and i don't understand and then the
[1:18:32] forum whatever you call them the form
[1:18:33] master guy
[1:18:34] he says oh this is what that means and
[1:18:36] you're like no it doesn't
[1:18:41] how do you know the answer because the
[1:18:43] spirit
[1:18:45] of wisdom and knowledge and revelation
[1:18:48] has fallen on you
[1:18:53] you see if it was just simply an
[1:18:54] explanation
[1:18:56] we could just get a tape of the prophet
[1:18:57] or a book of the prophet just give it to
[1:18:59] him and they'd have the answer
[1:19:01] it doesn't work that way does it you
[1:19:03] could tell them go read that scripture
[1:19:06] 50 times it'll come to you but if 50
[1:19:08] times it still hasn't come to them
[1:19:10] are you with me tonight it's the spirit
[1:19:13] of wisdom
[1:19:14] and revelation in the knowledge of him
[1:19:17] has
[1:19:18] fallen on you god's gift to you
[1:19:21] tonight today amen that we could come in
[1:19:24] the riches
[1:19:26] oh the eyes of your understanding being
[1:19:28] enlightened that you may know
[1:19:30] what is the hope of his calling and what
[1:19:32] the riches of the glory of
[1:19:33] his inheritance is in the saints
[1:19:37] oh my i just love that scripture
[1:19:40] you see there's lots of spirits out here
[1:19:43] saints
[1:19:44] i walked in the story the other day and
[1:19:46] i won't mention nothing because there's
[1:19:48] some parents here that slap me silly
[1:19:50] and i shouldn't anyhow i walked in a
[1:19:53] store the other day
[1:19:55] song i haven't thought of in the eon of
[1:19:58] time
[1:19:59] and it's playing on the radio
[1:20:03] and that little spirit stirs you
[1:20:06] and the words to a song that you think
[1:20:08] you've forgotten
[1:20:11] are you with me but there's a spirit an
[1:20:14] anointing with that the prophet of god
[1:20:16] says
[1:20:16] anointing on music and that spirit comes
[1:20:19] down
[1:20:20] [Music]
[1:20:26] because there's a spirit an anointing
[1:20:28] there
[1:20:30] now do you think that's by accident i
[1:20:32] don't think so i think the devil knows
[1:20:34] how to set a snare
[1:20:38] lots of spirits but the word of god
[1:20:41] tells us to cry out for the spirit of
[1:20:43] wisdom
[1:20:43] and revelation will you do that i just
[1:20:46] ask you saints will you do that will you
[1:20:48] just
[1:20:48] put that in it directly in a prayer in
[1:20:50] your prayers lord
[1:20:52] i'm crying out i'm seeking lord i'm
[1:20:54] desiring to have the spirit of wisdom in
[1:20:56] revelation
[1:20:58] hallelujah now in god's only provided
[1:21:01] place of worship um brother brown says
[1:21:05] here listen
[1:21:06] 11 28 65 saints now i'm not a date
[1:21:09] person
[1:21:10] i know i've had people tell me before
[1:21:12] well if it's before 63 or if it's here
[1:21:14] or if there we don't
[1:21:16] well i'm sorry i i believe these things
[1:21:18] you know god corrected him good example
[1:21:20] brother branham you know
[1:21:21] dealing with the horse riders you know
[1:21:23] thought the white horse holy spirits and
[1:21:25] different things like that god corrected
[1:21:27] them
[1:21:27] but my brother and sister i don't
[1:21:29] believe uh that uh you know what was
[1:21:31] preached before 1960 or
[1:21:33] before 1956 has any less value
[1:21:38] than those things preached afterwards
[1:21:41] that's just how i feel about it i have
[1:21:44] had people look me in the face and say
[1:21:45] well the quote you read
[1:21:47] uh was before this certain date so
[1:21:49] therefore we don't feel like it's valid
[1:21:51] well you just don't feel like it's valid
[1:21:53] i think it's valid
[1:21:55] amen so if we're going to get really
[1:21:56] valid
[1:21:58] 11 28 65 ought to be about as valid as
[1:22:01] it gets
[1:22:05] now if in the human heart there's a
[1:22:07] longing like methodist baptist
[1:22:09] presbyterian catholic
[1:22:10] all these others trying to find that one
[1:22:12] true way
[1:22:14] and they're told by their priests and
[1:22:16] pastors and so forth
[1:22:17] that this is the true way
[1:22:20] okay can i put some rubber on the road
[1:22:23] is that not
[1:22:25] what we do
[1:22:29] we're here preaching this is the way
[1:22:32] this message
[1:22:33] is the way it's what we preach so this
[1:22:35] applies to us
[1:22:37] they say the priest says there's no
[1:22:39] salvation outside the catholic church
[1:22:42] well each church takes his their own
[1:22:44] idea
[1:22:45] some of them won't admit it but they
[1:22:47] just do it by
[1:22:48] their action um is this still applying
[1:22:52] to us in this day
[1:22:55] your action speaks louder than your word
[1:22:57] it's just in other words
[1:22:59] they're just more of a this is rough
[1:23:02] isn't it
[1:23:04] this can't be right because our
[1:23:07] prophet's
[1:23:08] just kind of like grandfather and he's
[1:23:11] always
[1:23:11] kind and he's not going to skin us
[1:23:15] because we believe the message
[1:23:18] boy you guys are just
[1:23:26] they're just more of a hypocrite than
[1:23:29] the catholic is
[1:23:31] ouch ouch
[1:23:35] let's practice that ouch
[1:23:39] the catholic confesses it right out i
[1:23:42] believe that this is the only thing
[1:23:44] but they won't do that they hide it
[1:23:47] but their actions prove what they're
[1:23:49] thinking see
[1:23:51] well i'll tell you what the word of god
[1:23:52] says whatever is done in secret
[1:23:54] will be made open so this right here
[1:23:58] that when people have actions and
[1:24:00] they're really trying to steer
[1:24:02] people in a certain direction but
[1:24:04] they'll never come out and say it
[1:24:05] they'll never come out well saints i'm
[1:24:07] not going to toot my horn but i'll tell
[1:24:08] you this
[1:24:09] but i believe of this message has been
[1:24:11] preached to you from this pulpit
[1:24:13] over and over and over and over again
[1:24:16] and i would say
[1:24:17] if i have ever put something
[1:24:20] that was a seed or something in there
[1:24:22] that wasn't correct i would pray that
[1:24:24] somebody would say brother paul
[1:24:25] that that didn't that didn't ring that
[1:24:27] wasn't what the prophet said that's not
[1:24:29] what the scripture says
[1:24:30] because you see the only way we can come
[1:24:32] and truly be ministers of the gospel is
[1:24:35] to approach this
[1:24:36] as a eunuch and that is we have nothing
[1:24:38] to put in ourselves
[1:24:39] we have nothing to gain we are just here
[1:24:42] to do what god called us
[1:24:44] to do because you see if we hide it
[1:24:48] sooner or later our actions will betray
[1:24:50] it
[1:24:51] and then why would we waste our time
[1:24:55] is that too blunt to put it that way why
[1:24:58] would we waste our time
[1:25:03] now
[1:25:07] there's got to be
[1:25:13] then one place because there is a desire
[1:25:17] in the human heart to find it
[1:25:19] and i think the word of god has
[1:25:22] now listen careful saints
[1:25:26] i think and uh le can i amend this
[1:25:29] section of this quote before i even read
[1:25:31] it
[1:25:32] amen hallelujah and i think that the
[1:25:36] word of god has the answer for
[1:25:38] everything that we have need
[1:25:42] of so god has the answer
[1:25:46] and let's search for it now in the
[1:25:48] scripture
[1:25:49] then if god would show us by the
[1:25:51] scriptures the only place the only
[1:25:53] ground
[1:25:54] the only oh look how brother brown
[1:25:56] throws us in
[1:25:58] the only denomination if it's so the
[1:26:01] only way that god will meet a man
[1:26:03] then we should hold to that because we
[1:26:06] found the truth of the bible
[1:26:08] what it says
[1:26:11] so he throws this denomination in there
[1:26:14] my brother and sister
[1:26:16] in such a fashion you word it any way
[1:26:18] you want
[1:26:19] this is the way i read it you just go
[1:26:21] ahead and you word it any way you want
[1:26:23] but god's got one place where he
[1:26:26] has placed his word
[1:26:29] one place it's not over here
[1:26:33] have you ever noticed i hope this don't
[1:26:35] hurt anybody's feelings
[1:26:37] but have you ever noticed that the pros
[1:26:40] can use certain quotes
[1:26:42] and the cons use the same quote
[1:26:47] now that's kind of hard to figure out
[1:26:50] who's right or is it hard
[1:26:54] no sir we take this interpretation of
[1:26:56] quote we take this interpretation of a
[1:26:58] quote
[1:26:59] and we run it
[1:27:02] through the filter
[1:27:06] and you'll know which one is correct
[1:27:12] i'm going to close sister emmy if you
[1:27:13] would come
[1:27:15] saints i have a prayer request
[1:27:19] i have to laugh just thinking about what
[1:27:20] brother chris preached that night now
[1:27:22] these message deals you know we do this
[1:27:24] and we got an unspoken prayer request
[1:27:26] so i'm i'm going to make this one a
[1:27:28] spoken prayer request so i don't have to
[1:27:30] judge myself by what brother chris
[1:27:32] preached that day and i say that in
[1:27:33] humor nobody get bent out of shape
[1:27:37] i'm going to place a prayer request
[1:27:39] before you as a church
[1:27:42] pray for me that i will have the spirit
[1:27:47] of wisdom and revelation
[1:27:50] and i will pray for you that you will
[1:27:53] have the spirit
[1:27:55] of wisdom and revelation now if we
[1:27:59] as a body of believers are praying for
[1:28:01] one another not selfishly right
[1:28:03] not ever just putting ourself up there
[1:28:06] lord give me
[1:28:07] but we will take the time and the effort
[1:28:09] to
[1:28:10] to pray this through the lord give
[1:28:13] wisdom and revelation to my brother my
[1:28:16] sister
[1:28:17] going right through the church amen i
[1:28:19] like this how it works you can pray for
[1:28:21] north of the freeway and then you can
[1:28:23] pray for south of the freeway and you
[1:28:24] can play
[1:28:25] for west of here and west or east of
[1:28:28] there
[1:28:28] and then you can cover the whole church
[1:28:30] without forgetting a single individual
[1:28:32] and pray for the spirit of wisdom and
[1:28:35] revelation
[1:28:36] and if we'll do that my brother and
[1:28:38] sister god says that he will give us the
[1:28:39] desires of our heart and we as a church
[1:28:43] will have the spirit of wisdom and
[1:28:45] revelation
[1:28:46] amen you love the lord tonight i don't
[1:28:49] know why we preachers say that because i
[1:28:51] know you do
[1:28:52] but you know it's just a beautiful thing
[1:28:55] when you realize
[1:28:56] my brother and sister just exactly what
[1:28:58] god's doing
[1:29:00] because he says right here in this quote
[1:29:03] because there is a desire in the human
[1:29:05] heart to find it
[1:29:07] you are no different i am no different
[1:29:09] we have a desire
[1:29:10] to find the truth of god's word in this
[1:29:12] hour and he promised you know this one
[1:29:14] of the things that
[1:29:15] many years ago when i was struggling my
[1:29:17] own my own experience
[1:29:19] you know it i i just have to say it it
[1:29:22] can be hard
[1:29:23] when you're raised in the message and
[1:29:25] then you backslide the word of god says
[1:29:27] you
[1:29:27] you're actually very fortunate that god
[1:29:29] would call you back
[1:29:30] [Music]
[1:29:32] [Applause]
[1:29:37] but i used to hold to this
[1:29:40] [Music]
[1:29:41] because i did have an experience when i
[1:29:43] was a teenager
[1:29:46] i held to that this work
[1:29:50] [Music]
[1:29:56] oh my brother and sister we're coming
[1:29:58] right down to the days
[1:30:01] the scripture is just being fulfilled so
[1:30:03] fast before us
[1:30:05] we don't say this out of fear we say it
[1:30:08] out of the realization that these things
[1:30:10] are happening it's here
[1:30:14] this is the season this is the time the
[1:30:16] scripture told us about
[1:30:18] [Music]
[1:30:19] but we must recognize he put the desire
[1:30:22] in you
[1:30:23] we didn't put it but he himself and he
[1:30:26] says
[1:30:27] this work this desire this thirst
[1:30:30] i put in you look at this
[1:30:34] is it okay if i interpret the scripture
[1:30:36] to you this way tonight
[1:30:38] this this thirst this desire that i put
[1:30:41] in you
[1:30:42] i will come along and satisfy
[1:30:47] i will be the one that will pour it out
[1:30:50] and bring
[1:30:51] satisfaction and peace and joy and love
[1:30:54] and hope
[1:30:55] in your life i will make you complete

[1:31:13] something in right now i need you to
