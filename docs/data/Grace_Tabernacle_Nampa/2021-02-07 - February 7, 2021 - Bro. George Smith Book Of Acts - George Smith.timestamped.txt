[38:02] honduras and from spain
[38:05] and so we've had an international
[38:06] meeting already
[38:08] but now we're going to go into the
[38:10] english bible
[38:11] and uh see what god has for us
[38:16] for the people in this area because
[38:18] people you know god has people

[38:36] we pray that you bless each one
[38:38] may everybody be able to take something
[38:40] home with them and it was worth coming
[38:42] to church
[38:43] bless your people bless brother paul the
[38:45] family protect us
[38:46] and guide us lord to speak only the
[38:48] truth we ask in jesus name
[38:50] amen so
[38:53] excuse me the
[38:57] pastor has a good heating system in his
[38:59] house and
[39:00] tends to drive me out a little bit but
[39:03] in chapter 16 is where paul picks up
[39:07] timothy for a helper he was a good
[39:10] choice
[39:11] and he proved out later to be very
[39:12] useful in the ministry
[39:14] and that's why paul wrote first and
[39:16] second timothy letters to his
[39:18] helper you know his associate but in
[39:20] verse 4
[39:21] of chapter 16 and as they went through
[39:24] the cities they delivered them
[39:26] the decrees for to keep
[39:30] that were ordained of the apostles and
[39:32] elders which were at jerusalem
[39:33] now what's that talking about that's
[39:35] talking about a
[39:37] church order letter that was written
[39:39] back in chapter 15 verses 20 and 21
[39:42] and making things you know putting
[39:44] things in order making it real to the
[39:46] new converts
[39:47] because um they uh they needed some
[39:50] understanding they needed things to to
[39:52] kind of accommodate you know
[39:53] and we have we have tape recordings
[39:55] today you know
[39:56] we can listen to it anytime day or night
[39:59] everything
[40:00] uh brother branham said is in several
[40:02] languages on every cell phone on the
[40:04] planet
[40:05] so there's no excuse there's no lack of
[40:07] word in the
[40:08] you know world we live in and so um
[40:12] uh they were just helping the new
[40:14] believers
[40:16] and they weren't just out there
[40:17] repeating the book of uh whatever jesus
[40:19] said
[40:19] you when you read through the book of
[40:21] acts and i encourage you to do so
[40:22] because we're not giving you every word
[40:24] we're not going to spoon feed you this
[40:26] book of acts you've got to go read it
[40:28] yourself and see if these things are
[40:30] even true we're telling you
[40:32] but in all of the reading of the book of
[40:33] acts you're not going to find anywhere
[40:35] where they're just out there and jesus
[40:36] said and jesus said and jesus
[40:38] said it's not there
[40:42] they were just living it out naturally
[40:44] see
[40:45] and so in chapter 16 verse 5
[40:49] we see that the work was growing it
[40:51] wasn't because of paul's wisdom
[40:53] it wasn't because he was so smart but he
[40:54] was smart he'd been to school
[40:58] a lot of people couldn't read back then
[41:00] but he had been
[41:01] trained and if we look into
[41:05] uh first corinthians chapter two we see
[41:08] here some of
[41:09] his um words that he used uh first
[41:12] corinthians two and verse one
[41:14] and i brethren when i came to you you
[41:17] know
[41:18] ministering and so forth i didn't come
[41:20] with excellency of speech or
[41:21] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[41:24] of god
[41:24] for i determined not to know anything i
[41:27] put it all away and only not saying i
[41:28] preached to you
[41:29] was jesus christ and him crucified that
[41:32] is the essence of the message of the
[41:35] gospel
[41:36] and we don't need a lot of opinions and
[41:38] ideas and i think and i
[41:40] no that just took us nowhere out into
[41:43] the
[41:44] area of speculation and people living
[41:46] wrong lives and all kinds of crazy stuff
[41:48] but we have a sure word of prophecy
[41:51] because the original message is very
[41:53] simple brother branham says over here in
[41:56] uh
[41:57] sirs we would see jesus 1963. now these
[42:00] greeks
[42:01] were not looking for a lecturer somebody
[42:04] put all the words in order and
[42:06] you know the right adjectives and no
[42:09] they weren't looking for a lecture in
[42:10] jesus christ they were looking for
[42:12] pulpit clowns
[42:13] brother brown says it's clear back in
[42:14] 63.
[42:16] because he could see his prophet and we
[42:19] have them
[42:20] i've seen them some are my friends
[42:23] they weren't looking for that they
[42:24] weren't looking for entertainers they
[42:26] wanted to see him the person jesus
[42:28] christ
[42:28] they longed to see him because they had
[42:30] heard of him so
[42:32] these greeks had seen
[42:35] a referee a reflection in in some people
[42:39] well that looks good let's go find the
[42:40] real thing they want to see jesus
[42:43] so chapter 16 verses 6 and 7
[42:48] we have now when they had gone
[42:50] throughout
[42:51] uh phrygia and the region of galatia
[42:54] they were forbidden
[42:56] by the holy ghost to preach the word in
[42:58] asia wow
[43:00] god closed doors yeah oh yeah verse 7
[43:04] after they were come to messiah they
[43:07] saved that means they
[43:08] they checked it out weighed out the
[43:10] circumstance so forth
[43:12] to go to bithynia but the spirit
[43:14] suffered them not
[43:16] god closed his doors and so they had
[43:19] some good ideas they had plans but god
[43:23] knows best we have plans we'd like to do
[43:27] this we'd like to do that
[43:29] but god shuts doors sometimes you know
[43:32] got to go this way and they were you
[43:35] know
[43:35] they were seeking the will of god they
[43:37] didn't want to make mistakes
[43:39] and uh the whole world needed to hear
[43:41] the gospel so where would it matter
[43:42] reach here preach over there no god has
[43:44] an
[43:44] order footsteps of the righteous are
[43:47] ordered of the lord
[43:49] because if we you know uh if we go out
[43:52] here and have a pizza tonight
[43:54] we might have different ideas tomorrow
[43:55] what we ought to do it happens
[43:58] we are what we eat like it or not hello
[44:03] and i've been stable some people they
[44:05] got this cute little dog now they only
[44:06] give him certain
[44:08] things people take better care of their
[44:11] animals than they do their kids
[44:13] you don't feed that dog cold french
[44:14] fries you know
[44:16] so we are what we eat and it affects our
[44:20] leadings and so forth you know so
[44:23] there's a time
[44:24] and a place for things to happen psalm
[44:27] 46 10 says
[44:28] be still zip it i'm god i know how i'm
[44:32] doing
[44:32] don't need your opinions so do not feel
[44:35] bad
[44:36] uh at god for permitting you to go
[44:39] through what looks like wasted years
[44:41] because we all have some wasted years
[44:42] we'd like to
[44:43] you know just forget and you know he
[44:46] brought you to the gospel at a certain
[44:47] time
[44:49] he does know what he's doing
[44:52] he knows what he's doing about those
[44:53] little kids he knows what he's doing
[44:55] about your neighbors
[44:56] and all this other stuff is all for your
[44:58] perfection
[45:00] so many times like today we desperately
[45:03] want to know the will of god in our life
[45:06] everybody wants to do right so they
[45:08] asked brother branham a question
[45:11] how do you feel is the best way to find
[45:12] the lord's will in some important
[45:14] matters
[45:16] well most of our things are important
[45:18] you know
[45:19] so here's his answer i tell you dear
[45:21] friend the best way to find the will of
[45:22] god in some important matters is prayer
[45:24] amen oh man we already knew that
[45:28] remember naaman mighty naaman arrogant
[45:31] naaman
[45:33] and the word of god says go get in the
[45:35] muddy water are you kidding oh we got
[45:37] clean water where i live
[45:38] no so we don't need your opinions he
[45:40] says prayer
[45:42] now here's the way i do it i take it
[45:43] before the lord and it's always been my
[45:45] strength
[45:45] i wait except we have prayer we got
[45:48] weight
[45:49] i wait upon the lord to see what he says
[45:51] and i just let
[45:52] myself be neutral and don't take either
[45:55] side
[45:55] now see that's very hard to do because
[45:58] when you want something
[46:01] yeah whatever it is we're not going to
[46:03] go down the list but
[46:05] you know we're humans we've got to have
[46:07] new something you know
[46:09] and it's got to be red maybe uh but you
[46:12] got to be
[46:13] neutral just lord whatever you say
[46:16] when you say it so if i was in your
[46:19] place and didn't have these visions from
[46:21] the lord
[46:22] i would just wait upon the lord and say
[46:25] lord
[46:25] you now you show me what's the decision
[46:27] to make and then when
[46:29] in the way you feel that do it then wait
[46:31] a little bit
[46:32] then wait oh what's all this weight
[46:35] we're important americans we got forty
[46:38] thousand dollar car out here
[46:40] and we got we you know we wanted coffee
[46:42] at that one place
[46:44] but there's 10 cars so we get upset
[46:47] we'll go across the street to mcdonald's
[46:49] you know we can't wait
[46:53] wait and wait a little longer see which
[46:55] side you lean towards
[46:56] and then say now father in my heart you
[46:58] know it does not matter
[47:00] but i want you i want to know what you
[47:03] say about it
[47:04] so we just patiently follow god
[47:08] you know things will turn out right and
[47:10] we learn that the hard way right brother
[47:12] paul
[47:12] yeah it's very hard sometimes so in
[47:15] verse 8 they're in
[47:16] troas it's a port city in modern turkey
[47:20] and in verse 9 they get the green light
[47:22] okay where are we at 16 and 9.
[47:24] in a vision uh and a vision appeared to
[47:28] paul in the night
[47:29] there stood a man of macedonia now how
[47:31] do you think he knew he was from
[47:32] macedonia you think he had a sign on his
[47:33] back
[47:34] no they dressed differently in each
[47:36] country just like our friends back here
[47:38] they dress differently than we do
[47:40] well obviously they didn't they weren't
[47:42] born here you know
[47:43] so they had a certain way of dressing
[47:45] certain hat whatever okay it's macedonia
[47:48] and in this vision he's saying come over
[47:50] to macedonia
[47:52] and after he had seen the vision
[47:54] immediately we endeavored to go to
[47:56] macedonia
[47:57] that means they found the boat that's
[47:59] going there you know they didn't just
[48:01] lord you take us well you got to do part
[48:03] of it yourself
[48:04] gathering the lord had called us to
[48:06] preach the gospel to them
[48:08] so they had the green light and it was
[48:11] time to
[48:12] move out and they sailed from troas it's
[48:15] verses 11 and 12
[48:16] over to philippi which is a roman
[48:18] settlement
[48:20] and verse 13 says here and on the
[48:23] sabbath
[48:24] now why why is that because that's when
[48:26] they had church
[48:28] okay you go when the door is open you
[48:30] don't stand out here on
[48:31] tuesday afternoon beating on the door
[48:33] what's wrong with these people no you
[48:34] come when there's church
[48:36] and you notice throughout this bible
[48:37] they got there on time too
[48:39] so um where are we at first um
[48:44] man i got lost myself verse 13 right on
[48:48] sabbath went
[48:49] out of the city what did they do down
[48:51] there by the riverside
[48:52] where prayer would want to be made and
[48:54] we sat down and spake unto the women
[48:57] which resorted theater so they they got
[48:59] the news that there's a bunch of women
[49:01] down there praying
[49:02] on the sabbath see when
[49:06] when jesus was here and you know back in
[49:09] those times
[49:09] there was a temple in jerusalem and
[49:12] that's where
[49:13] everybody went well then the romans
[49:15] destroyed the temple
[49:17] and after that they had synagogues is
[49:19] there one here in town
[49:21] any jews live here boys the big city
[49:25] so there's synagogues everywhere that's
[49:28] at least
[49:29] 10 men believers can form a synagogue
[49:32] so these women apparently was no
[49:34] synagogue there and they were
[49:36] they were believers they were gathered
[49:37] down by the riverside so they go down
[49:39] there
[49:40] and these missionaries
[49:44] they branched out you know you got to be
[49:46] flexible in the work of the lord
[49:48] can't always have a tie on you know like
[49:50] last night well it doesn't matter
[49:52] we're gonna look nice you know so they
[49:54] branched out down to a group of women by
[49:56] the riverside on the sabbath
[49:58] normally a place where they would gather
[50:00] to work you know that's where they wash
[50:02] clothes and but today they're praying
[50:05] so god was answering their prayer
[50:07] bringing the good news to him
[50:09] first they've ever heard of all this
[50:10] stuff all they knew up to then was
[50:12] repeating what their prophet had said
[50:14] moses said moses said and yesterday
[50:17] being the sabbath
[50:18] in every synagogue in the world they
[50:20] quoted a part of their prophet's words
[50:24] sorry over there in verse uh in chapter
[50:27] 15. it tells about that
[50:28] but um this was a simple meeting at the
[50:32] riverside
[50:32] and it was the first step of the gospel
[50:36] coming westward towards america
[50:39] towards nampa yeah
[50:42] it started someplace well it started
[50:44] right there with those women at the
[50:45] riverside
[50:46] verse 14. a certain woman named lydia
[50:51] is seller of purple i see it's full of
[50:54] details
[50:55] all you got to do is get in and read it
[50:58] that's why we're going over because
[50:59] people don't read the bible
[51:00] seller of purple of the city of thyatira
[51:04] i thought they were macedonia yeah well
[51:07] it goes on to tell us that
[51:09] she was of that tyrant she worshiped god
[51:11] and she heard us
[51:12] and her heart was open and she attended
[51:16] to the things which were spoken of paul
[51:18] and when she was baptized okay so they
[51:20] got all the way to baptism
[51:22] she's baptized and her household
[51:25] cb thought she thought beside us saying
[51:29] um if you've judged me to be faithful
[51:32] to the lord come into my house and abide
[51:35] there and she
[51:36] constrained us in other words she begged
[51:38] us to come to her house
[51:40] so she's the first convert
[51:43] in the west to accept the message of the
[51:45] hour and
[51:48] she hosted the first church in europe
[51:51] in her home and she lived in philippi
[51:54] which is modern greece
[51:55] but she had moved there from thyatira
[51:58] now she was a merchant
[51:59] she had a business and she sold
[52:03] bolts of fabric she had a cloth store
[52:06] you know fabric store
[52:07] and her specialty was cloth dyed
[52:10] purple very important
[52:15] now purple came from murics that's a
[52:19] shellfish found only along the north
[52:22] eastern coast of the mediterranean sea
[52:25] very specific and it was most expensive
[52:28] of all the dyes at the time
[52:30] a mark of wealth or royalty
[52:34] purple cloth was ranked in value with
[52:36] gold
[52:37] it was used for emperors and temples so
[52:40] she had a specific
[52:42] job so her conversion didn't change her
[52:45] occupation
[52:46] but it dramatically changed her loyalty
[52:49] okay
[52:50] she was a real christian she was in love
[52:51] with jesus christ it wasn't just a
[52:53] matter of repeating what prophet said
[52:55] you got to have a life
[52:58] okay so she begged paul to stay with a
[53:01] few days
[53:02] and um but you know there's the twin
[53:06] now when we think of twins i don't see
[53:08] any here but
[53:09] are there any twins back here no well
[53:11] twins are normally
[53:13] uh we're attracted to them because they
[53:15] look alike you know
[53:17] i i met some twins no i think it was in
[53:20] venezuela
[53:21] and i asked them some well we're only
[53:23] five you know with a joint thing you
[53:26] know
[53:27] and so we think of of uh equal twins you
[53:30] know like
[53:31] they look the same but in our case here
[53:33] in the scripture there's the pretty and
[53:35] there's the ugly they're
[53:36] very different but they're twins so
[53:38] whenever god does something
[53:39] the other twin shows up yeah
[53:43] and uh they're at every revival you can
[53:45] just expect it
[53:47] verse 16 of chapter six and it came to
[53:50] pass as we went to prayer
[53:52] a certain damsel that's a girl possessed
[53:55] with a spirit of divination that means
[53:56] she was played with cards and
[53:58] and uh crystal ball you know all this
[54:01] from the dark side
[54:03] um she met us and she brought her
[54:07] masters much gain
[54:08] by suits saying you know telling
[54:10] fortunes and such
[54:12] and this girl followed paul and cried
[54:15] every day
[54:17] these men are servants of the most high
[54:19] god which show us the way of salvation
[54:21] and we know people that would just love
[54:24] that free advertisement
[54:27] but that's not paul you know every day
[54:31] these
[54:31] men show us the way of salvation and it
[54:34] was getting on their nerves
[54:35] so verse 18 and this she did for many
[54:39] days
[54:40] but paul being grieved now paul was a
[54:42] nice guy
[54:43] but you wouldn't want to push him too
[54:44] far because he was
[54:47] he was short and he had hooked nose and
[54:49] he had a temper
[54:51] and he was sarcastic so it'd be nice to
[54:54] be his friend
[54:55] so when he got upset watch out
[54:59] paul being grieved turned and said to
[55:02] the spirit
[55:02] i command thee in the name jesus christ
[55:04] to come out of her and he came out of
[55:06] her
[55:07] the same hour okay so
[55:10] he obeyed because guess what hebrews 13
[55:13] 8 was real see we use it for rubber
[55:16] stamp no
[55:17] it's got to be shown out in somebody's
[55:20] life
[55:21] whether you smile don't smile it's going
[55:23] about react in somebody's life
[55:25] today you see and so
[55:29] 19 they have some problems and when her
[55:31] masters
[55:32] so she was she was owned by a syndicate
[55:34] okay
[55:35] so when her master saw that the hope of
[55:37] their gains was gone
[55:39] disappeared they caught paul and silas
[55:43] and they brought them into the
[55:44] marketplace to the elders or the rulers
[55:46] in other words just like a um
[55:49] like court but not quite and um so the
[55:53] slave girl you know she's a fortune
[55:54] teller
[55:55] she was caught in that bondage and
[55:59] she you know by her powers she was
[56:02] earning money for these people
[56:04] now they caught these two troublemakers
[56:07] and they brought him to the magistrates
[56:08] saying
[56:09] these men being jews exceedingly trouble
[56:12] our city
[56:14] no they troubled your your bank accounts
[56:16] with the trouble they're not troubling
[56:17] the city so much
[56:18] you know they couldn't even lie right
[56:21] and they brought them to the magistrates
[56:23] okay
[56:23] 21 and they teach customs which are not
[56:26] lawful for us to receive neither to
[56:29] observe
[56:30] being romans really so when the revenue
[56:34] ceased
[56:35] you know they were mad at god's servants
[56:37] they took them before the authorities
[56:38] and just like today guess what happened
[56:40] the system
[56:41] was corrupt and
[56:44] so they were all friends they stripped
[56:47] them down they beat up god's servants
[56:48] they put them in jail
[56:50] what we got in verse 24 here and having
[56:53] received such a charge they thrust them
[56:55] into the inner chur
[56:56] under the inner prison and they put
[56:58] their feet in stocks
[56:59] and everybody under 50 probably doesn't
[57:01] know what stocks are but it's two pieces
[57:03] of wood with little holes
[57:04] you put your feet in there and you can't
[57:07] move because there's two boards
[57:09] okay so they're not going anywhere
[57:12] and um so now they're in jail and
[57:16] paul and silas are they are they trying
[57:18] to call mother
[57:20] are they trying to call jerusalem hey
[57:22] what should we do now
[57:24] no it says they were praying and singing
[57:27] you create your own personal atmosphere
[57:32] now you want to be miserable well go
[57:33] ahead but
[57:35] i don't want to talk about it i don't
[57:36] want to see you create your own personal
[57:39] atmosphere
[57:40] now a couple years ago when the planes
[57:44] were crowded
[57:46] they're not crowded now uh i was sitting
[57:49] against the window over here
[57:51] and two rows up and the window over
[57:52] there there was a you know
[57:54] young guy with his mother's money
[57:57] probably
[57:58] and he had the headphones on and he had
[57:59] the music going and it was disturbing me
[58:02] that far away
[58:03] you ever know anybody like that and they
[58:06] ride their cars out here the same way
[58:08] well in those cases what are you gonna
[58:10] do make a scene hey
[58:12] no you just block it out and you hum
[58:15] your own song you create your own
[58:16] atmosphere
[58:17] you know and that's what they were doing
[58:20] yeah
[58:21] try it sometime so all of a sudden while
[58:23] they're singing
[58:24] now remember this is nighttime they
[58:26] don't have these kind of lights
[58:28] it's dark and they're just singing
[58:30] praying lord you see our situation
[58:32] praise the lord we're counted worthy to
[58:35] suffer for your name's sake
[58:36] these people don't know what they're
[58:37] doing but it's okay
[58:39] all of a sudden god sends an earthquake
[58:43] and it wasn't just an earthquake it
[58:44] shook the foundations of the jail
[58:46] and those stocks you know come loose
[58:49] and their hands are free you know
[58:52] you know just praise the lord so it was
[58:55] more than an earthquake
[58:56] so the jailer lived right there so the
[59:00] jailer is
[59:01] woken from his sleep and he sees the
[59:03] prison doors open
[59:05] and what do you think his first thought
[59:06] was go catch the prisoners
[59:09] no uh call the national guard no
[59:14] no just just fall on your sword you know
[59:16] prisoners all gone
[59:18] i'm responsible i'm a total failure i'll
[59:20] just
[59:21] out of my misery well what happened to
[59:23] verse 28 here
[59:25] but paul cried with a loud voice
[59:27] remember it's dark
[59:29] it must been a little light do yourself
[59:31] no harm we're all right here
[59:33] then he called for a light and sprang in
[59:36] and came trembling and fell down before
[59:38] paul and silas
[59:39] so he realized something is different
[59:41] about these guys
[59:43] and they brought them out and said sir
[59:45] what must i do to be saved
[59:47] well there's probably a little more to
[59:48] the story there you know but
[59:51] they're giving us the highlights because
[59:53] okay you guys are different
[59:54] now why didn't you run away and well
[59:56] we're servants of the most high oh what
[59:58] can i do i want to be like you guys
[1:00:00] right and so um
[1:00:03] uh whatever it is you have that's what i
[1:00:05] want so verse 31
[1:00:07] and they said all you gotta do is
[1:00:08] believe on the lord jesus christ
[1:00:11] and you shall be saved and thy house
[1:00:14] and they spake unto him the word of the
[1:00:16] lord and all that were in his house so
[1:00:18] they're having church
[1:00:20] and it took them the same hour of the
[1:00:21] night washed their stripes
[1:00:23] you know where they've been beat and
[1:00:26] they were baptized
[1:00:28] all this is done in the middle of the
[1:00:29] night like right now not when it's
[1:00:31] convenient
[1:00:32] right now yeah very amazing
[1:00:35] and um uh baptized
[1:00:38] and when they brought them into his
[1:00:40] house he said
[1:00:42] give him some lunch you know and rejoice
[1:00:45] believing in god
[1:00:46] with all his house well it's amazing
[1:00:50] so then the sun comes up it's morning
[1:00:52] and when it was day the magistrates
[1:00:54] sent the sergeants saying okay you know
[1:00:57] kept them in
[1:00:58] jail overnight now they let them go
[1:01:01] but not so fast hello
[1:01:05] the keeper of the prison told this to
[1:01:06] paul the magistrates
[1:01:08] let you go and now you can go in peace
[1:01:10] but paul said unto them
[1:01:11] uh hello they beat us openly
[1:01:14] uncondemned being romans hello
[1:01:17] and they thought us in prison now they
[1:01:20] want us to go out privately
[1:01:22] no no no they must come here and open
[1:01:25] the gate themselves and let us out
[1:01:28] and the sergeant told the words to the
[1:01:29] magistrates and
[1:01:31] when they heard they were romans oh they
[1:01:33] got scared then
[1:01:34] you know somebody important might find
[1:01:36] about find out about this
[1:01:38] so they came down and they let them go
[1:01:40] and say you know please leave
[1:01:42] so the prisons and ruins they're
[1:01:45] enjoying fellowship with the warden's
[1:01:47] house
[1:01:48] enjoying the blessings of god but they
[1:01:51] sat in prison
[1:01:52] waiting for the officials and so they
[1:01:55] left town they went to lydia's house
[1:01:57] and they had fellowship and there's that
[1:01:59] and much more
[1:02:00] in that chapter so take your time and
[1:02:03] read it
[1:02:04] because i don't know if you remember but
[1:02:06] i did bring
[1:02:07] a level
[1:02:13] i think it's the whole building it's off
[1:02:15] [Laughter]
[1:02:19] but um there's four steps to achieve
[1:02:21] balance in your life
[1:02:23] one every day everybody has got to read
[1:02:26] one
[1:02:27] chapter out of the bible minimum
[1:02:31] number two one page out of the church
[1:02:34] age book
[1:02:34] it will not hurt you i don't care what
[1:02:36] they told you
[1:02:37] number three you listen to at least 20
[1:02:41] minutes of god's profit
[1:02:43] now you can do that between when you get
[1:02:45] in your car and when you get to work
[1:02:46] it's real simple then you
[1:02:48] take your mind off the bad traffic and
[1:02:50] number four you pray at all times
[1:02:52] so you do those four things during your
[1:02:54] waking hours and you will achieve
[1:02:56] balance in your life
[1:02:57] and you will be blessed and the church
[1:02:58] will be blessed
[1:03:00] okay chapter 17 and i don't see any
[1:03:04] clock so
[1:03:05] praise the lord well it's right here now
[1:03:08] we'll be out before lunch don't worry
[1:03:10] so chapter 17 verse one now when they
[1:03:13] had passed through
[1:03:14] em to polis in apollonia they came to
[1:03:18] thessalonica
[1:03:19] and there was a synagogue of the jews
[1:03:21] here we go again going to church
[1:03:23] and paul as was his manner
[1:03:27] went to them three sabbaths in a week
[1:03:30] you know
[1:03:30] in a row and reasoned with them
[1:03:34] out of the scriptures now what you got
[1:03:35] to understand they did not have a new
[1:03:37] testament okay
[1:03:38] it wasn't written all they had was the
[1:03:42] we're not going to ask but there's 39
[1:03:44] books in the old testament
[1:03:45] and 27 in the new testament making up
[1:03:47] 66. so they had
[1:03:49] their old testament which was a
[1:03:52] translation that had been done in
[1:03:53] alexandria
[1:03:54] egypt it was about 200 years old so they
[1:03:58] had something in hebrew
[1:03:59] and that's what they studied and so he
[1:04:01] goes down there and he
[1:04:02] just reasons with them what was the
[1:04:04] point
[1:04:05] this day these scriptures have been
[1:04:07] fulfilled you all didn't know about it
[1:04:09] i'm here to tell you about it
[1:04:10] see so out of the scriptures
[1:04:13] opening and alleging that christ must
[1:04:16] needs have suffered
[1:04:17] and risen from the dead and that this
[1:04:20] jesus whom i preached to you
[1:04:22] is the christ yes simple simple
[1:04:25] gospel and here again today we got a
[1:04:28] simple gospel
[1:04:30] it didn't say go figure it out on your
[1:04:32] own i said only believe
[1:04:35] it's not difficult
[1:04:38] and some of them believed and consorted
[1:04:41] with paul and silas
[1:04:43] and the devout greeks a great multitude
[1:04:46] and of the chief women not a few so they
[1:04:49] were important women
[1:04:50] they also believed so paul's party they
[1:04:53] move on to thessalonica the capital city
[1:04:55] of macedonia
[1:04:57] and this important city was named in
[1:05:00] honor of a woman
[1:05:02] the sister of alexander the great okay
[1:05:04] they were both children of philip ii of
[1:05:07] macedonia
[1:05:08] and there was you know the synagogue
[1:05:11] and so they they reasoned
[1:05:15] with them from the scriptures
[1:05:17] demonstrating the simplicity of the
[1:05:19] gospel
[1:05:21] showing openly we're not going to read
[1:05:22] the whole thing i'll just give you a
[1:05:24] rundown here they had um had
[1:05:27] probably six points to his message that
[1:05:29] according to the scriptures the messiah
[1:05:31] had to suffer and rise again
[1:05:33] jesus nazareth was that very messiah
[1:05:37] and the possible title of his message
[1:05:39] could have been this day
[1:05:41] these scriptures have been fulfilled so
[1:05:44] he knew what he was talking about
[1:05:45] because he'd received it by revelation
[1:05:47] see he didn't have to call back for part
[1:05:49] two no he received a
[1:05:50] revelation that's right and uh he was
[1:05:54] very well ver
[1:05:55] very well worse in the scriptures ready
[1:05:57] and willing to speak to anybody who
[1:05:59] would listen
[1:06:00] uh many believed even the well-known
[1:06:02] women
[1:06:03] god was on the scene revealing himself
[1:06:06] to people
[1:06:07] to the ministry of repeating
[1:06:10] no preaching the gospel there's a
[1:06:13] difference people
[1:06:14] we have no place in our glorious message
[1:06:18] of 1200 recordings the brother random
[1:06:20] says now get together and press play
[1:06:22] it doesn't say that amen
[1:06:27] the big thing about brother brown's
[1:06:28] message is it's exactly
[1:06:31] a pattern of paul's message because
[1:06:33] beyond the curtain of time
[1:06:35] okay so the women had long hair and all
[1:06:38] these great
[1:06:39] beautiful things he couldn't even hardly
[1:06:40] describe
[1:06:42] but the key point of that whole
[1:06:44] experience beyond the current time
[1:06:47] is that the angel said now you're going
[1:06:48] to judge what you said
[1:06:50] what about paul well he's going to be
[1:06:52] judged too well then i preached exactly
[1:06:54] what he preached so
[1:06:55] everything's okay and all of us that
[1:06:56] were there
[1:06:58] were depending on that that you preached
[1:07:01] according to paul
[1:07:02] because we're part of uh what is
[1:07:04] ephesians 1 galatians 1 8
[1:07:06] if any any other thing comes along
[1:07:09] different what i've told you it's wrong
[1:07:11] and how many things have we seen using
[1:07:14] this same bible
[1:07:16] so it's very important that we
[1:07:19] stick with the truth so he knew what he
[1:07:22] was talking about he received a
[1:07:24] revelation
[1:07:25] and many believed and
[1:07:28] god was revealing to the people to the
[1:07:30] ministry of the preaching of the gospel
[1:07:33] but guess what the twin came along
[1:07:37] every time 17-5
[1:07:40] but the jews which believed not okay the
[1:07:42] unbelievers
[1:07:43] they were envious upset
[1:07:46] they took certain lewd fellows that's
[1:07:49] rednecks
[1:07:50] okay these are people off the street
[1:07:53] of the base of sword there you go and
[1:07:55] gathered a company and set all the city
[1:07:57] an uproar confusion
[1:07:59] and assaulted the house of jason why
[1:08:02] because they were staying at jason's
[1:08:03] house
[1:08:04] hey get those guys out here and when
[1:08:06] they found them not
[1:08:07] they took jason yeah well you'll do and
[1:08:10] um in certain ruler certain brethren
[1:08:13] unto the rulers of the city crying
[1:08:16] these have turned the world upside down
[1:08:18] and they've come here also
[1:08:20] nothing but confusion amen right
[1:08:23] verse 7 and whom jason hath received so
[1:08:27] they were staying at his house
[1:08:28] and these all are doing contrary to the
[1:08:31] decrees of caesar
[1:08:32] lies saying that there's another king
[1:08:35] one jesus and they troubled the people
[1:08:38] and the rulers of the city
[1:08:40] when they heard these things and when
[1:08:42] they had taken
[1:08:43] security ah jason put money under the
[1:08:47] table
[1:08:48] yeah yeah he said this is pretty hot
[1:08:52] potato here i'm going to give you all
[1:08:53] 100
[1:08:53] and let me go sure enough it's right
[1:08:56] there that didn't start here it didn't
[1:08:57] start in mexico it didn't start in
[1:08:58] africa
[1:08:59] it's clear back there give them some
[1:09:01] money everything's okay
[1:09:04] yeah amazing let them go
[1:09:08] so the same thing happened to paul and
[1:09:10] barnabas in
[1:09:11] in 13 45
[1:09:15] jealousy anointed the unbelievers
[1:09:18] they just can't stand it when there's a
[1:09:20] blessing over there and they didn't
[1:09:21] initiate it you know
[1:09:23] and um the the unbelievers and so they
[1:09:26] gathered some street people
[1:09:28] they formed a mob causing civil
[1:09:30] disturbances
[1:09:32] that sounds like usma
[1:09:36] clear back there doing the same thing
[1:09:38] organized confusion
[1:09:41] and um so he gave him some money out
[1:09:44] they go
[1:09:45] so what they do they've moved on forget
[1:09:47] this place
[1:09:48] and they were received many believe look
[1:09:50] at verse 11
[1:09:53] these were more noble than those in
[1:09:55] thessalonica
[1:09:57] in that they received the word with all
[1:09:59] readiness of mind yes
[1:10:01] and searched the scriptures every day
[1:10:05] they read that chapter every day like i
[1:10:06] told you search the scriptures daily
[1:10:09] see if these things were so let's see if
[1:10:11] they're telling the truth or not
[1:10:13] you know they checked it out verse 12.
[1:10:16] therefore many of them believed also of
[1:10:18] honorable women there you go again
[1:10:20] and men not a few so things were
[1:10:23] happening
[1:10:24] the troublemakers and agnostics they had
[1:10:26] free time and they followed them because
[1:10:28] in verse 13
[1:10:30] but when the jews of thessalonica those
[1:10:32] troublemakers down there
[1:10:33] had knowledge that the word of god was
[1:10:36] preached
[1:10:36] of paul at berea they came through there
[1:10:40] also
[1:10:40] and stirred up the people
[1:10:43] brother brown says the agnostics the
[1:10:46] troublemakers they're going to get worse
[1:10:47] and worse and worse they're not going
[1:10:50] away
[1:10:51] we're not watching them we're watching
[1:10:52] god and we're here we are in the same
[1:10:55] thing
[1:10:57] and immediately the brethren went sent
[1:11:00] away paul to go
[1:11:01] uh to go as it were
[1:11:04] to the sea but silas and timothy are
[1:11:06] both there still
[1:11:07] okay so paul was taken away for his
[1:11:10] safety
[1:11:11] okay they took him to athens that's 200
[1:11:14] miles south
[1:11:15] timothy and silas stayed in berea they
[1:11:18] were ministering
[1:11:19] but when paul reached athens he told his
[1:11:22] friends
[1:11:22] go back and you know timothy and silas
[1:11:26] and tell them to come quickly okay so
[1:11:28] verse 16
[1:11:31] while paul waited for them in athens his
[1:11:33] spirit was stirred in him
[1:11:35] yeah when he saw the city given to
[1:11:38] idolatry
[1:11:40] and that's why i get upset when i see
[1:11:42] idolatry
[1:11:44] because i know people right now today
[1:11:48] not 10 years ago right now burning
[1:11:51] candles to the picture of god's prophet
[1:11:56] yeah there's people with candles on this
[1:11:58] picture they're nothing
[1:12:00] but catholics they're not converted they
[1:12:03] just got a new saint to put a picture to
[1:12:05] it's happening and it happens in many
[1:12:08] different ways be careful that's right
[1:12:12] so where are we at here 17.
[1:12:15] therefore he disputed now that doesn't
[1:12:17] mean he went out arguing getting in
[1:12:19] their face
[1:12:19] that means he reasoned reasonably from
[1:12:21] the scriptures you see
[1:12:23] in the synagogue with the jews and with
[1:12:25] the devout people
[1:12:27] and in the market daily with them that
[1:12:29] would listen
[1:12:31] yeah so
[1:12:34] he was just asking questions he was
[1:12:36] reasoning keeping busy while waiting for
[1:12:38] his associates
[1:12:39] now paul was very good at speaking in
[1:12:42] public
[1:12:43] he was also very flexible it wasn't
[1:12:46] always in a church setting
[1:12:48] in athens he addressed the religious
[1:12:51] jews in the synagogue
[1:12:52] and then he addressed the regular greek
[1:12:54] citizens at the
[1:12:56] uh supreme tribunal and in the
[1:12:59] marketplace where
[1:13:00] all the people were but what really had
[1:13:02] him upset was the idolatry that he saw
[1:13:04] in all these places
[1:13:06] okay something that plagued humanity
[1:13:09] since the garden of eden
[1:13:10] and it's only got worse now
[1:13:13] those are making notes first samuel
[1:13:16] chapter 15.
[1:13:17] samuel the prophet also had to do had to
[1:13:21] you know deliver bad news to king saul
[1:13:23] in verse 23 of
[1:13:24] first samuel 15. rebellion
[1:13:28] and surely you know about rebellion if
[1:13:30] you raise children you know what
[1:13:31] rebellion is
[1:13:33] rebellion is equal to the sin of
[1:13:35] witchcraft
[1:13:36] and stubbornness is as or equal to
[1:13:40] idolatry bad stuff
[1:13:44] now my wife who's been gone i think 15
[1:13:47] years god rest her soul
[1:13:49] but she had a way of dealing with things
[1:13:52] her mother was you know pretty much
[1:13:54] german no fingerprints on my piano in my
[1:13:56] refrigerator well
[1:13:58] out of here and so rebecca said there's
[1:14:01] things in children
[1:14:03] that have to be beat out of them
[1:14:07] they come hardwired from the factory
[1:14:09] with certain things that have to be beat
[1:14:10] out
[1:14:12] and this is it rebellion stubbornness
[1:14:14] iniquity idolatry
[1:14:16] that's right are all the same you see
[1:14:19] because thou has rejected the word of
[1:14:20] the lord
[1:14:21] god has rejected you being king so
[1:14:24] rebellion stubbornness equal to idolatry
[1:14:26] not from god
[1:14:29] now you might think that
[1:14:33] idolatry is only amongst the heathen or
[1:14:36] amongst the catholics
[1:14:39] our prophet has the answer reaction to
[1:14:42] action 1959
[1:14:44] our nation now this is way back
[1:14:48] what would he say today our nation is
[1:14:51] greatly covered over with idolatry
[1:14:54] we might not think uh we might
[1:14:58] we'll say here uh
[1:15:02] we might not worship wooden animals and
[1:15:03] so forth as we would like to think of
[1:15:05] idolatry
[1:15:06] but that's not all idolatry consists of
[1:15:09] we sometimes make our automobiles
[1:15:12] and our clothes oh
[1:15:16] and the things we do we put as idols
[1:15:19] anything between you
[1:15:20] and god is an idol you see
[1:15:24] sometimes we make our church an idol we
[1:15:27] should never do that
[1:15:28] god is the only one we should worship
[1:15:31] so um in another place
[1:15:35] he's in the uh he's he's in the in the
[1:15:38] pulpit you know preaching
[1:15:39] and this lady comes up in the prayer
[1:15:41] line and she's got this picture
[1:15:43] and he says i see you have one of the
[1:15:44] pictures well that's fine
[1:15:46] i just want to speak with you for a
[1:15:48] moment i suppose we're strangers so
[1:15:49] forth
[1:15:50] but our lord knows you and he knows me
[1:15:53] and let's talk about the picture for
[1:15:54] just a moment
[1:15:56] okay so he's he's going to talk about
[1:15:58] the picture
[1:15:59] now this is important he says the pillar
[1:16:03] of fire that you see there
[1:16:04] everybody sees pillar fire right now we
[1:16:06] got some friends that have said that's a
[1:16:08] reflection well
[1:16:10] they're just they're gonna hold deeper
[1:16:11] every day and if you want to waste your
[1:16:13] time and your life and your soul
[1:16:14] go talk to them i know them it's waste
[1:16:17] time
[1:16:18] the pillar of fire you see there some
[1:16:19] time ago was a miracle performed
[1:16:21] a lady put the picture in her frame she
[1:16:23] had it on the
[1:16:24] in other words on the table beside her
[1:16:26] bed at the hospital
[1:16:27] and she was looking not at me of course
[1:16:30] but at the pillar of fire
[1:16:32] and this is her testimony the doctor had
[1:16:34] given her hop to die
[1:16:36] she claimed that the pillar fire came
[1:16:38] off the picture
[1:16:39] and hung over her two years late two
[1:16:42] days later she was dismissed went home
[1:16:43] well
[1:16:45] just a lady praying you know
[1:16:49] so um brother braham says right in the
[1:16:53] middle of the road
[1:16:54] is the true sound unadulterated gospel
[1:16:56] and power of god
[1:16:58] that's why we bring this to your
[1:16:59] attention so you can have a visual
[1:17:02] not over there not over here center of
[1:17:04] the road
[1:17:05] so we must find a way to stay
[1:17:09] balanced why because extremes are
[1:17:12] dangerous
[1:17:15] i was raised in mexico i know what
[1:17:17] catholicism is
[1:17:19] candles beads all that stuff
[1:17:23] and i was in colombia i think it was
[1:17:26] maybe two years ago and in this one
[1:17:29] church
[1:17:30] they've got a little statue and they
[1:17:32] claim that
[1:17:33] the beard on jesus face it grows every
[1:17:36] year
[1:17:36] not a wooden statue well i don't know
[1:17:39] maybe it does maybe it doesn't but we're
[1:17:42] not going to worship it
[1:17:44] and instead of wax candles they've come
[1:17:47] down to a bunch of little christmas
[1:17:48] lights
[1:17:50] no money involved don't have to lighten
[1:17:52] up to make new candles just plug it in
[1:17:54] so anytime i see lights has to do with
[1:17:57] the gospel
[1:17:58] something's not right here you know so
[1:18:01] extremes
[1:18:02] are dangerous okay
[1:18:05] verse 18 of chapter 17
[1:18:08] uh then certain philosophers of the
[1:18:11] epicureans
[1:18:12] and of the stoics encountered him so
[1:18:15] they come up against paul
[1:18:17] and some said what will this babbler say
[1:18:20] now these people in greece they had a
[1:18:21] lot of free time
[1:18:22] you know this was the height of their
[1:18:24] civilization
[1:18:26] and what's this this guy he's talking a
[1:18:27] lot let's see what he's got to say
[1:18:29] uh he seems to be a setter forth of
[1:18:31] estranged gods
[1:18:33] because he preached unto them jesus and
[1:18:35] the resurrection
[1:18:38] verse 19. and they took him and brought
[1:18:41] him to the arapagas
[1:18:42] saying maybe know what new doctrine
[1:18:45] whereof that you're speaking of in other
[1:18:47] words we'd like to know what you've got
[1:18:48] we like new things for thou bringeth
[1:18:50] certain strange things to our ears
[1:18:52] we would know therefore what these
[1:18:54] things mean and in parentheses
[1:18:57] for all of the people in athens and
[1:18:59] strangers which were there
[1:19:01] spent their time in nothing else but
[1:19:03] either to tell
[1:19:04] or to hear some new thing city full of
[1:19:08] gossipers
[1:19:09] not really to learn just what's new you
[1:19:11] know bouncing off of me
[1:19:12] you know so
[1:19:16] um so he ran into these people and today
[1:19:19] we would call them
[1:19:19] scientologists and humanists okay
[1:19:23] but in 22-32 he spoke a masterpiece to
[1:19:27] refute
[1:19:27] both of their theories uh
[1:19:31] anointed of the holy ghost he spoke
[1:19:32] boldly let's look at 22 for example
[1:19:36] then paul stood in the midst of mars
[1:19:38] hill it's still there today
[1:19:40] you madame athens i perceive that all
[1:19:43] things you're way
[1:19:44] too superstitious for as i was walking
[1:19:47] around the park here
[1:19:48] passing by i saw your many devotions so
[1:19:51] they were you know worshiping these
[1:19:53] these statues and things i found this
[1:19:56] one inscription down there
[1:19:58] to the unknown god whom therefore ye
[1:20:01] ignorantly worship him but i know him
[1:20:04] i'm here to tell you about him
[1:20:06] you see they had all these others and
[1:20:08] they kind of knew this was for that and
[1:20:09] the other
[1:20:10] but okay to the unknown god in case we
[1:20:11] missed anything this will cover it all
[1:20:14] but guess what i know him amen
[1:20:18] i'm gonna tell you about him you know
[1:20:20] okay
[1:20:21] and um so god that made the world on all
[1:20:25] the things
[1:20:25] seeing that he is lord of heaven and
[1:20:27] earth dwelleth not in temples made of
[1:20:29] hands
[1:20:30] neither is worshipped with men's hands
[1:20:32] as though he needed some
[1:20:34] anything seeing he giveth to all life
[1:20:37] and breath and things
[1:20:39] and hath made of one blood all nations
[1:20:41] of men for
[1:20:43] uh to dwell on the face of the earth and
[1:20:45] determine the times
[1:20:47] therefore have determined before the
[1:20:49] point
[1:20:50] uh the bounds of their habitation that
[1:20:52] they should seek the lord
[1:20:54] if happily they might feel after him and
[1:20:56] find him
[1:20:57] though he be not far away from every one
[1:20:59] of us
[1:21:01] for in him we live and move and have our
[1:21:03] being as certain also
[1:21:05] of your own poets so he knew literature
[1:21:08] and he wasn't a dummy
[1:21:10] he's quoting reports for we are also his
[1:21:13] offspring
[1:21:14] for as much then as we are the offspring
[1:21:17] of god
[1:21:18] we ought not to think of the godhead
[1:21:21] is like unto gold or silver or stone or
[1:21:24] graven image
[1:21:25] graven art a man's device and the times
[1:21:29] of this ignorance god winked up you know
[1:21:30] he let it go after
[1:21:31] before but now he commandeth all men
[1:21:34] everywhere
[1:21:35] to repent that's the message
[1:21:39] because he has appointed a day in which
[1:21:41] he will judge the world in righteousness
[1:21:44] by that man whom he hath ordained
[1:21:48] wherefore whereof he hath given
[1:21:50] assurance unto all men
[1:21:52] in that he hath raised him from the dead
[1:21:56] see this is news to them they didn't
[1:21:58] have internet they didn't have
[1:21:59] newspapers and he's out here telling
[1:22:01] this guy died and he rose again
[1:22:03] that's the fulfillment of all these
[1:22:04] scriptures you know
[1:22:06] so it's the it's it's the gospel
[1:22:09] and uh some believed some did not
[1:22:13] but see i've got this other bible so
[1:22:16] we're going to be here a while because
[1:22:16] i've got two bibles and
[1:22:18] lots of notes brother brown spoke of a
[1:22:20] man named george lomza
[1:22:22] if you ever get a chance to buy a llamas
[1:22:24] a bible it's
[1:22:25] the same gospel just with a few other
[1:22:28] little words to make it more colorful
[1:22:30] so galatians 1 uh
[1:22:34] in this bible you look at yours and i'll
[1:22:36] read it from here
[1:22:38] let's see here galatians chapter 1
[1:22:41] and verse 6.
[1:22:47] i am surprised how soon you have turned
[1:22:49] to another gospel away from christ who
[1:22:51] has called you by his grace
[1:22:54] a gospel which does not even exist in
[1:22:56] other words it's a zero
[1:22:58] how be it there are men who have stirred
[1:23:02] you up
[1:23:03] and want to pervert the gospel of christ
[1:23:06] but though we
[1:23:07] ourselves or an angel from heaven
[1:23:09] preached any other gospel to you
[1:23:12] than that which we have preached to you
[1:23:14] let him be accursed
[1:23:16] in other words he's going straight to
[1:23:17] the hot place
[1:23:21] it doesn't get much more plain or does
[1:23:22] it so
[1:23:26] brother paul was reasoning with them
[1:23:28] from the scriptures demonstrating the
[1:23:29] simplicity of the gospel
[1:23:31] showing openly from their scriptures
[1:23:34] and that according to scriptures the
[1:23:37] messiah had to suffer
[1:23:38] and rise again amen jesus of nazareth
[1:23:42] was that very messiah real simple
[1:23:46] so his possible title could have been
[1:23:48] this day
[1:23:49] this scripture has been fulfilled so
[1:23:52] anyway
[1:23:52] in your spare time read first
[1:23:54] corinthians i mean first samuel 15
[1:23:57] and um i'll tell you all about rebellion
[1:24:00] stubbornness so forth
[1:24:02] they're not from god and so we're going
[1:24:04] to take one more chapter
[1:24:06] don't go to sleep yet children party's
[1:24:09] not over yet
[1:24:11] so in chapter 18 paul and silas his
[1:24:13] trusted associate
[1:24:14] now they're in the midst of their second
[1:24:16] missionary journey
[1:24:17] now in the three missionary journeys
[1:24:19] that paul took he did a lot of walking
[1:24:21] sometimes he's on a donkey whatever
[1:24:24] never did he have a car i might have had
[1:24:26] a horse sometimes
[1:24:28] but in in 30 years he traveled about 10
[1:24:31] 000 miles
[1:24:33] and never got you know over 500 miles
[1:24:35] from the house
[1:24:37] so the dates about 49 a.d he
[1:24:40] at this point at 18 of acts he's already
[1:24:44] written the
[1:24:46] letter to the galatians and also the
[1:24:48] letter has already been written to the
[1:24:50] 12 tribes
[1:24:51] which we call the epistle of james
[1:24:54] but in verse 1 of 18 after these things
[1:24:57] paul departed from athens and came to
[1:24:59] corinth
[1:25:01] now corinth is about 20 miles west of
[1:25:04] athens
[1:25:05] it's a city well known for idolatry
[1:25:08] and very bad reputation of its citizens
[1:25:12] because on the edge of the city and here
[1:25:14] again by the grace of the lord i've
[1:25:16] been there once on the edge of the city
[1:25:18] was the great temple to the goddess
[1:25:20] diana
[1:25:21] okay complete with women priests
[1:25:25] every kind of perversion and it's one of
[1:25:27] the reasons that paul seemed kind of
[1:25:28] heavy-handed against women
[1:25:30] some completely out of their place and
[1:25:33] doing every ungodly thing
[1:25:37] what's interesting when we were there
[1:25:39] many years ago
[1:25:41] we were with a bunch of christian people
[1:25:43] not believers we just got attached to
[1:25:45] this other group
[1:25:46] and so they're taking us around so we
[1:25:48] had this guide
[1:25:50] and of course she's a guide because she
[1:25:52] knew both languages real well
[1:25:54] and so here she is an address that's not
[1:25:56] quite long enough
[1:25:58] and she's about 21 and she's telling us
[1:26:00] how that
[1:26:01] the reason that paul was so you know
[1:26:03] heavy-handed against women because you
[1:26:05] know all that's going on over there
[1:26:07] what about you honey
[1:26:10] you know so uh paul was very sure what
[1:26:13] he preached about
[1:26:14] because he had received it by revelation
[1:26:16] see
[1:26:18] now in your church age book chapter 1
[1:26:20] paragraph 98
[1:26:22] we need to call on god for revelation
[1:26:24] more than anything else in the world
[1:26:27] more than your new clothes more than the
[1:26:29] car payment more any
[1:26:30] revelation we have accepted the bible
[1:26:34] we've accepted the great truths of it
[1:26:37] but it is still
[1:26:38] not real to most people because the
[1:26:40] revelation by the spirit
[1:26:42] is not there every church in this city
[1:26:46] is using this same bible today
[1:26:49] but as soon as they get out then they're
[1:26:51] talking about something else
[1:26:52] there's no revelation the word has not
[1:26:55] been quickened
[1:26:57] so galatians 1 8 you know paul was very
[1:27:00] sure of his revelation
[1:27:02] and uh if if an angel himself comes down
[1:27:07] and we've had it right over here salt
[1:27:09] lake great angel
[1:27:11] but now let's let's be honest people how
[1:27:14] much trust they're gonna put in an angel
[1:27:16] whose name is
[1:27:20] it just doesn't work but they think it's
[1:27:23] great
[1:27:29] okay so paul had to deal with a
[1:27:31] generation of people
[1:27:33] women out of control living out of
[1:27:35] scriptural bounds
[1:27:36] and brother branham faced the same
[1:27:38] situation right
[1:27:40] and uh it seemed like his message was
[1:27:44] focused on women
[1:27:45] but there's a quote here in a great
[1:27:47] message choosing of a bride april 65
[1:27:50] that i'm sure that wherever you come
[1:27:52] from you never heard this quote
[1:27:55] but if she can hold herself right
[1:27:58] in other words balanced in every way
[1:28:01] modest apparel eyes on calvary what a
[1:28:04] greater reward she has than a man
[1:28:07] she's on a testing ground hey
[1:28:10] the big guys today they don't want it
[1:28:11] they don't want to we've got to be in
[1:28:14] charge
[1:28:15] but the woman has a greater reward if
[1:28:17] she can keep herself balanced
[1:28:21] so there's a continuity of the word of
[1:28:22] god and the spirit working in the seven
[1:28:25] messengers especially we can associate
[1:28:27] you know with the first messenger and
[1:28:28] the seventh messenger
[1:28:30] and um so hebrews 13 8 is still
[1:28:33] in effect today that verse is not time
[1:28:37] dated
[1:28:37] see amen for those that follow the word
[1:28:42] not following personalities or we're
[1:28:45] humans
[1:28:47] we're idolaters a lot of times you know
[1:28:51] genesis 1 says every seed after it's
[1:28:53] kind
[1:28:54] that's why you come by the lutheran
[1:28:55] church they're lutherans
[1:28:57] there's nobody's trying to get out of
[1:28:58] that church they're happy there across
[1:29:00] the streets christian church oh here's
[1:29:02] baptist church catholic
[1:29:03] they're happy there and you're happy
[1:29:05] here and even though we might bring
[1:29:07] something that oh that hurts
[1:29:09] but it's word so we line up we stay
[1:29:11] balanced
[1:29:14] okay what do we got here melchizedek
[1:29:16] great prince and king
[1:29:18] 1955. a few nights ago in a prayer
[1:29:21] meeting a man said to me the holy ghost
[1:29:23] was given only
[1:29:24] to the 12 on the day of pentecost of
[1:29:26] course that's pretty ignorant you know
[1:29:28] and i said well then what about 120 that
[1:29:30] was there at the same time they received
[1:29:32] it
[1:29:33] how about down at the house of cornelius
[1:29:34] the gentiles received it
[1:29:36] 33 years later when paul was asked he
[1:29:39] asked the baptist if they'd received the
[1:29:40] holy ghost since they believed
[1:29:42] and he laid his hands on them to receive
[1:29:43] the holy ghost setting the church in
[1:29:45] order
[1:29:47] in corinth he also set the church
[1:29:50] he also said in the church oh here we go
[1:29:52] again apostles prophets teachers
[1:29:54] evangelists
[1:29:55] gifts of healing all those marvelous
[1:29:57] gifts years and years after pentecost
[1:30:00] well then it is today to every believer
[1:30:02] go into all the world
[1:30:04] preach the gospel to those that agree
[1:30:06] with you
[1:30:07] doesn't say that
[1:30:10] every creature that's why you got to be
[1:30:13] nice to the dog
[1:30:14] and the cat every creature i didn't put
[1:30:18] it in there
[1:30:19] you know how far all the world
[1:30:22] amen how many all the people every
[1:30:25] creature
[1:30:25] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:30:27] be saved he that believeth not shall be
[1:30:29] damned
[1:30:30] these signs shall follow them that
[1:30:31] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:30:32] devils and heal the sick and so forth
[1:30:34] there you are it's god's promise
[1:30:37] that he swore he would do it no matter
[1:30:39] how much
[1:30:41] no matter how much rises up to try to
[1:30:43] counterfeit
[1:30:44] or impersonate or how many things rise
[1:30:46] up to try to contradict
[1:30:48] to take it down it will go on forever
[1:30:54] so god has swore by himself he will keep
[1:30:57] it
[1:30:58] amen so when this church burns and all
[1:31:01] this
[1:31:01] everything's gone god's word will still
[1:31:03] be true
[1:31:05] and he doesn't need our opinions
[1:31:08] remember though we or an angel from
[1:31:10] heaven preach any other gospel
[1:31:12] let him be accursed okay verse two
[1:31:16] of where we have chapter 18 he lodged
[1:31:19] with
[1:31:19] this couple the name is aquila and
[1:31:21] priscilla
[1:31:22] and they were also jews and they worked
[1:31:24] in tent making
[1:31:26] okay they didn't have sewing machines
[1:31:28] had to stitch it
[1:31:30] so they had a trade they manufactured
[1:31:32] affordable
[1:31:33] mobile buildings for working living and
[1:31:35] traveling
[1:31:38] like travel trailers economical rvs
[1:31:42] and we'll see about these this couple a
[1:31:44] little later so
[1:31:45] in chapter 18 verse 4 paul went to
[1:31:48] church when the doors were open
[1:31:50] on their worship day of the sabbath and
[1:31:51] he spoke openly with jews and greeks
[1:31:55] and so finally his helpers arrived from
[1:31:57] up north
[1:31:58] but the opposition was great and it says
[1:32:01] in verse 5 that paul was pressed in the
[1:32:03] spirit
[1:32:04] and when a minister is pressed in the
[1:32:05] spirit something's going to give
[1:32:08] you don't stay that way it blows up
[1:32:10] sooner or later one translation says
[1:32:13] he was not free to speak because the
[1:32:15] jews opposed him
[1:32:16] and blasphemed as he testified that
[1:32:18] jesus is the christ
[1:32:20] well that would build some pressure so
[1:32:23] this right here verse 5 of 18 was a real
[1:32:25] turning point for paul
[1:32:27] okay he had worked hard he had endured
[1:32:29] opposition
[1:32:30] beatings prison and now open
[1:32:33] blasphemy so he shook the dust off his
[1:32:37] coat
[1:32:38] and he said in verse 6 where's that
[1:32:40] let's see here
[1:32:43] and when they opposed themselves and
[1:32:44] blasphemed he shook his raiment
[1:32:47] and said unto them your blood be upon
[1:32:49] your own hands
[1:32:50] i am clean from here on i'm going to the
[1:32:53] gentiles
[1:32:54] forgets you people i got a work to do
[1:32:57] you know
[1:32:58] so sometimes you just got to push delete
[1:33:01] and move on
[1:33:02] not worried about pushing play you got
[1:33:03] to push delete
[1:33:07] yeah it gets pretty serious
[1:33:11] so we would like to everyone we would
[1:33:12] like for all people you meet this week
[1:33:14] you'd like from all to enjoy the truth
[1:33:16] oh how are you baptized oh wow it says
[1:33:18] right here
[1:33:20] it's not going to happen you know we'd
[1:33:23] like them to
[1:33:23] to believe the truth and live in peace
[1:33:25] with god but some are just
[1:33:27] not cut out for it so you're wasting
[1:33:30] your time you got to
[1:33:31] just give a little bit if there's no if
[1:33:34] if they receive it
[1:33:35] well then you give them a little more
[1:33:37] but you pushing the truth
[1:33:38] isn't going to change their mind
[1:33:42] they'll just make you miserable and
[1:33:44] eventually they will blaspheme
[1:33:46] so you have to move on and you can only
[1:33:48] help those that ask
[1:33:50] for help no matter how much experience
[1:33:52] you have
[1:33:53] how much truth you know and how much
[1:33:55] bible how much message you can quote
[1:33:58] if they don't ask for help
[1:34:02] it's true so let's look at verse 7
[1:34:06] where it says and he departed and
[1:34:09] entered into a certain man's house
[1:34:10] named justice uh one that worshiped god
[1:34:14] whose house was
[1:34:15] next to the synagogue that means live
[1:34:16] right next door
[1:34:18] had shared the same wall it's right
[1:34:20] there
[1:34:21] justice 8. and crispus the chief
[1:34:25] ruler of the synagogue believed on the
[1:34:27] lord with all his house
[1:34:28] and many of the corinthians heard and
[1:34:30] believed and were baptized
[1:34:32] so they're having you know some results
[1:34:36] then spake the lord to paul in the night
[1:34:38] by vision
[1:34:39] quote be not afraid but speak and hold
[1:34:42] not thy peace
[1:34:43] for i am with thee and no man shall set
[1:34:47] on thee to hurt thee
[1:34:48] for i have much people in the city
[1:34:52] so that was the word of god to him for
[1:34:54] corinth
[1:34:56] now that might be word of god for
[1:34:57] somebody else but you better be careful
[1:34:59] once you start quoting
[1:35:01] because you can you can bring something
[1:35:02] out and god's saying move on but half of
[1:35:04] god said well that was
[1:35:06] to paul let's leave it alone and he
[1:35:08] continued there a year and six months
[1:35:10] teaching the word of god
[1:35:12] among them so he stays there for 18
[1:35:15] months
[1:35:16] in corinth setting a local church in
[1:35:18] order by permission you know vision of
[1:35:20] the lord
[1:35:20] so 12-17 once again the fanatical
[1:35:24] religious jews take paul into court now
[1:35:28] it might seem like we're being kind of
[1:35:30] harsh on the jews but the fact is these
[1:35:32] were religious people
[1:35:35] they quoted their prophet precisely
[1:35:38] and this guy over here manifesting those
[1:35:41] words we can't
[1:35:42] have that we gotta stick with the
[1:35:43] quotation
[1:35:45] and the jews are to this day they're
[1:35:47] just cut out that way i love them i've
[1:35:49] got all kinds of friends over there
[1:35:51] but they'll tell you when there's two
[1:35:53] jews arguing
[1:35:54] there's at least three opinions
[1:35:59] it's just the way they are you know so
[1:36:02] they showed up
[1:36:03] took him into court this guy is
[1:36:05] persuading men to worship god contrary
[1:36:07] to the law
[1:36:09] he was only showing christ from the word
[1:36:11] okay
[1:36:12] that they said they knew but they had no
[1:36:14] revelation
[1:36:16] so the judge realized it was not a
[1:36:18] single case but a religious issue
[1:36:20] threw him out verse 14 of 18 says
[1:36:24] uh so paul was about to open his mouth
[1:36:27] for you know his
[1:36:28] his uh defense and galileo said unto the
[1:36:31] jews
[1:36:32] if it were a matter of wrong or wicked
[1:36:34] lewdness
[1:36:35] oh you choose reason uh word that i
[1:36:39] should bear with you but if it's a
[1:36:41] question of words
[1:36:43] and names and your law you guys take
[1:36:46] care of it
[1:36:47] i'm no judge in such matters and he
[1:36:49] threw them out of them out of here
[1:36:51] yeah so the greek citizens they're
[1:36:53] really upset
[1:36:54] so they beat up one of the chief rulers
[1:36:57] of the synagogue
[1:36:58] and the law did nothing just look the
[1:37:00] other way same spirits we have today
[1:37:04] 21-23 um
[1:37:07] now he's on his third missionary trip
[1:37:09] strengthening the disciples bringing
[1:37:11] words of encouragement
[1:37:12] let's look at verse 24 here we're just
[1:37:14] about done
[1:37:15] and a certain jew named apollos born in
[1:37:18] alexandria
[1:37:20] uh an eloquent man yeah he could really
[1:37:22] put together
[1:37:23] and mighty in the scriptures came to
[1:37:25] ephesus
[1:37:27] and this man was instructed in the way
[1:37:28] of the lord and being fervent in the
[1:37:30] spirit he spake and taught diligently
[1:37:33] the things of the lord knowing only up
[1:37:35] to the baptism of john
[1:37:37] and he began to speak boldly in the
[1:37:39] synagogue and when a cohen priscilla
[1:37:41] heard this
[1:37:42] they took him home for lunch you know
[1:37:44] expounded
[1:37:45] to him more openly the way of the lord
[1:37:49] and when he was dispersed when he was
[1:37:51] disposed to
[1:37:52] pass on him to asia the brethren wrote
[1:37:55] exhorting the disciples to receive him
[1:37:58] who when he was
[1:38:00] come help them much which had believed
[1:38:04] through grace
[1:38:05] for he mightily convinced the jews that
[1:38:09] uh that publicly showing by the
[1:38:11] scriptures that jesus was the christ and
[1:38:13] that's as far as he knew
[1:38:14] he didn't know all the rest of it you
[1:38:16] know and he he knew
[1:38:18] a lot of the message but he didn't have
[1:38:20] a lot of revelation
[1:38:22] he was still with the baptism of john it
[1:38:24] was marvelous for its particular day
[1:38:26] but the light had moved on he just
[1:38:28] wasn't aware
[1:38:30] so he came from alexandria alexandria
[1:38:33] still there today he's a chief port city
[1:38:36] in
[1:38:36] egypt and that's where the more readable
[1:38:40] user-friendly greek translation
[1:38:42] was made of the old testament commonly
[1:38:44] called the septuagint
[1:38:46] and it was finished 200 years before
[1:38:48] christ
[1:38:50] and greek was the trade language
[1:38:51] commonly spoken throughout the ancient
[1:38:53] world
[1:38:54] so they had to have you know bible they
[1:38:56] could all understand
[1:38:57] and this was the bible that peter quoted
[1:38:59] from you know when he preached to
[1:39:00] jerusalem
[1:39:01] and the one that apollos and paul used
[1:39:04] and even to this day
[1:39:05] it's the bible used by the greek
[1:39:07] orthodox church
[1:39:09] now we're just giving you these details
[1:39:10] kind of put things in order the greek
[1:39:12] orthodox church is based in istanbul
[1:39:14] turkey
[1:39:16] and it's simply the eastern side of the
[1:39:18] catholic church
[1:39:20] rome is the western side you see and
[1:39:23] they were one church until they couldn't
[1:39:25] agree on doctrine and they were divided
[1:39:27] in the year 1054.
[1:39:30] and just about two years ago the two
[1:39:32] heads got together again and shook hands
[1:39:33] so
[1:39:34] that's right so
[1:39:37] the revelation of the word for the day
[1:39:39] which these people lived
[1:39:40] they were living in the glare of another
[1:39:42] day you know so all god's word is true
[1:39:44] you know all of this is true but we're
[1:39:46] not building an ark today
[1:39:48] we're looking for the exit of the
[1:39:49] laodicea you know
[1:39:52] and uh we're under the umbrella of the
[1:39:53] seventh messenger we love all the word
[1:39:56] it feeds our soul that's where you can
[1:39:57] read any part of the bible
[1:39:59] anything you go any place and read a
[1:40:01] chapter
[1:40:02] in fact you know if you if you're a
[1:40:04] minister or have some kind of calling
[1:40:06] you ought to be able to open your bible
[1:40:08] anywhere you got two pages
[1:40:10] you got four columns got all kinds of
[1:40:12] references got some good notes at the
[1:40:14] bottom
[1:40:15] you ought to be able to just open
[1:40:16] anywhere
[1:40:18] and preach for 40 minutes
[1:40:22] and if you can't go back and read it
[1:40:24] again
[1:40:25] so the message continued to be the same
[1:40:28] apollos was speaking the same thing
[1:40:31] and um the lord commenced to
[1:40:34] bless his ministry so we're going to
[1:40:36] stop here
[1:40:37] i promise to come back sometime between
[1:40:40] now and two years
[1:40:42] but i will be back
[1:40:45] even if i have to drive if they if they
[1:40:47] make this so bad that you've got to have
[1:40:48] the vaccine to get on the plane i'll
[1:40:50] drive
[1:40:52] but this guy's not taking the vaccine
[1:40:53] okay so
[1:40:55] thank you brother paul and thank you all
[1:40:57] for your
[1:40:58] undivided attention
[1:41:12] amen isn't that good you know just
[1:41:15] uh i i was just thinking about it
[1:41:18] kind of a casual walk through this
[1:41:21] scripture right
[1:41:22] just to to look at that and i've always
[1:41:25] been amazed
[1:41:27] uh you know imagine what it would have
[1:41:30] been like saints
[1:41:31] to have actually lived this out
[1:41:35] and we think oh it would been so
[1:41:36] different would have been so much but
[1:41:38] you see
[1:41:39] we're living in a modern day book of
[1:41:41] acts
[1:41:42] we are living in a time that the word is
[1:41:45] fulfilling
[1:41:47] things are happening but god has chosen
[1:41:50] in such a fashion that he doesn't just
[1:41:52] come and say
[1:41:53] oh you just fulfilled the word we just
[1:41:56] simply are
[1:41:57] living it out each day and
[1:42:00] brother george when we were talking i
[1:42:02] don't know in the last couple weeks you
[1:42:04] know he made a comment to me
[1:42:05] about that he says i think people are
[1:42:08] too worried about all of this
[1:42:10] when really what we need to do is just
[1:42:12] live out
[1:42:14] the gospel and i believe that with all
[1:42:17] my heart it struck a deep cord with me
[1:42:19] we
[1:42:20] we get so worried a doctrine is
[1:42:22] important
[1:42:23] but we get so worried about all of these
[1:42:26] things
[1:42:27] when really what we were called to do
[1:42:30] was
[1:42:30] live this gospel out
[1:42:33] let the life of jesus christ live out
[1:42:37] through you and i and in that my brother
[1:42:40] and sister we'll find
[1:42:42] by god's grace his mercy will find
[1:42:45] we are living on the cutting edge
[1:42:48] of revelation in our day i
[1:42:52] i won't go into this because i could
[1:42:53] almost preach to you here because of
[1:42:56] this
[1:42:56] thoughts that i've been studying the
[1:42:58] last few days but
[1:43:00] let me paraphrase something the prophet
[1:43:02] of god said
[1:43:03] he said something somewhere
[1:43:07] has to be prepared for this
[1:43:11] to be manifested and that's what's
[1:43:14] happening in our life
[1:43:15] the preparation is taking place in our
[1:43:18] life
[1:43:20] that we can live out the word for
[1:43:23] our day isn't that beautiful i i just uh
[1:43:27] i just it stirs my heart because you see
[1:43:30] i couldn't prepare myself
[1:43:32] you couldn't prepare yourself but the
[1:43:34] holy ghost
[1:43:35] in you is making that atmosphere
[1:43:39] for god himself is how the prophet of
[1:43:42] god said it
[1:43:43] for god himself to come down reveal
[1:43:46] himself
[1:43:47] in you isn't that beautiful not just to
[1:43:51] you
[1:43:52] but in you hallelujah thank you lord
[1:43:56] we're just a bunch of nobodies but we
[1:43:58] are been filled with somebody called the
[1:44:00] holy ghost amen and we're going to live
[1:44:02] this gospel out
[1:44:04] amen it makes me want to sing give me
[1:44:06] that old-time religion amen
[1:44:08] go back in time you know i tell you if
[1:44:11] the apostle paul
[1:44:12] saints if i could just interject this if
[1:44:14] the apostle paul was here today
[1:44:18] we'd be nervous because he wouldn't be
[1:44:20] afraid to tell you
[1:44:21] you're wrong this is what you need to do
[1:44:25] but we've sugar-coated it and we kind of
[1:44:28] all have a little bit of a
[1:44:29] political uh you know
[1:44:31] [Music]
[1:44:33] bend to us and we don't want to offend
[1:44:35] anybody we don't want to lose a
[1:44:37] friend and we don't want anybody to be
[1:44:39] offended
[1:44:41] but i tell you let's stop that mentality
[1:44:44] and just put one site before us and that
[1:44:46] being lord i want to make
[1:44:48] the rapture if i have to if i have to be
[1:44:51] corrected
[1:44:52] if i have to be whipped for the gospel
[1:44:55] whatever has to happen lord
[1:44:57] just let me be ready that's what my
[1:45:00] heart is so let's just stand and sing
[1:45:02] that
