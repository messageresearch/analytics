my Lord speak and I will quick to answer thee speak my Lord speak and I will answer Lord send [Music] me amen you know I think of our brother Gary Walker and um how that he was in such a terrible accident years ago there at the accident scene and in the LifeLight helicopter he died several times permanently Brother Gary was a very strong robust young man permanently disfigured his body permanently changed the dire direction of the path of his life and it is so profound to me that when Brother Gary would share his testimony he would make a statement and he would say if you knew what God had in store you would [Music] volunteer sometimes our circumstance seems like it's quite out of control or un ununderstandable we just don't know what step to take next or what direction to go with so many questions but by God's word we have an understanding what he has in store for us let's volunteer let's just let our heart as we sing that song again just let your heart reach out really take a hold to those words speak my Lord I I want to know Lord what it is you want because I'm here to volunteer for whatever you have for me oh speak my Lord my Lord and the speak my speak and I will answer Lord amen good to see each and every one of you this morning amen sister Dorcas good to see your family I I've been praying for you and I I should have made the call but we've been lifting you and your family up before the Lord in prayer and um just uh you know I found just uh you know a little bit of trouble in my own life lately seems like I have a hard time sleeping and um some people say that's what happens when you get old but I know some old folks that's just sleep so well so we don't know how that is but what I have found good of this it's good to look to the bright spot and what I found is is that when I can't sleep I try to practice what I preach and I roll over in bed and bury my face and to start praying and it's a good good thing have enough strength to make it through the day and uh to know that we stand together as a body of Believers not just Grace Tabernacle but the Bride of Jesus Christ all over the world and uh it it is just a wonderful thing and I I'm glad to be associated with each and every one of you and so I would like to just continue from a little bit from last Sunday and um we were preaching about the bride separation thank you all so much beautiful song service preaching about the bride's separation I would just like to touch on that again before we go there I just want to say that communion will be April 7th at 5:00 p.m. and um that's the first Sunday of April and um we certainly want to remember I I didn't hear the sound was turned down in the office but remember brother Trevor sister Carrie spending time brother Trevor Has just felt a real burden uh to to draw closer to his family and so it is something that that I wholeheartedly support because it is in our love right they said how do you know them how would they know them it would be by their love and you know sometimes we we just want to give the word as one giant block and you know just hope somehow they can digest that but you know there is the position that we need to take and that is simply to love them whether you agree or not is irrelevant uh but to love them wholeheartedly from all of your heart mind body and soul sends a message that uh you can't send any other way you might disagree might pass from this life still disagreeing but it is good for us it's good for them amen so remember that brother Adrian sister aah hopefully Lord willing we'll see them um uh around communion time I'm not sure what their schedule was it it varies and he's has a hard time planning but we look forward to seeing them soon also let's turn in our bibles if we would to John the 12th chapter starting with the 23rd verse and uh this we just want to look at this of what is causing the bride to separate now I think we have to be careful how we view things and I'm going to make a statement hopefully shocking to you you but it's not the message that's separating us from the world some people view it like well the message has separated me from my family separated me from Friends old friends Etc but you see it's it's not the message unless you define the message correctly it's actually the holy spirit that is separating us it is not the message because you see in the realm of that while some people would say wo just a second Paul where are you at but you see my brother and sister many people have the message and are not separated from the world right so we can't say that the message itself is the automatic separation from the world many people have bookcases full of the message and are not separated it is the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit alone that separates us from the spirit of leoa otherwise we would our bookcase is clear full our cassettes or maybe I'm a little oldfashioned but just cleaning up around our place there if any of you need some cassettes of the message I have about 5,000 of them and um so it isn't a possession that we have these on a bookcase all by date and in order but it's If the message Jesus Christ is in us and there is where separation comes we see uh uh sorry to keep you standing but we see how Through The Years different denominations they disagreed on simple things like television we believe that we should allow it in the homes we have the Holy Ghost we believe it's of the devil don't bother letting the devil in your home they separate but I say this if it sounds judgmental forgive me but let a couple decades go by and those who didn't want the television and those who did want the television are in exactly the same spot spiritually that separation never yielded one single spiritual gain what we've got to do is focus on the separation that takes us and draws us to a higher Place draws us into the presence of God we can preach about this and we can preach about that but if none of that produces a presence that brings us into the presence of God then all we've done is a self-separation and we are not here to have a self separation we are not here to form our own little view that's right we're here to be separated by the moving of the Holy Spirit from those those things that would keep us from making the Rapture John 12:23 and Jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it he that hateth his life in this this world shall keep it into the life eternal If any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honor now is my soul troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I un this hour and I just want to emphasize for a moment we won't probably come back and touch on this but sometimes we would have the very words Lord save us from this hour how is it that everywhere we go in this world it's wickedness I remember years ago my first trip to Argentina and it was there that we were going far far south in Patagonia uh where you drive for hours between towns and I I don't know what I was thinking but I thought when we get here it's going to be just this this uh this this normal kind of people because they're so separated from the world but as we come into the town there is this absolutely ginormous dish on a hill out there that was the first premonition we're not as separated as we think we are and when we got to the town I don't want to sound crass or leave a wrong image this morning but some of the very first people we saw a gas station on the edge of this little town Village if you would call it and there they were these teenage girls with hardly any clothes on eating an ice cream bar walking down the side of the street and it struck me it does not matter how far physically you separate from this world if you're not separated in the spirit if you're not separated to Christ that Spirit of leoda will find you and as we traveled through Patagonia we we encountered all kinds of little places we're talking Villages where there's like literally six or seven houses not even a store not a gas station but the spirit of leoda had already arrived and you look at that and realize it takes more than just a pulling back distancing yourself from there has to be something that fills that space something that prepares us to stand in the test of time and as we look at this I say father father save me from this hour but God called you Saints to this hour amen but this cuse come mind to the uh to this hour I say we can take that same words that Jesus spoke and say it was for this hour that we were called to be here in this present world not looking to a time oh if we could go back a certain time I could have been an overcomer there not to look over here if I had lived in this place or that place but wherever God has placed us we were called to this hour and we will overcome father glorify thy name then came there a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again the people there that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said an angel spoke to him Jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes amen now we look at this my brother and sister the Judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out very clearly showing who's the God of this evil age and I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me Heavenly Father we ask for a blessing of your word today speak to our hearts Lord for every shortcoming every weakness Lord every doubt every fear father we ask you to come wash us father forgive us strengthen us father Lord that we would not stand here in this hour an anxious people but a people standing with a quiet confidence of who we are in you we ask you to bless this time in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated now as these words and I if I be lifted up from the Earth will draw all men unto me was Jesus speaking concerning his death and in that realm my brother and sister we can look and realize just how his death has impacted our lives and so we see that we're living in a Time certainly you know it's kind of confusing phrases that are often used in the world because if you was to go and listen to many a Pentecostal not all but many a Pentecostal church today they would be using using vocabulary that is not that far removed from what we speak it is not a whole entirely different word it is not as though the phrases that we would use would be what would separate us and so it's time uh that we stand in this day uh and uh it's time for us to respond to the voice amen amen it is time now this is not some figurative thing my brother and sister but I'm talking about the still Small Voice that speaks to you in the Midnight Hour the still Small Voice that speaks to you in your time of anxiety and dismay in the times of struggle the times that we don't know what to do or what decision or path to take this is a still Small Voice and while this would be used against me in a hall of critics my brother and sister that voice does not have to come off of a tape that's right amen that voice is God speaking to you directly amen if it comes from a tape I don't care can't tell you how many times you hear something that just strikes you at exactly the right time and I say thank you Lord but if you've got a prayer life you're going to be hearing from God amen amen if you don't have a prayer life you'll be wondering what are they talking about that's why we must have a prayer life that's why we must be able to come and sit down as it were in your way your fashion whatever it might be but God still speaking his word to his bride amen and until he comes and takes that bride's home his voice will not be silenced it won't matter if you have no electricity the voice is there it don't matter whether you even have a time might come they'll take your Bible from you the voice will still be there amen because this is not something as the prophet said not a mechanical device this is a relationship between you and Jesus Christ amen and he still speak speaking amen amen sir you know Jesus said you know in verse 30 this voice came not because of me he didn't have any need to speak the word he was the word he didn't need to hear himself speak it he didn't need it repeated he's the one who authored it he knew what it said amen he knows what it says he says it didn't come because of me but for your sake Can someone say thank you Lord that you were thinking of me amen I was reading read in the Bible the other day and I wished I I just had picked it up and was reading and and I honestly couldn't tell you where I found this but you know I looked down in the scripture there and it was speaking I believe it was psalmist David but I'm not sure and speaking and it says because he loveth my soul oh my brother and sister how beautiful that is that God would love our souls today he would love us so much that he would fulfill every word and bring it to house in a fashion that would be that we could grasp it we could hold on to it we could claim it and we could live it amen he didn't just speak words that we would stand and say well he said he said but it comes down to the time we'll speak amen the bride has a voice amen amen and so he said this voice come not because of me but for your sake and I say in this day this voice is still speaking amen it's speaking to this Brine and it come for my sake for your sake you see the prophet of God talking about the church now some people would get confused when he when he talks about the church you know and how that God is calling us out of the church he's calling a church out of denomination and he's calling a people out of the church and then he says we are the church and some people get confused as though are we called out is there another calling out fixing to come to draw us then out of this other church but my brother and sister the word as brother bradam speaks it and reminds us so often the word church means called out amen and so a calling and a calling and a calling is not we're going to have another church age it's not we're going to have some great move of restoration that is going to go through the body of Believers but my brother and sister he's calling a people out of the church for his name's sake and in that when he's calling there's going to be a people that hear that voice now my brother and sister as we see right here some thought that it you know it was uh uh some thought it was uh uh um just lost my thought some thought I got that thought amen now see some said well you know we we hear this did you hear this uh um this voice clapping of Thunder some say an angels spoke they were all right word everyone was right but they didn't have the interpretation of it that's right they couldn't come to the place where they fully grasp what was spoken right and how it applied to them now I want to ask you is God not speaking in this hour amen The Voice thundered amen it was as a voice that Angels spoke my brother and sister but we now have interpretation we now have revelation we now have understanding what was he doing he wasn't talking to the church nominal he was speaking to the bride of Christ he was calling a bride out of another group bringing her a little bit higher and the word of God every word the prophet of God spoke my brother and sister is from the Throne of God it is not man speaking it's God speaking amen now you know I I I like to joke a little bit this way not uh disrespect uh I I used to really be hardlining on this uh you know that not every thought brother random had was absolute solidified at that time I only drove cilet and I was like nope he drove a Ford he didn't have it all right but now I drive a Ford I'm starting to see it a little bit that way the Lord you see we got to keep balance in our life amen right [Music] Hallelujah so we look my brother and sister that God cares so much for you and I that he spoke and he brought this about that we could come and hear this voice to become that called out people that's right see it's not enough that he spoke about being a called out people that there would be but it is that we come to the position today to recognize we are that called out people we were the one called out of the church be called into position as not member or Associates or this or that but to identify as bride amen and I can tell you today my brother and sister the word of God our Lord Jesus Christ did not die in vain there is a people that is called out that is called out for his name's sake and when we are called into his presence you cannot be in that presence and remain the same that's right God is moving us amen now brother Brown says here in the sermon amen recognizing your day and its message he said through Hosea I have hued now watch Israel he's talking to I have hued or other words I have chopped and chopped them out through the prophets that's how God does his people he he Cho them out from the rest of the Nations now the word says this message is going to go to Every Nation Kindred and tongue so it's not talking about some Nation being excluded my brother and sister you take certain continents Africa to be an example you know you can you can uh land sister Jerry and I a few years ago flying to to South Africa we landed in snagle and the plane refueled let off passengers and um you know you think okay we're in Africa praise God it was still I don't know five more hours flying from sagol to South Africa you know it it it is a continent my brother and sister that is enormous and so God didn't say you know what I'm only going to drop the word over here and ignore a certain continent he said every nation Kindred and tongue he diced up the continents and made it specific to those people to their life to their need to their you might say tradition you know the vision books brother Barry they're Printing and they felt led of God they're now printing in very specific uh languages and some of these people have never had the message they had the message preached to them but never had the message in printed form until now amen now it doesn't say until every nation has a printed message book it says until the word has come but I tell you how much we Rejoice that we have it in English amen we Rejoice that we can just pick it up or push play and we can hear God's voice to this generation how much difference that makes so as we look at this God is hewing he says Chom them out from the rest of the Nations what by his two-edged sword his word he chopped them his Nation from the Nations he chopped his Nation from the Nations by the prophets his Vindicated word so has he chopped his bride from the denominations by his word promised by Malachi 4 in the last day chopped out his bride hewed her from the rest of the churches hewed out his bride amen and we'll even find brother and sister I hope this is not controversial to you I don't believe it should be but you'll find that Malachi 4 is actually addressing the people amen we stand on that I believe in Malachi 4 I'll Stand wholeheartedly behind it but we need to recognize God was actually speaking to the people behold I send you amen now he wouldn't say that if he's speaking to the prophet to the age behold I send you no he's the one that's being sent amen behold I send you Elijah the prophet and so we sit here today and realize how much God loves your soul amen coming down to the end of time coming down to the most deceitful age coming down to the time of the calling away of the bride of Christ God with a certainty said I'm going to make sure this works according to my word take it back through Zachariah take it into Ecclesiastes take it back to even Leviticus and you look at this that God gave very specific promises how he was going to work and how it was going to come to pass and what must take place to put you and I in rapturing condition amen it's not just having a message is not going to put us in rapturing condition it is a bride just as the story of the Rancher and the little girl she had preparation to do coming to the coming of her future husband only problem is is he had already asked her to marry him and she had already said yes so in God's eyes they were one that's right so he wasn't just coming to find a wife and hoping she was still there he was coming to get that other portion of himself and the prophet of God said that Jesus Christ is returning in this last day to get the other part of himself amen redeeming collecting up taking possession of something that was already him amen amen not going to become him but is already him amen hallelujah I'm so glad what is it God doing you ever felt a kind of what you might call Birth pains yes ever feel like you didn't do something quite right and it just comes to a a moment in your life and it just seems to be kind of a a dramatic moment it comes a moment of Crisis almost I want you to know that was just God hewing you out amen it was just God carving away everything that shouldn't be there my brother and sister I tell you what we want God to put it all you know uh cream and all kinds of coffee and all kinds of roses and all kinds of flowy whatever with a few little sugary things throw it in God's got a two-edged sword of the word amen and the prophet of God said he's heing you out amen and sometimes the hewing we take too personal yes sir we should be lifting our hand and saying Thank You Lord you cut away that oh thank you Lord I can live without that thank you Lord as it's cutting us away but instead the human nature gets in there and we are like oh why Lord why am I going through this struggle why am I going through this trial why are we in this moments of indecision why Lord and we should have our hands up saying Thank You Lord You're hewing it away from me everything that's not necessary in my life everything that's hindering me me everything that's kept my faith low everything that's brought an anxiety or a fear in my life cut it away Lord that's right Hallelujah that's right but we kind of like ourselves we do a lot to protect ourselves we do a lot to comfort ourselves well we won't go into it this morning but go look what the word of God says true Comfort is amen true Comfort only comes from being completely in Christ amen that's right now as we look at this I don't remember how I I messed up my notes and I don't remember what I did I had some arrows drawn for the brothers to follow because I wrote things down in the wrong order but I think we're okay Hebrews 711 through verse 16 now I'm going to slow down right here because I want to make sure everybody catches this if therefore Perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people receive the law so law directly connected to the levitical priesthood what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of MDC and not be called after the order of Aaron that's so this is where the people who can't catch the transition between the old Covenant the New Covenant this is where they're doing because they're missing this changing of the order of priesthood that's right and you know you and I in our natural life or spiritual life I guess I should say we have to have a changing of the priesthood Baptists used to say years ago once a Baptist always a Baptist God come along and says once a Baptist now under a new priesthood we can put whatever religion that we came from whatever our background our childhood or whatever might be it might even we could apply this right in the message that you see you can be in the message without the Holy Ghost and still call yourself a Believer but you're under a new priesthood when you have the Holy Ghost and you are in the message you're under a new priesthood now amen amen you're under new guidance and New Direction we're not looking to the old order we're looking to the New Order that God has put in place are you with me amen so we look at this now uh if the priesthood for the priesthood being changed there is made of a necessity a change also of the law you wonder how we get from law to grace and grace not to disgrace but Grace to a deeper consecration to the word word is because there has been a change and if we don't see the change don't understand the change don't have a revelation of the change then we actually just change from a book that says Baptist to a book that says this to a book that says that to a book that says message believer amen but we're not looking for a changing of the title of our book amen we're looking for looking for a change of the order that's right and when we come into a change of the order this message what the prophet say when you get the Holy Ghost I'm paraphrasing when you get the Holy Ghost this Bible will become a brand new book to you amen no longer of I can and I can't or I should or I shouldn't but it comes a book of Revelation that this is a story that my husband wrote to me this is my love letter this is my letter that gives me uh uh consolation and and in my sorrow gives me strength and in my my loneliness gives me an answer the change of the order amen the change also of the law for he of whom these things was spoken pertaineth to another tribe Hallelujah you know that went through the that went through the world here sometime back I don't know my daughter chrisen sometimes uses that she'll call the grandchildren they'll be in the basement or something we're going home come on tribe I just can't help myself I'm sorry my grandkids are a bunch of wild Indians so tribe is probably very accurate but my brother and sister we are a whole different tribe yes sir we are not just the old people with a slight conversion we're not the old people with just a new book book to follow we are a complete new tribe that's right a complete new people new creature in Christ Jesus amen of which no man gave attendance at the altar yeah for it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood amen amazing it's almost like there's been a takeover almost like you know a Breaking of the order that God had put in but you see God was going to show us my brother and sister now look we spoke the other day mentioned I don't remember when Wednesday Sunday God does work in Bloodlines and I say thank you Lord amen but you know know it comes down to people tend and especially Jews uh and and other religions but it's crept into our world you don't even know what I'm talking about because I've kept you in the blind all this point succession not conversion right succession our family has been in the message for 60 70 years that's it now I'm not rude enough to do this but there's times I want to ask them and how many of them are saved how many of them have the Holy Ghost just walking in the door of a message Church my brother and sister does not make you the message that's right it is conversion that's right but if we look at it from succession our family is a levitical family here and we have been priest priest priest priest priest and we get all the way up to Eli and Eli doesn't want his kids to go out and have to struggle in the world so Eli turns a blind eye and his sons who are born in the correct lineage we won't even talk about what they did around the temple Behavior so unsing to being a Levi what broke that why because it all comes down to relationship does not put us because we're born in a bloodline and our great grandparents and our grandparents and my parents and myself and my children and my grandchildren we were born in the message was the message born in you yeah that's it see there's there's the key right there that message has got to be born in US amen amen so we see that there's now coming a changing of the order Moses spoke nothing of this for the priesthood and it's far more evidence that after the similitude of MDC there ariseth another priest amen so God says I'm going to put a priest that you truly can count on in all things there arises another other priest who is made not after the law of carnal commandment but after the power of endless life amen not that it was I was born in this family but the power that was in that came and now has changed me it wouldn't matter if you are born into a message family I say thank you Lord that you are or have been but my brother and sister the power of endless life doesn't come through carnal family it doesn't come through carnal descendants it doesn't come through a carnal lineage but the power of an endless life comes from this new priest we identify as our Lord Jesus Christ and he come and when that power comes under that anointing of that priesthood there is something different my brother and sister the flesh passes but the soul has Eternal endless life amen and that's what we're looking for if it was just Holiness my brother and sister there's churches that are still Holiness that don't have a standard like you do we could just go over there and live nice and easy and comfortable under that standard if it was just Holiness that's amen it was just believing in prophets there's religions we could go to that would be easier on the flesh to live in and believe in a prophet that's it certainly but where you going to find the power of endless life that's it there's only one place you find that and that's right here in the word and the word said that I'm not only with you I am in you and not just for a season but to the Finish to the end there's where we come to a separation it is not my brother and sister now I hope you catch this in this realm this is not why I say this is not the message that does that it's not because we were born and raised in a message Church that does the separating my brother and sister it is the power of endless life that does the separating that's what pulls us and cuts away everything that's not right is the power that's in the word of endless life amen and I believe if we ever really truly could just get ourselves wrapped around everything that the prophet spoke that would be a foregone conclusion we wouldn't be sitting here even talking or debating or doing whatever we'd recognize that the very word he was speaking was to bring us to the place that we recognize there's a power in our midst and it's not just the signs and wonders speaking in tongues Miracle kind of power but the power that changes us converts us and moves us into endless life oh that's what I want is endless life hallelujah amen amen so look at this power of endless life You Were Made In His Image yes sir flesh of his flesh bone of his bone what does that say about the bride of Christ She's Got The Power of endless life in her and if that power is in there my brother and sister it's not such a low wattage power that it won't show but this is a power that binded Saul or Paul as it were on the road amen this is a power that is so bright my brother and sister that you could see how that God moving in places and times and circumstances made himself known in such a powerful way this is not just a message this is not just a word that somebody could come and by uh understanding or theological understanding or intellect Gras and say oh I I see that perfectly this is a power that changes lives amen this is a power my brother and sister that heals bodies that are sick this is a power that delivers from unbelief these are powers my brother and sister that this world believes in but can't quite seem to grasp that's it amen I'm sorry to be so blunt but you know in some of my looking I'm just going to speak it out there's a well I won't I'll camouflage it a little bit there's a preacher that's just kind of pretty far out there I I don't know if I could ever show up in public in ripped jeans and a muscle shirt first off I would have to I think Jerry threw all the ripped jeans away and I wouldn't look very good in a muscle shirt but here's a man I decide not to name him he makes statements over his pulpit and the rest of the religious World criticizes him do I say he's right no because I don't believe any man with a real Holy Ghost presence around him is going to show up in a Pulpit and ripped jeans in a muscle shirt put their hair in the fan you know get in the shower wash their hair take a fan no they don't blow it they suck it so it's all standing straight up and pointed every which direction and then they tefl on it so no matter what they do that day it stays just like that but they make statements and the rest of the religious World criticizes them but the statement's true the statements are true recently this man made a statement we're little gods and the internet erupted about what kind of a wicked evil man is this but my brother and sister it shows that the religious world doesn't even know their own Bible that's right because our own Bible says that we're little Gods that's right and it has to be so because we're crafted and made in him and molded In His Image and he is God so therefore we're crafted and molded in him his image we have to be of the same God material amen amen or either we weren't crafted are you with me you see what's happened my brother and sister is this power of endless life didn't come in the way that they thought it would it didn't come in the demonstration that they thought it would but it came as a voice it came in this day as a voice there they're looking for this written word here and it must come to fit their interpretation of the written word but the voice was standing uh talking about our Lord Jesus Christ standing there in their midst interpreting the word for them them and they said that's not what it means that's not what it means well I would think the one who wrote the Bible would know what it means I would think that one who spoke knew what he was speaking right right endless life has a voice yes sir amen someone's going to fulfill that amen that's right here am I Lord send me amen amen hallelujah somebody's going to have a voice in this age here am I Lord send me I I'm must I'm terrified you know people say oh brother Paul you know you do pretty good in the Pulpit or whatever well my brother and sister this is Anointed speaking when you get out and do the nuts and Bol stuff and it's not so anointed that's when I freeze up you can hear my rusty joints and you're like oh what do I say now Lord but the words said think not of what you're going to say I'll put the words in your mouth I'll show you what to say but the only way that works is that we have submitted we have just completely come and said Lord I have nothing to say I know not what to say but Lord you've got something to say Let It Be I'm here Lord use me amen Use Me Lord just don't let it be my words don't let it be my thoughts let it be your thoughts that's right hallelujah amen cuz endless life eternal life has a voice amen someone is going to be eternally separated that's exactly right amen now that's a leading question or statement because you can take this over in this negative realm or you can take it over here in this positive realm someone's going to be eternally separated from unbelief that's exactly right amen we can talk about what's wrong all we want we can oh they this and they that and and the world's going here and the denomination's going there we're not here for them my brother and sister we're here for those that are anointed with the word of eternal life amen Anointed with that life that is there and they're going to be eternally separated from unbelief amen amen hallelujah that's right yes this where I think I confused myself I think we're on the right track brother if not Lord will correct it all in the seven Church ages I'll just be honest with you I had a little struggle put this before this point or after this point this point and I think I had one set of notes it has it before and the other set has it after so Shuffle the papers and now brother Brown says here in the resume of the ages not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me that's exactly right not for one moment no sir he never stepped out and said I'll get a people to follow me no sir remember there's a voice that's right that's right or join my church or start some fellowship and organization I've never done that and will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied and that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men wherein men become New Creations in Christ filled with his spirit and live according to his will I would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to him even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to him so here's a prophet telling me look I'm trusting that I have went down the right path have said and done the right things my brother and sister and he's encouraging you and I go ahead my brother and sister now look at this I don't know I think I cut it out of my sermon because I decided it' be too long but but look at Peter they could have just sat in the boat and said now according to science the weight of matter and the density of water and cohesion of molecules there's no physical way I can walk on water Jesus you have to understand science says but there was something in Peter that longed to see faith something in Peter that longed to be back in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ and he defied every scientific explanation every kind of idea look they were fishermen they knew you jump out of the boat you go under he knew that but something had changed the composition of his thought and he just said Jesus bid me come I would like to lift my hand this morning Lord bid me come that's it don't let my thinking of what the spirit of leoda my own failure my own anxiety my own fear my own unaccomplished stop me Lord bid me to come and I'll step out of my position and I don't care Lord cuz I'm in your presence what my mind my body anything else would declare I'm going to come am but look how quick we are I I don't say this to have any fight to it but look how quick we are wonderful service and we can't even make it from Sunday to Wednesday and Wednesday to Sunday right but we're already sinking that's it we're already settling we've already had anxieties and fears and temper tantrums and this and that and the others I don't say that judgmental I'm just telling you we're human and so was Peter Jesus rebuke Peter for his unbelief and if he's standing here this morning he would rebuke you and I for our unbelief but he never told Peter go away in fact he did quite the opposite he reached out a hand Come Peter amen once again if you don't mind phrasing it this way Peter's in the game amen his doubts and fears had removed him like I can't do this what was I thinking crying out in his fear and when Jesus bid him to come Peter come and I I I want to say this in a positive sense to you church he bids us come many many many many times a day when we can't walk he's bidding us to come that's when we can't have the strength for the next step he's bidding us to come do you see how we're getting closer to him it's not what we've done but it's his bidding that's it come come come a loving patient God who loves our souls amen amen isn't that incredible amen isn't that beautiful amen I'm so glad he loves my soul that's amen now okay I'm getting myself confused here where in men become New Creations filled with his Spirit live according to his word I would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time yield your lives completely to him even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to him God bless you and may his coming Rejoice your heart oh my my brother and sister what is this here is a separation time that's it a time for us to come and we're so worried now don't misunderstand me on this I I don't believe we ought to flirt with the world but we're so worried about the spirit of the world out there that we're failing and F falling in our own fears and anxieties we we're we're wondering am I really called you know as this and that my brother and sister you don't need to worry about that world out there what you need to do is get completely sold out to Christ amen all anxieties all fears all things Lord forgive us I ask you this morning all of these things behind us that we don't need to walk on water we need to walk in the word that's right amen and walking in the word now we could put this history I don't have time but the breakdown of all the different denominations from the time that brother brandham was on the scene from 65 till now the breaking of these denominations and you'll see every time that there's an Aftershock every time there's an earthquake there's an Aftershock sometimes it's too small to be felt but my brother and sister every time there's a split in the body of Believers there's an Aftershock and then there'll be another split another split another split another split Satan's at work amen but you're being split I already read you the quote amen you're being split so don't judge them amen don't look out on these denominations and say oh look what's happening they don't got it but we're being split because we're being hued amen we're being hued and we look longingly at the pieces that were cut away as though they had some value but our lord Jesus says I wouldn't have cut it away if it had value it has no value say goodbye to it don't cry don't Pine don't look back to that look to what I'm doing look what I'm molding you into and what I'm molding you into is someone with endless life eternal life that's what the molding is amen it's not what we gave up in this life but it's what we're gaining amen hallelujah let's turn John 10 if we would please verse 24 yes sir then came the Jews round about him and said unto him how long Dost thou make us to doubt see they're trying to blame their doubts on Jesus I'm telling you the world we live in right now people are like well I'll tell you a little research down a certain thought line I'm not just random about this certain thought line certain preacher made a statement said well I'm probably wrong but as long as God allows me to be wrong I'll just stay wrong prophet said when God shows you you're wrong you go repent that's right that's right but this is a a church a preacher that has well I don't know 150,000 followers and that's what they are yeah see the world says you follow William brandom no I'm sorry I follow Jesus Christ that's right amen and brother brandham himself said if I ever leave the word you leave me amen amen right yes sir that's pretty bold statement isn't it sets the whole thing up for people to just walk away and they did they did but they didn't have the right motive they didn't have the right reason right and of course if you don't preach it like I think it should be preached you left us you weren't a part of us utter nonsense my brother and sister their kind of Separation all goes back to this that's exactly what it is my emotion my feeling my reasoning my this my that my that oh that's no my brother and sister God has got a two-edged sword amen that he's cutting away every last bit of dead weight that's it you know I'll just take this to you I after my knee surgery years ago I ended up with a lot of um um Scar Tissue some people get it in their knees some get it in their heart some get it in their mind but scar tissue and uh you know I started researching about scar tissue and what to do I mean it it was bad my knee would snap and pop and crack and and um you know I just couldn't bring myself the idea of getting cut open again and going through all that rehab and whatever and I never even really talked to Sister Jerry about it I just looked at that and I thought I'll just live with this pain well one summer evening we had a massive Storm come rolling through and Bam killed all the power and then in just I don't know three or four minutes power comes back on every pump every pivot every sprinkler line shut down and they don't restart for a reason because if they're still spinning One Direction and the power comes back on it just shears off shs and blows up Motors and whatever so I wasn't very happy it was raining and I put my boots on and I got in the pickup and I started on one end of the farm and I just went back and restarted everything I was just right up the road from our old house and that's I've got a bank right there and because those well I won't explain it all I'm say I'm getting better but I had to close a valve down almost all the way to restart this I stepped down that bank my feet shot out and I fell and I had this tremendous pain in my knee and this loud popping noise and I literally was in that position and I thought oh my I've ruined my KNE little did I know God used a power outage little did I know God used the foolishness of preaching little did I know that God knew better than I did and when I fell with my leg underneath me and it cracked so loud and the pain was so severe and I got up and I limped up the bank and I got the pump turned on and got everything fired up and it was really weird cuz I went to climbing the pickup and hey this isn't too bad I went to the house I told Jerry I said this is I don't can't explain this I fell down and hurt myself and I feel better for it and that's why we come to the house of God exactly right cuz sometimes it hurts for a moment but in the end if we don't push back from God if we don't just Rebel and say Lord why are you doing this to me and we just say Lord thy ways are higher than my ways your thoughts are higher than my thoughts and it's going to hurt for a little while but I'll be better better for it amen and that's what God's doing right here because you see my brother and sister God is coming in such a fashion his word has the answer before we even have a question amen then came the Jews round about him said how long Dost thou make us to doubt if thou be the Christ tell us plainly he did already Jesus answered them I told you and ye believe not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as I said unto you that's right that's pretty direct my brother and sister you can't understand it because you're in the wrong identity that's right my sheep hear my voice that's right and I know them and they follow me amen there should be no offense my brother and sister no one should stop and say well I guess I must not be a sheep cuz I'm struggling to follow no you might be following at the very end of the herd but you're still part of God's flock you're still his sheep at whatever stage or position you're in he's there he's made a claim to you and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish amen endless life endless life neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand this is what I made the comment earlier what do you got to worry about what are we worrying about Saints what are we worrying about the the spirit of leoa and what governments are doing and wars and the rumors of wars and wicked spirits and Antichrist Spirits what do we got to worry about we can't be plucked out of his hand he's already solidly taken possession of us and there's not a single thing the devil can do to get us will we stray a little bit I've strayed I know what it's like to stray I know what it's like to be out of the will of God but I'll tell you I also know what it's like to feel that pull that keeps pulling hear a voice that keeps calling and that I find myself moving until one day I found myself back in the house of God and serving him with all of my heart amen ah Hallelujah My Father which gave them me how was that for a boastful statement that's it God gave me to you that's it you see there is is a counterbalance of Malachi 4 right there behold I send you because my father gave them me are you with me amen are you following me today the reason you believe is because God gave himself self Amen to you amen H is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand I and my father amen are one amen well hallelujah amen that means you and the father are one that's it that's exactly right amen amen that's right absolutely see just as Jesus ministry I'll be finished in just a moment just as Jesus ministry separated in that day is minist Ministry is separating in this day people are I I I just come across the deal the other day and individuals like well the message of the hour tore my family in half did it does man have that much power over you I wish they'd catch a revelation I really do I'm not speaking phous I wish they'd catch a revelation unbelief tore my family in half amen but the devil always HDs brother Adam would know this as a hunter Antelope being what they are you can just take a cut out of cardboard paint red and white on it so that it looks like a Herford and you can walk right out through the Sage Brush to an envelope the envelope stands there looks at it decides you know Spirit of leody deia is not really a problem it's not even a cow it's cardboard but it's last dying moment that antelope is no doubt thinking that dirty no good Herford had nothing to do with the Herford had all to do with the fact that the antalope couldn't deal with himself amen that probably didn't even make sense but it sounded good to me you see let's quit blaming our position on somebody else let's quit blaming our position on God let's start standing on the word and we stand in the word our position will change everything will look brighter you see my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow him it's not religion Saints it's relationship amen now we're closing sister via would you come please that will really seal the deal see this is not religion if this is about religion my brother and sister we could go to just any old church and be happy there it's not not about religion it's about relationship right amen amen anyone can say I love you yeah that's right do I go here Brother David almost like marriage counseling anyone can say I love you but it takes real love amen to stand the test of time that's the difference amen yes sir and I want to ask you if you haven't gave your heart to the Lord you ought to start this clock running right now but those that the clock has been running is he not sweeter today than he was when we first met him is he not more precious to us than the day we first met him amen it is a relationship A Love Affair it's not religion you can turn marriage into religion but it is not religion it's relationship amen now I'll say these real quick here Ezekiel 34: 6 111 12 there's references speaking of sheep and ch sheer amen John the 10th chap: 1426 and 27 relationship references to the sheep and the shepherd amen you see it's the word that brings the separation amen the focus is the Sheep amen Jesus himself said I didn't come to judge the world I come to redeem my own amen hallelujah amen some people say the Bible is a book of judgment no it sounds like a Love Affair To Me amen sometimes I needed judged sometimes I needed correction amen now as we look at this my brother and sister the Sheep only hear the voice of their beloved Shepherd Jesus Christ amen and anytime the Devil comes to try to convince you that your relationship needs someone else in the middle that's not God's word the prophet said amen Prophet said personal relationship with Jesus Christ hallelujah it's good to be in the house of the Lord today amen I'd read that other quote see it's here on the bottom of my notes where I got confused and put it in twice I maybe should read that quote again not for one moment do I bring a message for the people that they may follow me amen let's just stand and just sing a song or two if you don't mind amen do we can we look up uh lift up the name of Jesus [Music] Amen there we go that's why I couldn't find it where ever I go I'll praise Him wherever I live I'll praise him his love surrounds me like a sea I'll praise the name of Jesus lift up the name of Jesus for the name of

my relationship with the Lord was lit but it certainly wasn't what you would call a real fire and I used to sit in church and I'd figure out how to fix a tractor and I'd remind myself what I needed to do on today I remember things and my brain would then become absorbed in that and I can declare to you absolute God was in that little church at that time speaking but I didn't hear him and you can walk out the door and say I didn't hear God today but that doesn't mean he wasn't speaking that's right let's put ourselves in a position anticipation expectation that God is not going to fail his own word and he says you come two or three I'll meet you there amen we will get what we expect amen Hallelujah I want that kind of blessing 541 Hallelujah when Jacob met the Lord upon that lonely night
