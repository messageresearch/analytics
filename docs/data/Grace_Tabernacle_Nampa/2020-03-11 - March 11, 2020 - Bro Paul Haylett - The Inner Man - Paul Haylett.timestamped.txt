[24:53] had a good weekend hey man we had a good
[24:57] weekend
[24:58] God come down I don't know that my
[25:00] thought was so stellar but the presence
[25:03] of the Lord come and moved amongst the
[25:06] people anyhow and had some some of the
[25:10] Saints had certain things that they just
[25:14] desired you know sometimes Saints you
[25:17] just you just don't realize what's going
[25:20] on with everyone around you and you know
[25:25] just to see the needs of the of the
[25:29] believers being satisfied by the
[25:30] preaching of the word is always a very
[25:33] very encouraging thing stir our hearts
[25:38] while there was other needs that were
[25:40] very very important and we're believing
[25:42] that the Lord would bring fulfillment
[25:45] and deliverance it stirred my heart just
[25:49] to see a little sister hard to judge age
[25:52] sometimes but just a young sister come
[25:56] to the altar and just desiring to give
[26:00] her heart to the Lord and that always
[26:02] just stirs your heart I mean one soul
[26:05] were ten thousand world to this all the
[26:08] all the time of studying all the time of
[26:11] preparation all the nerves all of that
[26:13] when it's all done you look and say
[26:15] thank you Lord now I believe that that
[26:18] little girl would find the time the
[26:20] place the right circumstance no matter
[26:22] what it had nothing to do with us but
[26:24] yet God would allow us to be part of
[26:27] that and that's always encouraging amen
[26:30] well god bless you all
[26:31] let's just stand and go into the Bible
[26:33] tonight and read from Ephesians the 3rd
[26:36] chapter God bless our musician song
[26:38] leader well god bless every one of you
[26:41] amen
[26:43] turn to Ephesians the 3rd chapter
[26:44] starting with the ninth verse I want to
[26:47] speak to you
[26:49] this evening on the inner man and you
[26:53] know it's a it's a lovely thing just
[26:55] there's there's way more than what I
[26:57] have will present to you tonight but
[27:01] just sometimes it's just beautiful just
[27:04] to take you know
[27:06] well let me liken it to you this way
[27:08] sometimes when you're walking in a
[27:09] beautiful place and it's just acres and
[27:13] acres of flowers but there'll be one
[27:16] flower that catches your attention and
[27:19] you might pick that one flower even
[27:23] though there's another flower of the
[27:25] same kind right next to it or just there
[27:28] that one flower maybe it followed you
[27:33] when you walked or responded to your
[27:36] voice I don't know but we're going to
[27:38] just pull one little flower out of God's
[27:40] Word tonight and by God's grace we'll be
[27:44] able to magnify the beauty of that
[27:46] flower verse 9 and to make all men see
[27:50] what is the Fellowship of the mystery
[27:52] which from the beginning of the world
[27:55] hath been hid in God who created all
[27:57] things by Jesus Christ to the intent
[28:01] that now unto the principalities and
[28:03] powers in heavenly places might be made
[28:06] known by the church the manifold wisdom
[28:09] of God according to the eternal purpose
[28:12] which he purposed in Christ Jesus our
[28:15] Lord in whom we have boldness amen
[28:21] we should have boldness amen and access
[28:27] with confidence by the faith of him I
[28:30] love verse 12 it really it would be if
[28:33] we didn't draw anything else tonight
[28:35] that we should know that we can come
[28:38] boldly and with confidence we have that
[28:41] access to the throne amen hallelujah
[28:44] wherefore I desire that you faint not at
[28:47] my tribulations for you which is your
[28:50] glory for this cause I bow my knees in
[28:53] to the father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[28:54] of whom the whole family in heaven and
[28:57] earth is named that he would grant you
[29:00] according to the riches of his glory
[29:02] to be strengthened with might by his
[29:05] spirit in the inner man that Christ may
[29:09] dwell in your hearts by faith that ye
[29:12] being rooted and grounded in love may be
[29:15] able to comprehend with All Saints what
[29:18] is the breadth and length and depth and
[29:21] height and to know the love of Christ
[29:23] which passeth all knowledge that he
[29:27] might be filled with all fullness of God
[29:30] now into him that is able to do
[29:33] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[29:35] ask or think according to the power that
[29:38] worketh in us unto Him be glory in the
[29:42] church by Christ Jesus throughout oh
[29:45] excuse me throughout all ages world
[29:48] without end amen
[29:51] Heavenly Father we just ask your
[29:53] blessings on the service this evening
[29:55] father as we would just go into your
[29:58] word go into the message I pray father
[30:01] give us wisdom give us leadership we ask
[30:04] in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may
[30:07] be seated as we would look at this it
[30:16] just struck me I kept coming back to
[30:18] this and you know looking at the the
[30:24] whole picture starting with verse nine
[30:27] that we would see what the fellowship of
[30:30] the mystery from the beginning of the
[30:33] world had been hid in God you know my
[30:35] brother and sister is so amazing when we
[30:37] think about God's plan how that it was
[30:41] so perfect from beginning to end and we
[30:44] look at the part that God has called you
[30:46] and I to play
[30:48] what a glorious part that it is and if
[30:51] we are not careful we can get caught up
[30:53] in the cares of the day-to-day life and
[30:55] life can you might say draw us down or
[30:59] drag us down but my brother and sister
[31:01] if we just stop and truly look into the
[31:04] Word of God will recognize that we've
[31:06] been called into one of the greatest
[31:08] positions that man has ever been called
[31:11] to now we know that trial and
[31:13] tribulation is just part of life
[31:16] it is not even singularly identified
[31:19] with being a Christian but life itself
[31:22] is full of travail it's short and full
[31:24] of travail you know to put it in an old
[31:29] friend of mine it doesn't happen to be a
[31:31] Christian but just man that's been a
[31:34] good friend to me through the years he
[31:36] put it much more blunt he said life is
[31:38] tough and then you die and so you know
[31:41] it is has a certain value there that we
[31:44] recognize that whether you're Christian
[31:47] or not here's a man who's not a
[31:49] Christian at all and that's how he views
[31:51] life it's tough and so we don't want to
[31:53] ever let Satan common anoint us that our
[31:56] life as a Christian is almost bringing
[32:01] us to a place of despondency or a place
[32:04] that we could give up from but we want
[32:06] to just stand because the mystery of
[32:08] this the Fellowship of this mystery my
[32:11] brother and sister is not something that
[32:13] we dig through the book one day and
[32:15] suddenly something jumped out and we
[32:17] said that's it but this fellowship of
[32:20] the mystery my brother and sister as the
[32:22] scripture teaches us is Christ in us and
[32:25] as we take this position knowing now
[32:28] this is something you have to
[32:29] emphatically declare maybe not to the
[32:33] world as it were but to yourself
[32:35] that you know who you are you cannot
[32:38] just go through this Christian life just
[32:40] kind of hoping it will not work you have
[32:43] to know who you are
[32:46] amen now is an eternal purpose that God
[32:50] has purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord
[32:53] now we have to understand my brother and
[32:56] sister this eternal purpose was not
[32:58] something just fulfilled in the life of
[33:01] Jesus Christ but as the message he being
[33:03] the firstfruits he come down poured out
[33:06] his spirit and he poured it into you and
[33:08] I and we look in this in the day that
[33:11] we're living Satan's whole goal is to
[33:14] get us to a place if we will not
[33:16] renounce our faith in Jesus Christ if we
[33:20] will not back away from it forsake it
[33:23] but we will come to a place that we buy
[33:27] certain things in our life
[33:29] would nullify that this calling in our
[33:31] life would would take all the authority
[33:34] take the power from it my brother and
[33:36] sister he can leave us in church are you
[33:43] with me Satan can leave us in church and
[33:47] be the robber who stole everything from
[33:51] us so we can sit in church and be very
[33:56] unfulfilled because we've let the thief
[34:02] in the house now you say brother Paul I
[34:06] don't remember we left the door open I
[34:08] don't know when and where and how my
[34:10] brother my sister the scripture says
[34:12] that he is clever and he can anoint a
[34:17] time and a season he can see what's
[34:20] happening you know it would be as a one
[34:22] brother referred to at one time as the
[34:24] repetitious sin and that would be that
[34:26] shortcoming in our life that the prophet
[34:29] of God showed us so clearly that's the
[34:31] very thing of all things in your life
[34:33] that you must cover
[34:36] you must not just say well God's going
[34:38] to deliver me someday the prophet of God
[34:40] taught us that when you recognize that
[34:42] weakness in your life you cover that
[34:46] weakness you make sure that Satan does
[34:49] not have access now I'm sure that all of
[34:52] us would recognize what some of the
[34:54] downfalls we have in our own lives and
[34:56] to see that but you see my brother and
[34:58] sister Satan wants to break up this
[35:01] eternal purpose that has been given in
[35:04] the calling that we have in our life if
[35:06] he can break off the eternal purpose by
[35:08] injecting something I just listening to
[35:11] the Prophet today doors in a door my
[35:14] brother and sister he's talking about
[35:15] how that Satan would come and he wants
[35:18] to get access one of the things that
[35:20] brother branham it struck me so strongly
[35:22] of this the second time I've listened to
[35:24] the sermon just recently his brother
[35:26] Branham comes down as he's talking about
[35:28] different things the one that reached
[35:30] out and struck me so strongly when
[35:33] brother Branham starts to talk about the
[35:35] door of our personal life so it's there
[35:38] that it's not looking at the world
[35:40] conditions we can look my brother and
[35:41] sister with the Catholics
[35:42] are doing and what everybody else is
[35:44] doing we look out there we can look at
[35:46] what's happening in the message we can
[35:48] look what's happening in our church we
[35:49] can look at what's happening our family
[35:51] but the thing that we need to look at is
[35:54] our personal life there's the thing
[35:57] where Satan would come in and now there
[35:59] will be many influences my brother and
[36:01] sister I'm amazed at the amount of fear
[36:03] I find around the message of people who
[36:06] are are concerned there they're afraid
[36:09] of what's happening they're afraid of
[36:11] this this they gave it a new name or
[36:15] something but this coronavirus people in
[36:18] the message Holy Ghost filled people
[36:20] that have let fear creep into their life
[36:23] and and you know they're talking about
[36:24] how you know they walk to their car and
[36:28] and they're even thinking that they're
[36:29] not going to touch the door handle on
[36:31] their own car lest some kind of germ has
[36:33] fallen upon it and they get in their car
[36:36] and they wash their hands or put
[36:38] sanitizer and they do and I was amazed
[36:41] that we were just out and about a little
[36:43] bit and people walking into a restaurant
[36:45] and pulling their sleeves down and
[36:48] reaching over to take a Hoult's of the
[36:50] handle my brother and sister that ain't
[36:52] no way to live
[36:53] Amen we're not called to have that kind
[36:56] of fear yes we ought to wash our hands
[36:58] we ought to do you know the same basic
[37:01] things that our momma taught us to do
[37:03] many years ago but my brother and
[37:05] sisters sons and daughters of God
[37:06] because the Holy Spirit the scripture
[37:09] says the Holy Spirit casts out all fear
[37:13] now it's one thing to say okay we're
[37:15] gonna heighten our you know our hygiene
[37:18] so to speak a little bit or something
[37:20] but I'm just talking about the spirit of
[37:23] fear my brother and sister bind that
[37:26] spirit
[37:27] don't let it grow anymore don't let it
[37:29] hold you back because that spirit of
[37:31] fear that might come in concerning a
[37:33] virus around the world will then work
[37:36] its way in to the fear of whether your
[37:38] life is worthy whether you are right or
[37:40] wrong it'll creep right into every part
[37:43] of your life because that seed is the
[37:45] same seed it just takes on a different
[37:47] manifestation and so let's have
[37:49] confidence as we come before the throne
[37:52] of Almighty God we have a boldness and
[37:55] an access verse 12
[37:56] and with confidence by faith of him that
[37:59] God brought us here he will take care of
[38:02] us you say but brother Paul there's
[38:03] circumstance yes there is but if you get
[38:06] caught up in that you will be caught up
[38:08] not where God wants you to be but you'll
[38:10] be caught up in the fear of this life my
[38:13] brother and sister I think it's an
[38:15] interesting thing amen as Paul is
[38:18] speaking here you know he says I desire
[38:21] that you faint not at my tribulations
[38:23] for you now imagine my brother and
[38:25] sister if we could really catch the the
[38:29] very depth I believe of the relationship
[38:32] the Apostle Paul had how intense that he
[38:36] would have been I I know and I hate to
[38:39] admit this but it's the truth that I get
[38:42] nervous around super-intense people you
[38:45] know that that are just you know so to
[38:47] speak you know I I know an individual
[38:51] you talk to them and they start the
[38:53] conversation out here they finish the
[38:55] conversation right here I get nervous
[38:58] when they get inside that space do you
[39:00] know what I'm talking about and so you
[39:02] know if we're not careful though we get
[39:04] anointed when the spirit or the presence
[39:06] of God comes in around us and we start
[39:09] to get nervous we'll back away from that
[39:11] we will move away and brother Adam says
[39:14] that that's the time that we should
[39:16] press into the presence of God when he
[39:19] comes down when we feel the moving of
[39:21] the Holy Spirit press into that amen
[39:24] otherwise we'll back away we'll say well
[39:27] I don't know you know this just I'm
[39:29] nervous about it well you might very
[39:31] well be nervous but you might as well
[39:33] just press into it my brother and sister
[39:35] because when the Spirit of God is moving
[39:37] amen we push the world out amen so you
[39:41] look at this and you know it's amazing
[39:44] verse 16 that he would grant you
[39:46] according to the riches of his glory to
[39:49] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[39:52] in the inner man now I want you to just
[39:55] grass that today my brother and sister
[39:57] this separation that there is between
[40:00] the outer man and there is so much
[40:02] information in the message you just have
[40:05] to kind of prune it down and just bring
[40:07] that little portion that you feel like
[40:09] you can deliver
[40:10] but my brother and sister the great
[40:12] segregation my brother and sister I
[40:15] thought it was great listening brother
[40:17] Brown the other day and he said every
[40:19] believer every Christian is a
[40:22] segregationist oh my you clip that quote
[40:26] out you know how people like to do it
[40:28] would make it sound like brother Brandon
[40:30] was trying to you know be racist or some
[40:32] other thing but brother Branham goes on
[40:35] then to declare that every true believer
[40:39] will separate himself from the world and
[40:43] so you look at that and we want to focus
[40:45] for just a little bit tonight on the
[40:47] inner man you look at this there is even
[40:50] to a degree of segregation between the
[40:54] inner man and the outer man now we
[40:56] understand that the outer man my brother
[40:59] and sister is influenced by relative
[41:03] things that we would know you know sight
[41:05] and smell and taste and all these things
[41:07] but when you look at that we're not even
[41:09] dealing in that natural side the outer
[41:12] man my brother and sister the prophet of
[41:14] God shows us how that the outer man can
[41:17] be anointed by the spirit all the days
[41:20] of his life now this is a tough quote be
[41:24] anointed all the days of his life and go
[41:27] to hell you see we got to recognize that
[41:31] it is not what is applying as it were to
[41:34] the outer man but what makes it down
[41:36] into the inner man will come and the
[41:39] inner man will be the spirit on the
[41:42] inner man the Holy Ghost will change the
[41:45] outer man right we're not trying to work
[41:47] from the outside in we're working from
[41:49] the inside out and by God's grace amen
[41:52] aren't you glad you can say I just love
[41:54] that little little saying that sister
[41:57] had you know I what I want to be amen
[42:00] you know but praise God amen I'm not
[42:04] what I used to be
[42:05] hallelujah you know so we know we
[42:07] recognize our own shortcomings can
[42:10] someone say amen to that we recognize
[42:12] that but the thing we also recognize and
[42:16] I hope you can say Amen to this is that
[42:18] the inside the inner man is changing us
[42:22] now the
[42:24] man is not something of an outward work
[42:26] of some good deed we have chose to do
[42:30] something that we have manifested it is
[42:33] something my brother and sister that
[42:35] transcends just the human nature our
[42:38] human desires
[42:40] now I wished I'd have brought my phone
[42:42] out here my brother Lucas down there
[42:44] just a great friend brother Lucas we're
[42:47] sharing a statement with me and I'll
[42:49] mess it up so I'll just wait til I have
[42:51] it to read it to you
[42:53] but my brother and sister you cannot
[42:55] change you by just hoping you'll change
[43:00] you have to act and when you act you
[43:06] will change now it's a matter of motion
[43:09] I preached my message there in Phoenix
[43:14] was reactions and I I believe I will
[43:17] probably after all our visiting
[43:18] ministers pass through here I'll
[43:20] probably go ahead and preach some
[43:21] version of that but my brother and
[43:23] sister we understand under Newton's
[43:26] rules Newton's law there that everything
[43:28] that has a pressure everything that has
[43:31] an action has an opposite or equal
[43:35] reaction so what is happening is if we
[43:40] are reacting as it is now I read all
[43:42] kinds of farm magazines that are telling
[43:45] us over and over and over in the
[43:46] financial side of farming they're saying
[43:49] you cannot be a reactor you must be
[43:52] ahead of the curve
[43:54] not a reactor because the market will go
[43:57] up and then already be going down by the
[43:59] time you react you need to know where
[44:02] you're at I hope you can apply that
[44:03] spiritually we don't want to be out here
[44:05] constantly buffeted by Satan in our
[44:08] lives because we're reactionary we need
[44:11] to be as it were now reactionary you say
[44:13] brother Paul what do you mean by that
[44:15] well the foolish virgin was reactionary
[44:19] amen they'd already heard the bridegroom
[44:22] cometh before they went into action are
[44:26] you with me so you see we're not called
[44:28] to be reactionary my brother and sister
[44:31] although them gets complicated nothing's
[44:34] ever fixed it gets that point that when
[44:36] the Holy Spirit moves
[44:37] on us now according to Newton's law if
[44:40] something there is an action there must
[44:43] be a reaction so when the Holy Spirit
[44:46] comes in our presence starts moving
[44:49] around us in the church in the car in
[44:52] the house might be sisters cooking
[44:55] dinner vacuuming floors whatever it is
[44:57] when the presence of God comes there
[44:59] will be a reaction do you know that we
[45:05] can actually front-load this equation
[45:07] and already determine what the reaction
[45:10] will be before we've ever felt the
[45:13] action right that is to train ourselves
[45:17] brother Branham wanted to he spoke it I
[45:21] think more than once
[45:22] were how he wanted to just come into a
[45:25] city and he wanted to just sit down with
[45:27] the people and he wanted to teach them
[45:30] do you know what I'm talking about
[45:33] he wanted to teach them on how to get
[45:35] the Holy Ghost and how to apply the
[45:38] things of God he wanted to just as it
[45:41] were show the people now you can't teach
[45:43] these things right we talked about that
[45:46] our last service here you cannot teach
[45:49] someone revelation but when revelation
[45:52] comes it can be presented and God
[45:55] Himself will anoint the people to
[45:58] receive that revelation so you know if
[46:00] you want to get technical you can teach
[46:02] revelation but it must come from heaven
[46:04] to affect you and I so we look at that
[46:07] and realize what God is doing now as we
[46:10] see here he's moving us that we can come
[46:13] and then our focus would be strengthened
[46:17] with might by his spirit in the inner
[46:20] man there my brother and sister is where
[46:22] the Holy Ghost comes and makes you
[46:24] bomb-proof he makes you fireproof he
[46:30] makes you Laodicea proof amen that's the
[46:34] strength in the inner man it's not the
[46:36] strength on the outer man now look we
[46:39] can speak all kinds of words you know I
[46:42] shared and I've shared it here at the
[46:44] church but my brother and sister you
[46:46] know just that little saying I heard
[46:48] your words but your actions tell me all
[46:51] I need
[46:51] no you see anyone can speak I've got a
[46:54] quote and I didn't put it in here and I
[46:57] won't go dig for it but brother
[46:58] branham's talking about how that anyone
[47:01] can speak anyone can speak it but what
[47:07] is being lived out that's the important
[47:11] part and so what we want to do is come
[47:14] into a place that we become very
[47:15] cognizant we've become very aware of the
[47:19] moving of the Spirit and you know
[47:21] brother Branham shows us how that many
[47:22] times the Holy Spirit would come down
[47:25] and it would move in a service and there
[47:27] would be someone there I don't mind my
[47:31] brain is running away from me but I
[47:33] played it oh I don't know quite a long
[47:36] time ago what brother Branham is calling
[47:38] out he's calling out to that lady and
[47:40] he's telling her you know respond and
[47:44] then there's a pause you listen to it on
[47:47] the tape it's way more profound than
[47:48] reading it it is a respond oh you missed
[47:55] it now imagine my brother and sister
[47:58] that the Holy Spirit was speaking
[48:00] through his prophet and something good
[48:04] was coming your way but something
[48:06] affected you in a way that you could not
[48:10] respond mister healing mister
[48:14] deliverance mist whatever the situation
[48:16] was you see we don't want to come into
[48:18] that and my brother and sister I'll put
[48:20] it this way you can come and and I don't
[48:23] mean this myself or anyone else but you
[48:25] can be listening to the most cut-up
[48:27] stuttering slobbering whatever kind of
[48:30] preacher and God still honor and come
[48:34] into that meeting he'll come right down
[48:38] and move in our miss one of the song
[48:39] leaders I'll never even halfway reveal
[48:42] who this is but a song leader he's a
[48:44] wonderful man he's just a gracious man
[48:47] but you know he's the kind of song
[48:49] leader he's from the deep south and you
[48:52] can't hardly understand him unless
[48:53] you're from the deep south but I'll tell
[48:55] you when that man gets up and leads
[48:57] songs and not know the thing I like is
[49:00] the tempo or whatever you call it the
[49:01] music
[49:02] he's up there thumping on the platform
[49:04] just the opposite
[49:05] you know difficult but one thing about
[49:09] that brother is the presence of God
[49:12] comes down you know I didn't word it
[49:16] maybe so well there a brother got up and
[49:18] sang the song waymaker I know the
[49:21] brother slightly he's had a tough life
[49:24] things are still a little tough but he
[49:26] gets up and he sings a song waymaker
[49:28] I used it as a reference later in my
[49:31] sermon because I said you see the woman
[49:34] that's on YouTube you know that
[49:36] Pentecostal lady that sings waymaker if
[49:39] you've listened to that you know she can
[49:41] belt that out she must have a set of
[49:42] lungs the size of this pulpit and she
[49:44] belts that thing out my brother and
[49:46] sister
[49:47] I just got bowled I said look that
[49:49] brother and no reference to him but he
[49:51] didn't sing it near as well as she did
[49:53] but the thing that we know is when he
[49:55] sang it the presence of God come down in
[49:58] our midst so it's not about our ability
[50:02] see there's one of our problems God's
[50:04] give us great talents in arm it's the
[50:07] message now some of the best ministers
[50:09] that there is on the face of the earth
[50:11] that some of the best musicians there is
[50:13] on the face of the earth some of the
[50:14] best singers there on the face of the
[50:16] earth but it still come it's not human
[50:19] talent
[50:20] it's our yielding to the Holy Spirit
[50:23] that makes that a beautiful thing so as
[50:26] we look at this we're looking to the
[50:28] inner man I would like to look here into
[50:31] the sermon looking at the unseen now my
[50:34] brother and sister brother branham here
[50:36] now speaks he says it is a strange thing
[50:38] that man who is made in the image and
[50:41] likeness of God and was called of him to
[50:44] walk by faith believing that God is
[50:47] would choose to walk by sight instead of
[50:51] by faith hmm after his make up his being
[50:56] and all that dwells in him was fashioned
[50:59] in the likeness of God and God is that
[51:02] great Jehovah who calls those things
[51:04] which were not as though they were and
[51:07] man made to live with God in this manner
[51:10] yet he's chosen to walk by his sight now
[51:14] I want to say I think probably all of us
[51:16] are guilty of that there's times that
[51:19] we need to distrust God and we're gonna
[51:21] fix it no matter what but my brother and
[51:23] listen look listen to this and man made
[51:28] to live with God not just around God I
[51:33] will would that could we put an emphasis
[51:36] on that the difference of being around
[51:38] you know if you say well Matt that woman
[51:41] lives with that man you're not expecting
[51:44] to find her in a tent in the front yard
[51:47] right so this is not some casual thing a
[51:51] man made to live with God in this manner
[51:54] yet he has he chosen to walk by his side
[51:57] he wants to be his own boss he wants no
[52:05] one to tell him what to do that's just
[52:08] the nature of man it proved to be thus
[52:11] in the Garden of Eden when he had lost
[52:13] his fellowship with God by choosing to
[52:16] go his own way and not having anyone
[52:19] rule over him but a man is made like a
[52:21] sheep and a sheep cannot find its way
[52:24] back I'm told when it's lost its totally
[52:27] lost you know that reminds me I remember
[52:32] is that New Zealand or wherever they had
[52:33] the Sheep named Shrek have you ever seen
[52:36] pictures that sheep here he just had
[52:38] this bundle of wool they said when he
[52:40] would lay down he almost could not get
[52:43] back on his feet because he had this
[52:45] wool that was so dense and coarse had a
[52:48] lot of dirt and whatever else in it and
[52:50] so they the man who discovered him
[52:53] noticed that this sheep hardly ever laid
[52:56] down now my brother and sister a sheep
[52:59] was not made to rest on its feet man was
[53:03] not made to rest on his feet so there
[53:07] has to come a time that we're willing to
[53:09] lay down amen
[53:14] choosing us but a man is made like a
[53:18] sheep and a sheep cannot find its way
[53:19] back I'm told when it's lost its totally
[53:21] lost and that's the way with man when he
[53:24] has lost his absolutely helpless he must
[53:27] have a shepherd to guide him and man
[53:31] when he choose
[53:32] as days go on we find men continually
[53:36] getting worse choosing rather to walk by
[53:39] sight instead of by faith by the unseen
[53:43] and when he does that he Rob's the inner
[53:47] man I like how brother branham words
[53:51] this because what happens is is a minute
[53:54] we go into the realm of we walk by sight
[53:57] walk by the flesh we are then opening
[54:01] the door to let Satan come in and the
[54:05] inner man now is robbed of the promises
[54:09] and the power of God's Word so there
[54:12] Satan working because he gets us to the
[54:15] place we want to do it our way and that
[54:19] is causing the inner man to be robbed
[54:23] which is the soul and that's the eternal
[54:27] part of man now man shall not live by
[54:33] bread alone said the Lord but by every
[54:35] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[54:36] God and a man's physical being to be
[54:39] taken care of is not all the reason God
[54:42] put him on the earth because what he
[54:44] does with his physical being amounts to
[54:47] very little now just speaking out my
[54:52] thoughts this evening - sister Jerry
[54:54] just a quip if we could give the
[54:58] attention to the inner man that we give
[55:03] to the outer man what effect would that
[55:07] have on our spiritual walk right we make
[55:13] sure that we have a good mattress if you
[55:16] don't you should we make sure we got a
[55:19] good mattress we we don't turn the heat
[55:21] off and freeze at night we don't turn it
[55:24] way up so we sweat all night we like to
[55:27] eat whatever you might be I was going to
[55:29] make a joke and what sister Lee walked
[55:30] in I just like boy she just walked right
[55:33] into this you know I'm sister Emily my
[55:37] sister in Christ but she eats things I
[55:39] refuse to but I have scenery - ice cream
[55:45] so anyway but look my brother and sister
[55:49] I just say that in humor but but look
[55:51] see we have all kinds right you know the
[55:54] sister Jerry's got on this kick of
[55:57] Brussels sprouts and fried walnuts well
[56:00] you know some people are saying yum yum
[56:02] right now but some of us won't be saying
[56:04] yum yum but look my brother and sister
[56:06] how we take care of the outer man we
[56:10] close it we buy comfortable shoes we'd
[56:13] want to drive a a decent car with a
[56:15] heater we want to do all kinds of things
[56:17] and we do all of these things for the
[56:20] outer man for one it might be chocolate
[56:24] for one it might be ice cream or
[56:26] cheesecake or a pie we have all kinds of
[56:29] things and we say well I have a sweet
[56:31] tooth well my brother and sister if we
[56:33] could give a portion to the inner man
[56:36] that we give to the outer man oh I think
[56:39] it would change our spiritual walk hey
[56:42] man we can sit in a restaurant and take
[56:44] two hours eating a fine meal we can do
[56:48] all kinds of things I'm not trying to
[56:49] place it as don't do these things but I
[56:52] hope you catch the comparison that I'm
[56:54] trying to put in place so the inner man
[56:56] is is being robbed as it was in the
[56:59] other part of the quote now man shall
[57:00] not live by bread alone said the Lord
[57:02] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[57:04] the mouth of God and a man's physical
[57:07] being to be taken care of is not all the
[57:10] reason God put him on the earth although
[57:12] if we had good Christian stewardship we
[57:15] will take care of that man because what
[57:18] he does with this physical being amounts
[57:20] to very little it's his soul what counts
[57:24] it's the inward man that did not come
[57:28] from the earth now you know sometimes I
[57:32] just catch a bigger significance
[57:34] probably than there really is there but
[57:36] you see brother branham said that did
[57:38] not come from the earth it come from
[57:41] heaven and that's the eternal part of
[57:44] the human being so we're here my brother
[57:47] and sister now we realize when we take
[57:48] the breath of life that the spirit of
[57:50] life comes into us there you know and
[57:52] and we are there you know the whole
[57:55] argument of whether you know at what
[57:57] point is a baby alive and all of these
[58:00] things that's irrelevant
[58:02] we know my brother and sister while
[58:04] snotty irrelevant but we know who we are
[58:08] as a baby we were born laid on to our
[58:13] mother's breast and we're there we're
[58:16] totally helpless I read something
[58:18] interesting the other day in the animal
[58:20] kingdom a human baby is the most
[58:23] helpless of all mammals or animals or
[58:28] whatever the terminology was because
[58:33] it's six months eight months a year the
[58:37] deer the elk the bear the mountain lion
[58:40] the dog the cat they're all able to take
[58:44] care of themselves but at a year a baby
[58:47] is still completely dependent oh if we
[58:50] could just catch the revelation of that
[58:52] they'll never come a time were not
[58:55] completely dependent on Jesus Christ
[59:01] that's the eternal part of the human
[59:03] being but yet strange that he tries to
[59:05] figure his own way out and we find it so
[59:08] in the scriptures that when a man choose
[59:09] to walk in his own way and do the way
[59:12] once to God just lets him alone man must
[59:15] not think for himself but he must let
[59:17] the mind that was in Christ be in him
[59:20] we're not to think for ourselves were to
[59:23] call anything contrary to what he said
[59:26] as though it is not no matter what our
[59:28] eyes claim to be we do not live by what
[59:31] we see we live by what we believe my
[59:36] brother and sister the day that we're
[59:38] living in right now if we lived by what
[59:40] we saw oh my goodness what a wreck it's
[59:45] just absolutely a wreck I mean I won't
[59:47] go there my mind goes to some examples I
[59:49] think I'll just skip over them but my
[59:51] brother and sister let's just say that
[59:54] there's a large piece of humanity that
[59:57] should dress much more modest because
[59:59] there's nothing attractive about the way
[1:00:03] they dress and so it's there that that
[1:00:06] anointing comes though and the outer man
[1:00:09] then believes that they have some
[1:00:11] thing that is beautiful they have
[1:00:13] something that is there but my brother
[1:00:15] and sister we recognized by the Word of
[1:00:17] God that righteousness and holiness
[1:00:19] these things are also a covering for us
[1:00:23] they're not just a way that we live but
[1:00:26] it's God's covering for us now I'd like
[1:00:28] to just move on here for the sake of
[1:00:31] time in question answers on Hebrews part
[1:00:34] three brother branham says this now the
[1:00:36] Bible said there's no condemnation to
[1:00:38] them that's in Christ Jesus that walk
[1:00:41] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:00:44] so we recognize there's a whole shift
[1:00:47] right continuity through the scripture
[1:00:49] that we're not to walk after our flesh
[1:00:51] walk after our own way but to walk after
[1:00:54] the spirit
[1:00:55] now as I already spoke my brother and
[1:00:57] sister a man can be anointed on his
[1:01:00] flesh all the days of his life but
[1:01:03] that's not what the Scriptures talking
[1:01:05] about that's not what the prophet of
[1:01:06] God's talking about he's talking about
[1:01:08] the Holy Ghost inside of a man or a
[1:01:11] woman and that would cause them to not
[1:01:13] walk after the flesh of this this
[1:01:16] Laodicean age here the spiritual man has
[1:01:18] a spiritual soul that can never die and
[1:01:22] the carnal man has a religious
[1:01:24] atmosphere around him I want you to
[1:01:30] catch the significance of this God give
[1:01:32] us wisdom God give us discernment my
[1:01:36] brother and sister to not get caught up
[1:01:38] where we just simply have a religious
[1:01:41] atmosphere now brother Branham in other
[1:01:43] places talks about religious spirits he
[1:01:45] says that a religious spirit is one of
[1:01:47] the this is my paraphrasing of it is one
[1:01:50] of the most dangerous spirits that we
[1:01:52] can have to get a religious anointing on
[1:01:55] us we feel spiritual we feel you know
[1:01:58] empowered enlightened etc but we need to
[1:02:01] make sure that we're not walking after
[1:02:03] the flesh but after the spirit brother
[1:02:06] Branham also says that you'll be able to
[1:02:08] understand or see when God is moving on
[1:02:11] a man because a man will always
[1:02:13] surrender or yield to the Holy Spirit so
[1:02:17] will be no pushback you know well I
[1:02:19] can't believe that well if it's the word
[1:02:21] we will say amen to it
[1:02:24] is the word we will say I want to be
[1:02:27] obedient to it and so it's there that
[1:02:30] it's not just simply speaking the word
[1:02:32] right you're going back to Mishawaka
[1:02:35] there were that camp those people that
[1:02:38] were there my brother and sister no
[1:02:40] doubt if the prophet of God had not saw
[1:02:43] by vision that men's lives he would have
[1:02:47] thought both of them men equally
[1:02:49] spiritual but one man had a holy ghost
[1:02:52] another man had what brother brems
[1:02:54] talking right here
[1:02:56] he had a religious atmosphere around him
[1:02:59] but the prophet of God said in the
[1:03:00] vision imagine how that must have shook
[1:03:02] him up I can only imagine I mean I just
[1:03:05] it would have had to have shook him up
[1:03:08] to catch that vision and to see that
[1:03:11] that man had a another had a mistress I
[1:03:15] guess you would call it with children
[1:03:17] and a wife over here and and still spoke
[1:03:21] in tongues and had this religious
[1:03:23] atmosphere oh lord give us discernment
[1:03:26] give us wisdom in fact Lord to seal us
[1:03:30] that we would never be influenced by
[1:03:31] that kind of a relationship or a
[1:03:34] friendship or whatever and wants to
[1:03:36] worship and so forth but is carnal look
[1:03:41] at this this is actually when I read
[1:03:43] this I had to just read it over again
[1:03:44] because when I first read it it kind of
[1:03:46] caught me off guard and he said not an
[1:03:49] unbeliever but a carnal believer and it
[1:03:56] was the kind was rejected he could take
[1:04:01] every portion of the word now this is
[1:04:05] going to be a little catch of it in a
[1:04:08] carnal way say Amen to every word but it
[1:04:13] wasn't the soul that was speaking it was
[1:04:18] the mind a physical response of amen is
[1:04:24] possible to any heathen are you with me
[1:04:29] any heathen can say Amen but it's when
[1:04:34] the soul now I this is not in our notes
[1:04:37] and I'm going
[1:04:38] bounced out to here real quick because I
[1:04:40] just think I should and I'm gonna go
[1:04:43] right here and hopefully I can find this
[1:04:44] quote really really fast because I think
[1:04:46] it fits right here now you look right
[1:04:50] here my brother and sister what I'm
[1:04:53] fixing to read to you if I can find it
[1:05:00] yes now this is a 60 March 10th
[1:05:07] 1960 Elijah in the middle offering and
[1:05:09] there it was when they walked into the
[1:05:12] fiery furnace under trial under a test
[1:05:14] they held true to the end but God was
[1:05:17] there just in the spare of a moment and
[1:05:20] he delivered them they knowed they were
[1:05:23] prayed up their sins were confessed they
[1:05:26] know they had met every requirement yet
[1:05:29] he seemed to be silent he's only silent
[1:05:33] to test you to see what you see really
[1:05:38] what you are what's on the inside of you
[1:05:40] to see if you really mean from your
[1:05:43] heart what you're saying with your lips
[1:05:49] let that go deep we can say with our
[1:05:54] lips but is our heart saying it see the
[1:06:00] difference this carnal believer can
[1:06:04] speak Amen to the word with his lips but
[1:06:09] he's not saying Amen to the word with
[1:06:13] his heart so there we see how this inner
[1:06:16] man it's not just a matter of my brother
[1:06:19] and sister that we anoint be anointed to
[1:06:22] jump and shout but we want to have a
[1:06:24] spiritual man because we have a
[1:06:26] spiritual soul can we say amen to that
[1:06:28] that can never die amen the spiritual
[1:06:31] man the real you and I can we get it
[1:06:33] down to in that language the real you
[1:06:36] and I cannot die hallelujah so you look
[1:06:40] at that and you recognize what God is
[1:06:42] doing see he wants to anoint us in the
[1:06:46] inner man and the outer man not just one
[1:06:50] or the other but he wants to
[1:06:51] anoint the inner man and anoint the
[1:06:53] outer man amen
[1:06:55] look at this now Satan trying to tell
[1:06:58] you to quit now I believe probably every
[1:07:01] believer at some time in some fashion
[1:07:03] you know has just felt like quitting
[1:07:05] just felt like kind of sitting down but
[1:07:07] my brother and sister we don't have to
[1:07:09] have that kind of a argument with the
[1:07:11] devil we're not required to argue with
[1:07:14] the devil we are allowed by the Word of
[1:07:17] God to simply tell Satan that is behind
[1:07:21] me I spoke this to you the other day
[1:07:23] that is behind me Satan that is finished
[1:07:27] so we don't have to have the argument
[1:07:31] about am i or am I not now am I am I
[1:07:33] saved or am I not saved do I have the
[1:07:35] Holy Ghost or I don't have the Holy
[1:07:37] Ghost
[1:07:37] just tell Satan that argument was
[1:07:39] already settled now this will be
[1:07:41] something we'll touch on a little later
[1:07:43] but I just want to plant this little
[1:07:45] seed to you I preached on the thought of
[1:07:47] reaction down there in Phoenix and a
[1:07:49] brother come to me and he said brother
[1:07:51] Paul he said I just couldn't help myself
[1:07:53] in the service
[1:07:54] everything that fit with what you're
[1:07:56] saying there and he had all of these
[1:07:59] different phrases that he did and one of
[1:08:01] those that tied with it he said you know
[1:08:03] it was there and you look it up and it's
[1:08:05] really cool because it's right in the
[1:08:06] message he had by inspiration he said I
[1:08:09] don't know maybe I heard it and just
[1:08:11] remembered but you know brother branham
[1:08:13] shows us that calvary was actually a
[1:08:16] transaction it's interesting right what
[1:08:22] is the definition of a transaction a
[1:08:24] price has been paid amen the price was
[1:08:29] paid it was a transaction it would be
[1:08:32] just like walking into the store and
[1:08:34] they say that is $50 to complete the
[1:08:37] transaction you have to pay the price
[1:08:40] so the $50 is laid down the transaction
[1:08:43] is complete Jesus Christ knew oh mighty
[1:08:46] God knew that before the foundation of
[1:08:48] the world right
[1:08:49] because Calvary was just the outward
[1:08:52] expression would have taken place before
[1:08:54] the foundation of the world so the lamb
[1:08:56] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:08:58] God said there's going to be a
[1:09:00] transaction and sons and daughters of
[1:09:02] God when they see that transaction took
[1:09:05] and realize it was for them it will no
[1:09:08] longer be an argument of am I saved or
[1:09:11] not they'll be able to look back and say
[1:09:13] the transaction is there and the receipt
[1:09:16] is the resurrection hallelujah the
[1:09:19] evidence that the transaction took place
[1:09:21] come about in the resurrection so we'll
[1:09:24] see how that God did that not to redeem
[1:09:27] the outer man but to redeem the inner
[1:09:31] man but the outer man come with it
[1:09:35] amen because we're not going to be able
[1:09:38] to say we got the Holy Ghost my brother
[1:09:40] and sister and just go on our life
[1:09:43] unchanged it might be a good person but
[1:09:46] having the Holy Ghost changes you and I
[1:09:49] hallelujah now I'd like to go into here
[1:09:51] you him and we'll just kind of wind our
[1:09:53] service down here tonight you know maybe
[1:09:56] this scripture has been read by tens of
[1:09:59] thousands of people since it has been
[1:10:01] written and every time you read it you
[1:10:03] learn something new I have to say amen
[1:10:06] to that
[1:10:07] pick my Bible up start reading always
[1:10:10] something we didn't see before
[1:10:12] because it's the word of the eternal god
[1:10:15] I'd write you a letter you would
[1:10:18] appreciate it you'd write me one I would
[1:10:20] appreciate it but as soon as you had
[1:10:23] read it and the message of it to you or
[1:10:25] I read yours that would perhaps settle
[1:10:28] the value of the letter if you should
[1:10:31] keep it for your children to read or
[1:10:33] someone else it would not mean much now
[1:10:36] I can tell you the truth of this because
[1:10:38] I'm cleaning out some old stuff some old
[1:10:41] records and some old things and and
[1:10:43] there's some letters there and unless
[1:10:46] you had been there the letter is
[1:10:47] completely meaningless
[1:10:52] come on sense unless you had been there
[1:10:56] it's completely meaningless
[1:11:00] so I read yours that would perhaps
[1:11:03] settle the values of the letter if you
[1:11:05] should keep it for your children to read
[1:11:06] or someone else it would not mean much
[1:11:09] and after you were gone it would mean
[1:11:12] nothing no more but it's not so with the
[1:11:15] Word of God in that amazing
[1:11:18] this letter was written to the church
[1:11:20] and it means just as much today as it
[1:11:24] ever did anyone can pick it up anyone
[1:11:29] can start anywhere and start reading
[1:11:30] this story and the story has the same
[1:11:34] benefit the same value and will bring
[1:11:37] the same results as it ever has through
[1:11:41] history in fact I'm going to be
[1:11:43] presumptuous and saying I think we might
[1:11:45] well have something greater in our day
[1:11:48] because this is the manifestation the
[1:11:52] opening of the word restoration has come
[1:11:56] this word shows us so clearly we're
[1:11:59] seeing it come to pass my brother and
[1:12:01] sister all around us it's coming to pass
[1:12:03] day by day by day amen
[1:12:08] but it's not so with the Word of God it
[1:12:10] wasn't given for any individual but for
[1:12:13] every individual my words are not oh my
[1:12:17] goodness did you just read that are you
[1:12:26] with me
[1:12:26] do I need to highlight them my words are
[1:12:33] not inspired boy this sounds like
[1:12:37] confusion
[1:12:43] to apply those words correctly right
[1:12:45] there my words are not inspired you have
[1:12:49] to separate the profit from his office
[1:12:54] are you with me because there's no way
[1:12:57] you're gonna leave the profit in his
[1:12:59] office and be able to accept his words
[1:13:02] are not inspired so he's talking about a
[1:13:05] man in the flesh his words are not
[1:13:09] inspired reason I made emphasis that
[1:13:13] under some people that kind of putting
[1:13:16] brother branham on the back shelf
[1:13:17] thinking we've got more their use things
[1:13:21] like that right there deal this got a
[1:13:24] period on the end of its complete my
[1:13:27] words are not inspired but you see there
[1:13:29] miss quoting what the Prophet was really
[1:13:32] speaking he was talking about me as a
[1:13:34] man I cannot speak as it were as just a
[1:13:37] man the inspired Word of God it didn't
[1:13:40] didn't come out of him God's Word is
[1:13:43] inspired and all down through the ages
[1:13:45] every person that reads the Word of God
[1:13:48] gets a blessing out of reading it I say
[1:13:51] amen to that it does something to you it
[1:13:54] brings you in closer fellowship with God
[1:13:57] jesus said it is written that man shall
[1:13:59] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:14:01] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:14:03] God the soul of a man lives on God's
[1:14:06] Word that's what's what we're living on
[1:14:11] now imagine my brother and sister we
[1:14:14] could actually as bad as World War two
[1:14:17] the Holocaust was they starved not not
[1:14:20] just Jews in in those camps they starved
[1:14:24] all kinds of people and all kinds of
[1:14:27] different soldiers from different
[1:14:28] countries they just starved them but my
[1:14:31] brother and sister you know that
[1:14:32] individual that was inside all that wire
[1:14:35] and electricity and and guards with guns
[1:14:37] and dogs and whatever there's nothing
[1:14:40] they could do about the condition they
[1:14:42] were in being starved to death but we
[1:14:44] can be here right now my brother and
[1:14:47] sister and come to the place that if we
[1:14:49] do not get into the word we can self
[1:14:52] impose starvation on our soul Oh
[1:14:57] how could we how could we do that to our
[1:14:59] self but man does the soul of a man
[1:15:06] lives on God's Word it strengthens him
[1:15:08] the inner man and it makes us feel good
[1:15:12] to know that our souls can feed upon the
[1:15:14] good things that God has written to us I
[1:15:17] think that ought to be worthy of an amen
[1:15:19] right there it is good to know that we
[1:15:21] can feed on those things we can just
[1:15:24] take a Holtz of those things it's his
[1:15:28] letter of space to his church and it's
[1:15:33] so inspiring as we read it it does
[1:15:35] something to us that nothing else does
[1:15:39] you see what God's done my brother and
[1:15:41] sister he's left you where there's only
[1:15:44] one thing that will satisfy the inner
[1:15:47] man it's not these things of Laodicea
[1:15:50] they've got every pleasure every movie
[1:15:52] every restaurant every fine thing there
[1:15:54] is but it won't satisfy the soul of an
[1:15:58] inner man of a son or daughter of God
[1:16:00] there is only one thing that will do it
[1:16:02] and that's God's word and that's what
[1:16:05] keeps drawing you and I right back to
[1:16:07] the word day by day hardship by hardship
[1:16:10] struggle strife problems everything what
[1:16:13] happens you get drawn right back to the
[1:16:16] word now I don't say this judgmentally
[1:16:18] but it is simply a fact that we are
[1:16:20] seeing now in this season my brother and
[1:16:23] sister it's not so much about the
[1:16:25] naysayers out here I want to drive this
[1:16:28] home to you you can have people out here
[1:16:31] that are saying well we don't know if
[1:16:33] the message is true or not my brother
[1:16:35] and sister this is not our problem our
[1:16:38] problem is as we have let Satan in and
[1:16:41] he's in the process of stealing victory
[1:16:45] from us while we're distracted we're
[1:16:48] looking at entirely different direction
[1:16:50] and Satan is here stealing victory from
[1:16:53] us he's stealing healing from us while
[1:16:56] we're worried about what our 401k is
[1:16:58] doing he's stealing from us because
[1:17:01] we're caught up in little things in the
[1:17:03] church a little frictions go look up
[1:17:05] what brother Branham says about those
[1:17:06] frictions and you look at that why we're
[1:17:09] focused on all these things say
[1:17:11] is here like a thief stealing from us
[1:17:13] and we must get our focus back on the
[1:17:16] word not the world not our 401k not what
[1:17:20] we own not where we're going and going
[1:17:23] where we've been we need to get focused
[1:17:25] on the word because it's there is the
[1:17:27] only place there's life for you and I
[1:17:30] well brother Paul what are you trying to
[1:17:33] say I'm telling you Saints it's a season
[1:17:35] for us to get focused once again it's
[1:17:37] time for us to say you know what I'm not
[1:17:40] placed here to get rich I'm not placed
[1:17:42] here to have a big house a big car I'm
[1:17:45] not placed here for these things I was
[1:17:47] placed here to live the Word of God and
[1:17:49] so Lord I'm asking you this would be my
[1:17:52] prayer you can say Amen if you want yeah
[1:17:54] I am asking Lord I want you to come back
[1:17:58] and revive the inner man you say well
[1:18:00] brother Paul I feel good I'm not doing
[1:18:02] that my brother and sister I'm not
[1:18:04] saying that we're back slate I'm not
[1:18:06] saying that we're lost I'm not saying
[1:18:08] we've got problems but I can say this
[1:18:10] then I believe there's room for
[1:18:12] improvement in the spiritual life of
[1:18:14] every son and daughter of God that's in
[1:18:17] this church and here tonight there's
[1:18:19] room for us to grow room for us to step
[1:18:23] out and as we go back to the scripture
[1:18:25] to come and boldly approach my brother
[1:18:29] and sister and not not come as the
[1:18:31] beggar but come boldly to the throne of
[1:18:34] Almighty God he's given it to us let's
[1:18:37] lay claim you know I use that little
[1:18:40] reference the other day about I'll tell
[1:18:42] my daughter Jolin so I I just I don't
[1:18:46] remember why I looked on the lost claims
[1:18:49] thing for the state of Idaho and so I
[1:18:52] just typed in Hale it and oh I come
[1:18:57] across the deal about an old checking
[1:18:59] account and I thought hmm I don't
[1:19:01] remember that I don't remember nothing
[1:19:02] about those things whatever I'll go see
[1:19:04] if there's make sure it was all closed
[1:19:06] out so I go in there type inhalants of
[1:19:08] course there's a whole bunch of them all
[1:19:09] cousins and all kinds of relatives and
[1:19:11] there's my daughter Jo Lynn's name and I
[1:19:15] tell her about it and she's kinda like
[1:19:17] mm-hmm
[1:19:18] okay until she filed her little flamin
[1:19:22] found out it was
[1:19:24] pretty good chunk of money I may not
[1:19:26] like hundreds or anything
[1:19:28] my goes like 60 or $70 it all she has to
[1:19:32] do is fill out a little deal and push a
[1:19:34] button and she gets 60 or 70 dollars my
[1:19:37] brother and sister I wonder how much of
[1:19:39] God's promises we're leaving unclaimed
[1:19:42] tonight let's step up and claim it what
[1:19:50] is the reward the feast for the inner
[1:19:54] man the rejoicing that the word is
[1:19:59] opened even more than we've ever saw it
[1:20:02] before you say is that possible well
[1:20:06] let's just say this my brother and
[1:20:09] sister I've got a friend
[1:20:11] him and his wife she bears his name they
[1:20:14] live in the same house they shared the
[1:20:16] same checkbook and that's about all
[1:20:20] they've got in common can you compare
[1:20:25] that to a marriage that has the deepest
[1:20:29] of intimacy I don't believe we can
[1:20:38] sister ma would you come
[1:20:42] I think it's worth it I do let's take
[1:20:48] our level up just a little more you know
[1:20:53] the scripture says pray without ceasing
[1:20:55] I remember brother one time says you
[1:20:57] know he said I when I was a young
[1:20:59] Christian he said I read that scripture
[1:21:01] he said I'd Drive down the road but I'd
[1:21:03] also been taught you close your eyes
[1:21:04] when you pray he said I figured out
[1:21:07] those two things don't go together my
[1:21:11] brother and sister if nothing more
[1:21:14] let's pray without ceasing let's just
[1:21:17] constantly be lifting our Lord Jesus up
[1:21:21] before you know I try I don't say this
[1:21:24] boastfully but I do my very best to just
[1:21:28] start on one end of the valley and pray
[1:21:30] my way to the other in the valley and
[1:21:31] pray my way back my brother and sister
