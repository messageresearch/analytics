treatments leaving for a good report when he has his testing in january please keep praying for this family and also for their spiritual needs we want to remember karen mccall and prayer she will be having an open heart surgery in a few days and sister jerry has a unspoken special request and we want to remember sister susan haylen in prayer so you saw the whatsapp i guess the coworker got covered just asking for negative results i want to pray for uh the believers in central america have been devastated by recent storms many losing everything they own many churches damaged or completely destroyed so we want to lift them up in prayer and our pastor as well has unspoken prayer requests that you'd like us to remember this morning let's lift up brother manasseh as he's recovering from his knee surgery amen and i believe today's sister joanne's birthday or it's very close to it we want to thank the lord for tuesday all right well we want to thank the lord for sisters joanne so let's just pray the lord just gives her a wonderful wonderful year to come amen doesn't matter how old you are lord just still opens himself up to you and lets you know once again you are my bride amen brother chris if you'd come [Music] amen asking you shall receive all things are possible let's buy our heads heavenly father lord we're so thankful father that we have you to come to the lord father yet the great paradox is that you first drew us to you lord father before we even knew we needed a god lord you had hand selected each one of us father and had picked out where we would live what age we would live in lord jesus so lord we come to you knowing that you were the all-knowing god and our father our friend our bridegroom lord and we asking you to come down and meet these needs and these requests this morning lord the list is long and i'm not going to try to remember a father but you know lord jesus father the different needs those that were that were voiced this morning before we even voiced them father you knew what they were yet because you're our father you love to hear us ask so lord we ask for these things lord my brother and manasseh and and lord sister sue's co-worker with the coveted lord and and father the different ones lord jesus father we ask that you just come down and touch them touch the needs lord jesus your divine will be done in each and every situation we ask lord we pray for the service this morning that you would speak to our hearts that you'd move a passer aside lord father bless the remainder of the song service as well lord the tithes and the offerings may you bless the giver bless the receiver we pray may all things be done to the glory of god we love you lord and thank you in jesus christ then we pray amen have your seeds just an announcement concerning the youth on here we're so happy to be here with you all and uh thankful that the lord has given us the opportunity to work with the youth here and um always praying always seeking the lord's will when it comes to the young people so just have this enough the scripture in galatians 6 9-10 says let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith so everything that we do we do to the glory of god and this is the harvest of our youth it is a pivotal time in their lives and our calling as youth leaders and parents is to prepare the ground for what god is going to do and um and that he's already doing and if that is the case we want to cultivate a place that is the best atmosphere that we can possibly do we do our very best and we leave the rest up to god um he requires that we do our part too and so sometimes uh loving someone means having to make hard decisions with your children boundaries have to be drawn which may hurt them but ultimately it's the best thing for them makes them feel secure and creates the right atmosphere so believing in our hearts that god has called us to be youth leaders even as a young man i knew that that was a calling that god placed in my life as a teenager i started the bible studies for the youth and the church i grew up in and that's always been on my heart something that god has raised me to do and i believe that and i believe it's okay to have confidence in that not to lift myself up at all but um because of that and having put our prayer into this group here we have made the decision to put an age restriction on the youth group i've spoken to our pastors i believe he is the head of the church and he is in agreement with me this morning we've seen the benefits of such and know that it is the right thing to do and so i know this will be difficult for some of you and we we understand that um we wish we could include everyone every single time we pray that you'll understand why this is the best decision for our youth as well the age restriction will be 10 years up to 30 for now so 10 years old and up are welcome to come to youth meeting attendance is allowed by anyone in that age gap who has never been married it goes without saying but sometimes you still have to voice that so we would also graciously ask that parents continue to drop your kid off and return to pick them up at the conclusion of the youth meeting so just the youth leaders there thank you all for understanding you have been a pleasure to to work with the parents of our youth and please continue to pray for a bountiful harvest from the youth of grace tabernacle we're doing everything that we can in our ability and in prayer seeking the lord's will that he would touch these young men and women and raise them up to take over the positions that will come available if the lord should tarry so with that youth meeting is this friday november 13th bring one question you have any question no question is too small no question is too great um and with with that we're our goal is to have youth being the first friday of every month and we've kind of said that to a few of you but that is the official um program we missed the last two and i would like to apologize to the youth for that we had a baby and then we had covid and so i take youth meeting very serious i think that is very very important and so when we miss one that means i failed you so i take that very seriously and so we will don't worry about it we'll continue to keep things moving along and um we'll have youth meeting this friday the 13th and therefore after that the first friday of every month unless meteorite strikes the earth but i i do love each one of you very much and the youth and the parents and um we wouldn't be here without you guys and so we thank you very much lord bless you amen thank you brother chris we do we always want to keep our young people in prayer amen and we have an opportunity to to speak to them one-on-one amen sometimes it's uh it's easier that way sometimes when our parents are sticking around kids don't get a chance to open up really what's deep in their heart and what the lord has been dealing with them with so this is this is an avenue for them and we we thank the lord for that thank you lord for chris and taking taking the helm and i know brother ivan and i we tried our best i was like i'm not a speaker i'm an organizer but we thank the lord that chris has taken this upon his shoulder and we'll continue to pray for you brother chris as you would teach and lead our young people outside of the home amen as we get ready to receive our pastor let's sing number 9 58 or sorry 51 [Music] holy words long preserved amen holy words long preserved for our walk in this world they resound with god's own heart oh let the word of god impart words of life words of hope give us strength lord help us grow in this world the word of god will guide us home word of god ever truth changing me and changing you we have come with open hearts oh let the word of god impart holy words of our faith handed down to this age came to us through sacrifice oh heed the faithful words of christ holy words long preserved for our in this world they resound with god's own heart oh let the word of god impart word of god ever true it's changing me and changing you we have come with open hearts oh let the word of god impart o word of god changing you we have come with open hearts let the word of god imparting that word of god we have come with open [Music] amen can you say from your heart this morning lord my heart is open to you i just want to receive from you lord speak to me today lord be our hearts desire amen hallelujah we just want to remember tonight communion foot washing at 5 pm amen uh also we didn't put it on the prayer request i intended to brother isaac probably would be embarrassed for me to bring this out but brother isaac had changed jobs some time back and uh just uh the company went to work for had just unrealistic expectations i believe it was an answer to prayer that god had um his old job made an offer to him of employment again they they really loved him there and so uh they are taking a few days off they went camping of all the weekends to pick to go camping but um anyway we want to remember them that you know the roads won't be too slick too muddy to whatever and god would just grant brother isaac i i think he's done well to hide it but he has been incredibly stressed out and so we just want to remember them this is just my own little personal prayer list let's remember brother dan sister sue is there building their house winter has showed up and while i believe it will go away and we'll have good weather again this is the warning shot and so just pray god would be with them as they labor to build their house and and do that so amen well we have something very lovely to do today and uh it just warms my heart uh to be asked to dedicate ali rose grace take today what a cute little bundle she is and you know as you look at her oftentimes you wonder what goes through a baby's mind and you know they just have these little smiles and they have these little scrunches and you're thinking they're thinking happy thoughts oh sometimes i just like to go back to my childhood but um what a privilege today to be able to dedicate her and uh to have our brother scott uh sister kristen's dad just a fine man of god a good stalwart soldier uh just pressing to the mark of the high calling and and brother scott is here today to witness this and to spend time with his family and uh just a real blessing to have you with us brother scott so if they would come we will just have this opportunity today to to dedicate this gift from god amen that's what our children are uh i know when they act up you know when they throw themselves on the floor in walmart and scream we don't feel like they're a gift but uh you know truly they are a gift from god to us and and um just how precious it is to uh be a part of um of these things and i'm just going to let brother chris slide this cute little bundle into my arms here and my you know all these babies are precious and i think sometimes when it's family it adds a little something special to that and she is such a sweet little thing i i don't know i don't hear her scream in the middle of the night i don't have to change her diaper all of these things but what i'm looking at is just a precious gift of almighty god and we're here today to say thank you and commit her life amen amen i believe these baby dedications make a difference amen we are telling uh the lord thank you and we're telling the devil whose property she is amen let's just bow our heads heavenly father lord we just come before you today this grand privilege lord that has been granted to us to hold this gift in our arms and lord to be able to commit allie rose grace back to you father that you would lord just lead my brother chris and sister christian all the days father in the raising of this child lord that they would train her up father lord that she would just have a open heart a tender spirit lord that you would just come down and lord she would just reach out to you and make her confession at a young age lord filler with your holy spirit all the days of her life lord we pray for health lord lord your presence lord just be with her in all things father as we stand here today knowing lord as the prophet has opened to us lord that from the very breath of life lord we would just commit her to you all lord everything of her every talent every gift everything that you have placed in her father we just committed to you to be used for your glory father may she live life in health lord in sincerity and commitment to you as we commit this beautiful bundle of joy ali rose grace to you in the name of jesus christ thank you lord amen thank you lord amen hallelujah oh my hallelujah god bless you sister christian brother chris amen how precious this is hallelujah well if we would just stand and we'll go to the word today i would just like to once again saints you know sometimes you just never know kind of where it leads but we're still on track of our little graph that we laid out but you know the lord just laid upon my heart back several weeks ago to mostly focus on the sold out uh we look at this and then we look at this what the prophet of god said he said there'd be that three kinds of believers and and you look at that and there's no real need to focus tremendous time as it were on the make believer there's no need to focus a lot of time on the unbeliever because we are a gathering house if you would put it that way of believers amen we have come here because the word of god is what stirs our heart you might use the word controls us but some people you know they have a little trouble with what you say and what they hear and you know i just want you to say my brother and sister i just want to say to you the the holy ghost doesn't control you it isn't as a dictator it does not control you god granted to us free moral agency just to decide do i go right or left or straight or whatever and what the holy ghost does is anoints those sons and daughters of god that they say lord thy will be done if you want me to stop lord i will stop you want me to speak i'll speak you want me to go right or left i'll just i want to just do what you want lord there is the difference my brother and sister many believe and and uh and i don't mean to go in that direction but i've got friends that felt uh you know one of them used the words said i was so oppressed when i was in the message it's interesting because you see i feel liberated i do not feel oppressed and so we want to look at this and as we move forward i i just felt real led just we'll get to those other topics and touch on them but we're not going to spend a lot of time uh because i believe really what it is my brother and sister uh while we are feeding on the body word of jesus christ amen we don't want to look over and spend any time at all judging those that are eating on some old dead rotten carcass that's not our job our job is to eat the word and then to let the word come through us and manifest the very life of the word and so you know i have spoken some very direct things in the last uh month or two uh in my studies these last few days i come across a quote that i had not read before and i thought i'm going to share that and then something spoke to me and said it's time to move on it's time to move on we're not here to beat the horse we're not here to do that we're here by god's grace to lay the word out and for us to take and partake of that word and build strength to move on for another day amen so i want to speak to you this morning on the word reveals the word amen hallelujah let's go to john 1 and we'll just start in on our scripture our thought for the day amen by god's grace we can move forward on that in the beginning was the word so if man ever could go back far enough if his carbon dating in his historical understanding scientific research could take him back far enough what would he run into the word you know we can have a brontosaurus tooth and a dinosaurus this and a dinosaurus that and the saber-toothed tiger and the ancient whatever man they found in a block of ice with a wound in him and all they can go back to all these things and say there had to be prior civilization well the word doesn't say there wasn't but the word says that in the very beginning of all of this was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life now and you know i want to interject this right here without him was not anything made that was made did you know that all of this incredible stuff we have that we call technology i hope you see the humor of this god was the original programmer amen the ipad air pad apple whatever 10 12 40 whatever they might be on right now that was god god knew all of that amen because you see i just happen to believe the prophet when he said all they did is break into god's laboratory well hallelujah we got all these geniuses and they've become billionaires on these great ideas but literally what they were now don't misunderstand me i believe everything and the time of the season but what it was is they were just anointed the door to the laboratory was open they got in they were the one that grasped they brought it out and they presented it to mankind and it made them rich and i'll move off that topic because if we're not careful we'll all be wearing earrings and whatever else because they'll want to put every kind of device they can in you and on you to track you to keep track of you and you won't be able to speak or think without them understanding that see that's what the devil wants because the devil unless you voice it doesn't know what's in your heart and the devil still trying to figure out what's in the mind of people amen now this will sound a little political and forgive me but you see our government and the governments of the world is still trying to figure out and working on it making progress of who will submit to them and who won't now because the devil's behind this you'll understand the devil we'll just cut it right down to the thin here the devil still trying to figure out who's going to submit to him and who won't well praise the lord i want to be like that blind man that set in church and every once in a while he just shout hallelujah and one day somebody said why do you do that he said well there's god and the devil and i just want them to know whose side i'm on yeah hallelujah in him was life and the life was the light of men and light shineth in darkness and darkness comprehended it not now i want you to understand what that is my brother and sister in him was life and his life was the light of men so there is predestination right here in this scripture because the light is shining and some look at the light and say oh my lord help me forgive me and they start to walk in that light but others complete darkness the light can shine all at once they can't comprehend it there was a man sent from god whose name was john and the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world every man amen the absolute murdering pillaging there is no god the light was there he was in the world when the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came into his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory in the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth heavenly father we thank you today for this opportunity to come and worship i ask lord that you just come and stir each and every heart father for the needs that they have lord you know that we try not to look so closely father to try and figure out the ups and downs and the ins and outs of every believer but father we would ask you to come lord for it's your holy spirit that searches the reigns of the heart of man and lord we ask you to come and search through us all today father lord that we might just be able to submit to yield lord and receive from you in the precious name of jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated as we would look at this thought my brother and sister it is actually quite an extensive thought and i have to admit that i struggled just a little bit because when you have such a wealth of information to draw from sometimes it's very easy to try to pull it all in but we know that in the human element that there is just a certain limitation by which we can uh uh remember or affect in our life and so sometimes we go on information overload and somewhere along the line those of us that maybe have more of a limited time memory uh or our approach to memory is a little different um we would we would just have to start you know shedding things because we cannot handle it but we look at this and realize as the word of god has come in our hour how the some of these passages of scripture that we have read for so long uh as time goes on they take on a greater meaning i wouldn't say a new meaning right we're not looking for a new message but did they take on a greater meaning and as we'll look at this and realize how that in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and it says the word was made flesh and dwelt among us now my brother and sister when we look at that we realize that god was empowered in jesus christ he he come right down and he he filled him up with all it wasn't any one stroke of man or of theology but it was all god and his response to the word was always that the word uh was what was in charge as it were because that is god and so you know when jesus himself as a flesh man he faced many challenges and even to the degree my brother and sister i want you to understand this relationship that there is even to the degree that he come and said my god my god why hast thou forsaken me that was the flesh speaking and so if we look and get a clear vision of what uh god uh did when he created us and uh brought jesus christ in the very image of man that we would come to a place that if we can come or i wouldn't say if we can that would be a dividing line but when we become i'm talking to believers this morning when we become completely filled with the word amen we're not looking for a partial filling or a partial anointing we're looking to be completely filled with the word now i don't know about you let's be honest with one another there's times that we feel like we've really made progress and then something of this flesh rises up and realizes god's still working on me amen but the grace of god comes and shows us clearly that we were as it were that chip or that slice off of him and so every bit of our being is just as much jesus christ this is a prophet amen just as much of jesus christ just as much as um that piece of rock was off of the statue of moses and so in that we know that even in our time of fault our time of struggle that uh god is looking at us and um looking at us in such a way i should have i don't believe i did include it and i wish i would have maybe now uh but brother branham talking about how god was up there on the mountain he wasn't looking down to see our faults amen he was looking down to see us through his own eyes oh my very simple thought but incredible amen amen now if we could look through god's eyes we'd realize that we're flawless yes sir amen now you can go ahead and let your flesh speak this morning how many feel flawless no see we can't look through our eyes we've got to look through his eyes and when we look through his eyes we see who we really are amen and so in that my brother and sister we realize that the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world as he was in the world the world was made by him the world knew him not but he came into his own now this is speaking unto the jews right not speaking to the bride of christ and as many as received him look we've been given the power my brother and sister now when we have opportunity i would liken this maybe into the realm of building something if i could just give this little example or analogy but as many as received him to them gave he power to become sons of god even to them that believe on his name now you can take my brother and sister in a natural world i would guess my brother adam and those that work around construction or anything like that you can have uh the whole pile of lumber you can have everything there and give the exact same project to a multitude of people and the level of quality uh will be revealed that was in the master that was building the house the framer that built a house he can build it it can be so crooked you can't hardly work with it or it can be so perfect that you would experience the perfection and so that will always be reflected my brother and sister in that house i remember years ago as a young man me and several other young men banded together and we were working for some contractors hanging drywall and we worked for a guy unfortunately he was the one that paid the quickest and um produced the most houses but i can remember little things like going into a bathroom and the back wall uh being you know 96 inches at the top and 94 at the bottom now my brother and sister the man building house after house after house you would think someone in their uh group would own a level you would think someone would understand how to read the level but you see they had all of that but they didn't care they didn't care to take what was provided to them and make the best of it to them it was the faster i do this the more i get the more money i make and so that was their that was their um their approach amen you know what's funny uh when brother bob sister joanne moved where they did there's actually houses on that street and the street to the south of them that uh we hung the drywall in them and some of those houses uh i would take them if they would give them to me but i sure wouldn't take them on the expectation of the quality they reflected amen if you understand what i'm saying and so every time we would drive by or go to brother bob's or even drive down the highway there it takes me back to a time uh my brother and sister when something could have been to the utmost of perfection or quality it uh was not and so he's here now and as many as has received him he's gave he the power to become the sons of god what are you going to do with that power what are you going are you going to let that power let you be a mediocre christian are you going to take that power and have just enough to claim the name of christ or are you going to take that and become the very sons and daughters of god amen it's time as i spoke the other day it's time to quit giving lip service to the message of the hour quit giving lip service and time for us to say you know what i'm going to make a full commitment i don't want to get sidetracked in my stuff but i i pulled a message book out of the bookcase and was just looking and once again god spoke to me and brother branham says it is the time or the season if you're ever going to do something for god do it now boy i tell you what something to stir you if there ever was a time ever was a season to do something for god do it now i say that's just as effective as it was when it was preached in 1963. amen it's just as reflected right there my brother and sister it's more valid actually i would say today than it was then amen hallelujah well you know as we look and we recognize now what god is doing has he come he is the word amen and the word was made flesh we see the results of the ministry of our lord jesus christ now as we'll look at that and we see what that is doing to the people will understand my brother and sister that without a revelation from god now i'm not going to go into all what sermons it was i cut all that back but brother branham said god is the interpreter of his own word amen so while we would be here and some people say you're not allowed then to say i believe it meant this that's not really what he's saying my brother and sister we can look through the word and as revelation comes to you and i the scripture comes alive does it not amen the bible means more to us today than it ever has in our life and the prophet of god said that when we see amen i'm just paraphrasing when we see this book it will become a brand new book it will not be just the same old bible with the same old results but as the bible is revealed or opened to us now this revelation my brother and sister it's not a new revelation it can only be what is already in the word amen remember when brother branham was there about the seals and somebody said oh brother branham the things that you could write and he says no it was a new revelation i can't it was there i can't add to it amen so we're not looking for a new revelation we're looking for what is there to be revealed there's where the revelation comes and let it be revealed in us because otherwise people go off on tangents amen and all kinds of nonsense that takes place and and you know it's it's a remarkable thing my brother and sister how confusing the message can become when man himself not the holy spirit but man himself tries to interpret that's it becomes very confusing in john the 10th chapter the scripture says then the jews came round about him and said unto him how long dost thou make us to doubt now i bring this out because you see my brother and sister brother branham here again i i didn't bring all the quotes because i just don't want to confuse the time today but brother branham says that the preaching of the word either brings revelation or it blinds their eyes the very same word opens one's eyes and blinds another amen see what they said right here how long does thou make us to doubt why didn't jesus words cause them to believe you see the anointing that was on them they heard his words and it caused them to doubt if thou be the christ tell us plainly jesus answered them i told you he doesn't try to explain it out again he tells him i already told you now look this is i'm drawing this down maybe in a little personal realm here but you see he's the light had already revealed revelation and there was those right there in that midst whose eyes were open and they were like oh my this is the messiah and there's others standing right there saying why are you causing us to doubt why don't you show us and he says i already did i already did what the word was intended to do it's already doing some are seeing some are not oh my i told you and you believe not the works that i do in my father's name they bear witness of me but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as i said unto you well you know what my brother and sister that'd be enough to make some of us angry he just told me i was born in the church i was raised in the church i've always been faithful in the church and he just told me i'm not one of his sheep then they will catch a revelation of course we're not beelzebub sheep that's it that's right we're not of that we're of the church but see they've missed this revelation of who they were dealing with they missed the opening of the word amen and in that by missing the opening of the word it caused them to come up with a whole different conclusion of what the word was meaning amen you're not of my sheep as i said unto you my sheep hear my voice my and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life now my brother and sister i hope i can just get all these thoughts that's went through my mind these last few days and i can get them reflected out to you by god's grace amen i ask him don't let me say a word that he doesn't want me to say amen but you see my brother and sister here is eternal life was in christ the word so the only life there is is back in the word but it will be the word that recognizes the word that jesus christ preached which is the recognized word that was in the beginning amen see how god brings continuity right down through everything there's no deviation there's no jogs that's right amen and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand now remember saints i was telling you the other day don't even remember what service it was don't worry about being deceived somebody might come with false doctrine they'll come with something that's been tainted and they'll lay it on the table in front of you and there you would say oh lord help us we don't want to be deceived my brother and sister it's a holy ghost that will either cause you to partake or cause you to reject that it won't be any man it won't be a man standing here in this pulpit that keeps you from being deceived and believe it or not see people argue with this it won't be a man in a pulpit that will deceive you because if the holy ghost is in you it's a holy ghost that says i seal you until the day of your redemption amen so it won't be because we said under so and so ministry and we don't have to worry about being deceived no it's the holy ghost sealing you until the day of your redemption is what brings you to the place of confidence that you don't have to worry about being deceived hallelujah but i want to give you the flip side of that then we're not talking about men all right hey man i got quotes here where brother branham says oh it wasn't me when this happened it wasn't me when this was said it wasn't me it was him amen so this is throw the man equation right out of here so the word will come my brother and sister and because the sheep know his voice this word will come and be laid down in front of you and i and we are there to eat it and there'll be something inside of us that says that's what i was looking for that's what my heart hungers for that's the word that brings me the words of eternal life amen hallelujah you see that has to come my brother and sister the word has to bring that light because only in the word is eternal life no other place it's not an inform it's not in function it's not in a building it's not in a man as it were but it has to be the word because the words are the words of eternal life amen aren't you glad today we can stand with the confidence we don't have to tiptoe around just afraid that somebody says something you know look maybe sister sue might remember this so my family might remember this but years ago when we were uptown we had a visiting minister he's highly recommended to us oh great guy come he come on wednesday night and he was preaching a lovely service and then he deviated off into a into a a thought and what it come down to i tried to do my homework saints to figure this out and what it come down to is he took the last half of a quote out of the revelation of jesus christ and he took a first half of a quote out of the church age book and he married them together and he speaks this out and something struck me at the moment and i was like that's not right and i was i'm sorry to admit this i pray god would give me courage today just to stand up and say you're done song leader come might be a short service today but we're done but i was sitting there going oh my goodness this is wrong lord what do i do i uh and my heart rate went up my blood pressure went up i got almost mentally dizzy lord what do i do what do i do but don't ever forget it's the holy ghost that's going to keep you it's not going to be the pastor that jumps up bold it's going to be the holy ghost and that man as he spoke those words all of a sudden he stops and he goes oh you guys don't like that did he catch my spirit no it was the holy spirit pushing back on those words it was not one of us like oh that's terrible it was holy ghost and the holy ghost said i'm not going to allow that to happen well what started off as a beautiful service went [Music] we got out of church and i said why as a visitor did you say that in our churches i took him back to the motel that night why he said i i don't know i just felt anointed to do that six months later he quit the message my brother and sister i just wanted i want to just lay this out to you don't look i don't believe you do but don't look here look in here it's the holy ghost that's sealing you to the day of your redemption hallelujah and so the word see comes to speak the word and when the word speaks my brother and sister the sheep here amen they can they cannot they cannot not hear amen hallelujah so they're saying how long you make us to doubt it was not jesus that made them doubt the word came forward it was a spirit in them because you see that works both ways that satanic or antichrist spirit always pushes back against the word just as the holy ghost would push back against the anti-word amen the anti-word pushes back against the holy ghost hallelujah well praise the lord amen and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand don't worry about it you stay in the word you stay prayed up you stay in that personal uptight relationship with your bridegroom right he said ask anything in my name and i'll give it to you why because he knows what kind of wife he's marrying he's not marrying what do they call him in the world today gold diggers he's not marrying a gold digger he knows what kind of wife he's marrying and so much so he says ask anything in my name and i'll give it to you because he knows we're not going to be out here looking for a gold-plated bentley amen hallelujah and i shall give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which give them me is greater than all hallelujah whenever i read that it just reminds me of some of the little clips that have been made through the years you know the boy beating the other boy up on the steps of the school and the little boy every time that guy thump on him he'd tell him he says you shouldn't do this and the guy is like who's going to stop me and one day he says my father and the bully turns around and here's this great big guy and he reaches out and he grabs the holds of his caller and he says why are you doing this to my son and he says because your son is smarter than me has more friends than me everything laid out a whole list and the man says i have the ability to hurt you but i'm not going to because my son actually wants you for a friend there you are hmm amen not judgment not judgment i don't say this for the preacher's sake okay but it's on my mind spurgeon says if you come to church and you judge the preacher you are wrong because the preacher was called to judge you that's it that'd be a good one and i can take you to another quote where brother branham said that spurgeon was a man of god used to write the word in his day how's that for clench in the nail hallelujah but you see my brother and sister no minister true minister of the gospel will judge the people without the word judging him amen he's not exclusive hallelujah amen my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand i and my father are one now look my brother and sister his voice is what is moving the sheep the word in the beginning was the word the word was made flesh it's that voice the word that is moving the sheep and because we see clearly in the word of god how that we being of him from the very beginning the foundation of the world so he's the word we are the word amen you cannot separate this bride from the word and say that she is of a lesser value when she is the word in the beginning amen and so the word in the beginning comes down and as jesus is on the earth and all that was in christ he poured into the church right and then poured into you and i so as he is there and by the preaching of the word that people oh hallelujah that people of the book amen who were of the word right they were begotten of the father before the foundation of the world so it is the preaching of the word that liberates the word that has been deposited in laodicea are you with me amen so it is a preaching of that word that liberates this or we can put it in a lesser value if you please it liberates these people that were saved by grace but wait they were saved by grace win and it's the preaching of the word that liberates them here in this day and as it's there as the word comes we'll touch on this after a bit it's a washing it's a washing my brother and sister god is looking for gems you know i just read some stuff that this family this has been probably a decade ago or so this family is at a a tagged price yard sale rummage sale and they saw this cute little vase and so they're there and they were like that is unique we've never seen a vase like that before they buy that vase for three dollars they take it home they wash it all up i hope you're following me they wash it all up and they put it on the mantel in their house but one day something stirs them it was on their mantle for something like seven or eight years but one day something stirs them and they took it down off of the mantle and they took it to a to an appraiser or whatever and said you know we're intrigued by this face we've never seen one like this before and and so and the man looks at the thing and he says um this vase is worth probably anywhere from two to three hundred thousand dollars wow what is it of the northern dynasty of ling or something in china going way way back and the appraiser knowing what he is looking at says there's only one other vase in known uh knowledge and it's in a museum in england and the family says um we could really use a few hundred thousand dollars they commissioned it to be put out to auction and it brought like something like 2.25 million hallelujah i hope you're with me today i got plucked out of a rummage sale what i was was not determined on that day it had already been determined way way way way way back here but there come a time we'll call it a prophet of god that said i appraise these people that are sitting in these churches and i look at them and their value is much greater than anyone recognizes hallelujah now i hope you don't mind me using that story that way but i'll tell you what i if i had a little dish on my mantel and it turned out bringing 2.25 million i would no longer have a dish on my mantle hallelujah that thing would be gone hallelujah but i'll tell you what the price was paid in our lord jesus christ looked down through history and said i know where you came from and i know where you're going to and i alone get this saints i alone know the value of my people the scripture posted as ten thousand worlds but we have no way to actually accumulate the value of ten thousand worlds many years ago i took a a a scientific calculator it had like 10 places or 12 or something like that and you might think this is silly i gone on the internet and i looked up the gdp or whatever they call a gross national product uh of and so i took calculator start in alphabetical order i look over the calculator has exceeded all values well i barely got started 10 000 worlds jesus christ alone knew the value what was it the word come and revealed the value of the word that was here on the earth unrecognized it was only him that could reveal the value of the unrecognized amen we did not see ourselves as sons and daughters of god we did not see ourselves as a part of the word of god we did not see ourself as eternal value but he did and he says i've paid a price that is equal to all of that my goodness my brother and sister i don't know how many people are here this morning but we've got i'm just going to call it 50 people we've got uh uh 10 000 worlds times 50 this morning right here in this little body of believers oh look at the price that jesus blood was worth amen that lamb slain before the foundation of the world look at the price of that blood oh hallelujah i'll tell you what and you know what it's his voice and his voice alone that removes the true sheep of god amen they the word says it don't hear any other voice that's right now i want to tie this right back together you know why you won't be deceived because you won't be able to hear any other voice it's not like well i gotta be careful he said something i've never heard before i'm gonna block that out no what you ought to do is say lord if that's truth reveal it and if it's not the truth bind it there's a solution to the preaching of the word that you don't understand if it's truth reveal it to me if it's not truth lord bind it what did the word say amen whatever you bind on earth will be bound whatever you loose will be loosed do we have confidence in the word of god or are we just giving lip service come on time to get over the lip service thing it's time to believe the word now brother brown says here i'll go ahead and move on brothers presuming amen brother brown says here i just love to read the word because i know that that's true the word is what we stay by it must always be the word of god or or we'll go on the wrong road it's written over in saint john 1 i think about the 15th chapter if you abide in me and my word in you see the word abides now you can go look in different dictionaries have breakdowns of different fashion on the word abide but it's to reside there live there stay there occupy amen so the word abides in you see then ask what you will and it'll be done come on do we have this kind of confidence things we need to have this kind of confidence we don't want to just walk around saying i believe the message god sent a prophet i believe the message we need to get to the place that that message that was revealed to us takes on life and comes into us and makes us as it were that formidable army that the prophet of god talks about when the bride recognizes who she is she'll be whipped all the time no sir he said that she will be the overcomer she will be victorious well it doesn't change my life brother paul have the same problems well maybe you're not approaching it correct i don't know because i'll tell you what it makes a huge difference in my life amen no it doesn't make me perfect i still get upset when i look out and somebody has stolen some of my property i'm out there like lord if they were right here right now what would i do first thought is i got a nine millimeter second thought is i pray for their soul so i have to choose which one of those i'm going to respond to but the word which is in us oh wait we are part of the word brings life the word doesn't bring death my brother and sister any man or woman who goes opposed to the word of god and walks away from that the scripture the bible jesus christ the message however you want to put it is not what condemns them to hell they made that decision reminds me of a story placed many years ago in the far north two men were mining for gold and they were successful and the one guy was always joking one of these days we're gonna have so much gold i'm have to kill you and take it all myself the other guy just laughs he goes yeah we're finding a lot of gold you see so plain it got laughed off thought his friend was friend thought his friend was joking until the day he started having belly aches and he died you see my brother and sister the devil is so sly that he puts his very desire to destroy you right out in the open and we laugh until we get a bellyache and we're like i'm just tired of religion i'm tired of church i'm tired of god i'm tired of everything because it just nothing changes i just hear the same old preaching all the time well spurgeon says that if we were all saved a short sermon would be sufficient go look it up if we were all saved a short sermon would be sufficient hallelujah now where was i ask what you will it will be done because it's not you it's the word that's in you when we get to the place we fully have comprehension that we are nothing and christ is everything then we can just march right on taking the promises of god and declaring them with full expectation they will come to pass because it's not me it's not you it's the word in you and the word is god see see god in you god is the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the word was made flesh and dwelt among us now in the return of the holy spirit bringing the word in us it's abiding in there then it's not you that speaks it's the word itself coming out so it the word will perform the work amen this is why my brother and sister it takes the word to reveal the word because you see we are identified by our words are we not amen all mankind is identified by their words you'll hear people it'll say and i knew these guys but people that knew them a lot longer they had nicknamed this father and son doom and gloom and in the farming circle they were known people would be referring they never said oh it's john and philip they said it's doom and gloom why because everything that come out of their mouth it would be you know january it's going to be another bad year of farming the weather the price of crops everything we're going to just lose money this year remember sitting there listening to them i hope you don't mind me putting this context i sat there and listened to them and i i it actually had effect on me because i just finished my budget and i had just turned it into my banker asking for a few hundred thousand dollars and my budget showed me making money and here's doom and gloom sitting around the table telling everybody the government the weather the crop prices everything we're all going to lose money now i had to make a decision hope you follow me i had to make a decision do i believe what i researched do i do i believe what i labor to come and answer to or do i believe these are anointed by a spirit of doom and gloom oh i'm going to put this and twist this around you got people around this message that are all like we got to be so careful we need to just i hope this don't offend anybody but it fits if it's called for cog we gotta only listen to the prophet or we're gonna be deceived you find the prophet's words that will back that up the prophet of god don't back that up what is that that's a spirit of doom and gloom because i study my bible i look what the prophet of god said my brother and sister i would encourage you to do this too i like to read more than listen i read brother branham says this and this and refers to a scripture i take my bible i open it up i read it for myself do i not trust the prophet no that's not what it's about i need to understand the revelation of what he's talking about and so i go back to that original the urem from thumb and the urim thumb oh see people get so confused we're not judging the prophet oh come on saint we're not judging the prophet by the urim thummim we're judging ourself all these people like well you're judging brother bradham no you missed the point entirely we are not here judging a prophet god judges the prophet amen but we'll take the word and we take it back to the bible the urem thumb and we judge ourselves lord am i i want to read the context of this lord oh oh help me lord exactly oh help me lord amen the earth thumb on people god you're in someone we're going to judge everybody oh you're judging the prophet we're judging you by the urine from them why don't you judge yourself why don't you stop long enough to take the urim thumb and judge yourself that's right that's right amen hallelujah i'm trying to stay away from the negative my brother and sister but if i didn't believe the prophet you know i had somebody accuse me well you don't even believe the prophet you wouldn't say what you said if you believe the prophet i wouldn't be here preaching to you if i didn't believe the prophet hallelujah come on i'd be somewhere else i've told you this before i say it facetiously but there is a certain degree of truth to this i'd probably go over to my ancestry and become a mormon because they got all kinds of benefits i'm talking about all kinds of benefits you want to buy a bigger farm you can go right to the church and ask them to buy that farm and then you just make they're like the bank then if you have troubles they don't mind because you're part of them and they get it so if i didn't believe this message see i'd go find a church that had some materialistic benefits you know what i got for a materialistic benefit right here you know this message has a materialistic benefit it's called eternal life hallelujah i don't have to look at this old look at this poor face of mine this thing has developed more wrinkles in the last couple years than i can stand i look in the mirror and even sister jerry's like we need to get you some kind of lotions and some collagen and some stuff don't worry about this face don't worry about this face there'll be a day they might throw dirt on this face but i tell you what i've got i've got something and one of the reason i use the word materialistic is because it is tangible it is real it's not a theory it's not some kind of vapor i've got eternal life as my tangible benefit hallelujah amen see the word was made flesh see it's bringing the word in us look at this saints not to us get this i believe the prophet's words are are clear i think they were anointed it brings the word in amen this is not external it's abiding in there then it's not you what that's it amen when i feel like everything has fallen apart hallelujah i won't go into the topic my poor nephew brother chris was listening to our conversation the other day and i feel really bad brother chris that you listen to that because it sounds really negative because we're talking about certain things and we're talking about the problems and we're talking about uh and don't worry about this i'm not focused on this but i just want to make an example we're sitting there talking about how much money we lost in this certain avenue and trust me it'll be as much as most of you make and it just vaporized out of our midst this year but you know what that's nothing that's nothing compared to this that is nothing saints it has no measure to even be compared because the word is speaking to the word and the word is saying not building on this earth not taking or possessing of this earth not trying to have gold in houses and lands on this earth when i come and place you on this earth is so that you could manifest oh not that i'm such woe unto me and god help me but the word manifests a bride that declares the glory of god not what is wrong not is what my flesh not his what my mind not the troubles of life it is here that a bride is to declare the glory of almighty god hallelujah i'm sorry i even use that analogy to do that i i feel checked but i just want you to understand my brother and sister there's more than a checking account there's more than that house there's more than those things we can lay our tangible hands upon and all of that can come and go and i was reading i was reading some reading of this guy and i i finally had to just quit because he had me just all shook up and he said this is the season talking now biden harris a nation that chose abortion and perverted rights over decency he said now is the season that the attributes of sodom will be manifested in our nation and your churches will become store houses right i think i'll put that to the side praise the lord why well i'm flash it makes me nervous thinking about this they're going to have a hard time getting a heister in here amen but looks the prophet of god says you're not even going to be here [Music] hallelujah when tribulation falls on this earth the bride is not even here i think i'm going to go prepare myself for the tribulation no i'm going to prepare myself for a rapture hallelujah i'm going to get my ticket purchased you guys remember the day you could walk into the airport lay cash on the counter and get a plane ticket amen those days are gone now to take a flight you have to have preparation oh hallelujah amen revelation brings implementation i want to take a flight you sit down either call the travel agent or sit down on a computer and you got to do it you can't walk in there i don't care how much cash you've got in your pocket you won't buy a ticket at an airport amen hallelujah you see how it all fits together amen it's abiding in there that it's not you that speaks come on saints if you find yourself speaking something that is other than the word ask god forgive you and back up on that amen it's the word itself coming out so if the word will perform the work hallelujah amen now i've got quite a few quotes here and lord help me just to plow right through here my word is time go you know there's a scripture in the bible in first thessalonians 5 21 it's written prove all things hold faster that which is good when anything is proven it will either be proven right or wrong and when there's anything in question it should be proven until you find out what is right hallelujah well i believe the prophet of god meant this and this amen i don't believe that well why don't you go right should be proven there's anything in question should be proven till you find out whether it's right or wrong amen not a reaction of you preach that you're a deceiver now that was pointed hallelujah you want some more spurgeon quotes spurgeon says if the preaching of the work does not make you nervous the preacher has failed in his job amen hallelujah amen well praise the lord if you don't like it and just take it up with spurgeon and then you can take up with the quote where brother branham said that spurgeon was a man of god used to write even the word of god anyway on with that i don't mean to be jokey but my brother and sister it's about time that we'll stop and look at the word of god and say lord uh prove it to me lord it's okay to ask the lord right you see my brother and sister here's the basis it's never okay to question god are you with me never okay to question god but you're within your rights to ask god a question amen huge difference huge difference amen when there's anything in question it should be proven until you find out what is right and then as you find out what is right it said hold fast in other words grip it don't turn it loose hold it fast in other words hold it tight so that it will not slip hold fast to that which is good after it's been proven amen well praise the lord i took the first three lines of this quote in the middle of that one and this parrot here and that and i tied it all together and someone says to the prophet say that yes he did but where's the continuity where's the continuity brother brown uses the word see the devil come in and try and twist that try and take the word and twist that word hallelujah we don't need a dot dot dot kind of a message anything that's proven not right then turn it loose as quick as you can get away from it never don't uh never hold on to the wrong thing amen i think that's just a a really nice thought right there you know what i mean you look at that hallelujah now look here and uh where am i at hallelujah i'm just wound up right now i'm sorry some things my flesh wants to say and the lord is saying no okay ding thank you what do you do my brother and sister if you're going to prove something you have to do your due diligence i had this throw back in my face and i don't that what what happened about that being throwed my face doesn't not an issue but you see my brother and sister people will respond whatever whatever response it is they'll throw it back in your face and we have a tendency to try to explain to justify to defend that's right now some people wouldn't agree with it well you're the pastor you should be no i'm it's sorry holy ghost it's in control you see brother branham says now forgive me i'm paraphrasing this brother branham says now if the holy ghost can't change someone's mind why do you think you will this is not the truth come on why why argue over the word of god why why are you i mean i've had folks and i say this in generality i've had folks argue with what you said and you say it's right here the brother branham said it that's not what he meant well i don't know what he meant then if that's not what he meant but there is literally in this case 111 quotes that say the same thing so the prophet of god missed the mark a hundred and eleven times yes now i'm not speaking proud of paul don't misunderstand i just said okay because if we've got all this evidence of scripture and quotes from the prophet and that won't change their mind why why would i argue why i would argue amen amen hold fast so it won't slip these things that are good hold fast to it after it's been proven right and anything that's proven not right turn it loose as quick as you can get away from it never hold on to the wrong thing that's it hallelujah that's it you see we have to do our diligence that's the homework who has to prove your calling an election not me if i'm preaching the truth to you and you should know whether i am or not if i'm preaching truth to you it's now on your court to prove your calling in your election amen well lord the preacher did this and i just couldn't believe any longer no no that's i'm sorry that won't work not a valid excuse amen you see what it is you know what doing your due diligence you know what your homework is saints some people disagree with me i'm sorry i hope that there isn't any here today but some people think their due diligence is to check the message and the bible against me you know what the prophet of god now this is kind of drawn out so you're not going to go just punch it and find some quote to it prophet of god shows that you doing your homework doing your due diligence is you checking yourself against this there's your due diligence not whether the preacher is right because i'll tell you right if you check yourself against this and the preacher is not right god will reveal to you that this is not right and god will deal with this man remove him off the scene or correct him or whatever but it won't matter if you got him corrected if yourself is not corrected it won't do hallelujah one bit of am i building a framework for the preacher no i'm not god hold him subject to the word every preacher that ever stands in this church god hold him subject to the word amen no no uh no ruling class no royalty no you know exemptions hold every one of us right to the word hallelujah hallelujah amen oh hallelujah now look i i wasn't going to preach long today and i'm sorry i really am i'm not apologizing but i just really look the court of law natural will not accept anything but a first-hand account aren't you glad i won't mention the song but those of you that were caught up in those things you'll know what it is you see you can't go into a natural court of law that i heard it from a friend who heard it from a friend did you see it yourself no witness dismissed holds no weight in the court of law now my brother and sister as the bride of christ god's not looking for us to show up with a second hand understanding a second hand revelation oh even a second hand forgiveness amen amen you got to get it firsthand you know i want to just say this and i say it with love maybe it's time we start proving the word ourself that's right well we believe our pastor is a holy ghost-filled man and he wouldn't preach anything false to us that's good i i would hope you feel that way but how about it's the season now for you to prove the word yourself how about it's time for you to dig into the word and be able to stand on your own feet and i'm not saying you're not okay i'm just preaching you might say well i don't want to call it a generality i hope it's pointed to those of you that don't but you need to be able to stand and say you know what the preacher might have slipped he might have just got confused there what he said but that don't line up and then i'm just going to paint a scenario you'd come to the pastor preacher minister whoever and say you said this and it doesn't line up now we're going to assume that this is a a godly man who cares and he's going to go oh my no no i knew that what did i say you said this and this oh you know what he'll do we'll come right up here and he'll say i'm sorry i didn't mean it that way i got i got two thoughts tied together and they've come out jumbled but you see if there's a contrary spirit what they're going to do is lean on you then you don't understand this is a revelation no i already got a revelation i've already been there i proved it myself i've got a revelation that i have a urem from them that i am allowed by god to take it right back and put it before the urum thumb and it didn't pass the test just saying just saying church hallelujah you see it's time for us to prove the word ourself to bring the testimony of a first hand experience amen why why brother paul you were talking about the word revealing the word that's right my brother and sister because the prophet of god said that as i said earlier the the preaching of the word will either open eyes or it will blind them amen now i i don't think i'll make it there so i'll just throw this in just as a deal let's deal with the story of naaman and we'll jump over all the time that gehazei walked with elisha years of faithful service but some garments and some gold busted that thing wide open now look where that story starts i'm going to ruin a future sermon here look where that story starts a little girl with a first-hand experience that says i would that my lord meaning her master naaman i would that my lord would know the god of israel starts with a little girl what a first-hand testimony she didn't sit in church dreaming about dolls she knew that god was real she maybe was a captive and you think god's forsaken her did he no it was god wanting to move in naaman's life sets it all up that a little girl was taken drunk full of sorrow and tears and fears and drug and now as a serpent in the house of name and and she had enough courage and enough backbone and enough revelation to say i would that my master brother chris we were we were talking and i like how he brought that he says there's something about the character of naaman that little girl didn't cringe in fear to mention the god of israel but the story goes on and here david goes following a little girl a servant a little girl's testimony and following that and he goes and he goes to elisha and he's there he's got all kinds of gifts it's not i don't think he had bribery in mind i think he was thinking reward right i mean as in thank you and but he goes and and elisha just tells him yeah go dip seven times in the river and he's rough oh but look how god sets the stage saints look how god's so in control and something has revealed the word amen the word revealing the word and so here he's roth isn't the waters of damascus isn't our waters of syria aren't they all superior and his master says but o master once again speaking of the character of naaman because he didn't cut his head off he said if he had asked you to do something great would you have not done it go read your bible naaman doesn't go and sit down and have to ponder this he hears these words and it pricks something in him and he said that's the truth if he'd asked me to do some great thing i would have marched right off to do it and his servant used as god's servant had faith the servant had faith get this saints it's not even written in the scripture the servant had faith in what elisha had told his master amen more faith than the master did himself lord master if he asked you to do something hard wouldn't you have done it amen hallelujah praise the lord why do we struggle so much with the little things saints why are we struggling you know so much with the little things god help us amen god help us the word's been revealed it's been revealed in us oh my god hallelujah now look at this i debated on whether to put this up because i feel like maybe i've been a little misunderstood in circumstances that have happened around this church lately but you see i was accused of calling people a wolf when i never mentioned their name i was speaking to a spirit people didn't accept that i could give you a quote right now where brother branham speaks on that not speaking to their names not speaking to their church their denominational names i try not to do that i'm speaking to the spirits that's exactly right now look at this it's possible now it is possible that staunch christians find people hold sometimes to the wrong thing thinking it's right that's right not exempt but then these things should be proven whether they are right or wrong now this might come across a little pointed i'm sorry if people would think it's pointed but when you come to someone and they are telling you the prophet said this the prophet said this prophet said and the day comes when all the evidence is laid in front of them that the prophet never ever said anything close to what they're saying and they'll look at you and say oh that was just a message myth what does this tell you see the writer is wrong i'm not going to abide you guys vote me out if you want no i'm not i don't misunderstand me vote me out if you want but as long as god and you allow me to stand here we're not going to run our church on a myth that's exactly right we're going to stand on this word right here it's either going to be right or wrong we're not looking at the human element well they said this and left an effort the but no i'm talking about the hardcore of the doctrine of this gospel amen we're not going to come but then these things should be proven whether they're right or wrong and it's the duty of oh look where it's headed here ouch ouch ouch ouch and it's the duty of all of us as we're expecting to go to heaven when jesus come and it's the minister's duty when any question is brought up that he solves this out and proves it before the people amen well hallelujah amen i won't say i do everything perfect right now i'll tell you right now what's happened in this church in the last year if i could do things different i would i'd have drawn the sword a lot sooner amen and i'd have done it a lot more private that's it if i had if i had the opportunity to go back i would have done that i would draw the sword a lot sooner and i'd have done it way more in private it would have never took place in our basement in our foyer in the back of our sanctuary when it never happened amen amen it's the duty of all of us can we say amen to that line as we're expecting go to heaven when jesus come and it's a minister's duty brother chris brother david brother paul can you say amen amen when any question is brought up he solves this out and then proves it before the people see some of this stuff you can't just brush it over and ignore it and let it go on it's got to be proved out before the people hallelujah that they might understand because no one wants to be found wrong holding the wrong thing so we have a scripture jesus said all scriptures must be fulfilled that we should prove all things and then hold fast or hold tight get a death grip on it and don't turn it loose hold fast to that which is good hallelujah sometimes we look at these things my brother and sister and jump right in here and and uh we look at things and if we're we're not careful we kind of just breeze over them amen brother adam has a boat i bought one this last year you got to use it a little bit i'm telling you something you don't breeze over putting the drain plug in you can breeze over a lot of things i like an evinrude i like a mercury i want a yamaha i want this i want that i want a prop boat i want a jet boat i want to whatever but you better possess is a drain plug because no matter what else you've got and how you think how pretty your boat is and how many money you spent on it or whatever it is if you don't put that drain plug in there you don't have a boat that's right hallelujah amen so there comes a time my brother and sister that we not the preacher amen although the words talking about he needs to explain this but it's going to come to a time it's going to come right back to you that you have to prove all things is the message real or not yes sir i'm not going to speak ill of you if you decide it's not real i'll pray for you but you see you have to i have to prove it to ourself this is what i'm going to stake my whole life on amen now we come to a conclusion such a conclusion as we've already found in the word okay so brother brown is not taking us on a brother branham conclusion it's a conclusion found in the word as much as we believe in trying to find the oldest i read this quote to you just the other day if you got best manuscripts to get the best record of the word possible we will never get the true meaning of it by study or comparison of scriptures sincere as we may be it will take a revelation from god to bring it out that's exactly what paul said which things we also speak not in words which man's wisdom teaches but which the holy ghost teaches first corinthians 2 13 the true revelation is god interpreting his own word by vindicating what is promised now don't let anybody be misled by what i have said and think that i do not believe in the accuracy of the word as we have it now have it i believe this bible is accurate jesus completely authenticated the old testament when here on earth and it was compiled exactly as was our new testament make no mistake about it we have the infallible word of god today and no man dares take it take from it or add to it but we need the same spirit that gave it what is this this is the word revealing the word amen not not another spirit trying to interpret the bible not another ideology interpreting the bible but the same spirit amen that gave it to teach it to us and how we need revelation by the spirit we don't need a new bible we don't need a new translation though some are very good and i'm not against it but we need the revelation of the spirit and thank god hallelujah can we thank god hallelujah thank god we can have what we need for god wants to reveal his word to us by the spirit it is not us getting down and begging and sobbing till god feels sorry for us it is god wanting to reveal himself to you and i he's here please ask please ask no cry out for it i'm here here's the word here's the spirit amen oh hallelujah i believe this with every fiber within my body so i'm either really crazy or really revelated you pick amen amen may god begin by his spirit to give us see i labored on this the other day so i'll try not to labor so long not some spotty thing it did not saints stop in 1965. god is revealing himself to his bride this very bride that was chosen and their names wrote in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world god's word is revelating them with life-giving and prevailing revelation and if the church could only get fresh revelation amen you know what that is some of you don't like this you go study that out the antonym fresh or stale oh that makes some people a plain upset like yo you are just almost but look god don't want you to live on yesterday's manna hallelujah fresh manna every single day and become by it the living word manifested oh look at this saints come on what is this the word revealing the word and so by it the living word so if we have him we can never become stale we cannot we cannot wither away we cannot come to the place that the revelation has drifted into nothing amen hallelujah i'll tell you what the difference is between this bride of christ and the prophet of god said this bride will never ever become a denomination you know what the difference is we look at it like well okay this says no what it is my brother and sister there's a difference in the nature of the people some are willing to take this oh pardon me for saying it this way i don't know another word ah lord check me i'm not going to put it out there that way they're going to take this here but there's some over here says i need it fresh lord your word says your mercies are new every morning your mercies are new every morning lord i need it fresh this morning you see i'm not able to live on last two weeks last month's last year last decade last decades that's right lord i need it fresh i don't know saints am i misreading this if i am forgive me i would never do it intentionally but you see god didn't intend for us to look backwards no the prophet of god's own words you know this is something pardon me time is fleeting but pardon me saints look at this the prophet of god himself instills us writing the message he tells us don't look in that rearview mirror if you look in the rearview mirror you are sure to crash but that was something different was it no no i think it applies right here saints amen do we deny history you know i don't know who wrote it there's a quote says you know for those who refuse to acknowledge history or something they're doomed to repeat it i acknowledge it in the same fashion that i acknowledge i was a sinner saved by grace but wait my name was in the lamb's book of life what was it i skipped over that and we will skip over that today the prophet of god says that revealing of the word is the washing that's it it's a washing of the water of the word and i'm telling you you're never going to find a bowl of the northern province of the ling dynasty and see what it is if you don't wash it and this bride of christ will never be revealed in this 21st century for who she is until she comes under that washing of the word and the more that the word brother brown says that washing of the word is hearing the word preached amen the preaching of the word amen amen wow what is it washing amen it's washing you and i now look at this we're already i'm closing sister emmy will you come amen oh you see my brother and sister it's that washing of the word some people say well okay praise the lord i've been washed for the word and now god sees me no no no no god knew what you were in the beginning right all the way back to the lamb's book of life god knew what you was this washing of the water is revealing who you are to you [Music] it's revealing to you who you are now take this over here to the prophet of god's words and he says when the bride sees who she is she will become an invincible army not how many books and tapes she's listened to not how many books she possesses but it's when she sees who she is oh hallelujah are you with me today the water of the word washing us what is it the word revealing the word hallelujah and in that we start to see who we are and we no longer are tossed by every temptus we're not tossed to and fro every wind of doctrine amen hallelujah oh hallelujah oh my god i i just got to stop i just got way too much stuff left hallelujah aren't you glad the words being revealed amen aren't you glad that the holy ghost the word coming down is taking all the little isms and schisms and all these little concepts and just washing them away hallelujah amen i tell you it's interesting you can walk the beach lord's blessed sister jerry and i to vacation in hawaii and it is a very interesting place people i've had people tell me well it's just a cesspool well i'm here to tell you there's plenty of places there that you can get off and jerry and i've walked a beach before for i felt like miles i don't know how long it was run into two or three people and they were people our age dressed decent just out enjoying it go there's sure enough cesspool's there but you know what i noticed i've never really voiced this before i don't even know if i voiced its sister jerry a little revelation the lord struck on my heart one day i'm walking down the beach there's just all kinds of stuff washed up on the beach trash [Music] you walk down the beach and there's places there's nothing you start paying attention you see my brother and sister this part it's washing it away [Music] but there are those that all of life just brings the trash to them and there's those that it washes it away from them now that sounds simple enough i'm not trying to make a big deal it's just something that struck my heart i thought look at this every day be out there snorkeling swimming with the turtles and you just recognize this big chunk of rock that's out there the waves splashing over on the south side of that is all the trash on this side it's clean you see we're gonna choose which side the rock we swim on we're gonna choose which place we want to dwell but you see the word of god to the bride of christ is washing her he's washing it away he's revealing who she is and i believe with all my heart that's what the prophet was meaning when he said when the bride sees who she is you see i wasn't called to have a lot of trash washed into my life i was called to have it washed away and that's what i want to look to and when i go to prove the word some people will say well prove you're in the bride i'm sorry i can't i have no literal tangible evidence to lay on a desk before you [Music] i have a revelation i know what god's doing i know how he's changing how he's sweeping through my life how things that i used to find tolerable i no longer find tolerable why because he's washing the layers off and under that is a bowl of the northern dynasty that's worth millions of dollars hallelujah [Music] hallelujah amen brother jason help me let's just sing a couple songs let's stand and just worship the lord today some things that uh i felt checked today i just asked for you to pray for me saints i'm just gonna be transparent with you i've always tried to be and i will remain that way sometimes our natural flesh wants to just drive that home this comes a time god says move on move on you whip the amalekites once don't hang out in a malachite bill just so you can come back and whip them tomorrow and the day after and the day after i didn't call you to sit around the malachite bill and whip up on the kites i called you to go to the promised land the only way you're going to make it to that land is just keep right on keeping right on and lord that's what i want to do hallelujah i just pray that god will help his saints that we will place such a tremendous value on the truth of this message that we won't let anything come oh hallelujah i bless

feelings get hurt she's not going to feel like somebody's picking on her in fact there's another quote i think it's of tozer which is another man of that generation it says something of the nature of
