you've placed in US the ability to hear that call to respond to that call our Lord that call was meant to be heeded Lord you would have a people that would hear and respond and I say Lord thank you for calling us thank you Lord for your grace and your mercy today Lord how you would come and just remind us Lord so many ways father that you love us and you have our best interest in mind Lord it just draws us to you and father I come today in my own heart just crying out Lord feed me feed me father that Lord my soul would be full no room for anything but you Lord we say thank you from our hearts Lord just ask your father for those not present today Lord you know their circumstance just ask you Lord to touch lives Lord father draw us nigh to you ask in your precious name Hallelujah amen a couple little quick announcements let's not forget communion tonight five o'clock and young peoples this Friday uh at seven young peoples will actually be here at the church and grace kids will be a brother Sergey sister Julia's house there always so gracious I feel so bad as it is but it's our kids and maybe I could even say their kids that are tearing up their house so but anyway we sure appreciate the sacrifice that they make amen the ballots uh for the affirmation of offices will be handed out at the end of service uh you do not have to worry about filling them out today just sometime and uh the next week or two you can just place them in the offering basket and the brothers will deal accordingly amen I want to speak to you today you know it's um sometimes God just uh I'm just very moved by the song service Myself by the prayer over the request because you see many times God just gives us words of affirmation just reminds us he speaks to us the certain thoughts that you've been having something you might have read and then it is spoken or touched upon and you realize okay we are in the mind of Christ he is dealing with us as a people and we are very blessed and speaking of being blessed our our brother Jake uh travel all the way from Twin Falls you know Uber might have been cheaper than a Peterbilt but uh uh but he drove up one to be in church today and we're happy for that and um amen our sister Alice and sister Andrea and uh I I they didn't come to see their daughter their sister they come to see us uh so but we're just so happy it's like they're like family and and each and every one amen just so happy to have all of you here today uh God rich and mercy Amen to to bring that and uh God bless you brother Paul and your family amen good to see you today uh but uh you know it's raining a little bit outside but that just makes the the sun shine brighter on the inside amen and we're happy amen I want to speak to you today on The Measure of a Man uh you know it's quite interesting how God works I I went to bed last night with some of these same same thoughts but woke up and um just the Lord just dealt uh I concerned kindly and I hope today that I can I can share that Lord just speaking to my heart last night and so as we look at this we want to take as it is the measure of a man and realize that this is not to the man gender but to mankind uh the body of Christ the body of Believers amen so if we'll just turn in our Bibles to a very very uh well-known very uh often read a bit of scripture in Romans 12 and uh you know it's there that we we just the Lord just spoke to me through this scripture and I pray that I can just uh convey this and and uh in a beneficial way you know that you'd go away and say that was good amen Romans 12 1-5 I beseech thee therefore brethren so he has identified who he's speaking to he's not he's not talking to the people down in the marketplace or the court is talking to uh the body of Believers amen I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God and I I'm not going to preach down this line so I want to make this comment kind of tying back to Wednesday night Satan wants to throw our flesh into the Limelight that we would convince ourselves that we're not acceptable now if you can get somebody to be so anointed to pick a fight and you just get to stand back and watch them fight my that's the ultimate and Satan then plants a seed and watches us fight and what are we fighting actually against the word that is written of us so we're denying the very word of God that God said and Satan can then step back and just watch us fight well we're here to let Satan know that no longer are we going to fight his fight for him amen acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man The Measure of Faith for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members of one another so when Satan can come and cause us to war against the word we're actually separating ourself out of the body so it's not just our internal battle that we fight and sorry for a very poor analogy but if some member of your physical body was separated from you right now it would affect the whole body so when Satan convinces one to war against themselves against the word he's affected the whole body Heavenly Father we ask you Lord Jesus Lord just come and speak to our hearts today and make this word so real make it so living father that we can't live without it that it becomes our very thought the very substance of our being our very strength father and also our vision your word says that without a vision the people perish but father this Vision might not be a vision for the bride of Christ it might be for just a member of that body Lord let us have the correct vision Lord to see you and Lord let this body Lord Jesus let it be father that we could come today and by your grace father we could take measure of ourselves by the word of God by the anointing of your Holy Spirit Lord that we could stand and say truly I am a member of this great and glorious body bless the time together today Lord in your precious name amen you may be seated it is my brother and sister that I would like to just start by the definition of maze measure it is a mount on a degree of something uh something used to measure things a unit used in measuring and it could also be described as a suitable limit and so we would look at this today my brother and realize that the limit that God has given to the bride of Christ is the full word of God Amen we can say well I I'm just going to limit what I do you know if I used to drink two soda pops a day I'm gonna drink one it still isn't good for us amen amen my crusade I'm I'm becoming more and more of an anti soda pop you know but we won't put it in our covenants or anything here in the church but look at this my brother and sister sometimes our idea of what we're limiting or majoring or doing is still insufficient it still is either too far one way or not far enough another and we realize that what we're looking for and the songs that we sang uh this morning really touched my heart because you see my brother and sister what God is doing he's pouring out a measure and the scripture says that he's given to every man a Measure of Faith now my brother and sister you would look and say well this brother has great faith well I'm here to tell you that the measure that God poured out to you was sufficient for your life amen it isn't that it seems as though this one has a greater Measure of Faith but God said I know what they will face and I know what you will face and I have given you a measure that is sufficient and we'll hit upon this and why I I want to put it this way in just a little bit but you see my brother and sister this measure God has given us is a measure of what God has given us it's not what the message as it were like meaning a church and all of this it isn't what this person and that person has given to you but it's what God has given and so we will see today in this thought for just a little while many references of a measure and I took these by going through the message and uh just taking phrases as it were words that the prophet of God now I didn't take all of them uh because we certainly uh you know would need a lot more time but brother Branham makes these references down through the message and one of the first ones that comes up is the measure of time and so we have been given a measure of time and in that we realize the scripture has declared that each every one of us has been allotted a certain amount of days amen and we've been given a measure of Grace and I say thank you Lord and the word says his grace is sufficient so that measure here again is sufficient for everything that you and I will face in our life we can't say oh my I've used up all my grace I have sinned my grace away I've consumed it my brother and sister God has never given a short measure Amen in fact the scripture talks about an unjust balance and God would not hold an unjust balance to such a position if he was going to turn around and be an unjust balance so it's there that we realize that whatever happens in our life that the grace we've been given the measure of it is sufficient the prophet of God says that there's a measure of God and we we won't go through each one of these to to lay that Foundation you have access amen and then he comes and speaks of a Measure of Faith now my brother and sister are often times we'll put Faith as a higher level but you know the word tells us to be good stewards of our time as I already said he says that the grace he has given is sufficient and he's our God Amen some people get a little confused they say well is it God is it Jesus Christ is it the Holy Ghost the prophet of God said they're all the same amen this is all the same so whether you use this phrase or this phrase and you know some people say Lord bless you amen I by habit I guess say God bless you now my brother and sister if one says Lord bless you and I say God bless you we're saying the same thing amen but people get caught up in verbiage and and they just not let they didn't say that right I don't know that I can agree they didn't say that right well let's make sure we took it back to the word and balanced it before we decide the wrong amen and so it is that we look at this this Measure of Faith we oftentimes talk faith is a very common subject now amongst uh Christians and and it's there that we talk about Lord increase my faith do you realize my brother and sister before the foundation of the world God gave you every drop of faith you'll ever have prophet of God using the example of every Apple that was ever going to be in that tree was in that tree when it was still a seed amen so the faith that God wanted you to have has already been given to you what we're working on is releasing the faith amen setting the atmosphere that faith can actually work amen so we can't lead living or dwelling or fellowshipping in a realm of Doubt where people say well we don't think brother random meant it that way even though he said it that way and my brother and sister what it is is Satan is undermining your faith in the word that you now start to judge and and they start doing this you know I find this interesting I'm just going to throw this out I hope you don't mind but you know you deal with somebody and you know they say well you know that's that's uh that's how you see the message my brother and sister if they can get you to question revelation you see your job is to run it through the filter of the word I can't run it through the filter for you because you see I look at it differently than you do I want to stay focused so when we talk about faith my brother and sister some are over here in the realm Satan battering them and they've been hanging out with somebody who's got a distorted view of the message or has no view of the message and they're crying out Lord Give Me Faith I want to believe Lord I want to have faith to believe this if this is the truth let's just cut it to the chase let's just bring it real simple Lord if this is truth you don't need Faith to believe this message my brother and sister you need a revelation of whether it is truth or not just cut and dried okay can we just make it cut and dry Lord I need to see is this truth or not amen now when you see its truth you will need Faith to apply it to your life but my brother and sister it doesn't take Faith to believe it takes revelation amen so it's there that we would say well I'm I'm wavering I don't know I feel pulled to this Lord help my faith no Lord come and confirm to me what is truth and then give me strength to follow the truth amen because when the word is opened to us this is a little direct I hope you don't think it's rude but my brother and sister when the word is open to us by Revelation you will look at that and contrary to everything the world believes your soul will grab a halt of that and say by Revelation this is truth period not if I feel like it's truth or not if I no it's truth amen and the word of God I'm going to read you a quote a little later but God can be blunt my brother and sister God's voice can be blunt and it's there sometimes we think well if we can change this if we can change that Brother Paul's real bad about that do you know that well if I hadn't said preach a sermon oh if I hadn't said this and if I hadn't done that now oh it would have been a better service my brother and sister brother David he's not here to defend himself but he caught up with me here recently and said brother Paul when are you going to accept the fact that what you said was what God wanted you to say and I'm like but brother and sister Faith doesn't have a butt he says this is the word this is God and I believe it and I'm holding on to that and so we certainly need that Measure of Faith because without faith my brother and sister the word tells us in my words you will accomplish nothing who wants to accomplish something in Christ of course in Christ not in our own flesh in Christ Amen brother Brown goes on and uses the term a measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ amen now that is if you've ever been in a business meeting you know maybe your Banker is showing you your cash flow for the year he's got a graph right there and he's like now here your cash flow is doing real great we got right here in the summer doldrums and you had almost no cash flow and uh then you this and then you that and you can follow this this graph this deal uh you know a heart monitor is really a graph is what it is it's telling you what's happening at the moment amen and sometimes that when it gets to be a flat line tells you the moment's not good and so we'll look at this when we have this measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ now just bear with me a little bit I can't explain it all in this service and keep it in a reasonable time but now we're looking at the graph of where we fit in the stature I I want to know that I want to know if I am not matching up to the stature of the fullness of Christ then I say Lord help me help you let the word come let us speak to me I Lord even if it scrapes the hide off me I need to know where I stand because I want to hear those words well done my good and faithful servant I don't want to go to church for 40 years to hear this and say well you have fallen short amen so Lord give us a graph let it be clear to me oh give me the word amen not watered down doesn't have to be profound now there's nothing wrong don't discard these brothers that are very profound speakers amen that just really rivet you my don't discard that my brother and sister but don't make that or prerequisite whether you're going to apply it to your life or not well you know it just doesn't move me like this brother does well if it was a word it better be moving you amen Hallelujah and then he says the measure of manifestation my brother and sister we look at this and sometimes we if we're not careful we will look and say well praise God look at this Revelation in the message look at this Revelation look at this scripture look at this look at this is this but my brother and sister this same graph that we were talking about might have another flip side to it that might actually show is this word that we say Amen to moving my heart monitor because if the word we're saying Amen to doesn't move the monitor amen doesn't change the graph at all amen then we've got a serious problem I think they call it a flat line and there's no recovery from Flatline unless somebody's got the courage hand me the paddles reminds me of a story true story in an airport man has a heart attack falls down literally right in front of one of those defibrillator things that's in the wall and this guy had watched enough now get this this true story the guy had watched enough medical TV foreign to know that you take those things and you put them on the person and you do you know you shock them and people are all like oh call security call this call that and he's like nothing bust the door open grab that thing everybody stand back bam nothing happened bam nothing happened bam enough nope there's a twitch later in the hospital the doctors are like sir if you hadn't persisted it was that last time that brought him back to life and I'm telling you Saints God is here to shock you if that's what it takes to put life back in you and it might be a shock in finance it might be a shocking relationship it might be a shock in your health or a health of someone around you it might be a shock in the church but God's willing to shock you as many times as it takes to put life back into you amazing then the man had to admit to the doctor all he knew about such things as what he had watched on television I'm sure sister April will agree with this the doctor's like oh no but it worked God God might use the song leader might use the prayer over the prayer requests he might use a visiting preacher he might use whoever sometimes it's not about even exactly what was said but the shock so God says you know what I want to do I want to see a measure of manifestation of the word I give you here's your portion of the word I want to see a result from it I want to see it change your life I want to see you find it King David mentioned to the the young adults that you know sometimes God works in different ways and God started with King David started with David when nobody even dreamed he'd be a king and here's David and God's working with him David didn't walk out and say well praise God I'm gonna I'm gonna kill Goliath I'm gonna do this word no what did he do God God started meeting him and lose God started touching him here touching him here answering a prayer here something happening here and he's got a bear and he's got a lion and when he gets there to Goliath it's not about will you know I don't know I can just know he was there looking this is what my God can do anything he didn't put a limitation on God well you know glass way bigger than a bear he's way bigger than a lion I don't know about this no what God had placed in that heart and that Faith to know that God is God and I trust him and my brother and sister that's one of the issues that's wavering in the message today is the devil has slipped in enough and there's been enough disappointments of life that people are coming and they say I trust God but they don't I lift my hand I have the season I've had the time I've had the circumstance that I say oh lord your will is perfect while I'm trying to fix it and what God wanted us to do is sit back and say Lord I I I'll give you I'll give you the whole situation now I know this is just a crazy way to put it but you know there was some singer singer song Lord take the wheel they got their foot on the break the clutch the gas pedal Lord you can have the wheel my brother and sister God wants a complete surrender Amen in fact you might as well just go ahead and climb in the backseat and let him take control because if we don't there won't be any manifestation or as the Old Testament says God in those times made it such paraphrasing that there was no way Israel could say we did this maybe we need a 21st century event like that but wouldn't that be a shock that God would put us in such a position that we possib not possible for us impossible for us but God's still God and he's still got a people that trust him isn't an interesting Saints how God tests us with time recently had a little interaction in a conversation you wonder how people could sit they could be the house of God for 40 years and as it would be year 41. they wake up one day and say this is this is all false I've been in a cult for 40 years sounds shocking doesn't it now if they really are in a cult is it okay to speak straight if they really are in a cult they must not have been checking out the word of God in the last 40 years and if they've been checking out the word of God for the last 40 years they would know right where they stand not a shock out of the dark you mean I've been in a cult for 40 years and I didn't even know it oh all it tells me is you haven't been in your Bible but it also tells me if they had been in their Bible they would stand up and say revelation of Jesus Christ will stand the test of time it will no longer be my Revelation it will no longer be what I know what I can do what I see what I understand it's back to the word and the word will stand the test of time and so as we see this test of time coming my brother and sister what will happen is we will either go stronger with time or we will grow weaker with time and you'll see the very nature of the Bride of Jesus Christ the manifested word is not getting weaker my brother and sister we are seeing a bride who's recognizing who she is and as she comes and takes a halts of the word she's finding that the word is being manifested and we don't have to go look to Africa or Europe or somewhere else we can look right in the mirror of our own house and see that the word is coming stronger and stronger and stronger and the battle and the victory in the Old Testament it says and the victory is mine amen I can look in the mirror and say this victory of the word is mine amen I don't have to ask permission to be victorious I don't have to beg the devil to let me be victorious I can look at the word and the word speaks back to me and says you are victorious and I'm on this side as it were the mirror of the word saying I am victorious amen Hallelujah see my brother and sister we're not here to grow weaker and weaker and weaker and we're there Lord let the Rapture take place quickly Lord because I'm getting weaker no sir my brother and sister this word manifested the power coming from this we were Hallelujah the line of tribe of Judah just let me lay it as this example was just a little kitten in our life at one stage there was a time that the lion of the tribe of Judah had a purr not a roar but you give that lion time and it is rising up and it's consuming amen the carcass and the lion is growing and growing and growing and then one day Satan says I think I'll go over there I think I'll bother that part of the bride of Christ and he realizes it's not a little kitten any longer it's a lion of the tribe of Judah and the word is coming forth with power in a thought Authority it's coming for changing the world around it and when this lion roars my brother and sister the rest of the world false silent oh Hallelujah we've been given a measure of time to live and I hate to admit this in public but I've sure wasted a lot of that time that God has given me but I'm not alone because the prophet of God says here I'm 50 years old and if I'm ever going to do anything for God I better get started you know he just said that for me no no you guys don't read that and claim it because I already claimed it he he said that Paul heylet down there 2023 Nampa Idaho is going to need some encouragement about this time he's wasted and so I'm going to say these words so he'll feel better about himself my brother and sister I well you know I'm telling the truth because I'm part of the Bride that's who he was speaking to um amen Hallelujah but you see my brother and sister were given a measure of time to live but it's also an appointed time you understand that a difference between the measure and being appointed and God didn't say I'm just going to measure this time out to you but when we sit down and people say I'm so thankful the message come my way you can flip through God's appointment book and there it is oh I'm so thankful God healed me go through the appointment book there it is God's given a pointed time for his word to come alive appointed time for healing virtue to flow a point of time for Revelation to come down and we need to be sitting here saying Lord I don't want to be late for my appointment I want to be on time so let me use my time wisely Hallelujah you know that come home to me the other day going to the dentist's office and coming from the house there's a route that I just drive to the dentist's office it's nice and easy and you know I get down there and the road's closed and so I drive down a mile and I'm going to go that way roads closed I drive down another mile road's closed and I'm like Mom what's wrong with these people and so then you know it's just the human nature I walk into the dentist's office and I know I know the receptionist very very well her family's a farm family that come from right out where we live and uh I walk in there and I'm like Lisa and she goes I know the roads were closed and I was like how did you know that she goes practically everybody that lives here lives out there and the roads are closed I was like good and even the dental hygienist comes in roads were closed weren't they yep okay but you see I hope you catch this even though I didn't know that was going to happen I was reactionary if I don't leave right this five ten minutes ago I'll be late so no wonder when I get to the obstacle I'm already frustrated I don't know what my it's a mess you know and then grandma I still don't think she saw me even we'll come down to this four-way at the same time I got there before she did I'm already stepping on the gas and Grandma looking straight ahead just drives out in front of me Saints we're taking communion tonight this is a confession I was like granny you need to get off the road and then I realize not only did granny I don't even see me she didn't hear me for sure so it wasn't about granny it was about me what am I doing with my time how am I managing my time how am I managing these segments of my life and so God comes and he says you know what I have an appointed time for you Paul it's called a season of restoration amen a season of repentance a season of preparation he gives us these Seasons that go with all of this that we can come and be ready for whatever comes our way can you tell me what tomorrow is we don't have a clue I was sitting there in the song service and I thought wouldn't this be just funny here it is coming up to to to uh you know preach and here we're in this communion tonight and I had just this most wicked chest pain just a few minutes ago make some of you nervous amen but I had this most wicked chest pain just just ripped through my chest and I was like great that's gonna be good I could just envision myself standing here in front of the church preaching to you and going [Music] and it's all over then my back popped him I felt better you see what if that was the appointed time I've been given plenty of preparation I've been given plenty of word to bring me to a place that instead of everybody freaking out he should have stopped and had a hallelujah praise God brother Paul beat us home but we don't operate that way but you see God wants us to be in that position Hallelujah so we have a season of preparation because the season of preparation also includes the season of restoration if we're going to be prepared to go home there has to be a restoring take place to put us that and my brother and sister that is the message of Malachi 4. Amen to restore us back to our rightful position it's not to create a new gospel from the Bible it's not to create some new Avenue or some new way but it's restoring us back to our rightful position that we can stand as men and women Sons and Daughters of God and stand in the mirror of God's word and take measure of ourself we can stand there and say Lord I want to judge myself I want to see myself in the Stark Clarity of your word so I can be prepared for that season now let's look here in the resurrection of Jairus daughter Amen brother Gideon if you'll put that up amen now we're living in the closing of this world's history the time is at hand the Gentile dispensation let me before you guys all get to reading that some of you guys are speed readers I can see it in your eyes amen I want you and realize God doesn't beat around the bush when we read this quote here I want you to just take this anchor that home God is not picking on people he's not a cruel God he's not a biased or Prejudice God he's just Direct he just says it how it's going to be the time is at hand the Gentile dispensation is winding up just like he did with the Jews he's showing a great measure of Grace to them making his last call so that the unbelievers will blaspheme the Holy Ghost and be worthy of the condemnation they're fixing to receive is that not straightforward my if we just went out in public and started saying that just like curse on curse on because you have to be what the Judgment says you are that's horrible in fact we say whoa you don't know whether that's the son or daughter of God or not so we shouldn't take that approach but look what God's doing behind the scene as it were they literally of their own free moral agency are putting themselves in a position that when judgment comes they deserve every drop of it now this is not in this quote let me just finish and then I'll expound upon that amen the condemnation they're fixing to receive but how blessed those will be that will stand out and outshine the Stars that'll believe on him and his great works of this day what is happening here my brother and sister if they are bringing themselves to be worthy of the condemnation that they are fixing to receive then let's look at what balances this and here's a bride that is going to be worthy to receive the blessing of almighty God and receive the word receive the life to receive Christ himself they're going to be worthy to receive that oh it makes my heart stirred I say thank you Lord thank you Lord and sometimes I feel weary I feel discouraged I feel like Lord what am I doing Lord I'm not good enough I can't I'm not qualified to do this but what's he doing he's making us ready to receive the accolades receive the glory receive him oh my brother and sister God this isn't arbitrarily you know if you've ever been on a Fourth of July parade or whatever you know and they have a float going down and they just throw candy they don't care where the candy goes they don't care that little kid's gonna have ten cavities when this is over we're just here throwing candy some people act like that's how God blesses people I'm sorry my brother and sister God's blessings are targeted they are pinpoint they are accurate and they are exactly what God wanted to give to you and I amen not no shotgun effect oh my brother and sister we've seen it happen in the world today that companies the minute they fired a Believer they don't find themselves rejoicing we got rid of this guy no they find themselves in financial problem what they didn't realize is they prospered because God was blessing that one man and then that one man a brother this is a true story that man went and found another job that paid even more had better consideration for a Christian boss but at the moment they said we're laying you off he didn't feel like that was a blessing he thought what did I do to deserve this it wasn't about what he did to deserve the firing it was about what he did to receive the blessing but the devil is going to put the firing you know the negative First and if we're not careful we embrace it but we've got to stop and say Lord there's a blessing hiding in here somewhere now it's really hard saints come on that's really hard amen Hallelujah we got Brothers with trucks here in the church and I can tell you I know what it's like be rolling across Wyoming and in one moment your engine purring like a kitten it was a cat and one minute it's purring like a kitten and the Nexus going what did I do deserve this Lord he's trying to take care of my family what I didn't know was God said I'm going to wean you from this and he did and I'm here today weaned from looking at the sunrise and sunset far away from home I'm weaned but you see God's call now look at this it says here that you know at the times at hand and he's winding it up and he's making a call right a great measure of his grace to them making his last call now look at this call my brother and sister it's calling out aren't you glad you heard the call amen is calling out this call has a voice now I don't have it right here in my notes but brother Brandon was preaching and he says I am God's voice to you and he says oh you didn't like that I'll say it again wow he didn't kowtow to that spirit that pushed back you know what it wasn't him it was a prophet he's standing there in an office not in his flesh in an office amen and I want you to catch that my brother and sister that we're not here in this church sitting here today in office of our flesh we are here in the office of Sons and Daughters of the almighty God and we're not sitting here in an office that we can be muffled in silence but we are sitting here as the very representation in my mole Hallelujah that when God we sing the songs we quote a quote he's in my feet he's in my hand he's in it he's walking in me he's talking in me my brother and sister realize that's your office the prophet of God wasn't William Branham preaching the gospel there's so many people they're like our Prophet William Branham that's good he is my Prophet but I got to have a revelation that he was in an office and in that office he was standing there the very voice of almighty God speaking not a man not flesh God speaking and it's not you a man or a woman standing here today it's God in you speaking because this is his office today Hallelujah not call has a voice and it was meant to be responded to amen that voice is not just meant for us now pardon me if you don't respond that way I'm not meaning anything to you but it's not for us to just say her and say no I I could see that that has some value that's that's a little marriage I'll consider that well you'll consider it right because you'll walk out of here and somebody'll ask you how your job is your car is your garden is your whatever is and you'll forget totally about these things because it takes a reaction to the calling to Anchor it in the soul amen and when you sit here and say that's the truth thank you Lord you're not talking to Paul Paul's this in an office you're talking to almighty God it's not I'm amen I don't like to amen the preacher well don't amen the preacher amen the word talk to God amen because this Hall is a call that was meant to be responded to amen nowhere in the scripture does it say mentally calculate this as being true or not Hallelujah because you see what God's doing my brother and sister he's showing his great Measure of Faith to them amen what's he doing he's meeting out he's dispensing that's what the word beats out is dispensing God is dispensing his grace to you and I through the preaching of the word well it'd be easier if we could just get up and take two in the morning with a glass of water how do you know you got faith I take it every morning at 6am of course I've digested it in six hours so by the time quitting time and rush hour traffic and home with the wife and the children my faith is completely absent seriously now God gave you this Faith it's here it's present but it needs exercised now I wished I had some kind of arm that I could put up here and show you guys you know now this is what exercise does for you but anyway uh not not my arm that I hope that maybe somewhere someone would recognize you know what Hallelujah my faith muscle my faith muscle is growing amen it's stronger than it's ever been it's not getting weaker with time my faith muscle is growing Hallelujah and we're not gonna oh pardon me this could sound strange but we're not going to stand in front of a mirror or stand in front of the rest of the body and say look at me no sir our faith muscle is there to meet every challenge of the day that God called us to he said I didn't send you in laodicea be consumed amen that Satan in the imitation of the Lion of Judah has come roaring like a lion I didn't come and call you to collapse under that I was reading a book this guy was a hunter at the turn of the century uh 19th to the 20th century and he was a hunter this actually took place in India and the man there was a man-eating Lion and the man was a professional Hunter and he comes there and and he's killed many an animal traveled all over the world and killed many a problem animal that was his specialty and one day there's this man-eating lion that's been snatching the women and the children as they would go down to the water hole it's obviously none of the men ever carried water because there was none of them at the water hole but anyway it was there that these women and these children are down at the water hole and this lion would come out ground one of them run off they were all afraid the village running out of water and when they would go down there they would have all these men surrounding a few to carry this water now amazing the men were carrying a sword weighed 7.65 pounds and the women were carrying two big jugs that weighed about 90. so you know equality but but this man goes to hunt this lion and he's only God another man with him and he said I I've hunted many an animal but I got down in the bush there in the evening time and it was so quiet and he said I walked so carefully I never heard the lion but something in me sensed it and from one step to the next I was shaking and looking around where is he that's the average Christian that's the average Christian we're terrified is that what we were called to be amen praise God I was called to be terrified and laodicea I'm fulfilling my calling no sir I was called to be an overcomer I was called to be victorious amen I was called not to be a prisoner not to be a prisoner my brother and sister to fear but to be able to stand up and say praise God I am weak Lord but Thou Art strong Hallelujah Hallelujah let me hurry along here my Hallelujah let's just go into this real quick have faith in God alongside come Pentecost and measure down the gift of the Holy Spirit speaking with tongues and signs but we're just letting a big gap through let's tonight lay the measure of God down and measure the whole word of God did you guys read between the lines there we can take speaking in tongues and all of that and call it but the prophet said lay all that down step back from that take the whole word take the whole word we're not nearly as sensational Saints I mean you guys that all laugh and I break an ankle but you know we're not here jumping off the platform bouncing off everything and screaming and hollering dancing and spinning on one toe and doing all this all that so excited people get all excited but I'll tell you what I want to do I want to walk out of here and when I hit laodicea face to face I want to be able to live it I want to walk out there and be victorious I don't want to have to go back to church to put my dancing shoes on I want to be able to live out there and walk and talk and live in the presence of almighty God day by day on trial by trial struggle by struggle and at the same time might be a weary enough old guy to not be able to hardly jump off the off the the floor and not be on I tried clicking my heels sometime back I was like oh you know click your heels anyway it takes a degree of coordination that I don't have let's let us tonight lay the measure of God down and measure the whole word of God the same holy ghost that fired the Piston back there that brought them out by faith justification the same one gave sanctification the same one gave the baptism of the Holy Ghost that same power that same Holy Ghost can move the church to Perfection we can look Mark and say praise God we used to dance in the spirit I'm not concerned about dancing in the spirit I'm concerned by looking at the word am I coming into Perfection amen I could dance dance and be lost while I'm dancing but if I'm coming into the Perfection of the word amen I might not dance but I will be perfect in Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah now I know a lot of people will tell you those two got to be connected together but at my studies of the scripture I haven't found where it says that I have to scream and shout and dance to be perfect before God but I have found the word that says my life has to match the word perfectly oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Somebody Pray I'll get motivated to move on here move the church to Perfection and it will do it to everything that God has promised in his word God will do it the trouble of it is let's cast out the world let's measure God's word and it's the truth have faith in God Jesus said for a thou shall say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt it it'll do just what you tell it to do isn't that wonderful I say that's wonderful Hallelujah let's measure up I don't care the lutherans are fine the Baptists are fine methodists are fine the Pentecostals are fine all these different things is all right but let's put it right down and say every word of God is true there's what it all comes down to everything God said is perfect and if he said whatsoever things oh oh Lord where's this Measure of Faith you're given me see God will put us to the test Saints we can say we've got Measure of Faith yeah you're right Satan I must not be a real believer because I struggle about speaking to that mountain well I mean our temper can be a mountain can't it our lack of patience or judgmental I didn't mean to say that out loud in church okay I already let it out our judgmental spirits some people's lives they're mountains some people's lives it's uh overwhelming well you know brother Alex and sister Yulia Vanessa vika sang that special but to my very well-trained musical ear did you guys notice how they started that one verse just a little slow you think I'm being ridiculous don't you but I know a brother that quoted a quote in church forgot to put a the on the very first word of the quote and the hammered for not quoting all of the quote are we raising the bride or heard of legalists come on come on well they didn't do it right well let's follow you for a while now I'm not saying that to defend anything I'm just telling you my brother and sister there comes a time that we need to have as much grace needed to them as is meeting to us and if we have had Grace meeted to us now I'm being facetious I guess I should just put that up front but could there be anyone today that would raise their hand and say never had any Grace meted to me and then come to the alternate repent for being a liar right so let's meet Grace out amen whether it's in the church or out in the world meet Grace out to them so that we can have the measure of Grace meeted back to us in our time of trouble amen amen hallelujah say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt it it'll do just what you tell it to do isn't that wonderful people say well I've spoke to the mountain I spoke to it brother I've had it and told me brother Paul I've spoke to it and nothing happened really you're a real believer you've got a prayer life you read the word of God you are consecrated you're dedicated and the devil's got you convinced it's your prayer did nothing no the devil's a liar you might not see what it did you might not see what it did for years amen look our brother Stan price shared a testimony about his daughter and condition in certain circumstance there and he said it broke him and sister merlene's hearts to basically stand on the word and tell their daughter no broke her heart and the daughter got truly upset about it she was not happy you know or Christian parents with this but later they stood on the word not on opinion not an emotion not anything they stood on the word and they said we can't do that honey it's against the word and later God comes in a supernatural way changes it all Lord help us Lord help us brother Bram says God let me lay my measuring stick down on my soul and spread it across God's word to say God it's the truth send the unction of the Holy Ghost and the Fire and Fire the cylinder above me I'll believe every word of it and you'll see things take place man I was just reading my Bible this morning Saints and I come across the scripture it was a little bit painful but I sat right there in my office in the wee hours this morning just had to take the measuring stick and lay it across me and say Lord help me help me Lord because at this moment I'm not Measuring Up and amazing the preacher is not exempt from the sermon but I tell you Lord I want I want to measure up my heart's desire is to measure up it's what I long for it's what I cry out for Lord let me measure up but you know what happens we'll measure ourselves to others well praise God I might not be what I should be but I'm doing better than he is and look at this praise God my family they're way way better off her way than this then these than them well look at the graph my family's doing better than 96.6 percent of church praise God our church doesn't have problems like their Church hmm what yardstick are we using my it's not God's yardstick but the minute Saints we take this yardstick and we start I'm trying to break my habit I honest I am about involving all of you I should just preach to you brother Stan Smith said you don't have a clock on the back of your church so that I could stare at I mean what does it stand price yeah he joked with me got no clock for me to stare at in the back of the church so I had to stare at the doorknob well I don't do very good at storing door knobs I want to stare at you but you know what happens a minute I put this yardstick on my life brother Trevor sister Carrie sister Sue Vanessa Titus all get real blurry and they just disappear out of sight because all I could see is my life at the yardstick and you know I will come back to judging you guys just as soon as I get every moat out of my eye hopefully that's before the rapture otherwise I'll need a huge measure of Grace it will be God is good how do we measure up do we come up short well it almost rhymed this morning it did in the early hours there uh it come up really good yeah come up short don't give up amen Press On to the mark of the high quality Ryan Philippians 3 amen we're not here my brother and sister I count not myself to have apprehended in other words I've got it and you don't but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind me that are baggage that are holding me back and I am reaching forth into those things which are before me and it's because of that Revelation I can press to the mark of the prize of the high calling in God in Christ Jesus amen but look what he comes right down in verse 15 let us therefore as many as be perfect what we've got all this baggage we've got all these things we're distracted by and then he turns right around from one verse or a couple verses comes right back those of us that are perfect you see one he can deal with the flesh that we got to keep pressing on you're looking at this get rid of the baggage then he's telling you you're perfect amen as we be thus minded if anything be otherwise minded God shall reveal this even unto you what's he doing coming right down our prayer life in our days that we're reading the Bible hearing the prophet listening to music maybe preaching of the word and God reminds you of what you did that you need to correct hallelujah thank you Hallelujah we're we're getting close amen show us the father now I love this quote I I don't know that it totally fits in but I think it does so hopefully you agree any man that's ever had any made any showing at all in this life has been man who has trusted God and took him at his word right man that doesn't take him at his word never amounts to a hill of beans we've had a George Washington and Abraham Lincoln whatever more but the greatest men that the world has ever had has been those who put their simple faith in God Hallelujah simple faith why didn't the prophet of God say all of those that explained the seals those that can explain the Thunders and the vials and how they all connect together he said those who put their simple faith sister vika if you'll come my brother and sister this is the measure of the man being able to put our simple faith in Christ Jesus Hallelujah well I'll tell you what I had a brother tell me once he goes you know brother Paul he said my church is not the most spiritual church okay where are you going with this brother [Music] not the most spiritual said we never had anybody speak in tongues in our church [Music] we did once and it shocked all the church so bad everybody's stunned for 15 minutes you know like [Music] I don't know maybe it was our critical spirit that caused it to never happen again I don't know my church is not a spiritual church brother Paul okay [Music] what I call a little gleam in his eye not real spiritual but God answers our prayers well okay you don't call that spiritual where I come from we call that spiritual you talk to God and God talks back to you yeah you know and then you meet these people and you realize what he's talking about they're just a bunch of overall wearing gingham gown like brother Brown talked about they're just these normal people they're just y'all how you doing brother you know what is spiritual what is great what is great in the eyes of man is not great in the eyes of God Lord measure us for the Alex if you'll come Lord measure Us by Your Word no other Matrix no other graph no other way just measure us Lord by your word hallelujah we're just going to ask
