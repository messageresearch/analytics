for inviting me once again a big risk on his part thank you brother paul and uh good to see brother david and all the saints karen rewind reminded me i think it was around 2019 the last time we came time goes quickly but we're thankful to to god that his time has gone quickly his word has been moving quickly in our hearts also and as the world becomes uh falling apart at the seams on a global scale then we realized just the hour we're living in that it's uh it's an 11th hour it's and it's just minutes till midnight it's just minutes it's just seconds perhaps until midnight and god has been preparing a bride that's why he sent us his word that's why his holy spirit came down that's why he's been filling our vessels with oil that's why he restored to us the truth of three precious steps of grace justification by faith sanctification by the spirit the baptism of the holy ghost why it's a friendship that's been restored with the father like adam had in the beginning and then he gave us refilling after refilling it's a it's a daily promise the refilling of his holy spirit and the only thing that hinders us from having a refilling every day is if we're not in tune to the spirit if if we don't wake up every morning in our hearts praying saying lord thy will be done and looking and to see and recognize that the things that we would suffer here for a purpose and the purpose is to bring us to the statue of a perfect man the man jesus christ it's a great plan it unfolds into adoption and it places us right back again where adam fell from so where adam fell from is where god in this last day has brought us to amen we're at that level by his amazing grace as we stand to our feet this evening we'd like to speak on a little subject and a title i'm sure you'll find very familiar and it's i'm entitling it what house will you build me and as a subject to get to this title the subject would be the foolish version friend or foe and it's it's been through the ages it's turned into a controversial doctrine of sorts when really the parable was had a different design different intent in the mind of god altogether let's read in romans chapter one if you'll turn with me romans 1 and verse 14. the apostle paul here speaking and he says this i am debtor both to the greeks and to the barbarians both to the wise and to the unwise so so as much as is in me as in me is i am ready to preach the gospel to you that i roam also it is with our heads heavenly father we thank you lord jesus and you the lamb of god are are the revealer of the word and lord what we might share here this evening and even our lack of ability perhaps to make it clear yeah you're not hindered lord for you can take the word direct to the hearts of your children and open the eyes of their understanding in just a moment for this we thank you that you're in control in jesus name amen you may be seated as we approach this subject here and in envisions and the prophetic word unfolding the a great plan of redemption then in these visions every symbol that is mentioned it's mentioned for uh divine purpose then there's also parables because the word of god is written in allegories and in metaphors and parables and convictions and symbols not just the last book of the bible but from genesis to revelation for god said it it pleased him he said father i thank you that you have hidden these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent would really reveal that unto babes such as would learn so in a parable there are things also that that mentioned that are only there to you might say feel or dramatize the story even to obscure the the moral or spiritual lesson and many details in a parable are placed to actually hide the meaning the meaning that can only be seen by a personal revelation for instance revelations 6 1 it reads and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see every one of those words is an english word every one of them you understood individually you could define that you okay a lamb i know what a lamb is open one of the seals all right i think i know what a seal is i heard it was the noise of a thunder i've heard thunder before and one of the four beasts saying come and see i know what beast are beast of the field and yet it's none of those things because when you read it by revelation you realize that this clam wasn't a natural lamb but it was jesus christ and when he says can he open one of the seals you realize that the opening of the seal represents a book that the seal is the the smallest part and the most insignificant part because the seal was a little spot of clay a little spot of wax and it held a scroll held it shut and yet god didn't speak to you and say watch the scroll he says he said and the lamb opened one of the seals though the holy spirit makes mention of the most insignificant thing as if to purposely try to take your eyes off what really mattered so that he could reveal it to you later so he could hide it from the eyes of the wise and prune it wasn't the seal but it was the opening of it because the opening of it held a scroll shut and when you open the scroll held the message a message that was directly intended for you and i yeah so we saw jesus christ when he opened up a book of redemption and then he says and i heard is that we're the noise of thunder and the prophet said we all know what a thunder is he says a thunder is the voice of god when a seal is open so now god is emphasizing for the second time it's open it's been loose because then i saw when jesus christ opened the book and i can i and i heard the voice of this opening and one of the four beasts the lion where he was the first because one prophecy has detailed the next yes so you can't to take just one you're lacking so much of what god's wanting to tell you but when you start bringing them together as the prophet says dovetailing them so revelations 4 spoke to us the lineup of the beast which was the first and which was the last the the lion the ox the man the eagle so realize here this is the opening of this first seal and this is the first beast so the lamb in this in this book of symbols in revelation 6 1 was jesus christ and the lion can and one of the four beasts was a lion and the lion was jesus christ so it wasn't talking about two different people it was talking about a ministerial change but the lamb was the one that would be opening this book because the lamb ministry was the oldest how could i say the most ancient of ministries revelations 13 and 8 said he was the lamb slain at the foundation of the world and when you go back to genesis to find where that took place the bible says that god made skins for adam and eve to dress them it never said he killed a natural lamb but yet it was a symbol that he had slew a lamb but the lamb that was slain was the lamb of god in the mind of god he slew it and those skins were representing what he was covering his children with he wasn't in the beginning covering with natural skins they were spoken word covering of what the blood of jesus christ would do for all of us for ages to come he did it once and for all in genesis and the same covering we have today this is god how he writes this book and as we get into the flow of visions and parables it's to also understand the style of the author of this book called the bible in matthew 13 and verse 34 matthew matthew the book of matthew and the gospels the book of john the book of luke mark these are eyewitnesses these are eyewitnesses accounts of what took place it's not a story they were witnesses and they're sharing with us what they saw what they heard and what they even felt with their hands and matthew 13 34 says all these things spake jesus unto the multitude and parables and without a parable spoken not unto them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying i will open my mouth in parables i will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world amen now we've established something the ministry and style of of jesus christ how he would speak he said all these beings spake jesus into the multitude in parables and without a parable spoke he not unto them so everything he would say so you got a bible with red letter when you read it a scripture first thing thought tell yourself this is a parable this is deeper than just the words that i can individually take and apply a dictionary to this is a parable he said the reason why that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying i'll open my mouth in parables i'll utter things which have been kept secret since the foundation of the world jesus was going to come and speak in parables things he was going to say that he had only said to adam that adam had been the only man that had ever heard these words now he was going to repeat him again through the second adam he was going to come and speak to us and bring us a plan of adoption bring us a plan to teach us how to handle the spoken word he was going to bring us a plan that was going to change us that was going to mold us mold our character mold the way we think mold the way we walk mold the way we talked that's right we were to be once again as the first adam was the sun going through a process of adoption we're to be that people we are standing today by the grace of god where adam stood the first adam by the revealed word god is molding us into his character what about as we speak on parables and the style of how jesus spoke to the people and without a parable he didn't speak but in parables he spoke to us things that had been hidden since the foundation of the world what about the great commission to the church parable or literal we just read what the style of his ministry would be and his ministry would be thus saith the lord always in parables matthew 28 18 scripture we all know very well it's jesus his death burial and resurrection he's about to ascend on high and he gives the church a great commission and it said and jesus came and spake unto him saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth he says go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost and we've defended our stand on baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ by saying folks don't you understand those are titles and they are but it's more than that it's a parable god spoke in a parable and he hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent but in acts 2 verse 36 to 38 is the revelation of the parable and adds more detail to the parable to the great commission to the church it becomes more clear another word we use for clarity is revelation acts 2 36 peter speaking he says therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus whom he have crucified both lord and christ so standing in the midst of whom peter was preaching to on the day of pentecost a large group maybe thousands had come around watching this phenomena this modern event take place where 120 had come out of an upper room speaking in tongues and the glory of god was on their faces and everything that they were speaking all were understanding and they were speaking of the great things of god of what was happening there so here peter's he says therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god had made that same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ the holy spirit descent discerned amongst the group of people that were standing there where those who had cried crucify him on that day they were right there then then peter says now when they heard this they were pricked in their hearts because they knew they were part of the group that were screaming crucify him that's why they were pricked in their hearts when they heard what peter said when they heard the holy spirit discern their hearts you were there you were the you shouted crucify him the bible says they were pricked in their hearts and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what do we do now now what do i do peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost the revelation of the parable adding more detail not only go eat count into the world and teach them to be baptized in the name of the father and the son of the host but tell them when they do it in that name add another detail tell them that it's going to give you a holy ghost baptism tell them it's going to give them a fire baptism tell them it's going to change the way you think and live you'll never be the same the parable revealed more than just those are titles it was a parable now you know why everyone won't catch it because it won't be revealed to all it because it'll take a revelation to unfold these parables to us it'll take the holy spirit it'll take you and i in a relationship with the father once again paul said i'm adapter both to the greeks and to the barbarians both to the wise and to the unwise so as much as in me i'm ready to preach the gospel to you at rome also and to the laity i asked with your present understanding this foolish virgin is she your friend or is she your fault now the parable of matthew 25. something is hidden within this parable to the words that are all english words all words you've heard all words to whom in your mind you you may already know the definition to them individually but when god puts them all together then the definition of these words cannot be found in a dictionary it's got to be revealed to you matthew 25 1 then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them no oil none but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and they slept let me start with a statement here now the 10 virgins are not the church of laodicea but they're believers even believers of all denominations and man-made systems that have heard the call come out of her my people this is the 11th hour we're living in this is minutes before the midnight hour a prophet came on the scene and he said remember world war one do you recall when it ended and how on the eleventh day on the eleventh hour a prophetic ministry declaring to us 1914 1919 the 11th hour had begun okay that means 60 minutes that means 60 prophetic minutes until a rapture 60 prophetic minutes till matthew 25 is history and no longer prophecy the 10 virgins these turn with me in revelations 3 and 20. it reads this behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come to him and will sup with him and he with me the ten virgins is the woman of revelations 12 and the remnant of the foolish woman's can the remnant of the woman seed both wise and foolish here in revelations 3 and 20 this is the 11th hour remember revelations 3 14-19 was the laodicean age the time of the seventh angel the time of a worldwide ministry but verse 20 is a voice change and paul spoke to us of it he spoke to us that there would be the shout the voice of the archangel and the trump of god and the voice change taking place in revelations 3 and 20 is the voice of the archangel it's the voice of the resurrection it's the voice of god between a prophet off the scene amen god is still on the scene so these ten virgins is the woman of revelations 12 and the remnant of a woman's seed and if you'll turn with me to revelations 12 and verse 12. it reads like this therefore rejoice see heavens and ye that dwell on them woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down come to you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time it's just seconds till midnight a great tribulation the clock is about to start ticking for three and a half years verse 13 says and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man-child the wise virgin and to the woman forgiven two wings of a great eagle this wise virgin that she might fly into the wilderness into a place where she is nourished for a time and times and a half time from the face of the serpent verse 14 a rapture has taken place a bride has been taken she's had a body change she's at the wedding supper of the lamb for three and a half years now while the world is in a great tribulation verse 15 and the serpent cast out his mouth water as a flood after the woman what came out of his mouth this flood was a flood of the seed of the serpent was the flood of the dictators and rulers of the nations but the bible says and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood of this anti-christ world of this immoral and filthy generation verse 16 says and the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood and in the 11th hour tsunami's earthquakes hurricanes pandemics and people on the face of the earth dying by the millions the earth was swallowing up the flood take the pressure off the bride of christ give her a chance to get her vessel full of oil verse 17 and the dragon was wrath with the woman the wise version comma and went to make war with the remnant of her seed what happened what happened in the comic is the is is the woman with whom the dragon was wrath that would bring forth the christ child she was raptured and the dragon was wrath with a woman you would think the next thing would be he would say and because he was roughed he's chasing it to the ends of the earth and the dragon was wrath with the woman karma the woman's god she's been quickened she's been changed from an earthly body to a to a celestial body and the dragon was wrath with the woman comet and she's gone he can't find her he don't know where she went so what does he do so he now goes and he goes to make war with the remnant of her seed the foolish which keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus christ this book the bible it it doesn't read like any other book you'll ever read it takes revelation it takes prayer it takes knock it shall be opened unto you seek you shall find ask he will give you the understanding he will give you the revelation matthew 25 and verse 5 it said while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept i just want to say it has nothing to do with someone coming tired to church and you're kind of dozing off a little bit no i'm not going there we're not an evangelist maybe if you're an evangelist you might but that's not what the bible's speaking of here brother brahman says in the message of the ten virgins paragraph 80. he says all the way down through he says both died he's referring to wise and foolish slumbered and slept as they went down through now they're not lost but they just slumbered and slept their way and see they don't say they was dead but they're slumbering and sleeping they're in another dimension they're beyond the curtain of time they're in a sixth dimension the wise and the foolish they're waiting in paradise the foolish that died through the ages because they didn't have the oil to take them to the sixth and in that fifth dimension we realized that it was in two parts one was paradise one was a prison house of hell one was torment the other was peace and they'll wait there for a white throne judgment both all died it says wise and foolish through seven church ages all the way from ephesians to laodicea in the ephesians church the spirit says i'll give you to eat of the tree of life both wise and foolish in the smyrna church ages be thou faithful unto death he that overcometh shall not be heard of the second death in pergamus the spirit says to the church i will give you to eat of the hidden manna and will give them a white stone can the stone a new name written which no man knoweth except he that receiveth it in ty tyra he says he says to the wise and the foolish hold fast till i come and i will give you the morning star through sardis he speaks i will not blot out your name the same shall be clothed in white raiment both wise and foolish in philadelphia he says i'll write upon you my new name the new name was the same name but up to philadelphia the name of jesus christ had been lost they had no book they had no bible they had the dogmas from the creeds of the roman catholic church they had what the priests would tell them they had father son and holy ghost no revelation they had the parable and no one understood it so no one had the revelation so no one could live out this part of the word but in philadelphia he says i will write upon you my new name it was the same name once again revealed to his children the name of the lord jesus christ in laodicea he said if any man hear my voice and open the door the door that was shut in eden i will come unto him the ladies in church age is the time of the 11th hour believers both wise and foolish in world war ii there was what was called the doomsday clock it was established by the scientific community it wasn't a literal clock it was symbolic they they felt the second world war had brought us to minutes before the midnight hour the total destruction of the whole world they had had one world war already within 17 years they had another world war world war one was the sounding of the fifth trumpet under the fifth seal it was the first woe world war ii was the sounding of the sixth trumpet under the sixth seal so from the early century 1900 1914 1999 the 11th hour had begun and within 17 years the fifth seal had opened was loosed and the six seal had opened and was loose they were no longer overlapping they were running in parable now because the lord said i will make a quick short work now the first four seals took two thousand years to unfold but the last three within less than 60 years god opened this up and they're racing in parable and the clock is ticking and it's moving quicker and it's moving faster and god's fulfilling his word matthew 25 number six it said and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him one cried of the lord himself with three manifestations each one designed to take us closer to take us higher to take us deeper to him that's the shout out the voice of the archangel and the trump of god now we see scriptures coming together this is a prophecy of the eleventh hour matthew 25 a prophecy of the eleventh hour the shout unfolding in a in the in a one-man ministry of elijah and when the elijah ministry is gone when the one-man ministry has ended what follows the ministry of a many-membered body what was the pattern jesus appears to them after his death burial and resurrection for a period of 40 days at the end of 40 days he goes and talks to the disciples he tells them go ye terry in jerusalem he says and within 10 days from today you'll be endued with power from an eye you say brother daniel didn't say to you 10 days no i said it because it was 10 days because it was 50 days jubilee time the day of pentecost jubilee time and what was born was a church a new testament church and what ended with a one-man ministry now it exploded with the ministry of the body of jesus christ a many-membered body with a fightful ministry so that was the pattern then at the first coming it must be the pattern again for these hebrews 13 and 8 is the same yesterday today and forever he's unchanging in all his ways paul opening the mystery adding details to the ending of the eleventh hour and the chiming in of a midnight crime but not revealing it as of yet for when paul spoke in first thessalonians 4 16 it also was a parable because his ministers his prophets spoke as the lord himself and they spoke in parables oftentimes when they spoke it not understanding it themselves but they were men who had learned to be obedient william branham by the things he suffered he learned obedience very quickly first thessalonians 4 16 the apostle paul said for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first part of the eleventh hour the shout is history no longer prophecy the voice of the archangel is happening while we speak and we are waiting for the trump of god when a wise virgin with her vessel full of oil that keeps her lampa burning will be quick and changed and translated by the power of the holy spirit matthew chapter verse 1 6 1-16 is also an 11th hour parable of the seven churches from ephesus to laodicea it's the calling and choosing of the mystical body of jesus christ and the reward is the same through all seven measures of this body of christ eternal life that's the point of this parable throughout seven church ages all will receive the same reward eternal life amen in verse 10 of matthew 20 it said but when the first came they supposed that they should have received more and they likewise received every man a penny and when they had received it they murmured against the good man of the house saying these last have rot but one hour and thou has made them equal unto us which have borne the burden and heat of the day what was god telling us the laodicean church will be the shortest of all of us it will be the shortest of all then he says but he answered on one of them and said friend i do thee no wrong can direct not thou agree with me for a penny take that take take that thine is and go thy way and i will give unto this last even as unto thee it is not lawful for me to do what i will with my own is thy nine evil because i am good so the last shall be first and the first last for many are called but few are chosen an eleventh hour parable and the gift of god to the mystical body of which we are a part of that body we're not the whole body but we are just one part one of seven throughout seven church ages that's why they without us could not be made perfect they didn't lack the open book they didn't lack the the the revelation of the seven seals as i like to say and if i don't have time to explain it i'll lay that load on brother paul to do it but the first time the book was opened wasn't 1963 and the first time the book was open was it william branham the first time the book was opened it was opened by jesus christ and the first one to loose the seals and open them was jesus christ let me just drop something in so you can study it the sixth seal brother branham says we're going to do something different tonight he says i want you to open your bible like this and he takes his bible to keep it open to matthew 24 and revelation 6 and i'm gonna show you how jesus preached those seven seals in a parable that's right because what was the style of preaching to be in a parable and without a parable he would not speak but when he would speak in these parables be sure that what he's telling you are things that have been hidden since the foundation of the world be sure that what he's saying in this parables are things that only adam has ever heard but now he's sharing it with you his beloved his wife his bride his children his family matthew 25 and verse 7 then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves verse 8 said the foolish said to the wise give us of your oil our lamps are gone out they were made of two parts one part of these lamps was the vessel that like this bottles holding the water so the vessels held the oil then the lamp sat on top the term the lamp represented the wick so the foolish version wasn't saying it was not insinuating that they had oil it's to some measure remember to begin the parable they had no oil their vessels were empty the lamp was the wick they're saying here give us of your oil because we can't keep our our wicks lit because there's no oil in the vessel but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves the baptism of the holy ghost is available in abundance but no man can give it to you william branham couldn't give it paul couldn't give it i can't give it no minister no prophet no priest no king no evangelist can give you the holy ghost but you can go straight to the father and he can give it and he can give your cup to overflowing remember in revelations chapter 5 and verse 5 and verse 4 it says john was weeping and one of the elders tell them john don't weep behold the lion of the tribe of judah was able to open the book and lose the seven seals around that was jesus christ at his first coming because remember a prophet said this open book this revealed word was first given to israel what israel rejected at the cross of calvary was now given to a gentile people remember the old testament allegory joseph come with his two sons he put his eldest son at the right hand of jacob who was blind and his last days were upon him he put this younger son at the left because jacob couldn't recognize him who was who so joseph put him according to custom and ritual and as jacob is going to give the lion's share to the firstborn the older son and just a little blessing to the younger he crosses his hands and he gives the lion's share to the younger amen representing that at the cross of calvary the inheritance of the father that was for israel when they would reject it would all go to the younger son watch how god writes his word you have been told many times that a woman in the bible represents the church and then god turns around and takes two boys are younger and older and they represent the church god loves to hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed unto babes such as would learn about the time if you think you've got him figured out you realize you still need revelation if we've been able to go deeper in the word it's because he's took us deeper not because we've been able to go there it's because he took us by the hand and walked us in deeper and deeper and deeper matthew 25 8 and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out now you realize they had no oil that's what the scripture said and the lamps coined out the lamp was the wick not the vessel the vessel was empty and the wick wouldn't stay lit because it had no oil to draw from for the fire to keep burning but the wise answer said not so lester be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bride bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut because when they went to buy they wouldn't find anyone to buy it from right right because the ministry that remained remained because they didn't have the oil either afterward came also the other virgin saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not i don't know you at this hour for a rapture for a body change to be too quick in you but i'll know you had a white throne judgment that's right so someone might say it says he knew them not that means they're lost no no no no slow down in order to this word to be revealed to our hearts before we jump to another thought we must connect it with another scripture another scripture and each scripture keeps adding more detail and the great plan of redemption starts opening up and we start realizing the price he paid for my salvation and your salvation we start realizing the detail he's put in to saving you to healing you to baptizing you but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not verse 13 watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh this time of wise and foolish virgins in matthew 25 it's also the time of the coming of the son of man jesus christ his second coming at this time where was the son of man ministry in the voice of many waters go to them that sell and buy the six full ministry of jesus christ because i include the head of every home and many helps in the church and i clued the head of every home because the head of every home has a great responsibility because you're the pastor of your house amen in the first exodus moses told them what to do but unless the head of the home applied the blood on the door death would walk through that house death would take the firstborn jew gentile and egyptian unless the blood was on the doorposts death would come through amen and though we preach the gospel from a nice pulpit nice chairs and pews then it lays upon the head of every home to apply the word in its own to put your own house in order amen by the leading of the holy ghost amen by baptism after baptism and feeling after failing god will make you a wise steward amen in your home amen if you can believe if we can humble ourselves how shall we buy isaiah 55 and 1 says this oh everyone that thirsts coming to the waters and the and he that hath no money come ye by and eat they come by wine and milk without money without price how do you buy without money and without price it has to be something already paid for and then what you have in your what you bring to buy is no longer the purchase price that has been paid but what you bring in your hand to show is a token of the purchase price and everything you ask in his name if you can believe god will give it to you that's right wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread your labor for what for that which satisfyeth not arch diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness incline your ear and come unto me here and your soul shall live and i will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of david another parable that'll add details to this eleventh hour and the midnight cry and the rapturing time all the same time luke 17 and verse 34 it's speaking of the same modern event that was to take place of a rapture of people being changed of a wise virgin luke 17 34 reads like this i tell you in that night which night the night of matthew 25 can i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed well that's kind of strange does it rub you the wrong way maybe in this day we live but listen this is a parable i tell you from that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other left two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left and the answered and said unto him where lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is there will the eagles be gathered the fourth living creature in the time of the ride of the pale horse rider at a laodicean church time at the 11th hour time eagle time did you notice how the holy spirit weaves in a detail here to confirm what he's already told us in matthew 25 in all three examples if you've noticed i know you did they're the same gender two men in the bed two women grinding two men in the field they're the same gender they are the same in what sense are they the same it's a parable two men in the bed they're the same it means they were both believers two women grinding at the mill same gender it means they were both believers two men in the field working in the field same gender they're the same what does it mean they were both believers all ten of them they were virgin they were all believers so one parable confirms and adds more detail to the next parable the wise and the foolish they're all genuine believers so where do you find genuine believers today in christ in the end time message in the word of the hour in this eagle age reading the books of a prophet loving their bibles and reading them every day they're believers why isn't foolish amen the foolish virgin you know you couldn't put a finger on their lives is what a prophet said in the ma in in the message the sudden secret going away brother brahma says in paragraph 35 how many of you all perhaps have read of the virgins some were wise some were foolish convergent means purity they were all good people every one of them virgins sanctified vessels of god but those who had oil in their lamps went in and the others was left out they were all virgins to everyone people that you couldn't put your finger on anything wrong wise and foolish so then we begin to understand that the word foolish in this parable that the definition cannot be found in a dictionary because the definition of there's a thousand different things to be foolish and yet none of them apply to the word foolish in matthew 25. for the definition of foolish in matthew 25 wasn't that they didn't have a good job wasn't that they didn't get a good education it wasn't that they failed to get a bachelor's or master's degree it wasn't that they didn't have a good home it wasn't that there were great uh daytime traders on the internet none of that one significance to foolish conscription this parable they failed to get the oil in their vessels webster would have never told you that the collegiate dictionary never said that the theologians never said that the pope of rome didn't confirm it but the bible is its own interpreter they were foolish for one reason alone when the midnight cry came when the midnight struck when people were being quick and changed and translated they realized they didn't have the oil they didn't have the goods that their relationship with the father hadn't gone to that level that's right it was a relationship problem and somehow you made other relationships in your life more important that's exactly right amen that's right he who loves father or mother more than i remember it's rapturing time you say you mean i've got to love him more than my mother you love him first and you'll love your mother like you've never loved it before you love him first and you'll love and treat your wife like a queen like you've never treated her before you ain't treating her like a queen you ain't loving him like you should know the foolish virgin they are sheep they are saved in the message the patmos vision paragraph 3 but the man says now there's another question here that was given to me last evening brother branham are the foolish virgins of matthew 25 counted as the gentile remnant i understand that the five foolish versions were saved but have to go to the great tribulation period is this correct we read revelations 12. and the great dragon came out after the woman comma and went after the remnant of her seed because she is gone she was gone in a moment in the twinkling of an eye in a supernatural nanosecond she was gone he says what do i do now uh the remnant i guess i'll chase her down now i can't find the bride i can't find that mystical body i can't find those who are full of the oil they've been quickened they've been changed the terrestrial has dropped the celestial has come in there had they had a meeting in the air happened so quick that even lucifer didn't catch it with his sharp twisted eyes amen brother branham says i understand that the foolish virgins were saved but have to go to the great tribulation period is this correct if so what will be their final destination could they be the sheep which were divided from the goats in matthew 25 and verse 2. brother and says pretty good theologian to what i think too that they are the remnant the sleeping virgin or the foolish virgin is the remnant spoke of in revelation it was the 12th chapter he was talking about of the woman seed that keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus christ he goes on to say a woman will take a piece of goods lay it down now that is what she's cutting her she takes her pattern lays it any way she desires the way she's going to cut it and what's left over is called the remnant but she chooses to cut it from a certain place of her own free thinking but what's left over is called the remnant amen but it's the same cloth it's the same material they're both believers in the parable of luke 17 there was two men in a bed there was two women grinding at the mill and there was two men in the field a parable what was the parable telling us the same thing that matthew 25 was telling us of the ten versions they're the same same gender they're all believers wise and foolish so when he comes down and he descends to take a bribe he's only going to come searching amongst the believers that's it but amongst the believers he's only going to take those whose vessels are full of oil that's exactly right amen amen how important amen for the believer is the baptism of the holy ghost and refilling after refilling that's a daily promise prophet said one baptism amen many feelings because the baptism of the holy ghost is a friendship restored with the father like adam had eaten we were told it was speaking in tongues for the david if you didn't speak in tongues you didn't have nothing but if you spoke in tongues you had it all you could throw it into neutral and coast for the rest of your religious life and i had a good friend and this good friend was baptized as a young man in the apostolic church just a young man maybe early twenties then and when they baptized them in the water he came out of the water speaking in tongues by the day while the pentecostal people and obstacle people this was a picture-perfect scene of their creed and doctor they start grooming him why he'll be the next president of the assembly but within five years this young man got long hair a beard a 45 on his hip and driving a harley davidson in los angeles what happened the baptism of the holy ghost you can drive a stake down when you get it and that'll hold you in the toughest of storms that'll hold you through the most abusive relationships that's exactly right that'll keep you when cancer strikes and it goes from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet the baptism of the holy ghost it's a thai post it's a promise it's the power of god unto redemption it's a life-changing experience and that's what elijah come to do that's what the first elijah came to do so we watched the pattern of his word isaiah 40. isaiah anointed of god begins to prophesy of this forerunner that's to come and he begins to tell us the style of his ministry he says he says he'll he'll make awake in the wilderness a path the valley's when he comes he will fill him the mountains he'll leave them as planes every crooked road he'll straighten it out that's right and the rough places he'll make smooth there's five things so the young man i rushed to the new testament i read the life of john the baptist and i say i don't see any straight roads i don't see no valleys got filled mountains are still all around jerusalem not one of them gets chopped down there's rough places all over the place that's what's happening i don't see it and yet a prophet said it it's thus saith the lord what was it it was god through the prophet speaking in a parable every road make it straight that's a big change take a valley and fill it okay some of you are familiar with maracoopa valley in phoenix fill that valley what would it take and how long why where we have our little church in glendale we'd have a thousand feet of dirt above us that's a big change make everything that's rough smooth that's a big change so then i realized the holy spirit speaks to my heart it's john didn't straighten no roads john didn't feel no valleys john didn't chop new mountains i said lord what did he do this is what he did this is what he did he filled valleys he chopped mountains and made everything straight that's right then i realized the connecting link in all of them everyone was an impossible change for men to do but with god all things are possible so what was the ministry of the first forerunner elijah what was he going to bring to israel change change change change change change he was bringing going to change the way they live he was going to change the way they parent he's going to change marriage and divorce he was going to change everything for israel change was coming to israel when this forerunner came to change because he was going to introduce the king of kings he was going to he was going to introduce the changer that was the first elijah and when the second elijah come how many can look back and say that man brought change it's the pattern of his word it's the pattern of his word there are three kinds of believers but but but dave squirming knows the word he's going all right here comes the butt but in this saved church brother adam says there's two classes of people he said in the message the ten virgins in paragraph 33 he says now this remnant was a sleeping virgin that he spurted the water from his mouth to make war with the remnant of the woman's seed now what is a remnant now there you have to get these types together now there's a church which is church natural maybe i can draw it here and make it a little bit plainer he says now brother neville if i take up some of your time you just forgive me he said now now remember that there is what the unbeliever he's drawing on the board he said i'm going to put he draws three circles i'm going to put ub on this one unbelievable that's the sinner okay and then there's another one which is the formal i'll put f o he's writing it on a board jeffersonville indiana ub fo draws a third circle he says can then here it is the other one which is the saved church i'll put s a the saved church now keep them in mind all the time and then people think okay believer unbeliever make believer where in the world does the foolish virgin fit in okay so now in the saved church there are two classes in this church right here he says which was typed by christ one of them was a sleeping virgin the other one had oil in the lamp how many remembers the story so wise and foolish once again who are they believers believers of what one's a baptist one's a pentecostal no no no these were believers in the coming of the lord yeah okay these were believers end-time believers end-time message believers end-time bible believers the foolish virgin brother brahman says well in a short brief statement the foolish words is a good woman he says in the seventh seal he said now what happened they were purged during the time of the awful tribulation period if god's going to purge that virgin that was a good woman but she failed to get oil in her lamp okay who was he speaking of the foolish one he said that was a good woman but she failed to get oil in her lamp and she's going and he's going to perjure through persecution in there he puts them tribes there in there for the same thing purges them during the time of tribulation period because it's a purging it's a judgment she stays behind for a great tribulation and when the great dragon come after the woman the wise virgin comma and he goes and chases the remnant of the woman's seed what's the comma rapturing time what's the comma the midnight hour what's the common quick and changed and translated amen what's the comma we went to meet him in the air and the devil is going they were just here second ago that's why i came to idaho i know they're here where'd they go ah i know there's a few left over believers the foolish they didn't have the oils but they're believers of this end time promise and the same time message where are they in the message the foolish virgin exactly the foolish virgin does not take the mark of the beast neither does he suffer torment in hell the fifth dimension is a prison house for those who've rejected christ but instead she's on the paradise side of this fifth dimension awaiting a white throne judgment where she's a virgin where she's an eagle where he is where she is the sheep of matthew 25 and 31. in matthew 25 and 31 this is what a prophet referred to as the white throne judgment the second resurrection where all that have ever died on the face of the earth will rise in a resurrection to stand judgment okay verse 31 of matthew 25 said when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory it's judgment time it's a tribunal he's judging the whole world it's not the first time he did this the first white throne judgment was back in haiti he judged the whole world then too well it was just three people but it was everybody it was everybody it'll be everybody again a final judgment verse 32 said and behold and before him shall be gathered all the nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand he begins judgment with the sheep because judgment always begins in the house of god that's why god has established a pastor for you here a man that will preach to you a word that will purge your hearts souls and minds a command that will preach to your word that shows you the way to receive the baptism of the holy ghost of how to return back with into a friendship with the father that he might feel you every single day with a refilling of his spirit matthew 25 and verse 34 then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world who is he speaking to a prophet said this was the foolish virgin he said for he says for i was a hunger and you gave me meat i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you took me in god an eyewitness of how the foolish virgin was living is now giving testimony at the highest court in the universe and he's saying naked and you clothed me i was sick and you visited me i was in prison and you came unto me this is not the wise the wise is standing at his side the groom and the bride the king and the queen amen this is the foolish that's right then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we thee unhungered and fed or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked in clothing or when saw with these sick or in prison and came unto thee this is a humble group this is a god-fearing group none of them jumped up and said yeah that's right that's that's me no no no no and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you in so much as you've done done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me so this foolish virgin who is she virgin or virgin believer or unbeliever believer eagle or quote eagle sheep or goat sheep remnant of the woman's seed or serpent seed remnant of the woman's seed this foolish version who is she your friend or your fault let me assure you she is your friend let me read you once again her deeds and this isn't men telling you this isn't a pastor saying how good you are this isn't a prophet discerning saying wow you're quite the guy no this is god this is king of kings this is lord of lords this he this is he who looks from on high and sees not only what you do but sees the intent of the heart of why you did that's exactly it right yes sir okay let me read you once again her deeds for though she misses rapturing faith and a supernatural body change at the white throne judgment the sheep of god are exonerated of all sin for their godly deeds and lifestyle that's exactly right verse 31 when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all the nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divided his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed and my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world wasn't a sudden decision he knew it all the time who were his and he said all that the father has given me wise or foolish i'll not lose a one. amen paul said i am adapter both to the wise and the unwise why because they're my brothers they're my sisters matthew 35 25 35 for i wasn't hungered and he gave me meat i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me i was sick and you visited me i was in prison you came unto me then shall the righteous answer i'm saying lord when saw we thee and hungered and fed your thirsty and gave thee drink when saw with thee a stranger and took the inner naked in clothing when saw thee saw these sick or imprisoned and came unto thee and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you insomuch as you've done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me amen preachers and those who think they are have used this parable to try to discern who is foolish and who is wise let me tell you you've wasted your time and completely missed the reason for the parables once more as a reminder to ministers of the gospel i am adapter both to the greeks and to the barbarians both to the wise and to the unwise paul said i will reach down my hand to anyone who'll put their hand in mind so and i will lift them up so as much as in me is i'm ready to preach the gospel to you that at rome also this parable as many and all is to provoke a very personal question that you must ask yourself this evening or allow me or yet better the apostle paul my brother in christ acts 19 and 1 reads like this and it came to pass that while apollos was at corinth paul having passed through the upper coast came to ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the holy ghost since you believed they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether can there be a holy ghost our pastor never preaches about it the message church we're in they don't ever remind us of that we need it and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized they said unto john's baptism paul goes then said paul john barely baptized with the baptism of repentance he was very careful how he talked about john saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after this elijah whether it be the first one or the second one they should believe on him that comes after elijah that is on christ jesus they should believe on the lord jesus christ when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus because they were believers have you not been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ i want to believe because you're here tonight that you're a believer and you just need someone like me to remind you repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and even if you were one that one day screamed crucify him i still extend to your invitation repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall receive this gift of this holy ghost promise amen that'll change you it'll bring change change change change change you'll never be the same it'll bring joy peace and the love of god in our hearts and when paul had laid his hands upon him the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied and all the men were about 12. it was a great revival it was a great holy ghost meeting they arrived with doubts they arrived with a lack of revelation and they left with their doubts resolved they left with revelation in their hearts they left with the baptism of the holy ghost they've been changed one change of many changes that's what adoption is all about change god changing you that's right daily every day is changing us there shouldn't pass a day that we haven't experienced something amen where god has changed us the daily changes can be very difficult but if you can stand the chastisement and the teaching of the holy spirit to change you now the easiest change will be the last a body change in a moment in the twinkling of an eye you won't even know what's happened till you're in another dimension the last one is the easiest the hardest one is even one tonight well repeat again repent and be baptized yes sir in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit it's a promise amen but what if i was that day before pilate's court and what if i was screaming crucify him peter knew they were he saw him in the in the multitude of people he recognized him the holy spirit discerned their hearts one two three wow at least 500 of you were there screaming crucify him and they were pricked in their hearts because they knew they had screamed crucify him they knew they had walked away from him on that day and the one that was pricked the deepest come forward and said i did scream crucify what do i do now peter said this is what you do repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall receive amen the gift of the holy spirit amen amen maybe you're thinking i i just can't do it oh you can't wait another second to not do it while the spirit's calling amen amen acts 2 36 therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus whom you have crucified both lord and christ now when they heard this because they were the ones screaming crucify him at pilate's court they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles do you know what we've done i'm just now just now dawning on me what we've done peter says yeah i know what you did okay i did it too just what do we do now he said repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall receive this holy ghost promise it'll take you into a relationship with the father okay it'll take you to the capstone of your promised perfection can you say is perfection attainable it is because perfection of the bible the definition for that word isn't found in a dictionary either it's it's not there turn with me real quick and i read it to the young people yesterday to matthew 5 48. it's the last verse there's 48 verses in this chapter it's the very last one be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect as i shared with the young people last night and that matthew 5 6 and 7 is jesus speaking on perfection giving us the steps to get to the capstone of our life he said be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect you know why he said why he put the biggie therefore because of the 47 verses prior he said did you catch it i just preached 47 verses on perfection for you on adoption on justification by faith and can and sanctification by the spirit and the baptism holy ghost bringing you to prefection like the father himself eternal in the heavens above amen so if you want to know how to get there follow the steps go back to verse 1 and verse 2 and 3 and 4 and 20 and 30 and 47 then you'll know that he spoke it in a parable amen and a simple thought and a simple conclusion to what he was saying be therefore perfect because of the 47 verses because what i do because of what i just finished ministering to you he says it will bring you to perfection but i wasn't listening and peter said just go back and read it again read it until you see christ in every verse so the purpose of this parable is have i received the holy ghost since i believed and how long has it been since i received the refilling of that blessed holy it spirit everyone i could ask have you received the holy ghost and to believe got it brother daniel no worries there i'm good then i say that's wonderful when's the last time that you can put your finger on the day and the time and say you had a refilling of the spirit amen first corinthians 1 and verse 23 but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumbling block unto the greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men romans 1 3 concerning his son jesus christ our lord which was made of the seed of david according to the flesh and declared to be the son of claude with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead justification by faith sanctification by the spirit the baptism of the holy ghost a friendship restored with the father as adam had needed what is that baptism of the holy ghost the father standing at the throne of your heart as a watchman guarding the city you then come to the greatest battles ever fought but you're not alone now you've got a friend in jesus and he has become the author and finisher of your faith and every victory he gives you that's a revealing yes every trial you go through and you rise above it that's a refilling how many would like more than one in a day or is one good enough the watchman guide in your steps into perfection a son and daughter being adopted by the father peter adds more details to this born-again experience unto perfection he adds more details to what jesus preached on perfection in matthew 5 6 and 7. even even david in the psalm speaks of it psalms 23 he says the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he's talking about a walk but not walking alone he maketh me to lie down in green pastures justified by faith he liveth me besides the still waters sanctified by the spirit he restoreth my soul born again he leads me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake adoption has begun amen yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i'll feel i will fear no evil our greatest battles ever fought amen for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me you've now got a friend in jesus name thou prepares a table before me in the presence of mine enemies the end time message once again in parables thou anoint is my head with oil my cup runneth over the parables revealed to our hearts bringing refilling after refilling of this holy spirit verse 6 surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life tonight will dwell in the house of the lord forever psalms 23 our christian walk amen from being poor in spirit to the capsule of perfection amen in six verses no doubt if i could do that we'd have been done an hour ago but i can i'm not him but he's here this is the house god wants you to build but what house will you build him what house will i build them i say together let's build him a house that he'll be pleased to dwell many years ago the lord gave me a poem i'd like to share it with you at this time in closing the song leader would like to prepare musicians it was about six or seven years ago you know as a minister you're sitting you're studying you're looking you're searching and i just wasn't going anywhere seemed like i hit a brick wall i'd stop drink some water go outside come back i sit down i pick up my pen and just something struck me and i begin writing and this is what he gave me i hope it blesses your heart sunrise to sunset i will seek your face knowing the victory that awaits me when i make you first place fasting and prayer is well wait for you in my prayer closet where your promises come true it's not a busy place where the multitudes abide it's the secret of your pavilion where bride and groom reside i know it's the best way and yet i try at last only to be defeated by satan's ugly blast i dedicate myself again to the prayer closet with my friend who listens so attently to every word i say but when i listen quietly to every word he speaks he gives me all the strength i need to hear him say you're free amen free from the sickness free from the pain free from the lust free from the shame freedom freedom freedom free at last in my little prayer closet when i close the door at last as we stand to our people amen heavenly father we thank you for this grand opportunity to be here with a portion of the bride of jesus christ believers lord [Music] at many different stages in their walk but nonetheless we claim everyone is a believer [Music] even those who might be feeling at this moment but brother daniel you don't understand i'm like one of them that said crucify him but i say just repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive freedom freedom freedom free from the sickness free from the lust free from the pain free from the shame freedom is what the lord jesus offers you tonight so i say now in jesus name to all who are here be thou free in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the baptism of the holy spirit and you shall be refilled lord for this we thank you give you all the honor all the glory and the praise bless your people for their attentiveness bless them lord all that have come and may you grant the miracle in their lives this day of healing virtue maybe it's healing of the mind of the spirit to the soul of the heart of the body [Music] the lord you said you would you said by your stripes we are healed of every affliction mental spiritual in the physical body and lord we're believers we believe we believed just one request help thou our unbelief in jesus name amen god bless you all tonight the lord be with you god grant it we'll be back again tomorrow to share a few more things of this great plan of redemption of these divinely revealed mystery truths it's for you it's for your children it's for the grandkids it's for every one of you god bless [Music] you know as brother daniel was preaching i just had a thought and i thought well i'll just put it to the side but just felt once again just to to speak of this some time ago i was in a situation where a minister sat me down and he said you know paul i just want to explain to you why our church preaches what it preaches and and why we are we're doing it in the fashion that we do and saints it broke my heart because he then proceeded to explain to me why they have softened the message trying to reach out to the foolish virgin we just heard it tonight saints i'm here to tell you tonight we're we're preaching this gospel and yes the foolish virgin might hear it but we're not preaching this for the foolish virgin we're preaching this for the wise virgin we're preaching it for the one who wants to be in the comma and satan would have to then search and try and find you but can't find you we're not we're not going to water this down to make you feel comfortable so that you can extend your time on earth i want out of here i want out of here and i want the word to change me because you see if there's no oil there's no fire and if there's no fire we're lukewarm lord fill us fill us lord don't don't let us just come along and say we have such a comfortable life we have such a comfortable church experience but fill us lord that the wick can remain lit can we say tonight god's lit our wick amen he lit it and if god put out the effort to light the wick for you and i he intends for you and i to keep it lit in other words we're actually rejecting a little bit of what god has for us when we run out of oil we're actually saying you know what lord you didn't understand my circumstance you didn't understand my need but he does he does because that lamb that lamb said i'm going to give you the example of what i i want you to see and i'm going to give myself before you ever come into a physical manifestation i'm going to give myself for you and on calvary he said it is finished this work is finished saints can we say amen thank you lord so that this work is finished amen i'd like to sing that song sister ruth i don't know if i have it muddled up in my mind but cleanse me o lord and i will be cleansed heal me o lord i'll be healed amen do we have that song can joshua i might i might have that somebody help me [Music] could he heal me oh lord and i will be here [Music] and i will be here is [Music] heal me oh lord oh lord heal our spirit [Music] and tonight will be saved o heal me o my lord and i will be here the one i praise you are the one i praise amen let's just go there let this be our prayer tonight oh fill me [Music] and i will be saved fill my vessel lord fill me all my lord and i will be filled you are the one i praise oh you are the one i praise listen that song with a friend we have in jesus amen we've just heard tonight of our friend amen he's been with us he's leading he's guiding he has come and said i have walked this path already and i've already don't you love that were the hills the mountains the valleys filled no yes amen in that beautiful you see he didn't change the geography the topography he changed us and made us to be able to walk through every valley and worship on every mountaintop because he was there let's sing this together what a friend we have in jesus [Music] foreign is [Music] foreign [Music] yes is is oh oh [Music] [Applause] is [Music] is i don't know if this would make sense to you but his brother daniel was preaching i'm just thinking about that song i got trials i've got temptations i've got struggles i've got things i have carried so long that they become common and we no longer even pray about deliverance from them or a change coming in our life because we just think this is the status quo but when we start to take it in prayer you realize that actually is more of a revelation than we realize i've got a burden what's my answer prayer i've got a circumstance what's my answer prayer i don't know what's wrong with my family prayer whatever it is prayer amen but sometimes even then our prayers don't seem to do it so then i hope you don't mind and can follow me then god steps in and says this is my son this is my daughter i called them i've made the way for them i paid the price and so i'll just have to send down the holy ghost and fire and i'll keep them alive i'll keep reviving them with the holy ghost and with fire amen and as we was brother daniel was preaching i got a whole sermon i could preach to you tonight here but as he was preaching i thought that's right and when we get down to an ebb where we can't seem to make it ourself god sends down another blast as it were of the holy ghost and revives us again thank you lord amen i want to sing that tonight i hope you don't think we're shifting gears too fast or too far but we just realized it's the holy ghost god coming down only reason i'm here tonight holy ghost only reason i have victory in my life the holy ghost amen only reason i have a testimony tonight is the holy ghost amen otherwise they'd say who are you and what are you and i'd say i'm just a sinner amen i have no hope but amen i'm a sinner saved by grace and filled with the holy ghost well it's that holy ghost [Music] oh [Music] bubbling up inside well it's all over me and it's bubbling up inside oh jesus is keeping me alive well it's sanctifies me holy and it's keeping me alive oh keeping me alive well keeping me alive sanctifies me holy and it's keeping me alive my jesus is keeping me alive oh i prayed it down from heaven and it's keeping me alive or keeping me alive yes he's keeping me alive i prayed it down from heaven and it's keeping me alive oh jesus is keeping me alive well he's all over me and it's bubbling up inside he's all inside all bubbling up inside well it's all over me and it bubbling up inside my jesus is keeping me alive well it sanctified me holy and it's keeping me alive or keeping me alive oh he's keeping me alive it sanctifies me holy and it's keeping me alive my jesus is keeping me alive well i prayed it down from heaven and it's keeping me alive all keeping me alive it's keeping me alive well i prayed it down from heaven and it's keeping me alive oh jesus is keeping me alive can we just praise the lord tonight [Music] [Applause] now i might have a little issue with that song actually if y'all don't mind because you see i didn't have to pray it down from heaven he's in me amen we're not trying to draw something he came to us amen and he's in us and he's walking with us amen so i guess i have a little issue brother daniel with that because i don't know in my weakest hour when i probably couldn't have prayed anything anywhere he came amen aren't you glad tonight now you know what just one last song amen brother daniel touched on it didn't really elaborate it what was this producing an old testament church was it producing someone still bound no sir this word loosed a new testament church brother daniel put it this way he says he's taking us back to where the first adam was is where we've been restored back to hallelujah not a new church it's not as the prophet puts it it's not a new book of acts it is a continuation i say thank you lord that i could be a continuation amen you know you look at this my brother and sister i love this because this quote that i just read i think it was yesterday brother branham says it was the traditions of men that kept the word from delivering the people it wasn't the failure of the word it was the tradition of man we bound the word to make it fit us but the word is making us fit christ aren't you glad well as i look out across the land see god's mighty hand the bride of christ aborned in a wedding gown just like [Applause] all right [Music] i [Applause] demon spirits were cast out in the jail they sang and shout while surrounded by a holy angel band i'm rising up horizontal there's a new testament church rising up oh rising up rising up there's a new testament church rising up well if you think it's all long gone and the miracles are done i have some good news bring to you in the last days he'll pour of his spirit more and more like a mighty eagle your strength he'll renew [Music] i'm rising up horizontal where new testament church rising up we're new testament church rising up now make it personal i'm rising up [Music] i'm rising up i'm the new testament church rising up i'm rising up i'm rising up i'm the new testament church rossignol and as i look out across the land i see god's mighty hand the bride of christ that's you wedding ground just like in the days of old they stood in a courage they turned their whole world upside down i'm rising up i'm rising all i'm the new testament church rising up i'm rising up i'm rising up i'm the new testament church rising up [Music] we're eagles we weren't made to hop around on the ground amen we don't dig our word our food out of the soil of laodicea it's a heavenly manna a fresh manna hallelujah i'd like to just keep going on and on and on but you know what i want you to come tomorrow morning i want you to just go tonight church i i hope you don't get offended tonight but we were just a little subdued tonight i don't know if saturday was too big a day for us or maybe the devil just knew we'd hear what we heard tonight but i'm just going to ask you not in the flesh but go home and pray come in the morning prophet of god spoke to me this morning does the prophet ever speak to you yeah prophet of god spoke to me this morning he said we have fresh manna we don't have old man or we have fresh manna and we are eagles right amen is there any eagles in the house tonight amen so we're here to free feed on fresh manna so i'm just asking is your friend your brother just make sure when you come in the morning all of the little distractions have been set aside we've already entered into the spirit well when i get in service i'll get in the spirit no get in the spirit and then come to church amen and the lord will speak he spoke tonight amen so i believe the lord will lead our brother daniel to build upon this amen we'll have something even more beautiful because i declared this beautiful now brother daniel and i have been visiting a little bit as old friends do i have heard this sermon the second time tonight because in our fellowship a little piece here and oh did i mention brother paul a little thought here and i'm telling you just like lasagna is better the second time around amen the preaching of the word is also great so let's come because tomorrow we're going to hear whatever god's laid on brother daniel's heart will be actually a continuation of this right here amen for us to recognize where we stand in the plan of god to recognize god didn't bring us to a spot and just pause and go off to a different idea he's been as the song says leading his dear children along so let's just all press into the mark of the high calling god bless you we love you a lot amen god bless you you're dismissed [Music] [Music] so [Music] jesus [Music] sometimes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] my sisters [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] lord jesus [Music] the lord [Music] is [Music] lord we ask for healing [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] and let the wick return [Music] [Music] for salvation [Music] holy spirit [Music] from jesus [Music]
