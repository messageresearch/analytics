As the deer [Music] As the deer panteth for, the water so my soul longeth after thee. You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee. You alone are my strength, my shield. To you alone does my spirit yield. [Music] You alone are my heart desire and I long to worship thee. [Music] You're my friend and you are my brother.

Go up to the key of D. [Music] in my life. Lord be glorified. Be glorified in my life. Lord be glorified today in your church. Lord be glorriied. He glorified in your church.

[Music] Lord be glorified today in your church. in your church. Lord be glorified. Oh be glorified in your glory be glorified today. [Music] Hallelujah. As we look at the next verse. Amen. In everything I say &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; and do &gt;&gt; be glorified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Certainly I know that our hearts are such that we would desire to always say and do the right thing. But sometimes we find ourselves maybe a little bit of contradiction to oursel to what we believe who we are. But the Lord will still be glorified in us. Amen. His work will be done. Amen. It will be fulfilled. No amount of unbelief, doubts, fears, anxieties will stop the promise of God. Amen. Well, God bless you this morning. I I just um want to say um God bless sister Sammy and Logan. I don't see your big brother, but um anyway, and I forgot your name, sweetheart. I'm just terrible. We're good to see you. Glad to see you today. Amen. Uh, Brother Manassa, I I wrote your name on a prayer request because I was thinking and uh thinking about you and Katie. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And um I just expressed that that uh my thoughts. I was excited to hear that you have moved back to Idaho and pray the Lord just give us some time we can rub shoulders again. Amen. Ethan, God bless you today and uh each and every one of you. Just so happy to see each and every one of you. Amen. One of these days all the vacationers will come home and the church will be full again. But um I just I'm thankful for all of you. We're just uh steady, faithful, and God is good. Amen. So, I just want to uh share with you that this coming Sunday, this coming weekend, uh we will be gone to uh Monmouth, Oregon to be speaking for the Valley Christian believers there, Brother Rich Cobb and the saints there in Monmouth. And uh so, Brother David will have this coming Sunday service. And uh just ask that you would pray for us. the Lord would just lay on our hearts um um the right things for them just to have some special services on the weekend. Amen. I just want to say this morning just very interesting how the Lord works. Uh this is not giving glory to men but uh early this morning, brother Sergey sent me a text of a scripture uh that uh said, "Hey, this inspired me this morning." And uh I sent a text back to him. Yes, I just read that. And when we get to it in this scripture, you'll see that where what he sent me stops. My notes begin today. Amen. And uh then actually, brother Trevor in your prayer right there and brother Alex in just few words there just little things that touch and it just really stirs my heart. God is so faithful. Amen. We don't have to receive a program in the mail so we can all be of the same mind. Amen. When when my dad was part of kind of the lay ministry in the Methodist church, uh you know, the the they would receive every Monday morning, they had to obviously mail it previous. Every Monday morning, the church would receive uh the the outline for the week. And then uh the church would then it was kind of a a little cue for the ministry and the people to to be in the same thought or the same mind during the week. And then they would all say, "Oh, praise God. All the Methodist churches are preaching on the same thing, the leadership of the Holy Spirit." But my brother and sister, we truly see how that God puts it on the heart. He sends a memo out. He sends the flyer out, but he doesn't put it in the mail. And it doesn't say you have to follow this, but it's there. He puts it on the hearts in the thoughts of man that we would find that this morning. You can pick up a phone if you would and you could call and realize there is a common thread and that's the moving of the Holy Spirit. I want to speak to you this morning. Uh God bless you. I enjoyed the song service. Brother Alex, Sister Ruth, Brother Titus. Uh just lovely atmosphere. Amen. uh just been kind of studying this actually is tied in my mind anyway to my sheep. It's it's like another step, right? The sheep got to know who they are. The sheep got to understand why they exist and what God is doing. Amen. So, we want to talk about the revealing of the mystery today and how the revelation of the mystery is not nearly as deep as people want to make it. And you'd say, "What is that?" Well, we'll talk about it today if you don't mind. And um Mark the 4th chapter starting verse 9 through verse 20. And uh this is very familiar scripture to us, right? I mean, it's just we never want to say this scripture is common place. it it never should become so common that it's common place but it is a a very known scripture to us that we have studied and read and and preached about many times Mark 4 and 9 through 20 and he said unto them he that hath ears to hear let him hear so one has to already have the right ears &gt;&gt; you don't just say oh I was born with ears I can hear &gt;&gt; that would be what the common thought would be &gt;&gt; that hey we're all Christians we all hear the same thing &gt;&gt; but it's not so &gt;&gt; he's telling he that hath ears to hear let him hear and when he was alone they were about him with the twel asked of him the parable now remember scripture says when Jesus spoke he spoke in parables right &gt;&gt; so you have to have an understanding ing not just take it word for word from the page because otherwise you come up with all kinds of conclusions but you have to have an understanding that comes with ears anointed to hear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he is alone they that were about him with the 12 asked of him the parable. And he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God. Can someone say amen to that? But unto them that are without all these things are done in parables, that seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand, lest at any time they should be converted, and their shi sin should be forgiven them. So this is not this is not Jesus saying uh you know what I don't want them to be saved but it really is tying back into predestination that the ability to hear the word was not something that we acquired &gt;&gt; it was actually born in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was a gift from God &gt;&gt; that we could hear. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said unto them, "Know ye not this parable? How then will you know all parables? The swer sweethth the word. So we'll see. I'm just taking the second part of this because of the length of it. But now is the interpretation of the parable that's just above this in scripture. The ser sweth and these are they by the wayside where the word is sown. But when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground, who when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness, and have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time afterwards when affliction or persecution aristh for the word's sake. Not just not just afflictions and persecution of natural life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not not the things of my, you know, God doesn't love me. I wrecked my car. &gt;&gt; Nothing to do with that kind of atmosphere. But when it comes down and the weight and the heat and everything is brought to bear upon your life because of the gospel, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Immediately they are offended. And these are they which are sown amongst thorns, such as hear the word, and the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and lust of other things entering in choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. Amen. &gt;&gt; And these are they which were which are sown on good ground such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit. Some 30fold, some 60, and some hundred. Heavenly Father, we would just ask you to come open the word to us today. Speak to us, Father. We thank you, Lord, for your precious word, the life that you have given us. We ask you to bless each and everyone today in your precious name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I would like to greet our visitors. Are they? Yes. God bless our visitors today. You may be seated. Amen. I want to focus for just a moment on verse 11. Uh as this is my brother and sister not an intellectual understanding, not an intellectualism that brings about an understanding, but this is a gift of God. He said unto them, "Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God, but unto them that are without." In other words, without, they're outside of the kingdom. Amen. And we sit here today not knowing who is part of the kingdom and who is not. So, it's not for us to put in or out to to encourage only some. We want to encourage all to believe. Amen. All to take a hold of the word of God. And so it's there that you see all these things are done in parables. And you know parables are still baffling the world today. I I uh in in my studies I look at different aspects of where uh uh uh the church world and different things are. And my brother and sister it is there that we see that some taking the word of God putting their spin on it or pursuing wealth. They say that God loves you. He's going to make you rich. Uh and uh I I believe that I I ab absolutely with all of my heart believe that God loves us and is going to make us rich in the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the kingdom of God, he's going to make us rich. He never promised us to be rich in the natural world. He never said this is a sign of sunny skies and and good days are not a sign of God's love and and cloudy days or rainy days are not a sign of his displeasure. But God's love is when he reveals his word to us. He starts to speak to our heart. And what he's doing is giving us a love letter that's coming down saying, "You know what? I love you. And so I'm going to reveal myself to you." Now, you think about in the natural how it is, my brother and sister. This might be a little shocking way to put it, but in not a perverted love of the world today, but in real true love, if a young man or young woman loves a young man, you know, they they don't flaunt themselves to that. But there comes a time of a revealing. That's why as it is, we don't really look at at it as as dating. you just uh you know with a young man here, a young girl there and and flitting around, but actually you pray and in sincerity you desire the Lord to reveal who this person is or who it is that you really love and and uh be the right person. And so it's there that God comes down in a true example of courtship and is slowly revealing himself to us. And as he reveals himself, we have come to the place that we realize, I can't live without him. Amen. This is who I've got to to serve, who I want to be with all of my life. And so it's there we still see that the world is baffled by these parables of scripture, how that they are confessing, as I said, that its wealth is a sign. Some say, well, it's speaking in tongues is the sign. But my brother and sister, God through his word has clearly revealed himself. As the parable is being revealed, it's being brought out. As the disciples sought Jesus for the answer of the parable, so we today should be seeking for the answer to the parable of our lives. Amen. What God is speaking to us. and so many interpretations that that are in the world today of of what is uh what God is expecting and what God is is doing. And my brother and sister, I say this uh a little tongue and cheek. Please don't place too much emphasis on it. But people are saying, you know, this is what God spoke to me and it's absolutely contrary to the word of God. So it wasn't God speaking to them. They should stop and say, "Okay, if it's contrary to the word, God is not going to change his word to make me happy." Amen. So, if it's contrary to the word, then it wasn't really God. A but he come as an angel of light. Satan did. He come as an angel of light. And the people are saying, "Yes, this is what was revealed to me." Absolutely contrary to scripture. So, uh, you know, I just say this with the barest of information, but I received a phone call, uh, a couple days here that, uh, someone wanting to know if our our church did spiritual weddings. And I'm like, what is a spiritual wedding? And they said, "Well, that's when people of the same sex don't really want to have a physical relationship, but they want to have an emotional relationship as husband and wife. Do you do that? And I think it was just the grace of God first thing come out of my mouth. Is that biblical? &gt;&gt; And they said, "What do you mean by biblical?" I said, "Can you find that in the Bible?" Goodbye. Click. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, my brother and sister, this is what we're coming down to. Is that what the church is put in place for? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, this sounds like I'm against this, but I'm not. But is the church supposed to be a food bank? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Is the church supposed to be a political activist? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; All of these things that have been by interpretation drawn out of the out of the the the word of God, out of the message, the gospel, and people have done they they have so much conjecture. They have so much guessing about what is our call. Well, first and foremost, the church is a house of God and should be reverenced as a house of God. And it is a place we come to meet God. And not just in theory, but in literal a presence of the Holy Spirit coming to talk to you and I on a personal basis. Amen. Not a place to learn the theory of religion. Not a place to come of the opinion of religion, but to come see the very expression of Jesus Christ living in our midst. Amen. And so if it's all about our guessing or conjecture, you know, what is it? There's so much we could guess on, no wonder it's so confusing today because people are still arguing over things that are very clearly in the scripture, things that are black and white. And yet man by his very nature wants to say, "I want to know the reason why God says this, this, this, and this." God said, "I said it. You should just believe it." And if I'm God, then you don't have to doubt what I'm telling you. Now, me as a man standing here before you, I might fumble it. And I have done it over over the years uh uh you know, misstate something, not frame it quite right. But my brother and sister, if we have a doubt that God has misframed his word, it it's been misplaced or mis by God. My brother and sister, we're not really Christians. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can't say, "I'm a Christian, but I question." &gt;&gt; Amen. God's got answers for your questions, but we're not here to question. Amen. We're here to say, "Lord, I need an answer for this, for my life." But when we start to question God, then we'll look at this and say, "Well, if God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, then how come not everyone is saved?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the answer is in the scripture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The answer is in the word, but they don't want to receive that answer because it's too direct for them. &gt;&gt; Instead of saying, "Lord, forgive me for my position of where I'm at." Unless someone would misunderstand what I'm saying this morning, this is part of my everyday prayers. Lord, help me to understand and forgive me where I have come short. Amen. Cuz I'm not standing here as some perfect man preaching down. I'm standing here as a man that believes in living life to the fullest. And in doing that, sometimes you bump against the boundaries. And God says, "You know what? You just bump the boundary, but I have grace for you." Amen. And then he anoints us to say, "Wait, I'm driving in the ditch. I'm I'm knocking all the empty McDonald's sacks and rappers and Pepsi cans out of the way because I'm in the ditch. And God says, "I don't want you in that ditch." And we by our human nature get up and we cross right over and we just drive in the ditch on the other side for a while. And then God says, "No, that isn't what I wanted you to do. I want you to come back to the center of the road and I that's where I want you to be." And so by nature, we want to we want to frame it in the way that we think we're supposed to serve God. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I can't find anywhere where God says, "Read my word and guess what it meant." That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. God very clearly says, "I'm going to reveal to you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give to you the answers to your life question." Amen. And you can then base or or place your whole life upon my word. That's right. Amen. Cuz if his word lies, &gt;&gt; how are we going to as mere mortals decide what is true and what is not. That's right. &gt;&gt; We have to have an absolute that we can hang on to with all of our life and say, you know what, this is God's word. I believe this and it's never been proven false yet. So, I'm going to hold on to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, second Peter 1:16-19. For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, my brother and sister here today, what we need to do is be a church full of eyewitnesses. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not not has been. And and look, I'm just going to speak this blunt. Too many people have an understanding of the message as though if you believe what brother Brandham said and the framework of him as a man. So, I'll follow him real close and it'll all work out. That's not what he come for. He says it. This is not what I come for. I come to introduce you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love that? When you're supposed to be introduced to somebody, my brother and sister, you're going to meet somebody, you don't go there and get introduced to to something else, something different. Or the person doing the introducing says, "Well, they didn't show up. I'll take their place." &gt;&gt; You know, so here it is. Brother Brown says, "Now, I I come to introduce you." See, he didn't come to say, "I come to introduce me." &gt;&gt; That's right. I didn't come to to draw you to me. I come to introduce you to Jesus Christ. Amen. And so you might say the success of the message is people's understanding in that and that alone because if you view it in any other fashion then you will be attracted to worship men. Amen. But we're not attracted to worship men. We are called to serve our Lord Jesus Christ. And there are natural and spiritual people in our lives uh that are there that help us along the way. People who mentor us, people who encourage us, people who have answers for questions in our life. But we don't worship that person. We say, "Thank you, Lord, that that person is in my life because they are helping me find answers that I'm searching for." But we only have one that we worship and that is Jesus Christ. Don't let anyone ever tell you that there's any other answer to that equation because we are here simply to worship Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful &gt;&gt; as a man when I first started doing carpentry. I was so thankful that they were men that actually cared enough to say, "Paul, you're getting the right answer, but you're getting it in the wrong way." &gt;&gt; Exactly. That's it. &gt;&gt; You know, in carpentry, you know, you can do all kinds of things. You know, sometimes don't even have to figure out angles to build a hippen valley on a house. You can fake your way through it. And no, I won't explain all of that, but I would perfected faking until men come and say, you know, a speed square, you know why they have all these lines and all these different points on it? That is so you can come and when you go to cut a hip in a valley, you can go in there and you can do a simple equation to figure out what the degrees of that hip and valley are or it should be on the blueprint. &gt;&gt; And then you can take a speed square and you can cut perfect lines every single time by simply knowing that the square won't lie to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Imagine you look down once and the square says this. You look down again, it says something else. You would never know what to trust and you would never come out with a perfect product. &gt;&gt; And the gospel, my brother and sister, is that sure. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And that true for us today that we don't have to guess at it. We don't need to do it. What we need to do is just figure out. And the angle of this hip and valley, if you could take it that way, is a simple fact that the word of God promised, I will lead you and guide you into all truth. So therefore, truth is right here for us. We don't have to go digging through a dumpster to find truth. It's right here before us. And God says, "I will never never lead you from my word. &gt;&gt; I will always lead you." Amen. So, we're not followingly devised fables. We made unto you the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. But we're eyewitnesses. &gt;&gt; For he received from God the Father honor and glory when there comes such a voice to him from the excellent glory. This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased. And I want to tell you what was poured into Christ was poured into the church which is you. Amen. And you will hear these very same words. Amen. This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased. Those words are for you. Well done, my good and faithful servant. So don't get discouraged and don't get turned to the side and don't listen to the doubters. I I often I've said this a little bit recently. Some things have stirred me up on this, but my brother and sister, you know, people will will come and they'll say, you know what, what what you believe, what you it's this. And I'm thinking, I've never thought it was that. Well, it's this over here. And I've thought, no, that doesn't fit. And it's this like this and and this would be But it all boils down to if they want to lead you out, what are they leading you into? &gt;&gt; Amen. So if somebody's leading you out and saying what you believe is false, what are they leading you to? Do do they have greater revelation? And if they do have greater revelation, then God himself obligated himself to lead you into that same revelation. But my brother and sister, many times these voices, these spirits want to lead you out, but they're just going to take you into a wilderness and then abandon you. They're they're going to they're going to say, "Look what I did. I influenced this person. They left that deal." But what are they taking you into? Amen. I'll tell you, the word of God will draw you out of the world and take you into the presence of almighty God, fill you with the Holy Ghost, put the promise of God in you, and then manifest that promise into life. He'll bring it to life. His very word will be living in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 19 is what I really wanted to draw out of that, but the rest was just really just drawing it together. We have also a more sure word of prophecy, where unto you do well that you take heed as into a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your heart. So the process, the stepping stone that God has brought each one of us is not to bring us out into nothing but to bring us as the light. Now, if we could somehow just totally black out the sanctuary today, how much light would it take for you to notice there was a light? &gt;&gt; Not much. &gt;&gt; 40,000 ft over the Amazon rainforest. &gt;&gt; One little light in the jungle &gt;&gt; from that height is absolutely a landmark. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. cuz it's the Amazon rainforest, middle of Brazil is just dark. And that is how little light, just one little light. &gt;&gt; There's not a giant big beam down there shining to the heavens to be noticed. Just one little light. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's how powerful light is. And when that light shines in your heart, it's shining that great in the darkness. Amen. until the day dawn and the day star which is Jesus Christ arises in your heart. In other words, you're seeing a little gleam of light. But that light is growing. It's getting greater. It's coming forth to fulfill the promise of God that he gave to each one of us as sons and daughters of God. He says, you know what? I'm going to be the light in the darkness for you. And he is. Amen. So, a sure word, let's look at this. I've already touched on it, but a sure word of prophecy is not a guess. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think I might be saved. I think I might have the Holy Ghost. I think this might be truth. &gt;&gt; Let's Let's quit our guessing. Let's make certain this is or this isn't. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is right or it's wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is salvation to me &gt;&gt; or it's judgment to me. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. You see, we're not looking for a sensation, my brother and sister. Now, I want you to think, if it sounds like I'm being hard on churches, forgive me, but I'm not. But there is a contrast that is becoming even a greater contrast as we move forward in time. The contrast is more and more obvious. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have religion. &gt;&gt; And we have the word of God. &gt;&gt; They're not necessarily the same thing. &gt;&gt; No, they are. They're not necessarily leading to the same destination. Amen. But look, serving God, I'm going to tell you right now, it's a sensation, but it's not. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. You get excited. There's something that comes with the opening of the word in us. As we recognize that the day star is rising in us, there is a sensation that comes on us. But we don't base our experience on that sensation because there's an evidence that we have the Holy Ghost. There's an evidence that the word is living in us. &gt;&gt; Now, my brother and sister, you fly. Sorry. I I don't know why this even come as a comparison to me, but it's true. I've been there, been flying. We flew that high. Uh and uh because there was all these huge huge uh thunder uh clouds. I forget what they call those kind. at one time I looked it up but but they're totally flat on top &gt;&gt; and we are flying I'm like we're flying really high. We're like 40,000 over 40,000 ft and I'm thinking why are we flying so high? Then I realize if we weren't flying that high we would be flying through the storm. &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly. &gt;&gt; But God says you know what sometimes the storm in your life I'm going to take you above the storm. I didn't do away with the storm. I just elevated and lifted you up to a place that you could look down and realize I could be down there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I got to watch the greatest light show I've ever saw in my life to watch the lightning bounce across the top of the clouds. &gt;&gt; And I I don't want to exaggerate, but I want to tell you it seemed like there was 10,000 bolts of lightning all going different directions at the same time. And then all of a sudden we break out of the clouds and they didn't have to make an announcement. Everybody on the flight, please look out the windows to the right and see there's a light in the darkness. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The minute we broke out of the clouds of unbelief, &gt;&gt; of sin, of fear, anxiety, &gt;&gt; we saw the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We didn't need someone to say, "I think God is here." No. When you have something you're searching for and God opens that to your eyes, we suddenly realize this is not man. This is not psychology. This is not education. This is not an intellectual understanding. My brother and sister, when you are in a hard place in your life and God comes and deals with you, you know it's God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's not a big question mark about maybe I read something and that's what I'm remembering or whatever these voices. Look, every one of us, let's just face it today, every one of us has voices in our head. &gt;&gt; That's right. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; They say it's not a big deal unless you start answering yourself. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; You have voices. &gt;&gt; Now, our job in this day that we're living in is decipher what voices &gt;&gt; are leading you to a better life. what voices are leading you to what you might say indifference &gt;&gt; and what ones are directly leading you into a worse life. But remember the analogy of the conveyor if you're not going forward you are by default going backwards. &gt;&gt; So if someone tells you or tries to convince you that just just stop right here God's in control. cares about you. He loves you. Just just ultimately you'll find that you're going backwards. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Might not be sudden, but you see, God never called us to be unbelievers. &gt;&gt; Never called us to be make believers. He called us to be believers. &gt;&gt; And those other two in one form or another take us backwards. But to be a believer is leading us forward in God's word. And this is a sensation, &gt;&gt; but it is not a sensation that we get a warm fuzzy feeling in our flesh and decide this is all settled. This is all finished. I don't need anymore. I've got God talking to me and everything is fine, my brother and sister. And I I'll put it this way using a phrase of this day. This message, this word of the hour, this revelation of Jesus Christ is not a sensation to be clickbait. That's right. &gt;&gt; It is something that's very real. It's alive. It's living. Amen. It's not just something to draw your attention to do that. Otherwise, my brother and sister, we would look around. Amen. That we would say, "Oh, I felt it. What did you feel?" You might have felt the Holy Spirit. You might have felt a sensation on your flesh. How many years you going to give to that before you know the result? Now, as we read the scripture there, I just want to tell you this is a life-changing message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz you can read down through that previous scripture cipher for yourself. I'm on gravel. I'm in the thorns. I'm caught up in the cares of life. That's a dangerous one. You bet it is. You bet it is. &gt;&gt; We're pursuing a better life, which is a natural instinct for us as humans to to always have something a little bit better for our family, for ourselves, and we get so caught up in that. And u my brothers and sister, I've shared this story with you here at the church. I just feel led to share it again down there preaching there in Arkansas. And uh just the Lord led me to go a certain way. And and I start talking about not all the things that we call blessings are blessings. And I lay out this whole scenario and there's a young man. There's quite a bit more room in that church between the pulpit, the platform, and the deal, but a young man sitting right here. And and I just I I don't know, you know, I'm just Paul. You guys know Paul. I'm sad that you know Paul in some ways, but anyway, I'm just Paul. And this is something led me. And I start talking about how that it would be that that uh you know, you work at a job and and they say, "Hey, we're giving you a promotion." A and um the only catch to the promotion is you now have to work on Sunday but it's substantial raise a substantial change or shift in authority but the just one little catch which is not a big deal is that you now have to work on Sunday oh and did we say that you have to also be responsible for closing the store on Wednesdays part of your responsibility but this is God blessing That young man sitting there, I couldn't read his face. Looking in hindsight, I thought, hm, he did really did have more expression than I realized. But his mama sitting with the pastor's wife and right on the same pew with Sister Jerry's over there. She's about to kick the back out of the pew in front of her, just hallelujah. Praise God. Oh, and didn't even know it was his mama. Just thought she was somebody that was excited. But I tell you what God does. That young man was sitting there. He worked for a business. That business had just made him that exact offer. Amen. Substantial raise, but you're going to have to work on Sunday. You're going to have to close on Wednesday. And he's sitting there and he had been praying, "Lord, I need an answer. This sure looks like you're blessing me with a much better job." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then some crazy guy comes and preaches. and he got up and walked out of church or the service is over went out called his boss and said, "I'm sorry, I can't accept the offer." And the boss asked him why and he had a courage bold and said, "Well, it's going to keep me out of the house of God." Well, is that that important for your career? And he says, "It's important for my spiritual career." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And my my spiritual life is is more important. And and so you look at this, my brother and sister. See, it's a life-changing message. Did Paul Paul didn't have a clue. I'd never been to that church before. I knew the pastor and his wife and the pastor's children and didn't know anyone else in there. So, you know, no insider information except for the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we ought to trust the Holy Ghost. We ought to trust it. We ought to be praying, Lord, give me leadership of the Holy Spirit that I can make the right decisions in my life. Amen. Now let's go on to 1 Corinthians 2 1-10. And brethren, when I come to you, it came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified. as I was with you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling in much trembling. Uh and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power. &gt;&gt; That your faith &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Do we have any faith in the building today? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That your faith would not be in the wisdom of men. &gt;&gt; That's right. not something built up because we can quote the Bible, we can quote the message, we we've got such a perfect understanding, but let our faith, amen, be not in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. Amen. My brother and sister, I tell you, sometimes people get so embraced into the leadership or ministry of their church that they quit looking for themselves and they just believe that somehow God's provided them a man uh or ministry that that is just absolutely going to be like the shortcut for them. You real computer people understand this. You know, if you know what they are, there's all kinds of shortcuts. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but there's also a long way. &gt;&gt; And the long way will get you everywhere the shortcut will take you. But you can guarantee the long way works every time. &gt;&gt; Shortcuts don't always work. &gt;&gt; Pilgrim's progress. I still remember my my all you kids up here. I just come across those pictures just made my heart melt. All the kids here and even even brother Ivan like a great big kid part of the skit. Amen. And and all the rest of you just so cute, so wonderful. And you look at that and I just remember this part and it was played out so well about that shortcut down through the swamp. &gt;&gt; Yeah. All it took was a few more steps to go the right way. &gt;&gt; But there's always this shortcut being offered. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; and and some shortcuts I I I I even have come to use myself. Instead of looking all over the screen trying to figure out which one of those icons means print, you know, you just can pull push control P and it will print. It could just be our computer. It doesn't always work. Maybe for you it does. But you see what God wants us to do is not come into the message, the word of God for the hour, looking for shortcuts. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; There's no shortcut to getting the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no shortcut for living the life. There's no shortcut to make it to heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every bit of the word of God is there for a reason. It is our operator manual. Amen. So you say, "Brother Paul, where are you going on this?" Well, I want to tell you that one, I need to hurry. But two, to make us understand that the revelation of the mystery, my brother and sister, is got no shortcut. &gt;&gt; It's got no easy way to get around this. Now, I'm going to just speak real blunt. Some people think, "Well, you just believe God sent a prophet. There's my shortcut." I'm telling you, that isn't what the word of God says. Amen. The word of God says that we get re we repent, we get baptized, we get filled with the Holy Ghost. Then by revelation, God starts to lead us along as dear children. And he brings us through the mountains, through the valleys, the brier patch, the desert, amen, the rainforest, across the river, amen, through the fire, through the flood. He leads us through every bit of this because it's not about I found a shortcut. It's about I found the one who has guided me all the days of my life and is leading me in spirit and in truth. Leading me into a deeper relationship not with my church but with himself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's what we're looking for. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. How be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world that come to not, but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery. Look, this word that has been spoken, preached by so many men through the ages, we have no problem looking back and looking at Luther and looking at Wesley and going through the ages and looking and see where each man we have no problem. But I want to ask you, where is it today? Where is the word being spoken today? We can't go back and live on Luther's message. We can't go back and live on Wesley's message because we can't go back and duplicate the atmosphere that that seed was planted in. Amen. It might be good soil, but my brother and sister, we weren't called to that day or you would have been there. Amen. We were called to this day. This is the hour God wants you. He's planted you. And amen, it will take the word for its full value. He didn't plant you in the brier patch. He didn't plant you in the gravel patch. He didn't plant you out here to be caught up in the cares of life. He planted you in good soil so that you could take a hold of the word and say, "You know what? I recognize there is something happening in me." And I'm not looking at this over here to judge them. I'm not looking at over here to compare myself to them. But what I do recognize, I'm planted in good soil. I'm planted in the real word of God. good soil and I'm growing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we nec need to recognize, not comparing it. Now, I use a a a farmer analogy, but my brother and sister, there's sometimes maybe you turn around too much on the headland of the field, and you've kind of packed the soil, and that field will come right down there, get up close to the ditch, and that corn just gets shorter and shorter and shorter. &gt;&gt; That's bad corn. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; No. bad environment. &gt;&gt; That's right. Exactly right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's packed so tight, &gt;&gt; you can't put a shovel in the ground. &gt;&gt; Packed so tight, the water doesn't want to soak in. &gt;&gt; It just wants to float over us like water on a duck's back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I believe the message. &gt;&gt; But is it soaking in? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; See, for it to grow, you to grow, it's got to soak in. &gt;&gt; Amen. The water of the word's got to soak in. The seed is there. The soil has everything it needs to be. You probe it right there and send it away to the lab for a soil test and it'll tell you it has the right amount of nitrogen, magnes, and all of these things in it. It's all right. But the atmosphere has got too stiff and formal. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look how far back God was planning the word to come to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which none of the princes of this world knew. For had they known it, they would have would not have crucified the Lord of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. You imagine even in that day those men if they had realized exactly what they were doing. This is the Messiah. This is God that we've been looking for. They would have fell down and repented for their hard hearts. &gt;&gt; Or would they? You got to understand there is that little contradiction in a sense. I use the word contradiction as in contrast. Maybe that's a better word. If it wasn't in their heart to believe, you could not provide them with sufficient evidence to convince them otherwise. Jesus said, "Look, if you don't believe I am he, then believe for the works that I do." &gt;&gt; Just believe the works. &gt;&gt; If you don't want to acknowledge me, just believe the works. But the works speak of me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; But did they? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; That's the harsh reality of it, my brother and sister. &gt;&gt; Look, we can fill a church clear full of people if you just preach everybody's going to heaven. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Grace Tabernacle would already be building out on the outskirts of Nampa, a much larger church if you just give assurance to everyone that no matter how you live or where you're planted, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; you're going to heaven. I've shared with the church, hope you don't mind sharing this. I did Sister Audrey's funeral there in Dacon Chapel in Caldwell and got all done. The man who runs the the the Dacon funeral home, he called me in his office and says, "Uh, Paul, that was that was just a fantastic funeral. I don't know how many of you were there, Sister Audrey's funeral, but um fantastic funeral. That's so incredible. Look, we're going to have an opening the minister that that in-house minister who does funerals here for people who are unchurched or you know whatever their circumstance and I want to offer you the job. Now, this been a lot of years ago, so the money might not impress you now, but he was like, "Uh, we do uh you would do three to four services a week, and we pay a minimum of $500." My brain's like, "2,000 a week? Four weeks in a month? That's about four times as much money as I make right now." He says, "Cuz I just couldn't believe how you presented that for this lady." You ever have the Lord just come on the scene and speak to you just almost immediately? &gt;&gt; I was like, "Lord, &gt;&gt; sounds like that would be sorry for the phrase of the day. That'd be a good gig." He says, "I I just love how you presented her the change you saw in her life and how as a daughter of God and the little light turned on. How are you going to send a lion cheating drunk &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; to heaven? And I told him, "Sir, in all respect, the reason I could say the words I said over Sister Audrey is because they're all true." &gt;&gt; You see, my brother and sister, we're not here just to speak vain words. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; We're here to speak truth. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; And then after the fact, I hope you don't mind a little humor. And I thought, you know, after a while it'd be pretty boring preaching four funerals a week. I mean, depressing. Depressing. You'd almost want to just have a pre-recorded thing and just say, "Huh? Yeah. Yeah. Some of you got that. Yep. Will that work? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Will that send them where they need to go? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Where they're going to go? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No, my brother and sister. It takes a wisdom that is the wisdom of God in a mystery. Amen. Which God orained before the world and to our glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they didn't know. But as it is written, verse nine, I hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the hearts of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. I just like to ask you this morning, anybody here love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. He has prepared the mystery of God. He's prepared his word and he's prepared the final result for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we're in love with him. And it wasn't because we're some super spiritual people, but we love him because he first loved us. And we recognize the depth of that love that he would save our soul from hell and keep us and let us live a wonderful life here on the earth while we serve him. I've had people tell me, "Man, being a Christian must be so boring. You don't get to do nothing." And I thought, "You don't have a clue what you what you were saying. You're out there. Oh, we got drunk. Wasn't it fun? Oh, we did this. Wasn't it fun? Oh, we did that. Wasn't it fun? But I tell you, my brother and sister, every morning, noon, and night, in spite of all the contradiction and the distress and everything of life, anxieties and whatever that comes our way. I know none of you ever have tribulation in your life. But when tribulation that we can get up and say, "It was good to serve God. It was good to walk in the way that the Lord has called me. It is good." Amen. If we have a hangover, it's because the Lord has anointed us. And we get up the next day and that atmosphere is still with us. We're still walking in the presence of the word and the life that is there is still with us and we're remembering this is a lifechanging message. Amen. And the mystery. Oh my. We're going to get to the mystery. It's too deep for you guys. A few more years of preaching, you'll start to understand the mystery. We got to dig deeper to get to the mystery. my brother and sister, the way up is down and the way down is up. My brother and sister, to realize we're looking at the mystery as some great thing. But the problem is everywhere there's a mystery, people are trying to preach a shortcut. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's no such thing as a shortcut. &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 10. But God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the spirit searchth all things, yay, the deep things of God. Look, the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I love this. I I love what God did in my own life, my own testimony, my own witness that God started many years ago when I did not deserve to have him treat me so kind. But he started and he started just laying things in. And so the opening of the word, my brother and sister, is not meant to be a show. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; It's not meant for us to be able to say, "Our church has the opening of the word. Oh, this man revelated. Oh, this is a it's not a show, my brother and sister. Neither in Jesus day was it a show, and neither in this day is it to be a show. God works and people see. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But it's not a show. Amen. It's meant to be personal, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we talk about personal? &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; You know what personal is? &gt;&gt; That's when it is so real. Amen. &gt;&gt; That you and you alone can hang your life on that. I can't hang my life on your experience. And you don't want to hang your life on my experience. It becomes a personal experience that you can declare, I have met Jesus Christ face to face. I may have met him on a mountaintop. I may have met him in the valley. I may have met him in a mud pit, &gt;&gt; but I still met him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you can't tell me any difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now look at this. I want you to catch this. The lamb comes down and takes the book. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Now the word says that there was no one worthy. John wept. You imagine how he felt when he looks out here and realize there's no one worthy to take the book. &gt;&gt; And John weeps. But yet there's a voice says, "Hey, weep not, John, &gt;&gt; for one has come to take the book." &gt;&gt; And the lamb comes down and takes the book and he climbs back to the throne with the book. No one was worthy to loose the seals. So the lamb himself starts breaking open the seals of this book. Seven seals on that book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He looses the seals and the mysteries. Look, John is sitting here witnessing this in real time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This not a podcast. &gt;&gt; This not a unwind this and watch it again thing. &gt;&gt; John's watching this or experiencing this in real time. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; And as the lamb starts to break or loosen the seals, John starts to see all these things unfolding before him. But many of these he does not understand. Many of this is uh too deep for John to uh to comprehend. And so as the seals are being loosed, the mysteries are being unfolded. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're they're coming out. They're there. And we're not here to go ahead and preach on that today. But when the mysteries are unfolded, we'll see seven ages, my brother and sister. And there were names that were revealed or called out in every one of those seals. Called out names. There was a loosing of the names that was there. And there were people in every one of those church ages that started to say, "Man, I I don't know what's come over me, but I I just got to serve God. I'm going to serve God. I believe this. I see this." And I'll just throw one little thing into you so you'll know firsthand how miraculous God is. And there in the village of Chievac was a a elder amongst them, Chupek uh Eskimos. And and it was there and God had had the word witness to this man, but he had a heart attack. And they flew him out of there into uh Bethl, Alaska in a medevac. And and so he's there uh you know, he had kind of pushed back about, well, I don't know. This is so complicated. This stuff you're sharing with me out of scripture is so complicated. the loosing of the seals, my brother and sister. It can look so complicating, but he's there and and uh he's like, I I just don't know. I don't know. And you know, the uh um Maruvian movement, and not much different in a lot of ways from Catholicism, but the Maruvian movement right there, you know, they do their best, my brother and sister, when I say best to keep you in church, they'll intimidate you. &gt;&gt; They will bring every bit of pressure to bear they can to keep you in the church. And just in case any of you wonder, I'm just kind of the opposite. &gt;&gt; If God can't move you to church, how's Paul going to move you to church? &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. &gt;&gt; If God can't cause you to worship, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; to pray, read your Bible, &gt;&gt; how can I do that? &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want you to think I'm indifferent. &gt;&gt; I care very much and I pray for you very much, but there's no moving you if God can't move you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; That's right. He's in the hospital in Bethl, Alaska. ICU, major heart attack. I believe it was the second night he's there. In the middle of the night, he says, "I don't know if I was awake or asleep. I just started seeing all of this take place. It's unfolding before me." Now you got to understand there was no church age book in the Chupic language. He'd never read it. It's unfolding before him. At first light, he gets out of bed. This man's had a major heart attack. puts on his clothes, walks out of the hospital, goes down to a a nephew's house there in Bethl and says, "I need to borrow a snow machine." And they're like, "What are you doing?" He said, "I'm going home." It's like, "Well, you could wait till this afternoon and take a flight." He goes, "That isn't what I saw. I saw me taking a journey." Gets on a snowmobile. It's a long ride across the middle of nothing and nowhere. &gt;&gt; He gets back to the village, shocks everybody. You're here, but the plane hasn't come yet. Cuz it stormed and the plane didn't fly at all. &gt;&gt; And he goes to brother Andrew and he says, "Something's happened and I believe you can interpret this." And he says, "Well, I'll do my best. We'll pray and God will answer." A man who could not read English, didn't speak English, never read a word, starts in sharing what he saw. And brother Andrew says, "Stop." Goes and gets the book &gt;&gt; and says, "Start again at the beginning." There it is. There it is. See, as a seed or a son of God, God wanted to make that so real to him. He unfolds it all in a vision to him. It plays before him just like it was pan vision &gt;&gt; and just unfolds before him. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how serious God is about saving sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And some people say, "I just don't see how that could be. I don't." Well, I'm telling you this very same thing that John saw here. There's nothing hindering God from doing the same thing to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With you, for you. &gt;&gt; So, it's there. It starts to reveal that. Now, look what it is, my brother and sister. He brought it to earth and he revealed this in a prophetic message to John. But the whole mystery is not revealed in John. John doesn't have an answer to everything. John shares what God gave him in that day, in that eye, and opened his eyes to see. And then he comes and tells him, "Eat the book." Now, I want you to realize, my brother and sister, we're not exempt. You got to eat the book. If you expect to see God move in your life, you've got to eat the book. Amen. And the results are not always pleasurable because he says that that he ate the book and it was bitter in his belly. And the bitterness was not because what he ate was not true. It was because it called his body, his life to a transformation from who he was to what God was calling him to be. And there's the bitterness between our flesh and what the word of God is. It comes to a place we place hard decisions. We come to that and we must face those and we do that and it becomes hard. &gt;&gt; Amen. And some when their life got too busy and complicated fell away. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Because this is too hard. &gt;&gt; But for those that are in good soil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now let's look at this. I need to hurry along. Revelations 10 7-9. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he began to sound, the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants of prophets. And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, "Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel, which standeth upon the sea, and upon the earth." And I went into the angel, and I said unto him, "Give me the little book." And he said unto me, "Take it, and eat it up, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey." I'm telling you, my brother and sister, this commandment is still living today. You got to take the book and you got to just plan on I'm going to eat it and it's going to cause my life to change. It's going to come to where I know that I've got to change. And sometimes change can be so hard. Sometimes being brought face to face in reality is so hard. But when it's sweet in your mouth, you've got to go back. Anybody got a sweet tooth? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who doesn't have a sweet tooth is more like it. I think brother Adam doesn't have a sweet tooth. But anyway, he's always telling me, "Why are you eating that?" And I'm like, "Cuz it tastes good. Take the sugar out and tell me what it tastes like." But I'm telling you, my brother and sister, it's so sweet in the mouth. &gt;&gt; Son of God has to go back and take another bite of the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it says, "Maybe you need to repent." And we stop and go, "Oh, &gt;&gt; I've had this grudge against this person for 25 years. What do you mean I got to get rid of it? &gt;&gt; That's it. Oh, lust of the flesh. Oh, but it brings me such. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is it? Let it go. &gt;&gt; Let it go. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Let it go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep eating the book. &gt;&gt; Keep eating the book. Oh, I don't like going to church. It upsets me. &gt;&gt; Well, you ought to thank God it upset you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because I tell you, if it didn't bother you at all, &gt;&gt; it would be a sign &gt;&gt; that you're &gt;&gt; of the other. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we weren't called &gt;&gt; to be them. That's right. &gt;&gt; We were called to be us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You want the mystery to be revealed? Anybody like to hear? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; The mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is such a deep subject today. You guys will know that we're just dredging so deep. Eat the book. &gt;&gt; Right. You don't need a preacher to preach the revealed message to you. You eat the book and God will preach the revealed message to you. Now, let me clarify that &gt;&gt; God will take a preacher and he will preach the words, but if it's not coming out of the book to you, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; The preacher is just so much garble in the background. But when something's real in your heart, something's living in your heart and you hear the word preached, something takes place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see this mystery, my brother and sister, we could get up here, and this was an interesting thought to me cuz I I just saw a little deal that that stimulated me along this line. And um so this man, he's actually a very good Pentecostal preacher, good, solid guy. wouldn't be surprised to see him in heaven. He He isn't preaching some theology of a certain way. He just breaks the Bible down. And um let's just say I I think I'm pretty sure I know where he gets his research from. &gt;&gt; But I want you to see what this is like. He starts Well, we'll just use this. He starts over here. He's got a few scriptures. Then he's got a few scriptures. And he's got some scriptures. And then he's got a deal in the center. And it starts to do and then he says he he goes he goes you know you see this ties to this scripture which comes back and clarifies this and then this does and this comes and after 15 minutes there's so many scribbles on that board you can't follow it. Bible's too complicated. What is the simplicity? God started and then he added and then he added. You can follow it when it's that way, can't you? And he added, and he added, and he added, and he added, and he added, and he added, and he added to someone who doesn't know, it looks like a complicated mess. to somebody who's been eating the book. That's no longer a mystery. You can follow every line, every scripture, and specifically every end result because you watched it happen. You watched it come to pass. Not in somebody else. I'm talking about you. You got to see God working in you. &gt;&gt; And what someone else says is a complicated mess is the word being revealed to you. &gt;&gt; See, it's not a something we teach. Now there are components of the scripture that that are taught and we gain understanding but my brother and sister without foundation without let me use this example it's man without his original scriptures which included revelations 10:7 you have to have somewhere you start building from &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; and as this takes place you start to see it and suddenly it's no longer just a bunch of scribbles on a page it suddenly is like this was me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And then this was me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And then this was the more mature me. And this is the more revelated me. And this is the me when I understood who I was in the kingdom of God. And then this is me when God started dealing with me personally. &gt;&gt; And this is me when the word opened up in my presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Suddenly the mystery is not so mysterious. But if we just sat down and we look at it as, "Oh, there's a mystery." &gt;&gt; As a minister, and I don't make light of this, but I guess I do. You can sit here and go, "Oo, but that's not what it's about. It's God proving to you." Now, let me move forward here. I got to keep going. What is a vision? Now look at this here. And then when it did, this one that was standing by me, behind me, the same voice, the angel's voice said, "I'll meet you in there." And this is the third pull. Amen. And we could sum the third pull for those of you who wouldn't necessarily know. We can sum the third pull in a very simplistic fashion. Amen. God with us. God God above us. God with us. God in us. I'm getting myself confused here. So God above us, God with us, God in us. There's the three poles coming out. That's very simplistic. This third poll, but nobody will know nothing about it. And I said, well, I don't understand why in there. Why there? He said, it will not be a public show. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what is this? We're going to have mystery seminars. We're going to have revelation seminars. We're going to have these kind of things that where the world's heading today. We're going to gather everybody and we're going to teach you about the Holy Ghost. Well, why don't we teach the word, let the Holy Ghost come down and teach them what the Holy Ghost is about. Intellectualism won't save us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, having a good teacher, my brother and sister, you know, I've told this story in the church before, high school. There was a girl named Vicki in our class. Really nice girl, really cute. Everybody liked her. Uh, and uh, and we're in algebra 1 and Vickiy's constantly telling the teacher, "I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand." Now, you have to understand that Vicki, you know, the school I went to, actually, you could get more than a 4.0. I don't know if schools do that very much, but you know, if you turned everything in time and and it was perfect and this and that and you know, whatever they allowed him. I know that that Vicki had a 4 point something above the mark and everybody's like found something Vicki can't do. A lot of people were like, "Yeah, we found Vickiy's weak spot here. She can't do algebra." And she just kept saying, "Now, teacher, explain this to me. I don't I don't get this." But the second half of the year went to algebra, too. And Vickiy's just turning out the papers and the rest of the class is going, "Teacher, explain this to us." Because you see, she caught the principle of it all, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We all took a shortcut. I got embarrassed. I got shamed drastically in class one day. Teacher didn't intend to do it. The teacher said, "Paul, on this test, you got the right answer. I want you to write how you did this on the board for the rest of the class. And I was like, why? She said, cuz I actually am baffled how you got the right answer. And so I had, she let me have the paper and I'm up there and I put it on the board and I draw this all out. This pretty complicated deal. and I I come over here and I come up with the right answer and the teacher just stood wasted the whole rest of the class just stood there and goes I don't see how well just follow the logic and she says there is no logic I've got another one for you do this one and I looked at that and I thought that might have been luck I told her, "I'm not I'm not doing anymore." She says that she said, "That's fine because I think I've already figured out the way you got the answer and you can't duplicate it." My brother and sister, I want an answer for you in your experience with God that can be duplicated day after day after day, circumstance after circumstance after circumstance. don't want you to come down the road in your life and have a failure because it just doesn't work. God's got a tried and trueue and proven program. &gt;&gt; And it's not for us to sit around and try and look at the mystery. The mystery is Christ in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; The hope of glory. Are there other things that we see that God reveals? We look at these things. Yes, they are. But I want you to understand the real mystery that matters starts with Christ in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we're not at that point, you won't be able to duplicate it on the chalkboard for the rest of the class. But we have to come to the place by grace of God in sickness and in health, in good times, in bad times, whatever it might be, we need to be able to duplicate the word in our life again and again and again. This, let me put it this way, is not a fad religion. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; This is life. &gt;&gt; This is what will carry us all the days we've had. you know, uh, our our brother Bob, sister Joanne, I get a little emotional about this, but my own mama all these years, not a lot of flash, not a big to-do, no headlines. They just lived &gt;&gt; the gospel &gt;&gt; day after day after day. Imagine God could give you the opportunity to live the gospel longer than most people even live. You think that was an accident? No, sir. That's an enduring power, a revelation of the mystery of Christ in them. &gt;&gt; That's right. And we have that same gospel, that same message, that same word is in you and I today that no matter whether the sun shines or it doesn't, whether the economy collapses or it doesn't, it doesn't matter what it is, the mystery is being revealed in you and I. And that is Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now look at this. Let me get focused. It will not be a public show this time. I don't understand going in that closet like that. And he said, "Is it not written by our Lord, when thou prayest, be not like the hypocrites who like to be heard before men, but enter into the secret closet?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And pray to the Father who seeth in secret, and who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. It's perfectly to the scripture every time. &gt;&gt; There's a great mystery, my brother and sister, opened up right here in a few short lines of what is taking place. You realize now I speak this to people that are established. You look at this. Some people still think there's got to be a a tent and still got to be a little room and still got to be this and got to be that. But right here before our eyes is a mystery revealed. Amen. Unfolded right out of the word while people we're looking for that day. We're waiting for that day. And that day is taking place right now in your life, in your prayer life, in your eating of the book. Amen. And sometimes, come on, let's be honest. It's bitter in our belly when we realize I have been totally wrong and I I just, oh, how could I been so wrong? You know, why my behavior? Why this? Why that? But it's so sweet in our mouth. We have to go back for another bite. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then God says, "This is how I'm changing you." Amen. &gt;&gt; Day by day. &gt;&gt; Just keep eating. Amen. &gt;&gt; The book sir, &gt;&gt; it will change you. &gt;&gt; That's it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. I want to ask, can I redeem that 15 minutes brother David was talking about? &gt;&gt; Yeah. See, not a not a public show. This is something that's taking place in the secret chamber of your heart. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; It's not a public show. &gt;&gt; Now, look, while it's not a public show, it's got to be on display. We can't go hide this. Do we hide it under a bushel? &gt;&gt; No, we can't. Always love that song, especially when it's little kids singing it, you know. Amen. See, it's not a stunning news item. It's not. Don't you just love this, you know? Uh, sorry to even bring up YouTube on in church, but you look at this, you know, and there's headlines on YouTube, you know. I just saw one the other day. Oh, the Lord told me this, the end of the world, you know, and in one week it has like 18,000 people who've clicked on it. And then they get up there and they start talking Babel that doesn't even line up with the word of God. You know what that's called? That's why I used the word earlier. Clickbait. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They're getting their little check from YouTube &gt;&gt; and that's all they cared about. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They don't care if they're telling you truth. They don't care if they're helping you in eternal life. They're getting a paycheck. They're called hirlings. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And they they're starting to say, "Well, the Lord told me." And I'm thinking, "My, the Lord talks to them lip to ear." Oh, wait. They got even better. They're now telling the Lord what they're going to do. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. The last I checked, it's me listening to God, not God listening to me in the determining where the world is going. Amen. What is happening tomorrow? What is this? What is that? God didn't come down and say, "Paul, what do you think I ought to do tomorrow?" No. What he does is says, "Paul, whatever happens tomorrow, I'm with you. &gt;&gt; I'm in you. &gt;&gt; I will lead you. I will guide you. I will take that." My brother and sister, there's a great mystery right there. If you want to get down into the deep thing, to be guided by the Lord every single day of your life is a great mystery because we as humans are human. Amen. And we act like human and we think like human and we do like human. And God says, "I'm going to change you to where you will follow me." Amen. &gt;&gt; You will hear my voice &gt;&gt; because you are my sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, do you think maybe we should change our website and we should change our thing to have some more like big God came to church with us today? &gt;&gt; Well, it's true, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Where two or three are gathered in my name, I'll be there. So, I could stand up here and put a big highlight on that. God came to church with us today. But is that necessary? No sir. Because as believers, we know where two or three are gathered in his name, he is present. &gt;&gt; We don't have to put some big headline to make it mysterious. &gt;&gt; Oh, you know, you look at this. I I I I have to admit I I listened to this the other day, a little video clip, man-made. It was 18 minutes on how to get the Holy Ghost. I wish he would have used scripture, but he defined in every natural intellectual way of what it is to have the Holy Ghost. And I'm telling you, people who would listen to that will be shocked to find out later they don't have the Holy Ghost. But let me share this little story before I close. Remember the man who come to brother Brandham and he says I want the Holy Ghost. I'm going to just paraphrase it. Found a little flyer one day. Where are you going to go? Where are you going to be when your life is over? And he said something rose up in me. &gt;&gt; And I thought, where will I go? &gt;&gt; I want the Holy Ghost. And he went over here, but it didn't satisfy. And he went over here and it didn't satisfy. And he went all these places, it didn't satisfy. Finally, here's and he comes to Brother Brandon and he says, "How do I get the Holy Ghost? I've been sighing and crying day and night going all over searching for the Holy Ghost." Brother Brandham asks him a few simple questions about what was his reaction. And the man shares how when I read those words, something something happened inside of me. This is a pretty deep mystery when you think about it. Don't we want confirmation we've got the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Don't we want God to to confirm to us? Sure. &gt;&gt; And he talks about what happened in his life and how he started pursuing and reading and studying and praying. And brother Brandham says, "You know, when you picked that little flyer up and that little something happened in you and you said, I have to have this." &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; He said, "There &gt;&gt; you had the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; What a mystery. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Or we can turn it into a year's worth of classes, &gt;&gt; tests to be taken, a review board that you must pass in front of. Or maybe we could have a test today. How many quotes can you quote? And if you can't quote 50 quotes per verbatim, you probably don't have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not even going to take the test because I couldn't pass it. But I believe by revelation, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has revealed a mystery to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of who we are. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why we're here, what is taking place. &gt;&gt; And it all comes back. Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not anointed on your flesh, &gt;&gt; not in the church you attend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I've got so much more. Ain't that it's just terrible? You see, very personal, very public, think about the word says, "If you're ashamed of me, I'll be ashamed of you." So, we don't want to be ashamed. We want our life to be on display to the world. Amen. It's not a union with the church. &gt;&gt; It's a union with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, this will be awkward. Forgive me. Just be I'll pick on Sister Sue. She's like a big sister to me, even though she's so short. But if Sister Sue was a another young lady, I couldn't say, you know, I really like qualities that Sister Sue has. I think what I would do is I I think I'll just have a relationship with Sister Sue. Maybe it' be a spiritual one and that'll that'll help change my life. Then things get complicated and they get ugly and and then pretty soon, Sister Sue and I fight over something and I decide I've spiritually divorced you, which means I unfriended her. Come on. These are real types, my brother and sister. This is how people are. Yeah. No, I'm offended. I don't like what you have to say. I don't like how you do that. You don't agree with me. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. And then you start a pattern. Friend, unfriend, friend, unfriend. Holy Ghost comes and says, "Eat the book." Oh, praise God. I got the shivers. I got this. Oh, Jesus Christ is my friend. And the word says, "Quit your adultery. Quit your smoking. Quit your drinking. Quit dressing like you belong on a street out here. Quit those things." Unfriend. Church makes me happy. friend. Church preaches truth unfriend until you come to the church that always makes you happy. Well, I tell you what, if you find a church that always makes you happy, run. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's when you need to run. &gt;&gt; Not to them, away from them. Because this gospel is meant to change us. Not to change for us, but us to change to fit the gospel. Amen. God bless you. We'll have to we'll have to just bring this up at another point in time. I didn't realize I just had so much here. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, Sister Ruth, that's what we'll do. I know brother David the other day says, "Brother Paul, don't be cutting them off like that." But but we're gonna cut this off. Amen. I want you to see, saints, this mystery. Yeah. Is there a mystery involved? Seven church ages. It was hid from a lot of people for a long time. It was there all the time. The seals right there in the Bible all the time. But God opened it up. the vials, the plagues, tribulation, all of this. It's been there all the time. And some people go this way and some go that way. And for example, don't mean to be offensive, but you know, they built a whole religion around 144,000 when it's so clear in the scripture that's not Gentiles, that's Jews. And so they they they oh, we have a great mystery. I don't say this to make light of, but I was working on a construction site once and a man come and he says, "Can I witness to you?" And I said, "Of course." And he starts off and he tells me, he says, "Yeah, this is who we are. This is what we believe. This is what we do." And you know, and there's 6.5 million of us, blah blah blah blah blah, and this is how this works. And I just said, "Sir, stop. Stop." He's like, "Oh, oh, you got a question." I do. If only 144,000 are saved, what happens to the other 6 and.3 million or whatever. I don't know. I would encourage you to find out &gt;&gt; and I would encourage you to read your Bible and realize the scriptures talking about the Jews. See, you can create a mystery &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; out of anything. &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly. But it takes revelation of the word of God to unfold the mysteries and make them where they reflect in our life. That's what God's doing. This word is not about what Martin Luther did. &gt;&gt; Martin Luther is in the word. But it wasn't about what he did. It's what God is doing right now. This message, this hour, this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad that God's revealed a mystery? One of the greatest mysteries there is is who you are in Jesus Christ. Amen. That's a mystery that no man can answer for you. It has to be God speaking lip to ear to you that you realize I am a son of God. I am a daughter of God and I know it. I didn't read it in a book. I didn't just hear it from someone. Something I know. Amen. God bless you. If it looks like I've cut it off, it's because I have. Let's stand and sing a song here. Amen. Time is so fleeting, saints. Amen. I think I ought to invent a church clock that um we could just push the button here and instead of speeding it up, it would slow it down. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Scripture says there come a time would stand still. Let that be a house of God. 7:49. Amen. Is it good to be Christians today? Amen. I thank the Lord. Amen. I thank the Lord for the mystery that even when I would do good and evil is present with me, I realize I'm not evil. I am good. And God knows that. Amen. that we can stand here today realize this flesh will be with us all the way to the rapture. &gt;&gt; But what we want is the Holy Ghost to be with us all the way to the rapture. Amen. Oh, purify my heart. Let me be as gold. Preious silver purify my heart. Let me be as gold. Your gold refiners fire my heart's one desire &gt;&gt; is to be holy &gt;&gt; set aart for you. Lord, I choose to be holy, set aart for you, my master, ready to do your will. Purify my heart. Cleanse me from within. and make me holy. Purify my heart. Cleanse me from sin. Deep within. Refineer's fire. My heart's one desire is to be holy, set aart for you, Lord. I choose to be holy, set aart for you, my master, ready to do your will. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's sing number 651. This song I just came in my heart this morning. want to sing it. I know not why God's wonderous grace to me he hath made known nor why unworthy Christ in love redeemed me for his own. But I know whom I have believed it and am persuaded that he is aable to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day. I know not what this saving faith to me he did in part. Nor how believing in his word wrought peace within my heart. But I know whom I have believeth and am persuaded that he is aable to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day. I know not how the spirit moves, convincing men of sin, revealing Jesus through the word, creating faith in him. But I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which are committed unto him against that day. And I know not what of good or ill may be reserved for me. Of weery ways or golden days before his face I see. But I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is aable to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day. I know not when my Lord may come at night or noon day fair, nor if I'll walk the veil with him or meet him in the air. But I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day. Let's go to number 634 before we dismiss. 634. Christ our redeemer died on the cross. Died for the sinner, paid all his due. Sprinkle your soul with the blood of the lamb. And I will pass will pass over you. When I see the blood. When I see the blood. When I see the blood, I will pass. I will pass over you. Chiefest of sinners, Jesus will save. All he has promised, that will he do. Wash in the fountain open for sin and I will pass will pass over you. When I see the blood. When I see the blood. When I see the blood, I will pass. I will pass over you. Judgement is coming. All will be there. Each one receiving justly his due. Hide in the saving sin cleansing blood. And I will pass will pass over you. Oh, when I see the blood. When I see the blood. When I see the blood, I will pass will pass over you. Oh, great compassion. Oh boundless love, oh loving kindness, faithful and true. Find peace and shelter under the blood and I will pass. I will pass over you. When I see the blood. When I see the blood. When I see the blood, I will pass will pass over you. Amen. With that song, we'll dismiss. God bless you. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
