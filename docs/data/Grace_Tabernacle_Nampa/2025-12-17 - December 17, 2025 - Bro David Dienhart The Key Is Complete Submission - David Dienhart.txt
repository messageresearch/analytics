And so we ask our brother David to come tonight. Just like to sing Give Me Jesus 700. In the morning when I rise. In the morning when I rise. In the morning when I arrive, give me Jesus. Give me Jesus. Give me Jesus. You can have all this world but give me Jesus. And when I am alone. When I am alone. When I am alone. Give me Jesus. Give me Jesus. Give me Jesus.

Give me Jesus. &gt;&gt; Bless you, beloved. &gt;&gt; Give me Jesus. and have all this world. Give me Jesus. When I rise, give me Jesus. The Bible said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these other things you're so disturbed about and upset about and wondering what you're going to do and not do will be added to you. Your job will work better. Your house will work better. &gt;&gt; You just have to give yourself first to him. &gt;&gt; And where is this kingdom of God? In you. &gt;&gt; So, who are we to seek first? Him. Put him first. I remember it been many, many years ago, but I heard a message. It smoked my heart. I made a promise to the Lord. He said, "Every time I want you to sit down and read the word, you've got Satan points something else for you to do." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the Lord said, "But if you'll put me first." And I did. And I said, "Lord, by your grace, when you lay in my heart to feed and to pray, I'm not going to let something else that I think has to be done or something Satan wants me to look at or wants me to do, I'm going to put you first. You say, "Brother David, you know, you just I just can't I just can't do that first thing in the morning. Why not? Well, I need my beauty sleep." Brother, sister, you can make time. We ought to be redeeming the time &gt;&gt; and giving it to him. So, I just say that to encourage you. I know by experience what that means and I know it works. So, God bless you. Let's stand together. Glad to be here tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It don't matter if there's many here. It doesn't matter. God doesn't look at numbers. He looks at open hearts. &gt;&gt; And he's looking at not the number here, but where two or three are gathered together in my name, he's in the midst. And so, we want more of him. I appreciate the songs tonight. And God bless you. You can musicians can be seated if you'd like, but everything went just exactly even to the last one. Give me Jesus. And so we want that. And I and I just greet those online listening in. You just may God bless you and bless his word to our hearts tonight. May we have open hearts to receive from you. &gt;&gt; If it means correction, then it's the love of God to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And may we take the right attitude and our attitude, you know, our attitude toward the word will determine life. &gt;&gt; Just the attitude toward your toward the word of God when it's brought. Amen. So it can determine eternal life. And so we just want to be very sensitive to how the Lord speaks to us and realize it's not the man you've come to hear, but it's the word of the Lord. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we know that you're our Lord. I'm so glad that individuals in this hour can say you are my Lord and you are our father and we are your seed, your elect, your gene of your own life. And Lord, we are here not to be a show. We are here to declare you. The testimony we hold, Lord, is the spirit of prophecy. And you said we would prophesy again. The word would be in the mouth of your bride. She would be the final voice to this final age. Not another voice, but your voice. What the spirit of God said through his prophet, the bride will say. And so, Father, we know that this is our time and you've come on the scene. And Lord, you're desiring a greater love affair with your people. Bless your word now. Father, strengthen your people through your word and bring faith as you promise. For it comes by hearing the word in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. If you turn me to Revelation with me, I mean to Revelations 19. Very familiar verse. We go to it a lot in this hour because it's our day. It's our time. It's what's taking place. And we understand that we're soon to be carried over here, brother, sister. We're very, very close. And we see Israel as our time piece. We see what's happening. We see the scriptures being fulfilled. They're in their homeland. And Jacob's having trouble. And so, but they're they have they're in their land. They were got wolves got after him. Brother Bam said, pushed them into their land. They're in their place just waiting for the bride. You know what they're waiting for? They're waiting for the bride to go. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So they can receive two witnesses. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I know we're close, even the elements and everything. So we're close to our catching away. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God wants you to know what he thinks about it, thinks about you, and and to realize that he's calling every individual. He can't come for his bride until she's complete and until she's matured. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a maturity. And so there's we know that we've been given a message to mature the bride. In fact, we have a message that's a perfect interpretation of the word. And so we can't take that lightly. Amen. We have an open book. And so many things. What I want to say tonight, I just I've had to narrow way down to just one subject. It's been on my mind here for four, three, four, five weeks. And I've ministered on this or on these on these things that the prophet said many times. But I want to speak on the key is complete. The key the key is complete submission. The key is complete submission. In verse 7 and 8 of Revelation 19, let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready. And to her was granted to her was granted. You want to remember that in revel in Matthew 25:10. And they that were ready went in with him to the marriage. And then to her that's gone into the marriage was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white, for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. Then it says in verse nine, "And he saith unto me, write, blessed are they which are called into the marriage supper of the Lamb, for he saith unto me, these are the true sayings of God." I want you to turn with me over to 1 Corinthians 6. Now, we know the prophet said, "The marriage has come." He said, "We're going to the rapture." The rapture is the wedding supper. He said, "The ministry of our day when he took the book, same thing that that that Boaz did when he when he took Ruth Ruth, he took the book." Amen. So, we realize that there's a book opened and everything we need to get ready is provided in that open book. &gt;&gt; And so, he's because and I'll get to that in just I get ahead of myself here. So in 1 Corinthians 6 I'll take one verse here verse 17. But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. So may God add his blessings to the word. You can be seated. Amen. Brother Brandham on the message on the message in perfect faith he says this and this has been as I said I'm not going to give you anything new you haven't heard but God is and I had administered here a while back on a Wednesday in desperation there well actually it's it's in uh to become totally submitted to the Lord uh uh in not desperation is the word I want to use but but anyway I I believe you understand but now he says in perfect faith he says and now we become anointed with that same spirit anointed messiahs messiahs of the last day to shine forth the resurrection of Jesus Christ to show that he is not dead but in the form of the Holy Ghost he's in his people moving among his bride with a love affair to her pouring out into her himself. They are be sounds like sounds like it's a it's a union and we know that we've entered into a a spiritual invisible union. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we must come into that in order to take a rapture. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And so this is the marriage we're talking about. It's an invisible union, a spiritual union. We know that we've got to come to a wedding supper and but only those that are in union with him will be there. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I'm talking about in union now. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, and that and that comes from being born again. When you are born again, immediately you're raptured up and seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus spiritually. Amen. Then you grow. You have to grow. And God's given us everything we need. In fact, the prophet said this. He said here, he said, "The bridegroom don't leave out nothing. He's got the ring. He's got the ring." And and the prophet even said, "It's already put on your finger." Unmmerited grace. He said he put the ring upon your fa your finger. A ring of unmmerited grace. And he said the bridegroom don't leave nothing out. He's got the ring. He's got the identification which is the marriage certificate. We know that the book being opened that book was a marriage certificate. the ident got the identification and he's got the robe. She's she's she's uh the robe she wears her clothing all all provided where it's already provided for &gt;&gt; the book's opened. Amen. Without the opening of the book, the blood sacrifice would be nothing. I want to minister on that here just whenever I can and maybe take three or four services. But the purpose of Calvary because you remember in the scripture I why I'm saying this I'm way ahead of myself but anyway the the purpose of Calvary if that book wasn't opened all creation's lost. &gt;&gt; And he's already paid the price of redemption but he paid the price of redemption for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we want to and so he's he's provided everything we need even given us an open book and that she eats and becomes that book living. Amen. Because you you are what you eat. &gt;&gt; You become what you eat. So it depends on what you're feeding on. You're going to become that book. Amen. And that book has everything you need to make a rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember John was said, "Give me the book." Said, "Take it." &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just going to drop this side in. But but you remember, no man was worthy to even look at it. &gt;&gt; No man was even worthy to take it. No man could even open it. But the lamb stepped forth. Actually, the lion stepped forth in the form of a lamb, the one that did give his life for us and then opened this book. Now, that book that has been opened, I'm I'm ahead of myself and I'm going to let go and just let God have his way. What was once God's great secret, great mysterious secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believer. That is the body of Christ. What was once what was God's once great secret in his mind, that was a sealed secret. before the foundation of the world is now made manifested. He said, "Think of it." Amen. All right. So, there was a secret. He couldn't let out. John was forbidden to write it. And brother Bram said, "Notice those seven thunders. Those seven thunders, we don't know what they are, but we need to know." And he said, "He what we need to know." And he said, "It'll take a prophet to get the revelation." Now I don't be afraid of me saying seven thunders because there's a great there's a great message in this. In fact, it's the message of the seventh angel. So we don't want to belittle seven thunders. Amen. Because it's a message of the of the angel, the messenger. And that message that message in itself, there's been no there's been nothing to no revival for the bride yet. Brother Bram said that in the seals. I don't know why I'm saying this, but I but I'm saying it this way. I didn't claim to say this, but because I wanted to keep it later, but but but he said, but one year later, just about one year later, he said nothing to awake the bride. He said, "It'll take these seven thunders to wake her up." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. Then he said just almost a year later, just just 7:26 of 64, he preached a message recognizing your day in this message. And he said, "What they haven't recognized, they feel the pull of the hour, but what they haven't recognized is the awakening of the bride." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, she's been awakened. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it took that book open to awaken her. And so, the mystery of that book is who you are. Amen. That's who I am. It was open to the bride because without that being open, there would be no rapture. There would be no catching away. Amen. But we are being caught away secretly to be caught away meet him in the air. But there has to be a there is a secret gather catching away. So anyway getting back to this perfect faith. So but in the form of the Holy Ghost he's in his people moving among his bride with a love affair to her pouring out into her himself. Watch they are becoming one for the wedding supper. So there's an invisible union taking place here. It's not a public show. That's right. &gt;&gt; In fact, only she knows it. And we'll we'll come into that. It's hard for me not to preach what's in my heart from later on. But anyway, so the head has been revealed and he's come back with eternal life and the body must follow that because it's husband and wife again. Amen. As long as you're pregnantated with that same word, which is his body, you took his body. Become in him. When you took the word, you become pregnantated in him. What are you bearing? You're bearing children. And what is that child? That's that body you're looking to meet. Amen. It's being bore. Amen. You're carrying his life. Amen. Why? Why? Why? Because we always were meant to carry life. Yeah, &gt;&gt; as a son of God, it would have to be the seed in me to be quickened. That gene of life was put in me to be quickened and therefore manifest in flesh, showing, identifying I was his son. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, it's not something you do. It's something he's already done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We just sang about that. He's already healed me. He's already We have a double cure. You remember the man that come and said, "I have faith, Lord, to see my son healed." You have faith? He said, "Lord, help my unbelief." Amen. &gt;&gt; But what about the other? What about the double cure? There's not only zoo healing, but there's zoo salvation &gt;&gt; by the same faith. Amen. If thou can't believe. Amen. All right. So, so the great secret is always blinded the wisdom of the world. They can't get it. They just don't understand. Satan don't understand it. None of the rest of them understand it. But just those who are predestinated understand how God and Christ are one. See, God is Christ. You that's why the bride and Christ are one. They're no longer twain. All right. So, so coming back to this now. So, he's pouring himself into her. All right. Now, the first thing the prophet did when he opened the the seals, what was the first thing he did? He said, "My first," He said, "my first line of duty coming into a new assembly and was to marry a couple back in the back room." I wonder if it could be the inside of the inside room. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In the back room. &gt;&gt; All right. He married a couple and the opening of the seals was uniting uniting the bride and the groom together. Brother Bram said, "I've seen great miracles done, mighty mighty things." But he said when he was on the seventh seal, he said, "This is beyond that." &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's something that nobody but the bride can see. It's releasing the bride. We believe in signs and wonders. The spirit can anoint the spirit can anoint the devil. &gt;&gt; Oh, he said, "No, no, no, brother David. Oh, yeah. The Holy Spirit can anoint." He did Judas, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he went out and worked signs and wonders. And we all believe in signs and wonders. That's why we've got to be careful about what we say to the anointing. &gt;&gt; Even though they may not go out and live the word, and they can't live the word, but they can still be anointed, &gt;&gt; by the spirit of God, &gt;&gt; and do signs and wonders and shout and and even prophesy and be the truth. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But that's not the that's not the evidence. Not even love is the evidence. Did you know that? The prophet said, "I used to believe it was." And you can do all those things, have knowledge, and all of that. and still not have charity. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Charity is God himself. &gt;&gt; You can have all that and still not You can be anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit in your spirit because the spirit controls the body. &gt;&gt; You can be anointed that, but that seed gene is not in the soul. And that's where the evidence is, is that it's the revealing of that that lives itself out. Amen. And that proves whether that genuine love's there or not, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because you're able to hear and receive the word for the season. &gt;&gt; You're going to line up with the word because God's in you and that word and you are the word. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; The Jesus said, "Heavens and earth pass away, but my word shall never pass away." &gt;&gt; And he said, "And if you be that word, how you going to pass away? You can't pass away. The word of God will not return void. &gt;&gt; So when you're that word and you are the word, the bride is the word. She she without that open book, she would never realize her position. She's been positionally placed. And and because she becomes the mystery revealed, the full the full mystery, the final mystery and the full mystery of Jesus Christ is his body, the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So it completes it and we move into a body. Without that, without that spiritual revelation, there'd be no rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Without that in you now, &gt;&gt; see, without recognizing the turning of the corner, &gt;&gt; without recognizing what God has done, he's turned a corner. We're into the bride age. And and what Pentecost made way for, we're in what made way for, we're fulfilling. And that made way for the Holy Ghost himself to come right down in perfection back to the word again. And that's what we are. That's where we are. Amen. So, so we see in first Corinthians, he that's joined unto the Lord is one spirit. And the prophet said, the real you is that spirit of God in you. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So that's who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can't pump that up. You can't work that up. It's not a pumping up and working up. And I'm coming to this because I said the key is complete submission &gt;&gt; to one head. And I have a message I want to preach and it'll have to be on something other than a Wednesday, but I want to call it one head. All right? So, so we can we can see that. Now, what is that word bride? Any wife is a part of her husband. Therefore, we must be that word bride. What is that word bride? the manifestation of this hour. She's a living attribute of God, a living oracle of God, living word of God. &gt;&gt; She is the word living. &gt;&gt; Amen. She is the word living. Op living. And she's operative living. Amen. She is the word. You can't get her off of that word because she is the word, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. She is the very thought of God which was his eternal thought expressed in word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So see everything Paul preached Paul preached things that they knew nothing about. He said you can't even receive it yet because you're still in milk. But we today &gt;&gt; that was hidden in that word has been open to us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we see then our position we've been positionally placed is that word. All right. So so what is it? The revelation of Jesus Christ. Here we see the manifestation of this hour. That's the bride. A living orc, a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living. What is the promised word for the hour? He said he would have a bride. That was his heart purpose. The Bible said the mystery according to the he purposed in himself that mystery. That's his heart purpose. The very heart purpose of God was to have a bride according to his ch by his choosing. Amen. And so we see the word he always fulfills the scripture and that bride will be loyal to her husband and nothing nobody he said his word calls for a total separation from unbelief. &gt;&gt; Nobody is going to stand in the way between the unity of the bride and the groom. &gt;&gt; And our marriage ought to represent that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Our marriage ought to represent what he and his bride represent. And there ought to be nothing to separate you from your husband or you husband from your wife. Not even children. Because if you do, you're living contrary to the word. Amen. We'll get into this right here this morning, this evening. All right. So, the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour, not what he was in another hour. We're talking about the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour. Not what he was in another hour, but what he was now. The Bible expresses what he was is now. What he ever he was, the revelation of Jesus Christ. He can't change what he was. He's going to be expressed what he was, but he's in another garment. He's in another form. Not another person, another form. &gt;&gt; And that form is bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, we see here the Bible expresses and this revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour, he said it's growing in the bride to the full stature. What is the full stature? Christ. God and Christ are not divided. They're the same person. Me and my wife are two separate people, but not the bride and God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; They're the same person. &gt;&gt; It's just himself in another form. Just what Eve was. She was the revelation of Adam. She was Mrs. Adam. Amen. She was the hidden mystery of Adam. &gt;&gt; Is that right? So there's got to be an open book. There's got He's got to take that book today and reveal these things. The full revelation of Jesus Christ comes out. Amen. And we're here to be we're being caught up by that. Caught away. This is not Everybody doesn't There's nobody else knows we're being caught away but the bride. &gt;&gt; That's right. I don't care. The cousins, you know, tried to say to that little girl after she met him personally, alone and personally. And when he revealed his purpose of being there, I'm looking for a wife. Would you marry me? And she said, "Yes, that was a vow." &gt;&gt; And the vow is what marries you. &gt;&gt; And she made that vow. And he said, "I'll be back for you." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But I've given you everything you need to get ready. But she went through struggles and trials and persecutions and and and and the further we go in this hour, it's going to wrap around the same way the prophet did. He said, "Just think. I have one open door in Phoenix." &gt;&gt; But God spoke back and said, "What is that to you? &gt;&gt; Follow me." &gt;&gt; And there's you be the bride the same way. He said, "Brother Brandham said, the things are happening and unveiling so fast, I can't keep up with it." I told my wife the other day, "These me these things are happening so quick, I can't get enough. It's opening so fast. I can write notes. I might as well quit writing notes because I can't write it down enough. It's opening so quickly." Well, it's coming right along with what he said. And remember, the first one had to come maturity. The word came to his prophet. There had to be a maturity showed forth and that was waved over the rest of them that they would come. Well, Jesus Christ doesn't change. He doesn't change his nature. doesn't change his way. You can expect to be be rebuked if you're living this word, preaching the truth of the hour. You're expected to be questioned. Not you're not going to be popular. &gt;&gt; You're not even going to. And I don't care about being popular, but I'm just telling you what's going to happen. But we better be sure and know that we know him &gt;&gt; because there's going to look things that can look real reasonable and real very very right and very reasonable that we should yield to because this one said it and they're close friends. They're good people. But we better be careful that we don't turn around and leave that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember those two spirits will be really close. They're both anointed, two spirits, but both anointed by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right. Because there's one spirit that's of the devil &gt;&gt; and the other spirits of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Those two spirits, one's Satan and one isn't. Is that right? All right. They can be so close together because they're both anointed. The bride's anointed. We know that. We believe in the anointing. The anointing was sent for one thing though. That's to quicken the seed gene that he put in your soul. &gt;&gt; You know, it wasn't until after the seals opened that brother Brandham said anything about gene. A gene gene of God. That's right. But now he opened it up. See, now we're coming. Why? Because the book But the book's been opened. It was in a three-fold manner. First he come then he then he come into his son to give redemption. Then he come from his son into his people and now preparing the people for the for Eden. Amen. It's perfect. Amen. So here we are. Where are we standing? And we're 60 years beyond he in 1212. 1212 and 12 days later the prophet left. 1212 he preached communion. 65 and here we are 60 years. We just passed 1212. 312s there. Amen. 12 days later he went in a car accident. Those things don't happen by chance. In fact, there's nothing for you as a as a bride, born again bride. There's nothing can happen by chance. &gt;&gt; God has ordered it. God has ordained it. Now, we're coming into this. I want to read something here because I know my time is very limited tonight. I want to read brother Brandham. He had two he made two wedding ceremonies and he and they recorded both of them. But I'm going to read a wedding ceremony here to you and I want you to look at it not only between you and your husband which is true because brother bre because remember Paul took the husband and the wife and used it representing the bride and the groom. Ephesians 5. All right. So he was typing it and and the marriage the marriage between a husband and wife ought to type that scripturally. Amen. Ought to be a a natural type. &gt;&gt; If your life isn't being lived that way, there's something wrong. So line up with the word. All right. Now, so we come back to here and I'm going to read this and keep in mind that this is not only between a husband and wife, but this between you and the Christ because this is what this is what it is. But duly believing you have considered this solemn obligation you are about to assume and that you have you have prepared to enter upon the same reverently, discreetly, soberly in the fear of God. I shall propose to you the marriage covenant. You will witness the same as you join your right hands together. Will you have this woman, speaking to the man, will you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife to live together in this holy state of matrimony? Do you promise to love and honor? Love her, honor her, cherish her, and support her in sickness and health, riches or poverty, and will forsake all others as long as you both live? The groom answers, "I will." &gt;&gt; Our bridegroom has answered, &gt;&gt; "I will." &gt;&gt; All right. Now, will you have, speaking to the woman, speaking to the lady, will you have this man to be your lawful wedded husband to live together in this holy state of matrimony? Do you promise to love him, honor him, and cherish him and support him in sickness or health, riches or poverty, and cleave thee only unto him as long as you both live? The bride answers, I will. &gt;&gt; Now, you've made a vow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What man, what God joins together, let no man put us under. Can you imagine something coming in between? Brother Brandon brought this many many times. You cannot mix your union with him. Mix it with other things. It's not a mix. You either submitted completely to him or you aren't submitted to him in everything. You must give him headship. He has the headship. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we look at the word submission. Let's look at this just a minute. Submission is the act or fact of accepting or yielding to a superior force or to the will or or authority of another person. Submit means to yield, resign, or surrender to the power, will or authority of another. And I'm going to stop right there because I'm going to read Ephesians just a minute here. But let's go back here just and we so we see here that you will cleave. He will cleave has no other. She will have no other. Nothing can come between you. Amen. If it does, if it tries to separate you or separate you and God, it's another spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's the same thing between a man and woman. She's commanded to submit herself to her husband, and the husband is commanded to keep himself only to her and to love her and cherish her. &gt;&gt; Women say, "Well, what if he doesn't believe the way I do? What if this? What if that?" As long as he doesn't tell you to go contrary to that word, you are to surrender yourself to him and serve him, &gt;&gt; whether you like him or don't. Whether you like his actions or don't, that's what I'm talking about. Unless he tells you, he may be an outright unbeliever and something then tells you to separate from him. That is of the devil. Unless he calls you to make you to do things contrary to the word, won't let you read the word, hear the word, makes you dress something contrary to the word, then the Lord is your head over him. But until that time, you're not to keep yourself from him. You're to give yourself to him and let nothing come between you. I don't care what it is. If it's job, if it's family, if it's children, I don't care what it is. Nothing can come between you and your wife or your husband. &gt;&gt; Nothing. And if it does, then Satan's using that to get you off of what he's told you to do in the word. Pretty strong, isn't it? But I wasn't sent to make it simple or easy. I mean, my I'm I'm speaking before our pastor. I have to do what I'm called to do. And I know you know that if it leaves the word, then I'm then I'm have then you have a right to rebuke me if it leaves this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Okay. Then we must submit ourselves to the word. This word is your husband, bride. Isaiah 54:5 said, "God is your husband." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. I'm good. I'm, you know, I'm kind of glad this is not a Wednesday night. All right. Now, oh, he said, "The sweetness of wedlock. A man and a woman has been joined together to face life journey." in its ups and downs. Therefore, they are no more twain, but one flesh, what therefore God had joined together. Let not man put us under. So, we read that wedding ceremony. Let's let's go over here and I want to I want to read another scripture just before I read here. What I want to get into in in Ephesians. Ephesians 5 verse 22 starting with verse 22. Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord. As unto the Lord. Would you let something If you let something get you between you and the Lord, even if it's your own thinking, reasoning, feelings, come between you and God, you're flirting with the devil. Amen. You can't let anything come between you and the word. You say, "Well, aren't we able to?" Yeah, you'll have mistakes, but one thing about the Holy Ghost, he'll show you it's wrong &gt;&gt; and you'll make correction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. Then then we must come under the headship of the word in everything. &gt;&gt; That's why God calls for a total separation from unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Anything prophesy, go to the message. Go back in what he said. Anything or anyone or anything that comes between you and God, Amen. You're to separate from that unbelief. All right. He said now, so reading on, he said verse 23, for the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church. That's the bride. That's the wife. He is the savior of the body. Therefore, as the church is submitted unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it. Now, husbands, here's what you do. You die to yourself. Let go of self. Don't let your your Don't let anything come between you and your wife. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You must keep that union open, that communion open. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the wife listen remember I read I read something here just when I was while brother was gone and I read back. He said and we have it I have it here tonight. And the question is why can't I surrender to the Holy Spirit? And brother Bram said, he said, "Do I have a devil?" A woman was asking, asking, "Why can't I surrender to Christ?" I may read that again tonight, Lord willing, if I can before I leave here because he she he said it very clear. Amen. So, so the headship and the body. Okay, I won't I won't go there yet. Let's keep reading. Husbands, love your wives even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it. What did he say to do? Honor your wife as a weaker vessel. Giving honor to your wife as a weaker vessel. You say, "What do you mean by that?" Because she was deceived in the beginning, the woman. And she's a weaker vessel. But you being a stronger vessel, you don't just run her down. She's more able to make mistakes and failures. But you need to give yourself for her, right? And you ought to be respected. If you're not a respect, I and I and I just come right back. I've been through this too many times. I've heard wives come up, well, I'm more spiritual than my husband or well, this or that, or well, he he he doesn't treat me right. In what way? If he tells you to do something that's not as off the word, see, then the Lord is your husband ahead of him. But if he doesn't, you may not like the way he does. You may not like his decisions, but you need to pray for your husband and obey him and serve him. These are hard words, aren't they? Hard to swallow, but it's the truth. Okay. Now that he that he now it's the same as Christ. He may remember Paul's bringing this down through husband and wife showing the love between the the the Christ and his bride. That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish. Listen. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. &gt;&gt; Who are you in his eyes? Himself. &gt;&gt; You had your way. You had your your time. You had your house. You've had your property. You had your money and everything. But now you're married. Now you have a head and you submit yourself to that head. Amen. In everything, wives, what is submit? To yield, resign, or surrender to the power, will or authority of another. Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands. Ephesians 5. To be subject, that means to be subject to to acquisense in the authority in in the authority of him to thy to acquiscent to the to thy husband's will to be submissive to yield without murmuring. Amen. That's submission. What good is it going to do when you know God has control of you and you surrender? And I'm coming to that right now. I want to finish with that. When you surrender to him, give him total control. Amen. See, you think, well, I can't give my husband total. Why can't you? The Bible said you should. Well, I can't. Then you haven't submitted yourself as the word said. You're not giving the word headship. Why don't you do that and watch what God does? &gt;&gt; That's right. Watch what God does. He'll honor that. Amen. Exactly what he'll do. I've had him say, "I just can't." You know, he this I said, "Just serve him. You're to serve him. You're not to withhold yourself from him. You're to serve him." Amen. And if something comes between you and your husband and serving, it's not God doing it. And you need to you need to just lay it right down and say, "This is what I believe. Nothing going to come between me and my husband. We're living together. We're going to continue to live together." Now, listen, it's just us. We're family here tonight. We ought to speak to family just like that. And it shouldn't offend anybody because I'm bringing to you the word. If the word offends you, you've got a problem. We all have a problem. I have a problem. If the word offend me, and we're going to preach the truth, and I'm going to tell you right now, the truth will offend people. &gt;&gt; But I'm not out here to offend them purposely, but to bring the truth. Listen, this bride has the truth, and she will prophesy. She's not afraid to speak it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, somebody might think this and might think that. Then you're putting what they think between you and God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Boy, that was good. &gt;&gt; That's good for all of us. You can't let anything come between. &gt;&gt; When God joined you two together, he didn't expect anything to come between. And if it come between you need to take authority over it and say you're not going to do it. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now let me see how I can quickly Okay. Let's finish this. 29. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth it and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church. You remember how that old drunk come in? He said, "I know somebody that won't see I know somebody that love me. I remember he come like drink like he drank and threw the eggs on the floor and everything else." And she just kept saying, "Oh, must Jesus bear the cross alone?" She still served her husband. Even though he was a drunk, he still served her husband. Listen, I could tell you story after story and I know what I'm talking about by experience. If you'll just be you'll serve him. I don't care if he's the darkest sinner. He doesn't believe what you believe. Amen. You still serve him. That's right. You still serve him. He I don't agree with what he does. Who would you hear that from? What makes you disagree with what he's doing? &gt;&gt; Where are you getting your inspiration from? &gt;&gt; That would even come between you and your husband or husband and wife whichever it is anything. Okay. So there's a submission. I just gave you the definition of submission. So let no man put us under. Okay. Now in Isaiah 22:22, I want to go to the house key of the house of David. And this is Isaiah 22:22. And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder. So he shall open and none shall shut. and he shall shut and none shall open. And the Bible said, continue reading here in Ephesians, he said, "For every, for we are members of his body, of his flesh." Paul's speaking of the the bride. We are members of Christ's body, of his flesh, and of his bones. For this cause, you know what the bride is? The bride is the flesh and bones of Christ. Did you know that? That's the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. She is the flesh and bones. We are He said like he said we are the flesh and bones of Christ. That is his bride. That's a quote. That is his bride. Okay. So Paul's saying, "For we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife, and they too shall be one flesh." This is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So where's the reflection of this? What did Paul use? What about the body of Christ? What did he use to represent the body member members of the body? 1 Corinthians 12. He used the flesh physical body. Every part had their part to play. But they're all united to one head. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. See? So, so here we go. Now, let's go back here to this key of David. Let's read it out of out of I want to read it out of Revelations 3:7, too, because this is this is where Brother Bram speaks of it in the church age book. And this comes this is this is the scripture he's referring to. Revelations 3:7. And he said unto the angel of the church in Philadelphia, write these things saith he that is holy. He that is true. He that hath the key of David. He that openeth and no man shutth and shutth and no man openeth. Now there was an open door here at the end of that age. Amen. And that was that was and that was followed up. God opened the door of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the restoration of the gifts. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? Yeah. &gt;&gt; But we realize and brother Brandham said on the message on on the on the on the on his things that are to be he said the real gift he said you can be baptized with the Holy Ghost and we all need to be baptized with the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; because without the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's no birth &gt;&gt; because but the Holy Ghost baptism was sent to quicken the seed and that was the open door here. There's an open door made for you. &gt;&gt; That was the beginning of the Leoian age. The message of the seventh angel, message of the opening of the seals came at the end of the seventh age. &gt;&gt; So there was there was though so he made a way and brother Brandham said we can't preach the we don't the the I won't well I won't go there because I want to I want to go into another message on that. So anyway, so we see then that it made way for the Holy Ghost himself. Remember Pentecost was still under reformation. The message of the seventh angel, opening of the seals, the third pull is the eagle. Amen. See, because this this secret had to be known. So I don't want to go any further than that because I want to teach the point here. But going back to the house of David, he said this is what the prophet said about this. So I he said the key is laid on his shoulder. So he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open. Other words, he has the headship. The spirit uses this Old Testament reference concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his ministry in the church. What the key of David signified at that time is mere shadow which is now fulfilled in Jesus standing in the midst of the lampstands. It has to do with the our Lord after his resurrection and not his earthly pilgrimage. But what does the key signify? The answer to that is in the position of the key. All right. It's not in his hand. It's not worn around his neck. is not placed in the hands of other men or the verse would could not be saying that he alone has the use of that key &gt;&gt; for he alone opens and shuts and no man has that right but Jesus himself isn't that right but where is the key it is on his shoulder but what does shoulder have to do with it so we could go to read Isaiah 9:6 the government shall be upon his shoulder shoulder. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is so see so the government I I you could read Isaiah 9:6. I won't take time with that tonight. But the government shall be upon the government. &gt;&gt; Shall be upon his shoulder. &gt;&gt; But what does this mean? The answer, the phrase the government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the east. So now we see that the government upon the shoulder comes from a wedding ceremony and we've had a wedding ceremony. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; I could go back to par proving his word. You know the quote. He said the marriage is now and the rapture is going to the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; I could go to a lot more in that. But the but the ministry of the son of man himself unites the two together. God steps down in flesh and we saw him do it. Amen. And it caught our attention to what the voice that followed the second pull. All right. Now, so we know the third pull is the opening of that mystery in you. It's the opening of the book. It's the opening of the word. Okay. Now so not to save time here so the so it's from the comes in the wedding ceremony of the east when the bride has been committed to the groom that word committed is he is meaning that he she's given herself over completely in the face of witnesses and declaring I'm his wife that's being committed &gt;&gt; okay so she has taken that vow she promised that he she would be faithful to him and him only. Okay. Then what's happening here? So she takes when the bride has been committed to the groom, she takes off. Now there was something here. Give me just a minute. Let me look here. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I was going to read. Oh yeah. Okay. Let me just Well, I won't interject that yet. If I have time, I will. Okay. Now, when she's committed to the groom, she takes off her veil. Now, this is a powerful thing here. Don't take it lightly because this is very important. When the bride has been committed to the groom, she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulders. signifying that not only is she under his dominion, she has transferred her rights to him, that he is the head. Now, she come into that marriage with a lot of rights, but when she marries, she turns those rights to her husband. She comes under his authority. If you don't believe then then why did you marry him and why did you marry her if you won't keep your vow? Amen. That goes with every bit of us. I mean brother sister happening everywhere even among the message. Amen. In fact where the two come so close you can't it's unless you have the Holy Ghost you wouldn't be able to discern. They would deceive you, those two spirits, because why? They're both anointed, can be anointed with the same Holy Ghost. But one will bring the word for the season where the other can't see it. But both being anointed by the same Holy Ghost, what are you going to stay with? See how close those two can come. Amen. We are to stay with this word. I here again. It doesn't matter how nice how the person is. They've been friends for years. I don't know what it is, but you are to stay with that word. His perfect will is his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many now there many that have the word, but they have no oil. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But those that have the word have the oil. Right? &gt;&gt; And the word becomes a living word. It becomes the thought underneath that word &gt;&gt; manifested. &gt;&gt; Everybody has the rema. Everybody claims to believe it. Foolish virgin claimed they had the lamp but they didn't have oil in their vessel. &gt;&gt; But the but the wise virgin had oil in their vessel &gt;&gt; with their lamp or their lamp with oil in their vessel. &gt;&gt; There's the only difference. Right. &gt;&gt; Both sanctified people. &gt;&gt; We're coming down very close here. &gt;&gt; Where don't you turn? The enemy going to make it look very easy to make a turn here. But you but the Holy Ghost in you is the only one that's going to zone. Otherwise, you're going to yield back to what somebody else said. You're going to yield back to your own reasoning and your own thinking of it. And there's where you go off the line. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. All right. So, watch. Laying that over her veil. Watch. You've got to lay your veil on his shoulders. Brother, sister, bride, me, you. It ought to be a laying of her veil on his shoulders and leave it there. &gt;&gt; Amen. because you're signifying that not only is she under that she's under his domain dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also that he bears the responsibility. Okay, husbands, you bear the responsibility. You're going to answer for what you do to that wife. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's you're going to answer for that. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. Yeah. &gt;&gt; She'll never answer for you, but you will answer. She'll answer for her own affairs. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't correct her and bring her back to the word and she refuses to listen to correction, she will answer for it because you are husband. Me, every man in here that's married is a husbandman to his home. And we ought to be very careful. But we ought to be watchmen. Amen. A husbandman is the care you. Our brother Paul here is a husbandman. He controls a farm. You plant. You you reap. You're the planter. You're the husbandman of that of that whole field or fields. Amen. &gt;&gt; So is a husband &gt;&gt; of over his home, over his family. And when the wife tries to raise up and take authority over that, there's another spirit. And the Bible said it's a Catholic spirit. It's a dominating female spirit that wants to dominate. And brother Bram said, "Any real woman will want to be under the authority of the man." My go back to thyroid age and see what he said. I'm not saying anybody here has that spirit. I'm saying that's what's trying to anoint me, you, or anybody. And we face it every day. Don't worry. That devil tries to come in in any way he can to try to upset your complete your complete submission and your complete giving over to that word every day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's going to battle you. You're going to face struggles. You're going to face trials. You're going to face people that don't like you. They're going to face people that even message believers say, "And listen, those cousins, don't think for a minute that that little woman down there, that little washer woman that said yes to marry that boy." &gt;&gt; Amen. If they didn't say, "Listen, now you know better. Those seals aren't open, that seven seals not open." What makes you think it's open? &gt;&gt; Because he's unveiled himself to me. That's how I know it's open. and his unveiling to me has brought me to my position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right. That's where it lays right there. Are we going to come under the headship of the word? Are we going to come under the headship of oursel? &gt;&gt; Remember what I said. You lift up yourself. Quit. Don't try to lift up the idol of yourself. You lift up yourself, it's an idol. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lean not to your own understanding, but in all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy path. &gt;&gt; Put him first. He'll take care of the rest of it. Put the word first. Put prayer first. Give time for the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. I'm telling, you may not like the way I preach it, but I'm not responsible for whether you like it or not. I'm responsible for telling it. Amen. I may be an old German. I may be a German shepherd. I don't know. But I'm a German and I may have to be German. But God made me that way. And I'm going to lay out the word because I love you and I don't despise any of you. I'm not against any of you. I want you to see line up with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I know that's my pastor's heart. That's our pastor's soul. Line up with the word. He'd been preaching it. He preached Sunday. Line up with the word. &gt;&gt; Listen, there's going to be things come up be very reason going to twick your reasoning. Be careful. &gt;&gt; The devil's a slicker. But you better depend on that Holy Ghost in you. You better lay your veil on his shoulders. &gt;&gt; This is what the Holy Spirit's driving us to right here. lay the veil on his shoulders. &gt;&gt; The key is complete submission. That's the key to going in a rapture is you've got to lay your veil on that shoulders and give him the right that's due him. Give him the responsibility that he wants to take. Watch what he says now close. He said watch. He said he said he gives she gives she transfers has transferred her rights to him that he is the head also that he bears the responsibility and the care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility but him &gt;&gt; and that beloved is the key of David &gt;&gt; Amen Amen. &gt;&gt; He answers it right there. There is your key. &gt;&gt; In the home, who gives the right to her husband? The wife. &gt;&gt; She can say yes or no. Is that right? I'm not talking just sexually. I'm talking about the right to her husband. If she doesn't give him that right, he can't force himself on her. Amen. And if a wife's not refu if the wife refuses to submit to her husband, then he might as well go live a private life. Amen. If the husband abuses the wife and she can't live and won't let her go to church, won't let him see. And and brother Brandham said, if she leaves or if he leaves, don't you go out and remarry. Don't you go out and do anything. You just go out and serve the Lord the best you can and let him take care of it. You've got to just yield yourself and come under the headship of the word. If you won't do that, there's another spirit in you. You're not discerning the the words of God here. &gt;&gt; Okay? So he said, so he that beloved is the key of David. God being sovereign, he fornewed by divine decree exactly who would be his bride. He chose her. She did not choose him. He called her. She did not come on her own and he died for her. He washed her in his own blood. He paid the price for her. She belongs to him and to him alone. &gt;&gt; She is wholly committed. She has vowed that she would be faithful to him alone. &gt;&gt; All right. She is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation. And he accepts the obligation. Thanks be to God. I'm so glad that he's accepted the obligation. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can rest in that. &gt;&gt; You can yield, completely yield. You may not understand how he's leading. You may not understand how he's doing it, but your trust is in him. And he said he would keep those in perfect peace who who kept their mind centered on him because they trusted in him. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Love is trust. Amen. And he may he may do he may brother sister the husband may do things that you say I don't agree with that I do agree with that whether you agree with it or not as long as it's not leading it off the word then serve him. &gt;&gt; We don't understand I understand everything. We're not even meant to understand the way the shepherd leads us or way my our husband leads us. the word leads us. It's not my business to know that I trust him. I've given myself to him and I'm resting. No matter what state I'm in, where I'm at, I can therewith be content because he's leading me. &gt;&gt; I don't have to figure out how he's doing it, he's doing it. &gt;&gt; I've laid my veil on his shoulders. And for you to do that as a as a wife serves her husband, Brother Bam said she is serving God. &gt;&gt; That's pretty. You've got a husband, you serve him. God looks at it as his your service and you have a ministry. And what's keeping you out of your ministry then? You have a ministry that's just as great as a prophet or apostle or any other five-fold ministry. Your ministry is that important. Every day you serve your husband. You take care of him. You you take care of his clothes. You you take care of the house under the headship of your husband. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother David, you're just back in the old times. No, I'm not. This is beyond your natural way of thinking and being a ruler. This is coming down to different. This is a revelation, and I'm trying to bring you that revelation right here. And our marriages ought to reflect this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Spiritually, not. It's not, "Well, bless God. I'll bear that stick and pound her over the head." No, no, no. That's not even scriptural. You husband try to do that. You're out of your place. &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. Where's the harmony? And don't tell me you don't affect this church. When your family is out of cater, you are affecting the church. &gt;&gt; Every every if it's a healthy family, it could be a healthy church depending on the health of the family. You want to see moving of God, then get your family in order. Get your children in order. &gt;&gt; That's right. put the you you you you say I don't well they I can't love is corrective then when they're doing things and you let them just go out there and want brother sister you ought to be have you ought to be giving yourself for your children training them training them training them not not to go off the train them to the word bring your homes under the word amen They're going to grow up. They're gonna grow up being what you that you've influenced them to be. Time's up. What is it? Full surrender to God. That's what it takes. A complete surrender. God wants a surrender. How can you show How can God show you realities before you surrender yourself to him? You've got to surrender. To make a complete surrender, we cannot use one ability, human ability. You say, "I got the ability to do it." God doesn't need it. He needs you to submit your ability and let go of it and let God do with it. &gt;&gt; Not you coming up thinking, "I've got the ability. I've been trained to do this." Brother Brham said, "God doesn't need it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've got to master, if we ever master anything, we ought to master the very thought of human ability. Same goes with husband. Same goes with wife. Amen. Put it in God's hands. Rely on God and keep his word and do what the word said for you to do and break this influence that's causing you to run the other way. Maybe I won't get the chance to preach again here, but you're going to hear it anyway. Amen. You've got to surrender to him both soul, body, and spirit. Everything you are has to be surrendered to God in order that he can work his will in you. &gt;&gt; We're always trying to put our part in something we know. You know that you want to do it. It's not what he asked you to do. He said surrender. &gt;&gt; In him is perfect fulfillment. Remember, David was a king of Israel. David had a kingdom. And watch what he says. In him is perfect fulfillment. In him, though we once esteemed him not, now we love him with joy unspeakable and full of glory. In the midst of the church, he stands and we will sing his praise. For he is a mighty conqueror is head over. He the mighty conqueror is head over the church which is his bride. He bought her. He owns her. She is his and his alone. And he cares for her. He is our king and we are his kingdom, his eternal possession. &gt;&gt; That ought to settle it. God's ways are perfect. &gt;&gt; And when you've laid your veil on his shoulders, your way will be perfect. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how I feel or what I think about it. &gt;&gt; It's what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I could go on a lot more here. You can't surrender to Jesus. Why? What's the matter? Question. Brother Brand, I'm answering a question. If you are a woman, don't you have to surrender to your husband to be a wife? Surrender all you are. A little lady when you were married, virtuous, fought all your life to stay virtuous. But one day you found a man that you loved, you were his completely completely. The things that you fought against all your life and tried to live clean and clear and virtuous, now you surrender every bit of it to one man. Is that right? You put yourself completely in his hands. You are his. All that you have stood for in decency and moral and everything like that. Now you turn it over to a man because you surrender yourself to the man. Can you can't you do the same thing to Jesus Christ? Just surrender yourself that way. All that I am, all my mind, all my thoughts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Certainly. &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't think you're possessed of an evil spirit. I think the evil spirit anoints you with them kind of thoughts, trying to make you think that you cannot surrender yourself to that man or in this case to God." Amen. Let me show you something. Why would you want to surrender to him? Now, there's a question, isn't it? What's in your heart? Do you want to or don't you want to? But she in this case, the prophet seeing I want to, he said, why would you want to surrender him? Because there's something out there calling you to surrender. It's a very good sign that you ought to surrender yourself. Now all you do, brother, sister, might be a young person, old, whatever it is, you just can't find yourselves that completely surrender. Just give yourself over. If your husband says, "We need to do it this way," then if you don't like what he made the decision, they'll go pray for him. Don't go talking about him and downing him in other people's eyes. And same way with the husband. Don't you go out there and try to down your wife and talk against her and quit your listening to other voices and get yourself united back together. Anything that'll separate that. The same thing I've taken spiritual and natural side here both. Anything that'll separate you from that is not of God. Amen. Amen. I'll be honest with you. I don't I don't I don't practice my sermons. I stand up here depending on God to tell it as it should be through me. &gt;&gt; And I absolutely have laid this veil, all I know, upon his shoulders. If you don't like what you heard tonight, pray for me because I'm certainly praying for all of you. Every bit of you. And don't think anybody's against you. I love you. We love you. We're not against anybody. We want the people. If you've got Christ in your heart, I don't care what it is. You want them saved. You want them delivered and line up with this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that's your escape. That's your deliverance right there is to lay your veil on his shoulders and give him the responsibility to do him and quit complaining how he made you &gt;&gt; and give everything you are to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let him do what he wants to do and you do it. You serve him. You give yourself to him natural physic natural spiritually. You give yourself to him. Commit it to the Lord and let God do the work. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can't believe that, then you can't believe you're not submitting yourself in the hands of God like you should be and giving him the right to do what he wants. My my my. Well, amen, brother David. I knocked this cross, didn't I? I don't know if that's straight. Looks like it. Anyway, Lord bless you. Let's stand. I'll stop. I wonder today when God leads us to a life of completely complete surrender and service to him. I wonder if our spirits sometimes don't rebel. Kind of showing that wonder if we are lambs. You know, the lambs are bleeding. The sheep are bleing. &gt;&gt; Who's going to answer the bling? Who's going to answer it? I'll tell you who answers it. The answer comes through the word. And who has the word today where I tell you where does he work in and through? He works in and through his bride. And she knows that we have the word of faith in our lips already. It's in our heart. Then let's start exercising it and taking our authority and claim our rights on the basis of the word. Amen. Sorry, Sister Melody. You heard a rough sermon, but God send you give you traveling mercies. We're praying for you. We're praying for all of you. And I hope you're praying for me &gt;&gt; because this isn't easy. As our pastor will know, it's not easy. But we have to get over this about what people think about us. and let go and lay our veil on his shoulders and let him do and work through us. Let me tell you what the prophet said. He said, "It's you ceasing and him doing." &gt;&gt; Hebrews 4:10 said, "When you've entered into rest, you have ceased from your labors." &gt;&gt; God is in control. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're sealed. You've entered into rest. You ceased from your ceased. Brother man said, "You've got to cease." Philippians 2:13 said, "It's God which workketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasure." Then let's let him do it. Let's give our veil on his shoulders and quit worrying about how we sound and just give yourself to him in love and let him by love preach it. &gt;&gt; If we're called to preach it or preach it in your home to your children, preach it, brother, sister. We all have a ministry in that body. Amen. To serve our head. We only have one head. Let's not get double-minded here. We only have one head. &gt;&gt; Let's be lambs. Let's submit ourselves. Let's surrender our lives to Christ. You're his possession. Do you want him to lead or not lead? Are you willing to commit yourself to him? Cuz God and his and Christ the bride, Christ the bride and God are the same person. It's himself. And we're here for one purpose. That's to serve Christ. And our lives and our makeups ought to reflect that. We don't have to pump it up. We need a new birth. If we can't, if that's not happening through us, then we need to say, "Lord, there's something in the way here. Let's move it out of the way and let me not be a hearer only, but a doer of your word." Amen. God bless you. Richly bless you. The government shall be upon his shoulders. A body hast thou prepared me, Lord? Sacrifice and offering, I would not, but a body hast thou prepared me? Where's his body? Where's my body? Where's my wife's body? Do I show doom benevolence to her? She's not able to do anything. Has no authority except I give her that over her body. and I have no authority over mine unless she gives it to me. Amen. It's more than just natural marriage situations. It goes spiritual, too. Amen. All right, brother. Like I had to tell you, brother Paul, I just quit. That's all. Quit preaching. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, thou the stream of all our comfort, more than life to me. Whom on earth beside thee, and whom in heaven but thee? We rejoice in every correction. We have a right now. We either can accept it or reject it. And I say, Lord, help us each one to give ourselves entirely to you. You are our shepherd. We shall not want. Our shepherd is not only our father. Our shepherd is our husband. And we submit ourselves to you, Lord, with all of our hearts. Lay our veil on your shoulders. You have the right. You have the right to do whatever you want. You will keep me. You'll hold me. You said you've accept the obligation. And I say, "Amen. That's all I need to know. You'll direct my path. You're guiding it perfectly. No, Lord. There's many times I don't understand, but it's me ceasing and you doing. I give myself over to your hands. I give my veil, place it on your shoulders. I do this for your glory and honor and for the honor and glory of yourself present with us because Lord, I'm soon to take a rapture. I've taken a change of my body and I'm feeding on that open book and I'm becoming what I feed on, Lord. and I'm praising you and I'm thanking you. But you took the book, you took your body. You took the book, you took your bride. And how glorious this union is, Lord. Everything has been provided. The the clothing, everything we need has already been opened in this word for us. And as we eat, you move. As we partake. And Lord, there isn't that we have to go out and and do this. We just submit ourselves to your word. we start partaking of your word and you'll take care of the rest of it. And what a blessed thing it is, Lord, that we can enter into that rest and for your glory and your honor in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Aren't you glad you have an ear to hear the word? The bride be in the final voice to the final age. The spirit and the bride say, "Come." And the Bible said, "In every age," he said, "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith." The bride's ministry is the message of the hour. The bride's ministry is that open book. Aren't you glad? Baptism we needed, every one of us. But that's a temporal gift. The real gift is that soul down in there &gt;&gt; that was predestinated by God to receive this word. I'm not ashamed of this word. Amen. I say, "Lord, let me preach it. As long as you open the door and open wherever I be, wherever I go, it doesn't matter." I say, "Lead me, Lord, I will follow." I wish I could sing. We can sing that that chorus. Lead me Lord, I will follow. Oh lead me Lord. I will go. You have called me. I will answer. Lead me Lord. I will go. I wish I knew the verses well enough. I don't. But so let's just sing the chorus once again. Lead me Lord, I will. &gt;&gt; I want to raise my hand. Say, God, this is to you. &gt;&gt; I'm testifying of that. Follow. I will go. You have called me. I will answer. Lead me Lord. I will go. One more time from your heart. Head me Lord. I will follow. Oh lead me Lord. I will go. You have called me and I have answered. Lead me Lord. I will go. Amen. Thank you Lord. Is that your desire? Is that your prayer? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. God don't want mixers. He wants separators. We need a place of yielding to the spirit. A man never knows what it is to live a victorious life until he's completely overcome. Who? Himself. Amen. That's it. Let's sing Wings of Faith. There are two roads you may take. One by side and one by faith. Take the word of God or what you see. What you believe is what will be. So set your wings to the winds of faith. You can fly in a higher place. Do not struggle for it's by grace. Set your way to the winds of faith. So watch your need. Watch your cry. I need more of you, Lord. Watch your mountain much too high. Speak the word of God. Prophesy again and by and by it will move or you will fly. So set your wings in the wind. Faith takes its resting place in the word, brother, sister. Only in the word. &gt;&gt; You can fly in a higher place. So do not struggle. Oh, it's by grace at your wing. to the winds of faith. So watch the eagle in the sky. Just watch him set those wings. He dust struggle, does not strive. Two wings he was in action. The power that makes him right is already already in your heart. That's where it's at. So set your wings to the winds faith. Amen. Rest in the word. You can fly in. Don't you let the devil tell you you can't do that. Do not struggle. Well, it's by grace, sufficient grace. Set your wings, the winds of faith. You are my refuge. We'll close with that song. You are my hiding place. You are my refuge. You are my sanctuary. I feel afraid. You're my hiding place. You are my refuge. When the storm is raging underneath your wings I rejoice and sing. You are my refuge. You are my refuge. You are my sanctuary. When I feel afraid, you're my hiding place. You are my refuge. When the storm is raing underneath your wings, I rejoice and sing. You are my refuge. Thank the Lord. Brother Paul, do you have anything you want to Okay, God bless you. Come expecting Sunday. Come prayed up. Come in the spirit. Come in early. Get out from out there and come in and pray. Get ready to receive the word. I can tell you that. That's part of the ministry. I didn't say that to be funny. We've got too much of that. We need to get in here and get into the word and start praying and ask God to move. Amen. Might as well say it like it is. Amen. That's what we should do. Then we have homes to visit. We've come here to see him. We've come here to meet him. We've come here to hear the word. God bless you. Still love me. See you. I love you. God bless you.
