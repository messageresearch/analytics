dwelling within my [Music] you're standing in the presence of god tonight do you realize with god all things are possible [Music] nothing can stand in the way of god nothing can stand away in you because god said you are part of me what happens is our faith needs strengthening you you don't lack faith you have faith because you have what god put in you before the foundation of the world but what you need is you need your faith strengthened you say god i want to take you at your word 110 percent strengthen my faith listening to the sermon today briefly perfect strength in perfect weakness that was my title at one point perfect weakness your god finds perfection in your weakness how come because he is glorified in that and when god is glorified he is god because he created you so that your worship could make him god amen thank you musicians it's so good to be a christian i uh i love serving the lord amen i love his word amen why don't we stand tonight as we mentioned before but just to ask again covet your prayers i fly out thursday evening friday evening sorry to go to um brother jewels there in north carolina and we'll be gone for 10 days going to preach with a berry the following weekend so prayers for me and my family while i'm away for that long but praise the lord and that god would speak while we're there amen amen that's what we're really doing and all that's what it's all about i don't i don't care whatever god wants me to do just yield to his hands and he'll take care of everything why don't we pray before we turn to the scriptures heavenly father lord we are so thankful lord to be called your children tonight lord to be members of the kingdom of god not members of a church down here but the church father your bride lord jesus we ask that you would speak to our hearts tonight lord jesus that your word would be imparted to us and you would strengthen our faith lord father we would not let the devil try to tell us we we don't have anything we would not let him rob us of our victory but we will be you would identify within us the faith lord that you desire to strengthen with your word tonight lord i pray that you would bless those that are in in need lord for little ephos still father as they get into the process and father looking forward for healing lord jesus well god we just commit the situation into your hands lord and the different ones father i just pray that you just speak to us tonight we love you lord we thank you in jesus name we pray amen uh if you have your bibles uh john chapter one i put on one but it's supposed to be john chapter three john chapter three sorry john chapter 3 there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him so he had a knowledge of christ intellectually they were putting two and two together hey nobody can do these things except they be of god so he comes to jesus jesus answers him and right out of the gate jesus says very verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god that statement to nicodemus was similar to the statement jesus made to the disciples when he said unless you drink my blood and eat my flesh you have no part with me it was the word speaking now it was the miracles and the healings and all these things that they saw but then nicodemus comes to him and jesus speaks the word which is what divides between the uh make believer and the true believer it's the separation right see the healings and those things are our promises but in the ministry of jesus they were the attraction but then when the word came so the word so jesus right out of the gate brings the word which was well i'll get ahead of myself so nicodemus says unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee accept a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit marvel not that i said unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but can't not tell what whence it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit nicodemus answered and said to him how can these things be it's a hard saying which is uh similar to what those disciples 70 that walk no more with him they said how how can we accept this he just answered and said unto him art thou a master of israel and know us not these things in other words it's in the word why have you not seen it verily rarely i say unto thee we speak that we do that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye receive not our witness if i have told you earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if i tell you of heavenly things and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life he's preaching to nicodemus redemption story how can you be born again unless the son of man be raised up like moses did with the serpent he says verse 16 for god so loved the world that he gave now he's still speaking to nicodemus for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god said not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved oh that church makes me feel judged verse 21 is where we draw our text tonight but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds might be may be made manifest that they are wrought in god and then the story moves on what happened to nicodemus we don't know we don't hear of him again that i'm aware of i i see it in my head as he just puts his head down and walks away couldn't accept it too hard of a saying or later on down the road he be converted verse uh galatians doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not it is not a sin to become weary in well-doing it is what happens because we still have inhabit a fleshly tabernacle this body is is of death and it will return to that but as the spirit within us that will go on for eternity can in connection with arthinophthiophany sometimes we get we get tired sometimes we get wore down sometimes it gets hard to continue on in well doing that's why the scripture is there because god knew it would happen it had happened no doubt paul experienced that weary and well doing first corinthians 15 58 paul again therefore my beloved brethren be is steadfast unmovable always always abounding in the work of the lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain the well-doing you're doing is not in vain continue to stand fast stand strong like the tree planted by the water is not movable stand fast in what truth continue to be a doer of truth now tonight i i started we would start when i started studying this out i thought i had it down and then you know at five o'clock today was like nope and changed it all around on me and then i was in the office back here and it just three three sermons just came together and that is that that we must be doers of truth and i had some notes put down some time ago from james james is a book of action james says i will show you my faith by my works in other words he's a man of action that's what that's what his anointing was everybody has the there's a group of gifts that everyone has but everyone has then their personality their their uh who they are who christ made them to be and their their um flavor of the truth not it's not different it's just the way they bring it out and james is the kind of man was a man of action you know i doubt he had was the kind of person growing up you know james sit down just sit still sit down you know he he wanted to be up and he wanted to be doing and so in in the book of james is a call to action james saying as a christian you must not be in action in action one word not doing anything you must be in action you must be a doer a worker of the faith in other words a doer of truth and jesus when he's speaking to nicodemus nicodemus he ends his sermon with he that doeth truth cometh to the light amen cometh to the light you say i need the light start doing the truth well what is truth what do you find in truth you find liberty victory deliverance freedom of the uh victory over depression victory over anxiety all these things you find free where the spirit of the lord is amen so truth is the embodiment of our relationship with christ you cannot trust the truth unless you have a relationship with the truth you can't be a man or a woman that is a doer of truth unless you know truth unless you know truth um perfect strength by a perfect weakness i told you some of us build it upon intellectual conception oh that this know-it-all this man's a trained scholar we should train our people and school them the next one bases it upon some sensation sensation of movement i like how he takes this both sides right because you have people that say oh you know you know i don't this i hope it doesn't sound derogatory but you know praise god i'm not so smart but you know we don't want to be smart it's pretty much how they say it pretty much they say if you if you're smart intellectual world well you're out of luck that's how i've heard it interpret it right but that's not what the scripture said but but what i'm saying here there's two sides of it there's the intellectual side and then there's the other side he says uh a sensation a movement shaking crying shouting dancing in the spirit or something some emotional outward work see you can find the set you say there's two you know well there's two sides of the roads and there's always people on both sides of the roads and people in the middle um and and you know people on the side you know you never know in church if they're getting it or not they're very stoic but guess what within that stoke people is people that are just wow inside they're just wow right and so if you're not careful you say well i don't see an outward ex there should be outward expression emotion but i'm talking across the board an average and then you see people they're shouting oh wow they must get it because they're shouting no you have the same amount of people if you will within the shouting that are within the intellectual that just aren't getting it it's the other it's the two extremes but we want to find balance in the center of the road if you know me you know i love to express so how loud but some have anyways the next one bases it upon okay simpson station if the devil can't get you on this side he'll push you off that side but the thing with this is having nothing that you can depend on in your own self or anything that you can do just a complete total surrender of your weaknesses unto god and say here i am have nothing no ability that you can trust it for a long time on my sermons the way they the way they sit in in my ipad i have a cover so i know i had i have a cover now it says the title so it's easier to find but before i had the cover that said god doesn't call the qualified he qualifies the call see god doesn't want your qualifications in in the sense of of of the flesh you better be qualified by the scripture right but god's looking for he says i think it's in this sermon where he says you know they um well let me just finish reading the quote because it's probably in here search back through the scripture and find out yeah as i got the scriptures written out here i'm referring to some some back through the scriptures we find out that god always used the nobodies to become his somebody he always taken those that the world had rejected the modern age had rejected and that's the kind that he picked up to use consider the apostles think about peter the fisherman not enough education to write his own name john the ignorant and unlearned those men he bypassed the nobles and the educated priests and the celebrities of them days the scholars the church members and got them people who thought uh then people who thought they were somebody and picked up those who were nobody and used them now somebody can become one of his people god can use them if they are ready to forget that they are somebody see nobody's left out see the bible says it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god not impossible god can use it if they're ready to forget they are a somebody if you are ready to forget that you're at somebody and become a nobody then god can use you and make a somebody out of you it's a bit of a tongue twister see but you've got to forget that you're so important you've got to forget that you're so important listen you'll stumble over your feet trying to be a doer of the truth if you think you're somebody that's right but as in your perfect weakness that is your finest hour so nicodemus had a an intellectual knowledge and some of the youth will probably pick up on this because we talked about this youth meeting you have nicknames had an intellectual knowledge of christ see whether what the man says come to the saving knowledge of christ but he also talks about knowledge as being an intellectual but the scripture says come to the knowledge of truth so knowledge can be knowledge of the heart is a revelation of christ knowledge of the head is an intellectual understanding so nicodemus him and the pharisees they they put two and two together this man is is doing things of the scripture so he has to be from god but they couldn't say that in public because that would just dismantle their whole religion and their position so they come to him by night hey you appear to be right of god because of these things you do so they had an intellectual understanding and you've met those people that can just say it just right but you see no expression from their heart something in their heart isn't round up they have an intellectual knowledge but you need a heartfelt knowledge of christ so jesus christ recognizes this in nicodemus now he begins to call nicodemus in a spiritual realm to be a doer of truth he finishes the sermon off but he that doeth truth cometh to light nicodemus you're looking for the light here's the truth become a doer of truth and you will come to the light and so nicodemus is received so what i'm trying to say is he recognized that nicodemus had an intellectual understanding but he needed to transfer that knowledge down to his heart that song goes from my head down to my heart the word of god so he begins to speak the word and it's the word of god that separates it's the word of god that brings that that which you know down into your heart some not everyone that comes to to know the lord didn't know nothing previously a lot of people had you know kind of an understanding of the bible and all this stuff or they grew up in a church or a catholic church so they had an intellectual understanding but it was when the truth right because it takes the right vehicle to bring the word of god in as truth god has anointed some of the anointed you as a bride of christ to be an expression be truth presented so when you go and you witness to somebody you're saying the same scriptures that the denominations might use but you are a vehicle of truth and you're presenting that truth and that will shed the light onto that person's life that was that woman was free the word so the word came to nicodemus to bring him into the knowledge of the truth but he couldn't accept it the deep there was no deep to respond so truth presented brother madam says in the quote the seal of christ now over in the book of ephesians we read now what the seal of god is we see what the seal of the devil is in hebrews 10 first we go to the seal of god for if we disbelieve willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin the knowledge of truth see if the truth this is underlined okay good if the truth has been presented jesus christ came to earth to present truth and not only present truth he was the truth you are the truth i mean everyone we should be saying amen to that one if you but see you can only be the truth i love how i this is me this is my personal opinion i guess put that little footnote in there growing up in the message i always looked as soon as the preacher started talking about the seals i looked at that as the deep part of the of the thing but then once god gave me a revelation of the word yeah i was in i grew up in the message it wasn't until i was about 18 years 19 years old i caught a revelation no other than that you're married called a revelation of the word i had a revelation to follow christ but the full open word i didn't catch revelation until i was much older and it was when i called revelation i realized you begin to talk about the seals and some people look oh they kind of get glassy eyed and it gets it gets into the deep part if you will but you see right here i just preached the seals he was the truth you are the truth there you go opening of the word right there because you can't know christ unless those seven seals are opened that's right you cannot be a doer of truth without the open word because you need all the truth today where we live today you need all the truth christ smiled upon it in the ages past but today all truth is required travel id passport vaccine natural type is spiritual okay anyways i don't know where that would go but um it's all required today you have to be so if you want to be a doer of truth you have to know christ who is truth and he says he goes on to say and the religious people of that day said now we know that he is and has mental telepathy you know they always have a they always got to figure it out right i've i've you've heard people explain something sometimes you're like you have no idea what you're saying and just in general life you know people try to explain and they use words that don't have the right meanings and you're like okay you're just trying too hard these uh pharisees were just oh mental telepathy right did they even because we realize that he's reading their minds out there but we believe that all of his healings and things and then now go ahead brother cephas caiaphas did that oh they would say that was god because he's part of their denomination but as soon as jesus does it no not i don't know if caiaphas did it but just dear let it theoretically jesus does it he's not paul we can't that's my telepathy that's beelzebub that's of the devil and this is right here he says um but we believe that all of his healings and things that he does is only by the devil because he don't agree with our denomination so they said he's a devil now he says denomination but today we need to move that into the message because that's where we are today the ministry when weatherman was alive the ministry was come out of the denominations and come into the truth so there was that what he was dealing with we're dealing with now today in the message because it's a separation time so they say oh that's of the devil or they say that church isn't on the on the word per se or they're we don't because they don't agree with us they didn't do what we thought they should do or or what what have you it's the same spirit what is that spirit that spirit of of division you see but then there's a pro that's so then then you have a perverted spirit of unity and so they say oh well they want to they want division over here but then they want unity but only if you you know cut this off and don't talk about this and these things over here but you see what's lacking is the saving knowledge of christ they're not doers of truth they're not doers of truth the statue of a perfect man brother branham says and then thirdly you add knowledge knowledge now that don't mean worldly knowledge because that's foolishness to god but knowledge to judge judge what right from wrong and then the filter the thinking man's filter is the holy spirit truth is the holy spirit knowledge of christ would be the holy spirit a revelation of christ you can't have that unless you're born again nicodemus you need to be a doer of truth but first you must be born again amen and guess what nicodemus it's because god so loved the world god so he nicodemus knew exactly what jesus was talking about when he said as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness nicodemus was a scholar of the of this of the of the old testament or the the torah or whatever they called it at that time the scrolls there he was a student so he understood exactly what jesus was saying and no doubt when the prophet because we don't as far as i know there's nothing more about nicodemus so when they go through and they i'm going to take liberty they begin to put jesus on trial no doubt nicodemus begin to think about this night and how jesus said the son of man must be lifted up upon the just like the serpent on the on the on the the pole the moses lifted up the serpent realizing what was happening but at that point in time you know powerless to do anything well he would have been in anyways so you want to be nicodemus you want to be a doer of truth we must be born again and that knowledge that you have intellectually must transfer down to your heart praise the lord so that's nicodemus but what about you and i god has called us to be doers of truth now what does that mean does that mean doers of truth when the skies are beautiful and sunny and everyone around you is a christian as well or when everything's going well you understand sometimes you know things as a preacher but you just have to trust i got to preach what god laid on my heart we go through things that are difficult but god is calling us in those moments of time in those that section of our life to still stand up and be a doer of truth when when you're on the the the right on the edge not the edges and you're going to quit serving god but you're on the edge everything's just strung out you're stressed you're weary and well doing see not on the edge of the world but you're weary in what you're doing you must be a doer of truth you must take courage you must have god i need you to strengthen my faith you have faith as we said at the beginning you have faith but you say god i need you to strengthen my faith because i'm going to have to walk this way you see he was singing that song waymaker so in in the way that we sing that song and i know i said this but already but in the way that we sing that song it's it's that god's making a way but the other way is the way you walk as a christian god made that way already before the foundation of the world and he has called you to walk that way and no matter how hard that way gets it'll be your finest hour when it's darkest when things are the most difficult that is your finest hour there's a man in the bible by the name of shamgar is there anything else written of him besides the ox goat and slaying of the philistines no that's it that's all here but the man probably lived 40 70 however many years a lifetime of service because he i think he was a judge when i read the church that's how i understand it a lifetime of service but all you read about is shamgar now that moment in time in shamgar's life was his darkest hour it was the worst time for him well if adam puts it this way he looked over and there's his wife her clothes all ragged sunken eyes sucking cheeks kids too skinny sick pale needing nourishment and says he looked at his family and said they will not survive the winter things were as bad as they could get for shamgar but if we read the scriptures today we say that was his finest hour and that's dark time when he stepped forth as a doer of truth because he said i am but the man says he got angry he got angry the bible says be angry and sin nots righteous indignation we call it we like to put a fancy name to it but he was he was angry angry that these uncircumcised philistines were coming around his house stealing what rightfully belonged to him apply that to whatever situation there is in your life stand up and be a doer of truth how is he a doer of truth you say that scripture hadn't yet been written with jesus because he took within his hands the anointed word of god amen doing exactly what god wanted him to do god said told israelites stand and fight did that end no no as long as you're in the promised land you got to fight you have to keep fighting because guess what they drove them out now they're out kind to come back in you drive the devil out you say oh that's done that's taken care of nope here he comes trying to get back in you have to be a doer of truth you have to walk in the truth but it was shangri in that very dark time that was his finest hour but it took courage it took faith in god's word for him to be a doer of truth and you can only have faith and be and step into action if you know the truth and he knew the truth i am a circumcised israelite son of abraham isaac and jacob i come from god was what they were saying because god called abraham and so on so he had a saving knowledge of christ so he says let every man's word be a lie but mind be true see now you're getting knowledge that's i love this word supreme knowledge you don't have to have four degrees in some college or something like that to have it because all these virtues are given to you by god to place upon the foundation of your faith see notice notice the statue of perfect man starts with faith in order for you to build up into christ you have to have faith why because you have to know christ no man will build up into the statue of a perfect man unless he has met christ not an emotion although that will sometimes be part of it but he has met christ the word true and open to him you don't have the four okay that you might come to the full stature of a real real living man of god a real living man god add knowledge because knowledge of his word you must believe it in this way so he says believe it like this that the days of miracles is not past knowledge that what god said god is able to perform knowledge that what god said god is able to perform all things are possible with god nothing is impossible can you can you go ahead you can speak up in the congregation can you tell me what that excludes pick something pick anything if i asked you before saying that for you to pick the worst situation ever you would have something to pick up something to blurt out but you see nothing can argue with all things are possible lord strengthen our faith we are called to action not in action hebrews 11 32 you can turn there if you want i'm going to go back and read the whole chapter tonight if you want recommend it what shall i more say for the time would fail me to tell of gideon and of barack and of samson and the jephthah of david also and samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths obtained promises is listed right up there with stop the mouths of lions it is no small thing for you to claim a promise in faith that god has given you amen quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead rays to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yay moreover of bonds and in prison as they were stoned they were sown asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskin and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented next time you feel like you're having a bad day read the scripture of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through what faith received not the promise but god asked you to stand up against the intellectual demons of the world today against the spirits in the darkness in the principalities and the powers of the air to stand up against the ease of life and be a doer of truth a doer of truth is in the spiritual with muscle on it faith that what god has called you to do he is able to perform that through you because he you are you are god in flesh having received faith received not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect we they're they're the cloud of witnesses in the next chapter is calling out needing you to stand up and be a doer of truth if you're in a dark time in your life right now this is your finest hour oh how dare you say that how dare you take presumption it's not me that's right it's what god has told me to say you say wow you're just taking all the liberties tonight brother chris well hey it's time we did and it's the spring of 1940 may 1940 this the springtime poland and norway denmark belgium the netherlands and france had fallen under nazi rule says world war one uh two the united states doesn't have the military power to enter the war great britain is left standing alone on the edge of the abyss of a new dark age it is in this crisis that the newly elected prime minister winston churchill finds himself in may of 1940. knowing this is a dire situation he stepped onto the floor of the house of commons on june 18 1940. he spoke for 36 minutes reassuring the people of britain of their military strength and their duty to stand up to fight on if necessary for years if necessary alone god calls us to fight alone sometimes forsaking father and mother and sister and brother alone in the flesh but not in the spirit to stand up to fight on if necessary for years if necessary alone he finished his speech with these words the battle of france is over i expect that the battle of britain is about to begin upon this battle depends of the survival of christian civilization these are his words upon it depends our own british life and the long continued continuity by our institutions and our empire the whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us i hope your spiritual thinking caps are wrong hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war if we can stand up to him all europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad sunlit uplands but if we failed in the whole world including the united states including all that we have known and cared for will sink into the abyss of a new dark age made more sinister and perhaps more protracted by the lights of perverted science let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties and so bear ourselves ourselves that if the british empire and its commonwealth lasts for a thousand years men will still say this was their finest hour you talk about a dark time they were completely alone when france fell to nazi germany that was it it was them it was britain but it's but i believe winston churchill was anointed of god for that time in history as well as these words saints of god the whole fury and might of the enemy is turned upon you two hundred thousand thousand demons released at the rivers of river euphrates they say oh well how can we even have hope that's the brilliance of god he says i want to show i want to end the world in the crescendo so i want to show just what my bride is capable of doing because of his strength now you will never be a doer of truth and you will never stand strong like the british did because guess what we we say it did they had the victory and we say that was their finest hour you will never stand firm in your time of darkness in your position unless you can stand upon the truth of christ you say you already have the faith within you but you need god to come because it is your weakness you have no strength stop thinking you have strength start thinking you have faith because you do before the foundation of the world you are given the faith to overcome everything you will come into contact with god is here to strengthen that faith and to tell you be not weary in well-doing but stand fast unmovable knowing that what as god has called you to do in doing so it is not done in vain but god is looking down upon that and he's smiling in your darkness and that dark time they're going to and he's saying this is their finest hour as the world comes to a close the bride as we as the bride of christ as we begin to to put up with this darkness and it just gets darker and darker and darker as the bride as a whole this is her finest hour what will be written down of your life when you face the darkness what will be written down when you were faced with a trial or you were faced with a hardship or you were faced with something you could not overcome well i'll tell you because that's already be written down and they overcame him overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony because god has called you to be a doer of truth and it is by that your action based on god's word that you will find in your finest hour you know shortly after that uh germany began to bomb london england london and other key cities later in the fall they called it the blitz it actually had the opposite effect it angered the citizens it gave them greater resolve those that survived the bombings till people will just go about their day getting their bread and this that either while the alarms are going off and bombs are dropping they just want about their day they took up whatever they had and armed themselves in preparation for an invasion germany did them a favor by bombing them historians will tell you the same thing it would have been better because their people were in fear they were in fear they were afraid of what they would be afraid of you see the devil sometimes he comes whispering around you trying to get you to fear what's already been defeated what you already have the victory over but you see he just comes and whispers because he knows unlike the germans that if it actually happens you will find faith and you will stand strong so he begins to whisper what about this what if this happens what if that's the biggest thing when it comes to fear and anxiety what the what ifs look face it when it comes don't worry about tomorrow for the eve the the the evils of the present day are enough if germany had not bombed instead of and they would have just continued to threaten them they would have had greater luck greater advantage but when they started to bomb the people go oh i'm still alive the ones that survived right i'm still alive what do you got germany and it strengthened their resolve aroused within them a result so you say people say well why would god allow this to happen he's bombing off he's bombing the areas of your life that you don't need to give you a greater resolve to stand strong because when you go through the fire let me tell you let me ask you this if the children the shadrach meshach and abednego had to face the fire again what level of faith would they have in comparison to the first time they said hang on we'll walk in for you praise god you wanted to have church today anyways you walk through something god gives you a greater faith coming out the other side and he's coming back for a bride who overcomes how do you overcome so the bible says by the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony but what is that all based upon your faith i keep saying it and it keeps coming to me you have faith claim the faith you have and say god strengthen it don't sit there saying oh i wish i had faith or i just don't have faith and lord give me faith no claim the faith that you have that she has been imparted unto you and say god i need you to strengthen my faith to stand the test strengthen my faith so that in time to come they or this or whatever they is would say that was their finest hour when we get to the other side and we meet the the the great men of god in history and scripture they're going to say wow you're the bride of laodicea and you go through days and you're and it's just it's hard and the race of life and the the modern technology and everything that just causes so much grief you think how you know we don't we don't face lions we don't face all this stuff but yet they're going to say how did you make it and that this is like i said your finest hour i'm going to read that scripture again real quick john but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds it may be made manifest that they are wrought in god see any time god calls you to action in the scriptures he reminds you it's not you it's him we talk about the priest how they how they put their foot into the river jordan and then it parted but what were they carrying the word of god yeah it wasn't their feet it was the word of god acting through them but they had they had they had to have faith john okay i just read that james 1 22-25 i just have it here so but be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and goes his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was but who so looketh into the perfect law of liberty what do you think that is truth and continue with therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed john 14 12 very very i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than thee shall he do because i go unto my father you want to see light shed on the situation that you're facing start walking how's that song go start while i'm talking walking up the kings highway it is your feet forward footsteps is possession doer of the word having faith that if you put your foot forward spiritually speaking god will act upon his word because it was abraham's faith that god recognized that god gave him circumcision which was a sign of his faith which we know is it is a a type of the holy spirit so you want the holy spirit you don't have the holy spirit yet step forward in faith and god will recognize that faith that he he has by that's the thing he put the faith abraham had in abraham amen they say it's god god the whole way through in and out praise god musicians would come tonight we are called to be doers of truth and we can only do that if we're standing upon the truth through our faith in what god has called us to do just write that in your notes or on your door on your fridge do do what whatever god asks you to do pray that god you know because this is something i experienced in my own life so i can kind of it's kind of where i always come back to is that don't get it so figured out the path in front of you that you miss what god's trying to say you know that's that's the world oh you need to have figured out when you're in high school you need to have figured out what you're going to do for the rest of your life so you can take these classes in high school you can transfer into college ask me about college sometime you can transfer into college and you can go to college for this amount of time then you can do this and but that's not always how god works he doesn't want you to necessarily i mean you should i gotta be careful i say this because i don't want you should have some idea where you're going you can't just sit down and do nothing but don't have your life in front of you so figured out and fit in this little box that when god comes over here you're going where's god i don't see god he's over here you know shining bright flashing light to you where's god i don't see god in my life you know what where's the healing where's deliverance has your church put you in a box i pray this church isn't doing that yes has a ministry you've been feeding on put you in a box this is it this is god we haven't figured out but yet they preach oh don't put a period at the end of god don't put the period there don't put a period let god do you know be open to moving of god but but only in these contexts only in this context you need to pay attention to but this over here all that you know that's just that guy's idea that's this you know those churches are it's us here be careful that you and your spiritual walk with god that you don't say well you know i've been in the message 40 years i know the quotes i've read the seals i've read the church age book twice each each one read the bible through a bunch of times this is god so the spirit of the lord moves upon the the service and people begin to just worship and weep he's sitting there going oh they must have some sin within them because i have arrived it's funny saying to god but it's not because it's true people get that way always be open to god's word always say lord always say lord i wanna i wanna be whatever it is your will is 360 degrees it's eternity right god's will god has eternity god's will is one big thing all around it could be any direction lord help me to be focused on your will what you have but you see don't get all stressed and worked up about it because as soon as you do then the flesh takes over and you start reading the supernatural into everything and it just becomes superstition [Music] did you know that can happen you can get so supernatural it becomes superstition be careful balance it's all in balance praise god says god [Music] remember these things god has called you to action to be doers of truth when you find yourself in a dark dark time remember that it's your finest hour because it is you in complete weakness it is you in complete weakness and you can say god i am weary and well doing come let's bow our hands tonight lord there be some here tonight i believe i father the bible said that paul says when i was a child i spake as a child but then i became a man i speak i put away the childish things but i know tonight these are the words you wanted to say somebody is weary and well doing lord and we're asking you to come down and strengthen their faith whether they're here online watch it later whatever it's your in your hands but god somebody's weary lord i ask that you would come with your strength the faith that they always already have that they've had this whole time identify it within them lord and strengthen that faith so they could stand like shadrach and say i'll walk in the fire so they could stand like daniel and say all gold in the pit they could stand like shamgar and say i'll take the ox gold father you have called us to be doers of truth is that easy no it's not but that's the whole point lord for you have called us in our weakness god that your strength could be perfected lord jesus oh god i'm not caught up in emotions just to be in emotions i feel a moving lord you are calling us to stand in our weakness so that your strength could be perfected lord jesus i left my hands tonight those that would join me god we ask lord jesus strengthen our faith lord give us a greater resolve lord jesus to stand like shamgar and stand by gideon barack jeff sampson and say god i can't see samson couldn't see but he put his hand to the plow he put his hand to the pillars of doubt around him and he said god all i know is you are god so i'm gonna do what you call me to do and that's push god sometimes we don't understand what's going on around us but you have called us to push forward to press on toward the mark of the high calling in christ jesus you have called us to press on not to sit down and just wait but to be in action and it is in that action in your will that we find the strength of the lord not a carnal understanding of waiting but the true understanding of waiting on the lord oh god we thank you lord jesus thank you lord jesus [Music] amen if that was if that was you all eyes closed heads bowed if that was you won't you just in your heart say it lord i accept it you know that's all you have to do it's not a big workup it's not a big hurrah all the time sometimes it's quiet what was it with elijah on the mountain
