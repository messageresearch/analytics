[28:39] [Music]
[28:42] amen good to be here tonight it's good
[28:45] to see you
[28:46] amen let's also remember brother ivan
[28:49] and sister nadia on their little holiday
[28:51] together
[28:53] and uh lord just be with them
[28:55] i was just thinking about my brother tim
[29:00] the unfortunate circumstances in this
[29:02] life
[29:04] of of having to work
[29:08] and
[29:09] the the hours the time so just remember
[29:11] brother tim in prayer and
[29:13] brother david sister diane their
[29:15] daughter sarah and grandson andrew were
[29:17] in town and they had mentioned that they
[29:20] were probably going up to visit the
[29:22] smiths
[29:23] and so i believe that's probably where
[29:25] they're at tonight so
[29:27] um we just want to keep them in prayer i
[29:30] just want you to uh without going
[29:33] through and naming a lot of names that
[29:34] we don't know
[29:36] but um
[29:37] there is just
[29:39] a tremendous amount
[29:41] of saints around the world that are
[29:45] passing
[29:46] and you hear some comments and people
[29:48] are
[29:50] they're talking about covid and talking
[29:52] about these things but uh actually not
[29:55] connected you know we'll touch on some
[29:57] things tonight lord willing that
[29:59] actually these thoughts never
[30:01] uh what would you say
[30:03] moved us to study in this vein it's just
[30:06] kind of a connection that is there but
[30:08] just remember them just i know it might
[30:10] kind of sound generic but just to
[30:12] remember those families and those
[30:14] churches brother mike olteg uh is in
[30:17] surgery in recovery right now uh his
[30:20] little church uh there in augusta um uh
[30:24] out on the on the coast there uh beach
[30:26] island
[30:27] um and uh you know so tonight their
[30:31] pastors you know in the hospital uh
[30:34] uh expected to make recovery right but
[30:37] certainly kind of scary when when you
[30:39] know you just come to a stage that
[30:41] uh your body cannot support itself so
[30:44] let's just remember that and uh
[30:48] i also
[30:56] oh my let's remember uh sister carl
[30:59] ruffino
[31:00] um and uh
[31:02] so yes definitely the lord would just
[31:05] touch her come on this scene
[31:07] amen so you know many many things and uh
[31:10] so
[31:11] uh
[31:12] just i think it's a time saints as uh as
[31:15] uh the word of god has taught us prophet
[31:17] reiterated that
[31:19] it is a time for us to just make sure
[31:21] that we put everything in order and
[31:24] we're faithful to lift one another up
[31:26] before the lord amen
[31:28] so i
[31:29] want to also announce that the youth
[31:31] meetings as far as i know
[31:33] and grace kids are still taking place
[31:35] friday 7 00 p.m at their respective
[31:39] houses and uh so let's just stand and go
[31:42] into the word i want to talk to you just
[31:44] taking something
[31:46] out of my studies here for this title
[31:50] the key
[31:51] that unlocked and
[31:53] as we look at that and we just recognize
[31:55] that god has given us a key it's not a
[31:58] key for us just to talk about
[32:00] not just something for us to turn into a
[32:02] vocabulary but god intended for it to be
[32:05] real it attended uh intended for us to
[32:08] um
[32:09] you know be something uh that we
[32:12] uh
[32:14] could apply in our life and
[32:16] have faith and confidence that that when
[32:19] we apply it
[32:20] it will come to pass and god will hear
[32:23] us so let's turn in our bibles to
[32:25] revelations the first chapter we'll look
[32:28] here and see tonight uh what it is that
[32:31] um
[32:34] the the spirit
[32:36] coming down upon john and my brother and
[32:39] sister
[32:40] when we read this
[32:42] i want you to read this that even though
[32:45] as it were
[32:46] in the flesh we were not there when the
[32:48] spirit come down upon john
[32:51] but that same spirit wants to come down
[32:54] on us in the very self-same fashion
[32:58] god is not i'm doing a mighty work over
[33:00] here and then i want you to sit back and
[33:02] just observe it he wants it to become
[33:05] something so real to us
[33:07] that that we're not here talking about
[33:09] it and we'll we'll hit on these things
[33:11] so i don't want to get ahead of myself
[33:13] but we've got to break and i'm not
[33:15] saying that you here tonight or whoever
[33:17] might be listening
[33:19] uh are subject to this but i believe
[33:21] many people are and that is we've got to
[33:23] break the historical figure of jesus
[33:27] christ in our life
[33:29] if he is history
[33:30] then he is not alive
[33:33] to us
[33:34] amen i was in the spirit on the lord's
[33:37] day and heard behind me a great voice as
[33:40] of a trumpet
[33:42] saying i am alpha now we know there's
[33:44] only one voice can say this right
[33:46] amen this is not just a servant this is
[33:49] not just an angel
[33:51] this has to be
[33:53] god almighty the lord jesus christ i'm
[33:56] alpha and omega the first and the last
[33:59] and what thou seest write in a book and
[34:03] send it unto the seven churches which
[34:05] are in asia and to ephesus and to smyrna
[34:08] pergamus and thyatira under sardis
[34:11] philadelphia and unto laodicea
[34:14] and i turned to see the voice that spake
[34:16] with me
[34:17] and being turned i saw seven golden
[34:21] candlesticks
[34:23] and in the midst of the seven
[34:25] candlesticks one likened to the son of
[34:28] man clothed with a garment down to the
[34:30] foot and gird about the paps with a
[34:33] golden girdle
[34:34] his head and his hairs were white like
[34:37] wool as white as snow and his eyes were
[34:40] as a flame of fire and his feet like
[34:44] undefined brass
[34:46] as if they
[34:48] burned in a furnace and his voice as the
[34:51] sound of many waters
[34:54] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[34:57] and out of his mouth went a sharp
[34:59] two-edged sword and his countenance was
[35:02] as the sun shineth in his strength
[35:06] in other words he's saying i really
[35:08] couldn't look at him
[35:10] the sun shineth so bright you can't just
[35:13] stare at it
[35:16] and when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[35:18] dead
[35:19] and he laid his right hand upon me
[35:21] saying unto me fear not i am the first
[35:24] and the last i am he that liveth and was
[35:28] dead
[35:29] and behold i am alive forevermore
[35:34] amen and have the keys of hell and of
[35:37] death
[35:38] write the things which shall have seen
[35:40] and the things which are and the things
[35:42] which shall be hereafter
[35:45] the mystery of the seven stars which
[35:47] i'll sauced in my right hand and the
[35:49] seven golden candlesticks the seven
[35:52] stars or the angels of the seven
[35:54] churches and the seven candlesticks
[35:56] which thouse are the seven churches
[36:00] heavenly father we just thank you
[36:02] tonight we come before you just ask your
[36:04] father bless our time together as we
[36:06] look in your word father it's my heart's
[36:08] desire that the word would be open to us
[36:10] once again in such a fashion lord
[36:13] greater than ever before lord let it be
[36:16] your revelation coming to your people
[36:18] that would stir hearts lord to see
[36:22] the age that we're living in see the
[36:24] open book lord the open word that is
[36:26] before us father to become partakers of
[36:30] that we thank you for your grace your
[36:32] mercy tonight in the name of jesus
[36:34] christ amen you may be seated
[36:41] now as we would look at this tonight i
[36:43] want to just kind of start off sharing
[36:46] with you this thought and that is that
[36:48] the word always identifies itself and
[36:53] even standing there in the days before
[36:56] all the sadducees and pharisees our lord
[36:58] jesus christ was there
[37:00] if if they had um
[37:03] really viewed it if they had not come
[37:05] and and the word prejudiced is such a uh
[37:09] used word in this day that uh you know
[37:12] if
[37:13] if something does not satisfy them then
[37:16] there's some kind of prejudice but let's
[37:18] get down to the real prejudice that
[37:20] really matters and that is that the
[37:22] denominational spirit or the spirit of
[37:25] the religious world is prejudiced
[37:27] against the gospel they do not really
[37:30] like the word because the word in and of
[37:32] itself without even as it were a a group
[37:35] of people but just the word itself
[37:38] actually rebukes them and uh in that
[37:41] realm as they are they're setting uh uh
[37:44] they can uh look at the word if if they
[37:47] had revelation let me just uh put that
[37:50] in there because you see the word always
[37:52] identifies it when jesus come there was
[37:55] an identification that declared that a
[37:57] messiah was coming and it was
[38:00] unfortunately by the prejudice of the
[38:02] religious movements that they determine
[38:04] the criteria by which the messiah must
[38:07] come how he must represent himself and
[38:10] who he would come to
[38:12] oh my brother and sister what what a
[38:15] what a situation when when one would be
[38:17] so determined that god's just going to
[38:19] come through this or through this or in
[38:22] this fashion and so it is there that we
[38:25] would find and now look i know this kind
[38:28] of probably comes across as offensive to
[38:30] some people but i i really believe this
[38:32] with all of my heart that if brother
[38:34] branham was coming back and people are
[38:36] like oh my i've heard people talk about
[38:39] this uh there'll be no room people will
[38:41] be flying from all over the world well
[38:43] what about that poor family in the heart
[38:45] of africa that just survives from day to
[38:48] day but they believe the word they're
[38:49] not going down and getting a ticket and
[38:51] flying to to the united states to attend
[38:53] a meeting but you know let's just for
[38:56] the sake of conversation say it would be
[38:58] possible i think by the second or third
[39:00] day there would be plenty of empty seats
[39:03] because
[39:04] by prejudice just as it was with our
[39:06] lord jesus christ in that day and not
[39:08] trying to put brother branham and jesus
[39:09] christ in that same context but it'll be
[39:12] there and after people hear and their
[39:15] hide gets tore off
[39:20] he's not going to sit down and say i
[39:21] think i need to pamper these people i
[39:24] need their tithe i need their attendance
[39:26] i need
[39:26] no he would he would just lay it right
[39:28] on there i think they'll be saying this
[39:30] is not my prophet
[39:32] this is not my prophet's a gentleman and
[39:34] he loves me
[39:35] he does he loves you so much he tells
[39:37] you the truth
[39:39] but you see the prejudice has it coming
[39:41] in such a fashion
[39:43] just as the same prejudice sister jerry
[39:45] has set through these type of things in
[39:47] south america my brother and sister the
[39:49] same atmosphere is created and people
[39:51] don't believe that they are actually
[39:53] feeding on the word of god or receiving
[39:55] a blessing unless they literally are
[39:57] running up and down the aisles screaming
[40:00] so loud that no one can hear the
[40:01] minister
[40:03] and so you see those kind of kind of
[40:05] things you know and it's a mindset that
[40:08] is there it's a a a
[40:10] preconceived idea
[40:12] and so
[40:13] the word has come and the word in every
[40:16] generation has identified itself and
[40:20] it's identified in and of itself right
[40:22] so you want to look the prophet of god
[40:24] tells us very clearly you want to find
[40:27] the day that you are living in then
[40:29] search the scripture because the
[40:31] scripture will identify the day we are
[40:34] living in so we can find what is
[40:36] happening in the word
[40:38] and so as the word is always identifies
[40:40] itself uh they you know they ask jesus
[40:44] uh uh you know are you the messiah you
[40:47] know are you the messiah he didn't say
[40:49] to them the unbeliever i am the messiah
[40:52] he said to them you say that i am
[40:56] see it was in their own vocabulary they
[40:59] had already admitted that he was the
[41:01] messiah because when the messiah comes
[41:04] these are the things he will do
[41:08] so they acknowledge that he was doing
[41:10] the things that the word said the
[41:12] messiah would do but the messiah
[41:16] oh can i just speak regular words here
[41:18] he slapped them silly
[41:20] he told them your system
[41:22] your hierarchy
[41:24] your spirit is all wrong
[41:27] and they didn't like that instead of
[41:28] repenting and saying oh lord help us
[41:30] they said no sir he has broken what we
[41:33] have declared will be when the messiah
[41:35] comes but when the messiah my brother
[41:38] and sister come as he says there jesus
[41:41] said if you had believed moses you would
[41:44] believe me
[41:45] because he spoke of me so he was
[41:48] identified in the very word that moses
[41:52] had brought and they there recognized
[41:54] moses as a prophet but jesus goes on to
[41:57] say because you did not believe moses
[42:02] right you acknowledged said let's not
[42:04] let's not get too bashful tonight they
[42:07] said amen to moses message while they
[42:10] didn't obey it
[42:12] lord help us to fall under that spirit
[42:15] lord let us come to the place when we
[42:17] say amen to the word that we really mean
[42:19] so be it
[42:20] amen so the same word will bring the
[42:23] same results do we believe that amen so
[42:26] we don't have to come up with a new
[42:27] message for our day amen so we can say
[42:31] very clearly jesus christ identified in
[42:34] the word amen just as he was then he is
[42:37] in the day that we're living in now
[42:39] let's look in this message here
[42:41] identified christ of all ages brother
[42:43] brown says so many people have different
[42:45] opinions of christ as i travel in
[42:48] different parts of the country and
[42:49] around the world i find that so many
[42:51] people have their different opinions
[42:54] you'd be surprised to know what some of
[42:56] their opinions are some of them think
[42:58] that he's just a wonderful teacher well
[43:01] now he was he was that not just exactly
[43:05] and many thinks he was a great
[43:06] philosopher which he was that he
[43:09] certainly he was and then some of them
[43:12] think that he was a good man
[43:14] he he was that but see he was more than
[43:17] that he was all of that plus
[43:21] some of them think that he was a prophet
[43:23] and he was a prophet but he was more
[43:26] than a prophet he was what the prophets
[43:28] was plus see so what how would we know
[43:33] now
[43:33] if he was teaching of his teaching he
[43:36] was a teacher and he was a great
[43:39] philosopher
[43:40] so he was fulfilling see and i hope you
[43:43] catch the the kind of i'm going to say
[43:45] the undertone of what i'm saying here
[43:47] they were saying these things about
[43:49] jesus christ and all that they were
[43:52] saying was true
[43:55] but they never took it to its fruition
[43:57] they never took the fullness of it to
[43:59] receive the true blessing of all that it
[44:02] was
[44:03] they were just declaring their part now
[44:05] brother branham here has tied all of
[44:07] these different sayings that they're
[44:09] saying even islam
[44:11] recognizing him as a good man and
[44:13] declares he's a prophet
[44:15] they just believe muhammad
[44:17] is the prophet
[44:19] see so all of that what brother brown
[44:22] teach us
[44:23] many others have reiterated through the
[44:24] words but hey
[44:26] brother branham said all of these things
[44:28] have an element of truth
[44:32] think about that
[44:35] so it's there he says but the only way
[44:37] we'll ever know today if we wanted to
[44:40] identify him today
[44:43] and i believe that he's raised from the
[44:44] dead i believe that with all my heart
[44:46] and i believe that he's promised here
[44:48] that he is the same yesterday today and
[44:51] forever and i'm with thee always and
[44:53] i'll never leave me nor forsake thee
[44:55] i'll just say can we say amen to that
[44:57] that's what we believe with all of our
[44:59] hearts amen now those words are they're
[45:02] either true
[45:04] or they're not true
[45:07] so now we have a vocabulary that's
[45:10] really not any different than say if we
[45:12] were jehovah witness or whatever else
[45:14] right all of these different ideologies
[45:17] if we call it that have a a basis of
[45:21] truth they have their factual they have
[45:24] their message
[45:26] so just by a declaration of saying oh
[45:29] the message
[45:31] well that doesn't put us on the right
[45:33] track my brother and sister because they
[45:34] all have
[45:36] a message
[45:37] so it comes down see that we have to
[45:40] come back to the word and we have to
[45:43] come and take a position that is
[45:47] sustainable
[45:52] see we can
[45:53] i i won't go into this some of you
[45:55] wouldn't even know the name it doesn't
[45:56] matter
[45:57] but you know you can have something you
[45:59] can gather gathering around yourself you
[46:01] can have the sensational you can have
[46:03] all of this stuff but if it's not a true
[46:06] move of god
[46:08] it will burn out
[46:09] it will fail right the scripture says
[46:11] hey were they not of these and went into
[46:14] the wilderness and were they not of
[46:15] these and it come to not
[46:18] see all of that's going to happen my
[46:20] brother and sister because it's only the
[46:22] true word of god
[46:24] that will survive right through to the
[46:27] end
[46:28] otherwise there's every perversion now i
[46:31] don't know if you caught this in the
[46:32] news but now we have uh the three great
[46:35] leaders of orthodox basically
[46:38] catholicism by different terms they have
[46:40] come together signed a proclamation now
[46:43] that uh humans on the earth that love
[46:46] the earth
[46:48] need to gather together now to save
[46:50] mother earth
[46:53] well i read my bible and it says they'll
[46:55] love the creation more than the creator
[46:58] but people respond to that yes we live
[47:00] on this earth and and we need to we need
[47:03] to do something now we need to uh oh
[47:06] they said sacrifice we need to sacrifice
[47:09] well i would like them to sacrifice
[47:12] along with me
[47:15] right
[47:16] i think that's reasonable
[47:18] but you see what the spirit is the
[47:20] spirit is not there you don't see the
[47:22] three principle
[47:25] leaders of the greatest segment of what
[47:27] they term as christianity coming
[47:29] together saying we need a holy ghost
[47:31] move in this land because the end of
[47:33] time is coming you need to repent or
[47:35] you're going to perish no no we're
[47:37] fulfilling scripture so now we want to
[47:39] focus the world now on this great move
[47:41] to save the earth
[47:43] just so god can burn it
[47:46] they don't believe that part is what it
[47:48] actually comes down to they don't
[47:49] believe that part
[47:53] so
[47:54] and those words are they're either true
[47:56] or they're not and if they're not true
[47:58] see i love how brother branham puts this
[48:00] out i i mean one thing i'll say about
[48:02] brother branham
[48:03] it's it's not just a a uh you know cut
[48:06] and dried thing to me i i love how he's
[48:10] willing to speak you might say on the
[48:12] negative context not too many people
[48:14] really like to introduce that we got to
[48:15] keep you happy by just preaching all the
[48:18] nice things but look what brother brown
[48:19] says here
[48:21] now those words are either true or
[48:22] they're not and if they're not true then
[48:25] what we are doing what then what are we
[48:27] doing here tonight we are we are
[48:29] wretched people
[48:31] we're people that's well we are deceived
[48:35] the whole christian world is deceived if
[48:38] he isn't the same yesterday today and
[48:40] forever if he isn't alive tonight and
[48:43] with us as he promised low i am with you
[48:46] always even to the consummation or into
[48:49] the world i'm with you always now if
[48:51] that isn't the truth then there is
[48:53] something wrong and we are found false
[48:56] witnesses
[48:57] not only are we making ourselves
[48:59] miserable under a false pretense
[49:02] but we are deceiving others so he cuts
[49:05] it right to the chase
[49:06] and there'll be those that say
[49:07] absolutely right that's what that was
[49:09] that's what this message of the hour
[49:11] that's what this is all this is but my
[49:13] brother and sister remember there was
[49:15] always two spirits in the framework of
[49:17] the church and there was always oh there
[49:20] was always a twin when they got raised
[49:23] up in egypt in goshen and they left you
[49:27] would think every one of those people
[49:29] that was leaving egypt would have been a
[49:32] uh uh god fearing praying desiring for
[49:36] deliverance but when they left goshen
[49:38] there was a twin
[49:40] there was another segment another
[49:42] remnant that left out of there and they
[49:44] were the ones that the spirit in the
[49:46] midst of the people they were the ones
[49:48] that were right there saying oh you know
[49:50] what you've led us out here to kill us
[49:52] in the wilderness you you deceived us
[49:55] you brought us out here to die we wish
[49:57] we were back in egypt when we left with
[50:00] you we were just looking for something
[50:02] novel we were looking for something
[50:03] different we were looking for some kind
[50:05] of freedom from do it to do whatever we
[50:07] want but you've brought us out here see
[50:09] they became the twin to the movement and
[50:12] we'd say all those terrible people but
[50:14] some of them was the preachers
[50:21] come on we we get out here and and uh
[50:23] you know i mean i'm sure nobody thought
[50:26] abiram was a bad guy
[50:32] nobody thought my brother and sister
[50:34] that that person they were sitting in
[50:36] fellowship with
[50:38] was trying to lead them astray
[50:40] in fact the spirit of the day brings it
[50:42] in such a way that light was cast that
[50:45] it was actually moses that is the
[50:48] problem
[50:50] not
[50:51] these ministries
[50:58] it's his fault
[51:00] but we have to stop and take a parallel
[51:02] in the scripture who did god cleave the
[51:04] earth and swallow
[51:08] moses had his mistakes don't you love
[51:09] how god brings these same parallels come
[51:11] down you can find moses mistakes but
[51:13] they were pretty open you don't find out
[51:16] you know three thousand later years
[51:17] later we discovered moses's you know
[51:20] hidden things no god just made it right
[51:23] out in the open we have a prophet that
[51:24] turns around says i lied i have a
[51:26] prophet that says he this and says this
[51:28] and it's all right on tape and and uh
[51:30] you and we'll touch on that in a minute
[51:31] don't let me get this side strike
[51:33] somebody's telling me just keep focused
[51:35] amen so what are we doing see if that
[51:38] isn't the truth there's something wrong
[51:39] and we are found as fault with false
[51:41] witnesses not only are we making
[51:43] ourselves miserable under a false
[51:45] pretense but we are deceiving others so
[51:48] as you look at this now uh it's pretty
[51:50] straightforward we're found deceivers of
[51:53] something we're talking about which
[51:55] isn't
[51:55] if he's just a myth
[51:59] if god's just a myth
[52:01] but the prophet of god took this a step
[52:03] further saints
[52:05] and this is why i made that early
[52:06] statement that i made to you see brother
[52:08] branham comes along and ties this if
[52:10] he's just a myth if there is no god if
[52:13] this whole thing called christianity is
[52:15] just a false fake thing that's just
[52:17] horrible and we're just deceiving
[52:19] ourselves but look what he tags on the
[52:21] back of that can somebody tell me
[52:25] if he's his historical god
[52:28] we're the same position as if he's a
[52:30] myth
[52:32] if we put him as a historical god
[52:36] heaven help us my brother and sister we
[52:38] want the power and demonstration of the
[52:39] holy ghost in our midst we don't want a
[52:42] historical story of jesus christ and the
[52:46] the holy ghost falling on the people on
[52:48] the day of pentecost is some kind of
[52:50] historical thing and people are like
[52:52] well we're looking for tongues of fire
[52:55] to come licking through the church and
[52:57] to do this and to do that but did you
[52:59] know my brother and sister we have had
[53:00] many a service here where tongues of
[53:02] fire have moved in our midst because
[53:04] that tongue of fire is the holy ghost
[53:07] and as he comes down and deals with
[53:09] hearts brings repentance brings
[53:11] revelation changes lives my brother and
[53:13] sister just because we don't see it with
[53:15] our eyes
[53:17] now many years ago when we were in the
[53:19] other church we had a couple that was
[53:20] visiting us and and they were so excited
[53:23] right in the in the service they got so
[53:25] excited and they they were just so they
[53:28] just couldn't wait to tell us and after
[53:30] church they're like brother paul we were
[53:31] sitting there and we saw licks of fire
[53:34] moving across the platform
[53:36] and it'd be easy to say you know what i
[53:38] i think they're
[53:40] hallucinating
[53:42] right
[53:43] go on saints are you with me
[53:46] nobody
[53:47] felt a great shiver nobody
[53:49] but you see i'm not going to doubt that
[53:51] couple god was speaking to them and
[53:53] truly he was because after the fact we
[53:55] got to know them a little bit they
[53:57] shared things and how that little words
[53:59] you might say words of wisdom words of
[54:01] knowledge was put down into their life
[54:04] answers to things in their life and to
[54:06] them they say i saw a licks of fire on
[54:09] the platform that's good my brother and
[54:11] sister we'll never doubt that because we
[54:14] know that the holy ghost is promised to
[54:16] be here right he said where two or three
[54:18] are gathered in my name i will be in the
[54:21] midst of you and right there in
[54:22] revelation 1 says that he was a fire
[54:27] but you see we get so focused in what
[54:29] our idea of the day of pentecost must
[54:31] have looked like
[54:34] and we try to duplicate that
[54:38] without
[54:40] actually
[54:41] duplicating that
[54:43] which means to get what they got
[54:47] we have to get to where they
[54:50] were at
[54:51] and that is not to go search the streets
[54:53] until we find that building
[54:56] and climb the steps
[54:58] it's for us to get in a place we are so
[55:01] desperate
[55:03] to be in the presence of god
[55:05] that we sacrifice
[55:07] everything else
[55:09] to be in his presence
[55:11] you know that's a hard thing in the day
[55:12] let's just let's let the rubber hit the
[55:14] road it's a hard thing to do in our day
[55:15] my brother and sister satan's very very
[55:18] adept brother jason walked i hope you
[55:20] don't mind me saying this brother jason
[55:21] but brother jason walked in the office
[55:24] and i said how are you tonight brother
[55:25] and he goes the devil knew it was church
[55:27] tonight
[55:30] and that's the truth
[55:31] that's the truth see so then he just he
[55:34] has every little malfunction that he can
[55:36] throw every little thing in the road
[55:38] every little stumbling stone in every
[55:40] little circumstance
[55:46] what good is a historical christ if he
[55:48] isn't the same today
[55:50] well good as a god of moses if he isn't
[55:52] the same god today what good does it do
[55:55] to take your canary bird and feed him
[55:58] fine vitamins to make him have pretty
[56:00] feathers and good strong wings then keep
[56:02] him in a cage see it doesn't do him any
[56:05] good we talk about how great god was
[56:09] and then don't say he's the same today
[56:12] see that's why we should have a strong
[56:14] positive confession about these things
[56:17] he's my healer he's my provider you can
[56:20] fill in the blank we should take the
[56:22] position even if you don't oh
[56:25] do any of you go by feelings
[56:29] go ahead raise your hands
[56:33] we go by feelings
[56:36] i didn't feel like preaching tonight
[56:39] but everybody else has deserted us
[56:43] that made me feel even worse
[56:46] no that isn't we can't go by feelings
[56:49] because if we were going by feelings we
[56:51] would all be home right now with the
[56:52] sheep pulled over our head
[56:55] woe is me
[56:58] but we couldn't say he's forsaken us
[57:00] because his word says i'll never forsake
[57:02] you so we're not liars so we can't
[57:05] actually carry even the devil's message
[57:08] out to its completion because there's
[57:10] something inside of us that can't say
[57:12] something contrary to the word
[57:15] so even when the devil's trying to make
[57:17] you feel like nobody loves you nobody
[57:19] cares nobody this nobody this no no you
[57:22] can't go there because jesus christ
[57:24] himself god himself said i will never
[57:27] leave you nor forsake you so we cannot
[57:29] say there in all honesty god's forsaken
[57:32] me
[57:33] why because there's something inside you
[57:36] that says i can't speak contrary to the
[57:38] word
[57:40] amen
[57:42] we're caged up let's see
[57:44] we talk about how great god was and they
[57:46] don't say he's the same today then
[57:48] there's something wrong we're caged up
[57:50] somewhere and that's that's a false
[57:52] conception
[57:54] of what god is the bible plainly says
[57:57] he's the same can we say that together
[57:59] he's the same
[58:01] and that means
[58:03] he's the same
[58:06] and he's just as he was he hasn't
[58:08] changed one bit and he's the same
[58:10] yesterday today and forever can someone
[58:13] say amen to that
[58:14] hallelujah now as we look at this and we
[58:17] just recognize my brother and sister if
[58:20] he's just a myth or historical god then
[58:23] we literally will come to a place in our
[58:26] life as we have seen others not judging
[58:28] them just stating facts we have seen
[58:30] others come to a place that they no
[58:32] longer trust god those who used to cry
[58:34] in the presence of god stand before you
[58:37] today and say i don't even believe
[58:38] there's a god
[58:40] you see what happened god got moved from
[58:42] being real to them satan blurred the
[58:45] image and he come down and he then
[58:47] became historical historical god first
[58:52] which means he did that a long time ago
[58:54] but he doesn't do that anymore
[58:56] and then
[58:58] as faith ebbs
[59:00] we move from he doesn't do that anymore
[59:03] to there is no god
[59:06] and we know young men that have done
[59:08] that i'm thinking names and i won't name
[59:10] them but i've seen young men make that
[59:12] i've seen them been right there before
[59:14] when it's crying out to the lord
[59:16] and then a few short years and
[59:18] circumstances come and they'll tell you
[59:20] there's no such thing as a god
[59:23] we live once we die
[59:25] we're ashes dust gone
[59:28] see how it works satan knows
[59:31] because you see
[59:33] he's got to someone who's been in the
[59:35] presence of god he's got to move
[59:37] he doesn't just take him from serving
[59:39] god to a myth
[59:41] they've got to take him through this
[59:43] pattern
[59:45] and turn him into a historical god
[59:47] that's
[59:48] history
[59:49] that's long ago
[59:51] that happens oftentimes when people are
[59:53] looking for the spirit of the age which
[59:56] is uh um we want instant gratification
[59:59] in other words i'll get down on my knees
[1:00:00] tonight and i will pray and i expect an
[1:00:02] answer tomorrow
[1:00:04] but what happened when we pray
[1:00:07] sometimes day to week months
[1:00:10] heaven forbid
[1:00:11] years
[1:00:13] for an answer
[1:00:18] do we have faith enough to hang on
[1:00:21] is this
[1:00:22] historical god historical enough
[1:00:26] to just keep on keeping on
[1:00:29] or
[1:00:30] will we just let it become a myth
[1:00:33] i prayed
[1:00:34] he was angry with me he never answered
[1:00:37] my prayers
[1:00:39] it is strange i don't know if you've
[1:00:40] ever had this happen
[1:00:42] but sometimes god will answer a prayer
[1:00:44] in such a fashion
[1:00:48] that we literally have to stumble over
[1:00:50] the fact that he's answered it
[1:00:53] god's already come on the scene and
[1:00:55] because no lights lit up
[1:00:57] and the bank didn't call and say
[1:00:59] somebody's just deposited a million
[1:01:00] dollars in your checking account
[1:01:03] we we don't think god's answered our
[1:01:05] prayer only to find out down the road
[1:01:06] when i say stumble on it as we go down
[1:01:09] the road all of a sudden you know how
[1:01:10] good hindsight is do any of you know how
[1:01:12] good hindsight is hindsight is so good
[1:01:15] somebody said it's 20 20. but i've heard
[1:01:18] another guy say it's absolutely 2010
[1:01:21] because it is so accurate you can look
[1:01:23] back and see and imagine how you feel i
[1:01:26] know this firsthand a firsthand
[1:01:27] experience you look back amen when i
[1:01:30] wasn't serving god i used to put all
[1:01:31] kinds of things before the lord and you
[1:01:33] know sometimes you you just throw little
[1:01:35] things out there and its insincerity
[1:01:38] saints but it's really not correct
[1:01:40] according to the word but then god goes
[1:01:42] ahead and answers that anyhow i'll just
[1:01:45] give you a brief story i i was just
[1:01:47] really struggling i i would i would i
[1:01:50] would you know say i'm i'm going to
[1:01:52] serve the lord i'm going to serve the
[1:01:53] lord and then things would happen and i
[1:01:54] would slip back from that i was antelope
[1:01:57] hunting up in the pacima roy out chalice
[1:02:00] country and and going through just a
[1:02:03] really low spot in my life
[1:02:05] and uh i'm up there hunting and and uh
[1:02:08] was said you come up here and i know
[1:02:11] where the antelope are and i'll i'll
[1:02:12] help you
[1:02:14] and i got up there and he basically said
[1:02:16] i'm too busy doing what i'm doing to
[1:02:17] help you just go off and do your own
[1:02:19] thing
[1:02:20] and so i was a little discouraged from
[1:02:22] that and
[1:02:23] and you know i was out there and i'd
[1:02:25] walked miles i'd done that i sweated i
[1:02:27] crawled through the cactus i've done all
[1:02:29] these kind of things and i was out there
[1:02:31] and i just said lord if you love me you
[1:02:34] talk about now such a despicable
[1:02:38] irresponsible should have been slapped
[1:02:41] silly kind of prayer
[1:02:45] lord
[1:02:46] if you love me
[1:02:49] you'll give me
[1:02:50] an handle
[1:02:54] now if our children
[1:02:57] stood in front of us and said mom and
[1:02:58] dad if you really love me you would let
[1:03:02] me drink all the pop
[1:03:04] i want
[1:03:06] we'd say i i really love you you're not
[1:03:09] going to drink any pot
[1:03:11] that's more the human response right but
[1:03:13] you know what god did the very next day
[1:03:15] the lord gives me an antelope
[1:03:17] and i was so excited about shooting a
[1:03:19] nice antelope i call him different names
[1:03:21] i've called him everything from fred to
[1:03:23] edward or whatever but
[1:03:25] uh he's still hanging in the house there
[1:03:27] you know
[1:03:28] and uh did i stop and thank god for that
[1:03:33] can any of you guessed the answer
[1:03:37] you see my
[1:03:39] approach was so vain
[1:03:43] god come in such a fashion
[1:03:46] he answered the prayer
[1:03:48] everything was done according
[1:03:51] in 24 hours
[1:03:54] and it took time for me to wake up one
[1:03:57] day looking
[1:03:59] back
[1:04:01] and say you know what the lord gave me
[1:04:02] that antelope
[1:04:05] and i never even said thank you
[1:04:10] you see god's good because instead of
[1:04:12] condemning me for that
[1:04:14] he stirred my heart chastised me
[1:04:16] and even though as quite a ways down the
[1:04:18] road i looked back and i said lord
[1:04:20] forgive me but thank you
[1:04:22] because even something like that now you
[1:04:25] say brother paul that's wonderful you
[1:04:26] got an answer in 24 hours my brother and
[1:04:28] sister you'd be surprised how many
[1:04:30] answers god gives us
[1:04:32] that we're so caught up in our self we
[1:04:34] don't even
[1:04:36] acknowledge i don't know why i'm even
[1:04:38] talking about that
[1:04:42] now look
[1:04:46] brother branham says here
[1:04:48] the last of this quote
[1:04:54] there must be
[1:04:58] excuse me let me finish
[1:05:00] and now we have today in this day and
[1:05:03] this time just like we did in his day in
[1:05:05] old days we have our own thought of it
[1:05:07] but surely if there is any way in the
[1:05:09] world that we could truly know we'd have
[1:05:11] to find out what he was and then find
[1:05:14] out what he was in other ages remember
[1:05:16] the bible said he's the same yesterday
[1:05:18] today and forever so we'll have to find
[1:05:20] out what he is
[1:05:22] out of other ages to know what he was in
[1:05:25] the age that he walked on earth the age
[1:05:27] before he walked on earth and the age
[1:05:29] after he was on earth and left the earth
[1:05:31] and we'll have to find out what he was
[1:05:34] to know what he is today
[1:05:37] so now you know the prophet of god i
[1:05:39] read that quote to you and maybe you
[1:05:40] won't remember it uh but brother branham
[1:05:43] was declaring he said
[1:05:45] you have to search out
[1:05:47] you have to you have to search out you
[1:05:49] can't just sit back you have to search
[1:05:52] out and so this is kind of the thought
[1:05:54] train that i was following see as you
[1:05:56] have to know what he is today always
[1:05:57] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:05:59] and forever now but in otherwise we'll
[1:06:02] have to go back and search out to see
[1:06:04] whatever he was so we can't just take a
[1:06:07] superficial that well he's the same
[1:06:10] yesterday today and forever okay do we
[1:06:13] really know what he was we really
[1:06:15] studied and prayed about it and and come
[1:06:18] imagine the woman with the blood issue
[1:06:20] i have to believe with all my heart that
[1:06:22] she had prayed a lot of prayers
[1:06:25] but there was something stirred in her
[1:06:27] that she got up another day of her life
[1:06:30] maybe now she's bankrupt maybe now she's
[1:06:33] weak because she has this this issue
[1:06:36] but she's prayed another prayer and she
[1:06:40] proceeds to go because she believes
[1:06:42] there's an answer so she didn't sit back
[1:06:44] and say i'm giving up she still pursued
[1:06:47] it with every bit of energy and life
[1:06:49] that was within her so see we got to go
[1:06:51] back and search out to see whatever he
[1:06:54] was and i just want to take this now you
[1:06:57] see my brother and sister the key is
[1:06:59] executing the correct kind of search
[1:07:02] now we live in a world where things are
[1:07:04] on the internet right so you can just uh
[1:07:06] you can say well i'm gonna search
[1:07:08] something out well just go ahead type
[1:07:10] william branham see that's not really
[1:07:12] who the message is to you and i is it
[1:07:14] it's not really he's he's a messenger to
[1:07:16] the day but he is not our message our
[1:07:19] message is jesus christ but you type in
[1:07:22] william branham and you will find all
[1:07:25] kinds of information all the way from
[1:07:27] encouraging to discouraging and you will
[1:07:30] find testimonies of people that were
[1:07:32] believing till they look and now they
[1:07:34] can't believe to those that something in
[1:07:37] their heart says i don't care what this
[1:07:38] garbage is i'm gonna believe there's
[1:07:40] something speaking to me
[1:07:43] maybe i'm the one with the blood issue
[1:07:45] maybe i'm the one at the well and it's
[1:07:47] not about what research or those around
[1:07:49] me have said but it's about what god is
[1:07:51] dealing with in my own heart and so you
[1:07:54] know you you start to uh search and and
[1:07:57] the problem is my brother and sister is
[1:07:59] often times humans they go and they
[1:08:02] start to search this one's writings and
[1:08:04] they go and search this one's writings
[1:08:07] and and you know they're trying to find
[1:08:09] uh information when the true search
[1:08:12] should be us sighing and crying for god
[1:08:15] in our life it should be us hungering
[1:08:17] and thirsting for righteousness it
[1:08:20] should not be the opinion of this man or
[1:08:22] the opinion of that man because you see
[1:08:25] they're in their own prejudiced state
[1:08:30] now you can take this and no doubt you
[1:08:32] have
[1:08:33] read this but my brother and sister
[1:08:35] if you want to search things out of
[1:08:38] opinions go
[1:08:39] type in the words of david harrell
[1:08:44] and you will find that many a person
[1:08:46] writing in the world we live in today
[1:08:49] writing of whether william branham's
[1:08:51] ministry was of god or not they quote
[1:08:55] david harrell
[1:08:58] but does david harrell have it right
[1:09:01] see david harrell says that william
[1:09:03] branham was a man of god
[1:09:05] but went off in the end
[1:09:08] so if you are looking to david harrell's
[1:09:10] writings you're going to go oh my
[1:09:12] started this great movement started this
[1:09:15] supernatural recognized by all these
[1:09:17] ministries
[1:09:18] oh it's a cult
[1:09:21] and he went off in the end
[1:09:23] oh i'm away from that
[1:09:26] but let's go search where do we search
[1:09:28] do we go over here now pardon me for
[1:09:30] using these words but we go over here to
[1:09:32] somebody that's practically worshipping
[1:09:34] brother branham and ask them no you're
[1:09:36] not going to get the correct answer from
[1:09:37] them either what we've got to do is
[1:09:40] search the scriptures is what the
[1:09:42] scripture says search the scripture amen
[1:09:46] get into the spirit and pray about these
[1:09:49] things and god said i'll answer you amen
[1:09:52] so you see it's just because someone's
[1:09:54] been used as a point of reference for
[1:09:57] many writings doesn't mean what they
[1:10:00] have declared is correct
[1:10:04] scare yourself
[1:10:06] go see what wikipedia says
[1:10:10] now i want you as you type in wikipedia
[1:10:14] to compare what wikipedia says
[1:10:17] against your own personal experience
[1:10:19] with god
[1:10:21] and you'll find that all of this stuff
[1:10:24] about wikipedia in wikipedia and all of
[1:10:26] these references my brother and sister i
[1:10:29] just read i just read these things as
[1:10:31] part of my study i'm not necessarily
[1:10:32] encouraging you to do that
[1:10:34] but i read this and i thought i wouldn't
[1:10:36] follow that message either
[1:10:40] that's something i hope you see the
[1:10:42] humor of this i'm reading wikipedia and
[1:10:44] i'm like i wouldn't follow that
[1:10:46] but you see it's not a true reference of
[1:10:49] what it really is and now i want you to
[1:10:52] take this and get away from all these
[1:10:54] negative things but i want you to take
[1:10:55] this right back our lord jesus is
[1:10:57] walking on the earth and some scholars
[1:10:59] over here and he taps into wikipedia
[1:11:02] it's got a hot spot and he taps into
[1:11:04] that and he's reading about this man
[1:11:06] called jesus christ and determines it's
[1:11:08] got to be be elizabeth
[1:11:10] this does not fit what we are looking
[1:11:14] for
[1:11:16] so their point of reference
[1:11:18] no longer become the word of god
[1:11:20] it become
[1:11:21] something
[1:11:23] as it would be referenced wikipedia
[1:11:28] and i couldn't follow something like
[1:11:29] that
[1:11:30] so they shut their mind off
[1:11:32] and they walk away
[1:11:34] forgetting
[1:11:35] now i'm talking about true experiences
[1:11:37] of people i've dealt with forgetting
[1:11:39] what god had already done for them
[1:11:42] they have forgot the things of god that
[1:11:45] has already happened in their life
[1:11:48] prayers answered
[1:11:49] discernment of spirits and words of
[1:11:52] knowledge that have come but because of
[1:11:54] these points of reference they they just
[1:11:56] walk away but you see my brother and
[1:11:58] sister what happens and you say brother
[1:12:00] paul you're making a lot of effort upon
[1:12:02] this i want you to see my brother and
[1:12:03] sister what we've got to do even taking
[1:12:06] this from this quote now but in other
[1:12:07] words we have to go back and search it
[1:12:10] out to see
[1:12:11] whatever he was
[1:12:15] now if
[1:12:16] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:12:18] forever
[1:12:20] we could be that woman at the well
[1:12:22] and if we are a daughter of god as it
[1:12:24] were the bride of christ he will come
[1:12:26] down and he will discern the issue in
[1:12:29] our life and he will speak to it and
[1:12:31] we'll know this is the messiah
[1:12:34] we won't have to question we won't need
[1:12:35] to go on the bible answer man we won't
[1:12:38] have to write to some deal over here or
[1:12:40] go find a theologian about which form of
[1:12:43] the the hebrew that we need to follow
[1:12:45] just write a very interesting article
[1:12:48] there's now a controversy between the
[1:12:50] five main dialects of hebrew and they're
[1:12:53] arguing about what these scriptures mean
[1:12:55] over whether it's this one this one this
[1:12:57] one this
[1:12:58] and so that's wonderful that's good
[1:13:00] while they're doing that i want to
[1:13:02] search out the holy spirit i want the
[1:13:04] power of almighty god to come down in
[1:13:06] our midst in a real form in a real way
[1:13:10] amen not a theological not an argument
[1:13:12] but the reality of jesus christ
[1:13:15] amen
[1:13:17] because you see if we're going to go
[1:13:19] search out all these opinions and we're
[1:13:21] going to search all these ideologies
[1:13:25] why don't we just go ask the devil what
[1:13:26] he thinks of the holy ghost
[1:13:29] imagine the answer we're going to get
[1:13:30] unnecessary
[1:13:32] way off on a limb
[1:13:34] not not real never happened you don't
[1:13:36] need it just go to church
[1:13:41] well he knows that you're religious
[1:13:44] so he's not going to tell you not to go
[1:13:45] to church because he knows you're going
[1:13:46] to back up from that but he's just going
[1:13:48] to water it so down it's like just sign
[1:13:50] your name
[1:13:51] no come on we search it out what's
[1:13:53] what's the word say
[1:13:55] huh
[1:13:56] amen
[1:13:59] now let's look here hope you don't mind
[1:14:01] to my uh tonight i just you know i just
[1:14:03] kind of more i don't know what you'd
[1:14:05] call it teaching i just want you to look
[1:14:08] at this you know stir your minds up
[1:14:10] now the revelation book of symbols
[1:14:12] brother brahm says jesus
[1:14:15] watch three things which was which is
[1:14:17] and which is to come
[1:14:19] the same yesterday today and forever a
[1:14:21] little later on in the scripture the
[1:14:23] next chapter he said out of the same
[1:14:25] chapter he said i am he
[1:14:27] that was dead
[1:14:29] and is alive again forevermore
[1:14:32] so he is clearly identifying himself
[1:14:36] you know isn't it amazing when we talk
[1:14:37] about a near kinsman redeemer
[1:14:40] now
[1:14:41] to me it was a great revelation when i
[1:14:43] my eyes were open and i saw that and you
[1:14:45] know here's boaz acknowledging to the
[1:14:47] world there is one nearer than i
[1:14:50] but i want this girl to be my wife so
[1:14:52] much then i'm willing to go out in
[1:14:55] public at the risk
[1:14:57] that this near kinsman would say
[1:15:00] that girl's beautiful
[1:15:02] if i redeem her
[1:15:04] i redeem naomi
[1:15:06] i get this field and that field and this
[1:15:08] thing and that thing and i get all of
[1:15:10] this i just have to
[1:15:12] make a room for naomi in the house and
[1:15:15] you know put up with the old lady for a
[1:15:18] while and
[1:15:20] sorry for putting it that way
[1:15:24] boaz says it's worth the risk
[1:15:27] but look at that very key response of
[1:15:30] that near kinsman redeemer
[1:15:32] lest
[1:15:33] i would mar
[1:15:35] my testimony
[1:15:37] what was the testimony
[1:15:40] the devil
[1:15:41] knows that resurrection life is real
[1:15:46] he just didn't have a revelation of
[1:15:48] whether it applied to him or not
[1:15:50] there's no way he's going to lay his
[1:15:52] life down
[1:15:54] imagine
[1:15:55] if on television as it were the devil
[1:15:57] said i'm going to prove to you guys once
[1:15:59] and for all
[1:16:01] and then he's just gone
[1:16:03] see he's not going to take that chance
[1:16:05] and that revelation of the near kinsman
[1:16:07] redeemer shows that our lord jesus
[1:16:09] christ as a boaz was able to take that
[1:16:12] and signify and say whatever it takes to
[1:16:14] redeem her i'm willing to pay that price
[1:16:18] oh i tell you i remember as just kind of
[1:16:20] a on off believer uh you know how it
[1:16:23] just struck me one day i thought there
[1:16:25] it is the confidence of jesus christ was
[1:16:27] that he's gonna redeem me that he laid
[1:16:30] his life down without a squall or a
[1:16:32] squabble or anything like that because
[1:16:34] he knew
[1:16:35] hallelujah that the word would come to
[1:16:38] pass and he would rise again
[1:16:41] oh my i tell you it just stirs my heart
[1:16:43] and i hope it serves yours the same way
[1:16:45] as i was alive again forevermore i have
[1:16:48] the keys
[1:16:49] not some church
[1:16:51] or peter or his cathedral at rome or an
[1:16:54] episcopalian or whatever it is got a key
[1:16:57] that's the key to fellowship
[1:16:59] see there's a problem my brother and
[1:17:00] sister is even happening around this
[1:17:02] message is people are more worried about
[1:17:04] having a key of fellowship we we are
[1:17:06] churches associated with this group and
[1:17:08] and this ministry identifies with us and
[1:17:10] our pastor is friends with who
[1:17:13] come on that's not what it's about
[1:17:14] saints that's not what it's about it's
[1:17:16] us having a relationship with jesus
[1:17:18] christ and brother ram says here see
[1:17:21] that's all just a key to fellowship but
[1:17:23] i have speaking as it would jesus christ
[1:17:26] i have the keys of death and hell amen
[1:17:28] oh don't you love him today he has the
[1:17:31] key to your joy he has the key to your
[1:17:33] happiness he has the key of your
[1:17:35] deliverance from the grave i have the
[1:17:37] key of death and hell hades i can unlock
[1:17:40] the supernatural
[1:17:42] hallelujah you want to see some
[1:17:43] supernatural saints we need to just get
[1:17:45] in the presence of god and let him
[1:17:47] unlock the supernatural we ought not sit
[1:17:49] back and say well until i see god do
[1:17:51] this and that in our church i'm just
[1:17:53] going to sit here and wonder if this is
[1:17:55] a real holy ghost no no you're the
[1:17:57] hindrance
[1:17:58] you're the hindrance become the
[1:18:00] attraction of the holy ghost

[1:18:06] unlock the natural i got the key of
[1:18:08] death and hell here in my hand oh there
[1:18:10] is a fountain open come take the waters
[1:18:13] of life freely oh isn't that beautiful
[1:18:16] oh so we're looking at this and
[1:18:18] realizing now that this key is not just
[1:18:22] my brother and sister this is not just a
[1:18:25] key of eternal life
[1:18:28] it is a key to be applied right here in
[1:18:30] this life
[1:18:31] day by day
[1:18:35] you can be like paul and be on a ditch
[1:18:37] bank and
[1:18:38] lord i have no friends
[1:18:41] woe
[1:18:43] unto paul
[1:18:48] and then have the lord show you this
[1:18:53] hmm forgive me lord
[1:18:56] it isn't about this see
[1:18:58] i'm looking for joy
[1:19:00] happiness friendship
[1:19:02] come on i'm kind of speaking in that
[1:19:04] third person realm so y'all i mean if
[1:19:06] i've pointed at you it wouldn't be
[1:19:08] polite right i'm trying to break that
[1:19:09] habit
[1:19:11] but you see we we got to realize that
[1:19:14] this key
[1:19:16] he's got the key
[1:19:18] he's got the key he's got the key
[1:19:22] we're not going to find the key in
[1:19:23] ourself until we find him
[1:19:25] then we have the key
[1:19:27] amen
[1:19:28] oh
[1:19:30] i hope you guys are getting this
[1:19:33] now
[1:19:34] so we look at this
[1:19:36] excuse me where i am
[1:19:42] did we forget something alex i i don't
[1:19:45] see the siege help possess the gate of
[1:19:47] his enemy
[1:19:49] um excuse me on that we'll just go ahead
[1:19:51] don't worry about it
[1:19:53] so in the seed shall possess the gate of
[1:19:55] his enemy brother branham says this
[1:19:56] joshua didn't think how wide jordan was
[1:20:00] or how muddy it was said gather
[1:20:02] yourselves together and sanctify
[1:20:04] yourself and take the ark of god and go
[1:20:06] forward and he possessed the gate of the
[1:20:09] enemy why because he was taking a
[1:20:12] promised people
[1:20:14] to a promised land by a promise of god
[1:20:18] isn't that beautiful a promised people
[1:20:21] to a promised land by a promise of god
[1:20:24] amen and was the children of abraham
[1:20:28] that makes a baptist feel like shouting
[1:20:30] abraham seed still possessed the gate of
[1:20:33] the enemy yet he crossed over the jordan
[1:20:36] we got to come to the jordans too
[1:20:38] sometimes all these great warriors had
[1:20:40] to die because they were born in sin
[1:20:43] born by sexual desire shaped in iniquity
[1:20:45] come to the world speaking lies but
[1:20:47] being the promise being abraham's seed
[1:20:50] by the promise that god gave abraham
[1:20:53] they subdued kingdoms and wrought
[1:20:56] righteousness and stopped the mouth of
[1:20:57] lions and escaped the edge of the sword
[1:21:00] and move back the waters and raise the
[1:21:02] dead for they were the seed of abraham
[1:21:05] by a promise by god himself and he would
[1:21:08] do for them oh that ought to make us
[1:21:10] shout like a baptist amen then finally
[1:21:13] one day come the royal seed not borned
[1:21:15] of a man but conceived in the womb of a
[1:21:17] virgin by god himself with no sexual
[1:21:20] desire holy spirit born and when the
[1:21:22] holy ghost overshadowed a little virgin
[1:21:24] and conceived in there the true seed of
[1:21:27] abraham look at this in the spiritual
[1:21:29] type saints the faith that abraham had
[1:21:32] in god god made a promise of this seed
[1:21:36] born to virgin birth then he had power
[1:21:39] over all the gates of the enemy
[1:21:42] come on let's get this over in the
[1:21:44] spiritual realm and look what it is to
[1:21:45] you my brother sister i'm telling you
[1:21:47] right now sorry brother trevor sister
[1:21:49] carrie but no man ever come and
[1:21:51] instilled the faith in the word of god
[1:21:52] in you it was god himself he planted the
[1:21:56] seed he watered the seed he shone the
[1:21:58] sun upon that seed and birthed it
[1:22:02] and that's why a real true son or
[1:22:04] daughter of god no man on this earth can
[1:22:06] ever take that from them that's why as
[1:22:09] it is the stories we're hearing his
[1:22:11] people will not deny him we're thinking
[1:22:13] that's
[1:22:14] a different day
[1:22:17] it is not a different day
[1:22:19] it is this day
[1:22:21] and god is bringing it to pass and
[1:22:23] raising it up that we can have young
[1:22:25] children so filled with god they will
[1:22:27] not deny him
[1:22:29] oh but that's over there in them
[1:22:30] countries where they don't have much and
[1:22:32] they this that well praise the lord
[1:22:35] what they do have is faith maybe maybe
[1:22:38] we need a little less comfort
[1:22:41] and a little more of the lord
[1:22:44] amen
[1:22:45] see
[1:22:46] when he was on earth he had the gates of
[1:22:48] sickness
[1:22:51] in his own power he spoke to the sick
[1:22:53] and the gates opened up and they walked
[1:22:55] out free he had the keys to the gate of
[1:22:57] leprosy of affliction of
[1:22:59] temptations they smacked him on the face
[1:23:01] and done everything by pulling his beard
[1:23:03] uh uh from his face and spinning upon
[1:23:06] him and trying to get him to do
[1:23:08] something that was wrong he said i could
[1:23:10] speak to my father and straight away
[1:23:12] he'd send me 12 legions of angels he
[1:23:15] could do it
[1:23:17] but he had the power why
[1:23:20] he had to taste death
[1:23:24] you imagine
[1:23:26] can you even imagine what it'd be like
[1:23:30] i'm sorry i don't mean to insert myself
[1:23:32] into this but i
[1:23:34] have caused grievous injury to my own
[1:23:37] body
[1:23:39] and lived with the consequence of
[1:23:41] grievous injury
[1:23:42] and there's something in the back of my
[1:23:44] mind saints
[1:23:48] that says in the flesh
[1:23:50] in other words jesus christ
[1:23:52] that man of flesh
[1:23:56] the pain he felt
[1:24:00] it would have taken
[1:24:01] something supernatural
[1:24:04] to have said
[1:24:06] release me from this
[1:24:09] and imagine all those people who thought
[1:24:11] all them soldiers and all that crowd
[1:24:12] that thought they were so powerful and
[1:24:14] so in control would have been like if
[1:24:16] jesus had called those angels upon them
[1:24:19] it would have been a great slaughter
[1:24:23] but he bore that within himself because
[1:24:25] he says
[1:24:26] and i'm going to just bring it down to
[1:24:28] us
[1:24:28] i've got a bride in laodicea
[1:24:31] that needs to have a key
[1:24:34] that will deliver her
[1:24:36] in their day
[1:24:38] and i
[1:24:39] am going to give them that key i will
[1:24:41] not make it just figurative of writing i
[1:24:44] will not make it a myth or make it
[1:24:46] history i will make it so real
[1:24:49] that they will
[1:24:51] know they can take that key
[1:24:53] and they can put it into
[1:24:56] faith
[1:24:57] and release it
[1:24:58] and overcome
[1:25:00] such
[1:25:01] a wicked day
[1:25:04] see he's there he knows my brother and
[1:25:07] sister he can unlock the supernatural
[1:25:10] unlock the natural whatever is necessary
[1:25:13] it's right there he can do that
[1:25:15] and he said i'm going to do it for them
[1:25:17] oh isn't that beautiful i tell you it
[1:25:19] stirs my heart
[1:25:20] amen he had to taste death all these
[1:25:23] other warriors had done victories and so
[1:25:25] forth but he had to conquer that one who
[1:25:28] could not be conquered by these men
[1:25:30] think about all of the men through this
[1:25:32] scripture and great warriors that fought
[1:25:35] for god and overcome enemies and not one
[1:25:38] of them could go no matter how great
[1:25:40] they was and overcome death
[1:25:43] not one of them could take that
[1:25:46] oh my
[1:25:50] when they killed him on calvary his soul
[1:25:53] ascended into hell and i hope you don't
[1:25:54] mind because i find great joy in this
[1:25:58] and he turned the keys on
[1:26:00] hell down there and unlocked the place
[1:26:02] and took over
[1:26:05] i'm sorry i just there's something
[1:26:08] inside me just bubbles up i can see them
[1:26:10] walk down amongst them devils and
[1:26:12] they're there and there's the devil
[1:26:13] standing there saying how we got you and
[1:26:16] he reached out snatched those keys off
[1:26:18] of him and goes over there and unlocks
[1:26:20] death hell in the grave and the devil's
[1:26:23] saying whoa whoa whoa whoa you can't do
[1:26:25] that and he said oh yes i can you know
[1:26:27] who i am you know the authority i have
[1:26:31] and you know i am the word coming forth
[1:26:34] in power and majesty
[1:26:37] and the devil said no no no if you do
[1:26:39] that my whole plan is messed up
[1:26:41] you imagine i'm not trying to speak for
[1:26:43] god or add words to the word but i can
[1:26:45] see jesus christ just telling them i'm
[1:26:47] sorry your plan was your plan
[1:26:50] this plan
[1:26:52] is my plan
[1:26:53] and my plan

[1:27:09] whatever just as much as god made us in
[1:27:11] the natural that way he made this plan
[1:27:14] that you and i would be attracted to
[1:27:15] that i like dirt i like the smell of
[1:27:17] dirt i like all of these things
[1:27:19] pertaining as a word of the natural to
[1:27:21] dirt my brother and sister but there's
[1:27:23] something that's greater than any
[1:27:25] natural attraction i have and that is my
[1:27:27] attraction to the word

[1:27:31] morning i was no longer a farmer i i
[1:27:34] would say so be it my brother and sister
[1:27:36] if i got up in the morning and something
[1:27:38] was there to stop me from serving god i
[1:27:40] would say lord take me come quickly lord

[1:28:19] reason for us to have to overcome
[1:28:21] anything because it's already conquered
[1:28:26] how do you feel when you
[1:28:28] are still killing that one bit of your
[1:28:30] old flesh
[1:28:31] and you read a quote like this right
[1:28:33] here and he says there's nothing for you
[1:28:35] to conquer
[1:28:37] it's already done
[1:28:39] how can he say that brother trevor he
[1:28:41] didn't know paul hail it
[1:28:47] but jesus christ did
[1:28:50] and he says you know what
[1:28:52] this revelation that just keeps opening
[1:28:54] up to this old paul guy
[1:28:57] he thinks he's in a great battle of life
[1:28:59] and death but what he doesn't know is
[1:29:01] i've already conquered it
[1:29:02] he's actually just dealing
[1:29:04] with himself
[1:29:07] not even all the spirits of laodicea
[1:29:09] he's just dealing with himself
[1:29:13] in the greatest battle
[1:29:15] that's ever fought
[1:29:17] isn't that something god help us catch
[1:29:19] that revelation we get over our oh you
[1:29:22] know you ever hear somebody say that
[1:29:24] get over yourself
[1:29:27] usually that's not a very kind word
[1:29:29] right just get over yourself well i
[1:29:32] think the lord jesus is speaking to us
[1:29:34] tonight just get over yourself
[1:29:36] i've already conquered everything else
[1:29:38] i've already took care of everything
[1:29:40] else for you just get over yourself
[1:29:43] amen
[1:29:45] oh hallelujah
[1:29:48] hallelujah
[1:29:49] you know go home read this
[1:29:52] there's more there
[1:29:54] you see that original key that unlocked
[1:29:57] death hell in the grave
[1:29:59] also unlocked revelation
[1:30:00] [Music]
[1:30:02] god unlocking his word
[1:30:05] so
[1:30:06] can i read this last quote to you
[1:30:09] just another minute or two here i'll
[1:30:10] read fast
[1:30:12] now as we check some of these seeds
[1:30:13] let's think we think of the hebrew
[1:30:15] children i have here thinking of that on
[1:30:17] the hebrew children after they had been
[1:30:20] tested against
[1:30:21] image
[1:30:22] worship
[1:30:25] see how god covers all the different
[1:30:27] types
[1:30:28] of trials and struggles and whatever
[1:30:29] there is
[1:30:31] he had some tried by this and some tried
[1:30:34] by this
[1:30:35] shadrach and meshach
[1:30:38] they actually have more in common
[1:30:41] with our day than we think saints
[1:30:44] they
[1:30:46] were tried
[1:30:48] by the spirit
[1:30:49] of idolatry
[1:30:53] and we know by the opening of the word
[1:30:54] that the image that they were tried by
[1:30:56] was the prophet of their day daniel
[1:30:59] to bow down and worship that prophet
[1:31:02] to worship that image
[1:31:04] even told by the king who had been
[1:31:06] impressed by the great things that he
[1:31:07] saw you will worship this image because
[1:31:11] it was so close to god
[1:31:14] do you get this so close to god
[1:31:17] that they got this blurry vision and
[1:31:19] when they were looking at a prophet they
[1:31:21] thought they were looking at god
[1:31:24] because they were
[1:31:25] [Music]
[1:31:27] but if our vision clears and we're
[1:31:29] looking so closely at one another
[1:31:33] we're looking
[1:31:34] at god
[1:31:35] [Music]
[1:31:37] but you have to have the right
[1:31:38] revelation you have to have the right
[1:31:40] understanding
[1:31:42] thinking that on the hebrew children
[1:31:44] after they've been tested against image
[1:31:46] worship now you remember the king said
[1:31:48] whosoever will not bow down to this
[1:31:50] image shall be thrown into the fiery
[1:31:52] furnace now these children believe that
[1:31:54] god's word was right but they should not
[1:31:57] worship any kind of an image but when
[1:32:00] they come to the showdown and they were
[1:32:02] tested whether they would when all the
[1:32:04] rest of the children down there received
[1:32:07] and went to the worship
[1:32:08] imagine how they felt
[1:32:11] imagine saints come on we've journeyed
[1:32:14] together we've lived together we've
[1:32:15] worshiped together and you see brothers
[1:32:18] and sisters coming over here and an
[1:32:20] image has been raised before them and
[1:32:22] people are saying this is it this is it
[1:32:24] this is it and you're seeing those who
[1:32:27] are close to you
[1:32:29] maybe even family
[1:32:32] bowing down to an image
[1:32:34] and god says you know what
[1:32:37] i don't like that
[1:32:39] it's not what i called you for
[1:32:41] you're not idolaters
[1:32:43] i will break the spirit of idolatry and
[1:32:47] people are like well
[1:32:49] i want to fit in
[1:32:52] i want to fit in and after all
[1:32:55] it's the prophet
[1:32:58] of our day
[1:33:01] it's brother daniel
[1:33:03] i'm not
[1:33:05] worshiping the pope
[1:33:07] not worth worshiping this sports hero
[1:33:10] this gladiator
[1:33:13] he's a prophet
[1:33:14] [Music]
[1:33:17] hopefully i didn't say that too strongly
[1:33:22] and when all the rest of the children
[1:33:23] down there received and went to the
[1:33:24] worship they went right on in the way
[1:33:26] the king said
[1:33:28] they went with the popular thought of
[1:33:30] the day
[1:33:31] that they must do it
[1:33:34] saints we're not far removed in the day
[1:33:35] within it
[1:33:37] and when they were tested whether they
[1:33:38] would worship images
[1:33:41] or break the word of god they stayed
[1:33:43] true to the word
[1:33:44] regardless of the circumstances they
[1:33:46] stayed true to the word and when they
[1:33:48] throwed them into the fiery furnace i
[1:33:50] love these last words why i want to read
[1:33:52] this god's promise was fulfilled
[1:33:55] imagine saints if god give you
[1:33:57] revelation to understand that you being
[1:33:58] thrown in a fiery furnace was god's plan
[1:34:01] fulfilled
[1:34:03] wait
[1:34:04] wait just a second why would god want to
[1:34:06] throw me but does the scripture not say
[1:34:08] that
[1:34:09] fiery trials
[1:34:14] maybe we don't have one that we'd call a
[1:34:15] furnace but god will let you get throat
[1:34:17] in a fiery trial
[1:34:19] god's promise was fulfilled they
[1:34:21] possessed the gates of their enemy there
[1:34:22] was a fourth man standing in there
[1:34:28] with a key
[1:34:29] [Music]
[1:34:31] you see when the king looked in there
[1:34:32] and all those people looked in there and
[1:34:34] they saw the fourth man in the fire what
[1:34:36] they didn't see
[1:34:38] if you follow me here
[1:34:40] one of them was holding the key
[1:34:42] and he says you know what
[1:34:44] [Music]
[1:34:47] i'm gonna unlock
[1:34:49] all the heat from this fire
[1:34:51] the very heat that killed the best of
[1:34:53] their army to throw them in there
[1:34:56] was now rendered
[1:34:58] ineffective against the body of the
[1:35:01] believer
[1:35:02] oh i'll tell you what
[1:35:04] thank you lord
[1:35:06] and it could do nothing
[1:35:08] but set them free
[1:35:11] now you're going to say brother paul
[1:35:12] we're going through some hard trials
[1:35:14] well i'll tell you what i want you to do
[1:35:16] maybe maybe mom dad
[1:35:18] maybe husband wife whatever it is maybe
[1:35:20] you just want to go off find your own
[1:35:22] quiet time but if you're in a fiery
[1:35:24] trial right now i want you to go off in
[1:35:27] a back corner amen let's just say you go
[1:35:29] out in the garage and you just start
[1:35:32] practicing your thank you lords and your
[1:35:34] hallelujahs and and bless the name of
[1:35:36] the lord because you see you're fixing
[1:35:38] to get set free from something
[1:35:41] you're going through that trial god's
[1:35:43] not going to let you burn up in this
[1:35:44] trial called laodicea he's fixing to set
[1:35:48] you free so we ought to just stand
[1:35:50] tonight amen and just lift our hands up
[1:35:52] and say thank you lord for setting me
[1:35:55] free i'm facing some trials i went
[1:35:57] through some struggles lord but lord i
[1:36:00] am fixing to be set free can someone say
[1:36:03] hallelujah amen because you see it is
[1:36:07] nothing there but god's way of taking
[1:36:11] you and proving that i am in control i
[1:36:14] will set you free hallelujah there's
[1:36:16] many more quotes if you want to go find
[1:36:18] him where brother brown talks about that
[1:36:20] but i'm telling you my brother and
[1:36:22] sister it's about the trial it's about
[1:36:24] what you do in the midst of the trial
[1:36:27] and what the word has told us is we
[1:36:30] should bless the name of the lord in the
[1:36:32] midst of our fiery trials hallelujah
[1:36:36] let's stand and sing a song or two
[1:36:37] before we're dismissed i'm sorry i took
[1:36:40] just a little longer than i intended
[1:36:42] amen but look at this my brother and
[1:36:44] sister i i hope it's sort of your heart
[1:36:45] the way it stirs my hand all of these
[1:36:47] things that are happening all that's
[1:36:49] coming down we're looking at this this
[1:36:51] whole thing
[1:36:52] we call covet 19. we look at this and if
[1:36:55] we're not careful we'll go oh that's
[1:36:58] nothing but i can tell you the list
[1:37:01] of preachers alone
[1:37:03] around the world
[1:37:05] pastors alone around the world that have
[1:37:07] died
[1:37:08] in the last 12 months is a staggering
[1:37:10] list
[1:37:11] [Music]
[1:37:13] their brother shared a little deal
[1:37:15] showing right before
[1:37:18] right in the face of god taking
[1:37:21] out the leadership
[1:37:23] and israel coming down
[1:37:25] and saying what are we going to do now
[1:37:28] god raised them to a mighty victory
[1:37:31] you see sometimes god's got to take men
[1:37:34] out of the way for the people
[1:37:37] to realize it wasn't our pastor
[1:37:41] and i say this in humor tonight i'd like
[1:37:43] to live a little longer so don't put me
[1:37:45] up on that
[1:37:46] pedestal amen
[1:37:49] you see god will remove
[1:37:52] anything that hinders his bride
[1:37:54] from progressing forward in the word and
[1:37:57] i'm not saying that's the reason these
[1:37:58] brothers passed away brother just
[1:38:00] brought that up shared that little deal
[1:38:02] you look at this but around the world
[1:38:05] a staggering amount
[1:38:07] of ministers have passed away
[1:38:10] in the last few months
[1:38:13] did god just leave us here leadership
[1:38:16] without leadership i mean
[1:38:19] no sir
[1:38:21] [Music]
[1:38:24] amen
[1:38:25] it's the lord jesus christ this jehovah
[1:38:27] himself
[1:38:28] is our leadership hallelujah oh
[1:38:31] hallelujah
[1:38:34] there is
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:38:42] no one else can touch my heart like you
[1:38:46] do
[1:38:49] i could search for all the
[1:38:53] eternally
[1:38:55] lord and
[1:38:58] [Applause]
[1:38:59] [Music]
[1:39:05] there is

[1:39:25] [Music]
[1:39:31] [Music]
[1:39:34] hallelujah
[1:39:36] i know this was a little bit different
[1:39:37] tonight saints but
[1:39:41] just kind of wanted to just go through
[1:39:42] this just a little reminder as we read
[1:39:44] these things
[1:39:46] just look at this
[1:39:48] to realize that
[1:39:50] the key
[1:39:54] the original key
[1:39:55] [Music]
[1:39:57] unlocks
[1:40:00] and it has already unlocked the word in
[1:40:03] you
[1:40:05] so let that same key
[1:40:07] go before you
[1:40:10] make the rocky places smooth
[1:40:13] unlock the natural things of life
[1:40:16] unlock the supernatural things of life
[1:40:20] but most of all right the prophet of god
[1:40:22] said pray for revelation
[1:40:24] so let's let this key go
[1:40:26] and unlock revelation to us
[1:40:28] we don't need to just sit back and sorry
[1:40:30] i sometimes i batter on this because it
[1:40:33] bothers me a lot
[1:40:35] when i say bothers me i mean i just see
[1:40:37] this spirit very strong very prevalent
[1:40:39] people are like we're doing fine
[1:40:42] god sent a prophet
[1:40:44] that's good
[1:40:46] all through the ages god has
[1:40:48] taken prophets off the scene or study
[1:40:51] your scripture
[1:40:53] and let the people manifest the word of
[1:40:55] the prophet
[1:40:56] which is the word of god
[1:40:58] amen so let's take that key of
[1:41:01] revelation let it open revelation to us
[1:41:04] because we don't have to just sit back
[1:41:06] and say well i don't know what god's
[1:41:07] going to do but somehow we'll do it the
[1:41:09] word says
[1:41:10] that this message
[1:41:12] and this mystery of jesus christ will be
[1:41:14] revealed
[1:41:16] and that doesn't mean that it's in some
[1:41:17] printed form stored somewhere
[1:41:20] but it's revealed right here
[1:41:22] in flesh in the day that we live in
[1:41:25] hallelujah
[1:41:27] hallelujah
[1:41:29] the original life
[1:41:31] amen let's just sing that song as we're
[1:41:33] dismissed i got a list of songs so long
[1:41:36] as i wrote these down here just thinking
[1:41:38] about it but i tell you this song right
[1:41:40] here just really stirs my heart because
[1:41:43] this first verse right here is a sermon
[1:41:45] i could have just sang it and we could
[1:41:47] have dismissed amen
[1:41:49] hallelujah
[1:41:51] god's attributes were manifested
[1:41:55] to his pride in this
