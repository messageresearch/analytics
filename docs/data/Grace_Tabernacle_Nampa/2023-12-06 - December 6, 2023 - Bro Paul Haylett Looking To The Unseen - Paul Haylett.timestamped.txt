[20:54] F there is none like like
[21:04] you no one else can touch my heart like
[21:10] you
[21:14] do I could search for all
[21:20] eternity
[21:22] Lord and
[21:24] find there is none
[21:28] like you let's see that one more time as
[21:31] brother Paul
[21:34] comes oh there is none
[21:39] like
[21:45] you and no one else can touch my heart
[21:51] like you
[21:56] do I could serve search for all
[22:01] eternity
[22:03] Lord and
[22:06] find there is none like you let's all
[22:12] stand sing that one more
[22:16] time there is none like
[22:26] you for no no one else can touch my
[22:31] heart like you
[22:37] do
[22:40] I turn he
[22:44] Lord and
[22:47] find there is none like you let's sing
[22:53] that
[22:56] again there is none like
[23:07] you no one else can touch my heart like
[23:13] you
[23:17] to I could search for all
[23:23] etern
[23:25] Lord and
[23:29] there is
[23:30] none like
[23:34] you amen I believe we can just say a
[23:37] hearty Amen to that Amen to know that he
[23:42] is everything we have ever needed amen
[23:47] you know uh the world is an interesting
[23:52] place new ideas new Concepts new things
[23:54] always coming forth and and Mankind gets
[23:59] so into looking for something
[24:03] new but here's our lord Jesus right here
[24:06] in front of us amen the same yesterday
[24:09] today forever I can get up in the
[24:12] morning and know that if I was in his
[24:15] favor and his love last night I'm in his
[24:17] favor and his love this morning I I
[24:19] don't have to just hope that today will
[24:22] turn out to be so right that I I can
[24:25] please him once again but to know that
[24:27] we can walk and I just like to speak
[24:30] Along on this thought today you know I
[24:32] got to thinking how ironic this is
[24:35] because sometimes when you uh I give a
[24:39] little sympathy to Brother David to
[24:41] brother Chris that when you haven't been
[24:43] in the Pulpit for a bit it seems like
[24:45] maybe what you're preaching on is so old
[24:48] and so untouched but the word is fresh
[24:51] every day right we have fresh Mana amen
[24:54] and and God is good and I'd been
[24:56] preaching on what is your vision and I
[24:58] want to just take along in that thought
[25:01] tonight uh looking to the Unseen and uh
[25:04] if we'll turn in Revelations 22
[25:08] 1-1 and uh praise the lord we prayed for
[25:11] you brother vile but here you are amen
[25:14] and we had a prayer request for you
[25:16] sister April but here you are amen and
[25:19] we're just happy for each and
[25:21] everyone uh and uh you know God is good
[25:26] um and uh as the song says he's good all
[25:28] the time am uh so so we just uh thank
[25:32] the Lord for that I want to draw a
[25:34] little thought through Revelations 22
[25:36] 1-1 and then verse
[25:38] 17 and he showed me a pure River of
[25:42] Water of Life clear as Crystal
[25:45] proceeding out of the Throne of God and
[25:48] of the lamb in the midst of the street
[25:50] of it and on either side of the river
[25:53] there and was there the Tree of Life
[25:57] which bear 12 manner of fruits and
[26:00] yielded her fruit every month and the
[26:02] leaves of the tree were for the healing
[26:05] of the Nations and there shall be no
[26:08] more curse but the Throne of God and of
[26:11] the Lamb shall be in it and his servants
[26:14] Shall Serve
[26:16] him and they shall see his face and his
[26:19] name shall be in their
[26:22] foreheads and there shall be no night
[26:25] there and no need no candle and they
[26:29] need no candle neither the light of the
[26:31] Sun for the Lord God giveth them light
[26:35] and they shall reign forever and ever
[26:38] and I just have a little caption in my
[26:41] sideline right
[26:43] here because I personally and I want to
[26:45] put it that way so that it's not
[26:47] confusing I personally believe that even
[26:51] when we are there in his presence
[26:53] revelation will continue to come I
[26:56] believe it won't be a revelation as it
[26:59] were that we would say oh I now see this
[27:01] scripture and that scripture but it the
[27:03] Revelation as it would be of a a solid a
[27:07] real marriage that I remember a a man
[27:11] one time that I knew not really a
[27:13] Christian but he'd been married for uh
[27:16] about the time of brother Bob and sister
[27:18] Joanne and he had quite a sense of humor
[27:21] and he says you know every day she
[27:24] surprises
[27:25] me and um
[27:28] I I think that's going to be kind of a
[27:30] little bit if you don't mind me putting
[27:32] it in that way what it would be like
[27:34] when we are in the presence of the Lord
[27:36] every day is going to be a glorious day
[27:38] it's going to be a day that we get to
[27:40] see another side of our Lord and and uh
[27:43] I I just think it'll be wonderful I
[27:45] don't think we're going to sit back and
[27:47] say man you know this Heaven is just
[27:50] kind of getting old now it's going to be
[27:53] new it's going to be exciting it's going
[27:54] to be refreshing to our souls and and uh
[27:57] I I wrote it here as an eternal
[28:01] Revelation and that we see each day a
[28:03] little more of our Lord Jesus and he
[28:05] said unto me these things are faithful
[28:07] and true and the Lord God of the Holy
[28:10] prophets sent his Angel to show unto his
[28:13] servants the things which must shortly
[28:16] be done behold I come quickly blessed is
[28:20] he that keepeth the sayings of the
[28:22] prophecy of this book and I have to
[28:24] admit I've been really caught up in
[28:25] Prophecy lately right it's just
[28:27] something that just captivated my
[28:29] attention and um going to keep the
[28:32] sayings of the prophecy of this book and
[28:35] I John saw these things and heard them
[28:38] and when I had heard and seen I fell
[28:40] down to worship before the feet of the
[28:43] Angel which showed me these things then
[28:46] saith he unto me see thou do it not for
[28:50] I am thy fellow servant and of thy
[28:52] Brethren the prophets and of them which
[28:56] keep the sayings of this book worship
[28:59] God and he saith unto me seal not the
[29:02] sayings of the prophecy of this book for
[29:05] the time is at
[29:07] hand I hope you catch that amen God's
[29:11] declaring in this day that this word was
[29:14] to be fulfilled do not seal the book
[29:19] back up amen it is open to his bride
[29:24] it's open to his people amen and and a
[29:28] very clear saying
[29:30] amen for the time is at hand amen
[29:33] meaning this is a time for these things
[29:36] to come to pass and I say Amen to that
[29:40] and that he is unjust let him be unjust
[29:42] still and he which is filthy let him be
[29:45] filthy still and he that is righteous
[29:47] let him be righteous still and he that
[29:49] is Holy let him be holy still verse 17
[29:55] and the spirit and the bride say come
[29:59] and let him that heareth say come and
[30:02] let him that is a thirst come and
[30:04] whosoever will let him take the Water of
[30:09] Life
[30:10] freely amen we thank you Lord for your
[30:13] word tonight just ask you to speak to
[30:15] our hearts Lord make it real as it has
[30:18] stirred our hearts today father let it
[30:21] stir our hearts once again this evening
[30:23] we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[30:26] you may be
[30:30] seated you know for Generations people
[30:33] uh looked at the word of God and and
[30:35] come to many conclusions they come to
[30:37] many ideas they had many thoughts that
[30:40] they expressed and in fact we could put
[30:42] it this way that whole religions have
[30:45] been founded on a single man's ideas of
[30:48] the word of God or in some religions a
[30:50] single woman's ideas of the word of God
[30:53] and it's amazing to me that if there is
[30:56] no scripture Foundation that something
[30:58] like that could exist but yet my
[31:01] brothers and sisters the word is
[31:03] declaring that it must come to pass
[31:05] these are the signs of the end times and
[31:08] so it is that everything that would be
[31:10] out of kelter of the word now you can't
[31:12] hardly really imagine and and I I want
[31:15] to put it this way tonight I I hope you
[31:17] don't mind me speaking it like this but
[31:20] I I think we're slightly prejudiced of
[31:22] the in the word because we have come and
[31:25] God has opened our eyes given us
[31:27] Foundation to build this on and we look
[31:30] around and literally I'm guilty of this
[31:33] saying why can't they see it it seems to
[31:38] us to be so clear so present right in
[31:42] front of them and and you get into this
[31:45] and if we aren't careful we'll get into
[31:48] a position that we somehow believe these
[31:51] people are inferior or lack something
[31:54] but we need to continually walk in the
[31:57] grace of God for he's the one that's
[31:59] given this Revelation to us he's the one
[32:01] who's brought this alive it was not us
[32:04] it was not our ability our intelligence
[32:07] it wasn't our spiritual or sacrifice it
[32:09] was him alone it was the gift of God
[32:12] given to us and so if we're not careful
[32:15] we start to say now why can't these
[32:17] people you see that sometimes that
[32:19] people come so far in the message and
[32:21] then just stop right there and we can't
[32:24] understand why did you stop and and they
[32:27] are at the limit of their Revelation but
[32:30] we should never look down on that
[32:32] because God gave Revelation to us at
[32:34] some stage of our life and in that
[32:37] Revelation my brother and sister it
[32:38] allowed us or give us ability to an
[32:41] understanding which meaning Revelation
[32:43] to move on and you know don't believe
[32:45] it's at the end for them amen just pray
[32:48] that the continuation comes to them of
[32:51] the revelation of Jesus Christ and as we
[32:54] come because we know that true
[32:56] revelation can only come from God Amen
[32:59] it cannot be preached from the pulpit
[33:01] many times I have experienced this where
[33:04] people say explain that to me if you
[33:06] believe this or this explain it my
[33:08] brother and sister you could explain it
[33:10] but without Revelation it's just more
[33:13] word words that have come from the page
[33:16] and you know that is what they already
[33:18] have so you can't give them more than
[33:20] what they already have so because you're
[33:22] not giving them more than they already
[33:24] have they don't even understand where
[33:26] you're coming from and so they say well
[33:29] we've got what you've got but we realize
[33:31] by Revelation this opening continual
[33:34] opening of the word God is taking us
[33:36] further into him amen this is not even
[33:40] to say taking me into revelation of a
[33:43] message of the hour my brother and
[33:44] sister properly interpreted that is
[33:47] taking us into him Jesus Christ amen and
[33:51] so as we go into our our Lord Jesus amen
[33:55] the relationship becomes greater and
[33:57] greater I believe we can get an amen out
[33:59] of that and so it's there that uh uh the
[34:03] throne is there and life is there and
[34:06] Revelation is there and God is
[34:09] Distributing this in such a fashion my
[34:11] brother and sister to his bride now my
[34:15] brother and sister if God was just to
[34:17] give us a great Book of Revelation which
[34:19] he did in essence but if he gave us a
[34:21] great Book of Revelation without the
[34:24] timing and the understanding how to to
[34:27] apply it we would come up with all kinds
[34:30] of things amen if you ever had much
[34:32] experience about the trailer park in
[34:35] Arizona there was a great Revelation and
[34:37] these things were brought out but the
[34:39] people in the trailer park didn't know
[34:42] what to do with what had been given to
[34:45] them and much trouble come from that and
[34:48] so it is in our lives that if we do not
[34:51] have H you might say the experience in
[34:54] the character to deal with the power of
[34:57] God imagine the mess that we create with
[35:00] that and so God is leading his dear
[35:03] children along opening the word to us
[35:05] and sometimes we have great flashes of
[35:08] Revelation and times that it just the
[35:10] word opens up so strongly we were
[35:12] talking about this the other day you
[35:14] know I I believe that was brother Donnie
[35:16] Reagan one time I know it's happened to
[35:18] me I'm sure it's happened to brother
[35:19] Chris and Brother David that you'll
[35:21] actually be preaching on a thought and
[35:23] the light bulb turns on for you amen and
[35:26] you're like wow I never saw that in the
[35:29] word till this second and you know you
[35:31] were led to pick that scripture or that
[35:33] quote so we see how that the word is
[35:36] coming and unfolding and bringing itself
[35:39] and so as this comes the generations are
[35:42] open and you know it says there in verse
[35:45] one he showed me a pure River of Water
[35:48] of Life now my brother and sister I'm
[35:51] telling you we're talking about Vision
[35:54] we're seeing John testify
[35:57] that this was open to him showed to him
[36:00] this River of Life he was there I
[36:02] believe it would be safe to say because
[36:04] of the way that John frames this that he
[36:07] had never saw these things before so
[36:09] this is now Revelation coming to him and
[36:12] and he is Amazed by what he is seeing
[36:15] and it is there uh uh that that he is
[36:18] saying this River of Life clear as
[36:20] Crystal and it's coming from the Throne
[36:22] of God this can only be the pure word of
[36:25] God this can only be a pure message that
[36:28] is coming it is not a message of man now
[36:31] I want to ask you tonight has the Water
[36:33] of Life been revealed to you and I amen
[36:36] it is Flowing tonight my brother and
[36:38] sister by no measure of man's ability
[36:41] but the fact that God showed us the
[36:43] River of Life Is there and we see it and
[36:46] we know that we must drink of that water
[36:50] and it is revelation to us amen and I
[36:53] love that that it come from the Throne
[36:55] of God and not of man
[36:57] because the word of God tells us that
[36:58] whatever come from man will fail now I'm
[37:02] telling you we're sitting here tonight
[37:03] I'm going to speak a little blunt or at
[37:05] least I think it's kind of blunt my
[37:07] brother and sister except for the
[37:10] prophet of God has revealed that we
[37:12] cannot be deceived if left of our own
[37:16] device we would be
[37:18] deceived this is nothing less than God
[37:21] coming down and at the time that devil
[37:23] wants to H interpret the word to you God
[37:27] gives you another Clear Vision of the
[37:28] River of Life it's pouring out to us
[37:32] that we can see now I'm telling just
[37:35] paraphrasing a little this because I I
[37:36] didn't want to be too long tonight but
[37:38] the prophet of God says you know that
[37:41] it's there in that time that those
[37:43] Spirits would be so deceiving amen he's
[37:46] basing this right out of the word be so
[37:49] deceiving that it would deceive
[37:52] everyone except for God shortens the
[37:55] time and then the prophet turns around
[37:57] to balance this and says you can't be
[38:01] deceived because you are the word amen
[38:06] now which one of those paragraphs are we
[38:08] going to worry
[38:10] about you see what I'm saying oh if time
[38:13] is not shortened we're going to be
[38:14] deceived was he speaking to
[38:18] you no my brother and sister cu the word
[38:21] says that you are the word and you
[38:24] cannot be deceived because you are
[38:26] Christ in flesh and you are the Living
[38:30] Word the flaming fire of God is living
[38:33] in US amen so we don't walk out of here
[38:36] to flaunt that I can go kiss the girls I
[38:39] can do this I can do that no you don't
[38:42] do that because you truly have the fire
[38:44] of God which is purifying fire living in
[38:47] you so it's changed us we don't have the
[38:50] nature we don't have the desire we have
[38:53] the Life of Christ in us and we need to
[38:55] break my brother brother and sister
[38:57] those spirits that would try to tell us
[38:59] well I'm I'm afraid I'm not pleasing
[39:02] well my brother and sister I'll tell you
[39:03] how you just seal that forever just live
[39:06] the
[39:07] word we don't have to have a writing we
[39:09] don't have to have all kinds of stuff
[39:11] and it won't matter who we
[39:14] know
[39:16] H it doesn't matter who you
[39:18] know there's no name dropping in
[39:22] heaven all we have to do is live the
[39:25] word and as we are obedient to the word
[39:29] it is what is our protection it is also
[39:32] our
[39:34] Revelation if we're not in the word
[39:37] we're not going to find
[39:39] Revelation amen so it's come straight
[39:42] from the Throne of God not the mind of
[39:44] man and here I'm going to just step off
[39:47] a little bit give me a little liberty if
[39:48] you would tonight this says that this is
[39:52] clear as Crystal
[39:55] amen
[39:57] you know what the devil wants to
[39:59] do he wants to distract you and leave
[40:02] the question marks in your mind that who
[40:05] you are in Jesus Christ is not clear as
[40:09] crystal that's it but when Revelation
[40:12] comes to the bride of Christ and she
[40:14] starts to see who she is it starts to
[40:18] become so clear that we could literally
[40:21] say clear as Crystal who we are in Jesus
[40:24] Christ amen now those that are wavering
[40:27] back and forth my brother and sister
[40:29] sometimes it happens in stages of life
[40:31] for people but my brother and sister the
[40:33] deeper they get in the word the clearer
[40:36] it becomes and when this the revelation
[40:39] of Jesus Christ coming straight from the
[40:40] Throne of God to you and I ultimately it
[40:43] will bring us to a place that who we are
[40:46] in Jesus Christ and who he is in the
[40:49] framework of the church will be clear as
[40:52] Crystal we won't have to sit here in
[40:54] muddy water many time times all these
[40:57] different doctrines come out and what
[40:59] they do is they say well this is this
[41:01] and when it doesn't make sense to anyone
[41:04] they say well that's because it's for us
[41:06] and you just follow us but the bride of
[41:09] Christ my brother and sister was meant
[41:11] to step into the Revelation the bride
[41:14] herself has to Step Beyond the Veil and
[41:17] when she steps into that realm it's not
[41:19] a matter of how smart she is how much
[41:22] money she's got or this or that or
[41:24] wherever it come my brother brother and
[41:26] sister it just really drives me I'll
[41:28] just tell you bluntly it drives me crazy
[41:30] when I meet people in the message that
[41:32] are
[41:34] prejudiced how can you be prejudiced
[41:37] when the same Christ that's in you is in
[41:40] them amen the same blood that redeemed
[41:43] you redeem them but we still have racism
[41:47] as it were in the message people saying
[41:51] they don't have Revelation they're from
[41:54] this country this culture they don't
[41:56] have Revelation like we
[41:58] do my brother and sister I have to
[42:00] wonder what Revelation they're talking
[42:02] about cuz this Revelation covers the
[42:05] blood covers the sin of man amen whether
[42:08] he's short tall whether he's white dark
[42:12] whatever it might be it covers it and
[42:15] God didn't say I'm I got a place in
[42:17] heaven amen for you over here and I got
[42:21] a place in heaven for you and just to
[42:23] keep the bride from fighting we'll build
[42:24] a fence in the middle of Heaven
[42:27] nonsense amen so no model up Revelation
[42:31] amen God called us to see who we are
[42:33] clearly can we tonight just lift a hand
[42:35] maybe and say thank you Lord for making
[42:37] it very clear who I am I'm not here with
[42:42] question marks of whether I'm a Son of
[42:44] God or a daughter of God oh we make
[42:46] mistakes but God has been giving us the
[42:49] the the grace of God liberally my
[42:51] brother and sister he said it's
[42:54] sufficient so even in our mistakes that
[42:57] we make In the Flesh we need to have the
[42:59] Revelation that his grace is sufficient
[43:02] for our
[43:04] situation Amen to see the plan of God
[43:07] clearly now it's there that it says in
[43:10] that there'll be no curse look how this
[43:13] is placed right before us that there
[43:15] shall be no more curse now I know this
[43:19] can be a little convoluted I might not
[43:20] do the best job of explaining it but do
[43:23] you realize right now that while there
[43:25] is still a curse on the earth that came
[43:27] at the time of the garden that you as
[43:29] the bride of Christ are not living under
[43:32] a curse that's right amen you'd say but
[43:35] we still have to work by the sweat of
[43:36] our brow amen we still have to do these
[43:39] labors we still have all of these things
[43:42] that's the flesh man amen that is the
[43:45] outer man amen living in the outer court
[43:48] but when we get into the holiest of
[43:50] holies the prophet of God says there's
[43:52] no light days and dark days and this
[43:55] troubled day and that kind of day but
[43:57] when we get into that realm look how
[43:59] much Satan wants to keep us from that
[44:02] realm he distracts us here distracts us
[44:04] there throws this in front of us but I
[44:06] want to drive it home and I don't
[44:08] believe I'm off track here tonight you
[44:10] are not living under a curse amen the
[44:13] bride of Christ is not the curse amen
[44:17] she has found Liberty in Jesus Christ
[44:21] amen it's that Liberty let listen to me
[44:24] if you will that that is the Liberty
[44:26] that allows you to step between the
[44:29] lines of the word and recognize he's
[44:32] speaking to me amen amen I am who he is
[44:38] addressing and that is a revelation amen
[44:42] cuz anybody can go to church that's
[44:44] right amen that's right I'll just throw
[44:48] this in to distract you I read a story
[44:51] once about this guy that was some kind
[44:52] of a Ponzi investor scheme guy and he
[44:56] looked around the world and said where
[44:57] can I apply this Ponzi scheme with great
[45:01] success he just went and joined the
[45:03] biggest church in town fleeced them
[45:06] all what was it because church has been
[45:09] turned into
[45:10] business if he come and offered his
[45:12] Ponzi scheme and the men of the church
[45:15] or families of the church had been in
[45:17] the right position they'd have said get
[45:19] that out of the house of God don't even
[45:21] let that in the house of God this is not
[45:23] a place Jesus whipped them off for the
[45:26] porch of the church because they were
[45:28] doing business in church and yet we see
[45:30] it all the time people calling it they
[45:32] they well we're doing this and we're
[45:34] doing that and come invest in this and
[45:36] come give us money for that and you know
[45:38] let's be partnered up I'm the majority
[45:40] you're the minority I'll get most of the
[45:43] money you'll get a little bit and that's
[45:44] how it works my brother and sister but
[45:46] it should never be there we were called
[45:49] not to live under the curse of this age
[45:51] we're not called to live under the curse
[45:52] of Leo deia we're called to live in the
[45:55] presence of God to rise and into the
[45:57] heavenlies amen lifting up constantly
[46:00] into the heavenlies is what God has
[46:02] called us to do amen and there shall be
[46:05] no more curse but the Throne of God and
[46:07] of the Lamb shall be in it and his
[46:09] servants Shall Serve him Hallelujah I'm
[46:11] glad to be a servant amen I I I don't I
[46:15] don't need to be important I just need
[46:17] to be part amen I need to be part of
[46:20] what God is doing I don't need to do
[46:22] Amen to claim it now look look how Satan
[46:26] comes you know every time God does a
[46:29] mighty work moves on us you have just a
[46:32] wonderful time you know the devil always
[46:34] comes in behind that amen he's just he's
[46:38] got that whole Philistine uh program
[46:41] right down let him Rejoice let him get
[46:44] excited there's a crop coming the word
[46:46] is producing and then Satan comes in
[46:49] like a flood trying to do that but my
[46:51] brother and sister there's some saints
[46:53] that have picked up the ox goat of the
[46:55] word amen and they've picked up the horn
[46:58] amen and the Jawbone and all of these of
[47:01] the word now imagine as we go back
[47:03] through that my brother and sister an ox
[47:05] go was a wood stick with a brass knob on
[47:08] the end it was never designed to crush
[47:11] an inch thick brass helmet but it did an
[47:15] all rotten uh uh Jawbone laying there on
[47:18] the side of the road now my brother and
[47:21] sister we look at that and sometimes
[47:22] we'll get the idea how convenient for
[47:25] him to be right there and there is a
[47:28] Jawbone I'm telling you God let that
[47:31] donkey die right there as part of his
[47:34] plan amen maybe that donkey had been
[47:36] walking along just fine his master's
[47:38] happy and the thing
[47:40] just because God said it's got to be
[47:42] right
[47:43] here amen I I'm just preaching to you
[47:47] okay is that fine I don't have a quote
[47:49] to back it up but you look at that and
[47:52] realize see God ordained there to be a
[47:54] Jawbone God ordained there to be an ox
[47:58] Cod God ordained Gideon to come into the
[48:02] position right amen look we see it
[48:04] Gideon had been living around that rock
[48:06] forever and that was Christ right in his
[48:09] midst and he failed to recognize him but
[48:11] in the season that it was necessary for
[48:14] him to have that Revelation the fire
[48:17] come from The Rock and Gideon realized
[48:19] God's been here all the time amen oh I
[48:22] want to just say Amen to that he's been
[48:24] here all the
[48:26] time amen but look how Satan May afflict
[48:29] this
[48:30] flesh but I want to say once again this
[48:32] bride is not caught in the curse that's
[48:35] right she has Redemption she knows where
[48:37] she came from she knows where she's
[48:39] going she's not under the curse
[48:43] Hallelujah in fact to the bride of
[48:45] Christ we can make the statement the
[48:47] curse has been broken yes sir no longer
[48:51] applies Satan's still bluffing our
[48:54] problem is is on occasion we listen to
[48:56] his bluff and when we don't listen to
[48:59] his bluff his bluff has no power over us
[49:04] amen now looking to the Unseen sure wish
[49:07] that the screen worked tonight that's
[49:09] that's a little bit of
[49:11] disappointment brother Brown says here
[49:13] and looking to the Unseen uh 50 amen
[49:16] let's see August 16th
[49:20] 1950 this is not like our can goods it
[49:22] doesn't have an expiration date on it
[49:24] does it
[49:26] some people kind of act that
[49:28] way no I'm sorry the word of God Is
[49:31] Timeless am if this whole nation with
[49:34] one Accord would throw themselves to God
[49:36] in sackcloth and Ashes of repentance and
[49:39] come back to the oldfashioned pathways
[49:41] that our forefathers TR there couldn't
[49:43] be a bit of harm come to us amen wonder
[49:47] why all the chaos is in our nation
[49:49] people are popping up out of nowhere
[49:51] going into shopping malls shooting
[49:52] children and mothers and all this stuff
[49:56] is because we've forsaken God you can
[49:59] find this pattern in Israel all through
[50:03] scripture that's right wouldn't be a bit
[50:06] of harm come to us I believe it'd be
[50:08] worth more than all the ammunition
[50:09] plants and things that we could make
[50:11] that's right and all the bombs that we
[50:13] could have there's nothing as great as
[50:15] prayer god holds all the future in his
[50:19] hands and someone asked me not long ago
[50:21] brother brandham what do you think about
[50:24] the future he said I I do not know what
[50:28] the future holds but I know who holds
[50:30] the future so that's the thing if I can
[50:33] keep acquainted with him that's right
[50:35] now my brother and sister we all have
[50:37] had passing friendships in our
[50:40] life but how is it that some friendships
[50:44] endure because we don't let them
[50:49] pass isin't that true we meet people and
[50:53] and uh I I'll just speak this in this
[50:55] this context okay uh hopefully they're
[50:57] not listening or won't be listening I
[50:58] won't embarrass myself but you know we
[51:01] went to Florida and I've listened to
[51:03] brother Denny steeman preach Through The
[51:05] Years different sermons here and there
[51:08] and and you know we went to Florida uh
[51:11] um I I jokingly say that brother Barry's
[51:13] marriage seminar was our excuse to go
[51:15] visit Florida but it was a blessing to
[51:18] go there and and uh so we're there in
[51:20] Florida I get to meet brother Danny I
[51:22] get to visit with him and I realize this
[51:25] is a man that I can kind of relate to
[51:28] and uh you know we go
[51:33] home and I mentioned to Sister Jerry one
[51:36] day I said yeah I really liked brother
[51:37] Dany but hey you know how it is Sister
[51:40] Jerry's like call
[51:44] him well he doesn't know
[51:47] me I I I I was just somebody that talked
[51:51] to him for 30 minutes after church on a
[51:53] Wednesday night
[51:56] but I was intrigued because there was
[51:58] something in me desired to see if there
[52:00] was friendship there and I call him up
[52:03] and he's like oh brother Paul I remember
[52:08] you and when I invited him to preach Our
[52:11] Family
[52:13] Camp he didn't answer the phone so I
[52:15] left a voicemail brother Danny this is
[52:18] Brother Paul and IAH hoen I don't know
[52:20] if you remember me or
[52:22] not but we would like to invite you to
[52:25] speak our family
[52:27] again a little bit later 15 20 30
[52:30] minutes phone rings I remember
[52:34] you amen now I'm speaking from a natural
[52:37] context and I hope you can put in place
[52:39] I'm working on a lasting
[52:43] friendship not just to invite a man to
[52:45] be the preacher that comes to our family
[52:47] camp and preach I I've decided I want to
[52:50] be friends with him now my brother and
[52:53] sister in passing for us to to be a
[52:55] friend as it were with Jesus Christ you
[52:59] got to talk to him once in a while you
[53:01] got to have a relationship with him and
[53:03] you got to cultivate that you can't just
[53:06] sit in your chair in the evening time
[53:08] watching the sunset and say you know
[53:10] God's going to come and talk to
[53:13] me talk to him that's right reach out to
[53:17] him let him know you're interested I I
[53:19] want this
[53:21] relationship I want this to be something
[53:23] real I want this to be something
[53:25] something that if you come Lord in years
[53:28] maybe maybe we'll be old as it is and
[53:31] and it's there that we're sitting there
[53:33] not looking back saying I would have
[53:35] liked to have that relationship I would
[53:36] have liked to have that friendship I
[53:38] wished I would have made that call to
[53:39] brother Danny you know 30 years ago or
[53:42] whatever it might be I wish it be but no
[53:44] my brother and sister let's do it we
[53:47] need the Lord in our life let's do it
[53:49] amen reach out to him no greater friend
[53:52] than man has ever had than our Lord
[53:54] Jesus Christ amen amen so here it is he
[53:57] said but I know who holds the future and
[53:59] that's the thing if I can keep
[54:01] acquainted with him we have the ability
[54:04] to keep acquinted amen so then he found
[54:08] out talking uh about Ahab and all of
[54:11] them or whatever and and he says and I
[54:13] found out the prophet was in Israel he
[54:15] said go fetch him bring him to me and
[54:17] they went down and somebody told him
[54:19] that Elisha was in Dothan and and when
[54:21] they got down there to Dothan when they
[54:23] went in by night time and Camp around
[54:26] about in darkness you see how the enemy
[54:29] always works underhanded in dark that's
[54:32] right you know young people it's a lot
[54:34] of fun to when you get your own car and
[54:37] you get all these things to go around in
[54:39] the dark but remember there's all kinds
[54:41] of spirits out there in that dark and
[54:44] encamped around about the city to catch
[54:46] Elisha so when the young man his servant
[54:49] raised up early in the morning and went
[54:51] out in other words he was a fellow
[54:53] taking him in and out and around was his
[54:56] servant like and when he went out uh uh
[55:00] come he come back and said alas my
[55:03] master for the whole city is enced about
[55:06] by the spirit of
[55:09] leoda well that's not quite what it
[55:12] says it's on the back screen I don't
[55:15] know if y'all want to turn around look
[55:19] backwards and camped about with horses
[55:21] and Chariots of the enemy and he said
[55:23] why there's more uh with us than there
[55:26] is with them come on my brother and
[55:28] sister we ought to come to the place
[55:30] that becomes a mantra to us let that
[55:32] become something that reminds us when
[55:34] we're having a tough day to be able to
[55:36] stand and it seems like that all has
[55:38] broke loose around you to stop and say I
[55:41] believe the word of God and I'm going to
[55:44] quote the prophet Elisha who has come
[55:46] under the spirit of Elijah so his name
[55:50] might be Elisha but he really is
[55:52] Elijah's
[55:53] spirit and he says there's more with us
[55:57] than there is against
[56:01] us you need a little will power to
[56:03] resist remember amen there's more with
[56:06] you than there is against you and there
[56:09] is a lot against us my brother and
[56:11] sister that tells you how many are here
[56:14] for you amen it's not that we're
[56:17] overwhelmed amen we just need to learn
[56:20] how to do
[56:21] arithmetic amen you think there's a few
[56:24] thousand demons opposing you then
[56:26] realize that there's many more angels in
[56:29] your midst than there ever will be
[56:32] devils in your
[56:34] midst amen it's about time for us to do
[56:37] some of God's math amen and
[56:40] so uh it was there there's more with us
[56:43] than there is with them well he could
[56:45] see no one but Elisha Elisha prayed Lord
[56:49] open the young man's eyes that he may
[56:51] see I think that'd be a good prayer for
[56:54] us to be praying praying over our young
[56:55] people Lord open eyes amen maybe old
[56:59] people how about we just say people open
[57:02] our eyes Lord that we can see what
[57:04] you're doing amen amen there's so many
[57:07] people now across the land and I don't
[57:09] want to get distracted to this so many
[57:12] people starting to question that the the
[57:15] message is not as effective did it die
[57:18] out with the prophet did something go
[57:20] away my brother and sister the prophet
[57:22] told us this would no longer be a public
[57:26] display God is showing himself to his
[57:29] bride amen he's not going to walk the
[57:32] streets of these cities doing the
[57:34] miraculous that they believe he's called
[57:36] to do in their midst he's doing it for
[57:38] his bride amen he's a deliverer a
[57:42] provider amen the husband to the bride
[57:45] amen not walking through the
[57:47] neighborhood to show off but coming down
[57:50] in a personal way to deal and show us
[57:52] there is more with us than there is
[57:55] against us
[57:58] hallelujah and I believe God had
[58:00] answered this prayer today he says Lord
[58:02] open the young man's eyes that he may
[58:04] see and the Lord moved the veil amen oh
[58:09] sorry for getting excited tonight I'm
[58:10] going to stand here and tell you God was
[58:13] gracious enough to me he loved me enough
[58:16] cared for me enough to lift my veil amen
[58:22] amen nothing's going to lift that Veil
[58:24] but our Lord Jesus and I say tonight the
[58:26] veil has been lifted to this bride she
[58:29] is looking and she is seeing the
[58:31] supernatural God in her
[58:33] midst amen and the people that are
[58:35] saying well we think the message might
[58:37] have slipped or something was missed we
[58:39] believe it this far butt and we got this
[58:42] butt and we got that butt I'm telling
[58:44] you God's on the scene God's working
[58:46] he's still a Healer he's still a
[58:48] deliverers till a savior amen the blood
[58:51] is just as powerful tonight as it's ever
[58:54] been through the the ages whether it's a
[58:56] public display or not it's there and
[59:00] it's doing the work that was promised
[59:03] amen and he's moving a people into his
[59:06] presence amen amen and the Lord moved
[59:09] the veil before the young man and he
[59:11] looked and the whole Oh you mean that
[59:15] little circle of devils down
[59:19] there that seemed to be very
[59:23] tangible was nothing because the
[59:26] hills are covered amen with the present
[59:30] the angels of God
[59:32] Amen oh Lord I really I I'm telling you
[59:36] I really wouldn't mind having an actual
[59:39] uh uh manifestation of that in our lives
[59:42] that we would walk down the street uh
[59:44] have to go in the grocery store you know
[59:46] all of the different places it might be
[59:48] I don't want to get into that and all
[59:50] the things that you see and are
[59:51] influenced by if we could just look out
[59:54] amen but God said I want you to live by
[59:56] faith so I believe my brother and sister
[59:59] that the angels are there walking with
[1:00:02] us surrounding us because all I can see
[1:00:05] is Devils
[1:00:07] amen but he's here that's right and he's
[1:00:10] surrounding us he's protecting us he's
[1:00:13] leading us amen he said he would Amen
[1:00:18] Hallelujah Lord yes sir pull the veil
[1:00:20] back a little farther
[1:00:22] Lord amen
[1:00:26] so you know in that case sometimes we
[1:00:31] just maybe need to stop and say Lord
[1:00:33] open my eyes that's it open my eyes
[1:00:37] amen and he looked in the whole hills
[1:00:39] and mountains were full of Chariots of
[1:00:41] Fire standing around the old that old
[1:00:43] Prophet well he wasn't afraid
[1:00:46] then see this is what bothers me Saints
[1:00:49] if I could be honest for just a moment
[1:00:51] when I hear
[1:00:52] people in this message
[1:00:55] talk about their fear of the economy and
[1:00:58] their fear of what's Happening Here a
[1:01:00] fear of atomic
[1:01:01] bombs I personally think there's
[1:01:03] something missing in the
[1:01:07] relationship because God when he opened
[1:01:10] our eyes to the word revealed word right
[1:01:12] took our fear with it amen amen we're
[1:01:16] not to sit here come what may my brother
[1:01:19] and sister we're not to set here under a
[1:01:22] spirit of fear but God has given us a
[1:01:24] sound mind and I'm going to Define sound
[1:01:27] mind for you tonight if you don't mind a
[1:01:29] sound mind is a mind that reads the word
[1:01:32] of God and says my God met me right here
[1:01:36] and this is what the word said it would
[1:01:38] produce and I'm going to look around and
[1:01:40] be able to say here it is my eyes have
[1:01:43] been opened no longer under the spirit
[1:01:48] of fear that's right amen that's
[1:01:51] right and I don't mean that I'm trying
[1:01:53] to criticize these people don't
[1:01:54] misunderstand me tonight but there's
[1:01:56] something wrong when we're consumed by
[1:02:02] fear maybe God would reveal that in such
[1:02:04] a fashion no condemnation involved but
[1:02:07] simply a fact that we would look at and
[1:02:08] say okay Lord I'm going to move in that
[1:02:10] direction Give Me Faith to kick this
[1:02:12] fear Spirit out hallelujah
[1:02:19] amen I'll tell you a little story from
[1:02:22] my past one time there was a kid that
[1:02:24] was was quite an act up rode our school
[1:02:26] bus and one day the bus driver said I've
[1:02:29] had enough she went back there not a
[1:02:32] very big lady she went back there and
[1:02:35] said get off the bus and he said I am
[1:02:38] not getting off the bus grabbed the hold
[1:02:40] of the back seats and he's this tall and
[1:02:43] she's this tall and he's got a hold of
[1:02:45] the seat and she he's like you can't
[1:02:48] make
[1:02:50] me and without him while he's doing his
[1:02:52] boasting act with his chest down out she
[1:02:54] reached around and unlocked the back
[1:02:57] door of the bus the door still closed
[1:03:01] but it's
[1:03:02] now unlocked that's right are you with
[1:03:06] me she stood back now she didn't say in
[1:03:10] the name of the school
[1:03:12] district she didn't say in the name of
[1:03:16] the bus
[1:03:18] superintendent she said I said I hope
[1:03:22] you're following me amen sometimes we
[1:03:25] want to put it this way well we got to
[1:03:27] put all these words with it but I want
[1:03:29] you to realize who author whose
[1:03:30] authority you are speaking in amen we
[1:03:34] don't have to give them a whole
[1:03:35] dictionary of this that and the other
[1:03:38] right seven sons of SAA we recognize we
[1:03:41] don't know you but we know them well let
[1:03:44] the devil know who we are amen and so
[1:03:48] she unlocks the door of that school busz
[1:03:50] and he doesn't realize it while he's all
[1:03:52] boastful and she's standing there and
[1:03:54] he's thinking how what she going to do
[1:03:56] and she just
[1:03:57] went and boom right out of the bus and
[1:04:00] on the
[1:04:01] ground and here's a whole Bus full of
[1:04:04] rebellious
[1:04:08] boys am I
[1:04:10] next you want to sedo the devil don't
[1:04:14] don't let him tell you I ain't leaving
[1:04:17] kick him out amen amen we have authority
[1:04:19] in the name of Jesus Christ we don't
[1:04:21] need to throw a bluff we have the word
[1:04:25] amen and the word will do the work for
[1:04:27] us if we'll give it a chance Hallelujah
[1:04:32] I remember that bus driver one time
[1:04:33] later in life I got a little carried
[1:04:35] away I think it had something to do with
[1:04:37] throwing a baloney sandwich from one end
[1:04:39] of the bus to the other she just looked
[1:04:42] up and said Paul you just used your last
[1:04:45] chance yes
[1:04:50] ma'am I don't know that a harle breathed
[1:04:52] until we got home
[1:04:54] what I didn't know is that bus driver
[1:04:56] knew my
[1:04:58] mother and about the time I made it home
[1:05:01] or got my chores done my mother knew all
[1:05:03] about it my brother and sister the devil
[1:05:07] can't touch you but what your father
[1:05:11] knows all about it we're not loners in
[1:05:16] this land we are the bride of Christ you
[1:05:20] want to take a real man and make him mad
[1:05:22] just say something or do something to
[1:05:24] his wife and then you'll see a real man
[1:05:27] become mad and we have a real father
[1:05:29] amen who cares about his children and
[1:05:32] he's not going to let the devil molest
[1:05:34] you amen amen hallelujah so as we look
[1:05:38] at this now I've got myself lost here uh
[1:05:42] we're fighting tonight here uh great
[1:05:44] Warfare fight against wrong the word of
[1:05:47] God against modern theology trying to
[1:05:49] make the word of God bring it to the
[1:05:51] people while the enemy would try to
[1:05:53] beset it in every way but one is a
[1:05:56] majority in God Amen do you realize
[1:05:58] tonight if we got Jesus Christ in US
[1:06:01] amen we're sitting here tonight when it
[1:06:03] comes to the devil we are the majority
[1:06:06] we're not just a singular Left Behind
[1:06:09] forgotten forsaken we are the majority
[1:06:12] in Jesus Christ amen and it's time for
[1:06:15] us to let the devil know that we are
[1:06:17] tired of getting kicked around or having
[1:06:20] him March through our house and leave
[1:06:21] his little trail of Destruction behind
[1:06:24] us now notice the point I want you to
[1:06:26] see is that Elijah the man who was of
[1:06:29] God called the man of God he did not
[1:06:31] look to the natural thing he looked to
[1:06:34] the
[1:06:35] supernatural amen he didn't look at what
[1:06:38] he seen he looked at what he did not see
[1:06:42] amen that's right now let's jump back
[1:06:45] for just a
[1:06:47] second that River of Life flowing out
[1:06:51] from the
[1:06:53] throne
[1:06:56] right now I look out this natural man
[1:06:59] yeah needs glasses to even you know
[1:07:02] Sister Jerry's like look at this across
[1:07:04] the kitchen and I'm like what do you
[1:07:07] got what is
[1:07:10] that this natural man cannot see that
[1:07:12] River of Life right but this spiritual
[1:07:16] man by God's grace sees that river
[1:07:19] flowing abut amen flowing right from the
[1:07:22] Throne of God clear as Crystal telling
[1:07:26] you I bought you I have paid for you
[1:07:31] you're my possession I hold title deed
[1:07:33] to you you are not only that but you're
[1:07:36] my bride yes sir oh I'll tell you my
[1:07:39] brother and sister it it there's so much
[1:07:41] I could preach like forever tonight on
[1:07:43] this subject amen but look at this amen
[1:07:47] he didn't look at what he seen otherwise
[1:07:49] he'd have seen exactly what gesi
[1:07:52] saw
[1:07:54] he's a prophet right but in the flesh if
[1:07:58] he had just looked with flesh eyes he
[1:08:00] would have only seen what ha I see and
[1:08:03] then he would have said we have a
[1:08:05] problem here
[1:08:06] Captain but he looked out with eyes of
[1:08:10] Revelation amen and those eyes of
[1:08:13] Revelation see the throne the River of
[1:08:15] Life coming from the throne and he
[1:08:18] realizes and he knows without a Shadow
[1:08:20] of Doubt God is with me amen now the
[1:08:23] prophet of God goes was on you know and
[1:08:24] he says about um how it might be another
[1:08:27] quote I don't remember here I dug
[1:08:29] through so many and put so many back on
[1:08:31] the Shelf but you know the prophet God
[1:08:33] talks about that you see when he he put
[1:08:37] that or did that he had the
[1:08:41] people that could see but couldn't see
[1:08:44] maybe I'll hold on to that I don't
[1:08:45] remember if I included that or not I had
[1:08:48] a little question for time
[1:08:52] now God wants us to be able to see the
[1:08:55] Unseen that's
[1:08:57] right I come across a qu quote that
[1:09:01] I I uh here again my brain's in a little
[1:09:04] fuddle forgive me I don't remember if I
[1:09:07] included it or
[1:09:08] not but I I just want to praise the Lord
[1:09:10] amen that he's let me see the Unseen yes
[1:09:13] sir that he's let me see what what even
[1:09:16] as much as it breaks my heart people in
[1:09:18] my own family can't see amen but God's
[1:09:21] let me see this and and it makes it seem
[1:09:23] a little weird to the world my brother
[1:09:25] and sister but I'm not looking at the
[1:09:26] world I'm looking to the Unseen which is
[1:09:29] Christ in you the hope of glory amen
[1:09:32] unseen as it is and uh you know so we
[1:09:36] get a look to the Unseen and look upon
[1:09:38] the past the curtain of natural time now
[1:09:41] brother brandham uh uh preached about uh
[1:09:44] you know going beyond the curtain he
[1:09:45] tells us about this but my brother and
[1:09:48] sister there's actually a curtain in the
[1:09:50] natural yes sir there is a curtain in
[1:09:52] the spiritual there is is a curtain in
[1:09:54] the natural and as it is you're going to
[1:09:57] have to get believe it or not you're
[1:09:58] going to have to get through the curtain
[1:10:00] of the natural just as much as you're
[1:10:03] going to have to get through the curtain
[1:10:04] of the
[1:10:06] spiritual and so in that realm we come
[1:10:08] to this place that once we part the
[1:10:12] curtain of natural
[1:10:14] Veil we step into the
[1:10:17] spiritual see if we never overcome the
[1:10:19] flesh we'll never see Christ that's
[1:10:21] right that's why dying to our is so
[1:10:24] important because if we don't get past
[1:10:26] this natural Veil we cannot get past the
[1:10:29] spiritual veil in the presence of God
[1:10:32] Amen that's why we have so many brother
[1:10:34] Brown says you know I'm just going to
[1:10:36] paraphrase this we got so many people to
[1:10:39] church we're proud of ourselves we got
[1:10:42] all these people to church but he said
[1:10:44] I'm afraid we're not getting them to
[1:10:45] Christ that's we' got them past a
[1:10:47] natural Veil into the house of God and
[1:10:50] they're sensing the supernatural they're
[1:10:52] sensing all of these things taking place
[1:10:54] but there's never been a change in them
[1:10:57] to get them through the veil into the
[1:10:59] spiritual so there you have intellectual
[1:11:02] Believers yeah that's right they're
[1:11:03] standing there with all kinds of
[1:11:05] influence from the message but no Spirit
[1:11:08] to back it up right amen so let me hurry
[1:11:12] along here
[1:11:13] amen you see my brother and sister to
[1:11:16] have a position of rest I'm paraphrasing
[1:11:18] and cutting some of this back the
[1:11:20] position of rest takes a spiritual man
[1:11:22] beyond the place of carnal men will ever
[1:11:28] see you want to know if you've come to
[1:11:31] arrest
[1:11:33] arrest is complete this I don't remember
[1:11:36] where I read this this is in hopefully
[1:11:39] you guys don't turn me off tonight this
[1:11:41] was in a writing about the psychology of
[1:11:44] man now not psychology in the sense that
[1:11:47] we often think of it but they're
[1:11:50] explaining there's two position for a
[1:11:53] man in the natural to
[1:11:56] sleep extreme
[1:11:59] fatigue or complete confidence of
[1:12:04] rest and he dated this back to the days
[1:12:08] that not your typical house cat but the
[1:12:11] saber-tooth
[1:12:13] tiger and he describes how these guys
[1:12:16] living in that
[1:12:17] world didn't just lay down anywhere and
[1:12:21] take a nap they had to have
[1:12:24] confidence cuz they wanted to wake
[1:12:28] up well I tell you what my brother and
[1:12:30] sister if God allows me to go to the
[1:12:32] Grave I want to have confidence I'm
[1:12:35] going to wake up and the only way I can
[1:12:38] come into that rest is to know that I'm
[1:12:40] in his
[1:12:42] presence CU without that we can go into
[1:12:45] the grave with no confidence of rising
[1:12:48] again or we can come to a place where we
[1:12:52] sleep with our fathers as it were and we
[1:12:54] can come to a place where we sleep not
[1:12:56] with fathers but with the father that's
[1:13:00] our rest that's our place where we can
[1:13:03] lay our life down with complete
[1:13:06] confidence and he will lift it up you
[1:13:10] know sometimes when you cut too much out
[1:13:11] of your sermon it leaves these weird
[1:13:13] little notches in there that nobody can
[1:13:15] figure out where you come from or where
[1:13:16] you were going I hope that made sense
[1:13:19] amen now brother Brown says 1949 uh July
[1:13:23] 18th 1949 I was not disobedient to the
[1:13:26] heavenly vision he says here and I was
[1:13:29] thinking that the natural man went out
[1:13:31] at the Unseen of his eye and pulled an
[1:13:34] adom down out of the sky and split that
[1:13:38] atam in two that destroys human life and
[1:13:41] if the natural man that knows nothing of
[1:13:43] God and cannot know nothing of God
[1:13:45] except he be converted and then his soul
[1:13:48] becomes alive with the supernatural if
[1:13:51] he could do that in the natural way
[1:13:54] what ought the man of God be doing my my
[1:13:58] friends the church is so far behind
[1:14:01] let's pray my that God will move his
[1:14:03] church up that the natural man with the
[1:14:06] natural resource is getting greater

[1:15:58] told him he's just
[1:16:02] preaching and I said come on doesn't
[1:16:04] anybody want this and hands went up
[1:16:06] everywhere finally that one boy jumped
[1:16:08] up he didn't even slow down long enough
[1:16:11] to let doubt and fear enter in he run up
[1:16:13] there and snatch that out of my hand and
[1:16:15] then he started going back and he's like

[1:17:16] giver is one who says I'll give it to
[1:17:18] you and at that point right there I

[1:18:49] is
[1:18:51] it we're almost almost
[1:18:56] there 1 Corinthians 13:12 for now we see
[1:19:00] through a glass Darkly isn't that the
[1:19:02] truth we're looking at all these
[1:19:04] promises of God and they've been just
[1:19:06] kind of out there been promised to them
[1:19:09] we don't see the clarity of it and we're
[1:19:11] trying to figure out how this applies to
[1:19:13] us and which way it is for now we see
[1:19:16] through glass Darkly but then oh
[1:19:20] Hallelujah God didn't stop with hey
[1:19:24] Jesus died to save me he stopped amen
[1:19:27] when he had completely claimed his
[1:19:31] bride well he didn't even stop then did
[1:19:34] he Brother David no sir because he took
[1:19:36] her on a honeymoon amen he took her home
[1:19:40] he didn't stop just when he got her amen
[1:19:43] that'd be awkward wouldn't
[1:19:45] it well I married you

[1:19:55] no it doesn't work that way amen
[1:19:58] hallelujah I don't want to get
[1:20:00] sidetracked I just had a couple thoughts
[1:20:02] like whoa hey look at that but what
[1:20:06] happened veil was lifted right to
[1:20:08] spiritual vision yeah not for us to
[1:20:11] debate the message not for us to debate
[1:20:14] who's in who's out what's this and
[1:20:16] what's that my brother and sister I was
[1:20:18] just talking with a man amen uh kind of
[1:20:21] On The Fringe of the message
[1:20:23] I was just talking with him and I just
[1:20:25] laid it out I just felt so bold it was
[1:20:27] almost scary I just laid it out to him I
[1:20:29] said
[1:20:31] look this is how it is it's not between
[1:20:35] you and them and them and them has there
[1:20:37] been rotten preachers in the
[1:20:39] message I thought I'd hear an
[1:20:45] aen is that going to stop this bride
[1:20:47] from going no sir amen all the nickan
[1:20:51] all the deceivers all the wolves and
[1:20:53] sheep's clothing my brother and sister
[1:20:56] none of that is going to stop this bride
[1:20:59] she's going to take all of the word and
[1:21:01] the word said I'm here to deliver you
[1:21:04] and she believes the word amen so there
[1:21:07] can be a whole world full of deceiving
[1:21:09] Wolves Out Here dressed up any way they
[1:21:11] want saying they have Revelation and
[1:21:13] anointing and a word from the Lord and
[1:21:16] if that word don't line up with God's
[1:21:18] word then we know right where they're at
[1:21:20] and we're done with that amen hallelujah
[1:21:23] it's time for this bride to have this
[1:21:25] kind of confidence that the word is
[1:21:27] anchored in our soul wait wait wait let
[1:21:30] me take a little snippet for a DNA
[1:21:32] sample you are the word amen amen you're
[1:21:35] not just in the word you're not just
[1:21:37] around the word you're not just hearing
[1:21:39] the word you are the word amen thank you
[1:21:44] Lord amen
[1:21:47] hallelujah you know lift the veil even
[1:21:51] further Lord that's what I would ask
[1:21:53] don't let there even be one thing that's
[1:21:55] right hidden from this bride that's
[1:21:58] right
[1:21:59] Hallelujah now look let me move forward
[1:22:03] here in the message 19571 I'm finding
[1:22:07] some real nuggets in these old sermons
[1:22:10] amen prophet of God says in the sermon
[1:22:13] Ministry explained he said and now you
[1:22:17] go you ought to go and look these up
[1:22:19] yourself amen uh and read the whole
[1:22:21] context imagine how long a service would
[1:22:23] be if we read all the Prelude and the
[1:22:26] following of every one of these
[1:22:28] thoughts then when you accept
[1:22:32] it comma right space of
[1:22:35] time when you accept it a
[1:22:39] space you believe
[1:22:42] it and somebody say let's see if you
[1:22:45] look any
[1:22:49] different sister Betty retif
[1:22:53] brother bram's coming Johannesburg South
[1:22:57] Africa they're going to meet brother
[1:22:59] brandham they've heard about his
[1:23:01] ministry they have those that they know
[1:23:04] that have experienced that and they are
[1:23:07] so excited to meet brother brandham
[1:23:09] sister Betty goes gets her hair trimmed
[1:23:12] and permed and all done you know
[1:23:15] manicure everything is just fine going
[1:23:17] to meet brother brandham they sat there
[1:23:18] in a service that night and brother
[1:23:21] brandham preaches
[1:23:24] and she's sitting there
[1:23:26] going Lord forgive me that very day she
[1:23:31] had her
[1:23:33] haircut and Revelation penetrated
[1:23:36] everything down into her
[1:23:38] soul and she is sitting there almost
[1:23:40] ashamed afterwards because they have
[1:23:42] this appointment or this scheduled time
[1:23:44] to meet brother brandom and she's
[1:23:45] ashamed to come in his presence and they
[1:23:48] know more than come together and she
[1:23:50] says brother brandom and she pours her
[1:23:52] story
[1:23:53] out and brother brandham said sister
[1:23:57] Betty when your hair finally gets down
[1:23:59] below your shoulders and stuff God will
[1:24:01] hear your
[1:24:03] prayer gets out the car and walks
[1:24:08] off you know what he
[1:24:10] says he said the minute sister Betty you
[1:24:15] received the
[1:24:17] word god looked at you as though your
[1:24:20] hair that's it was long right and
[1:24:23] flowing that's exactly right she told
[1:24:25] this to Sister Jerry and I face to face
[1:24:28] this not a second or third hand kind of
[1:24:30] story and she
[1:24:32] said I never even was even a thought to
[1:24:36] ever do something to my hair after that
[1:24:39] yes sir and she said my heart trembled
[1:24:42] at the grace of God Amen that the moment
[1:24:46] she believed in God's eyes it was
[1:24:51] so oh my my brother and sister I think
[1:24:53] it's time for us maybe to start maybe
[1:24:55] even vocalizing if we need to I believe
[1:24:57] Lord amen not just words to satisfy man
[1:25:00] but from the soul to say Lord I believe
[1:25:03] amen I believe amen amen now look at
[1:25:07] this I got to hurry along here then we
[1:25:09] accept it you believe it and somebody
[1:25:10] said well let's see if you look any
[1:25:12] different why you still got brown eyes
[1:25:14] you still got the same as you was you
[1:25:17] can't show nothing that you are saved
[1:25:20] only your testifying of the Unseen amen
[1:25:25] what is it we see can I say Amen to that
[1:25:29] can you say Amen to that we the world
[1:25:31] might not see but when we have received
[1:25:34] that and been anointed by the Holy Ghost
[1:25:36] we see amen we know the
[1:25:39] difference you can't show that you're
[1:25:41] saved only testifying of the Unseen your
[1:25:44] faith says you're saved then you what
[1:25:46] you do you believe you're saved amen and
[1:25:49] then you say you're saved and then you
[1:25:53] act like you're saved and then you
[1:25:56] associate with those that are saved
[1:25:58] that's right and it works
[1:26:00] righteousness ain't that right and after
[1:26:02] a while everybody knows that you're
[1:26:05] saved hallelujah amen but it all starts
[1:26:09] with us just simply believing that's it
[1:26:13] amen
[1:26:19] hallelujah we'll just stop right here
[1:26:23] sister be if you'll
[1:26:25] come hallelujah amen Oh by God's
[1:26:30] grace my I'm sure glad we're not going
[1:26:34] by our vision that's right because I
[1:26:37] tell you
[1:26:38] what just give you an example in the
[1:26:40] natural I come home from work this
[1:26:43] evening afternoon however you want to
[1:26:44] call it or whatever it was today maybe

[1:26:51] like
[1:26:52] it was
[1:26:54] lunchtime and I'm thinking I got food on
[1:26:56] my
[1:26:58] face and she's
[1:27:00] like then she
[1:27:03] said your mascara is
[1:27:07] slipping you got to understand what kind
[1:27:09] of girl I'm married
[1:27:12] to but you see I had grease and dirt on
[1:27:15] my
[1:27:16] face I can't see it I hope you follow my
[1:27:20] analogy I can't see it
[1:27:22] without it being revealed to me that's
[1:27:25] right I don't know what I look like
[1:27:27] that's it but by God's grace our vision
[1:27:31] is opened up and we don't see a filthy
[1:27:36] character we see Sons and Daughters of
