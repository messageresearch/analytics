knows what I need Hallelujah do you know that God knows your need he knows what you need is he able to bring it to pass amen then you have no worries amen that's right because he said put you first the kingdom of God and then all these other things that go with your Rel relationship with Christ everything about it will be added unto you amen your needs everything will be added that's what he said so put him first who is he the word he's the word amen we're we're we know that he the word is with us right now here because where two or three are gathered together in my name there he said I will be in their midst so if you're gathered here in his name not just just a statement but a relationship in his name I will be in their midst see he's here so what manner of people ought we to be when the word is coming forth not the word of a man if I want to bring the word of a man I have no it would do nothing for you God uses man but it's not the man's intelligence it's God's word it's God's will it's God using a gift that doesn't make the man any different than any other man it doesn't even save a man gifts and callings are without repentance he were born with them amen we've got to know him we've got to know him not just know about him we've got to know him as life amen that's why we're here this morning we've gathered here to meet him not to meet me to meet him I'm expecting him to use this vessel and speak through this vessel are you willing to receive his word that's the next thing see God will work when you pull on the gift you on the word God will speak amen that's right it's what he said so God bless you our brother just visitor God be with you happy to have you and uh I'm just going to say something here this morning this may be a little rich but I'm carrying on with a little series that I've had this will be the end of it and I'm expecting God to cap it off amen I believe we have a Capstone messag we have a message that God sent to us as he said he would always would I will do nothing but I reveal my secrets to my servants the prophets they would hold the interpretation of the word for their season you had no right to question that Prophet because God was stepped into him and speaking his word it's not the man it's God that's right amen the sword put in put was put in his hand but God held the sword amen it's not it's not a king sword it was the king sword amen William brandom is not the king that's right William brandom was a king just as you and I are Kings he made us Kings and Priests that's right that's right see we're not he's got the sword and he's here to cut away everything in your life against you and against your relationship with God if you'll let him do it he will for the bride amen we God has a bride do you know God has a bride the bir said he has a bride amen so a bride knows her Lord and the uniting time is on we know that the marriage the marriage is come we're going to a Rapture we're going to a wedding supper there's a union taking place that the world knows nothing about but it's according to his promise that he said it would take place and and he'll fulfill every promise so we see him fulfilling his word amen if you'll stand with me let's have a word of prayer what what I'm going to say you might disagree with you may disagree but if you'll just go back to the word and search it out and if I'm wrong I don't know it if you're wrong maybe you don't know it so Lord may you help us all amen amen you may question that's fine but we know the scripture is dual Revelation and we see a happening in this hour we say faith taking hold in the bride because what she has in her is God's faith and it's moving in her and that's who she is Faith is not a hope so faith is not an imagination faith is a no so the Bible said faith is the substance of things hoped for it's a substance it's not something you imagine or you think you have it's something you know you have and it's a substance of things that the promise of the word gives you and it's the evidence of Things Not Seen and there's the Believers they believe that they walked with it amen they held to it amen God God requires patience he gives you patience to see that word manifest and if you'll hold that word steady and not take anything else don't add to it take away from it God will fulfill his promise amen praise the Lord how he does it when he does it that's not my business or yours but he's always perfect in all his ways and he said he made your way perfect so let's pray ask him to bless his word Heavenly Father we thank you for this opportunity that we have to speak the word of the Lord and speak a word in season to them Lord that are of that season you always had a word in season you've always had a word through these Seven Ages that True Believers in those ages believed it and they held with it Lord and they were sealed away under that message and Heavenly Father we thank you for this opportunity we have Lord to see you come down in this day as you said you would and the full mystery of God would be finished we thank you for this finish Lord Lord we're we're growing in it it's growing in a bride it's growing in the formation of a bride and Lord we see a bride taking ma uh maturing she's maturing she's she's coming to that full stature and we give you praise for it because Lord soon we're going to meet our loved ones soon we're going to be caught up and meet you in the air and Lord but the revelation of that and the revealing of that that brings the bride to that position is happening right now we thank you for it Lord we know that a lot of the public may not know it but it's known to your little bride she's the one that holds your presence she's the one that's holding your spirit she's a part of your presence and she's here to reveal your presence in flesh and we thank you for your mercy and Grace bless your word bless it to each individual take your Liberty Lord with your servant I and myself can do nothing Lord I'm expecting and and depending upon you to speak your thoughts and I'm expecting you to close my mouth if I should be begin to say anything Lord you open the mouth of a mule one time and spake you can close my mouth Lord you can also open it and so father I thank you for your greatness and Grace for you're here to give to your bride you're here to impart life and now Lord the question is are we willing to receive that life we thank you for it now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen turn with me to chapter 19 of Revelations Revelations the 19th Chapter we know that the mystery of God the Bible said by a by a messenger in this day there would be a seventh angel a seventh Messenger to the final age which is leoda and we know that he had a message and that message is catching away a bride because that message is coming is in manifestation and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit don't forget this the manifestation of the word promised for this hour is inl flesh and the manifestation of that through flesh is catching away not will is is catching away a bride amen amen so Revelations 1911 and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and that's exactly who spake in in the me to the messenger in leoda the faithful and true witness amen the beginning of the creation he's faithful and true and in righteousness he does judge and make war notice he doth judge and make war all right I want you to hold these little places his eyes his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself amen notice he himself only knew that it was only to him that could know it now I'm just going to drop a little secret in his bride is himself all right and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood amen Mighty conqueror see he redeemed us through the blood he was clothed in a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called not his name is but his name is called the word of God and the armies which were in heaven I don't want were in heaven to to stumble you because we we'll come for that in just a few minutes because the and I'm not saying that isn't dual Revelation I'm not saying we're going to come from heaven and and and and walk right back out in the Millennium absolutely we'll we'll see we'll see we'll see the slaughter of the Antichrist we'll see it amen we'll see it happen it's got to happen on Earth in a place called MTO amen they're all coming facing right up there right now aren't they coming right to that slaughtering time but what brings them to that is a battle and what the battle is it's the sword goes out and slays the enemy right okay so now the armies which were in heaven followed him also upon white horses as he rode the White Horse follows him on a white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean we know the fine linen white and clean is the white righteousness it's the righteousness of saints which is the literal life of Jesus Christ yes amen and out of his mouth I want you to notice out of his mouth whose mouth his mouth what is his mouth amen it's his body amen amen all right and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations and that is also denominations because denominations is Antichrist right amen amen they form their own religion put a period after it separate the people and it's never was God's way never did God ordain and and make a denomination it's man's doing amen God gave us his word and that settled it that word is what ties and binds the bride of Christ every member of his body together is the word not organization not denomination not Council of churches amen all right and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth The Wine Press of the fierceness and Wrath of almighty God and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written King of Kings and Lord of lords amen amen you may be seated I would like you to go with me to Isaiah chapter 61 I'm going to read a few more scriptures to lay down here the foundation of what it will speak this morning Isaiah chapter I didn't have time to Mark these off so I've just got to look for them as well as you look them up so we'll just do that and it's right near the end there Isaiah and brother brandham preaching a message and you may hear me say brother brandham I'm referring to a prophet sent in this hour with the spirit of Elijah if you don't want to believe that but it's the promise of the word before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord the the Lord would send that Spirit of Elijah back on a man just like he did Elijah Elisha John the Baptist and now a messenger for our day and one yet to Israel amen all right but we've had a message and the message is what makes separates us and divides and separates that wheat that seed from the shuck all right because the shuck is bundled together the bride is separated amen all right now they're bundling together right under a council of churches they're bundling together in the world Council they're all coming together saying for Fellowship but God never did ordain Fellowship that way the fellowship with him was with his word how can two walk together except they be agreed and what do they agree upon there's no Foundation they're agreeing upon there's no gospel they're agreeing upon they're agreeing upon man's denominational teaching which Satan gave to Eve right in the very beginning and that church the woman is a dominating female that's contrary to the word of God Amen and they're coming under that headship of Rome not communism you don't have to fear communism communism is going to stand up for the bride and destroy that Vatican going to destroy that Beast amen just like ju in the Bible rose up against Jezebel amen who amen who destroyed Jezebel who was ordained to destroy Jezebel who's that Jezebel today that religious Beast that religious false prophet out here right and it's going to take the head of the whole thing though the people never did Envision it that b watch it come to pass it's coming under politic politics and religion and Satan's move right there it's exactly where it's coming I may never heard it that way but you're hearing it now because that's that's the truth she had daughters that prostitute that she the church in Revelation 17 had daughters she was a she's a and she had daughters which were PR prostitutes that's right yes and she had daughters who are those daughters she was the first organized Church she had daughters every denomination every every I don't care if it's Methodist Baptist those are Blasphemous names amen I'm not talking about the people I'm talking about the system the system is a dominating system and it tries to warm its way even into the very around the message today it's that same spirit amen that's right all right I don't know why it's said all that but I'm I'm saying it just the same go back to Isaiah 61 brother Brown preached a message called this day the scripture is fulfilled and we're taking this here in the second verse because he stood up to read the scriptures in Nazareth and he took the book from the hand of the priest the priest handed it to him and he turned to this scripture and he read these scriptures proclaimed the acceptable year of the Lord and he stopped I'm just quoting a part of that but he stopped handed the book back and sat down and precious words come out of his lips amen that anointing was that power in control amen he was breaking forth the word for That season and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears we have a Prophet come back now in the second coming of Christ that was the first coming in the second coming of Christ the word which is the anointed word he comes back with the this now and the second half is the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn I want you to notice first coming to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord the second coming is to proclaim the Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn what's he doing the messenger comes with a trumpet and the trumpet sounds the trumpet and it calls for war it declares war a spiritual war amen are you with me is that right all right so so we we're just laying this out now I want you to go to Second Thessalonians 2 Thessalonians as I said you may not see this you may not believe it that's all right that's I I got to preach what's on my heart all right second Thessalonians chapter 1 verse 7 and you who are troubled rest anybody troubled these are troubling times aren't they troubling politics troubling times trouble all over it's a Babylon it's confusion nobody knows where to stand and what to think and how to even think fear is coming upon man amen is that right of the things that are coming to pass upset weather everything what is it it's judgments of God coming into manifestation more and more amen we're moving into that why because this nation has rejected the word because we had a prophet with the word and they turned him down the denominational system turned him down put him out and we find in in in Revelations 3 that he was on the outside of the church they put him out they put the word out wouldn't have it rule over him amen is that right but he was knocking on the door of the church saying anyone any individual that will open this door the knob was on the inside will open the door I will come in and Su with him and he with me and to him that overcometh now we're talking about overcoming we're talking about the Overcomer this morning and we're talking about the word of overcoming yes amen that word is riding that word is going forth that overcoming and to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne as I have overcome the same way how did he overcome and how did you overcome by the word and so and to him that overcometh I'll Grant to sit with me in my Throne as I also have overcome and set with my father in his throne but then we see a corner turning and then Revelations which we haven't got to we'll come to in a minute Revelations 4:1 amen we went into a bride time there's a bride age okay now so we see now he said in verse 7 and to you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels with his might Angels how many know what we're talking about here with this seven of them seven angels that's already happened brother sister that's already come to path acts 1 19-11 is already taken place and we're and he's unveiling himself in an invisible Union with his bride for the marriage is come now this sounds very strange I know some of you think I've never heard this before no you haven't because they've turned down the system of denomination has turned down that opened revealed word from Heaven they wouldn't take it they wouldn't accept it God turned right away from them amen and open those Seven Seals to an undenominational word born bride yes amen yes amen and there's a union taking place and he's come down to make that Union and and the word is becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming the word by that Union amen all right and so we see here rest with us when the Lord shall be who shall be revealed now if you take that we can go if we had time again we've taken it in the past two three services first Thessalonians 4:16 the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout a message a message to who directed to who yes the elect the for ordained of God God has an elect bride God has predestinated because he knew what they would do he said I've chosen You by forn knowledge I've chosen you and ordained you that you should bring forth fruit and and cuz I knew what you would do you'd choose me amen and we had a choice but God put us on free moral agency knowing he would knowing but he had to put it on free moral agency and we had to make a choice but our choice is made because we are ordained to make that choice take the choice with the word there's always been that elect few there wasn't very many in the time of John the Baptist just a few there wasn't the time of Jesus just a few 70 left him he said turned to the 12 and said would you go also he said where would we go Peter said you have the words of eternal life and so we where would we go where are we going to go we know that God has Vindicated his word of eternal life and has spoken it and we're receptive of it and we hear it and it's being manifested and that manifestation as it said is catching away a bride all right so and my my title today is the catching of way of Christ the bride that's my title catching way of Christ the bride and I want to put under that the summons to come away move is on for the bride the summons has come forth the summons the call has been made Come Away bride move a move is on for the bride he said that's thus sayeth the Lord the move is on for the bride how many believe he said we're in the raptured time well the raptured time wasn't the Leo to see and age we've come beyond that we've come out of dark denominationalism you didn't find Rapture time there you found the Rapture time in the unveiled word that's Rapture time that's what day we're in amen so we're in the Rapture time and he said the it's got to come to that full manifestation of the Rapture so does revelation have to come to the full manifestation amen all right and but we're in that manifestation we're we're following all right now following who so rest with us when when Lord be revealed from heaven with his mighty Angels how in flaming fire taking Vengeance what's the second half of of Isaiah 61 Vengeance proclaiming Vengeance taking Vengeance on them who know not God and Obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ they turn it down they rejected it all right now who shall be punished with Everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord what has to go forth to do that the sword what's he going to slay his Enemy by the sword how is Satan Bound by a chain of Revelation a chain of circumstances amen that's exactly what it is and and and that chain of that Revelation spoken binds that devil and cast him away what's the key I'm talking about Revelations 20 now we may get to it we may not but Revelation 20 there was an angel that had the key to the bottomless pit right and that key was a was a key of Revelation and those circumstances which were happening facts happening circumstances here I I've got it right here I didn't plan to read this until now but a a circumstance is the fact or condition connected with or revent to an event or action and our event is that heaven is opened all right and and and set it's a set of conditions is a circumstance it's a set of conditions okay all right now we'll come into that maybe a little bit later here all right so in flaming fire taking Vengeance on them that know not God obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ and shall be punished with Everlasting duck destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power when he shall come when he shall come when is this when is this when he shall come to be glorified in his Saints and to be admired in all them that believe because our testimony Our Testimony we're coming to that in a moment there's a way we overcome because our testimony among you was believed in that day in that day okay what day are we talking about our day wherefore we also pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of this calling and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of Faith with power that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you and ye in him amen according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ all right now second Corinthians no I'm sorry let's go to Song of Solomon so we see the summons is is to come and this day we're speaking here this day our day this day the day we're speaking of here is being fulfilled amen amen so we're being over here to I got to get to it in is Song of Solomon okay chapter 2 verse 10 my beloved spake this is the voice of the bridegroom to the bride my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away Isaiah 60 said thy light is come bride Rise and Shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee where did I just read that the glory of the Lord be risen upon amen the glory of the Lord will be risen upon thee and how he says my beloved spake and said did he did our beloved speak in this day our beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my love my love who is she his love who is she himself God is love it's different than a filal love friendship love it's a higher love than that Amen brother Brown described it as well the scripture described as Jesus walking through the multitude went to one man but they're laid Halt and M and and children and everything everything in the and and a god of compassion and love but he said we don't know what compassion is we don't know what love is because love fio is not fio of most people have a fio only the bride has AG gape amen only the bride has agape love that's God's Own love that's a higher love than a friendship love that's a higher love than between you and your wife that's a higher love than that that's a love what is the word revealed for the season that you're able to receive in you and that's the true love for the Brethren that's the true love for the word amen and he said that compassion they thought he was a god of compassion but he said we don't know what God compassion is compassion he said is doing the will of God agape love is doing the will of God he said he was a god of love amen that's right but he passed them all by and went to one but here he is speaking rise up and I don't mean to get sidetracked here but rise up my love my fair one how fair is she just as Fair as he is he's the fairest of 10,000 the little of the valley is that right how fair is the bride she's pretty fair not in man's God Man's eyes but in God's eyes she came from him a part of him she came from him I he she was chosen in him before the foundation of the world Ephesians 1:4 she the bride was chosen in God before the foundation of the world to be without blame before him in what love come away my bride come away my love my fair one and come away all right verse 13 the Fig Tree putteth forth her green figs Israel and the vines with tender grape give a good smell Arise My Love My Fair one and come away all right Revelations 41 a message went forth a message to call the bride a message has gone out how many believe that what's it doing it for calling a bride into that Union calling a bride into that love affair calling calling her come away come away watch Revelations 4:1 and after this I looked and behold after this after what remember the Bible said he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and that's the Overcomer he that hath an ear to hear that's the Overcomer all right and after this I looked and behold the door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard what first voice Revelations 10 or Revelations 1:10 said I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet is that right and he said right here and I looked and behold a door was open after this I looked and behold a door was opened in where Heaven consists of what the word I've got that written right here as a quote if you want to know brother Bram said Heaven is consisted of the word all right but Heaven oh the door was open and who's the door he unveiled himself there was a door open he opened it and now you're invited Bri you're invited your call has come your summons has come right right come here come the doors open and the first voice which I heard as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up higher or hither come up hither brother Rand used the word come up higher come up hither come up to where I'm at come up come up into this unveiling come through the door you can't get into that sheet fold any other way you're not going to get into that that wedding that this Feast any other way amen you can't get into it any other way but you come through the door and you have to be dressed a certain way to get through that door amen that's right amen you got to be dressed in fine linen clean and white yeah which is the white the righteousness of God himself so it's a personal relationship with you and God a birth a new creation in you the creation of the word the word birthed which is Jesus Jus Christ the same yesterday today and forever must be a divine revelation in you and from that point it's from Faith to Faith Faith to Faith Revelation to Revelation glory to glory he's changing me and the change is taking place amen and so and the trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter something's going to happen there's something Supernatural going to happen and brother brandham said in the message I well I can't remember what message but I'll read it something happened the other day I have the it's 41263 412 evening if you want to look it up something happened the other day you read it you heard the tape seven Thunders what time is it sir he's asking what time is it sir and in that message that question was answered It's The End we're arrived it's the end it's the end of time it's the end it's the end we're we're here all right he said what time is it sir see and then he said again it happened the other day how do you know he said what happened the other day the seven Thunders it happened the other day and it's a supernatural event and the brother Pro Prophet called it a great event all right he said it happened the other day how do you know the Rapture is not going on all the time he said now you could you could say that there's a dual Revelation there we can say right now now because the Rapture is in progress how do you know the Rapture is not going on all the time and the last one will be caught away he says that just a moment I'll just read that all right but we also can say the Rapture can take place and there many won't even know it happened and he's saying to them how do you know the Rapture is not taking place amen all the time the bride is Forgiven she goes straight to glory in a rapture she goes straight to glory in a Rapture brother Bram said Revelation 4:1 is a Rapture amen I believe that don't you but how's the Rapture what how what happens the Rapture is taking place and there's conditions for that Rapture found in Psalms 27 brother Ram said that the condition let's read Psalm 27 the conditions for the Rapture he said he read that message hide me away I'm hid in his Pavilion in the SEC secret of his Tabernacle he hides me Rapture I'm raptured it's progressing it's growing in the bride it's growing there's a union growing coming to a full Union and a body change we're on our way now this is contrary to every Theologian every seminary in the country God never planned seminaries he didn't give seminaries in fact Satan that serpent that's what he fed to Eve his Seminary his theological teaching and knowledge of the word word and just change one word surely you'll not die God said they would and when she accepted that they died and she brought forth a cane which was not Adam's son right no place in the scripture does say Cain Adam was Cain's father no place not one place it said he was of the evil one that's right he was a different seed than it than than Abel right because Abel by revelation offered of of sacrifice and Cain wouldn't receive it though God said you you would be okay if you would receive it and offer it like Abel did but he refused it he put the word out he would not let the word have his way why because of knowledge human his own religious knowledge Eve was deceived amen what started to fall the woman she turned around and gave to the man and he partook because Adam had to Adam was not deceived Adam knew what he was doing Adam knew that when he partook like this death would set in on the earth is that right but what did he do it for because because because of the Redemption promise had to come to pass there had to be one come that was born of a woman that would be without sexual and would be born virgin and he and the and his Bible said were were born were saved by the blood of God Jesus was not Jew Jesus was not of a of Jacob Jesus was not of Eve I mean excuse me Mary amen no sir it wasn't Mary Zan it wasn't Joseph's germ it was a spoken word birth and she the Bible said the Holy Ghost will how's this going to be the Holy Ghost will overshadow you and that Holy one that will be born of you will be the will be Emanuel Son of God Christ the word and she that said so be it your handmaid so be it unto me according to thy denomination thy teaching no according to Thy word amen is that right Let It Be according to Thy word Lord and she conceived and she went to Elizabeth Elizabeth's house said how can this be you mean you don't you I thought you and Joseph weren't married we're not and you're bearing a a child yes yes this is what God Said talk about unusual talk about strange amen but the Bible said a virgin shall conceive why was it virgin Why didn't it come like any other man but he had to come to a woman to reverse the crime in order for the Holy One to shed his blood and give himself just like Adam did to save Eve he had to have as germ broke in her amen or God would have destroyed her but because of his love for her he gave his life for her and lost the headship over the Earth okay enough of that I don't know why I'm saying that but anyway you know where we're going now and why we believe what we believe we believe the word of God the blood of Jesus Christ is what redeemed you and I and faith in that blood brings forth the Holy Spirit of that blood to come and live in you that's the new birth yes amen that's the real birth that's the token that you and I must have without that token you will never see a change of your body you can be justified you can be Sanctified and not have the Holy Ghost you can shout You Can Dance you can cast out Devils you can speak in tongues and prophesy and it be right and still not have the Holy Ghost and go to hell your spirit realm your Spirit man can be Anointed with a genuine anointing of the Holy Ghost and that Soul still be as black as soot because it's a wrong seed so who are we saying that'll be the ones riding following him on white horses that elected seed that elected bride she can follow no other she has to follow him and she's going to follow him right into a Rapture right into a body change right into the re Resurrection itself because what's happened in I inside of us is a resurrection it's already risen what a resurrection that was when Jesus raised up when he raised up I raised with him when he came out of the Grave I came with him because I was in him there he was the fullness of the godhead bodily and every one of his children were in him then in seed form amen exactly all right so so you see here there's a door been open and another voice said come up higher come up hither come away my love am all right now so Revelations 18 4-8 said very similar he said another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sins that receive not of her plagues the light has come walk in the light come out of her that dark denominationalism come out of her it come out of her her come out of her who's her daughters come out of that denominational sister come out of her always in the Bible she was represented as a church she is the church why because that's exactly what the church the church is the one that fell amen deceived beguiled is that right that's right he amen amen amen you see what I don't can't go any further with that but you see what took place why Adam had to take her showing Redemption God took us because he loved us we were in him to begin with he poured out his life for us amen is that right he took he took the Judgment we stand the bride the bride of Christ stands no judgment she'll never stand before a white throne and be judged in fact the said know you not that the Saints shall judge okay hold that because the Saints shall judge where's the Judgment given to the Saints and we can't even you said you can't even decide from just things that come up in the church and you you take it to a law here and take it between men instead of taking it to the bride that could ought to be able to judge that difference and discern what is right and wrong is that right all right now oh my there so much see keeps opening so in I'll just read this further since I'm in the 18th chapter verse 6 reward her for her sins he said come out of her and be not partakers of her sins you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached into heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities iniquity is doing knowing to do good and will not do it reward her even as she reward Ed you and double look at look at who's who's this given to speaking of the Bride speaking come out of her because she reward her even as she rewarded you and double under her double according to her works in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double think of that all right therefore I'm just skipping here well not I won't how much more how much has she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she hath said in her heart I sit as a queen and no Widow and shall see no sorrow that's exactly that's exactly leoa I'm rich have need of nothing and know you not the Bible said that you're blind wretched naked miserable and don't know it should I say it yeah I guess I will he said if if that woman and not only the church spiritual is naked because you see the woman of the world out there the way they are dressed and naked absolutely nude I mean nude right and then what are that what's that showing the condition of the church natural she's naked she's blind she's miserable and don't know it but religious to the hilt Satan was more religious than the he was a he was right up there in heaven a chief is that right he was a chief cherub she he was right at the he was right shadowing Over The Mercy Seat Fallen sin didn't begin on Earth sin began in heaven and he was kicked out and came to the earth and the battle started right there where's the battle taking place in human beings amen your mind is the Battleground all right so we see here therefore her plagues will come in one day and and death and mourning and famine she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her how does he judge by the word okay now St John 11 St John 11 we see something taking place here portrayed amen first of all I point you to the fact that verse 11 Jesus was asked to come and because lazarus's friend was sick and he was asked to come and he kept delaying he wouldn't come and then after 4 days I think it was he said after that he he these things said he after that he saith unto them our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may awake him out of sleep Matthew well he said and then they said well he does good if he sleeps he do well Jesus spake of his death they thought that he had spoken of of the rest of his rest and sleep then said Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is dead why did he say the little daughter she's not dead she sleeps why did he talk to Lazarus sleeping because he rose up the Lazarus went in the grave came out of the Grave amen is that right the Jesus that when in the grave comes out of the grave and these Believers that are in the grave right here sleeping now today will rise out of there amen amen just exactly what he said said if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ shall also Quicken your mortal body yes by his spirit that dwth in you he say Well they're gone they're gone on well but that spirit's still on them bones Elijah died and was thrown in a pit too and a man was running for his life away from the enemy and they threw the man into the pit because they couldn't carry him and get away from the enemy and soon as he hit those bones he raised up find that in the scripture it's in there where was that quickening power amen it was on those bones why because God dwelt in Elijah if God could do that under the Bulls sacrifice of bulls and goats what about the literal Christ himself the life of God living in you if it raised him out of the Grave did not it say it would also raise you out you're sleeping I the body sleeping not you you've left that body you've gone into a theophany body if this Earth Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting Eternal in the heavens amen but what will that body do that has to come back and pick up that body laying down there because it's got to rise again amen that becomes then a glorified body and we live on this Earth we build we inhabit we we sleep we eat okay that's enough of that I've gone off my track now all right now let's go back here Jesus said he's sleeping then he went to the grave of Lazarus and they said if you had been here my brother would not have died and that's a Martha speaking to him but he said I'm the resurrection and life he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die amen I am the Lord I am the resurrection and the life I am the resurrection and the life hold that the resurrection and the life amen yes how many's raised from death yes the Bible said you have passed from Death To Life Sounds like a resurrection to me not of this body but of my soul is that right a new creation and that new creation has got to be birthed out of this body into a new one hello are we in the message have we been feeding on the message I wonder do you realize what we're saying amen all right all right now so he she goes and and she comes here and he says now believest thou this he that believeth in me shall never die he that believeth in me was in me before the foundation of the world he was my thought of him of myself that was that that person that believeth in me was the thought of myself there's only one real believer that's the faith of God that's God God in you is is the believer amen amen that's who the believer is not this man David you try to make yourself believe you can't make yourself believe it's a quality given to you that's right amen all right so so he goes at and then secretly watch this she said yes Lord Martha said yes Lord I believe thou are the Christ the son of the god that should come in the world and when she had said so said she went her way and called called Mary her sister secretly just like he's calling some today right now secretly he's calling secretly Come Away who's he speaking to who's going to hear him who's going to receive it who have heard our report that's right amen who believes the report amen it's those that believe the report of those that it's revealed to what are they going to do come away all right so he said she went secretly to her sister not openly not a public show it was a secret she had a message she had a voice she had a she was a voice to her sister and what did she say saying the master has come and calleth for thee and what' she do as soon as she heard that she Rose quickly and came into him that's what happened to me that's what's happening to you yes amen that's maybe what happening I trust here this morning it's happening amen all right so so he see over here then then he comes to the Grave wh have you laid him and he comes down to this grave he said move the stone they had to take away the stone and when he had thus spoken he cried with a loud voice look at the loud voice watch this loud voice if you go back to the message Rapture brother R puts emphasis on that loud voice the Rapture message to you Bride is a loud voice and with a loud voice he says like a lion roars with a loud voice he said Lazarus come forth let him speak to you where are you today have you come forth you were dead you were sleeping but there was a voice a shout coming the bridegroom cometh arise to go meet him the bridegroom's coming and they all rose up some had the Revelation because they had oil in their vessel the other didn't and they couldn't catch what was being said give us of your Revelation give us of your faith we only have enough for ourselves go get it where we got it go back to the word feed on the word how many times have you heard it feed on the open book am that's exactly right am all right you're you're hearing the voice again go feed on the book he's speaking to somebody this morning am Lazarus maybe put your name in it come forth Mrs Jesus Christ come forth It's a name revealed only to you come forth amen what name was it spoken in and who heard it those that had the name nobody else knows it but you go call your sister go call your brother go go call them under her message Meer this bride will be the final voice to the final age caller Lazarus then what was it what happened after that loose him how by the word loose him let him go leave me alone I feel good this way it let me go amen those wrappings of death have taken off me I'm not coming to death this cycle of death this cycle of death has been stopped it's actually been stopped because the word Christ himself has opened up himself and those that he come higher they've come up into a realm of that third pole they've come into the realm of the inside of the inside they've come to meet that shikina and realize that's who I am and now seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus all right it's a secret catching away he'll come in an hour that you think not you will know nothing about it she'll be gone it's too late then something happened she knew about it it's just not a blind thing something was happening he'll come in an hour that you think not and he is absolutely is and they'll Rapture will take place and they won't know what even happened but she knows because she sees him she's heard her voice She's Come Away she's come to her love She's United with him she can't miss it because she's identified in him before the foundation of the world to be his elect word hallelujah this day this scripture is being fulfilled this day it's being fulfilled right now in your midst that very scripture being fulfilled you say I don't know about that then you tell me what's happening out here you tell me what's taking place there's place legs dropping there's all these things dropping why because a bride is following him on the white power of the revealed word amen you say I believe that'll be after the resurrection you okay go I believe that too you're going to follow him right into the resurrection right into the Rapture and right un beyond that even back into the Millennium but as far as slaying him that sword slays him let me get down to that because I've got to get to that in order to close this off amen now Ephesians or second Thessalonians excuse me let's go over there you well yeah let's go over there just a minute second Thessalonians 21 now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of Our Lord hello the mystery that the seven Thunders held and why it was silent secret was that coming yes all right and what does it do have to do with you you see your position in it you're recognizing your day and its message you have awakened this call has awakened a bride what hasn't the world recogniz what hasn't the church recognized the message believing church let me say it that way bride comes out of it I'm not talking about the church bride I'm talking about the bride the church and the bride are different the tribulation Saints is a church but the bride comes out of that church amen are you with me yes because they want to go back and build organization want to go back and build this and do that and do this and do that and they're a help to the people of God and the tribulation saint will get life at the white Throne judgment but this bride is that material that's been taken out and put in a section which is his own his own his own being his own life and she's going home she's marching out of here and step with the word and she's not going down she's going up every step is getting a little higher a little higher a little higher why she's marching with the word she is the word marching out she's going out brother sister this is closing time we've arrived this is closing time amen so Thessalonians said by the coming of the Lord and our gathering together unto him now I'm going to skip down here because you know the rest that I don't need to read read all that now I've read it in the past verse 7 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work and and he but he only he who la leth will let until he be taken out of the way we know that is Christ the bride he Christ because the the promise word for the day that would rise a royal seed would be a royal bride that's the promised word for our day yes the bride is manifesting the promised word for this day not his day this day it's the same person we'll get to that in just a minute all right it's the same person being manifested all right so we go down here and then shall that Wicked after price is taken bride's taken out then that wicked shall be revealed to the public whom the Lord whom the Lord shall consume whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming brother sister that's not future that's happening amen it'll be unveiled but listen the bride's already seeing who she is and by the word by the word of her testimony the spirit the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of what his coming amen all right even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and all deceivableness of unrighteousness and them that perish in them that perish because they they receive not the love of the truth truth that they might be saved and this cause God shall give them strong delusion that they should believe a lie and that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness all right now Ephesians 5 I'm going to get there pretty quick here now so Ephesians 5 my I didn't realize the time you'll have to give me a few more minutes here Ephesians 5 is I've got to make this stick and if you're in a hurry then if you need to make a uh place you need to go or you got to make a a a some way of make an appointment or something that's fine just pick up the message and hear it on as it archived all right 2 Corinthians I'm sorry Ephesians Ephesians 5 and verse 27 that he might present it talking about his bride a wife a wife this is spiritual brother Paul said I speak concerning Christ in the church but representing as the natural between husband and wife that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish now I want to Song of Solomon you don't have to turn I'm going back over there just a quick moment in chapter 4 and look what the look what the the bridegroom says to his bride in chapter 4 in 4 verse 7 Thou Art all fair my love there is no spot in thee there is no spot in thee this is who I'm Fallen away amen without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies so you see whose body we are he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church amen if you're ordained on that ground the holy spirit's here to find you and when it finds you you recognize its call you know the hour you're living you know what these things are these things are supposed to happen quickly you're raptured up to meet it hello hello quickly you're raptured up to meet it now you're setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus what are you above condemnation there's no judgment for the bride because her judgment was paid in Christ Christ took her judgment he was the fullness of the godhead bodily so you were in him then you had to be in him then that's right amen all right I I I got to back off of that all right now as I said there's a summon he calls for his Queen to come stand by his side is that right what what did his call come through he calls for his Queen to come stand by his side know you not that's in the message the breach he said know you not that Saints shall judge the Earth amen so I I took care of Revelation 3 I'm missing I'm bypassing some of this now I want you to turn with me and I'll come back to this in a moment but come with me over to Revelations 12 I know there's a lot of scriptures here but we've got to see it in here now verse 10 you know Satan was kicked out there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon the dragon fought against his angels prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven that's chap verse 8 128 and the Great Dragon was cast out the old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceived the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him verse 10 and and I heard a now watch he comes down here now watch and I heard a voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and stren and strength and the kingdom of our God and the king and the power of His Christ now is coming the kingdom of our God which is in you the word made Spirit made Power and the power of His Christ and the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him how did they overcome him by the blood of of the lamb and By The Sword and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death notice how he he will he would given a heart of a beast at that time Satan will incarnate himself because when the church goes up Satan's cast out are you with me okay where is the church when is the church going up did not he say we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in going where going up you're not going down you know the elevator said going up you stepped into it he stepped into you it's a going all right it's just all of a sudden Satan's defeated he's defeated by the word they overcame him right so when you see he's cast out he's being cast out brother sisters it's it's a chain of circumstances he's being cast out how many believe he being cast out who's casting him out the word is what's the power the same power that power is casting him out who' he give the power to who did our Lord give the power to and you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you amen and you shall be Witnesses unto me for you were with me from the beginning and the beginning was the word and if he was writing the white revelation of the word the word itself and had life in him then what about you right exactly amen you're following him what are you following you're going now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship is going in don't tell me they're not going up they're on their way out going in coming in what's he coming in he's coming in who is going in amen that's right coming in is ride yes he said see what God's trying to do see the Revelation in the hour I'm quoting you from Christ The Mystery of God revealed that's exactly I think it's paragraph 233 now we see that promise being fulfilled this day this scripture is being fulfilled in your midst and and they and they they had that test Tony therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabitant of the earth and the Sea The Devil's come down unto you now he's come down incarnate in a beast the bride's gone because she overcame him by the word and that word that word that come out of of God's own mouth the body the bride and I've got a quote on that brother Ram said that's exactly what it would be what are we growing up into Who We Are what are we growing up into our position our place it's so good to see oursel positionally placed where are we positionally placed in Christ Christ in you and that day this day that Revelation would take a hold you'd know that I'm in you and you and me and if I'm in you and you and me and my word in you and you and me then ask speak what you will and it shall be done then where does the authority lay the authority lays in the word revealed in the bride that's her Authority all right and when the dragon saw now he's now the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time and when the dragon saw that he was cast out into the Earth he P he persecuted the woman which brought forth the Manchild who's that Israel he goes out to persecute Israel the bride's gone yeah you see where we're at here yes we're almost ready to be caught up with the rest of them but what's happening we overcome by the word of our own testimony what's our testimony Jesus Christ is our testimony the white horse rider is our testimony it's Christ all right let's get let's get to a couple key points and then I'll I'll close now look as long as that in intercessor on the throne Satan can't stand there and accuse because the attorney on the other side he's an opponent to Christ amen okay I think we realize that it's Satan said they're guilty Jesus said they're not I just read it to you they're Guiltless sinless Song of Solomon said there's not even a spot in you you're a garden enclosed you're living water flowing up amen 12th verse of that same chapter Song of Solomon 4 all right so what is it now brother sister it's Awakening time she's caught up away in secret she's going up marching Satan is being is being cast out how by the manifestation of the promised word for the hour he's being cast out the condition s cast him out the revelation of the word binds him faith is the key and that messenger come with that faith and imparted it to us opened the door letting us see who we were that spoken word we are that word living the bride is the word living and in action all right so she's writing the same power she he's writing what's her ultimate than what is an ultimate it's a is is the last word the ultimate is the amen it's the end of all Strife your ultimate the real genuine Christian will cope with that inside man that spirit that way back in the Yonder which is the word there you are it's that inside man that inside that will punctuate the word hang with the word regardless she is the word living in action his own his own life amen I could read 1 Corinthians 4:19 but the Bible said the kingdom of God is the word made Power in you all right what are we doing we're following him we're taking the same rout route he took when he putteth forth his bride verse chapter 10 of St John verse 4 and five when he putteth forth his bride he goeth before them amen and they follow him because why they know his voice to know something is to have it they have his voice they know his voice and a stranger they will not follow for they know not the voice of a stranger you see the separating now you see what the bride's walking behind what they're following every day I just speak to Isaac back in the back room we have to die to ourself daily take up our cross follow that word what is it that word is n the even in thy mouth is that right what's this revealed word where is it at tell me who it is that's got the voice under her messenger tell me where the final voice of of this hour is who's she following the one that's gone before third poll the word Heaven opened all right the move is on Amen the move is on for the bride see the move is on the mystery of God Revelation 10:7 the mystery of God should be finish and that's what the Bible has been it's been a work of God that's been covered up and it's been hid since the foundation of the world and its Sevenfold mystery of God promised at this day in the age of the leosan church he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it what a glorious thing all right what is it God in morphe God changing his mask same actor different garment all right God and morphe mask in a pillar of fire god in morphe in a man called Jesus God in morphe in his bride God above us God With Us God in us the condescending of God yes down from his glory what condensation sension excuse me bringing us Redemption that in the dead of night when it was the darkest gross Darkness light appeared rise Shine for thy light bride thee and thee alone thy light is come amen amen so he come down amen up there holy no one could touch him settled the mountain even animal touch it had to die and then God come down and stretched his tent brother Braham said changed his tent and come down and lived with us become one of us we beheld him we held him the Bible said 1 Timothy 3:16 without controversy great is a mystery of godliness for God was manifest In the Flesh handled with hands what about today his bride is not another as bright as himself he's just masked himself in Bride form brother Brown said this message is growing in a bride and is coming forth in the formation of a bride for she's the word manifested for this season not another season she's the revelation of Jesus Christ for this hour and it's growing in her praise the Lord I told you this is heavy but it's the truth it's the truth and the bride loves it I'm not saying who is and who isn't I pray we're all bride yes but if you're bride you're going to hear what the spirit's saying in this day to these churches this church amen amen that's it it's not what I do what you think what I think about it it's God's work it's God's achievement it's God's doing either you have an ear or you don't have an ear I can't make you have an ear you can't make yourself have an ear it's God the quality of God that was a special class of people that had the ability to hear what God said that's all there is to it that's that's special class and that's the quality God gives them to him is his faith his substance that's the quality is the substance of that promise that word Christ in you the hope of glory amen amen all right so we see the Promise being fulfilled now that was God above us God With Us God ate meat God drank water God slept God cried he was one of us beautiful type in the Bible amen so that was God above us God With Us now it's God in us the Holy Spirit not a third person the same person no we don't believe in a trinity you can have all your Trinity you want it come from the devil came from the pits of Hell started through the Beast and that's what it is we believe in a true baptism in Water by in the name not in names the name of Jesus Christ that's right amen and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost which is in you to begin with that Quicken that Holy Ghost comes quickens that seed and brings that seed to life and it's God in you just as I said now it's God in you not another person God above us God With Us his son God in you the same God not two or three Gods the same God amen amen that started from the devil way back from the beginning never did God ever say that here o Israel the Lord thy God is one God right and thou shalt have no other gods before me that's so you don't have one God the spirit God the son if that's the case who is Jesus's father because the Bible said the Holy Ghost was his father that's right so that makes the father somebody else amen he said the Holy Ghost will overshadow you I thought father I thought God was his father well then the Holy Ghost and God must be a different person you see where you get yourself mixed up bu of theology is what it is a trinitarian spirit which is nothing but the devil and from the pits of hell you said you'll suffer for that someday I may suffer for it but I've got a body waiting amen amen I may suffer but remember the prophet said fear not little flock you will endure the truth will separate the truth sets free amen all right so it's not another person not a third person it's the same person that's right it's God in three offices brother sister you're a Triune being you're Soul you have a spirit and you have a body amen but you're one person that's right it's all there is to it right all right now first seal he said we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in going up marching Satan is cast out amen now watch this remember this and I've got I've got I know I'm coming close I've got to close but watch this and I know I'm well aware of it you don't have to make me aware of it I'm well aware of it remember this the only the only thing that these things are R is the display of his attributes you have an attribute it's your thought and you think something then you speak it you take it that's God in the beginning if you ever was or ever will be in heaven you was in heaven to start with and they that were in heaven followed him yes on white horses Revelations 19:14 if you was if you was ever if you ever will be in heaven you was in heaven to start with that's what your Prophet told you you're a part of God you were his thought on page six Now watch how we overcome by the word of Our Testimony now we had him coming last night with his great sword to kill amen talking about the beast on that on that black horse I yeah black horse we find out that he gets killed with the sword too the sword of the word actually it's red horse but they all combine the sword he gets killed with the sword too listen to this now the sword of the word God's word sharp two-edged sword slays him puts him right down wait till them seven Thunders utter their voices to that group who can really take the word of God and hand it there it'll slice and cut and they can close the heavens they can shut this or do that whatever they want to he said Glory he will be slayed by the word that proceeds from his mouth it's sharper than a two-edged sword they they could call for a 100 billion tons of flies if they wanted to amen whatever they say going to happen because it's the word of God coming from the mouth of God Amen who is she the mouth of God where's his voice it's he in her he only works in and through man he works in and through his bride she knows it she has thus sayith the Lord or she keep still now you know what you're growing into all right a seal open the Mysteries unfold and when a mystery unfolds and a trumpet sounds it declares war I've already told you that he already he it declares war and that's exactly what we find in Revelation 19 because after that immediately what's happening come and feast give yourself to the Feast of the fowls what destroyed him the brightness the unveiling the revealing of his coming with the word coming from his mouth you didn't realize this little bride which is Christ has such a place know you not that the Saints shall judge the Earth he's already started War he comes forth to judge Vengeance and what's he do make war Revelations 19111 judges and makes War what's the message doing judging who's speaking it who's declaring it where is it revealed to it's revealed to you as a thought and you speak that thought it's the word of God going forth think of that amen amen amen see I may not get the chance to preach again but this is the Capstone yes amen That's Not My Capstone I'm not talking about that but this this caps off my series but this also is the Capstone message of the seventh angel because whose stature is she growing into what does she come to as maturity who is she she's white stone yes right all right he's the one that opened those seals amen a seals open amen spiritual war he's the one that opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was open what is the opening then of the seals revealing who Christ what's the opening of the seals revealing Christ in what form then it's the bride coming of Christ he's standing there a supreme judge showing that he is Alpha and Omega they took the P every even the very seven angels that represented seven churches all completed and they couldn't even see it I just read it to you out of first Thessalonians 1:7 rest with us when the Lord shall reveal himself with his mighty angels and they couldn't see it they did they took the picture and it's Jesus up there just turn it to the right the way it should be looked at see his nose see his eyes see his all right they took the picture not us and there he is and there he is and there he is this day re acts 1 10 and 11 this acts 111 this day this scripture is fulfilled showing that he is Alpha he standing there Supreme he's standing there his picture was taken there he is standing there Supreme judge standing there Supreme judge showing that he is Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end what an identification what identification quickening power did that for us amen amen it went back again clapped like thunder went back in this he talking about now again in sunset Mountain two years later 64 just before the earthquake in Alaska had that Whirlwind came down and it clapped Thunder three times and it and the voice said judgment striking West Coast that's it all right and it's spreading he's he had a prophet say once again raise raise up declaring not he declaring Christ was declaring I'll ride this again and She'll follow me all right there you are not again somewhere out in the future again this day this scripture is fulfilled am people want to put it they miss it they're looking for great things to happen they're looking for great things that was and missing what's happening right now it's going right through the public right through the world right through the majority of message Believers and they don't even see it how can you say that because the scripture said it everybody's heard the message everybody ate Mana but only a select few could come on the inside of the inside into that shikina amen because they had to be the word first to begin with and that takes it all out of your hands it takes it all out of you trying it takes every bit of it but you lean to what's inside of you you realize I've got to have more of it you've got to have more of him then I can tell you where you'll get more of him and if you have that pull then let go to that pull because that's that third pull trying to open up the word to you trying to see who you are but you're letting this you're letting that you're letting job you're letting this you're letting that take it away from you when God's trying to reveal it to you amen amen the battle started in heaven you were as thought the battle started in heaven amen amen anyway let me get back here I I'm hurrying I'm hurrying believe it I am I and I know I'm taking time but brother sister we got we got rain we got snow let's enjoy the word a few minutes amen all right so he said I tell you he said those that Whirlwind come down he said they said what did it mean he said I want to tell you it's a judgment sign he stood what what's this white hair what's the white represent Heaven opened amen behold faithful and true riding a white horse faithful and true and he does Judge he does Judge and makes War declares war why would he declare war the trumpet the word opened up Satan is against it he's declaring war on the enemy like Israel many times they take the offensive not so much on the defensive he took the offensive yeah amen that's exactly right they took the offensive they go in there they know where the enemy lays and they go in and seek it out and bring the word forth and it stir him up caus it a political disturbance the revealing of the seal caused a political disturbance and the and a trumpet sound causing a political disturbance but also declares spiritual war and if there's spiritual war there's got to be somebody fighting that War and what are they going to fight with the greatest thing that he ever put in in their heart and their hands was the word to defeat the enemy you don't listen to your reasoning you get out of this sense bound condition you're in and take the word of God and stand with it amen that's the only thing that's going through that's the only thing that's going to take a Rapture in a few days he said judgment sign a few days great earthquak is going to strike the west and it won't stop California Los Angeles will sink it's going down she'll slide right into the ocean she's already be to slide well it's just going happen one time maybe not but Los Angeles is going down a big hunk of it he said 1500 mile chunk of it amen and it won't stop California Los Angeles he said it's sinking it's going down she'll slide into the ocean and after two days after that the Alaskan earthquake shook Alaska the biggest earthquake they ever had but brother random said it did not unbalance the Earth yet amen but he said it was a judgment sign and he said it's it's a sign that Jesus Christ had been officially put out of the church crucified again amen now you tell me if there a corner turned Church put him out he came to the bride don't you realize this is seed time or other words I mean this is bride time she's the promised word for this hour and time this season now watch what the prophet said the old battle started at Heaven it'll be finished on Earth in the form of Armageddon that's right now let's watch See Come To The Feast see now let's watch and see it unfold maybe we can unfold it Lord help us to do that right now watch it unfold just like he said in Psalm 27 let's let's take Psalm 27 let's take the conditions for the Rapture okay let's take the conditions for this battle let's say watch it unfold let me see if we can unfold it here and he goes right into deta detail about how it's unfolded this mysterious W riter watch what he does now he said this writer this this Antichrist refuses to go back opposes the true word bride Revelations 1911 May the Holy Spirit come down now the white horse rider brother Braham said May the Holy Spirit come down now the white horse rider while his spirit Spirit of Christ in the face of antichrist and call his own sounds like he's writing call them out Lord may they repent come quickly to you and be filled with oil and wine oil and wine oil and wine all go together in worship oil and wine Holy Spirit and the word the revelation of the word by the spirit is the true worship yes amen all right oil and wine and I'm I'm emphasizing that because I'm getting down to a point here and be changed and be changed from that denominational robe of Cain's death into a snow white robe of eternal life given out by the bridegroom and then they'll go to the wedding supper then they'll go to the wedding supper someday in the Vindicated word of the Resurrection what a resurrection this is what we see today we saw the resurrected life living we saw the resurrected Christ is that right the son of man revealed amen what a Vindicated word that is all right now in Revelations 19 not only is he getting ready but Christ the Antichrist getting ready but Christ he's unfolding it now listen to him unfold it but Christ is getting ready to meet him the battle's going to be hot and heavy Christ in Revelation 19 Christ is gathering Gathering Gathering his not from the four corners of Earth because there's going to be a little bitty Remnant what's he doing he's Gathering them from the four corners of Heaven if you ever were in heaven you were in heaven to begin with yes she's gathering for the four corners of Heaven on a Snow White Horse he also has a name not death but the word of God life amen got it wrote on his thigh here what's got what wrote on his thigh life the word of God's got it wrote that's the only life that's that's the only life because God is the only source of Life there is Zoey zoeey life God's own life eternal life and that's what he said you are you're my eternal my eternal uh uh possession you're my you're my eternal possession if you're his eternal possession you're Eternal he just said you're his eternal am possession okay so he's got death wrote on him and c and so and he's got life riding on a white horse and he got life riding on a white horse and here's a man with three different powers mixed up Called Death Gathering his Earthbound delegates that's what he's doing and Christ is gathering his heaven born subjects heaven born word born subjects all right he's got death wrote on him Christ has got life wrote on him Revelation 17:14 I'm going to read this to you don't turn just to save time here I'm pushing Revelation 17:14 17 I'm in 15 okay 1714 these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them there you are because they've given they've given their mind they've given one mind see and they make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and king of kings and they and I want you to make this note in your heart because this is what the prophet said is happening now and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful that's Revelation 17:14 now you go over to Revelations 1914 same verse it's 14th verse and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean now we'll come down to this and he says here those with him are on white horses also chosen before the foundation of the world they that with him are on white horses also and they are called The Chosen before the foundation of the world Amen and they are faithful to the word amen I like that called chosen before the foundation of the world and then Fai ful to the word by their choosing all stimulated watch oil and wine watch they're all they're following what do they doing they're riding what's what are you riding how are you stimulated they're all stimulated with wine and oil just riding Right Along coming down to meet him coming down to meet who all right coming down to meet him they know the Thunders will issue the thing forth pretty soon amen all right the thing of course he said pretty soon that Thunders are going to issue thing for they the complete revelation of the whole thing they the bride is the complete revelation of the whole thing who Christ the bride so if he's the word and his name is the word then the word is life she must be the word and she must be his life amen all right now I want to say something you may may not believe this but I looked it up to be sure there's only one original color that's white how many knows that there's only one original color anything else is mixed Christ is on a solid white unadulterated word from the beginning amen every color would be white if some chemistry hadn't broke into it amen glory every Church would be standing on the apostolic doctrine of the word of God and God confirming it if it didn't have Creeds and denominations mixed into it there you are only one original color that's white it never mixed with denomination or Creeds no sir amen and remember His Saints are clothed in white robes not mixed with denomination of Creeds now we find out the denomination of Creeds here's what you get your mixed color but this is the original color he's writing the original color is on his people and they've been dipped in Blood and cleansed that garment and set it right back Yonder that's right now what's he doing unfolding the battle those that mix turn pale and go to death there you are those that mix with white turn pale and go to death it's perverting perversion to mix colors with white you pervert the original color you mix anything with it you pervert it no matter how good it may seem how reasonable how right truth and error won't mix it cannot mix it's either thus saith the Lord there you are or it's wrong they have thus sayeth the Lord or they keep still he works in and through his bride no matter what Holy Father father said St bonfice or Archbishop of Canterbury I don't know who said it if it's contrary to the word it's perversion it won't mix you can't mix it now you go back to what he said in Revelations 12 amen and I just read that to you it'll slice a cut they can call for okay now I'm closing I'm coming down the end you say praise the Lord can't B say praise the Lord good so I I just if I keep going I don't hear praise the Lord but if I stop it's praise the Lord so I'm glad and I say praise the Lord too because I want to get this off my chest all right now watch you you've heard what the circumstance is the messenger got through with the message now in the heart of the Bride where' that message go into the heart of the Bride how many know that's so what God thought had it hid in the back part of his mind is now in the bride it's now in the heart of the Bride he's in he's he's tabernacled himself in Bride form when once he was when once he was as Jesus in flesh it's now it's now I forget how the wording was but it's now in the flesh of the Bride amen amen all right so now in the heart of the Bride the what is in the heart of the Bride testimony spoken revelation of the word the key Revelations 21 I won't read it 20 verse1 all right now now now God always has his word and he always uses man to work it they're going to speak amen life notice I want you to notice life followed Rider on White Horse who is the word life Vindicated Vindicated how by his resurrected saints that he had with him now you can say I take that both ways yes you can you can say it's after the resurrection and I can say it's also before the resurrection because we had a prophet say what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is how many believe is the resurrection and life shall never die you've passed then you've passed you've risen fact he said you've risen over and over again all right now his resurrected Saints he had with him now how's the battle now how's the battle going to go Jesus said he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live if you believe in me and though you were dead and who whoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die he said that's how the battle's going to go see he's talking about his resurrected Saints he had with him now how's the battle going to go he that believeth in me there it is who believes in Him in him in him not believing about him but who's believing in him amen again he said he that believeth he will give him eternal life and raise him up at the last day that's his promise scripture he'll raise him up at the last day how many's been risen rise shine for thy light is come and not only that if I go in the grave he'll raise me up at the again but as I said before it must be faith in you it's got to be the work of Faith first before you can see the absolute fulfillment of it got to be faith is something you have already and I'm talking about something we have already all right that's the promised scripture what a resurrection that was I just follow up see I speak what a resurrection this is if God speaks to send you he backs up what you say listen to this I'm closing that's Tru am now see notice if you're an ambassador from Heaven how many is ambassador from Heaven let's seal this off Lord if you're an ambassador from Heaven All Heaven is behind you all Heaven consists of the word so you in the word because the word is the thought expressed you are his thought you are his attribute all right now notice he's come notice now he's come with resurrected Saints listen to this now notice he's come with I just got done reading what don't miss those two last two things I just read here he's come with resurrected Saints and true he will come with resurrected Saints back to the Earth is that right right yeah went over that Wednesday all right vindicating that his word is true he's come with Resurrection vindicating that his word is true who's he vindicating it through all right so Satan knows now watch so Satan knows then the bottomless pit is ready for him oh my while death rode the pale horse mixed Creed and denominations and followed him followed him oh my the Eternal separation from God that's where he rode them to Eternal separation Christ the life Christ the life Christ the word rode his church right into glory in the resurrection stand let's stand we started with an Abrupt start we ended with an Abrupt start and I mean an Abrupt end you see brother sister you have to forgive me for taking some time but really my calling more exists as a teacher not an evangelist God call I won't go into all that but I know where God called me to be and what he called me to do so I'm sorry if I if I hurt your reasoning about time that's not my that's not my purpose my purpose was this has got to go out I knew it had to go out that's right amen and if and if you then just please forgive me won't you if if you feel I did wrong forgive me amen and I'll forgive you for feeling that way so we're okay I know it's taken a while but since when is a while when it's come to death and life and their final struggle death and life is in its final struggle I I I I think I had that written I might have bypassed it but death and life is in its final struggle the White Horse of Life the I think I did read it there come to their final struggle we're in it brother sister it's being manifested where are you bride where are you are you going to take the world and all its popularity and all its filthiness and all it's only lead you one way that's death there's only one way this life of this revealed word will lead you and that's eternity now take your choice it's now come to you it's now in your hands amen it's now in every in every one of your hands it's in mine too what are we going to do with this Jesus called Christ what are we going to do with this one leading us directing us guiding us are you willing to follow him are you willing to take up your cross and die to your own reasoning and your sense bound senses that you're in and give that up and quit looking at the outside and take that word what your heart say what is your soul saying this morning where are you going to stand are you willing to separate even from Family House lands daughter sister mother wife are you willing to separate from all of it and say Lord I'm going to take you at your word I'm going to follow one way and that's through your word and your word is my deliverance we could have spent a lot of time with that again but the first Wednesday we ministered here we took that stay with the word amen yes don't you add to it or take from it you just get a relationship with Jesus Christ and that deser will know exactly how you should answer come back to the word go back to what is written don't go back to your sense bound reasoning and your imagination your memory your conscience and you feel good and I feel good those are no those are no evidences that you have the Holy Ghost In You dwelling I don't care how much you prophesy how much you cast out Devils how much Jesus said they'd come in that day great preachers great workers casting out Devils speaking in tongues prophesying every one of those things and not the word so where does it lay it lays in the revelation of the word you said you just stepped on my toes Brother David good because you got to realize that it's the word or nothing that's right and that word's got to be revealed in you then talk with tongues then speak with the tongues then do those things and I have nothing against that but those things are not the evidence that you are born again right amen you don't think that's right you've been too long in this message not to know that he said that over and over and over again it's just that you won't receive it that's the problem we either receive it or we don't because it steps on our ego it steps on our feelings well you don't know how God dealt with me you don't know how God dealt with me but there's no evidence of that I can preach this gospel with a house of fire and be anointed to do it it's not the evidence that I'm going to Heaven by their fruit they are known and the fruit is the promised word for this season revealed in you and you'll bear that fruit the fruit of the Season you know them they're teaching they are false teachers they're false on the inside of the inside yet anointed preachers anointed teachers anointed every way anointed Anointed with the genuine Holy Ghost and be filled with the Holy Spirit every day of your life and still go to hell then what is the difference the word you have an ear to hear that word that's exactly where it lays you say well you don't love us I love you more than you realize I love you in God's Own love I'm trying to get you to see pull away from that sense bound things of feel-good feelings and come to the word quit trying to find your your happiness quit trying to find it in man's Theology and man's ideas come back to the word this prophet and this message brought us one place back to himself amen do
