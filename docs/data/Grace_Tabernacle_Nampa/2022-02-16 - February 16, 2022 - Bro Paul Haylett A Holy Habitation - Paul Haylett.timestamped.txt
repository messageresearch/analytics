[0:00] adore
[0:03] god bless you the healing and grace
[0:07] are our hearts always hunger for
[0:12] oh
[0:14] our hearts always hung before
[0:20] beautiful
[0:22] you know as we're singing this song it
[0:24] um
[0:25] brings me in remembrance of something i
[0:27] just read a few days ago
[0:29] i thought it was so beautiful
[0:31] prophet of god talking about our lord
[0:33] jesus
[0:34] took our sin so completely
[0:38] that it became his sin
[0:41] so that we should take righteousness
[0:46] so completely that it would be
[0:48] identified as our righteousness
[0:51] oh i tell you i i just stirred my heart
[0:53] it's not we're trying to be righteous
[0:56] somehow but he let us become his
[1:00] righteousness and i say thank you
[1:02] tonight amen that song just inspired me
[1:06] reminded me of that how beautiful that
[1:08] is of what god has done for us and
[1:11] can we say it is good to be in the house
[1:13] of the lord tonight
[1:15] amen god bless each one of you
[1:18] well you know
[1:19] brother james as soon as he realized we
[1:21] had a
[1:23] technical problem here
[1:25] uh said we're gonna have a good service
[1:27] amen so i'm gonna fully just expect that
[1:30] and confess we're having a good service
[1:32] tonight
[1:33] amen you know we're over at brother
[1:35] riches and i realized how completely
[1:37] spoiled i have become with the brothers
[1:40] just making everything work so well and
[1:43] stuff so amen god bless you sister
[1:45] tonight sister to bethlehem
[1:47] let's just stand go into our bibles i
[1:50] want to be
[1:51] we are witnesses again just a
[1:53] continuation of that thought
[1:55] i am so glad my brother and sister that
[1:57] god saw
[1:59] us to be worthy
[2:00] to be his witness amen of all
[2:04] of humanity that he could have chosen
[2:07] and i don't know it's been preached on a
[2:09] lot but i just got excited the other
[2:11] night as i'm just reading what the
[2:13] prophet of god was saying about job
[2:15] and i i hope you can catch this but you
[2:19] know
[2:20] when he spoke to job and he says where
[2:23] were you
[2:26] tough question huh brother trevor
[2:28] man stop
[2:30] but look at the difference of the age
[2:31] that we live in job had to stop and
[2:34] think about where was i
[2:37] but the words been revealed in our hour
[2:40] that if the lord jesus christ come
[2:42] tonight and said where were you
[2:45] when the sons of god sang for joy and
[2:48] the heavens rang and we'd be able to say
[2:50] i know where i was at hallelujah because
[2:53] the word's been opened to us and and i
[2:56] just got so excited reading that
[2:58] thinking thank you lord we don't have a
[3:00] big question mark out there hallelujah
[3:03] amen
[3:04] hallelujah let's just turn i want to
[3:06] speak to you tonight on a holy
[3:08] habitation
[3:09] amen
[3:10] and
[3:12] to take that out of ephesians the second
[3:15] chapter verses
[3:16] 17 to 22
[3:19] and uh just uh desire tonight by god's
[3:22] grace to
[3:23] to just bring this little thought to you
[3:26] amen ephesians the second chapter verses
[3:29] 17
[3:30] through 22.
[3:33] amen
[3:38] i kind of pulled this back a little bit
[3:40] to just try and keep this i
[3:42] one thing about it saints you know
[3:46] we can always go and read the big
[3:48] picture right
[3:49] just go back to
[3:51] you know ephesians 1 and just start
[3:53] reading and go to three or four and we
[3:55] get the whole picture of what was being
[3:57] spoken
[3:58] i feel the same way many time about the
[4:00] quotes people are like well you know you
[4:02] cut this off cut that off there's
[4:04] nothing hindering
[4:06] anyone from going
[4:07] and searching it out people say well you
[4:09] took that to make the point you wanted
[4:11] to make
[4:12] well good you go home and read all of it
[4:15] and you'll get the whole point
[4:17] amen not just the
[4:20] few minutes that we have
[4:22] ephesians 2
[4:23] and came and preached peace to you
[4:27] which were afar off
[4:29] and to them that were nigh
[4:31] for through him we both have access by
[4:34] one spirit unto the father
[4:37] now therefore ye are no more strangers
[4:40] and foreigners i can say amen to that
[4:43] but fellow citizens with the saints and
[4:47] of the household of god and are built
[4:50] upon the foundation of the apostles and
[4:52] prophets jesus christ himself being the
[4:56] chief cornerstone
[4:57] in whom all the building fitly framed
[5:00] together growth into a holy temple in
[5:03] the lord in whom ye also are builded
[5:06] together for a habitation
[5:09] of god through the spirit heavenly
[5:11] father we ask you to come tonight and
[5:14] lord i just lift a thought to you lord
[5:17] just
[5:17] reveal to the brothers father where to
[5:20] look and how to fix and father you know
[5:22] all things and i know you care about
[5:24] these things and ask you lord tonight
[5:27] for the saints and those who are not
[5:29] here tonight for whatever
[5:31] reason lord whatever circumstance just
[5:34] asking for your hand of mercy upon each
[5:37] one we ask father lord for revelation
[5:40] not as it were that we would look in the
[5:41] bible and say oh i understand this
[5:44] better or greater but father we want you
[5:47] to come down in our heart
[5:49] in our soul lord
[5:51] you yourself as the prophet of god says
[5:54] in the person of jesus christ we invite
[5:57] you tonight lord and we thank you for
[5:59] what you have done for us we're looking
[6:01] for what you will do tonight and in the
[6:03] future
[6:04] father lord to take a bride home
[6:07] lord that's what we're searching for we
[6:09] ask for your word to be open to us now
[6:11] in the name of jesus christ amen you may
[6:14] be seated
[6:17] now i just want to as a little prayer in
[6:20] the back there just
[6:21] pray a little prayer with me if you
[6:22] would or for me that i can just be real
[6:24] concise tonight
[6:26] there certainly is a a
[6:28] great abundance of avenues as it were uh
[6:31] in this word amen but i i one thing that
[6:35] really touched me as i've been reading
[6:37] these scriptures for a little bit uh you
[6:39] know that he come and preached peace to
[6:41] you which were far off
[6:43] and uh you know the thing i love about
[6:46] this is uh our lord jesus christ not
[6:48] being a respecter of person but also
[6:51] because he knew where we were it wasn't
[6:54] as though we had to travel through life
[6:56] until we stepped on the x
[7:00] he knew right where to find us he sent
[7:03] the word to us
[7:04] he brought us into his presence and so
[7:07] to those who were near and to those that
[7:09] were afar off he he knew who he was
[7:13] speaking to and he knew where they were
[7:16] amen uh in in the beginning as it were
[7:19] and so you know i i just love that it
[7:22] see it's not uh dependent upon our uh
[7:25] position and one thing that really
[7:27] strikes me by brother and sister and
[7:28] i've seen through the years by personal
[7:30] experience
[7:32] that it is very hard not to be a
[7:34] respecter of persons
[7:36] let's think about this
[7:38] you know um
[7:40] i i believe it's a true story back east
[7:43] a pastor new pastor of a large church
[7:46] and never been there before it's
[7:47] supposed to be a sunday the church was
[7:49] packed out everyone's an expectation but
[7:51] the pastor actually showed up dressed as
[7:54] a bomb and stood by the front doors of
[7:56] the church and tried to break into
[7:58] conversation with people and people just
[8:01] basically brushed him off and so as time
[8:04] comes for the service to start
[8:06] you know the bum disappears and you know
[8:09] then they're there and they're awaiting
[8:10] expectation for their pastor and and
[8:13] they're a little dismayed because their
[8:15] new pastor has maybe he didn't make it
[8:17] here until down the center aisle comes
[8:21] the bomb and one of the deacons even
[8:22] said sir you can't go up there
[8:29] so it's really hard for us not to be a
[8:30] respecter of person if he had walked in
[8:32] in a fine suit
[8:34] they would have realized this is our new
[8:35] pastor but he come and he used that as
[8:38] an opening you might say a a statement
[8:41] to the church
[8:43] and then he told them he says i believe
[8:45] we as christians have a lot to work on
[8:48] and uh you know it's it's very hard but
[8:50] look at the word here the apostle paul's
[8:52] coming and he says i'm a fellow servant
[8:55] he put himself right here with us
[8:59] he put it right in a place and said you
[9:01] know what i'm not above you even though
[9:03] he used words and was speaking i paul a
[9:06] prisoner of christ i paul an apostle i
[9:09] paul
[9:11] but he come down and put himself right
[9:12] back to it and you know that's one thing
[9:14] i love about the ministry i remember as
[9:16] a child saints it's it's it's very
[9:19] interesting the profound things that you
[9:21] remember as a little boy hearing the
[9:23] message for the first time and you know
[9:26] you have to forgive my family my mom and
[9:28] dad did their best but i i remember at
[9:31] the time we were introduced to the
[9:33] message uh you might have been dismayed
[9:35] to see you know this shaggy boy with
[9:38] hair down in his face and on his collar
[9:40] and i remember my dad i say this with
[9:42] humor he said we're going to this house
[9:45] we are going to sit and we're going to
[9:47] listen to a tape
[9:49] and you children if you even so much as
[9:52] move when we get home i'm beating you
[9:55] not a very good introduction to the
[9:56] message right
[9:58] but i tell you what i remember from that
[10:00] very first night
[10:02] good evening friend
[10:07] did not come
[10:08] in a great
[10:10] prestigious deal did not come as an
[10:13] article
[10:14] but come
[10:16] as a friend a fellow servant
[10:18] to bring the word to draw us in and it's
[10:21] interesting in the day that we live in
[10:23] and i don't want to get sidetracked to
[10:24] that but there's a lot of distractors
[10:26] detractors uh those that are trying to
[10:29] stir up the pot about it's this and it's
[10:31] that but my brother and sister as we
[10:33] read the quote the other day it's when
[10:35] it becomes personal they can say this is
[10:38] this but you can say sorry i was there
[10:41] when it happened
[10:42] and that is what we're looking for that
[10:44] kind of relationship today not one based
[10:47] on you or you or you or you or you or
[10:50] you on me but we have that relationship
[10:53] that's based upon that personal
[10:54] experience of jesus christ and to me you
[10:57] know i guess i i hate to admit this but
[11:00] i find myself being very analytical
[11:02] which is a fancy word for critical
[11:06] just spelled different
[11:09] and i want to know why
[11:12] i drive my wife crazy she says why do
[11:14] you always answer questions with a
[11:16] question
[11:18] i want to know why she's asking the
[11:19] question before i answer the question
[11:22] make sure there's not a hidden motive
[11:28] but look at this my brother and sister
[11:30] when we're looking in the word we're
[11:32] seeing uh the clear picture of the
[11:35] apostle paul is not coming to build a
[11:38] kingdom not coming to have a great big
[11:40] parsonage not coming in fact through
[11:43] history we see that when there was no
[11:45] support from the church as it were or
[11:47] the saints he would sit down and make
[11:49] tents
[11:51] he didn't say i i'm not gonna do this or
[11:53] do that unless you guys support me in
[11:55] the style i want to become accustomed to
[11:58] but a true servant of god whose heart
[12:00] was there and god had molded that
[12:03] character of that man to be able to come
[12:05] and bring a pure unadulterated word not
[12:08] affected by the politics of the day not
[12:11] affected by popularity and movements but
[12:13] to be affected by the moving of the holy
[12:15] spirit and i say god help us
[12:18] amen now look at this i love this verse
[12:21] 20. he said and are built upon now let
[12:24] me back up a little bit see you're no
[12:26] more a stranger aren't you glad
[12:29] you can walk into the house of god among
[12:31] strangers as it were because you don't
[12:34] know them
[12:35] but in the preaching of the word you're
[12:37] not a stranger
[12:38] and as it is i i can say this when they
[12:41] see you praising god when you walk out
[12:43] the doors they know you're not a
[12:44] stranger in that house they they
[12:45] identify who with you and who you are
[12:48] and you see i love that because it is
[12:51] not just a group of people thrown
[12:52] together we're not strangers and
[12:54] foreigners but we have become fellow
[12:56] citizens and and the gospel is so
[12:59] beautiful because my brother and sister
[13:02] sister sorry i got kind of a little
[13:06] hesp tonight sorry but
[13:09] we all understand the value of
[13:11] citizenship
[13:13] the value of you know so to speak having
[13:15] a right and not in the sense that the
[13:18] world takes rights but you know to know
[13:20] that when i say rights i mean we have
[13:23] right
[13:24] to boldly approach the throne of god
[13:28] because we know who we are we know that
[13:30] we've already been accepted in the
[13:32] beloved we're not hoping but we have a
[13:35] confidence because we have already come
[13:38] and as i spoke to you the other day we
[13:40] have seen our adoption papers they've
[13:43] been revealed and everything according
[13:46] to it has been signed sealed and stamped
[13:49] in the blood of jesus christ
[13:51] oh how beautiful that is
[13:55] and to be of the household of god
[13:58] you know there's nothing like i was
[13:59] thinking about this the other night we
[14:01] were invited
[14:05] i'm going to work on not naming names
[14:08] we're invited for dinner
[14:10] and it was just a lovely time a
[14:12] comfortable time
[14:15] i just slouched down in the chair at the
[14:17] table
[14:19] ate all i could eat went back for
[14:20] dessert three times
[14:23] see there's something about
[14:25] knowing you're part of the household
[14:28] knowing you're not a stranger there
[14:29] knowing that you don't have to do
[14:31] everything prim and proper which we
[14:33] wouldn't have a clue how to
[14:35] sister jerry tells me if you ever paul
[14:37] go somewhere
[14:39] there's all kinds of silverware on the
[14:41] table
[14:42] i know you won't know what to do so just
[14:43] start on the outside
[14:47] pretty good advice but that didn't cover
[14:49] it all what do you do with the one that
[14:51] goes crossways at the top of the plate
[14:53] and what do you do with the small glass
[14:55] and the large glass and what do you do
[14:57] with all this but you see when you are
[14:59] in the house of your own family
[15:09] praise the lord
[15:11] amen
[15:15] no sir
[15:16] i'm in the house with my family
[15:19] hallelujah that's good preach it brother
[15:21] chris
[15:25] i'm hungry
[15:26] i come to the house of god tonight
[15:28] hungry
[15:30] keep preaching
[15:32] i know might not have enough place
[15:34] settings to cover this whole meal i can
[15:36] reuse this fork
[15:41] a boy you go into a different house and
[15:44] brother branham said
[15:46] well i won't go into what brother
[15:47] branham said
[15:49] something about a dying something
[15:52] uh
[15:56] why because they're afraid to express
[15:57] from their heart
[15:59] but when we've come into the household
[16:01] of our god
[16:02] who has showed us clearly who we are we
[16:05] can just be ourself
[16:07] hallelujah we don't have to
[16:10] go on some kind of presentation
[16:13] jerry and i was joking the other day you
[16:15] know if this stuff gets too far along
[16:17] we'll come down to the time kind of like
[16:19] the pentecostals and we'll just have to
[16:21] have sister emmy or sister ruth just sit
[16:23] at the piano sister sarah whoever it
[16:25] might be just sit at the piano through
[16:27] the service and if we say something
[16:28] that's worthy they'll be like
[16:31] [Music]
[16:35] why because the people don't say amen so
[16:37] the piano has to say it for him
[16:43] so pretty soon you can see whether or
[16:45] not the piano player is revelated but we
[16:46] have no clue what the rest of the family
[16:48] is doing
[16:51] but look at this my brother and sister
[16:53] as it is now i want to hurry along here
[16:55] and see we are built upon the foundation
[16:57] i've been preaching a lot of foundations
[16:59] and ironically brother chris was had on
[17:02] his heart to go that way with the young
[17:04] people and different things
[17:06] interconnecting but look at this he says
[17:08] you're built upon the foundation of the
[17:10] apostles and so tonight because my name
[17:13] happens to match the apostle paul i'm
[17:15] going to just look and focus on building
[17:18] what he said and you know how important
[17:21] that really is saint you say well why'd
[17:23] you choose him over the others well my
[17:25] brother and sister when the prophet went
[17:27] beyond the curtain of time and he's
[17:29] there and that they're speaking and he
[17:31] says i preached what paul preached he
[17:35] didn't i'm sorry we're not taking
[17:37] some preference here we're not trying to
[17:40] be respected as a person but he didn't
[17:42] refer to timothy or luke or john or
[17:44] anyone else he come back i preached what
[17:47] paul preached and the response of the
[17:49] believers was
[17:53] we're resting
[17:55] on that
[17:57] because there was a foundation and any
[18:00] true believer amen knows he can go back
[18:03] to what paul preached
[18:05] and latch on to that and start building
[18:08] his habitation amen so it's there that
[18:11] it comes this foundation of the apostles
[18:14] and prophets jesus christ himself being
[18:16] the chief cornerstone now you know i
[18:19] can't really i i i don't like to to do
[18:23] this but i'm sorry i'm going to name
[18:24] names amen tonight as it were amen but
[18:28] you see all of this at verse 20 none of
[18:30] it matters if jesus christ is not the
[18:33] cornerstone
[18:35] if we have another cornerstone if our
[18:37] cornerstone is our church or a certain
[18:39] ministry we're in trouble my brother and
[18:42] sister but when the cornerstone is jesus
[18:44] christ he as a master builder now the
[18:47] apostle paul said i a master builder but
[18:50] what paul was really saying is he that's
[18:52] in me
[18:53] is the master builder and so i have come
[18:56] to lay the foundation for you to build
[18:58] upon and now he's clarifying jesus
[19:01] christ is the cornerstone
[19:04] so you got to start building the house
[19:06] somewhere right
[19:07] so you start at the cornerstone and you
[19:10] build the house as it were around the
[19:12] cornerstone and i'm telling you my
[19:14] brother and sister it don't matter how
[19:15] rough life is
[19:18] if jesus christ is our cornerstone we're
[19:20] going to make it
[19:22] we we pray for brother marty we pray for
[19:25] sister laura and many others i know
[19:27] there's many requests that just kind of
[19:29] slip from our memories and lord forgive
[19:30] us for that but my brother and sister no
[19:32] matter how rough life is if jesus christ
[19:36] is our cornerstone
[19:38] we're going to make it
[19:41] amen brother jason as you said whether
[19:43] her sister laura
[19:44] whether she's healed here or steps
[19:47] beyond the curtain of time into that
[19:49] perfect body
[19:50] we know where the stand is she has
[19:53] confessed it she's lived it and still as
[19:56] cancer eats her body is confessing not i
[20:00] hope to be healed but her confession is
[20:02] i am healed
[20:04] amen why because she's got a cornerstone
[20:07] she went back and said everything of my
[20:09] house has lined up with this cornerstone
[20:12] as it is you know it's so many feet here
[20:15] so many feet here so many feet here so
[20:18] many feet here a window here a doorway
[20:21] here and everything fits trust me i've
[20:24] been there before in the natural framing
[20:26] houses and you go to do a layout and
[20:29] you're like uh guys there's something
[20:31] wrong
[20:33] this foundation
[20:35] will not support this blueprint
[20:40] what are you gonna do
[20:43] oh you know what we just decided folks
[20:45] that are paying a few hundred thousand
[20:46] for this house that it looks really cool
[20:49] for the floor joists to hang off the
[20:50] foundation
[20:52] it makes a good spot for your cat to get
[20:54] in where it's warm
[20:59] know what you do is they stop and say we
[21:01] got a problem
[21:03] we got a serious problem
[21:05] a problem that warranted a trackhoe
[21:06] ripping out a whole foundation
[21:10] now do you know that god loves you so
[21:12] much
[21:15] you'll bring a spiritual track hope
[21:18] into your life
[21:21] and rip out your foundation
[21:24] because he is going to bring you
[21:26] to that place that you are a holy
[21:29] habitation
[21:31] and we say oh lord
[21:33] no
[21:35] and he says yes
[21:37] for you to be who you're called to be
[21:42] i got to tear this out and rebuild it
[21:46] because otherwise
[21:49] you're patched together christian
[21:57] i don't need a patch
[22:00] we have the song
[22:03] the patched up life
[22:05] oh no wait that's not how it goes the
[22:07] original life
[22:09] the original word was patched up just
[22:14] for you and i
[22:17] i don't mean to sound facetious tonight
[22:19] but i want to make the point
[22:21] god don't deal with that he deals the
[22:23] original word as the perfect word come
[22:25] from the mind of god was expressed was
[22:27] manifested and come to life in you and i
[22:31] amen not something patched together not
[22:34] not something that you know i don't want
[22:35] to go back to the bedrock to straighten
[22:38] this out but i'm telling you my brother
[22:39] and sister it's all about the
[22:41] cornerstone
[22:42] amen so you know the scripture tells us
[22:45] that jesus christ as the cornerstone
[22:48] become a rock of offense but my brother
[22:50] and sister there's no way a god called
[22:53] son or daughter amen you know what i'm
[22:56] saying there's no way a god called son
[22:58] or daughter can be offended at the word
[23:03] there's no way that we can come to a
[23:05] place that we say i just can't accept
[23:06] this in fact as we were speaking the
[23:08] other day there's something that's built
[23:10] into the believer that such a hunger
[23:13] that causes them even though they feel
[23:15] like that they have been peeled with a
[23:18] potato peeler they go i gotta go back
[23:21] that's all there is to it i got to go
[23:23] back that's who i am this is not who i
[23:26] am this is what the devil tried to make
[23:28] me into
[23:30] but i see who i am and lord i come back
[23:34] now look at this
[23:36] you know i say this with a bit of humor
[23:39] sometimes i'd like to stand up and say
[23:41] um brothers just stop preaching you're
[23:43] stomping on my thoughts
[23:46] but you see here now
[23:48] this building
[23:50] is so
[23:52] fitly framed together
[23:55] that it groweth into a holy temple
[23:58] in the lord
[23:59] so this is as brother chris preached
[24:02] about the altar
[24:03] this is not something that man has been
[24:06] allowed by god to hew here and hew there
[24:09] because then it would be as it were a
[24:11] pastor would hew the church into his
[24:14] vision of what a good christian or the
[24:16] perfect christian is but you see when
[24:19] the pastor would be there looking at the
[24:22] cornerstone and that cornerstone is
[24:25] anchored in his own life he'll sit in an
[24:27] office he'll sit in his home in the car
[24:29] whatever and say lord let me just speak
[24:32] what they need to hear
[24:35] not what i want them to hear but what
[24:37] they need to hear that they might walk
[24:40] out satisfied in their spirit
[24:43] and so it's there that as brother chris
[24:45] preached just to bring this into context
[24:48] amen god did not allow a tool to be put
[24:51] to the rock thank you for that sermon
[24:53] brother chris that was good
[24:55] no tool to be put to the rock i want
[24:58] jesus christ in this church in my life
[25:01] in your life unadulterated untrained
[25:04] unchipped unaffected i want it to be the
[25:07] original word coming forth that we can
[25:10] literally anchor our souls to it and
[25:13] build hallelujah because you see if it's
[25:16] man's work it'll bring man's result
[25:19] amen so as brother chris preached the
[25:22] other day no tool could be put to the
[25:24] rock to the stone it had to be the
[25:26] original and i'm telling you my brother
[25:28] and sister if i could just take this
[25:30] it's the original word you might be just
[25:33] living life and it's good and you'll be
[25:35] doing your devotions and you'll read a
[25:37] scripture and there'll be a little
[25:38] something i know you'll be able to say
[25:40] him into this a little something pangs
[25:42] in your heart and you're like oh lord
[25:45] what is that
[25:47] and then he starts to deal with you over
[25:49] something and it might be something you
[25:51] totally forgot about something went over
[25:52] your head or it might be as it were i'm
[25:54] going to use the term revelation that
[25:56] god's opening your eyes to something
[26:00] and we say thank you lord
[26:02] and we like that i love revelation
[26:05] but did you know revelation is
[26:06] interesting because
[26:08] god uses revelation to expose our
[26:10] unbelief our fears our doubts
[26:14] we don't normally look at revelation
[26:15] like that do we we look at revelation as
[26:17] like
[26:18] oh
[26:20] look at
[26:22] that but how about when revelation
[26:26] is you have a smudge on the hem of your
[26:28] garment
[26:29] that's revelation my brother and sister
[26:31] we might think oh no problem no problem
[26:34] i live in a as it were dirty world
[26:38] and he says nope
[26:40] smudge must go
[26:42] and we start to look at that and at
[26:43] first we think i'm okay i'm okay
[26:46] i'm okay
[26:48] then we start to realize
[26:51] by revelation
[26:53] not okay
[26:56] oh my
[26:59] you know we talk about
[27:00] praying for patience and we sometimes
[27:02] kind of joke about that
[27:05] i wonder
[27:06] how far can we go to pray for correction
[27:11] maybe we could add that to the list of
[27:13] the things that we pray for
[27:16] lord
[27:17] correct me
[27:19] prophet of god i read you the quotes he
[27:21] says you know we need to repent every
[27:23] day
[27:24] so we come to the point we might as well
[27:26] just go ahead and on our prayer list
[27:28] just pin in there pray for correction
[27:31] because you see we don't want to be the
[27:33] rebel we don't want to be the one that
[27:35] decides a house would be better with a
[27:37] different cornerstone
[27:41] now let's look at this as i move on real
[27:42] quickly here fitly
[27:47] of a type suitable
[27:49] to meet a required purpose
[27:55] in whom all the building fitly framed
[27:57] together
[27:58] growth into a holy temple in the lord
[28:02] i want you to think about this saints
[28:03] just
[28:04] before we move on
[28:06] god said you were suitable
[28:08] you're suitable to fulfill
[28:11] this calling
[28:13] he said i need a bride in laodicea one
[28:15] that will not fall like eve did in the
[28:17] garden but she's going to stand upon the
[28:19] unadulterated word and she won't be
[28:22] moved from that and so what i've got to
[28:23] do is go now and search the earth as it
[28:25] were just let me do this figurative we
[28:27] know it didn't work that way but let me
[28:29] search the earth and i'll find those who
[28:31] are suitable to be my bride
[28:35] now to the married people here today you
[28:37] know
[28:38] we didn't just go out here and go down
[28:40] to the mall and
[28:42] say well brown hair blue eyes
[28:45] five foot whatever first one that meets
[28:48] that criteria i'm gonna ask her to marry
[28:50] me
[28:55] i shouldn't say it this way but forgive
[28:57] me
[28:58] first one you meet that might be that
[29:00] criteria might look like a fence post
[29:04] and i can assure you that it's going to
[29:05] take the lord leading you to marry
[29:07] somebody that looks like a fence post
[29:08] because we as humans just like peacocks
[29:11] like all the beautiful colors
[29:15] but you see that ain't how we search for
[29:16] a wife or a husband
[29:18] right
[29:20] so
[29:21] god when he come down
[29:23] he said
[29:24] you're suitable come on saints i want
[29:26] you to just grasp this tonight are you
[29:28] grasping it am i just being too
[29:30] redundant forgive me tonight i might be
[29:32] on my redundant mode but i want you to
[29:34] grasp this that god said you're suitable
[29:37] to be my bride and that's why i started
[29:40] to reveal myself to you
[29:42] he didn't reveal himself just because he
[29:44] does that he's revealing himself to his
[29:47] bride that his bride can realize that
[29:50] she was chosen before the foundation of
[29:53] the world that she has been positionally
[29:55] placed and now she's receiving that and
[29:58] can move together now look at this in
[30:00] whom ye also are build it together it's
[30:03] verse 22
[30:04] uh together for a habitation of god
[30:07] through the spirit now i just want to
[30:09] make emphasis before i move on here the
[30:12] word together
[30:13] means simultaneous
[30:16] it include
[30:17] includes companionship or close
[30:19] association
[30:23] hallelujah
[30:25] family
[30:26] how much closer can we get
[30:30] you see when we move into this realm to
[30:32] realize that god is not just revelating
[30:34] the prophet of god made a statement in
[30:36] this fashion he says it's not about
[30:38] these revelated or i'm i'm kind of
[30:40] paraphrasing it these guys that are in
[30:42] the spirit in the pulpit he said it's
[30:45] about the whole church it's about the
[30:47] body receiving the word
[30:50] amen and coming what is it not not now
[30:53] there will be those of us uh those of
[30:55] you let me put it that way that will
[30:57] spiritually catch and move forward in
[30:59] things a little before others but you
[31:02] see it's a simultaneous move of god
[31:05] and the holy ghost when i say
[31:06] simultaneous to drive that home is god
[31:08] will be preaching on these very same
[31:10] things all the way in africa and south
[31:13] america north and south and east and
[31:15] west because he's working simultaneously
[31:19] in a bride of christ he bringing her
[31:21] together into this house
[31:25] all at the same time
[31:28] don't ever feel like you've been left
[31:29] out my brother and sister
[31:31] god might be stirring you to be more
[31:33] sincere god might be stirring you to to
[31:36] uh more well let me just read this jude
[31:39] 1 1-6
[31:41] jude the servant of jesus christ and
[31:43] brother of james to them that are
[31:45] sanctified by god the father and
[31:47] preserved
[31:50] in jesus christ
[31:52] oh and cold
[31:56] mercy unto you and peace and love be
[31:57] multiplied
[31:58] beloved when i gave all diligence to
[32:00] write unto you of the common salvation
[32:04] it was needful for me to write unto you
[32:06] and exhort you that you should earnestly
[32:09] contend for the faith
[32:12] see not a hap hazard
[32:15] when it works
[32:16] when it fits my schedule when it fits my
[32:19] lifestyle
[32:20] when it fits my world
[32:22] but he says that you should earnestly
[32:24] contend for the faith which is once
[32:26] delivered unto the saints now this once
[32:29] delivered
[32:30] some people some theologians want to say
[32:32] you know as a past tense
[32:34] but really what the word is saying here
[32:37] that this was delivered this was one
[32:41] time
[32:43] once delivered
[32:45] some take it in the other side of the
[32:47] definition as a context of a past tense
[32:50] but truly what this is is god delivered
[32:52] one word
[32:53] he doesn't have two messages doesn't
[32:55] have three messages he doesn't have you
[32:57] know how is it brother chris you you
[32:59] computer people it's like version 2.1
[33:03] 2.3 2.7
[33:06] 3.2
[33:08] god don't have versions he give it once
[33:11] he delivered it to the saints once it's
[33:13] there there's a period of time that the
[33:15] word came just as it is in our day there
[33:17] was a period of time but i'm asking you
[33:20] tonight you don't have to lift a hand
[33:22] but is the holy spirit still opening the
[33:24] word to the bride
[33:26] a prophet of god has been gone since uh
[33:29] 1965 amen but the holy spirit is still
[33:34] opening the word and where's he taking
[33:36] us back to that original
[33:39] once that it was delivered
[33:41] not a second version not a third version
[33:43] not a laodicean version
[33:45] amen just like you talk to somebody
[33:47] about clothes and hair and baptism and
[33:50] this and they'll look you in the face
[33:51] and tell you that was for way back then
[33:53] this is different now
[33:55] it doesn't fit the bible
[33:58] he says for there's certain men crept in
[34:00] unawares who were before of old ordained
[34:03] to this condemnation
[34:07] now you know some people don't believe
[34:09] predestination
[34:12] but um
[34:13] my brother and sister it's just pretty
[34:15] scary when you think about it
[34:17] but let's not think about the scary side
[34:19] tonight i want you to lift a hand to
[34:21] heart and rejoice predestination
[34:24] and and we'll maybe this next sunday
[34:26] lord willing we'll go into that but my
[34:28] brother and sister some people's idea
[34:31] and i already kind of gave a prelude to
[34:33] this some people's idea when you talk
[34:35] about predestination is though god put
[34:37] somebody in a headlock and said i'm
[34:38] going to make you go to an altar
[34:41] but what he did is put us in a heart
[34:43] lock
[34:46] and our heart is what took us to the
[34:48] altar our heart took us into consecrated
[34:50] life our heart took us deeper
[34:52] in jesus christ there was no big strong
[34:55] men
[34:56] in fact it turns big strong men into
[34:58] humble men
[35:00] but it's there that god makes them
[35:02] because the heart then leads the man
[35:04] right even modern science will will tell
[35:07] you that there's an influence that they
[35:10] still haven't been able to quantify
[35:13] some just want to call it emotion well
[35:15] if god used emotion to break me down to
[35:17] come to an altar to repent then praise
[35:19] the lord for emotion
[35:22] if it was something deeper in our heart
[35:24] well praise the lord for that too
[35:26] so you look at this so we see that the
[35:29] the men are creeping in unaware so
[35:31] they've been they made it into the
[35:33] church
[35:34] and nobody really recognized them and uh
[35:37] they have been uh ordained uh to this
[35:41] and he says they're really actually
[35:43] ungodly men regard regardless of what
[35:45] the outside looks like they're ungodly
[35:47] men and uh they're used you've got to be
[35:50] careful about this but let's just stop
[35:52] for a moment and take this back remember
[35:55] all i'm doing tonight is stirring up
[35:56] your pure minds
[36:00] we deceive the very elect
[36:04] now if we just cut that off right there
[36:07] i'm terrified
[36:10] but praise the lord
[36:12] the bride recognizes
[36:14] it's not just as it were somebody
[36:17] speaking to them but it's her husband
[36:22] and he said but don't worry about it
[36:25] deceive the very elect if it were
[36:29] possible
[36:36] kind of makes my heart sad when people
[36:38] are just so
[36:39] so terrified of being deceived
[36:42] come on let's just get into the word get
[36:44] consecrated get sincere and know where
[36:46] we stand and know that we are in the
[36:49] word we have been adopted into the
[36:51] beloved and we are steadfastly anchored
[36:54] in jesus christ we don't have to worry
[36:57] about being deceived oh does that mean
[36:59] we don't need to pray don't need to read
[37:01] our bible no my brother and sister we
[37:03] need to do all of that but god said you
[37:05] when you come to the crossroad and don't
[37:07] know whether to go right or left he'll
[37:09] the holy spirit will lead you on where
[37:11] to go
[37:12] amen and it certainly helps as one
[37:14] brother preached one time he said it
[37:16] certainly helps if you've read the road
[37:19] map before you need to turn right or
[37:21] left
[37:32] then verse five is
[37:34] not a downer but you know what it just
[37:36] says i'll put you in remembrance
[37:39] though you once knew this that how the
[37:41] lord having saved the people out of the
[37:42] land of egypt in other words called them
[37:44] out of the world
[37:46] brought them into the word
[37:48] amen brought them into goshen
[37:52] and afterwards destroyed them because
[37:53] they didn't even believe
[37:55] think of all those people saints
[37:58] that left
[37:59] egypt
[38:01] they got to see the supernatural
[38:05] come on let's face it we're at the red
[38:07] sea
[38:09] there comes pharaoh's army
[38:11] in our flesh
[38:13] we're scared silly
[38:15] and we face circumstances in this life
[38:17] that we look at that and we look at the
[38:19] world and we are scared silly come on
[38:22] let's admit it we're like lord what do i
[38:24] do what do i do we have this situation
[38:26] we have that situation but my brother
[38:28] and sister these people before they
[38:30] actually made their final decision had
[38:33] seen just as much supernatural
[38:36] as they had seen
[38:37] of those things to be terrified of
[38:41] so they made the decision not god
[38:44] they made the decision whether to
[38:46] believe or not
[38:48] people say well why would god do that
[38:50] well god didn't do that
[38:52] the scripture says
[38:54] that he destroyed them
[38:56] that believed not
[38:59] you say but predestination falls in
[39:01] there but you know what there's that
[39:02] little narrow avenue
[39:05] where if a man now this might be
[39:07] controversial so take it with a grain of
[39:09] salt
[39:10] there's that little narrow sliver the
[39:12] prophet of god talks about if a man
[39:14] who's not even predestined but he'd
[39:16] believe that these words of god were for
[39:19] him
[39:20] that god would make a way for him
[39:24] if he'd stand on that word and believe
[39:26] it god would make a way for him
[39:28] now my brother and sister
[39:30] pardon me tonight i'll express a little
[39:32] opinion
[39:34] i don't plan on being a doormat in
[39:36] heaven
[39:37] but i'd rather be a doormat in heaven
[39:40] than any other alternative
[39:43] yeah
[39:44] yep
[39:46] now we distort sometimes the whole glass
[39:48] of water thing and i don't know which
[39:50] way to go on that you know i think
[39:52] personally sometimes people take it a
[39:54] little far
[39:55] but my brother and sister god knows
[39:58] might be at a certain moment in your
[39:59] life someone does that does that thing
[40:02] and god says i'm going to honor them
[40:05] for the sake of my beloved my wife
[40:09] now think about it in a natural term
[40:12] what if your wife brothers was on the
[40:14] side of the highway
[40:16] with a flat tire
[40:19] and you're not available
[40:22] and some gentleman stops
[40:25] and says ma'am
[40:26] no please don't get your clothes dirty
[40:29] i'll change your tire for you
[40:32] we'd be appreciative wouldn't we
[40:34] we'd be saying bless this man
[40:37] and you see god looks at this because
[40:39] saints
[40:40] we're not people
[40:44] oh that's going to sound weird are you
[40:46] all ready to be weird
[40:49] we're not
[40:50] people we're god's habitation
[40:55] that means we're not
[40:57] name your name
[41:00] we are mrs jesus christ
[41:03] we are a part of him we are identified
[41:07] in him we are not just put your name in
[41:09] the blank just people believing but god
[41:12] views us not as just some singular
[41:15] person walking on the earth flesh that
[41:17] was born of man but we are here my
[41:20] brother and sister as the very
[41:21] habitation of almighty god
[41:26] and sometimes we forget that like real
[41:28] regular
[41:30] come on
[41:32] real regular we forget that
[41:34] and we're just bonnie sue
[41:37] and life is hard
[41:39] but how about we put that before us that
[41:41] we truly are
[41:44] the habitation in other words we are as
[41:47] they say years ago we used to put it
[41:49] this way part and participle
[41:53] because we didn't get the particle right
[41:56] but
[41:58] a past particle no
[42:00] a present particle
[42:08] yeah
[42:09] talking to a man today i said yeah i'm a
[42:11] high school dropout and basically he's
[42:13] like i can tell
[42:18] but you see i want to make a point right
[42:20] here i will put you in remembrance
[42:22] though you once knew this how the lord
[42:23] having saved the people out of the land
[42:26] of egypt after word destroyed them that
[42:29] believe not
[42:30] now look at verse six
[42:32] and the angels which kept not their
[42:35] first estate
[42:37] but left their own habitation
[42:41] they had an identified habitation
[42:45] in the
[42:46] almighty almighty creation of god i
[42:50] don't even know how to put it towards
[42:52] they had an appointed habitation that
[42:55] they could dwell in and they would be
[42:58] pleasing to god and be part of this
[43:00] great eternal plan of redemption that
[43:02] god has and they chose
[43:05] to leave that estate
[43:07] and they left their clearly identified
[43:10] habitation
[43:12] he hath reserved in everlasting chains
[43:14] in the darkness and the judgment of the
[43:16] great day
[43:17] so they come my brother and sister a
[43:19] conscious decision anointing many people
[43:21] describe it many ways but they come to a
[43:24] place that the very habitation that god
[43:26] gave them they looked at that habitation
[43:29] and they looked at an empty promise they
[43:31] looked at a vain promise and they left
[43:33] the very promise of god for this other
[43:36] promise or habitation as it were and
[43:39] they said you know what i value this
[43:41] more than the habitation of god
[43:46] and it was in that realm
[43:48] that their
[43:49] condition was changed forever sure wish
[43:51] we had this screen 1964 726 brother
[43:55] branham preached recognizing your day in
[43:57] its message paragraph 135
[44:00] he said parallel it with today
[44:03] amen praise be to god it's more than
[44:06] life to me my age begins to creep on
[44:09] and i see the hour of vulgarity and
[44:11] immorality sweeping the lands and things
[44:14] then i look back and see what's happened
[44:17] in that we can state this
[44:19] i believe we can take those sentence
[44:20] right there and say that fits today
[44:23] he said my heart leaps for joy knowing
[44:25] that after a while this earthly
[44:27] tabernacle of habitation will be
[44:29] dissolved but i got one waiting yonder
[44:33] i'm trying to pull a
[44:35] chomp them from these things and things
[44:37] and pull them out to show them by the
[44:40] scriptures that god is standing there
[44:42] with a vindication of the pillar fire
[44:44] which hundreds and thousands have seen
[44:47] even had it took before with a camera
[44:50] time to time to prove it
[44:52] impersonators rise up
[44:55] you want to have a good view of the
[44:57] impersonators
[44:59] i should be careful there's big kids
[45:01] probably follow through that but all you
[45:03] have to do is type in church preaching
[45:05] religion into something like youtube
[45:08] and it pops up
[45:11] oh my
[45:13] i don't want to get
[45:14] critical tonight
[45:16] but if you can stomach that
[45:20] you could probably stomach almost
[45:22] anything
[45:25] they're up there
[45:26] skinny jeans
[45:28] shirts unbuttoned but it's okay because
[45:30] i have a big cross hanging there
[45:32] they got styled hair that looks like
[45:35] they dumped some contacts he meant on
[45:39] and then they tell the people
[45:42] this is god's promise to you
[45:45] if you need
[45:47] this or this or this
[45:50] god's obligated to give it to you
[45:53] god's not obligated to
[45:55] no god said i'm in my word
[45:57] and i obligated myself to my word
[46:00] that's the only thing i obligated myself
[46:02] is to my word
[46:03] now when the words in you and i he's
[46:05] obligated to us
[46:06] but when we're outside of the word it's
[46:08] not obligated and people want to put an
[46:10] obligation on god and so the world now
[46:13] my brother and sister now the prophet of
[46:15] god talked about when these people start
[46:17] thirsting for the holy ghost it's
[46:18] getting close and people are now
[46:20] starting to rise up and say yes we've
[46:22] gave millions to these people but we
[46:24] realize they're actually serving
[46:26] themselves and not serving the body of
[46:28] christ and people are starting to push
[46:30] that so the impersonations paragraph 136
[46:33] impersonations rise up sure it's got to
[46:35] be done
[46:37] impersonators rose up in the day of
[46:39] moses and done the same thing god said
[46:41] separate yourself moses don't ring don't
[46:44] hang around them i'll swallow them up
[46:50] and it's interesting how many people
[46:51] read that don't make the correlation to
[46:53] the day we're living in
[46:56] brother brown says
[46:58] and the world got them
[47:01] he didn't say the earth swallowed him up
[47:02] do you see where he makes the transition
[47:04] right there and the world got them and
[47:06] so it is today they go right back in the
[47:09] world
[47:10] money schemes
[47:12] and everything else see
[47:16] oh um
[47:17] if you guys are interested in the latest
[47:19] lmm
[47:21] what is that
[47:22] l
[47:23] m l m you know i'm not very experienced
[47:26] at this
[47:27] we have a sign up sheet in the back
[47:31] i'm telling you saints as long as god
[47:33] would allow me you would allow me to be
[47:34] a pastor of this church i will burn down
[47:37] anybody trying to sell that in the house
[47:38] of god
[47:40] i will be beyond rude i'll have to
[47:42] repent to you afterwards but you see
[47:45] this being fulfilled we see this
[47:47] happening over and over and over again
[47:50] and all it is brother trevor you can
[47:51] build your own little thing and you
[47:53] don't want sister carrie to build on
[47:54] yours you want to build your own and
[47:56] she'll build one so all i need is 500 a
[47:58] piece
[47:59] sister sue i know it'll be painful but i
[48:01] just 500 you'll get it back you'll get
[48:03] rich
[48:04] and i've seen it sweep the church
[48:06] and we say we're message believers and
[48:08] the prophet of god says words like this
[48:11] and they don't even it don't even touch
[48:13] them
[48:15] why because they're building the wrong
[48:16] habitation
[48:18] they're not building a house of god
[48:20] they're building a house on earth
[48:22] now we all have to live right
[48:25] amen but brother and sister the prophet
[48:27] god's saying you know what they're going
[48:28] to do they're going to have money
[48:29] schemes and everything else
[48:31] now we're going to go back to jude jude
[48:34] the first
[48:35] chapter
[48:37] as it is only chapter verses 20 through
[48:39] 25
[48:40] but ye beloved
[48:42] building up yourselves in the most holy
[48:45] faith
[48:46] praying in the holy ghost
[48:48] now i had an individual one time say
[48:50] brother paul i don't understand that
[48:51] praying in the holy ghost i had to look
[48:53] him in the eye and say i don't know i
[48:55] don't understand it either
[48:57] what you're the preacher you should
[48:58] understand it
[49:00] now let me tell you why i don't
[49:01] understand it
[49:03] because there's times saints
[49:05] that i pray for things
[49:08] i pray for things in this body of
[49:09] believers i pray for things in my family
[49:13] and i go before the lord and i feel like
[49:15] i have been kicked drugged and whatever
[49:17] just and i say lord just
[49:21] lord i need you to i need you to just
[49:23] take care of this
[49:26] i don't sound like i'm praying in the
[49:27] spirit does it
[49:29] god answers that prayer
[49:31] so what do we get the idea that the
[49:33] preacher or the wife or husband is say
[49:35] you know in their their devotions
[49:38] oh the praise alone you're going to do
[49:40] this lord for me
[49:43] oh they were in the spirit
[49:44] i've seen it in church
[49:46] i've seen people almost almost you know
[49:49] cause them to go to the chiropractor the
[49:51] next day because they're there oh praise
[49:53] allah
[49:55] that's not the spirit my brother and
[49:57] sister the spirit is when your heart's
[49:59] desire and the character of your soul
[50:04] is lined up with the word of god
[50:06] there you're praying in the spirit it
[50:08] doesn't require a bunch of shouting it
[50:10] doesn't require running it doesn't
[50:12] require anything but to get in that and
[50:15] say as it were to put it simple you see
[50:17] jesus prayed
[50:19] in the garden in the spirit
[50:22] lord
[50:24] thy
[50:24] will thy will be done you see he would
[50:27] have been out of the spirit of what god
[50:29] was accomplishing if he'd have said lord
[50:31] i've decided to do something different
[50:32] here
[50:34] but he got in the spirit he knew where
[50:35] god was taking him saints when we're in
[50:37] the word and we have claimed the word we
[50:40] express the word and we are desiring to
[50:42] live the word you will find yourself
[50:44] praying in the spirit and god will cause
[50:47] you to pray as the scripture says we
[50:48] don't even know how to pray we don't
[50:51] even know what to pray for but the holy
[50:53] spirit guides us
[50:55] we pray in this spirit oh i i think it's
[50:58] it's nice when we get you know an
[51:00] anointing we get excited we you know
[51:02] just to have a you know a time of prayer
[51:04] just so thank you lord i know you're
[51:06] gonna come i know you're gonna do this
[51:08] lord your word promised it i believe it
[51:11] lord that's wonderful to pray that but
[51:13] i'm telling you my brother and sister
[51:14] day in and day out we don't feel that
[51:16] way do we if we lift our hand and tell
[51:18] the truth
[51:20] but we can get in the spirit
[51:23] and it's the holy spirit guiding us when
[51:25] we say you know what i i'll just put it
[51:28] kind of direct
[51:31] lord i i just know that
[51:33] brother so and so sister so and so
[51:35] they've got struggles they've got
[51:36] troubles there's something happening
[51:39] they've got teenagers lord
[51:44] the lord i know you promised and you're
[51:46] going to deliver and this is your
[51:47] heart's desire and this is what we
[51:49] desire and it don't sound so beautiful
[51:55] but god says that's what i wanted you to
[51:57] do
[51:58] i wanted you
[51:59] to bear one another's burden i wanted
[52:01] you to enter in
[52:03] for them i wanted you to become an
[52:05] intercessor
[52:08] but here again
[52:10] a little off track but i want to say
[52:11] this
[52:13] we find ourselves saying
[52:16] lord i need this lord i need this
[52:18] my family lord
[52:20] this this this
[52:24] probably not in the spirit saints
[52:27] amen
[52:28] you know you'll have more blessings if
[52:30] you'll pray for everybody but yourself
[52:32] now imagine those of us here tonight if
[52:34] every one of us truly prayed for
[52:36] everybody but ourselves
[52:38] i'm not going to count it i'm just going
[52:40] to say there's 35 of us
[52:42] there's 35 people praying for me
[52:46] or myself
[52:48] one
[52:50] i think i'll think i'll settle for i'll
[52:52] pray for all 35 of you if all 35 of you
[52:54] will pay pray for me
[52:56] amen makes way more sense but you see
[52:58] the word foundation is that we don't
[53:01] live for ourself what the prophet of god
[53:03] tell us being a christian
[53:05] is living for others
[53:07] let me change that being a christian
[53:09] praying for others
[53:12] being a christian
[53:14] serving
[53:16] others
[53:20] oh while i was talking somebody stole
[53:22] the time
[53:26] now look at this
[53:29] keeping yourselves in the love of god
[53:31] this is connected together my brother
[53:32] and sister remember we're the ones
[53:35] that have put
[53:36] verses
[53:38] and periods
[53:41] but beloved building up yourselves and
[53:42] your most holy faith praying in the holy
[53:45] ghost
[53:46] keep yourselves in the love of god
[53:48] looking for the mercy of our lord jesus
[53:50] christ into eternal life and some have
[53:53] compassion making a difference and
[53:56] others save with fear pulling them out
[53:58] of the fire hating even a garment
[54:00] spotted by the flesh
[54:02] now unto him that is able to keep you
[54:04] from falling
[54:06] and present you faultless before the
[54:08] presence of his glory with exceeding joy
[54:10] to the only wise god our savior be glory
[54:13] and majesty and dominion and power both
[54:15] now and ever amen so he closes this
[54:19] whole thought out my brother and sister
[54:22] by telling you and i that god is going
[54:25] to keep us
[54:26] amen that we are held by the power of
[54:30] the word we'll keep you from falling and
[54:32] we'll present you faultless now i can't
[54:35] stand here tonight and tell you i'm
[54:36] faultless i don't believe any of you can
[54:38] sit here tonight and say i'm faultless
[54:41] but there is one who has said you know
[54:43] what i can make this tabernacle this
[54:46] habitation be faultless it will be
[54:48] perfect according to the plan by which i
[54:50] come to build it
[54:52] and it's in that that we have
[54:55] security
[55:02] i think for the sake of time i'll move
[55:04] but
[55:05] move on here
[55:06] but in earnestly contending for the
[55:09] faith that was once delivered to the
[55:10] saints brother branham
[55:12] is
[55:13] telling them that they're preserved
[55:15] going down through that starting right
[55:17] the very start of the of the sermon
[55:19] paragraph 4
[55:21] and he says now you're the people i'm
[55:23] talking to that will earnestly
[55:25] that will
[55:26] that you will earnestly contend for the
[55:29] faith it was once delivered not the not
[55:31] a faith that was delivered but the faith
[55:33] that was delivered not a faith
[55:35] but the faith
[55:37] did you notice there the faith once
[55:39] delivered to the saints not just a faith
[55:42] some people say well that's against my
[55:43] faith there's only one faith
[55:46] one faith one lord one god one baptism
[55:49] one faith
[55:51] and people say now i have a faith and i
[55:54] go to my own church
[55:55] well that's not what jude's speaking to
[55:57] here he's talking to the people that's
[55:59] to contend for the faith that was once
[56:02] delivered to the saints amen saints i
[56:04] regardless of what the world thinks
[56:06] about you and i they make their little
[56:08] videos they make their little
[56:09] declarations of why you know they make
[56:11] use words like
[56:13] they're
[56:14] arrogant no i'm not arrogant
[56:17] i'm willing to concede that there is
[56:19] thousands and tens of thousands of
[56:21] people that god will say but there is
[56:23] one thing i can declare to you i
[56:26] absolutely with every fiber of my being
[56:29] believe i'm one of them
[56:31] now i'm not going to be condescended to
[56:33] as though i'm just some kind of trash
[56:36] when i am of the royal seed of abraham
[56:39] when i have been spoken through the word
[56:42] and declared to be of the mind of god
[56:44] and the spirit of god my brother and
[56:46] sister i don't mean to come across there
[56:48] again i want to be confident
[56:51] i want to be able to come boldly to the
[56:53] throne of god if you don't have
[56:55] confidence in who you are and what god
[56:57] called you for you will not come boldly
[56:59] to the throne you will come as a beggar
[57:02] you will come as one thinking that they
[57:04] are unworthy and we all deal with that
[57:07] can we be truthful oh i'm not even
[57:09] worthy
[57:10] well good he said you're worthy
[57:12] now you can believe yourself the devil
[57:15] or god
[57:16] make your choice
[57:18] he said you're worthy i'm worthy
[57:22] he said i'm chosen i believe i'm chosen
[57:25] he said i'm sanctified
[57:27] and filled with the holy ghost and i
[57:29] believe that
[57:30] amen
[57:33] he said you know
[57:36] now let me just jump along here
[57:40] now if we'll go back to where they first
[57:42] called saints
[57:44] and found out what kind of faith they
[57:46] had then we'll know more or less
[57:48] what they contend or what to contend for
[57:51] now when the church
[57:53] be called was called saint
[57:55] was after they were sanctified and the
[57:57] word sanctified or saint becomes
[57:59] sanctified meaning clean pure holy
[58:01] unadulterated so forth that's my heart's
[58:03] desire now if there was in the beginning
[58:06] of the church when it was inaugurated at
[58:08] the day of pentecost now let's look at
[58:11] what they had back there what the church
[58:13] contended for
[58:15] and what they lost
[58:17] now just 33 years after the beginning of
[58:20] the church
[58:22] now you know jude wouldn't be talking
[58:24] about back in the old testament under
[58:26] the levitical law see
[58:28] because they were he's a christian he's
[58:30] talking about the first church was set
[58:32] in order was inaugurated on the day of
[58:34] pentecost
[58:35] and
[58:36] i'll just paraphrase some of this
[58:39] they'd already lost it
[58:42] come on saints i i don't want to sound
[58:44] negative here
[58:47] what are we 60
[58:51] get my brain to do the math
[58:53] 56
[58:56] 56 years they lost it in 30.
[59:02] that be right 1965.
[59:06] oh
[59:08] yeah
[59:11] okay i'm sorry i just couldn't get my
[59:13] brain to wrap around that
[59:16] my wife's 56.
[59:29] come on think about it
[59:32] the original church
[59:35] lost it in 30 years
[59:40] and we're 56 years
[59:43] from the lord taking the prophet home
[59:53] we must be tough
[59:55] we're smart
[59:57] we're street wise
[1:00:00] no
[1:00:03] god rich in mercy
[1:00:06] god rich in mercy
[1:00:08] amen
[1:00:09] let's never stop thanking him
[1:00:14] we're going to close right here in just
[1:00:15] a second i got all kinds of other stuff
[1:00:17] here
[1:00:19] now we noticed what kind of faith they
[1:00:21] had
[1:00:21] they had a faith
[1:00:23] in a resurrected
[1:00:25] living christ
[1:00:27] someone who had rose from the dead and
[1:00:30] was living among them
[1:00:31] just the same as he was before he ever
[1:00:34] died
[1:00:35] now that sea
[1:00:37] they wasn't contending
[1:00:39] for some historical affair but they were
[1:00:42] contending for a living christ a
[1:00:45] resurrected one
[1:00:47] who is in their midst
[1:00:50] that's what we're contending for
[1:00:52] not history saints
[1:00:55] now i'm going to take this just a little
[1:00:57] step further if you don't mind sister
[1:00:59] emmy if you'd come
[1:01:02] the prophet of god uses these words
[1:01:03] right here and he says but they were
[1:01:05] contending for a living christ a
[1:01:07] resurrected one who was in their midst
[1:01:11] now when you go my brother and sister
[1:01:13] into genesis and you start looking into
[1:01:17] the fall in the garden
[1:01:19] you'll find that
[1:01:22] in that context
[1:01:24] it didn't come as a revelation
[1:01:27] to the mind
[1:01:30] it didn't come
[1:01:31] as a motivation to the feet
[1:01:34] but a living god who was living
[1:01:36] in the midst
[1:01:38] that's the kind of god
[1:01:40] we're searching for and we are serving
[1:01:42] today
[1:01:43] one in the midst now we could take that
[1:01:45] in a different context and say he's in
[1:01:47] the middle of this room so he's in our
[1:01:48] midst
[1:01:49] but i don't want god just in the middle
[1:01:51] of the room do you
[1:01:52] no sir
[1:01:54] i have got a habitation i've got a
[1:01:56] tabernacle i've been allowed think about
[1:01:59] this the privilege that god has given us
[1:02:01] we have then been given the privilege
[1:02:04] been allowed to build a habitation for
[1:02:07] god and god said because i love
[1:02:09] diversity
[1:02:10] and amazing how satan has taken the word
[1:02:12] diversity
[1:02:14] turned it into an entirely different
[1:02:16] thing but god loves diversity that's why
[1:02:18] he has you that's why he has me you know
[1:02:21] i just think about this i've said this
[1:02:23] before sounds very arrogant and i guess
[1:02:25] we don't take it away from that but
[1:02:27] uh you know it would have been much more
[1:02:29] convenient as a pastor if we just had a
[1:02:31] whole church full of people just like me
[1:02:38] but that is what god wanted he wanted a
[1:02:40] bouquet
[1:02:42] and he wanted you to build your
[1:02:43] habitation and imagine i'm closing i'm
[1:02:46] done
[1:02:48] the lafontaine sing that song are you
[1:02:51] she we're probably all familiar with
[1:02:53] that
[1:02:54] i want you to really think of the depth
[1:02:56] and anointing of that because my brother
[1:02:57] and sister this age
[1:03:00] is the worst worst
[1:03:05] yeah only thing could have done worse
[1:03:07] than that would put a the on the front
[1:03:09] the worst
[1:03:11] wicked age
[1:03:14] brother rich and i was talking
[1:03:16] he had done all the math
[1:03:18] you have to make some assumptions x
[1:03:20] amount of believers on the earth real
[1:03:21] true sons of daughters of god
[1:03:24] he said my mouth paul says that out of
[1:03:27] the river euphrates was dumped another
[1:03:29] 20
[1:03:30] 000 demons for every believer on the
[1:03:34] face of the earth
[1:03:35] you wonder why some days
[1:03:38] feels like you're finding an uphill
[1:03:39] battle
[1:03:40] he was just making that point
[1:03:42] all of those demons been dumped out upon
[1:03:45] you
[1:03:46] and you're fighting your way through
[1:03:47] them but god said don't worry i'm right
[1:03:49] on time i'm running time i'm with you
[1:03:51] i'm walking with you i've already made
[1:03:53] the way before you i made the rough way
[1:03:55] smooth and i provided in fact the answer
[1:03:58] is already on the way so let's just look
[1:04:00] up and say you know what lord i'm
[1:04:01] building this house not for paul haley
[1:04:03] put your name in there i'm not building
[1:04:05] this house for me lord i want to build
[1:04:07] this house for you and i want you to be
[1:04:10] pleased and habitate this house i want
[1:04:12] you to come down so to be pleasing i
[1:04:14] need to build a house that he wants
[1:04:17] not the house that paul wants
[1:04:19] sorry to reference back to brother chris
[1:04:21] but it just strikes me easy has a price
[1:04:23] my brother and sister it could be so
[1:04:25] easy to be a christian and we'll just
[1:04:27] trade easy for eternal life
[1:04:30] lord help me to fight
[1:04:31] give me strength give me courage but
[1:04:33] most of all lord let me go back to the
[1:04:35] cornerstone amen to be a real true
[1:04:38] carpenter i i learned to frame houses
[1:04:41] under a man that said now i want you to
[1:04:43] listen to me boy
[1:04:45] you will measure two three four five
[1:04:48] times but when you cut that it better be
[1:04:51] right
[1:04:54] help us
[1:04:55] help us lord
[1:04:57] that we don't just take the easy way but
[1:05:00] we look at this and say lord this is a
[1:05:02] house
[1:05:03] i don't want to worry about i live in
[1:05:08] lord am i building a house
[1:05:10] that you will live in
[1:05:13] that's what we're searching for saints
[1:05:15] amen reminds me a little story
[1:05:19] you know the story
[1:05:22] the man had been the foreman building
[1:05:24] big beautiful houses for everyone
[1:05:28] and he thought this last house i'm going
[1:05:30] to be cheap on it and i'm going to
[1:05:31] pocket some of that money because he's
[1:05:33] retiring and i have nothing
[1:05:35] in the end you know a story i'm talking
[1:05:37] about
[1:05:38] in the end what does he do
[1:05:41] this cheap chintzy house he built
[1:05:44] was given to him
[1:05:48] let's just for a moment here
[1:05:50] think about the natural the carnal
[1:05:56] when the doorknob come off in his hand
[1:05:59] and the windows won't open
[1:06:03] when the cabinets shelves collapse
[1:06:07] every time he'd been remembering
[1:06:09] if i had only
[1:06:11] just built this
[1:06:14] to what i was supposed to build this i
[1:06:16] would be living
[1:06:18] in a beautiful house
[1:06:21] lord help us
[1:06:22] saints i just want to encourage you lord
[1:06:24] help us
[1:06:25] when it gets hard press harder
[1:06:29] pray harder

[1:06:33] trust him more
[1:06:35] because he's actually
[1:06:38] the one building
[1:06:40] this house
[1:06:41] i say thank you lord he's building it
[1:06:44] with his word
[1:06:45] he's building it by the leadership of
[1:06:47] his holy spirit

[1:11:48] closer lord to you
[1:11:54] for i desire
[1:11:56] to worship
[1:11:58] and obey
[1:12:04] can we say amen to that
[1:12:06] hallelujah i'd like to sing psalms 19 as
[1:12:09] our
[1:12:10] dismissing song
[1:12:12] you know it's
[1:12:14] very providential i believe
[1:12:17] when we look at this song because
[1:12:20] it's actually declaring to us that
[1:12:23] this word right here is unerring
[1:12:26] infallible
[1:12:30] it takes the educated
[1:12:33] and god hides himself from it but we
[1:12:35] come in the simplicity of the word and
[1:12:37] he reveals himself i i love this song is
[1:12:40] all i can say
[1:12:41] hallelujah
[1:12:45] the law of the lord is perfect
[1:12:50] [Music]
[1:12:51] converting the soul
[1:12:56] the
[1:12:57] testimony of the lord is sure
[1:13:02] making
[1:13:15] gold
[1:13:30] statutes of the lord all right
[1:13:34] [Music]
[1:13:35] rejoicing the heart
[1:13:40] the commandment of the lord is
[1:13:44] pure
[1:13:46] enlightening the eyes
[1:13:51] more to be
[1:13:53] desired a day
[1:13:55] than gold gave a much fine gold
[1:14:02] sweeter also than honey
[1:14:07] and the honeycomb
[1:14:09] [Laughter]
[1:14:12] the fear of the lord is clean
[1:14:17] [Music]
[1:14:19] enduring forever
[1:14:23] the judgments of the lord are true
[1:14:29] and righteous all together
[1:14:34] and in the keeping of them there is
[1:14:37] great reward there is great reward
[1:14:45] in the keeping of them
[1:14:50] there is great reward
[1:14:55] god bless you saints
[1:14:57] i trust tonight
[1:15:00] this whole foundation in building a
[1:15:02] house has
[1:15:04] been weighing quite heavily on my heart
[1:15:06] because as i look through the land and
[1:15:08] i interact with people i realize how
[1:15:11] many foundations were not properly laid
[1:15:14] and people wonder
[1:15:15] why they're not finding liberty in the
[1:15:17] word
[1:15:18] they're not finding liberty in their
[1:15:20] life
[1:15:22] sometimes we just have to go back and
[1:15:24] examine the foundation and
[1:15:26] as it were find
[1:15:29] what was not put in the right place and
[1:15:31] find what is missing maybe altogether
[1:15:35] and there it's nothing to be ashamed of
[1:15:37] it's god's desire
[1:15:40] that we come to that place that we have
[1:15:42] built a perfect habitation
[1:15:44] according to the word of god and i just
[1:15:46] encourage you
[1:15:47] in your prayers and your devotions in
[1:15:49] your scriptural readings your study of
[1:15:52] the message
[1:15:53] just stop regardless of what we've been
[1:15:56] taught before
[1:15:58] i've been doing this myself recently and
[1:16:01] i'm reading this scripture and i'm
[1:16:02] saying lord
[1:16:04] my understanding
[1:16:06] you see it's not about oh this is this
[1:16:08] and this is that but lord is my
[1:16:10] understanding correct
[1:16:12] i want to understand the word and i want
[1:16:14] it to be alive to me so when i build
[1:16:17] upon this i don't come up with the wrong
[1:16:19] conclusion and saints i just encourage
[1:16:22] you we're not backslid
[1:16:24] we're not lost
[1:16:25] but i believe as we get closer to the
[1:16:28] coming of the lord
[1:16:29] it's kind of brother branham calls it a
[1:16:31] checkup time
[1:16:33] let's check up
[1:16:34] god bless you we love you in the lord
[1:16:36] we'll see you on sunday
[1:16:38] amen
