a blessing amen and here in our midst here amen god bless you and we know that god orders all things well and he does all things well so we have a rest place so we have what a beautiful rest place amen god bless you musicians you can have your seat amen we're just thankful for the grace of god in our life amen amen amen in jesus name we press on you know he's provided everything we need already isn't that lovely you know there's not nothing nothing there's no place of rest outside of him i'm glad we have a resting place i'm glad in this hour and time of this going on we have a hiding place amen in christ precious hiding place nothing can break through into that hiding place but what god nothing can nothing can nothing will but there's nothing that can come our way that might have that might move us except it's allowed by god amen but you know what it'll do it'll just allow us to express god's love all the more if you'll stand with me amen i'd like you to turn with me in your bibles to first john chapter 2. for one of the scriptures here i have i have a few here tonight but i don't plan to take too long i was had something i had in my heart to and i know a minister understands this but i had something in my heart i thought for sure the lord wanted me and what he gave me was beautiful but then right the last hour of studying there or less he turned me around to this so i've just got a few things just written on a piece of paper and then i had some had to grab some books here so you just forgive me if i go the old-fashioned way a little bit and read the message book and i just uh it's okay if we write it out on a on uh here to read i've got a few things right here i've got did get printed but but um i'm just thankful for the grace of god aren't you his grace is sufficient in first john chapter two and starting with verse three and hereby we do know that we know him isn't that lovely i mean he knows him this is more than an intellectual knowledge this is a relationship and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him and the truth who is the truth jesus said i am the way i am the truth we know and the life and we know that he is truth and the truth or other words himself liveth not in you amen because you can't keep god's commandments in your own flesh the idea and thinking of your own power it takes the holy ghost who wrote this word to come in and live that word amen and keep it right and so let me read it again hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments and he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar that's you say that's pretty strong well the word just goes right to point doesn't it amen we should talk plain too amen in love of course but how if you keep his commandments you have his love hallelujah amen all right so he's a liar and the truth is not in him but who so keepeth his word comma it's important you see that comma there he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandment oh i'm sorry i had the wrong comma but anyway it's a good comma that's i want the next verse he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar excuse me i was on the right verse i just read that again didn't i verse 5 because it's just about but whoso keepeth his word comma in him verily is the love of god perfected amen hereby know we oh hallelujah hereby know we that we are in him then who are you okay hereby know we that we are in him let me read this again whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of god perfected hereby know we that we are in him he that saith he abideth this isn't this isn't just this isn't just out here in the in the sanctified realm of your spirit this is on the inside of the inside he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked why it's your life all right i'd like you to go with me over to philippians 2. philippians 2. chapter 2 and verse verse 13. for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure that's a powerful scripture for it is god which worketh in you let's look back to what we just read for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure and remember he's sovereign all right do all things without murmurings and disputings that we how can we have why should we have to murmur if we know god is working in us everything is controlled it's ordered of him amen how many believe that i believe god has that preeminence amen remember there is no fear in love all right do all things without murmurings and disputings that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation in whom you shine as lights in the world holding forth the word of life that i may rejoice in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither labored in vain you may be seated turn with me to one more scripture for the beginning here in galatians chapter five and we'll read here verse 1 first stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage i want to come down here to verse 5 for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love let me say that again but faith that which worketh by love amen amen all right praise the lord in the church age book on page 118 he said this let me just start up here just a little bit ahead of this the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval the cloudy skies and storms of this life you're going to have storms and you're going to have cloudy skies you're going to have trials you're going to have tribulations you're going to have testings and life in this life is going to be a struggle but it depends on how you are what you do with them and that depends on what's in you in the soul amen all right all right so the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval neither are bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved you have been accepted the bible said in christ you believe that amen right then what then where's the murmuring see you've been accepted you have been let's put it this way you've been pre-approved you have been approved in christ everything you need has been provided in him he with you in him was perfected by sufferings the prophet said amen he was perfected and because he was perfected what are you going to do you have to come to that perfection with him in you the same spirit that was is him is in you doing the same works because what was embodied in him working his work through him is now embodied in you is that right it's now embodied in you let me let me just get this right here real quick and just i'll just show it to you how the prophet said it so you'll understand and and i'm not just saying that because i believe but it becomes reality to an individual amen it's not a man it's not just a preacher it's not a certain congregation it's the holy spirit showing the same things it did when it was embodied in the body of jesus christ he said he said see the action of the great holy spirit see him come down visible before people even take pictures of it see it's working and showing it's not a man not a preacher not a congregation certain congregation it's the holy spirit the same thing it did it's the holy spirit showing the same thing it did when it was embodied in the body of jesus christ now it's embodied in the body of his bride it should showa throw us into desperation amen amen and so he goes on to say here his he said we're accepted where our approval is only in the beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us notice his love is elective jacob i loved he saw i hated he loved jacob before jacob did any works anything why did jacob want the birthright why did he desire the birthright more than anything it was god working in him it was the seed working in him he said i love jacob because jacob was in me before the foundation of the world jacob's my seed jacob held the seed all right so he said his love is elective when he which he had be for us before the foundation of the world does he love us oh yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so amen and manifested that he did and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself amen he brought us to himself you didn't have that ability you did not have the ability to go out searching for god you weren't searching for god god searched for you and he found you amen remember how he gave the illustration of the eagle flying around he finally found the barnyard whereas where his genome where the gene of him of itself was right amen all right and he said and that gene that that that germ that was to be you he said before the foundation of the world find you so that germ that was to be you was eternal so that germ that was to be you was god so that germ comes and finds you you can't hide you can't run far enough he'll find you but he'll find you through the word of promise for this hour he'll find you through the ministering of that faith he'll lead you to that there you stumbled along brother branham said one day you've you stumbled along into a congregation you heard the word of your salvation and you accepted it he said not what led you to that you were just stumbling along you thought you were stumbling but your steps were ordered all right so he goes on to say he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit proving he loved us placing us as sons and how that's what i want to get to right here and how shall i prove or project my subject tonight is love projected amen the love of god i'm not talking about an affiliate i'm talking about an agape love which i which we do a filial love and we believe there's a filial love but if it's not governed by agape love of filial love is in vain amen hey man you can have a feeling of love for your wife you have a feeling of love for one another but it's but if it's not backed up by agape love just like he said you can you can prophesy you can speak in tongues with men and angels you can know all you have all know all mysteries have all knowledge feed the poor give your body to be burned and have not charity that's godly divine love that's god's own love and have not charity it's all in vain amen i'm not saying god won't won't won't judge it someday at the white throne but we're not talking about us standing at before the judgment at the white throne we're talking about us standing next in his our position as queen at the white throne judging so we're talking about making the rapture amen amen you can't produce any sort of thing at all to break the rapture it takes god working in you and that's elective love he had that love for you and he said how do i prove my love to him watch this now by believing what he said faith and what he said by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy watch the conduct here's the faith that believes what he says but if it's a real faith in believing what he said it'll act upon what he said amen because because of what because of the love of god in your hearts shed and put there by god himself you can't have the love of god in your soul without god being there amen all right so he said he said so to prove the love i believe what he said and by conducting myself with joy not poochy lips joy not murmuring joy you say well you just don't understand brother david all this stuff that come around it was my fault no god allowed it to be your fault then god allowed it i didn't get an amen on that but i've got a quote here i'm going to read you in a few minutes it'll it's absolutely send you exactly where you need to be in believing that god orders our way you may think you're ordering your way but if you're in christ dead to yourself god's alive in you and you may wonder why you're going through these things he allowed it for a purpose for you by those trials and tests to manifest and express his love amen all right how do i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials oh now the next now the next uh sentence that he the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass hallelujah all right all right see we think we thought we thought he said we know that did you love jacob he did esau he said yet i love jacob and he said and lay and esau i hated i laid his mountains in heritage the waste the dragons the wilderness you see they could not figure out god's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought love meant a baby with parental care but god said my love is elective love the proof of his love is election his love was proven by the truly by the fact that you were chosen of salvation because god had chosen you to salvation through the sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is sovereign but it is all with a purpose hallelujah you cannot move out of his eternal purpose for you you can't get out of that when you're filled with him you're not going to get out of that eternal purpose i don't care what you think you might be going through he has ordered that by his wisdom and he wants you and it gives you that opportunity then to project that love by believing what he said and conducting yourself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom has allowed to come to pass hallelujah if i yell at you like like a brother we were talking in there you know i sound like a lion roaring that's because my middle name is leon and leon means lion-like so i guess and then brother jason said you might as well let you in go out of the gate right now and go preaching because and i guess i was kind of roaring at him all right he goes like is he gone i thought well i am what i am by the grace of god and i said you are what you are i may not like what you are but but i'm happy that my brother is what he is and i may be different but i'm happy all right that's right you're not like brother david he's really different well that's all right i may be but i love you with all my heart and i know i love god and i can't love you unless i do love god and i know i love god so quit trying to judge me by the outward appearance no i'm not saying you are but but there are those we judge one another by how just that's not the fruit we're looking at although i believe the fruit is bore if it's an inside life it'll bear the fruit but part of that fruit is when you make a mistake forgive me i said when you make a mistake you're going to make mistakes you're going to have mistakes out here you're going to make it but this is not who god identified you to be who god identified you to be as that holy ghost that's down inside of you and that's changing you from glory to glory you're being changed into the same image that you see yourself in the mirror to be hallelujah hallelujah that's who you see you're looking in the mirror with an open face it's no longer the veils not hiding your face now you're seeing in clear view the glory of god and what are you seeing as in a mirror as in a mirror you're seeing yourself but what are you looking at the glory of god and the lord the word says that he would pour out his glory upon his bride his bride would be his glory but he said he wouldn't give his glory to another well she's not another so he said my light thy light has come and the glory of the lord is risen upon her so because we have a perfect interpretation of a perfect word in this hour with divine vindication what are we looking at we're looking at uh at the at the on with an unveiled face we're seeing exactly who we are he's brought us into the inside of the inside we've come into the inside of the inside all right well i'm a little ahead of myself here but let's we'll go on right from that just a moment all right so his love it's his prerogative he all has a purpose with it he doesn't do it he's not the author of frustration he has a plan he has a purpose in why he allows you to go through things he has a plan a purpose but what are you doing murmuring complaining that you have to go through it you just need a little more you need a little more love projected to you you need a little come in a little deeper come in a little deeper you say well brother david what are you trying to say come into the reality of who you are and then you won't have no for fear of your mistakes and your sufferings and your heart and these things that are against it against this the greatest enemy you've got is this man right here that man right there amen we have to die daily to this take up our cross to see jesus christ manifested amen where in your body where manifested where in your flesh you're bearing about the daddy dying of the of the lord daily that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in your mortal flesh your mortal body the scripture said is that right so how's that going to happen you have to dock to yourself daily take up your cross by love follow this word all right now see we know faith works by love brother brown said in the message why are people so tossed about he said the heart is the abode of god and he said and in the old testament god dwelt in his glory over the ark heart is the ark god dwells not in the head but in the heart god is not known by theology god is not known by mental conceptions god is known by an old-fashioned sanctified born-again experience that is in the human heart yet men and women haven't live a good life and love god by mental conception but the real hiding that watch they live a good life and even love god by mental conception brother branham said you could he said you could you could love god in your spirit even love god and he said and turn right around and be a devil on the inside of your soul that's what he said and he said you can have the genuine anointing of the holy ghost in that spirit realm and be exactly if it's a huckleberry in the soul you will live a huckleberry life by that power of the holy ghost because the rain come upon it what did what was it was sent for the wheat the word is that right it rain came upon that weed and that we'd live by the same life and could shout just as loud as any of us and i believe in shouting and can praise the lord and cast out devils and see miracles and i believe in every bit of that amen amen is that right you can do every bit of that you have every bit of that and that's fine but you know what the prophet said in the seventh seal he said i've seen he said i thank god for these opening of these seals he said this and he said that i'm just not saying verbatim but this is what he said he said he said i yeah thank god for the opening of those seals in the hour and this has been a tremendous blessing to me he said i've seen mighty miracles and signs and wonders he said but this is beyond that and you just stop and think about that have we done away with this not a bit not a bit we if you don't believe in signs miracles wonders there's something with your association with god something wrong is that right but he said this opening of the word brought us into a full complete revelation for the rapture amen a revelation of who we are when that book was opened it was a marriage certificate and god entered in with his wife into an invisible union and it had to be that invisible union before you could meet him in the air because that's going to the wedding supper so something happens before that wedding supper that brother branham identified in perfect love i mean proving his word and i don't know why i'm saying this because i'm entering into the thing that i had in my heart to say but i guess he's blending it into this amen all right so are you with me i haven't lost you when you enter into that that's that's an abiding place that's only an individual affair that's between you and god you don't go in there with anybody else you go in there with him you meet him you have for you have not knowing with him you have a union with him it's not done out in public it's not a public show it's not known to the public at all jesus said it doesn't come with observation and you look up that word observation it means outward show but that is beyond because it's seed time amen and we every bit of us don't you go away saying brother david doesn't believe in signs and wonders and miracles i absolutely believe it i've seen it happen our married our mary uh uh buckley here she does not go into surgery she's had surgery and she's gone through surgery and she god is really undertaken amen and so we thank god for that we several things this last few days we've seen god do i've seen god raise the dead i've seen god take take absolutely move a storm out of the way exactly by the word spoken you say i don't believe that i believe that absolutely believe that but when you enter into that inside of that inside and know that you are absolutely a seed of god and that you are and he god identifies you and you and him amen there love begins to project there you grow up there's what brother branham said is that is that is that gift the real gift that the holy ghost was sent to quicken and open up what is that what is that that's beyond that other he said what's beyond it that third poll the full opening of the word amen are you with me it opens up the word you be you see who you are you come to the reality of who you are and you couldn't deny yourself if you wanted to and god couldn't deny you you're in union with god amen all right i'm talking about love being projected all right now so and when christ when christ he says the real hiding place is in the heart hid with christ the bible said he shall hide me in the secret of his tabernacle you know in the midst the storm the ship was tossed oh they missed the storm and they were struggling against the wind oh they were struggling they were in the second realm you might say struggling against that ship that ship was tossed it was tossed this way it was tossed away but he was in the hinder part of the ship at rest on a pillow why you say how could he sleep in a time like that how could he rest in a time like that because he had entered into rest amen are you with me i kind of combined spiritual and natural there because he entered into rest and when you enter into rest when you've entered interest you cease from your own labors hallelujah and that ship can be tossed any way you want to but in there you come to realize absolutely by revelation you're growing into the very stature set of god that he said this is who you are and this is who you see hallelujah and you know who you are that's why the old ship out here can be tossed this way and that way and you're going to have tossing and the ship's going to be tossed but when you are in there you're at rest but he was in the scene and they were out there doing what they they were fighting and battling and couldn't figure out why i fight this i get up i go to a service and i'm built up tomorrow i have a struggle and i'm this and i'm dead and i can never seem to get the victory you just know to go a little farther in behind that interval let the because outside of when you're outside of there it's dark to you you can't see what's in there you can't see it it's a glass dark you still have a veil there but when you break through that veil then you see clearly who you are clearly then you grow up in christ clearly the word becomes unveiled to you and this is why the message of the opening of the seventh seal has opened to us to let us see that we are the mystery of god revealed [Applause] hallelujah that's it we are living in that revelation with that revelation in there that shekinah glory you are part of it glory to god you're not worried about this because this isn't who you are and by the revelation of who you are you control this by faith that worketh by love amen amen amen hallelujah and when christ the holy spirit comes into your heart he is in you you ready he is in you with your temperament he is in you with your temperament i don't like my temperament are you in christ well i know i've got you do have some control of your temperament if you yield it to the word that's right otherwise if you try to take it under your own hands you're just making a mess but when christ is in you know who you are and no this is not the real you but someday that real you inside will change this moral body hallelujah [Applause] he'll change it in the twinkling of an eye amen you'll be caught up and that's already working that's already begun started it's already working in you and he that has begun a good work and you will finish it boo devil he that started a good work in me will finish it because i've been ordained to those good works in me amen all right he's living his he is he is living his own life through his own will through you hallelujah i know it sounds awful but it's right that's what brother brown said i know it sounds awful but it's right what's he trying to say i know it seems contrary to the flesh but it's right he said he said but it's right christ christ he said so yielded you are that christ speaks the kinds of words he would speak he thinks the kind of thoughts he would think through you he does the kind of works he would do through you you are yielded and resting praise the lord hidden christ say all they want to about coven see all they want to about these things sell politicians they hate trump and trump hates the democrats and the democrats hate him and now of all the while everything controlled by rome anyway yes sir they're all fighting one another and they're all stirring it up to get your get your attention on that and their attention certainly is but that's not our attention that's not our attention our attention is not there our attention's on this lovely lord jesus that our focus is on listen to what he said when a man once catches the vision of the invisible god and know he's always present he said there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking does it matter what you think absolutely it matters what you think according to the word you know what i'm saying think on these things because it's a channel your thinking is a spirit realm and and god said i would manifest myself and it's a channel for his manifestation to come through because the spirit controls the body are you with me the soul controls the spirit so ultimately whatever you are in the soul will manifest itself through the body you can say what you want but the fruit of the season if the fruit of the season is not manifest it's a wrong it's a wrong spirit down in that soul say i love god and the love of god doesn't manifest what will the love of god be manifested it'll rejoice in the truth are you with me it'll rejoice in the message of the hour what else does charity do suffers long amen and his kind we could go on and on couldn't we but i'm bringing that in about suffering because people don't think that you should suffer and we don't ask for suffering and we're not out here begging some suffering we don't want suffering but its suffering is okay because it's going to glorify the lord he's got control of that amen but he's also going to see what you're going to do about it what you do about it is his love manifested because what are you going to do about it bring it under the headship of the word i don't care what the situation is okay i want to i wanna hurry along here all right now he said he said this that's there's something when a man catches a vision of visible god there's something that stabilizes a man's thinking it stabilizes his actions look at the stabilizing here who was the stabilizing of the ship that was tossed by the winds he was on the inside he was on the inside of the inside here's the waters out there all stirred up here's the little bark of your boat your spirit realm all being stirred around and fretful and here's the man on the inside of the inside controlling every bit of it and he said i said let's go over to the other side now who's going to say he can't get there he was in the boat wasn't he wasn't he not in the ship is he not in your ship has he not said you'll be there has he not promised you would be there did he not say you would be changed are you not identified and recognized as a part of the resurrection are you not going to be there how do you know he's in the ship hallelujah all he's waiting on is for you the uh the resurrected word to take control over the situation because you and him are one he's saying i've given you that authority then it project my love through faith and take possession did you get that how is faith how is faith projected through love through faith i mean how excuse me how is love projected through faith amen hallelujah all right and so it'll make him what will it cause this person to do that recognizes his his presence invisible god no catches the vision of the invisible god the vision it stabilizes action and in the time of distress and trouble it'll make him look upward make him look upward and above the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the unseen the unseen things are eternal he that hath the son hath life amen is that right then we can say jesus is not was or will be he was and will be but he is the son of god amen and he that will confess that is living confess that because because god will manifest and confess what he is and his love through you he'll use his spirit to do it your spirit to do it which is his spirit then i say his spirit the bible said that he would he would i he would use how's that scripture go let me just look right here real quick i know where it's at in romans the eighth chapter you don't have to turn to it yeah the spirit there it is the spirit capital s the holy spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god god's identifying using your spirit as a channel bearing witness through your spirit that you are his son you are his word you are his love projected amen amen you can't be in god and hate your brother and you can't hate your brother and be in god that's right all right okay now so we have a hiding place you are yielded he said he would he thinks the thoughts he would think through you he does the kind of works he would do through you you are yielded and resting what a beautiful picture you are yielded and resting what a beautiful picture of a consecrated christian amen yielded god is working through paul said for me to live is christ to die is gain not me that liveth anymore galatians 2 20 i'm crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life that i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god brother branham i'll come to it said you cannot have that faith without having god because that faith is god's own faith and the life that i now live in this flesh i live by the faith of the son of god amen that loved me that loved me and gave himself for me look at that look at that scripture jacob i love you just put your name in it david i love amen you couldn't love him until he first loved you it's not that we love god but god loved us and gave himself for us herein is the love of god displayed and no greater love than this that a man would have except is what that he would lay down his own life hallelujah what are you doing daily you're laying down your own life for the kingdom of god you're you are sanctifying placing your own life under the hand of almighty god daily what are you doing it for the body of christ the kingdom of god amen you think i have you think well not just me what do i have to do in the body your little move and your actions what you do with every situation affects the body of christ you being in christ amen that's a bold statement but that's the truth that's absolutely right all right now he said so there's a hiding place see you're not living anymore christ liveth in me amen christ has got control he thinks through your mind sees through your eyes acts to your temperament hallelujah then the things of the world passed away he can do anything he how can it be anything but sweet and pleasant all the time christ has got control now he's not he says it's christ in you you always say sweet and pleasant i just walk around the smile on my face all the time that's not what he's talking about he's talking about how sweet and pleasant where you're living on the inside of the inside you're living there that's always sweet and pleasant it may not be so pleasant of your bark out here it may have some pain and suffering you may have some trials and tests but it's sweet and pleasant just the same because you're in christ and you bring that under and know that he wouldn't allow that but what it's for his good and for his glory and for your good and his glory he's going to work it all right amen the steps of a good man are not will be might be they are ordered of the lord amen all things work together for good to them that love god and are they called according to what and let me put one word in there his eternal purpose because the bible said in ephesians 3 you are you are placed in by the power by his power under an eternal purpose god's working an eternal purpose through you amen amen his eternal purpose is being manifest praise the lord amen amen your whole makeup then is christ your attitude your desire your appetite your everything is christ yielded resting everything perfect oh now brother david he's gone off the deep end everything perfect it just depends on what you're looking through what eyes you're looking at is that right because i sure don't look perfect in your eyes and you're not perfect in mine but i'm perfect in his so which would you rather see through his or through your own amen amen all right thank you for the echo brother all right now amen now i meant that i believe god meant it amen all right i believe the reason that we don't have desperation it's a lack of love the love of god i think that the love of god causes desperation if god is implied because you recognize you you recognize the hour you recognize how late it is you don't want to spend any of your little time foolish you're wanting to be you say oh god show me your word reveal it to me take me off of these other things that get in the way and take my time away from you oh heavenly father let me get in my position quit letting quit let me try to live between two realms here amen quit trying to make me let me not live let me not live between a uh uh a double b double minded in this matter let my mind and my my focus and my attention be single and upon you alone desperate not just well lord if you know just know it's press in we just don't casually walk into this the prophet said this walk we press in i'm glad his mercies are new every morning anybody ever experienced that just so fresh and new and the revelation ran right there and you could have woke up feeling this way but i'm so glad we don't depend on feelings i am so glad i have no confidence in david dean hart i'm going to tell you right now i'm glad i don't have confidence in this man god had put my confidence in the real reality of who i am i am the holy spirit the word opened and revealed in me i live in that i walk in that amen you say you're boasting i'm boasting if i'm boasting at all i'm boasting in the love of god and you and and that has not a boast that's a truth you have that truth also you are a part of that shekinah glory you are the very presence of god to others do we realize that do we realize that we have the mind of the king i'll just let you chew on that this week you have the mind of the king the bride has the mind of the king and she's she's sovereign under headship did you hear me she's sovereign under headship amen that's right what's the headship faith love amen the headship of love she's sovereign under that he gives the orders you pack them out you have his mind you aren't going to speak something contrary to his will amen it will never come from that fountain of life or you may say something oh i shouldn't have said that lord forgive me so and so forgive me i shouldn't have said that forgive me that wasn't right amen anybody with me amen it's a walk of a believer did you know that that expresses jesus christ in you that's love expressed the action of the holy spirit is always forgiving amen the action of the holy spirit is always to bear one another's burden pray for one another do good to them that hate you no matter what they've done forgive them anyway bury it at calvary and let god deal with that person amen are you with me all right okay let's get down here we gotta close here in a minute i believe okay if god is in you the token inside of you remember what's required today is the token what is this person what is this that you go into oh they said it's an individual affair this is not a group affair this is an individual affair you are the one in there with him amen you are partaking of his life or brother branham said something wrong in christ the mystery god revealed he said you're not she is now pregnant with the word is that right absolutely absolutely amen i don't know how many well i won't go there right now i don't have the time you study out the old jewish wedding in the east it was always before the wedding supper they had a union they went in in private in her house in her house you ever see that yep her house where's god hid today in his house which is what her house when he comes in it becomes his house are you with me all right and then he'll take us to his house her house is that right but that consummating of union happens in secret there's your seventh seal amen see we've gone through a period of adoption here where he's been revealing what he's claimed he's been revealing himself to her he redeemed her now he comes to take the book to claim her and he does and there's a season called the season of adoption coming to her position and you lay under that presence of that holy spirit in that room in there you and him become one amen not twain you're one hallelujah and you're growing him right there you grow in him right on into the rapture the body change are you with me all right i'll get off of that i've got to get back to my topic here now the word plainly states now if you got the token inside of you and you see the conditions of times and people's waiting in the way of sin they are it'll throw you into desperation i believe it will now the word plainly states if you want to put it down galatians 5 6 that faith worketh by love see faith worketh by love the only way you can have faith is to have love first because after all faith is love's incentive amen faith is love's incentive love's encouragement faith is love's encouragement loves motivation or faith's motivation is love incentive incentive that's exactly what what faith is it's an incentive amen to manifest the love of god now if you don't have love you can't have faith how can you have faith in your wife you don't if you don't love her that's a filial he said now if if how about agapo and god how can you how can you be if you don't love god amen we must have love we must have love before we can have faith when we when we have genuine love what does it do it pushes our faith out on the battlefront for god godly love for god and for his word for his people will push faith out there love just takes a hold love takes a hold of faith and just come let's go and out it goes because that's what love does john 14 23 said if a man loves me he will keep my words amen if a man loves me he will keep other words believe hold to believe because what his words are your absolute his words are your absolute no matter what the circumstance is you don't let the circumstance govern you place the word you place you place faith in that word over that circumstance you're putting the word over the circumstance amen all right see godly love for god and for his word and for his people will push faith out there amen all right now love dominates all if you love him you'll keep his words how can now you can't keep his words without having faith in what he said if he loves if see if he loves god then he keeps god's word i am the lord that healeth thee he believes that love makes him believe that amen love makes him believe that oh if i could just if i could just get perfect if i just i just i get i have to go back to church to get the lamp lit are you with me how many has ever read the book why your people are so tossed about he said you go into that second realm and if a person doesn't come in all the way in he's living under a light but an artificial light and he's living under the candlestick light of the churches are you with me but those lights dim down and they go back they go bad they go down in fact they even go out and they've got to be barred you've got to borrow your light to light them again you have to borrow light you have to borrow oil are you with me all right but once you get into that realm inside amen amen he said but you take you go into that innervale let me let me show you right here he said if you go into that inner veil inside of there you go into there he said but when a man walks beyond that second realm and goes in where the other words that in the tent the little room and you go in there and the world is shut off when the veil drops around him down under the locking wings of the cherubim the great shekinah glory under there that light there in there never got dim it never went out did you notice that i'll just drop this in did you notice when the trip that foolish virgin went forth she had their lamps are you with me but took no oil okay but the the wise virgin had their lamps and their vessels with oil there's a difference the foolish virgin never had a vessel full of oil but the but the but the bride or the wise virgin had their lamp had their vessels with their lamps filled with oil oh my you go in there that light will never stop that lamp always is lit amen that's why the prophet said every day monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday they seem to be up they say the sin seems to bother them they have peace they're coming back the word you talk to one of them one time and they'll bring you right back to the word right back to the word right back to the word what is it they're lit they're burning they had oil in their vessel you see the foolish virgin didn't have a vessel of oil they just had their lamp and their lamp went out amen all right now so i'll leave that i got to get back here so now but you see there we are he said okay let's just let's try to see if we can't close this now on the message perfect faith let me just close it off with some of these things right here and we'll stop i'm just right about that time right now all right faith and love is relation do you wanna know where that's found page 22 perfect faith faith and love is relation because you can't have faith unless you got love because your faith is in a god who is the very essence of love faith and love works together amen then it talks about how that they when you fall in love when the young couple falls in love this is this is like us and god now and they love they fall in love with one another and as they go along and begin to know one another more their hearts just begin to beat as one there says their love begins to bind them together they have confidence in one another if you really love one another really love and you know that this girl loves you and she and she knows that your love you love her you've got confidence faith in one another and you've got faith and you separate them and put one extreme south and one extreme north there's still love that beats before one another no matter where they're at they're just as true to one another as they can be because they love one another and if you love the lord not just trying to dodge hell but you love the lord then you have faith in god see if you love him he said i'm going he's talked about the the young girl marrying the man he said now he said he was a young christian and said if you happen to fall into temptation and is overcome don't stay away from home you come right on back you come right here because i'm going to be right here waiting for you and i'm going to help you pray through again until you get the victory i'm going to stay with you because when i married you i married you because i loved you and no matter what you are i still love you oh hallelujah there you are now how could a man ever do anything wrong see when somebody loves you like that amen there you are how could you trespass that confidence and when we were sinners alienated without god in the world in the muck of mud as i talked about this this morning god come to us god sought you you never sought god no man can come to me except my father draws him first and god came down in the muck where you were god did and sought you out and brought you out that ought to that ought to create a perfect love look what you was and look what you are what did that somebody that loved you can't you have faith in what he promised you then real genuine love will create a confidence in his word he caught me when i was nothing i'm still nothing but i'm in his hand he caught me when he loved he caught me and he loved me when i was unlovable he loved you and you was unlovable but he changed you amen when i was an alien from him so he so loved me till he stooped down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence and he wants that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me he's seen something in you he had a reason to save you look at the people that's unsaved today look at the millions he could have took beside you then i asked you brother sister what did he see in you himself amen he could have took others beside you but he took you amen and you didn't have anything to do with that amen look at the millions but he took you amen no one can take your place hallelujah i'm happy no one can take your place amen you're in god's economy no one can do it that's his love to you then won't your love reach right back to him and there's a love affair amen no matter what the situation is its circumstances is governed by this love amen that creates faith that god loves you and you love god and you love one another and that brings the faith perfect faith is pure and as pure as love is see and when you got perfect faith is pure that and as pure as that love is see and when you love somebody you love your husband you love your wife now there's no need of me telling you you don't because you know you do and how do i prove it by the way i live to him see i'm a true honest wife i'm a loyal honest husband that proves that i love my wife i love my husband see your life proves what you are your faith you have confidence in one another it's pure are you reading this are you reading what he's trying to say here talking about you and christ you and god they talk about husband and wife too but it's deeper than that all right see and there's something real he said your faith has confidence in one another it's pure and there's something real that you can't show it to somebody else what happened in that little room i can't explain it i can preach it i can tell you but i can't explain it to you well give us some of your oil i've got just enough for me it's an individual affair i can't give any more to you but you got to go get it where i got it amen are you with me and unless that election is on they can't get it not saying they're bad people foolish virgins not a bad person in fact they're a help to the body of christ are you with me i'm not saying who is and who isn't i'm just saying that's what they are and they'll get eternal life at the judgment did you know that the bible makes that clear amen they were virgins they were sanctified good people loved god as far as they knew to love god but they never could enter in behind that veil the only ones that's going in the rapture is those that enter in and if you're in you bet you thank the lord because he placed you there and if he placed you there you're going to live that word and if there's something standing in your way you can't stand it until it's out of the way that's the action of god and if you just don't let it be out of the way and you want to hold on to that bitterness and that thing you did back in the past want to continue with it you're not going anywhere in god because god won't have nothing before him and if you want to bow to that thing and keep bowing to it you're an idolater it's idol worship that's exactly what it is amen because anything becomes between you and that fellowship with god and breaks that fellowship and you bow to that and you bow to that and you serve that and won't do anything about it it's an idolatrous spirit well you don't realize i asked god to forgive me that long ago but you don't need that you need to go to the one you did it to and ask god and that's forgiveness i don't god knows what's needed isn't he amen but you better you can't say you're in there with him and not do that because that's not the action of the holy ghost and when you enter in that you're one with him there his life is your life you're gonna i just read it to you in the scripture you're gonna live you'll live as he lived in fact first john four haven't even got to it as he is so are we in this present world amen you read first john 4 when you get back home because because god's manifested in our flesh in our life and if god's manifested in our life there's no fear in love and if god is in you and i you're not going to be afraid to go make anything right if you know you need to do it i wouldn't let that thing stand in your way and if something standing your way from forgiving a person that has wronged you you better make that right too you bury it right now and then amen amen if you from your heart can't forgive that person how can god forgive you if you from your heart don't forgive see all right from where i don't feel like it from the heart amen amen don't just stand there reasoning with it what god said you'll do because god's in you and if god's in you it'll keep the word praise the lord do you love him amen all right so so you're a christian you have a right to any redemptive blessing that jesus died for you it's all yours it's already paid for you just have to believe it not imagine it but believe it and know it's yours and go possess it amen praise the lord amen now is his grace sufficient amen saul paul my grace is sufficient for you when love projected grace takes over it always does brother ramsay it always does how many i've lived long enough to see that it always does when you don't think it's going to happen god's right there you just keep standing with the word lord i love you i don't understand it i don't have to understand it i just know i'm i you're leading me you're guiding me i've given myself over completely to your leadership and i'm resting in you and lord as you lead me i'll follow david my grace is sufficient for you amen i believe that let's stand tonight amen his grace is sufficient for when love is projected grace takes over and what is brother branham said this about paul he said no wonder paul could stand in the face of death and say oh death where's your sting grave where's your victory through tribulations he had learned to love god suffering brings patience works tribulations to bring patience of course now patience makes love amen patience makes love the man that lives in that little room in there lives in there where the world is the curtain drops down see it's no longer darkly when you're living in there you see clearly it's a clear view amen you're not standing outside trying to see in you've gone on the inside the veil's removed amen amen all right we don't we haven't got our new bodies yet but we sure have the faith to get it there yeah are you with me see everything you say well i'm not i'm not i i don't have my body but you've got to have faith first what you pro god promised in the word you'll have it in faith first see abraham and sarah had to have a union before they could meet the son amen hallelujah and he said i would return in that time of life amen there you are amen we're just rejoicing in him so a man that lives in there has always got the victory he's in the presence of god he's always got victory nine o'clock doesn't matter to him whether church goes on that doesn't matter to him he's still anchored in christ the outside world all the things of the world is dead to him and he's hid away in god his heart has become god's throne amen let's bow our heads our heavenly father we thank you for your word we thank you for the truth [Music] how we know truth has set us free lord we're thankful for the liberty for where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty we've been liberated lord we've been set free oh god how thankful we are for your love the love being projected lord we thank you we can we can surely say lord what we've gone through and and i can look back down the pathway of my life and see everything i've gone through and even what i'm going through now lord is absolutely an opportunity given to me to project love lord let the people see lord that it's that expression we are here to express the love of god through these things lord it's not just something that happened to come by happened to fall upon our way just happened to be there no lord it was guided it was directed it was ordained it was purposed lord that you would live and you're walking right in through it within us lord you were in that ship when it was tossed you're in the ship now we thank you father for this revelation in reality lord of that living in the presence of the king we love you in jesus name we commit our lives to you and this service now into your hands and the things that have been spoken to your purpose in jesus name amen amen amen let's just sing that song well let's sing the love of god i know it's a little bit lengthy but let's sing that song for a moment o love of god how rich how pure how measureless you can help me too if you want brother amen god bless you brother jason i love you buddy with all my heart i love that boy i love every one of you if i thought i had something against anybody here i'd make it right and if i have and i've hurt you some way and i don't know it why don't you come to me and let's talk about it if you think i'm off the word let's show me amen that's only fair i want to be right and i believe that the holy ghost in me will always receive correction of the word what's the what's what'd you say how that always leaves you make a statement and then you quantify is that the word quantify that's a big word for brother david quantify you quantify it i said i'm always the holy spirit is willing and i will receive correction of the word not your thinking and the holy ghost in me will receive correction of the word amen amen how about you do you love him you have to love me then and i love you [Music] brother sister let's start looking through god's eyes of one another shall we let's start looking at god's eye through god's eyes at each other amen how's god look at you through his word amen amen where's the voice of god today where is where is the world hearing direct from god in his bride amen the bride has become the final voice under her messenger amen you can't speak something contrary to what the messenger the messenger is the holy ghost himself [Music] he used a prophet to bring the interpretation of this word to us you don't have and i don't have a right to add what i think to it if you don't understand it leave it alone let god quicken it to you because when he does he'll point it right directly into this word if you if you say what that prophet said it's going to line up with this i'm not saying the prophet was wrong he did say what this said but if you see what he said you're going to see it here amen so then it's not just our idea praise the lord but when the prophet said that scripture meant such and such how dare you try to put your thinking to it and say it means something else [Music] that's right amen we're not just following some man this is a vindicated prophet we don't have anybody got a question about that good because i take another hour preaching if you had a question about that you need to go back to step one and believe god sent a prophet amen brother i'll stop preaching all right [Music] beyond the highest stars and reaches [Music] wow [Music] [Music] is [Music] you know what brother sister you are that love projected you're the love of god himself projected you are love manifested and when you manifest that love it's being projected to others and
