the service to brother paul springs of living water are you happy sitting at the springs of living water amen i thirsted in the barren land of sin and shame and nothing satisfying there i found but to the blessed cross of christ one day i came where springs of living water did about oh i'm drinking at the springs of living water [Music] and bountiful supply [Music] i'll sweep the living water from the hill of god it makes me glad and happy all the way [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] spirits can be [Music] is [Music] [Music] amen aren't you glad it's a bountiful wonderful supply you know sometimes in life you know we just to make a little natural type i had uh just decided yesterday that i was gonna go buy me a new miter saw and uh you know we went into the store and the shelves are clean and i was just so disappointed it's like where is the supply don't they know i wanted this but you see god knows that whenever you want something he's never like sorry it's out it's back ordered i can deal with that next week next month next year it's always right there what we have to do is be the one reaching out as the song says i'm reaching out to you dear lord amen and so i just trusted each one of you today uh just bring your heart's desires the needs of your life your loved ones your circumstance whatever finances uh whatever it might be in your life just bring that and lay it before the lord have confidence that god has an answer has a supply for that amen hallelujah hey you know sometimes i don't mean to embarrass anybody sometimes i actually rejoice in the crying of our children you know why i do it means we have another generation coming hallelujah they're not an inconvenience they're a blessing hallelujah so the parents you know uh they always kind of like oh my kid why now well you know sometimes they're way more conditioned to the moving of the spirits than we are and the devil he just loves to come along and poke the little guys or whatever it might be and you know sometimes you ever noticed no wait you didn't notice you're not preaching amen i'll tell you my brother and sister you can see the devil trying to come because sometimes the preaching of the word you can just watch a wave of fidget that's right do you guys know what fidget is have you ever met him amen you can be preaching the word in a wave of fidget moves through the church my hallelujah but don't worry we've got some fidget medicine sprinkled all over the house of god amen hallelujah good to be here today amen i just have to admit i woke up this morning very early looking out the window watching it rain some of you are saying oh it's raining brother paul's over here showers of blessings are falling hallelujah amen i want to speak to you once again this morning uh maybe part two of persuasion and revelation i'd like to speak to you on the title or thought of influences and that is such a huge subject that there's just simply no way that we could ever do anything but but touch the the fringes of it uh but we would remember my brother and sister that uh for every phrase that satan could throw out at you god's got a word to match it and remember god's word was first so satan comes and influence comes and people say well i i feel this way i feel that way i don't know about this i don't know about that remember what it is is we're not reacting to the devil i want you to get this we're not reacting to the devil the devil's reacting to us amen so when you find yourself in a place where satan does something and you find yourself trying to react to that stop you have the original word you are the original word amen so you can just stop and say satan i know what you're doing right now is because of what god is doing and god's in me amen we believe that right christ in you the hope of glory amen so just stop and and just calm down and say you know what satan's just trying to counteract what it is that god is doing in me amen so you know we get caught up in the in the hurry of life you know the bustle of life uh i use the phrase the wheels fall off the wagon you see i use that in that context because for each one of us something is a little bit different and and uh so in that realm you know what what is one man's dollar is another man's ten dollars which is another man's hundred dollars which is another man's thousand dollars you see what i'm saying so our situation is not exactly the same but as sons and daughters of god our situation is exactly the same we're standing here believing the word and satan's here opposing it amen but the word came first hallelujah aren't you glad you can stand on that the word came first it is all the critics it is all of the naysayers that come after the word amen let's just stand and go into our bibles in galatians the fifth chapter this morning amen just want to continue on in this thought of persuasion and revelation uh by god's grace i thought i could just make a couple parts out of it but i think it will probably end up being a little bit more amen thank god for his grace and mercy and his word this morning stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free so the word right here saints is showing us clearly that we're free amen so all we got to do is just believe the word this morning the words declaring us to be free amen and it's telling us not to be entangled again so showing that we have already seen so each one of us no matter what's happening in our life are right now can lift a hand and say i have experienced deliverance amen you can say well brother paul yes i was raised in the church i have never really no no i want you to understand that by god's grace being raised in the church was god's plan for you but you have been set free from a bondage amen we're born in sin shaped in iniquity coming to this world amen always telling the truth isn't it amazing that our little children i'll pick on little declan i'll pick on little samuel maybe a little jackson amen we didn't have to teach them to fib about the cookie jar it just came natural yes behold i paul say unto you you know i'm sorry i hope you forgive me i do have a just feel a little joy bubbling in my heart today i'm glad i can relate in the scripture this way thank you mama for naming me paul daniel amen behold i paul say unto you that if you be circumcised christ shall profit you nothing for i testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law christ has become of no effect unto you whosoever of ye are justified by the law ye are fallen from grace though we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith for in jesus christ neither neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love amen you did run well who did hinder you that should not obey the truth this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump amen go read this whole chapter if you would please say because it all ties together but you know we only have a certain time segment to to come into but it is such a lovely lovely scripture and i'm thankful god spoke so directly to the galatians because what they didn't realize in that day is the seed being planted in the ground amen you can go through all what the prophet of god what the scripture teaches us and that seed had to go in the ground and it had to die and it started to rise again but come into the dark ages and went back in you might call it hibernation and you can find this in the natural of winter wheat that is planted in the fall and as these rains like we have right now come and to a wheat seed laying in the ground it is warm amen and that seed then swells up and starts to grow and even as it puts out anything my brother and sister when it sprouts it is alive i want you to understand that when it sprouts it is alive it is not measured its life is not measured by the its size its stature but its measured by life and as that little seed of wheat that germ starts to come it might not even make it out of the soil and the coldness of laodicea i mean of january comes and that seed can die but not if it's ordained to life and then it can set there for weeks and weeks and weeks under the frozen soil but you let another day like today come and it'll poke its head out and then it might go back below freezing again and it will just set there and you think there's no way it can live through that but you let another day that the sun shines and it grows a little bit i hope you see where i'm going it grows a little bit more but don't judge it by its stature amen it's got life in it aren't you thankful today for life amen and so as that comes it's there and it continues to grow and my brother and sister i'll just cut this short because it's not my sermon but you'll find that some that was 11th hour wheat amen still comes to maturity the harvest still includes it but there might be some more mature around it and some might say well that wheat's not very mature it doesn't matter it's got life that's what we're looking at is life hallelujah heavenly father bless the service today i pray lord guide us give us wisdom we ask in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated saints you know i want to for just a couple moments reflect back to what we were preaching on last week now my brother and sister we understand the very word of god for our day amen what god is doing now you know many people would say well this is this and that is that and you have to see this to see that i personally as time goes on i'm coming to the place that i'll just leave those things to the lord we can use the pulpit to decide who's in and who's out we can use the pulpit to decide what is right and wrong there'll be some things that with absolutely certainty right we can we can look at the word of god and say that is not right but you know what until it's over it's not over and you will see there'll be men and women who right now might stand in a position that is a little bit contrary you might say to the word of god but we don't know what god's got ordained it might be next month next week next month next year that god will come and move upon them they'll be reading their bible they will be studying and something will speak to their heart and their position can change entirely so we we want to just simply look as it is to the life that god has given and realize where the life is my brother and sister that it will bring us to the word of god to the presence of god for every seed gene right this work i have begun in you i will finish so every seed gene of god uh regardless of satan's approach to it amen that seed gene is still got the seed of life and so we look at that amen now we look at this ninth verse for just a moment we'll come back to the scriptures in just a minute but we'll look at this last scripture it says a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump and we know that leaven is yeast and and so it's there that you don't have to try to carefully sprinkle the yeast over every single drop of the bread dough or whatever it might be that you are making but you get it introduced into there and that 11 will leaven the whole lump and so we look at that and realize in a twofold fashion that this influence my brother and sister because that's what it is when leaven is introduced into the the the bread dough or into it it's an influence it's something from the outside that is causing something to change and you look at this and leaven or this influence is twofold my brother and sister there's obviously the influence to good and there's the influence to evil and i believe uh and pray that god would give us the wisdom i believe we have the wisdom to recognize the difference of these spirits to recognize the motives of men and the motives as it were of the influence of churches and and groups and authorities and we'll look at that and realize what the influence is and so as we'll look at this we realize today my brother and sister we can preach about all that's wrong in the world today we can preach about what is wrong in all of the churches today we can preach about what is wrong in the message today but we must realize that the holy spirit has come as a leaven to sons and daughters of god to influence you and i to good works amen aren't you glad of that to know that see we're not being drawn off to the side to follow a man it is there my brother and sister that is the prophet of god himself said i i didn't come to draw following to myself and that's what many people misunderstand they get the idea that that we're following william branham i'll tell you from my heart right now saints this is the truth stand before god as my witness when i share quotes with you when i read the things of brother branham i don't read that to draw attention as it were what brother branham william branham said i read those things to you because i believe they are well said and they make the point that we are coming they have a foundation i would not read a quote to you that did not have a foundation underneath it to influence you to good works in jesus christ we're not here just to say we follow the message and it's the only answer and that's what you must do because if we do my brother and sister the scripture says we're idolaters that's kind of blunt isn't it but we're not idolaters we're sons and daughters of god called of almighty god can we say amen to that i'm not here called of a man amen you know i don't mean to go this direction entirely but i want to tell you i left this message once when i was a young man i was free except for i wasn't i chose to come back there was no one telling me you must no one telling me this is what you have to do there was something inside of me compelling me to come back hallelujah did life get any easier when i came back no i'm telling you whether you're a sinner steeped in sin or whether you're a son or daughter of god under the blood of jesus christ life is hard life can be hard hallelujah full of disappointment the days are short but i'll tell you what there's a hope that is within amen you won't meet a man out here that is out here that is anything less than anointed by a satanic spirit that says i want to go meet the devil i've met a couple i can't wait to go i can't wait and i'm like what are you talking about and and he then it starts to expound like we would expound for our our hunger and thirst to be in the presence of jesus christ he was expressing the same exact expression only he wanted to go meet the devil and then you ask him a few questions and they're like i don't know i don't know i mean like do you understand that when you go meet the devil it's going to be a torment well i don't know i don't know well there's one thing i know when i get in the presence of almighty god i'm not going to be in torment i'm going to be in joy i'm going to be my heart's going to be so full i won't be able to hold still i won't be able to be quiet amen i will want to stand and praise him but my brother and sister that there's just a disconnect of this there so as satan tries to come in and he tries to leaven as it were now look my brother and sister certainly satan comes and he's still anointing his people but he would like to come into the house of god and all he's got to do is drop a little leaven amen and and when he drops at little eleven his hope is that that little leaven would then start to spread through the church and then the spirit of unbelief would start to creep up and down the aisles it would come to our children our young people it would come to our old people it would come to all the people and that's what he wants but i'll tell you what one way you want to do a deal with leaven you take 11 and you throw it in the oven amen 11 don't have 11 no more hallelujah when it gets about 350 degrees in there the effect of leaven upon that bread is finished are you with me amen so we get the power of god we get the fire of god in our midst and satan's little leaven of unbelief that he throws a little here and throws a little there the things amen that we don't understand he throws those things out and tries to make a big deal of it but i tell you what you ever get when the presence of almighty god amen you get in that presence and it will burn every little bit of leaven out of you amen it will take away but you tell you what let me just turn the table before we go on you take 11 of the holy ghost you take the leaven of a son or daughter of god that wants to live for the lord there's not something out here crying out for sin or unbelief or doubt or fear but there's something inside that's crying out i want more of god and when the holy ghost comes it magnifies that and you find yourself more and more in love with the lord you find yourself not struggling over those things of the flesh that you used to struggle over but you can stand up and say thank you lord i have found deliverance amen because it is the leaven of the word to good works amen and so as god is stirring and moving in our life my brother and sister remember that we as a leaven as a son or daughter of god can also leaven the whole lung amen we can sit here in church full of fears and doubts and whatever else questioning are we right to do i need to go be a nazarene a methodist uh uh you know or whatever episcopalian or mormon or whatever it might the devil might torment you or basically nothing at all which is a religion amen you look at that because you'll find that they worship their freedom from everything amen but you look at this my brother and sister when the holy ghost starts to work in the life of a son or daughter of god the very thing that repulses others attracts this bride amen so there she's yearning for more of god and god said whenever you seek me you draw nigh unto me i will draw nigh unto you and so when we get leavened with this leaven of the holy ghost that comes down in our heart and we say lord i want you i need more of you i want revelation father i need your spirit first to get the revelation to see who i am and when i get that spirit anointed on me amen don't you like that i love being anointed of the lord i'll tell you yesterday i was just sitting there and i don't say to boast to myself but just there i was doing a little reading and i found myself sitting in my chair just crying going oh lord this is what i want to be this is what i want to be lord amen hallelujah i've never found myself sitting in the chair crying lord i want i want to be a drunk lord i want to be a miserable man out here in the streets i want to no never sorry ain't going to happen some people want to be that i went to school with a kid really good-looking kid he said oh i tell you what i want to grow up and just wow all the girls oh well good fine you grow up and be that amen i don't know if he got his wish or not somehow i don't think so because he actually became a drunk now that might wow some girls let's see how did i get there now going back to what we spoke on last week luke the 16th chapter we see this rich man and we're not really going to preach on him but i want to make reference to him and tie him into today amen this rich man shockingly would you agree with me shockingly ends up in hell it wasn't that everybody said oh that that man is destined to go to hell no my brother and sister the scripture brother brown ties us back together history ties it back together this is a rich young ruler at the finishing chapter of his life he has now obtained wealth beyond belief he lives sumptuously he has such a beautiful estate but yet my brother and sister when jesus christ comes along and says those words to him sell all thou hast and give to the poor there was the part the very word that he had obeyed i want you to catch this the very word he had obeyed in his life was now standing in front of him telling him this is a new unwritten chapter now the apostle paul says that you add one word or take one word away you're cursed your name removed from the book of life but my brother and sister understand that god can express through human uh uh you might say human intervention god can express anything he wants to express that's why you might not find a measure of this and this and this in the bible but god would express it to you but you have to remember what the prophet of god said he said that whatever attributes are in god will be expressed in his bride now look do we know all the attributes of god do we have them defined do we have them on the page so god can come and do the supernatural in your life and you people would say whoa whoa whoa i can't find that in scripture well i'm telling my brother and sister if it leads you closer to god and then hold on to it if it takes you away from god let go of it amen if it gives you an intellectual concept of god let go of it but if it reveals god in his fullness to you take a holds of it amen don't be confined now this is going to be a statement that people will probably criticize but that's fine but don't be confined by your understanding of what you read here in the bible amen because even these scriptures right here many times have such uh uh many times as multiples of meanings and multiples of time and so we we are there saying okay this must be oh that was that was oh you know actually you see malachi 3 and 4 is a perfect example everybody's like that was for this little slot in time here that's why what you believe is wrong because that's for this slot of time and we identify it right here you did we did we told god when his word fit and didn't we told god his word is valid here but not valid here you see my brother and sister there's a warped thinking of our intellectual concept of the word of god amen god applies his word where god wants to apply his word and you understand this and let me tie this together because all these promises of god down through the years including the very type of ruth and esther and rebecca every one of them has a spiritual connotation for the day that we live in right now every one of those has an application to the day that we live in so if we start blocking out the calendar we will look at what happened in esther's life amen oh i love the story of esther i love it incredible because here's esther with a revelation that my king loves me more than he loves protocol are you with me because you see even the queen in that day had to ask permission to come into the king's presence but esther had caught a revelation of who she was amen she didn't have an official decree where she come into the foyer and held this thing out rolled it out and said you guys get out of my way no sir she come with a confidence knowing that this king loved her above even his kingdom which is proven by the fact that he said i give you even up to the half of my kingdom in other words he was splitting everything right down the middle with her praise the lord did you know you're some of the richest people on earth hallelujah you possess even to the half of the kingdom of almighty god and prophet of god said that you are of his flesh and he is of your flesh you two are one amen and so we find that there can be no bride without a bridegroom and there can't be a bridegroom without a bride and so you are a part of him and he is a part of you flesh of his flesh bone of his bone spirit of his spirit the prophet of god says you are him she is him hallelujah that ought to give us a revelation right there and look at esther oh hallelujah i love this sorry i'm getting excited excuse me esther had such a confidence she had a need she just put on oh i can only see if we could just see it in that personal context saints i can see the king standing there one evening and esther wearing her hair in a certain fashion you see she didn't body yourself up to look like all the rest of them all the rest of them is we have all this jewelry and we have all of this and we have this and we have all these perfumes and we have this and we have pardon me for putting this so we have this low cut cut dress that's really going to catch his attention and she said no no no nope i'm going to put my hair in a certain way amen i'm going to dress in this fashion right here that i'm comfortable with and you know when she come to the presence of the king and he would have looked at her now i'm going out on a limb yeah let me please and he would have looked at her that evening as they're doing supper together and he would look at her and says you are so beautiful in that dress and your hair i love your hair i love how it just flows down and and it's so beautiful and my brother and sister i can assure you he wasn't looking at her with eyes of lust he was looking at her with eyes of love and he was like i love this woman vashti was this uh she was a a picture off of a magazine she was the elegance of all of the fashion but this is a woman whose wholesome integrity has taken my heart because she is what i see and because of those words he had spoken to her in the day of her need i can see her slip on that same dress i can see her do her hair in that same fashion and when she walked into the foyer of the kingdom hall and he looked down there he's like she's so beautiful but more than the fact he's beautiful she's mine and she wasn't there i i just believe this with all my heart saints she wasn't there shaking in her shoes what if he rejects me i'll be cast out i will be of the of the of his concubines i'll be put in the farthest you know corner never to see the king again supported the rest of my life but that's not why i came here i didn't come just to live sumptuously i come because i'm in love with the king i just love that story it serves my heart so much hallelujah but see this rich man shockingly ends up in hell he's concerned that his brothers are headed down that very same path the reason he's concerned saints is because they have been influenced by the very same influences that he was influenced you see now if we are just influenced to just come to church and say we believe the message and that's sufficient some people believe that now i'm not speaking down on them i'm not trying to be derogatory to them but my brother and sister the prophet of god never laid a foundation just believe god sent a prophet and you'll be okay he come to point you and i to jesus christ amen his own word says i never come to attract you to me but to point you to christ amen so we can't come and say well okay praise the lord i'm going to be saved i believe god sent a prophet the devil believes that amen there's many uh there's many denominational people believe that amen you can go on youtube there's like a woman minister and there's others that are talking about the supernatural in william branham's life amen acknowledging it was god tommy osborne who's gone now daisy osborne god now but they talked about how tommy osborne says i was seeing god in the flesh [Applause] amen but it didn't change the course of their lives they recognized it but it didn't change the course of their lives in fact tommy osborne if you know that testimony says that he then applied what he saw in brother branham's life and tommy osborne went to gather crowds all on all the continents crowds in the tens of thousands with miraculous healings and deliverances because he saw what brother branham was doing wait oh was it what brother brown was doing no sir no he'd been copying a man if he was just doing that he saw what god was doing through brother branham and by his own words he declared i know i can get in that position to find favor with god and he applied it to his own life and found favor with god and multiple multiple millions of people attended his meetings over the course of his ministry this will sound judgmental just look at the condition they were in though when they crossed to the other side they exercised the word for their hour but it was not a life-changing word for them sounds judgmental but sometimes we have to just tell it like it is amen so you see in this my brother and sister he was concerned the rich man that his brothers are under the same exact influence and so it's it's there he wants something to change but he's then told by father abraham that um though one was raised from the dead it won't change them the influence had already taken a grip upon them you have the prophet moses and and you have the apostles and you have all of this you know you have the word you have the word and if that won't change you nothing will change you influence amen i'm telling you only way the influence of laodicea will not spoil you and i is that we get sealed away in christ i don't care you can say i believe the message for 40 years nothing going to shake me no my brother and sister when the season comes and the shaking comes if there's no ceiling amen if it's not the holy ghost locked inside of us satan will come he will shake you and i and we'll come to a place well to say well you know there's a little something over here that was said and i don't understand it's unexplainable therefore it's a deal breaker well i'll tell you what my brother and sister if you can walk away from the presence of almighty god you never were in the presence of god because a man cannot once he has known the presence of god he cannot walk away from the presence of god hallelujah now if i preach a little blunt saints just forgive me okay amen i i just it's come a season that we ought to just uh well i had a friend tell it to me this way we went and aided a place one time and the food was terrible this brother and i are sitting across the table from each other we're fellowshipping we're having a good time but plain and simple the place he chose to eat the food was terrible and we're there and he goes yeah brother paul i was kind of picking around through my food and he goes yeah that's the way i feel but he says you know and that dessert come with a meal and he goes now look at it this way brother paul enough ketchup and enough whipped cream we'll walk away saying this was pretty good come on well we're not here to put ketchup and whipped cream on our meal hallelujah we we want the lamb unadorned amen we we don't want to have to dump something on it to make it palatable amen we simply want to just be able to receive the word now i come across this quote in influence here that i just you know speaking thinking of the rich man and and his passing away and all of these things and i trust you see in this quote what i saw in this quote i many times preach funerals and i never try to say too much about that person that's passed on because there's no need of saying it the people the life the man has or the woman whatever it might be has lived will speak louder to the congregation than anything i could say about them i would never change their opinion now look i don't say this for humor but i'm going to just share a little joke to you amen come from a swedish brother and he was talking about how ollie and sven's uncle passed away and so they go to the funeral and they're sitting in there and the preacher gets up and he starts talking about their uncle and they're talking about how he was a loving man and a kind man and a sharing man and compassionate and loved his family so much and only turns to then and says i think we're at the wrong funeral you see no matter what the preacher said oli and sven knew their uncle huh i would never change their opinion their life told what they were and then we never know just what we're doing what influence what we're doing is having upon others the bible said we are written epistles read of all men that is your life reads so loud to the public until your testimony if it's contrary to your life is without any effect it's what you are inside of you that the people read not so much what you say but what you are see oh my pretty direct right oh hallelujah now look at this you can pin something on somebody and say this is that and so forth but your life being different from what they say your testimony of your life is louder than the testimony that someone could say something about you that's what you want it to be right yeah so just keep that in mind that we're bringing influences every day and the life that you live proves what's on the inside of you you cannot change that it reflects hallelujah i was just sharing with brother jason in the back room there for a minute amen some things sister jerry and i just kind of in our our studies and and talking together and sharing my brother and sister i don't want to give the cat away but we're probably going to preach on some reflections reflecting reflector because it's incredible the different things that we read and hear and study upon that my brother and sister and the prophet of god right here he says you cannot change that it reflects every person reflects outside what he is inside now look you cannot see my inside right now my brother and sister you simply or can you the truth is is the more clever we become the more revealed we are think about it well i'm not here for your money pretty soon it'd be like sister naughty how much money you got church yoda oh we're not out power but i don't want you guys going on vacation unless you ask me i'm not trying to control you but don't buy a car without permission and i've got four selected colors white white white and white no you see my brother and sister this always comes out you just watch you get into the word you study the word and then you'll find that god reveals to you just like a good quail hunter he can walk out there in all the brush and country and he can look over there and say the quail are right there and you're thinking how does that man know the quail right there well what you don't know is every time he's ever went hunting there that's where the quail were at amen so you look at this and with experience can we actually lift a hand and say thank you lord for our experience oh you say but we've had problems we have struggles you know if you knew the things that have gone through our family almost like a plague almost like a influenza almost like covid went through our family and blah blah blah thank god for it thank god for it he's schooling you amen hallelujah sister sharon i'll tell you what kind of funny in a way i'm looking at the magazine on the on the on the the board in the in the foyer there and i'm looking at that and i'm thinking why is this magazine on this board and i'm thinking somebody ought to take i don't know why this is there and finally sister jerry's like uh um that's uh sister sharon on the front of it oh hey praise the lord that's sister cher we ought to have this magazine here but if no one had ever brought my attention that was sister sharon i might have went there one day and unpinned that thing and dropped it in the trash but it was not the sister sharon i know because she doesn't come to church wearing a flat whatever they call those tap and and a gown amen same smile that's smiling right now or smiling right there it's the same deal but you see sometimes we don't recognize it until it's right there well let me put it this way to you let god be so revealed in you that no matter where you are at they recognize christ in you and you're at work you're at uh disney world or whatever you know what i'm saying just an example you're at the coast you're in the mountaintop you're in the mall say amen sisters and so it's there that you would be recognized as a daughter of god a son of god no matter where your picture got posted up hallelujah see it reflects every person reflects outside what he is inside and if we take the testimony of being christians i think that that that i think that that is one of the most solemn things that a man or a woman a boy or a girl could do would when he takes on the name of christ then he is going to be a representative of christ you should watch every move you make because somebody is watching you and in this it reflects what god has done for you inside of you amen not on the outside my brother sister i read you that quote the other day brother branham said it's not on the outside amen but let it be on the inside that we say that's right because we can make this outside conform now if you don't believe so my brother and sister i had a friend this is just an example i had a friend right out of high school i was actually supposed to go in the military with him i chickened out he went ahead and signed up and went on into the military and you know he he goes in the military he's there for four years he comes out the day they let him out his hair is high and tight i believe is what they call that you know how the military are just a little hair on top cut right out it was in six months he had hair down the middle of his back so my brother and sister what he was in the military is not what he was after so it was there as long as he was in a position he had to conform he had no problem with his short haircut but then he went out and he was expressing himself who he was he had long hair in school amen and so come now later on in life i bumped him to him a few times and he was back to looking like a man again but you look at that my brother and sister you see as long as he was conforming he had short hair but the minute was up to him he said no more i've had enough of this short hair hallelujah i think he quit wearing it long because everybody told him that he made a really cute girl i have to admit i was guilty of that my own self i would tell him brent if he wasn't a man you'd be a beautiful woman amen he didn't like that but it was the truth hallelujah amen now we look at this i want to go back to galatians here i want to go back to the first verse if we could brother alex amen i need to move right along here so now if we'll take these first words of what paul speaks to the galatians he says stand fast there in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free so we as i already kind of got ahead of myself with speaking this we understand that we have to have uh uh to to take this uh being made uh being made free being set free this liberty we had to have been in bondage at some time and so we understand that that without god we just simply would be born and would become a product of our environment amen but i believe the second half of that scripture is the real powerful side we need to see that we've already been set free amen we'll say here as i spoke to you last sunday if satan's going to hold something up he might hold up a a a paper he might hold up something and say you know this this is your sin i've got it on this page here i've got it wrote down every mistake you ever made in your life but you'll realize my brother and sister this is simply a xerox coffee he don't have your sin your sins under the blood satan can't even get to it if he wants to he's just sitting back with a stenographer and every time you send he tells them write that down so he's got a list but you see the blood of jesus christ made his list invalid amen just like you could go and have a whole list of all the passwords that are your computer and you go down and decide you know because brother uh isaac got a holds of you brother alex got a holds of you and said you know what uh your your passwords are 10 years old and they're so easy i i could break into your computer and so you're like okay and you know you sit down with a little advice and you start coming up with these asterisks and this plus signs and this thing and that thing and whatever and pretty soon you got like a 10 10 letter uh password uh that's uh you know the computer says strong that is a good one you can take your old list of passwords and give them to the devil i mean anybody you want to and they can sit down at your computer and they can enter them as many times as they want to but they can't get in hallelujah aren't you glad the password to your life is under the blood of jesus christ amen he is the key to your life and satan cannot get in there and i love that quote i'm going to misquote it severely this morning but i love that quote brother branham says if he's going to get in under the blood he would no longer be your adversary saints he would be your brother amen so just keep your life hid in christ and satan can't even get into it amen so be not entangled again so that is clearly declaring us we are free this morning hallelujah can you say amen can you rejoice down in your soul we're free this morning hallelujah but paul says you know what i say unto you if you be circumcised christ shall profit you nothing what what's happening here for i testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law you know when i was studying this out the devil come to me and said you know if you preach on that you're going to speak directly against what brother david spoke wednesday night can you believe that the devil's such a cheat shot trying to just is he's trying to put that brother david encouraging us to do the right thing not be rebels out here in this life and i was like wait just a second it is that and i'm looking that i'm looking i'm looking at and i said no devil that's not the truth that's not the truth what this is right here my brother and sister is there was those that were coming in amongst the gentile converts to christ and telling them if you're going to be a real christian if you're going to be a real christian man you're going to go get circumcised paul's coming and telling them you know what you can be obedient to the law of moses and all you're doing is binding yourself to be a debtor to the law it was not see the gentiles come not under a law dispensation but under a grace dispensation but let me tie this all in a nice little not for you my brother and sister obedience is better than sacrifice so we can say well i don't that i'm obligated to what that was i was preached my brother and sister study it out for yourself but you'll find that obedience always pays a greater dividend than sacrifice does so you look at that he says now every man that's testified he's a debtor to do the whole law circumcised i mean christ has become of no effect to you what is he meaning here if we start checking through the list i passed this one i passed this when i passed this one that's what the rich young ruler did i have done all of this since my youth but you see he become a deader then he didn't have a liberty if he just said jesus i don't understand what you're saying you're telling me to sell everything i have and i've already in this young age amassed a fortune and you're telling me to give it away but nonetheless at thy word lord nonetheless who said that mary mary anointed by a word she was there now you look at this think about this saints how many virgins when that prophecy was given 600 years i believe it was approximately time goes on how many virgins thought oh if that could be me but here's little mary it seems like she's maybe off the beaten path she's not really into that she's just living her life and when the angel comes to her and says you have found favor in the eyes of god and she is there how can this be i can't have a baby i've never known a man this boggles my mind but there was anointing there and something struck her and the angel tells her what is that this is so deep my brother and sister you have found favor oh hallelujah can somebody say thank you lord amen it's not matter we volunteered or we come in this all we're special we found favor in the sight of almighty god hallelujah and so it's there if christ becomes non-effect to us my brother and sister if we're justified we're not even in god's grace and we know that we can't live the law come on let's just be honest with ourselves we can't live the law amen says neither circumcision availeth anything or nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love amen oh i tell you that's just to me it's really deep you did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth let's tie it back together here i was like devil be quiet be quiet the true does truth doesn't have to come out preached as law the truth comes out if god says it obey it why because i love you lord i love you lord amen hallelujah it's persuasion look what's happened here a people that have been delivered called of almighty god now they're coming and someone is starting to tell them if you are going to serve god if you're going to serve god you have to do this and this and this and this and you know what happens pretty soon the joy and the liberty we have in jesus christ fades away and we go to church and we do what we do because it's expected of us that is called tradition that is called unbridled religion that is a denominational spirit that is a babylonian spirit but look at this where's this persuasion coming from i want to ask you this morning saints i don't mean to be too rough the influences on your life i want you to think about what is happening in your life what you did last week what you're planning to do this next week i want to ask you where did that persuasion come from don't frown at me don't all get pouty lipped hallelujah unless you're talking about robbing a bank or something here you've got nothing to fear amen but to recognize how influence can be so strong the persuasion can be so strong amen i've got testimonies recorded in my head bad place to store them but i've got testimonies of believers around the world of coming and making declarations to tomorrow i was going to go do this and this but i thought well i should go to church today and they got in the house of god and my brother and sister it might have been brother paul that was speaking but brother paul was clueless amen so it had to be the lord and something was said that turned the direction of that life and their plans for tomorrow have been now canceled curtailed because they know that that wasn't right and they sat there by their own words and said i realized i was under an influence and that influence was not according to the word of god hallelujah thank you lord for his holy spirit for discerning the hearts of sons and daughters of god that when we would have went and made a mistake in our life that we might have felt condemnation and been a burden on our heart for the rest of our life and god comes and says just a second i want to give you a persuasion to point you in a different direction a persuasion that would change your focus change your point of view can someone say thank you lord hallelujah hallelujah amen you see this persuasion didn't come from the one that called you and then we're back to a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump what is it influence the one who's called you isn't that beautiful it's not of him that called hallelujah that's such a beautiful thought the persuasion to just go and let laodicea have its way to be blown with every wind my brother and sister that's not the persuasion of the one that calls you amen god's got a sure calling i'll tell you i know that for sure in my life as i started to come back to the lord amen i struggled and i struggled and i struggled and i caused my wife a lot of grief my brother and sister but that voice was very persuasive and it was there it kept reminding me in many many many ways you don't belong in this world amen i go out and i would try you know to kind of fit in i kind of try and do my thing and and you know real i i don't i don't fit with these guys but then this is the sad part i come to church and i didn't feel like i fit here either ouch but you know i didn't feel like i fit here either because i had left the crumbs of those thoughts on my table yeah that's why you got to make a clean break that's when you clean house you really clean house amen you don't sit there and say well you know what i'm gonna put the bible back in my house but i'm gonna leave all the movies and music in my house no i'm sorry those crumbs will still destroy you amen you got to come and do a clean sweep in this natural house and and just clean it out and say lord now i'm just committing this house to you i'm telling you what do you got to lose that's what i've told many a man i wish they'd come and serve the lord but i've told many a man what do you really got to lose you're miserable right now even if you won't admit it and i look over at them and they're shaking their head they won't say it out loud but they're shaking their head yeah i'm miserable what do you got to lose you're not happy now why not come to the house of god and let brother paul just yell and screech at you and you can leave here not happy no difference had to kind of put these words to another person that i care about don't knock it till you've tried it i had no idea how powerful that would be because it shut him up he's never said another word about it because you see he doesn't want to give his heart to the lord but he hates his condition position in the world i wish i didn't drink i wish i didn't smoke i wish i oh i'm not happy my life is miserable well why don't you come over here and serve god oh i couldn't do that religious thing well don't knock it till you try it second peter 1 and 10 says wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall isn't that beautiful amen there's a guarantee that if we would make a sure stand for god amen that we would put ourselves in a position for god to bless us yes you've got to be in a position amen you can't have one foot in the world amen you can't be up to the knees in the world and then expect to put your toe into the word of god and god make a difference in your life amen god doesn't like those fence straddling compromising people god wants people that are sold out hallelujah hebrews 6 9-10 amen but beloved this is the scripture i love i'm speaking this to you today saints but beloved we are persuaded better things of you things that accompany salvation though we though we thus speak for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have shown toward his name and that you have ministered to the saints and do minister amen now i want you to take this i want you to tie this back to that quote i just read to you a few minutes ago now when you find yourself well i'm not a minister yes you are everywhere you go everything you say every attitude we display ouch ministers to someone praise god i haven't missed a church service in 25 years and i haven't missed an opportunity to flee someone in 25 years somehow it doesn't go together that's not the key that unlocks god's promises my brother and sister see paul speaking here he's persuaded better things oh hallelujah now look real quick we see satan's foundation matthew 4 amen i didn't have brother alex uh to put that up but matthew 4 we see the foundation for satan's temptation he's he's telling jesus now if you'll do this i'll do this if you do this i'll do this you do this i'll do this and we see satan's foundation for temptation was based in reasoning so you would come down and satan would say now if you'll bow down and worship me i'll give you the whole world right they're the very foundation when brother branham talks about god of this evil age there's a lot of critics out there that are saying well he don't know what he's talking about you know uh blah blah blah god's still in control yes he is but he gave the drama over to the devil the ultimate control is god's control but the drama has been given over to the devil and satan lucifer raises him up to the pinnacle of the temple and says you know what if you'll bow down and follow me i'll give you the whole world you see it was his to give he wasn't even lying that was a foundation reasoning but we see jesus foundation for overcoming he simply come back and said it is written amen he didn't have to reason with it he didn't have to try and justify it he didn't have to figure out well why why would the bible say this or why would um this purported prophet of god say this uh why if this is this then that is that then that means that's wrong if this is like this this would fit but it's not like that it's like this so and pretty soon people say well i just i won't even bother i won't even bother trying to serve god i'll just walk away i'll just ignore it because i don't understand what it's done you see what happened is the satans injected that little molecule that little vaccine if you would call it of unbelief of doubt of fear amen i'll tell you my brother and sister he does a good job of it amen so it's there that you see what is written you can go right back to it it's a reference you can take a hold of that right here i i i like this you know just well i won't go there but anyway uh you know i just saw a beautiful little deal a brother shared that shows the bible opened and then it's like something was wrote across the face of it you know don't take someone else's word for it read it for yourself come on saints you see we've been given ample opportunity to read it for ourselves to search the scripture amen so you look at this and realize see uh what is written i want you to think about this now we have some very intellectual people in the message right i'm talking about men that are rocket scientists kind of people people that they're sats and all these other things they just move way up there amen praise the lord when the word said i'd reveal it to people like paul why well i'm sorry maybe my calling is a farming you know some people say well paul you're so fortunate to be a farmer maybe god checked my iq beforehand said this guy can put a seed in the ground and he can water it and i'll make it grow so he's got it made but show me where god said create this big formula i also seen a deal on the internet here a while back and it was literally a screen full of figures and whatever else and it come down and then it says or you could just simply and it showed one plus one equals two god in simplicity if god said it he meant it all we have to do is believe it amen we don't have to come up with some formula to figure out how this happened how could god have possibly done this this this and this i don't know how god did it but i believe he did it amen amen i was visiting brother andrew glover the other day and he made a statement and i liked it a lot he says you know taking he's we were our conversation with such as what brother branham preached lines up with the bible so to put that in context he said yep brother branham said it i believe it let's just go on don't sit here and say now when i can figure out what happened in this vision when i can figure out what happened over here and i can figure out this when i figure out that go ahead you'll spend all your time figuring but if you get one little part of that equation wrong you're gonna have the wrong answer amen my or you can just simply believe that one plus one equals two amen now look what what is this it is written see it's almost too much to comprehend saints what has been written about you and i through the scripture our mind would not contain all of this scripture we could not repeat it we can find it over time but we could not repeat all of the scripture pertaining to you and i and the hour that we live in because part of it there's scripture that is veiled that we don't even understand applies to us in this day because we thought it was entirely for a different age so it's been just an incredible amount let me put it this way age old promises to this bride are coming to pass in this day amen and we're talking about not just new testament we're talking old testament right back to the very beginning age-old promises saints that we don't even recognize but we're spoken and they apply to you and i and they are coming to pass hallelujah that ought to make somebody really really exciting amen hallelujah now let's go right here in a time of decision eliezer when he had the assurance that the angel was going before him then he could decide to go because he had something to back him up and i think that ought to be the assurance of every man of god that preaches the gospel that he's got something positive from god that'll back up what he preaches if you haven't got it brethren it's for you god still sends his men with an angel before him when he goes to take the message to the church not only that but when elies are left the father of isaac which represented the father of christ he loaded the whole train of camels with good gifts for the bride oh hallelujah i have got a whole camel train of promises for me i thought maybe somebody jump out of their seat and say hallelujah brother paul i'm sorry but i'm the bride come on got a whole train of camels with good gifts for the bride oh i feel religious right now oh how i love jesus he loaded the camels full of good gifts to give to the bride and he never told her that they were for another generation or another day but they were for the bride the very promised word that speaks of eliezer my brother and sister applies to you and i today hallelujah rebecca esther all of them my brother and sister it applies to you and i god didn't say well that was just for her but we can take that principle we can apply it to our life and we can see the good gifts of god unfold right before us amen they were for every bride and every true servant of god that sent out has got a whole book full of divine promises that he can offer to the bride i'm so glad of that he's got gifts in there for her he will not hold any of them back he will give every one of them freely as a true servant a model servant a servant that god can put trust in he won't try to hide it back from her because he knows that she is the oncoming queen hallelujah i can't tell you saints how much it is a privilege to me amen to be able to speak the word of god to you you are the oncoming queen you are the bride of jesus christ you are that one he has called he's lifted her up he said she's so beautiful everything about her is beautiful to him he's adorned her in robes of righteousness he has called her perfect he has laid the the path before her made the rough way smooth amen he is our provider hallelujah because he anointed the word to be preached to the oncoming queen and what a privilege to be able to stand one day saints and i say this from my heart to stand before god one day and be identified with you not the other way around where you would say oh we're just so glad we're identified with our pastor no no no i'm telling you the other way around the pastor said the word says the pastor's a servant that's hallelujah here's this bride here's a little bride from nepal idaho lord and i want to be able to come along behind and say hallelujah i was part of that bride thank you lord thank you lord i was part of that bride i got a worship with her i gotta encourage her i gotta pray with her i gotta pray for her thank you lord for this opportunity oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my oh my my see we're in the time of decision saints god help us to recognize we found favor sister emmy would you come musicians we got to recognize we found favor in the eyes of god we would never have heard this word it would never have been open to us if god had not found favor with you he says he hides it from the eyes and the ears the minds of the wise and the prudent he says you know what i kept their eyes closed lest they would hear and they would see and then i would have to save them see that could easily be you and i that god said i'll just close your eyes in your ears so i don't even have to bother saving you but no we found favor and god says i'm going to open your eyes i'm going to open your ears i want you to see who you are oh this is not some cultish kind of thing like you've got to have the secret handshake and the whatever this is a revelation that if the whole world falls apart tomorrow and they don't let another church meet together you could sit in your home and say i know who i am i know who i am i know i've been called of almighty god it's not my brother and sister or some man in command but it's the holy ghost it's god himself that's bringing the word and revealing this word and making it so that we recognize how we found favor look at mary my brother and sister just a reference here again look at mary just a common girl as it were but she was on the right bloodline she was out of the house of david hallelujah she wasn't just some ramshackle girl that come out of you know the midianites or the somewhere else see god come right down continuity through his word and he come right down and said you know what continuity once again those who have placed their name on the lamb's book of life before the foundation they're the ones that will hear it and they're the ones that will see it that ought to put a joy in our heart to recognize god knew us placed us right in his own household before there ever was a world how beautiful that is things how beautiful how wonderful that is amen i'll tell you i'm going to just make this last closing statement to you press forward saints receive the word with the same inspiration god spoke it see till we get in that inspiration we won't understand that word but when you get into that anointing the same anointing that god spoke it in i'm going to tell you what my brother and sister what we need today if god would be so gracious we really need to break beyond this old carnal world we live in these old carnal feelings i'm tired this holiday weekend i need to go back to work so i can rest up hallelujah all this stuff we need to get out of that and we need to press in to get into this inspiration that come to mary when we come down you have found favor mary you have found favor in the eyes of god saints we ought to be rejoicing today not setting half half a solemn sitting here oh yeah yeah okay no don't let it be a mental thing let it be the anointing of almighty god coming down and your soul rejoicing to the idea and the answer under the inspiration of the fact that i have found favor god could have chose anyone but i have found favor in the eyes of god i found favor in the heart of god and he said i'm going to open my word to you and i am my word and because you are in my word my word is in you you are a part of me amen and we can realize we have found favor not to sit back and say oh it's so hard to believe the message no that's the devil that's the devil that's reasoning but to stand and say oh lord thank you thank you lord let me receive the word with the same anointing that you spoke it lord let it be a life changer for me let it take me from my sorrow my sadness take me from my complaint department down the hall to my praise department where i can stop and even in the midst of my battle say hallelujah i have found favor in the eyes of god i've heard his word and it's been made real to me oh hallelujah oh my my oh my i could just go on and preach a whole nother sermon there's a couple thoughts that go with this oh hallelujah [Music] those that died in the dark ages maybe in the colosseum tore apart by wild animal and the one who lived through it all in a cave in the wilderness [Music] seemed like a disparity go read your history [Music] many of those testified before they went in the colosseum [Music] i can't tell you exactly where to go to read this but i've read it there would be those that opened the gates and the lions started to come out and their hands went up and they was like oh lord thank you witnesses in the roman coliseums looking down at people that weren't looking at lions they were looking oh lord jesus we're so happy to see you oh lord and they're looking up and the lions come and tear them asunder and people are what's wrong with them i'll tell you what was wrong with them they were already making their heavenly ascent amen oh just stephen could be there and they're stoning him bludgeoning him with them rocks and he's already lifting his hands and praising god he's looking beyond the veil but let me counter that for you there were those with the same confession of faith that god ordained to carry the seed through the dark ages history already shows them also and i don't preach this with emotion saying so i just wanted to start reality of what god would choose for you and i and we submit to god's will and there were those though oh they never had to go to a colosseum they never had to look a wild animal in the face but they laid in the caves cold and in starvation but god ordained them to carry the seed through laodicea i mean through the dark ages amen brother brown says that seed had to go back to the ground again hallelujah he used them saints my i don't know saints i don't know which is better i don't know what we're anointed to i do know this the prophet of god said for it all blows up we're out of here hallelujah i'll stand on that that's what i believe in but if god chose you to stand for the rest of time [Music] i don't know which one's better go quickly at the swipe of the paw of a lion or starving freezing in a cave hidden in the backside of a desert i do know this whatever god has called me for he has equipped me for and he has anointed me for and i will do it can we just stand and give a little praise to the lord today hallelujah what is this saints this is the influence of god in you amen that you will stand the time of decision it doesn't matter what is put before you there's a time of decision says i'm gonna stand hallelujah oh hallelujah thank you lord jesus amen now this might seem a little counter-intuitive but as i was studying my brother and sister this song kept coming to me and i'm going to sing it because there's something in my heart that is reaching out for that and i believe it with all of my heart hallelujah i looked over jordan and what did i see a band of angels coming after me oh hallelujah i just thank you lord i'm not looking at leo to see any longer you know my brother and sister we can acquire a certain substance in this life did you see the quote i sent out to the church website brother brown was speaking brother ryan's talking about you being blessed materially god but talk no he's not ashamed to say you know i hope god blesses you with these things what's the greater blessing what's the greater blessing oh i tell you what if i be poor lord let me serve you if i be rich lord let me serve you hallelujah if i be healthy lord let me serve you if i be sick in body lord let me serve you if i be strong in body let me serve you if i be weak and body let me serve you just as long as i get to serve you lord that's what matters saints just so we get to serving oh hallelujah well i got up this morning and i looked over jordan what did [Music] [Music] carry me home [Music] [Music] if [Music] [Music] carry me home i looked over jordan and what did i see i'm coming for to carry me home a man [Music] you know saints if the church in her deliverance from egypt [Music] had the revelation that she thought she had [Music] catch this if she had the revelation that she thought she had when they come down to the red sea they would have never stopped moving they'd have walked right into that and god would have said that's my children and he departed that water right in front of them but god in his permissive will said okay they're going to have to learn this lesson and i'm going to destroy the egyptians you realize the egyptians had no more red sea than israel did so they'd have deliverance if they'd just walked right down in the red sea it would have opened right in front of them they'd have walked right across the egyptians were to come to the red sea and they'd had no way to have got across they'd have still been vanquished of their enemy don't stop walking saints i don't care you walk down in your red sea and it gets right up here to your nose amen you just declare it's god's word and keep walking hallelujah because god don't make no mistakes amen we got a god that's perfect in all of his ways he knows your needs he knows your heart's desire he knows what to provide for you he knows when to try you he needs to give you when he gives you a oh praise the lord when he gives you a victory when he gives you a liberty amen he knows right
