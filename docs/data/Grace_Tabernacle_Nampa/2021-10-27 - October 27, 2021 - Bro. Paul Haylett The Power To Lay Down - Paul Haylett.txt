chris has a song of christ at this time um hmm all right praise the lord bless you all i didn't double check the key so if i restart i apologize with but this song's been on my heart for a bit a lot quite a few weeks and just keep forgetting to sing it so i decided i'm just going to do it tonight a lot of you might know it but [Music] i was working in town one afternoon attending some business affairs i heard a commotion a couple streets over and wondered what's happening there a young man was running from in that direction and stopped just to catch his breath i asked him to please tell me what was the hurry he smiled up he and he said i was trying to catch the old man did he run past this way i was rushing home to tell everyone what jesus did today and the mute man was telling myself and the he's leaving to answer god's phone it's hard to believe but if you don't trust me as a blind man he saw it all as a blind man he saw it all [Music] my friend if the troubles and burdens you carry are heavy and dragging you down and you tried everything you could possibly think of but there's no relief to be found that very same jesus that altered the future of the blind man the death and the lame is still reaching out in the hour of trouble to touching and never the same be trying to catch the grip old man did here on pass this way they were rushing home to tell everyone what jesus did today and the mute man was telling myself and the deaf girl he's leaving to answer god's call it's hard to leave but if you don't trust me as a blind man he saw it all as a blind man he saw it all singing with people will you be trying to catch the grip old man did he run past this way he was rushing home to tell everyone what jesus did to take and the mute man was telling myself and the dead girl he's leaving to answer god's pawn it's hard to believe but if you don't trust me it's a blind man he saw it all as a blind man he saw it all [Music] praise the lord well as we get ready to turn the service to for the paul let's sing number 796 let me walk with you jesus man i trust this our prayer tonight [Music] i've been on the mountain with jesus and i've been in this family so lord but never one time has he failed me to him with my troubles i [Music] so let me walk with you jesus [Music] for without you i could never [Music] me when i was so lonely you found me when i [Music] he was me when no one would love me and no one did just what did [Music] jesus don't ever [Music] or without you i could never no never make heaven my home sing it again so let me walk with don't ever leave me alone or without you i could never oh never let you make heaven my home [Music] amen is that not the truth thank you lord amen no brother trevor this evening not feeling well well the devil is sure trying to throw a little sick bug out but we will just rebuke that in the name of jesus christ amen you know i was glad to hear that little announcement about brother scott not that he's sick but i was actually have wrote on my notes brother scott question mark question mark question mark and um what a lovely brother good spirit just a solid man and when someone's not in church you know there has to be something that is that is there so we just want to definitely be praying how many of you read sister sarah's testimony today amen now look saints that's the god we serve right there amen the power of prayer and uh you know just to go and not feel good and all these things and lay down and wake up and god has touched and i say thank you lord and we don't see the gram family here tonight but uh certainly just um thankful of that testimony thankful that she shared it amen that's that's encouraging when we don't just hold those things in as personal but you know lay them out so the saints can realize god's right here he's answering our prayer he's answering each one of us and thank the lord for that i want to speak to you tonight on as i'm scrolling the wrong screen i want to speak to you tonight on the power to lay down amen and we'll just stand and go into the word of god into john the 10th chapter now i was joking jerry's like giving me the naughty finger but i was laughing as i i see the chris and brother jay arranging things and i see the cord underneath the music stand and i'm like there's a disaster fixing to happen but it all worked out and i whispered in her ear and i says and that was me preparing tonight's sermon and amen it just seems like i bumped into this and stumbled over that and had to rearrange this and and so just pray for me amen i know in my heart what i'm trying to communicate but i still even now i'm just gonna have to totally rely i mean totally rely on the lord because it's like is this here is that there i started with this here but it's moved down here now and that's over here and praise the lord he's in control hallelujah let's turn john 10 verses 11 through 18 and i certainly say to anyone who's not here tonight uh god bless you and uh we just want the power of the holy spirit to move whether it's through the internet or here in church or even those who are unable to maybe uh stream or something we serve an awesome god we serve a god that knows and discerns the intents of our heart and i'll touch on that a little bit if so be the lord wills but my brother and sister we have to realize that this world we live in right now amen is entirely subject that we have a hard time we know who's in control right our god's in control but god actually yielded the control as it were of this earth now of this present kingdom he just gave it over to satan and he let satan just run rampant but and i'm jumping way ahead of my notes but remember now god put catch this god had a hedge around job and god says you know what satan i have so much confidence in this man i'm going to open this hedge and you can do everything but take his life but do you know what god did when he opened the hedge to job he put a hedge around the devil he limited what the devil could do and satan trust me he's smart enough to know that while he has free reign to to tempt and to torment and condemn and do all of these things he is smart enough to know there's a hedge around him and he is limited in what he can do isn't that beautiful i thank the lord for inspiration like that when you realize i i i just jumped about five pages here but i just can't help it my brother and sister to know that god has the same confidence in you that he had in job and that's why he's given the devil liberty to roar like a lion but when the devil gets to that certain point he looks and all he sees is the holy ghost he sees the angels of almighty god round about his people and satan knows my power is limited so that's why he resorts to such trickery because he's got to convince you that he's powerful he's got to convince you that he's in control he's got to convince you that he has dominance over you but praise the lord amen we've got to read the back of the book as they say and we realize that he's defeated he's vanquished and we are as sons and daughters of god according to the word victorious amen and i'm speaking to believers so i know i'm not going to hedge anything tonight we're in control now i don't have to define that and then explain to you no it's really god that's in control saints you know that as a believer we've been granted amen not the power but the authority and so i want to clarify that to you tonight because we're going to be talking about power but this is all in the context of what god has given to us granted to us remember esther even to the half of my kingdom we don't see esther saints if we can look back through time running to the throne every single day should we invite so-and-so over tonight should we do this should we do this should we no i gave you authority wife i gave you authority take care of the business and be good with this because you know my heart and i know your heart hallelujah it wouldn't be very good to keep you standing john 10 11-18 i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep but he that is a hireling and not the shepherd whose own sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleethe and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep the hireling fleeth because he is an hiring and careth not for the sheep i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine can we say amen to that amen not a one-sided relationship as the father knoweth me even so i the father and i lay down my life for the sheep and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it again amen no man taketh it from me i want you to catch these words let's go back to verse 17. therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life amen very very clear you might say stiff right here again saints we don't believe as it were in a works gospel write a checklist that we just check off and say okay i got that i got that i got that but the word of god in you and i will cause us to do the work of god so the work my brother and sister is what is taking place no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again this commandment have i received of my father amen heavenly father we just ask you to be with us this evening speak to our hearts we pray in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated saints now as i lay this out to you uh my brother and sister this evening we're not even going as it were to include the unbeliever in our conversation this is not that we're going to make a comparison of the believer and the unbeliever we're not going to talk about other spirits that are in the land today but the holy spirit that is in you amen we're going to talk about this word in this relationship that we have now my brother and sister there are i i will touch on the edge or fringe of this there are those people around the message who believe that the real crux or a move of the message is for us to recognize that god sent a prophet now when i say that i take that for granted i hope that you understand where i'm coming from i read malachi 4 and i believe malachi 4 so i know that the elijah will come in my day i don't have to look around any longer and see if we can find the elijah has he been vindicated did he do what the word said he would do my brother and sister i put this in a context that that is behind us that we as believers recognize when the prophet said that i come to point you to jesus christ we see that the job is done amen we're not still looking for the sign pointing us but the introduction to jesus christ has been made and um you know just drawing some things out that we study and i probably should you know put a chapter and verse as it were to them that my brother and sister the prophet of god talking about and it will be right here in scripture as we get in just a few minutes that this whole purpose of being that jesus christ come and the word being open was to redeem what was lost and he talks about the title deed he talks about those things and and so my brother and sister it's not that when the title deed got cloudy and fuzzy uh my brother and sister in the natural life we will look and you buy a home and in the world we live in today it's kind of a mandatory thing with the banks that they have to do a title search and the reason is is that they don't want you obligated in a mortgage to to come along one day and someone else knock on the door and say you're living in my house and so you know it's there that the title deed uh as it is has been researched and brought to clarity the light has been shined on it and that's why tonight it has become and i when i use this word common i don't mean that in a negative sense but it has become common to us for us to recognize that we were in christ before the foundation of the world you know why that revelation is so clear to us because we saw him go back and research the title and he himself has issued the title deed that says they are mine amen there's nothing cloudy in the title there's no second mortgage third mortgage there's no other obligation but he has complete clarity these people are my people amen as the scripture says they were once not a people but now they are a people how is that my brother and sister because the title has been researched from beginning to end and clarity has been shown upon that amen so as you look at that now as we know my brother and sister that that the very life of jesus christ is not just supposed to be manifested in you and i but it is right we're not looking for a day to come that we might actually walk talk believe and whatever like a christian but we are christians in other words we are the very christ-like of the earth the word says that they would be present but it also says that they would be in a minority and it also says that they would be despised amen i'm going to speak maybe in some strong terms tonight and maybe if someone didn't really have a good clarity they might say what is he talking about i don't agree but did you know my brother and sister as we read this scripture in john and jesus says that i have uh uh the authority the ability to lay my life down myself in other words i have come out i have made a decision i am anointed and i can lay my life down but he does remind us i can take it back up now did you know my brother and sister that we have that exact same authority tonight amen when we come in a complete submission to the word of god we are actually laying our life down in type of the word of god that we are saying lord i am coming in a complete submission to your word so i lay myself down but get this saints i also possess the power to raise it back up again now i'm not talking like i said we're not going to go into those negative sides it's not oh i can just go serve any god i want i can prove to you through the word of god that you can't serve any god you want you were called of almighty god he's put his stamp upon you you belong to him amen so it's not within our ability my brother and sister to just say well i'm just going to go become a something else over here because god called you and he placed that seed in you and that seed is so overpowering in its claim upon your life now you say but many people have walked away yes my brother and sister and i believe many of those people will return you cannot deny the worst with the ideology of i have rights then i have this and i have that it is a supernatural event my brother and sister when you come and come to the word and say i lay myself down i lay my life down to the word i completely surrender and submit to the word you are following the same anointed spirit that will come down on the flesh man jesus christ when he was there to submit himself was it easy he says no lord let this pass from me but nevertheless oh are you with me tonight saying but nevertheless lord what's more important to me is thy will be done amen now we wouldn't even have a plan of redemption if jesus at the last minute said no i'm not going through with this but you see he couldn't step back from that because it was god himself fulfilling the plan of redemption that started the whole thing and we say oh it's a wonderful calvary that redemption my brother and sister the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world go back on your title deed and see where it began amen we have my brother and sister through the act of laying our life down this submission to the word we are then by the grace of god granted the right to take our life back up again amen now the naysayer would argue and say brother paul you're you're talking like you have some authority yes i do hallelujah i've been given authority my brother and sister to bind spirits and loose spirits i've been given authority to speak the word and god honor it amen is that not what we believe amen so we've been granted this but you notice when a person has come truly under the influence of the baptism of the holy spirit there is not a selfish motive of their behavior i want to be a superior christian no you might want to submit and be all that god called you to do but it doesn't come in the mindset of me me me it's constantly us laying ourselves down but then when the word comes and the situation i'll call it of life then god grants to us my brother and sister the ability by our own voice amen not the preacher's voice not not even as it were you know to have to go find the right tape to play it at the right moment to have it be the voice but god said brother brown says you know just paraphrasing his back you will be the final voice to the final age so there's got to be authority granted to you to know the time and the place to speak amen and it's in that speaking that you are then raising the word of god we're not raising an eye or me on us we're raising the word what is it we submitted to the word and now we have the authority to lift the word back up and to put it into action oh isn't that beautiful hallelujah reminds me of a little story once family they built a house for their i think it was their father and it's a modern house and they put the garage door opener on grandpa's visor and they told them grandpa when you walk in the garage you just push this button well grandpa's not used to that he forgot all about it one day they come to the house and there's grandpa in the rain getting out of his car opening the door with the key going in the garage pulling the string raising the garage door and they're like why do you do that grandpa he says well that's what i have to do to get in the garage and they said no grandfather i hope you catch the gist of this grandfather it's within your power to reach get this now on the visor remember these little keys of the story it's within your power to reach up and release the power amen that opens that for you saints that's what god's done for us i know that's kind of a simple little story but god's given us the ability to reach up and give us the power to open the word in our life open the word in our time of need open the word when we just need an encouraging word and there's no one there in the flesh but the spirit is there you see we have that act the ability to be lifted up through submission we are lifted up and we see that in the very story of our lord jesus christ see it's not our self being lifted up remember my brother and sister now i that this will tie to a little fellowship we had uh with brother trevor and sister kerry uh that uh caused us to go uh read and and whatnot the uh sermon oneness and uh just tremendous my brothers and sisters sometimes how something will speak to you and you know it is not my brother and sister that this flesh is also important you know that the prophet of god says this flesh is just a byproduct it's just a complete separate almost disposable thing oh but that soul oh but that's all can somebody say hallelujah oh but that soul come from the very spirit of god from the very beginning not a byproduct out of adam but the original spirit of almighty god is what resides in you and i tonight hallelujah you talk about an original word in original life amen not a you know change for the age kind of a spirit but the very spirit of god has come down amen the spirit of christ in us now as we look at this in scriptural signs of the times and certainly i think this is a time of the world of history that we want to be looking at the scriptural signs for the times in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and the word discerns the thoughts now i don't mean to make a great reference but we just were fellowshipping around this the other night people say i came to church brother paul and the very scripture that you read i've been reading the very thing you spoke on was conversation that we were having boy brother paul must be awesome huh no sir this is a promise of the word that he would discern the very intents of our hearts and so you see it's god that's speaking back it's not a man it's the holy ghost confirming to you what i spoke to you here what you saw here he's just coming back giving the reassurance that was my word that's the truth that's it you're you're on the right track see so the word discerns the thoughts and when we spend our time my brother and sister thinking and our thoughts and our words and our voice is upon our lord jesus christ then he's there discerning that and what is he saying oh look at that they're talking about me now we share this little term i hope you kind of can catch the you might say humor i put in it but every one of you don't even bother to deny it you don't even know what i'm talking about and you're like what don't even deny it every one of us likes to hear a good word spoken about ourself come on even the most backwards whatever when somebody you maybe just hear it was out in the foyer or a fellowship you know and it might be as simple as somebody's like oh they make such good this or such that they're so sweet they just you know always encourage these little words come on saints we like that imagine now we're created in the image of our father and in that you can draw this direct correlation that when we as sons and daughters of god are walking through life giving praise talking about the glory of god his kindness his love his grace his mercy he is their attentive they are thinking about me they're speaking of me amen look i think we can make a a connection to those two brothers walking to the road to emmaus speaking of him is what actually draw him to them hallelujah see is the word in the prophets it was the word i'm going to slow down here it was the word in the prophets i think we can all just say praise the lord it's a word in the prophet and you can get just around the message a hundred percent amen out of it's the word in the prophets it was a word in the sun people just fall down on their face and say that you are messed up and you think too highly of yourself when you start talking about it's the word in me it's jesus christ in me today that has given me the authority given you the authority to bind devils and to lose the holy spirit within your own life within your family within the household within the body of christ that word has given you the authority amen see the word it's prophesied promised although you find many impersonations now isn't this sad that the imperson sometimes impersonation sometimes can shake people so much you know what i don't want to be a i hope you i feel good tonight okay saints just forgive me if i'm a little but when i was in school kids don't listen to me this is what you don't want to be when i was in school i figured out exactly the percentage it took to pass the class and i did no more than that sad isn't it i can get through this class on a 64. and i did a 65. but i want you to look at this these impersonations are offering options to get through the class with the least submission with the least surrender with the least giving over help us lord that's right we don't want to just pass the class saints i know that that's not how the kingdom of heaven is saints but you know if you got there and saint peter said and paul you made it ah praise the lord on a d minus minus there's nothing about that saints i shared this tonight from my heart how it struck me through the years in my own metamorphosis in my own life i used to even speak it out of my lips if i can just crawl over the threshold into heaven i'll be happy but you see something happened in my life along the way that i realized god did not call for me just to submit just enough to crawl over the threshold but god said i have placed in you an ability to stand up and manifest my word and not only if we were putting in that not only pass but to pass with the a a a plus plus plus you know i went to school with a girl her name was vicky i think he was smart that he had no common sense but it don't matter they don't grade you on common sense in school and i just remember at the end of our junior year all things being done i knew vicki and vicki is like i don't understand she goes up to vice principal i don't understand and he's like what understand vicky how come my report card it's very common now but it wasn't back then says that i actually had a 104 percent 104 well when you only have 65 percent 104 percent doesn't mean much the saints you see we're not called to come into a day to submit ourselves into that half-hearted non-committed position as sons and daughters of god amen i hope this makes sense to you see the word it's prophesied it's promised although you'll find many implications don't let the impersonation draw you to the side we have the original we have the word mini carnal competition now i take the prophet's words they're very serious because when you look around amongst these different doctrines it seems as though there's a competition well i tell you saints now i hope you understand me tonight i love every one of you so much so much i just makes my bones hurt but this is not a competition if god told you move all i could say is god bless you we don't start creating a a scenario where you you think you're gonna backslide or you're gonna fake no this is not a competition we our part for the season that god called us and if the season is 10 months 10 years or decades it is up to the lord where he places his sheep because i read you the scripture where he says i have many folds but i bring them under one shepherd oh my that sure takes it out of man's control right there and i can say thank you lord that doesn't take away from it from the real there is a real holy ghost a real god amen i don't care how many disappointments you face at the end of ministers or churches you keep that in your heart there's a real holy ghost there's a real god and it's the devil that wants us to lower our standard and our view from the heavenly back to the carnal and then judge god by the carnal that's the devil's fashion right there amen hallelujah very simple things my brother and sister but we're going to just expose the devil and just remind him he's got a hedge around him he knows that he doesn't like the idea amen that he has a hedge around himself praise the lord now i want to just take this right out of here we have found him come and see can anyone say amen to that hallelujah now look then he's here and look as it is i lord you guys forgive me lord forgive me sometimes i maybe almost mockingly say i cherry pick this that's just because i have hurt feelings a people whose excuse for rejecting what you have taken out of the message is to say you cherry-picked that like i could have cherry-picked the previous 50 quotes and the following 50 quotes but there would still be some kind of cherry picking and um you know i could just pick the quotes where he talks about spit the pits out and i could read it verbatim week after week after week and people wouldn't like it because they don't want to spit the pits out they want to keep the pits where two or three are gathered no matter how small a group can i make another confession to y'all time of my life pastor in the church we were very small and i was like oh lord if we just had some more believers if we just had some more people and the lord's answered my prayer i used to pray all the time lord bring children there's the life of a church right there saints bring children lord bring cheryl i was like lord oh if we could just maybe have a church like this many people i'm gonna name that number so you can't use it against me this many people lorne but you know what happened to metamorphosis has taken place in my life lord i'll settle for this little little group of real believers i don't need a church full i don't need all of this i just want to go to church i want a fellowship i want to live life in the presence of real believers even if that is a small number two or three i'll be in their midst what anything they ask shall receive it are you following me now saints why i'm choosing this quote we have the anointing of almighty god to lay it down now comes our time to raise it up now comes our time that we say lord this is the desire of our heart and sometimes we think that's only brother brown makes reference about uh in in other quotes in places about healing and people say yep that has to do with healing but did you know that could be as simple as something as it were be a necessity in our life and i just want to ask you right now has god answered any prayers for you lately amen has god come and moved on the things that we would say well this really has no great spiritual bearing but it was on your heart it was a desire of your heart now my brother and sister were not the ones that are saying oh lord i i like a house lord i like it on miami on the beach and it needs an olympic pool and a tennis court and it needs to be 10 000 square feet see that's not the believer but we get hindered to say lord am i carnal if i ask for these things but look how god moves because he's removing the carnality out of the heart of the true believer and so now these things and i don't mean them to imply uh in a certain fashion but it is my example amen we're here lord i need a place to live i need this i need that lord wheels are falling off the car lord i need a car you can do this and if we're not careful satan anoints us in a level that we think we're being carnal but you see the word says ask anything am i stepping out onto thin ice saints because you see god knows the heart of the person who's asking he knows the desire of that individual what anything they ask shall receive it now that's either right or it's wrong in other words there's no gray area in the middle of this saints we either believe that we can ask and god will grant or we don't jesus said if you abide in me and my word in you you can ask what you will it'll be done to you whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe uh believe you receive it that's but watch the order of the word now you believe now you receive amen isn't it amazing how god always puts that little caveat in there puts that little you know part in there so we can't come to church and just say oh praise god the word says no we have to believe we have to believe we can't just put a sub-standard and let me tie this back to why i brought in the report card we can't believe we're going to graduate high school unless we act we can say we graduated we can say we should have graduated and when we don't graduate we should we can say they should have graduated me and that is what's happened in the christian world saints so many people have failed to lay their life down to the word but they still want god to raise it up no come on we have to have what brother branham preached we have to have a complete surrender complete submission that's right brother david so if you abide in me so you see we can't be that rebellious wife and expect the husband to be happy right and my word in you so this is oh my there's so many quote saints i don't want to get distracted off in that but so many places where the prophet of god talks about the word in you means god in you not just phraseology here this is not just just some you know pattern of words that is made to emphasize but this is the literal life amen so you believe that now watch the order see how he lays this out i believe it's very important we catch that watch the order of the word brother branham's laying this out now in an order so you believe then you receive do you know my brother and sister many times let me just put this as in the caveat of i believe it like this many times blessings healings deliverances are literally at our fingertips and we fail not the word we fail to take the next step to receive it see he can't do nothing for you you'll see right here my brother and sister what the next step is he can't do nothing for you until you first you believe it somebody read it to me and say what does this mean we got got to open our mouth we've got to make a declaration we've got to we've got to declare amen what happens holy spirit's moving in our midst and we're standing here waiting for it to happen anticipation waiting for it to happen amen let it come from our lips it's from the fruit of our lips that we praise god amen brother brown says let me let that soak real deep see it's a time my brother and sister that as sons and daughters of god here again i make this we don't go running out saying okay lord you're going to give me a big house you're going to give me a mercedes you're going to give me a yacht you're going to do all my brothers and sisters all contrary to the spirit all contrary to the word of god but for us to come and say lord you look at the sparrow and you know my needs you know my life lord this is my heart the answer to the prayer might not come looking like you thought but it will come so we look at this what we're laying our lives down my brother and sister is not submission to men to a denomination to whatever we're laying our lives down in submission to the word and you know how hard that can be now i'm just going to speak frankly people have certain certain situations in their life and they look into the word of god and the word of god speaks back very frankly to them very direct to them and then we have this choice i submit to the word or we start to craft and i've said it jokingly in the church here and i've said it seriously in the church here but my brother and sister we're all justified some of us are justified by the word and some of us are justified by our own reasoning but we will craft it i can remember a time if i could put myself on the ladder as it were remember a time there was a situation took place and some interaction with a brother this many years ago and you know i kind of felt like i you know this is so hard saints sound like i have a head this big i was right but my spirit wasn't and because i was right i felt like i needed to let him know in no uncertain terms how right i was and then the lord the very next service minister speaking brought me up in front of the church and whipped me no that's how i felt um and i felt like i should just go make that right with that brother but do you know that every day that went by i justified the reason i didn't need to more and more and more until god had to send another minister to preach a very similar service as the previous visiting minister and i felt like at that time i better just shut up and do what the lord wanted me to do and you know i went and i apologized and he apologized to me and we wrapped our arms around each other and walked away with no no nothing and he says paul my wife says you ever heard that one my wife says i should have done that like three weeks ago and i'm like three weeks ago is the same sunday god dealt with my heart but you see what happens we start to justify our reason and so we don't submit to the moving of the holy spirit we start building our case our defense or i can stand up and say well i did what i did because they did what they did and they said this and they said no no when god deals with a heart submit just lay it down lord if you want me to say i'm sorry then lord i i will go and apologize amen so we want to my brother and sister follow this in the word in such a fashion see that we lay ourselves down in submission not as i said to the church to some preachers but to the word to the holy spirit there's where we lay ourselves down in submission and so it's only through that act of laying it down that it sets the stage for the manifestation of the word god answers prayer when our heart condemns us not then we have confidence in god you see god's not going to batter us into that saints but he wants us to come to the place a heart that is completely submitted into the word is free it's delivered it's got liberty amen it's got confidence we can then look at the word of god and say praise the lord this word that is being spoken i'm reading i'm hearing is for me and it is effective it is real it is alive and so through that we then set the stage for the manifestation of the word in our life in other words saints at that point we can speak the words that starts raising it back up isn't that amazing how in submission we can come with such authority because you see this is the perfect plan of god why because it's in the very plan that god laid out before us in the life of our lord jesus christ the very works that he did the word says that we would do those same kind of works and so we're all looking for a supernatural healing over here in a supernatural discernment over here but what about the same works that it did is the work of submission we're going to do that same work that he did and it might be not something that makes him you look so spiritual doesn't make you look so whatever but it is simply you following in that same nature that anointed our lord jesus christ to go to calvary for us is laying our life down under that same anointing that can be raised up again hallelujah and then to have authority with the word amen we set the stage get this i want to drive this home to you now i'm preaching to mature christians tonight okay it's not me there is no good thing in me the scripture says and i say amen to that but it is god working in us is the good thing amen so what happens the holy ghost in you and i sets the stage for you and i to come to a place where just we see this testimony of our sister sarah did you notice what her testimony really was i didn't get invited to pray for her come on follow me saints sister sarah never reached out brother paul i don't feel good pray for me but there were some believers there was some christians there were some people that had authority before the throne of god and their prayers reached right out she lays down with a fever feeling very sick low oxygen whatever i i don't remember the order she puts that in in a couple hours prayers going to the throne prayers going to the throne prayers going to the throne and with authority of the word raises her up that saints is what makes a body of believers defensible against the onslaught of the devil because there is submitted people we're not here trying to see who is the most impressive family in our church we're here to be submitted to god to give him full rule and reign in our lives and in turn he comes back and says i give you authority to bind these spirits i give you authority to claim healing in the name of jesus christ deliverance in the name of jesus christ i give you the authority to lead your families amen and for your children to see this is not just a game this is real this is life and the supernatural power of god can be anointed upon us not from our birth joking with my son-in-law today with brother isaac for just a moment they come to get the kids and little ewan had a fever all day and kids just not feeling good i was joking with brother isaac and i said i just wonder why i wasn't born with the last name rothschild yeah there's a reason i've got a home in glory land that outshines them all i've got a home in glory land hallelujah amen see my brother and sister there's a reason i'm happy my last name ain't roth's child because if there is no ross tiles on the lamb's book of life i wouldn't want to be rich in this world for no reason amen now look let me hurry along you know every time i tell sister jerry i ain't got much to preach she just was like don't say that please don't say that john 12 and 21 amen the same came therefore to philip which was of the sata of galilee desired him saying sir we would see jesus philip cometh and televander and again andrew and philip tell jesus and jesus answered them saying the hour has come that the son of man should be glorified and you know that scripture and be fulfilled right here in grace tabernacle tonight verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fallen to the ground and diet abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it into life eternal let me interpret that scripture for you right there he that was willing to lay his life down in submission amen is that pretty pretty simple isn't it now you wonder sometimes what supernatural gifts god might give to you let me tell you tonight supernatural gift he's given to you is to conquer this flesh that is a supernatural gift of almighty god a supernatural anointing upon you is to crucify the flesh in the day that we live in if any man serve me let him follow me and where i am there shall also my servant be and if any man serve me him will my father honor now is my soul troubled and what shall i say father save me from this hour here it is jesus speaking save me from this hour save me from the circumstances but for this cause come i until this hour and i don't want to draw this out tonight saints but god didn't just accidentally place you in laodicea god didn't accident just accidentally place you in the in the time that we live he knows who you are and he knows that while he loosed that hedge around you he also knows the hedge he placed around the devil and as much as the devil would like to bust out he can't do it no more get this no more than he could bust in otherwise he wouldn't have been speaking and saying huh you've got a hedge around him look this hedge my brother and sister is a hedge that the devil can't penetrate and now when the devil realizes that you know that he's actually hedged in he likes you to believe hey god open the heads on you buddy lord why'd you do that to me well one he's got confidence but two the devil's actually kind of nervous i hope you like this i hope you know a little humor tonight doesn't bother you amen when they put ropes around the boxing ring or in this modern day brutal beat each other to bloody mess whatever they call that fighting now think about it are you with me the devil's actually locked into this life with you we too often think about lord we got to get the devil away from us have a little sympathy for the devil tonight saints he's locked in the ring the hedge with you and that means this roaring lion will come out of their beat to a pulp and ready to be done dealing with you ready to say i'll just leave them alone because an anointed son or daughter of god oh will cower saints i'll just be honest i've cowered can someone say amen i have coward but by god's grace and mercy i'm coming to the place that it's like satan you're defeated you might as well submit i'm going to submit good then just be beaten by the word just be pummeled by the word now i've got to hurry got to hurry we were gonna be out and gone and i was gonna take you to dairy queen see people stood there stood by and okay let me find my place here for this cause come on to this hour father glorify thy name then come there a voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and will glorify it again the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered and others said an angel spake to him and jesus answered and said get this saints jesus answered and said wrong scripture there 19 no one of i on i'm on 12. i'm sorry brother mason did i mess this up 12 and 30 is where we're looking jesus answered and said come on saints 12 and 30. i want you to read this for yourself some said it thunder and some said an angel spayed but jesus words were directed right to you and i this voice came not because of me but because of you that's how much authority god wanted to come he was speaking out to you this word that has come forth is not just so i can prove that i'm god but this word come for you amen jesus had no doubt what he could do to the devil but he wants you to catch the revelation of what you can do by laying your life down the whole world's built on this idea of lift ourselves up lift ourselves up dealing with a salesman a few days ago and i i wasn't sure if he was selling himself to me or selling a product to me and i did this and i this and i this and i was like yeah let's talk about this here i'm not concerned about you you see my brother and sister the voice didn't come but for you you know this is a direct correlation back to malachi behold i send you elijah the prophet a direct correlation comes back because god loves us so much my brother and sister that he's provided everything necessary amen now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out but i kind of got a feeling and i don't say the smoking i say it from my heart the devil will be ready to be done with you before it's all over because you see one thing he can't stand is the word and as you become the word you realize that the word is the only thing that matters now i want to hurry through all of this so i'll skip over some things it might be a quote coming up but we'll kind of hurry through this my brother and sister when the devil come to jesus he had all authority he could have left hooked the devil right out of existence but he wanted to set an example because you see if jesus could do that and we know we can't we wouldn't even try so what did our lord jesus do he submitted himself to the word he kept going back to the word and the devil says look i'll give all of this brother branham in this quote i'm sure i have it here in the sermon i cut a bunch of mountain i'm pretty sure i am and he mentions the u.s but you see he offered him all of that jesus didn't say how you bum there ain't no way no he didn't argue with him he just said the word says isn't that so beautiful we can come right down in the day right here and no by submission to the word god then grants the authority of the word to you and i and when the devil comes in and starts to say this will be this way and this will be this weakness the word says the word says sorry devil but the word says now look let me hurry and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me not everyone my brother and sister now this people i've heard theologians interpret this that god's going to have this supernatural uh move and the whole earth is going to come and worship him and no my brother and sister this actually is a select group of people that have already lifted him out of the earth they've took him from the base things of life took him from an idol that they worship as a statue in their church or an image that is in their mind and had the relationship and took it to life brought it in fruition to life oh my oh my oh my you know we sing that song lift up the name of jesus you realize how important that is my brother and sister now let me hurry john 19 and 10 then saith pilate unto him speaketh thou not unto me know us thou not that i have power to crucify and have power to release thee now look where jesus response is he is fulfilling the word of god i hope you catch the saints he's fulfilling the word of god and when we are fulfilling the word of god there is no other power in control of us think about it no other power that's why the prophet of god tells us if you're the will of god and things happen i'm paraphrasing it god has an obligation to correct that if you're out of the will of god then you have to get back in the will of god for god to move on your behalf see so here we have this now they've got no power at all we stay in the word we stay under the blood amen the devil's in the ring with us but that doesn't mean he's vanquishing us it doesn't mean he's in control just because he's locked inside that hedge amen jesus answer says thou couldest have no power at all imagine that must have been just hard for a pilot to swallow that i'm sorry sir i don't think the lord jesus would have been rude but you have no power oh man that'd just wrinkle wouldn't it man who's just flexed his authority his muscles is i have power over you you have no power come on let the devil and pilot be in the same boat tonight i have power over you you have no power no power i'm walking in the will of god i've lifted my soul up to him i've given myself an entirety and you have no power now i already spoke on job so we can kind of skip over that but it's very clear saints let me just put this on job very clear who was in charge job driven right down i read it to you out of psalms david saying my soul was driven right to the earth to the dirt but oh my god shall raise me up the devil's there i've got job gotcha i've got you yes go ahead just give up and the holy ghost comes starts to deal with us isn't this beautiful i thank god i don't know how much that means to you but i tell you what i have days that that absolutely is just a miraculous revelation amen can i have just a minute or two i want to do i'd like to just finish this up here how this quote it's beautiful and uh jesus said when he how many believe he was gone in the flesh let's see your hands we all believe that sure he was and when he was here on earth he had all the powers of god yeah this is that quote the powers of god was in him do you believe that he was a godhead bodily the fullness of the godhead bodily the bible said god was in christ reconciling the world to himself is that right jesus said it's not me that doeth the works now how many can identify that it's not me i recognize that boy if it was paul we would have a train wreck it's not me thank you lord it's not me that doeth the work it's my father dwelleth in me he doeth the works and when he met the devil yes i love this thank you lord that i concluded this amen he had every power that god's got was right in him now come on saints if you don't believe that you've got every power that god's got you are now limiting god now some people say you're twisting words you're twisting words but the scripture says that this is the time the season of the full manifestation revelation of jesus christ every power that is in god is in you now people say then why don't we there's a lot of little factors that come in there otherwise as i heard a brother preach once he said i preached on a sunday morning i was driving to work and the traffic was backed up and they were cutting me off and i was just getting more and more upset and he said i looked over there and my son had left his little dashboard and he said i looked over there and i normally as annoyed by that and i picked that thing up and had it in my lap and a car cut me off and i pushed the button and two missiles went out and i heard boom and they were gone and then something spoke to me and says and that's what you would be if i wasn't in you hallelujah i was like preach it brother [Laughter] and i don't even go on the freeway very often it's not me that doeth the works as my father dwelleth in me he doeth the works and when he met the devil he had every power that god's got was right in him but he never used one of them you talk about what's going to happen saints god's put power in you god's given authority to you amen you understand what i mean about power in you amen power to withstand an authority but god's working in us a character but he never used one of them he said satan said if that question mark the word of god's right if thou be the son of god do a miracle let me see you do a miracle hmm he still says the same thing right people talked about injuring that man wasn't that in eustis texas will hurt this little girl you healer same devil same devil they need you to prove god i'm sorry i've already proved god i'm proving god by my life day by day i don't need to perform some sign he still says the same thing if thou be the son of god command these stones to be turned to bread and eat because you're hungry you have need of it see and jesus said never said now i have power to overcome you see never said it he said it's written full submission saints to the word of god leads us to the place our final defense is not ourself it's right here in the word amen amen it's written man shall not live by bread alone the father's word see but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god satan took him up to the pinnacle and said if thou be the son of god jesus said it is written he take him up onto a mountain showed him all the kingdoms of the world united states and all oh man i mean why couldn't he named i say this tongue-in-cheek why couldn't he have named russia why couldn't he name china i hope you catch the humor of that but he's preaching a message as it is to us right here they're all mine jesus know that they were his see brother brown doesn't change us around say oh now explain this all how this can be no no they were the devils this right now my brother and sister is the devil and we've got satan's ambassadors working all over the place to fulfill satan's will said i do with him whatever i want to you can see what he's doing with him just whatever he wants to see we see that right now coming to pass he said they're mine and i give them everyone to you if you fall down and worship me jesus knew in the millennium he was going to fall heir to it anyhow so he said it is written i shall worship the lord thy god and him only so thou serve get thee hints satan is that right he defeated satan with let me just he defeated satan with submission to the father's word you see when we don't resort back to emotion or intellect or reasoning but we just submit to the word amen are you with me tonight saints he defeated satan on the father's words is that right bringing it to show that the weakest this is why i had to read this quote to show that the weakest of christians can defeat satan on thus saith the lord out of the word of god no matter what you feel what you think thus saith the lord it is written now look what the bible said jesus said whatsoever luke 11 24 whatsoever things see how he's now made a loop around and this is one thing i loved about this because we're coming right back in this loop again whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe you receive it is that right then it is written isn't it then i pray then i ask god to heal me i have a legitimate reason i want to preach this his gospel i want to live for him i ask him to heal me then i believe i'm healed just go on and act like it and god does the work that settles it it'll do it for you brother it'll do it for you sister it'll do it for you it'll do it for you it'll do it for you it'll do it for every one of you amen there's our position saints there's the only position we can take is that full submission to the word of god and once again i have my own motives for asking this but i just want you to make your own declaration has god answered your prayers lately he has come around and he will do it again and again and again and again and the devil's over here telling you don't ask for that that's to puny don't do this don't do that he said whatever you would ask from your heart amen let me wrap this around we have lifted our heart soul to the lord jesus christ and it's went through the purifying fire this is not a carnal heart this is not a worldly heart this is not a wicked heart this is a godly heart and whatever you would ask from that godly heart god hears you and he answers that prayer sometimes a little different than our old carnal mind thought it would be but my god is an answering god my god is an awesome god can we say amen to that tonight amen sister ruth will you come oh my oh my oh my oh my i'm gonna love eternity saints because i'm sure learning to not like clocks amen let's just stand and sing a song or two amen i'd really like to sing that song the more that i surrender amen isn't that the truth the more that i surrender not the more i learned not the
