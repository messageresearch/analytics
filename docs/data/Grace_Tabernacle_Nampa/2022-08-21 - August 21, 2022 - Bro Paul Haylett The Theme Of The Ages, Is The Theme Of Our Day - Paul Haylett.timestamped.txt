[28:28] waters some through
[28:31] the flood
[28:33] some through
[28:34] the fire
[28:36] but all through
[28:38] the blood
[28:40] some through great sorrow but god gives
[28:46] a song
[28:48] in the night season
[28:51] and all the day long
[28:56] sometimes on the mount where the sun
[29:01] shines so bright god leads his dear
[29:05] children along
[29:10] sometimes in the valley in darkness of
[29:16] night god leads his dear children along
[29:24] some
[29:29] [Music]
[29:34] but all through the blood
[29:38] some through great sorrow
[29:41] but god gives a song
[29:45] in the night season

[31:15] [Music]
[31:31] through great sorrow

[31:37] in the night season
[31:40] and all the day long
[31:45] hallelujah amen how many have been
[31:47] through the water lately amen amen
[31:51] you know the water
[31:53] is always what's necessary to create the
[31:55] flood
[31:56] but did you know if you'll go back and
[31:58] study through this scripture
[32:01] god has always used water
[32:05] coming out of egypt the very
[32:07] first challenge
[32:09] israel had
[32:10] was water
[32:14] but the deliverance
[32:16] and also the test
[32:18] in the middle of the wilderness
[32:21] you know if we could have picked any
[32:23] other name saints for the age we live in
[32:26] we are definitely traveling through the
[32:27] wilderness of sin
[32:31] and in the middle of the wilderness of
[32:32] sin
[32:33] a test
[32:35] that judged moses unfortunately
[32:37] had to do with water
[32:39] and a deliverance to the people was the
[32:42] very water that brought the test
[32:45] to moses
[32:48] floods are necessary
[32:50] the waters are necessary
[32:52] and water represents also spirit
[32:55] amen
[32:56] and we need to
[32:58] get in the water
[33:00] of the word the water of the presence of
[33:02] almighty god
[33:04] amen well i might not mention it but i
[33:06] have to say that
[33:09] uh this song
[33:10] uh just goes right along let's just
[33:12] stand and let's just dive into the word
[33:15] this morning just have quite a bit i
[33:17] want to
[33:18] share with you
[33:20] and um
[33:21] you know i you kind of read things
[33:24] sometimes and it spurs little thoughts
[33:26] in your mind and
[33:28] amen
[33:29] uh
[33:30] actually don't preach very long saints i
[33:32] know some of you think i'm a long-winded
[33:33] preacher but i really don't preach that
[33:35] long
[33:36] it's the unzipping of the word that
[33:38] takes so much time
[33:40] what i actually give to you is very
[33:42] condensed it's just the unzipping amen
[33:45] and you know your computer people all
[33:47] know what a zip file is you don't slip
[33:49] it in push the button and pull it back
[33:51] out you have to leave it for a while and
[33:53] so anyway i want to speak to you this
[33:56] morning on our position of strength once
[33:58] again because you see through the
[34:00] scripture
[34:01] there is many things our position of
[34:03] strength is not just one given thing
[34:05] that we can step into that position and
[34:07] say now i've got strength but there's
[34:10] many things that make up uh our position
[34:13] amen and i want to speak to you on a
[34:15] thought today the theme of the ages is
[34:18] the theme of our day and uh so as we'll
[34:21] just dive into this i would like for you
[34:23] to turn
[34:24] in the book of revelation to the second
[34:27] chapter and it will only take you a
[34:30] minute to catch uh the thought that we
[34:33] are are carrying forward as we
[34:35] go through this today
[34:38] now as we look at this
[34:40] these are several on the same page here
[34:44] we'll start in revelations the second
[34:46] chapter verse 11.
[34:48] now we know that this is
[34:50] in this scripture
[34:52] giving us the breakdown
[34:54] of the spirit and condition
[34:57] of the seven church ages
[34:59] and
[35:00] our young people having
[35:02] gone through the seven church ages i
[35:04] hope this rings very clear to them
[35:06] starting with revelations the second
[35:08] chapter verse 11
[35:10] he that hath an ear
[35:12] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[35:14] the churches he
[35:16] that overcometh shall not be hurt of the
[35:20] second death
[35:22] amen i'm telling you gives us motivation
[35:25] my brother and sister because the second
[35:27] death is spiritual death
[35:29] so it gives us motivation to be an
[35:31] overcomer
[35:32] amen let's turn down the page a little
[35:35] bit to revelations the second chapter
[35:38] verse 17.
[35:40] now we started off right there in the
[35:42] smyrnan church age now we're going to go
[35:45] into pergamus
[35:46] and we're going to find a continuity he
[35:49] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[35:51] spirit saith unto the churches
[35:54] to him that overcometh will i give to
[35:57] eat of the hidden manna and will give
[35:59] him a white stone and in a stone a new
[36:02] name written which no man knoweth saving
[36:05] he
[36:06] that receiveth it
[36:08] now people have turned this my brother
[36:11] and sister into a great mystery whole
[36:13] doctrines concerning the white stone
[36:16] and by god's grace maybe we'll be able
[36:18] to dig into that in another day to
[36:21] realize the outer simplicity of what it
[36:24] is to be there of what the white stone
[36:27] is and the new name now my brother and
[36:30] sister we could say oh this is too
[36:32] mysterious we can do without it well
[36:35] that might be fine but by god's grace we
[36:37] can come in and we can see what the
[36:39] prophet of god said and the
[36:40] corresponding scriptures that tie with
[36:42] that that touch these things that we
[36:45] won't set here in an ooh and in awe and
[36:47] walk away saying that's above my head
[36:49] you're the bride of christ can we say
[36:51] amen amen and he said that the mystery
[36:54] would be revealed
[36:56] so this is the bridegroom coming not
[37:00] bringing a secret into the marriage but
[37:03] the bride wants to know who her
[37:06] bridegroom is
[37:09] amen she doesn't just say well it's fine
[37:11] i want to be a christian
[37:13] she wants to know him
[37:15] and in fact that desire to know him
[37:18] causes her to move above and beyond what
[37:21] the rest of the world even has desire to
[37:24] participate in
[37:26] amen so now we've touched pergamos we'll
[37:29] go to thytyra
[37:31] and we'll see here in verse 26
[37:34] and he that overcometh
[37:36] and keepeth my works unto the end
[37:40] to him will i give power
[37:43] over the nations
[37:45] now we want to continue on in the third
[37:47] chapter
[37:48] verse 5
[37:50] now as we look at this
[37:53] we'll look at this my brother and sister
[37:55] as it is
[37:57] that sardis
[38:00] each age had its very peculiar things
[38:02] that took place
[38:04] and in that we'll find that every one of
[38:07] them
[38:09] will will have a significant impact
[38:11] because you see this seventh age
[38:14] is a collection of the spirits
[38:17] of all the ages
[38:19] the catch-all you might say of the
[38:21] spirits of all the ages
[38:24] but it's also
[38:25] the catch-hall
[38:27] of the revelation
[38:29] of jesus christ our day so sardis was a
[38:33] time
[38:35] that it was their
[38:38] start of a great struggle
[38:42] this is a time that
[38:45] dark ages
[38:47] the spirit of the antichrist is gaining
[38:49] momentum gaining more and more control
[38:52] moving forward
[38:54] he says he that overcometh the same
[38:56] shall be clothed in white
[38:58] raiment and we understand
[39:01] what happens when people turn away from
[39:03] the word of god
[39:05] god said i will blot their name out
[39:09] and he says and i will not blot out his
[39:11] name out of the book of life
[39:14] so something was there that was keeping
[39:16] these people
[39:18] in the good will if you had put it that
[39:19] way of god
[39:22] they had no fear
[39:25] of being blotted out of the book
[39:27] a trying time you know i just read
[39:29] yesterday
[39:30] the prophet of god somebody wrote him a
[39:33] question
[39:34] but i failed god so many times
[39:37] and the prophet of god i'll just
[39:39] paraphrase it to you he says if you are
[39:41] a son or daughter of god without seed in
[39:43] you you cannot fail god too many times
[39:47] i'll tell you what that just makes me
[39:49] really happy
[39:50] no we're not looking to just go live any
[39:53] all kind of life but somehow things just
[39:55] come face to face with you
[40:00] but i will confess his name before my
[40:03] father and before
[40:05] his angels
[40:09] he that overcometh
[40:12] verse 12 said he
[40:14] that overcometh here dealing with the
[40:16] philadelphian church age
[40:18] an age of enlightenment
[40:21] an opening of the word
[40:24] he says he that overcometh will i make a
[40:26] pillar
[40:27] in the temple of my god
[40:29] and he shall go no more out and i will
[40:31] write upon him the name of my god in the
[40:34] name of the city of my god which is new
[40:37] jerusalem
[40:38] which cometh down out of heaven from my
[40:40] god and i will write upon him
[40:43] my new name
[40:44] and once again people have taken that
[40:46] and
[40:47] made a doctrine
[40:50] that if you don't know what your new
[40:52] name is
[40:53] you're not really saved
[40:56] but my brother and sister
[40:57] now is not the time to delve into it
[41:00] once again though
[41:01] can we say we serve a god
[41:04] of simplicity
[41:10] not a god of complexity
[41:13] you know one time just trying to drive a
[41:15] point home
[41:17] speaking to the church some of you might
[41:19] remember
[41:20] i said now brother branham preached in
[41:22] the sermon god in complexity
[41:26] and i said that just trying to drive a
[41:27] point home but some of you are like
[41:32] and then you're like
[41:33] no
[41:35] see it's not a god of complexity it's a
[41:38] god of simplicity
[41:40] a god of simplicity that saves little
[41:42] girls
[41:43] like our sister vanessa
[41:45] saves those
[41:46] that are ready to cross over to the
[41:49] other side remember
[41:50] on the curtain beyond the curtain that
[41:53] little old lady holy spirit speaks to
[41:55] brother branham
[41:56] she got saved in her 90s
[41:58] but there she is on the other side in
[42:00] the vitality of youth
[42:03] oh i think i can serve a god
[42:05] amen that cares about me no matter where
[42:07] i'm at what age or my circumstance
[42:11] and now in laodicea verse 21 he said to
[42:14] him that overcometh
[42:16] will i grant to sit with me in my throne
[42:20] even as i also
[42:22] overcame and am set down with my father
[42:25] in his in his throne
[42:28] heavenly father we thank you just ask
[42:30] your father open your word to us this
[42:32] morning
[42:33] lord just thinking of my brother jason's
[42:35] prayer in the back father
[42:37] how he prayed that
[42:39] lord you would even open my eyes as i
[42:41] speak these words this morning to see
[42:43] more than i thought i saw
[42:45] to seek speak more lord than than our
[42:48] studies or what our ideas have been and
[42:51] father i fully grasp that lord let our
[42:54] eyes be opened let our hearts be opened
[42:56] this morning lord
[42:58] father we want to receive you father not
[43:01] in portion but in the fullness of who
[43:03] you are
[43:04] father we come not as just a church but
[43:07] we come as your bride and we come today
[43:10] to be partakers of your word
[43:13] now lord reveal to us and speak to us we
[43:15] ask in the precious name of jesus christ
[43:19] amen you may be seated saints
[43:32] as we look today
[43:36] we see that being an overcomer or
[43:38] overcometh a common theme throughout the
[43:41] new testament
[43:42] now it is there my brother and sister
[43:44] that um we'll recognize that the
[43:47] overcomer uh in this hour
[43:50] scripture declares that
[43:52] the overcomer will see
[43:54] who jesus christ is they'll see him in
[43:57] his fullness see him in his power in his
[44:00] majesty and we know by the word of god
[44:02] that we will not be able to declare
[44:05] jesus the christ without the holy ghost
[44:08] and i say thank you lord that we could
[44:10] today declare jesus the christ amen it's
[44:13] not just a historical although we'll
[44:16] have a quote here
[44:17] in a little bit lord willing that kind
[44:19] of touches on that but
[44:21] this common theme now sometimes my
[44:24] brother and sister we we like to follow
[44:28] or catch the theme or the continuity of
[44:30] something that is preached and you'll
[44:32] see sometimes as you go down through the
[44:35] sermons that brother branham preached
[44:37] you'll find a continuity that carries
[44:40] one to the next and so it does pay as it
[44:43] were to follow that theme or follow that
[44:46] continuity
[44:47] because it's being built upon and so we
[44:50] often times you know see that uh we have
[44:53] maybe little distractions visiting
[44:55] ministers etc as as a minister i i like
[44:59] to be able to follow a continuity for
[45:02] for you know a certain period of time i
[45:05] heard a brother recently say no sermon
[45:07] is a single sermon in its own they're
[45:09] always connected there's always
[45:12] something that's tying it all together
[45:14] now uh we know that uh to overcome
[45:18] i i use these words here out of webster
[45:22] online
[45:23] to overcome overcometh is to win
[45:27] to conquer defeat
[45:29] or take control so as you look at that
[45:33] as we'll take my brother and sister back
[45:35] through all of these scriptures here in
[45:38] revelation i want you to apply those
[45:40] thoughts
[45:41] in other words of seven church ages god
[45:44] declared there was always a winner
[45:46] aren't you glad today we've been
[45:48] declared by the word of god to be
[45:50] winners
[45:51] amen and in that it's also there's
[45:54] conquerors now it's hard sometimes for
[45:56] people to grasp that you realize in the
[45:59] whole time of uh the roman empire uh
[46:02] christians being persecuted and uh being
[46:05] put to death uh throw to the lions
[46:08] throat from cliffs all of the things
[46:10] won't get into all of that uh sometimes
[46:12] it just kind of makes you shiver just a
[46:14] little bit to think about that and
[46:16] imagine in the minds of those roman
[46:19] leaders
[46:22] that they actually were the ones
[46:23] defeated
[46:26] the spirit of antichrist anti-god that
[46:29] was in them
[46:31] they thought they were the conquerors
[46:33] they thought they were the the the
[46:35] overcomer as it were the mighty men but
[46:38] in reality they had been conquered
[46:42] they had been defeated
[46:44] as you'll see as it was you know
[46:47] when the magi were coming and we see
[46:50] that spirit imagine it's the same spirit
[46:52] today only today they call it abortion
[46:57] and that day herod sent out to kill all
[47:00] of the children because there will be a
[47:02] seed somewhere a child somewhere that
[47:06] would serve god i'm speaking of our day
[47:09] and this anointing in the day that we
[47:11] live in is the same devil that was there
[47:15] in israel at the time of the coming of
[47:17] christ
[47:18] and so it's there wanting to kill every
[47:21] seed
[47:22] that they can kill but what they don't
[47:23] realize is god's ordained the seed to
[47:26] life and they are not capable of killing
[47:30] the seed can i hear an amen about that
[47:33] amen satan's tried to kill the seed in
[47:35] you he's tried to defeat you believing
[47:38] by defeating you he can do away with the
[47:41] seed but my brother and sister we are
[47:43] winners
[47:44] we're conquerors we have defeated our
[47:47] foe and we have taken control and you
[47:50] say but brother paul i still have
[47:52] troubles no you're here fighting that is
[47:55] a part of the flood the water that you
[47:58] must call to push through the things
[48:01] that you are called to overcome but you
[48:03] see we are not defeated until we have
[48:06] quit
[48:13] a synonym
[48:15] of conquer is to vanquish
[48:20] to defeat completely in war
[48:23] a battle
[48:25] to overcome in battle
[48:27] subdue
[48:29] completely
[48:31] to defeat in a conflict or a contest
[48:35] to gain mastery
[48:37] over
[48:38] i like this
[48:40] an emotion
[48:42] a passion
[48:44] a temptation
[48:48] you see my brother and sister it didn't
[48:49] save i got saved and now i instantly did
[48:51] this you will have to conquer the
[48:55] passion
[48:57] you will have to conquer the emotion
[49:01] you will have to conquer the temptation
[49:06] but god already declared us more than
[49:08] conquerors
[49:09] he already declared us victorious
[49:12] amen i want you to catch that my brother
[49:14] and sister
[49:15] oh it ought to just stir our heart to
[49:17] realize that when jesus on the cross
[49:20] said it is finished that he laid the
[49:22] groundwork that you and i can look to
[49:24] that and say regardless of what is my
[49:27] present circumstance now my brother and
[49:29] sister i think it's the very nature of
[49:31] humanity we wouldn't today want to have
[49:34] our thoughts or uh what's troubling us
[49:37] uh put upon the screen it would be
[49:39] embarrassing it would shame us we we
[49:42] would be uncomfortable or beyond that we
[49:44] would just simply shrivel up
[49:50] but god said
[49:51] you've already defeated that
[49:54] god already said that's un that's behind
[49:56] you
[49:57] you've conquered this
[50:00] and so we would be there in the realm of
[50:02] our own mind the troubles that we go
[50:04] through the thoughts that go through
[50:05] your mind in the middle of the night
[50:07] maybe the devil having anointed you to
[50:10] be troubled over a child might be
[50:12] troubled over a circumstance but what we
[50:14] got to do is rise up and say satan get
[50:17] behind me because i'm already conquering
[50:20] that
[50:22] and the devil will come and say i don't
[50:24] see it but the devil never did see
[50:26] revelation
[50:30] our victory is revelation my brother and
[50:32] sister
[50:34] because if you go by reality there's not
[50:36] too many victorious amongst us if we're
[50:39] willing to admit it
[50:41] but by revelation
[50:43] we can look to this and say you know
[50:45] what what bound me
[50:47] almost in complete control years ago
[50:50] oh the devil's still back scratching at
[50:52] the door
[50:54] you know sister nadia not throwing you
[50:56] under the bus but
[51:00] sister nadia gave us a cat a kitten
[51:02] years ago and it
[51:03] it's not sister nadia's fault
[51:07] but somehow our cat was anointed
[51:10] to climb to heavenly places
[51:13] whether it be the curtains the furniture
[51:15] the door jamb
[51:16] our cat liked being up there just a
[51:19] little higher than all the rest
[51:22] my brother and sister the cat's not
[51:24] cured
[51:26] the cat's not cured
[51:29] something in that cat likes to climb
[51:32] and you know
[51:34] cats are interesting
[51:36] the cat as you hear something and open
[51:38] the front door
[51:40] and the cat's looking you right in the
[51:41] eyes
[51:43] i actually had a moment of fear
[51:48] what does this cat desire to do to me
[51:53] does it want to scratch me
[51:56] or was it just getting up to my level so
[51:58] it could express its defiance
[52:03] i don't know come around our house
[52:04] almost every door jam on the exterior of
[52:06] our house has been marked
[52:09] by the cat
[52:11] you know you see it in the mountains
[52:13] written on a rock bob was here
[52:16] that's our cat
[52:19] that's what the devil's trying to do in
[52:21] our lives he's trying to leave that mark
[52:23] that says i was here
[52:29] hmm
[52:30] i'm glad god's not taking this flesh
[52:33] i'm glad that we can come
[52:36] enter in into this spirit of peace
[52:38] enter into his presence and all the cat
[52:41] scratch
[52:43] will
[52:44] get covered up
[52:47] no
[52:48] god leaves some of these things in her
[52:50] life
[52:51] as a reminder
[52:54] of what not to do and where not to go
[52:58] you know what it's hard to say thank you
[52:59] lord that we can remember the things
[53:01] we've done those things we were ashamed
[53:03] to have put on the screen
[53:06] but thank you lord that it reminds me of
[53:08] where i am not going to go back to
[53:11] i have found victory now my brother and
[53:14] sister we're not speaking of us of
[53:16] ourself but we're speaking of the grace
[53:19] of god and we will touch on that amen so
[53:23] we look at this a synonym of of vanquish
[53:26] vanquish is connected to conquer
[53:30] amen
[53:31] and conquer my brother and sister is not
[53:34] a half-hearted effort this is not a
[53:37] partial deliverance this is not a
[53:39] partial liberty amen the scripture says
[53:43] he who is free is free indeed can we say
[53:47] that together he who is free is free
[53:51] indeed amen not in a partiality not in
[53:55] just a symbolism not in a little bit my
[53:58] brother and sister but a complete
[54:00] liberty we ought to claim that this
[54:02] morning if the devil's tormenting you
[54:04] over something today i would ask you in
[54:06] your heart or even with a lifted hand to
[54:09] say lord i am free
[54:12] am i am not just here hoping it's not a
[54:15] vision of something way off in the far
[54:18] far horizon but i'm standing here today
[54:21] by the word to declare it is finished in
[54:24] my life i've been set free and i'm going
[54:27] to take what you've given me lord and
[54:29] i'm going to build upon that
[54:31] come on saints we weren't called to pack
[54:33] a shovel with us
[54:35] you say what's that got to do what's i
[54:37] got to do brother paul packing a shovel
[54:39] because some are anointed to bury their
[54:41] talent
[54:44] hey that that's actually a really good
[54:45] point isn't it brother jason
[54:48] some of you actually have
[54:49] some of you actually have talents
[54:54] come on be bold
[54:56] i wasn't thinking of talent that way
[54:58] i was thinking of the gift of god
[55:01] we bury it
[55:03] you know i don't want anybody at school
[55:05] young people you're in school
[55:08] i am ashamed to admit
[55:11] i did most everything i could do not to
[55:13] look too religious
[55:15] in school
[55:17] get on the school bus with my hair
[55:19] combed back
[55:22] see you mom
[55:24] get on the bus
[55:26] sit down
[55:28] stop sign comes in the door closes
[55:34] shirt come untucked
[55:36] pants oh this is not new
[55:39] pants pulled down
[55:41] get off the bus at school
[55:47] i'd be cool
[55:50] on the bus ride home
[55:52] turned on our road
[56:01] come on
[56:03] come on
[56:05] that's not a vanquished enemy
[56:07] at best that's a truce
[56:13] until that spirit overcome me and then i
[56:15] didn't care what my parents thought
[56:20] fight them over a haircut
[56:23] fight them over the way i wore my
[56:24] clothes
[56:26] spirit of
[56:28] rebellion boy i would to god that i'd
[56:31] had a revelation of that day to uprooted
[56:34] that spirit
[56:35] when it first got on me
[56:38] uprooted that when it still had no
[56:40] control over my life
[56:45] interesting
[56:46] you've got to be 60 years old in my case
[56:48] to understand fully the value of being a
[56:51] conqueror
[56:53] amen
[56:54] now hebrews 4
[56:57] and one
[56:59] we got
[57:00] a break in the same chapter
[57:02] chapter four
[57:04] one and two says let us therefore fear
[57:07] lest a promise being left us of entering
[57:10] into his rest any of you should seem to
[57:13] come short of it
[57:14] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[57:17] well as unto them
[57:19] but the word preached did not profit
[57:21] them
[57:22] not being mixed with faith in them that
[57:24] heard it so they heard the word of god
[57:27] and found no prophet in it my brother
[57:29] and sister but i would like to present
[57:32] to you today that we should put
[57:34] ourselves as it would be as sons and
[57:36] daughters of god in a position to profit
[57:39] from hearing the word of god
[57:41] not simply to come to church because
[57:43] parents make us do that not simply just
[57:46] doing this because it's convenient or it
[57:49] seems to be expedient but let us do this
[57:53] in the sense my brother and sister that
[57:55] for personal profit
[57:59] come on that almost sounds like you have
[58:01] a motive i do have a motive my brother
[58:03] and sister do you realize everyone has a
[58:06] motive you sitting here this morning
[58:08] have a motive
[58:10] but what are you going to do with this
[58:12] word is it going to come to you with no
[58:16] profit or is it going to be profitable
[58:19] to you and to be profitable you have to
[58:21] mix it with faith now it never gave us
[58:24] the amount of faith you have to have to
[58:26] mix it with it
[58:28] come on i want you to think about that
[58:29] how many of you say well if i was going
[58:31] to pray for healing for someone or
[58:34] deliverance for someone i must have a
[58:37] great great degree of faith for a prayer
[58:40] to be answered my brother and sister no
[58:42] what you got to do is take your burden
[58:45] and your desire what god has laid on
[58:47] your heart mix it with what faith you
[58:50] have and put it forth to the throne of
[58:52] almighty god don't wait until you feel
[58:55] like you are spiritually superior and up
[58:58] on the mountaintop for some of you that
[59:00] means you wouldn't plan on having a
[59:01] prayer answered sometimes for years
[59:05] come on let's be let's be honest
[59:09] brother donny reagan put it this way one
[59:11] time he said mothers
[59:13] with all the little babies
[59:15] spend a good portion of their early life
[59:17] backslid
[59:20] sounds like an indictment doesn't it
[59:22] but he said you notice every time that
[59:24] the word gets real intense the babies
[59:26] start to cry
[59:30] it's the devil drawing a mother's
[59:31] attention from the word
[59:33] to deal with a baby
[59:36] of course then brother donnie also said
[59:37] and you mothers who pinch your baby when
[59:39] the word starts coming
[59:46] now look at this
[59:48] let's jump down to verse 14 seeing then
[59:50] that we have
[59:51] a great high priest
[59:54] that is passed into the heavens jesus
[59:56] the son of god
[59:57] let us hold fast our profession
[1:00:00] for we have not a high priest which
[1:00:03] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[1:00:04] our infirmities
[1:00:06] see that's the spirit the devil's
[1:00:07] throwing on the earth today that god's
[1:00:09] this impassive grandfather sitting in
[1:00:12] the heavens somewhere that doesn't care
[1:00:14] and so if i i'm not going to serve a god
[1:00:16] like that well my brother and sister i
[1:00:18] happen to know that my god hears my
[1:00:20] prayers and he sees my infirmities can
[1:00:23] someone say amen to that amen so it's
[1:00:26] there we're going to hold fast our
[1:00:28] profession because just because we think
[1:00:30] god is absent i didn't say he was absent
[1:00:32] we think he is
[1:00:34] amen and he doesn't really care about
[1:00:36] our infirmities the devil will come down
[1:00:38] but you know sometimes we ought to be
[1:00:40] careful well we'll go praying well this
[1:00:42] is happening to brothers so and so
[1:00:44] sister so and so this family right here
[1:00:46] and we go to praying for their
[1:00:48] deliverance not realizing that god's
[1:00:50] allowed them to come into that position
[1:00:53] to move them
[1:00:55] you've heard me many times say this you
[1:00:57] know we're singing uh i shall not be
[1:00:59] moves many of you are in your heart
[1:01:02] singing this from the depths of your
[1:01:04] heart the devil's not going to move me
[1:01:05] off the word but then there's that one
[1:01:07] with the spirit of rebellion he's also
[1:01:09] singing i shall not be moved amen and no
[1:01:11] matter what is preached and what
[1:01:13] anointing flows through the building
[1:01:14] they're there they're not going to be
[1:01:16] moved they like their attitude they like
[1:01:18] their life they don't want nothing
[1:01:20] changed and it's there you wonder why
[1:01:22] are they here
[1:01:26] i used to believe that
[1:01:29] surely god had an exemption when it
[1:01:31] comes to three kinds of believers
[1:01:35] i was determined in my mind that grace
[1:01:37] tabernacle was free of that spirit
[1:01:42] but you see those spirits come and go
[1:01:45] and i'm not talking about as where
[1:01:46] individuals come and go
[1:01:48] but the spirit itself coming in
[1:01:52] that we can come now i hope you don't
[1:01:54] struggle over this
[1:01:55] but we can come to church
[1:01:58] we i'm talking about you and i are we
[1:02:00] here
[1:02:01] you and i are here
[1:02:03] and we can come to church with the
[1:02:04] spirit of an unbeliever
[1:02:08] and we can come to church and we want to
[1:02:10] call it pitchfork religion
[1:02:12] i would like to get norman rockwell to
[1:02:14] paint that picture
[1:02:18] imagine coming to the front row
[1:02:22] it's not for me
[1:02:25] are you ready gabriella
[1:02:27] amen
[1:02:29] it's not for me today
[1:02:31] i know this must be for gabriella
[1:02:36] so i'm just going to gather up
[1:02:39] gather up
[1:02:48] but did you realize
[1:02:50] those of you who used a pitchfork
[1:02:52] extensively
[1:02:54] a little bit is lost
[1:02:56] along the way
[1:02:58] so even in pitchfork religion
[1:03:02] there's the portion that we can't pass
[1:03:05] along
[1:03:06] oh i pray lord don't let us get even
[1:03:09] pitchfork religion just give me the full
[1:03:11] word
[1:03:12] give me the life of this give me give me
[1:03:14] a spirit lord of repentance
[1:03:17] and so we have a high priest that that
[1:03:19] feels our infirmities but was in all
[1:03:22] points tempted like as we are
[1:03:26] yet without sin we can read that
[1:03:28] we can hear that preach you know our
[1:03:30] lord jesus was tempted what's wrong with
[1:03:32] you
[1:03:34] my brother and sister he planned it that
[1:03:37] way
[1:03:39] he said i am going to overcome
[1:03:42] not as an overcomer to condemn you but
[1:03:45] in life to show you it is possible
[1:03:50] it is there that you are able to take a
[1:03:52] hold of this word
[1:03:54] live this word believe this word profess
[1:03:57] this word
[1:03:58] and it will move you now look this whole
[1:04:01] thing of being perfect my brother and
[1:04:04] sister do you realize god is moving us
[1:04:06] by the word into perfection but this
[1:04:08] flesh there's no promise in the word
[1:04:12] that this flesh will be perfected
[1:04:14] god's not dealing in the flesh
[1:04:17] if he was oh no one be offended please
[1:04:21] if he was dealing in the flesh
[1:04:24] most of us wouldn't pass the flesh test
[1:04:29] we're not smart enough we're not good
[1:04:30] looking enough we're not slim and trim
[1:04:32] or athletic or this or that enough
[1:04:36] god didn't do a flesh test
[1:04:39] what he said is i'll plant this in your
[1:04:40] heart and you give this now saints you
[1:04:44] will bring the flesh under subjection to
[1:04:48] the word it will be you that decides
[1:04:51] what you do with this flesh it will not
[1:04:54] be as it were the church or a great
[1:04:56] minister not even a prophet but it will
[1:04:58] be you allowing the word to come to life
[1:05:01] and bring forth a conquering power in
[1:05:04] our own life what did the prophet say he
[1:05:07] said you create the atmosphere i will
[1:05:10] paraphrase this that you live in
[1:05:13] nobody else does
[1:05:16] well the preacher he said this and it
[1:05:18] just made me angry
[1:05:20] no you made you angry
[1:05:24] now it might be the preacher made you
[1:05:25] angry if he come down off the deal and
[1:05:27] slapped you
[1:05:29] some people say well i think it's
[1:05:30] obvious that they were preaching to me
[1:05:33] yeah well you know what my brother and
[1:05:34] sister i don't care if the preacher's
[1:05:36] standing on your toes and you would be
[1:05:38] there it's up to you to decide what am i
[1:05:41] going to do with this word do i repent
[1:05:43] from this word do i say forgive me lord
[1:05:46] do i get angry do i get bitter what do i
[1:05:50] do and no one will decide that but you
[1:05:56] oh hallelujah
[1:05:58] help me lord
[1:06:08] verse 16 let us therefore come boldly
[1:06:11] unto the throne of grace that we may
[1:06:13] obtain mercy
[1:06:15] and find grace to help
[1:06:17] in time of need
[1:06:20] now i just want to
[1:06:22] bring to you just reference out of the
[1:06:24] sermon elijah brother brown preached
[1:06:26] this in 10 18 53 just making a reference
[1:06:29] he says oh father dear such a tremendous
[1:06:32] time we're living in the greatest time
[1:06:34] of all the ages
[1:06:37] i want you to think about as saints
[1:06:39] we're not living in the dismal of times
[1:06:41] you can look at this we can talk about
[1:06:43] the devil talk about how much power the
[1:06:45] devil has in our life how we are not
[1:06:47] able i just can't seem to live i can't
[1:06:50] live this life i'm a teenager it's too
[1:06:53] hard i'm a young adult it's too hard i'm
[1:06:56] young married whatever it's too hard no
[1:06:59] my brother and sister you see we are
[1:07:01] living in a tremendous time the greatest
[1:07:03] time of all the ages
[1:07:05] so don't let satan come and rob you with
[1:07:07] the idea that we're not up to the day
[1:07:10] we're living in it it is there clearly
[1:07:14] clearly placed before us that we can do
[1:07:17] this in our lord jesus he overcome
[1:07:21] by suffering
[1:07:23] we like to skip that part don't we
[1:07:26] and our lord jesus he was just an
[1:07:28] overcomer he come to conquer the devil
[1:07:30] but you realize he suffered along the
[1:07:32] way there
[1:07:34] that that body
[1:07:36] was man that body was flesh my brother
[1:07:38] and sister that body suffered
[1:07:45] reminds me of
[1:07:49] a brother in the message
[1:07:52] i mentioned something to him
[1:07:59] see how the flesh can be
[1:08:01] acclimatized
[1:08:03] i was talking to this brother and i said
[1:08:05] brother you ought to come and preach for
[1:08:06] us
[1:08:07] he said brother paul i'll come and
[1:08:08] preach for you and a heartbeat of course
[1:08:10] he let me know his schedule was pretty
[1:08:12] full for this year he said i come and
[1:08:14] preach free in a heartbeat just as long
[1:08:16] as it's hot when i get there
[1:08:18] i'm standing there looking him in the
[1:08:20] face with sweat dripping off my nose and
[1:08:22] thinking
[1:08:23] why would anyone like hot
[1:08:28] i think i'm going to invent a shoulder
[1:08:30] mounted air conditioner
[1:08:33] you know has its own little duck
[1:08:35] blowing on your head
[1:08:38] but you see
[1:08:39] i'm there
[1:08:41] suffering in the heat
[1:08:44] and he's thinking about what it would be
[1:08:46] like if it's cold suffering
[1:08:48] he wants heat
[1:08:50] i would prefer as it would be not ice
[1:08:52] cold but colder because the reason i say
[1:08:55] that is he said well i don't do well in
[1:08:57] anything below 60 degrees
[1:09:00] and i thought 60 degrees is perfect
[1:09:04] yeah
[1:09:06] i didn't get a single amen
[1:09:12] we're living in the greatest of all the
[1:09:13] ages
[1:09:15] how the prophets would have longed to
[1:09:17] have seen our day
[1:09:18] the announcing of the coming of jesus
[1:09:22] amen
[1:09:23] look at this
[1:09:25] my brother and sister now you would ask
[1:09:27] brother paul how can i overcome
[1:09:30] well as we look at these seven church
[1:09:32] ages
[1:09:33] each one declaring what the reward was
[1:09:36] of the overcomer and and it seems to be
[1:09:38] a challenge in our day that we have my
[1:09:40] brother and sister and and you know our
[1:09:42] real challenge is not to keep sin out of
[1:09:45] the church
[1:09:46] we can come here as i've said to you
[1:09:48] before we could put you know uh uh
[1:09:51] embolden our deegan to put a measuring
[1:09:54] device where you know measure your heel
[1:09:56] measure the length of your skirt the
[1:09:58] sleeves the this and the that and and
[1:10:01] you do all that my brother and sister we
[1:10:03] we can come and and
[1:10:05] implement you might say a legalistic
[1:10:07] form of keeping sin out of the church
[1:10:10] but sin is not in the shoe sin is not in
[1:10:14] this skirt sin is not in the sleeve sin
[1:10:17] is not in the cutting off of hair that
[1:10:19] is not sin the prophet of god showed us
[1:10:21] those are all attributes
[1:10:24] so how are we going to do are we going
[1:10:25] to have a heart scan
[1:10:28] a spirit skin
[1:10:30] what we need is the holy ghost in the
[1:10:32] church
[1:10:33] what we need is holy ghost on fire in
[1:10:35] our lives and these things will leave
[1:10:38] our life we don't have to come out and
[1:10:40] hammer and embarrass and shame and do
[1:10:42] this i say lord help us get more of the
[1:10:45] spirit get the fire of god in the church
[1:10:48] and the sin will not reside there
[1:10:52] whether it be young people or old people
[1:10:55] or whatever it is amen and we say how
[1:10:58] can we overcome i want to ask you do any
[1:11:01] of you does the devil throw things in
[1:11:02] your way and you seem to stumble over
[1:11:04] them you don't feel like an overcomer at
[1:11:06] that moment do you
[1:11:08] amen but god's given us an ability he
[1:11:11] declared already we're victorious we're
[1:11:14] the conquerors we're the winners so what
[1:11:16] are we going to do we're not going to
[1:11:18] look at the circumstance we're going to
[1:11:20] look at the promise
[1:11:22] brother branham said that god is bigger
[1:11:24] than his promise oh my brother and
[1:11:27] sister you look at that if i have a
[1:11:29] promise i received from the lord then i
[1:11:32] don't have to worry about that coming to
[1:11:34] pass he says that i will come in the
[1:11:37] time when satan would come in the flood
[1:11:39] i'll raise up a standard for you i will
[1:11:42] raise that up that you might overcome
[1:11:44] this my brother and sister do you
[1:11:46] realize what god is doing he is showing
[1:11:49] us how to be overcomers he didn't say
[1:11:52] i'm going to come and babysit you into
[1:11:54] an overcoming position i'm not going to
[1:11:56] write a whole big book about you being
[1:11:59] an overcomer i am going to give you the
[1:12:02] word i'm going to anchor it in your soul
[1:12:04] and as it comes alive in your soul it
[1:12:07] will start to bring this flesh in
[1:12:10] subjection
[1:12:12] you say but i don't know if i'm maturing
[1:12:18] well are you the same person you was a
[1:12:20] year ago
[1:12:22] five years ago
[1:12:26] amen
[1:12:27] because i want to put it to you kindly
[1:12:29] i'm getting a little aggressive here and
[1:12:31] i don't mean to i'm just excited
[1:12:34] but if you're in the same position you
[1:12:35] was a year ago or five years ago please
[1:12:37] don't leave the building without coming
[1:12:38] to the altar
[1:12:41] spiritual growth is not god wiping away
[1:12:44] all of our challenges
[1:12:46] spiritual growth is not god babysitting
[1:12:49] us and as it was in a generation past
[1:12:51] giving everybody a trophy for just
[1:12:53] showing up
[1:12:56] spiritual growth my brother and sister
[1:12:57] comes from warfare
[1:12:59] spiritual growth comes from fighting the
[1:13:02] battle pressing into that and coming to
[1:13:05] the place oh my brother and sister can
[1:13:07] you imagine we show up out of laodicea
[1:13:09] and we show up there before the saints
[1:13:12] of the ages and we are all there we not
[1:13:14] got not one drop of blood as it were not
[1:13:17] one scar not one ear that's been nicked
[1:13:20] and not one you know pain that we've
[1:13:22] suffered and to stand before the saints
[1:13:25] of the ages and say well
[1:13:27] my you guys look
[1:13:29] pretty
[1:13:30] good
[1:13:32] yeah god just came down
[1:13:35] he just
[1:13:36] took everything away from us all i had
[1:13:38] to do is just go to church
[1:13:43] you know what god would have to do
[1:13:46] i won't go where it is and how it is but
[1:13:48] the prophet of god lays out the platform
[1:13:50] that god would have to go back and
[1:13:51] apologize to them
[1:13:53] so if they were bloodied and they were
[1:13:56] we will be bloodied and we are
[1:13:59] but they were overcomers
[1:14:01] we are overcomers we will stand there
[1:14:04] and when we come into their presence my
[1:14:06] brother and sister little fontaine's
[1:14:08] wrote a song are you she i think most of
[1:14:10] you probably have heard that my brother
[1:14:12] and sister god has saved something
[1:14:14] special in the anointing for the age
[1:14:16] that we live because he knows the
[1:14:18] culmination of all of the spirits of the
[1:14:21] age has come down in this day and yes we
[1:14:24] got a great battle we have a great
[1:14:26] temptation it's at our fingertips amen
[1:14:29] all of it's around us that god has given
[1:14:32] us revelation like no generation has had
[1:14:35] revelation he has come and the opening
[1:14:38] of the coming of christ is before us and
[1:14:41] there's nothing like running a race and
[1:14:43] seeing the finish line
[1:14:46] i'll tell you my brother and sister you
[1:14:48] know you see a little video or maybe you
[1:14:50] witnessed it in the flesh and you know
[1:14:52] you'll see these young people kids
[1:14:54] whatever you want to call it and they're
[1:14:56] running and they're running and they're
[1:14:57] coming around the back stretch and you
[1:14:59] can see the pace is is kind of you know
[1:15:02] they're struggling maybe they're panting
[1:15:04] a little bit and you can see they're not
[1:15:06] running smoothly and they round that
[1:15:08] last corner and they look down the track
[1:15:10] and they see the finish line and all of
[1:15:13] a sudden you know it's it's kind of
[1:15:15] funny
[1:15:16] because you know the really fast people
[1:15:18] run standing up
[1:15:20] the rest of us lean forward and work at
[1:15:21] it
[1:15:22] but the really fast people actually
[1:15:25] actually they run almost upright
[1:15:28] a little back curve to their spine
[1:15:30] and the way they move their legs and
[1:15:32] their arms is actually faster than our
[1:15:34] good old-fashioned farm boy method of
[1:15:36] running
[1:15:39] and you'll see them around that corner
[1:15:40] and they're laboring and they're panting
[1:15:42] and they're struggling and then all of a
[1:15:44] sudden you'll see them their head comes
[1:15:46] up
[1:15:47] you know you can't run with your head
[1:15:48] down
[1:15:53] i'd like to challenge if you if you're
[1:15:55] going to actually take accept this
[1:15:56] challenge get somebody to video you
[1:16:00] and then just to prove my point we'll
[1:16:02] show it here at church
[1:16:06] natural spiritual you cannot run with
[1:16:09] your head down
[1:16:11] god didn't call you to come as a beggar
[1:16:13] a servant as a bomb
[1:16:15] god called you as sons and daughters of
[1:16:18] god he called you royalty do we have any
[1:16:20] royalty here this morning he called us
[1:16:23] royalty saints and royalty doesn't run
[1:16:25] with its head down defeated
[1:16:28] but you can see them as they round that
[1:16:30] corner
[1:16:31] that little curve in their back
[1:16:33] goes away
[1:16:34] and you know why you know why they run
[1:16:37] better
[1:16:38] do you need a real reason
[1:16:43] you don't breathe as efficiently
[1:16:45] in a slumped position
[1:16:48] and it's oxygen that makes the muscles
[1:16:50] function
[1:16:52] when their back is curved
[1:16:55] their chest expanded
[1:16:58] they breathe deeper
[1:17:00] more oxygen comes in the body flows to
[1:17:02] the muscle
[1:17:04] and the muscle responds
[1:17:06] but you see them
[1:17:08] when the finish line
[1:17:10] comes in view
[1:17:12] you never thought somebody could run so
[1:17:14] fast
[1:17:15] they literally pick the pace up to a
[1:17:17] degree
[1:17:18] you think wow
[1:17:20] wow that that's how fast they run when
[1:17:22] they started this race
[1:17:24] i hope you're with me
[1:17:26] that's how fast they ran that's how they
[1:17:28] ran when they started the race but
[1:17:30] there's a period of time around this
[1:17:32] track here where it's just it's labor is
[1:17:35] it not it's it's hard it's it's a
[1:17:37] struggle and we get our head down and
[1:17:39] we're not breathing like we should and
[1:17:41] we can't have vision if we're looking at
[1:17:43] the ground but when we come and
[1:17:45] recognize there's a finish line in front
[1:17:48] of us there's something about that that
[1:17:50] starts it and the prophet of god lays it
[1:17:52] out if you want to go search it out
[1:17:54] there is a little bit of reading between
[1:17:56] the lines if that's acceptable but
[1:17:58] you'll see this the prophet of god
[1:18:00] talking about to the end of the age and
[1:18:02] he says there is no revival yet
[1:18:06] i think you can use those very words
[1:18:08] there is no
[1:18:10] revival yet
[1:18:15] and the revival it is to come
[1:18:18] is a bride's revival not exact words
[1:18:21] it's a bride's revival you know what the
[1:18:23] bride's revival is we've rounded the
[1:18:25] corner and we see the finish line and
[1:18:28] something's anointing us oh lord my
[1:18:31] breath is deeper i got more voice to say
[1:18:34] oh lord come quickly
[1:18:38] because we're no longer caught in a rage
[1:18:40] to look at the flesh we're no longer
[1:18:42] caught in trying to establish ourselves
[1:18:44] as something of this world but we
[1:18:46] recognize i have a heavenly kingdom and
[1:18:49] god shared it he gave it to me and i
[1:18:52] claim that in the name of jesus christ
[1:18:55] hallelujah
[1:18:57] now look at this
[1:18:59] how can we overc how can we overcome
[1:19:02] it won't be our strength it won't be our
[1:19:03] knowledge right
[1:19:05] but did you know it will actually be an
[1:19:07] action
[1:19:10] are you with me
[1:19:12] oh non-action-like works gospel
[1:19:17] just told us right here in the scripture
[1:19:22] the action
[1:19:24] is to let us therefore
[1:19:27] come
[1:19:29] that's bold
[1:19:31] that's bold my brother and sister for us
[1:19:33] to think we
[1:19:34] can come boldly
[1:19:38] but this is what the word declared
[1:19:40] therefore come boldly into the throne of
[1:19:42] grace yes
[1:19:44] look i'm telling you sometimes my
[1:19:45] brother and sister we're alike i don't
[1:19:48] have to throw you under the bus so i
[1:19:49] don't have to throw myself under the bus
[1:19:51] we're humans
[1:19:52] but look at this what do we do we go
[1:19:54] into great trouble when travail and our
[1:19:57] spirits are depressed suppressed
[1:19:59] oppressed whatever kind of press you
[1:20:00] want to talk about and we do but you
[1:20:03] know what the devil does he brings us to
[1:20:05] a place we don't come boldly oh i said
[1:20:09] this i'd done this i looked at this i
[1:20:11] what i i oh my what do you do you cannot
[1:20:15] come boldly to the throne when you're
[1:20:17] under a spirit of condemnation you can't
[1:20:19] come boldly to the throne when you don't
[1:20:21] feel worthy you can't come boldly to the
[1:20:23] throne when you are struggling in that
[1:20:26] realm of the flesh but it's there that
[1:20:28] the word is telling us we have a high
[1:20:31] priest amen and he is touched with our
[1:20:33] infirmity and he was tempted he knows
[1:20:37] what you're facing
[1:20:38] and he says okay i know what you're
[1:20:41] facing now what i want you to do is come
[1:20:44] boldly to my throne i want you to get up
[1:20:47] out of your pity party i want you to get
[1:20:49] up out of your little thing you got
[1:20:51] going here and i want you to come boldly
[1:20:54] to my throne and this is not just a
[1:20:57] throne it's a throne of grace it's a
[1:21:00] place that grace resides is at that
[1:21:02] throne amen and then you obtain mercy
[1:21:06] and you find grace
[1:21:09] to help
[1:21:10] in the time
[1:21:12] of someone else's need
[1:21:14] possibly
[1:21:15] but he's actually speaking to you
[1:21:18] the time of your need
[1:21:24] prophet
[1:21:26] made statements like
[1:21:30] struggling with the devil
[1:21:33] how do you deal with that
[1:21:39] thank you lord
[1:21:40] how am i going to deal with the devil
[1:21:43] amen i need a tool
[1:21:46] chainsaw wouldn't be bad
[1:21:48] big sharp sword wouldn't be too bad
[1:21:52] a mortar machine gun
[1:21:55] no what did he say
[1:21:59] your position
[1:22:01] satan
[1:22:03] get thee behind me
[1:22:08] what is it when you hear the word and
[1:22:09] you mixed it with faith
[1:22:11] you actually
[1:22:13] realize i have the authority to say that
[1:22:16] satan get thee behind me
[1:22:19] but you see my brother and sister we
[1:22:22] need to come we need this action we need
[1:22:25] to to do this to come boldly and i want
[1:22:28] to drive this home to you if i can this
[1:22:30] morning it will be an action
[1:22:34] it's not figurative
[1:22:36] it's not an allegory
[1:22:39] it's an action
[1:22:41] it's an action of you
[1:22:44] taking your rightful position and saying
[1:22:46] lord
[1:22:47] forgive me for my thought for my deed
[1:22:49] for whatever it might be
[1:22:52] but lord i'm coming
[1:22:53] to your throne
[1:22:55] and i'm going to receive
[1:22:57] what i need and i am going to find grace
[1:23:01] in time
[1:23:02] of need
[1:23:04] you see coming boldly to the throne of
[1:23:06] grace at that throne my brother and
[1:23:08] sister there's where we obtain mercy
[1:23:10] and we find that in our time of need so
[1:23:13] as we need to overcome and we come and
[1:23:16] face the challenge of our day what the
[1:23:18] word of god is telling us is we need to
[1:23:20] become more and more dependent in fact
[1:23:22] some people are embarrassed to say well
[1:23:24] you know i had to go i had to go repent
[1:23:26] i'll tell you what god's doing in the
[1:23:27] life of the believer the true believer
[1:23:30] he's causing them to be so sensitive
[1:23:32] that every little thing that they do
[1:23:34] they're saying lord forgive me oh lord
[1:23:37] forgive me i i you know sometimes on the
[1:23:39] farm i justify this
[1:23:42] i justify this you know are we all
[1:23:44] justified
[1:23:46] i justify this it's okay to run a stop
[1:23:49] sign on a piece of farm equipment
[1:23:51] but not in your car
[1:23:58] justified
[1:24:00] justifying
[1:24:02] it takes so much effort to pick up speed
[1:24:05] again i'm justified
[1:24:07] my tractor is so slow
[1:24:10] it'll only go go go so i'm justified to
[1:24:13] not slow down
[1:24:20] but you know every time i run a stop
[1:24:22] sign on a tractor
[1:24:24] a voice speaks to me
[1:24:27] and i'm like
[1:24:28] lord forgive me
[1:24:31] but you know the next day i did it again
[1:24:40] and i don't really want to
[1:24:43] usually
[1:24:44] it's because sister jerry's got
[1:24:45] breakfast waiting for me
[1:24:47] right one excuse is as good as another
[1:24:51] right
[1:24:54] now i use that it's truthful
[1:24:57] and i do repent
[1:24:58] but you see my brother and sister
[1:25:01] god's given us a place for those little
[1:25:04] things
[1:25:06] those little foxes
[1:25:07] he's given us a place
[1:25:09] to deal with them imagine if you live a
[1:25:13] spotless life but you had a bad habit of
[1:25:15] speeding
[1:25:21] not speaking to you church but you know
[1:25:23] people like you in church
[1:25:26] you imagine the devil you'd show up
[1:25:27] there and the judgment and the devil
[1:25:29] would say yep
[1:25:30] i recorded
[1:25:33] i recorded
[1:25:34] 32
[1:25:35] 681
[1:25:37] counts
[1:25:38] of them breaking the speed limit
[1:25:44] and one who is guilty of one law is
[1:25:46] guilty of them all
[1:25:48] you see
[1:25:49] am i coming across okay
[1:25:52] but god says you know what
[1:25:54] if you'll come boldly to the throne of
[1:25:56] grace
[1:25:57] you can obtain mercy and you can find
[1:25:59] grace to help you in the time of your
[1:26:01] need
[1:26:02] amen whether it's something in the mind
[1:26:04] whether it's something you struggle with
[1:26:06] amen hallelujah
[1:26:08] now it seems
[1:26:10] i don't know about you saints i'm not
[1:26:11] preaching to myself i don't think this
[1:26:13] morning totally and entirely but it
[1:26:15] seems that i have a need every single
[1:26:18] day of my life
[1:26:20] i have a reason to go back to the throne
[1:26:24] every single day of my life
[1:26:27] and you know there's an answer lord i
[1:26:29] need thee that song oh every hour i need
[1:26:33] thee
[1:26:34] oh could we just lift a hand and say
[1:26:37] lord i need thee
[1:26:38] i know my life is not not as such that i
[1:26:42] need you lord to get through this life
[1:26:45] lord i need this
[1:26:47] amen if we could make a theme maybe we
[1:26:49] could just claim that theme lord i need
[1:26:52] thee
[1:26:53] amen you know satan's had centuries to
[1:26:55] perfect his deception
[1:26:58] you know that
[1:26:59] i was just listening to a brother
[1:27:01] minister i love this brother's ministry
[1:27:02] i won't mention names but i was
[1:27:04] listening to this brother's ministry and
[1:27:06] and i loved how he put this point and
[1:27:08] and parents please hear me
[1:27:11] this brother made the point he says now
[1:27:14] you come
[1:27:16] you send your children to school
[1:27:19] they have six hours of schooling
[1:27:22] a lot of nonsense a lot of stuff
[1:27:25] indoctrination
[1:27:29] six hours
[1:27:31] that's 30 hours a week
[1:27:34] and we think two or three hours of
[1:27:36] church
[1:27:37] is going to offset that
[1:27:43] maybe i'll go ahead and quote the rest
[1:27:44] of what the brother said there
[1:27:46] is that all right plagiarize a good
[1:27:49] godly pastor in the message
[1:27:51] he said you parents that use electronics
[1:27:54] to babysit your children
[1:27:57] you think it's okay right now you will
[1:27:59] pay the price for that
[1:28:01] god did not create parents to let an
[1:28:04] electronic device be the babysitter
[1:28:08] you wonder what spirits are out there
[1:28:10] it's all there in their hand click click
[1:28:14] click click
[1:28:16] oh come on
[1:28:17] maybe that'll skin some of you but maybe
[1:28:19] it ought to
[1:28:20] amen god didn't give us the job for us
[1:28:22] to pass it off to some electronics and
[1:28:25] i'm telling you what i read some
[1:28:26] research most of the people who write
[1:28:29] these games write these programs don't
[1:28:32] even believe there's a god they're
[1:28:34] satanic worshipers all of this war stuff
[1:28:38] i watched a video this man was there and
[1:28:40] he's admitting they were actually
[1:28:42] interviewing him for this great creation
[1:28:44] of a war game that he had i don't
[1:28:46] remember even what it was called uh some
[1:28:48] kind of thrones thing or whatever and he
[1:28:50] said oh they said how did you write this
[1:28:53] most popular
[1:28:55] app or game of this in the whole world
[1:28:58] how did you write that he said well i
[1:29:00] was listening to some acid rock one
[1:29:02] evening and i was there and something
[1:29:05] began to formulate in my mind so i went
[1:29:08] and i i took a little bit of this and a
[1:29:10] little bit of that talking about drugs
[1:29:12] and he said then i just went into
[1:29:13] another dimension and when i woke up 30
[1:29:17] hours later i oh woke up get this when i
[1:29:20] woke up 30 hours later i had written
[1:29:23] program this game
[1:29:28] and they said wow
[1:29:29] even the interviewer is like
[1:29:31] wow
[1:29:34] and the man's like i was anointed
[1:29:38] oh some of you
[1:29:40] will have played that game
[1:29:42] because it's all this warfare stuff
[1:29:44] kings and castles and this and kill oh
[1:29:47] come on get this kill conquer do this
[1:29:51] death
[1:29:55] oh yeah no problem it's just a game
[1:29:59] just like my life is just a game
[1:30:01] your life
[1:30:03] is just a game
[1:30:04] no i didn't get you all suppressed and
[1:30:07] subdued did i
[1:30:09] maybe to balance this out
[1:30:14] don't take paul's word for it
[1:30:17] go invest a few hours of prayer
[1:30:21] you know what they say
[1:30:22] i'm not making mockery it's a joke in
[1:30:24] our house kind of but
[1:30:26] you know they say if something's good
[1:30:27] for you hold it
[1:30:29] hold it up here like this
[1:30:33] and if your body likes it
[1:30:37] yeah
[1:30:38] some of you believe that stuff don't you
[1:30:42] because i'll tell you what i've done
[1:30:44] i've held up a hershey bar with almonds
[1:30:46] and just fallen all over myself on that
[1:30:48] thing
[1:30:50] it must be good for me
[1:30:52] i'm sure it was the almonds
[1:30:57] let me take another avenue for you
[1:30:59] if you'll take that whatever it is some
[1:31:01] game
[1:31:02] some book
[1:31:03] some whatever
[1:31:05] and you'll take that thing
[1:31:07] and you'll get a hold of that thing and
[1:31:09] you'll bow your head over it and say go
[1:31:10] on
[1:31:12] it's just going to feed me spiritually
[1:31:15] is this going to make my children go up
[1:31:18] in the fear and admonition of the lord
[1:31:20] or was this something written by a devil
[1:31:24] that's here to undermine and destroy and
[1:31:26] plant another kind of seed i challenge
[1:31:29] your parents
[1:31:31] i challenge you
[1:31:32] you don't just give it to your kid you
[1:31:34] take it to the throne of grace your own
[1:31:36] self first and give it a word test
[1:31:40] and let me just be bold enough to say if
[1:31:42] you'll take that garbage and you'll put
[1:31:44] it to a word test you'll never let your
[1:31:46] children touch it
[1:31:48] because you can't have something that
[1:31:49] was written by a devil
[1:31:52] anoint you to spiritual things
[1:31:54] oh it'll anoint you to spiritual things
[1:31:56] let me rephrase that to godly things
[1:32:00] okay is that okay y'all still love me
[1:32:03] yeah
[1:32:04] christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:32:05] brother brown says here you've got to
[1:32:08] make the picture look right it's god's
[1:32:10] great picture and there is only one way
[1:32:12] you'll see it that is when you see jesus
[1:32:14] christ there is the entire bible he is
[1:32:17] the principal theme of the bible now you
[1:32:20] realize that any of these places here
[1:32:22] you could take a text and it's just hard
[1:32:24] for a preacher to hold his peace and i
[1:32:26] say amen and he looked like he want to
[1:32:29] keep going with it but you've got to get
[1:32:31] back to what we're teaching on
[1:32:33] he is the principal theme of the bible
[1:32:37] he was in the prophets
[1:32:38] he was in the psalms it was in the
[1:32:41] history of the bible the bible is a
[1:32:43] prophetic book
[1:32:45] it's a historical book it's a book of
[1:32:47] love
[1:32:51] think about this in contrast to the
[1:32:52] world there was some atheists back east
[1:32:56] got elected to their state legislature
[1:32:59] and tried to put a law
[1:33:01] wrote a law and submitted it
[1:33:03] in their their state legislature
[1:33:06] to declare the bible a hate book
[1:33:11] yeah
[1:33:13] yeah i think i'll vote with the prophet
[1:33:16] amen
[1:33:18] hallelujah
[1:33:24] it's in the prophets in the psalms in
[1:33:26] history in the bible it's the things
[1:33:28] that is to come
[1:33:29] see was before
[1:33:31] until after
[1:33:35] did i skip over something
[1:33:40] i got lost somebody help me
[1:33:44] oh right there the very top line
[1:33:46] it's a book of love it's a book of songs
[1:33:49] it's a book of life
[1:33:51] and in there you find christ he was in
[1:33:53] the prophets he was in the psalms he was
[1:33:55] in the history he also in the bible is
[1:33:58] the things that is to come so he was
[1:34:00] before until after what does that make
[1:34:03] him then the same yesterday today and
[1:34:06] forever
[1:34:07] and you inject something in there that
[1:34:09] doesn't make him the same yesterday
[1:34:11] today and forever brother lee where do
[1:34:14] you go to
[1:34:15] you got an awful picture there for he
[1:34:18] was the history see he is the prophet he
[1:34:20] is the psalms he is everything and if
[1:34:23] you can't make him everything and the
[1:34:26] same where what's your picture look like
[1:34:29] do you see it
[1:34:31] all right
[1:34:33] amen
[1:34:34] oh
[1:34:35] is that the end of that
[1:34:37] i guess it is my i thought that quote
[1:34:39] when i was studying it was much longer
[1:34:41] excuse me
[1:34:42] i'm caught in a time warp here now look
[1:34:46] at this my brother and sister as you
[1:34:48] look at this i want you to catch this
[1:34:50] that you see the picture
[1:34:52] that's being presented
[1:34:58] brother george is preaching on the book
[1:34:59] of acts
[1:35:01] don't you like that
[1:35:02] he must be keeping notes because i don't
[1:35:04] know if a guy can remember what verse he
[1:35:06] left off on
[1:35:08] you know eight ten months later
[1:35:13] having a lovely conversation with
[1:35:14] brother george you know why he's
[1:35:16] preaching the book of acts saints
[1:35:19] he's trying to get us to see
[1:35:23] not
[1:35:24] what god did then
[1:35:27] to come to pass now
[1:35:30] he wants us to see what god did then
[1:35:33] is coming to pass
[1:35:35] now
[1:35:37] that's what he's trying to bring to life
[1:35:39] is not a vision of we hope someday to
[1:35:41] have this but my brother and sister
[1:35:43] we're seeing the dead brought back to
[1:35:45] life we're seeing the maimed and the
[1:35:47] crippled and the possessed being
[1:35:49] delivered you say brother paul i don't
[1:35:51] see it well i'll tell you what don't let
[1:35:54] what's happening in grace tabernacle or
[1:35:56] the neighborhood or your world dictates
[1:35:58] your thoughts of what god is doing
[1:36:00] around the earth god is saving my
[1:36:02] brother and sister muslims off the
[1:36:04] street hearing a prayer and you know in
[1:36:07] those countries where they hear those
[1:36:09] prayers like that you actually can be
[1:36:10] sentenced to death for praying in public
[1:36:12] but a muslim hearing a christian pray
[1:36:15] and saying there's something there
[1:36:17] there's something what is that i must
[1:36:20] have that
[1:36:24] in africa
[1:36:27] troubles my brother and sister
[1:36:30] over property believers wanting to use a
[1:36:33] property denominational church wanting
[1:36:35] to use a property
[1:36:37] in a big fuss the denomination
[1:36:40] making a such a big deal out of it and
[1:36:42] they're there broadcasting it these
[1:36:44] people are doing this and they're doing
[1:36:46] that representing it wrong and so there
[1:36:48] was a meeting my brother and sister i'm
[1:36:50] kind of butchering this a little bit
[1:36:52] there was a meeting
[1:36:54] a minister type meeting and this
[1:36:56] pentecostal pastor comes and he says can
[1:36:59] i and as they described it he was there
[1:37:02] in his very fine suit but befitting a
[1:37:05] pentecostal bishop of his position and
[1:37:08] he comes and says you're having a
[1:37:10] meeting can i come in and they said yes
[1:37:12] you can come in and he's basically like
[1:37:15] is there limitations no you just come
[1:37:18] and he comes in and he hears what's
[1:37:20] being spoken and before the meeting's
[1:37:22] over he calls he says i would like a
[1:37:24] moment to speak and they said speak and
[1:37:27] he said i have heard this and this is
[1:37:30] the truth and to punctuate my words that
[1:37:32] this is the truth i desire to be
[1:37:34] baptized right now
[1:37:38] oh no no gods no no god's not doing
[1:37:41] anything
[1:37:43] we're in a time warp just circling
[1:37:45] around
[1:37:46] if it is it's because you and i have put
[1:37:48] ourselves in that time war
[1:37:50] it's because you and i have not stepped
[1:37:52] out in the faith on the word and
[1:37:54] declared my god hears my needs my god
[1:37:56] knows what i need my god is going to
[1:37:58] come and answer my need and my greatest
[1:38:01] need saints i tell you this morning and
[1:38:03] i'm not ashamed to say it and my flesh
[1:38:06] is ashamed to say it but my greatest
[1:38:08] need is not more strength not more
[1:38:11] wisdom not more money not more lands i
[1:38:15] have need my greatest need is more of
[1:38:18] god
[1:38:19] more of the holy ghost is my greatest
[1:38:21] need today
[1:38:24] i am the limiting factor of paul's
[1:38:26] spiritual life
[1:38:30] oh lord help us
[1:38:32] he is everything brother branham here
[1:38:34] and christ the mystery of god revealed

[1:38:43] sister where our priority needs to be
[1:38:45] amen hebrews 13 8 it's not dead it's not
[1:38:48] gone god's alive he's well all is well
[1:38:51] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:38:53] forever
[1:38:54] hallelujah i need to close here
[1:38:57] now look
[1:38:58] just for a moment can i have it just a
[1:39:00] few more minutes
[1:39:02] now
[1:39:03] we've had a glimpse of these other ages
[1:39:05] and we've all read enough history
[1:39:07] to understand
[1:39:11] we could share
[1:39:13] we could share things
[1:39:15] that we read of history
[1:39:19] too gory and too gruesome really to
[1:39:21] share in
[1:39:22] in church
[1:39:23] amongst congregation amongst children
[1:39:30] but a battle so great
[1:39:36] i'm often reminded
[1:39:38] my thoughts
[1:39:42] fox's book of mortars
[1:39:46] sorry i had to say that to
[1:39:48] torment my wife
[1:39:50] marchers
[1:39:52] she's like oh paul they weren't shooting
[1:39:55] at each other
[1:40:03] in there is the story of a man quite
[1:40:05] wealthy
[1:40:08] and somebody outed him
[1:40:10] maybe someone within his own family a
[1:40:11] servant or something they outed him that
[1:40:14] was a christian and they come
[1:40:16] and they say are you a christian he says
[1:40:17] yes i am
[1:40:19] they take him down where they're burning
[1:40:20] the christians at the state
[1:40:24] and as a moment as he's there
[1:40:27] they're tying him to the post and he's
[1:40:28] just watched a christian go up in flames
[1:40:34] and they said to you you repent and he
[1:40:36] says yes
[1:40:39] i recant
[1:40:44] in this flesh
[1:40:46] there was not enough strength in this
[1:40:49] flesh
[1:40:50] to watch someone chained
[1:40:53] to a post
[1:40:55] and set a flame
[1:40:57] in a giant pile
[1:40:59] of wood
[1:41:01] and burnt to death
[1:41:05] and he recants
[1:41:08] they turn him free he's recanted he's
[1:41:11] forsaken christ
[1:41:14] but all night long
[1:41:16] he's repenting have you ever had a night
[1:41:19] like that
[1:41:22] all night long he's repenting
[1:41:24] god forgive me
[1:41:26] forgive me lord forgive me lord forgive
[1:41:28] me you know the first forgiveness and
[1:41:30] the sincerity of the heart was
[1:41:31] sufficient
[1:41:32] but isn't there something interesting
[1:41:34] about the human nature
[1:41:36] that our heart condemns us
[1:41:38] our heart puts us in a place where it's
[1:41:40] almost like we don't believe that that
[1:41:42] first
[1:41:43] sincere prayer forgiveness is sufficient
[1:41:46] and we'll find ourselves in the middle
[1:41:48] of the night lord forgive me
[1:41:50] lord forgive me for you
[1:41:53] he got up bright and early the next
[1:41:55] morning
[1:41:58] went down to where they're already
[1:42:01] burning the saints at this stage
[1:42:06] and he says hey this is just my words
[1:42:09] you know what happened here yesterday
[1:42:12] yes i recant
[1:42:18] no you did that yesterday no i'm doing
[1:42:19] it today
[1:42:21] what i told you
[1:42:23] i recant
[1:42:25] and they're like do you realize your
[1:42:26] fine house your mansions your lands your
[1:42:28] servants your wife your children
[1:42:30] you realize you could have all of that
[1:42:32] and still live that just deny
[1:42:34] just step aside you're still serving god
[1:42:36] because after all we are the church
[1:42:40] you know it's strange how that
[1:42:41] persecution's still going on today
[1:42:46] you believe this doctrine after all we
[1:42:48] are the message
[1:42:50] believe that believe that
[1:42:51] deny this
[1:42:53] embrace that come on that spirit's not
[1:42:55] dead
[1:42:57] and they said so you're denying what you
[1:42:59] denied yesterday and he says yep
[1:43:01] i honestly cannot deny jesus christ
[1:43:05] and they're like you realize we're going
[1:43:06] to burn you at the stake
[1:43:09] he said
[1:43:11] this flesh
[1:43:14] just doesn't matter
[1:43:16] they went to time get these things you
[1:43:18] know they use chains because they've got
[1:43:20] to use them over and over again there's
[1:43:21] no way you're going to escape the chains
[1:43:23] they went to chain him
[1:43:26] and he says no
[1:43:28] no he said i i just
[1:43:30] i'm just
[1:43:31] i'm so committed you don't even need to
[1:43:33] chain me
[1:43:35] and they're like what
[1:43:38] he said yes give me one last wish and
[1:43:41] that would be you don't tie me
[1:43:44] to the tree
[1:43:50] fine
[1:43:51] you want to stand there get burnt no
[1:43:53] problem
[1:43:55] you know what happened they piled the
[1:43:56] wood up even higher
[1:43:58] they added all that fuel they lit it on
[1:44:00] fire
[1:44:01] and as the flames started to lick up
[1:44:04] against his flesh
[1:44:06] come on i want you to have a visual of
[1:44:08] this
[1:44:10] as the flame started to lick against his
[1:44:12] flesh
[1:44:13] he lifted
[1:44:15] his hands
[1:44:16] and they could hear his voice
[1:44:19] praising god
[1:44:21] declaring
[1:44:23] lord jesus i'm coming to see you
[1:44:26] i love you lord i give my life for you
[1:44:29] and they took sticks even as the flames
[1:44:32] are roasting his flesh they took sticks
[1:44:35] and tried to knock his arms down but
[1:44:37] they couldn't get his arms to go down
[1:44:40] and the memory that was seared in their
[1:44:42] visual is that this was a man with his
[1:44:45] mouth open and he died with his hands
[1:44:48] lifted praising god
[1:44:51] and they never ever allowed another man
[1:44:54] to not be chained
[1:44:57] because it smote them in their heart
[1:45:01] what was it saints
[1:45:03] he
[1:45:05] had already overcome
[1:45:07] a fear
[1:45:09] of the first death
[1:45:12] the night before
[1:45:15] he had overcome as it were the fear of
[1:45:17] the second death to the point he was
[1:45:20] willing to sacrifice his flesh
[1:45:23] to not be there
[1:45:24] oh god help us
[1:45:26] god help us oh we may never face a
[1:45:29] flaming
[1:45:30] we may never face those kind of things
[1:45:32] saints but we're going to have to die
[1:45:34] we're going to have to be more afraid of
[1:45:36] the second death than we are of the
[1:45:38] first death to be able to overcome
[1:45:41] it will be a place a thing that we will
[1:45:44] have to come and say you know what lord
[1:45:46] i'm willing to give amen i'll tell you
[1:45:49] it's there we're living in a day you
[1:45:51] know i want to can i give you a little
[1:45:53] homework would anybody do it if i
[1:45:54] actually was like a teacher
[1:45:58] children before class comes together
[1:46:00] again
[1:46:01] read proverbs 3.
[1:46:06] i encourage you
[1:46:08] incredible scripture
[1:46:10] incredible scripture
[1:46:12] now
[1:46:14] do i i that that other time didn't count
[1:46:16] against me right
[1:46:20] okay i am finished soon as we
[1:46:22] preach all these scriptures
[1:46:27] let's just go back and go through
[1:46:29] revelations 3 14 through 18.
[1:46:34] this is a word for our hour
[1:46:37] and into the angel of the church of the
[1:46:38] laodiceans right
[1:46:40] these things saith the amen
[1:46:43] the faithful and true witness the
[1:46:45] beginning
[1:46:46] of the creation of god
[1:46:51] i know thy works
[1:46:53] now this is an indictment saints this
[1:46:55] would be what a prosecutor would read in
[1:46:57] a
[1:46:58] court of law
[1:47:00] i know thy works
[1:47:02] that thou art neither cold nor hot
[1:47:06] i would thou wort cold or hot
[1:47:09] now as we go through this i want to to
[1:47:12] leave this
[1:47:14] in such a fashion
[1:47:16] do we have the answer to this
[1:47:20] yes come on saints do we have the answer
[1:47:23] to this verse
[1:47:24] amen
[1:47:26] amen
[1:47:27] it's because they've come
[1:47:29] they're neither cold or hot god said i'd
[1:47:32] rather you would be cold let's not call
[1:47:34] let's not claim that as an option
[1:47:36] but we have the answer to lukewarm
[1:47:40] god has given us in this hour a word
[1:47:43] that is the answer for lukewarm
[1:47:46] so if we remain lukewarm and i don't say
[1:47:48] this spitefully or judgmentally but if
[1:47:51] we uh stay or or stay in the position of
[1:47:54] being lukewarm my brother and sister
[1:47:56] that will not be god's fault it won't be
[1:47:58] the church's fault it won't be the
[1:48:00] pastor's fault it will be our fault
[1:48:02] because we have been given the solution
[1:48:05] to cold and lukewarm
[1:48:07] amen it is a position that god has given
[1:48:10] us that we could come and and not have
[1:48:13] be stuck there and say i can't do
[1:48:14] anything about it we've been given the
[1:48:16] answer to satan's question
[1:48:20] he says i'll spew you out of my mouth
[1:48:24] now some people will say
[1:48:25] that's that's figurative isn't it
[1:48:28] well
[1:48:30] we'll just take the stance of being
[1:48:32] figurative
[1:48:35] because the opposite of that will be
[1:48:37] well done my good and faithful servant
[1:48:39] now i want to ask you which one would
[1:48:40] you want to hear
[1:48:42] what is our choice
[1:48:47] cast into outer darkness weeping wailing
[1:48:49] gnashing of teeth
[1:48:53] or well done
[1:48:56] come on saints i'm not saying this in a
[1:48:58] negative fashion
[1:49:00] i'm just bringing this that we can
[1:49:02] recognize
[1:49:04] what satan's trying to do in our hour
[1:49:07] he's made the message
[1:49:09] a tradition
[1:49:10] because the scripture says it's because
[1:49:12] of tradition that the word has been made
[1:49:15] of no effect
[1:49:17] don't let this message be tradition let
[1:49:19] it be life let it be on fire let it be
[1:49:21] burning i you know believe it or not
[1:49:23] this morning never even struck me this
[1:49:25] way i just woke up with that little
[1:49:26] thought i almost asked our little
[1:49:28] sisters to sing that song up find my
[1:49:30] bones hallelujah i i like the beat of
[1:49:33] that i mean i like that you know because
[1:49:35] what it is my brother and sister is not
[1:49:36] firing my mind
[1:49:39] amen it's right down the very fiber of
[1:49:41] who we are
[1:49:42] let me hurry along here
[1:49:44] because thou saith i am rich and
[1:49:46] increased with goods
[1:49:47] and have need of nothing
[1:49:50] and know us not that thou are wretched
[1:49:52] and miserable and poor and blind and
[1:49:55] naked
[1:49:57] so we recognize my brother and sister to
[1:49:59] declare
[1:50:00] just simply to declare
[1:50:03] is not enough
[1:50:05] to simply say i've got the message i've
[1:50:07] got the holy ghost i've got all of these
[1:50:09] things look at the life god has given me
[1:50:11] that means nothing my brother and sister
[1:50:14] we've got to come to the place that we
[1:50:16] recognize i will not by god's grace
[1:50:19] because i'm going to come boldly to the
[1:50:22] throne of grace in my time of need i
[1:50:26] don't have to be wretched amen i don't
[1:50:29] have to be naked i don't have to be all
[1:50:32] of these things that would be a stigma
[1:50:34] because i have a throne that god's given
[1:50:37] me permission can someone say permission
[1:50:39] amen i've been given permission to come
[1:50:42] to this throne in the time of my need
[1:50:44] and if i am blind i have a need if i am
[1:50:47] naked i have a need if i am wretched i
[1:50:50] have a need amen so god says i'm opening
[1:50:54] the door to my throne because i have the
[1:50:57] solution the answer to your need
[1:51:08] but
[1:51:10] but brother paul you don't understand my
[1:51:12] situation
[1:51:14] i'm going to be rude if you don't mind
[1:51:16] you don't understand
[1:51:18] the power
[1:51:20] of a boldness to come to the throne
[1:51:24] that's what you don't understand is the
[1:51:26] power of the boldness you don't need any
[1:51:28] man's permission you don't need anything
[1:51:30] you just follow god gave it you take it
[1:51:33] you apply it and come boldly
[1:51:37] he says i counsel thee my
[1:51:39] of me gold tried in the fire that thou
[1:51:41] mayest be rich and white raiment thou
[1:51:44] mayest be clothed
[1:51:46] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[1:51:48] not appear
[1:51:49] and anoint thine eyes with thy sound
[1:51:51] that thou mayest see
[1:51:56] what do i got to do brother paul to buy
[1:51:57] this gold
[1:52:03] well
[1:52:04] get away from the cardinal
[1:52:06] it's a good start
[1:52:11] you know i thought this was funny
[1:52:14] a
[1:52:14] well-known non-denominational preacher
[1:52:20] made a statement i read the little
[1:52:21] quotation of it
[1:52:23] he said
[1:52:26] there'll be no financial statements
[1:52:28] in heaven
[1:52:32] god won't care
[1:52:34] he doesn't care saints can i emphasize
[1:52:36] this he doesn't care what we have here
[1:52:43] yeah
[1:52:45] and then amazing i'm speaking to paul
[1:52:47] first so nobody offended isn't it
[1:52:49] amazing how much emphasis we save on a
[1:52:51] little more in our 401k a little more in
[1:52:53] our savings account a little more on our
[1:52:55] mortgage a little more here a little
[1:52:57] more there
[1:52:58] and god could care less
[1:53:03] as many as i love i rebuke and chasten
[1:53:05] be zealous therefore and repent
[1:53:08] behold i stand at the door and knock and
[1:53:10] if any man hear my voice and open the
[1:53:12] door i will come unto him and will sup
[1:53:15] with him and he with me to him
[1:53:19] that overcometh
[1:53:21] amen we've already been over this verse
[1:53:23] but to him that overcometh will i grant
[1:53:26] to sit with me
[1:53:28] in my throne
[1:53:29] even as i also overcame and am set down
[1:53:33] with my father in his throne
[1:53:36] he
[1:53:37] the hath and ear
[1:53:41] let him hear with the spirit saith in
[1:53:42] the churches
[1:53:45] amen
[1:53:47] oh
[1:53:50] i'll just keep this last quote because
[1:53:52] i've just kind of kept begging you for
[1:53:55] time
[1:53:56] but it's a good one
[1:54:00] anybody want to eat dessert first today
[1:54:03] huh let me at least see let me see at
[1:54:05] least one hand so that i i can okay okay
[1:54:10] amen the testimony on the sea
[1:54:14] what happened when the dark hour come
[1:54:16] along that they realized that had not
[1:54:18] had him with them
[1:54:19] and the first thing you know here he
[1:54:21] come
[1:54:22] see and now little of this why this just
[1:54:24] stirred my heart thinking about what
[1:54:25] brother stephen preached to us
[1:54:28] and first thing you know here he come
[1:54:31] walking to them on the sea
[1:54:33] the only thing that could help them
[1:54:36] and what did they do they cried out they
[1:54:38] were scared of him
[1:54:42] imagine if some of our
[1:54:44] innermost emotion
[1:54:45] would ever get
[1:54:48] released okay i'll just say it you got
[1:54:51] to have somebody to blame
[1:54:54] i think most of us are just scared
[1:54:57] lord just really get aholds of us
[1:55:01] oh no it's not about the running and
[1:55:03] jumping and shouting that matters
[1:55:05] but when the spirit of god comes down on
[1:55:07] us
[1:55:08] most of us clamp on a leg iron and hook
[1:55:10] it to the pew
[1:55:13] oh no lord i wouldn't want to be the one
[1:55:15] in the aisle we'll be here
[1:55:19] i've heard it oh you know who told me
[1:55:21] this
[1:55:22] it's been more than one of you
[1:55:24] you know brother paul
[1:55:26] the service was good i felt like getting
[1:55:28] up and jumping and screaming and running
[1:55:31] up the aisle of the church
[1:55:33] yeah
[1:55:35] you did huh
[1:55:37] you felt like it
[1:55:40] that's all you had was feelings
[1:55:43] oh no brother paul that be a spectacle
[1:55:45] might be out of order
[1:55:48] might be out of order
[1:55:49] well i'll tell you what maybe just ask
[1:55:51] brother george next time you see him
[1:55:53] about the sister there in the tabernacle
[1:55:56] would get so excited
[1:55:58] she would get so filled with the spirit
[1:56:00] she'd jump up she carried a handbag that
[1:56:03] said samsonite on it
[1:56:07] and she would get so excited she'd get
[1:56:09] that hand back and handbag in her hand
[1:56:12] and she'd be there all prayers a lord
[1:56:14] and there went this and the car keys and
[1:56:16] then with tissue no wallet maybe a
[1:56:19] little money who knows the kids whatever
[1:56:23] do you ever hear on tape where they
[1:56:25] rebuked her sit down sister
[1:56:28] be quiet
[1:56:31] no they said she did it time after time
[1:56:33] and if you were lucky you were out of
[1:56:35] range of that handbag making that circle
[1:56:38] yeah
[1:56:40] come on saints could i challenge you
[1:56:43] challenge us as a church to not put the
[1:56:45] shackles on am i saying we got to get up
[1:56:48] and start running up down the aisles no
[1:56:49] i'm not saying that but maybe some of
[1:56:51] you can't even get a hand in the air
[1:56:53] some of you can't get a hallelujah
[1:56:55] praise the lord thank you lord amen out
[1:56:58] amen oh i'm not trying to tell you got
[1:57:00] to do these things i'm just telling you
[1:57:02] see god's not looking for us to remain
[1:57:04] all civilized and sophisticated that we
[1:57:07] can say i praise the lord the spirit
[1:57:09] moved today what did it move well it
[1:57:11] didn't move me but i mean i didn't
[1:57:17] lord move me enough to at least let me
[1:57:19] get my hand up
[1:57:21] move me enough lord at least let my back
[1:57:23] go back and my head go back and my lungs
[1:57:26] fill full of air cause i see the finish
[1:57:28] line and i'm here to declare hallelujah
[1:57:32] i see a finish line i see the race that
[1:57:35] i've been running and it's coming closer
[1:57:37] closer
[1:57:38] closer and the world today have you seen
[1:57:41] the headlines they are now saying we are
[1:57:43] so close to a nuclear holocaust as close
[1:57:47] as ever has been and we are afraid
[1:57:51] government officials we are terrified of
[1:57:54] what will happen if there's another step
[1:57:56] well i tell you what i'm not terrified
[1:57:58] because the next step has already been
[1:58:01] ordained of god the next steps in god's
[1:58:04] authority it's not even in man's
[1:58:06] authority some people say mr putin is a
[1:58:10] crazy man but i say my brother and
[1:58:12] sister that he's doing the work of god
[1:58:15] he's doing exactly oh do i do i justify
[1:58:19] that no i don't like that i'm not a man
[1:58:22] of confrontation but my brother and
[1:58:24] sister when the prophet of god said he
[1:58:26] saw america as a smoldering ruin
[1:58:30] was that an allegory
[1:58:33] are we going to say well that was just a
[1:58:34] symbolism spiritual destruction of this
[1:58:37] and that my brother and sister i believe
[1:58:40] it's true
[1:58:41] i believe it's true people are like well
[1:58:43] what about a california fallen in the
[1:58:45] ocean uh you know i used to drive truck
[1:58:47] i'd go down there at an individual i
[1:58:49] won't go into what the deal but they're
[1:58:51] like hey
[1:58:52] you must not believe the profit
[1:58:55] i'm like why
[1:58:57] because you're driving a truck you're
[1:58:58] going to california every week in a
[1:59:00] truck
[1:59:02] okay
[1:59:04] it's gonna fall in the ocean
[1:59:07] i got maybe a little bold to this
[1:59:09] brother
[1:59:10] i said brother
[1:59:12] if i am there
[1:59:14] when it falls in the ocean
[1:59:16] i got greater problems
[1:59:18] than
[1:59:20] my destruction of my flesh
[1:59:23] if i'm there
[1:59:25] oh but what about this and what about
[1:59:27] that my brother and sister
[1:59:29] our job is to not worry about the end of
[1:59:32] this earth
[1:59:33] our job is to see the end of the race
[1:59:36] and to run it get our head back quit
[1:59:38] looking at the ground quit walking as
[1:59:41] though we're depressed quit doing these
[1:59:42] things get our head up and run the race
[1:59:45] that has been set before us run it with
[1:59:47] strength run it with authority run it
[1:59:50] for the result you say run it for the
[1:59:52] result that's right you know my brother
[1:59:55] and sister a man i watched this little
[1:59:57] interview this guy had just been running
[1:59:59] i don't know if it's a marathon or a
[2:00:00] steeplechase or something and the man
[2:00:02] comes in a pretty close second but one
[2:00:04] of the commentators says we saw you
[2:00:06] coming in the backstress and we saw you
[2:00:08] running in the race and and you were
[2:00:10] running and then all of a sudden you
[2:00:12] started fading and they said what
[2:00:14] happened did you have a cramp did you
[2:00:15] have something and the man looks at the
[2:00:17] ground a little bit slumps his head down
[2:00:20] he goes
[2:00:22] well really the truth is
[2:00:25] i realized i couldn't beat him
[2:00:30] he was running neck and neck with him
[2:00:35] i couldn't beat him
[2:00:36] what happened
[2:00:38] faded right out of the race
[2:00:42] oh we come in second place
[2:00:45] that might be good enough won't it be
[2:00:47] brother trevor
[2:00:48] i almost won the race for the rapture
[2:00:56] sorry i hope you guys don't mind i know
[2:00:58] that's not the kind of race we're
[2:00:59] running but if you guys aren't careful
[2:01:00] i'll be kicking dust in your face
[2:01:03] because i'm going to run i'm going to
[2:01:04] run i'm going to run i'm going to run
[2:01:05] i'm going to run and if i can't run i
[2:01:07] will crawl
[2:01:10] hallelujah
[2:01:11] but you know i'm taking your time i'm
[2:01:14] sorry
[2:01:15] when i was first coming back to the lord

[2:01:21] here

[2:01:24] saints i can remember thinking
[2:01:27] lord

[2:01:34] threshold of heaven

[2:02:06] comment on the order of and those of you
[2:02:08] that believe god called you to just
[2:02:10] crawl into heaven

[2:06:21] that thought
[2:06:23] what is his name what is the new name
[2:06:26] prophet gives clarity to it
[2:06:28] people tried to turn it into a doctrine

[2:06:35] are what we're here for
[2:06:37] the purpose and the identity
