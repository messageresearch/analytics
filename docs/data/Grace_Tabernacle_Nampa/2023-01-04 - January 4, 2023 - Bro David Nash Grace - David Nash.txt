original life Let's uh let's just bow our heads gracious Heavenly Father truly it's the original sea the original life you are the vision father and you are what keeps holding me every time that it seems like I I in myself I would go astray somehow with your word that brings me back it's the grace of almighty God in this day unveiled to realize truly that you are that seventh seal and you're unveiled before us as we approach your word this evening I'm asking Lord let the angel of the Lord come with us again tonight seen you do it many times I know I'm in my this flesh Lord there's no good thing even in your own body of Jesus you said there's none good but God so farther tonight come by thy Holy Spirit Quicken each heart and life unto thee we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen while we're standing if we could turn seems like I start in this place a lot for whatever reason to Genesis the first chapter and it's uh not just because it's easy to find but there's so much in just this verse and we'll read a couple different places there quickly before we're seated and we'll read Genesis 1 and 1. I still hear Pages turning that's unusual for where we're starting okay in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and then we'll drop down to verse 26. and it says uh and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea the fowl of the air over the cattle over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the Earth and so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and then one other place over in the second chapter uh this is where verse 21 so 2 and 21. it says and Lord God caused I just want to drop up to verse 18 for just a second it says in the Lord God said it is not good that man should be alone and will make a help meet for him and then we go to 21 and the Lord God caused the Deep Sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh thereof and the rib which of the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man gracious Heavenly Father we've read a great portion of your word this evening it would take us days Lord maybe years to really cover Lord the things of jigs but we ask you tonight to bring it Lord and you said by the quickening power of the Holy Ghost as we come to you in the name of Jesus Christ bless this congregation they're blessed to even hear these things Lord so we let the blessing live in the lives of these tonight and whoever be on the tape land lord may they just receive something to help in this Earthly journey in the name of Jesus Christ amen please be seated brother Paul for having us come tonight I'm glad to be back with you my wife's had a little bug the last couple of days with her stomach and uh and Isaac and Kristen of course she's had the arm thing they took her out of the thing I guess today and said she doesn't need surgery so we're praising the Lord for those things uh and it's uh we were talking the other day or the other night after after service uh last week there and you know people a lot of times they're looking for all kinds of Miracles and I've heard guys even preach oh there's a great day coming and there's going to be this happen and that happened I'm going now wait a second you had two people that were basically supposed to be dead that are alive now and no problems is that a miracle but brother Branham said it won't be a public show this time and yet it's going on all the time you know testimonies just coming out of Central America and we were down there a woman that the doctor said should have been dead on a Saturday or Sunday we didn't get to her till a Wednesday and this was last year when I was there and the Lord raised her up miraculously prayed for her three different times and and the Lord raised her up and by the third time they said she had moved off the bed for 20 days her family was gathered waiting for her to die God raised her up right there my niece was with me she was really excited because she said I've never seen Uncle David I've never seen a miracle before and there was right before us I got to hear her side of the testimony this time when I was down there and she said you know uh I don't know where I was she goes I was in a nice place she could didn't really she goes but I wasn't there but she goes when you guys prayed I heard it and I came back to my body and I said this is a woman that's supposed to have been dead for five days she was it looked like she was I had my ear down there to hear she was still breathing because there's almost no movement she said I came back to my body well we're sitting there and as we were there praying then the rest of the family came in and we started explaining to them what we're doing you know we're here we're you know her pastor is here and we're going to pray for her because the Bible says we lay hands on the sick they shall recover and with his stripes we're healed and and so as we're explaining these things to the family I said why don't we all pray for her as a family so I mean there's a whole room full of them and they're going oh yeah okay okay this is good and so we prayed again she said the second time you prayed with the family she said I felt strength come into my body and that second time we prayed she turned her her head to me and spoke to me and said I have faith and when I saw that we explained we said hey look you know Lord's doing something here let's pray one more time when we prayed the third time she said help me up and we helped her out of the bed helped her across the room she sat in a chair and started barking orders to make tamales for her to get make tamales because that's what she was doing at the time for a job was selling tamales on the streets there in Honduras that was her testimony she said when you prayed I came back when you prayed I got strength when I prayed here am I I got a picture of her if you want to see after service now feeding us some more tamales when we were down there this time so it's happening all the time it's here you're the Bride of Jesus Christ these are Promises of God but if we don't recognize them as promises if we're if we you know just shut ourselves in and think oh this is not going to you know it's not happening or it's going to happen way off there or it happened back there in the you know brother Brad and we say that's a denominational Spirit friends always look into what God's gonna do and what he's already done he's doing it right now and I'm sick of hearing it's going to be somewhere else it's right here the kingdom of God is within us praise the Lord so why did we read Genesis 1. well it starts out there and we covered This I Believe last time that we spoke here and we talked about how if you switch the words around and and how God in the beginning or in God the beginning however you know you can turn those words different ways well who's the beginning well we we studied it out it's Jesus Christ we go to the Book of Revelations there and he says in Revelations 1 and 8 I believe it is I'm the beginning and I'm the ending and it's so in God or in Jesus Christ the beginning God created all things we find that in another scripture it says he created all things through Jesus Christ all things were created through Jesus Christ and he's what in the beginning amen thank you brother somebody's listening Hallelujah and so all things were created by the word which is called Jesus Christ so the very first thing the very first if you want to call it a personality trait of God of what we call God and what and how that even Jesus Christ in the Book of Revelations chapter 3 it says that he is the beginning of the creation of God the Elohim the self-exists in all existent one that that has done all of everything when he began to create himself he creates Jesus Christ how did he create Jesus Christ well how do you suppose he did that friends is the word he literally created Jesus Christ by his word he creates himself by his word now here you know we get overseas I was just down in Mexico heard a lot of different preaching and stuff and I hear guys preach a lot of stuff y'all brothers You Preach whatever God lays on your heart I'm not this is not to put anything down with that but I love it when if this word brother Benham said after the seals every scripture here somehow points us to Jesus Christ and I love it that when I can go into the scripture and how important it becomes to me because roommate says we're there we read it we're Made In His Image what's his image look at yourself what are we or in His image what's that image well I got some of this stuff which sure causes me a lot of trouble it really does because it's Fallen image because it was born in sin which is unbelief it was born because of unbelief you know shaped and iniquity came into the world speaking what speaking lies that's things that aren't true and that's what comes out of this outside man and there's a spirit inside of there this is the we're talking about the image of God and there's a spirit inside of there that makes this stuff move makes it talk makes it see makes it and translates all that stuff into the third part which is the soul brother Branham said the soul is the nature of the spirit and that's why ye must be born again because your first birth into this world came because of what unbelief sin iniquity speaking lies that was your first nature because this is what came first after the fall the flesh comes first brother Ben who explained it very clearly he said how does a birth happen he said well uh you know once the seed comes together and the flesh begins to form that becomes your first husband and then uh he said just before the baby comes on the scene he said what happens the spirit comes to enter that body because that body is going to come and to be alive it has to have a spirit but that flash that stuff came about because of unbelief in the garden and because of that that Spirit when it enters this flesh it's stuck with sin iniquity speaking lies because that's what brought about its birth and so that's what it's and so the nature becomes the nature of the world because that becomes our first husband and that's why I'll say it again I like to say it almost every time time I preach she must be born again you have to meet Jesus Christ so that this soul that we have wins inside of us is converted or changed or it becomes a different seed the spoken word is the Original Seed who's the spoken word Jesus Christ and when you receive Jesus Christ you take on a new seed which begins a new nature to be able to believe what he saw us as before the in Ephesians if we get that far before the foundation of the world he saw us in Christ in himself in the word before the foundation of the world and so it says that when we're in that image we're in the image of Christ he didn't let us make man in our image what did it say there he gives him Dominion right is that where it said it yeah let us make man in our image after our likeness let him have do minion over the fish the fowls the cattle everything upon the face of the Earth we have dominion over when we are in His image Prophet gave us some examples the bull as a man he reached for his gun concealed carry right he's going to do the bull in but his gun wasn't there praise the Lord because then he had to turn to something else and he turned to God he said I love that bull God is love who did he turn to what did he turn to the love of God in Jesus Christ the same one that said God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever that's me I don't care you know hey praise the Lord I hope you all do believe this for yourselves not just for me that's me I'm one of those who whosoevers that's me should not perish but have everlasting life and when he turned to that what did it do he had dominion over the bull go lay down when we come into the image of the word of God in which the bride of Christ is taking on we have dominion same thing I believe it was at the Hornets of the bees whatever it was needs please go back to the to your nest I didn't mean to hurt you that's dominion and it comes as we enter into the image of God into the image of God and so he was given Dominion now and that's Christ that's Christ in the word he had Dominion so what are we looking there we're looking at Jesus Christ who had Dominion over some little fishes over a lunchbox of a little kid feeds 3 000 people that's dominion over the Food Services okay you know you talk about McDonald's turning out a lot of stuff I'd like to see them do that I understand what I mean he had Dominion he had dominion over the sea he had dominion over the weather now I mentioned that it was God creating Jesus Christ by the word did you know it says in the Book of Psalms he has dominion over the storm what was it he's the word of God and the word of God that was spoken back here in a seed form dominion over the seas over the storms Jesus Christ steps out to fulfill that scripture I created that God it was in the heart of God that God would do that when he was in the form as a man you're doing it and I'm not saying this to bring any kind of Glory to me it's the glory of God in Nicaragua a few years ago people still looking for miracles and signs and wonders they're happening in front of faces I don't know if there are for 100 people on a school ground opening our meeting and a storm came up pouring down rain I didn't know what to do brother Sandy Beach was interpreted for me and I looked and there was a flash of lightning and right after the flash of lightning I saw the pillar of fire go past just said speak storm go back to where you came from in the name of Jesus Christ three minutes later you could see the stars I can't do that but that Pillar of Fire can the image of God can and when the image of God came down to speak to those people the word of God he backs it up he will back it up in your life he's still doing it all the time wow I could go on and on with that stuff but it's Christ showing his Dominion in you and me you ever pray for something and God answer it I hope so that's God taken Dominion through your life as the Bride of Jesus Christ that is the seed word of God in you taking dominion over the situation I hope we get three visions I didn't read it yet so I don't have a I have to get there right see brother Paul but then we we read there from 21. and I never noticed this until just recently I mean I've read it probably a few hundred times it starts out there and Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof who's that talking about come on who fell into a deep sleep and they opened up his side with the Roman spear and what did Brother Branham say flowed out the Bride of Jesus Christ that's Christ that is Christ in that verse showing us from the mind of God from the heart the soul of God I'm going to take a bride the same way I'm going to sleep they'll take it out of my side in this butterfail and then what happens well we know what happened that you know in a Calvary brother random said the entire debt was paid everything finished right there was asleep he doesn't know what's going on did he well and when he wakes up what's he got in front of you oh it's a woman it's a woman I have this woman in front of me and where did she come from bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh what's behind this friends you go back to John the first chapter in the beginning was the word was with God I know you're familiar with these things I'm trying to go fast because there is so much I just want to explode praise the Lord and when you drop down to 14 between those first few verses of John and he and it says he was the word and what's the next part and Elijah Ministry and right after that Elijah Ministry what do you see it the word became flesh oh come on Friends the word of God came down he comes to Elijah prophet and after that the Revelation comes the word becomes flesh God is seeking your flesh My Flesh to Shell himself once again he is the word of God and he will have flesh in his likeness Dominion to provide Dominion through his bride that came where out of his side you love him tonight oh my what came Adam gets the revelation I got a woman here what was it Jesus when he's let's I'm a little praise the Lord let's go to John I think it's 17. 17 and 24. Lord Jesus now this is before Calvary we're aware of that and he's this is Jesus and he's praying and as he's praying he comes to this the reasons for why he's coming to this action in verse 23 he has a certain prayer that he makes and as he's making this prayer in verse 21 that they all may be one he was and that was a father Thou Art in me and I and thee and they also may be one in US in US where are we to be in Jesus Christ and he's saying this in his prayer and the glory which you give to me I have given that's past tense that they may be one even as we are how can he say that he hasn't had Calvary yet but he's been giving them my word is a seed and whosoever it's a seed we're talking about this the other night with somebody and there's all different kinds of seeds you take the hazelnuts from Oregon it grows so well over there they do well in really wet climates because that outside thing is so hard otherwise it takes years and years and years just to break down the outside so the seed can be come forth even Tomatoes you all like tomatoes I like tomatoes those that little that gooey stuff on the seed they say that takes two years if you just drop one of those on the ground just for the gooey stuff to go away before the seed can even sprout so when he was back there saying those Parables and stuff he lays a parable about this the parable about that he's laying seeds in the ground front some of them will Sprout like that even to give a parable about that someone Sprout this way some will Sprout on the rock some will Sprout but some of them they really get it they take the seed of the good word of God and they bring forth 30 60 90 100 fold and so it comes down to verse 24. and this father I will that they also whom that has given me be with me that where I am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou loveth me before when did the love of God come on to Jesus Christ I can I can if Paul does this I can do this right give me where where that where I am they can behold my glory which was given to me when before the foundation of the world before the foundation of the world God saw his image in Dominion body or you know only this time that's a reverse order from the soul from the heart that believes the word it moves into the spirit of a man brother Bennett said you know you people that used to go to the bar or to whatever you used to do and you're not doing it anymore he said that's a sign of Resurrection already lives in you it's already there recognize it it's already there it's built there before the foundation of the world by the seed word of God and it's going to bring forth it has to bring forth before the foundation of will but I wanted to look at that word will I will oh my God I brought this out of there's two three three different definitions that I found this in there's of course the different concordances they are strongs and whatever this other stuff I have this one around a long time but I ran across it again last night where he says I will well who's the eye it's Jesus Christ we know that but when he said I will what he's saying is I mind to or I want to it's my intention I am resolved determined or it's going to become my purpose and then you'd start you know BCD how the dictionaries do it's my desire It's My Wish it's my love I would love to do this or I like to do it not time to go to it tonight but love is a commitment that's why when we say till death do us part he means it it's a commitment and so it says I when he says I will it's my love it's well John 3 16. God so loved and now we see the love of God projecting itself through that little word I Jesus Christ now this all of a sudden here we see God fulfilling his own word now in a quick time frame because we just jumped you know a few chapters and we see the I will and it also means to take pleasure in to take pleasure in when he said I will he's doing this out of the love of God to have pleasure spiritual pleasure with a bride that he knew before the foundation of the world who are tonight I hope you're understanding trying to sow some seeds friends of who you are there's tons of scriptures we could go through but let the seed of God come into you and believe these things what he said about you in the strongs that says determine or to choose amen he said you didn't choose me I chose you Jesus Christ chose you we were just lucky enough and have enough Grace to say Thank you Lord you chugged me you Cho you chose me he chose me by his grace and again we see it uh desire intends to love comes up again in that other translation to be pleased with to do it willingly to take for oneself and when you start getting into the root words to take for oneself to choose or elect to an office I'm just quickly going through these he elected you he chose you he chose me to be the Bride of Jesus Christ he chose us and from the the third translation there in the root there it says to to raise up Elevate or to lift up to raise up the ground and I love the last one it said to take up stones Jesus Christ in every scripture friends this is a reality what was the what was the the penalty for adultery pick up stones to kill them and then to burn them with fire kill them pick up stones and kill them and burn them with fire the Bible says that Jesus Christ became sin for you and me he took the full Judgment of God against adultery by a revelation from God that he was the one that's supposed to do it take this body down I'll bring it back he knew what was going to happen and even the burden with fire the Bible said he went to hell I just read it today and he was at first Peter said he went to hell and preached to the souls in prison he took the full judgment of adultery why is that so important why is it so important we could again back to the scripture who do we got back here here's a man called David we find and I think it's in the book of Acts as he was the man after God's Own Heart he wants the very heart of God to be in him he wants to have God's heart in him okay and when the word of Prophecy came to Samuel he says Sam you know why why are you crying over Paul uh Saul for why I I'm tired of that guy you know in modern terms I'm tired of him he don't he didn't have it in him now he was the People's Choice but God says go anoint me a king God is going to provide himself as a king any Shepherd boy Conway Mia King I'm gonna be king yeah he's a little Shepherd boy I know no they didn't want him at the you know at the feast there man isn't there he I'm thinking Sammy was probably having a trial one two three four five six seven he's got that cruso oil going lower I know you told me to come down here and anoint somebody don't you have one more oh man yeah we got one more it's out with the sheep and here he comes you ever smelled sheep especially during breeding or you know birthing season it's pretty tough so well Paul's a farmer he can probably tell you it's not a pretty thing those birthing sheds and stuff and here he comes you're right there into the walks into the room and that's the one that's me God gonna provide himself as a king in flesh what did we see a Shepherd boy goes out the next day here's his army all these scrubby little white looking things with this with his staff here's your king Israel God showing the simplicity of he's going to be born in a manger and who's going to see the birth there were shepherds in the same country keeping watch over their flock by night and God's the shepherd boy to catch the anointing but what really was important was the word that told him you're the next king and that word propelled him into Chronicles where it says Israel and Judah came together and asked David will you be our King and it says they anointed him King over Israel no the child's doing three oh man we're talking about the sin of adultery David did that and did you ever really think about when the prophet comes to him and he what's the story he tells him it's about sheep is David knew sheep and he knew how important they were they were so important to Bartimaeus they were his eyes because they didn't have seen High dogs back then they ate the dogs seriously they did and so they say that Bartimaeus sacrificed his eyes the night before he met Jesus and Jesus said what would you like and he said I want my eyes Jesus Oh my God well David Shepherd he hears the story brother Branham said it showed that David still had a good spirit or heart about him I can't remember exactly how he said it because he gave the proper judgment he said that man ought to die that man should die he knew what it was talking about about and did you ever notice what the prophet said okay now it's not just well I think it was Nathan right is that right was it Nathan a prophet in this Prophet looks at David and what's he say David pronounces his own judgment proper judgment the man should die and Nathan says Thou shalt not surely die he used the exact same words the circle is done Eve and this time there was life in those words because this time it wasn't words of Lies it was the words of God coming through a prophet you'll not surely die well we know David went through a lot of problems because of that but what was it all about it was about John 17 24 I will and he's doing it for the bride because he says in that whole passage there that where I am they may be also that's his desire that's his love that where he is we're there he willed it he loved us he loved us to the point to where he gave himself to go to sleep to have a bride out of his side it's Christ in every word I wish I could find him more places he's everywhere I look preach Christ I just mean not to rebuke preachers but brother Branham said we're not getting him through to Christ and he's the word he's in the endic pages and he can live in you by the Holy Ghost just receive him receive the word of God brother sister get through to Christ he's the word and when he says I will there's something else there about David that you know we don't I we tend not to think about oh wow David was spared sure glad that happened right there was something else what else was involved there the woman should have all been it's also been stoned and burnt with fire and God was protecting that woman because 600 years later so and so begat so and so and Jesus Christ God was anointing himself as king through that act to save that woman an adulteress Modern Eyes of God not the second seed that she bore the first one died because she was her husband was still alive but when the first husband died she could bring forth and she brought forth the lineage leading us to Jesus Christ where God himself is anointed king of kings and Lord Arts you love him I love him another little just to close on that definition part of that to lift up you know to raise up or to take up stones foreign I will I will and it's love and to take up Stones what's so what's another thing he's talking about we're talking about Jesus Christ in all the scriptures God creating Jesus Christ and he's creating Jesus Christ in flesh right now in you and I If you're receiving him that's who he is the word of God it's happening right now might only be one cell tonight I don't know there's billions of them in these bodies but if you get one cell closer to Jesus Christ tonight I'm happy Isaiah said it pretty well line upon line line up online precept up on precept and if you can catch the precept tonight every word of this book carries Jesus Christ in it somehow I'll leave it up to you other brothers to dig out some more because Jesus when Peter and I know you're familiar with this Peter who do men say that I am well some think you're John the Baptist raised from the dead maybe one of the prophets maybe it's just like the message today might be in Jeffersonville might be who knows maybe it's with his brother so and so it's this church or that church or do you stream there would you ask somebody you get on you know wait how message people when you ask them you know are you Christian what's one of the first things they say where do you go to church I don't care where you go to church praise God I'm glad you're here tonight what good it would be well I've preached empty churches before I really have a couple times it's kind of boring for a preacher then I found out there was a Mormon guy standing out the wind outside the window listening I didn't even know he was there but God had me preach 15 20 minutes to posts so that a Mormon guy could hear about Jesus Christ never doubt the Holy Ghost and it also means to raise up oh we're talking about Peter and but who do you say that I am and I ask that question often who do you say that he is who do you say that he is because that's what's really important who do you say that he is I say he's the Christ the son of the Living God he's the word of God he's my everything he's my all what else is there that's what nothing he said in another place are you guys are going to go too where else are we gonna go where else can I go you are the words of eternal life and but Jesus said you know Peter I'm going to call you a rock now Simon and on this Revelation you know Flesh and Blood did not reveal this to you it was a revelation brother Brian taught us this you know I know you're aware of this and how did it's not a rock there it's not Peter it's the Revelation that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God it's the Revelation brother Brandon said you need we need to pray for Revelation more than you could possibly imagine because when and he said on this Stone you know not even the gates of hell you know brother Paul was telling us about the gates been there seen it it's all those different religions not one of them can Prevail against the revelation of Jesus Christ and he said on this Stone I'll build my church on this Stone on the Revelation that Jesus Christ is the word of God he's building his church right now he is receiving you unto him as you receive him and you are becoming like him and we are being placed into the very image of God so that God can have your flesh to use what was part of that prayer in John that they might behold my glory and when you pray and God answers he gets Glory out of that when we see a miracle a storm go away whatever it is even the weather warm up a few degrees oh God I'm freezing to death can you just warm it up a little bit gee whiz the weather departments it was going to be like 12. and wound up 25. I know it seems foolish but it works not because I can do it but I can ask he said you ask just don't ask different stuff okay or we'll get it all mixed up it's got to be in one mind and one one Accord right so praise the Lord the last part of that definition is to lift up or take away or to raise the voice who was the last voice in this age well it was we think of it as being the prophet of God no it wasn't it was the message of the hour it was Jesus Christ in a prophet where's that voice supposed to be living right now praise the Lord look at those hands praise God you are the final voice friends and he's going to raise the voice whose voices are you going to use we talk about rapture we call it Rapture I've never seen that word is it in the scripture you ever seen it I don't think it's there not that word body changes a moment twinkling eye those things quickening power is and when Jesus went to the tomb of Lazarus she had great Doctrine your brother shall rise again that was a prophecy from the voice of God your brother shall rise again and she said yeah I know it Lord at the resurrection at the last day Pharisee denominational spirit he's dead if you'd have been here back then he'd be alive and I know he's going to come up there Jesus said no no the word always corrects the error the word always corrects the error and brings us back to Jesus Christ he said I am the resurrection Aaron I'll bet her eyes went what Boeing and the life he that were dead and believeth in me yet shall he live and he that is alive and believeth shall never die and he asked her a question do you believe it that's what it hinges on Friends it's not way off in outer space somewhere the kingdom of God is within you and the last voice of this age is in the Bride of Jesus Christ who are we speak God spoke and brought forth Man In His Image and that image is to be the word of God and that word is to become flesh again and he wants to raise up the stones what are the stones Peter on the your rock and I'm going to build my church on that rock of Revelation I'm just I'm just telling you scripture hey feel free to correct me brothers sisters but I'm telling you what this word says okay what time are we looking at oh man Ephesians I mentioned that we'll close with Ephesians there's a lot of more stuff We're not gonna get too praise the Lord that's I hope you go home and look this stuff up I got into Ephesians recently because brother random said Ephesians parallels Joshua I believe it's in the adoption series I hear some amens on that praise the Lord so let's look at the first chapter we started out this message with in the beginning God created so the very personality of God is to create things and he creates things by Jesus Christ who is the word of God and you know that Joshua dealt with the children of Israel and Joshua you know when brother Brown says Ephesian parallels Joshua so that means it's run side by side Joshua was for them Ephesians who's it written by First Church age Messenger to the Gentiles or the alpha revelation okay I understand that right so in Joshua what was the point they had been living the law under the words of Moses and it had been Moses's voice had pretty much been in control of everything because God told him you go down to deliver the people I'm gonna be there whatever you say is going to happen Red Sea split Red Sea splits he said you already spoke it why are you crying to me you say water to blood there's the blood you say Locus there's locusts or whatever bugs whatever they were and so that was in control but all of a sudden now Moses my servant is dead a person dies what happens to their voice and I'm not saying get rid of the message that's not the point here not at all I'm saying that message has moved brother random said Joshua it's a type of shadow of the Holy Ghost and if that message is not living In You and I it don't matter how much how dry that Jordan River is you're not going to be there where you know we have to become the voice of God to this last day not because we're claiming something different than what Moses told us because he said no you got to do what Moses told you the Joshua this time you speak you speak Joshua and what was that it was the Crossing from the law and to Total Grace I gave you the land Joshua believed that 40 years before that because him and Caleb were the only two when everybody else said oh we can't go we're grasshoppers please no grasshoppers here tonight but Joshua and Caleb said no let us go up at once he has given us the land past tense it's already ours God made him wait 40 years 40 years and he had to watch all them other people die that's the Joshua part now what about as we close Ephesians Paul First Church age messenger Apostle Foundation person right Foundation is to be Apostles and Prophets so on Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God there's that word again will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus which the first church page we know that but it goes to somebody else too and to the faithful in Jesus Christ that's me is that you tonight are we the I believe you are I wouldn't be preaching this kind of a message here we'd be preaching salvation you're the faithful in Jesus Christ so this book is for you it's for me it's for everyone who wants to cross into another land next thing he says grace to you and peace from God our Father from the Lord Jesus Christ when he says Grace be unto you and peace isn't an interesting Jesus said I give you peace which in a way the world is going to know what this is but he says Grace I give you Grace and we may have to stop here because I really don't want to keep you late I know it's tough you guys are working and stuff and but I want to give you the I took this one I didn't check this word here to be make sure it's the same you know letters or numbers that they have but Grace when it comes in verse chapter 4 verse 7. let me read it so you understand where I'm getting but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ okay here he says I give grace to you and peace he's speaking it into existence it's there but you gotta fight for it it's there there's a kingdom there but we got to fight for it there's a kingdom of Grace there's a kingdom of peace because in the beginning God created and there's creative power behind every single word if it created Jesus Christ Behold a virgin shall conceive did she conceive you bet she did what was it God creating by the word a virgins 400 years later whatever it was to conceive and you could go scripture after scripture after scripture and they all point us to Jesus Christ God creating the beginning of the creation of God and we were in him while he was asleep and when he wakes up then the Revelation starts hey I have a bride I died and I went to this prison and and here I've got a bride now she's a woman brother Brandon said she's a glorious perfect woman right of Jesus Christ and the word Grace there okay god-given her god-gifted or committed brother Branham said the strongest thing you can do as a Christian is commit something to God that means you lay it on the altar so that's it I'm going to walk away and wait and see what you do with it Lord might not hurt to look over your shoulders sometimes just to see what's happening I have a hit tendency probably to do that too much but it's a commitment you lay it on the altar say Lord here it is I commit my children to you I commit my disease or this disease or this person or my job or whatever it is you commit it to God and the last part of that where it says Grace Joy pleasure loveliness sweetness and if you want to break it all the way down it says to Rejoice to be glad it's a greeting it's cheerful God bless you that's Grace do you love him his joy unspeakable and full of Glory sister go ahead and come maybe we'll see that here in a minute if you're there I'm we'll have to quit joy unspeakable it's Joy and there's that word pleasure again Revelations 4 sure that's what it is let me double check four and eleven we'll read that and then finish 4 11. Thou Art Worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou Hast created all things who created all things Jesus Christ this is the revelation of Jesus Christ that says in line one of the Book of Revelations it's his Revelation and he's speaking it so we can receive him so we can receive it in the last part it says and for thy pleasure they are and were created and that comes through Grace the grace of God shadow bar Upon Our Hearts and when you're breaking into the next level it says to be well it's a farewell and it's also a greeting when this I think I'm pulling out the wrong one I am uh well it'll work you all are familiar with this picture right where did that picture originate go ahead sister yeah but what state did it what's the letters that we put on the mailbox if you're sending something to Arizona hmm do you think it was a greeting because the prophet said you got to turn it this way isn't it interesting even the the article Christ on Sunset Mountain but you know when brother Branham came out and preached it just after that because we were all asleep he said if you turn it this way it's the rising of the sun it's a greeting and it's hurt by and it's also a greeting and I in one of these articles this has a bunch of the articles in it that were written in the different magazines and I believe they said the last place that was seen was over the state of Hawaii what's the significance could it be that the fact it was the 50th state and 50s of Jubilee and that they have this strange greeting aloha you know what it means hello you know what else it means bye-bye where we live in France foreign Grace and it's all Grace and it's all in that word grace I'll quit I have found God give me a key sister I'm getting horse I have found his Graces all complete he supplies everything [Music] as I sit and learn at Jesus feet I am free yes free indeed it is joy unspeakable and full of Glory [Music] and the help has never yet been cold I have found the pleasure I once craved is joy and peace within where's it at wondrous blessing I am safe from that awful guilt of sin I am joy unspeakable full of Glory Full Of Glory Full Glory it is never yet been told I have found that hope so bright and clear living in the Realms of Grace face his presence is right here I can see his smiling Joy Joy Of Glory Full Of Glory Full Glory it is Joy speakable and full of glory and the help has never yet been told I have found the joy no tongue can tell how it waves up Glory rolls hope it is great A great or flowing well stringing up within my soul what stand it is Joy speakable and full Glory Full Of Glory Full Glory it is joy unspeakable glory and has never yet been told one more time it is Joy speakable and full of Glory Full Of Glory for Glory it is joy unspeakable and full glory and the half never yet been told him tonight if you don't get nothing else and I say this often out of a service fall desperately in love with Jesus Christ he is this word somehow somewhere pray that these other brothers they will find Jesus Christ for you in these words they are ministers and they have the Bible calls them flaming flaming angels and what's that fire and you know if you have this Grace unspeakable I never thought of it but you know what's in that seventh seal there's things you can't even speak the thing that amazes me too is how God with paradoxes how he does things so there's a place I was reading I don't even remember because I A lot of times I'll skip from different tapes or I'll start one and forget where I was at and start a different winner or else even same thing with scriptures that I believe is brother Brandon saying you know what's interesting about it is that it's when you're at that lowest point and you're going through all the fiery trials and the struggles that's when Grace appears and what's Grace it's Joy it's it's joy that no matter how bad the trial is friends I am a redeemed creature Jesus Christ through Grace wants to live in me he wants to live in you he loves you and he wants to give you Dominion over your prayers he will he's already done it he's just waiting for us to say hey can I can I take dominion over this you sure can as long as you can find a reasonable answer in here it's yours there's a song I don't know if you hang on to that song there sister but you know somebody was talking about finances it seems we got hit pretty good recently with some things that came up you know and we have an adversary and I don't even like to give him any credit I try to speak as little
