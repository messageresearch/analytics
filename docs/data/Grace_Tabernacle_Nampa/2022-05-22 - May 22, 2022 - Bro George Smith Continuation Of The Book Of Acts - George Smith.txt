morning and see each one of you from different places this is kind of like what the that'll be all the music yeah your husband does a good job it's kind of like what heaven's going to be like so from here there's something you didn't expect you know see what are you doing here how'd you get here's the question but it's good to see all of you and um to know that god is calling his people from everywhere we don't have the option god knows what he's doing so he's in charge of the whole program you can see from before eden to way out the other way and we're just a little peace now we can't change what happened yesterday it's gone if you did wrong lord forgive me come on in sisters we've got plenty of seats right up front here and um you can affect tomorrow by what you decide today so we have this slice of time to deal with don't worry about the rest right now so let's turn into second corinthians chapter four let's see here this is brother paul speaking and today we're going to continue in the study of the book of acts the book of acts is our road map this is how it all started paul was the first messenger he's setting things in order and uh there's a lot of similarities between between the first messenger and the seventh messenger and so all we're called to do is recognize our position in the scripture and over 200 times brother m says back to the word and if you'll remember the promise in malachi he's going to return elijah's ministry was always to bring back to original amen so ii corinthians chapter 4 verses 5 and 6 for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake so we're only public servants there's no man in charge nobody's managing the bride no we're just his servants for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ not in paul not in george not in william branham in jesus christ let us pray father we thank you for your grace we thank you for bringing us all together here this morning we pray lord that you would minister to each one minister to me lord give me my portion and as we go from here later that we could all take a portion and shine the light wherever we go help us now in jesus name amen you may be seated so we thank god for the beautiful weather you know i look on the phone i see where they're having a tremendous heat wave across america well it's not here we're still running on the heater but god has been good to us and um we thank him for his grace now open your bibles to the book of acts last night we finished chapter 20 and we will rehearse just a little bit for all of you that had other things to do last night but um at the end of chapter 20 we have paul um uh saying goodbye to some people because he was he was determined to go to jerusalem for the feast and he knew what he had to do he knew that god was speaking to him now he had people along the way that he was seeing oh don't go you're god's servant they're going to kill you they're going to thank you i've got to go anyway so in chapter 20 of acts in verses 18 through 35 we have the farewell speech to the believers the church leaders and he um he knew that he had to go he wasn't fearing for his safety but if you look at verse let's see chapter 20 look at verse 25 and now behold i know that ye all among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more he's dismissing himself from them this this you're not going to see me no more now he was the one that brought the gospel to them by order of the lord and now um he's got to be honest put the happy face on and move on you know verse 27 for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god i've told you everything i know and look at verse 28 take heed there for you unto yourselves and to all the flock you know he's speaking to the church leaders the pastors and sunday school teachers and such over which the holy ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of god not to waste time not to be pulpit clowns like brother random said but to feed the flock and you all are very fortunate that you have a pastor that feeds the flock he's not out wasting time he's not you know spending your money going to disney world he's feeding the flock which he had purchased with his own blood for i know this that after i leave grievous wolves they're going to come in and cause trouble and divide things and even among your own selves there'll be men speaking perverse things drawing disciples after themselves we're not looking for a following i don't want anybody to follow me brother brown wasn't looking for a following paul sures are looking for a following just follow the word you know but there will be those that come along yeah i've got the answer i'm going to control you it's happening therefore watch remember that by this space with three years every day and night with tears i ministered to you now brethren i command you to god and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified and he goes on to dismiss himself from them in verse 36 and when he had thus spoken we kneeled down now remember he's on he's in a boat he's coming down the coast of the mediterranean stopping a couple different places to see the saints well it's not like today they had a they had maybe a little dock of some kind the boat stops and they go into up on the beach a little bit they sent people up there hey go bring the brother we're down here so they're having a little meeting on the shore just in the sand there he said we kneeled down prayed to them all and they all wept sore and fell on paul's neck and kissed him sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake that they should see his face no more and they accompanied him onto the ship goodbye this is their father in the gospel messenger of god and they actually never saw him again later they received a letter that he wrote from prison in rome which we know is the epistle to the ephesians so in chapter 21 the sea journey continues you know and it began in troas that's chapter 20 verse 13 they were going towards jerusalem now obviously anybody knows anything about the map jerusalem isn't a port city okay so that's where he's headed but um they land at a place called tyre currently in lebanon and ministered to the saints there for a week 21 verse 4 and finding disciples we carried there seven days who said to paul through the spirit that he should not go to jerusalem now these people are serious these are prayer warriors and they know that things are going to you know get ugly don't go it's going to be bad for you you know and so verse 5 and when we had accompanied those when we accomplished those days we departed and went our way and they all brought us on our way with wives and children till we were out of the city and kneeled down on the shore and prayed now it's it's pretty tear-jerking when you realize that they're not going to see these these people anymore not going to see paul and we can just see i'm just so glad we have a scripture full of details somebody took the time to write all this down you know for us to learn from you know and so uh they went on their way and um they um came down to a place in the scripture in verse 8 to caesarea caesarea is still here today those who have been over there with me we go to caesarea this is where this port was and you know from there up to jerusalem so in caesarea there was believers that was the home of philip the evangelist we saw him back in chapter six and in verse nine it says and the same man had four daughters virgins which did prophesy so here's the fulfillment one of the fulfillments of joel 2 28 your daughters shall prophesy and was manifested in this in this family verse 10 21 it says and as we tarried their many days there came down from judea a certain prophet named agabus now this is important to notice because i just heard a preaching the other day of a good friend of mine good brother and he's saying that from paul uh until william branham there was no prophets well i'm sorry the bible says there was so we'll just believe the scripture you know and so um this prophet came down named us and when he was come unto us when he came amongst us he took paul's girl and that was a it was a clothing that they had back then and he bound his hands with it and his feet and he said thus saith the holy ghost so shall the jews of jerusalem bind the man that owns this girl and shall deliver him into the hands of the gentiles it's not sounding good is it and when we heard these things both we and they that of that place besought him not to go don't go paul they're going to hurt you then paul said what may need to weep and to break my heart for i am ready not to be bound only but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus now that might come to our doorstep one day are we serious enough about this are we just just happy enough yeah god sent a prophet please god i've got i've got a seal book there's a little more to it than that people this is real and the good times are behind us and just because gas is over four dollars a gallon that's only one little sign things are going to get really really bad you better know where you stand and be able to say with paul hey so they take everything away i'm ready to die for him you know we've got to take this really serious so we're preaching from brother random's absolute okay the holy scripture most of you have a black bible i have to have a read one today you know um and so uh the gospel is not complicated you see now every one of us have at least one dollar in our pocket right some of us have some coins some have a five a ten some might have a hundred dollar bill but you have to know when to get which out and when to use it if you're going over to 7-11 and you're going to buy some bubble gum you're not going to get the hundred dollar bill out normally you get out the one dollar or whatever so when we administer the gospel we've got to give it as needed you see first corinthians chapter 2. look at that real quickly because i'm not making a lot of these things up you know first corinthians chapter 2 is a very vital scripture for us um we were in second corinthians earlier but first corinthians chapter 2 verse 1 and brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or wisdom which he could have he was a very intelligent person declaring unto you the testimony of god for i determined not to know anything among you only jesus christ and him crucified so the gospel is not complicated it's very simple but the bible is full of all kinds of things to feed every person brother branham says we have believers that are we have christians that are a nickel some are a dime some are quarter 50 cents five dollars ten dollars so we have different degrees and when we're preaching to a mixed crowd like this there's all kinds of people and some people stayed up last night who knows what they were doing others you know slept uh we we have people that came ready to hear the gospel so after many warnings from good friends and you know very spiritual people even a vindicated prophet there agabus um paul and associates they arrived in jerusalem verse 17 they were welcomed warmly when we were come to jerusalem the brethren received us gladly acts 21 17 okay so from there um verse 18 and the day following paul went in with us unto james and all the elders were present so here's the apostles and this is james from matthew 4 21. now james was a popular name back then because we have james the apostle brother to john the two sims of zebedee that's matthew 10. then we have james the apostle uh son of alphaeus matthew 10 3 also known as james the less you wonder why because he was shorter than his brother you know like david the less you know known as david taller you know so that's why it says that there is james the lord's carnal brother of matthew 13 and james the father of judas the apostle luke 60 6 16. so in recent times some scholars have brought it down to two but there are actually five so in jerusalem paul meets with the apostles and church leaders and he tells of the many mighty things that were accomplished in the missionary trips so they were pleased they glorified god and this could have been as late as 56 a.d or 20 years after the day of pentecost okay just being put in order and they they said to him now look brother um we have a situation here in jerusalem this is verse 20 through 25 and you're aware you know that thousands of jews have believed and they're all you know very zealous of the law but they have been informed about you they know who you are and they're they're watching out for you and they they have been told that you tell the jews out there among the gentiles to forsake prophet moses well he never said that if anything he said this is the fulfillment of what moses said and he says and you've been telling them not to circumcise the little boys he never said that and uh to forsake the customs of the law no just put it in order and so they go on you know and they say you know there's no secrets they know who you are they've heard these rumors so he says we have a plan all this is in here let's kind of condense it for you and it says we have four men that are willing to take a vow now that's a real honest uh promise take them with you purify yourselves pay for their haircut it was important back then and and then all the people will know that these things are false if you do these things you see and showing yourself to fulfill the law and that you obey it so in verse 25 answering some of the questions and providing guidelines for the believing gentiles but in 26 he says here then paul took the man and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification until that an offering should be offered for every one of them okay obeying the law of moses following the advice of you know the lord's disciples but once again guess who showed up the twin and brother brandon put it in other words he said in every congregation we have three kinds of believers now it's really easy for us to look you know uh oh you know who that we know which one to use the question don't worry about those other people which one are you maybe when we get to lunch after a while if the lord tarries and y'all behave and we'll see who's commenting on you know the bald preacher or whatever we'll know which one you are so um so the twin appeared because they're always going to be there you see you can always count on until the day of the rapture they'll be nearby look over to first corinthians chapter 10. and don't ever come to church without your bible first corinthians 10 13 says there has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man in other words you're not the first one that suffered this whatever you're going through everybody a lot of people before you suffered but god is faithful who will not allow you to be tempted above that which you are able to bear but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it wherefore my beloved brethren flee from idolatry now what's idolatry got to do with this other verse because idolatry is everywhere i know people carrying this king james bible and their little you know fancy tablet and books they're idolaters they're not true believers they're idolaters the only difference between us and the catholics catholics have a candle we've got a little electric light on the on the wall it's the same spirit sorry so uh beware of idolatry back to church chapter 21 of acts verse 27 and when the seven days were almost ended the jews which were in asia when they saw him in the temple stirred up all the people and laid hands on them that wasn't in blessing that means they grabbed their hide and they're gonna take you to the law that's what that means crying out men of israel help this is the man that teaches all men everywhere against the people and the law in this place not true and furthermore brought the greeks also into the temple which was you know not proper and has polluted this holy place for they had seen before with him in this city um tromphimas and ephesian who they supposed aha they were guessing they didn't know that paul had brought him into the temple so here's another riot in jerusalem we just had a few you know in the past chapters here's another riot in jerusalem there's great confusion just like the riots that we've had in our country confusion there's no order no respect no nothing they grabbed paul and the plan was to kill him right there because we killed this man we can solve all this you know this problem that was their plan and they were going to beat him to death verse 31 and as they went about to kill him news came unto the chief captain of the band in other words chief of police that all jerusalem was in an uproar so mainly because of a rumor a supposition that's why the this uproar you know meanwhile someone went and reported the activities to the captain the chief police and he took a bunch of soldiers and went to check it out what's going on here we're trying we're trying to keep order here in jerusalem you know and when these people saw him coming they quit beating paul so the soldiers restrained him paul they put him in chains why is that well they asked who he was what this is all about and the crowd began shouting all kinds of accusations some contradicting each other nothing was understood so the captain ordered okay take him back to headquarters for his protection you know so due to the violence of the people uh and these aren't communists these aren't you know no these are religious people these are people that study their prophets words perfectly but this guy we don't like him because he's he's not like us he's he he used to be with us he used to persecute the christians but now he's on their side we've got to kill him they put him in they took him to headquarters and um and uh when they were going up the stairs into the building the people shouting and that he should die no evidence only supposition confusion okay take a break here look at first corinthians chapter four yeah we're going to go back and forth fourteen first corinthians 14 33 what do we have here um 33 for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints so if you're in town or if you're in a so-called message church and there's confusion you might want to just take your bible and go back to the car because that is not of god and some of us have been in those kind of meetings rebecca and i walked out of more than one service while it was going on because it's confusion all in the name of the message amen okay back to our story acts 21 so they were so blindly loyal to their religion what they thought to be truth quoting their prophet ready to kill anyone who did not exceed exactly things their way they were blind fanatics we still got them sad to say so they were ready to die and ready to kill for their view of the god of yesterday we got the same thing going on today right now sunday totally ignoring what god was doing present tense not interested in what the future might be they were content with forms rituals quoting verbatim but no life quoting verbatim doesn't bring life willing to kill anybody with a different view now that isn't just the muslims okay that's branamite sometimes i've been around the world i've seen some of them so the revealed word was a foreign concept to them you see all they cared about what did prophet moses say you'd be surprised the prophet the calls that me or paul gets when you know families go along they're not paying attention they're not pen ties they're just kind of drifting you know and then they get in trouble their children get in trouble of whatever kind first thing i want to say what'd brother rhyme say well honey you're a little late for that you know this isn't the time for for band-aids this is time for major surgery so but very selectively they ignore parts that were not convenient to their views and of course back then no actual recording you know so where are we at here you see god's word is never stagnant it's moving it's moving just like that canal out there that water's moving all the time all these plants that are growing they're growing every day you see that's god's word it's always moving it's the truth only truth that you can depend on because the scripture says heaven and earth all this is pretty all it's nice it's all going to burn people all the bibles are going to burn amen but my word is established in heaven and it shall remain forever so the word of god is living it's moving and god will find someone through whom he can make it come alive he all he needs is yielded vessels yes lord thy will be done not what i think no no so he has no hands but your hands these are you know god can operate through your hands through your eyes your mouth your feet but we got we must be totally yielded for him to use us to be able to use this you see and um brother branham was a born seer a prophet that came down through go listen to that first tape uh faith is the substance april 1947. he starts off yeah god moved orbits somehow to bring this gift to the earth in 47 he's not he's telling you that that happened years before and he's basically telling and y'all not paying attention that's it you know and here we are today so he was born a seer but god could only use him properly when he was yielded completely and it was obvious something different about this boy but when he came to the foot of the cross then god could use him so you want to quote what he says i'm just a sinner saved by grace that won't be quoted today in a lot of places and god can withdraw his mercy from me at any time he desires so let's quote it off we're going to start quoting so what about us do we think we're somebody special because we've come to a certain level of life because we've got a good pastor because we've got our little tablet we've got our stuff does that make us special no only thing that makes us special is that god has trusted you to live out your portion of the drama here in laodicea the darkest age of all see all the saints of all the ages are depending on you and me to live out our part of the drama and not give up you see because they without us laid asia are not made perfect so may god have mercy on us okay back to our story acts 21 37 where are we at let's see here um and as paul was led into the castle so he's on the stairway all these people are screaming and shouting and he's in chains he's taken in for his own safety as he's going up the stairs he said to the chief captain may i speak to you and uh and the captain says oh you can speak greek they don't know who he is see even not he didn't look like anybody special and um art aren't you that the egyptian came a few days and made an uproar and led people out to the wilderness four thousand men and that must there were murderers aren't you that guy paul said i am a man which i'm a jew of tarsus a city in cilicia a citizen of no mean city and i beseech she suffered me to speak to the people now here's at least 5 000 people out here screaming and hollering they're mad they're ready to you know stab somebody can i speak to him and when he had given him license paul stood on the stairs lifted up his hand to the people and there was great silence he's speaking to them in the hebrew tongue so he's at least two or three languages the man is intelligent so quite a story we can make a movie out of those last few verses so what did paul look like at this point he didn't look like a preacher he was bloody he's tattered very scroungy he quieted the crowd it's a religious crowd without a microphone he began to tell his story chapter 22 men and brethren and fathers hear ye my defense which i make unto you and when they heard that he spoke the hebrew tongue to them they kept them more silence now silencing a angry mob is not easy all they want to do is kill him they're screaming so he's got him quiet now they're real quiet because he's speaking their language i am verily a man which am a jew born in tarsus the city of cilicia yet brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel okay and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers and was zealous towards god as ye all are this day in other words i'm just as zealous for the truth as you all are pay attention and i persecuted this way unto the death i had helped kill many many christians binding and delivering into the prisons both men and women so he tells the story on through the chapter let's pick it up in verse 17. and it came to pass that when i was come again to jerusalem even while i prayed in the temple i was in a trance in other words like in a vision you know and i saw him saying unto me make haste and get thee quickly out of jerusalem for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me it's jesus talking to paul and i said and i said lord they know that i imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them and believed on thee he's talking about our family yeah those were our relatives back there that he helped kill and he's aware of that 20 and when the blood of thy martyr stephen was shed i also was standing there and consenting unto his death and kept arraignment of them that slew him so remember back in the early chapter i told you he was a young man and all he did was was keep the stuff and they're throwing the rocks but he was part of it and that stayed in his mind till his last day and he said unto me depart i will be with thee hence uh unto the gentiles in other words it's time to turn the corner and they gave him audience unto his word and then lifted up their voices and said away with such a fellow from the earth for it's not fit that he should live in other words he's taking up too much oxygen get rid of him now he's just told him the truth give him a bare bones testimony they still want to kill him and as they cried out and cast off their clothes and threw dust in the air can you imagine they are violent the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle in other words into the headquarters and um that he should be examined by scourging that he might know where they cried so much against him now scourge means to harass to whip severely with no mercy in other words we're going to beat the truth out of you one way or another because what you said right now didn't seem to solve the problem look at it they're still they're still mad so from chapter 21 paul is in jail for his protection from religious fanatics and since the jews were so upset with him he must be guilty of something i mean this this roman uh police he doesn't know nothing you know he's got to keep order so what do we have here 25 and as they bound him with thongs that don't get too excited thongs words have changed meanings here that it was a long leather strap that they used to bind him like a straitjacket keep him in custody okay and the chief doesn't know who this is or why the people are ready to kill him and so this roman officer just a public servant has no revelation no interest in the fanatical religion of the jews that's their problem but he's responsible for the peace of jerusalem so he has to get to the bottom of the problem paul said unto the centurion that stood by uh is it lawful for a roman uh is it where is it out here is it lawful for you to scourge in other words whip unmercifully a man that is a roman and uncondemned we got a problem when the centurion heard that he went and told the chief captain uh you better be careful this man is a roman then the chief captain came and said unto him um tell me sir you're a roman yes and the chief captain answered with a great uh he said with a great sum of money i obtained my freedom and paul paul said i was born free i'm a roman i'm born free then straight away they departed from him which should have examined him in other words all these guys with their whips and things the chief captain also was afraid after he knew that he was roman and because he had bound him in other words it might come down on my head got to be careful so in 2230 he can't figure this out by himself and he wants to find the truth so he called together the high priest and his counsel let's go over here and see let these guys examine him now this is what we call the sanhedrin okay it's the high court of the land it's a group of 71 members divided into three groups this is very complicated but it's the truth there's the chief priests the elders and the scribes they were the religious rulers and they interpreted moses law and made the decisions but they could not issue the death penalty and they're still there today the high court of israel interprets they won't there's no death penalty but they'd make all the decisions even to divorce and so forth so the high priest presided over this nation's highest administrative judicial body right below the high priest in rank was an exclusive group of 200 pure-blooded jews and below those were 200 was another 7 000 or more just ordinary priests and all these men could trace their roots right back to aaron they had it done perfectly and um the first high priest you know brother moses and they were divided into 24 priestly clans in each group served a week at a time in the temple so you can get the picture these people were in charge but under the watchful eye of the romans okay and only the romans could administer the death penalty so they had to work together okay it just so happens that this is the fifth occasion when these men with all the power are called upon to render an official decision regarding the claims of christ and his followers concerning his very person they wished it would all just go away you see but it's not still here today yeah they wish to all go away and why because jesus christ was and is the fulfillment of the words of all the prophets you see that these people claim to follow that they had memorized they memorized all this stuff and here's the man fulfilling it all done that up we don't believe that can't be got to kill them and so they were falling into the letter of the law but they failed to see the manifestation that's why the catholic church looks at romans it looks at matthew 19 28 19 in the name and right today the pope has an audience got you know twenty thousand people what jesus said yeah but where's the manifestation of it what life is that produced nothing so they were just on the wrong side you see on the blind side of the issue very good at repeating what their prophet said but zero revelation and ready to punish anyone with a different viewpoint especially if there would be some manifestation of the words of one of those prophets they want it in cold stone they don't want to see life that's it so they had so where's i told you it was five minutes there was the fifth occasion first they had jesus himself on the stand luke 22 and when he was on his way to calvary to die for you and me that's when they it was the first time that this uh this group of men made a decision after the healing of the lame man at the gate called beautiful peter and john were questioned by the same tribunal but what power and what name have you done all this in acts chapter 4 and then the apostles you know they had a marvelous meeting manifestations of the power of god acts chapter five number four was the trial of the death of stephen yeah chapter six and now 20 years after the crucifixion paul is facing this same court different individuals but the exact same spirit only more corrupt and more arrogant chapter 22 verse 30 says and on the moral in other words the next day because he would have known of certainty whereof he was accused of the jews this is talking about this this uh chief of police guy here he loosed him of his bands and uh commanded the chief priest uh and all their counsel to appear and brought paul down and set him before them so here's paul hands free here's the court you know the high court and puts them before him and he's on trial and we're going to move ahead because we've got plenty of time nobody has to go anywhere for lunch it's downstairs and a little fasting would do you some good so the scene is paul standing before the high council 23 verse 1. and paul earnestly be holding the council so he's looking at the council eyeballing all these people men and brethren i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day with his opening statement he establishes the foundation i've been honest you know see god knows that none of us are sinless we all got problems see but he calls for us to be honest if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us first john chapter one as paul stood before this hostile council he could honestly declare that he had a clear conscience yes he had killed a lot of people but he came to repentance if you if you study the life of david you wouldn't want him anywhere near your family but david knew how to repent you see he had a clear conscience so honesty and clear conscience are not the same as perfection okay another thing to consider paul was by no means perfect he was totally forgiven and was honest about his failures as we'll see later so in a total fit of anger okay you got the scene he here's paul and here's his counsel and he's i'm clean so in a total fit of anger um he says here what happened in verse two the high priest ananias commanded those that stood by him you know the guards smacked that guy in the mouth knock his teeth out you know yeah and um then paul remember how brother branham described him he wasn't no saint it's like the the jews they you know they study uh elijah when from babies on and they say now now elijah was a nice guy but you didn't want to push him too far so here's paul where brother madam says he was he hooked nose high-tempered sarcastic jew so when he gets smacked in the head totally surprised he loses his cool from in it then paul said unto him god smite thee thou whited wall you sit up there to judge and smites me contrary to the law ooh we've got a problem here so then the court flunked in chapter in verse 4 then they stood by said are you reviling god's high priest are you speaking against the man and paul apologized okay i'm sorry he said uh verse 5 i didn't know brethren that he was the high priest for it's written quote in scripture thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people but when paul perceived that the one part of the sadducees and the other pharisees so he discerned there was a division there he cried out to the council men and brethren i'm a pharisee the son of a pharisee of the of the hope of the resurrection of the dead i'm called in question and when and when he said uh had said that there arose a dissension between the pharisees and the sadducees over here and the multitude was divided so we've got more confusion for the sadducees say there's no resurrection neither angel nor spirit nor nothing you know and the pharisees confess both and there arose great cry and the scribes that were of the pharisees part arose and strove saying we find no evil in this man that if the spirit or an angel has spoken to him let's not fight against god i mean they release no common sense and when there arose a great dissension the chief captain fearing les paul should have been pulled in pieces commanded the soldiers but had been changed taken back to prison he said no this is crazy people don't even know what you believe and the night following the lord stood by paul and said be of good cheer paul no problem for as thou has testified of me in jerusalem so must you bear witness also at rome now he paul can't see the future but god was faithful okay we have this problem here you're gonna testify also in rome see god was confirming his eternal word matthew 28 20 i am with you always even to the end of the world amen we're not there yet it's still out ahead there so when you think you just got on your last string i'm with you always okay so verse 12 and when it was day certain of the jews banded together okay so now they had this uproar and all this confusion so the next day some of the jews got themselves together and under a curse not under a blessing saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they hit kill paul that's pretty serious we all know we've got to have some water got to have some food you know you get angry and you get you lose your mind you know and that's about where they were and there was about 40 of them it says here that made this conspiracy and they came to the chief priests and elders and said uh we have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have slain paul now god's elect have been under assault since the garden of eden yes sir that's right it's bible and cain he was so mad i see just look at that for a minute here's cain and abel the only you know children at that point as far as we know there was obviously some others but anyway there's these two boys they were religious they knew to worship god they built a nice altar you know this one's got flowers and pomegranates and watermelons all kinds of beautiful fruit and flowers and over there is just some rocks and they're worshiping now the first thing you want to remember those parents never told the children the whole story of what happened in the garden if they told them all that would be no revelation to it so they didn't tell them the whole story so here they are worshiping god and god comes down and blesses abel with his slain lamb and all his blood and all this you know nothing pretty here and the other guy is all upset because and i went to all this effort and grew all these vegetables and all this stuff and you're blessing him and and so god says that's true and if you'll do the same i'll bless you he gave him an open door and he said i don't care i'll do it my way so remember this see he wasn't balanced he was off way off someplace and so he refused got so mad he killed his brother and so they just simply had a different revelation they believed differently to get here today you had to come by a lot of churches they're much prettier much taller got better seats probably but they have a different revelation they're going the wrong direction you know and the spirit of arrogance cannot stand it when there's at least bit of opposition to their way of thinking you run into people like that they just can't stand it you know the christians can mostly get along in this world they live and let live but the muslims want total domination and i'm sorry if some of you got relatives that are muslim but you know that's the truth i got friends in south africa and this one lady says yeah my sister she's got the little romantic dot you know and and and she bows five times a day and oh so holy what comes out of her mouth ooh so it's very dangerous you see the jews just to take their side for a minute they are one part muslims are 999 parts but they can't stand that one part they want to wipe that off also so the bride is not looking to just get along but to live out our part of the drama and live on us before god and he will take us home according to his promise okay god will unfold his word right on schedule because none of us was looking for elijah we were busy in our denomination or our drinking whatever we were doing that was far away god had mercy shined the light across us because we were born before the foundation of the world was something in us it came to light you see but um according to his promise he fulfilled it so he unfolds his word right on schedule and now you're you're on the path you see so don't try to figure it out just be faithful and obedient on a sunday morning brother branham stood in the pulp and he said and you people with these saw blade tempers it's always spouting off the mouth at somebody can't put up things like that be careful you're guilty if you speak a word against your brother a word that's not right not just go around and tear down you don't have to stick a knife in a man's back to kill him you can break his character and kill his influence okay so that's spoken in 57 what about 2022 how does that happen by running your mouth without a filter in john 12 let's look at that real quick we're just having sunday school nobody's in a hurry john chapter 12 and verse 9. what do we have here 12 and 9 much people of the jews therefore knew that he was there he said this is over mary and martha's house and they came not for jesus sake only but they might see lazarus whom he had raised from the dead okay verse 10 but the chief priests consulted that they might put lazarus also to death well wait a minute aren't you guys happy that this is never y'all never saw that in your church here's a guy raised from dead you want to kill him again get rid of this it's crazy because but that by reason of him many of the jews went away and believed on jesus well thank you lord same things happening today so now here in the book of acts in early church they continue under the same evil anointing kill and destroy so back over here in 23 that we're at these these 40 people in verse 12 they're very serious okay a total fast we're not going to take one bite until paul's not breathing let's see how that unfolds chapter 23 verse 14. okay they came to chief phrase we're going to want to kill him so forth 15. now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain in other words you know you talk to those other guys bring him down tomorrow as though you were to inquire something more perfectly firm in we want to retrial here and we or ever um he comes near another door when he when you bring him out of the castle we'll take care of business we're going to kill him when he comes down and and when paul's sister's son oh so he's got family so here's his his nephew heard them saying this that they're laying in weight these 40 guys he went into the castle and told paul hey uncle guess what and paul called one of the centurions and he said bring this young man into the chief captain he's got something to tell him so he took him brought him in and he told him the story and he told him don't tell anybody else 19. the chief captain took him by the hand when i went aside privately uh what is this you got to tell me and he said the jews have agreed to desire the that that would bring paul down tomorrow to the council as though they would you know have further inquiry but do not yield unto them for their they are lying in weight forty men and uh one twenty two so the chief captain then let the young man depart and he said see that you tell no man uh or show them these things so in verse 23 um we have another you know they got to do something because they're after paul so verse 23 they prepare 200 foot soldiers okay 70 soldiers on horse and 200 armed with spears on foot it's 470 tough guys in uniform with their stuff to protect one prophet it's right there verse 23. they put paul on a horse also and they're going to take him to governor felix down in caesarea now paul got off the boat in caesarea and went up to jerusalem now there's trouble they're going to send him back now today you can do that in about less than an hour because he's got a four-lane highway and even have a train but back then it took a while over the mountains and so forth and so they took off in the dark you can read it carefully all 470 slowly to a place about 40 miles from jerusalem to rest the next day 400 returned to headquarters and the 70 on horseback continued with paul over to caesarea and so now they got him down there not exactly in jail but in confinement with pleasant surroundings okay and uh you know paul didn't put no clock up here so who knows what time it is uh 11 52. okay uh you're not sorry yeah we're going to go in one more chapter food's not done yet so 24 verse 1 and after five days ananias the high priest descended with the elders and with certain orca that means a lawyer named tertullus who informed the governor against paul so five days after he arrived here comes the high priest his entourage all these guys and their lawyer tortulas and in verse two he flatters the governor with great words we have enjoyed great peace and prosperity due to your wonderful planning we're so thankful but we have a little situation sir this man and so they invented some accusations that amounted to name calling he profaned our temple the governor could care less about the religious problems and so we grabbed him and uh we were going to judge him according to our law yeah beat him to death but your man the commander took him from us under great violence simply rescued him the ordinal violence involved and so um so he thought it best that you yourself should judge the case and all the jews said yeah amen yeah right mr chartreulis we all agree so here we have paul on trial for his faith standing before an angry arrogant religious high council the roman governor in caesarea in the years about 57 a.d so governor felix gives paul the nod to say his peace 24 10. then paul after the governor had beckoned him to speak answered for as much as i know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation i do the more cheerfully answer for myself in other words you understand the whole thing about the jews so i'll speak for myself okay verse 11 because that thou mayest understand that there are yet but 12 days since i went up to jerusalem to worship and they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man neither raising up the people neither in the synagogue nor in the city neither can they prove the things that they now accuse me of but this i confess unto thee he's talking to the main man after the way which they call heresy i worship the god of my fathers believing all things not just the gods and elijah not just not believing all things that are written in the law and the prophets in other words we believe all the words amen okay and um have hope towards god which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust and herein do i exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offense towards god and towards men now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation and offerings you know i came in peace whereupon certain jews from asia found me purified in the temple neither with multitude nor was tumult no no problem who ought to have been here themselves before thee to object if they had ought against me or else let these same here say if they have found any evil doing in me while i stood before the council except it be that of this except it be for this one voice that i cried standing among them touch touching the resurrection of the dead i am called in question by you this day if that's the problem yeah but all this other stuff it's crazy so the governor wasn't so interested in the fine points of the religious laws of the jews he was simply protecting god's man of the hour from death at the hands of the most religious people on the planet the sadducees and the pharisees they knew it all they had the pedigree and they had the attitude to prove it you know john the baptist said generation of snakes generation snakes in the grass dangerously moving amongst the crowd jesus said blind leaders of the blind and many other things matthew 23 now paul on trial for his beliefs in 24 14 uh we just read all that yeah so um here's governor felix having you know somewhat understanding of the way of christ more than a lot of people he granted an injunction he said when the chief priest chief of police comes down we'll review the case have a nice day everybody go home yeah verse 23 he commanded the centurion to keep paul and let him have liberty and that he should forbid none of his acquaintances to minister or come to him so he's kind of in minimum security you know and a few days later governor felix and his wife drusilla invited paul over for lunch he's over there in somewhat of a prison like invite him over for lunch asked him more about the christian faith and paul didn't hold back you asked he expound to them regarding righteousness holiness judgment that is coming and there was such an anointing present that the governor was fearful and trembled and he was moved by the power of god through the words of a gospel preacher but he put it off just like a lot of people today sitting right here probably you can go now i'll call for you when it's more convenient i've got a lot to do today in other words i have priorities i run into that every day with people well yeah but i've got to do this good well what about the gospel what about feeding the hungry what about some of these things that are you know people falling off the earth we can help well when it's more convenient friends there's no more convenient time than right now you're sitting under the power of the gospel you get with the program you have no guarantee of making it out to your nice car now you see this level's got more than one purpose it's here to remind me to stay level and to remind you when i see anybody drifting off see it sometimes works some people stayed up too late last night so so when god is calling and pressing you for an answer now is the proper time now a long time ago the year 1955 the uh people of hollywood produced the ten commandments i'm sure most of you have seen him so some people at the tabernacle in jervis will snuck off to new albany and saw the ten commandments now the theater was about the size of this church they didn't have big things like we have today small screen anyway so they come back and oh brother graham you've got to see that man ten commandments is great so he takes uh himself his wife and rebecca and they go to see the ten commandments that's rebecca's nine years old at the time and so boy they're sitting there you know and they're watching ten commandments and so they they were under such a um a powerful anointing when they made that film that when they they designed the pill or fire brother brandon thought it was the real thing coming on the screen well he jumps up and takes his hat off oh it's just a film okay so he sits down but then on the way home after the four-hour film uh nine-year-old rebecca being very sensitive was the crying well honey what's the matter you know did you see this film yeah but dad of course to her was more like a newsreel you know and she um she said now over there when when moses was was uh telling people all that's on the lord's side come with me well with those words we're watching the ones come with him but she was a little bit ahead of the program she's watching those that stayed behind and she said god wasn't just hey those people were thinking about it they were trying so he stops the car well i guess we'll make this a teaching moment now when god shows you to do something you do it now now when you feel right now one grandma says it's okay and all that no you move now you see you might not get a second chance so in our story here the governor sent from paul on a regular basis they had lunch you know twice a week probably and they had a limited fellowship but we never read about the governor actually accepting christ or being baptized he just liked to talk about it we got people like that today i like to talk about it and debate those details each meeting he was really hoping for what to get closer to god to learn more no he wanted some cash just like today just follow the money trail you see it's right there verse 26 he hoped also that money should have been given to him of paul that he might loose him wherefore he sent for him the more often and communed with him hoping that paul would you know catch the vision hand over a hundred dollars so this went on for two years from 57 to 59 a.d so then the governor's term ended and another one took his place but felix being a politician left paul in prison in order to please the jews and make himself look good and uh with some people it's all about appearance yeah oh yeah we to look good to the public you know very little substance but god demands a correct order of priorities and with the believers jesus christ is always first place anything that comes between you and god is an idol you see so we have an entire study on idols and idolatry so forth but that is going to finish our study for today and we're going to give you a break because we've got a few chapters left and maybe i'll come back sometime soon and finish it up but in the meantime read your bible go see if all these things be true let's stand together we need a musician i don't know anything about music but we'll walk in the light [Music] we'll walk in like such a beautiful life comes where the dewdrops of mercy our bride shine all around us by day and by night jesus [Music] the world once again we'll walk in the light such a beautiful becomes life the new drops of mercy are bright shine all around us by day and by night jesus the light of the world [Music] so thank you for your attention may god bless you and pray for me as we go home tomorrow back to tennessee and from there on god knows where and when my next trip that i know will be to south africa in july and uh just pray that god will open the proper doors i've seen him close doors open doors we don't have the power of you know knowing all things but god does let's pray heavenly father we thank you for your grace today we thank you for being with us in the study of your word and father your prophet told us if we don't see christ in every verse we need to read it again people ask him how do i get closer to god read your bible and pray so that's what we try to do and to make christ real to the people bless your people now keep us safe and fathers we go downstairs now to fellowship in the natural we pray that you bless the food sanctify it bless those that have gone out of the way to prepare it and father we just pray that you bless each one help us in jesus name amen you're dismissed [Music] do [Applause] you
