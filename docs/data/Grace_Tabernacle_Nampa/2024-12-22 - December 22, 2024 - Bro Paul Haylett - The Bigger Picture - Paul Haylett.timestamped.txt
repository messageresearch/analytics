[28:00] brother Chris and the family will be
[28:02] traveling uh for the new year uh going
[28:05] back and ministering and I always get it
[28:07] confused it's Indiana right not
[28:10] Ohio um I looked on the map and you can
[28:12] find the same name of a town in Ohio and
[28:16] so I'm always like ah anyway they'll be
[28:20] they'll be gone for uh I think a couple
[28:22] weeks two weeks so let's remember them

[28:27] grand family uh in Arizona with family
[28:31] also at this time and anyone else that I
[28:33] maybe missed that will be gone and I
[28:36] think brother vasile is still out on the
[28:38] road uh but let's remember him in prayer
[28:42] amen and uh just very happy have sister
[28:47] Alice sister Andrea uh here with us and
[28:51] um the family is here complete Amen
[28:55] brother Terry sister Shelly the boys
[28:58] just a good time when the family is all
[29:00] together and I think we take this over
[29:02] into a spiritual realm the family is
[29:05] together this morning amen that we stand
[29:08] here as as Brothers and Sisters in
[29:11] Christ not just a
[29:13] terminology but it should literally be
[29:16] our our heartfelt thought for one
[29:18] another as we're here with the family
[29:22] amen so so good I hope you didn't come
[29:25] this morning thinking you were going to
[29:27] hear a Christmas
[29:28] message brother Chris and I was just
[29:31] discussing that he shared with you there
[29:33] that that you know um my brother and
[29:36] sister Lambs are born in the
[29:37] spring we have to take what brother
[29:40] Chris said just a little further the
[29:42] denomination has lock the Sheep up in
[29:45] the
[29:46] dark and then declared when the birth
[29:49] was their own self but they didn't
[29:52] follow nature they didn't follow the
[29:55] word and so it's there that they have to
[29:58] to now put you know brother Chris I I I
[30:02] Google that real quick does it snow in
[30:04] Bethlehem does it snow in Jerusalem does
[30:07] does and it's very rare they say but
[30:10] remember it used to snow
[30:14] here so we can't you know people want to
[30:18] take today like see it don't happen but
[30:20] you know Lambs are born in the spring
[30:24] that's right amen and we as Sons and
[30:27] Daughters of God
[30:28] Lambs amen a new birth amen and God has
[30:32] given it to us in due season and the
[30:35] spring time of our lives uh is is such a
[30:39] beautiful time a time for us to be able
[30:42] to to just take the word amen thank you
[30:45] so much enjoyed the song service our
[30:47] musicians amen Allelujah we want to
[30:51] remember that causes me to remember our
[30:53] sister via who no doubt at this moment
[30:56] is having a time of her life
[30:58] uh you know I imagine uh just from Human
[31:02] Experience I imagine that Auntie is just
[31:05] a little more liberal than Mom and Dad
[31:07] and uh so she's probably just really
[31:10] having a good time let's turn in our
[31:12] Bibles I want to speak to you this
[31:14] morning on the bigger picture and I
[31:17] think sometimes we we get too small of a
[31:21] view and and we start to look at a very
[31:24] small picture and you know sometimes uh
[31:28] the very uh size of the picture
[31:30] influences you on your comprehension of
[31:34] it and uh you can take a picture of a
[31:37] picture and not see the whole picture
[31:39] and so we want to be able to see the
[31:42] whole picture because that's what was
[31:43] promised that it would be in this hour
[31:46] that the mystery of Jesus Christ would
[31:49] be revealed amen not a little portion of
[31:52] the mystery but the mystery and so we
[31:56] stand here today believing God has given
[31:59] us a Clear Vision a clear uh
[32:01] understanding of the mystery that is
[32:04] being revealed has been revealed being
[32:06] revealed in us and I pray the Lord just
[32:09] helps us see the bigger picture let's
[32:11] turn in our Bibles this morning to job
[32:15] the first chapter verses
[32:17] 6-8 and um I I trust that uh when I'm
[32:21] all done today it will it will be
[32:25] understandable amen that God would come
[32:28] um you know sometimes we we just as
[32:32] ministers I have to say that uh it might
[32:35] surprise you how many times that a
[32:37] portion of the picture gets revealed to
[32:39] us while we're trying to preach the
[32:42] picture and we're up here going wow I
[32:45] didn't see that and of course you know
[32:48] being Humanity we're not going to come
[32:50] and say man this is just beond me I try
[32:52] and explain this to you BL no we just
[32:55] preach it because that's God stepping in
[32:58] the room that's right and when he steps
[33:00] in the room and says no the picture's
[33:02] bigger than you even
[33:04] Minister then he gives that and we all
[33:08] walk away rejoicing and I say thank you
[33:11] Lord for that kind of a spiritual
[33:14] experience that the Lord desires to give
[33:16] to us job the 1 chapter verses 6 6-8 now
[33:21] there was a day when the sons of God
[33:23] come to present themselves before the
[33:25] Lord and Satan came also among them and
[33:29] the Lord said unto Satan whence comest
[33:31] thou then Satan answered the Lord and
[33:33] said from going to and fro in the earth
[33:36] and from walking up and down in it and
[33:40] the Lord said unto Satan hast thou
[33:42] considered my servant job that there is
[33:46] none like him in the earth a perfect and
[33:49] upright man and one that feareth God and
[33:53] esth Evil Heavenly Father we just ask
[33:56] you this morning open your word father
[33:58] let us see the bigger picture Lord
[34:01] certainly we are in that picture
[34:03] according to your word and father we
[34:06] just love you thank you for your grace
[34:08] and mercy to us today that we can come
[34:11] not of who we are or what we have done
[34:14] but to come father knowing that father
[34:17] you have desired and chosen to express
[34:20] yourself in US Lord we desire to be that
[34:24] expression we desire father to be the
[34:27] word coming alive in this day we ask you
[34:31] to lead us and guide us in the name of
[34:33] Jesus Christ amen you may be
[34:40] seated as a scripture says the day that
[34:43] the sons of God come to present
[34:47] themselves and you know my brother and
[34:49] sister um maybe it was a Sunday just
[34:53] like this maybe it was a time that that
[34:56] uh sons of God God were just coming in
[34:59] to worship to to come have their needs
[35:04] prayed for to lift one another up in
[35:06] prayer to have that support for each one
[35:09] of us to to worship God and and be
[35:12] encouraged have you ever uh uh uh just a
[35:15] just a moment here do have you ever
[35:17] found it easier to worship when you're
[35:20] around people who are worshiping it it's
[35:22] like a a a a encouragement to us an
[35:26] influence in our life that we see people
[35:28] reaching out praising God and maybe we
[35:32] come to church today and I'm not saying
[35:34] this negative but maybe we come with
[35:35] burdens today that are weighing our
[35:38] heart down but the moment you get in
[35:41] this and start to worship with the
[35:43] Saints something breaks loose and you
[35:45] find that that burden that you are
[35:47] carrying yes there's still the
[35:49] circumstance there but it no longer has
[35:52] such an influence on us and if you come
[35:55] in whether it's a church or somewhere
[35:57] else and you're in a a room full of
[36:00] people with Doom and Gloom we sometimes
[36:03] just jump right in with them and uh you
[36:06] know everything is woe unto me so I'd
[36:09] rather be in the house of God worshiping
[36:12] with sons and daughters of God together
[36:14] lifting our voices to the Lord and
[36:17] praising him and so maybe a Sunday just
[36:20] like this and Satan came to church and
[36:23] uh be honest with you what the prophet
[36:25] has taught us we look in the word
[36:27] somewhere in the building Satan's just
[36:29] waiting to to have his moment but my
[36:32] brother and sister we're here in the
[36:33] name of Jesus Christ and I say this as
[36:36] as not boastful but we just bind you
[36:39] Satan amen we bind you we're here today
[36:43] to worship God we're here to receive the
[36:46] word today not be bound sitting in the
[36:48] house of God so we bind you Satan in the
[36:52] name of Jesus Christ amen now we don't
[36:55] do that to believing that we and of
[36:57] ourselves have this ability but the word
[37:01] Jesus Christ has declared that if we ask
[37:04] anything in his name he will grant it so
[37:08] we don't have power but we have
[37:10] authority amen so we can loose the power
[37:14] by The Authority granted to us by our
[37:16] Lord Jesus Christ isn't that wonderful
[37:19] amen that we can make our claim on the
[37:21] word and God will honor that claim amen
[37:24] so Satan came to church that day and you
[37:27] know know I always find it interesting
[37:28] The more I've been studying on job and
[37:31] reading these and reading different uh
[37:34] things about job I always find it
[37:36] interesting you notice that the Lord did
[37:39] not rebuke Satan for coming to
[37:43] church my if it was in my human thoughts
[37:46] we would meet him at the door and uh and
[37:49] we would have I say this jokingly we
[37:52] would have today brother Ivan the big
[37:54] guys you know brother Ivan brother Terry
[37:56] would meet him at the door and toss him
[37:59] out but you see God didn't rebuke him
[38:01] for coming and so it's there in fact God
[38:05] comes down and starts to have a
[38:07] conversation with him what have you been
[38:09] doing now remember at one time they
[38:12] Fellowship together and God knows the
[38:15] very nature of Satan Satan thinks he
[38:19] knows the nature of God and I want you
[38:22] to hold on to that because it will be
[38:24] become an important component uh of what
[38:27] uh we're fixing to talk about for a few
[38:30] minutes you see Satan thought he
[38:32] understood God and he thought if I do
[38:35] this God will do this but you see Satan
[38:38] was mistaken and so we'll realize that
[38:41] the very nature of humanity under this
[38:44] kind of an influence we are there my
[38:46] brother and sister now let's remember
[38:49] Cain and Abel as much as we would say
[38:52] Okay Cain's over here and Abel's over
[38:54] here but my brother and sister they were
[38:56] birthed in the same family be with me
[39:00] Humanity not the same father but the
[39:02] same family of humanity they went to
[39:06] church they gave offerings they had an
[39:08] altar they they did everything so
[39:11] similar that there's a good possibility
[39:13] if if you and I in the early stages of
[39:16] that relationship were there we would
[39:18] not have been able to tell the
[39:20] difference between Cain and Abel amen
[39:23] they brought their very best offerings
[39:25] they brought their very War their very
[39:27] best clothes all of these things that we
[39:30] as humans in our comprehension think are
[39:32] important but it's there that one
[39:34] understood
[39:36] God and one thought he understood God
[39:40] and so in that realm of thinking that
[39:42] they understand then it tends to
[39:45] influence the direction of one's life
[39:48] and the train of thought that one has
[39:50] and we have to be careful because this
[39:52] can be so subtle that that we don't
[39:55] realize you know I I just share this
[39:58] real quick I don't want to be long today
[40:00] but I will be uh but my brother and
[40:03] sisters it's like a story at the end of
[40:04] World War II one of the very last uh
[40:07] bombers that had been made uh towards
[40:10] the end of World War II uh was the
[40:12] latest of technology and it was over in
[40:15] Italy and uh when the war was over they
[40:17] said we don't want to destroy that plane
[40:19] a little history tidbit they pushed uh
[40:22] thousands of planes in piles and turned
[40:25] them into scrap metal and so so they
[40:27] said we want to keep this plane this is
[40:29] the latest of technology and so these
[40:32] men who had a stellar record as as a a
[40:36] uh Bomber Crew were commissioned to fly
[40:38] that plane back to the United States and
[40:41] as they left and and uh it was very
[40:43] cloud cover and and very uh uh uh kind
[40:47] of poor weather you might say you know
[40:50] they took the readings with the
[40:51] instruments the best they could and and
[40:53] you know those bombers could not fly
[40:55] from Europe to the United States without
[40:58] adding fuel and and azors was a place
[41:01] that was uh you know one of their major
[41:03] bases they took their
[41:05] readings when the cloud cover would
[41:07] break they would try to take another
[41:09] reading but when they got to the place
[41:11] that the azors should have been it's
[41:15] nothing but empty
[41:20] ocean take that spiritually yeah I'm not
[41:25] here to end up in empty
[41:30] ocean and so the Navigator who is a very
[41:34] excellent Navigator starts in a hurry
[41:38] because they're at the very least of
[41:40] their fuel down to nothing and he starts
[41:43] taking readings and he starts mapping
[41:45] them on the deal and doing that and now
[41:48] this takes a man who has confidence in
[41:50] himself to tell the pilot turn these
[41:53] degrees we've missed it by 80
[41:56] miles and and they turn and the pilot
[41:59] says I hope you're right because in 80
[42:01] Mi we'll be landing in the ocean if
[42:04] there is no
[42:06] island
[42:07] but as the plane is coming down to
[42:10] almost almost absolute empty they spot
[42:14] land now my brother and sister I want
[42:17] you to take that little thought today
[42:20] and I want you to hold on to that
[42:22] because at the very best of our ability
[42:25] we miss the mark yeah but
[42:29] Christ Our
[42:32] Navigator comes and says time to change
[42:37] course yes sir time for us to stop what
[42:40] we've been looking at and to look at
[42:43] what I want you to look at and make the
[42:46] correction you see we're not Sinners and
[42:49] unworthy because of the fact that we did
[42:52] not set the right course
[42:54] absolute but it's God's love and grace
[42:56] and Mercy to us that he says I
[42:59] understand how easy it is to miss the
[43:03] mark see we talk about the mark of the
[43:06] high calling in Christ
[43:08] Jesus and we set sometimes such a high
[43:11] standard for oursel that everything that
[43:13] comes short of that Mark we beat
[43:15] ourselves up and Satan's right there at
[43:17] church to beat us up also but it we're
[43:21] here as Sons and Daughters of God with a
[43:23] promise that I've never lost a one amen
[43:28] and I won't start now amen so God's
[43:31] always correcting our course and he
[43:33] doesn't we might call it sin we might
[43:35] look out as as ministers and say well it
[43:38] looks like this person this family has
[43:40] missed the mark but my brother and
[43:42] sister remember it's God not us that's
[43:45] in control amen so we say thank you this
[43:49] morning thank you Lord for the fact that
[43:51] you set our course straight and bring us
[43:53] to the mark of the high calling in
[43:55] Christ Jesus amen men we shouldn't be
[43:58] nervous about this we shouldn't be
[44:01] sitting here this morning worried about
[44:04] missing the Rapture amen we should not
[44:06] be sitting here worried about I'm going
[44:08] to make a mistake oh I'm nervous about
[44:11] this what we need to do is be constantly
[44:14] saying Lord correct my course amen cuz
[44:18] it won't be in us it will be in Christ
[44:20] alone and so as he sets our course and
[44:23] directs us my brother and sister we come
[44:26] to the place that we come to the house
[44:28] of God and present
[44:31] oursel and the Devil Comes
[44:36] also you
[44:42] see God had a conversation with Satan
[44:45] that
[44:46] day just like he's having one here this
[44:51] morning and we kind of tend to think
[44:54] that we want to keep the devil out of
[44:56] church you see my brother and sister let
[44:58] me just say this it's not about keeping
[45:00] the sin out of your
[45:04] life are you with me it's about keeping
[45:08] the Holy Ghost
[45:10] in we were born in sin shaped in
[45:13] iniquity this flesh will never be
[45:14] perfect but God has given us the option
[45:18] the ability to keep the Holy Ghost in
[45:22] amen and so as we stand here today sit
[45:25] here today we read realize that the Lord
[45:28] knows just what we need you know it's
[45:30] just a little bit difficult for us to
[45:32] say uh I I'm looking forward to the next
[45:35] trial in my life but you see God is
[45:38] going to allow that to happen because he
[45:41] uses those trials to mold us amen we
[45:45] don't want to go without trials because
[45:47] if we go without trials it means we are
[45:51] unmolded that's right I don't want to
[45:54] stand before God with no character at
[45:56] all no faith at
[45:58] all amen we're not going to We Can't God
[46:03] would never present us on that day in
[46:06] glory to those saints that are so battle
[46:08] worn and scarred and here we are in our
[46:11] presstine never never been touched
[46:15] condition that's right you're going to
[46:17] face the battle why don't we put on the
[46:19] whole armor of God and just face the
[46:21] battle say Lord whatever it is I know
[46:25] that you in me I will
[46:29] overcome and then take that and move
[46:31] forward amen amen
[46:34] so I think the beauty of this and also
[46:37] the irony of this is the fact that we
[46:42] have the open word amen right we have
[46:44] the open word today God has spoke to US
[46:46] Open the word and you can look if you
[46:49] study we're all different I'm not
[46:51] advocating you start digging into all
[46:53] this stuff out here but my brother and
[46:55] sister I feel as a min sister then that
[46:58] to a degree I say to a degree there was
[47:01] a time I really dug into some of that
[47:03] stuff and my own wife I'm not throwing
[47:05] her under the bus I'm stating a fact to
[47:07] you my own wife said this is affecting
[47:10] you I backed up from that I don't want
[47:13] Leo de seea to have the influence in my
[47:15] life I want Jesus Christ the word to
[47:18] have the influence in my life but still
[47:21] as a minister we we go out and we start
[47:23] to look into the camp of the enemy and
[47:26] and we Advocate everybody trails along
[47:29] and and tries to come and look into the
[47:31] camp of the enemy but my brother and
[47:33] sister you'll see as as God leads us in
[47:36] these things leads us along of this we
[47:38] get to see uh the the Beauty and the
[47:41] irony as I said of this and and uh we
[47:44] have the open Word and in spite of the
[47:48] open word we still
[47:55] struggle it's not an accusation
[47:57] it's not to condemn anybody I think it's
[47:59] just a simple statement of fact that
[48:02] we're living in the age with the most
[48:04] open revealed word
[48:07] ever but Satan's also at the Pinnacle of
[48:11] his
[48:12] power so the Lord knew exactly what it
[48:15] would take the trials we would face
[48:18] everything that would happen that would
[48:19] cause us to react in a certain way and
[48:22] remember my brother and sister the law
[48:24] of physics for every action there is an
[48:27] equal or opposite
[48:29] reaction and so God's out here looking
[48:32] at us and and we go through a trial and
[48:35] and how many of you you know I'm I'm not
[48:37] judging in this but how many of us you
[48:40] know have said woe is me in the last six
[48:42] months amen I I I tell you I I've said
[48:45] woe is me so much that I got tired of
[48:48] hearing me say woe is me and so you look
[48:51] at that and sometimes we just simply
[48:53] don't realize what is happening and so
[48:56] so the the struggle is real and we look
[49:00] at that acknowledging the struggle is
[49:02] real we don't want to look at one
[49:04] another and say man they're really
[49:05] struggling because it might be your time
[49:08] next week that's right and we look at
[49:11] this and and if we look close you'll see
[49:14] that job was not much different than you
[49:16] and I we look at job and the words that
[49:19] that God spoke about job he was just and
[49:22] upright and and uh God was was very uh
[49:25] uh compliment entry of job yeah but I
[49:30] want you to look at the word study the
[49:31] word pray about it you'll see that God
[49:33] has spoken those very same words he
[49:36] spoke about job he has spoke them over
[49:39] you amen we're not sitting here today as
[49:41] a castoff or the left behind uh we are
[49:45] not The Wanderers in the desert we are
[49:47] Sons and Daughters of God that are made
[49:50] perfect by the word of God in this hour
[49:53] and that's what God wants you and I to
[49:55] believe but there is a time in the storm
[49:58] that we would think oh God will remind
[50:00] me who I am today but he says I already
[50:03] told you it's up to you to believe it
[50:06] and hold on to that if we so easily let
[50:10] go of what God said about us and who we
[50:13] are then all the rest of the promises of
[50:15] God are in Jeopardy also so if you
[50:18] believe that you are saved you need to
[50:21] hold on to your identity just as strong
[50:24] if you believe you are healed you need
[50:26] to hold hold on to your purpose Justus
[50:28] as
[50:30] strong God's not wanting us to walk
[50:32] around in spiritual Amnesia he wants us
[50:35] to walk around in a confidence of who we
[50:37] are and our purpose for being here on
[50:40] the Earth
[50:41] today amen isn't it
[50:46] amazing job was really honestly not much
[50:50] different and let me just throw this in
[50:52] it's out of my thought but it's there
[50:53] you realize that you're not much
[50:55] different than Enoch that's right amen
[50:58] but but I make mistakes did God say
[51:00] Enoch never made a mistake God said that
[51:03] he pleased God Amen he didn't say he
[51:07] never made a mistake amen and if God
[51:10] ever made Enoch so perfect that no one
[51:13] could attain to that and he has that
[51:16] obligation to you and I that's right so
[51:19] could we without being arrogant or proud
[51:22] or boastful today say truly the very
[51:24] words God spoke over Enoch spoke over
[51:27] job he has spoke over us he's speaking
[51:31] today telling us who we are amen but you
[51:35] have to believe it amen so we look at
[51:38] this isn't it
[51:42] amazing we're happy when life is
[51:47] good how you doing today brother praise
[51:51] God life is so
[51:54] good but cloudy eyes rough
[51:59] Seas a little sickness a little
[52:02] financial troubles a little of this a
[52:05] little of that how you
[52:07] doing well we think about okay we got to
[52:09] live our testimony
[52:16] here it's good
[52:19] brother I feel
[52:23] blessed nobody believes you
[52:27] the devil certainly is
[52:30] rejoicing am I speaking to
[52:33] you okay that's good because I was
[52:35] actually speaking to me so look at this
[52:38] my brother and sister when when life is
[52:41] good we we are happy but when things go
[52:44] sideways we struggle to understand why
[52:48] God is allowing this to go
[52:51] sideways we stop you realize that's
[52:53] exactly what happened with job life was
[52:57] good God speaks to Satan and tells him
[53:00] this is my servant he's good he's
[53:02] upright he's righteous he's everything I
[53:04] want him to be but go ahead I'll open
[53:07] the Hedge and and job now went from life
[53:10] being so good and everything he laid a
[53:12] hand to God blessing that till all of a
[53:15] sudden his children are gone and all his
[53:17] possessions are gone and his animals are
[53:19] gone and his buildings are blown away
[53:21] and I guess what would be a tornado and
[53:23] my brother and sister suddenly job is
[53:25] like man what did I do wrong but it
[53:27] wasn't about just what job thought about
[53:29] that equation everybody job went to
[53:31] church with yeah starts to look at that
[53:34] same equation saying what's wrong with
[53:37] job what did job do while we were all
[53:41] sleeping surely job must have been off
[53:43] doing something that became a secret
[53:48] sin and we know as I've preach on here
[53:50] in the church that God saw one little
[53:52] speck in job and said you know job is
[53:55] upright he's right rightous he's holy
[53:57] he's everything I want but you know my
[53:59] standard this is the Lord speaking my
[54:01] standard of perfect and the standard of
[54:04] perfect I've held here they're just a
[54:07] little bit different so I want to bring
[54:09] job up to my standard I'm not going to
[54:13] to just let job go because he's more
[54:16] righteous than anyone around him the
[54:18] most righteous man in the land I I'm not
[54:21] going to leave job at that place just
[54:23] you're the most righteous job God says
[54:25] I'm going to bring you up to my standard
[54:27] cuz you were created in my image see we
[54:30] can read the scripture and say oh that's
[54:32] right okay we can have kind of a vision
[54:35] when God said you were created in my
[54:37] image that God In the Flesh when he
[54:39] manifested himself which we know this as
[54:42] Jesus Christ had Eyes Ears Nose fingers
[54:45] feet whatever oh that's the image no my
[54:48] brother and sister God had entirely
[54:50] different image that he created man in
[54:53] an entirely different image that he
[54:55] called bride to than just looking like
[54:58] this out here I don't want to go and be
[55:00] negative about that out there but that
[55:02] out there has every attribute going back
[55:05] to Canaan Abel they've got an altar
[55:08] they've got an offering they've got
[55:09] everything but my brother and sister God
[55:11] said I want something that is
[55:13] perfect come on we ought to be able to
[55:16] say Amen this morning because God has
[55:18] called you to a high calling in Christ
[55:21] Jesus not just a calling but a high
[55:24] calling that puts you at the Pinnacle of
[55:26] it all of what he's Desiring to magnify
[55:30] and represent his image in that's right
[55:34] oh
[55:35] Hallelujah does that mean tomorrow we
[55:37] said amen today does that mean tomorrow
[55:39] just going to flow no probably there'll
[55:41] be a rocky road because Satan doesn't
[55:43] like it when you start to get the idea
[55:46] of who you really are in Jesus Christ
[55:49] then he was to come in by like a flood
[55:52] but the word is there to counter
[55:54] everything Satan might throw upon us
[55:59] hallelujah so we struggle and it goes
[56:01] sideways and we see this transition
[56:04] then uh and I'm skipping over a lot but
[56:07] you guys know the story we see job
[56:10] moving into a place where he's actually
[56:12] lamenting his life scripture says he
[56:15] cursed the day he was
[56:17] born now I don't believe he was out
[56:19] there with a filthy language of the
[56:22] world got to get the right kind of
[56:24] cursing he was lamented
[56:26] regretting the very day of his birth yes
[56:31] right I wouldn't want anyone that I know
[56:34] to be in that
[56:36] position but God knows what it takes to
[56:39] make us Rapture
[56:44] Ready he's lamenting under this
[56:48] pressure he's starting to struggle with
[56:51] what is
[56:52] happening Lord I
[56:54] know and it's all right if you say Amen
[56:57] to this Lord I know I have been doing
[57:00] everything
[57:02] correctly but I'm still in this
[57:05] trial I'm still in this circumstance
[57:08] yeah why Lord what more could I
[57:14] do well I'm going to give away the
[57:16] punchline because I already have what
[57:19] more you can do is submit to come into a
[57:24] higher uh uh um oh what's the word it
[57:27] just escaped me a higher exposure of who
[57:30] we really are in Jesus Christ yeah see
[57:35] we set our standard as humans some set
[57:38] standards higher than others I I'm sorry
[57:41] sister April you're just a good example
[57:44] sister Alice you're a good example some
[57:46] of us set our standards pretty low and
[57:49] my standard was excape from
[57:53] school some of you break into the school
[57:56] some of us are here to break
[57:58] out so while we have different standards
[58:02] different points of view different
[58:04] outlooks my brother and sister God's got
[58:06] one goal for you and I he doesn't say to
[58:09] those that are wise and prudent they got
[58:11] this section of heaven and to those that
[58:13] are as dumb as a rock they've got this
[58:15] section of Heaven We Are All Sons and
[58:17] Daughters of God made in his spiritual
[58:22] image and he's reflecting that in us and
[58:25] bringing us forward and lifting us up
[58:28] and so in that we see that that uh job
[58:31] is is struggling with this it's Suddenly
[58:34] It's like wow and you know I I think
[58:37] none of us want friends like job's
[58:41] friends but God gives us friends like
[58:44] that and while we might be angry at them
[58:47] at the
[58:48] moment and in fact we'll see in the Book
[58:50] of Job that God wasn't overly happy with
[58:53] how they reacted or come
[58:57] but it was God that sent
[59:00] them I want you to think about this now
[59:04] God doesn't have absolute control right
[59:07] he's not going to treat us like a puppet
[59:10] God gives us opportunity he gives us
[59:13] Choice he gives us a chance and so how
[59:17] God designed all of this and it was God
[59:20] who designed this my brother and sister
[59:22] how God designed this he gave free moral
[59:25] agency to job's friends and he also gave
[59:28] free moral agency to job but he knew in
[59:31] the end when you get to the end of the
[59:33] book he knew what it would be he knew
[59:36] that job's friends would repent when God
[59:39] uh charged them with their their deeds
[59:41] and he knew that job would come to a
[59:44] greater Revelation than ever before in
[59:48] his life God didn't do that for an
[59:51] exercise of frustration to
[59:53] job he was bringing job to the Pinnacle
[59:58] bringing him up into a higher place and
[1:00:01] so we'll look at this struggle and I
[1:00:03] share this today because I want you to
[1:00:05] see that you're lamenting can I be a
[1:00:07] little more blunt you're whining and
[1:00:09] crying God's not judging you by your
[1:00:12] whining and crying he's not saying they
[1:00:14] don't believe me they're just this
[1:00:15] they're this that my brother and sister
[1:00:17] God knows the birthing process to the
[1:00:20] new
[1:00:21] birth and it's a process every mother
[1:00:24] here knows that everyone who understands
[1:00:26] that knows what it is it's a process and
[1:00:29] it takes place and in that my brother
[1:00:32] and sister God says it's no problem I
[1:00:34] will make room I will give Grace and I
[1:00:37] will bring them to the place I want them
[1:00:39] to be amen so it's there we see I'm I'm
[1:00:43] going to just put it in this context in
[1:00:45] the following chapters we see job's
[1:00:48] friends each one of them expressing
[1:00:51] themselves as to why this is happening a
[1:00:54] common theme amongst them you might
[1:00:55] think that three would be enough in the
[1:00:57] mouth of two or three Witnesses right
[1:00:59] but you know they're coming and and uh
[1:01:02] and you know actually a lot of their
[1:01:04] thoughts were spot
[1:01:06] on they actually hid it you go back and
[1:01:09] read it I've been reading I I wanted to
[1:01:11] preach the whole thing and then I
[1:01:12] thought it'll take forever just to go to
[1:01:15] Every chapter every deal every line that
[1:01:17] they spoke to do but you go read it and
[1:01:20] you will see that they spoke spot on
[1:01:24] yeah but job anointed knowing he hadn't
[1:01:29] went and secretly sin doesn't even
[1:01:32] listen to them instead of gleaning those
[1:01:35] things that would have been beneficial
[1:01:37] job defends himself have you ever felt
[1:01:40] that need somebody says something to you
[1:01:42] and all of a sudden you're just like I'm
[1:01:45] defending myself you don't even have to
[1:01:47] ask yourself if you should you just do
[1:01:51] it when maybe we should have stopped and
[1:01:53] listened
[1:01:55] and then just said God bless you brother
[1:01:57] God bless you Sister I'll pray about
[1:02:01] it but no we're humans we feel this need
[1:02:05] to defend our
[1:02:11] decision look at this they start
[1:02:14] expressing
[1:02:16] themselves we'll shorten this to the
[1:02:20] general
[1:02:20] theme is you have a secret
[1:02:24] sin you have done something God didn't
[1:02:27] want you to do or you didn't do
[1:02:28] something God wanted you to do but
[1:02:31] regardless you have displeased god let's
[1:02:34] take this right back to Job
[1:02:36] 1 here's a man who's righteous upright
[1:02:40] es sketh evil yeah so we recognize that
[1:02:45] while their thought is correct it
[1:02:47] doesn't match God's thought yeah they
[1:02:51] thought they understood God but they
[1:02:53] didn't right
[1:03:00] they judged righteousness by their
[1:03:04] definition are we not
[1:03:08] guilty there's times that we judge
[1:03:11] others
[1:03:12] righteousness by our
[1:03:15] thoughts but we think it should be but
[1:03:18] the truth of it is is their thoughts
[1:03:20] were spot on for the circumstance that
[1:03:23] job had come to a place that in instead
[1:03:26] of coming to God and approaching him
[1:03:30] correctly and saying
[1:03:35] Lord where do we find Jesus submission
[1:03:38] what words do we find Jesus submission
[1:03:43] in Lord thy
[1:03:46] will not my will job could have taken
[1:03:50] that position and said you know what
[1:03:51] Lord whatever it is I've done my best
[1:03:54] now we don't want to use this as an
[1:03:55] excuse my brother and sister I've done
[1:03:57] my best so I can't do no more I've done
[1:03:59] my best no but we can take a position
[1:04:02] that's actually so close to that one
[1:04:04] that it would seem like that that
[1:04:05] they're mated together of Lord thy will
[1:04:09] be done I have done all this flesh and
[1:04:11] all this spiritual man is able to do but
[1:04:15] Lord I know there's more I know that
[1:04:17] you're in control and Lord I'm trusting
[1:04:20] you and that was a position job should
[1:04:21] have took he should have never even
[1:04:24] listened and responded Ed to their
[1:04:28] criticisms in fact God rebukes them I'm
[1:04:31] don't remember I I didn't write all
[1:04:33] these down because I just knew it' take
[1:04:34] too long but somewhere around job
[1:04:37] 3839 in there God's rebuking these guys
[1:04:41] for how they treated job and
[1:04:44] yet they're mostly
[1:04:49] right but they missed the mind of
[1:04:54] God don't you love how it's come through
[1:04:57] the
[1:04:58] message I'd rather have the right
[1:05:02] Spirit and the wrong
[1:05:04] Doctrine than to have the right Doctrine
[1:05:07] and the wrong Spirit Well I'm sorry to
[1:05:10] tell you they're both
[1:05:12] wrong take it in context I'm not
[1:05:15] countering anything but you see what
[1:05:17] happens is this bride I'm talking to to
[1:05:19] the bride here this morning is that okay
[1:05:22] okay I'm not countering anything the
[1:05:23] prophet said or anything but my brother
[1:05:26] and sister we're not called to have half
[1:05:28] the equation we have the opening of the
[1:05:31] word Christ is here with us we don't
[1:05:35] have to settle for half of this picture
[1:05:38] God is wanting to expand it that we see
[1:05:41] the bigger picture to see that we were
[1:05:44] called to have the right Doctrine and we
[1:05:47] were called to have the right Spirit not
[1:05:50] just live in portion but we have come to
[1:05:52] live in the fullness of the Gospel of
[1:05:54] Jesus Christ
[1:05:56] right amen that's right but we can use
[1:05:58] that as an excuse I have a better
[1:06:00] attitude than
[1:06:01] you my drine has went off the rails but
[1:06:06] my attitude is way better than yours so
[1:06:10] I'm
[1:06:11] right no sir we're living in a day my
[1:06:14] brother and sister that the opening of
[1:06:16] the word has brought it to you and I to
[1:06:18] stand here today knowing what we believe
[1:06:21] is
[1:06:22] truth not partial Truth full truth truth
[1:06:26] it is truth that we have been given and
[1:06:28] God will come and I trust you if you
[1:06:30] have an experience God bless you Sister
[1:06:33] if you have an experience that God will
[1:06:36] correct us his way and sometimes his way
[1:06:41] is hard trial sometimes his way is
[1:06:44] suffering sometimes his way is is things
[1:06:46] that we don't even understand and we
[1:06:48] don't know why this is taking place but
[1:06:51] what happens is as we come to a place
[1:06:53] we'll trust ourself before we'll trust
[1:06:56] what God's trying to
[1:06:58] do God said just trust me amen just
[1:07:02] trust
[1:07:03] me now as we look
[1:07:07] here job knows he doesn't have any
[1:07:10] secret
[1:07:14] sin I have been in Services sister Jerry
[1:07:17] was there but maybe doesn't even realize
[1:07:18] this took place were men praying for
[1:07:21] people in the altar not pounding
[1:07:24] pounding them on the back but just
[1:07:26] just
[1:07:28] confess
[1:07:31] confess how would you like to be that
[1:07:33] person that's in the Altar and you know
[1:07:35] you've got nothing confessed maybe
[1:07:37] you're there in the altar asking for
[1:07:39] more understanding asking for a deeper
[1:07:41] Revelation asking for a friend whatever
[1:07:44] it might be and they're they're the
[1:07:46] preacher thinking they're in the altar
[1:07:47] it's because they got sin in their
[1:07:50] life and then to have that person later
[1:07:53] come and say brother Paul
[1:07:56] if I have a sin in my life I'm not aware
[1:07:58] of it I I don't
[1:08:02] know how would you
[1:08:05] feel we wouldn't feel very good to be
[1:08:08] somebody questioning our Salvation
[1:08:10] questioning you know what we are doing
[1:08:12] and
[1:08:13] living and yet it's
[1:08:17] Humanity it's Humanity that we feel like
[1:08:19] somebody's in a battle someone's in a
[1:08:21] struggle I want to know my brother and
[1:08:23] sister if you would agree with me this
[1:08:25] morning morning if we had been there
[1:08:26] with job we might well be asking job
[1:08:29] about his secret sin because that's what
[1:08:31] is bothering us that afflicts us that we
[1:08:34] face that we and we face that ourself
[1:08:37] maybe that there's things we're still
[1:08:38] dealing with so we believe everybody
[1:08:41] must be just like
[1:08:44] that but God had a whole different
[1:08:47] purpose had nothing to do with secret
[1:08:49] sin cuz God did not change his mind
[1:08:51] about Job halfway through this story
[1:08:54] amen he said said that he was perfect my
[1:08:57] brother and sister my words there but he
[1:09:00] says that he's perfect and so therefore
[1:09:02] God didn't come along halfway through
[1:09:03] the story and say I didn't realize that
[1:09:05] about job and God's not coming halfway
[1:09:07] through the story saying oh I didn't
[1:09:09] realize that about you he's called you
[1:09:12] worthy he's called you blessed he's
[1:09:15] called you the bride of Christ he's not
[1:09:18] going to get halfway through the story
[1:09:19] and decide that you're a loser my
[1:09:21] brother and sister that you're just
[1:09:23] another rank sinner God is
[1:09:26] faithful and we don't understand
[1:09:35] him job in his mind is you're false I'm
[1:09:38] falsely
[1:09:40] accused but God said I do see something
[1:09:44] in you
[1:09:45] job that I'd like to root
[1:09:50] out you know the problem we have in the
[1:09:53] world
[1:09:54] today people don't want to give God
[1:09:57] Liberty to root it
[1:10:01] out they don't
[1:10:04] want to give God
[1:10:07] freedom to make it
[1:10:12] hurt in
[1:10:15] fact if you go study your history you'll
[1:10:19] find the correlation coming out of pagan
[1:10:23] worship the Cor relation between Santa
[1:10:28] Claus and the Modern Day Jesus
[1:10:33] Christ they've cut him out of the same
[1:10:36] mold you just need to bless me bring me
[1:10:39] good
[1:10:40] gifts and basically leave me
[1:10:44] alone after all Santa only shows up once
[1:10:47] a
[1:10:49] year they want God to show up maybe once
[1:10:52] a year choose between Christmas or e
[1:10:57] Easter you see my brother and sister God
[1:11:00] looked at
[1:11:02] job and he says you know what job I'm
[1:11:06] going to let you go through a painful
[1:11:08] trial time in your life and I'm doing
[1:11:11] this to bring you up
[1:11:14] higher now I want to ask you a question
[1:11:16] today Saints who wants to go up higher
[1:11:20] amen amen every one of us should be
[1:11:22] lifting a hand saying Lord draw me
[1:11:24] higher dve me higher but when you say
[1:11:27] that be prepared that God is going to
[1:11:30] take those little things in your life
[1:11:32] and he's going to root them out amen
[1:11:35] don't you love that when you get a
[1:11:36] sliver a a and uh uh it reminds me
[1:11:41] Family Camp that little girl got that
[1:11:43] sliver and it's a good deal sister April
[1:11:45] did the operation because if Paul had
[1:11:48] the girl wouldn't have been able to walk
[1:11:49] for the next
[1:11:50] week because I believe in getting way
[1:11:53] below where the actual sliver is and
[1:11:55] making it
[1:11:58] bleed and we don't want God to do that
[1:12:02] we want God to wrap it
[1:12:04] up and give it a little kiss it'll be
[1:12:07] better
[1:12:08] now but you see God says that little bit
[1:12:13] I want
[1:12:15] out I'm going to get that
[1:12:23] out just reading a little bit of history
[1:12:25] book that sister Sue had given me as a
[1:12:27] birthday
[1:12:28] gift there was a man that was on a ship
[1:12:32] it's about the convoys in World War II
[1:12:33] going across the ocean to Russia the man
[1:12:36] on his ship froze actually it froze his
[1:12:40] legs
[1:12:41] solid and um you know they cut away a
[1:12:46] lot of the Flesh and said we think we've
[1:12:48] got
[1:12:49] it but they didn't get rid of the Gang
[1:12:53] Green it kept on going it kept right on
[1:12:56] spreading and what they could have done
[1:12:59] right in the first place cost the man
[1:13:01] both of his
[1:13:02] legs because they didn't want to hurt
[1:13:08] him when in
[1:13:10] reality we wouldn't like the results you
[1:13:13] see the choice was cut off his
[1:13:15] foot or cut off most of his
[1:13:18] leg they they just thought it was
[1:13:21] terrible to cut off his foot it's going
[1:13:22] to affect everything but by that
[1:13:26] decision they cursed him pardon me for
[1:13:28] using it that way but they cursed him to
[1:13:30] lose both of his legs much farther up
[1:13:34] you see we don't want the pain so we
[1:13:37] settle for what's the easiest way
[1:13:45] out and the whole time job doesn't even
[1:13:48] understand why this is
[1:13:49] happening it's like Lord I was living
[1:13:51] for you I prayed for my children every
[1:13:55] every single day L they would have done
[1:13:57] something that was not pleasing I want
[1:14:00] to know do we pray for our children like
[1:14:03] that we should be my brother and sister
[1:14:06] but when God takes you through a trial
[1:14:09] sometimes he actually uses the children
[1:14:11] to be part of your trial and you prayed
[1:14:15] that God would deal kindly with your
[1:14:17] children and correct them and do this
[1:14:19] and you say how can this be I prayed
[1:14:21] that God would do this and yet it seems
[1:14:23] like the trial comes down to to my
[1:14:28] children and then we're actually upset
[1:14:30] with
[1:14:31] God that maybe our children are not
[1:14:34] serving God
[1:14:36] today
[1:14:38] maybe it's part of your trial that's
[1:14:40] right to come to Perfection
[1:14:43] amen but we don't think
[1:14:45] so brother brandham says here in the
[1:14:48] message show us the father and it
[1:14:50] suffices
[1:14:52] amen then when his church m members came
[1:14:55] and could not console him accused him uh
[1:14:59] uh to being a secret sinner said he'd
[1:15:01] sinned before God which every man does
[1:15:04] job knew he had not sinned and he knew
[1:15:06] he was all right but when God sent a
[1:15:09] young man down by the name of elu come
[1:15:13] down to meet job look what the prophet
[1:15:16] says it's not another one of his friends
[1:15:20] that's there to criticize but when you
[1:15:23] read what elu wrote or spoke you almost
[1:15:27] think he's in the same boat they are but
[1:15:29] there was a different anointing U didn't
[1:15:32] come as a Critic elu come as one to
[1:15:35] bring
[1:15:36] reconciliation he wanted to bring his
[1:15:39] friends and job back Amen to God
[1:15:45] Amen but when God sent a young man down
[1:15:48] by the name of elue come down to meet
[1:15:50] job perfect type of Christ again he
[1:15:53] didn't accuse job of being a secret
[1:15:55] sinner he tried to tell him of someone
[1:15:58] who would come and stand in the breach
[1:16:00] in the last days and put his hands oh
[1:16:03] Lord and put his hands upon a sinful man
[1:16:07] and upon a holy God and Bridge the
[1:16:10] way oh Hallelujah aren't you glad
[1:16:13] there's one today that has stood in that
[1:16:16] gap for you and I amen who has bridged
[1:16:19] between us as carnal people and almighty
[1:16:22] God all I can say today is thank thank
[1:16:25] you Lord thank you Lord that there's one
[1:16:27] to stand in the gap for you and I but
[1:16:30] yet look at this my brother and sister
[1:16:33] elu spoke very strong words to job and
[1:16:38] it would almost look like you see if we
[1:16:40] just read it it would almost look like
[1:16:42] we needed let me put it this way we
[1:16:44] needed the prophet to show us that this
[1:16:46] was a type of Jesus Christ cuz it just
[1:16:49] looked like another critic in another
[1:16:51] way yeah amen
[1:16:59] U strong
[1:17:04] words Lord help us to deal with strong
[1:17:06] words
[1:17:08] amen you know the scripture shows us as
[1:17:10] the spirit of the age would be a spirit
[1:17:12] of offense that's right and boy are we
[1:17:15] seeing that yes sir yeah we're seeing
[1:17:21] that you know sometime back I was in
[1:17:25] Town shopping which in itself is a
[1:17:28] rarity but I was walking out of a
[1:17:30] business and there was this lady walking
[1:17:32] towards
[1:17:33] me she
[1:17:35] looked
[1:17:38] normal and so as I'm going out I just
[1:17:41] kind of turned around the end of the
[1:17:43] door and stood there holding the door
[1:17:46] and she got about 3 feet from me and
[1:17:49] snarled and said I can hold my own door
[1:17:54] thank you
[1:18:03] please what is it a
[1:18:06] spirit of offense sounds pretty radical
[1:18:10] doesn't
[1:18:11] it can you say strong
[1:18:15] words think about some of the things we
[1:18:17] become offended
[1:18:18] over ex right they were
[1:18:22] nothing they were literally measured as
[1:18:26] nothing but the spirit of offense that's
[1:18:29] on the world wants to be on you on the
[1:18:33] bride of Christ and the Holy Ghost is
[1:18:36] here to guard you and I from that spirit
[1:18:39] of offense because that spirit of
[1:18:42] offense becomes a spirit of bitterness
[1:18:44] and on down the line so you see now that
[1:18:47] it come to the place that we needed
[1:18:49] someone who would stand in the breach in
[1:18:51] this last day and I praise God God is so
[1:18:54] mindful to you and I he actually just
[1:18:57] named this the message amen the breach
[1:19:01] Amen to show you and I what it is to be
[1:19:04] able to live this life knowing with
[1:19:07] confidence this is not permission to sin
[1:19:09] but knowing with confidence there's one
[1:19:11] standing in the Gap one standing in the
[1:19:14] breach for you and I today amen and God
[1:19:17] is here telling you don't take offense
[1:19:19] of that pray for them amen imagine how
[1:19:22] many offenses we would have in the
[1:19:24] church if the first thing we did when
[1:19:26] something slapped Us in the face we
[1:19:28] would just go find a spot and say Lord I
[1:19:31] don't know if they meant that and if
[1:19:32] they did Father help them touch them
[1:19:35] Lord Heal them give them repentance or
[1:19:38] whatever it might be
[1:19:41] reconciliation but you know we usually
[1:19:43] go around the
[1:19:49] corner I never like them
[1:19:51] anyhow well the prophet of God says is
[1:19:54] you can find one
[1:19:56] thing one thing I was just talking to a
[1:19:58] brother overseas just a few days
[1:20:01] ago very difficult situation there the
[1:20:05] brother found himself getting caught up
[1:20:07] in the
[1:20:08] situation and the Lord brought him to a
[1:20:10] quote I'd read it to you except from my
[1:20:12] phones in the office brought him to a
[1:20:15] quote and the prophet says if you find
[1:20:18] there's one thing in your heart against
[1:20:24] that person amen the Holy Spirit cannot
[1:20:28] be there amen
[1:20:31] amen you mind if I sit down and just
[1:20:33] weep for a moment or
[1:20:36] two because we find times in our lives
[1:20:39] yes sir we hold great feelings of
[1:20:47] animosity that's right absolutely right
[1:20:50] then we wonder why our own life is
[1:20:53] sterile from the present pres of the
[1:20:55] holy
[1:20:56] spirit amen and if we're not careful we
[1:20:59] even tried to blame that on that
[1:21:01] individual amen I'm not praying and
[1:21:03] reading my Bible because of
[1:21:05] them wow wow see how we think we
[1:21:10] understand God and we don't that's right
[1:21:13] let me hurry along
[1:21:16] here I'm going to have to hurry along
[1:21:18] really
[1:21:19] fast so look look at this my brother and
[1:21:21] sister that that elu had strong words
[1:21:25] for job and and he speaks them out he
[1:21:28] doesn't come and apologize for what
[1:21:30] God's called him to do no more than our
[1:21:33] Lord Jesus Christ would apologize for
[1:21:35] standing in the gap for you and I he
[1:21:38] knew where he stood and he knew what was
[1:21:40] necessary and he spoke it amen Lord let
[1:21:44] us have friends like that let us be in
[1:21:47] the presence of men like that
[1:21:49] amen so eloh recorded in Job 35: 1 and
[1:21:55] two elu speaks to job and he says
[1:21:58] thinkest Thou this to be right that thou
[1:22:02] said us my righteousness is more than
[1:22:07] God's do you realize what that is let's
[1:22:10] tone that down and make it
[1:22:12] palatable that's a self-righteous
[1:22:15] spirit that our righteousness is greater
[1:22:19] than
[1:22:20] God's in other words instead of finding
[1:22:23] the word and it's showing us how to deal
[1:22:26] with it we just judge it
[1:22:29] ourself Lord help
[1:22:32] us amen we think we understand God but
[1:22:35] we don't also jumping down a little bit
[1:22:38] there in job 35 uh 16 therefore doth job
[1:22:43] now this one to me was just a really a
[1:22:46] Zinger therefore doth job open his mouth
[1:22:48] in vain he multipath words without
[1:22:52] knowledge
[1:22:55] how easy that is to
[1:22:57] do how easy that is to do God help us I
[1:23:00] I'm going to repent right in front of
[1:23:01] you today right here right now Lord
[1:23:04] forgive me Church forgive me how many
[1:23:07] times we by the increase of our words
[1:23:10] think we actually know what we're
[1:23:11] talking
[1:23:13] about what we need is the Holy Spirit to
[1:23:15] come and give us that little bit of a
[1:23:17] nudge but sometimes God's nudge feels
[1:23:20] like a sludgehammer to you and I but God
[1:23:23] is just nudging us in the the right
[1:23:24] direction because he's not going to have
[1:23:27] a bride and you are his bride he's not
[1:23:31] going to have a bride that holds these
[1:23:33] kind of feelings holds these kind of
[1:23:35] spirits lives in this kind of anointing
[1:23:38] God's not going to so you think it's a
[1:23:40] sludgehammer God thinks it's a
[1:23:46] nudge change a song there oh Lord bring
[1:23:50] the sledgehammer just now oh Lord bring
[1:23:54] the sludgehammer just now amen we want
[1:23:58] the Holy Spirit Lord come move by your
[1:24:00] Holy Spirit I didn't want the
[1:24:01] sludgehammer Lord it was just the Holy
[1:24:05] Spirit God just lining us
[1:24:11] up rhetorical question for you is it
[1:24:14] possible to serve god without knowledge
[1:24:16] or
[1:24:22] understanding we would say no but God
[1:24:25] says
[1:24:26] yes at the end of the book you'll find
[1:24:29] where God comes and chastises those
[1:24:31] men tells them they need to take and
[1:24:34] give gifts to job and
[1:24:37] repent because you see they acted
[1:24:40] without knowledge or understanding so
[1:24:44] you being the bride we being the bride
[1:24:46] let me put it that way we being the
[1:24:48] bride my brother and sister God will let
[1:24:50] us do
[1:24:51] things how many times you don't have to
[1:24:54] lift your hands cuz somebody that knows
[1:24:56] might see
[1:24:57] it but how many times we have spoken
[1:25:01] things when we were right but we were
[1:25:05] wrong yeah that's
[1:25:09] right typically you'll see this more
[1:25:12] so with husbands and
[1:25:14] wives or if I can kind of just poke a
[1:25:18] little bit with wives and
[1:25:23] husbands same equation amen why did you
[1:25:27] interpret that
[1:25:30] different you see what happens to us we
[1:25:34] interpret it where it finds favor for us
[1:25:38] right so look at this now that God is
[1:25:40] doing and and so elu coming on the scene
[1:25:45] he he comes and and he starts pointing
[1:25:49] uh uh this whole situation away from uh
[1:25:52] I never pronounce him right so forgive
[1:25:54] me elifas bildad and zofar he he
[1:25:58] starts elu comes and he takes his whole
[1:26:02] conversation and he starts turning this
[1:26:05] away from those three men he turns it
[1:26:07] and he turns it and he turns it a and
[1:26:09] pretty soon you know they're
[1:26:11] uncomfortable because they realize that
[1:26:13] elue is right but they don't like what
[1:26:17] their own attitude produced but elu is
[1:26:22] right because going back to the quote
[1:26:24] it's gone now but that's all right
[1:26:27] elu was coming as
[1:26:30] Christ how are we going to argue with
[1:26:33] Christ the Holy Ghost in you can't argue
[1:26:36] with the word amen because the word in
[1:26:39] you is expressed as the holy spirit amen
[1:26:42] so you can't argue with that that's why
[1:26:44] the prophet of God said that a real
[1:26:47] believer will say Amen to every word of
[1:26:50] God because it's the Holy Spirit moving
[1:26:53] them and the Holy Spirit spirit is the
[1:26:54] word
[1:26:55] represented so you can't say no to it so
[1:26:59] he starts pointing them away from that
[1:27:01] but look what happens if you read this
[1:27:04] when I say open mind I'm not think
[1:27:05] talking about you know mixed up theology
[1:27:07] but just expand it Beyond just reading a
[1:27:09] few boxed in words and then he moves
[1:27:12] Beyond them and he starts to speak to
[1:27:17] job he's the youngest there they're all
[1:27:21] Elder to him and he starts to speak to
[1:27:24] them and he starts to declare you know
[1:27:27] what
[1:27:29] uh you've been looking at this as why
[1:27:33] job why was you praying about show me
[1:27:35] God's house so I can see show me this
[1:27:38] and show me that God show me why oh how
[1:27:41] many times have we done that Lord show
[1:27:42] me why I need to know why I'm going
[1:27:45] through this trial why don't we just
[1:27:46] stop and say Lord I'm a daughter of God
[1:27:49] I'm a Son of God if I'm going through
[1:27:51] this trial it's only because you want me
[1:27:53] to go through this this trial you
[1:27:55] allowed it to happen you pulled the
[1:27:57] Hedge back and let Satan inside the head
[1:28:00] it's not Satan prying his way in like a
[1:28:02] burglar it's God saying I'll use you
[1:28:05] devil I'll use you just fine I'll put a
[1:28:07] in your mouth and I will shot your
[1:28:10] feet and I will use you to fulfill my
[1:28:13] word and to bring my bride into maturity
[1:28:16] and so it's there he starts to speak to
[1:28:18] job why are you saying this why are you
[1:28:21] saying this why are you standing there
[1:28:24] and bemoaning who you are has God not
[1:28:27] been faithful to you has God not blessed
[1:28:29] you through the years and this season of
[1:28:31] a trial is it not still God and our God
[1:28:36] is an awesome God our God is a powerful
[1:28:39] God our God's in control of everything
[1:28:41] what are you doing
[1:28:44] job this word's living again we're
[1:28:48] sitting here as a bride of Christ you
[1:28:50] know job had all those lands all those
[1:28:53] houses all those Ox all of everything
[1:28:57] that he had and you're rich richer than
[1:28:59] job is amen amen come on realize that
[1:29:03] you're richer than job ever was well I
[1:29:07] maybe don't even own a house I maybe
[1:29:09] this I maybe that who cares about those
[1:29:11] things it burns my brother and sister
[1:29:14] but God comes and uses El
[1:29:17] U to start pushing job and job because
[1:29:22] he's the son of God and God never breaks
[1:29:24] the word had to say
[1:29:27] amen that's right he had to acknowledge
[1:29:30] that's right what elu Christ exactly was
[1:29:34] speaking to
[1:29:40] him what does he do starts to turn the
[1:29:44] focus on God and His Majesty that's it
[1:29:48] How Great Is Our God Amen his
[1:29:50] righteousness and turns the focus on his
[1:29:53] authority
[1:29:56] who can argue it's right there I'm
[1:29:59] paraphrasing it right there in job who
[1:30:02] can argue with
[1:30:06] God I'm not qualified I don't know about
[1:30:09] anybody
[1:30:10] else but you see I found there's been
[1:30:13] times but then the Lord gracious many
[1:30:16] years ago here won't go into that whole
[1:30:18] story but I
[1:30:21] realized you can ask God a question
[1:30:26] don't question God that's right that's
[1:30:29] differ it's all about our
[1:30:33] approach and yet we found times in great
[1:30:36] Calamity and trial that we almost want
[1:30:38] to question
[1:30:41] God God says no sometimes you just have
[1:30:44] to trust me that's right I just need you
[1:30:47] to go ahead and just trust me right and
[1:30:51] in trust it's in the Psalms and in
[1:30:55] trust God rewards
[1:30:58] faithfulness my Lord I want my
[1:31:02] reward how I want my reward let me be
[1:31:05] faithful amen see he explains to job
[1:31:11] this understanding that God is so
[1:31:13] Superior to man his thoughts and his
[1:31:16] ways and you know what happens I need to
[1:31:19] hurry here please pray for me our
[1:31:22] reasoning misleads us us when we
[1:31:25] misunderstand God's
[1:31:29] character I can't tell you how many
[1:31:31] people I've dealt
[1:31:34] with that are angry at
[1:31:36] God and they have a
[1:31:40] reason we'll get to this in just a
[1:31:42] moment if I can have just a few more
[1:31:44] minutes of your
[1:31:45] time they Ang they're angry they're
[1:31:49] angry at God he never answered this
[1:31:51] prayer well maybe your prayer was ask
[1:31:53] them
[1:31:54] yes maybe your motive wasn't Pure or
[1:31:58] maybe the results if your prayer had
[1:32:00] been answered would be a
[1:32:04] disaster but we still want what we want
[1:32:08] when we want how we
[1:32:10] want and God says my ways are higher
[1:32:13] than your ways you're my son you're my
[1:32:17] daughter can you just trust me that's it
[1:32:20] that's it you know that's a hard
[1:32:22] statement that's it put the right
[1:32:25] context or the right circumstance and I
[1:32:27] don't know just take one of us to one
[1:32:29] another one here in the assembly and say
[1:32:31] just trust me y you realize the human
[1:32:34] flesh kicks in why does it kick in
[1:32:36] because you've been betrayed that's show
[1:32:39] me where Jesus Christ ever betrayed
[1:32:41] anyone that's it I'm faithful to my word
[1:32:45] amen amen that's right that's our God
[1:32:47] he's faithful to his word it's not about
[1:32:51] Humanity now don't get confused by what
[1:32:54] I'm going to say but it's kind of direct
[1:32:56] God's not faithful to
[1:32:59] you you go what what are you saying
[1:33:02] Paul God is faithful to his word that's
[1:33:05] right our job is to make sure the word
[1:33:09] is in
[1:33:10] us and then I can say God is faithful to
[1:33:15] you but you see the promise of
[1:33:17] redemption my brother and sister has
[1:33:18] been offered to
[1:33:20] humanity but they don't trust God and
[1:33:24] they abuse it when they ask for
[1:33:26] it praise God brother Isaac shares a
[1:33:29] deal that he had seen once years ago a
[1:33:31] church service the preacher I I don't
[1:33:34] know if I have this 100% right but the
[1:33:35] preacher comes down and starts going
[1:33:37] down the aisle of the church pray for
[1:33:40] money money money money we want money
[1:33:42] money money Lord bless us with money
[1:33:44] money money Mone money does God owe you
[1:33:50] money come on let's face
[1:33:54] it'd be a betrayal of those in the Dark
[1:33:57] Ages that hid in the caves starved
[1:34:00] labored that's right we're in
[1:34:03] fear that'd be
[1:34:05] betrayal God has no obligation to make
[1:34:08] your life
[1:34:09] easy then he would have be obligated to
[1:34:12] somehow go back and make their life
[1:34:16] easy you see when we misunderstand the
[1:34:20] character of
[1:34:21] God we come to the wrong
[1:34:24] conclusion I say Lord help me to
[1:34:27] understand help me to understand
[1:34:30] lord it's not what we think Saints but
[1:34:32] it's what God thinks amen amen Romans
[1:34:36] 9:11 and I'm just going to go through
[1:34:37] this you might find out if you wish to
[1:34:40] bother to look you'll find out this is
[1:34:42] one of the great scriptures that's being
[1:34:44] used today to cause people to question
[1:34:47] the goodness of God because now you've
[1:34:50] got whole big Ministries Mega Ministries
[1:34:53] that are saying we have misinterpreted
[1:34:55] there was something wrong with the
[1:34:56] writings or something that surely God
[1:34:59] would not do this that would be
[1:35:03] unkind and in the
[1:35:05] day of my emotional
[1:35:10] well-being imagine you have two
[1:35:14] wishes save your emotions or save your
[1:35:18] soul do you realize the anointing in
[1:35:21] leoda they would ask for their emotion
[1:35:24] to be
[1:35:26] saved and would reject the very word
[1:35:29] that would save their
[1:35:31] soul I stand here today with no desire
[1:35:34] to offend any one of you but if I have
[1:35:37] to choose to make you happy or save your
[1:35:39] soul it is to me not even a question of
[1:35:43] what we go forward that's right amen
[1:35:46] because making you happy and you lose
[1:35:48] your soul you would stand as it was the
[1:35:51] Rich Young Ruler and you would be
[1:35:53] looking across the gulf asking for
[1:35:55] Relief asking for something and your
[1:35:57] emotions at that time would mean
[1:36:00] nothing amen I'm sure you've thought of
[1:36:03] this heard it preach but how much water
[1:36:06] fits on the tip of your
[1:36:08] finger and the Rich Young Ruler asked
[1:36:11] would you send Lazarus to dip his finger
[1:36:14] and come across and give that to me that
[1:36:19] is desperation
[1:36:26] I'd rather you walked into heaven said
[1:36:28] our pastor was mean but I'm
[1:36:33] hereall amen yes sir so do a little
[1:36:36] homework read Romans 9 uh 11 through 23
[1:36:40] I don't want to belabor that here but
[1:36:42] you know it's talking about the Potter
[1:36:45] and the clay and this part I will draw
[1:36:47] out my brother and sister when it comes
[1:36:49] to the time we think as message
[1:36:52] Believers that we can actually tell God
[1:36:54] how he wants how we want him to form
[1:36:58] us that's an arrogant Spirit that's
[1:37:00] exactly right amen starts with an
[1:37:03] intellectual Spirit turns into an
[1:37:05] arrogant Spirit I'm here to tell God
[1:37:07] what I want we spanked our children when
[1:37:11] they behave that way and would we wonder
[1:37:15] today that maybe the Lord would spank
[1:37:18] us
[1:37:22] amen help us
[1:37:24] Lord help us Lord let me move along
[1:37:27] please go read that his homework okay
[1:37:29] amen see job misunderstood his friends
[1:37:32] misunderstood elu was anointed to see
[1:37:36] how they actually missed God's work in
[1:37:40] job imagine El elu had a revelation of
[1:37:44] what God was wanting to accomplish
[1:37:46] before job
[1:37:48] did but you'll also notice that elu
[1:37:51] being faithful to what God called him to
[1:37:53] do did not get more houses more lands
[1:37:55] more cattle he didn't get anything but
[1:37:58] he found God's favor amen what do you
[1:38:00] want houses lands money in the bank or
[1:38:03] God's favor Lord give us your favor give
[1:38:07] us your favor hallelujah amen so as it
[1:38:12] is elu is speaking he he really digs in
[1:38:15] and he's forceful amen and it's there
[1:38:19] he's telling them in the end of all of
[1:38:21] this God is still God
[1:38:24] I don't care about your circumstance job
[1:38:27] all you friends I don't care about what
[1:38:28] you think was the right thing God is God
[1:38:32] and it's time for us to glorify God it's
[1:38:35] time for us to praise God it's time to
[1:38:38] lift our hands and worship God because
[1:38:40] God is in control it is not me it's not
[1:38:44] you it's not you job and your
[1:38:47] self-righteous spirit that spirit that
[1:38:50] was there but you remember you won't
[1:38:52] find in scripture what God took away the
[1:38:54] words he spoke about job no sir but let
[1:38:57] me tell you the
[1:39:00] speck the speck that's right can we
[1:39:03] shrink that even further the speck yeah
[1:39:06] that God will see in
[1:39:08] you he's
[1:39:11] obligated to take it
[1:39:13] out Can someone say Lord amen fulfill
[1:39:16] your
[1:39:17] obligation take that out amen do we
[1:39:22] realize what we're asking for
[1:39:30] for to bring man to see God and His
[1:39:36] Majesty I want to ask you trying to turn
[1:39:39] this back very positive
[1:39:41] here you know sometimes we look at that
[1:39:44] and we want to see something
[1:39:45] Supernatural we want to see something
[1:39:47] that would just somehow stir our
[1:39:50] life how about
[1:39:52] settling for seeing God's hand that's it
[1:39:55] in your life that's
[1:39:57] it that's it to bring us to a place that
[1:40:00] we just realize that he's leading and
[1:40:03] guiding and he's blessing us that's
[1:40:06] right and all we might see figuratively
[1:40:09] if I could say it's God's
[1:40:11] hand I would have went
[1:40:15] here in our trip to Canada we got to
[1:40:19] experience develop a new friendship with
[1:40:21] a family and as they share their
[1:40:24] testimony I'm sitting there thinking the
[1:40:26] whole time at the point we talk to them
[1:40:28] they still have a ton of
[1:40:30] questions I'm sitting there looking at
[1:40:32] this whole thing hearing their testimony
[1:40:35] and it's like that's God's
[1:40:37] hand that's God's hand that's God's hand
[1:40:41] that's God's hands but I'll tell you on
[1:40:43] the natural flesh side of this they're
[1:40:45] crying tears and they're saying we don't
[1:40:48] understand I'm over here saying God's
[1:40:50] hand God's hand he didn't say only
[1:40:54] understand the prophet said only believe
[1:40:56] and by God's grace that family is
[1:40:58] believing and God is shaking their whole
[1:41:01] world and they're still saying we know
[1:41:03] there's a reason this is happening yes
[1:41:05] sir yeah God help us that's right God
[1:41:10] help us I don't need to defend myself oh
[1:41:14] it's my human nature you might come
[1:41:15] along and you see Paul defending himself
[1:41:18] I'm telling you you're looking at flesh
[1:41:20] amen God don't owe that to us amen but
[1:41:22] we're Looking In the Flesh but if we'll
[1:41:25] ever come to the place we don't have to
[1:41:27] fully understand it but we'll stand
[1:41:28] there and say Lord thy will be done Lord
[1:41:31] and when thy will is done I'll still be
[1:41:33] standing here receiving it amen I won't
[1:41:37] run I won't hide I won't deny I will
[1:41:41] receive am
[1:41:44] Hallelujah would you put up that
[1:41:49] quotation I come across this in some of
[1:41:51] my readings recently
[1:41:54] kind of stirred me a little bit it's not
[1:41:55] out of the message just just some stuff
[1:41:58] that I've been
[1:42:00] reading instead of allowing our
[1:42:02] circumstance to come between us and
[1:42:04] God we should keep God between us amen
[1:42:09] and our
[1:42:11] circumstance brutal moment of truth I
[1:42:15] think most of the time we have that
[1:42:19] backwards our circumstances ruling our
[1:42:21] life that's it that's exactly right and
[1:42:24] we give what's left over to God that's
[1:42:26] the truth Lord help me you don't have to
[1:42:29] lift your hand maybe you can just lift
[1:42:30] it in your heart Lord help me I don't I
[1:42:34] don't want my circumstance coming
[1:42:35] between me and you Lord I want to put
[1:42:39] you between me amen and we could
[1:42:43] stereotype this that's probably not the
[1:42:45] right words
[1:42:47] but any
[1:42:48] man that would take his
[1:42:51] wife and tell her to go deep with the
[1:42:55] Intruder it's not much of a
[1:43:01] husband come onen maybe you send her if
[1:43:05] she's meaner than you are tougher than
[1:43:06] you are a better shot than you
[1:43:08] are but you understand what I'm saying
[1:43:11] amen Christ is not going to put you out
[1:43:14] to the front and say you deal with the
[1:43:17] devil you deal with the devil and I'm
[1:43:20] going to sit back and see whether you
[1:43:21] can live through the onslaught I can
[1:43:23] tell you we can't no that's right but
[1:43:25] with Christ between us and the devil we
[1:43:29] will come out of that will you still
[1:43:30] have pressure will you still have strain
[1:43:32] will you have so to speak skinned elbows
[1:43:34] and knees you will but you'll come out
[1:43:36] of that healthy and still serving God
[1:43:40] Amen
[1:43:42] Hallelujah okay just I'm trying to go
[1:43:45] okay let's go to the Rapture amen
[1:43:48] anybody like to just skip I like that I
[1:43:51] I got excited when brother Chris said
[1:43:52] you know I'm packed up and ready to
[1:43:54] go yeah amen packed up ready to go but
[1:43:59] to the church the bride the Rapture is a
[1:44:03] revelation to her that's the truth wait
[1:44:06] you mean it's not a
[1:44:13] physical it's a revelation that's
[1:44:16] it I believe what the prophet said my
[1:44:19] mind could say well there has to be
[1:44:20] something physical about it but what it
[1:44:22] really is is the physical is so
[1:44:25] secondary you see we're sitting here
[1:44:27] right now raptured into Heavenly places
[1:44:31] exactly as Sons and Daughters of
[1:44:33] God we're already going into a body
[1:44:37] change and if you're sitting here and I
[1:44:39] don't say this factiously I don't say
[1:44:40] this in bad humor but if you're sitting
[1:44:42] here today and you're not seeing a body
[1:44:44] change come to me after service and
[1:44:46] let's pray through because this word is
[1:44:50] creating a body change in you and I a
[1:44:53] change of our thinking a change of our
[1:44:54] heart a change of our Consciousness a
[1:44:56] change of our life amen that's it it's
[1:45:01] revealed to her that the Revelation the
[1:45:03] true bride of Christ will be waiting for
[1:45:06] that revelation of the
[1:45:09] Rapture oh I'm waiting to understand the
[1:45:12] seventh seal I'm waiting to understand
[1:45:15] this I'm waiting to understand that I'm
[1:45:17] going to live in the place where the
[1:45:19] revelation of the Rapture comes to me
[1:45:22] amen amen amen I might not be able to
[1:45:24] explain it you guys will be shocked when
[1:45:26] we get to heaven find out that your
[1:45:27] pastor preached a lot of things that he
[1:45:29] didn't even
[1:45:30] know oh yeah but God knew that's
[1:45:34] right and even though you can't see the
[1:45:36] strings I'm just a
[1:45:38] puppet isn't that what you want or do
[1:45:41] you want Paul to preach to
[1:45:43] you we'll settle for God amen
[1:45:47] amen the true bride of Christ will be
[1:45:50] waiting for that revelation of the
[1:45:51] Rapture now it is a Revelation for the
[1:45:54] Revelation is Faith that's exactly
[1:45:59] right I sure enjoyed I did I tried
[1:46:02] calling him couldn't get back but
[1:46:03] brother Wayne just shared this beautiful
[1:46:06] thing with me I I just I was just like
[1:46:09] wow praise God my brother and sister you
[1:46:13] see we got to break all this down to
[1:46:14] Simplicity we don't need to preach it as
[1:46:16] a complex this thing where it's some
[1:46:19] kind of trigonometry and chemistry and
[1:46:21] this that and the other my brother and
[1:46:23] sister let's get down to the fact that
[1:46:25] Revelation is Faith amen oh you can say
[1:46:29] I've got a lot of Revelation but you got
[1:46:31] no faith something missing and you can
[1:46:33] say I've got a lot of this turn it
[1:46:35] around and something's missing that's it
[1:46:38] amen Revelation is Faith you cannot have
[1:46:41] a revelation without it being Faith look
[1:46:44] at the date this was
[1:46:45] preached God did not leave a bunch of
[1:46:48] time for the prophet to come and correct
[1:46:51] this
[1:46:53] this is pure gold amen yes amen faith of
[1:46:58] Revelations cuz something that's
[1:47:00] revealed to you that's
[1:47:04] right come on don't don't don't even try
[1:47:06] to rely on a husband or a wife children
[1:47:09] don't try to rely on your parents get
[1:47:12] serious get into desperation and say
[1:47:14] Lord if you are real Lord please you got
[1:47:17] to show yourself to me I need
[1:47:20] Revelation because somebody can tell
[1:47:23] what you ought to do but when you know
[1:47:24] what you ought to do you will do what
[1:47:27] you know you ought to
[1:47:31] do H something revealed to you faith is
[1:47:34] a revelation faith is something that has
[1:47:36] been revealed to you like it was to
[1:47:37] Abraham that could call anything
[1:47:40] contrary to what had been revealed to
[1:47:43] him not revealed to somebody else to him
[1:47:45] that's
[1:47:46] it
[1:47:48] right as though it wasn't so
[1:47:55] now this is just for example please
[1:47:57] don't take
[1:47:59] these I could stand here this morning
[1:48:02] and I declare you guys aren't worthy for
[1:48:04] a Rapture you're not worthy to call
[1:48:06] yourself the bride of Christ you're not
[1:48:09] worthy and there would unfortunately be
[1:48:11] some influence by that but if you would
[1:48:15] take the revelation God has given you
[1:48:17] turn that right back to the word and
[1:48:19] You' say no you're wrong brother Paul
[1:48:23] I'm worthy because he's worthy that's
[1:48:29] right I've got the Holy Ghost because he
[1:48:33] made a promise personal not a church
[1:48:36] promise not an age promise although that
[1:48:38] applies also but he made a promise I'll
[1:48:40] be with
[1:48:41] you walk around my wife there just
[1:48:45] imagine I went over there and sit down
[1:48:46] right beside her I'm with
[1:48:50] her how far away is Christ from us this
[1:48:52] this
[1:48:57] morning in us that's right don't let
[1:49:00] anyone any Spirit any
[1:49:05] circumstance keep you from
[1:49:07] recognizing that's it Christ in you is
[1:49:09] the hope of glory
[1:49:13] hallelujah
[1:49:16] amen jump down here now Faith that's
[1:49:20] what faith is is the revelation of God
[1:49:23] and the church is built upon a
[1:49:24] revelation the whole entire body sister
[1:49:28] Ruth if you would
[1:49:29] come
[1:49:35] amen let's just stand let's go let's
[1:49:38] sing the song
[1:49:40] 953
[1:49:42] Hallelujah is it good to be a Christian

[1:52:04] amen you know I just think about this
[1:52:08] 969 please
[1:52:09] [Music]
[1:52:12] brother we say here this morning and I
[1:52:14] trust something's been said that would
[1:52:16] bless you amen and we look at this
[1:52:19] and one of the greatest tricks is sat is
[1:52:22] using right
[1:52:24] [Music]
[1:52:25] now as the unbeliever is coming to the
[1:52:28] believer and say explain this to
[1:52:31] me how do you explain the
[1:52:36] unexplainable impossible amen God said
[1:52:40] what I'd like you to do now we could sit
[1:52:43] here pardon me for putting it this way
[1:52:44] but we could sit here and say only
[1:52:47] believe but God would actually like you
[1:52:50] to come to this place right here that
[1:52:52] you would look at this and say that's
[1:52:56] who I am that's right do you know now
[1:53:00] let me explain why I put it that way
[1:53:03] look at all the gender identity and all
[1:53:05] the other uh misidentifications there
[1:53:08] are you see what Satan's doing he's not
[1:53:11] trying to turn us from boys to girls
[1:53:14] girls to
[1:53:15] boys he's trying to turn us from
[1:53:19] Believers to unbelievers
[1:53:22] and you realize that's actually the same
[1:53:26] Spirit yes it
[1:53:28] is because we don't believe what God
[1:53:32] said that's it we are that's
[1:53:35] right can we just maybe close our eyes
[1:53:38] lift our hands and say thank you Lord
[1:53:40] for the understanding of who I am
[1:53:43] today that I could see even if there's
[1:53:46] been things and struggles and trials and
[1:53:48] struggles in my
[1:53:50] life Lord I believe what you said I am
[1:53:54] I'm not looking to be changed to another
[1:53:58] image but I'm standing here before you
[1:54:00] today Lord saying I
[1:54:03] believe I Trust You Lord you opened
[1:54:07] yourself your word to me I've caught a
[1:54:10] revelation of it and that Revelation is
