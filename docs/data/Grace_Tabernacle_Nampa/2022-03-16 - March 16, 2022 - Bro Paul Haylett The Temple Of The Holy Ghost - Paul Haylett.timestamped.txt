[23:36] prayer but
[23:38] i just was driving around the fred meyer
[23:40] parking lot waiting for my wife and
[23:43] there's this young man there with his
[23:45] car pumping his tire and
[23:47] felt the lord leading me to give him a
[23:49] little gift and
[23:51] that's not just my that's just me so i
[23:53] circled and i lost my opportunity
[23:55] and i felt bad then the opportunity came
[23:57] up again i said no it's just me
[23:59] i lost that opportunity and then i felt
[24:01] bad
[24:02] and then it happened again i had another
[24:04] opportunity so i was like okay whatever

[28:08] [Laughter]
[28:10] anyways um
[28:12] i was listening to
[28:14] the flashing red light of his coming
[28:16] today i had a chance just to work by
[28:17] myself so i just put my earbuds in and
[28:19] brother branham sings that song the day
[28:21] of redemption is near i was like you
[28:23] know we haven't sung that in a while
[28:25] so let's sing that
[28:26] that's number 503.
[28:28] [Music]
[28:32] nations are breaking and israel's
[28:37] awakening
[28:38] the signs that the prophet
[28:42] foretold the gentiles days numbered with
[28:47] horrors in cumber
[28:50] eternity
[28:51] soon will unfold
[28:55] a day of redemption
[28:58] is near
[29:01] men's hearts are failing for fear
[29:06] be filled with the spirit your land's
[29:10] trimmed
[29:15] your redemption is here
[29:19] the fig tree is growing
[29:23] jerusalem's restoring her national
[29:27] lifelong dethrone
[29:30] today she is calling her ladder reigns
[29:35] falling return o disperse to
[29:41] a day of redemption is near
[29:47] man's hearts are failing for fear
[29:52] he filled with the spirit your lap's
[29:56] trimmed and clear
[29:59] the cup your redemption is near
[30:05] heaven's powers are shaking and many are
[30:09] mistaking god's meaning to be of the sky
[30:16] god's church is the power that's shaking
[30:20] this hour the day of redemption
[30:24] is not
[30:27] a day of redemption is near
[30:32] men's hearts are failing for fear
[30:37] be filled with the spirit your land's
[30:41] dreamed and clear
[30:44] the cop your redemption is here
[30:50] false prophets are like god's truth
[30:54] they're denying that jesus the christ is
[30:58] our god
[31:01] through this
[31:02] generation spurns god's revelation
[31:06] we'll walk where the apostles have drawn
[31:12] a day of redemption is near
[31:17] men's hearts are failing for fear
[31:23] be filled with the spirit your land
[31:26] trimmed and cleared
[31:30] look up your redemption is
[31:35] [Music]
[31:54] your redemption
[31:56] [Music]
[31:58] is we say amen to that
[32:02] amen we see every sign that the
[32:04] scripture said would be in our day we're
[32:06] seeing them coming forth we're seeing
[32:09] the evidence of it and yet
[32:12] you take as it were i'm just going to
[32:14] call it a collective thought that the
[32:16] prophet spoke you don't find one sign
[32:20] and then just take that sign and say
[32:22] this is the only thing because you see
[32:24] through the ages there's been signs that
[32:27] the saints of old looked at and thought
[32:29] okay the day must be now because of this
[32:31] sign here but it is the collective
[32:34] revelation of the word in this hour so
[32:37] we're not looking at it and
[32:39] you know some
[32:41] things that i interact with you know
[32:44] just lit up this is it
[32:46] russia
[32:47] going for the gold they're i mean the
[32:50] oil going for the and and yet my brother
[32:52] and sister
[32:54] we
[32:56] just see it as a sign
[32:59] the sign that really matters to you and
[33:01] i
[33:02] is god present
[33:04] right here
[33:06] in our lives that's the sign that
[33:08] matters not what someone's doing here or
[33:12] what someone's doing there
[33:14] because for all we know tomorrow
[33:16] russia may turn around and go home
[33:19] and then we've got all wound up
[33:22] i remember a brother one time talking
[33:24] about 1977.
[33:26] brother one time talking about how they
[33:28] got so caught up in that that all
[33:30] reasoning left them
[33:33] and when it didn't come to pass there
[33:35] were so many in their circle that were
[33:38] were shook so hard
[33:40] they walked away
[33:42] you see
[33:43] we look to the word
[33:44] let god bring the signs to the world
[33:48] and we'll look at the signs of the word
[33:50] coming to pass in our lives amen
[33:53] i want to speak to you this evening
[33:55] amen
[33:57] um
[33:59] uh on we are witnesses again and um i
[34:02] really appreciated that brother chris
[34:04] uh we are witnesses
[34:07] you see it it's not our job
[34:10] to figure out how
[34:12] what we are led to do is going to come
[34:14] about that's right it's not our job to
[34:17] try to to
[34:19] till the soil plant the seed water the
[34:21] seed and hope it comes to harvest our
[34:23] job at the moment as brother chris said
[34:25] and i appreciate the candid approach of
[34:28] of admitting i i didn't follow that and
[34:30] then i get another opportunity and i
[34:32] didn't follow that but god wanted me to
[34:34] speak to this man enough i get another
[34:36] opportunity
[34:37] and i i just find that beautiful because
[34:40] we are witnesses
[34:42] amen i want to speak to you tonight on
[34:44] the temple of the holy ghost thank you
[34:46] brother jay once again
[34:49] this closing song well several of them
[34:52] uh just stirred my heart tonight as our
[34:54] thoughts of studying uh to this and you
[34:58] know this little something i hope you
[34:59] don't mind would it be okay to be
[35:01] excited tonight
[35:03] can we can we have some prior approval
[35:05] so that we don't have to go through the
[35:07] application process
[35:09] during the service
[35:11] because i actually got excited about
[35:13] this very simple thought amen
[35:17] just very very simple thought nothing
[35:18] deep tonight saints but yet i i do
[35:21] believe there's an element of it that is
[35:23] deep
[35:24] let's uh turn to
[35:26] our bibles as we stand first corinthians
[35:29] 6 chapter verses 14 through 20. brother
[35:33] vasily sister tomah good to see you amen
[35:36] i thought maybe you might be somewhere
[35:38] between hither and yawn but you're here
[35:40] tonight and we're happy for that amen uh
[35:43] definitely remember brother sergey he's
[35:46] he's wanting to be back here for this
[35:48] this uh weekend
[35:50] and uh expressed to me
[35:52] that um well i won't share the
[35:54] conversation some might not understand
[35:56] our conversation but he expressed me
[35:59] very strongly his heart's desire to be
[36:02] here for this weekend
[36:04] so
[36:04] let's turn first corinthians 6 14
[36:08] and god hath both raised up the lord and
[36:11] will also raise up us
[36:14] by his own power
[36:16] isn't that exciting
[36:18] i i find that you see by scripture here
[36:21] as paul is speaking to the corinthians
[36:23] he's basically saying if i could put it
[36:26] this way the very same thing that god
[36:30] did
[36:30] to jesus christ
[36:33] he's going to do
[36:34] to you
[36:36] wow i'm telling you i get excited at
[36:39] that thought right amen i don't have to
[36:42] take a lesser promise or a lesser
[36:45] portion as it were now i am not jesus
[36:48] christ but
[36:49] i am
[36:53] now many people will be like oh that's
[36:55] just uh yeah that you're too far out
[36:57] you're too far out but i'm sorry my
[36:59] brother and sister he was the firstborn
[37:01] of many brethren
[37:03] and i am of those brothers
[37:08] yes hallelujah
[37:10] know ye not that your bodies are members
[37:13] of christ
[37:14] shall i then take the members of christ
[37:16] and make them the members of a harlot
[37:20] god forbid what
[37:23] know ye not that he which is joined to
[37:26] an harlot is one body
[37:28] for two saith he shall be one flesh
[37:32] but he that is joined unto the lord is
[37:34] one spirit
[37:37] now in case i just get excited and go
[37:40] over that my brother and sister here is
[37:42] the perfect example of those dwelling in
[37:45] the flesh the carnal approach to the
[37:48] gospel of jesus christ and those coming
[37:51] in the spirit anointed of the holy ghost
[37:55] and it's right here in the word i
[37:56] wouldn't even say it's really hid but
[37:58] yet it kind of is hid
[38:01] because people don't realize they're
[38:03] looking into the carnal realm and saying
[38:05] of course now if one joins himself to a
[38:07] harlot a woman of the streets that this
[38:10] is bad but remember we're
[38:13] dealing in a spiritual warfare not of
[38:16] flesh and blood
[38:23] but of principalities and powers
[38:25] of darkness
[38:27] and if i could interject or attach to
[38:29] the end of that particular scripture the
[38:32] powers of darkness and the powers of
[38:35] light
[38:37] remember for everything that's being
[38:39] done under the uh auspicer umbrella of
[38:41] the powers of darkness there is even
[38:44] more and greater being done under the
[38:46] power of light
[38:48] hallelujah
[38:50] now if satan knew he could overcome us
[38:52] he would be rampaging like you have
[38:54] never seen
[38:55] but he comes to a believer he comes to
[38:57] the word and he's got to find a way to
[38:59] get around it he's got to burrow under
[39:01] it or you know try to do something
[39:06] two saith he shall be one flesh but he
[39:09] that is joined unto the lord is one
[39:11] spirit
[39:12] flee fornication every sin that a man
[39:14] doeth is without his body but he that
[39:17] committeth fornication sinneth against
[39:19] his own body very strong words
[39:21] what
[39:22] know ye not that your body is a temple
[39:25] of the holy ghost which is in you
[39:29] my this this temple
[39:31] my brother and sister is not one made of
[39:34] hands that we could drive down park in
[39:36] the parking lot and walk in this is a
[39:38] temple of the holy ghost which is in you
[39:42] amen now i don't know where this spirit
[39:44] is around the message where people are
[39:46] confused about whether it's god or what
[39:49] it is that's in us or who's leading us
[39:52] or who's guiding us but there's
[39:53] definitely a spirit moving through the
[39:55] land that is trying to break down the
[39:58] fundamental foundation of the godhead
[40:01] because if it comes if it comes
[40:04] to an impersonal position
[40:07] then you will worship him personally
[40:10] but when it comes to a real living
[40:14] example as it were you know god is in
[40:17] you you know the life of christ himself
[40:21] is dwelling in you then it becomes very
[40:24] personal
[40:28] hallelujah
[40:32] which he have of god and ye are not your
[40:34] own
[40:35] well this is this gets a really tough
[40:37] row here right now
[40:40] for year bought with a price therefore
[40:42] glorify god in your body and in your
[40:44] spirit which are gods
[40:47] heavenly father we ask for your guidance
[40:49] tonight lord may your leadership be upon
[40:51] us we only speak your word according to
[40:54] your word we ask that in the name of
[40:56] jesus christ amen
[40:58] you may be seated
[41:00] now as we would look back through this i
[41:02] i hope tonight that i just can keep this
[41:04] in a in a short and orderly fashion when
[41:08] i preached it to myself today i was able
[41:10] to preach it in less than an hour so
[41:12] we'll see how this goes amen but you see
[41:15] my brother and sister as we look going
[41:17] right back to verse 14 i've already said
[41:19] this but to go into my thought god hath
[41:22] both raised up the lord and will also
[41:24] raise up us by his own power see so
[41:27] there's no other influence there was not
[41:30] going to be a man interjected into this
[41:34] to to be raising the people up now the
[41:37] prophet of god many times my brother and
[41:39] sister
[41:40] the critics say well why was he standing
[41:43] there he's waiting for an angel and this
[41:45] is this is uh something they would
[41:47] criticize as though there's some other
[41:50] strange force there but my brother and
[41:52] sister you've felt it before right in
[41:54] this service that when the holy spirit
[41:56] comes down and starts to move amongst
[41:59] the people move on your heart how there
[42:01] is a difference in the atmosphere around
[42:04] you now imagine each and every one of us
[42:07] coming in under that anointing and and i
[42:10] cut off several quotes and things that
[42:12] deal with that atmosphere but my brother
[42:14] and sister you come and no atmosphere or
[42:17] the wrong atmosphere we go home feeling
[42:19] very dry
[42:21] but when that atmosphere comes around us
[42:23] we tend to just mold or just mellow
[42:26] right into that atmosphere and it's in
[42:28] that atmosphere that the holy spirit
[42:30] truly moves upon us and changes our our
[42:34] condition or our circumstance or opens
[42:36] the word in revelation to us and so it's
[42:39] there that we truly want to know this
[42:41] atmosphere but you know it just makes my
[42:44] heart so happy to to see how paul brings
[42:48] us to the corinthians and and he gives
[42:50] them the hope that as we have seen
[42:52] christ raised from the dead amen we
[42:55] shall also in like manner be raised from
[42:58] the dead and those that are sitting here
[43:00] tonight free from the burden of sin free
[43:03] from the spirit of laodicea the chains
[43:05] have been broken and we are now raised
[43:09] up from that position of bondage into a
[43:12] position of liberty and i say thank you
[43:16] lord that we can find liberty in an age
[43:19] as the prophet of god said would become
[43:21] an age of neurotics and that came to
[43:24] pass but we have been by god's grace
[43:27] able to step beyond that because we've
[43:29] been raised up by the power of god
[43:32] amen and so i want to focus on verse 15
[43:35] for just a moment know ye not that your
[43:38] bodies are the members of christ and we
[43:41] look at this and realize now the word
[43:43] members can deal in the flesh that we
[43:46] could be members of grace tabernacle as
[43:48] it were or our arm would be a member of
[43:52] our body an extension of our body so it
[43:54] would be also by definition a member but
[43:58] we'll look at this my brother and sister
[43:59] and this is really truly what got me
[44:01] excited i tried to to figure out how to
[44:04] put this at the end of the sermon so
[44:06] that i could keep you all in
[44:08] anticipation to that point but i just
[44:10] thought you know i can't amen we're
[44:12] going to start this off with some
[44:14] fireworks and by god's grace we'll still
[44:16] remember the fireworks by the time we
[44:18] get home amen but you look at this he
[44:21] said no ye not that your bodies okay so
[44:24] this body my brother and sister we've
[44:26] already delineated the fact that god is
[44:29] speaking through paul in a spiritual
[44:32] context and a carnal context and so as
[44:35] we'll look at this we can look at this
[44:37] flesh and say well my hand is a member
[44:39] of my body my foot etc but let's look in
[44:42] this spiritual aspect let's look at this
[44:45] tonight as as the bride of jesus christ
[44:48] says that our bodies are members of
[44:50] christ
[44:52] amen
[44:54] look at this
[44:55] it's kind of a difficult definition in a
[44:58] sense
[45:01] a constituent
[45:02] peace of a complex structure
[45:07] especially a load-bearing component
[45:12] now if you're a carpenter by trade you
[45:14] would say yep i know exactly what
[45:16] they're talking about
[45:18] you look at this you see my brother and
[45:20] sister this is not a member
[45:23] by signing our names it's not a member
[45:26] by just coming because we don't have a
[45:28] membership role
[45:30] it's not remember by just claiming i i'm
[45:33] part of i believe the message
[45:40] but we're a component
[45:44] in other words god didn't come along and
[45:46] say well we're missing this piece i
[45:48] guess we'll just move on without it
[45:52] god says no you are a component of me
[45:57] you are a structural integral part of me
[46:03] and i am not going to build a house that
[46:06] is lacking
[46:07] there is no such thing as a shortage in
[46:10] the house of god
[46:12] if we saints have a shortage in our life
[46:15] you can no doubt look back now i'm not
[46:17] saying that it's always yourself but we
[46:19] can look back and oftentimes people say
[46:22] well well my minister
[46:24] my minister the pastor of the church
[46:26] doesn't feed me but i want to know how
[46:29] hungry were you when you came
[46:31] because the prophet of god said if
[46:33] there's no church for you you go to a
[46:35] church that preaches that jesus christ
[46:37] is divine
[46:40] what
[46:41] you mean he sent the early believers of
[46:44] the message back to their home church or
[46:46] back to the church down the street or
[46:49] back to his church in another city how
[46:51] could he do that when he says that there
[46:54] are called out people and he sends them
[46:56] back why could he do that because he
[46:58] knew as an integral component of the
[47:01] gospel of jesus christ they could not
[47:04] stay somewhere they didn't fit
[47:08] we can take this over into the chief
[47:10] cornerstone and all that goes without of
[47:12] the foundation in the house and the
[47:14] walls and the corners of the kingdom my
[47:16] brother and sister but you have to
[47:18] realize god reveals to the bride of
[47:20] christ who she is in the body of christ
[47:23] that she can come and fit into her place
[47:26] i'm sorry my brother and sister i'm
[47:28] simply could not be fed in a church
[47:31] that didn't have godhead correctly
[47:34] they did not have revelation of the word
[47:36] that was still feeding an old dead
[47:39] letter
[47:41] the gospel
[47:42] of luther
[47:44] was a powerful gospel in its day
[47:49] the power of the gospel of wesley was a
[47:52] powerful gospel and go down through all
[47:55] the ministries of that time powerful
[47:58] ministries my brother and sister but
[48:00] they without us
[48:03] oh come on they without us there's a
[48:06] component in the hour that we are living
[48:09] in that has to come to fruition has to
[48:12] be put in its proper place and must be
[48:14] manifest and recognized
[48:17] oh you know we struggle sometimes well i
[48:20] i i don't mean i'm not talking about
[48:22] myself i don't want to look like this
[48:24] mom my brother sister come to the hour
[48:26] that we recognize speak it i am a
[48:29] component of the word in this hour there
[48:32] won't be a rapture until the full
[48:35] revelation of jesus christ has come down
[48:38] in each component
[48:42] hallelujah
[48:44] i've been told you're kind of arrogant
[48:46] or proud about not being deceived but my
[48:48] brother and sister when you read that
[48:50] word you recognize it told you not me
[48:54] not someone else
[48:56] jesus christ the word told you you won't
[49:00] be deceived why because every component
[49:04] that makes up who you are is christ
[49:07] himself
[49:09] amen look at what the word said if i
[49:11] take you and i couple or bring you
[49:14] together with a harlot
[49:21] can't produce it
[49:23] come on saints can produce it
[49:26] you can take a harlot message
[49:30] mix it with a pure word
[49:33] and come up with the word seed of jesus
[49:36] christ
[49:37] you can't do it it has to be a pure seed
[49:40] amen and it got to come down into a pure
[49:43] heart and the two of those then will
[49:45] bring forth the word in its purity
[49:48] but there's constituent peace of a
[49:50] complex structure
[49:52] amen we look at this now how can this be
[49:55] where would god actually speak in these
[49:57] terms
[50:00] i mean would god be thinking about a
[50:02] glue lamb
[50:04] or a tji
[50:07] or something of that nature
[50:13] yeah he would
[50:16] yes he would
[50:18] you see god said that this house would
[50:20] be
[50:23] give me a pass on kind of blending the
[50:25] scripture here
[50:26] he said this house
[50:28] would be fitly joined together
[50:31] this house is not a collection of
[50:34] leftover pieces
[50:37] you imagine spending five six seven
[50:39] eight hundred thousand dollars find out
[50:42] your house was built of the rubbish left
[50:44] over of all the rest of houses on the
[50:46] street
[50:47] you wouldn't do it
[50:50] god's not building this house in this
[50:51] hour right now out of some leftover
[50:54] components people say well william
[50:56] branham he plagiarized these guys i'm
[50:58] sorry he took an original piece from
[51:01] almighty god and said it belongs in this
[51:04] age also and it belongs right here
[51:08] and they say it's plagiarism
[51:11] well i'm sorry but when god is speaking
[51:14] he give us permission
[51:17] to say what he said
[51:18] in fact he said i'll probably put a
[51:21] curse on you if you try to blend someone
[51:24] else's sayings with my saying
[51:26] so we got to go back and get that
[51:28] original piece because god isn't going
[51:30] to have you you know when we remodeled
[51:32] one of the houses we lived in amen we we
[51:35] started just like any remodel you start
[51:37] you tear off i need to just change this
[51:40] or do this and brother jay knows what
[51:41] i'm talking about for sure because he's
[51:43] helped us through these amen so you tear
[51:45] this off and you go oh my goodness look
[51:47] at the wiring here we got to go ahead
[51:49] and go through this wall into the next
[51:51] room and we're tearing everything off of
[51:53] it until we come into a room in the
[51:54] house i live in right now was in the
[51:56] bathroom of the house we live in right
[51:58] now and they took a two before this tall
[52:01] and nailed one on the side and it went
[52:03] here and then they nailed another one on
[52:04] the side of this and then had a little
[52:06] short piece to get it to the ceiling
[52:09] ah i tell you what that gives you
[52:11] confidence doesn't it
[52:13] it gives you confidence that what you're
[52:15] what you're living in will it hold the
[52:17] ceiling up but my brother and sister god
[52:19] didn't come and piece this word together
[52:22] god come and gave you the original word
[52:25] the original component the original
[52:27] spirit and he said don't take it back
[52:30] into some filthy a carnal thing over
[52:33] here don't blend that my brother and
[52:35] sister and look what it is i want i hope
[52:38] you get excited about this my brother
[52:40] and sister i got excited when the lord
[52:42] laid it on my heart it wasn't like i was
[52:43] flipping through the bible and just
[52:45] found this and come across it the lord
[52:47] laid it on my heart and i said is that
[52:49] right and i went and i looked it up and
[52:51] i'm telling you my brother and sister
[52:53] it's a component of our age because if
[52:55] you're not an overcomer you're not
[52:57] anything
[53:01] you can be an overcomer
[53:03] and not overcome everything
[53:05] and just have a religious spirit but
[53:07] when you are a true holy ghost filled
[53:11] overcomer you say well i'm waiting for
[53:13] the hour i shouldn't have put that quote
[53:15] up there you guys are reading that thing
[53:17] amen but if you're looking oh when i am
[53:20] ready when i reach this pinnacle god can
[53:23] use me you know what god does he starts
[53:26] right there at the simplest
[53:29] little thing
[53:31] and you overcome that
[53:33] and he drops an element i'm going to
[53:35] call it a seed of faith
[53:38] and we go wow i didn't used to overcome
[53:40] that
[53:41] i just overcame that thank you lord
[53:43] now you get proud and boastful you'll go
[53:45] right back and take that lesson again
[53:47] but then you keep moving and something
[53:49] else comes from the side over here and
[53:51] by god's grace there's enough faith in
[53:53] you you say you know what i believe i
[53:56] believe that word is for me and you
[53:58] claim that and another seed of faith
[54:00] comes down in there and then you have a
[54:02] challenge the devil tries to stumble you
[54:04] and you're able to overcome that and
[54:06] suddenly you find now my brother and
[54:08] sister we sometimes put all this saying
[54:10] oh they're really they're really they're
[54:12] really spiritual they've been a
[54:13] christian for 50 years don't mean a
[54:15] single thing
[54:18] i'll tell you what makes that christian
[54:20] that you can so to speak boast about is
[54:22] that one that has overcoming power
[54:25] whether they're 14 years old or they're
[54:28] 90 years old the one that's got the holy
[54:31] ghost and overcoming power in them is
[54:33] the one that we can look at and say lord
[54:35] i want to be like them lord if i was to
[54:38] to frame my life after a natural brother
[54:41] or sister i wanted to be like those
[54:44] there that are overcomers but look what
[54:46] the word said him that overcometh
[54:51] will i make a scab together
[54:54] two before
[54:56] in my house
[54:58] no sir
[55:00] he didn't even think a good two before
[55:01] it'd be enough he said i'm going to make
[55:03] you into a pillar
[55:05] i'm telling you my brother and sister a
[55:06] pillar designed to hold something up to
[55:09] contain support become integral of the
[55:12] complete structure must have a good
[55:15] foundation and when it's got a good
[55:17] foundation and god keeps building upon
[55:19] that pillar he comes along and he makes
[55:22] him a pillar in the temple of my god now
[55:25] people there will look and say yeah when
[55:27] we get to heaven we're going to be a
[55:28] pillar in that temple i'm telling you
[55:30] god's building temples right now and
[55:33] he's putting pillars in them temples
[55:36] that will hold up to every weight and
[55:38] pressure and storm of life and these
[55:41] pillars my brother and sister they
[55:43] didn't happen overnight they happened
[55:45] through many many fiery trials but they
[55:48] happen to the saint the believer that
[55:51] just keeps pressing on and saying god's
[55:53] word is true god is faithful it looks
[55:56] like all is wrong right now but my god
[55:59] is faithful and i'm going to stand and
[56:02] as you stand
[56:03] god starts to build you
[56:06] into an unmovable
[56:08] pillar
[56:11] and satan batters with storms of life
[56:14] and people mock
[56:17] and the mocking may be within your own
[56:19] family
[56:22] and people say
[56:25] the message people
[56:28] are stubborn
[56:31] they won't receive
[56:33] our correction
[56:36] and there's people within the message
[56:39] that would say
[56:41] of the revelation god has given
[56:44] stubborn spirit i tried
[56:46] to correct you
[56:48] but you see i if i remember right as a
[56:51] personal pronoun
[56:53] did i get that right
[56:55] there's the problem
[56:57] it was them personal
[57:00] going to correct you
[57:03] they wanted to be the one
[57:05] that could say he was wrong in his
[57:07] doctrine and i straightened him out
[57:10] well i happen to have one who raised me
[57:12] up the same way he raised up my lord
[57:15] jesus and if he wants to correct me he
[57:18] will correct me i don't need a personal
[57:21] pronoun to come along and tell you're
[57:24] not understanding the word you need to
[57:26] look at it like this you need to look at
[57:28] it like this you need to sit here you
[57:30] need to go there god's the one that put
[57:32] the foundation under that pillar and god
[57:35] said i'll lead this pillar pardon me
[57:37] from putting the word this way i'll lead
[57:39] this pillar to its proper position i'll
[57:42] lead you and guide you into all truth
[57:49] and the pillar can't say i want to be
[57:50] the basketball pole
[57:54] the pillar can't say i want to support
[57:55] this soccer net
[57:58] i want to be a goal post
[58:02] the pillar is built
[58:04] where god wants the pillar to stand
[58:07] you know otherwise saints i hope you
[58:08] catch this thought
[58:10] otherwise we would have a mecca
[58:12] in the message
[58:15] because we'd all want to go and be part
[58:17] of that one place that one spot that one
[58:20] event that's taking place but god said
[58:23] i'm going to position you all over the
[58:25] world
[58:26] everywhere from the most desolate places
[58:29] to the most populated places i'm glad
[58:32] god chose to put us somewhere in the
[58:34] middle
[58:36] but he says this where i want the pillar
[58:38] to be
[58:39] and so you see he said him that
[58:41] overcometh will i make a pillar in the
[58:42] temple of my god and he shall go out no
[58:44] more you know what this is saying you
[58:46] won't backslide
[58:48] you won't fall away you won't be lost
[58:50] you won't go away you go out no more
[58:53] you'll go not go out of my presence
[58:55] you'll not go out of my tabernacle no
[58:58] more
[58:59] i've sealed you for time and eternity
[59:01] and anchored you in the word for this
[59:04] hour and you're not going to go away
[59:10] now i don't mean to be real direct but
[59:11] i'm telling you my brother and sister
[59:13] you see so much of this coming now
[59:15] people saying well
[59:16] the lord told me
[59:18] i had a confirmation when i was at this
[59:20] stage of my life hear this and this and
[59:22] this that this was the truth 40 years
[59:24] later they say it's of the devil
[59:27] they're either right
[59:29] or wrong
[59:31] but they were either wrong then
[59:33] or they're wrong now
[59:37] look at the spirits
[59:39] you see the pillar
[59:41] has been subjected to the storms of life
[59:44] and
[59:45] they didn't keep the pillar
[59:46] repaired
[59:48] they didn't keep the pillar protected
[59:50] they just let all of that wash away and
[59:54] blow and do all of these things and
[59:57] then one day they come my brother and
[1:00:00] sister
[1:00:02] just visiting with
[1:00:06] a man we do business with today and just
[1:00:09] had a lovely conversation with him to
[1:00:11] teach a marriage seminar to him he has a
[1:00:12] good marriage but didn't always have a
[1:00:15] good marriage
[1:00:16] and we got to talking about the things
[1:00:18] of god and my brother and sister it's
[1:00:20] wonderful to be able to just share
[1:00:22] without it being condemning
[1:00:24] just to build the blocks and put them in
[1:00:26] place of this is what god is doing and
[1:00:27] this is what god looks at and god's
[1:00:30] position on a vow and god's position on
[1:00:32] the family and god's position on all of
[1:00:35] these things and be able to build that
[1:00:37] up my brother and sister but you see if
[1:00:39] we come to a place where we say we have
[1:00:41] it all
[1:00:43] when someone says i just noticed the
[1:00:45] corner of your pillar
[1:00:47] has been eroded by the sands
[1:00:51] it's a crack in your foundation don't
[1:00:53] tell me i've been following this message
[1:00:55] for 40 years
[1:01:02] you know
[1:01:05] phrase that's common in the world today
[1:01:07] just saying
[1:01:10] but he said i'll make
[1:01:12] a pillar and a pillar is something that
[1:01:14] is stalwart
[1:01:17] loyal reliable
[1:01:20] hard-working
[1:01:23] now look how this works my brother and
[1:01:24] sister
[1:01:25] when you have somebody i hope this don't
[1:01:27] skin the nose off nobody here at the
[1:01:29] church but when you have somebody that
[1:01:31] says they got the holy ghost and they're
[1:01:32] so lazy they don't even support their
[1:01:34] family i would doubt they have the holy
[1:01:35] ghost
[1:01:38] i know that's just kind of a rough way
[1:01:40] to put it but let's get right down to it
[1:01:42] because somebody that's going to be a
[1:01:44] pillar in the temple of my god is going
[1:01:46] to be loyal reliable and hard-working
[1:01:49] amen
[1:01:50] pick up the pen and write can i wait
[1:01:52] till they invent the computer and i'll
[1:01:55] get it written down then
[1:01:57] writing gives a little cramp in my arm
[1:02:01] you imagine the apostle paul
[1:02:03] of all the affliction ailment of his
[1:02:05] life
[1:02:06] and god commissions him right
[1:02:11] might not even they said he wrote in a
[1:02:12] large letter
[1:02:15] you don't see him saying i would have
[1:02:16] wrote it all down for you saints of the
[1:02:18] age but it was just too hard for me
[1:02:21] no sir he was faithful loyal reliable
[1:02:24] hard-working
[1:02:26] and that's what god's looking for sons
[1:02:27] and daughters of god we don't want to be
[1:02:30] that one that it just is too much effort
[1:02:32] to really give a whole heart mind body
[1:02:35] and soul to the lord it took an effort
[1:02:37] for me to die and i just couldn't put
[1:02:39] out that effort that's called lazy
[1:02:44] am i preaching too hard tonight
[1:02:46] okay good good
[1:02:47] now look at this he says here and he
[1:02:49] shall go out
[1:02:51] go no more out
[1:02:53] amen i love that i'm gonna go no more
[1:02:55] out
[1:02:56] this one that's been made a pillar
[1:02:59] has the word
[1:03:00] has bonded together amen everything
[1:03:04] necessary the prophet of god said
[1:03:06] everything you need to take the rapture
[1:03:09] is already
[1:03:11] on the printing press
[1:03:13] already in the church library
[1:03:16] no sir in you
[1:03:19] why god knew what he was making the
[1:03:21] pillar
[1:03:22] he knew and he said i'm going to build a
[1:03:24] people that can stand every earthquake
[1:03:27] as it were every uh tsunami every uh
[1:03:31] tornado and hurricane and every whatever
[1:03:35] of life i i can i can just build this
[1:03:38] pillar in my word now look at this
[1:03:41] saints he built it in his word and that
[1:03:44] word was you
[1:03:50] i should have included that quote it was
[1:03:52] just pretty awesome and i'm not even
[1:03:53] going to try pretty complex i'm going to
[1:03:55] try and uh recite it to you and i will
[1:03:58] write upon him
[1:04:00] the name of my god
[1:04:02] now as paul is speaking my brother and
[1:04:04] sister to the corinthians he is making a
[1:04:07] very bold declaration now if you have a
[1:04:10] name written on you
[1:04:14] you're not cattle
[1:04:18] but probably a few hundred thousand
[1:04:20] times in my life
[1:04:22] i have burned someone's brand
[1:04:26] on a cow
[1:04:29] and every one of those cows walked out
[1:04:32] of the chute stopped
[1:04:34] turned around looked at me
[1:04:37] and said
[1:04:38] thank you
[1:04:39] for putting my owner's name on my hip
[1:04:44] i appreciate it
[1:04:50] are you with me saints
[1:04:52] sometimes being marked with the name of
[1:04:55] your god
[1:04:56] includes a little bit of pain a little
[1:04:58] bit of suffering a little bit of time
[1:05:00] but behind all of that there is healing
[1:05:04] and then the name the mark is still upon
[1:05:07] you when you are healthy and strong once
[1:05:09] again
[1:05:10] but there's a season that it takes for
[1:05:13] god to mark you that he could look down
[1:05:16] and say that's my son that's my daughter
[1:05:19] now you can go and research what brother
[1:05:21] branham says about or how he lays out
[1:05:23] predestination my brother and sister but
[1:05:26] we know
[1:05:29] now i'm not trying to ascribe as though
[1:05:31] we're some intellectuals
[1:05:33] but we know
[1:05:35] the cost now
[1:05:38] of having the name of jesus christ
[1:05:41] burnt into our soul
[1:05:46] praise the lord i thought all my i love
[1:05:48] testimonies like this i remember a young
[1:05:50] brother
[1:05:51] he i say young you know probably around
[1:05:52] 30.
[1:05:54] got up and testified one time he said oh
[1:05:56] when i got saved
[1:05:58] he said i clicked my heels together and
[1:05:59] thought praise lord all my troubles are
[1:06:02] over
[1:06:04] he said why didn't they tell me about
[1:06:06] what was coming
[1:06:08] but you see god
[1:06:10] was putting upon him his name
[1:06:13] and putting his name upon him he didn't
[1:06:16] say this is going to bring you trials
[1:06:18] and troubles maybe even separations in
[1:06:21] your family and friendships and might
[1:06:23] cost you jobs and opportunities in the
[1:06:26] natural but you're going to praise me
[1:06:28] one day that you are there with my name
[1:06:32] in you
[1:06:33] hallelujah
[1:06:35] hallelujah i just get excited about that
[1:06:37] saints when i realize what it is to have
[1:06:40] his name in me he's going to call that
[1:06:43] back one day and if that name is in me i
[1:06:46] have got it oh pardon me for putting it
[1:06:48] this way but i've got it made in the
[1:06:50] shade amen when he calls his word back
[1:06:53] and that word is full all the way from
[1:06:55] the tip of my toes to the top of my head
[1:06:58] to the tip of my fingers i don't have to
[1:07:01] worry about making the rapture when he
[1:07:03] calls his word home i'm going
[1:07:06] so what i've got to do is step into my
[1:07:08] rightful position the apostle paul did
[1:07:11] not say him that overcometh will i quite
[1:07:14] possibly make a pillar but he said those
[1:07:17] that overcome i will make a pillar
[1:07:20] amen it's a past tense it's a positive
[1:07:23] past tense
[1:07:24] amen
[1:07:26] and the name of the city of my god which
[1:07:28] is a new jerusalem
[1:07:30] now do you realize when you go into the
[1:07:32] word people are thinking that this is
[1:07:34] all staked out as it were but do you
[1:07:36] know in the spiritual context the new
[1:07:38] jerusalem resides in you
[1:07:41] that is the dwelling place of almighty
[1:07:43] god
[1:07:44] people are saying well you know the
[1:07:46] thunders what what is what is god's
[1:07:48] voice the seven thunders my brother and
[1:07:51] sister people blow these things all out
[1:07:54] of proportion and the seven thunders is
[1:07:56] summed or brought right down into the
[1:07:58] very simplicity it's god's voice to you
[1:08:02] it's not god's voice to some man over
[1:08:05] here or some man over there god uses
[1:08:08] them go look up what brother branham i
[1:08:10] think i shared a little of it on sunday
[1:08:12] look up what brother branham talks about
[1:08:14] john that when john did that mighty work
[1:08:17] and he come back down to earth and he
[1:08:19] laid down their mighty wings and without
[1:08:22] the anointing of that position he
[1:08:24] wondered is jesus the christ
[1:08:26] and jesus didn't start saying john what
[1:08:28] happened to your faith john what did you
[1:08:30] do john you were such a great guy until
[1:08:33] you started doubting jesus just told
[1:08:35] those servants of john he said you just
[1:08:37] sit right here in this service on a
[1:08:39] wednesday night in grace tabernacle and
[1:08:41] you watch the word come you watch the
[1:08:44] faith of the saints rise up and take a
[1:08:46] hold of their promise and then you go
[1:08:49] witness this back to john that this
[1:08:51] truly is the christ
[1:08:53] now i tell you my brother and sister
[1:08:55] that's what god's doing in this hour
[1:08:57] he's come right down and placed it and
[1:08:59] witnesses are standing here we are
[1:09:02] witnesses my brother and sister we are
[1:09:04] witnesses to the one that might be
[1:09:06] backslid to the one that is starting to
[1:09:09] doubt to the one that's faith is weak we
[1:09:11] are witnesses if we all lay down
[1:09:15] we've got nothing
[1:09:17] i'm sorry i'm speaking kind of strident
[1:09:19] i'm just
[1:09:20] very excited
[1:09:22] in fact my chest hurts i might be having
[1:09:24] a heart attack if i die
[1:09:26] amen
[1:09:27] well anyway
[1:09:29] hallelujah
[1:09:32] sister jerry says don't talk like that
[1:09:34] well
[1:09:35] you know brother dawn bablitz
[1:09:38] used to say lord when you take me i want
[1:09:40] to be in the pulpit
[1:09:42] he's over in africa in the pulpit fell
[1:09:44] over dead
[1:09:45] hallelujah oh romania that's right
[1:09:48] anyway everybody's like oh this is so
[1:09:50] terrible no it wasn't god answered his
[1:09:52] prayer
[1:09:53] came his heart's desire
[1:09:55] amen
[1:09:56] so the name of my god the city of my god
[1:10:00] it's new jerusalem which cometh down out
[1:10:02] of heaven from my god
[1:10:04] and i will write upon him my new name
[1:10:07] now we're not going to get into that
[1:10:09] tonight because that's a whole nother
[1:10:10] subject with about 42 000 opinions upon
[1:10:13] what that really meant but i'm telling
[1:10:15] you if you can just take it in
[1:10:17] simplicity tonight would simplicity be
[1:10:18] just fine remember that brand i was
[1:10:20] talking about
[1:10:22] my new name
[1:10:24] i'm telling you i don't need to discern
[1:10:26] that new name or figure out this or
[1:10:28] figure out that i'll be just happy
[1:10:30] to have it branded upon me
[1:10:34] i'll be happy to be identified as mrs
[1:10:37] jesus christ
[1:10:39] i don't need to have some other mystery
[1:10:40] of this or mystery of that my brother
[1:10:42] and sister prophet of god said some
[1:10:44] things that don't pertain to salvation
[1:10:47] you can just step back from those things
[1:10:49] you don't have to figure it all out
[1:10:52] we got people that are can't live it
[1:10:55] but they can explain it
[1:10:58] are they really explaining it
[1:11:00] if they can't live it
[1:11:02] no because the revelation of the life
[1:11:04] that's contained in the word is missing
[1:11:07] amen
[1:11:10] hallelujah
[1:11:12] now you ever wonder saints this just for
[1:11:14] a moment just look
[1:11:16] you ever wonder
[1:11:18] how you've progressed
[1:11:20] to the place where you have an
[1:11:22] unshakable faith in god
[1:11:27] i just walked into church one day
[1:11:31] i had it
[1:11:34] no sir
[1:11:38] it would almost be as though you would
[1:11:40] say here let me roll up my sleeve
[1:11:43] i can show you the scars
[1:11:47] let me as it were
[1:11:48] figurative
[1:11:50] open my tunic
[1:11:53] show you the scars
[1:11:57] you see faith
[1:11:59] cometh by hearing
[1:12:02] are you with me
[1:12:03] faith cometh by hearing
[1:12:06] and god's not afraid as the master
[1:12:08] surgeon
[1:12:10] to inflict upon you
[1:12:13] what we in the flesh call grievous
[1:12:15] wounds
[1:12:17] and he calls it
[1:12:18] his divine love
[1:12:21] oh my brother and sister without being
[1:12:23] in the right spirit will decide god's
[1:12:25] too cruel i've had people say it right
[1:12:27] to my face you know i used to follow the
[1:12:29] lord i used to be a christian i used to
[1:12:30] do this but god's too bloody for me
[1:12:35] well i want his blood
[1:12:37] if he hadn't let his blood be shed which
[1:12:39] was just pretty bloody
[1:12:41] amen i would be just covered in sin and
[1:12:45] trespass but he come as a lamb that was
[1:12:48] slain amen for you and i not just simply
[1:12:51] something quick and neat my brother and
[1:12:53] sister they beat him into submission
[1:12:59] he learned obedience by the things he
[1:13:01] suffered
[1:13:02] here's your exemption card
[1:13:08] didn't come from christ did it
[1:13:12] [Music]
[1:13:13] imagine
[1:13:15] god wants you to recognize when you've
[1:13:18] sold out and decide you're an overcomer
[1:13:20] there's going to be times
[1:13:22] that being the pillar
[1:13:24] is not convenient
[1:13:27] being the pillar is not easy
[1:13:30] but oh
[1:13:31] the glory
[1:13:33] have you ever been like state house or
[1:13:35] the capital
[1:13:37] and you go there in these big massive
[1:13:39] granite pillars
[1:13:42] do you ever look at them close
[1:13:45] i know i'm kind of weird
[1:13:47] i'm sorry
[1:13:48] not a weird pastor
[1:13:50] because i'm over there i remember the
[1:13:52] last time i was ever at the state house
[1:13:54] you're looking at these shiny columns
[1:13:57] but when you go over and actually rub
[1:13:59] your hand down them
[1:14:01] there's all kinds of little nicks and
[1:14:03] dings and scratches and pits
[1:14:09] and that's
[1:14:11] what they were
[1:14:12] to be a pillar
[1:14:16] pretty from the outside pretty from a
[1:14:18] distance
[1:14:20] but up close
[1:14:22] marked by every trial
[1:14:24] marked by every time of satan's assault
[1:14:27] upon you
[1:14:28] but you're still there
[1:14:30] and you're beautiful
[1:14:32] and you are in that position of strength
[1:14:34] because you were called to be a member
[1:14:38] of christ
[1:14:39] you're a member of his own body and he
[1:14:43] said i don't care how many nicks you
[1:14:45] won't find it in the word saints where
[1:14:46] he says now if you have exceeded the
[1:14:48] numbers of nicks dings and scratches
[1:14:51] you're out
[1:14:54] he said just stand
[1:14:57] overcoming power stand on the word stand
[1:15:00] on the word can i say it again stand on
[1:15:03] the word saints and no matter what comes
[1:15:06] and hits and strikes against you no
[1:15:08] matter who comes against you or what
[1:15:10] satan might bring you stand
[1:15:15] and in god's eyes you're beautiful
[1:15:17] you're perfect
[1:15:20] because he's not looking at those as
[1:15:23] defects
[1:15:26] glory
[1:15:28] in the tribulation
[1:15:30] you know that's what people say i just
[1:15:31] can't serve a god that could glory in my
[1:15:33] tribulation
[1:15:34] well tribulation work with patience and
[1:15:37] you know what happens is now say this
[1:15:39] with a little humor i hope you're not
[1:15:40] not upset about this because most of us
[1:15:43] will not pray for patience can i get an
[1:15:45] amen
[1:15:49] god says you need patience so he just
[1:15:51] sends tribulation and tribulation
[1:15:52] worketh patience
[1:15:54] so you're going to get the patience one
[1:15:56] way or another whether you pray for it
[1:15:57] or you don't
[1:16:00] amen i'll tell you what i lift my hand
[1:16:02] tonight and i don't just do this figure
[1:16:03] too i do it from my heart i lift my hand
[1:16:05] and say lord i want to be a pillar
[1:16:07] i want to be a pillar i don't care what
[1:16:09] it takes to be a pillar in the house of
[1:16:11] my god i want to be a pillar
[1:16:15] because you see you can go easier you
[1:16:17] can go hard but you'll go
[1:16:19] you'll be a part of that
[1:16:21] amen
[1:16:22] so you know i look at this sometimes i
[1:16:24] wonder lord how what brought me here
[1:16:28] you know you might find this interesting
[1:16:30] maybe not if you don't i'm sorry but
[1:16:34] looking through some of my mother's
[1:16:35] stuff today
[1:16:37] found a letter
[1:16:39] that my mother wrote back to her parents
[1:16:42] 1953
[1:16:45] she rode a bus a train an airplane
[1:16:48] all the way to panama
[1:16:51] to marry my dad
[1:16:54] and the very first words of these
[1:16:56] letters are
[1:16:59] david
[1:17:00] is so wonderful
[1:17:09] my god is so awesome
[1:17:12] my god is so wonderful
[1:17:14] when he said i want you to be my bride
[1:17:17] he didn't say i'm going to let it just
[1:17:19] be some little quick step there was
[1:17:21] something in me that we would ride the
[1:17:22] train the plane whatever it was to go to
[1:17:26] look him in the face and say my husband
[1:17:29] is so wonderful
[1:17:32] he's so beautiful to me
[1:17:34] now you know my mama was confused
[1:17:36] because she wrote in that letter that he
[1:17:37] was perfect
[1:17:41] but the letter we
[1:17:42] write we can declare him perfect
[1:17:46] we can declare him without fault
[1:17:50] and we can adore him beyond measure and
[1:17:52] not be an idolater
[1:17:54] oh hallelujah look at the privilege my
[1:17:56] brother and sister but right next to
[1:17:58] this letter in this this cabinet my
[1:18:01] mother had saved a postcard from her
[1:18:04] youngest son named paul
[1:18:06] who was backslid
[1:18:09] and is writing a postcard saying oh i'm
[1:18:12] just writing to say hello
[1:18:15] the work is good the money is not the
[1:18:17] best but the skiing is great
[1:18:20] and the only thing wrong is it costs a
[1:18:22] lot of money to go skiing
[1:18:25] and by the time you see this postcard
[1:18:27] i'll be in tucson i was living in
[1:18:29] colorado at the time
[1:18:31] and i look at that my dear mama
[1:18:34] has saved
[1:18:36] whatever you would call it a postcard
[1:18:38] from a backslidden kid
[1:18:42] right next to a love letter
[1:18:44] she wrote concerning her husband
[1:18:49] you see
[1:18:51] the time you didn't feel like a pillar
[1:18:55] the time you didn't feel like you were
[1:18:56] walking in god's will
[1:18:59] god said i'm kept right on building you
[1:19:02] up
[1:19:04] i have kept right on making you into
[1:19:07] what i want you to be
[1:19:10] might have a letter of your defeat i
[1:19:13] don't know i think i'm just going to
[1:19:14] quit serving the lord
[1:19:16] come on saints if i had a every letter i
[1:19:19] set down to write i'm resigning as a
[1:19:21] pastor through the years i'd need a
[1:19:23] whole file cabinet to hold them all but
[1:19:26] god looked at that and said oh he's
[1:19:28] feeling sorry for himself but i'm going
[1:19:30] to go ahead and keep the letter
[1:19:32] and then i'm going to remind him one day
[1:19:35] look i brought you through
[1:19:37] i brought you through your time of
[1:19:39] discouragement your time of weakness
[1:19:41] your time of failure i brought you
[1:19:44] through and i am not gonna condemn you
[1:19:46] but i will remind you that you were
[1:19:48] gonna quit
[1:19:50] i'm gonna remind you that you were
[1:19:52] attracted to the flesh and the sizzle of
[1:19:55] the world and i had to turn your eyes
[1:19:57] back
[1:19:58] and i say thank you lord for reminding
[1:20:00] me
[1:20:01] because otherwise the devil would make
[1:20:04] all the rest look even prettier
[1:20:06] but he says no nope
[1:20:09] you are a pillar
[1:20:11] in my temple
[1:20:14] and you will be in my temple
[1:20:17] you are
[1:20:18] my temple
[1:20:20] and i'm going to make you a stalwart
[1:20:21] christian to stand the spirits of
[1:20:23] laodicea to spa stand the spirits when
[1:20:26] it's your best friend or family member
[1:20:29] that's saying it's not true it's not
[1:20:31] good it's this it's that and god somehow
[1:20:34] just held you
[1:20:36] strengthened you and brought you through
[1:20:38] that and you come through that trial i
[1:20:40] tell you saints years ago i went through
[1:20:42] that my wife thought i was having a
[1:20:43] meltdown and i was reading all this
[1:20:46] garbage these people were writing and i
[1:20:47] found myself one day looking my wife and
[1:20:50] she says you're depressed and you get
[1:20:52] depressed when you read that garbage
[1:20:56] you see i wanted to help
[1:20:57] some of my friends
[1:21:01] sounds cruel doesn't it
[1:21:03] but the overcomer
[1:21:06] is helped by the word
[1:21:09] not helped by sympathetic friends
[1:21:12] not helped by those who prop them up
[1:21:14] what do we call that enabling
[1:21:17] they're not helped by us saying oh i'm
[1:21:19] so sorry
[1:21:21] they're helped by the word amen
[1:21:24] amen the prophet of god said the word in
[1:21:25] prayer is what changes things amen so
[1:21:28] don't go
[1:21:29] patting them on the back oh poor you
[1:21:31] poor you poor you my brother and sister
[1:21:33] for everyone who had a lousy pastor and
[1:21:36] gave up there's one who had a lousy
[1:21:38] pastor and pressed on
[1:21:40] amen for everyone that prayed for
[1:21:42] healing and never was healed there was
[1:21:44] one who prayed for healing and wasn't
[1:21:46] healed and pressed on
[1:21:48] amen
[1:21:50] come on what is god doing he's building
[1:21:53] a pillar
[1:21:55] an unshakeable stalwart faithful
[1:21:59] pillar
[1:22:02] oh my now verse 16. if we could go back
[1:22:04] brothers
[1:22:05] maybe i can
[1:22:07] somehow oh here
[1:22:09] go ahead brother mason get us back to
[1:22:10] verse 16 there in corinthians
[1:22:13] amen
[1:22:15] now some of this is pretty straight up
[1:22:17] young people i don't mean to put
[1:22:19] anything out in front of you that is but
[1:22:21] we're talking in the spiritual realm
[1:22:23] what know ye not that he which is joined
[1:22:26] to a harlot is one body for two saith he
[1:22:29] shall be one flesh now look my brother
[1:22:31] and sister we're looking now that
[1:22:33] applies to the flesh
[1:22:35] this applies to the flesh let's not
[1:22:36] let's not over spiritualize this and
[1:22:38] move it away my brother and sister you
[1:22:40] can't go out here and live in
[1:22:42] fornication expect god to bless you
[1:22:45] amen
[1:22:48] but look at this now in a spiritual
[1:22:50] realm
[1:22:51] which is joined to a harlot in one body
[1:22:55] now look what happened
[1:22:56] prophet of god
[1:22:58] said that when you introduce anything
[1:23:00] into the word
[1:23:06] he said it becomes a what spirit
[1:23:12] adulterous spirit
[1:23:18] but you see if you're not married to the
[1:23:19] word yet
[1:23:21] it would be fornication
[1:23:26] okay i know that's kind of strong words
[1:23:28] forgive me
[1:23:29] but look at this now
[1:23:32] look at the prostitute spirits of this
[1:23:33] age
[1:23:35] oh my
[1:23:37] come on saints
[1:23:39] anything for your money
[1:23:42] they will do anything for your money
[1:23:47] they'll have clubs they'll have games
[1:23:49] they'll turn the sanctuary into a giant
[1:23:52] whatever they'll even have i've seen
[1:23:55] where they've had poker night
[1:23:58] at church
[1:24:00] why
[1:24:01] prostitute spirit
[1:24:02] will do anything
[1:24:04] for your money
[1:24:06] kind of strong isn't it
[1:24:08] when you think about it so what is it
[1:24:10] the prostitute spirits of this stage
[1:24:12] amen those spirits are trying to get you
[1:24:14] yolk to something that can't produce the
[1:24:16] seed word
[1:24:18] they're trying to get you tied up tight
[1:24:20] to something that is not a legitimate
[1:24:23] producing a
[1:24:24] spirit producing the word
[1:24:27] amen that's why you know what look sorry
[1:24:29] i might come across like a grouchy
[1:24:31] whatever sometimes saying but we're not
[1:24:33] ever going to at grace tabernacle as
[1:24:35] long as god would allow me to have
[1:24:37] breath in my body to let some other
[1:24:39] spirit in that we would grow or be
[1:24:41] popular or have something that will be
[1:24:43] there the prophet of god said when that
[1:24:45] hap in the pot amen death is in the pot
[1:24:48] when that happens and i'm telling you
[1:24:50] i'd rather be a little church with life
[1:24:53] than a big church that's dead
[1:24:55] i'd rather be unpopular and unknown than
[1:24:58] to be known and have to do something as
[1:25:01] a quote inside my office says to do
[1:25:03] something that would hurt my lord
[1:25:06] hallelujah you see what is happening
[1:25:08] though they joined in one body amen they
[1:25:11] become one flesh and they can't separate
[1:25:13] themselves
[1:25:17] this is direct but they can't separate
[1:25:19] themselves
[1:25:21] they'll say amen to the word but they
[1:25:23] can't produce the life in the word
[1:25:25] now saints if you're a real believer and
[1:25:27] you're struggling in your life don't
[1:25:29] misunderstand me here you might be
[1:25:30] struggling in your life and you'd say
[1:25:32] i'm not producing the word
[1:25:34] but in your heart remember the prophet
[1:25:35] of god told that man
[1:25:37] backslid
[1:25:38] come back to the lord backslid again
[1:25:40] he's crying out i guess there's no hope
[1:25:42] for me and brother branham tells him
[1:25:44] because you are crying out i'm just
[1:25:45] paraphrasing because you're crying out
[1:25:48] it shows that god's still in there
[1:25:54] but what about when it comes down that
[1:25:55] they no longer care what the word said
[1:25:58] they no longer care
[1:26:01] come on saints i'm not talking about
[1:26:02] catholics
[1:26:04] amen
[1:26:06] oh come on
[1:26:08] oh my
[1:26:12] where am i at
[1:26:14] somebody help me
[1:26:16] invisible union yep that'll work
[1:26:19] okay
[1:26:21] i've got six minutes to be done
[1:26:23] jesus said you can't serve two gods at
[1:26:25] the same time you'll either serve god or
[1:26:28] mammon mammon is the world either loves
[1:26:30] the world or the things of the world the
[1:26:32] love of god is not even in him now my
[1:26:34] brother and sister i i want to make an
[1:26:35] emphasis on this to you tonight
[1:26:38] i realized one of the quotes i cut out
[1:26:40] kind of i
[1:26:42] shouldn't have
[1:26:44] the love of the world
[1:26:48] and we come to the house of god and say
[1:26:50] i love you lord
[1:26:52] i love you lord
[1:26:54] i love you lord
[1:26:56] and lord because i love you could you do
[1:26:57] something for me
[1:27:00] what is that no harlot spirit

[1:27:05] here
[1:27:06] lord just protect our young people
[1:27:09] but i tell you what when a woman offers
[1:27:11] herself in the natural to someone else
[1:27:13] for something in return
[1:27:16] do you realize that spirit can even be
[1:27:18] in a marriage
[1:27:23] oh come on i feel led to speak this out
[1:27:26] saints
[1:27:29] if you want to make love to me you'll do
[1:27:32] this and this or give this and this
[1:27:36] you can recognize where that spirit come
[1:27:38] from
[1:27:40] but we can't be over here in love with
[1:27:41] the world and tell the lord jesus christ
[1:27:43] we love him
[1:27:44] and
[1:27:45] not have prostitute spirit that's right
[1:27:49] he that loves the world the things of
[1:27:50] the lord the love of god's not even in
[1:27:52] him the seed of god can't be in him the
[1:27:53] same time the love of god the love of
[1:27:56] the world is in there so they've got to
[1:27:58] be completely completely separated you
[1:28:00] can say well you know what i i do this
[1:28:03] but i've got the holy ghost you're lying

[1:28:14] now okay
[1:28:16] i'm trying to be polite tonight
[1:28:20] the seed of god can't be him same time
[1:28:22] love of god the world's in there when
[1:28:24] the seed of god is operating through you
[1:28:26] that's the word of god
[1:28:29] oh i've got the holy ghost and well i'm
[1:28:32] irish or i'm this or i just simply have
[1:28:34] a temper
[1:28:36] actually we often times well look look
[1:28:38] at you know cain's altar was so much
[1:28:41] more beautiful
[1:28:43] than abel's
[1:28:45] and it was rejected
[1:28:46] but i'm here to tell you tonight the end
[1:28:48] doesn't matter what it is but
[1:28:51] this is right here look at the date on
[1:28:52] that if it means anything to you
[1:28:56] this is his closing word
[1:28:59] to the bride of christ
[1:29:01] in our day
[1:29:03] he's not mincing any words
[1:29:05] he's not patty caking this thing telling
[1:29:08] him now if i soft soap this they'll all
[1:29:10] remember me
[1:29:11] i don't know if he knew he was going or
[1:29:12] not but he started to speak of it
[1:29:14] he started laying that out a little bit
[1:29:16] when i'm gone and it'll be soon and this
[1:29:18] then that and you know it was there
[1:29:22] see neither can you bear god's sons of
[1:29:25] his word now this is why i made that
[1:29:27] comment earlier my brother and sister
[1:29:28] about producing the seed word
[1:29:31] neither can you bear god's sons of his
[1:29:33] word to this illegitimate denominational
[1:29:36] group you cannot do it in your incubator
[1:29:39] you cannot bring forth a word son of god
[1:29:43] oh thank you lord that he's put us out
[1:29:46] here and he has started putting us
[1:29:48] together he didn't incubate us in the
[1:29:51] fashion that the denomination did he
[1:29:53] incubated you my brother and sister and
[1:29:55] i mostly by experience
[1:29:59] now i want to know do you want to trade
[1:30:01] experience
[1:30:04] for intellectual intellectual would have
[1:30:07] been much easier is much easier come on
[1:30:09] come on you guys if you don't like to
[1:30:10] have patience and you don't like the
[1:30:12] scars and the scratches let's go for the
[1:30:14] intellectual it just means we take a
[1:30:16] book and we
[1:30:17] find out what it's all about
[1:30:20] god said no i'm not going to give it to
[1:30:22] you through a book
[1:30:23] unless it's the bible
[1:30:25] amen but you know what i'm saying i'm
[1:30:27] going to give it to you through a book
[1:30:28] he's going to give it to you by
[1:30:30] experience and when the devil comes and
[1:30:32] says you're following a lie you don't go
[1:30:34] back to the book to figure out if it's
[1:30:37] true or not you go back to your
[1:30:38] experience and my experiences says god's
[1:30:41] word is true and this word this message
[1:30:44] is true and the life that god is
[1:30:46] bringing me to live is true
[1:30:48] and i can count on that
[1:30:50] amen can you say i can count on that
[1:30:53] hallelujah
[1:30:55] hallelujah you still claim to be very
[1:30:58] religious so is cain the prostitute eve
[1:31:00] son very religious built offered offered
[1:31:03] sacrifice paid his tithes and done
[1:31:05] everything that any other religious man
[1:31:07] would do but he failed to keep that word
[1:31:10] he failed to have that rev the
[1:31:12] revelation and the revelation is the
[1:31:14] only thing
[1:31:16] what
[1:31:17] amen amen
[1:31:19] the revelation is the only thing
[1:31:23] wait just a second i've listened to

[1:31:44] experience every time
[1:31:47] every time the word being opened and
[1:31:49] made alive i'll take that
[1:31:52] hallelujah
[1:31:54] amen but he failed to keep that word he
[1:31:56] failed to have revelation and revelation
[1:31:58] is the only thing the revelation of the
[1:32:00] word that's christ himself
[1:32:02] what is the what is a revelation jesus
[1:32:05] said upon this rock i'll build my church
[1:32:07] and the gates of hell will not tear down
[1:32:10] the pillar in my temple
[1:32:15] hallelujah
[1:32:16] the gates of hell can't prevail against
[1:32:18] it faith is a revelation because faith

[1:32:24] this right back to the beginning and
[1:32:26] faith oh hallelujah has been revealed to
[1:32:30] you
[1:32:31] it's no longer my pastor said oh pardon
[1:32:34] me i don't mean this wrong but it's no
[1:32:36] longer what the prophet said
[1:32:40] i have faith in the word which is christ
[1:32:42] himself
[1:32:44] amen
[1:32:45] oh and by the way
[1:32:46] that's what the prophet said
[1:32:50] it wasn't my idea
[1:32:52] it wasn't my revelation it was a
[1:32:55] prophet's word so he stands right upon
[1:32:57] it
[1:32:58] amen the prophet of god come back and
[1:33:00] stood right here in this day right now
[1:33:02] he could say no other than the word he's
[1:33:05] already preached
[1:33:07] if our lord jesus was to come back and
[1:33:09] stand in the flesh in this hour he could
[1:33:11] say no other than what he has already
[1:33:14] said sister emmy would you come

[1:33:26] when the true worshipers
[1:33:28] shall worship the father in spirit
[1:33:32] and in truth for the father seeketh you
[1:33:36] to worship him
[1:33:38] hallelujah not just some in person any
[1:33:41] old person out here he seeketh such to
[1:33:43] worship him
[1:33:45] and god is a spirit amen
[1:33:48] that's right let's go right back i'm not
[1:33:50] going to go back but not just stir your
[1:33:52] mind to go back to our scripture
[1:33:54] amen a man be joined
[1:33:57] to a harlot
[1:34:00] or a man be joined to the word one
[1:34:04] produces carnal
[1:34:06] one
[1:34:07] is spirit
[1:34:09] and here we are
[1:34:11] it takes you right back to god
[1:34:13] you're right there in the spirit and
[1:34:15] they that worship him must worship him
[1:34:17] in spirit and in truth
[1:34:19] you see this other worship my brother
[1:34:21] and sister of this prostitute spirit of
[1:34:24] the day
[1:34:26] they worship beautifully
[1:34:28] they worship beautifully they they write
[1:34:30] songs that you're just like i love that
[1:34:32] song
[1:34:34] but you understand
[1:34:36] they've been joined back to a jezebel
[1:34:38] spirit
[1:34:41] and so all of that worship
[1:34:44] is not even recognized of god
[1:34:47] can we put it this way like maybe you
[1:34:49] you know you have certain music and
[1:34:51] maybe you can find it in a in a uh where
[1:34:54] they call it you know where you can
[1:34:56] gather all your songs together
[1:34:58] what would that what do they call that
[1:35:00] you have a
[1:35:01] i don't know it's like a file but
[1:35:05] well no like
[1:35:07] a playlist
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:09] yeah so you know like youtube or
[1:35:11] something like that you could go on
[1:35:12] there and say i i love this song and put
[1:35:13] it in there you love this song and then
[1:35:15] you can loop that thing and you can
[1:35:17] literally have your computer playing
[1:35:18] this music that you enjoy and that stirs
[1:35:20] your heart all day long you don't have
[1:35:22] to go in there and keep clicking on the
[1:35:23] songs
[1:35:24] right
[1:35:27] so here it is playing
[1:35:30] not off youtube
[1:35:33] from the voices
[1:35:34] of the people
[1:35:38] and words of songs will say
[1:35:41] and god hears my voice
[1:35:44] as it echoes
[1:35:46] through the heavens
[1:35:47] [Music]
[1:35:50] coupled to
[1:35:51] a harlot spirit
[1:35:53] god doesn't hear that voice at all
[1:35:58] it's just here
[1:36:01] what was it
[1:36:02] the beauty of cain's altar
[1:36:06] he said god catch this brother branham
[1:36:08] speaks of this
[1:36:10] god must
[1:36:12] accept my offering
[1:36:15] god had to do no such
[1:36:17] thing
[1:36:19] and he comes back to cain and says you
[1:36:21] know what if you adjust
[1:36:24] you would be acceptable
[1:36:26] and the anger of cain was kindle
[1:36:30] my brother and sister i'm going to use
[1:36:32] one last example analogy to you as i
[1:36:34] close

[1:36:47] ground
[1:36:49] the churches filled up
[1:36:51] people
[1:36:52] in the streets and in the parks on their
[1:36:54] knees crying out to god
[1:36:58] and i won't name all the dates because
[1:37:00] they're slipping my mind

[1:37:10] earthquake down there
[1:37:12] and the transition of the people
[1:37:15] at every disaster
[1:37:18] that had come
[1:37:20] the reaction of the people had changed
[1:37:24] until in 2010
[1:37:28] great tsunami swept the cities and
[1:37:30] there's miracles that god did concerning
[1:37:32] believers waking them up in the middle
[1:37:34] of the night and placing on a brother's
[1:37:36] heart get your wife and your babies up
[1:37:39] and run up the mountain
[1:37:42] and they're like why why i said i don't
[1:37:44] know but god's speaking to me and he got
[1:37:46] his wife and his babies and they ran up
[1:37:47] the mountain and where that house that
[1:37:49] they were in no longer existed not even
[1:37:52] a brick upon a brick
