believe our our lord likes to hear us testify of our feelings um of how we feel about what he's done for us uh giving glory to him and i think that's what he he desires is us to just as it were take a nice deep breath put our vocal cords to work and say thank you lord and praise the lord amen hallelujah good to be here tonight and uh just a lot of things on our mind but um you know sometimes you actually can struggle you know imagine it's you got the picture so full you can't even stir the lemonade and uh that's sometimes how the mind can be you just have so much that you you just don't quite know what to do but uh by god's grace tonight we will uh just kind of a little carry over from last wednesday just didn't you know i thought that was just kind of a thought that we would have and move on but i just found myself in this last week just coming back coming back coming back and so i'd like to speak to you tonight finding wisdom in the will of god and thank you so much amen each one of you just always beautiful just to praise the lord so we're going to be speaking tonight uh finding wisdom in the will of god and and it will touch on tonight and i know it's just very simplistic but remember sometimes we're just stirring up your pure minds in remembrance and uh so tonight we'll just hit a little bit on the difference between wisdom and knowledge because when it comes in the world they would say that's pretty much interchangeable but for sons and daughters of god we realize that there is a very significant difference in that amen let's stand and turn our bibles in the book of james the first chapter uh i've tried to cut out some verses so if it seems like i've kind of just started in a i wouldn't say awkward i don't think there's any place awkward in the scripture but you know if it seems like i kind of started awkward i just wanted to cut out i got quite a bit of scripture i want to be timely tonight james the first chapter starting with verse four but let patience patience we gotta let her have her perfect work my that's i know none of you struggled with patience this last week but um you know isn't it amazing how god chose something like that to be something to wear the edges off of us to fine-tune us to prepare us is that we simply just have to stop and say lord i want to just settle down right all these key ingredients another subject tonight so i don't want to spend too much time on it but oh look at all the key ingredients with that we have to we have to just stop as it were take the big breath and say okay now i wanted it to be that way or this way in this time which is usually right now and then it starts a process i'm talking about holy ghost-filled people it starts a process that we can get started almost as it were have one foot up and a hand on the doorknob and god says whoa whoa whoa there's other factors that i'm going to put in play or take out of play see we oftentimes are looking for what is put into play but how many times is it that god says you know i know satan's got a trap for you he's got some crazy inattentive driver over here that's had in my bottle before noon and he's fixing to run the red light down here the stops sign down here and therefore i want you to stop and just momentary i don't know if you guys ever have this momentary time you feel like just i don't i just feel the catheters yes lord just and you're not even praying for yourself that's right you might be thinking of someone else and used to stop and say oh lord i was thinking about brother so and so he he he kind of looked a little down a couple days ago and lord i just want to remember him and you drive down the hill and you see we often times like oh there was an accident there i think god saved me from the accident but you see the only one maybe that was supposed to be according to the devil's plan was you and them so there is no witness there is no fiery car wreck it was the devil's intent for you to be the fiery car wreck just example saints so that's why we have to let patients have a work and when patient says why don't you just stop and say a prayer that we're not so i'll do that later lord but we can just stop and that's the one side of patience and the other one is the critical molding of the inner man has nothing to do with anything external in other words that's the battle as the prophet declared it greatest battle ever fought that's the one that's being settled up here where we can smile and say god bless you god bless you and the battle is raging and people will never even know because we've become good at hiding that and there's nothing wrong with that right we don't want to come to church and fall down slobbering on the floor oh my life is a wreck but at the same time if satan can seize you up you'll move neither forward or even right or left you'll be froze right in that place but don't worry this work i have begun in you that wasn't a preacher that wasn't a prophet that wasn't a great man of god that was god himself he says i'm going to finish this and so you have to have patience to stop in the middle of your greatest battle and say the lord's coming he's on the scene he's coming there's an answer here he said he would raise a standard and now i'm just going to sit and let god raise a standard amen hallelujah i just preached a whole sermon we could dismiss on that but let patients have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing now entire means that you are complete if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not in other words he doesn't condemn us for lacking wisdom but we have to ask for it right and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the lord a double-minded man is unstable in just a few things no no no no this double-minded man starts to become unstable in every thing he does yes everything amen heavenly father we just ask you to come tonight lord just allow these thoughts father to lord just reach the heart lord only way it will do that father is if you come and carry them anoint them lord bring them according to thy will father we ask you for all the prayer requests lord and uh just thanking father the bride of christ in the far reaches of the world lord just to see the work that is being done father just ask your lord to lead and guide those brothers and this great work uh printing taking place inside of a pakistan lord right and you know they close the borders to your word and so you've taken your word right inside and printed it within their borders and father these many great works that is being done and i find it so amazing lord how china is cracking down upon christians so hard but yet so greedy for business they will print the gospel lord less expensive than anywhere else in the world and ship it lord you're an awesome god lord it's such a paradox as we look at these things but father we understand that your plan cannot be thwarted lord it cannot be stopped it will come to fruition and lord even if you have to make the devil labor for the bride of christ lord it will be done father we thank you now ask you to bless the service in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated yeah saints you know i think it's an interesting thing just to kind of put this out as just a little blip of the topic tonight while china is so hard on christians not just message believers but just anyone who is not holding to the three self church and holding two which is the national church you know the uh uh authorized church uh and they're cracking down on them so hard that yet while they are doing that they literally want everyone's money so much that you can go and have a book printed for fractions in china and uh shipped all around the world they'll even do all the logistics for you for less than you could print the book i think it's close to three to one that you can get three books in china shipped for one book printed in the united states i'll tell you what my god's got a sense of humor amen he said okay well the devil don't like the gospel so i'll just make him in his greediness chase this print this package this ship this amen all the while while he thinks he's accomplishing something amen so as we look at this tonight i just want to as i said finding wisdom in the will of god i want to move right into some scriptures here so we can just move on in a timely fashion uh james the third chapter just moving down the book just a little ways 13th verse 3 and 13. who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom so as we're looking at this verse we'll realize my brother and sister because someone would have a great level of knowledge or education or these things that the devil's trying to substitute for revelation in the word of god you know many people rise up and say you know what i i i'm an authority i remember years ago a man making a statement he said um you know people don't know what they're studying they don't know the message i am an authority on the message and you see god will not let these kind of things my brother and sister stay uncontested as it were because god has truth and he's not going to allow his truth to the bride of christ right we're we're talking a very narrow select group of people it's not just truth in general but it's truth coming to the bride right god loves you so much he's so jealous over aren't you glad that he is jealous over you he is so jealous over you that when it comes to the bride of christ anything represented as truth that is not truth he will expose it and as it were i would put it in this way because often times the exposing of truth is actually the destruction of a lie so god will come and literally allow the truth itself in the fact that it cannot be hid will tear down those things that were represented as truth and sometimes it's sad it breaks my heart the destruction of such sometimes is is the undoing of men and their positions and their authorities and influence and etc so we look here and and we take this who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you now my brothers and sisters will look at these scriptures i want you to catch this i don't want to just preach scripture to you i want you to catch what's behind this tonight because you see a man can declare that he is such a position he can declare that he has such knowledge he has such wisdom he has even in many cases men have tried to claim that they have authority over you right so you can have and men would come and say well i i'm an apostle so therefore you have to now be subject to me well how is it that you're confirmed as an apostle how can you be confirmed as a wise man how can you be confirmed as one with wisdom now let's just look at these scriptures here but if you have bitter injuring so if this man comes in his great wisdom and he calls us any kind of of envying and strife in your hearts you see there's a separation my brother and sister now don't misunderstand this this isn't a brother a a led of the lord to come and speak real direct to you amen now i'm going to pick on brother david tonight okay i won't see him for a week so i got to pick on it now brother david often times he preaches on being born again and that is a very familiar topic our brother david preaches on and you will have people that will feel like we've heard this before but my brother and sister there's no time that god ever wastes his effort or his breath or his time so if it is being ministered on sorry to use you this way brother david but i know that you're tough and and so anytime something like that is being brought out if people will stop and listen is that kind of preaching bring envy and strife in the church the only people who don't like that are the ones who are not examining their own life they're the ones that say how dare the preacher think that possibly and the preacher if he did have a preconceived idea might be looking on the other side of the church but you see it's their own conscience coming down and they're like how dare him preach on me like i don't have the holy ghost if see if they have wisdom and will touch on this a little further if they have wisdom they'll stop and their response will be this lord if this word being preached tonight is for me lord let me open up my heart and receive it and if it's for someone else and i am i am solid in the word i've got the holy ghost then i can lift a hand and say praise the lord the value the benefit the the blessing of being born again oh hallelujah but you see typically when the people get upset is because they think the preacher is judging them and i'm sorry but it's way bigger than the preacher it's so much bigger than the preacher people are actually undercutting god when they come down i hope you don't mind this demonstrative after they're undercutting the move of god in their life when they come and they leave this on the preacher [Music] they've just eliminated god entirely out of their conscience of their effort of their growth are you with me you see my brother and sister unless the preacher would be like oh control yourself paul i was just going to say unless the preacher be like sister carrie them tennis shoes are too blue you know i've been around services that the preacher was that petty that obvious you know what i mean not somebody dressed wrong i mean it's not like sister kerry sitting here with some you know eight or ten inch spiked heels you know and and the preacher just can't contain himself you know we're just talking about things where no we're not talking about that we're talking about god dealing down in the base level of our hearts and souls and and so my brother and sister when the word is preached that is not strife strife is when things are preached that tend to tear apart the fabric of the body of believers because it starts to pull people different directions so you see if one says that he's a wise man but he brings or then bitter envying and strife into your hearts and glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above right see the word of god being preached by the holy spirit anointing a man is going to draw people closer to god it's going to bring us to where my brother and sister our hearts cry day by day is lord forgive me and draw me closer had a conversation once with an individual and they were like well you know you're saying forgive me over this little thing but what is it you did see they didn't understand that all i wanted to do is just be right before god they didn't understand that it wasn't really about some kind of markable offense you know go to this day this time this minute this activity see they didn't understand that just wanting to be right before god maybe you have a little envying and strife and you just want to be right before the lord and so people tend to have to have a cause and effect but i'll tell you what the cause and effect is the holy ghost in you is causing you to draw closer and the refiner's fire is purifying you each and every day bringing you closer to a pure relationship with the lord amen so with this wisdom this talking about that brings us envying and and strife and and uh these things uh this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual and devilish that's pretty strong words isn't it amen for where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work my i tell you what i want to preach the truth to you church i want to preach something i don't have to be ashamed of stand before god of what i represented but i never want to be a tool that would cause this like oh well hallelujah we've got this side versus that side and the front versus the back and these people versus those people my brother and sister we are a body of believers and the only way the body can function is to be connected but there are spirits that would come they seem to specialize in splitting churches they seem to specialize in splitting friendships and fellowship they they seem to work quite well with that makes you wonder here this says that it's earthly sensual and devilish but the wisdom that is from above is first pure okay so it has not been contaminated it hasn't been added to or taken away from it is a pure wisdom and and i hope be patient and god merciful to me tonight we tie this together but this wisdom that is from above is first pure then just exactly the opposite of this other spirit this one is peaceable this is the one that's saying you know what i know there might be a fuss between this family and this family but you know what we're believers we're christian let's pray about it let's come together let's talk this out let's leave our emotions and and all of these things uh on the side here and just get this worked out and you know oftentimes those of you that have talked to me about little different issues you would know that i i am right off the bat my first thought is i don't have an answer so you think oh brother paul might have a little wisdom but actually it is i just simply don't have an answer for you so go home and pray about it that's the safeguard for the preacher you go home and pray about it but you know what through the years many of you have never come back and i have to tell you i'm a curious person and i'm like okay they asked me about something and my advice to them was go pray about it and they never come back and you just want to ask them what happened i have a time or two what happened oh we prayed about it and god gave us the answer i like that it shows that it works it shows that god is hearing the prayer the cry of his saints and and he's giving that my brother and sister you didn't need a priest in the middle of that you didn't need a pastor preacher evangelist or something because we have a direct amen access to the throne room hallelujah amen that that sweet little sister down there well actually sister jerry says she's not as young as she looks but down there in louisiana i don't know if you've heard that song what what is that what's her name jerry haley cross she sings that to having a talking about having direct access to the phone throne room it it's a it's a moving song amen the little girl's got lungs like bigger than i am and and she just sings so beautifully but my brother and sister my point being is we have direct access to the throne room we don't have you know a little deal you know how they have in these big buildings i have a little chart how to get out of the building you go down this hall you turn here you go there you go no we don't have one of them my brother and sister we have direct access to the throne room hallelujah now you still might need to post that in your bedroom so you don't get caught up in all these other things but remembering that i have direct access to the throne room so we're looking now that the wisdom that is from above is first pure then it's peaceful and it's gentle my you don't need to be abused by a preacher you don't need somebody to tell you you're foolish and stupid you know whatever you don't need that my brother and sister that spirit comes from somewhere else amen it's gentle and easy to be entreated in other words you can approach and you can pour your heart out without being ridiculed or beaten down over it isn't this interesting i just love this i i you know i've read the book of james a few times and it just never struck me like this and i look at this and i'm like my i wish i'd remembered this and just held this up now i know this is kind of a rude way to put it but you know maybe if we have this on a mylar so you could look through it you know you could hold it up and be like they flunked yeah that's kind of a rude way to put it but you know they're meaner than a junkyard dog and and they don't really care about you you know uh all these things you know it takes this much to make the preacher mad and then the very next service you're going to hear about it you know my brother and sister i wish i'd had that in my youth i don't know if i'd had courage enough to stood up and said um hey brother so and so you don't pass james 3. but the reality of it is the bride has been given this revelation not for us to criticize not for us otherwise be guilty of the very words we're reading here but it's for us to look and recognize the spirits of our day you see christ didn't come to beat the lamb before he redeemed it you follow me now he is the lamb was beaten but he didn't come to beat us before he redeemed us he come the scripture says to bind up our wounds amen to put amen the salve upon us that our broken hearts and our shattered lives can be put back together amen amen easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace amen i want to be one of those kind of people my brother and sister i want to preach the truth to you but i want to preach it in love i want to preach it in such a fashion that when you hear it you know that's the truth and i know that why the way it's been brought to me presented to me is god doing this amen now i want to draw from this if i i can tonight uh the two patterns right there's always two spirits in the framework of the church right and so i want to draw it with that thought in mind draw from this wise in the ways of man or wise in the way of god so i think really it ultimately comes down to these two paths that we are led to amen now we know that uh uh god did not will not ever take you away from his word right so god's not going to say oh i'm going to let them go over here and do this and do that and i'm going to just draw them away from the word my brother and sister brother branham is very clear about that that the word is in you amen and you are in the word so he cannot separate you because that would be pulling the word itself apart and so it would be god taking a part of himself and as it were ripping it out of himself and casting it away so god will never lead you away from the truth and so we're either going to become wise in the ways of man or wives in the ways of god and wise in the ways of man produces the spirit of the age now you can find several references of brother brown not in these exact words but if you just study and keep that in the back of your mind you'll find many references of what brother branham branham's talking about that and uh he talks about it on the positive side that these men could only preach the word for their day so i would take it now this is just my reading of the word so don't don't get too excited or wound up with this but i read some of what brother branham says there and i kind of see myself maybe just a little shadow that some of these men actually had more revelation than god called upon them to preach in their day so in other words god put them to a certain place and said stop right here and i take a little reference back to talking about the mercy seat and coming to that and saying but we won't speak about that in particular at this time was it they were totally void of knowledge no i believe god was there we can see a reference of john uh looking into uh the book of revelation looking into the time and uh god telling him to seal it up he had revelation he had the word he could have as it would have been left to his own device he would have been revealing in that day mysteries that were meant to be revealed in this day and so god says no close up the book don't write that so i i kind of myself hold just a little bit not a big deal but just a little bit that many of these men of god through the ages actually had a little greater revelation than god anointed them to preach in other words they themselves might or heard a voice saying seal it up now just because god never put it down in scripture that he told them that but he would anointed those men the season is not right don't preach that and these are godly men god spoke to these men god used these men the supernatural took place in their ministries but god says i have a season i have a time for this mystery as it were to be fully revealed and i'm not going to throw it out and give the devil all this time to chip away at it now it seems like in the day we live right now the devil's had plenty of time to chip away on it but imagine the results he would have if he had had you know a thousand or so years or something so you look at that and realize now the wise and the ways of man produces the spirit of the age second timothy uh three this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come so this is not speaking of middle dark ages right look pretty perilous to me right i s when i study history and i study the dark ages to me that would qualify that's perilous times but you know that ox anointing god brought that down upon those men and women and even children and and they were under that anointing and imagine now as we said here and we our minds would say oh my how could they do that under that anointing they were just like i have to give my life for the gospel no problem here i am but you see in this last layer to see an age here we'll see my brother and sister it's another type of giving your life for the gospel right at this point in time we don't know what the future will hold uh what god has wrapped up you might say in his word but at this time right now the word of god actually declares that the great battle that we fight in this day is greater than it was in the dark ages so there they gave their life's blood even the stories that were there that they wanted to stand at the stake don't even time me don't chain me i'll just stand here i won't be running away and you know history shows they never did that again because in the midst of being burnt to a crisp they lifted their hands and their mouths open and the people there said they were worshiping and the devil said oh my i never thought these people would be so anointed they should have been scribed screaming and crying in agony begging they should have instead catch these things that's right how strong the anointing was the anointing overcome that evil of the age it overcome the effects of fire it overcome all of these things and you know what they could not comprehend in that day how people could choose willingly to go there but don't look at that and say my that just gives me the shivers i want you to realize there's more anointing in our day than there was then there's more power of god revealed in the bride of christ today than there was then oh my brother and sister you say how can you say that brother paul because the power of god is a revealed word amen they had the word for their day and it was sufficient thereof now look at this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady highminded lover of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away don't entertain them there's too many people have this idea well you know what if we just rub shoulders with these spirits maybe we can convince them no you've got to get through the anointing that's on them first before you'll ever get to them and that anointing is actually my brother and sister stronger than we are that's why we have to be sealed with the holy ghost to face the spirits of the age you don't go brother brown talks about going down india and these different places and all those spirits and he said unless you know where you stand i'm paraphrasing this unless you know where your stand don't go there because you're talking about spirits that are so powerful but you look at this now i want you to see and i'm going to throw something that's semi-political in here and i hope you don't mind but my brother and sister look in the world we live in today uh governor of the state of new york the man declared himself literally almost verbatim in words here back a couple years ago he was invincible as a governor and he could probably reign as long as he wanted to and because he fought he had so much sway with the people but you see we find how that god can take and this spirit of the devil which thinks that it has free reign to do anything he wants god comes along and says you know what your season now let's take this i'm not going to name them all but you can take this back in the bible of all these kings that thought they were equivalent or greater than god and they thought that they were going to rule forever and then poof they're gone and so now we have this same thing being manifested in our day rulers with an unclean kingdom and god says i remove you now the what is that movement the me movement or whatever that was you know where women were coming out being more vocal and whatever i forget what that was called why didn't this take place seven years ago when that movement first started yeah he's been doing it for 20 years now is the time that's right the season it wasn't about enough women of enough credible character to come and derail this it's the season it's a time and god says now for everything there's a season and now there's a season that i'm moving this now is it all about we're going to have justice and equality no sir no sir brother branham told us they rejected jesus christ and this country is doing nothing but going downhill and what scares me is you know when an airplane first starts to dive um you know they don't make a whole lot of noise brother david's flown uh i've been on a plane a few times they don't make a tremendous noise right when they start to dive but when they've picked up maximum speed and that thing's fluttering and shaking they start making some strange noises and our nation is starting to make some strange noises so it's tipped over from this as it were uh you know people were angry when barack obama said the united states was not a christian nation and it just went from border to border uh people just angry that it's not but you know he told the truth he actually was telling the truth so what is this this is describing the nature of our nation right here and you say well brother paul um i don't know i mean is that right would would that be look right here in our wonderful little city of boise they create their own phone number for you to turn in your neighbor for doing uncovered like behavior which uncovered like behavior is where you check your brain in and you just do what they tell you that's uncovered like behavior so people in boise had experiences of having family over for a birthday party in their backyard and the police coming and bashing the gate open and coming in there and telling them disperse an hour will arrest you right here in our town see so this is the world it is see this is what was happening in this day in the dark ages if you if you go into a fox's book you'll look in there and realize it was neighbor against neighbor family member against family member we have a promise of that in our day saints we have a promise that that is still going to come okay i need to hurry along here i said i'm not going to elaborate on all of this because you guys are so we have right here in second timothy 3 just a picture of wise in the ways of men amen now wise in the ways of god let's turn into first corinthians 3 18 let no man deceive himself oh lord help us because i'm telling you saints i've embraced this statement for years now that the greatest fool is the fool who fools himself amen so let no man deceive himself if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness we're seeing that happen every day and again the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain therefore let no man glory in men for all things are yours whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours and he was obviously just talking to somebody way back there in history that we'll never meet no sir he was talking to you and i he was telling us your rightful position of sons and daughters of god is not all in the millennial in the millennium we're going to this and we're going to that my brother and sister sons and daughters of god are going to take authority on the earth right now amen the word shows us so clearly footsteps are possession and i want to know what did you claim what are you claiming or are we sitting back and saying well i'm just going to sit here until until until you see there's a difference of following a directive of the word or coming to a situation where you need god to reveal his will to you amen see many times god's already gave us the answer we either kind of don't like the answer or we haven't been diligent enough to study the scripture to know that the answer is plainly before us are you okay with that i i firmly believe that's the truth many times we have just simply glossed over and said i don't see the answer but the answer lies right there before us so close that out ye are christ and christ is god's so here again see we are in christ and he has all authority in all possession and all ownership and we're in him we don't need to sit back and say devil is it okay devil can can you just give me a little time a little whatever no it's yours and you've been given the authority to apply that to your life and your family your church and literally to every ministry and whatever that's a part now i've heard it said that wisdom is knowledge but you'll look at this and realize i i should have maybe had this to put up on the screen but i'm just going to take uh the definition of wisdom the very first line that they put up here uh is a knowledge that is gained by having many experiences in life now my brother and sister we can say well this is a wise man but what really matters to you and i is wisdom in the things of god it's not really that we're wise that we can look at charts of the stock market and say oh you know in three weeks this will go up or down right brother scott see it's something it's that's a science that's something you know people like me wouldn't i wouldn't have a clue but you study those and you see that that's wisdom my brother and sister and there's wisdom many of you would probably be a a little bit nervous about going out and taking you know 40 50 60 70 000 worth of seed and putting it in the ground and hoping everything would grow i have wisdom i learned it the hard way but you know that's how a lot of that comes but you see we want to look at this now wisdom coming in the ways of god wisdom comes by the experience of the triers trials you go through fiery trials that's why he says you know don't get all depressed and shook up and tore up about these fiery trials you're going to face because you're gaining wisdom and we start to see that satan's tactics we start to see how satan would do my brother and sister and then we start to recognize okay now this happens satan tries to come and follow this and so we start and we gain this this wisdom in this and it is not really our wisdom it's not wisdom that we personally have gained but it's actually us growing in christ so as he is working in our life this is part of the mystery of christ being revealed my brother and sister he knew the devil when he saw him and that's a problem many times people have they don't know the devil when they see him he comes so camouflaged he comes in such a way presents himself in such a deal then people trip over that but you see i want you to think about your life think about what god's doing the holy ghost in you is causing satan to his camouflage is being taken away and we're starting to see and and it doesn't mean you don't make mistakes but one of the things about making mistakes is correcting it as soon as possible and that's one of the angles that the devil likes to use right because if we have if our heart condemns us not then we have confidence in god so satan comes along and just keeps giving us this condemnation pill and we don't know what it is so we just keep taking it and i've known people that once delivered from that said i've went years in the message under a cloud of condemnation but when they got delivered they're like never going back never going back i realized that what did they do they grew up they recognized they're in christ it's not in today and out tomorrow or in this evening and out by midnight my brother and sister we are christ and christ is god's so look take what the prophet of god said he names off all the different deity all the different names and he says this is all god so you belong to god god's in you you're in god amen seems pretty simple but some people struggle now going down in the full definition of wisdom it says accumulated philosophic or scientific learning and right behind that it puts the word knowledge you see how it separates those even though they're so close in definition now let's just go to knowledge itself it's information it's understanding it's a skill you get from experience or education an awareness of something a state of being aware of something now my brother and sister i want to put this if i can being aware that god is moving is not the same as being part of god's movement amen too many people are aware that god is moving but they're not in the wisdom experience to be in the movement that will be the difference between an intellectual in revelation revelation puts you into the very move of god intellectual makes you aware that god is moving did that come out okay it come out much better earlier today when i preached to myself i i that's one thing i just dislike you know it just seems to flow when you're in the shower or the tractor but see people going to get caught in another reality my brother and sister where they feel like because they know brother brown said this in this message and he said this in this message and before this time he preached it this way and at this time god dealt with him and now he preaches it this way and we do that and they can lay that all out and so they're aware that god is moving they can put a timeline they can put all of these things to it but come right down in the day that we're living right now and look back and say yeah this has to happen or that has to happen or this is and the word that they believe they understand is saying no it's it's me god in you right and so now you know we were just discussing this the other day how do we digest the prophet of god talking about us being able to speak another world into existence and go live on it see most of us just immediately i i don't mean to put the blanket the most is not you it's the others most of us just shut off on that because we can't comprehend anything even resembling speaking another world into existence but do you know what the bride's doing the bride right now this has so many avenues saints and it could get a little convoluted but the bride right now is standing on this place we call earth but we have spoken another world into existence right here we are not in a world oh my that's right hallelujah you guys got anything to do till midnight we are not in satan's eden we are in another world no i'm not explaining how what the prophet of god said i'm just telling you the reality of this is those things that are not as though they are and those things that are as though they are not and the bride is not sitting here going oh my goodness the nation is going bankrupt we knew it was going bankrupt it's prophesied to go bankrupt in fact we might actually find ourselves going hallelujah it's going bankrupt because that means we're one step closer and so the reality of it is we've stepped into a world that god our lord jesus christ is the ruler of see he's the ruler of satan's eden he's got it all encompassed he's got it all wrapped up it's working quite well for him but the bride has stepped into another place and there's several avenues we could take off of that tonight but it's not really my topic so i just want you to look at this you see the world's going to declare that you are caught in a different reality an alternative reality or a false reality but my brother and sister i'm going to take the bible over what man science this that and the other has got to say about anything i'm simply going to take the word of god because in my own life now let's go back to wisdom that is from experiences can we say tonight god's given us some wisdom amen we know god answers prayer we know god is in control we know that even when we fall god's right there to catch us and wrap his arms around us and say my son my daughter i'm right here have confidence trust me we know these things and so we're not sitting here blindly looking out saying well there's a god he's far off we don't know maybe he's out beyond the eagle nebula no sir he's right here in our midst in fact the word says he's in me he's in you so our reality is the reality of the word coming to pass now let's look in the queen of sheba here there is uh a little bit let me explain this brother branham here and the queen of sheba is sharing of a conversation he was having with a rabbi and uh so i cut right into this so you can go look and read the rest about that for the sake of time brother brown says because he's talking to him about the truth and the man's acknowledging there's truth there acknowledging that that jesus christ had to be a prophet that's as far as he could get but you know had to be so then under that if he's a prophet he can't lie see they they would recognize that as a prophet of god he couldn't lie so therefore they had to listen to it okay he said i'd rather be down there begging and drinking branch water then eating chicken three times a day and my name in gold on this temple here and no i was in air i'd rather be truthful and he started to cry and he turned around and said i'll see you later and i said you're not honest with me rabbi and he said i believe if them temple priests would have listened to him we'd be better off today and i said then you believe what about it he said i believe he was a good man i said rabbi do you believe he was a good man said i go further than that with you i believe he was a prophet i said that's all i want you to say then he said he was the son of god and then if he was a prophet he can't lie so therefore you believe he was the prophet the son of god he showed the sign of the messiah now look my brother and sister what i'm going to bring out i don't want to get myself all tangled up here let me just finish this and he wouldn't talk to me no more he went in the place oh brother what that love of money will do what a love of some ecclesiastical form will do but this now if i could have the liberty tonight to put a giant separation here because these two are not connected this is a man telling him if ice spoke that i would be out on the street that's what was above where i started brother i'm saying well i'd rather be i'd rather be doing that than be where you're at because you know the truth so let's put a gap in here almost like draw this and put it down here because it's not even connected with this man but what the love of god will do then to a heart that's willing to surrender to the will and the ways of god amen let's find wisdom in this quote saints let's find wisdom here's a man who has studied the scriptures has made an acknowledgment we would be better off if they had listened he has to be a prophet brother branham puts it to him well son of god the man does not deny that but he can't get over that 401k the house he lives in the cory drives his life experience was not enough to compel him to pursue christ he had knowledge he did not have wisdom that's kind of a heartbreaker isn't it yes i pray god don't let don't let us lord in this church and those around us lord don't let us come to the place that we have knowledge but we don't have wisdom that's right we don't have enough life experience now since i don't like to be negative and i actually don't bring these things in a negative light but there's people that said i'm done with this message and walk away my brother and sister they had knowledge they had a knowledge but they didn't have the experience to back it up i pray even if you're crying out saying oh lord have mercy on me the trials are too great i i pray i'd rather see you there and god come on the scene then god just answer and make it all peachy for you because it's going to take a real experience a real wisdom my brother and sister as it comes down says to be so close to deceive the very elect and people are like well you know the pentecostals are this and this is over here and that's and and they're preaching the message i listen to those things they are preaching the message what's that got to do with it because the deception's not going to be whether the upc is preaching the message or not the deception is going to be right here in our message church that's where it's at you see the real wisdom this this could be contested so please don't judge me harshly here the real wisdom is in god's will you see if we are walking in god's will god cannot allow you to walk in his perfect will and then condemn you that your walk was not good enough he can't do it my brother and sister not the path that men say god told me to walk in but the one that god led us to which would be according to the word wouldn't miss a drop see there's no wisdom just thinking of this man brother brown's song did there's no wisdom in pressing against the word of god and there's no wisdom in pressing against the will of god brother branham ties it together and says god's will is his word so people are saying well i disagree with that but i'm in the will of god no no impossible impossible saints you cannot be out of the word and claim to be in the will it won't work there again now i'm not calling any man a fool scripture says not to do that but i'm telling you the worst thing in a way is the fool who fools himself so he says i i disagree with those things that paul preached but i'm in the will of god you know the lady with the raspy voice that's on television that has a big church i can't think of her name right at the moment joyce meyers i listened to an interview with joyce meyers where she says she had pastored the church for years before someone come to her and showed her in the scripture where she didn't have a right to do what she was doing but she's still doing it because she said after that she prayed and god revealed to her it's nothing short of a lie now okay i'm not picking on joyce meyers the woman actually has some very inspirational thoughts and whatever i mean if that's where you shop you know i mean even walmart has some good stuff on the shelves i shouldn't have said that brother tim works at walmart they support him but anyway but you see you come down and you say well okay god spoke to me you realize we're not saying that god said you're special and i'm making exemption for you you're actually saying god's a liar so we can't go against the word of god and even come close to making a declaration we're in the will of god so first corinthians are we okay kind of kind of okay i gotta hurry first corinthians two now lengthy and let let us just go through this quickly and brother when i come to you i came not with excellency of speech so don't don't be thinking i'm some really intellectual guy or of wisdom now you see this wisdom just like i spoke to you the other day sometimes you can have these words that seemingly now there's a contradiction but you have to take the whole big picture of this because he's talking now as it would be a man who would come and say i was part of the sanhedrin and i have spent 30 years studying these things and god speaks to me you see there's a whole nother avenue we're just touching on the edge of it whole another avenue of presenting it he's saying i i didn't come to you as some kind of intellectual authority declaring unto you the testimony of god do you realize now i just want to touch on this again i i keep saying i'm not going to do this but i just have to my brother and sister the only way one can declare the testimony of god is to get in where the testimony is at the testimony of god is not to go out and say god's in the church over there and god's in a church over there and god's in nature and god no to be able to truly share the testimony of god you have to figuratively if you want to call it that climb into the ark because that's where the testimony is at yes the testimony is not out on the street corner the testimony is not revealed of god after you got home from a night of dancing for i determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified i like preachers like that yes they don't need to do homework they don't need to go around it's like what's going on with gabriella no sir they can just go pray and if something is preached and it touches her life she can have confidence with god talking to me and young people i want that to be your story when you grow up it wasn't as though you know i think sometimes that's where where you know preachers kids and grandkids have a problem because you know they're around uh they're around the preacher all the time and they kind of feel like well that wasn't really god speaking to me that was my dad or my grandpa cancel that idea we have cancer culture in the world today and we ought to do we ought to join i've joined the council culture do you know that the devil said this i canceled them the devil did this i cancelled them amen the devil tried to raise this up i canceled them amen so he said i determined not to know anything among you i didn't go snoop your lives i didn't go spied and peek over your back fence i only wanted to know one thing among you saved jesus christ and him crucified because if we get christ in our midst paul had a revelation that's all it takes no special this no special that just get god our lord jesus christ in our midst and the problems are solved and i was with you in weakness and in fear man this is not the guy i thought he was and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men right now this is why saints i really wanted to drill that to you down there we're either going to have this wisdom that is in the ways of man or wisdom in the ways of god and the apostle paul is laying this down here i don't want your faith standing in any form or fashion in the wisdom of men but i want it to be built in the power of god howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect see a whole nother wisdom this is where i got my thought out of this a whole nother wisdom we've got this wisdom of men and i don't want you to be built in this but we have another wisdom over here we got a wisdom that is this supernatural wisdom we got a wisdom amen that i speak of among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to naught amen i don't know about you but i get excited about this but we speak the wisdom of god in oh no here's a mystery the thing we don't like about mystery saints as a minister as a pastor is i can't go downstairs or wherever the coffee machine is and print off the mystery and just hand it out to you all you're going to have to pray you don't have to be diligent you're going to have to the scripture says sigh and cry you're going to have to seek after the scripture says even with bitter tears in other words you're going to have to pursue this mark of the high calling you're not going to be able to stand there on the curb and say ah hi calling hi calling mystery even hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world into oh i love this he just do you see my name up there i see your name up there amen all in those three letters he included us right into this he put us right in here ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew none of them will know your glory amen for had they known that they would not have crucified the lord of glory but as it was written i hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed unto them uh hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god i want to tell you when you get in the spirit and you are desiring answers and leadership from god this is not a you know how you put something into the search on the computer and they're so proud of themselves you push enter and bing things pop on the screen and it tells you to come up with 100 uh 1123 and 0.54 of a second but you look through all that and they don't have all the information they gave you what was the pre-loaded version of the most sought or what somebody paid them to put me at the top of the list this might seem silly to you forgive me but you see he's revealed them to us by spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep oh can i emphasize that to you not the super how do i come closer to god how do i live an overcoming life no sir it searches the deep and it starts to deal in that life and it starts spitting these things out of the spring it starts washing it starts preparing because we're dealing with the deep things amen we're not dealing with superficial i was a christian until i got discouraged i was a christian until this happened i was a christian to have the deep things and down in the deep things is the mysterious thing and the mysterious things is the revelation which the word showed was god in you in this hour manifesting not talking about the word not reading about the word manifesting the word that the very life that is jesus christ is now inside of us coming for and my brother and sister that's deep that's deep hallelujah amen not the superficial i attend the big church down here i'm on the softball deal and i'm on the dance committee and i'm on the food committee and i'm on this i'm a christian no sir an anointing oh if i can tie this back to you an anointing so strong then in such a wicked age that we live in anointing so strong that would cause a man or a woman to say i'll serve god with every last breath of my body and if i have to say forgive me lord a thousand times i'll say it a thousand times and i will move forward because i know that the deep things of god was christ coming down in me and manifesting in a day that is so intellectual but has completely missed god god hath revealed them unto us by spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but this spirit of god you know what's taking us saints into the deep things of god into the mystery of god god himself and i'm telling you you know they made movies years ago i never watched them i just knew that they were there about the tombs in egypt and you know the guides taking them down doors that slide and hidden this and whatever sounds scary but you know what's scarier than that is a person trying to lead himself into the path of righteousness in laodicea that's more scary than any scary movie about tombs in egypt is a person that would say oh i have a revelation what is your revelation doing what's it saying what's it producing you know i dealt with some individuals quite some time back and they literally looked me in the face and said we do like do not like you using the word manifested manifesting um i i guess i'm not bright enough to understand this we don't like it well you know my mother had to beat it out of me or tried to when i was little there's some little streak in paul i'm still dealing with the lord's deal with me trust me just you know pray for me but you tell paul he can't and there's just something inside of me that says well just watch and i didn't do this intentionally but i found myself manifested manifesting going to manifest have manifested here is the manifestation i'm sorry i can't help it because you see that's the very evidence of god in me if i say god's in me and you can't see a single shred of evidence that god is in me we've got a problem well i do for sure so what knoweth the things of god knoweth no man let me get this right amen even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god amen god's opening the bible to you that's god he's your personal tutor kids you know kind of how mom maybe helps you home school or whatever it might be you got a personal tutor and god's saying right here look at this mystery look at the word that's me but i'm here with you see i'm showing you that i'm on the written page but i'm also in you hallelujah now we have received so there's been some receiving going on he's making acknowledgment there's been some receiving going on now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god oh my brother and sister i hope you can see this you see with the mind i forgot to put it in the list i'm sitting there looking going up that scripture but you see the apostle paul says we have the mind of christ you realize with the mind of christ comes wisdom amen do you realize my brother and sister it's true wisdom amen and with that wisdom by experience we see the mystery of god not an educated declaration of historical and future tense but the real life god manifesting himself day by day i think i'm getting i'm getting you might say wiser every day because part of it is oh i hope you guys don't mind this humor i'm getting more and more to the place i can just tell myself shut up and if i have to i'll slap myself and make myself shut up because you see by nature this great battle going on we declare things we don't want to declare prophet of god says don't say those words i'm weak i'm not i'm going to put it to this to you i hear this what i feel like is way too much and it comes out of my own mouth once in a while i'm not worthy god knows you're not worthy you don't have to remind him the truth of it is that's actually the devil's language that's the devil one of you because you're hearing yourself you're hearing yourself and you're believing yourself that i'm not worthy i'm telling you he said you're worthy so the wisdom that comes from having the mind of god amen is the fact that you have not received the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god has come to you there is wisdom my brother and sister to recognize who we are in the day that we're living in a world that is declining rapidly around us there's only one thing that's holding us only one thing only one thing god himself our lord jesus christ now the prophet of god you know he puts it he says you talk about the holy ghost you talk about jesus christ you talk about uh el shaddai you talk about it's all gone it's all gone my brother and sister don't get all confused on who's in you and what's in you god's come he's manifested himself he meets every need in every situation and you stand right there and you can say well well i don't know but let's go back to the dark ages amen sister ruth if you had come let's go to the dark ages who is with them that were sawn asunder who was with them that were burnt at the stake who was with them that was throwed into the colosseum with the angry hungry animals it's the same god hallelujah if i could dance i'd dance right now same god is living in you and i not another form not another dispensation not another time the same god amen oh hallelujah doesn't that make your hearts happy tonight amen you know i i i tried to do really well and and we're doing really well i'm going to call this i'm finished okay so you can clock that in right now amen but i'm telling you this is just scratching oh yeah this surface it is so beautiful oh my it would be just like lord i'd like to have the encyclopedias that go with that and it'd be like bam everything would be covered up because there's so much amen and that's not even a touch of christ in you oh hallelujah you can look you can read you can speak you can sing you can testify but look at the power of god in you amen darkest age saints that's what the word says most corrupt age that's what the word says amen it's the time the season everything coming together but as the scripture says i brought you out of darkness now let's just not go back to the fringes of darkness and look out there and say now i wonder what's happening out there hello we're in the light let's just look around in the light forget the darkness put the darkness behind you look around in the light because i tell you what every once in a while i click on that news stuff and it's just disheartening i mean they're just like we're going to destroy you the devil's on a rampage we're going to conquer everybody we're going to this we're going to do that and those of you that like to burn gasoline you know now they want to tax you for every mile you drive but to do that they're going to have to be able to tap into your phone and know everywhere you went and if they're inside your phone well forget that we might actually go back to a homeless society because i can see people just chunking them out the window we might go back saints to a more primitive life i don't know i don't know what it'll be and i don't really care because i'm not standing here looking into the darkness i'm looking into the light and the light said he's coming for me the light said if i'll just keep my life washed and under the blood in his presence he's coming for me and just like that little story of that little girl you know the the butcher that you know what my you didn't see her when they could
