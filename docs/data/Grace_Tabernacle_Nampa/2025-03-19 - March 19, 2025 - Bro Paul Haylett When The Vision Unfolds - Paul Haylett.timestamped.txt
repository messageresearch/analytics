[43:33] important it is because uh uh there is h
[43:37] a a vision that we must possess and if
[43:41] we don't possess that Vision then we
[43:43] will just have a form of godliness a
[43:45] religion but when we have that when that
[43:48] vision is very clear to us it becomes so
[43:52] personal that there's nothing on this
[43:54] Earth that can detour us from that and
[43:57] uh you know Satan I I I see this you
[44:00] know as we're coming to church it seems
[44:03] like that we're joining the ranks of
[44:04] other parts of the world there's two
[44:07] seasons summer construction and winter
[44:09] construction and uh I just you know
[44:11] struck me that uh we come and and we we
[44:15] are going along on the road of life and
[44:18] there's a detour sign and you know Satan
[44:22] would like it to just detour us right
[44:24] away from serving God but you know God
[44:26] says no problem I'll take you I'll be
[44:28] with you on the detour and we'll come
[44:30] around and and we'll go and I'll get you
[44:32] to where I called you to and uh so I've
[44:36] already read this scripture you may be
[44:37] seated amen
[44:40] hallelujah now as we look at this
[44:42] tonight we just want to realize that
[44:44] there is a vision for the age and um as
[44:48] it is it's coming there as we look in
[44:50] Revelations 3 it's very clear to us
[44:52] shows us very clearly what the spirits
[44:55] the nature and the vision is of the age
[44:58] and and as we look at that we come down
[45:00] to the the vision of the age and we'll
[45:03] recognize that there are certain
[45:05] attributes that must be fulfilled in
[45:07] this day now brother brandham said that
[45:09] God is actually waiting on us to
[45:11] manifest those so we look at that and
[45:14] realize that the outpouring of the holy
[45:16] spirit in this day is something that God
[45:19] is Not arm wrestling us into it but he's
[45:22] placing an Ever growing desire in our
[45:25] heart that we would long to see the word
[45:27] of God manifested and the Rapture my
[45:30] brother and sister is is not an escape
[45:33] for us it is not you know oh if we can
[45:35] just survive till the Rapture but the
[45:38] Rapture is actually the Fulfillment of a
[45:41] relationship and that relationship
[45:43] bringing us into a place that our body
[45:46] as it were our spirit yearns to be in
[45:48] the presence of God more than it desires
[45:51] to be in this earth or in our flesh and
[45:55] so we look at that and as a prophet's
[45:58] message has come down been revealed all
[46:01] through this scripture now do we realize
[46:03] the message to Le oysa started in
[46:05] Genesis 1 amen it's not something that
[46:08] was just uh late in the in in the God's
[46:11] manifesting of it but it's starts right
[46:13] back in the very beginning of the word
[46:15] and the word just is built and built and
[46:17] built and built until we come to a place
[46:20] that we as Sons and Daughters of God are
[46:22] are in a place that the word has has
[46:25] made a such a change in us and so as
[46:28] we'll look at this uh I I don't think
[46:30] I'm I'm going to you know try to explain
[46:34] every degree of this because we are are
[46:36] message Believers and we understand what
[46:39] God sent but we must come and realize
[46:42] that the vision for the age my brother
[46:44] and sister I is is uh to have one thing
[46:48] and we need that Vision if we don't have
[46:50] that Vision we're going to struggle to
[46:52] see what God is doing and uh we come
[46:55] down and and a church needs to have a
[46:57] vision if we have no vision as a church
[46:59] we we just stumble along and and uh have
[47:02] church Sundays and Wednesdays Sunday and
[47:05] Wednesday with no real uh Vision to move
[47:08] forward or what God would desire of us
[47:11] but tonight I want to actually touch uh
[47:14] more on what I would say is a personal
[47:16] vision and as we sit here tonight each
[47:19] one of us has a personal vision and it
[47:22] would be in the natural but we're
[47:24] focused on the spiritual and you know in
[47:27] the personal spiritual vision we we have
[47:31] to find ourself in the word of God we we
[47:34] can't sit back and just say I believe
[47:36] God sent a prophet I believe there's a
[47:38] message here but we have to find
[47:41] ourselves and and brother brandham you
[47:43] know taught us his his very simple words
[47:45] I remember as a little boy they struck
[47:47] me very profoundly now because of what
[47:50] my namesake is you know brother Brown
[47:52] says you need to find yourself in the
[47:54] Bible and I remember back there in my
[47:56] juvenile time let like well that's not
[47:58] too hard but you see it's not to find a
[48:01] name but it is to find ourself in this
[48:05] position of who we are expressed in the
[48:08] scripture not just to say well I'm in
[48:11] this book or that book but to find
[48:13] ourselves expressed in the scripture and
[48:16] then that becomes our personal Vision
[48:18] when we realize that uh God called
[48:21] before the foundation of the world those
[48:23] words are good and the fact that the
[48:25] Lord you know scripture says that he
[48:27] never lost a one that is wonderful but
[48:30] when you need to personalize yourself
[48:32] into those things so that when you stand
[48:35] there and realize the price that Christ
[48:38] paid for you and I the effort that he
[48:41] has made and how he is so lovingly
[48:44] patient now I don't know about you but
[48:46] I'm sure I burnt up seemingly my fair
[48:49] share of God's patience and yet it's
[48:51] inexhaustible it in it it's still here
[48:54] it's still being expressed I see it in
[48:56] the very simple things of my life God's
[48:59] patience for me and uh so in our
[49:02] personal Vision we must see how we fit
[49:05] in this economy we can say well
[49:07] predestination I believe I'm a Son of
[49:09] God I believe that he called me before
[49:11] the foundation of the world he's made
[49:12] this way before me but if you stop there
[49:16] you'll find yourself in a kind of a
[49:19] little bit of if I could use the phrase
[49:20] a little bit of a limbo because you see
[49:23] God didn't just call us here to to say I
[49:26] believe the message he called us here to
[49:29] do his work we are his hands his feet
[49:32] his H his lips his ears everything this
[49:35] is who we are so there's purpose for us
[49:38] not just to sit on a church pew pretty
[49:40] easy to sit on a church pew but it's
[49:42] pretty easy as uh we see it to backslide
[49:45] on the church pew and so what God's
[49:48] expecting for us is to really see where
[49:51] we fit and uh uh uh and how we fit and
[49:56] there's a lot fits that you can have in
[49:58] there because each one of us must be
[50:00] placed in a certain particular place you
[50:02] say well I feel like my calling is to
[50:04] sit here on the Pew I'm not called to an
[50:07] office maybe I'm a sister this is just
[50:09] what I'm called to but you see there's
[50:11] much more than that because even as we
[50:13] sit here tonight we are here and there's
[50:16] not a lot of loud Hallelujah and amens
[50:19] right you guys heard me say that right
[50:21] amen but you see that really doesn't
[50:24] matter that's not what God's looking for
[50:26] God's looking for the heart that is
[50:29] saying amen so if it never really
[50:31] touches our lips I've been in Services
[50:33] where they're like well you must not
[50:35] believe it very much you're not amening
[50:36] it but really that's not true because we
[50:40] can be sitting at certain stages in our
[50:42] life under certain circumstances and and
[50:45] in our heart we're rejoicing or maybe
[50:47] being chastised or whatever it might be
[50:50] but in our heart because we are Sons and
[50:52] Daughters of God we're actually
[50:54] rejoicing that the word is coming and
[50:56] touching our life whether it's just
[50:58] completely a blessing or whether there's
[51:00] correction involved and our heart is
[51:02] rejoicing because we are Sons and
[51:05] Daughters of God and so the word comes
[51:07] and it brings us to a place and when we
[51:10] see how we fit into the economy of God
[51:13] then we will tend to see in a greater
[51:16] revelation of where we fit and so as it
[51:19] comes my brother and sister not everyone
[51:22] is going to be the preacher and uh and
[51:25] that that well I'll just keep that
[51:27] thought to myself um but anyway uh you
[51:30] know it it's not I'll just say it it's
[51:32] not as glorious as people think it
[51:34] is and so as it is you look at this and
[51:38] you say well you know what if I'm just
[51:41] the one who comes and turns on the
[51:43] lights you see you're part of God's
[51:45] economy performing God's word cuz
[51:47] someone needs to turn on the lights and
[51:50] so you know we look at the great
[51:52] spiritual view of it we realize that
[51:55] there has to be this body complete right
[51:58] and uh you're here again uh we were
[52:00] visiting about brother Steve Bron I just
[52:03] reminded many years ago he was preaching
[52:05] at a church and he just made a statement
[52:07] I'm not going to quote quotes because if
[52:10] you're in the message like you should be
[52:12] you'll know I'm preaching it so you look
[52:14] at this and realize that that the
[52:17] foundation has been laid it's not just
[52:18] simply we believe God sent a prophet and
[52:21] uh praise God we're going to go into
[52:22] Rapture my brother and sister we must be
[52:25] positionally placed
[52:27] and as it is all through Israel all
[52:29] through the ages of Old Testament we see
[52:33] constantly a placing and they're being
[52:35] put into these positions we come in the
[52:37] New Testament the world stumbled over
[52:40] that because they're thinking that that
[52:42] means the Covenant of Grace allows us to
[52:44] place ourselves but that's not what God
[52:47] did he still is positionally placing
[52:50] Sons and Daughters of God now in The
[52:52] Invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[52:55] uh brother Brown says th this the word
[52:57] that fell on the day of Pentecost will
[52:59] not work this day now sometimes if you
[53:03] don't use a quote right here and not
[53:06] able to put it in context people will
[53:08] think that you're kind of saying wait
[53:10] that that won't work for our day you
[53:12] know what are you saying but you see the
[53:14] prophet's making a point here the word
[53:16] that fell on the day of Pentecost will
[53:18] not work this day so let's not sit here
[53:21] and long to go back to the day of
[53:24] Pentecost because of Prophet is here
[53:27] telling us that's not going to
[53:32] work no sir that was for Pentecost this
[53:35] is for the bride the going home of the
[53:38] Bride we got something different now
[53:42] this has been posed to me as a question
[53:44] you before do you think we have more
[53:48] than they
[53:50] did you got to be careful about
[53:52] answering questions like that because
[53:54] people take them out of context
[53:57] and think that we think we're
[54:00] greater we're not greater but the word
[54:03] is because the word is sufficient for
[54:06] the day and so we are in a more wicked
[54:10] age so the word is more effective in our
[54:14] day and so this is for the bride going
[54:17] home of the Bride we got something
[54:19] different the Pentecostals represented
[54:21] that again we're in the bride age amen
[54:26] see and we don't want to go to seed on
[54:28] this but my brother and sister we got to
[54:30] recognize that God knew exactly what it
[54:32] would take for you and I to go home and
[54:35] he's come down and uh anointed a prophet
[54:38] to speak the words to take it that we're
[54:41] not just here uh trying to survive I
[54:43] hear this sometimes out of the mouth of
[54:46] individuals and we can just get through
[54:47] leysia I'm here to tell you tonight
[54:50] we've already got through leoda we are
[54:52] not waiting to get through the spirit
[54:54] and Conquer leoda God is already put his
[54:57] word in the heart of the Bride she's
[54:59] already passed through leod deia she's
[55:01] now in the bride age my brother and
[55:04] sister no no wife or or no sister would
[55:08] would put on a white dress and all of
[55:10] that and come and stand here in front of
[55:13] the congregation on a Sunday morning
[55:16] hoping a bridegroom would show
[55:19] up she's there in that position because
[55:22] it's been revealed to her it's been uh
[55:25] spoken and it's been committed and she's
[55:29] here as a bride knowing the bridegroom
[55:32] is Desiring her and has that uh
[55:36] commitment already been made and so the
[55:39] Bride of this age is not here trying to
[55:41] conquer leoda not trying to overcome
[55:44] leoda we have a bridegroom that said
[55:47] come away my love amen and we've already
[55:49] moved beyond the leoda even though we're
[55:52] still influenced by the spirits of it
[55:54] but part of that's our own fault
[55:56] because we have left many promises of
[55:59] God laying there because we say well I'm
[56:01] not worthy how many of us have said that
[56:03] before I'm not worthy if God said you're
[56:06] worthy take a hold of the promise grip
[56:09] that and take that and hold on to that
[56:11] and use that to be an overcomer amen so
[56:15] uh we're in the bride age no more than
[56:17] the word of Noah would work in the days
[56:19] of Moses no more than Moses law would
[56:22] have worked in the time of Paul here he
[56:24] tried to tell them you're dead to that
[56:26] and you cannot have that now this is a a
[56:29] beautiful uh sermon and there's much
[56:32] more but you know you can't just come
[56:34] here and we might as well play the tape
[56:36] if we're going to just read quote after
[56:37] quote on it but you look at this see my
[56:39] brother and sister I'm going to make
[56:41] what might seem like a little bit of a
[56:43] radical
[56:45] approach we need to be dead to the Past
[56:49] amen We're Not Looking Back to Egypt as
[56:52] as Israel did at the Red Sea we have
[56:55] many challenges and sometimes we have
[56:57] many
[56:58] failures and we come up short but it's
[57:01] time my brother and sister you know I
[57:05] know why sister Jerry's chuckling we had
[57:07] Grace kids the other night at the house
[57:09] and we took a couple blue blankets and
[57:12] we uh our sheets and we created our own
[57:14] Red Sea and The Parting of it and it was
[57:17] kind of interesting because the kids
[57:19] were stumbling over the sheet and anyway
[57:22] generally it was just a fun time with
[57:24] the little kids but you look at my
[57:26] brother and sister we can't be like them
[57:28] and look back we're sold out and if
[57:31] we're not sold
[57:32] out well serious troubles
[57:36] ahead imagine what it would be if they
[57:38] could have stood there on that day and
[57:41] said you know what what you should do is
[57:43] probably just go hold up a white sheet
[57:45] and go back to uh um the Pharaoh
[57:48] soldiers and tell them I want to go back
[57:51] but you see I hope you follow me even
[57:54] then for them at that time if God had
[57:56] allowed him to do that it was too late
[57:59] those Egyptian Army was there to kill
[58:03] them that's right
[58:05] right you wonder why people and I'm not
[58:09] like oh raw raw the message don't
[58:11] misunderstand me but you wonder why
[58:14] people when they depart their lives turn
[58:17] into shambles because the Pharaoh's Army
[58:21] is not there to let him return back to
[58:23] making bricks he's there to kill them
[58:27] and we see it happen again and again and
[58:31] again but no one intended for it to be
[58:33] that way amen so we need to just face
[58:37] the fact that when God called us I'm not
[58:39] talking about a man calling you emotion
[58:41] calling you or some movement calling you
[58:44] I'm talking about God calling you we
[58:45] need to become dead to everything else
[58:48] we need to just move beyond that and be
[58:51] dead to that and uh because God's going
[58:53] to say you can't have that you don't you
[58:55] don't have that
[58:56] amen now the word tells us in this day
[59:00] now this is the bride age right we're in
[59:02] this time the scripture tells us that
[59:04] the Mysteries and I've got it here in my
[59:07] notes the word would slash should so you
[59:11] see when you take that in the right
[59:13] definition and it said should be
[59:15] finished it is actually declaring it
[59:18] would be finished it will be done it's
[59:20] not a possibility uh a possibility of
[59:24] not but it is fully done so the
[59:26] Mysteries should be fulfilled and you
[59:29] know uh there is a lot I I don't know
[59:31] about you let me only speak for myself
[59:33] there's a lot in scripture I still don't
[59:35] understand I I look in the scripture and
[59:38] God by his grace and mercy I think
[59:40] you'll agree with me there's things that
[59:42] we we don't understand and then a period
[59:44] of time goes by and suddenly amen thank
[59:48] you Lord there it is it's before us now
[59:51] did we figure it out oh my brother and
[59:54] sister if we spend all of our life life
[59:56] the rest of our lives trying to figure
[59:58] it out we can't figure it out but God
[1:00:01] says I will put every piece of the
[1:00:04] mystery in its correct position in its
[1:00:08] correct time and that's very important
[1:00:11] amen so we're looking at the details
[1:00:14] following falling in place now you know
[1:00:18] I read a quote to you maybe that was
[1:00:20] last Wednesday where brother Braham says
[1:00:22] you know uh that God had pulled back
[1:00:24] from that because the people have been
[1:00:26] saying oh he's going to come here and
[1:00:27] he's going to come like this and it's
[1:00:29] going to be this and it's going to be
[1:00:30] that we don't want to be those kind of
[1:00:31] people but I'll tell you if if you just
[1:00:34] give me a little pass for lack of good
[1:00:36] wording sometimes you feel that way
[1:00:39] because you see these things these world
[1:00:41] events coming to place they're coming to
[1:00:44] Bear they're coming to fulfillment
[1:00:46] fruition and and we don't really you
[1:00:49] know know I mean the pope he's he's got
[1:00:52] one foot on a oh I shouldn't make humor
[1:00:54] like that I don't know which way to
[1:00:56] express that he's got one foot in the
[1:00:58] grave and one foot on you guys know the
[1:01:00] rest of that yeah
[1:01:03] so is he the last
[1:01:06] Pope supposedly there's only one spot
[1:01:12] left so maybe the last Pope doesn't need
[1:01:15] a place to be buried in the
[1:01:18] Basilica oh we
[1:01:23] could we were joking the other night
[1:01:25] like well conspiracy we're not
[1:01:27] conspiracy theorists
[1:01:29] but but you see my brother and sister I
[1:01:32] want to ask you does it really matter
[1:01:35] the Pope's
[1:01:36] condition what really matters is our
[1:01:40] Condition it's not where he's at it's
[1:01:43] where we're at and so as we get focused
[1:01:47] on some of those things we can make
[1:01:49] assumptions but those assumptions can be
[1:01:52] misguided misplaced so as we look at
[1:01:56] this and and the prophet of God uh had
[1:01:59] many Visions my brother and sister and
[1:02:01] there were times that he himself was
[1:02:04] uncertain of what the vision actually
[1:02:07] meant and he had to wait for the Lord to
[1:02:10] interpret those visions and you know
[1:02:12] here we are in this life right now here
[1:02:15] tonight we misinterpret God's vision for
[1:02:19] our life and we will end up with a
[1:02:22] entirely different result we have to
[1:02:24] wait just like the Prophet did and let
[1:02:27] the Lord interpret the vision amen cuz
[1:02:31] if we let the Lord interpret the vision
[1:02:34] all responsibility of that Vision falls
[1:02:37] back Upon Our God but when we
[1:02:41] misinterpret the vision uh you know
[1:02:44] there's been a lot I'm not here to go
[1:02:45] into those tonight but people say well
[1:02:48] the Lord told me and my brother and
[1:02:51] sister sometimes it's just totally
[1:02:52] against the word of God but they're
[1:02:54] saying God told me God told me to go
[1:02:56] against the word and so you know my
[1:02:59] brother and sister you know here again
[1:03:01] just to to clinch that nail the prophet
[1:03:04] of God said God will never lead you away
[1:03:07] from his word right so you look at that
[1:03:10] you wonder sometimes so someone's maybe
[1:03:12] misinterpreting the vision and they're
[1:03:14] going to end up with a different results
[1:03:17] now on The Superficial level missing
[1:03:20] something you know I never even shared
[1:03:23] it with my wife but I had a dream here a
[1:03:24] while back and I for sure hope that
[1:03:26] dream doesn't come to pass cuz I was
[1:03:29] hanging on the edge of something and
[1:03:31] something fell over and smashed both of
[1:03:32] my
[1:03:33] hands and the dream ended right there
[1:03:37] now did that smashing of my hands give
[1:03:39] me Supernatural strength to crawl back
[1:03:40] up on top or was it symbolism that I was
[1:03:44] fixing to get my hands
[1:03:48] smashed but you see when you eat too
[1:03:51] much rich food too late at
[1:03:53] night and then you're going to guide
[1:03:55] Your Life by One Singular
[1:03:59] event see it doesn't even make sense
[1:04:01] when we make light of it that way it
[1:04:03] doesn't even make sense but people find
[1:04:05] themselves caught but what do you do you
[1:04:07] have a dream that's kind of crazy but
[1:04:09] there's something about it you don't
[1:04:11] know what you do is you take that thing
[1:04:13] and the prophet of God told us you take
[1:04:15] it back to the word and then let God
[1:04:17] interpret it amen otherwise it could
[1:04:20] just be a crazy dream amen so it's there
[1:04:23] you look at this and a superficial IAL
[1:04:26] level it doesn't matter but in a deeper
[1:04:27] spiritual level we need to have an
[1:04:31] understanding of the vision that God has
[1:04:33] placed in you and I as it unfolds and
[1:04:36] when is unfolding according to the word
[1:04:39] you will find yourself more spiritually
[1:04:41] stable you'll find yourself with a a
[1:04:44] greater Victory you'll find there's so
[1:04:46] many things I could put in here but I I
[1:04:48] don't want to just belabor that but
[1:04:49] you're going to find that these things
[1:04:51] when God deals with you and it is the
[1:04:54] Lord every is coming back and it has an
[1:04:58] anchor point and when it has an anchor
[1:05:00] Point you're actually even if it's
[1:05:02] incorrection going to be blessed by that
[1:05:05] when the vision goes off and becomes as
[1:05:07] it were heresy uh uh you know it it it
[1:05:11] starts to do and and you know things
[1:05:13] just can get difficult you look at it
[1:05:15] and say why why is this brother or
[1:05:17] sister doing this but you'll see that
[1:05:20] often times they're not actually waiting
[1:05:22] for God to open the vision to them
[1:05:25] they're taking what they understand at
[1:05:28] the moment going forward with that
[1:05:31] assuming that God's going to unfold it
[1:05:34] all after they're already in motion but
[1:05:38] God wants you to take it back to the
[1:05:40] word and if God says go do this then the
[1:05:44] Lord will make a way for that amen now
[1:05:50] you know we're living in today the
[1:05:52] Mysteries are supposed to be fulfilled I
[1:05:53] want to know as the third pull been
[1:05:56] fulfilled any of you ever have a third
[1:05:58] Pole Experience yeah I think this church
[1:06:01] ought to shout with an amen amen because
[1:06:04] that's that's the word coming to pass in
[1:06:06] your presence and mystery amen uh being
[1:06:09] fulfilled you know is coming to a fuller
[1:06:12] understanding of Christ in you amen my
[1:06:15] brother and sister Christ in you the
[1:06:17] hope of glory is a much greater mystery
[1:06:20] than we think because God has been so
[1:06:22] gracious to us to open the word and we
[1:06:26] see it because we're already can I use
[1:06:28] the word
[1:06:30] pre-programmed to
[1:06:32] believe let's go down the street this is
[1:06:35] church Row in NAA right here let's go
[1:06:38] down the street let's walk into some of
[1:06:40] these churches and start talking to them
[1:06:43] about the third
[1:06:44] pole they will tell you you're
[1:06:47] crazy but what has the third poll done
[1:06:49] for you and I it's brought us into
[1:06:52] greater
[1:06:54] Revelation amen
[1:06:57] now think about it mystery being
[1:07:00] fulfilled how many times we say here
[1:07:02] that we are the
[1:07:04] word you realize how deep that is yes
[1:07:06] sir we're not just men and women
[1:07:09] following saying well we're Christians
[1:07:11] were following the Lord Jesus Christ you
[1:07:14] see this has taken this a way deeper
[1:07:17] step and brought us into a place that we
[1:07:20] have come to recognize that we actually
[1:07:24] are the word made manifest in this day
[1:07:28] and I tell you my brother and sister
[1:07:29] it's not to go negative here but if this
[1:07:33] message is not correct it it is not the
[1:07:37] the the God's movement of this day then
[1:07:40] please I beg you take me to it that's
[1:07:43] right
[1:07:45] absolutely the critics would say this is
[1:07:47] this is this and this is this I I can't
[1:07:50] find anywhere where the word or the
[1:07:54] prophet said follow
[1:07:56] me meaning William Bram in fact he
[1:07:59] specifically
[1:08:00] says I don't want you to follow me
[1:08:02] that's right so we look at this and when
[1:08:05] we realize that if this is not the truth
[1:08:08] then Lord this is my prayer constantly
[1:08:11] Lord lead me and guide me to all truth
[1:08:13] and I believe he'll do that so if
[1:08:15] there's greater truth out here somewhere
[1:08:18] my brother and sister I believe God is
[1:08:20] obligated if I could put it that way
[1:08:21] Lord please forgive me if I worded it
[1:08:23] wrong but I he obligated himself to take
[1:08:27] us to the truth which means that if this
[1:08:30] is not it he would be taking us
[1:08:33] somewhere else but my brother and sister
[1:08:35] all of these prophets and all of these
[1:08:37] movements and all of these great men are
[1:08:40] constantly coming to
[1:08:43] not because there's nothing that's going
[1:08:46] to
[1:08:52] suplantar the word amen yeah we don't
[1:08:56] think about it as being a great mystery
[1:08:58] sometimes it's like well okay yes praise
[1:09:00] God we're the word but do you realize my
[1:09:02] brother and sister just like to say
[1:09:04] Jesus is the Christ you must have the
[1:09:06] Holy Ghost to honestly say that he is
[1:09:09] the Christ and it comes to a place that
[1:09:12] to be able to recognize that we are the
[1:09:14] word we have to have the Holy Ghost and
[1:09:18] when you have the Holy Ghost you start
[1:09:20] to recognize that this is not about big
[1:09:22] buildings this is not about all this
[1:09:24] other stuff this is about our
[1:09:26] relationship with Jesus Christ so I want
[1:09:28] to ask you is this reality or symbolism
[1:09:31] reality it's
[1:09:33] reality amen I've been told that it's
[1:09:36] symbolism not that long ago I had
[1:09:38] somebody tell me I believe that this and
[1:09:40] this and this is is symbolism and I told
[1:09:43] them you just keep on looking for the
[1:09:45] symbols I'm looking for Christ amen the
[1:09:48] reality the truth the word and the bride
[1:09:54] is the reality amen now that's a
[1:09:56] statement I'm going to make like that
[1:09:58] that might be misunderstood people can
[1:10:00] put the spin on it but the bride of
[1:10:02] Christ is the reality of the revealed
[1:10:04] word in this hour amen God doesn't need
[1:10:08] something to confirm he is God they
[1:10:11] people who believe he is God believe he
[1:10:12] is God and those who don't want to
[1:10:14] believe he is God don't believe he is
[1:10:16] God it won't change whether he's God or
[1:10:18] not so what God come down he says I'm
[1:10:21] going to express myself in my bride and
[1:10:25] here again you want to make a connection
[1:10:27] real quick the prophet of God says you
[1:10:29] want to know what kind of man a person
[1:10:31] is look at his wife you want to know
[1:10:32] what kind of church it is look at the
[1:10:34] sisters
[1:10:36] amen right that's right
[1:10:40] right Lord help us too
[1:10:44] simple no not too simple pretty
[1:10:47] straightforward actually now in the
[1:10:49] seven Church age Philadelphian Church
[1:10:51] age brother brandham says here uh but
[1:10:54] let me say this our Lord is not defeated
[1:10:58] men claim to open the door to God and
[1:11:00] shut that door but they are liars you
[1:11:03] know we even have a few of those around
[1:11:04] the message yes sir H I'm here tonight
[1:11:07] to preach this Revelation to you I'm
[1:11:10] sorry God gives a revelation no man's
[1:11:12] going to teach the revelation of Jesus
[1:11:14] Christ to you amen all that the father
[1:11:18] has given him will come to him and he
[1:11:20] that cometh to him in no wise will be
[1:11:23] cast out this should make us heart our
[1:11:25] hearts Rejoice he will lose none of them
[1:11:29] John 6:
[1:11:30] 37-39 and when that last elected member
[1:11:34] uh to the body of Christ comes in then
[1:11:36] will our Lord appear the Key of David
[1:11:39] was not David the king of Israel all
[1:11:42] Israel and is not Jesus the son of David
[1:11:44] according to the fact that he still uh
[1:11:48] will sit upon the throne of David in the
[1:11:50] Millennium and Reign and rule over his
[1:11:52] Heritage surely so the Key of David S
[1:11:55] signifies that it is Jesus who will
[1:11:57] bring in the Millennium amen now most of
[1:12:01] you would not really be familiar with
[1:12:03] this but and and you know a last uh uh
[1:12:06] bit of History you know there's been Men
[1:12:09] passed right through this part of the
[1:12:10] world that said that they were given the
[1:12:12] authority sister Jerry and I just a
[1:12:16] second
[1:12:19] here we're given personal invitation
[1:12:25] to the
[1:12:28] Millennium and I told them well I'm
[1:12:32] sorry but I already have an invitation
[1:12:34] to the Millennium I don't need your
[1:12:38] invitation because I've got an
[1:12:40] invitation of the one who actually is
[1:12:44] authorized to give the
[1:12:46] invitation but you see how men can come
[1:12:48] to this positions where they they feel
[1:12:52] like they are so divinely appointed to
[1:12:54] declare who will be and who won't be but
[1:12:58] look at what the prophet's saying here
[1:13:01] now uh that that this is this position
[1:13:05] and uh uh kind of the going back but
[1:13:08] it's all right uh he who has the keys to
[1:13:11] death and hell will raise up his own
[1:13:13] that they may share in his reign of
[1:13:16] righteousness upon the Earth how
[1:13:18] wonderful that our Lord has all the
[1:13:20] answers truly in him are all the
[1:13:23] promises of God fulfilled truly by being
[1:13:26] in him we are HS to what he has
[1:13:30] purchased for us yes there he stands the
[1:13:33] Lord Of Glory once as a father he was
[1:13:36] surrounded by Angels the archangels
[1:13:38] cherim seraphim the whole host of Heaven
[1:13:41] crying holy holy holy is the Lord God of
[1:13:44] hosts such was his Holiness that no man
[1:13:47] could approach unto
[1:13:50] him but now we see him I want you to see
[1:13:54] that sometimes times I feel like not me
[1:13:57] but I it just seems like we're kind of
[1:14:00] missing a little something cuz here's a
[1:14:02] holy God that all of the archangels
[1:14:07] seraphim every one of them holy holy
[1:14:10] holy and then God says I am going to do
[1:14:13] something a little different I'm going
[1:14:15] to come down in my
[1:14:18] church now if we left all that
[1:14:21] explanation off and I ask you where is
[1:14:23] the Church of the Living God
[1:14:26] we wouldn't need to go pointing off
[1:14:28] somewhere to the east to the west to the
[1:14:30] North or the South we wouldn't need to
[1:14:32] travel to Israel we wouldn't need to to
[1:14:34] travel to some place that maybe might be
[1:14:36] a message
[1:14:38] Mecca we would recognize because we are
[1:14:41] students of the Bible that we are the
[1:14:45] Tabernacle we are the kingdom we are the
[1:14:48] dwelling place and so look at this right
[1:14:51] here amen we see that this is
[1:14:55] uh such a position that they were there
[1:14:58] and no could no one could approach God
[1:15:01] uh without being there approach him
[1:15:04] properly but he says but now we see him
[1:15:06] in the church sharing his own Holiness
[1:15:11] with us my this this is a greatest gift
[1:15:15] a greatest favor that mankind could ever
[1:15:18] have that God would come and and pardon
[1:15:20] me for using such a simple thing but he
[1:15:22] would come and say here I want to share
[1:15:25] my Holiness with you oh my brother and
[1:15:29] sister that is no small thing people are
[1:15:31] saying where's the supernatural things
[1:15:33] of God I would say that God would choose
[1:15:36] to share his Holiness with you and I is
[1:15:39] a supernatural thing amen it's not some
[1:15:42] trivial thing to be glossed over
[1:15:47] amen sharing his own Holiness with us
[1:15:50] until in him we have become the very
[1:15:54] righteous
[1:15:55] of God see how privileged our position
[1:15:58] is it is not a menial thing oh my family
[1:16:02] just believes the message or you know my
[1:16:05] husband or my wife or my parents my
[1:16:08] brother and sister this is an incredible
[1:16:10] thing God has given to us no gift of
[1:16:14] value of intrinsic value on the earth
[1:16:16] could equal the gift God has given us
[1:16:19] that he has given us his Holiness and
[1:16:21] his
[1:16:22] righteousness amen yes
[1:16:25] and there he stands Jesus perfect
[1:16:30] everything lily of the valley perfect
[1:16:33] bright and Morning Star perfect the
[1:16:34] fairest of 10,000 Alpha and Omega root
[1:16:37] and offspring of David father son Holy
[1:16:40] Ghost the all in all Isaiah 9:6 For unto
[1:16:43] us a child is born unto us a son is
[1:16:46] given and the government shall be upon
[1:16:48] his shoulder and his name Shall be
[1:16:49] Called wonderful counselor Mighty God
[1:16:52] Everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[1:16:55] do we realize my brothers and sisters
[1:16:57] this is not a Doctrine to be argued over
[1:17:01] this is a gift a revelation of Jesus
[1:17:04] Christ personally granted and given to
[1:17:06] you and I oh my you know brother Bram
[1:17:10] uses that example of of the President
[1:17:13] coming to your
[1:17:14] house my brother and
[1:17:16] sister we have pardon the pun Trump
[1:17:20] that we've got the King of Kings the
[1:17:23] perfect one has come to our house amen
[1:17:27] and the prophet goes on when he's giving
[1:17:29] that story he's talking about how that
[1:17:31] that we would invite him in and we would
[1:17:35] give him the very best that we have
[1:17:38] should we not invite him in and give him
[1:17:41] the very best that we have amen
[1:17:45] hallelujah now we just hurry along here
[1:17:47] tonight in him is perfect
[1:17:50] fulfillment though once we esteemed him
[1:17:53] not now we love him with joy unspeakable
[1:17:57] and full of Glory in the midst of the
[1:17:59] church he stands and we will sing his
[1:18:02] praise for he is the mighty conqueror is
[1:18:05] head over the church which is his bride
[1:18:09] amen we by Grace already know that but
[1:18:12] it just to me never ceases to be so
[1:18:15] incredible that he would come and say
[1:18:18] I'm going to pour everything that I am
[1:18:21] into my church amen
[1:18:29] are we acting on everything he's giving
[1:18:32] us are we accepting it that's it now I'm
[1:18:37] not even going to use sin as a reason
[1:18:39] that it's not
[1:18:41] working unless you would call it our
[1:18:44] refusal to
[1:18:46] acknowledge God's view of
[1:18:50] us he says you are perfect that I can
[1:18:55] pour myself the most
[1:18:59] holy into
[1:19:01] you that's how we should be looking at
[1:19:03] this picture not we constantly trying to
[1:19:07] be good
[1:19:08] enough he's already declared you good
[1:19:11] enough right it's time for us to stand
[1:19:14] up and say you know what Lord I accept
[1:19:16] everything you said about me amen we
[1:19:20] could go lovely analogy of a man
[1:19:22] courting a young woman and uh in this
[1:19:25] little story the young woman uh is not
[1:19:28] necessarily the prettiest girl around
[1:19:31] but when this young man fell in love
[1:19:33] with her he said you are the most
[1:19:36] beautiful girl to me and then it goes on
[1:19:39] to explain how the girl being
[1:19:42] intelligent looked around and said
[1:19:43] there's so many more that are much more
[1:19:47] beautiful than I
[1:19:50] am but do you see she was judging his
[1:19:54] word words by her perspective right
[1:19:59] right he was judging her by his heart
[1:20:03] that's
[1:20:04] right and we have to
[1:20:07] accept our Lord Jesus Christ view of us
[1:20:11] that's it amen otherwise we'll come up
[1:20:14] the conclusion that we're not good
[1:20:16] enough y that's right we can't do this
[1:20:20] he's not asking us to judge ourselves by
[1:20:23] humanistic Behavior
[1:20:25] he's asking us to judge oursel by what
[1:20:29] he himself has
[1:20:31] declared and he has as we've shared
[1:20:34] tonight that we are righteous and we Are
[1:20:37] Holy amen amen let that be our New
[1:20:41] Perspective let that be how we judge the
[1:20:44] the trajectory of our Christian walk
[1:20:48] amen
[1:20:58] sorry I hear just a little bit dry
[1:21:11] throat somebody helped me I lost my
[1:21:13] place
[1:21:19] [Music]
[1:21:29] I find this
[1:21:32] humorous in the midst of the church he
[1:21:34] stands we sing his praise for his mighty
[1:21:36] conqueror's head over the church which
[1:21:38] is his bride he bought that bride some
[1:21:43] people would consider that an insult my
[1:21:46] brother and sister that just means that
[1:21:48] he chose you out of the millions of
[1:21:51] people on the Earth he chose you
[1:21:56] you to me that's so
[1:22:00] incredible so
[1:22:03] incredible he is our
[1:22:06] King and I stopped this quote right here
[1:22:08] out of the Philadelphian Church age
[1:22:10] right here because this is really the
[1:22:12] point I want to
[1:22:13] make he is our King can we say Amen to
[1:22:17] that and we are his kingdom amen wow if
[1:22:23] we are his King Kingdom my brother and
[1:22:25] sister we're not just a bunch of
[1:22:28] miserable people in this age trying to
[1:22:32] struggle to serve God faithfully and
[1:22:34] hoping we can make I hope I can make a
[1:22:37] Rapture you are his
[1:22:40] kingdom and a king occupies his kingdom
[1:22:44] he possesses it it's his authority over
[1:22:48] it it's his leadership it's his guidance
[1:22:51] and it's it's his fruits that he takes
[1:22:55] from his own kingdom oh we ought to
[1:22:58] realize as this vision is unfolding
[1:23:00] before us nothing new tonight I don't
[1:23:03] have anything spectacular I'm here to
[1:23:05] remind you you are his kingdom amen and
[1:23:09] he's not going to abandon his kingdom
[1:23:11] for something else he's not going to run
[1:23:13] off and leave his kingdom you are the
[1:23:16] very purpose amen of the Rapture
[1:23:21] amen hallelujah
[1:23:26] I hope you can catch what I'm saying
[1:23:28] here in this little
[1:23:30] statement the vision is truly unfolded
[1:23:34] when we see no separation between
[1:23:37] ourselves and Jesus
[1:23:39] Christ if we still see separation
[1:23:42] between us and Jesus Christ the vision
[1:23:45] is not fully revealed to you that's
[1:23:47] right he come to make his bride he to
[1:23:51] make the church his bride and his bride
[1:23:54] is one with him let's be reminded of
[1:23:58] that on the good days Amen on the bad
[1:24:01] days we need to be reminded that we are
[1:24:04] one with Jesus Christ you say I've got
[1:24:06] problems he accounted for your problem
[1:24:10] amen he already made allowance for our
[1:24:14] flesh and our weakness and our Frailty
[1:24:17] and as one brother says our
[1:24:19] stupidity he's already accounted for
[1:24:22] that amen
[1:24:26] now I need to hurry along
[1:24:29] here God identifying himself by his
[1:24:33] characteristics brother Bram says this
[1:24:35] Jesus said in the 17th chapter of St
[1:24:37] Luke as it was in the days of Sodom so
[1:24:40] shall it be at the coming of the son of
[1:24:41] man when the son of man is being
[1:24:43] revealed when
[1:24:46] Revelation is unfolding itself in the
[1:24:50] days when the world will be like
[1:24:52] Sodom what will it
[1:24:56] be
[1:24:58] so Revelation unfolding itself what will
[1:25:01] that Revelation look like what will we
[1:25:04] see when that Revelation is unfolded in
[1:25:07] the day that it looks like Sodom
[1:25:09] wouldn't that be today yes it is y this
[1:25:13] is the season this is the time this is
[1:25:16] the time that Sodom has truly started to
[1:25:20] express itself
[1:25:25] the characteristic of that scripture
[1:25:27] being fulfilled God is God identifying
[1:25:30] himself by his characteristic
[1:25:33] characteristic that he's always been he
[1:25:35] cannot leave that amen here again a
[1:25:37] little homework go read some more of
[1:25:39] that get the full context of it but you
[1:25:42] see my brother and sister when God said
[1:25:45] that this is how I'm going to reveal
[1:25:47] myself we've come down to this Sodom age
[1:25:50] he didn't suddenly decide he's got a new
[1:25:52] program
[1:25:54] you know we don't need the equivalent
[1:25:56] sorry to even use the words but we don't
[1:25:57] need Dei in the church we don't need to
[1:26:01] come some kind of diverse deal that we
[1:26:03] need to attract these people if the
[1:26:05] gospel itself in its purest form will
[1:26:07] not attract them nothing will attract
[1:26:09] them to Christ himself and so we don't
[1:26:12] need a program to attract them what we
[1:26:14] need is the Worden let the word attract
[1:26:18] them cuz when the word wins them they
[1:26:21] are
[1:26:22] one but if we just convince them they'll
[1:26:25] soon be convinced
[1:26:26] differently so we're seeing the vision
[1:26:30] has there ever been a day I I've said
[1:26:31] this to the church to you guys before
[1:26:34] that years ago I've thought man we are
[1:26:37] in the time look at this everything
[1:26:39] looks like Sodom didn't have a
[1:26:41] clue did not have a
[1:26:44] clue and I'm going to say it again it
[1:26:47] sure looks like
[1:26:48] Sodom but here again I might not have a
[1:26:52] clue but what I do know that I can
[1:26:55] certify to you is that we're a lot
[1:26:57] closer to that Sodom Spirit than we were
[1:27:00] 10 years ago right five years ago yeah
[1:27:04] wait maybe even a year or two that's
[1:27:07] exactly right see it's manifesting
[1:27:13] itself now pardon me to put the words
[1:27:15] this way but we thought Sodom was maybe
[1:27:17] back in that day just a a few people
[1:27:20] kind of Floy and a few whatever my
[1:27:22] brother and sister it was de Ary that's
[1:27:25] right it was absolute filth that's right
[1:27:27] and we are headed back as a
[1:27:31] society there's some side streets here
[1:27:34] but we'll we'll leave them so it's
[1:27:37] coming my brother and sister brother
[1:27:39] Brown says here in questions answers on
[1:27:40] Genesis
[1:27:42] 1953 uh we don't have a quote I don't
[1:27:45] believe I put that on that list god
[1:27:48] making Eve and Adam and Eve at the same
[1:27:50] time the only thing he made was the
[1:27:53] supernatural
[1:27:57] the spirit of Adam and the spirit of Eve
[1:27:59] the man and woman then when he made put
[1:28:01] Adam in here it wasn't good for see it's
[1:28:05] God's picture unfolding all the time
[1:28:09] amen and I'm glad of that because I tell
[1:28:12] you if some of the things in our life
[1:28:14] had been flashed before us years ago we
[1:28:18] would have been so stunned we could not
[1:28:20] have continued we would have just
[1:28:22] faltered under but you see God's
[1:28:25] unfolding and every time Satan raises
[1:28:28] his
[1:28:29] standard God raises his standard and
[1:28:32] God's standard has always been higher
[1:28:35] than Satan's standard we don't have to
[1:28:37] worry about being overflowed overrun
[1:28:40] overdone right we can just stand and let
[1:28:43] God do what he does and Satan will do
[1:28:46] what he does but the Lord's already
[1:28:48] given us the answer showed us the
[1:28:50] victory is already ours amen we don't
[1:28:54] have to hope for victory we're not
[1:28:56] praying for victory we have Victory amen
[1:29:01] see it's God's picture unfolding all the
[1:29:03] time everything like this it's just
[1:29:05] coming right down just unfolding right
[1:29:07] out coming out through the Millennium
[1:29:08] Over Yonder right into eternity god's
[1:29:11] picture just unfolding God unfolding
[1:29:16] himself we're not sitting here tonight I
[1:29:19] know brother and sisters sometimes good
[1:29:20] days bad days I certainly confess I have
[1:29:24] my own but my brother and sister we
[1:29:26] really need to come to the place we
[1:29:28] realize God's already expressed himself
[1:29:33] Amen in you
[1:29:36] amen can you imagine I mean it should be
[1:29:39] be under comprehension that God would
[1:29:41] step down into human flesh you and
[1:29:46] I and then
[1:29:48] say I just don't know if I can make it
[1:29:51] yeah I don't know that I can over
[1:29:54] come Satan's a tougher adversary than
[1:29:58] than I
[1:29:59] thought no my brother and sister we need
[1:30:01] to come to a full comprehension and I
[1:30:03] just want to sum this right down sister
[1:30:05] via would come I want to sum this right
[1:30:08] down we need to look at this the way God
[1:30:12] Amen looks at it that's right and to him
[1:30:16] the victory was one a millennia ago he's
[1:30:21] not looking for going to hopefully be
[1:30:23] victorious
[1:30:24] hopefully going to overcome the spirit
[1:30:26] of the age hopefully we're going to no
[1:30:29] it's settled it's finished all we got to
[1:30:32] do is just be faithful and let him I
[1:30:35] made this joke before and I don't really
[1:30:37] say it as a joke but there was some uh
[1:30:39] music artist said you know Lord Jesus
[1:30:42] Take the Wheel sang some song Jesus Take
[1:30:45] the Wheel the meantime they've got one
[1:30:47] foot on The Brak and one foot on the gas

[1:30:51] time for us to just give it all to him

[1:32:03] order of those people who lay on those
[1:32:05] beds of
[1:32:06] nails or walk across the red hot
[1:32:11] coals and they would say praise God that
