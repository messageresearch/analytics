[39:49] of our redemption
[39:52] revelation of our redemption and my
[39:54] subtitle is whose hand hath saved thee
[39:57] now we read in luke that your redemption
[40:01] draweth nigh in other words it belongs
[40:03] to you
[40:05] it's not
[40:06] dad's redemption or mom's redemption or
[40:08] the pastor's redemption it's your
[40:10] redemption
[40:11] you get it by firsthand experience
[40:14] you're the one who walks up to the
[40:16] throne if you will and takes the book
[40:18] for yourself
[40:20] john typed the bride in revelations when
[40:22] he took the book that is your redemption
[40:24] that book
[40:26] is your redemption sometimes i think we
[40:30] at least i have in my my walk in times
[40:32] past
[40:33] separated redemption from the word
[40:36] it was redemption was something that was
[40:38] in the word but redemption is the word
[40:41] redemption the book of redemption is the
[40:44] whole entire thing and redemption is not
[40:46] just
[40:48] christ died on the cross
[40:50] that was necessary for redemption but
[40:53] that's not the whole
[40:54] that's a part of the whole and so i was
[40:57] thinking along these lines the other day
[40:59] and you know thinking about the uh
[41:01] restoration of redemption or redemptions
[41:03] restoration uh thinking along the lines
[41:06] of what of revelation's purpose
[41:08] because for me growing up and the
[41:10] message hearing preachers talk about uh
[41:13] the seals and and the thunders and
[41:15] different things those those kind of
[41:17] those key phrases that you hear tossed
[41:19] around
[41:20] i always wonder no those are the deep
[41:22] things in my brain as a kid would kind
[41:24] of turn off because i didn't understand
[41:25] it and so
[41:28] as i as i began to grow begin to think
[41:30] and and lately really been impressed
[41:32] upon me that what is the purpose of
[41:35] revelation why are these things in the
[41:37] word and who has taken them and made
[41:39] them complicated
[41:41] who has taken them and made them seem to
[41:43] be something that sister vanessa can't
[41:46] understand who has taken them and said
[41:48] you know we can't teach it in children
[41:50] sunday school it's it's it's it's a
[41:52] bigger thing and i began to think you
[41:54] know
[41:55] what is the purpose of revelation
[41:57] brother brown says revelation is more
[41:59] important than uh to us then we realize
[42:01] and he says that that if the bride can
[42:04] catch a revelation of the two frameworks
[42:06] in the church she'll be an invincible
[42:08] army but still for me that that wasn't
[42:10] what i that wasn't enough that wasn't
[42:12] deep enough i was talking to our pastor
[42:14] the other day and i know this is nothing
[42:16] new when you read the word of god
[42:18] there's a surface revelation but then
[42:20] there's a deeper revelation that
[42:22] requires work on your part
[42:25] it requires work you have to dig in
[42:28] you're sure the the denominations read
[42:30] and they can tell the story of the
[42:32] crucifixion but if you if but by
[42:35] revelation you dig deeper you find out
[42:38] god's great plan all the way back in the
[42:40] garden of eden from genesis all the way
[42:43] to revelation
[42:44] there's something deeper that god is
[42:46] trying to show us and and um brother
[42:49] brahms talks about the deep that call us
[42:51] to the deep because there's a deep to
[42:52] respond deep not as in complicated
[42:56] deep as in a secret
[42:59] that only has only been revealed to an
[43:01] elected few it's revelation what is the
[43:04] deep the deep is only attained by
[43:06] revelation
[43:08] so there's something in you that god put
[43:11] in you that can that can reach out
[43:14] and catch that that's predestination the
[43:16] deep within you is predestination to
[43:20] respond to the deep in the word which is
[43:22] revelation
[43:24] that was a lot um
[43:26] alana i feel like that was a big
[43:28] uh sentence there but
[43:31] so what what what is revelations purpose
[43:33] and and and i i uh i i laugh about this
[43:36] i finally realized my wife says you over
[43:38] complicate everything you overthink
[43:40] everything and i finally realized today
[43:42] why i'm an engineer
[43:44] i work i am a software engineer i think
[43:46] like an engineer and we are notorious
[43:48] for overcomplicating things if we can
[43:51] make something more difficult we will
[43:53] not because we want to make it more
[43:54] difficult but because we just over
[43:56] complicate it in our heads and we end up
[43:58] with way too much code than we actually
[44:00] need and so on and so forth and then you
[44:03] guys have to put up with that
[44:05] but um so for me but but i i think i
[44:08] take that and i have to i have to be uh
[44:10] i have to be discerning and conscious
[44:13] that i don't take that too far but i
[44:15] believe that that is something that god
[44:16] has given me because i don't just take
[44:17] it first glance
[44:20] i want to i want to take it and i wanna
[44:22] and i wanna dissect it and i wanna break
[44:24] it down not intellectually
[44:26] not intellectually but i pray god i can
[44:28] tell there's something more here there's
[44:31] something more than what i'm just
[44:32] reading in the pages and sitting in the
[44:34] back room i was thinking that's the
[44:36] difference when brother bram says don't
[44:37] read the bible like a newspaper that's
[44:40] what he's talking about there's
[44:41] something deeper he says read between
[44:44] the lines and you listen to his later
[44:47] his later messages he says a lot of
[44:48] things as well but the elect will catch
[44:51] what i was saying and he stops he says
[44:54] so much without saying anything at all
[44:57] because it's by revelation you see you
[44:59] that's not a man a man can't do that a
[45:01] man can't put the words together no it's
[45:03] god
[45:04] putting something a secret for for us to
[45:07] to catch a hold of him please uh just
[45:10] put your spiritual thinking caps on and
[45:12] and don't um
[45:13] young people especially don't they go
[45:15] it's a it's a an adult service
[45:18] you can understand this the bible talks
[45:20] about the 11th hour worker
[45:24] a fresh born or
[45:26] or a young person coming up in the youth
[45:28] group you can have the revelation
[45:31] this revelation that we talk about god
[45:33] can reveal you don't have to be a
[45:34] certain age to catch revelation of
[45:36] christ who christ is to you that will be
[45:38] contrary to the scripture
[45:41] so what is the important things and and
[45:43] uh um
[45:44] the importance of the revelation of the
[45:46] seasonals and thanks because because
[45:47] it's not just in the bible to be in the
[45:50] bible to be and i struggle to to to
[45:52] bring this out and i i just have to
[45:54] trust god to to to anoint your ears but
[45:57] it's it's it's when we look at and this
[46:00] was from my own experience and maybe i'm
[46:02] the only one i doubt it but uh this in
[46:04] my own experience i would look at these
[46:07] things and i would separate them
[46:10] say oh oh i love god and i have the holy
[46:13] ghost and then there's these things the
[46:16] seals and all that
[46:18] and so i began to think and god began to
[46:20] deal with my heart that you obviously we
[46:23] know you can't separate it's all god's
[46:25] word but what's the purpose why is that
[46:28] there what is god's
[46:31] desire
[46:35] so
[46:36] laying the groundwork there
[46:40] in we read in judges chapter 7
[46:44] the story of gideon and i apologize for
[46:47] always actually i don't
[46:49] gideon is just on my heart the past
[46:51] years
[46:53] and abraham every time i study i come
[46:55] back to either one of those guys
[46:57] and um
[46:59] so in jud i was reading this the other
[47:01] day
[47:02] and it just stuck out to me in judges 7
[47:04] 2
[47:06] the lord tells him why he had too many
[47:09] men
[47:10] that's right
[47:12] the people that are with thee are too
[47:14] many for me to give the midianites into
[47:17] their hands
[47:19] because i know
[47:21] israel
[47:23] and they'll take the battle and they'll
[47:26] walk away and say look what we did
[47:31] now i'm not
[47:32] what the what the groundwork i laid just
[47:35] put a little asterisk in your notes
[47:38] we're going to come back to that
[47:40] but he's getting god says gideon you you
[47:43] have too many men and gideon says well
[47:47] that doesn't make sense
[47:49] have you seen the midianites
[47:52] the bible says there were so many
[47:54] midianites and amalekites and their
[47:57] their camels and their donkeys that they
[48:00] they they basically trampled the ground
[48:01] the the the the uh
[48:04] where the israel lived
[48:06] they just consumed everything in their
[48:08] path
[48:11] and so god says
[48:13] look
[48:14] if you don't go to battle with these men
[48:18] israel's going to take credit for it and
[48:21] i was reading in ephesians because
[48:23] brother bannon says joshua parallels
[48:25] ephesians
[48:27] and i was reading in ephesians and if we
[48:29] read it here ephesians 2
[48:30] 9 not of works lest any man should boast
[48:36] so
[48:36] what what is this what is this
[48:39] thing that we're talking about for by
[48:41] grace are you saved through faith which
[48:44] faith is revelation
[48:46] that not of yourselves it is the gift of
[48:48] god so in other words it's a gift of god
[48:51] there is nothing you could do
[48:55] and the reason it was that way it was
[48:57] the same reason in judges that god had
[49:00] to take
[49:01] and separate the men
[49:11] because god wanted you to walk in this
[49:14] life to walk the life of a christian and
[49:18] know
[49:19] you cannot do it your own
[49:25] what does that take what it we're going
[49:26] to see here in gideon what it took for
[49:29] gideon to get to that place so gideon he
[49:32] he he puts okay let me back up here i'll
[49:35] get you ahead of myself judges 6 13 i
[49:37] just have it here
[49:39] and gideon said unto him oh my lord if
[49:41] the lord be with us why then is all this
[49:44] befallen us and where be all his
[49:46] miracles which our fathers told us of
[49:50] saying did not the lord bring us up from
[49:52] egypt but now the lord has forsaken us
[49:54] and delivered us into the hands of the
[49:57] midianites so the angel comes to gideon
[50:00] actually the bible says i thought this
[50:01] was interesting that the angel was
[50:03] sitting under the oak
[50:05] and then he appeared to gideon
[50:08] so the angel came down to watch gideon
[50:11] for a while he sat under the oak
[50:14] and he was watching gideon threshing the
[50:16] wheat
[50:17] what was that brother brown said i'll
[50:19] read a quote but the man says gideon was
[50:20] thinking about
[50:22] the word
[50:23] while he's threshing with his death it
[50:26] was the angel anointing his thoughts
[50:29] preparing him for the message he had to
[50:32] bring
[50:33] so gideon is is threshing the wheat
[50:37] have not i sent thee 1962 now gideon
[50:39] when he was out there threshing his
[50:40] wheat no doubt but that prophet's
[50:42] message was going through his heart what
[50:45] that prophet said i'm the god of abraham
[50:47] isaac and jacob i'm the one who brought
[50:49] you out of egypt i'm the one that give
[50:51] you what you've got turn to me there he
[50:54] and his father out there are threshing
[50:55] this sweet and an angel come to him or
[50:59] he thought it was an angel
[51:01] listen it happened to turn out it wasn't
[51:03] an angel it was god himself
[51:07] because it's capital l o r d s you see
[51:10] and when he spoke again so god himself
[51:12] came down god couldn't allow an angel
[51:15] there wasn't enough
[51:17] god said my son needs to hear from my
[51:19] mouth
[51:22] god said the same thing about you and i
[51:23] he
[51:24] came down himself in a cloud
[51:27] fulfilling scripture says my children
[51:29] need to hear from me directly
[51:33] not that brother branham was is god the
[51:36] voice
[51:38] hearing directly from god a revelation
[51:40] because gideon had some needed to catch
[51:43] something
[51:44] and when he spoke to gideon gideon was a
[51:46] little surprised this is the quote he
[51:48] said now mighty man of valor he didn't
[51:50] know he was maybe you don't know who no
[51:52] you are not now let me just stop there
[51:55] for a second did gideon jump and shout
[51:58] and get all excited when the angel said
[52:00] you're a mighty man of valor
[52:02] there was no kind of excitement in
[52:05] gideon gideon i like this gideon was a
[52:08] careful man
[52:10] he said wait a second
[52:14] you say that god is forced and all these
[52:16] things but i'm not seeing it
[52:20] he took the message from the angel and
[52:22] ran it through the word
[52:25] paul says if an angel comes to you and
[52:27] preached anything then what i have told
[52:29] you let him be false so gideon checks it
[52:31] with the word then he says okay let me
[52:33] let me really make sure let me prove the
[52:35] word i'm going to get a fleece and do
[52:37] these things you know we many times we
[52:38] take that those oh gideon just couldn't
[52:40] have faith but if we take it in that
[52:43] context and there's nothing wrong with
[52:44] using that example the the word can go
[52:46] many directions
[52:47] if we take it in in that way we would
[52:49] say oh god is is imperfect he came to
[52:52] gideon too soon
[52:54] but see gideon was making sure
[52:57] gideon was making sure he had a hold of
[53:00] faith now i got ahead of myself
[53:04] gideon wanted to run this thing out
[53:07] completely and see this god going to
[53:10] keep his word is this really god
[53:13] now he said might not he didn't know he
[53:15] was maybe you don't know you are you
[53:18] might be many of those mighty men of
[53:19] valor tonight sitting here you saying
[53:21] the old little church some
[53:24] little
[53:24] the little church small group oh my
[53:27] there was only two there him and his
[53:28] daddy
[53:30] there only has to be two here you and
[53:32] christ and that's all it takes to be a
[53:33] mighty man of valor so um
[53:36] here's gideon and he takes the word and
[53:39] he takes and he puts an offering on the
[53:41] rock and we know the fire comes from the
[53:43] rock and consumes it and gideon says oh
[53:45] this is this is this has to be god so so
[53:48] let me take and he does the fleeces and
[53:50] he puts him before the angel
[53:53] and god
[53:54] and he he gideon is is is what is gideon
[53:58] doing he's digging in like i said
[54:00] earlier he's digging in he saw this is
[54:03] an angel this is a message from the
[54:05] angel that that that i'm gonna go that
[54:08] he wants me to go and fight the
[54:09] midianites
[54:10] let me make sure i have the scripture
[54:12] right
[54:21] so
[54:22] well i want to back up here because the
[54:24] angel of the lord in verse 12 6 12 says
[54:26] and angel lord appeared to him and said
[54:27] unto him the lord is with thee thou
[54:29] mighty man of valor then gideon says
[54:32] unto him o my lord if the lord be with
[54:35] us
[54:36] why then is all this befall on us and
[54:38] where be all his miracles so gideon's
[54:40] response to that statement is if the
[54:43] lord be with us where is he
[54:47] where is the lord and the lord doesn't
[54:49] say oh get in you know drop that
[54:51] attitude knock it off um listen we're
[54:54] i'm here just just you know no god says
[54:58] go god that ignores
[55:00] that
[55:02] he ignores that he says he says i know
[55:05] your heart gideon i know what you're
[55:07] searching for
[55:08] and that's why i'm here so let's not
[55:11] bother with with bringing an argument to
[55:13] people who say well where is god then
[55:15] show them god
[55:17] live god out until people say i see
[55:20] christ in you people want to argue and
[55:22] say well this that or the other don't
[55:24] argue with them just live a life that
[55:26] will shut them up i'm sorry if that
[55:28] comes out too harsh i don't mean it in
[55:30] that context and then you know you're in
[55:32] competition against them but live a life
[55:34] live a life that will
[55:36] preach christ out to the world
[55:39] and so he says so the lord just goes on
[55:41] he says ignore that statement he says go
[55:43] in this thy might and thou shalt save
[55:45] israel from the hand of the midianites
[55:47] have not i sent thee in other words
[55:49] you're looking for the god you're
[55:51] looking for this the god of yesterday
[55:54] the god that the word the prophets told
[55:56] you these the same yesterday today and
[55:58] forever you're looking for these
[56:01] miracles
[56:02] you're wondering where god is i'm going
[56:04] to show you go after the midianites
[56:08] go after the midianites
[56:12] he says so then he says you know how can
[56:13] i how can i save israel i'm poor and
[56:16] lease in my father's house and the lord
[56:18] says i will be with thee thou shalt
[56:20] smite the midianites as one man.
[56:24] so he goes through the signs and
[56:26] different things but gideon
[56:29] he was digging in
[56:32] digging into the message he heard
[56:34] digging into the word that came from the
[56:36] lord you're going to take the midian
[56:38] heights
[56:39] so gideon after after he after he he
[56:43] does this and then he begins to gather
[56:45] an army that is too large
[56:48] now remember tonight our title is
[56:49] revelation of our redemption
[56:52] whose hand hath saved thee
[56:54] he gathers this army together
[56:57] and the lord says look gideon
[57:00] that's too big we'll need to cut it down
[57:02] to size because i want israel to know
[57:05] it's me
[57:07] so gideon obeys the word of god
[57:10] cuts the army down to 300 men judges
[57:13] seven verse seven if you want to turn
[57:14] there with me you can
[57:16] and the lord said it to gideon by the
[57:18] 300 men
[57:20] that lapped will i save you
[57:22] and deliver the midianites into thine
[57:24] hand and let all the other people go
[57:26] every man unto his place so the people
[57:29] took victual victuals in their hand and
[57:31] their trumpets and he sent all the rest
[57:33] of israel every man under his tent
[57:36] and retained those 300 men and the host
[57:38] of midian was beneath him in the valley
[57:42] and it came to pass the same night that
[57:44] the lord said unto him arise get thee
[57:46] down unto the host for i have delivered
[57:48] it into thine hand
[57:51] now look at this look at how gracious
[57:54] god is
[57:55] but also look at what god's trying to do
[57:57] god knew the lord knew gideon could not
[58:00] go in his current condition
[58:04] he was missing something
[58:06] we've talked about shamgar what was
[58:08] shamgar's defining moment
[58:11] i've said this enough times here you
[58:12] probably can repeat it his defining
[58:14] moment was he caught a revelation of his
[58:16] position
[58:18] it wasn't when he picked up the ox code
[58:19] it wasn't when he hit the philistines
[58:21] the battle was already won before he
[58:23] even touched the octagon because he got
[58:24] a revelation of his position
[58:28] now what is that position
[58:31] so gideon's in the same boat and brother
[58:34] and the lord says for i have delivered
[58:35] it into thine hand but if thou fear to
[58:38] go down go thou with furo thy servant
[58:41] down to the host and thou shalt hear
[58:43] what they say and afterwards shall thine
[58:46] hands be strengthened to go down and
[58:48] unto the host then when he down with
[58:50] fury his servant
[58:52] onto the outside of the armed men that
[58:54] were in the host and the midianites and
[58:56] the amalekites and all the children of
[58:57] the east lay along in the valley like
[59:00] grasshoppers for multitude and their
[59:03] camels were without number as the sand
[59:05] by the seaside for multitude and when
[59:08] gideon was come behold there was a man
[59:11] that told a dream unto his fellow so
[59:13] gideon sneaks on down to the camp in the
[59:15] midianites and he sits next to a tent
[59:18] and he begins to listen in
[59:20] and he hears this fellow begin to tell a
[59:22] dream he says behold i dreamed a dream
[59:24] and lo a cake of barley bread tumbled
[59:26] into the host of midian and came unto a
[59:29] tent and smote it that it fell and
[59:32] overturned it that the tent lay along
[59:34] and his fellow answered and said this is
[59:36] nothing else save the sword of gideon
[59:39] and the son of job the son of joash a
[59:41] man of israel for into his hand hath god
[59:44] delivered midian and all the hosts
[59:49] the devil testifying of god's victory
[59:54] the devil knows he's beat
[59:57] but he lies to you to make you think
[59:59] otherwise
[1:00:01] the devil already knows he's defeated
[1:00:05] why does satan hate revelation so much
[1:00:09] right here
[1:00:10] this was gideon's defining moment
[1:00:13] he caught
[1:00:15] a revelation of his redemption
[1:00:19] the defeat of the midianites was just as
[1:00:22] much a deliverance for gideon as it was
[1:00:25] for the children of israel
[1:00:28] the defeat of the midianites was just as
[1:00:31] much a deliverance for gideon as it was
[1:00:34] for the children of israel
[1:00:37] gideon was hiding from the midianites
[1:00:39] gideon was having his food stolen gideon
[1:00:42] was dealing with the enemy on a daily
[1:00:44] basis this deliverance that god gave to
[1:00:47] him wasn't just for israel was for
[1:00:49] gideon as well
[1:00:51] but gideon had to catch a revelation of
[1:00:54] his redemption redemption for israel had
[1:00:58] to become a possession of gideon's
[1:01:01] he couldn't just say this is the
[1:01:02] redemption story of israel god said he's
[1:01:05] going to save the the israel from the
[1:01:06] midianites and all these things no that
[1:01:08] had to become something personal it
[1:01:11] couldn't just be god's redemption it had
[1:01:14] to be your redemption it has to be your
[1:01:16] redemption but how can you get to that
[1:01:19] position
[1:01:20] how can you get to that position as a
[1:01:23] son and a daughter of god you have to
[1:01:25] catch a revelation that it's your
[1:01:28] redemption you need revelation what
[1:01:31] placed the children of israel in their
[1:01:33] promised land
[1:01:35] they crossed over jordan they caught a
[1:01:37] revelation that the word given to them
[1:01:40] the redemption because that was their
[1:01:42] land abraham the bible says footsteps is
[1:01:45] possession abraham done walked every
[1:01:47] square mile of canaan it belonged to
[1:01:50] them
[1:01:52] there's actually a scripture and i think
[1:01:54] it's judges where's where the
[1:01:57] uh i forget who it is they come and they
[1:01:58] say hey israel you're on our land it's
[1:02:00] ours and they said and the it's j it's
[1:02:03] jephthah jeff the one who makes the vow
[1:02:05] and has to to kill his daughters he says
[1:02:06] to them he said if your god told you if
[1:02:09] your gods told you this land and this
[1:02:10] land was your land would you not go
[1:02:12] after that and take that
[1:02:14] god told us this is our land we'll fight
[1:02:16] you for it
[1:02:18] see jephthah had a revelation
[1:02:21] you see jeff that was cast out from his
[1:02:23] brethren
[1:02:25] as a as a vagabond but before you ever
[1:02:28] hear the story of jephthah the first
[1:02:30] thing in the scripture says jessa was a
[1:02:32] mighty man of valor
[1:02:34] so before we begin to hear of what the
[1:02:36] world says was wrong with jephthah
[1:02:38] because he was an illegitimate child
[1:02:41] cast out from the his brothers but he
[1:02:43] says he was the mighty man of valor and
[1:02:46] and and then when gibia uh the
[1:02:48] gibeonites got in gileadites excuse me
[1:02:50] got in trouble they went to him they
[1:02:52] said look can you save us
[1:02:54] you see
[1:02:55] what do they say they say when they want
[1:02:56] to make fun of you and they want to
[1:02:58] laugh at you but when they're in trouble
[1:02:59] who do they come for prayer
[1:03:01] you
[1:03:03] because they recognize christ in you
[1:03:05] they recognize something in jephthah
[1:03:07] said this man has the ability to slay
[1:03:10] enemies
[1:03:11] is that how you want to be known you
[1:03:13] want to be known as as the as the son
[1:03:16] and the the individual who can slay
[1:03:18] enemies yes i kind of like that title
[1:03:22] guess what you already are you have the
[1:03:24] potential to be an enemy slayer so jeff
[1:03:26] that goes and he says you know you and
[1:03:28] and this god gave us this land we're
[1:03:30] going to fight for it
[1:03:32] so um
[1:03:34] praise the lord i don't know what where
[1:03:35] i where i got off onto that but we'll
[1:03:37] just come back to the notes and
[1:03:39] so um gideon caught a revelation of his
[1:03:42] redemption
[1:03:44] but what was it that he grabbed a hold
[1:03:46] of
[1:03:48] what was it that he was able to grab a
[1:03:50] hold of something you see his fear was
[1:03:52] doing nothing for him i keep coming back
[1:03:54] to this
[1:03:55] god's trying to tell us something
[1:03:57] there's fear and there's faith
[1:03:59] fear whether i'm says is nothing
[1:04:01] but faith is an actual substance i have
[1:04:04] the quote right here perfect faith 1963.
[1:04:07] now here's where many people fail to
[1:04:08] receive their healing or what they're
[1:04:11] asking for so he says he
[1:04:12] healing and then he says or what they're
[1:04:14] asking for that covers everything
[1:04:16] because they take faith to be something
[1:04:18] that it is not
[1:04:20] see they don't believe it in other words
[1:04:22] so he's saying they're not saying they
[1:04:23] don't have faith they're putting faith
[1:04:25] in the wrong category
[1:04:27] they don't believe it he says it's not
[1:04:29] imagination this is his words and i love
[1:04:32] this it is a actual substance
[1:04:38] it is an actual substance
[1:04:43] again in the same message or in the same
[1:04:45] message notice it is something that you
[1:04:46] possess not imagination
[1:04:49] if you really have it
[1:04:51] saints okay i think i did this the other
[1:04:53] day but if i gave brother david this
[1:04:55] bible and he had a hold of it could i
[1:04:57] tell him he wasn't holding a bible
[1:05:00] no i couldn't talk him out of it
[1:05:02] they you all think i was crazy if i
[1:05:04] tried to say no that's not a bible
[1:05:05] that's a dictionary and the words of say
[1:05:07] bible right there on there
[1:05:09] you think i was crazy because that's
[1:05:11] faith
[1:05:12] that's faith you can grab a hold of it
[1:05:14] you couldn't tell gideon after god gave
[1:05:16] him a revelation god gave him a
[1:05:18] revelation of his redemption you
[1:05:20] couldn't tell gideon no you're going to
[1:05:21] be defeated by the midianites
[1:05:24] that's right michael you see sometimes
[1:05:26] sometimes our opposition doesn't just
[1:05:28] come from the outside when the devil
[1:05:30] comes with opposition from the secular
[1:05:32] world you could yeah well that's them
[1:05:34] but what happens when you're michael and
[1:05:36] your opposition comes from preachers in
[1:05:38] the message
[1:05:40] that was straight
[1:05:43] what happens when opposition comes from
[1:05:45] my brother or sister in the message who
[1:05:46] come to you and tell you you're wrong
[1:05:49] what are you going to do
[1:05:51] if you're right
[1:05:53] what are you going to do what's going to
[1:05:54] keep you what's going to protect you
[1:05:56] what is your shield
[1:05:58] what is your shield
[1:06:00] faith what is faith revelation
[1:06:04] so how are you going to fight like how
[1:06:06] was my care able to stand alone
[1:06:09] even with with um
[1:06:11] jehoshapha jehoshaphat
[1:06:14] sitting there a fellow brother who
[1:06:16] believed like my care kept his mouth
[1:06:18] shut
[1:06:19] he was scared to speak up he learned his
[1:06:22] lesson by the way if you go later on and
[1:06:23] you read it
[1:06:25] i think it was jehoshaphat he learned
[1:06:27] his lesson and when ahab's son said hey
[1:06:28] will you fight with me he said nope
[1:06:32] see a real son of god learned his lesson
[1:06:34] but even he kept his mouth shut he said
[1:06:37] you can't look to somebody else to back
[1:06:39] you up
[1:06:40] you can't look to somebody else to
[1:06:41] anchor yourself and you need to stand
[1:06:44] alone on what god has given you gideon
[1:06:48] stood alone when he put his entire
[1:06:50] sacrifice when he put the meal he
[1:06:52] prepared with his hands upon the rock he
[1:06:55] stood alone where was his dad his dad
[1:06:57] wasn't there he was by himself
[1:07:00] and he put his sacrifice upon the rock
[1:07:03] and when he saw the fire of god consume
[1:07:06] it
[1:07:07] he got a revelation this is god's word
[1:07:11] but then he needed to build his faith
[1:07:14] faith cometh by hearing hearing the word
[1:07:17] of god we know what hearing is its
[1:07:18] revelation so he said so he waited he
[1:07:20] listened to a few tapes
[1:07:23] he listened to uh part one of fleece is
[1:07:25] wet ground is dry uh then part two
[1:07:29] fleece is dry ground is wet
[1:07:31] then he went down and he and he put his
[1:07:33] ear to the tent and he and he heard the
[1:07:35] message of of of the deliverance of by
[1:07:37] the loaf of bread
[1:07:40] and something
[1:07:41] moved within him
[1:07:43] something moved with him and he realized
[1:07:45] you know what the 300 men are not
[1:07:48] i know
[1:07:49] i'll be victorious
[1:07:51] i had a a a a a christian but not a
[1:07:54] believer tell me something that was i
[1:07:56] just i took it to the you know i could
[1:08:00] tell me something that really spoke to
[1:08:01] me i believe it was it was the lord
[1:08:04] he says you must especially as a man you
[1:08:07] must become autonomous meaning it's just
[1:08:10] you and god
[1:08:12] no matter what happens in the world it
[1:08:14] doesn't move you
[1:08:15] that's right you're not dependent on
[1:08:17] your job you're not dependent on your
[1:08:19] spouse you're not dependent on your
[1:08:21] parents you're not dependent on your
[1:08:22] church you are autonomous it's you and
[1:08:25] god no matter what falls down around you
[1:08:29] it doesn't affect you
[1:08:31] but there's channels to get there that
[1:08:34] means coming to church so you do need
[1:08:36] church you do need your wife
[1:08:38] but you're in a position where it
[1:08:40] doesn't matter what somebody will say
[1:08:42] because that's the that i that's what i
[1:08:45] think which is the word so closely we
[1:08:47] would deceive the very like if it were
[1:08:48] possible is not just doctrinal right
[1:08:52] it's someone with good intentions
[1:08:54] telling you that's not the will of god
[1:08:56] it's someone with good intentions
[1:08:57] telling you no this is the will of god
[1:08:59] but you have to get to a position like
[1:09:01] gideon where you said the midianites are
[1:09:03] big the rest of israel is back cozy in
[1:09:06] their beds in their tents
[1:09:07] me and these 300 guys are going to go
[1:09:09] fight
[1:09:12] but i know i have a revelation he could
[1:09:15] have never found his victory unless he
[1:09:17] first caught a revelation of his
[1:09:19] redemption
[1:09:25] possessed he caught up he faith
[1:09:28] he had he had a hold of something
[1:09:32] the revelation
[1:09:34] excuse me
[1:09:37] the revelation that the same god for
[1:09:39] moses and joshua
[1:09:42] was the same god for gideon
[1:09:45] became gideon's revelation
[1:09:47] what happened the word from the lord and
[1:09:51] gideon's revelation pulled christ from
[1:09:53] history
[1:09:55] you hear about it jesus christ is saying
[1:09:57] yesterday today and forever you saw the
[1:09:58] miracles you saw these things you see
[1:10:00] you hear the word preach but it's
[1:10:02] revelation that's going to pull god from
[1:10:05] this bible this bible contains prophecy
[1:10:07] but this bible itself is a record of
[1:10:09] history
[1:10:10] it can't just sit there and be history
[1:10:13] this is your redemption
[1:10:16] you need to ask god for revelation so
[1:10:18] you can pull christ out of history so
[1:10:20] that christ stands directly before you
[1:10:23] and you catch a revelation of your
[1:10:25] redemption i hope you're tying this back
[1:10:28] by god's grace to what i said at the
[1:10:29] beginning with the purpose of revelation
[1:10:31] why is revelation so important why is is
[1:10:34] catching a revelation of the of the of
[1:10:35] the open word why is that so important
[1:10:38] and why do people
[1:10:40] listen this is this is actually
[1:10:43] easy
[1:10:44] people who don't have a revelation of
[1:10:46] the open world don't live
[1:10:50] christian lives the way they should
[1:10:54] you will find things in there that don't
[1:10:56] line up with the word of god
[1:10:58] so let me ask you something is it open
[1:10:59] or is it closed
[1:11:02] because you can never bring christ you
[1:11:04] can never display christ unless he's
[1:11:06] open
[1:11:08] amen
[1:11:09] in genesis chapter four we won't
[1:11:13] turn there for the sake of time i have
[1:11:14] become
[1:11:16] amen never mind not gonna make it just
[1:11:19] genesis chapter four we read the story
[1:11:20] of abel
[1:11:22] i'm gonna train her just because for
[1:11:23] reference because i have a hard time
[1:11:25] recollecting sometimes from memory
[1:11:29] but we see you see
[1:11:30] abel and cain come into the into the end
[1:11:33] of the earth
[1:11:37] adam
[1:11:38] preached to his home
[1:11:40] you don't have to to read it verbatim
[1:11:43] you just look at their lives what what
[1:11:45] else would adam and eve do but testify
[1:11:48] of what they did wrong
[1:11:50] and talk about how they they had the fig
[1:11:52] leaves and and then god gave them the
[1:11:54] animal skins you see in that ministering
[1:11:57] forth abel caught a revelation
[1:12:00] abel caught a revelation of his
[1:12:03] redemption the redemption of his parents
[1:12:05] became his redemption the redemption of
[1:12:08] adam and eve
[1:12:10] became abel's redemption now we know in
[1:12:13] context
[1:12:14] for the sake of context their their
[1:12:16] redemption was coming
[1:12:18] and they didn't live a thousand years
[1:12:20] but the blood of the of the lamb of the
[1:12:23] skin that the slain lamb covered adam
[1:12:26] and eve so abel caught a revelation of
[1:12:28] that abel had a revelation of his
[1:12:31] redemption
[1:12:32] and he goes and he offers a a firstling
[1:12:36] of this flock and of the fat thereof and
[1:12:38] the lord had respect unto abel and to
[1:12:40] his offering but unto cain and to his
[1:12:43] offering he had no respect now in the
[1:12:45] message identification when cain offered
[1:12:48] the fruits of the field as apples and
[1:12:50] the fruits and so forth and made his
[1:12:52] altar pretty and said god will accept
[1:12:55] this because i've done all this and fix
[1:12:57] the great altars and i've decorated i
[1:12:59] made it pretty we got the biggest church
[1:13:01] in the city now this is you'll see here
[1:13:03] in a second why i pulled this quote or
[1:13:04] so forth god will accept it in this
[1:13:08] now quotations end so cain's no longer
[1:13:10] speaking but it says he god he accepts
[1:13:14] the work of no man's hand in redemption
[1:13:19] he accepts the work of no man's hands in
[1:13:23] redemption
[1:13:25] redemption cannot be manufactured by man
[1:13:30] you can't do it you can impersonate the
[1:13:33] gifts you can impersonate speaking in
[1:13:35] tongues you can impersonate these
[1:13:37] healings and different things but you
[1:13:38] cannot impersonate redemption
[1:13:41] the veneer will crack you cannot
[1:13:44] impersonate it why because brother
[1:13:45] branham said this is a secret
[1:13:49] so that the devil can't get a hold of it
[1:13:52] there was a silence in heaven for the
[1:13:54] space of a half an hour it was a secret
[1:13:56] revealed to god's elect you see the
[1:13:59] purpose behind it that was your
[1:14:01] redemption story
[1:14:04] that was your redemption story it's a
[1:14:06] secret and redemption cannot be
[1:14:08] manufactured
[1:14:11] abel abel brought a lamb and offered
[1:14:13] blood and god testified that he was
[1:14:16] righteous he says now pay attention
[1:14:18] right here he says how did he know it
[1:14:20] there was no word written in them days
[1:14:25] it was a revelation and so it is today
[1:14:32] but we have the word written
[1:14:34] yes
[1:14:36] but what's
[1:14:37] written deeper
[1:14:41] abel had this the the the ministering
[1:14:43] from adam but it still took revelation
[1:14:46] he had no written bible
[1:14:48] you have a written bible but brother
[1:14:50] brown says it's and so it is today we
[1:14:54] have the bible but so many people are
[1:14:56] living lives completely contrary to the
[1:14:58] bible confessing that they got it from
[1:15:01] the bible
[1:15:03] why
[1:15:04] because you cannot impersonate
[1:15:07] redemption
[1:15:08] it's a revelation that this is your
[1:15:10] redemption
[1:15:12] so then if i ask you whose hand hath
[1:15:14] saved thee
[1:15:16] whose hand hath saved thee
[1:15:20] who gave you victory over the midianites
[1:15:22] who is going to give you victory over
[1:15:24] the midianites is it you
[1:15:27] no it can't be because you have caught a
[1:15:29] revelation of your
[1:15:32] look up lift up your heads victory
[1:15:36] and what is christ coming back for
[1:15:38] an overcoming bride
[1:15:41] praise god
[1:15:42] that's why it's important don't focus on
[1:15:44] your problem don't necessarily if i can
[1:15:46] put it this way with liberty don't
[1:15:48] necessarily play god deliver me god
[1:15:49] deliver me god deliver me say god give
[1:15:51] me revelation
[1:15:53] because as soon as you realize oh praise
[1:15:55] god as soon as you realize this person
[1:15:57] here is not you you'll stop acting like
[1:15:59] that
[1:16:01] and as soon as you realize that that
[1:16:02] testimony of the devil that he's telling
[1:16:04] you who you are as soon as you catch a
[1:16:06] revelation of who you actually are
[1:16:08] you'll stop acting like that
[1:16:11] that is faith
[1:16:13] that is when god said abram you are now
[1:16:16] abraham
[1:16:18] then god could take abraham onto the
[1:16:20] mountain and said sacrifice your only
[1:16:21] son
[1:16:23] you want to see what was abraham's faith
[1:16:25] go read that story
[1:16:27] abraham take your only son and sacrifice
[1:16:30] him on the altar isaac on the way up
[1:16:31] says
[1:16:32] dad i see wood
[1:16:34] and fire but where is the lamb
[1:16:37] abraham watch what he says
[1:16:40] abraham who caught a revelation of his
[1:16:42] redemption knew this son
[1:16:45] this son was his redemption
[1:16:48] knew that this song would be he think
[1:16:50] abraham was a prophet
[1:16:52] abraham knew there was something coming
[1:16:55] there was something coming that would
[1:16:56] bring him that would bring adam that
[1:16:59] would bring the future generations to
[1:17:01] come that would bring job and these
[1:17:03] different ones back into their full
[1:17:05] position abraham had a revelation of
[1:17:08] that and he said son god will provide a
[1:17:11] lamb you see what was that was that for
[1:17:13] isaac that was for you and i god will
[1:17:16] provide a lamb he's asking you to take
[1:17:19] your one and only son that precious
[1:17:20] thing you hold in your life that thing
[1:17:22] that you hold up that you can't let go
[1:17:24] of he's asking you to take it and put it
[1:17:26] upon the altar no matter what it is it
[1:17:28] doesn't have to be sin or addiction it
[1:17:30] can simply be a revelation or something
[1:17:32] in the word you don't understand take it
[1:17:35] then put on the altar say god will
[1:17:37] provide a lamb what is the provision of
[1:17:40] a lamb your redemption
[1:17:43] your redemption the provision of the
[1:17:46] lamb is your redemption and that
[1:17:48] revelation is you as a son and daughter
[1:17:51] of god positionally placed
[1:17:54] in the land you're not going to be an
[1:17:56] ephraim you're not going to try to be
[1:17:57] growing corn in manasseh that's right
[1:18:01] that's right but the bear mentions that
[1:18:03] in the adoption series
[1:18:05] number two or something
[1:18:07] you're not going to be what does that
[1:18:08] mean
[1:18:09] you're not taking the word of god
[1:18:11] and putting it in the past or putting it
[1:18:14] in the future you're saying it's today
[1:18:16] you're positionally placing god's word
[1:18:19] all god's word is truth
[1:18:22] but it can cause
[1:18:24] where the eagles are
[1:18:26] where the carcass is there will the
[1:18:27] eagles be gathered but the bible says
[1:18:29] it's the condition of the carcass
[1:18:32] because the greek says vultures he says
[1:18:34] it's the condition of the carcass when
[1:18:36] it's fresh present-day god when it's
[1:18:38] fresh present-day word that you can eat
[1:18:41] it's eagle food but as soon as it's god
[1:18:43] in the past
[1:18:46] now catch this this isn't false doctrine
[1:18:49] as soon as it's god's word what is that
[1:18:51] as soon as you try to say let's go build
[1:18:53] an ark
[1:18:54] you're feeding on vulture food
[1:18:56] because that was noah's message
[1:19:00] praise god anyways
[1:19:06] another example here if i can
[1:19:09] caleb and joshua had a revelation of
[1:19:12] their redemption
[1:19:14] and jordan's crossing brought them into
[1:19:17] position
[1:19:18] in adoption number one 1960 but the
[1:19:21] believers the caleb and joshua outfit
[1:19:24] that was going on to the promise they
[1:19:26] moved on over into the land and took the
[1:19:28] land and settled down in the land as a
[1:19:30] possession
[1:19:33] and we never stopped by justification
[1:19:34] sanctification let's go on to the
[1:19:36] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:19:38] let's not stop at believing on the lord
[1:19:40] jesus being baptized let's not stop
[1:19:42] because he cleansed us from a life of
[1:19:44] sin
[1:19:45] but now we pressed on into a position
[1:19:49] to a promise of the baptism of the holy
[1:19:51] ghost the next paragraph down so ephesus
[1:19:55] here sets us like joshua positionally
[1:19:58] you notice joshua after crossing over
[1:20:00] the land
[1:20:01] and taking the land then he divided the
[1:20:03] land if from here manasses here and this
[1:20:05] one here god here benjamin here he
[1:20:07] divided the land
[1:20:10] you see
[1:20:11] when joshua crossed over into his
[1:20:13] promise
[1:20:15] how how was joshua and caleb able to
[1:20:17] stand against the opposition from within
[1:20:20] the church
[1:20:21] and then live through the wilderness
[1:20:24] wandering and cross over jordan how were
[1:20:26] they able to do it they caught a
[1:20:29] revelation of their redemption
[1:20:31] they call a revelation that that land
[1:20:33] was there
[1:20:34] that revelation will carry you through
[1:20:36] the wilderness that land will that
[1:20:38] revelation will carry you through
[1:20:40] false doctrine
[1:20:42] until god can bring you to a position
[1:20:44] that you can step into god god can bring
[1:20:47] it to a place that you can step into
[1:20:49] your position
[1:20:50] so when they got over there then then
[1:20:53] god could speak through the prophet
[1:20:54] joshua which is the type of the holy
[1:20:55] spirit could speak and say you go here
[1:20:57] you go here you go here it's god the
[1:21:00] holy ghost within you something that you
[1:21:02] have caught a revelation you see
[1:21:03] revelation places you as a son or
[1:21:06] daughter of god
[1:21:08] so it's got to be your redemption
[1:21:18] now in revelation chapter 5 part 2 1961
[1:21:21] we find out what was being revealed
[1:21:28] let me make sure
[1:21:29] what is the revelation of redemption
[1:21:32] see he only says that once what is the
[1:21:34] revelation of redemption in those exact
[1:21:37] things he only says that once how was we
[1:21:39] redeemed
[1:21:40] so he says he says okay so he's he's
[1:21:42] putting out the question here
[1:21:44] what is the revelation of redemption and
[1:21:47] how were we redeemed he puts that
[1:21:48] question out and then he says just look
[1:21:50] here in these last few years what's
[1:21:52] happened so he asks a question and then
[1:21:55] it kind of looks like he moves off but
[1:21:56] he says the revelation of the name of
[1:21:58] jesus in water baptism
[1:22:01] the revelation of no eternal hell
[1:22:03] never was known before
[1:22:06] and you can't have eternal life unless
[1:22:07] you're saved you've got eternal life
[1:22:09] then you cannot be burned in hell for
[1:22:11] for eternal okay let me move on down a
[1:22:13] little bit now what is it what other
[1:22:16] things so he's answering the question
[1:22:18] what is the revelation of redemption
[1:22:21] he's answering it the plan of redemption
[1:22:23] just look what's been given to us lately
[1:22:25] by the holy spirit that's right
[1:22:30] abraham's seed what the revelation meant
[1:22:34] the serpent seed see this book of
[1:22:36] revelation watch when we get to it how
[1:22:38] it peels off and i proved it right here
[1:22:40] by the scripture that's exactly the
[1:22:42] truth i go plumb back in or plumb back
[1:22:44] in genesis and pick it up and show when
[1:22:46] that seal opened it come right back down
[1:22:49] through the bible from genesis to
[1:22:50] revelation did he answer the question
[1:22:54] absolutely
[1:22:56] what is the revelation of redemption
[1:22:58] water baptism in the name of jesus
[1:23:00] christ
[1:23:01] the truth of no eternal hell not no now
[1:23:04] listen just hang on a second i i caught
[1:23:06] that there
[1:23:09] um
[1:23:10] what is the
[1:23:11] the uh serpent seed
[1:23:13] what is it those three things no
[1:23:16] but what were those three things a part
[1:23:18] of the mysteries
[1:23:20] so what is the revelation of redemption
[1:23:23] all the loose ends
[1:23:25] tied together
[1:23:28] what are the what is that is it a
[1:23:29] mystery still absolutely not
[1:23:32] he popped the lid off the top of the
[1:23:33] mountain
[1:23:35] christ did
[1:23:38] that's the revelation of redemption
[1:23:40] god's word opened to you
[1:23:44] the book
[1:23:46] that was handed to john
[1:23:49] was your redemption
[1:23:52] the open of opening of the word
[1:23:55] we use that phrase but that just
[1:23:57] what that means is
[1:24:02] what that means is there's no more
[1:24:03] mysteries
[1:24:06] you can dig into the word underneath the
[1:24:08] anointing of the holy spirit by
[1:24:10] revelation and catch
[1:24:11] everything you need
[1:24:14] why
[1:24:15] why
[1:24:16] benefit himself to you you're going to
[1:24:18] speak truth you're going to be a doer of
[1:24:20] truth
[1:24:22] nicodem god was calling nicodemus to be
[1:24:24] a doer of truth
[1:24:25] but he couldn't get past being born
[1:24:27] again
[1:24:29] he manifests okay what he does is the
[1:24:32] truth what he does he manifests christ
[1:24:35] how you judge him by the way he stays
[1:24:37] with the word
[1:24:39] right with the word you know we say and
[1:24:41] maybe you've heard me say it in
[1:24:42] conversation time will tell do you know
[1:24:45] why time will tell
[1:24:47] because of this right here
[1:24:50] how do you judge him by the way he stays
[1:24:54] with the word it's easy if i can say it
[1:24:57] it's easy to live the word for a day or
[1:24:58] two or a week or two
[1:25:00] but give it time
[1:25:02] give it time
[1:25:04] amen
[1:25:05] manifest christ see that's how you know
[1:25:08] all man is by the way he stays with the
[1:25:11] word if they speak not according to the
[1:25:13] word now he's quoting scripture there's
[1:25:15] no life in them says the bible see leave
[1:25:18] them away
[1:25:19] so it's you
[1:25:21] you want to manifest christ and and in
[1:25:23] closing
[1:25:25] musicians want to come you want to
[1:25:27] manifest christ you want to you want to
[1:25:29] bring christ forth is that your desire i
[1:25:31] believe we can all put our hands up all
[1:25:33] not our heads all say amen i'll say yes
[1:25:35] i believe that if that's your desire
[1:25:38] you have to you have to get in because
[1:25:41] faith cometh by hearing
[1:25:43] the word of god that's right
[1:25:45] which is revelation
[1:25:47] so when you when you when you when you
[1:25:49] read the bible
[1:25:51] i'm going to do something risky here
[1:25:56] and you open the bible
[1:25:58] and you begin to read second chronicles
[1:25:59] 22 and the inhabitants of jerusalem made
[1:26:01] a heisei his youngest son king in his
[1:26:03] stead for the band of men that came with
[1:26:05] the arabians to the camp had slain all
[1:26:07] the eldest so alhaji of the senator
[1:26:09] horam king of judah reigned
[1:26:14] he he also walked in the ways of the
[1:26:16] house of ahab for his mother was his
[1:26:18] counselor to do wickedly
[1:26:21] there's a story
[1:26:24] at the surface
[1:26:26] but why is it there
[1:26:29] don't read it like i know okay
[1:26:32] bob and sue finally got married
[1:26:35] you know how they do and they used to do
[1:26:36] it in the paper i don't think they still
[1:26:37] do it you read the paper oh steak's on
[1:26:39] sale for 99 cents a pound why wouldn't
[1:26:41] that be nice
[1:26:45] but when nathalia the mother of a hazel
[1:26:46] saw her son was dead she avoids and
[1:26:48] destroyed all the seed royal of the
[1:26:50] house of judah but jehoshaphat the
[1:26:51] daughter of the king took joash the son
[1:26:53] of a hazard and stole him from among the
[1:26:55] king's son
[1:26:56] joe ash hidden away
[1:27:00] you read you're reading a story
[1:27:03] but what is god trying to say
[1:27:06] what is god trying to bring out and you
[1:27:08] can go into you can go into the book of
[1:27:10] job which i know for when i was young it
[1:27:12] was hard for me to understand and you
[1:27:14] pick up chapter 25 that answered bill
[1:27:15] dad the shoehorn said dominion and fear
[1:27:17] are with him he maketh peace in his high
[1:27:19] places is there any number of his armies
[1:27:21] upon whom does not his light arise how
[1:27:23] then can man be justified with god or
[1:27:25] how can he be clean that is born of a
[1:27:26] woman
[1:27:28] that's a story you're reading there
[1:27:29] talking to joe but what is god saying
[1:27:30] that is deeper
[1:27:32] how then can ban me justify with god or
[1:27:34] how can he be clean that is born of
[1:27:36] woman what does he put it there just to
[1:27:37] fill a spot but guess what
[1:27:39] god is
[1:27:40] his word
[1:27:42] and the word is god correct
[1:27:44] what does it say we will be learning
[1:27:46] about him for all eternity maybe there's
[1:27:49] things in this written in this book we
[1:27:51] won't understand this side of glory
[1:27:54] do i care
[1:27:56] no
[1:27:57] you know why
[1:27:59] because i know whatever i need
[1:28:01] god will reveal it to me
[1:28:05] see don't
[1:28:07] don't take somebody's word it says oh
[1:28:09] it's just too deep
[1:28:11] you don't need to know
[1:28:12] don't take a man's word you know what
[1:28:13] that is that's the devil saying shoot
[1:28:16] you don't need revelation
[1:28:19] that's what he's saying
[1:28:21] it's coming out of the mouth of a person
[1:28:22] but we wrestle not against flesh
[1:28:24] but against the principalities and the
[1:28:25] powers of the air we were fighting
[1:28:27] against spirits says god and those
[1:28:28] spirits can talk through your brother
[1:28:30] and your sister
[1:28:31] that's why you need the word of god
[1:28:34] to say to your brother get thee behind
[1:28:35] me satan
[1:28:39] we are still flesh we can say things
[1:28:42] that are wrong but if we all take each
[1:28:44] other accountable to the word of god
[1:28:49] and i want to i really feel pressed upon
[1:28:51] to say this and let's just bow our heads
[1:28:53] so i don't have to look you in the eye
[1:28:56] no i shouldn't have joked like that
[1:28:59] feeling what to say is you see
[1:29:00] good men
[1:29:02] with good intentions can tell you
[1:29:04] something contrary to the word of god
[1:29:07] which you need to pray is god
[1:29:10] i'm feeling led to do something a
[1:29:13] certain way now please this is this is
[1:29:15] coming from inspiration this is not
[1:29:16] coming from what i know or of you
[1:29:18] individuals here tonight but this is
[1:29:20] something that is coming from
[1:29:21] inspiration from the word of god and
[1:29:24] that is that you need to take god and
[1:29:25] say god what what in the word of god do
[1:29:28] i need to know to shed light upon what
[1:29:31] your will is for me
[1:29:33] please i i pray that you would accept
[1:29:35] that from the from the lord and not from
[1:29:37] my from what i know because i i'm
[1:29:40] telling you it's not just from me
[1:29:42] tonight i'm feeling pressed upon by the
[1:29:44] holy spirit to speak those words
[1:29:47] god you need to pray say god i don't
[1:29:49] understand why your will would say to do
[1:29:52] this show me in the word what i'm
[1:29:54] missing
[1:29:55] to realize this is your will
[1:29:58] and i pray i believe we can all pray
[1:30:00] that tonight god in prayer tonight lord
[1:30:03] jesus i pray father that lord certain
[1:30:06] things that you have called us to do
[1:30:09] lord that you know where we stand
[1:30:12] father but sometimes we don't realize
[1:30:14] what's around us
[1:30:17] we can't understand what the future is
[1:30:19] or why things happened a certain way in
[1:30:21] the past or or why they're happening in
[1:30:24] the present
[1:30:25] but god we pray you would show us
[1:30:28] what we're missing
[1:30:29] so that god we can better grasp what
[1:30:31] your will is for us
[1:30:34] there is a scripture is in ephesians
[1:30:37] that says something along the line of be
[1:30:39] not unwise but seek out the will of the
[1:30:41] lord
[1:30:42] in other words
[1:30:44] it is wisdom
[1:30:46] to seek out your will and father what
[1:30:48] you're calling us to do
[1:30:50] might seemingly go against what we know
[1:30:53] but god may we find in your word because
[1:30:56] maybe it's our thinking that is contrary
[1:30:59] to your word not you what we think your
[1:31:02] will is contrary
[1:31:04] thank you lord jesus i pray lord that
[1:31:06] the the the the befuddled and and the
[1:31:09] this thought and that thought different
[1:31:10] ways lord you just tie it all together
[1:31:13] father if i said something in my own
[1:31:15] opinion forgive me push that aside may
[1:31:18] they not even remember it lord and you
[1:31:20] your word correct the error father lord
[1:31:23] i love you i thank you father
