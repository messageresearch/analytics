[34:47] god bless
[34:47] [Music]
[34:50] your place
[34:54] [Music]
[35:14] of we say amen to that this morning amen
[35:18] how beautiful that is
[35:21] amen
[35:22] you know
[35:23] i always am amazed how the lord can just
[35:26] give guidance and
[35:27] you know it's a decision saints that we
[35:30] have this morning
[35:32] to make
[35:34] we can either choose
[35:36] to set our
[35:37] wings to the winds of faith
[35:40] or as we have seen so clearly in the
[35:42] world today
[35:44] we can give in to the atmosphere of fear
[35:48] and we can give in to this atmosphere of
[35:50] doubt
[35:52] and
[35:53] those you know seem to be as it were
[35:56] the very obvious
[35:58] factors that there is in the world today
[36:00] we
[36:01] we either find ourselves in that realm
[36:04] of
[36:04] faith or
[36:06] in that realm of fear
[36:07] and uh
[36:09] you know that
[36:10] satan
[36:12] doesn't have to get you to believe the
[36:14] word
[36:16] if you believe the fears of the world
[36:17] around you
[36:19] because the fears of the world around
[36:21] you will so limit the word in your life
[36:24] you'll never have overcoming power
[36:27] and so it's there that we have to shed
[36:30] the atmosphere of the world we live in
[36:32] now i just want to bring before i go
[36:34] into the service i want you to just
[36:35] think about this
[36:37] now i know it's went on for ages and
[36:39] ages but we're living in this day
[36:42] you know we just passed from the fear of
[36:46] covet right they're dropping
[36:48] restrictions all all over the world
[36:51] brothers have made me
[36:53] to know for sure that they've dropped
[36:54] the restrictions in australia you might
[36:57] say the hint as it were you could come
[36:59] back and the the limitations in chile
[37:03] are falling you can come back
[37:07] so kovad's now behind us but world war
[37:10] iii
[37:11] is now in front of us
[37:13] so we have moved from one fear
[37:17] to another
[37:20] well praise the lord
[37:22] this world is not my home
[37:25] i'm just passing through
[37:27] hallelujah i don't have to worry about
[37:29] what's happening
[37:30] i don't become concerned with that
[37:33] yes the prophet of god says that he come
[37:36] to redeem those who sigh and cry for the
[37:38] abominations in the city so we can't
[37:40] just totally just you know block it all
[37:43] out but
[37:44] we have to remember that satan
[37:47] that great distracter
[37:49] is trying to distract us once again you
[37:52] don't have just a couple things i don't
[37:53] know is sister miriam them okay we
[37:56] haven't seen them for a little bit have
[37:58] they been sick or
[38:02] okay
[38:05] okay
[38:06] so just missing them sister sophie i'm
[38:09] sorry i'm i've been gonna text brother
[38:12] manasseh the last few days and i just
[38:14] keep forgetting it was on my mind this
[38:16] morning i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it
[38:18] and then i'm sitting out here and it's
[38:20] like i forgot
[38:22] but let's just remember those in the
[38:23] body okay the grams are uh in arizona
[38:26] with family and and just uh if we miss
[38:29] anybody this morning forgive us but just
[38:31] remember the body brother bob sister
[38:34] joanne and just each part of the body is
[38:37] important to us amen
[38:39] let's just stand as we go into the word
[38:41] today i want to uh
[38:43] if you want to start by turning in your
[38:45] bibles to ephesians the second chapter
[38:48] i thank amen
[38:50] we certainly never want to
[38:52] lift up the man we'll talk on that a bit
[38:54] but once again the lord's laid upon
[38:57] brother jason's heart certain songs we
[39:00] have no collaboration we have nothing of
[39:02] that nature but yet i'm i'm just like oh
[39:06] that little chorus that little verse
[39:08] this little thing it just all just you
[39:10] know strikes our heart and we're
[39:12] thankful for that and you know i want to
[39:16] uh you know just uh speak for just one
[39:19] second you know i'm still using the main
[39:21] title of the two sides of obedience
[39:23] because you see saints uh this doubt
[39:26] uh fear and faith
[39:29] you see you will be obedient
[39:32] to whichever spirit
[39:34] you give into
[39:35] so we're still in that thought of the
[39:37] two sides of obedience because if we
[39:40] walk in fear we are subject to the
[39:42] dictate of fear
[39:44] and we will become obedient to that we
[39:46] walk in faith then faith will tell you
[39:48] don't do that do this
[39:50] faith will tell you don't doubt believe
[39:53] and we then react
[39:58] and obey
[39:59] that spirit
[40:01] all through the bible
[40:03] amen just to sidetrack for just one
[40:05] moment
[40:06] go back to the story
[40:08] of saul
[40:09] jonathan and david
[40:12] and you see that whole story
[40:15] and how how it is that you see the
[40:18] influences that were there
[40:20] you see we have to follow prophecy we
[40:23] have to see the word of god fulfilled
[40:24] right it cannot fail
[40:26] but yet you see the foundation is laid
[40:29] and even saul himself
[40:31] had decisions to make and this is a very
[40:34] interesting topic
[40:36] you know uh saul had declared uh no one
[40:40] should eat any honey
[40:41] you know you don't eat anything i'm i
[40:44] want you to do and jonathan himself now
[40:46] i'm just giving you a paraphrase of it
[40:48] jonathan himself now comes and admits
[40:51] that i i've been eating the honey it was
[40:53] just a little bit but i ate some honey
[40:55] as it were from the rock
[40:57] and saul says you've went against my
[40:59] words you got to die
[41:01] but it was the people themselves that
[41:03] rose up and said
[41:04] will not touch a hair of his head and
[41:07] they rescued jonathan
[41:12] and you see how that that spirit just
[41:14] continued to anoint
[41:16] and saul's
[41:17] position before god and before man
[41:19] continued to deteriorate
[41:22] was it the fulfilling of word
[41:24] yes
[41:26] god's word will be fulfilled
[41:28] but it also shows you the character or
[41:31] the
[41:32] reaction of an anointed spirit
[41:37] you see
[41:38] prophecy was there but just so you'll
[41:41] think about it
[41:42] what if saul had just stopped one day
[41:44] and bowed his face to the earth and said
[41:46] lord i'm wrong
[41:49] help me lord i'm wrong
[41:52] but he was anointed with a spirit that i
[41:54] will do this no matter what
[41:56] and it brought about the obedience
[41:59] to that spirit
[42:01] amen so i want to speak to you this
[42:04] morning just a little title that come i
[42:06] have to admit i've been struggling to
[42:08] title things because i this hope know
[42:10] that erase it 10 times this this this
[42:14] but it just struck me and this one
[42:15] stayed with me the thought i know
[42:18] in whom i have believed
[42:21] and i think we can each one take that in
[42:23] our heart we're not here this morning
[42:25] wavering
[42:27] amen
[42:28] but we know in whom we have believed
[42:30] let's turn in our bibles ephesians the
[42:32] second chapter
[42:34] verses 1 through 10 this morning just to
[42:36] lay a ground work
[42:38] and you hath he quickened amen
[42:42] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[42:44] wherein in time past ye walked according
[42:47] to the course of this world
[42:49] now while this was written many years
[42:51] ago my brother and sister it's
[42:53] applicable today
[42:54] the course of this world according to
[42:56] the prince of the power of the air the
[42:59] spirit that now worketh in the children
[43:01] of disobedience
[43:03] among whom also we all had our
[43:05] conversation in times past in the lust
[43:08] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[43:10] the flesh and of the mind and we're by
[43:13] nature the children of wrath even as
[43:16] others
[43:18] but god who is rich in mercy for his
[43:21] great love wherewith he loved us even
[43:24] even when we were dead in sins which is
[43:26] to say unlovable
[43:29] hath quickened us together with christ
[43:31] by grace ye are saved and hath raised us
[43:34] up together and made us sit together in
[43:38] heavenly places in christ jesus
[43:41] then in the ages to come he might show
[43:44] the exceeding riches of his grace in his
[43:47] kindness toward us through christ jesus
[43:51] for by grace are ye saved through faith
[43:54] and that not of yourselves it is the
[43:57] gift of god
[43:59] you know my brother and sister this gift
[44:01] we would put in this context the
[44:03] greatest christmas gift you could ever
[44:05] receive the greatest birthday gift you
[44:08] could ever receive the greatest start of
[44:10] the summer end of the summer winter
[44:13] spring
[44:14] uh morning noon night this is absolutely
[44:17] the greatest gift that could ever be
[44:20] given to mankind hallelujah thank you
[44:23] lord
[44:24] not of works lest any man should boast
[44:27] for we are his workmanship created in
[44:30] christ jesus unto good works which god
[44:32] hath before ordained that we should walk
[44:36] in them
[44:37] heavenly father we just ask for your
[44:39] blessings this morning lord
[44:41] father just ask you to come down you
[44:43] know my heart's prayer father that you
[44:45] just bless each and every one father
[44:48] lord let each one just say this is the
[44:50] word of god and i receive it this
[44:53] morning and father we could walk out
[44:55] blessed today
[44:56] father for every uh prayer request for
[44:59] every need for everyone unable to come
[45:02] lord for the situations of life father
[45:05] we ask your perfect will be done and may
[45:07] your mercy flow out amongst your people
[45:10] father to bring about the word of god in
[45:12] their lives and father we thank you for
[45:15] that and give praise glory and honor to
[45:17] you today in the name of jesus christ
[45:20] amen you may be seated
[45:23] once again good to have
[45:25] sister sue
[45:27] who's becoming
[45:28] a world-class commuter
[45:30] amen but it's good to see her in the
[45:33] house of god today
[45:35] amen
[45:36] now
[45:37] i just want to start in here not to
[45:41] go line by line today but just to kind
[45:44] of take this as an overview focus on on
[45:47] a few things
[45:48] the first three verses that we read here
[45:51] uh are uh in a sense show kind of a
[45:54] bleak picture of the unconverted
[45:56] humanity right uh well it shows that how
[45:59] that we
[46:00] uh being lost uh consumed in the lust of
[46:04] the flesh and the power
[46:06] of the spirit of the age that we live in
[46:08] and how it comes upon us and what our
[46:11] conversations were i was just a few days
[46:14] ago i just had a little interaction with
[46:16] some people and it's so interesting my
[46:19] brother and sister and i don't want to
[46:20] focus on this but just to make this it's
[46:22] so interesting how in the age that we
[46:25] live in that a normal conversation can
[46:28] deviate so quickly to something
[46:31] perverted
[46:32] they take a word they take a little
[46:34] something and it's just
[46:36] we used to call them a zinger and they
[46:37] just zing it's just out there all of a
[46:39] sudden so you see that the power of
[46:42] conversation to see how it is in the day
[46:45] that we're living in uh you look at this
[46:48] and realize that this spirit that is
[46:51] here is now brought forth uh in
[46:54] conversation and we know the word of god
[46:56] says it's from the abundance of the
[46:58] heart the mouth speaketh so we see
[47:00] hearts that have become completely uh
[47:03] corrupted as it were
[47:05] been marked black but you know what
[47:07] we'll look at this now there are those
[47:09] my brother and sister in our midst today
[47:11] and i say thank you lord and for our
[47:14] young people i pray that you grow up
[47:16] amen please hear me i pray that you grow
[47:19] up and never have to say i was out here
[47:23] and did this this and this i never have
[47:25] to bear the memory of certain languages
[47:28] and certain behaviors that is the
[47:30] ultimate testimony we have beautiful
[47:32] testimonies in our midst of sinners uh
[47:35] you know in the darkest sense saved by
[47:37] grace but i pray god amen the word
[47:40] promises that to us will rise up a
[47:42] generation unmarked by satan amen and so
[47:46] we just believe for that amen but these
[47:49] first three verses show this picture of
[47:51] uncom
[47:52] converted humanity and um you know their
[47:56] language their thoughts their deeds
[47:58] everything that is there and and uh you
[48:00] know we look at that and think oh my
[48:02] because we we can see just how
[48:05] low that humanity can seek
[48:08] or or sink i mean and you look at this
[48:10] but verse 4 i really wanted to focus you
[48:13] know how many times i've preached here
[48:15] in the church about the word but amen it
[48:18] negates those things in front of it and
[48:20] so while we look at this bleak picture
[48:23] of humanity of which we this morning i
[48:26] believe can say thank you lord we've
[48:27] been delivered right so you know he he
[48:30] actually opens it on a positive note
[48:33] then gives the definitive description of
[48:35] what it is you were quick and from
[48:38] amen oh thank you lord amen we never
[48:40] want to forget that we were sinners
[48:42] saved by grace but that's not our focus
[48:44] and i know there's been times that i
[48:46] have kind of you might say ranted on
[48:48] this and i'll just throw a quick note
[48:50] we're not here to glorify the hole that
[48:53] god drug us out of amen we're here to
[48:55] glorify god so you know to talk about
[48:58] what a great drunk i was and this that
[49:00] and the other i think that's utter
[49:02] nonsense opinion okay is it all right to
[49:04] interject i i don't believe that's
[49:06] anything to be glorified this was my mud
[49:08] hole
[49:09] this was my alley this no it wasn't
[49:13] satan temporarily derailed you
[49:16] and put you in there and god said that's
[49:18] not who you are and that's not where you
[49:20] belong so to you is quicken and we see
[49:24] the symptoms of the spirit and we're
[49:27] going to talk because we're in laodicea
[49:29] the symptoms of laodicea are now given
[49:32] out and laid out very clearly for us
[49:35] amen we can fill in the blanks but god
[49:37] amen oh he negated my brother and sister
[49:41] everything that was previous no longer
[49:44] exists it's done it's wiped away and you
[49:47] know the devil
[49:48] he kept a lot of shorthand notes but
[49:50] they're not applicable or cannot be
[49:52] given to the court because they're ruled
[49:55] inadmissible because the only evidence
[49:57] that matters is the evidence that god
[49:59] has himself and he said i washed you
[50:02] whiter than snow and i look in the book
[50:04] and i see nothing held to your account
[50:07] hallelujah even though the devil will
[50:09] say but but but but i i would nope nope
[50:12] nope sorry satan it don't matter what
[50:14] you said
[50:15] amen because we have a greater witness
[50:18] but god who is rich in mercy for his
[50:21] great love wherewith he loved us now
[50:23] that's so beautiful my brother and
[50:24] sister we can go into predestination we
[50:26] can go into all of the factors that
[50:29] weigh in on humanity and our
[50:30] relationship but the very fact that god
[50:33] loved us
[50:35] that ought to be something that would
[50:37] just hold us every day of our life that
[50:39] we could stop and say no matter what i'm
[50:41] going through
[50:45] god loves me
[50:48] the wheels can fall off the wagon
[50:50] the banker can call you and say you're
[50:52] overdrafted
[50:54] whatever it might come in your life a
[50:56] doctor might say this or that
[50:58] but to stop and say
[51:00] god loves me
[51:02] not a superficial love
[51:04] but a very deep
[51:06] enduring love
[51:08] in fact it endures so long it's called
[51:10] eternity
[51:12] hallelujah
[51:14] amen
[51:15] when we were dead in sins it quickened
[51:17] us together with christ by grace you are
[51:20] saved
[51:21] now as we look at this my brother and
[51:23] sister in verse six this is really the
[51:26] real crux and i kind of took all the you
[51:28] know the
[51:30] newness out of this by mentioning the
[51:32] last few services i've preached but i'm
[51:34] telling you it actually has made me
[51:35] excited something stirring in my heart
[51:38] to realize just how the plan of god it's
[51:41] one thing for god to say i chose you
[51:43] before the foundation of the world but
[51:45] another thing for us to watch it being
[51:47] manifested and coming to pass
[51:50] in me
[51:51] in you
[51:53] there's a beauty to get excited about
[51:55] otherwise we could just all be
[51:57] yeah i'm i'm saved i've been saved a
[51:59] long time there was no earth back when i
[52:01] got saved
[52:03] but we get to see the manifestation
[52:06] we get to see it coming to pass we get
[52:08] to see this whole plan of god where he
[52:11] said you know what i could come once
[52:13] again and i could anoint
[52:16] you know as it were and come down once
[52:18] again as jesus christ in the flesh
[52:22] but you know what i'm going to do
[52:25] as i have put in my word and declared
[52:27] this many membered body
[52:31] that's what i'm going to do i'm not
[52:33] going to prove that i could live sinless
[52:36] i'm going to prove that in the darkest
[52:39] of ages
[52:41] my offspring my dna
[52:44] the life manifested
[52:47] in this right here
[52:51] oh but nobody lives sinless
[52:53] yeah they do actually
[52:56] hallelujah you see the problem is is
[52:58] we're looking through man's eyes
[53:00] and we're trying to determine who we are
[53:02] or who you are through man's eyes but we
[53:06] have to look through the filter of the
[53:08] blood and god laid that out before there
[53:11] ever was a world he said i'm going to
[53:13] filter everything through my precious
[53:15] blood and what can go through that
[53:17] filter my brother and sister i tell you
[53:19] absolutely nothing can go through that
[53:22] filter when it comes to the blood of
[53:24] jesus christ when it is presented and
[53:27] the sacrifice as it is figuratively and
[53:30] literal in the day is laid upon the
[53:32] altar nothing goes beyond that so god
[53:36] said i'm going to come down with a
[53:37] mini-member body and i'm going to have a
[53:40] sinless bride of christ on the earth
[53:43] today and it's there now you say well
[53:46] brother paul's sinless i struggle with
[53:48] that anybody say they can struggle with
[53:49] that
[53:50] i've struggled with it for years my
[53:52] brother and sister how that me you know
[53:55] could be and then one day i realized yep
[53:57] there it is the gift
[54:00] the gift has been given
[54:02] and i'm here to say today that my god is
[54:05] not an indian giver he doesn't give the
[54:07] gift and take it back oh you're naughty
[54:10] today i'm taking my gift away
[54:12] no sir in fact when we fail the gift is
[54:16] then magnified
[54:19] instead of diminished in our failure as
[54:21] it were of the flesh god magnifies it
[54:24] and said here's your refuge oh my son or
[54:27] my daughter or my child here's your
[54:30] refuge
[54:33] oh hallelujah
[54:36] yes sir see you look at this and just
[54:39] realize how beautiful this is now in
[54:42] verse 6
[54:43] he said hath raised us up together
[54:47] and made us sit together
[54:49] in heavenly places
[54:51] in christ jesus
[54:52] now feel free to speak out but what do
[54:54] you notice right off the bat
[54:57] that i would say is not peculiar but
[54:59] peculiar about that verse
[55:03] past tense
[55:06] and plural
[55:11] i have no exclusive right
[55:14] you have no exclusive right
[55:16] and please understand me in this right
[55:18] context the prophet
[55:21] had no exclusive right
[55:23] so people that say that the message
[55:25] certain factions are
[55:27] or pieces of the message certain things
[55:30] were to the prophet alone
[55:32] no no if they say it's to him alone they
[55:36] do not understand the principle of first
[55:38] fruits
[55:39] because the first fruits was an offering
[55:42] for the harvest
[55:43] of the whole field not
[55:45] not not not those
[55:48] that were
[55:50] taken
[55:51] from the field
[55:55] aren't you glad
[55:57] amen i may never in this life have a
[56:00] vision
[56:01] i may never in this life dream as it
[56:04] were a deep spiritual dream
[56:07] i may in this life never discern
[56:10] i do believe by god's grace that we have
[56:12] been a part of seeing spirits cast out i
[56:16] will reach out and take a hold of that
[56:18] i've seen that come to pass but there
[56:20] are certain things that i will probably
[56:22] no doubt never see in my life but did
[56:24] you know saints now i hope you catch
[56:26] this i claim that
[56:28] i have discerned spirits i have cast out
[56:31] demons i have all these things why
[56:34] because i am a part of the harvest of
[56:37] the first fruit amen and so when that
[56:39] was done that wasn't just exclusive for
[56:42] that take it right back to the scripture
[56:44] we'll find that amen otherwise you'd go
[56:46] out and and look look at this now just
[56:49] you know this is what farmers do
[56:52] they look over the corn field
[56:54] they find the best part of the corn
[56:56] field
[56:57] and they figure out what an acre is out
[56:59] in the best part of the corn field and
[57:00] they combine that
[57:02] then they go down to the coffee shop
[57:03] brother trevor and tell everybody we had
[57:06] some 400 bushel corn
[57:10] it was only about the size of the
[57:12] parking lot of our church
[57:14] but we had 400 bushel corn
[57:16] so god didn't go out my brother and
[57:18] sister i hope you follow me he didn't go
[57:20] out and choose just the best
[57:22] amongst us
[57:24] and say these are these promises are for
[57:26] you
[57:29] remember a brother saying you know
[57:32] he said i'd rather die
[57:34] than sing a special
[57:38] and then i i think maybe it's the holy
[57:40] spirit come on him and he says
[57:42] forgive me lord i really didn't mean
[57:44] that
[57:48] you see some are gifted with music
[57:52] praise the lord i'm glad brother jason's
[57:54] sister emmy around to tell me that i'm
[57:55] singing an f
[57:57] because in my whole life f was bad
[58:00] but i'm telling you you know i don't
[58:02] know what f is i can't identify f i'm
[58:05] glad i can just sing
[58:07] i have a quote for that
[58:11] amen
[58:12] if you need that i could supply that to
[58:14] you
[58:15] prophet of god says you should just be
[58:17] happy and give praise to the lord that
[58:18] you can just sing
[58:20] let your praise come to the lord he said
[58:22] you might not be uh oh what is that
[58:28] salami
[58:31] me fossalami look that up you'll find it
[58:34] under that he said you might not be able
[58:36] to sing that
[58:38] but if you've got a voice
[58:40] you can praise god
[58:42] hallelujah thank you lord
[58:44] amen so it's there look at this now i
[58:46] just want to to take just the first part
[58:48] of verse six and we will break this down
[58:51] and he hath raised us up together one
[58:54] past tense his sister dying brought out
[58:56] but it's plural my brother and sister
[58:58] whole church included everyone who wants
[59:00] to be a part of the house can be part of
[59:02] the us today amen he hath raised us up
[59:06] together
[59:08] so it's not just a real spiritual man
[59:11] here real spiritual sister over here but
[59:14] this is a body of believers that the
[59:16] word is coming forth is blessing each
[59:19] and every one of us now i want to take
[59:21] this back to nature my brother and
[59:22] sister you'll find in a wheat field just
[59:25] as you see right here some not so good
[59:29] i shouldn't say good
[59:31] not so
[59:32] uh big and beautiful not so tall not as
[59:34] big a head but still wheat
[59:36] and it still brought forth seed
[59:38] amen and it still can be planted and
[59:41] will reproduce amen do we realize how
[59:44] important that is well i've just said on
[59:46] a pew my whole life never had a position
[59:48] just reproduce just reproduce the life
[59:51] of christ don't try to worry about if
[59:53] your name's going to show up on the
[59:55] headline on on youtube or on the video
[59:58] or or whatever it might be don't worry
[1:00:00] about that just grow and reproduce jesus
[1:00:04] christ
[1:00:05] amen and some grow taller and some will
[1:00:08] be there and you say oh if i could have
[1:00:10] been taller well maybe that wind storm
[1:00:13] right after the rain would have knocked
[1:00:14] you flat if you were too tall
[1:00:19] so thank the lord
[1:00:20] but some of this might have been in the
[1:00:22] worst soil
[1:00:24] on the farm wait
[1:00:26] might have been in the worst nation or
[1:00:27] the worst city under the worst this or
[1:00:29] the worst that oh i was raised up in a
[1:00:31] message church and it was a mouse and
[1:00:33] and oh oh oh but you are here and you're
[1:00:36] producing seed
[1:00:37] and god's not going to say well because
[1:00:39] you didn't you know we take it back to
[1:00:41] scripture you know some produce 50 and
[1:00:43] 78 whatever 100 and people get all
[1:00:46] caught up in that but my brother and
[1:00:47] sister the important thing is that you
[1:00:50] produce
[1:00:52] when the seed is come a barren hall
[1:00:57] bringeth no profit
[1:01:02] empty just husk
[1:01:07] the prophet of god says i actually have
[1:01:08] nothing against denomination
[1:01:12] sometimes we get around the message that
[1:01:13] went denomination prophet of god said no
[1:01:18] nothing wrong with denomination that's
[1:01:19] just a matter of putting things in a
[1:01:21] certain order
[1:01:24] but it's a spirit
[1:01:27] just like he talked about rock and roll
[1:01:28] young people
[1:01:30] you say well okay okay isn't that a cute
[1:01:32] little song spirit behind that song
[1:01:35] and even some of this contemporary
[1:01:36] christian music we have now
[1:01:39] everybody's like oh isn't that wonderful
[1:01:43] spirit behind that
[1:01:45] now the real question you see because i
[1:01:48] i'm really been on a bent lately about
[1:01:50] not telling you what to do but
[1:01:53] please
[1:01:54] go check out that spirit
[1:01:56] shine the light very clearly on that
[1:01:58] spirit and see what that is about that
[1:02:00] spirit my brother and sister a lot of
[1:02:02] the songs that are being sung in what we
[1:02:05] call contemporary christian music today
[1:02:08] are actually empty
[1:02:10] they could be sung to the devil just as
[1:02:13] easily as they could to jesus christ
[1:02:16] in fact they are
[1:02:20] and the reason i say that is because the
[1:02:22] songs are not producing
[1:02:24] anything
[1:02:25] of a real christian nature
[1:02:29] so you look at this see we have to know
[1:02:32] who we believe in we have to have a firm
[1:02:35] foundation of where we stand because
[1:02:38] when the wind blows my brother and
[1:02:39] sister it will destroy everything that
[1:02:42] is not truly anchored
[1:02:44] amen now look at this he has to raise us
[1:02:48] up together now the word raised there's
[1:02:50] there's several different ways it
[1:02:52] applies and i have to be honest with you
[1:02:54] uh when it starts getting into all of
[1:02:56] this adjective and all these other
[1:02:58] little sub things i kind of get lost
[1:03:01] never did figure it out in the beginning
[1:03:02] still haven't figured it out but it's
[1:03:04] all right i'll still make the rapture
[1:03:07] amen
[1:03:08] but look at this now raised
[1:03:11] is elevated
[1:03:14] so he hath elevated us up together now
[1:03:18] look at this and if i can just have this
[1:03:20] liberty this morning you see
[1:03:23] we're not of this earth my brother and
[1:03:24] sister we're not of the spirit of the
[1:03:26] age i just read a little deal the other
[1:03:28] day this guy mocking the whole idea that
[1:03:31] there would be a god of this age
[1:03:35] well i'm telling you my brother and
[1:03:36] sister if that guy ever pulls his head
[1:03:38] out of the sand he's going to be shocked
[1:03:41] because if you can't look at this now
[1:03:44] this happened many years ago but sister
[1:03:46] jerry and i was traveling to chile some
[1:03:49] and we were traveling off to some remote
[1:03:51] or smaller churches and little villages
[1:03:53] and whatnot and you know in my mind
[1:03:56] in my mind i thought you know we're just
[1:03:59] like the brothers have driven us for
[1:04:01] hours and we're just out here in nowhere
[1:04:03] and uh you know it's going to be
[1:04:05] different
[1:04:07] you get out of the car
[1:04:09] and it's like it's not different
[1:04:12] we're in the middle of nowhere south
[1:04:14] america and the exact same spirits and
[1:04:16] clothing and music and attitudes is all
[1:04:19] there
[1:04:20] now if that is not my brother and sister
[1:04:23] this spirit or the holy spirit we'll put
[1:04:25] it that way the spirit of god if that's
[1:04:27] not the spirit of god then it's going to
[1:04:28] be a spirit
[1:04:30] and so if you go on the earth today and
[1:04:33] drive from town to town town to town
[1:04:35] town to town nation to nation nation and
[1:04:37] nation
[1:04:38] will you find the majority
[1:04:40] of the reflection of jesus christ where
[1:04:42] you could walk into a store and say my
[1:04:44] goodness this looks like a whole store
[1:04:46] full of believers
[1:04:50] no but you can walk in that store and
[1:04:51] you'll know what the whole store
[1:04:52] believes in
[1:04:54] because there is a god
[1:04:56] of this evil age
[1:04:59] regardless of what the critics might say
[1:05:03] men making boasts of i was in the
[1:05:05] message for 45 years and i no longer
[1:05:08] believe it my apologies
[1:05:13] because something was missing
[1:05:16] no foundation
[1:05:18] i'm sorry
[1:05:21] so something was raised here hath raised
[1:05:24] us up has elevated us up together now we
[1:05:28] have to find the right balance my
[1:05:29] brother and sister in the flesh often
[1:05:32] times when a man is raised up you'll see
[1:05:35] that whether it be in sports politics
[1:05:38] church whatever
[1:05:40] largely when we see men raised up then
[1:05:43] you will see that these men have a
[1:05:46] tendency to start looking to self
[1:05:48] they start to say well and let's just
[1:05:51] bring it home to church and sometimes
[1:05:53] now have mercy don't be quick to judge
[1:05:56] sometimes you have to discern between
[1:05:58] it's just a human nature to say i prayed
[1:06:00] for this person and god delivered them
[1:06:02] or i prayed for this person and god
[1:06:04] healed them you need to know the
[1:06:06] character of the person saying that
[1:06:08] because in some cases it's just us
[1:06:10] speaking the hand you know as it would
[1:06:11] be you know you lay hands on somebody
[1:06:13] and you saw the result and you say i
[1:06:15] prayed for them you're actually speaking
[1:06:17] fact but there's another realm over here
[1:06:20] that when man has been lifted up they
[1:06:22] start to believe they were the only
[1:06:25] conduit by which that person could
[1:06:27] receive deliverance or healing they're
[1:06:29] the only conduit which god has to bring
[1:06:32] revelation into the church and my
[1:06:34] brother and sister you'll find that when
[1:06:36] man gets raised up in that way god has a
[1:06:39] certain obligation i guess you would say
[1:06:41] to
[1:06:42] knock them off of their pedestal
[1:06:44] and times i've said this through the
[1:06:46] years and i'll just toss this in real
[1:06:48] quick but my brother and sister i've
[1:06:50] spoke this in this church many times as
[1:06:52] we have dealt with issues but you see
[1:06:54] this church will never become a
[1:06:57] nicolaitan church right the ministry
[1:07:00] dominating the people
[1:07:03] unless you allow it
[1:07:06] so if you stand up for your god-given
[1:07:08] rights as a believer of the word of god
[1:07:11] and have the courage to say that ain't
[1:07:14] so we're not knuckling under we're not
[1:07:16] becoming subservient
[1:07:18] because pastor you taught us that we
[1:07:22] were raised up
[1:07:23] together
[1:07:25] so we're not your minions we're not your
[1:07:28] servants
[1:07:30] but then obviously as the word and the
[1:07:33] prophet showed us we give honor we're
[1:07:35] honors do
[1:07:36] in fact brother branham covered it well
[1:07:37] enough if you can't respect the man in
[1:07:39] the office at least respect the office
[1:07:42] so we get a balance to this right saints
[1:07:44] so we see how it is of the age that
[1:07:47] we're living in when men start to be
[1:07:50] lifted up uh they start to look to
[1:07:52] themselves and then the second half of
[1:07:55] that they start to look out for
[1:07:57] themselves
[1:08:01] give you a quick story
[1:08:03] two different men that i know
[1:08:06] one said well
[1:08:08] we'll take all
[1:08:10] we can take meaning of the resources of
[1:08:13] the church because i have no retirement
[1:08:17] another one saying
[1:08:19] my wife and i have poured our hearts and
[1:08:21] lives out for 40 years
[1:08:24] to the body believers
[1:08:27] we have no retirement
[1:08:29] but the lord promised
[1:08:31] he would take care of us
[1:08:34] i could name names if i was so inclined
[1:08:36] right now in
[1:08:38] their church
[1:08:39] as a new pastor life has went on under a
[1:08:41] new ministry a little more dynamic
[1:08:44] younger man there's young families have
[1:08:46] kind of come in
[1:08:47] and if i ever get to the point that you
[1:08:49] all want to leave
[1:08:51] before you all leave maybe we can talk
[1:08:53] about having a successor
[1:08:58] but this brother and sister had nothing
[1:09:01] and he's no longer pastor
[1:09:06] and the church said
[1:09:09] brother and sister so and so
[1:09:11] have given this assembly
[1:09:14] in this city
[1:09:15] 40 years of their life
[1:09:19] will
[1:09:21] take care of them
[1:09:25] see the difference
[1:09:27] one
[1:09:28] was looking out for self
[1:09:30] the other one said god will take care of
[1:09:33] me
[1:09:34] so you see when we become lifted up we
[1:09:37] start to have a tendency of
[1:09:39] what is best for me
[1:09:43] it's not really god's plan is it
[1:09:46] he said he'd be our provider we're
[1:09:47] actually telling him i'm not sure your
[1:09:49] program works lord so i'm going to kind
[1:09:51] of second it here to make sure
[1:09:54] but you look at this now this tendency
[1:09:57] to look to self
[1:09:58] uh this is why saints if i can interject
[1:10:01] this i've got several interjections here
[1:10:02] this morning
[1:10:04] that's why i try to share with you when
[1:10:06] i have an opinion with i have something
[1:10:08] i can't you see i believe in preaching a
[1:10:10] defensible gospel and what i mean by
[1:10:12] defensible is if you can do it's like
[1:10:15] right here
[1:10:16] then i don't have to interpret yet
[1:10:18] there's things that we read the
[1:10:20] scripture and i think you would say amen
[1:10:21] to this that we we are have a i'm going
[1:10:25] to use the word feeling but i'm not
[1:10:26] talking about a human feeling and we're
[1:10:28] like i believe this is where the word is
[1:10:30] conveying to me you know i believe this
[1:10:32] is as a word between the lines and and i
[1:10:35] believe this is what it is and you know
[1:10:37] what i i like to identify that as
[1:10:39] opinion right because then if we differ
[1:10:41] we don't have to get a big argument
[1:10:43] split the church and start three or four
[1:10:44] and
[1:10:45] you know
[1:10:47] because we don't always see everything
[1:10:49] exactly alike
[1:10:52] but if we have true revelation there is
[1:10:54] only
[1:10:55] one revelation of jesus christ only one
[1:10:59] not two not three
[1:11:01] so now when we're raised up in christ i
[1:11:03] want to just keep moving along
[1:11:05] when we are raised up in christ
[1:11:08] the importance of the flesh
[1:11:10] is largely set aside
[1:11:13] now remember i said largely because you
[1:11:15] see we're called to be good stewards of
[1:11:17] this body of this flesh and the gifts
[1:11:19] that god has given us so you don't you
[1:11:21] don't just throw it apart and literally
[1:11:22] say well if god wants it to happen it'll
[1:11:24] happen my brother and sister you can lay
[1:11:26] in bed and never ask for prayer
[1:11:31] when the body of believers would love to
[1:11:33] pray for you
[1:11:34] and it's no sign of less faith
[1:11:37] it's actually a sign of stepping away
[1:11:39] from your own self
[1:11:41] and saying wait we're raised up together
[1:11:43] we're a body of believers
[1:11:46] now if the right hand wants to help the
[1:11:48] left hand
[1:11:52] hmm i don't want to elaborate because it
[1:11:55] takes too much time
[1:11:57] but you see the importance of the flesh
[1:11:58] is set to the side and the spirit man is
[1:12:01] then moved into the position of
[1:12:03] importance now look i'm just going to
[1:12:05] speak this as though i'm speaking just
[1:12:06] to a crowd of people i don't know but if
[1:12:08] you are more worried about your life
[1:12:11] which means house money jobs etc then of
[1:12:14] the word of god and being in the house
[1:12:17] of god to fulfill the word of god you're
[1:12:19] looking to the flesh
[1:12:21] you're looking to that flesh man and the
[1:12:23] spirit man is not ruling because the
[1:12:25] spirit man wants to be fed amen when
[1:12:28] jonathan there was hungry and i i don't
[1:12:31] know may we'll preach on this at some
[1:12:32] point but when jonathan was there and
[1:12:34] was hungry and he looked out there and
[1:12:37] he saw that honey he didn't say well i i
[1:12:41] you know
[1:12:42] he gave into something deeper
[1:12:45] and he said i need
[1:12:47] i need a bite of honey i need something
[1:12:50] and i'll tell you my brother and sister
[1:12:51] i'll put this out there like this god
[1:12:53] never called sons and daughters of god
[1:12:55] to live in this present world and spite
[1:12:58] this fight this spiritual fight hungry
[1:13:01] he wants you to be well fed because it's
[1:13:03] when you're well fed on the word of god
[1:13:06] that you have strength to fight the
[1:13:09] enemy and strength to deep dig into the
[1:13:11] word of god this should not be a starved
[1:13:15] church in this message
[1:13:19] but having said that let me reiterate it
[1:13:21] with this people say well i don't know
[1:13:23] i'm not going to go to that church any
[1:13:24] longer
[1:13:25] it doesn't feed me
[1:13:28] we feed babies
[1:13:31] adults
[1:13:32] feed themselves
[1:13:35] so if you need someone
[1:13:38] to as it were ladle out the word to you
[1:13:42] i'm sorry but as paul spoke to them says
[1:13:45] your babes you can't i had to just give
[1:13:47] you milk i couldn't give you meat
[1:13:49] see the balance in this
[1:13:51] amen was paul lifted up in his thinking
[1:13:53] no he wasn't he was actually laying the
[1:13:55] groundwork there comes a season for us
[1:13:57] as true believers to start saying
[1:14:00] there's honey i'm eating it
[1:14:02] amen now jonathan
[1:14:04] amen there's a whole story behind that
[1:14:07] he was man enough to admit i ate some
[1:14:09] honey
[1:14:10] his own dad says you got to die
[1:14:13] the people said whoa
[1:14:14] it's because of jonathan god come on the
[1:14:16] scene today
[1:14:18] there's no way we're letting a hair of
[1:14:20] his head see saul was backslidden
[1:14:22] preacher
[1:14:23] he wanted the church to do what he
[1:14:25] wanted the church to do and he wanted to
[1:14:27] dole out the word to the people
[1:14:30] according to what he thought they needed
[1:14:32] but god says you know what i'm going to
[1:14:34] do i'm going to put some honey out here
[1:14:36] and i'm going to anoint jonathan to eat
[1:14:37] that and under that anointing jonathan's
[1:14:39] be able to go forward and there's
[1:14:41] inspiration read the story jonathan had
[1:14:44] inspiration when he got that honey
[1:14:46] amen that was well we'll put it as
[1:14:48] revelation
[1:14:49] amen and so something happened to
[1:14:51] jonathan in that moment and he knew
[1:14:54] there was something special about that
[1:14:55] he knew god was present
[1:14:59] so having said what i said let me
[1:15:01] back up on myself it might seem like i'm
[1:15:03] countering this
[1:15:07] there's no reason no excuse for you to
[1:15:08] starve to death
[1:15:11] at the same token i encourage you to go
[1:15:13] to a church
[1:15:15] that wants to have a buffet for you
[1:15:18] not a starvation diet
[1:15:22] yeah
[1:15:25] well let me put it this way
[1:15:26] i hope i don't get too far down the
[1:15:28] human element for you
[1:15:29] but science has proved nutrition
[1:15:32] that if you try to starve yourself
[1:15:35] your body
[1:15:36] starts to
[1:15:37] digest itself
[1:15:41] and you know what it digests first
[1:15:43] not fat
[1:15:45] muscle
[1:15:47] so the very strength you need to live in
[1:15:50] laodicea is the first thing a spiritual
[1:15:53] starvation diet takes away from you
[1:15:58] that's why you should eat a well-rounded
[1:16:00] diet of the right proportions of the
[1:16:03] right ingredients
[1:16:04] that your body can say all is well
[1:16:08] we have heard the message shalom
[1:16:11] all
[1:16:12] is well
[1:16:13] and let me say that all is well my
[1:16:15] brother and sister sometimes you know
[1:16:17] we have children we have one that is not
[1:16:20] serving the lord and we get to the place
[1:16:22] that we have two roads that we must take
[1:16:24] and those two roads are such that we
[1:16:27] have to decide we compromise so our
[1:16:29] children will still love us and and try
[1:16:32] to you know spoon feed a little
[1:16:34] something or we come over here and say
[1:16:36] what i believe i know in whom i believe
[1:16:40] i know what i believe and while i love
[1:16:43] you and i will not cram it down your
[1:16:45] throat
[1:16:46] don't forget
[1:16:49] i know whom i believe
[1:16:52] i'm not going to waffle
[1:16:54] i'm not going to compromise i'm not
[1:16:56] going to try and sugarcoat it
[1:17:00] heard a man say once as he dropped his
[1:17:02] cupcake on the ground
[1:17:04] picked it up with
[1:17:06] dirt all over the frosting
[1:17:09] he said well
[1:17:10] i believe
[1:17:11] this mostly was made out of dirt in the
[1:17:13] beginning and almost everything is good
[1:17:15] with frosting
[1:17:22] let's just tell it like it is
[1:17:25] so the prophet encourages just tell it
[1:17:27] like it is you have a relationship with
[1:17:29] the lord you have received the holy
[1:17:31] ghost you are standing in the revelated
[1:17:33] word of the hour don't move right or
[1:17:35] left for that but don't cram it down
[1:17:37] someone's throat
[1:17:39] don't apologize for it live it amen
[1:17:44] amen so
[1:17:46] look when we largely set the the flesh
[1:17:49] or the the carnal man aside the spirit
[1:17:52] man moves into the position of
[1:17:54] importance and when spiritual things are
[1:17:56] elevated saints
[1:18:00] what happens
[1:18:03] god starts answering prayer
[1:18:05] the word of god comes alive to us
[1:18:08] and we actually find ourselves
[1:18:12] never a disagreement
[1:18:14] we're living in bliss we're all happy
[1:18:24] there's times like that
[1:18:28] there's days like that
[1:18:30] but i'll tell you i'm not putting sister
[1:18:32] jerry night under the bus because i
[1:18:33] think you guys have to identify with me
[1:18:36] but you can have all the positions of
[1:18:38] humanity in one day
[1:18:43] yeah
[1:18:45] yes sir come on saints
[1:18:47] you can argue with the wife you can be
[1:18:49] upset at the children you can be
[1:18:52] praising the lord for prayers answered
[1:18:54] you can shout hallelujah from something
[1:18:56] you never saw before in the word of god
[1:18:58] and before the day is over you can snip
[1:19:00] at the wife
[1:19:07] and then in devotions
[1:19:09] or at the dinner table find yourself
[1:19:11] with tears running down your cheek as
[1:19:12] you say lord forgive us
[1:19:15] amen
[1:19:16] you see this heavenly places my brother
[1:19:18] and sister is some not some carnal place
[1:19:21] of bliss
[1:19:22] it is a spiritual position and when we
[1:19:26] come in that spiritual position amen we
[1:19:29] start to see that you know what when i
[1:19:31] elevate the spiritual man these things
[1:19:34] of this life here tend to diminish and
[1:19:37] go away and even though the spirit of
[1:19:39] antagonism might come in we might start
[1:19:42] to say well
[1:19:44] yeah
[1:19:44] anyway satan
[1:19:46] get out of the house
[1:19:48] you know
[1:19:49] amen
[1:19:52] kind of like the cat you know
[1:19:55] don't look sister nadia
[1:19:57] but kind of like the cat
[1:19:58] [Music]
[1:20:02] not in this house
[1:20:05] now the devil my brother and sister
[1:20:06] would like to hang on the screen door
[1:20:08] and squall all the time
[1:20:10] but look when the spirit man has moved
[1:20:12] into this position
[1:20:13] amen these things change as the song
[1:20:15] says what a difference
[1:20:17] it makes when the lord has his way can
[1:20:20] someone say you know what i'm talking
[1:20:22] about
[1:20:23] amen when we put god in that position
[1:20:26] and we realize you know what the lord's
[1:20:29] in control
[1:20:30] the the atmosphere changes our
[1:20:32] motivations change and and we see our
[1:20:36] response to the even the cares of this
[1:20:38] life would you guys pray for snow or
[1:20:40] rain
[1:20:43] i need you all to pray a lot for snow or
[1:20:45] rain
[1:20:46] i was joking with
[1:20:48] i think that was
[1:20:49] brother alex yesterday i was joking i
[1:20:51] said if something don't change you're
[1:20:52] going to have a
[1:20:54] unemployed
[1:20:56] man
[1:20:57] who will just have to maybe become a
[1:20:58] full-time pastor i'll be out here
[1:21:00] sweeping the cracks in the parking lot
[1:21:05] but you see that will either dominate me
[1:21:09] or i'll look at it and say prayer
[1:21:10] changes things and lord thy will be done
[1:21:15] thy will be done
[1:21:17] you see the self-absorbed man or woman
[1:21:19] says lord my will be done
[1:21:22] but the man who's given it over to a
[1:21:24] spiritual position because he knows in
[1:21:27] whom he believes
[1:21:28] and says i can just give this over to
[1:21:31] the lord and let go of this and he'll
[1:21:33] take care of it
[1:21:35] he'll take care of it
[1:21:36] now look
[1:21:37] he raised us up together
[1:21:40] and made us to sit together in heavenly
[1:21:43] places i tell you i want heavenly places
[1:21:46] i want that atmosphere of my life to be
[1:21:48] in heavenly places and as i have kind of
[1:21:51] spilled the beans a time or two in
[1:21:52] previous services but my brother and
[1:21:54] sister once again just to use this
[1:21:56] simple analogy when god makes us he
[1:21:58] doesn't throw us in a headlock he
[1:22:00] doesn't tie us up he doesn't put
[1:22:02] handcuffs on and drag us god does not
[1:22:05] make us in that fashion but when he
[1:22:08] makes us amen he made us
[1:22:12] to sit together
[1:22:14] once again what god's making me do he's
[1:22:17] making you do and vice versa it is not
[1:22:20] one person that he says well i'll make
[1:22:22] an example out of you my brother and
[1:22:24] sister god has a body of believers and
[1:22:28] all the way to north south east west
[1:22:30] whatever continent whatever country
[1:22:32] whatever circumstance
[1:22:38] god's in control amen
[1:22:44] and he made us
[1:22:46] now look at this word made it's very
[1:22:47] interesting
[1:22:49] now the way it was broke out in the
[1:22:51] definition i'm going to take it from
[1:22:53] bottom to top
[1:22:54] just to fit my thought
[1:22:57] it denotes
[1:22:58] a certain degree
[1:22:59] of force
[1:23:01] so if we was to apply that
[1:23:04] in just a regular definition
[1:23:07] that would be the point where you are
[1:23:09] forced to serve god
[1:23:12] forced to repent from your sins forced
[1:23:16] to read your bible and pray forced
[1:23:20] but you see that's not the god we serve
[1:23:22] is it
[1:23:23] and we can say that today because we
[1:23:25] know in whom we believe
[1:23:27] we are not just wondering is this my
[1:23:29] brother and sister i got a lot of good
[1:23:31] friends and there are different
[1:23:33] denominations different things a lot of
[1:23:35] friends that are catholic and my brother
[1:23:37] and sister you'd be shocked that they
[1:23:39] don't even understand why they just know
[1:23:41] their priest told them do this do this
[1:23:43] do this and they've never even dug deep
[1:23:45] enough to know why they do those things
[1:23:47] they don't know what it reflects in
[1:23:49] their spiritual walk but they are told
[1:23:51] you'll be a good christian if you do
[1:23:54] this and if they languish a little bit
[1:23:56] on that then it comes down to the point
[1:23:59] do it or else
[1:24:03] now my brother and sister that's force
[1:24:06] that's right right there where that's at
[1:24:09] in the context of what we're thinking of
[1:24:11] being made
[1:24:14] but god didn't do that
[1:24:15] god come along and says you know what
[1:24:17] i'm going to do i'm going to make
[1:24:19] or made you see those two words actually
[1:24:21] are tied directly together
[1:24:23] so you look at that i'm going to make a
[1:24:25] people
[1:24:26] who are such a people
[1:24:29] that when they see my word they're
[1:24:31] attracted to it there's nothing
[1:24:33] repulsive about the word to them and
[1:24:35] they're actually attracted to it and as
[1:24:37] i have shared with you the last few
[1:24:38] services there's something after they
[1:24:40] take a bite of the word that they find
[1:24:42] it irresistible and they just have to go
[1:24:44] back to the word and they go back to the
[1:24:46] word and they go back to the word and
[1:24:48] that word is enough it splits families
[1:24:50] it splits churches it splits
[1:24:52] relationships and friendships and all of
[1:24:55] these kind of things it's that powerful
[1:24:57] and people think oh they got involved
[1:24:59] with that and it made them do that no
[1:25:01] you missed it my brother and sister it's
[1:25:03] right here in the word it's not any man
[1:25:06] right we're mature enough to move beyond
[1:25:08] the man
[1:25:09] and we're moving into a position of the
[1:25:11] holy spirit moving on us which as the
[1:25:14] prophet said in godhead and you know
[1:25:15] this but the holy spirit is god himself
[1:25:20] and so it's god himself is moving us to
[1:25:24] make decisions and stand behind them
[1:25:26] that in this flesh we could never do it
[1:25:29] we would never have the courage to do it
[1:25:32] in this flesh but god moving deep down
[1:25:34] into the heart and soul there's so many
[1:25:36] quotes i could just read quote after
[1:25:38] quote after quote to you concerning
[1:25:40] these things but it's taken a holds of
[1:25:42] the man and god did not do it by force
[1:25:45] my brother and sister in fact we'll just
[1:25:47] look right here in just a second here in
[1:25:50] the cis
[1:25:52] in leadership
[1:25:53] sorry i'm just all over the board my
[1:25:54] mind just racing off like oh get out
[1:25:57] in in leadership
[1:25:59] each one of us has to make a choice
[1:26:02] you know that's the way i like it
[1:26:08] because if i'm your boss you're not
[1:26:09] going to like it
[1:26:12] and if you're my boss i'm not going to
[1:26:13] like it
[1:26:16] but that that's deep down in the soul
[1:26:19] when god says your life needs to change
[1:26:23] we don't tell them that's your opinion
[1:26:26] we're real believers
[1:26:28] and when the holy spirit through the
[1:26:30] word moves upon us and says your life
[1:26:32] needs to change we say amen
[1:26:36] it's a make-believer and the unbeliever
[1:26:37] that says well i'm going to question
[1:26:39] that
[1:26:40] in fact i'm going to go spend four years
[1:26:42] in the university and learn aramaic so i
[1:26:44] can see if you're telling me the truth
[1:26:46] well i thank the lord for that because i
[1:26:48] might not ever make it to the status of
[1:26:50] true believer if that is a qualification
[1:26:53] but i tell you what when the holy spirit
[1:26:55] comes down in the soul and says you know
[1:26:58] what that is my word and something
[1:27:01] inside of you says amen
[1:27:03] amen thank you lord thank you lord is it
[1:27:06] always easy no i'm telling you i've
[1:27:08] cried bitter tears
[1:27:10] be gone sometimes two three four weeks
[1:27:12] at a time in the semi
[1:27:14] i look back in those years and i think
[1:27:16] man why'd i waste my time doing that and
[1:27:18] a little reminder says wait that's the
[1:27:20] times god dealt with me the most
[1:27:23] i was homesick
[1:27:25] okay i'll admit it i'm spoiled rotten
[1:27:29] i like being
[1:27:30] home i like the wife
[1:27:35] taking care of me
[1:27:38] there it's out it's public
[1:27:43] but you see god knows what he's doing
[1:27:46] each one of us has to make a choice and
[1:27:48] it's confronted to us
[1:27:51] but we're all confronted with this one
[1:27:53] thing
[1:27:54] what are we going to do about eternal
[1:27:56] life
[1:27:57] see it comes down to this deal what are
[1:27:59] we going to do do i choose the god of
[1:28:01] this evil age and he's going to offer me
[1:28:03] a lot i could actually probably be rich
[1:28:04] by now yeah
[1:28:06] that's it
[1:28:08] or
[1:28:10] as it were figuratively sell all the
[1:28:12] house and follow me
[1:28:16] going back here again a little redundant
[1:28:18] in the memories but look israel they
[1:28:20] come and said wait we don't want to go
[1:28:22] across the river because this is the
[1:28:23] land of grass and we're cattle people
[1:28:25] and joshua tells them you'll either
[1:28:28] cross the river
[1:28:30] see
[1:28:30] getting the holy ghost is what seals the
[1:28:33] inheritance
[1:28:34] so
[1:28:35] as it were they would be no different
[1:28:37] than those who refused to move forward
[1:28:39] from kadesh barnea if they didn't cross
[1:28:41] the river
[1:28:42] so that is the message believer who does
[1:28:45] not press into receiving the holy ghost
[1:28:47] but knows the message intellectually he
[1:28:50] never crossed over because once you
[1:28:52] cross over god says i recognize to you
[1:28:54] guys you think god didn't know that was
[1:28:56] a land of grass
[1:28:58] you think god's like
[1:28:59] i never knew that
[1:29:02] so you guys actually want to go back
[1:29:03] across the river now and claim that as
[1:29:05] part of your inheritance and run catalan
[1:29:08] i never ever knew that that was a land
[1:29:09] of grass
[1:29:11] no sir he knew exactly where it was at
[1:29:13] and he anointed joshua to be that mean
[1:29:16] preacher look at this saints to be that
[1:29:18] mean preacher that told you if you don't
[1:29:20] get the holy ghost you can go to church
[1:29:22] and believe this message intellectually
[1:29:24] all of your life but if you don't cross
[1:29:27] over the river receive the inheritance
[1:29:30] i'll let you go back and build a nice
[1:29:32] business live in a nice house have money
[1:29:34] in a savings account take vacations
[1:29:37] enjoy these things of life
[1:29:39] but you better get across the river
[1:29:41] first
[1:29:42] because all of this won't mean nothing
[1:29:44] oh god blessed me with this mansion my
[1:29:46] multi-million dollar business he blessed
[1:29:47] me with this bless me with that without
[1:29:49] the holy ghost my brother and sister it
[1:29:50] all goes up in smoke
[1:29:53] hallelujah
[1:29:56] we're going to live here after or not
[1:30:01] i won't name the name of the religion
[1:30:03] but one of the major religions has now
[1:30:05] revised its standard of belief
[1:30:08] and they've decided that whether there's
[1:30:09] heaven or hell is too complicated so
[1:30:11] they're just going to eliminate that
[1:30:13] from their teaching
[1:30:16] praise the lord
[1:30:18] you know what they've got
[1:30:20] follow the church
[1:30:22] and you'll be okay
[1:30:26] because i'm concerned about my soul and
[1:30:27] i trust every one of you are concerned
[1:30:29] about your soul we want to raise
[1:30:30] children that believe that it's
[1:30:33] important to know where our soul is
[1:30:34] going
[1:30:36] now i want to quantify this i've got to
[1:30:37] hurry along amen
[1:30:40] we're going to live here after or not
[1:30:42] then we have to come to jesus to get
[1:30:44] that the opportunity of choosing that's
[1:30:46] one thing god gave us he don't force
[1:30:49] nothing
[1:30:51] on us
[1:30:55] nothing
[1:30:58] you see why i approach you as a church
[1:31:01] the way i do
[1:31:03] we could preach this in such a factor of
[1:31:05] you this and you this and you god of
[1:31:07] this and you god of that
[1:31:09] but you see
[1:31:10] i'll get ahead of myself a little bit by
[1:31:13] the interjection
[1:31:14] of fear
[1:31:17] over time you can cause people to do
[1:31:19] almost anything
[1:31:23] but how about
[1:31:25] i'm not touting myself but how about a
[1:31:27] pastor has so much confidence in you
[1:31:30] that i believe by the holy ghost
[1:31:32] leadership
[1:31:34] you'll make the right decision
[1:31:36] that you'll do what it takes to feed
[1:31:38] your soul and secure your position in
[1:31:40] the kingdom that you by revelation and
[1:31:42] prayer and the opening of the word would
[1:31:44] be able to say this is the right way to
[1:31:46] go the map says turn here the map says
[1:31:49] stop here and i can believe this map
[1:31:51] because it's been revealed to me
[1:31:54] you see
[1:31:56] we have to have the opportunity of
[1:31:58] choosing
[1:31:59] that's one thing god gave us he don't
[1:32:00] force nothing on us
[1:32:03] he just lets us make our own choice
[1:32:06] so you have to not be forced but just
[1:32:09] make your own choice
[1:32:10] now look some of you might be saying
[1:32:12] what but i know a quote
[1:32:14] or two or three or four
[1:32:16] or brother branham speaks a little
[1:32:18] different
[1:32:21] well
[1:32:22] let's just go back in our thought
[1:32:27] he's going to
[1:32:28] make us
[1:32:29] right we're made to sit in heavenly
[1:32:33] places
[1:32:36] let's go to the rest of the definition
[1:32:38] of made
[1:32:40] used to say
[1:32:43] that someone
[1:32:45] has the right qualities to be
[1:32:47] or to do
[1:32:50] used to say that
[1:32:52] something has the right qualities for or
[1:32:56] to do something
[1:32:59] you see how god made you into a believer
[1:33:03] not by some
[1:33:04] headwrenching arm twisting
[1:33:07] he made you
[1:33:09] he made you with such a quality that
[1:33:12] when you heard the word there was
[1:33:14] something inside of you said that's who
[1:33:16] i am
[1:33:18] and as the brother branham lays out the
[1:33:19] little story about the little eaglet
[1:33:21] that was hatched amen it just thought it
[1:33:24] was an oddball but the day it heard the
[1:33:27] voice of its mother and said that is not
[1:33:30] a chicken clutter that's something i
[1:33:34] understand
[1:33:36] and that little that little eaglet
[1:33:39] was there
[1:33:41] now the part that brother branham i
[1:33:42] think he talks about him clucking and
[1:33:44] whatnot but he doesn't really emphasize
[1:33:46] it as far as i know
[1:33:48] but i personally want to represent it to
[1:33:50] you today that when that mother eagle
[1:33:52] flew over chickens are scared of eagles
[1:33:57] yes sir
[1:33:59] i tell you what look around our house
[1:34:00] when the big old hawks move into the
[1:34:02] tree by our house and you will see the
[1:34:04] cats they'll be slinking the house is
[1:34:06] right here and they'll be slinking along
[1:34:08] that hawks up there in the tree and it's
[1:34:10] talking to them tell them you're my
[1:34:12] lunch
[1:34:13] you're my lunch i ever catch you out in
[1:34:14] the open your lunch
[1:34:18] them chickens was there
[1:34:20] they see that eagle up there
[1:34:22] that little eagle that's up there going
[1:34:23] huh
[1:34:24] what's that
[1:34:25] and mama chicken
[1:34:28] get back in the church get in the church
[1:34:30] repeat the creed get back on the church
[1:34:32] come on get in here get in here
[1:34:37] and this little guy's like
[1:34:40] i just heard someone tell me come up a
[1:34:42] little higher
[1:34:44] i just heard someone tell me put my
[1:34:46] wings out
[1:34:48] and and fly
[1:34:50] but i've never been told to fly before
[1:34:53] i've never been told i'm being
[1:34:57] told to go and hide in the chicken house
[1:35:00] because my church will save me
[1:35:03] but here's an eagle
[1:35:06] wait
[1:35:06] that's not just an eagle
[1:35:09] what am i hearing
[1:35:12] my son
[1:35:14] my son
[1:35:16] you were lost but now you're found my
[1:35:19] son
[1:35:21] come
[1:35:22] it's like i understand that amen
[1:35:25] amen i always wondered who i was i
[1:35:28] didn't fit here what is this i'm called
[1:35:30] to go up a little higher well i'm
[1:35:32] actually i'm afraid to get into heavenly
[1:35:35] places
[1:35:36] i've never been there before
[1:35:39] what's brother brown tell them that
[1:35:40] little eagle he hops up on the fence
[1:35:43] post
[1:35:44] oh my
[1:35:46] as a believer of this message if all the
[1:35:48] higher you can get is a fence post then
[1:35:49] you ought to not even try
[1:35:53] no sir it doesn't fit does it
[1:35:57] get on the fence post
[1:36:00] then there's no none of that whatever to
[1:36:02] get on your wings and you can actually
[1:36:04] start
[1:36:06] come on those of you
[1:36:08] oh i hope this doesn't hurt your
[1:36:09] feelings those of you that won't lift a
[1:36:11] hand in church need to get off the
[1:36:13] ground and at least get on a fence post
[1:36:15] and once you're on that fence post you
[1:36:17] can go ahead and stick them all wings
[1:36:18] out start waving them around you can
[1:36:21] start kind of kind of doing something
[1:36:24] hey man but most of us would be too
[1:36:25] embarrassed to you know don't worry
[1:36:27] about me church i'm just exercising
[1:36:29] because i'm on a post right now but i
[1:36:31] don't plan on staying on the post i plan
[1:36:34] on getting up into heavenly places
[1:36:36] because i know i know that voice that
[1:36:39] called me is telling me to jump off this
[1:36:42] post but right now this post is my
[1:36:44] security
[1:36:47] what'd you say
[1:36:48] i said come up a little
[1:36:50] higher i'm trying i didn't tell you to
[1:36:53] try i told you to do
[1:36:55] i didn't tell you to try and get the
[1:36:57] holy ghost
[1:36:58] i told you to receive it
[1:37:00] i told you to accept it i told you to
[1:37:03] get yourself lined up with the word i
[1:37:05] didn't say try to get lined up with the
[1:37:07] word i told you get lined up with the
[1:37:09] word
[1:37:11] and then that little eagle
[1:37:13] little leap of faith
[1:37:16] talk about little leap of faith sister
[1:37:18] jerry and i was driving on the highway
[1:37:20] across the lower dam here some time back
[1:37:22] i'm just thinking about church i'm
[1:37:24] looking straight ahead and jerry is
[1:37:26] driving i'm not supposed to admit that
[1:37:29] um
[1:37:32] jerry's like look look and i'm like
[1:37:35] what
[1:37:36] right here i don't know
[1:37:39] the length of our church
[1:37:42] right beside us almost the same
[1:37:43] elevation of course the dam's elevated
[1:37:45] up here and
[1:37:46] same elevation
[1:37:47] there's an eagle fly
[1:37:50] you talk about majestic
[1:37:52] hallelujah i come to church i had to i
[1:37:54] had to preach about that a little bit
[1:37:56] because i just looked out at something
[1:37:58] and i thought
[1:37:59] there it is
[1:38:00] not some scrawny little eagle down in
[1:38:02] the chicken yard you imagine how out of
[1:38:04] place he felt people would be talking
[1:38:06] about in the name of the father and the
[1:38:07] son the holy spirit he'd be like what
[1:38:09] are you talking about
[1:38:11] that don't even make sense i can't even
[1:38:13] understand that
[1:38:14] well it's revelation
[1:38:17] i'm gonna go pray for revelation lord
[1:38:19] give me revelation that ain't right
[1:38:21] that's the revelation
[1:38:24] hallelujah
[1:38:26] so what's happening saints
[1:38:30] has the right qualities
[1:38:33] to be or do something amen this is the
[1:38:36] process of being made
[1:38:39] well hallelujah
[1:38:41] amen now back to this quote here i got
[1:38:43] to hurry along here
[1:38:45] oh my
[1:38:46] what are we going to do about eternal
[1:38:48] life that ought to be a question that we
[1:38:51] as ministers and
[1:38:52] priests of our home
[1:38:54] actually lift up before ourselves on a
[1:38:57] regular basis never let it become old
[1:38:59] news to us of what we're going to do
[1:39:01] about our eternal salvation amen
[1:39:04] so as we look at this i i need to keep
[1:39:06] going
[1:39:07] so
[1:39:08] look we have so much information about
[1:39:11] the dark ages right it's just there's
[1:39:13] just tons and tons of information if you
[1:39:15] ever
[1:39:16] i mispronounce as often as i pronounce
[1:39:18] it correctly but if you ever decide that
[1:39:21] you can just handle it
[1:39:23] pick up the fox's book
[1:39:25] of martyrs
[1:39:28] i often say mortars and my family
[1:39:30] reminds me
[1:39:31] but pick up a fox's book of martyrs
[1:39:35] read it cover to cover
[1:39:38] you'll understand
[1:39:40] what it was the spirit
[1:39:42] of that age
[1:39:46] saint augustine of hippo or whatever his
[1:39:49] name was
[1:39:51] he had a
[1:39:52] concept it's a spirit that's on
[1:39:55] laodicean nicolaitan pastors
[1:39:57] and that is
[1:39:59] you will worship god like i tell you to
[1:40:04] not from the dictates of your heart not
[1:40:05] according to the word of god you will do
[1:40:07] it like i tell you to
[1:40:09] and when the people push back
[1:40:12] they went and had a revival and prayed
[1:40:14] with them they'd get revelation
[1:40:17] right before they chop their heads off
[1:40:20] and then what that did
[1:40:22] moved fear that's why i referenced fear
[1:40:24] earlier
[1:40:26] to the next
[1:40:28] some stood and some didn't
[1:40:33] what was
[1:40:36] clear evidence of the holy ghost in that
[1:40:38] picture right there
[1:40:41] some said i'm looking
[1:40:43] at my eternal destination
[1:40:47] and they said that's all that matters
[1:40:49] and they burnt them well we won't even
[1:40:51] go to that it's just actually pretty
[1:40:53] gruesome really
[1:40:56] pretty gruesome
[1:40:57] the prophet of god made emphasis that
[1:40:59] spirit never died
[1:41:01] so as we look at this my brother and
[1:41:03] sister we see that it was actually a uh
[1:41:07] a forced
[1:41:09] uh a worship under man's religious idea
[1:41:12] and that spirit still there the idea
[1:41:15] that it would require to people to
[1:41:17] worship like you think they should
[1:41:23] i don't want to go there
[1:41:25] but i'm telling you that's not far
[1:41:26] removed from what we believe
[1:41:30] i will say it that way that spirit is
[1:41:32] not far removed saints
[1:41:34] i'm not trying to put some kind of
[1:41:36] boogeyman out here i'm just telling you
[1:41:38] there are those that want to dictate to
[1:41:41] you
[1:41:42] what you believe
[1:41:44] that's not called revelation
[1:41:47] amen so we see
[1:41:50] it's never worked
[1:41:58] reminds me a little story you don't mind
[1:42:00] if i share it's kind of humorous
[1:42:03] i'll change his name to little johnny
[1:42:05] well johnny got in the cookie jar mother
[1:42:07] told him do not get in the cookie jerry
[1:42:09] got in the cookie jar
[1:42:11] she whips him man before you know it
[1:42:15] johnny's back in the cookie jar
[1:42:17] she whips him again
[1:42:19] and it's not very long johnny's back in
[1:42:21] the cookie jar she whips him again
[1:42:22] finally after about half a dozen times
[1:42:24] she says johnny why do you do that
[1:42:27] mom i want a cookie
[1:42:31] you didn't get it
[1:42:37] you did get it
[1:42:39] kinda got it
[1:42:43] the idea
[1:42:46] that they thought they could overrule
[1:42:48] the desire of the heart
[1:42:51] with punishment
[1:42:54] children don't listen
[1:42:57] but you see
[1:42:59] when it comes to spiritual things
[1:43:01] you will not keep a son or daughter of
[1:43:03] god from going back to the word amen
[1:43:06] you cannot you can punish them you can
[1:43:09] whip them kill them burn them at the
[1:43:11] stake do whatever you you will not keep
[1:43:13] them little johnny wanted a cookie so
[1:43:16] bad that he knew that it was worth
[1:43:18] getting whipped to get the cookie
[1:43:21] oh did i clarify that every time he went
[1:43:23] back to the cookie jar he already nabbed
[1:43:25] the cookie before his mother nabbed him
[1:43:28] now you see johnny's desire for the
[1:43:29] cookie was greater than his fear of
[1:43:33] punishment
[1:43:34] but when the fear of punishment becomes
[1:43:36] so great then people start to conform
[1:43:39] you'll find this all through history
[1:43:41] amen
[1:43:42] so look at this uh uh
[1:43:45] you see what is to force the people to
[1:43:48] serve god in a certain fashion and and
[1:43:50] i've gotten my notes here many people
[1:43:52] think that that is behind us but they're
[1:43:54] wrong you see my brother and sister if
[1:43:56] god if you serve god
[1:44:00] from fear
[1:44:02] well there's two sides of obedience
[1:44:05] there's two sides of fear
[1:44:08] you serve
[1:44:09] god from fear which is terror or phobia
[1:44:15] you're not really serving god
[1:44:17] if you serve god from fear
[1:44:20] which is
[1:44:23] reverence
[1:44:26] and respect
[1:44:28] two entirely different results
[1:44:31] one is afraid to what will happen to him
[1:44:34] if he doesn't another one sees the
[1:44:37] blessings that will be poured upon him
[1:44:40] for serving god
[1:44:42] amen so it's there that we see this my
[1:44:45] brother and sister now let me take this
[1:44:47] little concept spin it to you real fast
[1:44:49] here as i gotta hurry along
[1:44:51] fear is a false positive to a christian
[1:44:56] can you grasp that
[1:44:59] i don't want to go to hell
[1:45:02] going to serve god
[1:45:04] what's the depth of that equation
[1:45:07] it's actually your terror
[1:45:10] of going to hell
[1:45:13] it is not
[1:45:15] your fear or reverence to god
[1:45:19] you see so it's there in that position
[1:45:22] so many people
[1:45:24] they they take this position okay i go
[1:45:26] to church my family supports the church
[1:45:29] my family's all in church and and you
[1:45:32] know praise the lord i just we we just
[1:45:34] yeah we don't want to go to hell
[1:45:37] you have a false positive
[1:45:39] you have this idea that all is well your
[1:45:41] spiritual position is good and so
[1:45:44] therefore you mark that as a positive
[1:45:46] thing but my brother and sister that
[1:45:48] kind of fear won't get you into heaven
[1:45:50] so it's that fear in reverence to the
[1:45:53] word of god amen but see satan wants to
[1:45:56] make this false positive a part of your
[1:45:59] christian experience he wants you to if
[1:46:02] i don't say amen i don't understand this
[1:46:05] there's things about the message i just
[1:46:06] don't get and i don't do that well my
[1:46:09] brother and sister it's one thing to say
[1:46:10] there's parts of the message that and
[1:46:12] the scripture i i honestly i can't
[1:46:15] explain them i don't really understand
[1:46:16] that but praise god the lord has led me
[1:46:20] and when i prayed that he would guide me
[1:46:22] to truth and here i am i just believe
[1:46:24] that and say amen to it but there's
[1:46:26] another side to that where people will
[1:46:29] say oh hallelujah amen
[1:46:33] why are you saying amen brother
[1:46:35] well
[1:46:37] i don't know why i'm saying amen it's
[1:46:39] just what we do in our church
[1:46:43] because i don't want to go to hell i'm
[1:46:47] i'm not articulating this very well so
[1:46:49] help me
[1:46:51] but you see the two sides my brother
[1:46:52] sister the two signs so satan is trying
[1:46:55] to make fear part of your experience
[1:46:58] we're afraid that our children that are
[1:46:59] lost they're going to remain lost we're
[1:47:01] afraid of this over here we're afraid of
[1:47:03] that over there we're afraid of the day
[1:47:05] that we stumble and have troubles in our
[1:47:06] life that we don't have the holy ghost
[1:47:08] my we're afraid afraid afraid afraid
[1:47:10] afraid my brother and sister that will
[1:47:12] never boost you or build you up into a
[1:47:15] christian who can come boldly to the
[1:47:16] throne of god it won't do it it will
[1:47:18] always hold you back because you're
[1:47:20] afraid just like people taking communion
[1:47:23] well you know i had a rough month
[1:47:25] or two months or whatever and and i i
[1:47:28] just don't want to take communion
[1:47:30] unworthily you know they're expressing
[1:47:32] fear
[1:47:34] but the man who expresses fear in
[1:47:36] reverence
[1:47:37] says you know what
[1:47:39] the word of god says the prophet says
[1:47:42] the pastor says that i can deal with
[1:47:45] this and i can come and yes it was a
[1:47:47] rough two months seemed like the devil
[1:47:49] ran over me and drugged me and strung me
[1:47:51] on the barbed wire fence and everything
[1:47:53] else but praise god i'm a son of god i'm
[1:47:55] a daughter of god and i asked the lord
[1:47:57] to forgive me and as i was speaking to
[1:48:00] him he spoke back to me and i have a
[1:48:02] right to do this
[1:48:05] one doesn't come because of what they're
[1:48:06] doing
[1:48:07] and another comes in spite of what he's
[1:48:09] doing and people would say i don't know
[1:48:11] about brother so-and-so because he sure
[1:48:13] had a rough month well hallelujah how
[1:48:15] about you come hang out at his house at
[1:48:17] midnight actually don't because you'll
[1:48:19] get shot with a shotgun in the front
[1:48:20] yard but anyway
[1:48:23] you see what's happening
[1:48:24] satan using these fears
[1:48:26] fears fears
[1:48:29] we're not worthy we're not worthy
[1:48:31] i'll tell you what my family sister sue
[1:48:33] will be able to remind you
[1:48:35] you talk about communion
[1:48:38] set in church before communion you
[1:48:40] thought you were actually at a flogging
[1:48:47] there's some of you ought not be taking
[1:48:48] communion tonight
[1:48:51] you got spirits on you
[1:48:55] the devil's been leading you
[1:48:58] i don't want to have to call out your
[1:48:59] names
[1:49:01] so you should just sit in your seat not
[1:49:03] participate
[1:49:10] wait
[1:49:12] that thing you're accusing me of
[1:49:14] is already under the blood
[1:49:18] what are you talking about
[1:49:21] but you see the fear
[1:49:24] and after
[1:49:25] you whip the puppy
[1:49:27] enough times
[1:49:30] are you with me
[1:49:36] brother one time was talking about
[1:49:40] how you should never raise your children
[1:49:41] where they fear you
[1:49:45] and his boy was kind of a little bit
[1:49:47] behind him
[1:49:48] standing about arms reach he's talking
[1:49:50] about
[1:49:50] i don't know about these people raise
[1:49:52] their kids up to be afraid he said my
[1:49:54] son and his sons like
[1:50:02] like they say sometimes actions do speak
[1:50:04] louder than words
[1:50:07] my brother and sister what is fear god
[1:50:09] to do a place in the house of god
[1:50:11] i'll tell you let that fear come from
[1:50:13] the holy spirit
[1:50:14] let that fear come god dealing with you
[1:50:16] i read the quote uh wednesday or sunday
[1:50:19] about uh uh
[1:50:21] condemning the prophet of god talking
[1:50:23] about condemning you let the holy spirit
[1:50:25] do that we don't need this pulpit to do
[1:50:28] that let the holy ghost come down stir
[1:50:30] the heart and say lord forgive me for
[1:50:32] what i thought said did acted upon here
[1:50:34] forgive me lord and then as you have
[1:50:36] judged yourself no one needs to judge
[1:50:38] you
[1:50:39] but you see i want to drive this home to
[1:50:41] you fear is a false positive
[1:50:44] amen
[1:50:45] now let's look at this uncertain sound
[1:50:47] i've got to hurry along things i was
[1:50:49] going to be done by now
[1:50:50] in the garden of eden a man was divided
[1:50:52] in two parts
[1:50:54] the devil took his head
[1:50:56] and god took his heart
[1:51:03] reminds me of a story i read once i
[1:51:06] don't know why i feel led to share this
[1:51:07] but i will
[1:51:09] reminds me of a story i read once
[1:51:12] about a very pretty girl lived in a
[1:51:14] small town
[1:51:17] two boys liked her
[1:51:20] somebody said well what are you going to
[1:51:22] do they both are just wild about you
[1:51:25] she said i i don't know what to do
[1:51:28] this one over here with his little curly
[1:51:30] hair and his blue eyes just
[1:51:34] i just love looking at him
[1:51:36] but he's got my heart
[1:51:41] apply that right here
[1:51:44] man's divided in two parts
[1:51:47] the devil caught her attention
[1:51:53] can i can i just go along that does that
[1:51:55] make sense to you
[1:51:57] yeah
[1:51:58] devil got her attention
[1:52:00] but the other one had her heart
[1:52:03] you think well it'd be obvious she's
[1:52:05] going to choose the ones got her heart
[1:52:06] no it's not that simple
[1:52:08] no a lot of girls have married a rascal
[1:52:12] yeah lots and lots of young ladies have
[1:52:14] married a rascal because he was a
[1:52:15] good-looking rascal
[1:52:18] reminds me that same story the run
[1:52:20] rascal he'd bring flowers just as many
[1:52:22] flowers to the
[1:52:24] mother
[1:52:25] as he did to the daughter
[1:52:28] because he knew as long as mother was
[1:52:30] happy
[1:52:31] the daughter
[1:52:32] was his
[1:52:37] hopes young ladies are listening
[1:52:40] no i don't know that young ladies need
[1:52:42] to listen moms are you listening
[1:52:45] yes sir
[1:52:48] the devil makes him look at things and
[1:52:49] say well it just can't happen i can
[1:52:51] reason it out
[1:52:53] and god took his heart to dwell in his
[1:52:55] heart to make him believe things
[1:52:57] that his head
[1:52:59] don't even know nothing about
[1:53:02] you see the world we're living in my
[1:53:03] brother and sister too many people are
[1:53:05] serving god in their head and they don't
[1:53:08] understand they think they have the same
[1:53:10] revelation that you have and i'm not
[1:53:13] saying that to be arrogant but i'm
[1:53:14] telling you it's a dividing line and
[1:53:16] they've got it in the head and they
[1:53:18] believe they have the same revelation
[1:53:20] you do
[1:53:22] but it isn't in their hearts so they
[1:53:24] can't take it into the heart because the
[1:53:26] heart is actually the control center
[1:53:30] god took his heart to dwell in his heart
[1:53:32] to make him believe things that his head
[1:53:34] don't even know nothing about that's
[1:53:35] right so it's in your heart
[1:53:38] you think we thought we were thinking
[1:53:41] when it comes to serving god with our
[1:53:43] brain
[1:53:44] but it's not is it
[1:53:56] yeah
[1:53:58] do it johnny do it it's going to hurt
[1:54:02] do it anyway johnny
[1:54:04] it's going to hurt
[1:54:05] come on johnny
[1:54:09] it hurt
[1:54:12] now the head
[1:54:13] is what got them to do
[1:54:16] what they knew would hurt them
[1:54:19] not the heart
[1:54:21] because the heart had expressed already
[1:54:23] this is going to hurt
[1:54:25] but they went with the head
[1:54:26] and they said i'm going to be
[1:54:28] disobedient to the word of god no matter
[1:54:29] what
[1:54:30] and the heart is saying it's going to
[1:54:31] hurt
[1:54:33] it's going to hurt you're going gonna
[1:54:35] wish you'd never done that
[1:54:36] and the head says ah
[1:54:38] that's all right nobody in that church
[1:54:40] loves me anyhow
[1:54:45] so it's in your heart you think down
[1:54:47] here that's where the real certain sound
[1:54:49] comes from is from the heart
[1:54:51] that's where god talks
[1:54:53] and here's where the devil talks from so
[1:54:56] and i'm sure brother branham's pointing
[1:54:57] right up here to the head so let's cast
[1:54:59] down what the devil said and take a
[1:55:01] certain sound and that certain sound is
[1:55:04] god talking in your heart
[1:55:06] that's truth god promises
[1:55:10] isn't that beautiful
[1:55:11] now if the preacher
[1:55:13] is trying to use fear to get you to
[1:55:16] follow the message
[1:55:19] then there'll come a time they lose the
[1:55:21] fear
[1:55:24] but when the fear
[1:55:26] comes out of the word of god into you
[1:55:29] and you say that's who i am i am a son
[1:55:33] of god i am a daughter of god i am a
[1:55:35] child of god
[1:55:37] it moved from the head and the hearts
[1:55:38] now speaking
[1:55:40] but if we listen to the head too long
[1:55:45] i've got so many examples i could give
[1:55:46] you
[1:55:48] my
[1:55:48] i don't want to do that let's just kind
[1:55:50] of hurry
[1:55:51] along here
[1:55:52] i i just want to finish up sister emmy
[1:55:54] would you call musicians
[1:55:57] um we just have to
[1:55:59] we just have to say stop because there's
[1:56:01] just so
[1:56:02] oh my brother david you know what i'm
[1:56:03] talking about brother chris you know
[1:56:04] what i'm talking about
[1:56:06] it's like opening a book i know none of
[1:56:08] you have ever done this
[1:56:10] but you sit down in your chair at nine
[1:56:12] o'clock at night with a book
[1:56:15] and you started thinking i'm just going
[1:56:17] to read a few pages see what the book's
[1:56:18] about
[1:56:20] and at 3 am
[1:56:22] you're still reading
[1:56:25] amen that's the word
[1:56:27] to the heart of sons and daughters of
[1:56:28] god
[1:56:29] so good
[1:56:32] let's take it in a childlike form where
[1:56:34] every believer no matter what church you
[1:56:36] belong to and your pastor if he's a
[1:56:38] right man he will tell you that that you
[1:56:41] can only be saved through faith and not
[1:56:42] through works through faith now you
[1:56:45] believe that he saved you now first
[1:56:47] thing that comes from the heart
[1:56:49] you believe it
[1:56:51] then you walk up see not from the mind
[1:56:55] come on saints i'm just going to drive
[1:56:57] this home i've dealt in the last while
[1:56:59] with some people that would justify
[1:57:01] their behavior
[1:57:04] with quotes
[1:57:10] [Music]
[1:57:12] justified to act like a bobcat in a
[1:57:14] trash can
[1:57:16] got quotes to back it up
[1:57:20] what's the spirit of it
[1:57:22] what's the nature of it
[1:57:25] well i tell you what they've done
[1:57:27] i i i'm plagiarizing this off of a
[1:57:29] brother he said the prophet of god said
[1:57:31] now as believers he's talking about
[1:57:33] brahms but mean believers we settle
[1:57:36] things in the backyard
[1:57:37] this brother told me he says man you
[1:57:39] ought to see the size of some of these
[1:57:40] people's backyard it goes down to
[1:57:42] walmart and kmart and it goes over to
[1:57:44] costco and it goes to that side of the
[1:57:46] valley and that side of the valley
[1:57:48] that's how big their backyard is because
[1:57:50] they'll just take their
[1:57:51] argumentative
[1:57:53] contesting critical spirit everywhere
[1:57:57] it shows you how big their backyard is
[1:58:01] now you believe that he saved you first
[1:58:02] thing that comes to heart you believe it
[1:58:05] then you walk up and confess it say i
[1:58:07] accept jesus as my personal savior now i
[1:58:09] believe i believe he saved me
[1:58:12] that's not a physical thing in the world
[1:58:14] that you could prove that you're saved
[1:58:16] come on saints i want you to think about
[1:58:18] ponder this morning can you prove to me
[1:58:20] you're saved
[1:58:26] i've told you about the lady that sister
[1:58:28] jerry went to farm business

[1:58:51] i'm a hippie
[1:58:52] i didn't know there was a rule book for
[1:58:54] hippies to dress that way but that's the
[1:58:55] way she dressed
[1:58:57] so sisters can you prove it by your
[1:58:58] dress
[1:59:02] never cut her hair can you prove it by
[1:59:03] not cutting your hair
[1:59:05] i mean after all you could just be a
[1:59:07] hippie in disguise
[1:59:16] walk up confess it say accept jesus my
[1:59:18] personal savior i believe he saved me
[1:59:20] not a physical thing get that outside
[1:59:24] in the world that you could prove that
[1:59:25] you're saved your eyes are the same
[1:59:27] color you got the same shirt you had on
[1:59:29] go outside the old gang says ain't
[1:59:31] nothing to do with that but you believe
[1:59:33] there's something to it can we say amen
[1:59:35] to that we believe there's something to
[1:59:38] it
[1:59:38] and now
[1:59:39] what if you say well i'm going to see
[1:59:41] how it works out
[1:59:44] in other words i'm just going to test
[1:59:45] drive being a christian
[1:59:48] now if god will answer my prayer about a
[1:59:49] better house
[1:59:51] better job
[1:59:53] a vacation to the bahamas
[1:59:56] on a cruise and a new tesla
[2:00:01] then i i believe it's real
[2:00:05] come on
[2:00:08] i'm going to see how it works out it'll
[2:00:10] never work out until you keep your
[2:00:11] testimony going
[2:00:14] oh look at this saints god has given us
[2:00:16] a privilege to every single day of our
[2:00:19] life say i believe this word and i can
[2:00:22] take that step i believe what god is
[2:00:24] doing in my life i can take that step
[2:00:26] what am i doing i'm keeping my testimony
[2:00:28] going i'm not stopping and saying well
[2:00:31] i'm just waiting when god moves i'll
[2:00:33] move
[2:00:34] well god might sit there a lot longer
[2:00:36] than you can wait
[2:00:37] [Music]
[2:00:38] hallelujah
[2:00:40] look at this you got to keep your
[2:00:41] testimony going
[2:00:44] you believe you're saved
[2:00:46] oh hallelujah i like this
[2:00:48] you believe you're saved you act like
[2:00:50] you're saved
[2:00:51] you say you're saved you associate with
[2:00:54] those that are saved and it works
[2:00:56] salvation is that right and the same
[2:00:59] will take place by divine healing you
[2:01:01] believe you're healed
[2:01:02] you act like he healed you
[2:01:05] oh now this is gonna hurt
[2:01:08] you say you're healed he's the high
[2:01:11] priest of your confession to make good
[2:01:13] on anything that you confess he's done
[2:01:15] before the father there it is
[2:01:18] come on saints that's why the prophet of
[2:01:20] god used that i almost bring that quote
[2:01:23] where he says now you you talk about i
[2:01:25] i'm no good as a christian he said
[2:01:27] you're talking the devil's language
[2:01:30] because that's not a holy ghost filled
[2:01:32] man or woman
[2:01:33] child of god's testimony i am worthy
[2:01:37] because he said i'm worthy
[2:01:38] i'm healed because he said i'm healed
[2:01:41] i've got the holy ghost because he said
[2:01:43] if i would follow this formula as it
[2:01:45] were that i could receive the holy ghost
[2:01:48] and i take that and i stand on that and
[2:01:51] then it is that i left as it were the
[2:01:53] scripture out of those scriptures today
[2:01:55] saints because you see it's not by
[2:01:58] anything that we have done lest any man
[2:02:01] could boast
[2:02:02] we have no boasting rights but i tell
[2:02:05] you what we have as we move on in
[2:02:07] ephesians 2 10. amen brother mason can
[2:02:10] you just go right to the front and pop
[2:02:12] that right back up ephesians 2 10.
[2:02:15] for we
[2:02:17] are the scraps
[2:02:18] from god's eternal factory
[2:02:22] no sir we are the whole reason
[2:02:26] that this come about
[2:02:28] us and the saints of the ages we are the
[2:02:31] reason saints
[2:02:32] oh god didn't just decide when it was
[2:02:34] all done look what i've done maybe i'll
[2:02:36] save somebody he said right from the
[2:02:38] very beginning these are my people i'll
[2:02:41] create an atmosphere i'll create a world
[2:02:44] they'll live in i'll create these
[2:02:45] spirits and let them roam free to hinder
[2:02:48] them and i'll create a spirit that i
[2:02:51] place in them and that spirit will
[2:02:53] overcome every other spirit on the face
[2:02:56] of the earth that holy spirit god
[2:02:59] himself said i am the only one of might
[2:03:03] and majesty i am the only one of glory
[2:03:09] no fear
[2:03:10] you don't see god
[2:03:12] you know there's two management style
[2:03:13] saints
[2:03:15] those that are proactive
[2:03:16] and those that put out fires
[2:03:19] and usually right before lunch i do
[2:03:21] pretty good on the proactive and from
[2:03:23] about one to five i run around and put
[2:03:26] out fires i'm looking for the day i can
[2:03:28] get the two together no i don't i want
[2:03:30] to claim the morning
[2:03:32] amen but look at this we
[2:03:35] are
[2:03:35] his
[2:03:36] workmanship
[2:03:38] [Music]
[2:03:42] if we could believe that god
[2:03:44] could make a mistake
[2:03:46] if we could believe that somehow god
[2:03:50] would be just like you know go on amazon
[2:03:53] go on ebay
[2:03:55] you can buy seconds
[2:03:58] i'm going to speak rough to you rough as
[2:04:00] paul gets
[2:04:02] if you want to believe you're a second
[2:04:04] today
[2:04:05] you go right ahead
[2:04:07] but i believe i'm the first of the
[2:04:10] thoughts of almighty god
[2:04:12] i believe that i am the intent and the
[2:04:15] purpose and i'll tell you what i really
[2:04:16] feel i believe absolutely on the depths
[2:04:19] of my heart that you are god's first
[2:04:20] choice you are not a second choice you
[2:04:23] are not a second as it were with a flaw
[2:04:25] somewhere that makes you worth less but
[2:04:28] you are the very reason of being
[2:04:30] oh hallelujah
[2:04:32] where's workmanship created in christ
[2:04:35] jesus
[2:04:36] unto
[2:04:39] mediocre
[2:04:40] no my brother and sister it's a devil
[2:04:42] that's telling you you're mediocre it's
[2:04:44] the devil that's telling you you're
[2:04:46] unworthy it's the devil that's telling
[2:04:47] you you're not living up to it it's a
[2:04:50] devil that's trying to put a fear in
[2:04:51] your heart that you can't live in this
[2:04:53] generation
[2:04:57] i study these things i'm sorry taking up
[2:05:00] time but i study these things
[2:05:03] and there's a huge proportion of young
[2:05:05] people when they interview them they say
[2:05:07] there's no hope for us
[2:05:09] the world is doomed
[2:05:11] my goodness some of them even believe in
[2:05:13] 10 years it's going to burst into flames
[2:05:15] and i actually kind of agree with him
[2:05:19] but it's not going to be methane gas
[2:05:22] or global warming
[2:05:24] amen
[2:05:25] it'll be the wrath of god see how they
[2:05:27] did that according to the scripture said
[2:05:29] that they would worship the creation
[2:05:30] more than the creator and we're seeing
[2:05:32] that come to pass oh it's the
[2:05:33] environment we should all care yes
[2:05:36] we should all care
[2:05:38] every one of us should care why because
[2:05:40] we have a stewardship to stand up
[2:05:44] not because we're concerned
[2:05:46] my brother and sister about what's going
[2:05:48] to happen to this earth
[2:05:50] in fact as i've said before
[2:05:52] global warming
[2:05:53] i don't know how much two-tenths of a
[2:05:55] degree makes
[2:05:58] [Music]
[2:05:59] but the lord just says
[2:06:03] wait that was my wife's voice
[2:06:06] honey would you please go in the
[2:06:09] kitchen and turn the stove on preheat
[2:06:13] [Music]
[2:06:15] we've gained two tenths of a degree over
[2:06:17] the last 15 years
[2:06:20] the lord said earth
[2:06:22] i'm turning you
[2:06:24] i'm preheating
[2:06:27] and they're
[2:06:28] worried about all of this
[2:06:31] but let me drag you back and then i'm
[2:06:33] done
[2:06:34] no concern
[2:06:36] over their soul
[2:06:39] [Music]
[2:06:42] not one concern over their soul
[2:06:46] but they will pour billions of dollars
[2:06:49] and billions and millions of man-hours
[2:06:52] to preserve the earth
[2:06:54] and not even one moment
[2:06:56] to preserve the soul
[2:06:58] [Music]
[2:07:00] hallelujah
[2:07:02] you see we are his workmanship created
[2:07:04] in christ jesus under good works which
[2:07:06] god hath before ordained that we should
[2:07:08] walk in them aren't you glad that you
[2:07:10] can walk in that today
[2:07:12] amen hallelujah

[2:07:20] songs that when i'm studying they just
[2:07:21] come to my mind and i i have to admit
[2:07:24] that makes me a little prejudiced to the
[2:07:26] thought of them
[2:07:28] but i believe they're pertinent i
[2:07:30] believe they fit amen i'm a new creation
[2:07:33] hallelujah that's the creation we're
[2:07:35] worried about being
[2:07:37] rejuvenated renewed amen hallelujah

[2:10:28] we are

[2:10:32] and you've got to train yourself to
[2:10:34] speak god's vocabulary
[2:10:37] if you want god's results
[2:10:40] this is not the power of positive
[2:10:42] thinking
[2:10:43] this is an absolute confession from the
[2:10:47] heart
[2:10:48] of who we are
[2:10:50] don't let one doubt one fear come into
