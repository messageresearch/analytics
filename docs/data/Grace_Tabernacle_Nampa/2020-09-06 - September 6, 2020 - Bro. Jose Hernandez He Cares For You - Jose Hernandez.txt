wilderness and god tells him go ahead send him away but i'll make a nation out of ishmael because he's your seed and hagar and ishmael go into the wilderness and they run out of water and they're about to die and even though ishmael and hagar were you could say not part of the children of god not part of that plan they god made a promise to abraham so he provided water to save the life of ishmael and hagar so that his promise could come to pass he preserved his promise and if he can do that for hagar and ishmael what can he do for a child of god this morning amen and so i tell myself

why don't you come i'm gonna give brother paul amen you serve a god like that hallelujah well you know saints there's always just something happening in life my heart is breaking for our brother kenny his family for their son being in this accident but we have to remember saints that uh it's not over till it's over amen and uh prayer changes thing do we believe that amen the most powerful thing that we have is prayer amen and when you think about that you think what the power of prayer does it not only changes the situation but it changes you while you're praying for the situation amen you cannot have a hard stony heart and sincerely pray you must soften yourself you must surrender yourself you must give yourself over to the will of god believing now saints we wouldn't pray at all would we unless we believe god would answer that prayer right that's that's the very fundamental basis of what we have prayer is we believe god will answer that prayer the word of god says that the fervent effectual prayer right not the half-hearted doesn't say the half-hearted prayer of any old person the fervent effectual prayer of a righteous man you want your prayers answered don't go blaming everybody else just stand on the word say lord change me i want my prayers to reach right to the throne of god i want him to come with authority we're not beggars we're sons and daughters of almighty god now having said all of that saints i received a phone call on friday afternoon i believe it was about 5 45 or so and there was a voice on the other end that was rejoining rejoicing tremendously remember we've been praying for ryan and brie and their unborn baby of which the doctors had declared emphatically that they were certain that this child would be a down syndrome child and they had been preparing to you know go go speak to as it were the clinical psychologist and nothing wrong with them they're doing the best that they can do but to be prepared because when many people have a child that there's an issue it's it's such a a shock to them the reality of it they try to prepare them for you know what is coming and doctors are doctors they're men but we serve god amen we serve an awesome god just as the songs here today have declared we serve a mighty god amen not just a mighty god but an almighty god amen that we can stand on the word of god with complete confidence and if it goes to the right or goes to the left it doesn't matter we still serve god right we don't run from our problems we just go face to face and say lord you know best amen because if we come to the place we doubt god we have nothing to stand on i mean absolutely nothing amen you know uh it it's i don't know how to present this but i got this phone call and uh brie um she she said paul i i just had to call you and i said that's wonderful to hear from you she said i hope you don't mind i got your number from a neighbor landlord and i hope it's a good time and i said it's a perfect time she said well i just have to share this with you and i can hear her crying on the other end and you're thinking oh my my little baby girl was born perfect [Applause] so we had quite a conversation this little deal that brother alex will put up in just a minute is just the slight little blurb she sent as a text because she said please share this with your church please please share this and i say thank you from my heart for your prayers that you would care so much about us and our child and we had a lovely time and you know the prophet of god said that if you have the meat and you have the salt but they don't come together the salt can never never preserve the meat amen it's our job saints it's who we are to be the salt of the earth it's who we are to step beyond our comfort zone to remind someone that is filled with fear i don't believe the doctors intended to put fear there but they were convinced the doctors are convinced because they have medical science they have tests they have research they have all of these things in their mind they fully expected to see a down syndrome child birth but god has other plans amen and we stand on the word of god he's the final voice amen we're not going to listen to this over here and listen to that over there we're going to listen to his voice because his voice is the final voice you know what they say the rest of it is just noise hallelujah cut through the noise get back so you hear god amen there's a lot of things i could share about this but i just uh asked brother alex to just pump this on the screen amen now there's quite a story here and i got to hear all of it and i was happy to hear all of it uh brie herself was born in hawaii and uh her father was in the military and so i can butcher names just as well as anyone but uh something on the order of kelana joy and uh seven pounds nine ounces 21 inches and she said this is my simplest words i can put it she's god's special miracle see her and her husband didn't go oh the doctors made a mistake she said there was something lifted from her there was something she said of peace settled in all is well and we can say we've heard the message shalom all as well let us share that my brother and sister no matter where you are what is happening you say well people kind of rebuff it well i can take you to quotes i just actually was reading right the start of the service the prophet of god says you know what you just asked for god's leadership and when you have given enough listen to the nudge and stop that's it but if we never share amen oh my amen let's just stand and praise the lord amen saints i fully believe from my heart we have been a part of a miracle oh heavenly father lord we lift our hands in praise to you today lord father for this young man this young lady father and lord how their hearts were crying out and father we stand with them father in their prayers lord before your mighty throne believing father lord not a doubt not a fear but just believing lord that you are in control and we lord commit all things not just in rhine and bree and little kelana's life lord but father in all things father we just committed to you that thy perfect will be done lord let us never fear let us never turn back but lord let us stand faithful upon your word confessing that you are a mighty god you are our god the creator of heaven and earth o lord that you are in control of all things father and lord we will not listen to the voice of doubt or the voice of fear lord but we will listen to your voice father that you would lead us and guide us in all things lord we lift our voices today lord saying thank you father for this child that was born perfect lord they took the child lord as you know and they did every kind of test that they could run on this newborn baby and all they could say to this young lady when they brought her back is your daughter is perfect oh father we thank you we thank you lord jesus and give praise to you today in the name of jesus christ hallelujah thank you lord jesus thank you lord jesus you know i just want to inject one word i don't want to keep brother jose time from him but uh i might preach on this but i just i just want to put this out to you right now as as a little thought as brother chris was preaching on wednesday it struck me how big is your fleece [Music] lord if you could just if you could just maybe possibly i got a god that answers questions i go to god he's a creator he's a healer amen he's the provider and he also expects you to stand in your promise amen amen don't let the devil occupy half of your promise don't give some of your promise away stand in your promise lord if you are here there's nothing wrong with this saints lord if you are here if you're in my life lord i need you to come down i need you to make yourself known to me i need you to guide me i need help lord hallelujah i just sat there yesterday just kind of you know i won't go in the details but just like lord i just i just need you lord and i promise you saints i'm not exaggerating there was just a presence just swept down right there i thought thank you lord you're here you're here oh praise the lord hallelujah [Music] screen there and i saw nine pounds or seven pounds nine ounces that's how big i was [Music] god has got big things stored for [Music] her i said now here i want you to understand i believe god's got something special for your baby she's starting her life with a miracle amen god's got great things absolutely isn't it awesome to be involved in a miracle or be part of it amen praise the lord this is a song that just came in my mind is anything too hard for god so let's sing this as we get ready to receive brother jose it's out of your hands you've done all you can do [Music] you've given god the problem it's no longer up to you you've prayed the prayer of faith you're standing on god's truth while you're waiting for the answer he has a question [Music] [Music] is [Music] situations he's not the master [Music] only believe trust his word you'll see his plans are now unfolding performing perfectly it's clear how much he loves you look at all he's done for all your questions there's really only [Music] is [Music] on the situation [Music] is anything too hard for god amen can you hear me god bless you sounds better i just i just like to make sure that everyone is awake and because i don't want wanna if someone fall asleep that will be my responsibility then so if everybody is awake i have to work on something if someone sleeps bless you one more time amen amen uh before you go uh he is here i have to warm up a little bit [Music] he is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is hear him he is here you can touch him you will never be [Music] i want you to believe what you're saying [Music] is here is [Music] is how many believe that we shouldn't be the same after he touches you go back to the the bible read it and every single man of god that was touched by the lord it wasn't the same so if you're the same today [Music] let's pray about it we want to be different people because that's the reason we come to church because we want to be more like christ amen i'm going to read a scripture here so i can dismiss the musicians and i want to share a little bit of let's go to book of numbers 13 27. i was going to ask jason to read the scripture for me but i'm trusting that everybody got their bibles your bible so you can read it because don't expect to sound beautiful for my mouth so thank you very jason uh and this chapter here it talks about the the spies moses sent the spies to the canaan land and um they some of them they came back afraid yeah and some of them came back excited yes because what they saw so let's read in the just for the sake of time uh i'm gonna go i'm gonna jump to verse 30. then caleb quieted the people before moses and said let us go up and take once and take position for we are well able to overcome it he was an excited guy yes that's right now if we go to chapter 14 verse 4. so you know they were whining already complaining and then oh but this is there's giants and i mean don't you see sometimes that kind of spirit so verse 4 says so they say to another one let us select a leader and return to egypt they were ready to go back i've seen that many times we stumble on something and you know we just throw the towel like let's go back but verse 6 but joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of whatever he says who were among those who had spied despite out the the land tore the clothes i mean we all know what that means they were in a in a situation that i said come on people you've seen the hand of god all the way and you're still trying to go back and you still don't believe what he's capable of right that's why they turned their clothes because they were desperate how these people don't understand or don't believe still don't trust in god and they spoke to all congregation of the children of israel saying the land we pass through to spy to spy out is an ex is exceedingly good land if the lord delights in us then he will bring us into this land and give it to us and a land which flows with milk and honey let us pray heavenly father we read your word lord and there is so many things that we can learn father so many things we can speak of father but we want you to come and speak to our heart this morning and and push me away lord so you can come and speak to these people father we ask you these things and and commit the service into your hands lord for your honor and glory in the name of jesus christ amen well you may be seated i just before i get started i i just want to say thank you to brother paul for having me here and and his confidence to share his pulpit with me and uh gracias hermana por el canto espanol i think next time i'm going to speak in spanish so she can translate english and then i am on my way with my family to colorado which i believe some of my family they're watching right now and uh but i just cannot do drive-through and not stopping by here although some people can't do that i don't wanna i don't wanna say who but i don't wanna name names i love you brother paul but uh you know is is for me this is like my second home is since uh i met brother paul in oregon i think i've said this before but uh uh is it's uh always a pleasure to say it again that i i i knew that i found a friend and having me here in his pulpit means a lot to me i'm the least person worthy to be here but thank god i found grace and uh and grace tabernacle and i don't know if it's true but he said people love me here but you know what if it's not true i want to say i love you anyway i told him brother paul you're a pastor you can lie i really enjoy every time i come here sometimes i get so sensitive you probably know me already but uh it's a lot of things that i'm grateful to the lord like my beautiful wife that she's always with me and that's uh my uh companion to everywhere we go and and even though she she's weary with kids and uh and husband sometimes she's always willing to you know my my title this morning i i tell it god cares for you i don't know i haven't even started speaking and i'm already crying so sorry but you know what is it's because god really cares for you and he's being caring for me since since the day i made my decision to follow him he's been reading my steps and some i had to admit one time i was ready to throw the towel and i think i shared this testimony with you before after being trying to live in a christian life and i didn't see the hand of god moving within me and single and uh and uh one day i said lord i've been trying to do my best and i identify myself here too with these people they were trying to find someone to take him back to egypt and there was me too maybe i'm the only one but you know this is what breaks my heart is because who am i so i can have mercy of me more than anyone else because i grew up with many more people young people than my my time my time i'm sorry but uh you know when i was ready to throw everything away this is the most i think that the most important thing in my spiritual life because if it wasn't god then who was want someone to tell me who it was i was i was going to it was a monday tuesday somewhere in there and on friday i was planning to go out to to the bar for the first time i never taste wine or liquor by the glory of god but i was gonna do it for the first time and by wednesday night thursday night somewhere in there i got a phone call god bless brother bernie garcia senior i don't know why he still have him they're just laying he's he's not capable of doing nothing but he's still breathing and by then he was busy enough with his huge church churches in mexico he was busy he never called someone he always say hey call this brother call this brother he always asks someone to call this time he called himself his words were like this son i love you it was a voicemail because i didn't answer i'm calling jesus to say i love you god loves you and i know what you've been through i was struggling then if it wasn't god who told him what i was going through who told him that what i was going what's going to do now friday if you see tears right now this is nothing compared to tonight because god cares for you he's been caring for me amen then i was about to make a mistake marrying someone that wasn't a believer or dating and then god talked to me again and said you don't want to go that route you know what god rewards when you're faithful to him because what he gave me for a wife i couldn't find another one that's right she's the best that she that he had for me and he had her reserved for me and another time i might share my testimony about that but just i want to tell you this we've been 13 years married and i haven't regretted it because when i ask god for a wife i say lord i want to marry someone you give me a wife that she's willing to go wherever you want me to go and she doesn't complain there she is she never complains god cares for you or not i guess we have to move on so and this scripture here says it was a land where flow that was flowing with milk and honey and as uh milk uh these days uh typifies the holy ghost i mean and the book of joel says that in the last days god was going to pour off his spirit right to every soul or flesh but you can see a lot of uh people uh praying for someone and that person got healed because this is the holy ghost right but but also the bible here mentioned honey and this honey is very important we have the holy ghost praise the lord but we want to have honey too you know why because that's what keeps everything together i heard a story that said that there was a lady that had a dream there was a man pouring water into a basket and and and as soon as he poured water into the basket the water was flowing it never stayed there and then this lady came to a man and said what are you doing i said i'm pouring water here and i said but it's not holding it and then and and then the the man says you know why and she said why it's because and it's honey so the honey when i put honey on that will keep the rocks together and then it's going to contain water so the honey is the brotherly love so i will i will say the holy ghost and brother in love are cousins because they have to go together you have the holy ghost praise the lord but let's try to have the the brotherly love too because a people a person with the holy ghost can preach really good get on fire but can be really indifferent out there with people and you know what that situation is going to puff them up and he will think that he's a grey man and then this reminds me another might sound like his story but there was a donkey jumping going back home and told the mama hey mama everybody was clapping their hands and putting pounds on the on the road everybody was happy to see me and he was all jumping up and then the mom says okay son who was on your back oh there was an a guy named jesus okay i want you to go back the same road and see if they do the same to you i mean it wasn't the donkey it was the lord jesus so we have here the holy ghost and the brotherly love and ayah i can see here joshua uh getting facing a hard time because he and caleb got so courageous and brave enough to say oh we can take that land easy easy peasy we can take it giant who cares and it it's really easy for us sometimes to get excited and if you don't believe ask peter when you get there because under excitement we can say a lot of things but when it comes to the test i want to see you having the same attitude okay now if we got joshua number uh chapter one verse six there uh i i wanna ask you this why do you think god told him what he told him let's see let's start with verse 5 it says no man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life as i was with moses so i will be with you i will not leave not leave you not forsake you be strong and of courage for to these people you shall divide as an inheritance the language sword to the others to give give them now i i i think joshua was a human being and he was a little bit afraid caleb you had to open your big mouth over there back then and now here we are moses is gone what we're gonna do you say we can take it come on don't leave me alone here i mean joshua was a human being as you and i so then god come comes and comfort him say don't worry the way i was with moses i will be with you and if this if the if if the bible is not just history that's still alive to these days so the way he was with brother brown he's with us brother paul share a testimony awesome testimony if god is not alive these days then who can do that kind of things to fix things even before someone can put a hands on and i say things but to fix a baby right and that's that's what i always tell people it's good to rely on doctors but it is better to rely on lord jesus christ because a doctor a doctor can do or can guess the same way you can guess and i'm saying this because i had experience with it i had a pain in my my my stomach one time and this is not long ago my wife i tried not to tell my bad feelings my wife because she's got a doctor but uh so we went to the doctor and he goes like it hurts of course it hurts that's why i'm here right and he said well i'm gonna give you pain pills and if you don't get better then come back i say that's it he said yeah okay he gave me the pills i went home put it on the trash and i told my wife i'm not going to take any and i said lord you designed this body that's right you can fix it because if i'm going to go there to be a guinea pig someone's guinea pig i want to do those experiments on my own and homemade remedy sometimes works better again i'm not against science or doctors i believe in those but what i want you to go home today is you have to trust in the lord more than anything so we have moses uh joshua they don't worry because him and caleb opened their mouth and now there moses was gone maybe joshua was kind of excited because he had moses there oh god talks to moses and everything is going to be okay but guess what god took moses now is your turn to act upon the word of the lord and uh we uh he was preparing all the israelites into canaan and place all their their enemies to scare them out or kill them or whatever they had to do but they was called to take position of that land so i want to read something that it really helped me and and encouraged me uh because when god sent someone he's not sending someone on their own abilities or sending someone to guess what is going to happen when god sends someone is because he's already have commission that's right and god is going to be with him as long as we are obeying his commandments he is obligated to be with you amen but if you step out of the those lines then you're on your own and don't point fingers because when you do this three fingers are to you you're one that way and three for you so let's go to book of judge like i say keep reading your bible because there were some words that they're not going to come out good so the book of judges chapter 3 verse 1 says now you have it says now you ha these are the nations which the lord left that he might test do you hear that test so when you was invited to to be a christian probably they didn't say that you were going to be test right but look at this the lord left that my test israel by them that it is all who had not known any of wars in canaan this was only so that the generations of the children of israel might be thought to know war at least those who had not formally known it namely five lords of philistines all the canaanites cydonized and the heavy ties who dwell in mount lebanon from alba hermann to the entrance of muhammad and they were left that he might test israel israel by them to know whether they will obey the commandments of the lord which he had commanded there their fathers by the hand of moses those are the children of israel dwell among the canaanites hittites amorites fertilized the hepatitis and the hebrew sites and they took their daughters to be their wives and gave their daughters to their sons and they served their gods okay canaanites uh i did some digging a little bit and the canaanites the name canaanites means merchants or the ones who humiliate humility the hittites his name means terror so i mean this this this people here were left by god to test who his children we're not exempt of this test we are here to learn war and now it's not a war with with with the handguns but it's a spiritual war how are you gonna get strong if you're not test that's right i never forget what brother paul said one the first time he invited me to speak well you never know if you can do it if you never do it so here i am but you know you never know how much level of spirituality you have if you're not test that's right because we can get comfy it's really easy to get comfortable and not doing nothing you're getting trouble but you're not doing nothing for the lord anymore so the hittites his name is terror this guitar seems to have recent great power as a nation for a long time they were former former rivals to egyptians so they were they were they were they were not facing little guys there weak armies no wonder the other 10 guys were kind of shaking now the the amorites they were people who were arrogant have you seen arrogant people the spirits don't die huh so those those people there were testing the israelites but the spirit is still i pray god that i'm not one of them amen they had high self-esteem oh [Music] i've seen those very size they were people who had separate themselves and live and protect it they had a they had no discipline no restrictions are we living in a liberal world these days yes they don't care what the bible says oh it's my right this might write that so we're still on war the heavy tights they claim to offer a good lifestyle how many heard that i don't want to get it too deep but do you know what i'm talking about this is i mean it's parallel thing here we have giants here this time too but you know what god is here to care for you he's caring for you till this day i uh i always think about people that they've been christians for so long and then all of a sudden quit ministers i mean you can see a lot of folks come to church and then disappear and then come back and but you know what when you have a good relationship with god when you have a really a stronghold with the the holy ghost i mean there is nothing that is going to move you they might be someone you can stumble with or [Music] you're going to have ups and downs but you know what a son of god always gets up and keep moving forward because that's when he called you he didn't call you for a period of time only till the death do us a part right but you know what the religious relationship with god even when you die that's not an end is the next step yeah that's right no wonder brother branham said there is no words i can explain what i saw over there but you know what when a p when person has the revelation that's right that what is over there uh there's nothing you can compare with what you can have here i mean i know brother paul is doing a uh he's rebuilding a nice home but there's nothing you can compare that nice home with what we can have over there i was telling last night that i was working in a in a house in tri-cities that you can almost see that the whole tri-cities the house has a nice view indoor pool i mean they have everything they they have the means why not but you know what still that's not nothing you can compare with right guess what the wife got sick even though she has this beautiful house she still got sick she had to go through surgery so even though she had they have all this money of this nice house nice view we still have some oopsies here but when we cross the line yeah never again you know sometimes i feel my back aching when i got there i'll be straight my wife always tell me hey you got it straight up i do when she tells me but then i'll send it's a human nature and this is this body that is i mean going down but inside of you it's an important thing in there that you have to take care of you have to be able to feed the one inside more than the one outside because the more you feed the one the guy outside is more in trouble gets you i know that for fact you know sometimes i ate too many tacos that i can even move i want to go back to work but my body says you know what you have to take a nap but when you feed the spirit you feel lighter and lighter keep feeding the the the white dog right then the jebusites they were people who exploited and polluted others through immoral activities we all know that and god is taking care of his people from the beginning that sometimes we can lose track if we don't follow what he is trying to tell us because the enemy is knows the scriptures better than you and me so he can come and twist it a little bit and use the oh this looks fine that's right a brother does this in this church he's a church very i mean they're succeeding they have a lot of people any brother that they should be okay it's not okay if he's not in the word that's right i don't care who he is i don't care who she is that's right that's what brother brandon always said stick to the word and you come here to hear from the lord but you know what we're still human beings speaking to you we're trying to do our best so god can speak to you you know why we can make mistakes go back home and keep reading the bible because this is like a fire here you put wood sticks here they all if you put them together they're all gonna catch on fire but you pull one of them don't feed him more with fire what's going to happen the fire will go up but that's why you have this this will keep you lighting even though there is a small tiny little light but as long as this this little light is still alive you're still shining and you know what people will see that little light that's right so what do you have there why if you're going through all this and this and this and you're still smiling god is taking care of me imagine job when when he was through all this i think he if he had the chance to hurt that conversation between god and satan they say timeout time out god please hey let's let's talk talk it over why are you dealing with this guy i mean i've been doing all everything you asked for i've been burning sacrifices i've been doing all for my children and you you're making deals here put yourself in job shoes but you know what god was so confident in job that he was willing to test his fidelity and if he has that for me and you bring it on because we know god cares for you god cares for me he's been showing that to me for many years now but he is always necessary to to be tested it's always necessary just to see uh the god can show the enemy says see have you considered my servant so and so and so on soon i i i wanna i want my name there i don't know about you but he's he's taking care of us i want you to go home and believe him even more because this is what uh shaped me a little bit me when when i when i read this and i want to share with you just to just in case you still don't believe me the guy cares for you okay um we know that uh jacob or israel had 12 sons right and uh you know this is what amazes me that we read we read the bible and we see that god deals with with men rather than women but you know what he uses woman to complete his task through a man because i'm gonna start with with with uh the sons of uh jacob i don't know if you wanna if you brought paper and pen you might wanna write down this reuben means behold a son is the eldest son of jacob and leah you can find it in genesis 29 32. simeon means god hears or obeys genesis 29 33 and you know what caught my attention is that jacob didn't name the sons right right amen and you're gonna you're gonna find out why i'm so i mean shake me the second job of of jacob and leah genesis 29 33 he was associated with levi and the tr and the terrible lack of vengeance against hummer and schemi schemites uh levi is uh joined means join amen or adhesion this is the third sound of glia the origin the origin of the name is found in leah's words genesis 29 34 this time will my this time will my husband be joined that's what she said that's why she she named him levi judah means praise the fourth son of jacob and leah the name originated in leah's words of praising the lord and i count as birth now i'll praise jehovah and she called his name genesis 29 35. now the next one was dan which means a judge the fifth son of jacob his mother was bilja rachel's maid genesis 36 guy had judged me that's what she said see jacob never named his sons he was too busy i guess naftali died his struggles or fights my wrestling the sick son of jacob his mother was bilja rachel's handmade genesis 38 verse 8 when jacob went down to egypt naftali had four sons and so on so god fortune or luck jacob's seventh son by silpa leah's handmaid and the brother of usher genesis 30 verse 11 13. usher means happiness this fight is enjoying the sermon he says happy jacob's eight-son his mother was silpa leah's handmade genesis 30 13. ishakar genesis 30 18 god had given me means reward or recompense sybilon in place genesis 30 20. joseph add or increase genesis 30 23 and benjamin son of the right hand the younger son of jacob but rachel genesis 35 18 his birth took place efrata on the road between bethel and bethlehem is a short distance from that his mother died and given birth and with her last breath named him she is still she still named the boy last birth benua benuani son of my pain the name which was changed by his father to benjamin rod son of the right hand last one i say i'm done and i have time to name him so this is important here or interesting here because when you put all the meanings together it goes like this behold a son is born unto us one who hear us and become attached to us praise the lord he judge our struggle he brought us good fortune and happiness he rewarded us by making us his dwelling place is he caring for us and he added us to his family as sons for he is seated at the right hand of the father amen this is not awesome i mean this shake me why because he used a woman and they were fighting all the time i don't know if they were the only ones but but i kind of know that when there is a lot of women together there is always trouble and he had not i'm not talking about these women's here obviously these daughters of god but you know what i work in aspen and uh they call it husband which takes the clean linen and pickups the dirty linen from bedrooms and i have to deal with 13 women at a time and everyone i want these i want that i want every everyone want their supplies so they can finish their job but there was none we were short and they start fighting each other you got this much and you got so i imagine that this was a situation with jacob's wives and even though god used them to put the names on their sons so he can show us these days how much he cares for us i mean if it's not god the same god brother paul like i said he shared a testimony awesome testimony and i heard another testimony from a brother in south africa south america he was as he was a kid his mom was going to church and uh like any young guys or girls they just don't want anything to do with god is the life is boring in church or church or church but he decided to make his way out so he went and and i think was in the amazonas or somewhere in there because he went to the three-day on a boat going up river and they were they were going to fish and when they got there there's they didn't even start fishing when he got his his foot got cut really bad card that he was bleeding badly and really soon he started losing conscience so the other competitors there say let's go back so they took him down and up i think after the first day they saw a little stream joining to the river and on the skirt of that there was a little tiny house and someone with a handkerchief or something like hey hey hey come and come here come here and they approached to him and and they he said hey do you have something to eat i haven't eat the guy who was living there so they shared a little bit what they had and and and he said oh and you guys have someone injured who is it he didn't know anything who is it and the guy was there in the hammock falling almost asleep so he went and kind of slapped him to wake him up say don't don't fall asleep because and his foot was horrible and and he said you're gonna you're gonna have to stay here for three days if not he's gonna die and the guy took him back to his little house there and put some herbs and ointments that he i don't know what it was he did he doesn't know either and he left he didn't summon after that day he didn't side saw him he left the next day he come back do the same thing put some more remedy there and he disappeared so the guys there just by their own just wondering why who is this guy why he disappears third day came he did the same thing and by the third day say tomorrow you're going to be able to leave and when he came back open his wood it was fine so they were able to go home so they went they they went home time went by and the mama said son i want you to come to church tonight say mom i'm too busy i'm making excuses son please this is the last time i'm gonna ask you mama are you sure if you if you promise me you will never bug me again with this i'll go oh i'll promise you son okay here we go so he went there and when he got to the church the pastor start talking to him not knowing anything either and and he said okay um he he said himself say okay if god speaks to me himself i will believe him so this pastor told him say you had this accident this happened and this other happened and and god called you and he's calling you now the testimony is long i'm just going between lines here so this guy the pastor says god help you back there oh no there was a man over there there is no one there oh yeah it was i saw him my body saw him so when he got out of church next day first thing he did he went all the way back to find the guy guess what no one was there not even the stream come into the river someone explained me that brothers and sisters i mean i i we can have a lot of chit chat right but when it comes to the work of the lord if you get this much keep it that's right if you can get this much keep it don't doubt it because god is the same yesterday today and forever i mean this guy is serving the lord now but all of us we don't need to go that route we don't need to cut our feet too to be able to hear the voice of god we have to obey because that's the only thing he requested to the children of israel if you obey my commands stay with them i'll be with you you don't have to worry you don't have to fight you i'm gonna fight for you amen that's right and they saw it many times they saw it exp they lived that experience but still next test came they start whining again we were better than egypt but god help us i think that's it from me today may lord bless you thank you brother brothers and sisters for your patience and like i say if you can take all just take this last part because god has been taking care of his children over there in israel and we are the spiritual children and everything is parallel with the children of israel with our age i mean you see how many arrogant uh armies were there we have arrogant people here not that still but only with god's help we're going we're going to overcome god bless you if you can stand please heavenly father we so grateful father for your love father we thank you for the mercy father i just want to say that we love you and if we do this it's because we love you father and if the people are here father it's because they love you lord i guess i'm not a worthy man to be here and speak or teach something father but if you come and teach us lord so we all can learn father we want to say thank you father please be with this church and your pastor lord that they've been working so hard father to to have what they have father in you and your divine mercy and grace father you gave him this building father we thank you for that we thank you for the confidence of the people and the pastor here father to allow me to speak father and i want to thank you for a faithful why you gave me you know how much she love uh she means to me and how much i love her father and my children and they're with me father you give us the blessing of a daughter lord we thank you for that and all these years i've seen your hand father i'm not i'm not see a lot of dollars in my pocket father but i i see your grace your love and it's all i i need father and i don't need anything else as long as you supply for me father we thank you for the service lord father and us i ask you father so you can speak to the people father so they can be able to put me aside father and they can keep what they you spoke to them [Music] we ask you all these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen i don't know who's next [Music] just a reminder to us god loves us he cares for us amen he's never forsaken us amen you know just thinking as it was i made the little comment when i was sharing the testimony that all this other stuff is just noise if we will get the noise out of our life we'll find that god is speaking to us every single day of our lives amen but satan's doing his best to raise as much noise as much drama as he can so that we get focused to the right to the left and what's behind us oh god help us it'd be my prayer for you for me just get the noise out of our life and know that god is here and he cares for us amen i told myself as i was sitting there i'm not going to preach amen but i just want to tell you saints it's in the simplicity when we start delving into such a deep gospel that we can't understand it we need to stop go back to the simplicity christ in you the hope of glory amen that personal relationship where god made a promise to you i will lead you amen problem is we're always thinking it's somebody else you must be talking to them no you made that promise i will lead you i will guide you i will be with you even in you isn't that beautiful amen let's not let the world detour us let's just stand on that word of god that simplicity amen brother jason where'd you go buddy amen what is there a song uh i i might you know i'm pretty good at like putting two or three songs together but there's a song uh when i saw my name in the book do you know essentially i saw my name in the book do we have the words for that what what would be the title do you know okay brothers if you could look that up amen i'm just excited to know that god allowed you and i to see our name in the book hallelujah you talk about something you know peeking over the little banister of heaven and the book is open and uh if i could just dramatize that to you the book is [Music] amen because you have been given that view that glimpse already hallelujah since i saw my name in the book of redemption since i saw my name

believe you can't have communion with god unless your life is spotless now there's a kind of communion you have to have with god if your life is is messed up you can't go in there and say okay lord you said but yet you can lord you said if i would repent and ask for forgiveness that you would wash me with your blood and then we come to a place we say lord i need healing don't be timid about that

this will go good [Music] hallelujah what a privilege saints we get to dedicate such a beautiful young lady amen my this could get complicated because you see when i first met brother jose uh you know i'm not into cliches but there's that one that people say you know as my brother by a different mother and uh when i first met brother jose actually was uh uh interpreting a service for me uh and uh speaking spanish and there was such a bond that he i got all done with the service and i thought i didn't preach this service actually brother jose preached this service because there was such an anointing there it was like he knew what i was thinking god anointed him to speak that out and ever since then i've just felt a real special bond amen to call my friend i wanted to say this during this service that truly sister sefi is a saint um because uh she if you ever hear the story just ask them how it all is you know when a man sees just a picture of a girl and says i'm marrying her [Music] you you know god's got his hand in this does he not sister sefi you know god's got his hand in this but look at this lovely family these boys are so special to me joey and johnny just uh you know lovely lovely family and god's mercies and grace sister grace is such a sweet girl look at this and she met the ashdown kitty cat yesterday and uh but she is such a sweetheart let's just let's just dedicate her to the lord amen heavenly father lord what a privilege it is to stand lord with saints of light precious faith lord in your presence lord to know that your blessings for us are immeasurable lord to noah's our brother is brought to us today lord you care for us you always have cared for us and you always will care for us lord we just commit little grace to you father may all the days of her life may she be blessed father may your holy spirit be with her lead her guide her father i would ask lord as her brother in christ the lord you would come to her as a little child lord and just place yourself down in her soul seal her father lord to the day of her redemption father be upon her body upon her mind keep them father sacred and holy to you lord we ask for your

of her life may your life be filled with your grace father may she have grace for others and be an example of light father in a world father that's increasingly dark lord keeper in your precious name we pray amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen well you know sometimes we just ask this question isn't it good to be a christian i tell you just beautiful amen i got a home in glory land as brother jose was preaching it just struck me hallelujah how beautiful you think it's good amen you might have a nice house you might live in a nice neighborhood amen a lot of nice things amen speaking of nice things and brother jason looked good in a suit amen hallelujah amen well i got a home over in glory land amen what is the name of that song this i've got a home in glory land oh my that's right we have forgotten brother jason's having a birthday amen he's looking pretty good for getting to be an old guy amen hallelujah well god bless you brother jason amen hallelujah amen [Music] [Music] [Music] in glory land that outshines the sun i've got a hope in glory land that i'll shine the sun away beyond [Music] [Music] remember [Music] well i've got a homing glory land that outshines us on i've got home and glory land that outshines the sun i've got home [Music] oh [Music] remember me [Music] position god called her to she's not hanging back she doesn't say well you know i'll wait to claim that position i'm claiming it now in fact i'll tell you one of the things i regret about my my youth is that when i left the lord i never come back to him for almost 20 years and there's one thing i could change in my life right here today i'd go back to 15 years old and i would serve him with everything i've got within me hallelujah i don't worry about what i possess what this that opportunity is nothing that's the one thing if i could go back i'd be 15 years old again and i would just go ahead and take that one more step and say lord i just completely trust you and i would just serve him with all that is within me hallelujah but what a privilege saints the prophet of god sister jerry and i uh you know my phone's usually dead by about noon because sister jerry sent me about 40 quotes but it's good because the comment and i get to send little things back to her it's actually been a lovely lovely thing that we've got started between us but i tell you what saints when i look at the word she sent me one here the other day i might not get the words right but somebody asked brother branham will the church be shut down he said no she won't be shut down she'll go up hallelujah isn't that beautiful we're not going to be shut down amen they might say well you can't go to church because we got some virus i'm sorry the church is filled with christ and this is the tabernacle amen this is the one that's got to be filled it's not about somewhere else oh so many lovely things in the word of god just keeps pointing us telling us it's coming it's coming it's coming but you see as brother chris preached on wednesday night my brother and sister you see we've got to be patient with god the devil will want us to jump to a conclusion and say but god didn't answer this prayer god must not care i thought it fit very nicely with what brother jose brought today because you see we wait upon the lord and when we're waiting god's molding us he's changing us he's doing a work that nothing else can do amen this world my brother and sister ever notices satan builds them up and then lets them fall apart he gives them fame but gives them and this is one of the beatles made this comment many years ago about we were given fame and that was our problem [Music] god gives you the holy ghost where's the problem there is no problem it's nothing but liberty in jesus christ hallelujah well i tell you what there is a new testament church and she is rising up hallelujah let's sing this before we're dismissed today [Music] as i look out across the land see god's mighty hand a prize adorned in her wedding gown just like in the days of old they stood with courage bowl and turned the [Music] there's a new testament church rising up oh rising up rising up

weaknesses [Music] cute [Music] i'll make it this way before we sing my last song i'd like to sing [Music] i don't care where you've been i don't care what's happened satan likes to dredge little
