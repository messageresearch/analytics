that you would look upon us in favor Lord that you would be well pleased Lord once again we say thank you thank you for your blessings Lord Jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what a lovely presence amen just to be able to come step into that atmosphere to be blessed strengthened filled oh Lord by your your presence amen we definitely want to greet brother Terry sister Shelly and the boys God bless all of you it's so good to see you is Sister Alice and sister Andrea going to be able to come yes Friday wonderful sister April God bless you amen I'm not going to make any Wise Cracks amen just good to see each and everyone here tonight brother Sergey would you come greet the people no oh we don't even have brother Ivan here to drag you up here okay well we're happy to see our brother Sergey here he's been working over on the coast and uh was here to to uh see his son get married and um another addition to the family what a family before it's all over you're going to have so many grandchildren you'll have to have a list amen let's turn in our Bibles I want to speak to you tonight on a topic Lord increase our faith amen not a deep subject but something I believe that we need a reminder of that um you know the the times in our life we we sometimes maybe misunderstand right the prophet of God said everything you need for the rapture I'm paraphrasing this is already in you so we don't need to go looking for Faith but we need to have that ingredient that lets the faith that God placed in US be set free Amen to be able to to take a Holtz of that in our time of need you know we cannot premeditate faith we cannot say I'm going to go out tomorrow and get more faith but God has a way of working in you and I to increase our our faith let's turn in Luke the 17th chapter verses 5 and 6 and then we'll jump to verses 20- 24 and the apostles see I I find this just a beautiful thing because my brother and sister the apostles when Jesus chose the apostles he went and found all the perfect men right no he found people just like you and I and so they still had some doubts some fears some questions of their ability and who they were uh you know as brother Branham says you know they say that the the church was built on Peter brother brandham puts it fairly bluntly when he says why would god build a church on such an unstable man and so we look at this and the Paradox of that the revelation of that is actually we need to look no further than our own lives cuz this is God's Church he's building it on you and I and let's be honest there's times we're unstable but God says don't worry I know how to stabilize you amen aren't you glad of that this evening amen verse Luke 17 5-6 and the apostles said unto the Lord increase our faith and the Lord said if you had Faith as a grain of mustard seed you might say unto this uh sycamine tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you let's move to verse 20 and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation so we are not going to be out here looking around saying oh there it comes there it is here it is right here not with observation neither shall they say Lo here or loow there for behold the kingdom of God is within you now I don't want to get sidetracked here tonight but do you realize that is the seventh seal manifested in you that is the word opened and come to life in you today that we can sit here today and say it is Christ in US amen Christ in you amen amen Revelation or the revealing of the seventh seal it's not a Doctrine my brother and sister it's a relationship it is something that God is revealing to you and I most any person can use the word I'm a Christian but to a real believer he knows that he has that touch or that that gift from God the real believer stands here today the devil will throw darts at you but the real believer in his heart knows that he is a Son of God a daughter of God knows that he has a new birth see a new birth is not just words that we speak it's not like almost a doctrine that we express you have to have a new birth but that's God coming down and revealing himself in us and when that Revelation comes it gives us a a a keeping power a staying power to be able to survive in the most wicked age ever amen when brother brandom preached and said as the God of this evil age those weren't just words he is the God of this evil age but he's not our God cuz this is not our world Amen thank you Lord hallelujah and he said unto the disciples the days will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and you shall not see it and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them for as a lightning that lighten out of one part under Heaven shineth into the other part under heaven so shall it also the son of man be in his day the word shining from Nation to Nation continent continent believer to believer Heavenly Father how we thank you tonight Lord that you would come and father in the hour we live in I I know I've been challenged myself many times Lord I need more faith help me Lord but we must recognize father that we cannot manufacture Faith ourself but Lord you reveal Faith to us and and we as the bride of Christ Sons and Daughters of God we are sitting here to today absolutely helpless father as just a newborn baby father we cannot do anything for ourself father we cannot change our position we cannot change our life but Lord we're totally Reliant and Lord let us come as our lord Jesus said Let It Be unto babes father let us come as babes tonight father fully Lord counting trusting you to move in our lives and reveal father in your power your majesty in the precious name of Jesus Christ we ask this amen you may be seated so as we we put this I just want to reiterate here uh sometimes we've made the seventh seal such a deep topic that no one understands it it can be preached in so many different Fashions and I'm not throwing brother Eugene under the bus but I I just in my my short time there with brother Eugene we would be talking and he would turn to me and he would say brother Paul that's the seventh seal Made Alive and you know is it God it's kind of contagious when you realize that we've made it such a big doctrine that it's got to have all kinds of great majesty and you know as it were lightning in the sky and the sound of thunder and everything and yet you and I living in this day right now overcoming power in this day is the seventh seal manifested now brother brandham uses the words and I just read them this afternoon noon you know that the seventh seal is the coming of Christ I want to ask you is he here amen he is here my brother and sister we're not looking uh at that because you see we'll never see that coming if we don't see this coming and so it's there many are looking off into the far future for for that to be manifested but a Brides already in relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ amen we're not waiting waiting to come into a relationship it's there very much like man and wife uh in the natural my brother and sister you don't wait for the day that you're saying the marriage vow to have a relationship your relationship is already being uh set in stone as it were it's already got a foundation it's already moving forward and you know in the natural we can say I know this is the girl I know this is the man that God has for me amen you don't wait till you standing up here and go you know I I better settle this question and no more that we should wait amen till the other signs you might say of the age or coming to decide whether or not he's our bridegroom or not we have settled that question already amen it should be settled today and so we would say you know uh uh in this day and I I don't know about you I'm trying to break the habit of implying but my brother and sister have you ever come to the place you've said those words Lord increase my faith Lord I need more Faith Lord help my faith amen so these are these are things that Satan has come it's not God coming to you and saying you don't have enough Faith cuz he knows how much faith is in you but it's the devil coming trying to come and and G you get you to doubt to to stop just short of the promise because you're not sure you actually can fulfill the promise but it was never you fulfilling the promise in the beginning it's always been him and it's only him amen the prophet of God said your faith he's speaking himself your faith and my faith with his faith amen will finish the work but as it goes I'm don't have the words perfect But as time goes on your faith and my faith will fade and it will only be his faith amen I should have put that quote in here because it was good it stirred my heart my brother and sister when it comes down to it we have faith and we as Sons and Daughters of God should Proclaim that we have faith it should be part of our testimony but the faith that's going to get us in a Rapture is his faith amen man has all kinds of faith I want you to think about this for just a moment what we were preaching the other day astronaut age my brother and sister imagine uh mankind what kind of confidence they must have in science and in man's ability to build to climb in a capsule and allow it to propel them out in the atmosphere now some say they never really went to the moon they never went here they never went there I don't really care we did watch the machine blast off into outer space so however far they went it takes a special kind of confidence to be able to trust that machine and God wants you and I in a spiritual realm to have that kind of confidence become spiritual astronauts that he by faith can blast us right into the heavenlies amen but if we're not able to grasp that Faith then we will always try to keep ourselves so to speak Earthbound we'll never really want to get too carried away I find it interesting that we see all of these extremes now don't I'm not taking a position don't misunderstand just trying to make a point that we have Extremes in the message now that we're kind of almost going back to an Apostolic Pentecostal type thing with a lot of speaking in tongues and a lot of these things that happen and then we've got this side over here that if you sit in church with him you freeze to death God called for us to be in the middle of all of this the prophet of God said you know be a direct quote you want to look it up he says you know the time of speaking in tongues is over because we've went beyond that not because it was wrong but we went beyond that that's not our sign that's Pentecost sign of that God is present just speak in tongues you got to speak in tongues but God said I've taken you be beyond that into another realm that we can sit here with confidence tonight and know that we are Sons and Daughters of God and he is present with us amen but we would say sometimes I've done it many times myself Lord I need more faith but if we're not careful we get a view that this is almost like a school book lesson and and we'll we'll be like I can study this and then I'll pass the test my brother and sister this is something that is revelation right the prophet of God said faith is a revelation to you and so it's not schoolbook study but yet God expects us to apply ourselves isn't that interesting a lot of difference between having a Works gospel and doing the work amen God wants to see his word working in you and I he doesn't want it to be just a blank page that we study not a blank page but just a a dead letter to study and say okay yeah we've got faith my brother and sister he wants Faith to be manifested in us but he doesn't want us to come to the place that because we did something by faith that we think it's settled amen isn't that interesting and then the prophet of God prophet of God comes and just settles it right down the middle and says here's the balance aren't you glad my brother and sister this message and and don't misunderstand me tonight I I don't know a better way to to say this this message is not all about a prophet amen we needed that Prophet amen and he's come and he did the work that God called him to do and now God has revealed the word In You and I and now we are coming to fruition and we are that living epistle on the Earth today amen aren't you glad I thank God for that I don't need to say now I got to have a a a little deal plus the prophet my brother and sister we have the prophets Words which are God's words we believe that don't we that the prophet's words are God's words amen so we have the word for the day and God's laid it all out before us I've said it before pardon me for saying it again but imagine IM what the message would be like if the prophet was still here we'd never get down on our own knees and pray through we would never be in desperation he would have a waiting list of of people to interview that would be so long it would be impossible to fulfill but God said I gave you the word I gave you even beyond that the technology to uh uh search and find every word yeah amen now take that word and run amen take that word word and fulfill my word for the day because I have given it to you good directions amen here some time back had a little cabinet thing I was putting together out in the garage I don't know who wrote those directions but it said follow this to insert screw F into whole marked X and and all the lines were like this on the and it's like that can't be right but the gospel is not such to those who have eyes and ears but the rest of the world it's a very conf uh confusing uh thing that that we can't follow this through but look at this my brother and sister I'm a little off track here forgive me but but look at this day that we're living in that the godhead is so clear so clear clear to you but not to Dr Leighton flowers it's not clear to him in fact he makes it so complicated that people even comment on his his uh deal saying this doesn't make sense and I'm not speaking down on the man but you see that's what Satan wants it to be he wants the word to be so complicated that Believers just have to blindly follow but the word says I will lead you and guide you so we should be able to reach out and touch our lord Jesus and find the right path we don't have to use LLC whatever this that and the others to do this we don't need to know exactly h h a little study I was doing the other day a man uh I kind of visited this before and just kind of hit on it again and man says until we know all the languages the Bible was spoken we won't understand it well I tell you what my brother and sister the prophet of God left a little nugget in the message for you and I when he says I don't know that very well you know the English and all of that but I know the author I don't have to figure out the answer for myself the author is going to tell me what he wanted to tell me and when the author tells you what's in the book my brother and sister it won't matter language it won't matter wherever it won't matter education amen it's Revelation Hallelujah that God brings that and lays it out so clearly before us so this is not a schoolbook lesson Romans 10:7 says so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God and I believe every one of us here tonight can say thank you Lord and amen to that because we have heard and understood and it had nothing to do with IQ and I'm not speaking down on myself but I'm really glad that it doesn't because if it was Boy some of us would just be are hurt no I won't say some of you I would be really hurting I don't want to to be misunderstood so you see this hearing is not of the natural ear this hearing is actually we're hearing it in our soul we're hearing it in our heart the word is speaking to us it resonates and we know that it's true truth don't we need an element of Truth to have faith you can't have faith in something you know is false so you see long before we were able to actually say this message is true God was already working in you might be before you ever sat down on a church pew or uh maybe owned or opened a Bible whatever the circumstance might be God was already working on us to build the foundation for Faith to be expressed now if you don't think that means something my brother and sister I want you to go back through your own life for a while and think about where you was at and where you were headed and that when you heard the truth there was something in you that said I can believe that something in you said I can trust that something in you said I can follow that amen that was God already planting a seed amen and he brought it to fruition and when you heard you didn't hear with your ears you heard with your soul and you knew this was true now in the sermon things that are to be uh brother brandham uh preaches this this right here at the end of his ministry no one knew at the time that they were in there and he was speaking these words that it was just a little short matter of time and he would be gone from the scene and so is it is he says Jesus Christ is by faith not what you can scientifically prove but what you believe so faith is entirely a belief are you with me I hope you make the connection back to what we had already said but what you believe I can't scientifically prove you tonight in this building that there is a God but yet I know he's here and I want to say that this applies tonight amen we know he he is here amen but by my faith vindicates it now I love that when people you know approach the prophet and they said well I don't believe that brother brandham and brother brandham comes back some people in this very emotionally conscious day that we live in would have been mortally offended when brother brandham said well it's not for you it's only for believers they they would have they would have just this day and age they would melt down on the spot I'm a Believer have you to know I've been this that and the other my family has for a hundred years what's it got to do with it hospital room the prophet speaks to the lady and she says I'll have you to know see my brother and sister no connection see they're not hearing it right with a soul they're hearing it intellectually in a mind and it doesn't produce enough respect now get this it doesn't produce enough respect even in them to honor common decency right all they're caring about themselves you're bothering me with all this talk about God and the Holy Ghost I can tell you that Spirit hasn't died right that spirit's still around Abraham could not scientifically prove to you that he was going to have a baby by uh to that woman and he her nearly a hundred years old but his faith confirmed it see don't need any scientific proof see we're living in a day my brother and sister that people are demanding if I'm going to believe this message I need proof well I tell you my brother and sister the proof is not out there the proof is in here amen the proof is in the life that God gives to you and I amen so people are looking for proof to prove that God is real but yet a bride of Christ knows her husband is real just as tonight we could those of you couples sitting together amen could just reach right over touch your husband and say I know my husband's real don't tell me he's not but you see this bride of Christ she knows her bridegroom is real doesn't need some scientific proof my brother and sister remember when the Apollo went up into to uh uh space or whatever and you know there was such a controversy when one of those uh astronauts made something and and later he clarified and said that's actually not what I said they took what I said and they Twisted it but they took the words and said that he said that I don't see God anywhere and he said I I believed in in Jesus Christ I was not declaring there was no God here but they Twisted the words that he was speaking because you see the God that was there and the moon and the Apollo Landing the same God here was there and the same God that was with the prophet is here and the same God that spoke to the prophet is speaking to you amen but you see they want proof that this is taking place my brother and sister I tell you we all have proof we're not perfect my I'd be scared if somebody ever thought I was saying I was perfect um it it's just not so but a perfect God has redeemed me amen a perfect God has called me a perfect God has healed me and a perfect God has revealed himself to us see it never was about how perfect we was look God coming down now he had a plan for the Apostle Paul but look how God come here's Apostle Paul on a mission you might say he was commissioned by the church to go disband another group of Christians and so in that frame of mind in that kind of circumstance why would God ever choose a man with murder on his mind but he did and then God turned it around and showed that this was so real that that same man laid his head on the Block and they cut his head off from the murderer to the murdered by Revelation now we can type that my brother and sister for for the one who intellectually understands and believes he knows what God wants to the one who has died to himself to fulfill what God wants let us be the second Amen Let us be that Hallelujah didn't need scientific proof the doctor said the old man is crazy out there saying he going to have a baby by that woman 100 years old and her 90 but you see God said so so it didn't take science it takes Faith to believe God's word not science now I I'm I don't want to focus on that I I I don't want to get sidetracked here but I tell you a lot of naysayers around the message they're coming from a scientific educated mindset to say this is flawed well I tell you what man's hands are flawed but God's hands are perfect and when God uses man's hands if you look at the flaw that's all you'll see but if you look at that man as God using his hands it will be perfect amen but you'll find also that that man that God uses his hands his feet amen never boasts never says this is mine I did this he gives the credit to Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah isn't that beautiful amen so I want to just interject about this time right here I'm wondering if we have a true Revelation or understanding of what faith is amen not criticizing no one not trying to cut anything down but you see I think a lot of people have an understanding that faith is you doing something and that you're going to know you can do that something but yet there's scriptural foundation for that because the word says I can do all things by myself no that's can do all things through Christ Jesus see so what's Faith actually kind of be trust tied to trust we're believing that in Jesus Christ in Jesus Christ are you with me in Jesus Christ we can do all things we can overcome the spirit of leoo which is the darkest Spirit of all the ages and every deception and every trick is there and we know that Jesus said I'll take you through the darkest and darkest and darkest of time and I will lead you and bring you right out of that into a Rapture and I will declare are you perfect at that place now look if we rely on faith as we would look at it in a human element we would not even see how we could get through this age did you catch what I just said we wouldn't be able to see how we got through this age but you see faith is already working in you it didn't come with a neon sign it didn't come with a great exclamation faith is already working in you because we are here tonight and I believe I can say this in in full confidence we already see the end my brother and sister if it wasn't for faith in us activated coming to pass we wouldn't even be able to see the end but we see the end and we are see ourselves as Victorious you see the faith we keep looking for is already working in us it's already present yeah Faith does not mean great magnificent works that are broadcast and almost boasted over faith is the fact we read the word and say Amen to it and God allows us to take a Hal of that and by faith just like Abraham by Faith by faith we take a hold of that word that we read or heard and we step forward and it changes Our Lives my brother and sister Faith's already moving in the bride Faith's already causing her to come to a place that she realizes she's not of this Earth that she is of the word she is the word amen she's not just got a name out here she is Mrs Jesus Christ she's claiming her position by faith amen that's right CU do you have one physical evidence that you're the bride of Christ but who are we Faith working in US is showing us who we are not us by intellect understanding reasoning studying but it's by faith we read the word and something inside of us says that's who I am the word is there and and it says you know I can do all things and we look at this word and we can say you know what I I I'm not looking to be a bungee jumper or you know this that or the other I I'm not worried about all of that stuff out there I I I know who I am I know who I am I know what I can do where did that confidence come from Faith right faith that we we don't even look at it like I had Faith to believe we didn't believe it's his belief that he placed in us that's bringing us into the presence of the word and the word is Chang changing us oh my brother and sister sometimes I think we need to simplify things to get over the complicated things about faith you know I just I don't encourage you to do it don't waste your time but you know there's about two zillion books out there about faith and you know they they all you know tell you you need to do this you need to do that you'll have more faith if this you'll have more faith with that my brother and sister what we need to do is go back to the word and let him in word form reveal the faith that's already in us there's no perfect formula for some it takes you through fiery trials to just reveal that Faith others by God's grace have a little something happen in their life and and it opens up to them and you say wow you know they got faith they got good faith and it doesn't seem like they've had a struggle to get it yeah they had a struggle my struggle was just different than your struggle right because every one of us is going to be tested by the word amen you know there comes a point in time that we just have to Simply trust God Amen now and souls that are in prison now brother Brown says this but remember all this time Noah was in the ark the bride I want you to just follow a catch this brother Brown's tying us right back it's connecting it right back this is not something new this is the word being manifested in our day but he's already opened this word nothing new Under the Sun Noah is in the ark the bride is sealed in with Christ the last member had has been redeemed some people don't believe that let me throw a little twist to those words whether that person knows they're redeemed or not they're already redeemed we get this idea that it's the point that this guy finally quit struggling against the word and come and surrender to the Lord oh yes then he's redeemed I'm sorry my brother and sister God is infallible in his work he cannot lie he cannot change his mind and so the very last soul that is going to be to be in the Rapture is already redeemed the price already paid we ought to be treating everybody in the world like they were that last one amen last member has been redeemed the six seal has produced itself the seventh seal brings him back to Earth now many people take this quote right here and say the seventh seal won't be fulfilled until the coming of Christ what's living in you theology a book of dos and don'ts a church age book Christ he's fulfilled that word but he said he would do it so secretive so silently that the World wouldn't even know and they're sitting there still looking for a christ to come come back on the earth and he's already come he's already redeemed a people and they're standing there today with a confidence that Christ is in them alive and well and it's not your flesh any longer it's his flesh it's his hands it's his feet it's his mouth nose ears mind and soul sitting here today you see now the whole Redemption process I I won't go into it tonight I got I got a whole bunch of other things but the whole Redemption process my brother and sister God allowed it allowed it to play out for us humans humans here I just got on a website today for for uh that we order parts off of and you know it always does this little thing you click here you click there and then it does this deal and says checking to see if you're human how does a computer know I'm human I don't touch the keyboard I don't touch the mouse I don't do nothing and all of a sudden it says oh you're human I think they're fooling themselves but you see my brother and sister what happens is God brings you and I through that same uh process if you can say every single day checking to see if your bride the word will never leave you from the word it can't do it so it's not like God testing to see if somehow you've changed over the day but you see he's just looking at you there's the word there's the word there's the word we are the word amen amen that ought to be enough to call some of us all of us every one of us to jump and Shout amen hallelujah the seven seal brings him back to Earth the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand of him and sat down and claimed what he owned what he had redeemed so at that point right there everything was redeemed not looking to the day that I went to an altar I got baptized da da da my brother and sister that's not the day you were already in him and he's declaring it that's right it's always been that third pole three is perfection the ministry come to its perfection when it reproduced Christ again in natural amongst human beings that's right my my brother and sister it come to Perfection at that point now forgive me to Branch just a little bit and we're still out here trying to be perfect and God said it's already taken place it's already a finished work oh I'm just trying to the best message believer to be perfect help me I made it oh you know I did oh no trust him trust him it's come what is the ministry there some would say it's a five-fold Ministry but it's the ministry of Jesus Christ because that's what the five-fold ministry is is actually a Ministry of Jesus Christ they're not a separate entity that's why it's hard to understand the Warfare that there is against the five-fold ministry there there there is an open attack against the five-fold ministry and and they act like that's some kind of separate entity but you see what they're doing is looking at the screen and saying ah it's just a human but God doesn't look at it that way God says that was my word that's myself that's right and that's what the bride will see the bride won't see a bunch of men cuz you know I've already stuttered and sputtered tonight I I wouldn't make it in some of those churches I I wouldn't make it you know they'd say this guy's not culturally sound we're proud of that aren't we brother Terry not culturally sound not going to tell on Jerry but I'm going to tell on Jerry there's a brother that we love very much and she'd happened to uh see a deal where he was preaching and she tells me she says I don't know what to think Paul his his collar's crooked and his TI is pulled off to one side you know just didn't you know just need a signal or something you know the problem is my brother and sister that's not the Revelation we're looking for the re ation is Christ in his word and so this ministry of Jesus Christ is coming to Perfection it reproduced Christ again in amongst human beings as were predicted as it was in the days of lot see how beautiful this is it's not a deep complex thing for us to dig in and have to research this of how we're going to get more faith I'll tell you how we get more faith we die we die out to ourself that Christ can be revealed amen that's where our faith will be revealed at the more that we die not the more that we know the more that we die the more of Christ will be seen in this flesh amen I I just you know encourage on that I'm not trying to oversimplify this but I think sometimes we made it over complicated how are we going to teach don't you think that if there was a way to us to faith that God would have led the prophet to preach that would have had a sermon how to get more faith but what did he say it's already in you there's what the prophet taught us it's already in you die that it might be revealed amen you love the Lord sister Ruth would you come amen Revelations 22:17 and the spirit and the bride say come anybody got a voice to say come tonight let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely we're here tonight Saints let's take it freely let's not be stingy let's not sit back and say Well when the Lord gives me more faith you need to start saying I have the faith to overcome every obstacle every Spirit of this age I have the faith now Lord help me to die that that faith can be revealed amen you love the Lord hallelujah hallelujah let's stand 487 brother Chris brother Chris recently preached back in uh BCF and um it's talking about the Battle within my brother and sister that battle's never going away don't think that you'll be perfect and ready for the Rapture when that battle has completely ceased the battle's there but God's already said you've overcome the battle let's believe what the word said amen to overcome the battle we need to it was already in that earlier quote we need to believe yes you mean if I believe I have more faith test it and see test it and see you'll find the more you believe and commit the more faith you'll have see that's what's happened to people why they're not they're they're falling away from the message they're falling away is because they're actually natural reaction they fall away and they have less understanding less Faith which causes them to fall away and then they have less understanding and less L Faith which causes them to fall away my brother and sister let me type it to you as I close when the serpents were in the wilderness all they had to do all we have to do is look and live we don't have to explain what's happening we don't need to explain why those serpents were even at that spot in the wilderness we don't have to explain how a Brazen serpent could cause that action to take place actually not one bit of physical contact just look and live amen Lord help us to look in the word and live amen God bless you
