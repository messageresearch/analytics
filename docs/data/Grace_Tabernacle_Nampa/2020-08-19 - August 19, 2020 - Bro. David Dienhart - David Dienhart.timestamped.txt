[30:23] god bless you you can thank you for the
[30:26] songs
[30:28] it's a joy to be here tonight and to
[30:30] express
[30:31] the love of god amen express him
[30:35] that's what the bride is here to do her
[30:38] ministry is the son of man
[30:40] she has no other ministry her ministry
[30:43] is christ
[30:44] amen outside of that there's not not no
[30:47] church
[30:47] no this no group none that her all in
[30:51] all is christ
[30:52] everything is christ the all in all is
[30:54] christ
[30:55] that's what she lives for that's what
[30:57] she's we just say it simply is what she
[31:00] breathes for
[31:01] is to express christ in this hour and
[31:03] god has ordained her as individuals
[31:06] to do just that she's ordained to do it
[31:09] right
[31:09] it may not be in the way we think it may
[31:11] be unusual and out of the ordinary
[31:14] but if it goes with the word it's got to
[31:16] be christ it has to be with the word
[31:19] amen it's not a not here to agree with
[31:22] our theology or our thinking
[31:24] it's not uh our our understanding is not
[31:27] our absolute it's not the bride's
[31:28] absolute
[31:30] how we feel how we don't feel that's not
[31:32] the bride's absolute
[31:33] bride's absolute is christ in her god's
[31:36] god's uh great revelation
[31:40] amen and i'm so thankful for that
[31:42] tonight i don't know of anything else to
[31:44] be more thankful for
[31:45] but to know i'm ready to have a body
[31:48] change
[31:49] amen that's that's the great thing to
[31:51] know that you know
[31:52] you're in him and he's in you if you
[31:55] don't know that tonight i invite you to
[31:57] know it
[31:58] because if there's a desire in you for
[32:00] him there's him to get
[32:01] to to satisfy the desire amen if there's
[32:05] a deep calling to the deep there's got
[32:06] to be a deep to respond to that call
[32:09] and there is right here tonight he's in
[32:12] our midst
[32:13] amen amen and he's here to do the
[32:15] exceeding and abundantly above all that
[32:17] we could ask or think
[32:19] if we just realize that and realize he
[32:22] wants to do for you
[32:23] just simply take him at his word and
[32:25] don't accept no other opinion
[32:27] don't accept your reasoning about it
[32:29] take what he said
[32:31] amen and use the faith that god put in
[32:33] you his own faith
[32:35] amen amen what god reveals to you is
[32:38] yours
[32:39] what god makes known to you have a right
[32:41] to act on it
[32:42] amen because we just shall live by
[32:46] faith amen faith is a revelation
[32:50] amen if you'll stand with me and like to
[32:53] take the book of starting out with the
[32:55] revelations chapter 3
[33:00] and we're going to speak on the genuine
[33:02] evidence of the holy ghost
[33:04] in you amen
[33:07] the genuine evidence there is a genuine
[33:11] evidence you hear people say oh there's
[33:12] no certain evidence i beg your pardon
[33:14] it's been laid out perfectly what the
[33:16] evidence of the holy ghost is
[33:18] amen so we we we have a genuine
[33:22] not just a make-believe not just a hope
[33:24] so not a theological understanding of
[33:26] what the holy ghost is
[33:28] there's a genuine evidence of the holy
[33:30] ghost amen
[33:31] and i trust that this will encourage you
[33:34] to press
[33:35] toward the mark for the prize for the
[33:37] high calling you know the bride has a
[33:39] high calling you know that
[33:40] she has a very high calling and we're
[33:43] pressing toward the mark for the
[33:44] reward of that high calling it's not
[33:47] that we want reward but he promised
[33:49] reward
[33:50] amen and as our brother paul would have
[33:52] said many times his ministry
[33:53] just to hear him say it was well done my
[33:55] good and faithful servant is all the
[33:57] reward i need
[33:59] amen just to know he's pleased just to
[34:02] know that
[34:03] and you know i can't please him without
[34:05] faith the bible said faith is the
[34:07] evidence
[34:10] of things hoped for i mean the evidence
[34:12] of things not seen
[34:13] faith is the evidence amen
[34:16] amen and the real believer has god's
[34:19] faith
[34:20] amen revelations 3 and 22
[34:24] he that's an individual i want you to
[34:27] never forget that the bride is called as
[34:29] individuals
[34:30] it's not called as a group it's called
[34:32] as an individual brother branham may
[34:34] refer to a bride as a group
[34:36] but the group is made up of individuals
[34:38] and so it's it's individuals that god
[34:40] calls it's
[34:41] it's between you and god he doesn't
[34:44] he doesn't make it a group revelation it
[34:48] is a
[34:48] individual revelation and god identifies
[34:52] himself
[34:53] in that individual and that's what you
[34:55] must have to make a rapture
[34:57] amen you must have the identification of
[35:00] himself and you
[35:02] recognizing your faith has been received
[35:05] as his faith
[35:06] amen now that can only be to a certain
[35:09] group and we'll get into that in just a
[35:11] minute
[35:12] and that group is a very special group
[35:15] you say well who do you think we are i'm
[35:17] the wife of jesus christ
[35:18] that's exactly who i am that's a very
[35:21] special position
[35:22] that is a a sovereign position under
[35:25] headship
[35:27] did you hear what i said it's a
[35:29] sovereign position
[35:30] don't leave out this part under headship
[35:33] amen amen all right so
[35:37] so here again verse 22 he that hath
[35:41] not he that doesn't have
[35:44] he that hath an ear why brother david
[35:48] everybody has ears but that's not what
[35:49] he's talking about here our physical ear
[35:52] everybody can hear the word we can we
[35:54] can hear it preach we can hear it but
[35:55] what is it doing
[35:57] to you what effect does it have on you
[36:02] he that hath an ear to hear an ear let
[36:05] him he that hath an
[36:06] ear let him hear
[36:10] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[36:14] now in every church age that's repeated
[36:16] at the end he that hath an ear
[36:18] in that church age he the individuals
[36:20] that hath an ear to receive it
[36:22] he that hath an ear in the ear to hear
[36:25] i'm
[36:26] saying to hear as we'll find out means
[36:28] to receive it
[36:29] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[36:32] the spirit saith
[36:33] to the churches amen you may be seated
[36:36] i'll just read that one scripture but i
[36:38] have several more here so turn with me
[36:40] to john 8
[36:42] start out here saint john 8.
[36:50] it's been a good fight of faith today
[36:53] satan has done everything
[36:54] he could to stop this meeting to hinder
[36:56] me from getting here
[36:58] everything from a closed down printer to
[37:00] a whatever
[37:01] but accidents in the middle of the road
[37:04] blocked our way
[37:05] and all kinds of things but but god's
[37:08] right on time
[37:10] and i say it's a good fight of faith
[37:13] every day is a good fight of faith not a
[37:16] bad fight
[37:18] we are in a fight i guess you know we
[37:20] are in a fight
[37:21] we are not on a picnic we are not on a
[37:23] holiday
[37:24] we are pressing toward the mark for the
[37:26] prize of the high calling christ you're
[37:28] not going to just get it
[37:29] casually you're going to have to press
[37:30] into it
[37:32] and pressing means a daily dying out to
[37:35] yourself
[37:36] and taking up your cross and following
[37:39] the word
[37:41] amen it takes a daily feeding it takes
[37:44] daily prayer
[37:47] now just pray because you but a love
[37:50] affair between you and christ
[37:52] amen amen john 8
[37:57] and the 43rd verse
[38:00] why do you not understand my speech
[38:03] here's here's
[38:04] jesus speaking to these sadducees
[38:06] pharisees
[38:08] ones that would call him the devil and
[38:10] he already told him you're
[38:11] you're the you're he said we're not born
[38:14] a fornication
[38:15] why would they think that right
[38:18] we're not the opposite we're not the
[38:20] other seed well jesus says right here
[38:23] he said he said why do you not
[38:26] understand my
[38:27] speech in other words my words what i'm
[38:29] speaking why do you not understand my
[38:31] speech
[38:32] even because you cannot hear my word
[38:36] well they all had ears so it's a
[38:39] different kind of hearing isn't it
[38:43] amen and so then we find out in the 47th
[38:46] verse he that is of god
[38:49] this is really potent but he that is of
[38:52] god
[38:54] heareth god's words you want to know
[38:57] what the evidence is
[39:00] amen see we could just say amen and go
[39:02] home because there's the evidence
[39:04] but we're going to bring out some more
[39:06] things in the evidence here
[39:08] he that is of god anybody of god here
[39:11] how do you know
[39:13] who told you how do you know
[39:16] you're of god
[39:21] brother branham asks a similar question
[39:25] if i could just interject this right in
[39:26] here don't know how god would take this
[39:33] he said well here brother branham
[39:36] if it he said you might read the bible
[39:38] and say well here brother brown the
[39:40] bible says this that's true that's
[39:42] exactly right that's where people say
[39:43] today well i believe jesus christ
[39:45] is the son of god and i'm saved
[39:50] how do you know he's the son of god
[39:56] the bible said so bill graham said see
[39:59] question mark and i say
[40:03] well how do you know he's the son of god
[40:06] mother said so preacher said so they
[40:10] just said the bible said so
[40:14] see it takes more than just an
[40:15] intellectual reading of the scriptures
[40:18] we've got to ask for revelation and if
[40:21] the spirit lives in you he's already
[40:23] promised
[40:24] that he would reveal his word to you
[40:27] and you can't receive revelation you
[40:29] can't see the things of god in the word
[40:32] until you receive the spirit of that
[40:33] word in you
[40:35] i'm going to make that very blunt that's
[40:37] as blunt as i can say it right
[40:40] you will never under you will never
[40:41] receive the message nor know what the
[40:43] message is saying
[40:45] without the spirit of this message
[40:46] dwelling in you
[40:49] and without jesus christ in you
[40:52] you'll never see your position or the
[40:54] revelation contained in those seals
[40:56] or the the message of the hour
[41:01] amen are you with me so see it's a must
[41:06] amen there's only one thing it's going
[41:08] to allow god's going to see today and
[41:09] only
[41:10] there's only there's only there's only
[41:12] one there's one thing he expects
[41:15] one thing he's looking at it's not your
[41:17] church affiliation
[41:19] it's not your group affiliation
[41:23] amen he requires the token
[41:29] he requires his own life to be seen in
[41:31] you
[41:33] and you can't do that in your own self
[41:35] you can't get enough religion to do that
[41:38] you can't get enough message religion to
[41:40] do that
[41:41] you can't belong to enough message
[41:42] churches to do that
[41:45] i don't care what affiliations and how
[41:46] many books and tapes you've got
[41:49] is it revealing itself in you
[41:52] is it coming off of the books and the
[41:54] tapes and is it becoming flesh in you
[41:56] that's the question
[42:00] how do you know he said mother said
[42:03] well they're right how do you know the
[42:06] bible said you cannot know until you
[42:08] have received the holy ghost
[42:10] you're only taking somebody else's word
[42:13] other words you have a
[42:14] second handed religion
[42:17] we don't want a second-handed religion
[42:20] can you turn this
[42:21] this this down just a little bit i feel
[42:23] like i'm blasting myself out maybe it'll
[42:25] help me i don't maybe let me speak a
[42:27] little softer
[42:30] i don't need to speak a little softer i
[42:31] want liberty to speak like i want to
[42:33] speak
[42:35] forgive me a little bit flesh there
[42:38] anyway
[42:39] all right but let's go back here what
[42:41] he's saying you're only taking somebody
[42:43] else's word
[42:45] but that's the truth quote it no man can
[42:47] say jesus is the christ
[42:49] he said what is that what's the truth he
[42:51] said quote it tell him quote it
[42:52] no man can say jesus is the christ only
[42:55] by the holy ghost
[43:00] think of that you say jesus is lord
[43:02] jesus is my lord how do you know
[43:07] these are tough questions but they're
[43:09] easy questions
[43:11] you know because god's revealed it to
[43:13] you if it's not revealed to you don't
[43:15] know
[43:17] and without the holy ghost
[43:20] you can't know it
[43:23] because he said what he would do when
[43:25] the holy spirit would come he would
[43:26] reveal his word to you
[43:30] i'm going to come to that now i'm not
[43:32] just pulling that out of the air out
[43:34] here
[43:35] all right all right so we're see you're
[43:38] only taking what the you're
[43:40] you're taking son of god
[43:43] or you're see the holy ghost has to bear
[43:46] record
[43:47] to the resurrection and jesus being the
[43:49] son of god or you're only taking
[43:51] somebody else's word for it you're only
[43:53] taking what the bible
[43:54] you're only taking what the bible said
[43:57] and he said the bible is right
[43:59] or only taking what the minister says
[44:01] the minister's right
[44:02] or some other good person said they're
[44:05] right but you
[44:06] as an individual doesn't know that jesus
[44:09] is the christ until the holy ghost has
[44:11] brought it to you
[44:14] amen amen
[44:18] that's right he must be in
[44:21] you living right now he must be abiding
[44:25] in you
[44:28] amen see see
[44:32] our brother paul pastor brought the word
[44:34] to us the other building up in your most
[44:36] holy faith praying in the holy ghost
[44:40] but without the holy ghost how are you
[44:42] going to pray in the holy spirit
[44:44] how are you going to pray in the holy
[44:45] ghost if you don't have the holy ghost
[44:51] that's right because it said praying in
[44:53] in underline inn
[44:57] amen if we walk in the light as he is in
[44:59] the light
[45:02] god is light and in him and in him is no
[45:04] darkness so if you're in him
[45:06] you're not walking in darkness you're
[45:08] walking in light
[45:12] amen if you're walking with god you're
[45:15] walking in light
[45:18] amen you're walking in the light to walk
[45:20] with god is to walk in the light
[45:22] and the light is the promised word for
[45:24] the day
[45:26] revealed amen
[45:30] the life of god manifested in you the
[45:32] word of god opened in you
[45:34] is the light that makes you the light
[45:37] of the hour amen
[45:41] amen all right now because light is life
[45:44] and the life manifested is the light
[45:49] light brings life and the life
[45:51] manifested is what
[45:52] light all right
[45:56] i'm not talking about human life i'm
[45:57] talking about christ's own life
[46:01] so it's not just a criteria we come to
[46:05] it's not an imagination it's not some
[46:07] feeling
[46:08] amen the new birth is not that
[46:11] is a absolute direct revelation of jesus
[46:14] christ in you
[46:18] amen that's what he said he would build
[46:21] his church on
[46:22] and there you grow up
[46:25] you're built on that foundation of the
[46:26] revelation you wonder why i say you must
[46:29] be born again
[46:30] there is no other criteria to this
[46:34] what if what if we what what if we knew
[46:36] that there was no one else
[46:38] coming in
[46:41] what would you think about that and the
[46:43] prophet said it very well could be that
[46:45] we don't know but i say if there's even
[46:48] a little
[46:49] pull of christ pulled for christ in you
[46:51] and you don't know
[46:52] you don't know you do not know that
[46:54] revelation the
[46:56] new birth is jesus christ opened
[46:59] revealed unveiled in you
[47:01] the secret is known it's manifested
[47:07] it's a revelation christ in you
[47:12] it's not a hope it's not a it's a
[47:14] revelation
[47:17] you know he's in you
[47:20] i'm selling about something you know
[47:24] not something you hope you have it's
[47:26] something you know you say brother david
[47:28] what do you mean
[47:29] it ought to bring you to desperation
[47:31] every young person in here every person
[47:33] if you don't know that
[47:35] it's time you got very desperate if
[47:38] you've got even a smidgen of desire for
[47:40] god in you
[47:45] hallelujah
[47:48] yes i i'm not afraid to talk direct
[47:52] amen i'm not afraid to tell you what the
[47:54] truth is i'm not doing that to be
[47:56] arrogant
[47:57] i'm doing that because i love you and i
[47:59] love this word
[48:03] amen and i am like you i need him every
[48:07] moment of every day
[48:09] i've got to die to myself take up my
[48:11] cross jesus said deny yourself that
[48:13] means
[48:14] death to self deny or die to yourself
[48:18] and take up that death
[48:20] of your own self and and get rid of it
[48:22] and take the word and take it as your
[48:24] absolute and walk forward
[48:26] with that word revealed in you that
[48:28] faith in you cannot and will not
[48:30] disbelieve the word
[48:33] and god has got god is calling for
[48:35] weaklings today
[48:37] strong in faith god is calling for
[48:40] weaklings in yourself know at nothing's
[48:42] so he can work through you that you come
[48:44] to a complete
[48:45] total dependency on him you become a
[48:48] weakling that's the only way god can
[48:50] work
[48:50] he was crucified in weakness so his
[48:52] resurrection would prove his power
[48:58] it was without he had to go forth he had
[49:00] to die as a man
[49:02] he had to be a man he had to be weak
[49:09] hallelujah god requires
[49:12] weaklings perfect strength by
[49:16] perfect weakness
[49:19] okay i don't want to get sidetracked
[49:20] here but that's a very good track to
[49:22] follow
[49:25] because until you come to that place
[49:26] you've still got something of yourself
[49:28] in the way
[49:29] and as long as you're in the way god's
[49:30] out of the way
[49:33] amen and every one of these challenges
[49:35] every one of these
[49:36] every one of these trials every one of
[49:38] these things we go through is to
[49:39] pull out what he put in you have himself
[49:42] to pull out that character
[49:44] don't you despise don't you try to
[49:46] subjugate the
[49:47] the the testings and the trials and say
[49:50] oh i don't have
[49:51] i don't have to suffer oh yes you do
[49:56] to say you don't is contrary to the word
[50:00] it's contrary to what the prophet even
[50:02] said
[50:04] he said a church that's not suffering
[50:06] doesn't have it
[50:10] you see do you want suffering no i don't
[50:11] want suffering but i say god give me
[50:13] grace to go through it
[50:14] and take a hold of your word in those
[50:16] circumstances and glorify you by taking
[50:18] the word and believing the word
[50:20] hallelujah hallelujah
[50:24] god loves to test his people he loves to
[50:27] bring out he's doing it for a purpose he
[50:29] does nothing
[50:30] as a frustration he does it with purpose
[50:34] life is meant the prophet said to be
[50:37] a struggle
[50:41] and quit your put your face in these
[50:43] psychological books
[50:45] that tell you don't have to
[50:50] you're working contrary to the word you
[50:53] see i got the holy ghost and work
[50:54] contrary to his word
[50:55] it can't be the holy ghost working in
[50:57] you
[51:00] because he isn't going to work and he's
[51:01] not going to lead you away from his word
[51:05] and you can have all kinds of sensations
[51:07] you can have you can shout and do all
[51:09] you want to do and that spirit realm of
[51:11] that second realm
[51:12] that second realm could be anointed and
[51:14] still not have the word in the third
[51:16] realm
[51:17] of the soul that's where you've got to
[51:21] meet him
[51:21] as on the inside the inside
[51:26] you must break through that veil into
[51:29] the word itself
[51:30] into the shekinah brother braham said
[51:32] break into the spirit and see where you
[51:35] are
[51:36] at unveiling of god he said break into
[51:39] the spirit
[51:41] and see where you're at break into the
[51:42] shekinah glory and come face to face
[51:45] with who you are
[51:46] break into the shekinah glory and see
[51:48] where you're standing
[51:51] then you'll realize the real you is on
[51:53] the inside the real you is the holy
[51:55] ghost
[51:56] when you're praying and you speak you're
[51:58] praying in the spirit you're singing in
[52:00] the spirit you're praying in the spirit
[52:02] and speaking his name
[52:03] it is the holy ghost in you praying
[52:06] that's the real you
[52:08] that unveiled work that revelation of
[52:10] the word in you
[52:12] is the true believer
[52:18] that is exactly what he said in perfect
[52:21] faith he said
[52:22] that real faith that faith that faith
[52:24] inside of you he said that faith in you
[52:27] is the believer he said that's god's
[52:30] faith
[52:31] that's god's own faith hallelujah
[52:34] what is it the revelation of the word of
[52:37] promise for the season
[52:42] who's going to see these things who's
[52:45] going to be the ones to receive it those
[52:47] that have an ear to hear
[52:48] what the spirit says
[52:53] hallelujah all right so you don't get it
[52:56] by just
[52:57] reading i know i'm i'm not discouraging
[53:00] from reading
[53:01] but you ought to be laying in the
[53:02] messages too along with reading your
[53:04] bible
[53:05] because god sent a prophet to bring out
[53:07] what the bible said
[53:10] and without a prophet you're not going
[53:11] to get what he said
[53:14] there's promises laying hid in that word
[53:16] that had to be unveiled in this
[53:18] hour and without god sending a prophet
[53:20] and separating himself to a prophet
[53:22] and bringing the word of life through
[53:23] that prophet you will never see what's
[53:25] in the word
[53:26] you cannot make it by reading the bible
[53:28] alone
[53:32] you see that's a tough quote but that's
[53:34] why god sent a prophet to tell you
[53:36] what's in that bible
[53:37] that's why he sent it to you and without
[53:39] that you'll never get a true divine
[53:41] revelation
[53:42] don't you try to put your own opinion to
[53:44] what that prophet said
[53:45] leave it alone if you don't understand
[53:47] it leave it alone
[53:50] don't go off and put your opinion to it
[53:54] god don't mean mine you don't need your
[53:55] opinion
[53:58] let god reveal his word amen
[54:01] amen he already promised you do it
[54:05] be careful who you're influenced by
[54:08] devils and wolves stand around the
[54:11] outskirts of where the eagles are fed
[54:14] where the carcass is they can't get to
[54:16] it but they'll try to bring
[54:17] somebody else under their wing and
[54:19] influence you away from the word
[54:21] be careful the holy ghost will deserve
[54:24] those things
[54:25] and if you can't desert it there's
[54:26] something missing
[54:33] amen you'll see all we ought to just be
[54:36] fellowshipping with everybody that's not
[54:38] according to the word
[54:44] amen we just don't we just don't
[54:47] we just don't join up with everybody
[54:48] that comes along
[54:52] they don't live the life of christ and i
[54:54] can you can see they're not living life
[54:55] of christ they're living they're
[54:57] dressing they're walking they're talking
[54:58] what they're eating on what they view
[55:00] what they see and what they're giving
[55:01] you
[55:02] is not the word of god
[55:06] and you say well i just don't see that i
[55:08] don't see that then you need to be
[55:09] awakened it's the awakening time it's
[55:13] the awakening of the bride it's a union
[55:15] taking place
[55:19] i know there's only a certain number
[55:20] going to enter in
[55:22] but you what's what is it stops you to
[55:24] know you're that number
[55:29] i said god open the warp to us
[55:34] amen a real genuine
[55:37] christian will cope with the inside man
[55:41] you're gonna bring out i don't care what
[55:43] it is what's ever laying in that soul is
[55:45] the light is so great today it's going
[55:47] to make manifest what you are
[55:50] on the inside of that soul it's got to
[55:53] the message of the hour that's why
[55:54] people don't want to get into it
[55:56] they want to hear some reasoning they
[55:57] want to have a church affiliation
[55:59] they want to have a group affair they
[56:01] want to have some little organized
[56:03] dominating female spirit
[56:06] dominating them i'm not talking about
[56:09] just females
[56:09] i'm talking about the carnal church man
[56:12] or woman it's a dominating denominating
[56:14] female spirit
[56:16] it's not god's word
[56:22] and you say well well we shouldn't have
[56:24] listen god
[56:25] is a segregationist
[56:31] i just read it on the message we've been
[56:33] fellowshipping in the morning
[56:34] on a family altar i trust you have a
[56:36] family altar
[56:40] i don't talk to that because i have it
[56:42] you need it every day
[56:44] you have a time where you can get alone
[56:46] and pray together as a family pray
[56:47] together with your children
[56:48] pray together with your husband and wife
[56:54] sincerely you know what the problem is
[56:57] we're in this message we need more
[56:59] sincerity
[57:00] that's for sure we need more sincerity
[57:02] we need to get down to business with god
[57:08] we just don't realize many many many
[57:11] many don't realize
[57:12] how close we are to a body change
[57:18] and i don't think i realize it
[57:21] because it is close you realize any day
[57:25] this bride can come up missing
[57:29] and you're left behind
[57:33] we better make our calling in election
[57:35] sure it doesn't matter where husband
[57:37] does what about you
[57:38] sis doesn't matter what you your wife
[57:42] does
[57:42] brother what about you brother what
[57:44] about you
[57:45] young man well i've been raised the
[57:48] message i'm okay that's denominational
[57:52] hogwash
[57:55] you aren't because you're raised your
[57:57] parents are believers you need an
[57:58] absolute personal
[58:03] contact a face-to-face contact with
[58:06] jesus christ
[58:08] and you're not too young if you have the
[58:10] conviction in your heart
[58:12] and you know that that's in you pulling
[58:14] then you need to let go of it i don't
[58:15] care if you have to get out there
[58:17] somewhere
[58:17] and just get on your face and say god
[58:19] you're going to file a pile of bones
[58:21] here get desperate about it
[58:22] say i need to make contact with you you
[58:24] gave this word to me and i want that
[58:26] feeling of the holy ghost
[58:27] i want a new birth that is a revealing
[58:31] of the word in me
[58:32] i need to be born again and the new
[58:35] birth is jesus christ
[58:36] then who are you that's born again
[58:40] that's what you have to meet
[58:46] i hope you got that
[58:50] amen it's not it's just not something we
[58:53] we just
[58:53] well it's okay i believe the message i'm
[58:55] born again no no no no
[58:57] no no no god revealing himself in you
[59:00] is the birth god undead unveils himself
[59:04] in you
[59:06] i'll build my church
[59:09] and the gates of hell shall not be able
[59:11] never will be able
[59:12] are impossible to defeat it they cannot
[59:16] defeat it
[59:21] amen you must meet the light you've got
[59:24] to meet the light you've got to go in
[59:26] beyond that second realm
[59:28] and the only way you can go beyond that
[59:30] second realm is because there's a seed
[59:31] of god planted in your soul that's
[59:33] pulling you in
[59:36] amen you've got to go beyond that
[59:41] second veil you've got to go into the
[59:42] holiest of holies
[59:44] you've got to come out of your own skin
[59:46] you've got to get meat face to face with
[59:48] him and know
[59:49] where you're standing and know who you
[59:50] are
[59:53] amen and then you can't explain
[59:56] revelation
[59:57] you can't give it to somebody else
[1:00:00] they've got to have their own experience
[1:00:02] so how do you know that jesus christ is
[1:00:06] right now is the son of god
[1:00:10] he that believeth jesus christ is
[1:00:12] present tense
[1:00:13] the son of god takes the holy ghost in
[1:00:16] you to unveil that
[1:00:17] because now you know
[1:00:21] praise the lord and if you grow up you
[1:00:22] can only grow up into one person
[1:00:25] i'm talking about spiritual growth as
[1:00:27] you feed on the word from revelation to
[1:00:29] revelation
[1:00:30] from light to light the path of the
[1:00:31] justice as a shining light that grows
[1:00:33] greater and greater and greater
[1:00:34] to a body change to a perfect day
[1:00:38] amen hallelujah all right
[1:00:42] so so there's something that's inside of
[1:00:45] all reasoning something inside of all
[1:00:47] emotions that's what i'm talking about
[1:00:48] this morning this evening
[1:00:49] there's something beyond emotion the
[1:00:52] second realm is a realm of reasoning and
[1:00:54] it's emotion
[1:00:56] and it has feelings and has sensation
[1:00:58] but you've got to go into
[1:00:59] faith that has no reasoning
[1:01:02] faith doesn't reason faith believes the
[1:01:04] word
[1:01:05] faith accepts the word they don't care
[1:01:07] who the person is or what it is
[1:01:09] you will not relieve anything or have
[1:01:10] anything to do with anything else
[1:01:12] but christ christ jesus is your all in
[1:01:16] all
[1:01:17] he's everything he's the fullness
[1:01:23] hallelujah when you're in him you've
[1:01:24] already been accepted
[1:01:26] you've already been received

[1:04:17] that inside man is the word you can't
[1:04:19] move that inside man
[1:04:22] that inside man that faith that's in you
[1:04:24] that revelation of christ in you you
[1:04:26] come face to face with who you are this
[1:04:28] isn't who you are i have no confidence

[1:04:44] happy evidence
[1:04:48] amen glory to god
[1:04:52] hallelujah
[1:04:55] i'll say brother david this is too deep
[1:04:57] no it isn't it's too simple
[1:05:01] we speak revelation because it is simple
[1:05:03] and you can't know right simple things
[1:05:05] unless it's revealed to you
[1:05:10] how are you going to be able to how are
[1:05:11] you going to be able in your own
[1:05:12] intellectual thinking
[1:05:14] be able to come down so low to a god
[1:05:16] that's so simple
[1:05:17] and beyond your intellect it takes
[1:05:21] revelation it takes
[1:05:22] the working of the holy spirit in you
[1:05:25] to do that
[1:05:30] you let a man see that and see what's
[1:05:32] really the hour and for the time and see
[1:05:34] his portion in it it's so simple
[1:05:37] that you can't give it to somebody else
[1:05:41] i'll chew on that a while
[1:05:45] and you know what god's come right down
[1:05:47] and become a part of a weakling come
[1:05:50] right down in your failures man's
[1:05:51] failures and faults and said
[1:05:53] that's all right that's what i want him
[1:05:54] to get to so i get most like i did moses
[1:05:56] and realize he's defeated
[1:05:58] realize he's cured realized and and
[1:06:00] moses just sort of said well god
[1:06:02] i'm so well cured and so such a weakling
[1:06:04] i'm making excuses of why i can't do
[1:06:06] what you want
[1:06:07] and god got angry with him and he said
[1:06:09] i'm not asking you to do anything
[1:06:11] i'm taking what i put inside of you
[1:06:12] moses i'm anointing it and i'm going
[1:06:14] down to egypt and i will deliver the
[1:06:16] people
[1:06:17] and i'm sending you and just simply tell
[1:06:20] them i
[1:06:21] am sent me yeah and i'll back it up
[1:06:25] where's the voice today where's the
[1:06:30] voice
[1:06:32] and if they speak them that heareth let
[1:06:35] him that heareth
[1:06:36] let him that heareth the spirit speaking
[1:06:38] through the prophet that spoke
[1:06:40] through the bride let him hear that
[1:06:42] voice let him hear it let him hear the
[1:06:44] voice
[1:06:45] and him that heareth let him say come
[1:06:51] hallelujah amen
[1:06:56] there you are the word will always
[1:06:58] trumpet ill
[1:06:59] triumph i mean it will never fail no
[1:07:01] matter what it
[1:07:02] what no matter what that outside an
[1:07:05] obstacle may be
[1:07:07] amen don't let the devil
[1:07:11] influence you i don't care how nice a
[1:07:15] person is
[1:07:16] i don't care how beautifully they can
[1:07:17] place their words
[1:07:19] what are they bringing you to what are
[1:07:21] they pulling you into
[1:07:23] what's the outcome of the fruit what is
[1:07:26] it
[1:07:28] it a furthering in the revelation for
[1:07:29] the hour
[1:07:31] or is it just some kind of friendship
[1:07:32] affair you know you'll fulfill your love
[1:07:35] which i'm not against
[1:07:36] philly love i have it for my wife but
[1:07:37] you know the filial love and divine love
[1:07:39] are so close together
[1:07:40] it's deceiving
[1:07:46] amen people have to feel you love when
[1:07:49] they think
[1:07:50] god a divine love divine love will
[1:07:52] recognize the word
[1:07:53] and live it for the season because it is
[1:07:56] the holy spirit
[1:07:57] himself the person of christ in you
[1:08:02] amen i better get going or i'm not going
[1:08:04] to get done here
[1:08:06] all right now
[1:08:10] let me read here something like i didn't
[1:08:12] even get past
[1:08:13] hardly passed it scripture verse 47 did
[1:08:17] i
[1:08:18] but he that is of god heareth god's word
[1:08:20] so therefore
[1:08:21] ye therefore hear them not because you
[1:08:23] are not of god
[1:08:25] oh oh
[1:08:29] you therefore hear them not
[1:08:32] because you're not of god so they that
[1:08:35] are of god
[1:08:37] heareth god's words
[1:08:41] looks like a pretty good evidence
[1:08:42] brother paul
[1:08:45] how do you know because it's revealed to
[1:08:47] you and it's
[1:08:48] identified every true revelation will be
[1:08:51] vindicated
[1:08:52] in scripture how many believe a message
[1:08:55] that has a real true revelation then you
[1:08:59] feed on that revelation to say what he
[1:09:01] says got to be a revelation to you
[1:09:02] he pointed us to this word
[1:09:06] the message unveiled this to you and you
[1:09:09] found yourself hid in it
[1:09:11] always in it always were in it amen amen
[1:09:16] amen amen
[1:09:18] hallelujah all right i get pretty
[1:09:22] excited you can
[1:09:23] anyway
[1:09:27] well let me read the rest these
[1:09:28] scriptures i got so much i'd like to
[1:09:30] say here all right
[1:09:34] let's go to matthew 13.
[1:09:41] matthew the 13th chapter i'll try to go
[1:09:43] through this a little quicker what time
[1:09:45] is it
[1:09:45] okay i've still got a little bit of time
[1:09:48] matthew 13
[1:09:52] verse 9
[1:09:56] jesus speaking who hath ears to hear let
[1:10:00] him hear
[1:10:01] and the disciples came and said unto him
[1:10:02] why speakest thou to them in parables
[1:10:05] he answered and said them because it is
[1:10:06] given unto you to know
[1:10:09] the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
[1:10:12] but to them
[1:10:13] it is not given
[1:10:16] he was hiding it it was hid
[1:10:22] what was he wanting his disciples to do
[1:10:23] doing what they were just there doing
[1:10:25] ask me to reveal my word praise the lord
[1:10:30] yes he wanted them to ask
[1:10:34] you receive not because you asked not
[1:10:37] and it was brought up here a couple of
[1:10:38] servants go you don't get what you asked
[1:10:40] for because you ask a miss
[1:10:42] to consume it upon your own lust
[1:10:46] god's not an errand boy god's not a
[1:10:49] messenger boy
[1:10:50] when you ask according to his will you
[1:10:52] have confidence that he hears you and if
[1:10:53] he know you here he know you know he
[1:10:55] hears you then you have your request
[1:10:58] you've got to ask according to his will
[1:11:01] outside of that you have no authority
[1:11:05] hallelujah but if you ask according to
[1:11:08] his will
[1:11:09] and his will is his word
[1:11:13] don't you ever forget that he said i
[1:11:15] want to do the will of god then
[1:11:17] it's in the word and the prophet's
[1:11:20] message brought us into this word
[1:11:23] and showed us what was hidden there
[1:11:26] as i said without that message you never
[1:11:28] know what's it in there
[1:11:30] you can read it intellectually all you
[1:11:31] want to read it right
[1:11:33] i encourage you young people to get in
[1:11:35] this message
[1:11:36] and take your bible and read it along
[1:11:38] with that prophet and go search the
[1:11:40] scriptures out them jesus said
[1:11:41] search the scriptures the prophet of the
[1:11:43] age says search the scriptures
[1:11:45] for in them you think you have eternal
[1:11:47] life
[1:11:49] and they are they that testify of me
[1:11:56] hey amen you like singing a song
[1:12:00] amen amen all right
[1:12:06] now watch he said because it is given to
[1:12:09] you no okay
[1:12:10] for whosoever hath has hath what
[1:12:15] an ear for whoso and what is that
[1:12:18] ear the seed
[1:12:23] because it is given unto you know the
[1:12:24] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
[1:12:27] excuse me for whosoever hath to him
[1:12:29] shall be
[1:12:30] given and he that hath
[1:12:34] and that he and he shall have more
[1:12:37] abundantly i've come to bring life and
[1:12:39] that more
[1:12:40] abundantly the thief cometh not but to
[1:12:42] steal and destroy what you do have
[1:12:47] amen but i have come
[1:12:50] that you might have life and have it
[1:12:53] more
[1:12:53] abundantly all right then he said
[1:12:56] and him and and he that hath be given
[1:12:59] more abundance
[1:13:00] but whosoever hath not from him shall be
[1:13:03] taken away even that he hath
[1:13:07] amen verse 16 but blessed are your eyes
[1:13:10] for you see
[1:13:12] they see and your ears for they hear
[1:13:17] amen all right
[1:13:20] then he comes over here
[1:13:23] in the next scripture here uh
[1:13:27] saint john 16.
[1:13:32] now get into a few things here i can't
[1:13:34] begin to cover it all
[1:13:35] so you get the picture just says the
[1:13:37] lord leads amen that's
[1:13:40] that's his business saint john 16 13.
[1:13:43] you see i brother sister you say why did
[1:13:46] you say you're not afraid
[1:13:48] to be direct if god wants to be direct
[1:13:50] i'll speak direct
[1:13:51] this is not the time to speak in
[1:13:53] parables
[1:13:57] now's the time to speak direct
[1:14:00] we're speaking revelation faith cometh
[1:14:02] by hearing
[1:14:04] hearing what not an intellectual speech
[1:14:09] hearing the word hearing the word of
[1:14:11] faith hearing faith
[1:14:12] preached yes
[1:14:16] amen and faith is in the word that's why
[1:14:19] faith comes by hearing hearing the word
[1:14:24] remember that faith is in the word
[1:14:29] that's why your faith anchors in the
[1:14:30] unmovable word of god that's why it
[1:14:32] anchors there
[1:14:34] that's it it doesn't move from that
[1:14:37] because it's in the word it's a part of
[1:14:38] the word and so are you you are that
[1:14:40] faith you are that
[1:14:42] unveiled christ i'll just
[1:14:46] point blank tell you you are eternal
[1:14:48] life
[1:14:50] i'm not talking about david i'm talking
[1:14:53] about that being manifest through david
[1:14:56] say oh well bless god you ought to be
[1:14:57] out there raising the graveyards and all
[1:14:59] this that you may not even see it done
[1:15:01] but i do
[1:15:05] and it's for you but it's not a show
[1:15:10] but it's being preached
[1:15:13] amen all right and the words are mine
[1:15:17] and the words i'm not talking about just
[1:15:19] me i'm talking about the five full
[1:15:20] ministry
[1:15:21] if we're true ministry we can't say
[1:15:22] opposite of what the prophet said we've
[1:15:24] got to speak it by revelation
[1:15:26] and if it's not a revelation leave it
[1:15:28] alone
[1:15:31] amen i'm talking about the ministry
[1:15:33] leave it alone until you know where
[1:15:35] you're standing
[1:15:38] amen
[1:15:41] amen we don't have a right to put what
[1:15:43] we think out there
[1:15:47] it's too important not to put what we
[1:15:49] think we're we're representatives
[1:15:52] and here to encourage we're here to
[1:15:55] edify
[1:15:56] building up the body for the work of the
[1:15:59] ministry
[1:15:59] what ministry his ministry
[1:16:04] right here revealing a kingdom we're
[1:16:06] here opening
[1:16:07] we're here to reveal christ bring christ
[1:16:10] i should say bring christ to you
[1:16:12] that's why when the light comes on the
[1:16:14] scene there's two things happen
[1:16:16] what's ever in that soul and that light
[1:16:18] determines and shows what's in the soul
[1:16:20] you're going to come against it or
[1:16:21] you're going to be for it
[1:16:23] one or the other and i am not
[1:16:26] responsible for how you react
[1:16:30] hey amen i'm not irresponsible for you
[1:16:32] getting it
[1:16:37] hallelujah so we need to take our eyes
[1:16:40] off off the outward
[1:16:42] and go on to the inward because the
[1:16:44] devil's always pointing you to some
[1:16:45] outward thing

[1:21:32] joy
[1:21:33] amidst the trials that he and his wisdom

[1:23:08] teach you there means revealed to you
[1:23:11] all things and bring all things to your
[1:23:14] remembrance
[1:23:15] whatsoever i have said unto you that's
[1:23:18] thus saith the scriptures
[1:23:20] right why can't we rely upon that and
[1:23:23] rely upon and have faith in who we are
[1:23:29] you know why the devils couldn't stand
[1:23:30] against jesus christ because he knew who
[1:23:32] he was
[1:23:34] and he had no beauty outward beauty we
[1:23:36] would desire it
[1:23:39] he's not manifested that way he was
[1:23:41] manifested
[1:23:44] as nobody we would desire
[1:23:47] no beauty we would desire rejected and
[1:23:49] despise the men
[1:23:52] amen is that right come up as a dry root
[1:23:56] out of ground
[1:23:58] kind of homely looking stoop shouldered
[1:24:00] thin little guy
[1:24:02] nobody wanted him
[1:24:05] yet he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:24:07] bodily he was all of god
[1:24:09] and he's all of us and we're all of him
[1:24:12] amen
[1:24:13] he's everything we are what we are he is
[1:24:15] and what he is we are
[1:24:19] amen and if he was despised and rejected
[1:24:22] nobody would desire him
[1:24:23] what do you think of the bride
[1:24:26] so cheer up everything's going exactly
[1:24:29] according to order
[1:24:31] it's just that our own senses get in the
[1:24:33] way
[1:24:35] but we can take authority over that
[1:24:37] can't we by bringing under obedience
[1:24:39] those thoughts
[1:24:41] all you got to do is change your thought
[1:24:44] yes
[1:24:45] amen amen
[1:24:48] that's too simple brother david
[1:24:51] is change your thought if the devil
[1:24:53] presents one thought
[1:24:54] go back to the word
[1:24:58] that's right that's just too simple yeah
[1:25:01] i know it
[1:25:02] but it's powerful all right
[1:25:07] you have to go stomping around just take
[1:25:09] the word
[1:25:13] just rely on the word
[1:25:17] amen rely on what god's revealed to you
[1:25:20] when he reveals it to you then move paul
[1:25:23] was such a prisoner
[1:25:24] that that little that little witch or
[1:25:27] that divination
[1:25:28] that girl came behind them declaring
[1:25:30] something she had no right to declare
[1:25:33] trying to proclaim something she didn't
[1:25:34] know anything about
[1:25:36] amen trying to amen are you with me and
[1:25:39] it wasn't god's way and yet for several
[1:25:41] days they followed
[1:25:42] and paul couldn't do one thing about it
[1:25:44] wait paul had authority but god paul
[1:25:46] was a prisoner
[1:25:50] and he couldn't move until god said move
[1:25:54] and that's the walk we have we have a
[1:25:56] walk of faith
[1:25:57] we can't move until god inspires you to
[1:25:59] do it
[1:26:02] and what you confess you confess what
[1:26:04] you believe you don't confess it out of
[1:26:06] hope
[1:26:06] you don't confess it out of nothing you
[1:26:08] confess what you believe
[1:26:11] and it must work when you speak in his
[1:26:14] name
[1:26:14] it's the revealed word inside of you
[1:26:16] it's the reality of who you are
[1:26:18] because you and him are one when you
[1:26:20] speak in his name it is the holy ghost
[1:26:23] speaking through you hallelujah
[1:26:28] he said if you ask anything in my name
[1:26:32] i will do it that's right hallelujah
[1:26:37] all right all right
[1:26:40] all right now broken cisterns paragraph
[1:26:43] 65
[1:26:44] you cannot make a man see the word of
[1:26:46] god till his nature has been changed
[1:26:50] and when his nature is changed from what
[1:26:52] it is
[1:26:53] to a son of god and the holy spirit
[1:26:55] comes into him the holy spirit wrote the
[1:26:57] word of god
[1:27:01] today i was talking with a good friend
[1:27:02] of mine dr lee vale present now he's
[1:27:04] quite a theologian we usually have some
[1:27:06] very pretty good discussions
[1:27:08] on the scripture very smart and he asked
[1:27:10] me one time he said what i thought about
[1:27:12] the initial evidence of the holy ghost
[1:27:14] was and it
[1:27:14] is it speaking in tongues it's been
[1:27:16] wasn't speaking in tongues
[1:27:18] it meant many years ago and i said no
[1:27:20] can't see that
[1:27:21] he said neither do i said though i've
[1:27:23] been taught that he said what would you
[1:27:24] think would be an evidence i said well
[1:27:26] the most perfect evidence i can think of
[1:27:28] is love so we got to talking on that
[1:27:30] and then i thought that sounded pretty
[1:27:32] good so i just held that
[1:27:36] if a man has got love
[1:27:43] i just let it soak in a minute love
[1:27:47] satan can impersonate love it's not true
[1:27:50] love but he can impersonate it
[1:27:52] [Laughter]
[1:27:55] all right are you with me he can't come
[1:27:58] into divine love because he's not of god
[1:28:01] i hope you got that right all right
[1:28:04] amen so now but watch what he says and i
[1:28:07] held to that
[1:28:09] if a man's got love but one day the lord
[1:28:12] in a vision
[1:28:14] straighten me out he said that the
[1:28:16] evidence of the
[1:28:17] spirit was those who could receive
[1:28:21] the word
[1:28:26] neither love nor speaking in tongues
[1:28:29] it's receiving
[1:28:31] the word
[1:28:34] that's scriptural because in john 14
[1:28:37] jesus said when the holy ghost has come
[1:28:39] upon you
[1:28:39] he will reveal these things to you that
[1:28:42] i've taught you
[1:28:43] and will show you things to come
[1:28:47] so there is the genuine evidence of the
[1:28:49] holy ghost he's never told me anything
[1:28:51] wrong yet
[1:28:52] that is that is the evidence of the holy
[1:28:54] ghost
[1:28:55] he is he who can believe the word
[1:29:00] he you he said believe it means to you
[1:29:03] can receive it
[1:29:08] now there you could stop right there you
[1:29:10] still wouldn't have a full picture
[1:29:12] we got to go on some more things so bear
[1:29:14] with me a minute
[1:29:15] all right jesus never said
[1:29:19] when the holy ghost has come you'll
[1:29:21] speak with tongues he never said the
[1:29:22] holy ghost come you do any of those
[1:29:24] things
[1:29:36] too bad but you can dance and shout all
[1:29:39] you want and i believe in dancing and
[1:29:40] shouting
[1:29:42] i believe in getting happy over
[1:29:43] revelation this stimulation it's wine
[1:29:45] this new wine
[1:29:46] you're so happy you can have a fit you
[1:29:48] ought to see me sometime out there
[1:29:50] walking
[1:29:50] you ought to see me in my room no you
[1:29:52] shouldn't see me they don't have to see
[1:29:54] me
[1:29:55] if i live this life i don't care what
[1:29:57] you see
[1:30:00] amen that's right
[1:30:04] because that holy ghost in me is not
[1:30:06] going to accept anything contrary to
[1:30:07] that word
[1:30:08] i don't care who it is or what it is or
[1:30:10] where it comes from
[1:30:15] amen and god will have nothing to do
[1:30:19] with the denominational spirit
[1:30:22] i don't care if it does claim to believe
[1:30:23] the message
[1:30:29] he will he will get you away from that
[1:30:31] he'll separate you from that thing
[1:30:33] when the bride begins to say i am the
[1:30:35] father and one that
[1:30:36] dominating denominational church
[1:30:40] female spirit will get away
[1:30:45] but it'll still want to stay on the
[1:30:46] fringes out here because
[1:30:48] what satan is afraid of is revelation
[1:30:51] and he hates it but we love it and with
[1:30:54] true revelation with revelation being
[1:30:56] brought with revelation being preached
[1:30:59] he'll do everything he can to keep you
[1:31:02] out of it
[1:31:04] and we expect that we expect that battle
[1:31:07] but what's the
[1:31:08] when the enemy will come in like a flood
[1:31:09] this the what will happen
[1:31:11] the spirit of the lord will raise a
[1:31:14] standard against him and you know what
[1:31:15] else the prophet said he said are you
[1:31:17] one of them
[1:31:21] where is that standard where does it
[1:31:23] live where is it where is it failed
[1:31:26] it's behind the skin of the bride that's
[1:31:28] where it is
[1:31:35] amen all right
[1:31:39] there's the genuine evidence he said but
[1:31:41] he will take these things of mine and
[1:31:44] show them to you you won't do any of
[1:31:46] those things or evidence but he will
[1:31:47] take these things of mine
[1:31:49] and show them to you reveal them to you
[1:31:52] and will show you things to come so
[1:31:54] there is the genuine evidence of the
[1:31:57] holy ghost according to jesus
[1:31:59] himself what will he do he will reveal
[1:32:02] these things to you that i've taught you
[1:32:07] all right and when i s
[1:32:11] when you see that oh what a rest you've
[1:32:14] entered into
[1:32:15] what satisfaction because god himself
[1:32:18] has identified yourself
[1:32:19] in him and you and him are one
[1:32:23] when the bride begins to say i and my
[1:32:25] father are one.
[1:32:27] oh that devil don't like that it's one
[1:32:30] thing to say it it's the next thing to
[1:32:32] say it and live it
[1:32:35] and that's what it'll be done it's a
[1:32:37] token on display
[1:32:39] in your everyday life
[1:32:42] they watch because they'll see you won't
[1:32:44] take anything off the word
[1:32:46] the holy ghost can't do that well i may
[1:32:49] make a mistake i do that but you know
[1:32:50] what i'll do
[1:32:51] i'm quick to say forgive me and i'll
[1:32:53] make it right i'll go to be quick to the
[1:32:55] lord and say it
[1:32:56] listen that doesn't move him and it
[1:32:58] doesn't move who you are
[1:33:00] that doesn't change the scene at all
[1:33:02] because you know this
[1:33:03] is not who you are and god will allow
[1:33:06] you to be
[1:33:07] challenged by that he'll allow you to be
[1:33:08] tested by mistakes
[1:33:10] he'll allow you to be tried by mistakes
[1:33:12] and all of it's for the purpose of
[1:33:14] developing his own character he wants to
[1:33:16] see your reaction he wants to see what
[1:33:18] you're going to do about it
[1:33:19] he wants to see your decision and he
[1:33:21] said that's what glorifies me
[1:33:23] in the midst of weakness in the midst of
[1:33:25] everything their strength is myself
[1:33:30] amen lord help me to become a total
[1:33:34] absolute dependence
[1:33:37] weakling upon christ
[1:33:42] who by the way is present
[1:33:46] who do you say this is who do you say
[1:33:48] the bride is who do you say jesus christ
[1:33:50] is today
[1:33:52] he's the bride
[1:33:54] [Laughter]
[1:33:57] i don't want to choke you now but the
[1:34:00] son of man is being revealed in bright
[1:34:02] form
[1:34:05] amen
[1:34:08] amen that's what is that's what he meant
[1:34:11] to do
[1:34:12] it's the bride coming of christ amen
[1:34:17] what a position all right now let's
[1:34:18] continue amen the members of his bride
[1:34:21] will love him

[1:35:04] it a little bit all right now i go ahead
[1:35:05] and think about it here let's move on
[1:35:07] they will have his potentials for thee
[1:35:09] as their head
[1:35:09] all power belongs to him they are
[1:35:11] subject to him oh that's what he said at
[1:35:13] the end of that quote he said you speak
[1:35:15] the word and
[1:35:15] i will perform it there you are they are
[1:35:18] subject to him as the members of our
[1:35:20] the bride is subject to him as the
[1:35:23] members of our bodies are subject to our
[1:35:26] heads
[1:35:28] the harmony of the father and the son
[1:35:32] notice this harmony now i'm
[1:35:35] i'm right at the point where i have to
[1:35:36] close off if i'm going to close on time
[1:35:39] but what is time
[1:35:43] trick question what is time
[1:35:47] a space of eternity brother brown said
[1:35:51] time is
[1:35:51] eternity space
[1:35:59] all right and eternity and time are
[1:36:01] blending together so now what about it
[1:36:07] i'm not saying that to be funny that's
[1:36:09] the truth
[1:36:11] we're moving more and more to the
[1:36:12] eternal than time
[1:36:15] it's being swallowed up what's
[1:36:16] swallowing time up brother david
[1:36:19] christ revelation amen
[1:36:23] being here as he promised now
[1:36:27] for his bride
[1:36:30] i got to get to this point if i don't
[1:36:31] get any further just a couple things
[1:36:33] will you bear with me about five minutes
[1:36:35] 10 minutes maybe 15.
[1:36:42] it's up here but it's got to come down
[1:36:43] here okay

[1:36:49] anything until it first showed him by
[1:36:52] the father
[1:36:53] hello hello

[1:37:04] down i got to do something i got gotta
[1:37:05] do something that's denominational you
[1:37:06] don't do anything just believe what he
[1:37:08] said and walk with him
[1:37:09] and let him take care of it let god be
[1:37:12] god

[1:37:43] all right jesus never did anything until
[1:37:47] it was first showed him by the father
[1:37:48] you say brother david
[1:37:49] he saw vision it's still a revelation

[1:38:20] wedding at the opening of those seals

[1:38:33] have union with her

[1:43:08] and well i don't nobody's coming you're
[1:43:10] we're beholding it coming in
[1:43:12] it's too simple denominations hate it
[1:43:15] right they can't get it i'm not talking
[1:43:18] about the people there i'm talking about
[1:43:19] that denominational spirit
[1:43:23] that's idolatry that spirit that
[1:43:26] dominating female that i
[1:43:27] don't trust spirit
[1:43:30] i pull no punches with that we could
[1:43:32] take that i've got a message i'd like to
[1:43:34] preach on that someday
[1:43:36] called dominating female 1
[1:43:40] i do i've got it written out lord
[1:43:43] willing
[1:43:43] if god maybe not here maybe somewhere
[1:43:45] else i don't know
[1:43:46] but god willing i'd like to preach that
[1:43:49] and let us see where you're where we're
[1:43:51] standing and how subtle these two
[1:43:53] spirits are so deceptive
[1:43:55] sin is such a shrewd bird it looks so
[1:43:58] beautiful it looks so
[1:43:59] overwhelmingly reasonable you'll fall to
[1:44:02] it if you don't know
[1:44:03] him on the inside of the inside if
[1:44:05] you're not settled
[1:44:06] if you haven't entered into his wrath
[1:44:08] you're going to miss it
[1:44:11] you say you say that pretty desperate
[1:44:12] i'm saying that out of desperation
[1:44:14] you better wake up quickly we've already
[1:44:17] seen the coming storm i preached the
[1:44:19] messi no longer coming storm
[1:44:20] and right behind it they'll covet come
[1:44:22] in don't you see don't you realize
[1:44:25] this thing of these churches there's
[1:44:28] going to be that dominating
[1:44:29] spirit right here amongst the message
[1:44:31] believers claiming to believe the
[1:44:32] message
[1:44:33] are going to fall right line the
[1:44:34] confederation of churches
[1:44:36] and it's going to look so reasonable and
[1:44:38] so right and so beautiful
[1:44:40] that we can operate under that you air
[1:44:42] doing that and it's going to be such a
[1:44:44] simple thing
[1:44:45] and look so reasonable you better know
[1:44:47] him
[1:44:51] because the only way you're going to
[1:44:52] discern that thing is to know him
[1:44:57] you say you don't have to tell us we'd
[1:44:58] better we better yeah maybe i do
[1:45:01] maybe it'll shake somebody to
[1:45:02] desperation here right here in this
[1:45:04] assembly
[1:45:05] because we're not playing church we
[1:45:07] didn't come here to play
[1:45:09] church we come here jesus christ that
[1:45:11] should be the very absolute
[1:45:13] absolute of our coming here is to meet
[1:45:15] him
[1:45:18] that's right i gotta close
[1:45:22] let me just close i could go on and tell
[1:45:25] you more evidences
[1:45:26] of super sense revelation of who you are
[1:45:31] he's headed to all but the seed of god
[1:45:33] he said i've hid these things the wise
[1:45:34] and prudent
[1:45:36] amen no man in himself can hear god the
[1:45:38] ability has to be given from god
[1:45:40] it's only revealed to a special group
[1:45:42] nobody can get it but the elect
[1:45:44] because the elect can only be reborn on
[1:45:46] and on we go
[1:45:48] you see on and on we receive it i'll let
[1:45:50] you look all those things up
[1:45:51] it has to be given the bride speaks the
[1:45:54] same thing
[1:45:55] the evidence is hearing what the spirit
[1:45:56] says the spirit is talking
[1:45:58] the evidence is hearing he told the
[1:45:59] evidence of what happened being baptized
[1:46:01] with the holy ghost
[1:46:02] the teacher would come in and teach all
[1:46:04] truth the teacher is an inside teacher
[1:46:06] not an outside teacher
[1:46:07] if the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't
[1:46:09] hear the truth and receive it by
[1:46:11] revelation
[1:46:11] if you heard it every moment of the day
[1:46:14] that was the sign of the indwelling
[1:46:15] spirit in the days of paul
[1:46:16] those who were filled with the holy
[1:46:18] ghost heard the word received it
[1:46:20] and lived it those who did not have the
[1:46:23] spirit heard it only as carnal men
[1:46:25] those that did not have the spirit heard
[1:46:27] it only as carnal man
[1:46:28] put a wrong interpretation on it and
[1:46:31] went into sin
[1:46:33] and if we don't see that happening amen
[1:46:37] he said sad but got to see it happening
[1:46:40] we've got to have the we've got to have
[1:46:42] the the
[1:46:44] carnal against the spiritual that's
[1:46:47] dominating females a carnal spirit it's
[1:46:50] a carnal church
[1:46:52] and all it can walk in is carnal
[1:46:54] claiming to believe a message
[1:46:55] carnally amen
[1:46:59] under false teachers that build a
[1:47:00] kingdom around them instead of
[1:47:02] pointing it to the word who are we
[1:47:05] preaching brother brown said ourselves
[1:47:06] or christ
[1:47:10] all right the evidence is the same those
[1:47:13] who had the spirit the teacher heard the
[1:47:15] word
[1:47:16] and the and the spirit took it and lived
[1:47:18] the word and taught it other words
[1:47:20] taught it i told you
[1:47:21] here's what he said and taught it
[1:47:22] brother brown said revealed it
[1:47:24] the spirit taught it revealed it to them
[1:47:28] they were of the group that heard the
[1:47:29] messenger and his message and took
[1:47:31] that message and lived it in other words
[1:47:34] that message became flesh in them just
[1:47:37] exactly what god wanted
[1:47:39] you have to grow into this if he gives
[1:47:42] you an acorn potentially you have an oak
[1:47:44] tree
[1:47:45] is that right but you have to grow into
[1:47:47] it but everything that oak tree would
[1:47:49] ever be the number of leaves the number
[1:47:50] of acorns that would ever bear
[1:47:52] and everything is in that seat right
[1:47:54] then and brother sister everything we
[1:47:56] have need of for this journey is in us
[1:47:58] right now when the holy ghost is in us
[1:47:59] and it's going to be brought to us as we
[1:48:01] have need of it amen
[1:48:03] god wants you to let go of yourself and
[1:48:05] have confidence in him and let him lead
[1:48:06] you every day
[1:48:07] out of your senses out of the camp of
[1:48:09] man you've got to go out of the camp of
[1:48:11] man you've got to come out of that thing
[1:48:13] you've got to come out of laodicea and
[1:48:15] eat him outside the camp
[1:48:19] god expects you amen to to follow
[1:48:24] by obedience follow just submission and
[1:48:27] let lead you contrary to your own better
[1:48:29] judgment
[1:48:31] because you've got to let your own
[1:48:33] better man's judgment become nothing
[1:48:35] completely weak you can't rely upon it
[1:48:39] i'm so thankful god is bringing a people
[1:48:41] to that total dependency
[1:48:43] she doesn't have independence she is
[1:48:45] dependent
[1:48:47] that's what god wanted us that wherefore
[1:48:50] we know when we're coming more and more
[1:48:51] dependent god cutting away cutting away
[1:48:53] this cutting away that
[1:48:54] showing us we gotta die here and die
[1:48:56] there and die here and die there
[1:48:57] what's all these trials and what's these
[1:48:59] what's these tests doing
[1:49:01] showing us persecutions everything's
[1:49:04] showing us
[1:49:06] he's got it all under control
[1:49:10] all right i'm closing yeah
[1:49:14] almost 15 minutes later all right
[1:49:19] one more thing here if the seed be
[1:49:21] planted
[1:49:22] the water will raise it up here again

[1:54:58] what did she feed on she had to feed
[1:55:01] that child
[1:55:06] you can't feed it on education you can't
[1:55:09] feed it on psychology
[1:55:11] you better let go of psychology i don't
[1:55:12] care if anybody in this church wants to
[1:55:14] bring something psychologically to you
[1:55:15] reject that thing
[1:55:18] you have everything you need right here
[1:55:19] in this message
[1:55:21] why are you looking around for something
[1:55:23] else
[1:55:26] amen you've got everything you need
[1:55:27] right here
[1:55:29] and everything you read you better let
[1:55:30] it be filtered through the word but
[1:55:32] without the holy ghost how are you going
[1:55:33] to filter it
[1:55:35] right because the holy ghost will draw
[1:55:37] through the word for the hour
[1:55:41] i don't need i got i got these i'll
[1:55:44] leave that alone
[1:55:44] just go with it but be careful
[1:55:48] you better be aware of it you're being
[1:55:50] warned of it
[1:55:52] i don't care how close a person is to
[1:55:55] you
[1:55:56] we're not accepting anything contrary to
[1:55:58] this word
[1:56:01] that psychological gobbledy
[1:56:04] goulash is in the spirit realm
[1:56:08] not the soul realm the soul realm is
[1:56:12] where your deliverance lays
[1:56:14] not in your reasoning realm
[1:56:17] all you can reason is so pretty and the
[1:56:20] things happen under that realm
[1:56:22] but it doesn't give eternal life
[1:56:28] amen and when that thing comes up there
[1:56:30] to work contrary
[1:56:31] to the word watch out
[1:56:35] anything contrary the word is your enemy
[1:56:40] anything contrary to what this message
[1:56:42] spoke
[1:56:45] i'm talking about the message i'm not
[1:56:46] talking about william branham's
[1:56:48] mistakes and failures i'm talking about
[1:56:50] the message
[1:56:52] anything the message spoke which is
[1:56:53] jesus christ you better
[1:56:55] if contrary to that leave it alone
[1:56:56] because this message and this bible
[1:56:59] are won
[1:57:04] amen amen i don't care don't you try to
[1:57:08] say well brother brown said this then
[1:57:10] put a wrong slant on what he said
[1:57:12] if you can't say what he said and find
[1:57:13] it in this word you leave it alone what
[1:57:15] he said
[1:57:17] because what he said brought light on
[1:57:18] this
[1:57:21] it was sent for that purpose all right
[1:57:25] before we meet him physically there
[1:57:26] we're found the child of the holy ghost
[1:57:28] spiritually by an invisible union with
[1:57:30] our bridegroom
[1:57:31] the bride has the mind of christ for she
[1:57:34] knows she knows
[1:57:37] shows her she knows revealed led by the
[1:57:40] holy spirit what he wants done with the
[1:57:41] word she performs the command of the
[1:57:43] word in his name for she has
[1:57:45] thus saith the lord she can't have the
[1:57:48] mind of god and not have thus saith the
[1:57:50] lord
[1:57:52] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:57:54] then the word is quickened
[1:57:55] by the spirit if it's thus saith the
[1:57:58] lord the word is quickened
[1:58:00] by the spirit and it comes to pass
[1:58:03] like a seed that's planted and watered
[1:58:06] it comes to full harvest serving its
[1:58:07] purpose
[1:58:09] praise the lord do you love him i'll
[1:58:11] have to click
[1:58:12] quit quit quit
[1:58:15] stop stand with me
[1:58:20] amen you want to become a prisoner
[1:58:24] if revelations beyond you look up and
[1:58:26] seek god for it
[1:58:27] that's that is the only way you are ever
[1:58:30] going to get it
[1:58:33] amen that's the only way you're ever
[1:58:35] going to get it
[1:58:40] the elect group the elect always heard
[1:58:43] the word and received it the elect

[1:58:55] referring to john 8 47
[1:58:58] and received it proving they had

[1:59:33] doing and lord forgive us of our heirs
[1:59:35] and our faults and failures as we lay
[1:59:37] them now by faith

[1:59:43] lord jesus we don't want to come up
[1:59:45] short in that hour

[2:00:25] for a genuine baptism of the holy ghost
[2:00:28] is being born again

[2:00:33] seed
[2:00:33] the real the real lord you said the
[2:00:37] the real thing is inside of that soul
[2:00:39] that real
[2:00:41] [Music]
[2:00:42] gift is in that soul that will believe
[2:00:46] the word
[2:00:47] receive it that comes alive by the
[2:00:49] baptism of the holy ghost

[2:00:58] they've got a germatized seed that's
[2:01:01] life meaning life
