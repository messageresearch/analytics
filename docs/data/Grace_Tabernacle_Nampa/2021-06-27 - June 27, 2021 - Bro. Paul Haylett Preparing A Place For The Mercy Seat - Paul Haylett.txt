by the sicilian other sergey on the roads or just watch over them keep them safe sister zeller is in the hospital it's a brother carl's mom with colbin she has a number of other issues so we just want to pray lord would just touch her body and i believe but uh the prayer request for brother john drake was on the church whatsapp we want to continue to remember him for him i talked to brother richard drake uh yesterday and that he's doing much better uh they have done they didn't think it was possible to do a lung bypass so where they go through the artery in the leg and they take out all the carbon and they put it back in your neck so allows your lungs not to have to breathe and they can heal so they uh they were doing that and then they decided that he was strong enough they'd bring him out of his coma and they started to do that and he just woke right up the nurse said his eyes were sharp everything's so really thankful for the lord's touching his life so let's just continue to remember him in prayer it's it's going to be a long world of recovery richard told us so but our god is in control let's remember brother bashan sister kancha they're going to be traveling up this way to be with us for uh communion on saturday so let's uh pray lord just watch over them keep them safe as they travel traveling mercy's amen we want to remember sister joanne dean heart in prayer for healing her body not feeling well let's pray for her brother bob as well or just be their strength and sister carrie texted me this morning as well she's as you know with family and she just has a number of unspoken prayer requests that she just like the church to remember her in prayer sister sue just wants to be remembered this morning as well and also her husband dan apparently heard his back a little week ago so she's just asking for prayer for him as well brother scott and elena are at home not well this morning amen sounds like devil's attacking us amen well there must be something good in store for us amen brother chris why don't you come and take these needs to the lord this morning if you have a need just raise your hand as we go to our heavenly father amen our heads heavenly father lord jesus we thank you for lord being attentive to our needs lord jesus the needs of our body the needs of our hearts our soul spiritual lord father you're always mindful of that we come to you lord not in fear of making a request but in confidence knowing you love us lord and that follow your desires to see us grow lord to see us healed father so lord take these requests to you father too many for me to remember lord jesus but you know each one of them father some of us are not feeling well lord some are traveling lord and father just the different needs the unspoken requests lord you know what they are father they're unspoken to us but loud in your ears father we ask you just touch these needs lord jesus or your people father we also pray for the service this morning lord may you just have your way in the remaining of the song service lord specials the singing of the music lord and father the preaching of the word lord we pray you just come forth and minister to our hearts lord jesus may lord we just accept what you want to tell us today lord what you want to show us what you want to reveal to us father may our hearts be soft and pliable lord this morning we love you father god and we thank you for all these things commit them into your hands in jesus christ's name we pray amen then you can take your seats this morning uh the first thing i do want to say is that youth meeting was going to be this friday but we decided to cancel this the month of july we have 4th of july that weekend and the next weekend is the camping trip so give everybody a chance to get ready for that and enjoy their weekend the same thing goes for grace kids postponing that one so the next one will be august 6th so the camping trip we did some regrouping yesterday my wife and i for we tackled the good old google for about five hours along with and jerry and a couple other people to try to find a better location i realized that that probably was a little bit not as accessible as it needed to be the spot that we had originally picked so we searched around to find a better spot because it it's our desire to have time away together with god as a church and with our families and so i want everyone who can make it to be able to make that um it's very near and dear to our hearts we get to extend that opportunity to each one and i have nothing to prove so the new spot is a campground and it has a paved road the whole way to it cue the applause uh it also has a public restroom okay with the cheering so um you have those amenities there um it's two hours from napa or the old spot was an hour and 45 minutes so it's just a few minutes longer but um it's going to feel a lot faster because the 30 minutes on the dirt road to the old spot didn't feel like 30 minutes it felt like an hour so this way you just you'll head out of napa towards unity oregon is where it is we'll post the link there's several spots in the area we're going to go today this afternoon take a sunday drive and check the one we want to use and if it's good we'll post the link you're not going to need maps to get there because we can just use our our smartphones for smart enough to use them and it's just easier that way so the campground is first come first served so we cannot reserve it and all the group places we could reserve i mean if they're they're booked up you have to get on their january first pretty much to get anything within three or so hours so um our plan is to go out wednesday july 7th my wife and my family and then sister carrie and mason i think and we're going to show up and buy rent every spot so we have the whole campground um there's about nine spots so it's not unrealistic so anybody that can come out early thursday morning or early thursday if you can that would help we could get you a spot and that way that would kind of make sure that no one tries to come in to take our our spot there so the option for coming out on just sunday i feel like it's still okay it's only a couple hour drive and uh so you have be able to spend the whole day out there we're still going to go with that plan for those of you that want to do that we'll have a nice sunday morning service with brother rich and we'll have a sunday lunch all together just kind of spend the day out in the woods there and then we'll wrap up that sunday evening it's july 8th through july 11th so thursday through sunday and like i said brother rich will be coming with his family to join us for the weekend um he'll be speaking saturday evening at 7 pm going to give his testimony we'll probably not have like a full church service maybe a couple songs and then have him give his testimony and then sunday morning he's going to speak service at 10 30. for everyone that's joining us for dinners we kind of we're giving we're handing that option out you can if you want to and for sunday lunch kristen my wife will contact each of you for what to bring for that everyone that's coming you even on sunday you need to bring a chair for every person in your group that same chair is going to be what you will use for service so we'll just grab our camp chairs and set up for the services so make sure you have enough chairs for that also to not go over an exhaustive list of what to bring camping remember mosquito um and if you have any other questions you can feel free to ask on the whatsapp group or to text us directly or call us so it's a lot of information but we will post all this again and along with the spot once we go and check it and everything and make sure it's all good to go so we just ask that you join us in praying that we have the whole thing everything works out smoothly and uh thank you for being patient with us this is our first attempt at this and so every year i'll just get a little bit smoother we already have a place picked out for next year so we're going to be up january 1st to reserve that spot but this year this is what we have what we're going with so trust it'll work out trust the lord to work it out and if you can make the effort i believe god will match that effort and that expectation and it'll be more than just a campout it'll be a time to spend with with the lord um it's always a little bit easier out in the nature to connect with god so i believe that time is important to spend with him and with each other last year we had coven and we kind of broke the rules anyways but there's still a little bit of less fellowship sometimes but i think i think it's going to be a wonderful time so god bless y'all [Music] so many times lore i've done and said the wrong thing so many times lord i've been in the way but i thank you for your love and your mercy for without you i'd be unmolded clay it's you lord who gives me strength to face tomorrow it's you lord who saved and set me free [Music] it's you lord when the trials [Music] like me i once was lost but now i'm found i was blind but now i see [Music] it's you lord who gives me strength to face tomorrow it's you lord who saved and set me free it's you lord when the trials rise around me [Music] you send your light to show me the way you send your light [Music] 277 only you lord only you you see [Music] [Laughter] [Music] only year long [Music] i [Music] [Music] one more time [Music] yes [Music] foundation [Music] oh [Music] just speak that from your heart to the lord this morning amen [Music] [Music] oh [Music] good to be in the house of the lord today amen god bless you brother david sister and i am sister ruth hope you had a a lovely time amen that's wonderful hallelujah just you know sometimes they say a change is as good as a vacation and so sometimes you need to get out and you know be able to see new faces and do new things and uh so i hope i say this right i don't really feel like chewing on my shoe this morning but you know brother chris when he when he come to me with this desire this idea of going camping or doing something different i personally thought it was a good idea uh we could just kind of break our normal mold kind of uh go out of our way a little bit um some might say well it's gonna be an extra effort well maybe you need to do an extra effort amen you know sometimes you know like when revival comes in the church you know you have special meetings revival comes in the church you know it never just happens right people exert effort they make plans they fulfill things they do and you know a young couple gets married you don't just show up on the saturday and the church is decorated somebody put effort into that and we're working on our marriage with the lord jesus christ and so i think it's good for us sometimes to put out the extra effort to uh put that and so uh brother chris made just a slight comment on that and i feel to elaborate on that a little bit uh saints have have mercy don't put brother chris on the uh on the altar and crucify him that this plan wasn't just so perfectly orchestrated because um it never just happened the first time uh a good example of that many years ago brother tim pruitt uh was recounting how somebody said my brother tim you know your youth camp is just goes flows so smoothly so good and brother tim said you should have been here for the first one you know at that point never thought we'd ever have another one it takes an effort and so let's not be what they call the armchair jockeys uh and sit back and say should have done this should have done this and if i had been in charge we would have done this but of course we would have forgot that so you know i'm just going to put a pitch in for the preacher how's that when you come to church don't be there saying he should have said this and he shouldn't have said that if we were all perfect we'd be walking the streets of gold this morning amen some might get there sooner than others hallelujah you know this is the way i choose to look at it saints uh our dear friend sister deborah walker you know passing away uh and i don't say this judgmentally i don't say this in anything but other its purest form so she had shared with sister jerry here recently she said somebody said oh sister deborah i'll meet you at the eastern gate and sister deborah's response was meet you at the eastern gate nothing god's going to heal me and i applaud that kind of faith but the critic could look at that and say they'll meet the eastern gate but you see my brother and sister we don't always know what tomorrow is and we don't have everything but one thing we know the word of god is life and he speaks life he encourages to reach for life and he encourages us to live life nowhere in the bible will you find jesus christ telling you or peter paul or john telling you go hole up in a hole somewhere and wait for the coming of the lord be a hermit no we were meant now i i i don't i'm not referring to anyone so nobody get a complex here but some of you need someone to rub on you amen as iron sharpeneth iron so doth grace tabernacle needs someone to rub on you amen we want everybody just to see it our way and no i won't sing the song that just flashed across my brain but my brother and sister when we get the idea it's all got to be our way we need to pray more amen so um we want to remember this coming saturday 6 p.m communion here at the church and i made that decision based on giving opportunity for the saints to enjoy i i believe it's still on brother trevor and sister kerry uh you know it was mentioned um maybe i'm presumptuous here brother trevor is like yeah i don't know sister kerry let me put her this way she wanted to host another fourth of july get together and uh brother trevor if that was out of line forgive me so um anyway um so we're we're gonna have communion on saturday evening and that way we'll give you uh the opportunity brother prashant sister koncha uh really wanted to be here for communion and because of the holiday weekend it was available to them so um we just we're not here in the accommodation business saints otherwise we have to start accommodating this family because they give more offering and we have to accommodate this family because they're the musicians and we have to accommodate this one because they claim the church and we have to no we're not in the accommodation business but at the same token we are not legalists hard and fast that we cannot make any change so that's what we're going to do if that's uncomfortable for someone you can talk to me about it i want to give greetings to you you won't know them but when sister jerry and i this last year went to go brain dead paul greeley colorado we met brother christian and sister mirna lovely lovely they come picked us up took us for dinner took us to a fellowship uh they weren't allowed to have church at that time because of the lockdown but um uh just a lovely time and so brother christian sends greetings from the saints there in greeley brother christian is um the assistant uh to his uh dad but his dad i believe is his visiting family in mexico and so he's been taking care of the church and just lovely brother and sister just very kindred spirits let's just stand as we go into the word of god today i want to speak to you this morning on preparing a place for the mercy seat and we're going to start right here as it were in the book of exodus we're looking today my brother and sister we do not have a physical tabernacle as it were a building that houses the mercy seat today but we'll see as we go into this uh topic of the mercy seat we will see how that god moves and how he has come and what he manifested uh in one sense my brother and sister you see now god is god and he changes not is that correct so what we'll see though that god moves in types and shadows right so god will use a representation over here and come and then we will see what the true interpretation of that representation was uh not in as it were physical form but then it's here in the spiritual and god gives us these examples and brother branham himself says i was i'm a typologist so we can take these types into scripture and uh we can look through that and find this and so let's turn in our bibles to exodus the 25th chapter uh we'll read from verse one through verse eight and i feel like i've forgotten something but i don't know what that would be so just well pray the lord if it's important would bring it back to my memory amen exodus 25 verses 1 through 8. can someone say it's good to be here this morning amen and the lord spake unto moses saying now i like this my brother and sister moses did not just have a thought moses didn't say um i think right this was god speaking speak unto the children of grace tabernacle that they bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering now let me read that correctly so no one will be offended speaking to the children of israel that they bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart he shall take my offering now i'm not going to expound on this but i want you to know saints that if you grudgingly reach into the purse or the pocket and you give unto the lord whether it's an offering whether it's ties or whatever it would be and you do that grudgingly there's no blessing the scripture shows us in the new testament that if the preacher preaches grudgingly there's no blessing but to the man who freely gives himself to preach the word of god now there's no quotation marks that says when he feels like it when it's easy when it's convenient or when it's accepted it's the difference of whether he does it from his heart or he does it grudgingly now saints the same applies to each one of us if we're here this morning with some kind of grudging reluctance to be here you're going to have a hard time getting a blessing god's looking for the worshiper now people say well i raise my hands and i sing this that's not worship worship has to come from the depths of the heart the song says let the worshipper arise hallelujah remember that brother jason maybe we'll sing that at the end of the service let the worshipers arise not not the not the angry not the grudging not the unwilling but the worshiper and this is the offering which he shall take of them gold and silver and brass and blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and goat's hair and rams skins dyed red and oh my some of us won't want to give this one up badger skins and em wood oil for the light spices for the anointing oil and for sweet incense onks stones stones to be set in the ephod and in the breastplate and let them see this was not a priestly effort it was a people effort it was a congregation effort a bride of christ effort and let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them heavenly father we just ask you lord come down the service today lord just the little hesitancy there is we ask in the name of jesus christ you break it this morning let liberty flow lord for those who are free are free indeed and lord we set here this morning a free people now lord we ask for your moving among the saints the spirit of god to anoint us today lord that we might speak freely lord according to thy word in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated now we won't go into the entirety of it because there's a lot of do this and do that and locate it this way and let it face this way and let it face that way but we are seeing here my brother and sister uh in the book of exodus god's directions for the building of the tabernacle and just as we can look into the scripture and see the directions for the building of the physical tabernacle in the wilderness my brother and sister we can look through the word of god today and see the very exacting direct directions for the building of this tabernacle the dwelling place of god in the day that we live in and so we have the directions in the word of how to go about this god didn't have some haphazard he didn't say you know uh if you can't get a hold of this then just go ahead and scrounge around till you find something god had very exacting directions and we assume sometimes right assuming it's not a not a great thing because we assume sometimes that god just made all of these ingredients for building the tabernacle convenient for them like they said well i'll take care of collecting all of the stones here because why there's already this massive pile and all i have to do is walk over and collect out of them in many cases my brother and sister it took effort and it took time to bring about what it took to build a tabernacle because you know the haphazard building of something never yields the results uh you know there's a story about the man who was the uh the carpenter's foreman right and how that he had built many fine homes and he done all those things and and there's uh one last home before the gentleman the builder was retiring and the foreman uh you know the story don't you and he's burnt out and he says you know i'm just gonna do and and so he goes and instead of getting the faucets that he was told to get you know the gold faucets he gets just a gold-plated faucet and he gets this and he gets that and the draperies instead of being of the finest that it was uh required in the plans he gets a substitute and when it gets all done he what he was doing was he was realizing i have no retirement i have no house on my own and it's all coming to an end and and so i'm going to take this money i've been commissioned and i'm going to take this money to to take it into my own retirement but yet when it's all done the builder the master builder hands him the keys to the house and so what he now has my brother and sister instead of something he can live in proud of his own craftsmanship and his own leadership he's living in a house that's shoddy and every time i can assure you that he pocketed he put back into that house trying to make up for its deficiency when this quit and that quit and that fell apart and so god's not looking for someone just to build a gaudy house he's not looking for us you go through the message i in my studies here several quotes i'll get sidetracked into them where brother branham's talking about giving our best giving our best giving our best he never talks about do what's convenient or what's easy he talks about doing our best giving our best and you say but giving my best is not convenient in my life i'm very busy my job this that and the other keeps me my brother and sister he didn't say it would be easy he said if you would do it then he would bless you i brought this up the other day but as i was studying i felt to put this to the page and the word of god and the message of the hour shows us how we should behave in church prophet of god puts it this way we should never frolic we should never have conversation that has no meaning no reason no purpose we need to remember that this sanctuary is god's sanctuary it's not our sanctuary it's not just a room in a building but it's god's tabernacle and yet you know while we be concerned about this tabernacle here and our behavior and what we do uh you know the prophet says you know you need to talk to someone you want to visit with them go out from here go to the foyer go to someone's home whatever that we would honor this tabernacle not to just have frivolous conversation amen but the prophet steps right into another realm and says you know that the tabernacle that god is most concerned with is this one so if we can give honor to god in this tabernacle a building that we've dedicated to god god gave us this building saints you know this story when it was all said and done more than 20 groups here in this city were asking the realtor if they don't buy that if they can't buy that call us first one pastor called him every morning promptly at nine o'clock i believe it was nine or ten o'clock every single morning have they backed out yet now you know what he was praying for he was praying that we started counting up our pennies and found out we didn't have near enough i stand here today and say i know god gave us this building for god desired amen saints list we know what we prayed for i know that sister jerry and i scoured this city physically and online in to end almost every single day in one form or another we were scouring this city looking for a place everything you guys would look at me and go you're crazy looked at everything from warehouses that still had piles of scrap metal stacked outside of them to buildings that were beyond our thoughts and i talked to them and said you know you should discount this to us and they said we probably would but just yesterday somebody made an offer and we're sure it's more than what your offer would be but when the right season comes want to know a little history of this the very house that we purchased over off the boulevard believing we were going to build a church there i was convinced we're building a church here god gave us his property we made such a lowball offer for that property i thought there's no way on earth they'll accept it but they accepted it but you see there's a side story you don't know and that is that brother ivan and sister olga and his family were looking to buy the same property but when i expressed interest they stepped away i kinda in a way regret that brother ivan would be living right over here and sit away off over there far far beyond the horizon but when god says i'm going to give you something see we didn't see the plan saints we could not see that and god says but i've got a tabernacle for you and we in our humanness don't see the plan of god what he has for us we we're caught up in the here and the now in my circumstance and this is my reasons why and god says i want you to catch a greater vision to look at the tabernacle that i have for you a tabernacle that will be filled with something more precious than stones in gold and silver and brass it'll be filled with my very life my very presence it'll be filled with me hallelujah and that's what god's desiring today and he's comes and expresses that amen amen he's desiring to see a building literal that he can dwell in but he's looking more so saints and and you're with me i know this and looking more so for a building not made with hands that he can dwell in looking for that place that he can claim as his own he doesn't want to come and be my brother and sister the co-renter a cohabitor i just seen a little ad man has leased i i like i like people's optimism in this day hopefully it's not misplaced for this man he just leased right here in the city of nampa a luxury apartment that he can't afford the rent on and now he's searching for someone of the right character and morals that would rent the other room so that he can live in this community that he wants to live in well i'll tell you my brother and sister there's a community i want to live in hallelujah i don't have to pay the rent i just have to pay a price like my lord jesus the price is i give this tabernacle to him it's no longer my tabernacle i don't have to take care of the upkeep you say yes you do brother paul you need to pray and read your bible my brother and sister there's people out here whose lives are a wreck pray and read their bible so when you think that just praying and reading your bible fulfills what brother branham said to make you a christian you're wrong because there's people praying and reading their bible and they're being served divorce papers or bankruptcy papers or whatever kind of papers not medical this and medical vat and science psychology this and that and you say so no i'm sorry my brother and sister it's not the praying and the reading of the bible it's you reaching to the throne of god it's your prayers coming up as a sweet odor before god hallelujah because it's nothing that we can do otherwise we'll have people out here that will totally ace you off of the boss because they spend endless hours of their life completely committed beyond measure amen in fact you can go right in the message and the prophet of god says that you'll find out here in the denomination there are people much more sincere than you our sincerity won't do it oh we ought to be thankful today for the plan of god be thankful that you were included in that plan hallelujah so he's desiring to see not only this natural tabernacle for him to dwell in but my brother and sister god's excited this morning i hope you're with me i hope my enthusiasm is undue place this morning to realize that god is excited to see a tabernacle to dwell in he's looking and seeing a people saying lord come and fill me come live here lord i can't afford i can't do this lord but if you would come and live with me live in me let me lord be what you want me to be hallelujah now we look my brother and sister i'll just get this off my chest no doubt some of you think what's been wrong with brother paul lately i've been battling with a complex about the size of a bus so if you're uncomfortable with what i preached this morning say amen because you know that brother paul is living what he's preaching today instead of trying to be great we ought to be trying trying to find out how little we can get does that not go contrary to human nature does that not go contrary to everything that we as humans pursue and do see then god can use this i've got several scriptures written out here that i should be i love this i'm telling i can't some people don't like brother branham's voice some people don't like what he says oh it bothers them so much i'm telling you i i relate to him i relate to him here's a man that's down here at my level he wasn't some sanhedrin counsel top of the class graduate that has the bible memorized he's a man that's there saying now i know it's a scripture and then you hear on a tape a voice in the background correct that oh yes that's right come on just a common man as it were i got scriptures written out here i should be referring to i suppose but i we i probably i think you'll see why i like this quote won't have time to do it i don't know where the time goes but we are noticed that it takes the weakest and the rejected and practically every hero god ever had on the front line was that type of person a person that was rejected a person that that thought he was insufficient a person that had no ability at all then that person's just in good shape so god can start using him and the very moment we start thinking i can't do this i can't do this i can't do this lord i'm just i just can't do this you hear a little voice wonderful wonderful you mean you're going to quit striving you're going to quit laboring you're going to quit oh this my struggle hallelujah then that person's just in good shape so god can start using him that's right it's when they feel like they can't they haven't got nothing that's when god can take a hold of them and do something with them see now saints i've been on the other end of this stick where i've had people voice to me unfortunately ministers or whatever anyway it doesn't matter what their other occupation is because their occupation didn't give them the attitude they have a spirit did you're right and these people will voice to you things like i'll have you to know i've been preaching this message for 45 years i'll have you to know i still haven't attained the status of preacher yet i am a guy i don't say this boastfully but i i'm a guy i'm like lord please can you just make this service today go good well people walk out and say hey i understood him today but you see that spirit saints it don't matter who it resides on we've been following brother branham for 45 years 50 years i've been in the services i've this like that my brother and sister none of that matters none of that matters it's all where we stand with him our lord jesus it's no matter we are not going to be as it were like a union carpenter that whether you're incompetent or not you can show i belong to the union for 40 years you have to give me a job it doesn't work that way no amen that's right when they feel like they can't they haven't got nothing that's when god can take a hold of them and do something with them see but when we are thinking that we are able to do it then god can't use us because we're wanting to do it ourselves and so we're going to do this because i think this is the right way to do it i we use those verbage right we use those words i think we should do this but it's not about the verbiage of the words that we use it's about the heart that's behind it because if you're prayed through and absolutely confirmed that you know this is what god wants you to do you can say i feel led to do this and you're not speaking of you now let's go right back right here my brother and sister and and uh just look at this i don't want to get sidetracked today there's so much to sidetrack me it's just uh it's just unreal um i'm going to blame it on brother branham because if he had been stingy with the material he gave us if he had give us such a limited amount of things to refer to then it would be easy to say the one the only time brother brown ever said this but when you look and there's 363 times you're like well i'd like to refer to every one of those and you realize i can't but i'm tempted to amen and then on the other side we get these feelings now see he's preaching a balanced message you know to be brother ivan's there's a big long level down there in the basement i thought about fetching that you know brother george puts that little level up here i thought about getting that big long level that's down there in the basement and we could make sure that we balanced hallelujah then on the other side well balances then on the other side we get these feelings and we think that we're insufficient now i don't want you to embarrass yourself but i can say this morning this is something that that i i would call it a complex but we we get to thinking we're sufficient now look what these next words are because this is where the devil steps into your insufficiency and we don't want to do it i i'm not able i can't do this i i make so many mistakes i'm a message believer i claim i'm a message believer i confess i'm a message believer but i must not be because i make way too many mistakes compared to who look at the life of saul my brother and sister the prophet of god said we'll see him one day a man but wait the man god used to replace him he's got quite a list his own self if we look at that doesn't he so god's not looking at that side of it my brother and sister it's not the battle that you are in it's how you react to that battle if you decide i'm giving up and you do give up then you're defeated it's done but if you are there now i hope you'll do this because i'm going to counter dick myself in just a few minutes in these words but you're there in the midst of the battle and you say i can't do it anymore i'm quitting you know what on the one side because god knows your heart he looks at your heart and says oh good they quit trying to do it themselves and in our mind we're talking about quitting but god's looking at it because he looked at the heart and said oh they're quitting good now i can do it but then there is the one that says i'm quitting and walks away and in a transformation like you can see they're in service one day shouting hallelujah and the next week they're naked harley in a pool in mexico there's a difference why because god looked down on the heart and he knew that's my child my child's finally reached the point to realize that he's not the one who's called to do this i called him to be the vessel i do it through the one i do it with the one i do it in we don't want to do it but then if we just listen to the call of god what's he dealing with the flesh no sir that call is down to the soul that's the call that you can't even explain why when you're discouraged that you stand up and you do it again that's the call that when you feel like you have utterly failed god you get up and say lord i am sorry and i will do better by your grace next time and people will say i don't know i think that guy's a hypocrite because it seems like he just has a lot of problems well i'll tell you what how many times does the scripture say that we should forgive one another in a day i went to valley view so somebody tell me what that math adds up to 490 times a day okay let's not get too complicated but somebody divide that by the minute or let's just settle for the hour that's too difficult let's settle for the daylight hours just divide that by 12. do you realize saints we have problems with each other come on saints that's right we have problems with each other and we get into what i call the arm crossing mode where it's like if they had just listened to me or if they would do what i want or if they saw it like this that's right let's get back to the word are we word-based church let's get back to the word i'ma lord forgive them again you'd have a hard time bearing a grudge if we would follow the word because we would spend a lot of time saying lord forgive me and lord forgive them hallelujah but you know what we like to what we like to do is we like to be what i would call forgiveness or mercy hoarders and we'll save it for days weeks months years and think we can probably just cover it with one i forgive you after 20 years that's good the cancer didn't eat them at hu the cancer of unforgiveness ate you no one else was affected by that spirit but you well i wouldn't say that you might be affecting husband wife children parents yeah but you understood what i was meaning when we are insufficient ourselves then we are subject to yield to god's spirit and as long as we think we can do it then we can't do it that's often times the position we have a you know little be setting sins in our life lord i i don't know why i tend to exaggerate i'm not gonna exaggerate i'm not gonna exaggerate no more lord did i ever tell you about the time and we just fall right in that trap again because you ain't gonna do it you couldn't do it in the beginning you're not going to do it now why don't we just stop and say lord i'm not going to quit doing these little white petty lies unless lord you come on the scene and help me i'm powerless to stop the very nature and you can look in a family unfortunately i am thinking of a family grandpa daddy sons now they're sons that's right i always called it the big windy i ever tell you about the time i was over here this guy was like six seven ex-marine been special forces but i put my finger now this brother's about this tall i put my finger in his nose you can't reach his nose and i told him except for i'm feeling kind of nice today i'd knock you down and i trash you wait you get winded taking the trash out much less trashing somebody just camping kinda like we joke i think brother adam will appreciate this as a fisherman right the old deal you know where fishermen get together and it's like i caught one about that pig you know it's in the nature oh my let's move on but when we get to place we know we can do it then we yield ourselves to god and he does it then if it's us trying to do it we'll fail but if we'll just yield ourselves to god then god can't fail there's only one thing that god can't cannot do and that's fail he can do anything else but fail he cannot fail can i get a name in this morning amen we're speaking to the lord not to brother paul now you know saints i thought this is interesting uh brother jason uh uh you know sent out a little text this morning and um i'm actually very very happy that he did and and my phone dings and it's like hey are there any specials and i just kind of being me i just was like hey sister jerry jerry are you gonna are you gonna sing this morning she says oh i don't know i'll think about it so that's to the depth of what i knew my wife was going to sing but yet she now sings today a song that is speaking of being molded and right here in my in my uh notes here we have to understand my brother and sister what god is doing he is molding the character of the architecture of the tabernacle amen if you're a little stumped by that i'll just encourage you to go look in dictionary and see what it means the style of god is molding the style of the believer that's exactly right amen did you know we have a fashion god and we have a language god and we have a behavior god because all of these things are wrapped up in his nature that when we have him we have his fashion we have his name just go right down through it from head to toe finger the finger he's got it covered amen right he's all oh i need hallelujah i don't need you know anyway some of you might be wearing a shirt that's got that on there so i won't say anything but you see god's molding the character of the architecture of this tabernacle god didn't come along and said now you guys are out in the wilderness and there's not much out here what i want you to do is just throw up some little spot and i want you to throw a mercy seat in there and i want you to just whatever you can find put it together know what did you do he gave them such detailed direction and i'm telling you my brother and sister i just believe this is all my heart if i'm wrong lord correct me but i'm quite sure that not murmuring in the sense of being negative but we'll talk on merman in a minute but they'll be like going where are we going to find that where are we going to find enough badger skins and i can see brother has a revelation he's like looking around the congregation of israel i see a lot about your skin i've seen enough badger skins to build four or five of these tabernacles hallelujah i don't know let's see two four five square feet five square feet two and a half square feet three square feet three square feet i'll stop while i'm ahead oh my goodness god didn't say when you come along and you find that might be a decade from now no he said you're going to build me a place you're going to build me a tabernacle and this is what you're going to do and when you get all done we go we're going to step off away from these directions now saints and look at this but you see when it come all done god had a place and he even had a direction that the mercy seat must face we cannot face hollywood we cannot face paris we cannot face laodicea we have to face calvary we can't have one foot my brother in the world and one foot in the word and say we're balanced that's not what balanced is so as we look at this how that god had a desire to mold the character now i use those fancy words they just kind of come to me as i was studying but god's molding your character now i want to ask you my brother and sister do you feel excited when you fall on your face can someone quote me the scripture that concerns that brothers count it all joy amen what do you mean it all joy when you encounter fiery is that what it says no sir when you fall in fiery trials now you notice the scripture doesn't say anything about you getting back up in that why because god's speaking to sons and daughters of god so the standing back up is what we would call a given are you with me amen god god's like no they're not going to stay down they're going to fall down and they're going to stop and say you know what oh lord forgive me i mean oh why lord why like losing your cool let me tell you about it natural typing spiritual so in our house here recently one of these first world problems that we have just kept getting warmer and warmer and warmer and warmer and when you reach the point that you put a fan in the window on the shady side of your house and it's 98 outside and you can stand in front of that fan and say oh i feel cooler you know you're hot and they come and they recharge the system and they run a sniffer over everything and they're like oh okay and just a few short days thermostat set it's getting warmer warmer warmer well it turns out out in the unit outside when they built it they put two tubes together the vibration of the machine wore a hole but you couldn't see it and the sniffer didn't detect it but boy i tell you what i wasn't comfortable in my own house when the heat got turned up oh we were talking about you losing your cool do you know the same thing happens one of those reasons the prophet of god told you pray every day it recharges read your bible every day recharges what are you doing well we know do you know saints i've used this type many times through the years i believe it's valid the holy ghost is like gas to a believer you're living in laodicea you're facing every challenge the devil's got but did you know that it slowly goes away the longer you are from the last time you recharged the easier it is for you to lose your cool do you get it or should i be a little more blunt who wants blood nobody okay we'll just move on then but you see that's why you've got to recharge my brother and sister because otherwise we'll find ourselves losing our cool over this and over that and over little circumstances that don't even matter oh hey brother paul are you listening yes i am okay good you see what happens my brother and sister we weren't designed to deal with that we weren't designed to be caught in that we were designed to let off the pressure give it to god let god do it and when the world starts falling apart and the pressure starts to come on you you can sit there and say well you know what i have a promise i have a promise you see because god's not a cookie cutter god and neither are you he's not just oh you know i'll just any away away let me kind of back that up that'll be misunderstood god is a cookie cutter god let me change that because he's the same yesterday today and forever he'll always be the same but we're not quickly christians right we're not oreos i love oreos as an example i heard i heard a brother one time use that he goes you know what people think that believers message believers are like oreos we got cookie we got cream we got cookie we got cookie we got cream we got cookie we got cookie we got cream we got cookie praise god we're message believers champs champ stamps now i can only preach for my position but how many of you hold your hands up and count that you've got one two three four five scabs on your hand today we're not cookie cutters because if you housewives are home and you've got five scabs on your hand you need to wash the knives separate you'll make my point god's not just gonna you go through a fiery trial someone appears being blessed beyond measure you're going through a time of a drought and somebody over here almost is like wow lord just you just pouring out your spirit on me i don't and and the church see has this dynamic and if we're not careful we'll be over here brother trevor you and i will be like going why are they rejoicing look at that oh no them guys over there look at them i mean the preacher just ripped the height off of me and they're over there going hallelujah i think they don't like us no sir they're in the midst of a monsoon you're in a drought but the season comes because in the monsoon is when it produces all the beautiful flowers in the desert you know a few years ago we were down there arizona when they just had a really rainy season i never knew there was so many flowers in the desert even the cactus was blooming and i know you guys what you guys think about sister so-and-so but you get her in the right condition and she'll bloom yes sir hallelujah look each one of us being molded to the calling in our life had somebody ask me that's a young person brother paul is it wrong for me to go to university and get a degree in engineering and then maybe go on and get a master's and a phd in engineering and i said sister do you ever plan on getting married oh brother paul with all of my heart i want to get married to this you know and she describes this guy and i'm like oh i know who he is i don't want to have three or four children or maybe five i and you're going to engineer what butter on the table food on the floor oh look at this pile of diapers you're gonna engineer what but she had a desire right she's not married right now she's an architect but whoever marries her will have a very um lovely girl it's their family it's their family i i i feel just i i need to explain that it's her family she would be there and you just have to know her brothers and her dad i humiliated her dad in church one time by coming when he was sleeping in church and stood right by the end of his pew and preached and the whole church was looking at me and here's the brother i regretted that but i couldn't take it back it's on video but this little girl is of the nature that her dad or her brothers would be doing something she'd be just like make room you're not doing it right now if she marries her shut up paul i tell you what she'll either raise children that are brow beaten or bossy as she is one each one molded for the character in their life have you ever noticed my brother and sister how god works i know many a person right now that fits in this they were raised in a family of alcoholics and never taken a drink in their life something in that relationship molded them and they said i will never be what that is my what my father is what my my mother is or what aunts and uncles or grandparents i'll never be that amen critical atmosphere produce patience and kindness ungodly upbringing produce a desire to serve god is this just something natural that happened no it isn't that was the atmosphere of god molding the architecture of the tabernacle and we say i had a terrible childhood i had this i had that i don't care what you had it was god molding you or we don't believe god's in control come on some of you need to say amen god's either in control or he's not and if he's not we're dismissed that's right we don't like it i want to repeat this to you the molding of the character of the architecture of the tabernacle if you ever i like architecture i have seen a little deal that said if you was what you wanted to be when you was a child what would that be and i would be an architect right now i loved a ruler i loved all of those things um i loved drawing i loved to do that it's all disappeared somewhere in the past i haven't done those things that passion i wouldn't say it died but it's way way behind me you don't see paul sitting down drawing things well actually you will you'll see us in our farm shop on our big metal bench going now that thing needs to have an arm right here to brace this and this needs to have this and you got to have two holes right here and you got to do this thing right here but none of that nice neat stuff that little nice block writing anybody like that little block writing isn't that cool especially when you walk a real architect that's practicing and he's there and he's just riding as fast as you can any other way and he's making all these little perfect knowledge and you're like wow how does he do that practice was i called to be an architect i guess not the molding of the architecture oh this is after early new england this is classic fair period friends this is classic this this is architecture remnants of venice you see they they're taking it connecting it to a period of time do you realize the architecture of you and i this is of the god era this is of the holy ghost-filled era being molded into that architecture that we would be a reflection that people would look and say that looks to me like jesus christ that is of the era of the overhead and angry that is the era of the uncommitted i recognize that architecture it's of the uncommitted now that's a little rude but i'm not feeling so polite these last few services as you probably recognized this sounds very hit or country but it really serves a point my dad on the farm my dad taught us several things some of them i can't discuss here just because it's just very human nature but my dad several things he taught us as kids he says son always look and see what's on the other side of the fence before you jump over ah well big deal until one day i climbed over a barbed wire fence when i was probably about seven years old and i didn't realize there was a ditch on the other side and now i hop a leg over the barbed wire fence and my foot's out there going and then i come and it snags the inside of my pants the pants i wasn't supposed to be wearing because they were my school pants and i hear it going crap and blood is running down my leg because it ripped this big old hole in my leg and all i can think of is i'm dead my daddy also told me you can straddle the fence until you come to a fence post and then it gets very uncomfortable and did you know if we saints come on saints if we're straddling any kind of offense in our life god will put the post there he's going to make you get off one side or the other he won't leave you straddling a fence hallelujah my daddy also taught me assume every electric fence is hot now look i need to hurry up go along here amen now let's see what we skip here we look real quick here well brothers it's all right no problem may the lord know something we don't know here we miss the third exodus or else i skipped over we missed the third exodus i'll just read it to you third exodus 63 6 and 30 right close to this time of the year faith finds the word it's sanctuary of rest it moves right up on top that eternal rock christ jesus the word and lays down there and rests you ever wonder why you feel so mentally spiritually weary because we haven't been resting well i just feel thrashed i haven't been sleeping good at night there's another kind of rest that's much more important than natural rest let the winds howl let the storm shake she is safe ever more she rests right there on that word that's where faith genuine christian faith rests resting place is the word for it knows that god will never it knows that god will ever prove himself superior god will ever prove himself superior every one of his own over one of over every one of his enemies no matter how bad it looks how the enemy has come in and how it looked like you're defeated faith still knows amen that's right you might say something like well i i just don't know in our household i don't know how things could get any worse well praise the lord you know i have a really bad habit church i hope i don't offend one of you when i look out and i see one of you that i feel oh this opinionated isn't it brother trevor that i feel it's not doing what you should of course it's out of the book of paul right you know what i do hope you're not offended i pray lauren take the wheels off the wagon let somebody steal the donkey that the crops wither up let time just be so hard on them until they change and you say brother paul that's just plain cruel no it isn't because i close my prayer out lord thy will be done so therefore it's no longer me praying for you to have the wheels fall off your wagon your me will die and crops burn up but you see there's no use this saints oh god this person that person lord they're just they're just not even i just pray lord you come and dump a special blessing on them and just know that they just know that you love them you know i mean it takes right i wasn't molded in that same architecture me i'm like lord let the wheels fall off their wagon i believe they're a seed of god see there's the difference i'm not going to cuddle them into serving god you know the saints i don't coddle you i don't come around your houses oh you know you're watching movies every night and you're doing this and skipping church and oh please come to church no i'm sorry i'm not going to do that i'm going to preach to you you know what you better straighten up or the wheels are falling off your wagon because i'm over here and i'm telling you i don't sound boastful this morning but god answers my prayers amen and i've got a list way too long i could just share with you god answers my prayer and i just pray lord whatever it takes let this brother let this sister let these young people lord whatever it takes to get them to serve because i believe that you're sons and daughters of god if i believed anything different then i would just be a cruel and vindictive man but i'm not cruel and i'm not vindictive i know that you're sons and daughters of god and i just pray lord whatever it takes for them to come and finally say lord i give up now we've all watched a little wrestling here or there haven't we and you get that guy you get him all there and he's got all kinds of names some of them different names so the same move but you got his arm jacked up behind his ear you've got his left leg sucked up so tight he thinks his knees popping off and the guy finally says enough and he reaches over on the mat snapped out if the half nelson won't do it for you saints i'll pray that god will put a full nelson on you with a leg wrap and put a spine twist on you well you're laying there oh god i can't go another moment i can't go into the food i can't go another but you know some praise the lord when i was in high school they had me watered up in a knot on the floor i could hear my tendons tearing but i forced my way out of it praise god they couldn't beat me that guy's in church now sits in his favorite spot and every time the holy spirit moves he's like that's right i can get myself out of anything i don't need god to do it i heard somebody say ouch be kind to me saints okay somebody smile number seven verses 88-89 and all the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace offerings were 20 and four bullocks in the ram 60 and the goat 60 and the lambs of the first year 60 this was the dedication of the altar after that it was anointed now we are in the time of the tabernacle and when moses had gone into the tabernacle of the congregation to speak with him then he heard the voice of one speaking to him from off the mercy seat that was upon the ark of testimony from between the two cherubims and spake unto him amen now i want you to take this i hope you grasp where i'm coming from this is the place that you and i need to be we need to be behind that veil we got to be in the presence of god and we got to be in such a condition that god would speak to us we wouldn't think it was somebody on the outside we would stop and listen to what god had to say to us lord what is it that you want come on please put your name in there what do you want me to do lord what is it and you see in this case god was dealing with moses so we go right over into the book of numbers or into the next chapter chapter 8 and and so it was there i want to make this type and then we'll just get this all wrapped up here real quick here amen look at this now numbers 8 verse 16 for they were holy given unto me we preached last sunday my did you guys look at me all somber last sunday i went home with more of a complex i was like man people just sitting there looking at me like where did i come from or at least that's what i thought you might say they need to know what we thought brother paul well see that's how complex this work that's it i thought i went home i told jerry in the car well i couldn't even get an amen and she's like what are you talking about people were aiming and all over the church no they weren't yes they were no they weren't we got in a fight yes anymore no they weren't yes they were no they weren't my complex says no they weren't thank you brother tim made my point see so we see there that without the blood on the doorpost and the lentil the firstborn died there was no look you don't know who i am i'm i'm important i can trace my lineage all the way back every one of them could there was no separator in the natural saints it was whether the blood was on the doorpost now we look at this and i want to drive this point home to you uh very briefly this morning if i can lord help me so he says here uh for they were wholly given unto me from among the children of israel instead of such as open every womb even instead of the firstborn of all the children of israel have i taken them unto me for all the firstborn of the children of israel are mine both man and beast on the day that i smote every first born in the land of egypt i sanctified them for myself you see this wasn't just judgment that went through the land my brother and sister you see god knew that they would be fathers that were anointed of the spirit of god that even if maybe they hadn't been living right you got to understand the history of of israel in egypt my brother and sister they were not following the rules because that's how they viewed them rules and from one generation to the next generation brother chris did a masterful job i thought on wednesday talking traditions one generation of israel to the next come to their sons and their daughters then their son-in-laws daughter-in-laws this is the rules but when that next generation come along they presented to him this is the rules and then the next generation come along come on humor me saints they presented to him this is the rules and the next generation come along this is the rules and part two and part three and part four and five and six wait this is too hard to carry around let's just publish them in a book and then let's make everyone look like an unbeliever that doesn't endorse the book you realize the message is not exempt from that that's right brother chris was pretty funny actually i i took that as funny because that kept me from crying and saying alex but you see my brother and sister we come along it's like no if we're message believers we do this i like that brother chris we sing three songs we preach for this just this long because brother brown said and then we do this and we do that some lines on the message will say oh no we gotta anoint everyone in oil another comes along and says the word says over here that we are now christ in the flesh anointed and you don't have to oh no they'll never be healed unless you anoint them oh oh oh what about this what about that do you know sisters i like this i'm a man i can go in public like this they don't know if i'm a heathen or a saint but sisters praise the lord that sister's really got the holy ghost how do you know she's got the holy ghost her skirts all the way to the floor oh okay let me tell you about carrie not our carrie let me tell you about our carrie you tell me if you haven't those of you were here in those days haven't seen a lady come and see the washing of the water of the word and just keep watching and washing to the sister kerry we know today oh i'm telling you right there you need a testimony of what god will do our sister carrie will be a perfect testimony but let me tell you about this other carry sister jerry and i we're taking farm business management we're in the at the university we're taking these classes and there's this lady just the sweetest spirit i felt a kindred spirit with her immediately her and jerry just didn't take no time along there chatting it up sitting together doing this stuff and and carried she she always very modest she always wore these dresses that were pretty much to her ankles and she had the just long beautiful hair and she just had this countenance about her and we enjoyed her company and it would be a lunch break and we went to lunch with her one time and then another time and then another time and got comfortable and i was like gary where do you go to church i'm a hippie i don't go to church oh so much the longer addresses how much holy ghost long hair means they're a christian true story true story fortunately carrick was of the nature and she says i knew you and jerry were different and i'm good with that so we see chapter seven the voice speaking to moses we see an eight this claim that god is making that he is now back in egypt the covenant of the firstborn he's taking that smote every firstborn in the land of egypt i sanctified them for myself and i've taken the levites for all the firstborn of the children of israel this is what i was talking about how god will have something over here it was a literal firstborn at the death angel coming but god now says you know what i'm going to do because i'm going to create praise the lord i'm going to create something that goes beyond a natural birth a natural association a natural seed line and i'm going to bring this firstborn out of the natural and i'm going to place it in the spiritual and he says i take the levites now and call them my firstborn amen and then he draws them into a call for god and so then on through time in israel it's no longer as it were still the inheritance the birthright those things are still first born but that position where god judged them or claimed them was no longer connected as it were in just the first born in the natural okay let me hurry here now look my brother and sister i want you to do a side note here uh aside the very fathers that put blood over the door very fathers have put blood over the door what happens they leave out of egypt do your history we're not talking about years later decades later we're talking about a very short amount of time later some discrepancy some dispute amongst people exactly the days but we're not even talking a year and those same fathers come to the red sea these are the men who kill the lamb put the blood over the door their son stood there and said daddy neddy i can hear that death angel daddy he's like it's all right son i put the blood over the door everything's be fine just just just calm down son this is this very same daddy comes to the red sea and says moses you brought us here to die to kill us saints you see how satan can turn that they stood right there with confidence killed the lamb put the blood over the door but in a short while the circumstances are different they're standing there looking at the red sea and they're seeing pharaoh's chariots coming and they're murmuring now to moses why did you bring us out here to kill us we would that we had just stayed in egypt i was actually developing an appetite for garlic and leeks with enough salt enough pepper a little butter you can get them down see what happened just because god moved supernatural once doesn't mean that's the finished work you go back before the throne of god every single day right one filling many refillings of the holy ghost we can't just go now look i i'll step over this real quick i i got four notes here amen they saw the supernatural still murmured hey man and they got to the date of decision which was katie sparnia and it was so ingrained the murmur are you with me so ingrained the murmur that while they knew what joshua and caleb were saying was the truth what did they do fell back to their training and they murmured and the scripture says all of israel wept that day joshua caleb and their families wept because the others turned the word down those that were the men who stood in egypt and had the courage to put kill the lamb and put the blood believe that they wept because they just walked watched everything vaporize from in front of me but you know here i i just have to touch on this real quick you see my brother and sister grace tabernacle listen to me listen well when they had to show down out in the desert that whole crowd come and they told moses you take too much upon yourself you we're spiritual just as spiritual as you are you recognize where that spirit come because let's go behind the tent door okay can we do that they're all in there now having their little deal we're going to unzip the tent in order to step in we're going to slide along the upholstery here nobody's going to see us and they're in there well they did this and i didn't agree they did that and they shouldn't have they should ask us what about this over here no i tell you i would never allow that to happen if i had no i would do this once zip the tenant what were they doing instead of coming to moses and saying moses why are you doing what you're doing moses could have come and said well guys don't look at me it's not my fault let's go right back here let's thumb back through our book going back in time and god said i will lead you out of egypt with a mighty hand and they could have stopped and said that's right it ain't you moses okay sorry moses sorry we bothered you we were murmuring we were questioning we were faulting you and it wasn't you the whole time it was mighty hand but the training come on saint yes i have a point behind this murmuring will never fix the problem now paul here speaking of the valley or the shadow rather the law being the shadow of good things to come could never make the worshiper perfect then he goes on to show what per the perfection is now it's a strange thing that this is so much thought of people they say well i'm weak my faith is not very much i'm not a very good christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language then see you mustn't never say that don't never let your testimony be negative i'll lift a hand right in front of you and say god forgive me god forgive me let it be positive all the time i am safe can somebody speak that with me i am saved i have god in my heart i believe him with all my heart you believe in divine healing with all my heart let your testimony always and your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it well my when it starts that don't entertain it will you say i can't help thoughts from coming well i'd be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he could sure stop them from roosting so that that's a good thing you see you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them just pass it on no sir jesus christ is my savior all things are mined by god and i'm going to keep them i'm going to testify them and god can only bless you as you confess that he has done it for you see he's the high priest of our confession is that right hebrews 3 he said he's going he that he said that he's the high priest of our confession he can only do for us as we accept it believe it amen and confess it imagine let's just use katie sparnia for just a moment what if every one of them had caught the revelation of the hour of that and they'd looked out there and here would have been the other 10 preachers and they were there coming back from the land and yes it's taken two men to carry a pole with this just big huge clusters of grapes and and and they you you notice they never denied what was in the land not a single one of them denied what was in the land they didn't say we went over there and there's nothing there it's just a desert they testified of everything god promised them that they come along and said but laodicea is greater than us it's too big of a giant to be conquered in this hour our children i've heard this out of the mouth of mothers inside what we call a message saying how can our children stand in this day it's so wicked and i said sister they'll stand they'll be young people stand because the word says so in it what i see out here it wasn't what was on the other side of that river the word said that he would claim them young and old and take them into the promise that's all we got to do don't sit here and say i don't know i got a problem with my son i got a problem with my daughter i don't know about this i don't know about that well i don't know about where your thinking is at you can stop and you can confess there are a problem or you can go on and say god fill my children with the holy ghost move upon them let me be the kind of father that kills a lamb puts the blood over the poles but also let me be the father that when it comes to crossing the river i can say son come with me the promise is on the other side it's not here and just march right in the water and be that kind of father comes down to katie's barney and some would say oh my preacher says my preacher says my preacher says i don't care what your preacher says the word says the word says and that's what we believe son daughter what the word says because if we go by experience i'm talking natural hallelujah so just left my sons and my daughters in egypt really no holy ghost-filled father ever make that kind of declaration no holy ghost father husband let's stop and say i'd probably be better off without her what you're saying is god's not in control oh hey and let me be a little spiteful if you think you can live without them maybe they can live without you ouch how many are you here today on we have a promise or not amen he said he's the high priest of our confession what is it you want to confess saints oh yes sir amen let's just take a moment do a little confessing before we go sister emmy would you call musicians revelations the fifth chapter we're going to take a little confession right out of here okay is that all right so we close when you're taking the book the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them their harps golden vials full of voters which are the prayers of the saints amen hallelujah every prayer i ever prayed every prayer you ever prayed is you might say figuratively stored right there in the presence of god had a man one day tell me he says brother paul he says my wife my children it's just a wreck it's falling apart i don't think we can ever fix it he said what bothers me the most is he says my prayers have just went to the ceiling or off into he is the word ether often to the ether it made no difference you know things i know you'd probably be shocked to think i could be a point in time that i didn't have something to say i was stunned speechless [Music] and i asked you listen brother look me in the face you really believe that he wouldn't look me in the face you know why it's down in his heart they're still a faintest flicker [Music] but you know what it happened and this affects you and me oh he'd been speaking the negative so long he was watching it come to pass before his eyes he was not seeing god come down and change the situation because he wasn't speaking of god changing the situation he was speaking of what was wrong and the counterproductive thing for the day and how that it was just disintegrating around he was speaking the words of destruction [Music] he looked at me and he says you really believe that and i said i sure do believe it because i practice it both ways i have practiced it [Music] both hard saints to watch a grown man that's been around the message for most of his life break down and weep but that's what he needed to do because he'd been saying i don't understand why my family is not healthy here take a little more step tonight i don't understand why i don't feel like the lord loves me i'll take a little more stupid night i don't feel like this a little more strict time something wrong with our church a little more stupid night then pretty soon he's like what's wrong everything's falling apart everything's dying well what have you been feeding remember the little story about the dogs amen black dog white dog come on whichever one you feed the most [Music] come on what are we doing saints now you might think this is counterproductive you say brother paul where are you coming from but i'm telling you i'm laying the foundation for the mercy seat amen god's in control saints he knows exactly what it is now look let's just close with this and we'll go into first peter here's a confession worth confessing is it not now the e in here is you right and you is a sheep and we have lambs in our midst so what we got to do is approach this from a family approach here not just me not just you we're not separated i am my family my family is me and you are my family whether you like it or not [Music] the g or a chosen generation i'm going to say amen to that this morning i am a chosen generation because the word i i cut my other portion short my brother and sister they were those men that they were there they failed they failed they didn't go over they died in the wilderness but god had used them in such a fashion that their children which would have included the firstborn the firstborn that might have looked out the window and said daddy i'm scared i see the death angel daddy and that daddy god used him enough to lay a foundation and say son don't worry the blood is over the door you're gonna be all right this is now that young man who is standing there and when judgment is spoke over israel they realize i'm under the age [Music] come on saints i don't care what the devil would speak to you or how he goes about it but it had to hurt when judgment was proclaimed over israel and you realize i'm not going in the promised land i'm dying in this wilderness oh god help me i wanted to see the land but you see what it is is satan muddied it all up all we could see was the here and the now just a little spark of inspiration and they could have raised a voice and said amen joshua i don't know how i have no clue and i don't feel like i could do it but joshua i believe you they'd be in scripture today walking in the land but i'm telling you satan so got them to where ah i've got mortgage and i've got a car payment and i've got this and i've got that and i've got to do this and i've got to do that i don't have time to be a priest in my home and then come to that place and stand there and realize judgment's just been spoke over me i'm dying in this wilderness imagine his firstborn son saying oh god i saw the supernatural when that death angel passed by our house you chose me lord you chose me to go into the land you chose me lord this is not an accident but their hearts must have ached to watch a once strong father a one strong mother walking in the wilderness getting weaker and more frail and bent over until one day maybe daddy who had been so strong says i'm tired i'm just gonna lay down for a while to never rise again find me scripture that says the children decided to lay down and die with dad in the wilderness no because revelation had struck their heart and what had happened in the past everything that happened in their life brought them to the place to say this promise is real this is true i'll stand on this i'll follow god didn't put them children saints he didn't put them children there to see the supernatural so that they could be filled with fear [Music] you know i almost included it this morning but i knew i'd be long like i am now i'm meant to be out by now brother branham says but one of the things that i see amongst christians is fear [Music] wonder if anything's changed 50 60 70 years [Music] oh hallelujah but your chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous life my brother and sister there it is right there the foundation's been laid for the mercy seat prophet of god said it'll only be god's grace and mercy that we would make the rapture and stand before the throne only his mercy sings we'll go on into this i pray the lord helps me to be more concise than i was even today we go on and to look at this and and you can look at the quotes you can look these things up brother branham doesn't speak it a whole bunch but to me i believe the foundation's there to make it an overwhelming proclamation the prophet of god says the mercy seat i'm phrasing this the mercy seat in our day is in the heart of the believer the world's worried about oh if god comes off his throne and would be in our presence then that means he's left the mercy seat no i'm sorry he's always been here and he always will be he may leave the mercy seat for others but he's not going to ever leave the mercy seat for you he's always there as the scripture says making intercessions for you and i isn't that beautiful doesn't it stir your heart hallelujah i'm going to apologize for keeping you so long but i'm not apologetic did that come out right or did i say that backwards well you know what i mean saints it's time for us to stand up claim what is rightfully ours don't just talk about well i believe i'm already healed step into that confession of your healing you say well i got something in my life brother paul i reckon we could all say that something that bothers us i guess it'll just be there till the rapture it will be if you say it is but if you happen to stand up with a little revelation and say you know what i'm called to be more than a conqueror i'd like to sing that song more than a conqueror amen if you decide you're more than a conqueror you can stand up and say i'm done with that i'm finished this is over this is over because that's what word said hallelujah let's just stand up and sing a song or two before we dismiss amen i've been made more than a conqueror [Music] overcomer in this life i'll just claim that today saints confess it put it up before the lord to thee let that be your words that you would speak [Music] victoria [Music] when trouble comes knocking at [Music] knocking at your door don't be afraid before [Music] don't you get it don't let it bring you down you don't have to worry anymore been hallelujah victorious through the blood of jesus [Music] so hold on we're getting stronger every day there's no reason for you to go astray don't be leaning on your understanding trust in him we'll all say we've been made [Music] let's make it personal i've been making more [Applause] victorious god of jesus christ can we give a little praise to the lord this morning hallelujah let the revelation lord that we are conquerors hallelujah the one who's never been defeated he put his very life he put his very dna in hallelujah then how can i be defeated oh hallelujah my redeemer is faithful and true hallelujah hallelujah i read everything you have said he will do every morning his mercies are [Music] as i look back on this road i travel i see so many times if there's one thing i've learned in this life is somebody say amen hallelujah amen everything he said he will do every morning his mercies are [Music] my redeemer is faithful and true oh look at this here it is my heart rejoices when i read the promise that's why we read our bible [Music] [Music] [Music] everything he has said he will do every morning his mercies are blue hallelujah he can do that because he knows your name hallelujah aren't you glad i hope you have the revelation i hope it's just not message talk to us when we talk about him knowing our name i hope it's so real to you that when you get to him oh sorry i've always had a vivid imagination since i was just the tiniest of going to come before the throne of almighty god and i'm going to say lord it's me and he says yes paul i don't have to tell him who i am and i don't have to tell him my story he's going to say i'm the one i painted i recorded it and i spoke of the outcome [Music] while you were nothing but a thought [Music] hallelujah [Music] and before even time [Music] he knows [Music] that falls and hears me when i call i have a father he calls me his own and you'll no never where i go he knows my day hallelujah is [Music] each tear that falls and hears hallelujah hallelujah can someone say thank you lord o o glory be to the name of our lord and savior jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can we sing one more song saints hallelujah i'm so happy to be a part of joel's army amen that word come when i read joel 2 28 i'm looking for that day my brother and sister but some say well well will it come will it come in the church well i'll tell you what if we take the prophet's words for it it might already be here and we just didn't recognize it god already moving he's already giving discerning power uh prophecy he's already giving overcoming power he's gave it all to us my brother and sister but we were looking for it in a certain way and god come right in our midst and he performed exactly according to the word that's what the prophet of god says he come and performed according to the word and they never recognized him oh don't close your eyes up
