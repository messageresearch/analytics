[30:20] um after all my brothers and sisters
[30:24] every thing that god ever called us for
[30:26] he could have accomplished without us if
[30:29] he had chosen to
[30:31] but he said i want to make you part of
[30:33] this great plan of redemption
[30:36] imagine a god who doesn't just want to
[30:38] save people but he wants to bring you
[30:40] and i to a place one day
[30:42] that he gives us our own crown
[30:46] as a reflection of us crowning him the
[30:49] lord of lord and king of kings and he
[30:51] says i want you to receive this portion
[30:55] of the glory that i am because you are
[30:58] me
[31:00] you are the expression
[31:03] of what i wanted to express and
[31:05] therefore
[31:07] if i am glorified and you are in me and
[31:09] i am in you then you must be glorified
[31:11] saints
[31:12] amen
[31:13] hallelujah sometimes we have to just
[31:16] stop and ponder what it is that god's
[31:18] really really desiring to express in us
[31:21] amen
[31:22] um
[31:24] my there was something i was going to
[31:25] speak
[31:27] this is getting scary saints pray for
[31:29] brother paul
[31:30] you know uh yeah
[31:33] yeah
[31:34] literally yesterday i laid something
[31:36] down in my way so i wouldn't forget it
[31:38] and then i just stepped over it as i
[31:39] went out the door
[31:41] and uh
[31:42] so anyway we'll remember amen i want to
[31:45] speak to you this evening
[31:47] about we are witnesses once again
[31:50] amen this is what we are called for my
[31:52] brothers and sisters thank you god bless
[31:54] you
[31:55] um this is what we're called for
[31:57] and uh um you know a little bit of
[32:00] something that i kind of included but i
[32:03] didn't i've cut it away we'll use it but
[32:06] my brother and sister i just want to lay
[32:08] a little foundation before we go into
[32:10] our thought tonight
[32:11] remember
[32:13] now that
[32:15] if we don't worship if we don't praise
[32:17] god the scripture says the rocks in the
[32:19] mountains will cry out
[32:21] amen as long as i have a voice i believe
[32:25] as long as you have a voice those rocks
[32:28] will never cry out because we will be
[32:30] lifting our voice in praise to the king
[32:33] of kings to to worship him to give
[32:36] praise to him amen to glorify him and
[32:40] you know i just want to uh i just want
[32:43] to encourage each and every one of you
[32:45] uh that whatever comes your way whatever
[32:48] days bring
[32:49] amen let's just take time to lift our
[32:51] voice in praise amen let's stand as we
[32:54] go i want to speak this evening
[32:57] on what my house
[32:59] says about me
[33:01] amen so we will look at this and in the
[33:04] natural you could see that uh you'll
[33:06] find that people are attracted to a
[33:08] certain style of house
[33:11] and um
[33:12] in the natural they would look at that
[33:13] and say oh i
[33:15] i like this i like you know this kind of
[33:18] a rancher i like this a tudor
[33:21] there's not very many of those people
[33:23] around but anyway um you know it's just
[33:26] i i this what i like but we want to look
[33:28] tonight in the word of god
[33:30] and see what our house
[33:32] says about us
[33:34] and so as we'll look here we will we
[33:36] will see from the scripture we turn in
[33:38] matthew the 16th chapter
[33:41] and
[33:44] is this not working or is it just not
[33:46] turned on
[33:48] it's not working
[33:49] we have a major crisis amen god bless
[33:53] you brother alex good to have you home i
[33:55] hope you had a wonderful trip
[33:57] amen
[33:58] matthew 16 starting with the 13th verse
[34:02] uh we just want to uh then take so is
[34:06] this not working either okay
[34:08] it's just the operators not working
[34:11] matthew 16 13
[34:13] amen
[34:15] when jesus came into the coast of
[34:17] caesarea philippi he asked his disciples
[34:20] saying
[34:21] whom do men say that i the son of man am
[34:25] so here he is clearly declaring in these
[34:28] words who he is but he's asking the
[34:31] question
[34:32] who do men say
[34:35] now speaking to men saints he's speaking
[34:37] to you and i
[34:38] it's not a matter of what the world says
[34:41] but it does matter what we say
[34:44] it matters what our expression is and
[34:48] whom do men say that i the son of man am
[34:51] and they said some say that thou art
[34:53] john the baptist
[34:55] some elias others jeremiah
[34:58] or one of the prophets and he saith unto
[35:01] them but whom say ye
[35:04] that i am
[35:06] and simon peter answered and said thou
[35:08] art the christ the son of the living god
[35:12] now my brother and sister he was very
[35:15] very direct in that there there's just
[35:17] nothing to beat around there
[35:19] uh he he had revelation god had given
[35:22] that to him and he speaks it out thou
[35:25] art the christ the son of the living god
[35:28] jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[35:31] art thou simon barjona for flesh and
[35:33] blood hath not revealed it unto thee
[35:37] but my father which is in heaven and i
[35:39] say also unto thee that thou art peter
[35:42] and upon this rock i will build my
[35:44] church and the gates of hell
[35:46] shall not prevail against it
[35:50] and i will give unto thee the keys of
[35:52] the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever
[35:55] thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
[35:58] in heaven whatsoever thou shalt loose on
[36:01] earth shall be loosed in heaven
[36:04] heavenly father we ask this evening that
[36:06] you would just bless your word let it
[36:08] come lord into the bedding ground of our
[36:10] heart and soul father just speak to us
[36:13] we ask in your precious name amen you
[36:16] may be seated saints
[36:21] brother david
[36:22] nash i would just like to say i really
[36:24] really enjoyed
[36:26] um
[36:28] your your thought that you spoke to us
[36:30] this last week i would have to say it's
[36:32] fit with everything brother david and
[36:34] brother chris has spoken i just felt
[36:36] like it was a beautiful extension of
[36:39] that and so as we'll look at that and
[36:41] realize my brother and sister the key
[36:43] components of the scripture are not
[36:46] there just to fill up the pages but they
[36:48] are there to express to us the whole
[36:51] plan of
[36:52] god being brought out
[36:54] now we understand that it is never the
[36:56] man
[36:57] uh and sometimes we focus too much on
[36:59] the man but it's never the man it's the
[37:01] measure of christ in the man and so as
[37:04] we'll look down through the ages uh that
[37:08] uh you know what one prophet said cannot
[37:10] be contradicted by another prophet's
[37:13] message as sister jerry shared that
[37:15] quote with me today going along with a
[37:17] little thought that we have been uh
[37:19] discussing personally between us and you
[37:21] look at this and realize my brother and
[37:23] sister as the scripture says from age to
[37:26] age he's still the same
[37:28] by the power of his name actually the
[37:30] song i guess is really what that most
[37:32] often is expressed as and you look at
[37:34] this from age to age we have the
[37:36] foundation that was laid and it's
[37:38] carried through and this foundation has
[37:40] been more than sufficient we've never
[37:42] had to knock the walls out never had to
[37:44] fix the cracks never had to
[37:47] fix the sinkholes or the places where
[37:49] the foundation was not sufficient but uh
[37:52] there we see that the word has laid a
[37:55] beautiful foundation and uh so it's a
[37:58] measure of christ that is in you and i
[38:00] that is what is important sometimes
[38:02] we'll focus upon ourself and we might
[38:05] have issues in life you know or things
[38:08] that we struggle to deal with feel
[38:10] overwhelmed but my brother and sister
[38:12] god didn't call us to focus on ourself
[38:14] but he called for us to
[38:17] focus on him and when we look at the
[38:19] measure of christ in us then we can
[38:22] realize that the the ability that we
[38:25] have has uh come short a long time ago
[38:28] it simply was not something that comes
[38:31] short as the pressure of the age has
[38:33] come upon us but it is simply uh been
[38:36] insufficient for the whole time
[38:39] so it's there that we often look and
[38:42] look through the word of god and uh
[38:44] people talk about revelation
[38:46] and uh you know every once in a while
[38:48] maybe you do too but i'll get these uh
[38:50] giant postcards in the mail about how
[38:54] they're down here at a certain
[38:55] auditorium teaching a revelation series
[38:59] uh they're teaching you how to recognize
[39:02] revelation how to receive revelation and
[39:07] so i find it interesting that typically
[39:09] in two or three services they're going
[39:11] to give you revelation but my brother
[39:14] and sister we know that revelation comes
[39:16] from god and god alone amen the prophet
[39:19] speaks of it in various fashions
[39:21] bringing that around but you see no
[39:23] matter how much we would educate or
[39:25] teach someone if god does not turn on
[39:28] the light amen then we won't have
[39:30] revelation we have education and so it's
[39:34] there that as revelation would come to
[39:36] sons of god as we'll look at uh simon
[39:39] bar jonas we'll see him here you know uh
[39:42] peter looking at this there was a
[39:44] revelation that had come in his heart
[39:46] and and we don't really see much in the
[39:49] scripture uh
[39:50] preceding this of peter really
[39:53] expressing this i believe this was an
[39:55] anointing that come on him at that
[39:57] season right god's always on time and
[40:00] come on him at that season and in that
[40:03] moment right there the revelation struck
[40:05] him now i don't know if you have ever uh
[40:08] uh
[40:09] you know
[40:10] have this happen to you i know as
[40:12] ministers it happens a lot that you'll
[40:16] actually be preaching your own ears will
[40:18] actually hear the anointed word being
[40:22] spoke and it becomes revelation to you
[40:24] in other words it wasn't preceding and
[40:26] you come and shared revelation but you
[40:28] spoke the words and it come alive to the
[40:31] minister right at that moment also so
[40:34] this is the moving of the holy spirit
[40:36] right in our midst and and it is not a
[40:39] old message my brother and sister but
[40:42] the deeper we dig into it the fresher it
[40:45] is and so it's there as we'll look at
[40:47] this uh in verse 17 and jesus spoken to
[40:51] him blessed art thou simon barjona for
[40:53] flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[40:56] unto thee but my father which is in
[40:58] heaven now as we live in a day that
[41:01] increasingly my brother and sister
[41:03] holiness is disappearing even in the uh
[41:06] you might say denominations that claim
[41:09] holiness if the standard is is declining
[41:12] it's going away but i stand here today
[41:15] under this word and i say anointed word
[41:19] that we have a revelation my brother and
[41:20] sister it was not an age gone by that is
[41:23] holiness but it is the fire from the
[41:26] altar of god cleansing us daily that
[41:28] makes us a people of holiness it is not
[41:31] of a doctrine we adhered to or a
[41:34] teaching under an individual but it is
[41:36] that fresh fire that is cleansing and
[41:39] preparing that brings holiness and holds
[41:41] it as a standard before us
[41:44] amen so it's there that many times
[41:46] people say well we need a greater
[41:48] teaching of holiness in message churches
[41:52] my brother and sister i tell you what we
[41:54] need is not a greater teaching of
[41:56] holiness we need more of the presence of
[41:58] the holy ghost in our midst because when
[42:01] the presence of the holy ghost is here
[42:04] we will be a holiness people
[42:06] amen it will not be something we'll have
[42:09] to teach to them because the very nature
[42:12] of the age that we live in is of spirit
[42:14] of rules were meant to be broken and so
[42:17] therefore as you put it out if the rules
[42:19] had worked there would be no new
[42:20] testament
[42:23] but the rules didn't work
[42:26] so we understand that
[42:31] it's not revelation brought by man
[42:34] and so some people get all nervous when
[42:36] we speak this way some people say you're
[42:38] leaving the prophet behind or
[42:40] different fashions you're doing this but
[42:42] my brother and sister you see there is
[42:44] very ample evidence all through
[42:46] scripture and all through the message by
[42:49] the prophet's words that you see it was
[42:51] never about the prophet
[42:54] it has been a spirit of the age that has
[42:56] made it about the prophet
[42:58] now
[42:59] having said it that way people say whoa
[43:01] whoa paul's no no my brother and sister
[43:04] we give honor
[43:06] where honor is due
[43:08] but the scripture clearly shows us and
[43:10] the prophet's own word says that this is
[43:14] not a man's revelation this is god
[43:17] speaking through the man and so as we
[43:20] stand upon that we realize now that a
[43:24] revelation is not brought by the man
[43:26] it's brought by the moving of the holy
[43:28] spirit and god then brings the word and
[43:31] lays it before the people by man
[43:35] to anoint it with the holy spirit that
[43:36] revelation might stir you and i to to
[43:40] rise up and move forward and claim our
[43:42] rightful position
[43:43] now i'm gonna take tonight and make a
[43:45] little parallel if i could uh tonight if
[43:48] you could follow me i'll try to to do
[43:50] this in such a way if the lord will help
[43:52] me to bring a little parallel that when
[43:55] we have a revelation my brother and
[43:57] sister that is a real revelation not a
[43:59] teaching not an education but a real
[44:02] revelation we're able to see this move
[44:05] out in all aspects of our life it is not
[44:09] then a revelation of jesus christ that
[44:12] affects us in our spiritual walk but the
[44:14] revelation of jesus christ spills out
[44:17] and that's who we are it is we are not
[44:20] one man in church another one somewhere
[44:22] else you know age old uh
[44:24] two soul doctrine that started years ago
[44:27] there were men in positions of authority
[44:30] that that simply could not live the word
[44:32] of god and and they had you know you
[44:35] might say a different nature that kept
[44:37] being expressed and they said well you
[44:39] know i i'm filled with the holy ghost
[44:41] remember the prophet of god said don't
[44:42] you claim you have the holy ghost claim
[44:44] or speak out the holy ghost has you amen
[44:47] because it's easy for anyone to say i
[44:49] have the holy ghost but when they come
[44:51] look what man did they said okay now
[44:53] none of us are able to live this
[44:56] so what we're going to do is we're going
[44:58] to take the word here and we're going to
[45:00] divvy it up and we're going to have two
[45:02] natures now and the the spiritual nature
[45:05] of me goes to church reads my bible
[45:07] prays and the carnal nature or man
[45:10] nature of me is then the one that can be
[45:12] very devious in business and
[45:15] crafty and all these other things
[45:17] and we've got it solved we've got
[45:19] problem solved amen who likes to solve a
[45:21] problem
[45:23] problem solved
[45:24] but you see by that very nature amen
[45:28] they had to defy as it were the word at
[45:32] some point there's no way you can find
[45:34] continuity in the word at this point so
[45:37] what i'm trying to lay out here is the
[45:39] fact that god always brings continuity
[45:43] through his word no matter what stage we
[45:45] are
[45:46] amen now in first peter the second
[45:48] chapter uh verse 1 through 10 and i i'll
[45:53] go ahead and read all this quickly i
[45:55] really intended to just draw certain
[45:57] scriptures but this will be good
[45:58] wherefore laying aside all malice
[46:01] and all guile and
[46:03] hypocrisies and envies and all evil
[46:05] speakings as newborn babes desire the
[46:07] sincere milk of the word that you may
[46:10] grow thereby now i want to take this
[46:13] down into the realm of a newborn babe
[46:16] you never saw a newborn babe say
[46:19] mom
[46:20] mom what i really want
[46:23] is this
[46:25] there is something down inside of them
[46:28] that they know
[46:30] that nourishment must be there's an
[46:32] instinct that says the nourishment that
[46:34] i need is already been given to me and
[46:38] so it is there an instinct that comes
[46:41] and they know that they can receive that
[46:42] at a mother's breast so it's there that
[46:45] we see as newborn babes in the gospel we
[46:49] have spirits in the day today and and
[46:52] you know if people don't like the flavor
[46:54] over here they know we can just go down
[46:57] the street or we can go across the
[46:59] country we can go around the globe we
[47:02] can we can tie into this and i'm not
[47:04] saying that it's wrong to listen to this
[47:06] stuff but i'm talking about in the
[47:08] fundamental as newborn babes that people
[47:11] are searching not for what they need but
[47:13] what fits them or what flavor they like
[47:16] and what they're comfortable with you
[47:18] know we don't need sometimes we don't
[47:20] need a comfort factor
[47:23] what we need is to become so
[47:25] uncomfortable that our life changes but
[47:27] look at the spirit of the age that we
[47:29] have it is so much into comfort
[47:32] everything from how they advertise what
[47:34] you drive what you wear where you live
[47:37] what you eat
[47:38] all of this is about the comfort of
[47:40] humanity so much to the point we carried
[47:42] it to church and said i want to be
[47:44] comfortable in church
[47:46] not being uncomfortable spurgeon said if
[47:48] you're not shaking the people up this is
[47:51] a paraphrase you're not preaching
[47:54] well i'll tell you what spurgeon isn't
[47:56] it good he's in a different age he's
[47:58] gone because he wouldn't be very well
[47:59] accepted in the day that we're living so
[48:01] as we look at this we see now as newborn
[48:04] babes we desire the sincere milk of the
[48:06] word that we may grow thereby if so be
[48:10] have tasted that the lord is gracious
[48:12] can someone say amen
[48:14] to whom coming as unto a living stone
[48:17] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[48:20] god and precious
[48:22] ye also see how the word now is drawing
[48:25] us and tying us right here together with
[48:28] christ with the word we're being tied
[48:31] directly to that ye also as lively
[48:35] stones
[48:36] amen so we have a living stone here that
[48:40] was disallowed but the life is in that
[48:42] stone so now we being in christ come as
[48:46] lively stones are built up a spiritual
[48:49] house
[48:52] i wonder
[48:53] what our house
[48:55] says about us
[48:58] you see my brother and sister we can be
[49:00] 50 60 70 years old and be immature
[49:03] christians
[49:04] and we can be 15 years old and have
[49:07] maturity that people will not respect or
[49:10] look to because they're saying there's
[49:12] no way this young man or young woman can
[49:14] have that kind of relationship but you
[49:16] see the house
[49:18] will tell us
[49:20] the relationship
[49:22] are built of a spiritual house and holy
[49:25] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[49:26] sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus
[49:29] christ wherefore also it is contained in
[49:31] the scripture and behold allah and zion
[49:34] achieve cornerstone elect and precious
[49:36] and he that believeth on him shall not
[49:38] be confounded now we'll look in the
[49:41] world we're living in today my brother
[49:43] and sister and there's a lot of things
[49:45] that are confounding
[49:47] we look at the chaos that is coming
[49:50] and um how that
[49:53] by man's reasoning
[49:56] you know i heard a comment said about uh
[49:59] uh our current president
[50:01] and uh they used i would guess you would
[50:04] say derogatory terms not profane or
[50:06] anything but derogatory
[50:09] and something just struck me and i
[50:10] thought you know what uh as we look at
[50:14] that we we don't we're actually
[50:16] confounded right as just humans we're
[50:19] confounded by what is being done
[50:22] but when we'll step out of that into a
[50:24] spiritual realm and look at this and
[50:26] what the prophet of god showed us
[50:28] through the word we should not be
[50:31] confounded we should be able to look
[50:33] with clarity and realize here is the end
[50:36] that is prophesied and the word is
[50:39] bringing this to pass but just not in
[50:42] the fashion we thought
[50:46] so
[50:47] people are like well um
[50:50] is the scripture fulfilled already you
[50:52] know because there's many restaurants
[50:54] and places you can't go if you don't
[50:56] have a vaccine card so would that be not
[50:59] buy and sell
[51:00] my brother and sister the prophet of god
[51:02] showed us very clearly it's going to be
[51:05] absolute chaos
[51:07] it's not going to be inconvenience
[51:10] this gospel
[51:12] is not just a gospel of inconvenience my
[51:14] brother and sister this gospel said i've
[51:17] come to tear apart to separate to bring
[51:20] this so it has to come to pass so the
[51:23] house that is being built people are
[51:25] saying well uh what will we do uh will
[51:28] will god let us be hungry
[51:31] he let other saints through the ages be
[51:33] hungry
[51:34] could we be homeless he's had saints
[51:36] through the ages be homeless
[51:38] would we have to maybe as it were hide
[51:41] through the ages there's been saints
[51:43] that had to hide from the powers that be
[51:46] so my brother and sister when it comes
[51:48] down to it whether we react one way or
[51:51] another is going to be based upon the
[51:54] foundation that we are building our
[51:56] house now when i say build a house my
[51:58] brother and sister i'm talking in this
[52:01] you might say back and forth between the
[52:03] natural and the spiritual to see that
[52:06] but how we perform if you would use that
[52:08] word in the future is going to be based
[52:12] upon the foundation that we have built
[52:14] our spiritual house on so if our
[52:16] spiritual house is built on a
[52:18] superficial revelation of what this
[52:20] message of the hour is then we will be
[52:23] looking at that and always looking as it
[52:26] would for god to come and make it simple
[52:28] or easy for us but god never promised
[52:30] that it would be easy or simple but he
[52:32] did promise you would make it through
[52:34] amen now in god's only provided place of
[52:38] worship brother branham preached this on
[52:40] 11 28 in the morning 1965
[52:43] coming right down to the very end of his
[52:45] ministry now i am not a person that is
[52:48] oriented to location or dates
[52:51] amen some people are like well it's
[52:53] extra special if it was preached in the
[52:55] tabernacle uh brother branham brought a
[52:57] lot of you might call the controversial
[52:59] sermons that he didn't feel like would
[53:01] be accepted out in the world he preached
[53:02] them in the tabernacle but my brother
[53:04] and sister he preached sermons
[53:07] all over our nation all over our world
[53:09] and each one of those was god speaking
[53:12] so they have a virtue or a value to us
[53:16] as believers so i just pray that you
[53:18] don't get caught in the trap of well if
[53:20] it was before 63 or after 63 if it was
[53:23] preached here or it was preached there
[53:25] it is the word of god for our hour amen
[53:28] so right here at the end and i said all
[53:30] that to say now right here at the end
[53:34] 11 and 28
[53:36] getting very close
[53:39] jesus said i come in my father's name
[53:42] and you receive me not
[53:44] you want this scripture on that saint
[53:46] john 5 43 see i come in my father's name
[53:49] and you receive me not then the father
[53:51] put his own name which is jesus in the
[53:54] son
[53:55] and he's the way he's the door he's the
[53:57] house
[54:01] so we're building a house i hope you're
[54:02] all with me tonight okay
[54:05] we're building a house
[54:08] and he's the house
[54:11] but he chose to use this vessel your
[54:13] vessel amen but he's the house
[54:22] he's where god chose to put his name god
[54:24] never put his name in me he never put it
[54:27] in the church he never put it in the
[54:29] methodist baptist catholic but he put it
[54:31] in christ the anointed emmanuel
[54:34] and the name is in the word because he
[54:37] is the word
[54:39] and now we can well i'll just carry on
[54:41] amen
[54:42] what is he then
[54:44] the word interpreted is the
[54:46] manifestation
[54:48] of the name of god
[54:50] so anyone can then say well you know i
[54:52] believe in jesus christ where's the
[54:54] manifestation
[54:56] there has to be a life that goes with
[54:58] the belief or otherwise we have could as
[55:01] one minister said once brother branham
[55:04] has referred to it himself saying i know
[55:06] a lot of jesus
[55:09] so if we're not in the anointed word
[55:11] we're not looking at him as the anointed
[55:14] we can just switch that over and say
[55:15] jesus
[55:18] i work with one
[55:21] but you look at this see
[55:22] the word interpreted is a manifestation
[55:26] of the name of god no wonder flesh and
[55:28] blood has not revealed this to you but
[55:31] my father which is in heaven hath
[55:33] revealed this to you who i am
[55:37] so this is not a matter of my brother
[55:38] and sister of us identifying
[55:42] that that
[55:43] jesus christ so yes here he is god in
[55:46] the flesh john 1 coming down and he
[55:50] mixed with us and dwelt with us and
[55:52] lived with us and and he suffered every
[55:54] kind of inconvenience and trouble and
[55:56] strife and temptation that we have and
[55:59] he overcome them that's good but we've
[56:01] got to come down and actually recognize
[56:05] who jesus christ is and the hour that
[56:08] we're living oh we've preached this to
[56:10] redundancy you might say but the hour if
[56:13] he is the house then where is his house
[56:16] tonight
[56:18] his house or dwelling place is in his
[56:21] bride tonight
[56:23] amen so he chose to be identified in her
[56:27] and through her that she would then
[56:30] become the manifestation of who he is
[56:34] amen so as we are building we are we are
[56:37] uh creating now we look at this my
[56:41] brother and sister uh uh in such a
[56:44] fashion if i could say
[56:46] remember now these lively stones
[56:49] are building up a spiritual house
[56:52] now remember it's been it seems like
[56:54] forever a month ago it almost feels like
[56:56] but we were preaching about joshua
[56:59] coming of who's going to serve the lord
[57:00] who's going to stand faithful and taking
[57:02] that stone and standing it up as a
[57:05] memorial and that being now the reminder
[57:09] now my brother and sister we know human
[57:10] nature some people they looked at that
[57:13] stone and it was there that they could
[57:15] just have a jubilee right on the spot
[57:17] praise god we are here i'm a testimony
[57:21] in my own life that we are going to
[57:23] serve god others it was a reminder that
[57:26] stirred them oh
[57:28] the world's getting a hold of me
[57:30] lord forgive me
[57:32] i want to come close i want to serve you
[57:33] i'm going to stand with this memorial
[57:36] others
[57:37] chose an entirely different path
[57:41] to come and go and live their life
[57:43] so they didn't have to look
[57:45] at that stone
[57:49] now i want to draw this and tie this a
[57:52] little bit together for you tonight
[57:55] you see
[57:56] the prophet of god talking about that
[57:58] rock and the wilderness
[58:00] he said you know they depicted as a
[58:02] little boy almost with a straw out of a
[58:04] rock
[58:05] getting a little bit of water
[58:07] but he said that rock right there while
[58:09] the rock itself did not look big
[58:12] was sufficient
[58:13] to provide for two million people and
[58:16] all of their animals
[58:18] so people are looking we need to build
[58:20] something great we need to build
[58:22] something big we need to have something
[58:24] we can boast about this is my church
[58:26] this is where i go this is what i
[58:28] support but the problem my brother and
[58:30] sister has just because it's big doesn't
[58:33] mean it will provide what you need and
[58:36] so it's there in the rock of the word
[58:38] that it's being poured out and sometimes
[58:41] in the small things right what man
[58:43] thinks is great god thinks is small and
[58:46] so it's in the small things sometimes
[58:48] you think about this we're building this
[58:50] spiritual house and so what do we do
[58:53] we labor for great things
[58:56] no the prophet of god told us
[58:58] do the simple things
[59:02] make sure that what you're doing you're
[59:04] taking care of the simple things in the
[59:07] building of this house
[59:09] so as we see
[59:11] it's there
[59:13] upon this rock i'll build my place of
[59:15] worship
[59:16] and the gates of hell can't shake it
[59:18] down
[59:19] now did you catch that first line my
[59:21] brother and sister what's being done
[59:23] he's building a spiritual house here but
[59:26] the prophet of god is speaking here in
[59:28] this context i'm building a place of
[59:31] worship that's not grace tabernacle
[59:34] we've been laboring different brothers
[59:36] and and whatnot have put their efforts
[59:37] in in the basement and and we're getting
[59:39] very close to fruition it's starting to
[59:41] look very nice my brother and sister
[59:43] this is not the place of worship we're
[59:45] building
[59:46] this is just a a building here on earth
[59:50] that god give us to join together but
[59:52] the place that we're building to worship
[59:54] is that spiritual house that has been
[59:57] built with lively stones that were taken
[1:00:00] from christ himself
[1:00:02] amen so you look at that
[1:00:07] i'll build my place of worship and the
[1:00:08] gates of hell can't shake it down
[1:00:10] that'll make us happy right there
[1:00:12] whatever satan does and tries to shake
[1:00:14] can't shake you down
[1:00:16] amen
[1:00:17] amen oh living
[1:00:19] church of god stand in firm foundation
[1:00:22] on jesus christ alone you can sing this
[1:00:25] song but if you're not on christ the
[1:00:27] word you're teetering faltering sand but
[1:00:30] upon this rock christ my word
[1:00:34] see there's where we're drawing our
[1:00:35] building stone is coming out of the word
[1:00:37] of god this is a foundation where the
[1:00:39] prophet of god said read your bible
[1:00:42] every single day because i guarantee you
[1:00:45] you read your bible every day in the
[1:00:47] right attitude the right spirit and you
[1:00:50] will draw another stone to build your
[1:00:52] house with amen now this is not i saw a
[1:00:55] cute little cartoon the other day
[1:00:58] amen it was uh it was what what are
[1:01:00] those little guys three little pigs and
[1:01:02] the wolf huff and puff and blew the one
[1:01:04] house down and and the whole deal and
[1:01:06] and uh and i thought how it's easy for
[1:01:10] the world to make a little sacrilege of
[1:01:12] this uh things and uh they said you know
[1:01:15] the the modern day wolf and
[1:01:18] he's there he's got goggles on work
[1:01:20] gloves hard hat
[1:01:22] and um
[1:01:23] a jackhammer
[1:01:26] because you see they
[1:01:28] want satan wants you to believe your
[1:01:30] house can be tore down
[1:01:32] he wants to place this idea in our young
[1:01:34] people and our families
[1:01:37] that your house can be tore down
[1:01:39] satan's got the tools
[1:01:41] wiley old fox whatever his name was in
[1:01:43] that deal
[1:01:45] he's got the tool
[1:01:46] to tear your house down but that's not
[1:01:48] what the word says saints we're building
[1:01:50] a house that cannot be destroyed
[1:01:54] oh i would encourage someone to say
[1:01:56] thank you lord amen this house cannot be
[1:02:00] torn down
[1:02:01] no matter what satan might do and how
[1:02:03] wily he is because you see this was a
[1:02:06] revelation as jesus is speaking to peter
[1:02:09] this didn't come from man this wasn't
[1:02:11] taught to you this was a revelation and
[1:02:14] my brother and sister a real revelation
[1:02:16] from god cannot be tore down now look if
[1:02:19] a prophet through the ages and declare
[1:02:22] the word way way way back and it comes
[1:02:24] down through the age and every prophet
[1:02:26] following that can only buttress or
[1:02:29] build up what was spoken in the
[1:02:31] beginning imagine now as it were now
[1:02:34] pardon me for using this reference but
[1:02:36] if it's been buttressed through the ages
[1:02:39] the word reinforcing the word the word
[1:02:42] reinforcing the word the word
[1:02:43] reinforcing the word and the saints of
[1:02:46] the ages testifying this is true
[1:02:50] look at the defense that we've got in
[1:02:51] this seventh age here in this laodicean
[1:02:54] time this word has been proven to be
[1:02:57] faultless without failure there's never
[1:03:00] been a time never been a season never
[1:03:03] been a ability for satan to tear the
[1:03:05] word down
[1:03:06] amen when he crucified jesus christ they
[1:03:09] thought oh boy we've got it now but my
[1:03:12] brother and sister i like some different
[1:03:14] brothers brother donnie reagan one time
[1:03:16] demonstrated it really well i always
[1:03:18] really appreciated how he did that and
[1:03:20] he said you know jesus christ didn't
[1:03:22] come down to hell like some people did
[1:03:24] think he did and start yelling i'm here
[1:03:31] but i'll tell you what he did
[1:03:33] he walked with authority
[1:03:35] he didn't have to say oh devil please
[1:03:37] get out of my way and oh devil will you
[1:03:39] please give me the keys to the kingdom
[1:03:40] he walked with authority and he walked
[1:03:43] right in there and they split before him
[1:03:46] because they knew who he was and he took
[1:03:49] keys to death hell in the grave and he
[1:03:51] walked out of there my brother and
[1:03:53] sister not with a please or a pretty
[1:03:55] please but he had authority and that is
[1:03:58] the same if you can tie this together
[1:04:00] tonight that is the same authority that
[1:04:03] you have been given to take the word of
[1:04:05] god today not satan please not satan
[1:04:08] will you allow not satan will you it is
[1:04:11] that we have been given the authority to
[1:04:14] act on the word to activate the word and
[1:04:16] bring it to fruition without satan's
[1:04:19] permission
[1:04:20] without asking him if he will cooperate
[1:04:24] but to stand firm upon the word of god
[1:04:27] now people will say well well these
[1:04:29] things then we pray for someone why
[1:04:31] aren't they healed never never forget we
[1:04:34] are still living in god's will
[1:04:37] people have an idea okay if we have
[1:04:38] authority then this we prayed for this
[1:04:41] person that we love dearly maybe family
[1:04:43] or something and and why didn't
[1:04:45] something happen well remember god's
[1:04:47] will must be satisfied amen so it's not
[1:04:50] necessarily what our will is but it is
[1:04:52] the will of god amen so
[1:04:55] he's laid this cornerstone in its elect
[1:04:58] and it's precious and and so he is now
[1:05:01] building this and as we look here my
[1:05:04] brother and sister we we know that this
[1:05:06] is coming to pass because every one of
[1:05:09] these stones has its place
[1:05:12] and so as it is in god's only provided
[1:05:15] place of worship you're familiar with
[1:05:17] the sermon if not haven't listened to it
[1:05:18] for a while read it listen to it you see
[1:05:21] what god is laying through the prophet
[1:05:24] right there is actually a very gentle
[1:05:26] reminder to you and i where the place of
[1:05:29] worship really is
[1:05:31] it is not within four walls somewhere
[1:05:34] it's not under a certain ministry but it
[1:05:37] is living in the presence being one with
[1:05:40] jesus christ being one with the word is
[1:05:43] our place of worship anything outside of
[1:05:46] that we can say well i belong to this
[1:05:48] message church this man is my pastor all
[1:05:51] of these kind of things they might be
[1:05:53] well and good my brother and sister but
[1:05:55] that's not where we were called to find
[1:05:57] our security our security was to be
[1:06:00] found in the word
[1:06:02] now matthew 7 24-29
[1:06:06] and if it sounds like i'm hurrying
[1:06:09] i'm trying to
[1:06:15] therefore whosoever heareth these
[1:06:17] sayings of mine
[1:06:19] and do with them
[1:06:21] isn't it lovely how you have these
[1:06:23] little things that
[1:06:24] kind of set the stage
[1:06:31] you hear her
[1:06:33] and you do it
[1:06:35] i will liken him until wise man which
[1:06:38] built his house upon a rock
[1:06:40] and the rain descended
[1:06:43] was that the trials cares of life
[1:06:48] the rain descended
[1:06:49] did you know saints i know
[1:06:53] i don't want anybody go home sad
[1:06:57] but if it rains at my house it won't be
[1:06:59] long it'll be raining at your house
[1:07:02] or vice versa
[1:07:05] right or both at the same time
[1:07:08] or maybe the whole church
[1:07:10] woe unto us saints it's raining
[1:07:14] yeah
[1:07:15] well i have an old friend
[1:07:19] he's mean
[1:07:22] one of his favorite phrases
[1:07:24] used to be
[1:07:27] life is short and then you die get over
[1:07:29] it
[1:07:33] encouraging right
[1:07:38] but
[1:07:39] truthful
[1:07:43] so what we want to do
[1:07:45] is we want to take what we hear
[1:07:47] and we want to put it into action
[1:07:50] because i want to be a wise man
[1:07:52] he built his house upon a rock and the
[1:07:54] rain descended and the floods came and
[1:07:56] the winds blew and beat upon that house
[1:07:58] and it fell not for it was founded
[1:08:03] upon a rock
[1:08:06] now look at this saints
[1:08:08] if you just give me a few minutes to
[1:08:10] elaborate tonight okay just homegrown
[1:08:12] stuff just something i've been thinking
[1:08:13] about for quite a little while here
[1:08:16] it doesn't say that it was built next to
[1:08:18] the rock
[1:08:20] below the rock
[1:08:22] it was built upon the rock
[1:08:25] now the problem is is we can come along
[1:08:28] my brother and sister and we can build
[1:08:30] something and the rock is an
[1:08:32] inconvenience to what we are building oh
[1:08:35] come on
[1:08:36] i tell you i just know way too many
[1:08:39] people that the rock has been an
[1:08:41] inconvenience of what they really wanted
[1:08:44] to build in their life and so they keep
[1:08:46] struggling with the rock and they keep
[1:08:49] saying i can't get rid of the rock and
[1:08:50] then i no it's this wouldn't be right if
[1:08:52] i got rid of the rock i was born in the
[1:08:54] message
[1:08:58] but i struggle with the rock and so what
[1:09:01] i want to do and forgive me if i i kind
[1:09:03] of tie back to some other sermons here
[1:09:06] but my brother and sister you look at
[1:09:07] this and it's there that he built his
[1:09:10] house upon the rock so there had to be a
[1:09:13] rock of revelation in the foundation of
[1:09:17] his spiritual house he didn't try to get
[1:09:19] around it he didn't say you know if we
[1:09:21] just kind of softened up this right here
[1:09:24] if we kind of softened this up right
[1:09:26] here you know we could you know there
[1:09:28] was a season i preached on that and kind
[1:09:30] of joked about that but if we would just
[1:09:32] soften up a few things my brother and
[1:09:34] sister we'd have a whole lot more
[1:09:35] message believers in our church
[1:09:41] look i know for a fact
[1:09:46] but i'll tell you what i don't want to
[1:09:47] see
[1:09:48] i don't want to see people
[1:09:50] constantly having to pick up the carnage
[1:09:53] of their life
[1:09:55] when the storm comes and everything
[1:09:58] falls apart we don't want to have to
[1:10:00] deal with that
[1:10:01] my brother and sister do we deal with
[1:10:03] enough of it is yes we do my brother and
[1:10:05] sister sister jerry and i noticed some
[1:10:07] neighbors are getting their house roofed
[1:10:09] and and jerry kind of jokingly said well
[1:10:11] it's probably good that they did because
[1:10:13] they've re-roofed it a couple times or
[1:10:15] three times or whatever it was already
[1:10:17] because every time we'd drive by they'd
[1:10:19] be shingles blowed off their house
[1:10:21] and boy the last time you want to see
[1:10:23] that is when it's raining cats and dogs
[1:10:25] and look out and the whole corner of the
[1:10:27] roof is all blowed away and it's like
[1:10:29] yeah i think i'd spend the money and
[1:10:31] roof my house because there's a problem
[1:10:32] here and we look at this and my brother
[1:10:34] sister life has enough i hope you
[1:10:36] understand what i'm saying life has
[1:10:38] enough of things that we have to pick up
[1:10:41] things that get tore up things that have
[1:10:43] misunderstanding and struggle and
[1:10:45] headache and heartache with without us
[1:10:47] building in such a fashion that when the
[1:10:50] rain comes
[1:10:52] it's guaranteed to collapse
[1:10:55] so it's there that the when the rain
[1:10:58] descended and the floods came the winds
[1:11:00] blew sounds like every every little
[1:11:02] struggle of life right there amen it
[1:11:04] fell not for it was founded
[1:11:07] upon a rock so here we have two verses
[1:11:10] 24 and 25 consecutive right there now
[1:11:14] look at this my brother and sister 24
[1:11:16] says the house was built on the rock
[1:11:19] 25 says
[1:11:21] it was founded
[1:11:26] so it's one thing to build something
[1:11:27] without knowing why you built it or did
[1:11:31] it and another to know that the purpose
[1:11:34] that you founded yourself in this
[1:11:37] position of your spiritual house had
[1:11:40] purpose there was a reason there was an
[1:11:43] underpinning of that to to give reason
[1:11:46] for that
[1:11:47] now
[1:11:49] let's just jump over here real quick uh
[1:11:50] sorry i'm jumping back and forth second
[1:11:52] timothy 2 19.
[1:11:54] and it says nevertheless
[1:11:56] the foundation of god standeth sure
[1:11:59] having this seal
[1:12:01] the lord knoweth them that are his and
[1:12:03] let everyone that nameth the name of
[1:12:05] christ depart from iniquity now iniquity
[1:12:09] the prophet of god said is knowing to do
[1:12:12] and not doing it and so we have a very
[1:12:14] clear uh picture in the word that we
[1:12:17] should be founding our house on the rock
[1:12:22] now if you don't have a revelation of
[1:12:24] why you're founding your house on the
[1:12:25] rock you may build your house on the
[1:12:27] rock but you're not going to build it in
[1:12:29] the same form or fashion you would if
[1:12:31] you have a foundation or an
[1:12:33] understanding
[1:12:35] now i want you to think about this
[1:12:36] brother chris
[1:12:38] preached easy how's it cost i really
[1:12:40] enjoyed that brother chris amen
[1:12:42] unfortunately i keep looking around
[1:12:43] thinking i want to take the cheap way
[1:12:45] out i don't know that's going to cost me
[1:12:47] too much
[1:12:50] but look at this my brother and sister
[1:12:51] here we are we're building the house
[1:12:54] wouldn't it be much easier
[1:12:59] we have an excavator
[1:13:01] it's so easy when the ground is all soft
[1:13:04] and so we have some sand you can just
[1:13:07] take your little
[1:13:08] gps stick and stick it in the trench and
[1:13:10] you can just carve that off and it makes
[1:13:13] you even look like a professional be all
[1:13:15] flat and clean and nice and tidy and you
[1:13:17] can just dig and you can do anything you
[1:13:20] want
[1:13:23] but was our spiritual walk called to be
[1:13:25] easy
[1:13:28] now i'm going to try and keep this short
[1:13:30] tonight so i'm going to jump over
[1:13:31] several little things i have
[1:13:33] but now we moved over here because we
[1:13:35] have an understanding or we read the
[1:13:37] scripture we need to build our house on
[1:13:39] the rock
[1:13:40] but you know
[1:13:41] to really build our house like we want
[1:13:44] portions of the rock
[1:13:46] conflict
[1:13:48] with our house
[1:13:51] so what do we do
[1:13:53] we drill a few holes we put a little
[1:13:54] dynamite in there
[1:13:56] boom we blow that chunk of the rock off
[1:14:00] we take a
[1:14:01] excavator a big excavator and we bang on
[1:14:04] it till part of the rock breaks away
[1:14:08] still not sufficient
[1:14:13] you see my brother and sister
[1:14:15] we tear
[1:14:16] one page or one word out
[1:14:19] you might as well throw the book away
[1:14:23] so the rock's still in our way and
[1:14:25] somebody's telling us it would be a lot
[1:14:26] easier to build your house if that rock
[1:14:28] was not there so we drill a few more
[1:14:31] holes in that rock we put in more
[1:14:33] dynamite boom we blow it up there now
[1:14:35] the rock is fractured
[1:14:37] and we can dig through it and do what we
[1:14:39] want to do but that's not what the
[1:14:41] scripture said the scripture said we
[1:14:43] should build our house upon the rock in
[1:14:47] other words the whole foundation that we
[1:14:49] would be looking at we can say you know
[1:14:51] what my house is on this rock and i will
[1:14:55] build my house according to what the
[1:14:57] rock has dictated not what i've dictated
[1:15:00] to the rock because you see what happens
[1:15:02] my brother and sister if you've ever
[1:15:04] been around these things when you blow
[1:15:06] the rock enough to break it to remove it
[1:15:08] out of your way you have fractured it
[1:15:10] and it might be many many years of
[1:15:13] moisture and movement and all of these
[1:15:16] hot and cold that comes and now the rock
[1:15:18] has become unstable and we wonder why
[1:15:21] people have followed the message for 25
[1:15:24] 30 or 40 years and then quit because
[1:15:27] they fractured the rock and now the rock
[1:15:29] has collapsed out from underneath them
[1:15:32] it is no longer a solid foundation that
[1:15:36] they could place their whole soul to but
[1:15:38] we know people i i don't want to go to
[1:15:40] names but we know young men and their
[1:15:42] family and what has happened and they
[1:15:44] didn't stop it we're just going to go be
[1:15:47] denominational christians they went
[1:15:49] right on past that and they have become
[1:15:51] uh
[1:15:52] what what are they atheists and
[1:15:54] agnostics and whatever it is you see my
[1:15:56] brother and sister why because the
[1:15:58] foundation got broke
[1:16:00] the rock that they were called to build
[1:16:01] on is now unstable and when they saw a
[1:16:04] fault here they saw a fault here they
[1:16:06] saw a fault here and they said this is
[1:16:08] not worth building on but you see they
[1:16:10] themselves did it because they weren't
[1:16:12] happy to take and mold their life to the
[1:16:15] rock they weren't happy to make their
[1:16:17] house you want to see a beautiful place
[1:16:18] i i don't remember the name of it quite
[1:16:20] a few years ago jerry and i was up in
[1:16:22] north idaho
[1:16:24] uh was that pandare or whatever where we
[1:16:26] stayed and there's this house
[1:16:28] there's a deal goes out and juts out
[1:16:30] into the lake
[1:16:33] and it's so beautiful
[1:16:35] if i
[1:16:36] if i had to choose a vacation cabin
[1:16:39] house
[1:16:40] something to share with all of you to
[1:16:41] wow you
[1:16:43] that would that would qualify
[1:16:45] this thing's out there just a little
[1:16:47] neck of rock goes out and they have
[1:16:49] built
[1:16:50] this it's not huge but i would call it a
[1:16:53] mansion
[1:16:55] right on top of the rock
[1:16:58] surrounded by all of the water and the
[1:17:01] waves and everything
[1:17:03] they didn't go flat in the rock
[1:17:06] they built their house
[1:17:08] upon it
[1:17:10] and it's been there for a lot of years
[1:17:13] and it's worth lots of millions
[1:17:15] because people look at that and say that
[1:17:18] is so beautiful
[1:17:20] you see there's an intrinsic value my
[1:17:22] brother and sister of us not disturbing
[1:17:24] the word to build our house
[1:17:29] an intrinsic beauty
[1:17:31] and value
[1:17:33] of building our house
[1:17:35] to the word
[1:17:36] no one's going to appreciate it
[1:17:39] except for those who have the holy ghost
[1:17:42] and they will look at that and say you
[1:17:43] know look at that life
[1:17:46] look at that person right there
[1:17:48] look what god's blessing them why
[1:17:50] because they built upon that rock on
[1:17:52] that foundation of the rock
[1:17:56] amen so this spiritual house my brother
[1:17:58] and sister when the foundation is is uh
[1:18:01] correct
[1:18:05] the foundation is sure
[1:18:07] we have nothing to worry about my
[1:18:09] brother and sister
[1:18:10] don't let anyone and i i'm not preaching
[1:18:13] that direction tonight but i'm just
[1:18:15] don't let anyone try to undermine
[1:18:19] your understanding your revelation that
[1:18:20] god has given you
[1:18:22] in the word of god don't undermine that
[1:18:25] to to that part don't matter this
[1:18:27] doesn't matter that doesn't matter
[1:18:29] because we have ample and i could just
[1:18:31] bore you to tears no doubt every
[1:18:33] minister here tonight could bore you to
[1:18:34] tears of those examples that we see that
[1:18:37] once
[1:18:39] the rock was broken
[1:18:42] it was no longer
[1:18:44] in man's mind dependable
[1:18:47] it was no longer trustworthy i found a
[1:18:48] fault in the word
[1:18:50] i found a disagreeing point in the word
[1:18:54] and then they'll come another and
[1:18:56] they'll come another
[1:18:58] so once again i want to reiterate to you
[1:19:00] don't chip away at the rock to
[1:19:01] accommodate the house
[1:19:03] make the house
[1:19:05] build your house around the rock
[1:19:08] see
[1:19:10] we can reason that if the rock was
[1:19:11] different
[1:19:16] it'd be easier to build the house
[1:19:22] come on saints
[1:19:23] it's the spirit of the age we're not
[1:19:24] going to go throw stones at other
[1:19:26] message churches or nothing like that
[1:19:28] but it's the spirit of the age we want
[1:19:31] to fill our church up we make it easier
[1:19:34] for them to come and be part of this
[1:19:38] but you see to truly build your house on
[1:19:40] the rock you have to look at the rock
[1:19:41] and say what kind of house
[1:19:45] is the rock dictating
[1:19:48] people don't like the term dictator
[1:19:51] did you know by all definitions in this
[1:19:54] modern day
[1:19:56] jesus christ
[1:19:57] was a dictator
[1:20:00] think about it
[1:20:03] one he says you know what
[1:20:06] if you hear it
[1:20:07] and you do it
[1:20:09] you're wise
[1:20:11] sounds pretty direct doesn't it
[1:20:14] if you don't well
[1:20:17] easy seems easy doesn't it
[1:20:19] but easy
[1:20:21] as brother chris so aptly explained to
[1:20:23] us how's it cost
[1:20:26] now
[1:20:27] going back to matthew 7
[1:20:31] verse 26 and everyone that heareth these
[1:20:33] sayings of mine and doeth them not
[1:20:36] shall be likened into a foolish man
[1:20:40] and the rain descended and the floods
[1:20:42] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[1:20:43] that house and it fell
[1:20:45] and great was the fall of it
[1:20:48] you see my brother and sister we are in
[1:20:50] the midst right now of one of the
[1:20:52] greatest spiritual storms
[1:20:55] that has ever hit
[1:20:57] the earth today
[1:20:59] they've got everything from bill gates
[1:21:03] to
[1:21:04] warren buffett to whatever else is all
[1:21:06] the antichrist
[1:21:10] and
[1:21:11] they're there and these are people in
[1:21:13] sincerity they're they're sure that it's
[1:21:15] the money it's they're sure that it's
[1:21:17] here sure that it's what this is
[1:21:21] totally missing
[1:21:23] what the rock
[1:21:25] has already declared
[1:21:27] they built upon a church they built upon
[1:21:29] an ideology they built upon education
[1:21:32] and and they're they're missing this
[1:21:35] because they didn't build in the right
[1:21:37] place and what it's doing is making it
[1:21:38] unstable
[1:21:40] now my brother and sister i want to
[1:21:41] bring this a little bit close
[1:21:43] because
[1:21:44] some of this are people i would consider
[1:21:46] friends and my heart breaks but you see
[1:21:49] people are blown by doctrines
[1:21:52] the scripture says that a double-minded
[1:21:54] man
[1:21:55] is unstable in all of his ways and and
[1:21:58] people are are blown by doctrines and
[1:22:01] these doctrines you cannot even take
[1:22:03] them back to the word
[1:22:06] come on saints i'm going to tell you how
[1:22:07] seducing spirits can i don't want to get
[1:22:10] caught in a different conversation keep
[1:22:12] you too long tonight but you want to
[1:22:13] talk about what a seducing spirit is is
[1:22:16] when a spirit would convince you of
[1:22:19] something and the word speaks
[1:22:21] differently
[1:22:22] so all you have to do is go back to the
[1:22:24] word but the seducing spirit is so
[1:22:27] strong it will draw you away from the
[1:22:29] word because this man discerned my heart
[1:22:32] or they prophesied and it came to pass
[1:22:34] and all these seducing spirits that
[1:22:36] bring them away from the rock
[1:22:40] that's all it is saints i want you to
[1:22:42] put it in a simple context tonight these
[1:22:44] seducing spirits are trying to get you
[1:22:46] off of the rock
[1:22:48] to where you're next to the rock or
[1:22:50] maybe part of your house is on the rock
[1:22:52] and then if you ever add on you'll look
[1:22:54] at the difficulty of building on the
[1:22:56] rock and you'll go over here on the sand
[1:22:58] and you'll think but my house is
[1:22:59] anchored in the rock
[1:23:01] but it's not on the rock
[1:23:04] everything that's not on the rock is
[1:23:05] going to suffer the loss
[1:23:08] right
[1:23:09] so we look at this and see
[1:23:11] as it comes down it's going to beat on
[1:23:13] the house and it's going to fall now my
[1:23:15] brother and sister i want to just put
[1:23:16] this in context i love you very much and
[1:23:18] i believe we're all on the same page but
[1:23:20] the spirit of this day is going to
[1:23:23] continually try to seduce you to move
[1:23:27] off of the rock
[1:23:30] let's keep that in mind don't forget you
[1:23:32] say oh brother paul you say this all the
[1:23:34] time that's right we need to be reminded
[1:23:36] constantly the apostle paul you know i'm
[1:23:39] paraphrasing here but the apostle paul
[1:23:41] says just keep stirring up their pure
[1:23:43] minds just keep stirring it up that
[1:23:45] ain't saying well i stirred it up last
[1:23:47] week i shouldn't stir it up again no
[1:23:49] keep stirring it up
[1:23:51] because you see the spirits just want to
[1:23:53] move us off and we'll wake up one day
[1:23:55] and our house will be on the sand
[1:23:58] and we'll wonder why it is that
[1:24:02] well there's so many things i could say
[1:24:04] that
[1:24:06] well i just
[1:24:08] praise the lord
[1:24:13] see blown by doctrines
[1:24:16] come on saints we we've sought jerry and
[1:24:18] i sister jerry and i saw it in south
[1:24:19] america big time
[1:24:21] you'll be there one year these people
[1:24:23] are here next year they're down the road
[1:24:26] and you're like where did they go
[1:24:28] well they started hanging out with so
[1:24:30] and so and so and so is in this doctrine
[1:24:36] do you know if you guys really want to
[1:24:38] get into a couple things here i could
[1:24:39] set you up
[1:24:44] god's everywhere right
[1:24:47] he's even on the lake
[1:24:50] on sundays
[1:24:55] and we laugh about that
[1:24:57] but people fall under
[1:25:00] that spirit
[1:25:03] and they say it don't matter i can
[1:25:04] listen to the prophet
[1:25:08] and we can sit here and say oh okay okay
[1:25:10] that's just great it's not crazy
[1:25:13] it's a seducing spirit
[1:25:15] shifted them off of the rock
[1:25:18] into a man's idea and it appeals
[1:25:22] it appeals to us
[1:25:24] it appeals to them i should say i hope
[1:25:26] not us
[1:25:28] amen
[1:25:30] so it becomes unstable blown by
[1:25:33] doctrines
[1:25:34] you know what scares me
[1:25:38] more than being blown by doctrines
[1:25:42] is blown by the influence of friends
[1:25:46] the constant
[1:25:48] constant
[1:25:50] why do you believe that why do you do
[1:25:52] that
[1:25:53] why this and why that
[1:25:56] until pretty soon we decide
[1:25:58] we
[1:25:59] we're anchored enough on the rock
[1:26:03] the kitchen and the living rooms on the
[1:26:04] rock
[1:26:06] so when we added the great room and the
[1:26:08] five-car garage and all everything else
[1:26:10] in our life it's not on the rock but but
[1:26:13] we are anchored back to the rock i grew
[1:26:15] up in the message
[1:26:16] come on i just had a conversation just
[1:26:19] the other day and people putting it in
[1:26:21] that context saints
[1:26:23] well my grandparents knew the prophet
[1:26:26] that's good but what about you
[1:26:28] you can't find the rock in your backyard
[1:26:30] you can't find the rock nowhere in your
[1:26:33] life but you have this idea that because
[1:26:36] your grandparents had built upon the
[1:26:38] rock and trusted in that that it's
[1:26:40] sufficient but you see it's not
[1:26:45] see what happens is this revelation of
[1:26:47] jesus christ this rock
[1:26:49] gets chipped away
[1:26:53] continually chipped away
[1:26:56] and then
[1:26:58] the reasoning of our age
[1:27:01] will call to question the stability of
[1:27:03] the revelation
[1:27:05] now saints uh you go brother paul okay
[1:27:07] come on you always hit on that no i want
[1:27:09] it to be in your mind i want you to
[1:27:10] remember that when people start trying
[1:27:13] to chip away at this and kind of
[1:27:15] downplay this and downplay this there's
[1:27:17] a consequence of this
[1:27:19] there's a consequence our children can
[1:27:20] be a consequence our marriages can be
[1:27:22] consequent uh our own spiritual
[1:27:24] stability can be consequence because
[1:27:27] it's the spirit of the age that is
[1:27:28] working at chipping this up my brother
[1:27:31] and sister well you don't need to go to
[1:27:32] church on sunday just play tape
[1:27:37] chipping away
[1:27:40] we're in the millennium already
[1:27:44] i actually of all the doctrines there
[1:27:46] are i like that one probably the most
[1:27:49] because you see
[1:27:50] you get right down to the very core
[1:27:53] of we're in the millennium already get
[1:27:55] to the core of it not the surface stuff
[1:27:57] they throw out to you
[1:27:59] but do you know what they're really
[1:28:00] saying
[1:28:01] god's already sealed me i can do
[1:28:03] anything i want to do
[1:28:06] but you know what that really ought to
[1:28:07] mean
[1:28:08] can i take a moment and just give you
[1:28:10] what the definition of that really ought
[1:28:11] to be the millennia we're in the
[1:28:13] millennium i'm sealed i can do anything
[1:28:15] i want where's the throne i want to
[1:28:18] worship i want to live for him i want to
[1:28:20] give thanks to him give praise to him
[1:28:23] not
[1:28:23] we're in the millennium and i'm already
[1:28:25] sealed and so
[1:28:27] hey i can go do this i can go do this
[1:28:30] and i can go do this that i couldn't do
[1:28:33] before the millennium
[1:28:34] no i'm telling you my brother and sister
[1:28:36] the millennium is going to be sons and
[1:28:39] daughters of god on steroids
[1:28:43] hallelujah
[1:28:45] come on talk about what worship will be
[1:28:47] talk about what praise will be talk
[1:28:48] about what the presence and the life of
[1:28:51] christ will be that a millennium will be
[1:28:54] us on steroids amen pardon me for
[1:28:57] putting it that way
[1:28:58] amen
[1:29:00] now i'm going to just draw a little
[1:29:01] something real quick we're closing
[1:29:03] sister emmy come we need some insurance
[1:29:05] here
[1:29:08] in the way of a true prophet brother
[1:29:10] branham preached this in uh one in 1963.
[1:29:14] uh and i'm only going to draw just i'm
[1:29:16] going to read the whole thing but i
[1:29:17] really want to draw this one portion
[1:29:19] here and this here is i i'm not applying
[1:29:23] it to us but hey the word of god is
[1:29:26] always applicable
[1:29:28] look what brother brown says here now
[1:29:30] and go look this up so you get the full
[1:29:32] measure the governor government
[1:29:35] cannot build my remark was
[1:29:38] government cannot build
[1:29:40] upon
[1:29:41] iraq
[1:29:43] that the nation votes for sand
[1:29:49] look at our nation
[1:29:52] they came to a time they come to a place
[1:29:54] they rejected the word for their day
[1:29:56] the word to our nation they rejected it
[1:30:00] and now all they can do
[1:30:02] is vote for sand
[1:30:04] that's the only thing they focus on
[1:30:10] my brother put it like this while back
[1:30:14] he said uh he's a little older he's got
[1:30:16] grandkids and when he says you know hope
[1:30:19] the lord comes quickly
[1:30:21] because our children
[1:30:24] will not be able
[1:30:26] to pay for
[1:30:27] the indiscretion
[1:30:29] of our elders
[1:30:32] right that's what the prophet spoke
[1:30:33] about the
[1:30:34] children be
[1:30:35] paying they'll be paying way down there
[1:30:37] for what's being wasted right now
[1:30:39] so it's there my brother and sister
[1:30:41] we're not looking for an escape from a
[1:30:43] national debt
[1:30:45] this nation's already bankrupt
[1:30:47] i mean if you own 29 trillion or
[1:30:49] something like that or whatever it is
[1:30:51] you know it's bounced up real recently i
[1:30:53] like i like to i like to do math and
[1:30:56] numbers and money and things
[1:30:59] you know um
[1:31:01] you couldn't
[1:31:03] this is some
[1:31:06] mathematician guy
[1:31:08] if we handed you a whole truck
[1:31:10] of ten dollar bills
[1:31:12] you as an individual could not lay ten
[1:31:14] dollar bills down fast enough to cover
[1:31:17] your share of the national debt
[1:31:20] puts it in context doesn't it
[1:31:23] imagine how fast you can lay down 10
[1:31:24] bills
[1:31:25] and you wouldn't keep up
[1:31:28] now we're building a house
[1:31:33] inflation
[1:31:36] cost of everything's going up
[1:31:39] my last and final question or statement
[1:31:41] to you
[1:31:42] are you willing
[1:31:44] to pay the price

[1:32:05] on he says how are you how are you going
[1:32:07] to build your church upon the rock
[1:32:10] how will the preacher ever stand in the
[1:32:12] pulpit and preach the rock
[1:32:14] and build it upon the fundamentals of
[1:32:17] full gospel when his audience
[1:32:20] some of his people out there would put
[1:32:21] him out
[1:32:22] now i blame the preacher for not having
[1:32:24] the audacity and the spirit of god for
[1:32:26] just shutting the door and say yet
[1:32:28] somebody else will stand for that stuff
[1:32:30] not me
[1:32:31] i admire a preacher that would do that
[1:32:33] and i tell you what i admire more is a
[1:32:36] church that will stand on that word and
[1:32:39] build on that rock hallelujah aren't you

[1:38:05] don't get scared don't let the devil
[1:38:08] bluff you
[1:38:09] that if the first thing you find looks
[1:38:11] like sand
[1:38:13] that man
[1:38:15] he dredged down there he dug down there
[1:38:18] until he found the rock
[1:38:20] and the devil will try and bluff you
[1:38:23] well you're building on the wrong thing
[1:38:26] but if it's according to the word you
[1:38:28] just keep digging there'll be rock down
[1:38:30] there
[1:38:31] you get down there and get anchored into
[1:38:33] that rock and that bridge

[1:38:40] quite a sight to see sister jerry and i
[1:38:42] didn't do it but you can take tours and
