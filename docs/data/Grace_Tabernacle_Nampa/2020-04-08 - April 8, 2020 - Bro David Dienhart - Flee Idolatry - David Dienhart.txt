alive the original sleeveless leaning in for the dearest alive the original see there is no world is what I believe the Son of Man is revealed the seven field is unveiled original line original see let's just praise the Lord we certainly believe in the original life in the original seed we know that without that there'd be no life so we're glad we could have the original seed confirmed in us made manifest in us its greetings to you that are streaming glad to be here glad to have this opportunity to minister the word and I want you that are streaming just to be just like you were sitting here and you just pull on the word I believe you're here in spirit and I believe you can pull on the word from where you are and you just pull and I'm sure God will minister to your heart and then we just love the Lord and we're thankful that we have this ability and that God has allowed us to have this and and we're just here to serve Him we're not serving coronavirus we're not surname serving the the affairs of these things but we're serving the Living God who's in our midst and has conquered all and manifests and were in his control so we're thankful for this god bless you tonight if you have your Bibles wherever you are if you'd like to turn with me to the scriptures in 1st Corinthians chapter 10 we'll begin and a little service a little bit unusual here and we'll just go into this and feeling that this is the day we're in a day of certain uncertainty to the world uncertainty to the politics everything is uncertain but we have a certain we have a certainty and that certainty is the Word of God it's a certainty that we have it's a certainty that is unmovable it's unmovable we have a faith that's been given to us we're so thankful that we can say that I have I can say this tonight that I have the confirmation of his own life in me identifying and trust you can say the same thing that we have the identification living in us the confirmation of his word to identify his faith and we have the faith it'll conquer every enemy and besides that we say tonight who is coronavirus it's the enemy it's the and it's the spirit trying to work and but we're thankful that God conquered him at Calvary for us amen so I'd like you to turn if you would in 1st Corinthians chapter 10 and we'll read here starting with with well I'll just skip around here a little bit but let's start with the fifth verse let's start with the fourth verse and this is when the the children of Israel on their journey in the wilderness and they did all and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock and verse three said they all ate the same spiritual meat so it it puts us all as the believers of the message of the hour we're here and we have been on this spiritual journey and where did we're eating the same spiritual meat we drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness many of them not all of them but many of them God was not pleased because they were overthrown in the wilderness now that didn't mean God wasn't with them God was with them but they needed to do it well they needed to be dependent on that God to lead them and they got sidetracked and we want to be careful in this day that we're not sidetracked because right here at the last at the very end day that we have brother branham in the message that he was preaching where he saw the preview of the bride he said of the few not at the beginning but in the end toward the end they got a little sidetracked they began to they began to look at things that were happening around him began to see the church that was falling away and we read I hear for many of them God was not pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now God was seeing the bride but they got separated they got sidetracked and by doing that but he saw them getting back in line so God is allowing these things we know these allowing these things to happen for a purpose and we don't want to get sidetracked we don't want to be sidetracked on the politics we don't be sidetracked and what this one's doing in politics and all these things but we want to keep focused I appreciate our pastor preaching that message of keeping focused and preaching the messages on distraction but we must stay focused because the word said we look not at the things which are seen that's in 2nd Corinthians 4:18 we don't look at the things that are seen but the things that are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal and that look there is focus and we look not or don't focus at the temporal things but we're looking or focusing on the unseen things the unseen things are the eternal things and that's where God is is I believe that trying us and he's testing us he's getting us to see if we're focused he's gonna see if we're we're gonna follow him he's gonna see that no matter you're gonna watch us we're being tested we're being tried and I believe we're being tested I believe love is being tested I believe our love for him is being tested and I believe it's a time of tests and God doesn't do things with just to be doing them he's allowed these things to come on the bride but all things work together for good to them that love God we got to remember that that no matter what happens we can look at this in a different attitude than most can look at it but we see these things happening to us and God's not an author of confusion God's not an author of he doesn't do things to to just be doing them and the word I want to use is he doesn't he's not he's not doing it to be an author of frustration he's not trying to frustrate us he's got a purpose in it just like he had a purpose in law job to go through what he went through and everything has a purpose so if we just turn our focus and it's not a time to lose to lose to not press in it's not a time to get sidetracked I said but to press more than ever press and press in press into the word press into prayer press into the to the messages of the hour and continue to feed and continue to eat upon the open book and we just and and we just want to do that it's not a time to just relax and let go and I've got something here we want to haven't given a title yet but we'll see in just a minute what I'm saying it's not a time to get focused other places but focus on the eternal God and they that are born again and the little bride to focus on Christ that's in them Christ that's in you amen because there's your strength there's your refuge it isn't lay out here doesn't lay in polity suddenly everywhere else it lays in the revealed word it lays in Christ in you and so as we continue to read here with many of them God was not pleased for they were overthrown the wilderness now these things were our examples that to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted verse seven neither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play my text this morning is this and I haven't reached it in the scripture but I'll give it to you my title is this flee idolatry flee idolatry and it's I want to I want to bring light as a Holy Spirit as has put this on my heart for about about a month now I'm bringing this light to this and caught it in the word to uncover that spirit of idolatry which is fear the whole motive of all that Satan tries to do is bring fear and he's doing that to try to get you to focus on other things than the word to draw your attention to other things and give over and bow down or worship or give over to something else that you can that will become an idol because it will come to this definition a minute but anything that stands between you and God is an idol and so I'm not calling people idolaters I'm not calling you idolaters and but we've all come to this place we all make those mistakes but I believe God wants to uncover that spirit of idolatry and it's very prevalent and we'll see here as we continue to read neither be dollar ters as some of them is written the people sat down to eat drink and rose up to play they got they got Aaron to make them a calf of gold he took the jewelry and everything he says and make him a calf and and and God him said we don't know what happened to this this Moses because we put our trust in him he was our leader instead of putting their trust in the one that was leading Moses and speaking through him they begin to put their trust upon upon the man instead and the man become their idol man became their leader now we don't know what's happened to Moses so here Aaron you make us a god we can worship and we can bow down to and it'll lead us back into Egypt and so they were idolaters because they put something ahead of God the word which God had already proven himself to them over and over again that he was with them he was leading them they had the pillar fire before them and so they were and neither could let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand the stop to verse 10 neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now all these things happened unto them for examples and they and to unto them for examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world come wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall there hath no temptation or trial or tests taken you but such as common to man but God is faithful aren't you glad for that God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above what you are able but with the but with the temp table with the temptation also make a way of escape that you may be able to bear it wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry and so Paul is saying here he said beacon very very clear he said my dearly beloved he's not speaking to unbelievers he's speaking to his dearly beloved he's speaking to the bride he's speaking to those that he loved with all of his heart he's speaking to those believers too said flee from idolatry take the example don't let nothing come between you and God Amen I'd like to go to a scripture real quick and and in first John chapter 5 just reading here starting with verse 20 and 21 and we know that the Son of God has come and have given us a revelation or understanding to discern that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in His Son Jesus Christ this is the true God and eternal life verse 21 little children keep yourselves from idols amen amen in in in the message here of I just had to follow my note here just a moment and and yeah in the message be certain of God our prophet says this he said yes sir our nation is it all its greatly covered over with idolatry we might not worship wooden animals and so forth as we want to think of idolatry remember in the Old Testament they made animals they made they made high places they made images they they had images they made out of their own thinking out of their own mind they reasoned it to be this or that they worship those images they had an altar they would make sacrifice to that and and every King that came on the scene that believed God followed God destroyed those images destroyed those high places was blessed by God in his kingdom prospered and those that came along and did not follow the Lord did not give him preeminence and allowed that idolatry their kingdom suffered and was destroyed many cases and so and so we see that that was in the natural what is it in the spiritual we can see that anything and brother Branham goes on to say he says we might not worship wooden animals and so forth as we want to think of idolatry but that's not all idolatry consists of we sometimes make our automobiles our clothes and things that we'd put on or we put as and sand and the things that and the things that we put as idols anything between you and God is an idol sometimes we make our churches idols we should never do that God is the only one we should worship Amen or we should serve or we should bow to Amen it shouldn't be something else and we're gonna get into a few of those things but but there's many many things too numerous to mention here tonight but what could be your idol that you can make an idol but I believe the Holy Spirit in us will identify that and give us a choice when those things are presented because Satan in order to do that is going to use the tactic of fear to make you either to bring a fear over feelings senses and on and on we could say if you allow that to become a head over the Word of God or add to the word or take something and place it in front of that then that becomes an idol you've now now you're now your absolute has changed to that Idol Amen so so we must realize that our absolute anything our listen I'll just say it this way your absolute is going to be your God your absolute is your God so if your God's the word your absolutes the word Amen and I'm glad we have an advocate that's paid the price sent the life it to us and gave us the life inside of us to keep us because we would all be idolaters amen and I'm not even men itself I'm a many the word and I trust you can say Amen out there so so we we realize that that is where we are that God's the only one of worship and then also we we realize here that that that's what it is your absolute it should be the word now you're gonna fear now anything brother Graham says anything that stands between you and God is an idol so I just make it clear we could go over and over what he said about that but anything that stands between you and God if you and God or you and the word because God is the word is an idol it takes it takes a place of God why call you me Lord and then and means ownership and then not do what I say why call me Lord and then not do as I command so if he's your Lord then he's your absolute he's the final word he's the absolute he's the final say he's in every situation in every case in every sense in the past and and in the end complexes everything we we can you can give place to all of those things and we all have but as we grow up God's uncovering and more in a battle we realize in a battle we realize we're not on a picnic every day we are making choices every day we're facing this this this this thought of well do I make this what do I give in to this no you have one thing that your absolute you don't have to add to it or take from it is that flawless Word of God and the faith of God will anchor in the Word of God the Word of God is unmovable the Word of God doesn't need our opinion because your opinion can be your Idol but God doesn't need your opinion we want to put God many times in a box and think he's got to do this he's got to do that no God is gonna do just what he wants to do he's sovereign but he has a purpose in it all just like he did with Joe be at a purpose and Jobe didn't come around and make that and make what was happening around him say well if that's the way God's gonna do I'll just turn away from him and then create that and his own thinking and his own judgment says I'll he said no God giveth and he taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord amen he didn't bow to that even not even his wife his wife no matter and as much as as his wife meant to job job did not bow to his wife when it said you you look like a wretch job you look miserable why don't you just curse God and dive in and die the death he said you speak like a foolish woman hey man I'm not gonna bow to that spirit I'm not giving in to that I'm not going to give in to that fear I mean a job was to look at how he felt that job was to consider what was around him if job was gonna consider what was given to him which wasn't true and and his and his and those that were trying to help him of his own church if he looked at that and gave place to that he would have given place to an idol but he knew God existed he knew he was real and he believed him and that's a real believer Amen that'll take God at His Word and stand there so anything that we put ahead of God is an idol amen and so we don't want to do that we want to be sure that nothing stands in our way amen now I'll tell you what if you and will just get into this scripture other scripture in just a moment but here the message of grace and the message of grace he preached here he says the grace of God reached over in Noah's time Noah just an ordinary man he and his family but because Noah feared God now this is a different kind of fear no irreverence Noah reverence and respected and held God and esteem as being absolute so Noah feared God Noah feared God and that's not the fear we're speaking of but it is but in this case Noah feared God now listen to what he says he believed because he feared God he believed God watch what he says now you can't fear God without believing him hey men you can't fear God because how can you fear something you don't believe so how can you fear something you don't believe so if you're gonna fear it it shows you believe it now I want you to turn with me to the to a said for a second Timothy a moment if you'll turn to be the second Timothy and your Bibles 2nd Timothy chapter 1 and we'll read verse 7 they're familiar scriptures for God we're speaking now God God is the spirit God is life God is the word God doesn't change for God hath not in OT not given us the spirit of fear God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power what has he given us he's given us power whose power his own power his own authority he's given us that authority through what himself through his Spirit through his word but he's given us power and of love and of a sound mind he has not given us the spirit notice the spirit of fear so this fear we're talking about is of the devil and it's the spirit and it's his spirit and everything I don't care what is presented to you and try to get you and try to sway you over to believing that instead of the word it's a spirit Amen it's a spirit and it's the spirit of fear because because you're going to believe what you fear and if you fear it it's just like just like the Prophet talking about the woman that was frying bacon and the snapped over and God in her hand but she didn't fear it and if she didn't fear it it can't hurt her job feared something would take place and things came upon him but God knew what was in his heart and God allowed that to take place for a purpose see but how many taught us how many of us have found out the same thing something happens we fear it and guess what things begin to transpire because we put that allow that to rule over the word so we're not so what we do not want to do is let fear govern we don't want to let this devil of fear or the spirit of fear govern or control our battleground we don't want to let it control our spirit realm amen that little that man that you are on the inside is spirit inside of that's a soul we understand the Scriptures so we want to look at here is this he said you'll never you'll never you'll never look at one of them until you first have to let God or let Satan in there you have to let him in now before we read that before we read that I would like you to turn with me to 2nd Corinthians 10:5 if you on the line online have your Bibles I hope you do following along in 2nd Corinthians 10 and verse 5 very familiar scriptural to start with verse 3 for we walk for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds a watch casting down imaginations something that's presented to you that you imagine something looks reason or something that Satan presents to your mind something it's not courting to the word brother-sister imagination reasoning memory conscience those are fine as long as they agree with the word but if they don't agree with the word we are to cast them down so we cast down anything imagination an imagination an image now Satan is going to try to present you an image I mean I mean we know that's true I mean you can agree with me that Satan on the battleground will present an image that will that will bring fear over the word amen he's trying to do that for a purpose and we'll get into that just a moment so he's casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God that's the Word of God and bringing into can that's the mind of God also the mind of God is the word against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of the anointed word Christ so we must be ready we must be we must be vigilant over these things daily every day and so we and watch how he does this he says now you'll never you'll never look brother Brown I'm saying you'll never look at one of them until you first have to let Satan in here what's he saying in that thought in the mind in the battleground you have to let him in then when he gets in he's got control then what does he do what does he do what does this spirit of fear do he begins to use the conscience he begins to use this begins to use this outlet what is it see taste feel smell hear imagination conscience memory reason affections he begins to use all those different little channels and as long as he can get in above this one here what's the brother I'm saying as he's got to first get in above the word in the control room of your soul if you're born again the word is in there but you're going to have to take the word will the word you're going to take that word and you're gonna put it on the battlefield and he's got to come above that one first he's got to come above that one see we're realizing now who we are and the authority we have he's got to come above that in other words he's got to bind the strongman of the house before he can rule the house he's got to bind the strongman who's the strongman of your house it's the word the strongman of you of your house is the word Amen if he's in you living he's the word and he's he's wanting you to come and that's why I believe things are happening because God wants us to depend upon him he wants us to depend not become independent but to depend upon him and he's going to see what we're gonna do in these things when we have to stay home and when we can't go here and we can't travel maybe as much as we did or can't go into jobs and this and that what are you going to come back to what are you gonna do are we going to get lakhs are we gonna press it harder are we going to become lakhs are we gonna just give in to these things no we're not going to give in we're going to press in God's wanting to see if you're really going to trust him he's gonna see if you really got trust and can give yourself over completely to his trust and trust him with your body trust him with your feeling trust him with your finances trust him with your home trust him with all these things can we trust him can we put the word first are we going to allow him to come above this word over here and and listen to our conscience listen to what we see taste feel smell hear allow them to become the idols in our life are we going to give way to seeing are we gonna give way to feeling are we gonna give way are we gonna give way to the word What did he say what did he promise that's our absolute that should be our absolute not let him in above the word but he's got to come above there in order to take over your mind to come in your mind first he has to come above the word and then you have to so you've got a decision to make you've got a choice to make and we realize by realizing who we are we're recognizing our authority and what we say in the decisions we make and what we confess God is a high priest of that confession and will stand behind that confession hallelujah and there and we'll waiting and many things and we'll get into in a minute here he's waiting on us to make that decision and every day we're looking we're making those decisions because we must deny yourself daily Jesus said if you're gonna follow me you've got to know yourself you can allow yourself to be your idol your own self is your Idol you can make your own self your own thinking your own feelings your Idol but that's not our Idol that's not our absolute amen we're not bowing to that we won't worship that we will refuse to serve that we're gonna serve the word all right so so he's got to come above it he's got to come in your mind first and you have to accept it listen it can batter against you but it can't get to you until you accept it you can't it can batter against you and you and we all have weaknesses we all have something in our life that that's an open and it can be an open door that unless you keep it covered by the word Satan is going to try to use that against you we all have every one of us got that little place and you're gonna try to use that against you to work against you and that's the part you've got to keep covered by the word because you've got to recognize he can't just come sliding in you've got to let him and when God identifies that and you see that's the devil then don't let him hold to the word don't accept fear because Satan to trying to get you to fear your conscience fear your senses fear your imagination fear your memory fear your reasoning fear these fear of the past something happened in the past Satan brings it up he knows there's a weakness there you don't fear that past you don't fear the complexes you don't fear what other people say or do man it's not your absolute the word is your absolute Amen so what we must not do we must not lay down our soul Satan is trying to anoint you he's trying to get you to bow he's trying to what he's trying to do let me just say it like this he's trying to get you to lay your sword down don't let Satan try to anoint you with fear that your sword or your weapon is not strong enough to withstand him or to destroy him or or other words to defeat him or put him down don't let the devil tell you don't let him get you to fear something in order what's he trying to do anoint you what's he trying to anoint us with that for what do we battle with this every day our enemy is our own carnal mind our enemy is laying right there and Satan knows how to to use these senses and brother Branham said don't you give in to what Satan and how and anything he offers you through your senses he said that greatest battle ever fought don't you let him do it and you're gonna see we're gonna cover a lot of things about you letting you not letting you letting or not letting he said but you are to destroy your enemy the Prophet said before your enemy destroys you in other words you undo him first John 3:1 said the Son of God was manifest to destroy the works of the devil and so and so other words to undo it we don't have to yield to it we can destroy it and because Satan wants you to do under work under his anointing he can't create but he knows you can and he's wanting to inspire you to do that and create something that's not according to the word Amen so so we realize Satan's tactics as it becomes unveiled to us his Spirit has this this this spirit of idolatry is strong no wonder Paul said flee it no wonder he said little children John said little children fleeing he told the brother to flee it because it's more than just idols and wooden idols it comes into the spiritual working here on our mind and we must recognize that and not give in to it what are we going to do put the word there first okay we got a ways to go here so we just want to keep moving on now he said in order he said no man no woman can disbelieve the devil's lie until you they have disbelieved God's truth now let's just let's just eat on this a minute here he said he said he said no man no woman can believe the devil's lie until they have first disbelieved God's truth that's not saying you're disbeliever an unbeliever but there is that he's trying to anoint us with the spirit of unbelief and we're either gonna get many times he'll try to trip us up and we find where we did but thank God we have an advocate thank God we have the blood thank God we have a keeping power that we can come back to and and realign our self with the word and go right on because we must deny yourself daily no I just deny yourself take up our cross daily and follow him so because you have to disbelieve God's truth so you see you see even Adam where it places us this morning which places us under the same thing having a choice in order to disbelieve the devil's lie you have to ignore God's truth first the Prophet said before you can believe the devil's lie he said have you ever thought of that have you you have to deny the truth first before you can believe a lie right you have to deny it in other words you have to turn away from it you have to give in to one or the other amen but to the believer that tonight the believers the believers out here hearing your absolute is the word your absolute is not a history your absolute authsub your absolute is the I am that's present with us now it's in you now that will that believes the word the believers on the inside of your soul that's who the believer is that faith in you is the believer that word revealed as a believer amen so first Kings 18:21 I won't go to there but yes I will first Kings 18:21 let me read what Eli just said one up there in Mount Carmel when he challenged those those idol worshipers verse 21 first Kings 18:21 and Elisha came unto the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the Lord be God if the Lord be God if he's your object of worship if he's your absolute serve him follow him but if Bale then follow him and the people answered him not a word Amen but here it is tonight why halt we between two opinions we're gonna go out here we're gonna face the devil well we're gonna go out here we've been eating the book and it's sweet in their mouth but we begin to digest it it's become bitter in our stomach it's become bitter we have to we have to face reproach we have to face persecution we have to face the reproach of the enemy because we're bearing his life in our flesh and it's not easy but we must but we have the Advocate we have the word we have the keeping power we can we can go back to the word refused to give the devil his place through fear amen amen so so John 14:27 said Paul Jesus said my peace I give unto you my peace I leave with you let not your heart be troubled let it not be afraid amen John 14:27 Colossians 3 and we'll just go to that one now Colossians 3 Colossians chapter 3 and verse set a verse 15 starting and let here again we let there's a word let and let we must let the peace of God rule or other words umpire have the absolute say have the final word have the ultimate word we must let it rule in our hearts amen to the which also you are called in one body and be ye thankful let hear again let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the Father by him what's Satan presenting to us why is he wanting us to bow down to these things because he hates the manifestation of the word for the hour and that's why we're here that's why we're on this earth because we are the message living we're the message of the seventh angel we're the message sent forth living out in human flesh and Satan knows if he can get u-turned if he can get you away from from from that solid word and can come over above it and come down into that battlefield and you let him then he's gonna try to govern and what's he gonna do what's that what's that feel what's that battleground governed it's your it's your physical being it's what you do and think and say it's what you do and so because the spirit controls the body that's not that's not the Spirit Holy Spirit that's your spirit controls the body and Satan knows we get to control the body he can stop that word maybe for a season for a little bit from being manifested but you are on this earth for a purpose and that's to manifest God for this hour that's what you're called to that's what your position is here to do you're called here to manifest God for the season hallelujah for the hour and Satan's trying his best to get you sidetrack to get your focus off of the things that are eternal and which you are and who you are Jesus told us Jesus said I give you power Luke 10:19 he said I give you power over all the power of the enemy I give you authority I give you power and-and-and-and here God is saying to us I've not given you the spirit of fear but I've given you power I've given you love I've given you whose love I've given you my power I've given you my love and I've given you my mind I've given you a sound mind you can lean on that you can trust in that you can walk in that and I will honor it and I will back it up amen that's it we must recognize why we're here and why and God's allowing us to go through this time to glorify Him hallelujah nothing can come your way he said I will provide all of your needs we serve a living God we serve a resurrected Savior we serve we his he has risen he's here right now today just as as powerful and just the same as he ever was he hasn't changed his word is the same his power is the same his love is the same and his love can't fail if we just recognize people that his love can't fail and so what is love do it puts trust you can't have love you can't have God's love without having God's faith because they go hand in hand if you have the love of God you have the faith of God what's God wanting us to see us use it you're growing up now children you've grown up now I want to see you use the word the word my word of faith my word revealed in you my self my word is in your mouth you confess it and act upon it you confess the same thing I said let it be in your mouth let that word of faith of faith be in your mouth and I will perform it because that's not you that's my word and he has to honor that word just as certain is the honor to yesterday he has to honor it again because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and this new birth on us and the whole person of who we are is Jesus Christ revealed hallelujah praise the Lord Amen I love the word here brother Branham says if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word if you want deity how many I know and you people on the on the streaming here we could raise your hands with me as I want deity in my midst I want deity here I want to see God working I want to see God manifesting himself I want to see it more than I've ever had I need more of him and I'm coming to his word and I'm feeding on that open book that I might be that ministry that voice in this hour that God has appointed me to be that I we'll be and then I'm that I will go out and and and as the Bible said prophesy again because what the prophet prophesied under our messenger we become that voice we become the final voice to the to the people to the world God they're hearing from God again but Satan is trying to present through fear something that you take instead of the word he's going to use fear that's his major assault that's his major thing is fear if he can get you to fear it then he can get you on that side if he can just stop it for a little he's trying he knows he knows the word will stop him the word will not do it and what are we saying this for tonight for us to realize that spirit is very subtle that spirit trying to work that spirits trying to trying to work in our myths trying to work through the people he has no other channel Satan cannot just come in and do something without you allowing it he's got to he's got to present something he's got to present an image something in your mind you're either gonna let it ruse your they gonna let you are they gonna accept it or you're gonna reject it amen look at look at what he he says the Prophet says over here let me finish that quote if you want deity in your midst and welcome and receive the word don't ever let anyone or anything come get between you and that word now you can see you can see why Paul said he's made a way of escape you got your trials you've got your temptations you can see that but he and every one of those things he's not going to allow you to go more than what you can bear and with the temptation he's gonna make a way of escape and it's right there for us it's laying right there in the word we are called in command to wait on God expect on God not just try to step out ahead of him wait on him wait for him to quicken his word wait for him to show you that place of escape that you can escape it you have a way out of it hallelujah you've been given that way out amen watch what he said and greatest battle ever fought again he says see it's your mind that opens the door we realized that Roman in Romans 7 and verse 25 Paul said I serve God by the inward man on 22nd verse 25th verse he said I serve the Lord Jesus Christ with my mind I'm just I'm not reading I'm just quoting it to you go back and pick it up but he said but with my mind whose mine Paul wasn't talking about his carnal mind when he said I serve God with my carnal mind because that's an enemy of God but he said I don't serve God that way I serve God with the mind he's given me with the Holy Spirit in me I serve the Living God with my mind Paul said we have the mind of Christ amen he's given us his mind born again you have his mind you have his leadership you have his spirit you have his faith you have his love and faith which pleases God operates by love that's why love can't fail that's why I love if you have love you're going to trust you're gonna be trusting him it's our trust in him that he's looking for in this hour it's our trust how are we going to trust him how are we going to stand the storm isn't going to get easier as the days go by is going to get stronger we are facing a body change we are facing it now where it's right upon us brother sister how much longer I don't know but we know we're in the time we know we're in the season and we got to we've got the stabilizers have been put on the ship you've got to hold steady just keep right on walking hold to that word and don't just casually come in we must press in how we gonna press in by the word by eating the book by feasting on the word for the season for the hour because through that comes life if we feast on the word for the season we're coming underneath that blood and in that blood is life and we must have life and that life comes through the word for the season amen and so and so there's only he said now listen it's your mind now he's talking so I'm not he's not talking about the mind let me let me go over to Roman's just a minute six the sixth chapter here so I just read something else here Romans the sixth chapter and I had that written down didn't know if I'd read it or not but we'll just take that time six verse 12 now here again let you notice God's saying to us tonight don't let he's trying to show you you have authority over the spirit of fear to not let do not let anything become above me you he's given us you you say how come how can that be brother David because you're his offspring you're his seed you're his life you're the one you're here you're here because God's wanting to see through you take your authority as a son you've been given authority through his spirit against these devils you but you are a king and you have rulership over the world and over sin and over darkness and over and over the devil's and Satan knows that as long as you stand with that word there and recognize who you are and holding that word for there's not one thing he can do because you're because my love you're holding that word in faith and you're applying the token and he's helpless we're gonna get into this just a minute and further six chapter verse 12 let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lusts thereof because your body your human body your human mind is not born again and it will gravitate toward the negative it will gravitate toward the senses it will always pick up that so your cart your warfare is not with carnal weapons your warfare is the Spirit of God it's the Word of God in you written here amen made alive in you hallelujah that's your that's your weapon neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God hallelujah alright so going back to this here in greatest battle ever fought it's your mind that opens up the door now the door to what the door to the battlefield the door to what comes in there and what doesn't the door to that channel see it's your mind that now that that mind is not your carnal mind it's the spirit the mind of Christ it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections but when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the Word of God and Satan cannot battle against that no sir he cannot battle against it now we know that's true but give God's Word the first place amen you give it the first place you give it headship you give it the place just like a wife would give her husband authority over her body you give it you give your husband authority amen you give the word the authority over your affairs over your circumstance you put the word over it and Satan cannot batter he cannot stand he cannot break through that word there's one thing Satan cannot do Jesus defeated him by the word he said it's written it's written it's written he didn't come and argue with the devil he said it's written that's what he did he just simply went back to the word of what was written of him and said it's written amen that's where our that's where our defense is that's where we defeat the devil is right back to the word it's written amen and so as we go into this a little bit further let's let's see here now I want to get ahead of myself here now all right so are the word then is our consolation we take up our cross daily and follow him we we have one thing to make sacrifice to and that's the word we sacrifice our self take up our cross and follow him that's our absolute that's our constellation is the word the word which cannot lie God cannot lie and it's our refuge in this time in this hour it's our consolation amen he's our refuge he's our defence he's my rock he's my refuge he is my everything he is all in all I don't have to let him have his way or do any of this see and we'll come as that did we go along now as I said if you want deity in your midst then give the word that right place don't let anything become between you and that word and remember the God is the word now God's waiting on your decision waiting to see what you're gonna say about it watch what he says here he says he promised he said I keep I will keep my word a conference is being held now he's holding it with you you've got to make a decision God's wanting God's waiting for your reply I'll serve you Lord I want the Holy Ghost or I don't want it I won't have it or I'll tear or I'll take it away I believe you healed me Lord God's wanting to hear what your decision is you're the one that has to make it he's done made his he's proved that he's made his now you've got to make yours I got to make mine the church has got to make his we've all got to make our decisions what will you do about it now when the same God comes to you and is pleased to dwell in you please to honor your word please honor what your decision is amen brother Branham said on the message in church age book here he says don't fear John don't fear little flock all that I am you are heir to all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear and failure but I've come to bring love courage and ability all power is given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word in other words you make your decision you say what it be and I will perform it you speak the word and I will perform it that is my covenant and it can never fail amen this mystery now listen to this this mystery that we have that's been open to the bride in this hour this hidden mystery this mystery that's been sealed up in you amen this mystery that has been and it's not just you but it's the whole bride but you in this hour God's trying to reveal this mystery and the mystery revelation all hell's against it but it's the bride stand she's standing on it that's her stand now listen why do you hunger Church other words he's trying to reveal or unveil the word for your day the message to you in you he's trying to reveal it in you unveil it in you why do you hunger church why do you thirst it's a father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you watch but you let you let many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares of the world you let some pastor you let somebody else or some other man get it out of you when you know that way down in your heart you're thirsting and hungry it's God trying to reveal it to you see he's trying to reveal it to you but you let a man you see how subtle the devil can be those lot of things look very reasonable and some of them are reasonable but when it comes between you and that word you've got to make a stand you have to make a stand you either gonna let or not let I don't care what the circumstances lose immediately Satan gonna say boy if you make a stand like that what are you gonna think you may lose your job for doing that well if I lose my job then I lose it but I'm gonna take God at His Word hey man I'm gonna do what he says to do I'm not gonna let this Idol of fee I'm not gonna let this Idol of fear I'm not gonna let this spirit of fear put this over on me and get me to fear what might happen if the word said it then I'm gonna take God at His Word and you watch what happens God will stand behind it amen we let we can let all kinds of things have we can let pleasures we can let I dunno what are we doing with our time God's many times right now God's given us more time probably we've had in a long time he's given us some time what are we doing with it are we taking time to press into the word more we're speaking oh I'm thinking to myself we're speaking every one of us I'm speaking to all of you out there are we giving the time to God are we giving over to him are we allowing him to feed us a what he's wanting to see what are we gonna do what's our what's our action toward this are we caught up under the the news media are we caught up under the panic are we come up into this well that this one got it this one's been in the message and he's come down with coronavirus what are we gonna do are we gonna fear it now because someone else did then immediately you've produced an idol you've made an eye you've given over to one but what the word say I will keep thee I will lead thee I will control where you go and what you do are you just follow me that doesn't mean we just go out here and buck all the government as long as they as long as we do things that's not contrary the word then we use we still use Sensibility God's given us reasoning God given a sense but if those things leave the word leave it amen so we must stay in the word but God's gonna see what we're gonna do with it amen so we must give God first place he doesn't want second place he wants the first place you see God wants the first place he doesn't want the second I'm gonna I want to get this over here we don't have free thinking you say I do my own thinking you ain't got no free thinker you're no free thinker there's no free thinking let the mind that was in Christ being you God must have first place in your heart first place in your life first place in everything that you do or what you are God must have first place he doesn't want second place he doesn't deserve second place he deserves the best he deserves the first and all that you got he deserves it not what men say it's not what the church says it's not what the but what the will of God is all we need to seek the will of God not the favor of your neighbor not the favor of your children not the favor of your husband or your wife but seek the will of God and do that first then everything else the will of the wife the will of the children will fall right in line with it place God first hole brothers sister the most important thing in our lives to entertain Jesus Christ give him first place in worship first place in your life first place in your dressing first place he deserves the first place put it over put it over your clothing put it on our wheat doors our Idol our clothes and how we look is our Idol the opinions of others what is that Idol that Satan is trying to use he's trying to get you to bow to that thing well as I said we can make anything an idol Satan can take anything and put it ahead of the word if you allow it to be a head of a word you're making an idol amen we must hold to that little wheel in the middle of the wheel let it stabilize every move in every motion you make every thought you have may it be controlled by this power on the inside of you because God is setting God is setting right in his word and of this hour in the evening light and showing forth that light so let that little wheel it's in your soul that little wheel in the middle of the wheel let it stabilize every move in every motion that you make whatever you do in word or deed do it all the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so let it have first place you let it as I said Satan has got to get you he can't just come in he's first got to get you to agree with his will before he can do anything and so what is God asking for agreement with his will amen just take its word and that is going to determine what's inside of you Amen in your soul that's what we want as believers that's all we want and so Satan say no I mean the Lord saying okay let me uncover this a little bit further to you let me uncover that spirit how it's all right around you what it's trying to do and that sounds a little harsh and say well now you're bowing to an idol but that's exactly if you allow that to come that's what it is that's what it becomes Amen so see flee it flee it and every day and every time you come under situations and circumstances don't you listen don't you allow anything to govern you and control you but the word yes it's hot and heavy yes the battle's heavy it's probably not going to get any easier as we go along but that but the harder it gets the more true the word becomes because it's because God's gonna see to it that he's gonna meet your need he's gonna face that when you have need of it he's got it he's gonna raise a standard against it is that right you're gonna lift up that standard that's what he's doing today amen amen all right so God expects his children to be dependent upon him overcoming look at what he says overcoming or to overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks he said a lot of people think there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know he's the devil then at the same time you recognize him notice what the Prophet says overcome means to recognize him in every one of his tricks you must recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you then Rose who's he against my brother he is he doesn't care about David he's against the word that lives in me he's against the word that's living in you people amen he's against that word that's what he's against that's what the battles about see but you're not you don't let them rule over you you let the word rule over you Amen you you rule over them you're not letting him rule over you you rule over the over him or over them over these things that he's trying to get you to bow to maybe like I said it's reasoning or conscience or memory or your past or your complexes or something that happens something that you're going through whatever it may be you lay on that word you hold that word right steady with it maybe you're not feeling well put the word over it amen amen don't let your senses govern what you do don't let that become your idol all right so to recognize him you must recognize that God that the God in you is greater you must recognize his against you than to overcome you must recognize that the God in you the word in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has already overcome him by His grace do we realize that he's already overcome and God's has already defeated him already stripped him of every legal right against you and you rest recognize that and take a hold of that word and recognition of that you must you must then how to overcome he must realize that he that is in you has already overcome him already defeated him that makes you more than a conqueror that makes you a possessor then of what God has conquered for you and God's expecting you to take the land amen now bow to the not bow to the idols of the land now bow to the idols of the flesh but bow but bow to the word and take the land and so he that sinew has overcome him and by his grace you are more than a match for him that's real overcoming when you recognize amen hallelujah and be too far here and we'll be closing amen so no free thinking you know a free thought coming in God doesn't need your opinion don't let your opinion become your idol amen it's not your opinion about it it's what God said about it and act upon that if we recognize it to be his word than act upon it amen praise the Lord all right let's go to first John four first John four four and then move down here diverse about 16 but first John turn to first John four you are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world jump down here to verse and having now let me just say this having the same spirit in us that was in him then we have the same spirit of faith 1st 2nd Corinthians 4 said we have the same spirit of faith we believe and therefore speak I hope we catch that I hope we understand that that we have that same spirit of faith because the spirit that was in him as in us it may be a different body outward but the same spirit is in us the same word the same power the same Authority it's Jesus Christ the same amen we have the same spirit of faith then in back in 1st John 4 he says this verse 17 herein is our love let me back up 16 and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God other words if you're dwelling in God you're dwelling in love and God in him herein is our love made perfect I hope we're seeing that herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is and that's the day we're in because as he is so are we in this world right now right at this present time there's a people in the land there is those that dwell in God and God in them and as he is so are we in this world there is no fear listen to this there is no fear in love there is no fear in love it's just not there it's not there there's no fear in love but perfect love that's god's love perfect love agape love perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect or complete in love we love him because he first loved us so what is love do and I'm gonna close here with these next few comments I believe love has no fear this is on the token Dallas Texas love has no fear love casts out fear and I noticed in my meeting so much that when I come in into the people one of the great things I find among them is fear and what makes fear is lack of confidence or lack of trust lack of faith or other words it's the lack of love it's a lack of confidence if you lack confidence it'll make you fear but if you love it casts away that fear Amen and though and that's the way God wants his church not so many as charter members he wants members that's loyal and loves and believes and has confidence in him all of the great holy church only realized its power to do these things but there's so much doubt and fear and trembling wonder if it will could it happen as long as that exists the church can never stand upright and when every talk of fear is vanished and the holy spirit is completely in control of the church then all fears are gone and that church has the power see why they have everything that heaven owns behind them they're ambassadors of the throne solutely an ambassador of Christ has the authority and everything that Christ owns belongs to that ambassador he's purchased it for you God's wanting us to recognize it and take it as your own and don't let the devil come in and bring fear on your situation or whatever it may be and you make and yet let him put that as an idol of before you and you place that before the word god help us god help us to recognize this enemy's tricks amen all right now he says and he said go ye into all the world you are my and witnesses after the Holy Ghost has come on you and what does a witness is an ambassador is to come and witness something the whole powers of heaven is right in your hands or why do we set and the churches barren and we set dormant is because we don't recognize these things what is it a lack of it's probably a lack of feeding on the word as we should be we're giving over to other things because faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word that's where the church is you're always scared it's not going to happen now brother sister God's church is growing that's why God's opening up more and more to the enemies see he send them covered that's what Satan hates he hates preaching like this he hates to be able he hates himself uncovered he said that's the reason it don't happen because you're scared it's not going to happen when that fear he said love cast out fear and when you got love listen to him when you got love fear is gone but as long as you got fear love cannot operate what is this fear that Satan presents to us it's panic it's terror it's dread it's worried it's anxiety go on and on this spirit of fear is timidity or be timid other words a lack of courage or confidence easily frightened apprehensive you're a coward your cowardice a lack of bravery faint-hearted that's what the fear he's given us every one of us every one of us faces that almost every day he's going to get you to reason he's gonna try to get you to think it through or put you before it or the situation every Cedric center I think I think you fully understand I'm closing here there's only two faculties that govern a human and one of them is faith which brings results and the other is fear which has no value in it at all faith is of God fear is of the devil fear makes you weary faith makes you our fear excuse me fear makes you worry and fear makes you wonder we have faith look at what we have I hope you can say Amen out there because what do you have if you're in Christ you have faith and we have love if you're dwelling in God but if we but if we had love we have faith in other words one can't work without the other they both go together for that is perfect love casteth out all fear and when fear is gone listen to the statement I'm closing when fear is gone faith is perfect you're scared he won't keep his word but I believe that he does what is your faith say this evening what does your what does your heart say what is your faith what does that believer say in your word I believe his word his word is perfect it's flawless he can't make a mistake his ways are perfect and he's leading me perfect and he's controlling me perfect and no matter where I go or what I do he's had allow it he must allow it Satan can't come walking in unless he allows it so we are being tried we are being tested we were being tried by these things he's allowing Satan to do that to see what we're doing to teach us to train us to let us see we don't have to come under this we can cast it out when fear is gone faith is perfect you're scared it won't keep his word but I believe he does no need of being scared the worst thing the devil can put upon you is fear amen so we need to cast down the idol of fear amen amen trust that this has helped you out on the line tonight Trust has been a blessing to you and God expects his children to trust him God expects his children to trust him for everything they have but we want to trust the hand of man don't trust the hand of man don't trust jobs don't trust nothing but truck don't trust money don't make money your idol don't make money your criteria whether you do or don't whether you serve God or don't don't let riches don't let money don't let lands don't let houses don't let parents or children don't let family don't let your clothes don't let your your what you see what you feel reason memory constants we can go on and on and on don't let these things govern put the word first he doesn't deserve second place brother Graham said many make sex appeal their idol of worship amen he said you need maybe you need new clothes that's legitimate but when you but when you make that your idol how of how you must be so and span all the time maybe it's your home maybe it's something else has taken that place of that thirst and calling it ought to be God God is that everlasting satisfying portion see we put too much emphasis on think we allow even the LITTLEST of things to move us away here's God moving wanting us to pray wanting us to get in the word well I've got to do this if I don't do this I'll get behind
