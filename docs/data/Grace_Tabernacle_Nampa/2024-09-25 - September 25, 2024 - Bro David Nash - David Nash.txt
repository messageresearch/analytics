to grieve away your Holy Spirit God forgive us wash our hearts wash our lives and if there's condemnation father in our hearts you said greater is your word greater are you than our hearts so let the greatness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with us from this moment on in every heart and every life and as I approach your word father reading from the Holy Scripture Lord today he said the voice of your beloved call in Lord to your bride Let It Be Your Voice tonight speak into to your bride to your your people to those online to whoever would be listening if there's someone there you don't know Christ please surrender your heart just now as we proceed for this service in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you it's wonderful to see yall you had our assistant pastor this last Sunday did he do okay he always I always ask him well how'd you do and he said well nobody left so uh he feeds us well at home he takes a lot of the services there so I hope he did you well maybe I'll just add a little dessert to it um God bless each and every one of you uh we spoke on these things up there this weekend while he was down here uh a little different twist I thought it was you know sometimes a guy do things the same but the Lord sort of turned it around a little bit this afternoon so while not to keep you standing but God bless every one of you and I always like to think of it as you know prophet of God said that our uh you know three of our greatest gifts were you know Salvation through Christ a a good maid or a loving family like that and then the other thing he said is our time I want to thank you before we even start just for you coming and sharing your time with me CU that's a great gift from you to me so God bless you if we turn to Song of Solomon thank you musicians it was beautiful wonderful thank you I so enjoy the the violins and not no guitar tonight but if he was here I'd be praising him too know Song of Solomon is not a a real big book it's not that many chapters but it's so rich and so full because it talks about the relationship of Jesus Christ and his bride sister Sue God bless you good to see you too she's short there I almost missed her looking over the TV thing here God bless you and so it's talking about a relationship of Christ and the bride and when we think about what the Christian walk is all about is a relationship with God so if we could turn to chapter two I'll read about three verses there I believe it is we'll start out with the first one is everybody there I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys as a lily among the Thorns so is my love among the daughters and we'll drop down to verse 8 the voice of my beloved behold he come leaping upon the mountains skipping upon the hills and then I had uh one other one there I think it's verse 14 oh my Dove that art in the casss of the Rock in the secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and and th countenance is comely gracious heavenly father that should be enough to start the service asking you lead lead and guide us in the direction in which you would have us speak this evening in the name of Jesus Christ amen please be seated we've heard a lot of gospel most of us I mean some of you young people it's a lot of this is new a lot of it's uh the things we hear I understand but for most of us older folks uh we've heard a lot of gospel we've heard a lot of messages preached a lot of tapes whatever it is that wherever we've heard and how that uh there's a relationship through the preaching of the Gospel the the Bible you know in one place calls it foolishness through the foolishness of preaching and but it's through that foolishness that he has ordained salvation yes what is foolish to man is to God the most uh important thing and how that you know man calls certain things great and God says it's foolish and God calls something great and people we think well that's kind of foolish it was but it's through that foolishness that we gain the relationship that we have with Jesus Christ and I wanted before we actually get into it I'm sure you're familiar with this uh scripture Hebrew 138 I'm a Bible preacher I I I'll you know I don't use a whole lot of what we say quotes or uh other things like that and uh because every word in this book even you know brother brandham said that every word in here is inspired and if we read it there's an inspiration behind it so Hebrews 13:8 I know you're familiar with it and I probably mentioned it before but it says you know Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and as we think about that and we think thanks buddy I got one for each hand now praise the Lord thank you you and as we think about that in that particular scripture it's telling us that the the Jesus Christ that was yesterday H is the same God that is today but he is forever and when you begin to study through that scripture a little bit and start actually looking up the words and looking at it it means that the god that spoke yesterday is the same God that speaks today and I I know this is big words especially maybe for you young people that it's it says copulative cumulative in the uh dissertation from the interpreters and what that actually means it's an extremely close relationship that accumulates it's like when two people get married they that close relationship brings something more it brings children into the Earth and so that you know that coming together accumulates something and with the voice of Jesus Christ because he's The Voice voice of God to us that was was there yesterday and that is here today it's going to produce something and what that voice produces is forever think about that the god that spoke before that's speaking now today produces forever to the Believers if we can receive the fact that we're in a close relationship with Christ and that though that that which was yesterday and that which is today is going to produce in us it's going to accumulate into forever and take us out of this world into the presence of forever which is Jesus Christ so we see that the word is about producing a relationship even in simplest form there in verse eight and how I like to think that as we consider where we're living and what time we're living in and all of the things going around us I'll read just quickly from Revelations the first chapter and again I realize most of you are familiar with this but in the first chapter of the Book of Revelations or third chapter I'm sorry uh it's talking about ages of the church system it's not talking it does speak directly to single churches as in Ephesus samna pergamus thyrus and when it comes down to chapter 3 uh it goes into uh well the last one it speaks about is Le oia and he starts out and says and unto the angel of the Church of the leodan write these things uh write these things saith the amen so God is speaking and this is a god of yesterday okay that was speaking here to the angel uh these things saith the amen that is the final word that means what so be it is how it's usually uh spoken to people is is if this what he speaking here is going to become exactly what he says it is and so he he said there sayith the amen and the faithful and true witness this is Jesus Christ speaking as the faithful and true witness he is the one that's filled with faith and he is the witness to the things that are being spoken and it for them you know for the the Apostle in this particular case the god of yesterday was becoming the god of today and in that relationship that he's speaking there to the Apostle John in that relation ship and in these words it's going to produce something and what it's going to produce is forever in these words in this he's the faithful and the true witness because he is now the one who was faithful unto every word that was spoken of him as far as being savior he stuck with every word so closely and even when going up to his crucifixion I don't maybe you haven't noticed before and we we spoke about it a few years ago for Brother Rich and how that when they first offered him the soop with the the vinegar and stuff on the cross he spit it out he would not taste of that and yet but right before he passed right before he it said the spirit departed from him right before he died on Calvary they offered it him to him again and he drank it why would that be he had to fulfill all righteousness every scripture his relationship he was God the word being manifested in flesh he was called the Nazarene he had a Nazarite vow and you go back and you read the vows of the Nazarene he was not allowed to to partake of the vinegar and he spit it out he fulfilled his part his relationship with that verse because he was a Nazarene but at the end right before he passed he drank it because he had to fulfill the scripture I believe it's either in Isaiah or Psalms where it said they gave him vinegar and Gall to drink and he drank it his relationship with with the word of God was so powerful and so strong he was the witness that the word of God is true and then it says that he's the beginning of the creation of God it doesn't say God's creation he was the starting point of God creating himself the god of yesterday becoming today for for us to take us into forever and he's the beginning of that and as we receive that we become part of Hebrews 138 and a ton of others and hundreds of other scriptures and as we look at that third chapter there of Revelations what I as I was reading it today I I never really thought about it in this particular form but the church world is going through a transition they were called out you know back in all the way back to Ephesus when the all the way actually back to the the church at Pentecost and how they were called out and they began to grow and they went through the exact same cycle that Jesus did because the the spirit of Christ was in him and he went through a birth Life Death burial and Resurrection just as we see every day when the sun comes up birth Life Death burial and resurrection and because he did that and because his Spirit was planted into the Church of God or the Church of the Living God as we would call it the church went through the same cycle it went through a transition of uh uh you know in Ephesus this great church this we call it the lion the lion roared that Spirit the the four spirits that Ezekiel Saw when he saw God that lion roared and that that church went out and it preached everywhere Fearless regardless of what they did regardless of what they had to do they preached fearlessly because they had the spirit of the lion but the time came when they transitioned into the spirit of the man and how that I mean the ox came first and the ox was a sacrificial Beast and the church was sacrificed it was sacrificed and died in the dark a ages when they even you know according to the Catholic Catholic Church according to their own records they killed 68 million Christians that's not counting the ones they that got missed along the line the church as we think of it died and the word died with it and then but then it became the the man the spirit of the man and the the knowledge of man began to they got a hold of the scriptures and through man's knowledge they begin they were able to start picking up and going well that's not right that's not right God never ordained that and so that took them into the what we call the spirit of the eagle and we know that Spirit of the eagle culminated in a relationship of a prophet's message because God types his Eagles to they can see further than any Beast they soar the skies I'll never forget we were coming back I think it was from Panama coming in over the the uh the sea there coming down into Houston and I think they told us we were around 30,000 ft uh over the Gulf of Mexico and I remember just kind of kicked back on the airplane and I I looked up and above the airplane you could barely see it but way up there was this Eagle circling in the storm friends 34,000 I think is what they told us and he was above us and he didn't seem to have any trouble seeing things because that was the spirit that was sent to the church but that spirit that was sent to the church and if you when think about it when you go home and you read this you know there about Le oia because I found it so interesting because it actually parallels the uh Song of Solomon in a lot of ways because in it there he speaks as a church of transition going through this transition as we read those other Church ages and as a church of transition what it brings is a transformation these words words are not there just to tell us oh we're going through this time and we're going through these struggles and and the whole world and we know all this information about the world and we know how they're headed for the mark of the beast and hope I didn't tear something up too bad I always have trouble with those little wires but I don't know what it is Jerry what is it it's so nice to have you here but it's not just going to show us that the church is in transition it's bringing us from that transition into a transformation we are being transformed into the image of God that spirit and those and those all of those uh faces and what they represent is certain Natures that was on the the spirit of the church and in time to take him through those Transitions and through the transition we have today but even as we're going through these transition or these transitions it's bringing us it's a transforming power that is being placed by the life of God in us by the word of God it's it's him transforming us into an image of forever the image of the god that spoke back there and and trans you know went through transition all through those ages and is speaking here tonight it's to bring us into a transformation into the Sons and Daughters of God that he can manifest himself not just as the beginning of the creation of God but as the beginning Jesus Christ is the beginning he said I am the beginning I am the ending and it's a transition that has taken us to a transformation that when we receive Jesus Christ Christ he transforms us into the image of the god that spoke then is speaking now in the image that he saw us in Forever that's God's plan that's God's way uh I haven't listened to it for a while but uh Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said three-fold purpose and his purpose is say to manifest us as transformed Sons and Daughters of God that we are transformed to be able to step into eternity with him because just as the spirit that was in Christ was in the church there the spirit that was in Christ right now will take us to Christ that is forever just as they went through the same life cycle we go through the same life cycle because it didn't end with the resurrection no it ended if you want to say ended before it started the next phase it ended with what we would call a Rapture but you know it was the first Rapture that in the New Testament I believe it was or second I can't remember how but it was a Rapture he was caught up in into the cloud from the ground up Acts chapter 2 and so that he was transformed by what he went through in death life burial and Resurrection into the transforming power that took him up and that's where we're at tonight he is Transforming Our Hearts into the resurrected Jesus Christ that he can meet with us as he saw us before the foundation of the world Sons and Daughters of God so now we said that to actually I I mentioned in some ways it parallel Song of Solomon and I say that because he jumps back and forth he jumps back and forth between the the makeb believer or the unbeliever whatever it is and the Believers and and he jumps back and forth for and he said you're rich increased with goods and you don't you're wretched miserable poor blind and naked that doesn't apply to me applies to what's out there in the church world but what applies to me is to him that overcometh amen will I grant to sit with me in my Throne he is calling us calling us to that throne and when it says that you know to S but e but he says even as I also overcame how did he overcome if we know how he overcame we can overcome he overcame because there was a time after his birth and a portion of his life when there was a prophet on the scene called John the Baptist an eagle God Likens His prophets to Eagles and that eagle when he saw he was you know he was tearing it up man you scribes and Pharisees you bunch of snakes I mean he was tearing it up big time and and not a Fearless sore in the heavenlies but when he saw Jesus come down to the water his entire uh demeanor changed he turns and says Behold the Lamb of God the Lamb of God we've heard the token he said it's a lamb the nature of a lamb but when he talked about the Lamb of God you know they said how did you know and he said because I was told in the spirit when you see the dove the dove land on that one that's my my lamb the spirit of God is a dove it's gentle I made a mistake a while back I was thinking I was correcting somebody and they flew away and I realized David you shouldn't have done that because the dove has a nature you can't feed a dove Eagle food really it'll kill them Prophet said that we all think about oh we're Eagles and we're going to go into the fresh kill and eat all this no man when you're dealing with certain people and certain Hearts you got to treat him like a dove you'll kill them eag a dove can't eat that kind of carrying it'll kill them they have to have grains little grains and and when you throw them out there you got to stand back and watch just and when they pick it up they pick it up just kind of one at a time you don't you know go to the smorgus board and slide them down the deal and find out what's in their mouth when they get to the other end no the dove they eat pure grain pure seeds and Jesus said my word is a seed and the nature of the word is the Dove and the lamb helpless little lambs as it were without the spirit of the dove and if we just go to church and tear it up or we tear up our families or tear up our friends you know I I think we've seen different Church splits and things along the way and I and I've wondered sometimes what really happened well you go back and you list you know the the message tells us that you are what you eat you I've I've seen a a a deer once in southern Utah that had taken down an eagle I mean had taken down a deer and the eagle was sitting on the deer and he's just tearing it up eating the fresh kill beautiful sight didn't even I you know I drove up probably from here to Sister Jerry and sat there and watched him tearing it up and the other birds start coming there was some Hawks and some crows and you know different ones come and and there and he wouldn't let him get near it until he'd eaten his fill and then when he'd eaten his fill he just flew back sat on a a tree or stump something there and just watched the other birds eat the fresh kill friends if we eat or we serve Eagle food crows can eat it I know this is probably not what you expected to hear but it's true it's true and if we treat people like you know I got this bunch of meat man and I'm going to jam it down your throat you might want to step back and think about what you're doing because if they're a dove you can't even get too close I I had actually it was over near the airport just a couple weeks ago there was two there was a mother Dove and two babies two baby doves and I guess you'd been teaching him to fly and those two little doves they held so close together and they actually let me get probably from here to that violin away from him and I was afraid to get any closer because the mother was standing back a little further watching me and I backed away slowly they never moved because they don't have the same nature as a crow they don't have the same nature as even an eagle and when we read there in the Song of Solomon and so as we we as you're going through that look how he jumps back and forth in Revelations we'll go back to the song Salon here in just a minute he jumps back and forth and I love there also where he says as many as I love I rebuke and chasten but how does that chastening come I remember it's been a few years ago I was listening to a certain tape and brother brandom he he said that uh you know he said boy did you you hear that rebuke that I wasn't the word wasn't severe or that but it was you know like a very strong rebuke to that person last night huh I went back and listened to it friend it was almost like nothing but he called it a a strong rebuke he was dealing with a dove he was dealing with the holy spirit that was dealing with that Dove it didn't have to be just tear it up and beat him up and jam it down somebody's throat live the life let the transforming power power of Jesus Christ becomes so much a part of us he said he loves us and then he you know I stand at the door and knock and in verse 20 there he said as many as hear my voice what voice is calling the bride now there was a transition where we came through the eagle age that that presenting of the eagle and it's good food don't get me wrong it's amazing what God did through the voice of that eagle but it when when it comes to the calling out of the Bride he said as many as hear my voice and I wrote down because it's basically the same word that we hear in uh clear back at the beginning In the Garden of Eden it has you know a slightly different twinge to it I suppose in the Greek than it did in the Hebrew but in Genesis 3 and 8 when it talks about the voice it says it's the sound of an instrument oh it was so beautiful tonight the sounds of the instruments then it says it was a noise it was a calling a voice calling aloud when it said we heard the voice voice of God in the garden and we were afraid so he we're talking about the voice and it said inside of that voice I'm just reading the meanings there was a bleeting what bleats sheep friends thank you brother that's true a bleeding a crackling a cry a lo as the cattle or as the sheep in the fields and they're eating gently of the grasses and of the but then you know running it into as it were into the church ages there was a thunder in the voice brother you're familiar we're supposed to know about the seven Thunders because they're all wrapped up in the voice and there's a lightheartedness another actually the word that used next was frivolous or frivolity how there's a joy in the voice a joy that should be in our hearts a joy that we can that we've heard the voice I've heard the voice and and I'm I'm happy and sometimes lighthearted because there's there's light in it the light from there it it pushes back the darkness it pushes back you know all the things all of that transition stuff that the world is is the You Know Rich increased all that stuff it's pushing it back and we should be lighthearted and and happy I'm happy he brought me to his to his banqueting table it says in in the Song of Solomon and His Banner Over Me was love it's love I you know I kind of hate to say this but I I remember Deborah and I we were talking about it one time and how that you know people said we were worthless people when they're about to get married and they're in love they're worthless man you can't get a word in It's Like H let them go they'll get over it someday you're all laughing because you know it's true and that's how it is with Jesus Christ we should be happy there is a joy there is something about falling in love about getting to know each other and getting to know our relationship and our place as it were in that relationship and I and how that there there's a song I heard recently it said that you know where two hearts become one our hearts should beat as one with Jesus Christ because it says that you know as many as hear the voice or understand the voice do we truly understand the voice because that voice now we can go back to Song of Solomon that voice hm my beloved is like a row I'm on in in verse n well I'll start at eight the voice of my beloved behold he comes leaping upon the mountains skipping upon the hills my beloved is like a row which is like a deer or say you says or a young heart behold he stands behind our wall he looks forth at the windows showing himself through the lattice do you know what that word lattice is oh there is so much in there that maybe God will allow us to preach sometime on the lattice but we think of it as you know when people have the garden and they have the The Vines going up and they have that thing that's you know they put it there by the door and to look through it you never get the whole picture at one time you get it from this Square this Square this square and it says he shows himself through the lattice line upon line preach precept upon precept and showing himself and they'll put the Roses on those lattice or sometimes grapes different things but he looks forth at the windows and he shows himself through the lattice we're talking hear about the the voice of my beloved the voice comes in little pieces and it's the voice of the dove because it continues my beloved SP uh my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away what's the call to the Bride of Jesus Christ it's the voice of God showing himself and like I said that word lattice oh man there's a whole there's a mathematical lattice that they talk about there's a chemical lattice and they all relate actually B back to little pieces coming together from what I understand it some of it's way over my head so don't quote me on that CU I'm going wow there's a lattice of I think light and there's a lattice of this and that and it's things being broken into pieces that give us a picture of the whole by the pieces I hope I'm saying that right but and I'll go ahead and read down down a few more verses because I love it it says for Lo the winter is passed the rain is over the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of the birds is come the voice of the turtle is heard in our land I questioned over that the turtle I've never heard a turtle speak but in Spanish it's aan I think it's like Avan so it's the turtle dove the flowers appear on the word it's the springtime when did was the the message it is the rising of the sun preached it was preached in the spring and he's saying the flowers are appearing the time of the singing of the birds and the voice of the turtle dove is heard in our land the kingdom of God is within USL and the turtle dove is heard in our land in our portion of the scripture the dove is to be living in our hearts and that voice should be heard he says and the Fig Tree puts forth her green figs and the vines with their tender grape and they give a good smell Arise My Love My Fair one and come away that's not what we would think of is like strong meat it's just a call from a voice from the voice of my beloved who it says in another place his voice is like a dove well of course because that's what landed on the lamb and even when he rebuked and chastised and did those things you know he brw his vipers and that kind of stuff it was still done with the attitude and with the the nature of the Lamb Arise My Fair one and come away and then he continues in verse 14 oh my oh my Dove that are in the Cliffs of the rocks and the secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice now he's this time he's talking to the the bride the dove the king the one with the banners is that right skipping upon the hills the Banners at the banqueting table there is joy joy unspeakable in the spirit of the dove oh my Dove thou that art in the cfts of the rock the secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance he wants to see what our countenance is or the countenance is actually the spirit that is you know exuded from around around us we used to you know there's there's people and even you can actually train yourself under certain condition I conditions through meditation to see the countenance on people before I had even met the Lord we used to we they call it you know in the I believe it's the uh religion of East India they call it the aura and I had been uh meditating with some friends we went to a certain uh event a singing event when I was in college and I'd not even I don't think I'd even met the the Lord yet as far as I know and as we sat there and the lighting was just right I was telling them now look at I looked at a certain man came in and he had a certain Aura around him large yellow or amber colored and you could tell man he was so energetic and so happy was a teacher I knew the man well and as he stood there against the wall and I said look look out about from his body maybe this you know about so far out out and you can see where his Aura is and there was like two or three other kids and two of them weren't familiar with anything like that and they weren't we can see it and there was a young woman there that I knew pretty well that was a lot into meditation and as we sat there and we got into the music that was going on that was a folk concert another man came in and as I looked at him he had a tiny or a kind of a blue or a blue green color and you could tell he was I think he was a smoker and maybe an alcoholic and when he got close to that teacher he literally you could see it with natural eyes he sucked part of that aura off that onto his until when he left he was feeling pretty good and the other and the teacher that I knew was like wore out you ever get around down town you come home and you're just flat wor out it's because they've sucked the energy right out of you I'm not making this up they'll suck that energy right out of you and that's why we have to stay as it we're prayed up all the time so we keep you know so we're we're plugged in and I'm not talking about into these things we're plugged in into Jesus Christ the word because it says all power of Heaven and Earth was his and it's given unto us to use and he said let me see your countenance he's talking bride little doves little Dove oh oh my Dove you're hiding in the cust of the who's the rock come on yeah you understand this is all about Jesus Christ every bit of it we're hidden in the Rock Christ Jesus we're in the CFT of the rock we're hiding in the secret places of the stairs stairs go up stairs go down and he says let me see your countenance let me take a look at your spirit create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit in me regardless of what you did today or what you'll do tomorrow and how much condemnation the devil tries to put you on you I believe it's in first John it says no matter if you if your hearts condemn us said I'm greater than your heart the dove of God is greater than the condemnation in our hearts and all we have to do is go back and look at I guess I can say papa dove and feel the connection if I use those two big words copul accumulative in other words the close relationship accumulates into eternity and he says and let me hear your voice let me hear thy voice our husband Jesus Christ the dove that's calling us come up here come up come up the Winter's passed arise rise up my love my fair one come away it's not a pounding it's a gentle call arise and come away my fair one and when he speaks about her he said for sweet is your voice bet you weren't expecting this were you neither was I but he says Arise My Fair one and come away and he wants to hear the voice and he says for thy countenance is comely or in other words it's it's soft it's remember when it talked about Jesus it said he had nothing that people would desire of him as a man he was a small man he he he wasn't like Saul or you know like a big Warrior coming out booming and and screaming at people no he spoke in a boat on the Sea of Galilee and yet they heard his voice 3,000 people on a bank he says for sweet is your voice your voice to Jesus Christ is sweet and if you go you know back since we mentioned Genesis I'll mention it once more he said when he talked to Adam after the fall and you know first he curses the serpent then he he doesn't curse Eve he just curses the child birth says you're going to have trouble with that now think about it sisters it's hard because of what happened there with the adultery in the garden he says you're going to struggle with that and when he talks to Adam then the thir you know and he begins he he curses there too but he never cursed Adam he couldn't because he was a Son of God Bible talks about the first Adam in the the second Adam the second Adam is a lifegiving spirit and he never cursed Adam but he cursed the ground but and then he gave the reason I love this because it's talking about Adam being like Jesus Christ we've heard the message and how that he said he Adam could not leave Eve in that position she had no way back her only way back was through Adam because that's where she came from our only way back is through Christ because that's who where we came from and he would not leave us just as Adam would not leave Eve and he said Adam because you listened to the voice of your wife I don't know know what she said I don't know how she said it there's no scripture that tells us but her voice was enough that Adam took her and brought her under his protection he brought her from a lost position from a position of Eternal separation from God into his tent as we would say it and he placed his natural seed into her that brought forth CH a child and when we when when we call to God as we cry out to God it's it's our voice that he hears it's a sweet voice he said let me hear your voice he just wants to hear our voice because it was the voice of Eve that called to Adam that Adam said come hither come unto me and when he gave her of his seed she brought forth a son able and when we give our when we call out to God he gives us the seed he said my word is a seed take it my y is easy my burden is light take the seed because in my seed is life I am the light of the world I am the resurrection and the life I am that I am and he displays himself to his bride as a dove oh my I'm beginning to believe I've been looking at things backwards for a long time God let me have the voice of the dove let me have that voice that moves God in the sweetness and that my renew a right spirit that my countenance is such that he he says to me let me hear your voice David Trevor whoever you are give him your voice let Bible says that in the out of the mouth is what the heart speaks and when we speak to him let our hearts say here am I Lord what would you have me to do Lord just let me hear that come up hither come into your presence once again God take me into your presence take me into your life and let our hearts beat as one let the yesterday and to today become forever together God let me hear your voice as the dove I don't need cow fu food I don't you know and the food of the eagle like I said it's wonderful but let it produce the dove because he in US is the Dove and that's the nature that he looks forth looks for in us because he's calling as a dove behold Thou Art Fair now I'm back in chapter 1 Thou Art Fair my love behold Thou Art Fair wow we didn't get to the first couple of verses there did we well maybe another time he's the rose of Shar and the lily of the valleys the Lily among the Thorns so is my love among the daughters we know that's all talking about Jesus Christ every word of it is talking about Jesus Jesus Christ The Lily among the Thorns the Lily has to be crushed to get the medicine out of it and it was there being crushed amidst the crown of thorns the lily of the valley the rose of Sharon Sharon actually is it's called for what it is because it's the flat place and the flat place when you think about it talks about John the Baptist and he said you know the mountains are coming down the valleys come up what's it talking about a flat place but the flat place is there to produce the rose the rose of Sharon which from the seed not I mean there's probably medicinal Pro properties in the whole row they're finding out many other PLS is that way but in the seeds in the little they call them rose hips what's there we think think of it as vitamin C and they've proven now that it gives us immunity to a lot of diseases and if you get the disease it makes you well faster and the rose grows out of the flat place from the message came the rose Jesus Christ shall we stand you know that song consume me sister could we sing that I love that song Praise the Lord I I hope this is something that will help you in your Christian walk I it's helped me and is helping me because

it was that had value they'll put it all back together with gold and their thought is because now it's far more Val valuable because the gold gives it more value but to them the real value is the
