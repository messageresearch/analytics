wanted me to sing and then he laid this one on my heart and sometimes the lord does things backwards from what we think we think it would be current events would point you to a song and then you'd be led to sing that song it said i was led to sing a song and then i was pointed at this song and then i realized how fitting it is for today so trust the lord bless you and we didn't practice so you

one of my favorite songs of the 2341 that i know [Laughter] thanks brother chris as we get ready to turn the service to brother paul let's sing number 633 can't be flat many things about tomorrow i don't seem to understand do you know who holds your hand you say amen let's sing this as we get ready to trainers and service i don't know about timor i just live from [Music] sunshine [Music] and today i walk beside him is ahead oh many things about tomorrow i don't think to understand oh but i know and i know who holds my hand i don't know about tomorrow it may bring [Music] [Music] is [Music] what his blood oh many things about tomorrow high don't see to understand nobody [Music] knows and i know he holds my hand many things [Music] to understand and i know [Music] aren't you glad you can say amen to that hallelujah you know we're not going to talk about politics tonight but you know they they have a president has a state of the union speech everywhere i mean every year and and uh you know you can go back and uh if you'll just listen to the prophet you'll see that he gave us a state of our nation many years ago you know what holds tomorrow one crooked political office or another crooked political office that's what might tomorrow but i know who holds my tomorrow and i know who is the king amen that was good brother chris thank you i was a little excited i know it didn't show this body's weary but my heart was like yes there's none greater than our god hallelujah he is the king of kings the lord of lords amen and nothing greater than him and that makes me excited hallelujah because otherwise we would all run to the bank and we would take what little cash we had we would bury it in a little ball canning jar in the backyard and we would try to figure out what's going to happen should i buy gold no don't buy gold the chinese are buying gold they're going to use it against us should we buy paper no the prophet of god said the time would come that the paper would fail oh my what are we going to buy let's buy dirt wait if you don't have money to pay the taxes they take the dirt away from you oh the list goes on and on but we can find security hallelujah aren't you glad we can find security we can find peace we can find confidence the prophet of god said where do we find that saints in the word which is jesus christ amen let's just stand as we go into the word i want to speak to you on preparations of the inner man when that which is made perfect now i take this from the scripture and i'm going to use this uh title in a slightly different way tonight just to draw your attention to some thoughts amen now remember jesus said that when he come he did not come to do away with the law that is the old testament but he come to magnify it to us now if you ever really want to see what something really is you must magnify it amen i've got a friend that's a good mechanic and he uses all kinds of tricks of the trade and he will take a mirror and he will put it down in something to see what he's doing then he will point his iphone at that and then because he's a little older he puts his magnifying glass on top of that and then he can tell you yep without ever pulling a bolt yep there's the problem you see to magnify that it doesn't matter that there's an image if you can't see it it doesn't matter that there's solution if you can't see it it doesn't matter if you have a fault if you can't see it amen seems like kind of a paradox to bring it that way right but the scripture says every man's right in his own eyes so help us lord reveal our faults our flaws and then have courage enough amen let's not be ashamed i was just talking to my father-in-law right before church brother kevin and we were having a lovely conversation you see the problem that happens many times saints is we're actually too proud for everyone to see us fail we will hide our weakness our failures our shortcomings will we'll do everything we can to hide that so that we wouldn't be ashamed in front of those we know of our weakness you see that's quite the opposite of what it should be we should have such liberty of who we are in jesus christ now you don't have to share every detail but we don't have to try and camouflage it amen my dad used to tell me you know we spent many many years uh you know raising hogs and my dad used to say son i don't care how much lipstick you put on that pig it's still a pig and so you know let's not bother to hide that but when that which is made perfect the scripture says has come let's turn into psalms 18 16 amen i i hope tonight this is a encouraging service for you uh we'll speak direct amen what i didn't realize when i caught coven was that i also caught a a uh blunt virus and uh so in that blunt virus it just everything just comes out amen so pray for me amen psalms 18 starting with verse 16. he sent from above he took me and he drew me out of many waters now we know what waters stands for right he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them which hated me for they were too strong for me they prevented me in the day of my calamity but the lord was my stay he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me oh i love these words when i read this it just stirred my heart because he delighted in me oh my brother and sister we're not just some object right object that god said i want to possess that god doesn't have a hoarding problem right he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness now we'll i'll just keep going amen according to the cleanliness of my hands hath he recompensed me for i have kept the ways of the lord and have not wickedly departed from my god for all his judgments were before me and i did not put away his statutes from me i was also upright before him and i kept myself from mine iniquity therefore hath the lord recompense me according to my righteousness according to the cleanliness of my hands with the merciful thou will show thyself merciful with an upright man that will show thyself upright with the pure thou sh wilt show thyself pure and with the froward thou wilt show thyself forward for thou wilt save the afflicted people but will bring down high looks for thou will light my candle the lord my god will enlighten my darkness for by thee i have run through a troop and by my god have i leaped over a wall i i'm sorry i'm just excited my heart just bubbling hallelujah amen people say well okay what's going on with this guy well let me tell you my candle's been lit the darkness has been pushed back i ran right through the middle of the troop amen i've leaped over the wall hallelujah that ought to be enough to get any son or daughter of god excited as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is tried is a buckler to all those that trust in him it is god that girdeth me with strength and maketh my way perfect heavenly father we thank you for your word tonight just ask your father lead us through your word father we just desire to bring forth your word exactly lord in the way that you meant it not guessing father not surmising but lord we ask for your anointing to speak tonight your precious name we pray amen god bless you you may be seated hallelujah just remember those i don't care who or what circumstance those that are not with us tonight just lift them up in prayer amen now saints when we look at perfection often times it seems to be one of the greatest struggles is that if we uh are uh i've been doing a lot of studying uh in uh the intellectual way amen i've been looking at that uh what brother branham said about things about knowledge and uh intellectual and uh you know my brother and sister uh god give us and i thank the lord for that now not all of our iqs are equal to each other that's wonderful also god needs a diversity but god has given us an ability to take our bible to take the message uh take concordances and to map it out you might say so in an intellectual fashion we can see what the whole purpose is we can see why god did what he did we can follow all the chain of events and we can put that all together but my brother and sister without revelation it will never spark the soul to rapturing faith and so it's there that we look at this and now we don't focus entirely as it were just revelation revelation revelation but i will remind you i know you all know this but i will remind you that the prophet of god told you to pray for revelation so that was no small thing i believe when he encouraged us to uh uh take time out of our lives right to to all the needs that we have all the praise that we would have uh and he says you know i want you to pray for revelation and uh knowing that this is actually not revelation of the intellectual but this is revelation of the mystery of god which is christ in you and and so as we uh are are moved you might say by the word of god by the holy spirit we move forward into this revelation now this revelation will never produce a heady or high-minded people it will never produce a people who believe they are better in fact i i just kind of get ahead of myself but you will find my brother and sister that one of the greatest mysteries that is being revealed in the bride of christ today is the mystery that she recognizes that she without him is nothing and so in that what it is is creating a dependent people now in a world we live in today where everyone is striving to be independent it goes counter intuitive to the age or the spirit of the age that we live in but the holy spirit when it has preeminence in our lives that my brother and sister is when the mystery of god will be revealed in you and i amen so it is uh a beautiful thing uh we're not going to preach necessarily down that line tonight but uh you must understand that the fulfillment of this mystery is not whether you can explain the bible whether you can explain the message but whether you have given yourself to christ and he has possessed you as his portion amen now every husband every wife amen the word of god says that a man is not in control of his own body a woman's not control of her own body and the scripture says thus it is with christ and the church that we would come and as a body tonight i i hope you are with me as a body tonight we must be surrendered to our lord jesus christ amen now you look at this and often times we look at perfection i've heard many preachers preach perfection in different ways i've heard them preach that we will never be perfect they do put the quantifier of in this flesh but my brother and sister you see what is happening in sons and daughters of god are being moved by the holy spirit and we will not as it were conquer this flesh but we are no longer subject to this flesh now did you catch what i just said we will not conquer this flesh we will have things in his flesh to the day that we're either raptured or we go into the ground but my brother and sister we are no longer controlled by those things amen and so by god's grace now the prophet of god says you know that we come and by the holy ghost we conquer those things and they are taken and put to the back and our life can then shine forth for the glory of god now it took perfection to bring us forth perfect so perfection is already present amen it's present here tonight amen to bring us forth in perfection amen and you know you say but brother paul we have a lot of mistakes we have a lot of flaws we have a lot of things but my brother and sister i want you to also go into that and realize that when something is perfect it is completely correct or accurate so when you have the holy ghost amen you are then being moved out of uh the position that we are just flash that we are weak we are broken which is the religious spirit of the day that we live in is now basically declaring we're all broken and that's why i behave like i behave because i'm broken but my brother and sister the holy ghost comes and is moving a bride moving a people into a position where while the flesh is still here in the flesh is flesh yes well we can give all of our disclaimers but my brother and sister there is a people that the word of god is coming correct or accurate to them can we say amen to that i i push back kind of sometimes when we hear that deal well you know brother brown said better to have the rights uh spirit and the wrong doctrine than the right doctrine in the wrong spirit now i won't argue at all but i believe we're coming into a time that the holy ghost is coming down on a people and they will have both amen they will have the right spirit and they will have the right doctrine amen so as we'll look at this also it's having all the qualities you would want in that kind of a person there's where we're going to focus tonight the qualities one of the greatest qualities believe it or not now you might read it and come up with a different conclusion i won't argue with you but one of the greatest qualities the prophet of god laid out in this bride is that she would be able to say amen to every word of god you can't have a bride who constantly disagrees with her husband and have harmony hear me sisters i said constantly disagrees so nobody misunderstand but you see what the word is doing is bringing forth equality out of a people who maybe didn't even know god never went to church i i just talked to a man the other day he's married to a lovely lady she grew up never went church doesn't know what church is it's just foreign most of us that's foreign right we've been in church so much sometimes we've been in church so much that we actually come to the place we don't really respect the house of god like we should we have little things we can so to speak have a meltdown or a tantrum or this or that and the behaviors and and uh uh you know it it it can become just common to us but you see this word is coming and it's bringing out of a people equality now i didn't bring all the quotes that i studied uh i probably should have but uh you know probably shouldn't have and so but you look at this my brother and sister i want you to focus tonight just for a moment on that quality of what is in you that causes you to come back and say amen or so be it to all of the word of god you know it has to hurt sometimes it's not always comfortable when we look in the mirror we see our flesh we look in the word we see the spirit man see that's what the word is actually trying to do my brother and sister because if we look in the word and all we see is our flesh man we say sorry but we go out like the worshiper who offers the lamb and then has a whole year of his old fleshly behavior before he must come and deal with it again god isn't trying to bring this flesh subject god is bringing the spirit subject and when the spirit is then subject to the word the spirit then will bring the flesh subject but if we turn that around we can have a bunch of people who conform until they don't conform any longer amen so i think we would agree tonight that we struggle to in our human outlook to see perfection amen those of you didn't say amen i'll say amen for you now as we look here in matthew 5 48 he says be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect now god would not make that kind of request out of you and i unless he had already provided the way for us to be perfect amen he's not going to leave us out here a frustrated people always longing for something that might bring us to this state and sooner or later our own reasoning and emotion and strength will say not possible therefore i will not try so god has created a a pathway for us to be perfect just as our father is perfect and so whenever life gets difficult when we get into the midst of the battle we might be down in the bottom of the valley my brother and sister and it seems like that you have made mistake after a mistake i want you to come back and look at this word and remember that god has already provided the way for you and i to be perfect amen for you and i to be of the quality of character amen to have the qualities that he would want in this kind of person which is the bride amen so he's looking for a bride now we a couple sundays ago were reading and he is talking about uh michelangelo the statue of moses and how that that chip even though not replaced is still a part of that and how that we taken from christ will always be a part of him now my brother and sister they don't have any museum for the chip from the knee of moses because the prophet of god said that flaw is what made that a masterpiece it was that inspiration that come and brought that made it the masterpiece so as god is working on you and i my brother and sister he is bringing us to a place as we have been taken from him my brother and sister that we would not be perfect without him he would not be perfect in that sense without us do you understand what i'm saying so never look at this as something that is insurmountable this should never be preached as something that would be like you guys are not perfect you're not good enough but look at this as knowing that god has already provided a way for you to be perfect seems how he asks you to be now as we look at this something that insurmountable my brother and sister very few will try something that seems like it is unconquerable uh have no ability to do many times i remember reading a story these young men it's not uh listed into the books like uh everest and and mckinley and some of these other famous mountains but uh in south america there was a rock that was there in the andes and it basically was just a sheer pinnacle of rock and uh there's nothing there there's no talus there's no slopes there's no draws and in many portions of it no cracks even and these two young men said you know what nobody's ever climbed that it's not listed amongst the great mountains of the world but it is something that was viewed as insurmountable and they were convinced they free climbed it on their first attempt up into an area and that they saw uh what did that i never pronounced it right pittance batons you know the things they drive in the rock if i'm mispronouncing it and they're scattered all over the face of this but you see my brother and sister you never trust another man's revelation you never hang your life on another man's revelation and so as they were there on the mountain that they got to that point they realized how difficult it was going to be to climb it was face to face but you see it's interesting in the mountaineering world a true mountaineer knowing that he would not trust someone else's deal unless put in by someone he trusted they then quit trying to climb it and they started removing all of these previously installed revelations you see that's one of the most difficult things my brother and sister is for us to stop and take the time to remove everything out of our life oftentimes it's our human nature to say okay and move on but these men knew that someday somebody would try to climb that and they would trust one of those and they would die because it was not anchored correctly in the rock are you with me tonight so they take all this time and remove them and not to to focus on that but ultimately they climb this all the way to the top and and they make that and then the one man when he looked over he said i actually felt fear for the first time in my life because he remembered how tiny the hand holds in the footholds were you see my brother and sister sometimes we just never been meant to go back down the way we came up god wants us to just keep climbing keep climbing higher and higher not trusting what someone else says not looking to everyone else not that this is insurmountable ultimately after them because it's the nature of man others climbed it because kind of that if they can do it i can do it too but you see this perfection is not insurmountable we have the book we have this pattern that clearly shows us how to accomplish it my brother and sister sometimes i think we don't spend enough time looking at the pattern you imagine if brother paul was sewing dresses for you sisters my oh my i've never been one i i could probably hold that pattern down this would be brother paul's approach i can just i don't need to pin this pattern down i can just hold it down and i'll cut around it and you sisters would show up in church and you'd have a caller up by one ear and the other collar would be on your collarbone one sleeve would be longer than the other wait you wouldn't show up in that would you but you see sometimes a convoluted word of god would be dressing the bride of christ in such a nature because we never i hope you get this because we never pinned the word down are you with me are you understanding it's the pattern of our life it's a pattern of who we are amen it should not be willy-nilly that we're going to just go this way and we're going to go that way and we're going to do this my brother and sister the prophet of god he showed us very clearly everything going back to the word we need to pin it down we need to and if it doesn't fit in the pattern my brother and sister don't go cutting your life out to fit that amen unless the word is there amen let me just clarify that i kind of my brain just jumped a thought jump to cog when you come to the word my brother and sister you follow that pattern perfectly but when you come to something that doesn't fit the pattern of the word don't try and modify that pattern to fit go back to the original pattern go back to what the word of god is amen we have the book and the pattern is this and you know what's so beautiful my brother and sister while i look in here now my name is actually as far as paul goes is in the book but you understand what i'm saying i look in here and i can't read my name as it were directly and the prophet of god says you know maybe our name that's in that book isn't our earthly name but it doesn't matter because god knows where to find you amen and while we identify with our earthly name god knows who you are and the fact is is we can look in the book and see by the nature of what god is calling you and i to be we can recognize our name is in that book amen not just the book meaning the bible but the book of life or lamb's book of life because what is in there the pattern of that has come out by revelation and is now creating a bride after the image of the perfect one amen because she must be able as it were to sidle right up to him to be perfectly part of him no conflict no no obstruction and so she has been malmolded by the word amen now look my brother and sister this is a little tough sometimes we struggle with this i look at it sometimes you meet the nicest of people you meet people that are just good solid christian behavior but my brother and sister you recognize that you won't go in the rapture and i'm gonna make this real broad so we're not saying we are and nobody else is you won't go in the rapture unless you are a perfect fit to the word that was there recorded in the lamb's book of life now you realize that word oh this'll stumble some was you and i see that's what's recorded in the lamb's book of life amen but it was the word that was recorded in the book amen so what was it god already looking down through time and eternity he didn't look at you as a blob of humanity he looked at you as the word made manifest in flesh in this generation amen he was looking at the word with arms and legs and feet and a voice and a mind and a soul amen and he says there's my word he didn't say there's a human and i'll try to save them he said that's my word and they are recorded in the lamb's book of life i wrote their name down of who they are now the prophet of god said you'll be surprised who's there and who's not so let's never be judgmental what we should do is be sincere and say lord wash me make my faults and failures known to me lord that i might repent of them don't let me just say well everything's well all is well we should have a degree my brother and sister of peace of who we are amen right we should find comfort in who we are according to the word but never let yourself become complacent never come to the place i believe it's settled i don't need to do anything let your heart be just stirred enough that you continually come back to the throne of grace and say lord if there's anything lord help me forgive me lord anything that would hinder anything lord that would keep you from moving freely and you see i'm trying tonight not trying it's my intention tonight to preach this optimistically because you see this is what the book says will come forth in this generation my brother and sister the word is producing it the word is producing exactly what the word said it would produce in this generation and i can say thank you lord hallelujah hallelujah amen the names in the book and we've been encouraged by the prophet to declare that my name is in the book right he told us to read our name into the bible hallelujah and when i get to the sides of the pit i don't see any anointing to say i must be there also but when i see they're talking about standing before the throne of almighty god something inside of me something starts bubbling up something starts reaching out something starts claiming oh what is that that's anointing off of that perfect word that recorded you and i in the book now james um just second i might be just second hold up everyone yeah no let's go back lord grace lord grace okay i'm sorry about that brother alex there you are for the worship coming every year was a continual about every year went back and you had to come the next year the same desire in his heart my brother and sister i'm going to look real blunt i'm not going to say much true revelation causes us to do something absolutely we cannot just sit down when the true word has been revealed that's right in influences brother branham talks about several different examples he talks about peter he talks about the woman at the well that when they caught who he was it put them into action something had to happen there was not a complacency but you see my brother and sister i would dare to say politely that we come back the next year we have the same desire in our hearts many of us have went from year to year without deliverance now look i'm i'm really honestly mean this from my heart tonight it isn't always your fault sin in the church prophet of god shows us sometimes sin in the church binds the spirit of god moving sometimes it's not the right season we'll touch on that a little bit later concerning samson god's got a plan god knows what's happening but you see my brother and sister don't read this as somebody else we can read this as us but when he made one sacrifice by himself every sin every desire of sin everything was taken from the man's heart and he stands perfected in the sight of god not by what he done see all of those offerings all of those sacrifices all of those i'm sorry lord didn't take away the desire you see now the reason i'm bringing let me just go on let me go on and he stands perfected in the sight of god not by what he'd done but what jesus done for him and he accepted the sacrifice of the lord jesus christ oh what a marvelous things friends amen now my brother and sister the reason i put this quote here and i want to expound on it for just a moment is you see when we catch this revelation that it is not what we done amen but what he done when we can start to look into the word and realize that it was by his desire to us amen he found pleasure in you and i you know what it's like when you have those that you just you know if you sit down and it's not a big deal we as humans get offended by such but you know there just be someone that you just you know maybe a couple that you want to sit down maybe just a wife or a friend and you just really enjoy that company and so if someone says you know if you was gonna just sit on the deck and watch the sunset who would you put here and and if you say you know your best friend your wife will be offended but do you understand what it's like to really desire to have fellowship with someone amen i mean from the heart yearning fellowship you see what happens when we realize that the only way we'll ever ever ever fulfill this is that deep deep deep relationship with our lord amen nothing shallow you know here a sunday or two ago i was talking about using for an example a husband and a wife in a relationship the wife will never get what she wants by putting her husband off at arm's reach or even beyond that but if she really wants to get the most out of her husband in the sense of maybe uh uh i'm digging a hole you understand what i'm saying what does she do now i'm not talking about a wife that's a gold digger i'm talking in a spiritual principle here what does she do when she wants something you reel your husband in you get just as close to him as you can see that's where the real difference is made not in the distance between them amen you know i had a friend one time he says well you know they say absence makes the heart grow fonder he said looking in my wife's eyes every night is what makes me fond and i thought it was pretty cute because he's got a really sweet wife amen lovely lovely lovely believers but look at this my brother and sister how it is now we're looking at what he has done and so we stand perfected in the sight of god not by what we have done but what he has done and that's really to sum that down that's why i brought that out amen now let's look at james 7 1 17 every good gift and every perfect gift is from above cometh down from the father of life who in whom there is no variableness neither shadow of turning thank you lord of his own will he begot he us with the word of truth amen oh look at this my brother and sister look at this of his own will he come down to a barber shop he come down to uh you know wherever it is of his own will god was not under no obligation my brother and sister it was his own will that he come down made a claim and put your name on that book oh hallelujah i i get excited to think about that my brother and sister how many people they are on the on the face of the earth how many are here in america and god says you know i'm choosing you of his own will be got he us with the word of truth not just any old word that we should be kind of first fruits oh this is just you know some of this we all know it we've heard it preached but i it makes me excited to hear it again and again my brother and sister the law of the first fruits is so incredible because it took perfection to make us perfect amen the law of the first fruit says that perfection those who follow will be of the same amen wherefore my beloved brother and let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god you know that that can be an issue we all get upset over something sometime we don't want to be you know pharisees about this but my brother and sister when someone's been in the word of god for many years and they have a light switch for a temper something's missing this cannot bring about the righteousness of god wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness receive the meekness of the engrafted word which is able to save your souls but be doers of the word not hearers only deceiving your own selves you see my brother and sister the word of god and i'm not trying to circumvent the word of god but the word of god says that they would come and they would be men that would deceive the very elect if it was possible did you realize my brother and sister that those men are not deceiving you they are taking the deceptive word but they don't force it down your throat they're laying the deceptive word on the dinner table for you to partake of of your own free will people are like i'm so afraid of being deceived get in the word i don't care what deceptive word they lay on the dinner table if you're filled with the holy ghost you're going to look at that and say sorry that doesn't wet my appetite come on i'm not trying to twist the word don't misunderstand me but you see people will deceive themselves because there must be something in you my brother and sister let me just put it this way to you if you are one that has to see wmb on everything that you read before you believe it there's something wrong because the word of god rings true this is the prophet's words you can study it i'm i'm not trying to drag something out out of the dark there's something inside of the bride of christ which a prophet of god said which is the word which is christ himself is down in the believer and when he hears the word there's something in him that says amen to that word but we got a syndrome in the world today that unless whatever you said they've got a message a quote number page number a paragraph number they can't say amen to it what is it an intellectual conception it's not oh i'm not speaking down on them i'm not honestly please trust me but you see my brother and sister there's got to be a word that is inside of you to respond to the word that is coming and the prophet of god tied that together a deep calleth to the deep there must be something there he said to respond oh come on you see the problem is is people have got to the point they're intellectually looking at the message and you say something or you preach something i want to quote for that where's the holy ghost that's stirring you where's your knowledge i i won't mention the brother's name i got to break these habits but my brother and sister i know a brother and i appreciate his ministry and he stands right there and tells you if you think i'm going to tell you while i'm preaching and now brother bryan said this brother brown said that you're just out of luck you need to be studying the message enough to know that i'm telling you the truth hallelujah i stand with that he's direct on that you should know whether i'm telling you the truth wait now look we've got go ahead i'll just give you this for free i don't care how much poisoned food they put on the table in front of you the holy ghost in you will keep you from that that's right hallelujah oh my so we want to be a hearer of the word for if any be a hearer of the word not a doer he's lacking a man beholding his natural face in the glass see i think we got to get away from any spirit that leaves people terrified they're going to be deceived the holy ghost in you will bring you to the truth hallelujah my i'm slower than slow seven year itch kind of thingy amen okay let's just go on brothers now let's go here abraham's covenant i want to try and hurry be out a decent time here now if you notice in the zodiac what's the first figure in the zodiac it's the virgin what's the last figure in the zodiac leo the lion the first coming and the second coming of christ he came first by the virgin comes next the lion of the tribe of judah then the cross fishes cancer age that we're now in just before that time takes place now i want to just throw something in here right now my brother and sister we don't know what direction our nation's going uh but we do i don't know what tomorrow i don't know if it'll rain or it'll be as warm as they say it is or this or that happen but just a second i can go back to vindicated words that says this nation is corrupt in 1956 they rejected jesus christ and brother branham says there's nothing left for this nation but judgment but if we get trump it'll all be better no sir it might be better but my brother and sister we also know by the word of god that everything has an appointed time there's a time and a season for everything and i don't care who sits in that office whatever direction that is i don't care who sits in that office when the season comes when that old dragon rares head it won't matter who's your senator who's your president you see my brother and sister what we got to do is go to revelations 19 7 8 9 and get ready we don't need to look at the politics we don't get round up who's doing this and what and what's the deficit no the prophet of god already warned you this nation is bankrupt long ago amen and the word of god tells us that whatever is done in secret must be made open so we're going to see way more corruption we're going to see i don't care who the president is you're going to see way more corruption you're going to see all of this stuff boiling over my brother and sister because the word says so amen crossface cancer age we're now just before time takes place we watch the pyramid it's built like this but you notice the headstone was never put on the pyramid did you ever think of that you got a dollar bill in your pocket look what it says the great seal the pyramid and look above it the stone the headstone was never found why the headstone was rejected christ look down here in the age of luther justification plenty of room here follow this don't just read the words plenty of room the pyramid down here with luther plenty of room luther smoked a cigar and drank beer well praise the lord if luther did it i can do it follow the pyramid just to confess christ meant to have your head chopped off and when they come out of paganism to have your head well you'd be executed for the very witness of saying you was a christian luther then what did it do it heaps up now to the minority coming down closer what is next sanctification then he was called a fanatic a holy roller or something that's wesley's age what happened next then come the pentecostal baptism of the holy ghost still the church got smaller now look at this my brother and sister the age of the the domination you might say of christianity is actually fading research says that uh uh people they say well our children are all going away wait we're the adults they're out there too but the church getting in a minority now you look at this and this is always rough to swallow and i used to try to think well praise the lord our little group we don't have three kinds of believers here and maybe we don't tonight so don't misunderstand but you see wherever it is this spirit is there trying one to interfere some wavering back and forth and some sold out hallelujah doesn't it feel good to be sold out you go down to the auction my brother and sister you go down the auction i bought many things way too many things at auctions but so you go down the auction you don't want an auctioneer it says going for a fumble three hundred thousand three hundred thousand three hundred and five three hundred five three hundred five 306 306 305 305 going once going twice going three times may be sold to you you wouldn't know whether you owned it or not what do they do sold sold sold no one can contest it you just bought a corn chopper sister nadia look what the prophet of god says here hope you guys get this i got so excited then come the pentecostal baptism holy ghost still the church got smaller and now it goes on until it's got to such a perfect place until when the headstone finally comes it'll fit so perfect it won't be brother trevor get the rock saw brother chris bring that four bit and a sledgehammer no it's gonna come settle right down already picking on sister nadia she's good she smiles what is it it's going to create such a perfect bride that when that headstone christ comes down he won't be over there trying to rock it this way and trying to rock it that way and try and pull it here to make it fit that's right there's going to be a church there's going to be a bride there's going to be a people that have so submitted themselves to the word of god oh lord for me mold me make me lord if you've got a chip you got to grind you're going to do whatever you're going to do lord i want you to fit perfect in my life i don't need to justify my behaviors and my whatevers and my habits lord i don't need to justify that just mold me then you'll fit so perfect i was on that pyramid and i got up and every seam was so perfect till i got to the headstone and looks like they used a cement truck to fill the gaps no that's not the kind of bride god's calling he's calling a bride that has just stayed there and submitted herself and the word has shaped her and cut and molded until when the headstone finally comes it'll fit so perfect the church will have such a perfect shape oh come on saint you know i don't even have to preach this out you guys know what i'm talking about this church won't be over a tangent over here she won't be in a tangent over here she won't be over here well i know this isn't in the scripture but a friend of a friend of the prophet said come on that stuff is happening right here in this day people are outside the written word of god because a friend of a friend or whatever was with the prophet come on my brother and sister you'll find no quote nowhere that will support that but i can give you literally hundreds of quotes where the prophet of god says take it back to the word amen i want to be this bride can someone say amen i want to be this bride that's such a perfect shape until when christ come he fits right did you catch what the prophet said right he didn't say on it hallelujah this bride is going to be so perfect that when the headstone comes down he will fit right in to it oh hallelujah there's another generations of fanatics born praise the lord they're not going to accept anything to the right nothing to the left amen no i've been so molded oh hallelujah i want to just give you that disclaimer that everybody gets now this flesh is going to be with you always so don't look at your flesh no my brother and sister you look at the word and the word will deal with your flesh you prepare yourself for the headstone to come down in you and the issues of this flesh and life will be dealt with it might be good old-fashioned at the altar crying out to god forgive me lord i'm a sinner but god will move on you to deal with it hallelujah oh don't you love that as i was studying this i come across those things i was like oh hallelujah it's not on us amen it's not just an anointing on us amen but in us hallelujah that's what's going to make that difference hallelujah oh my oh my now here in the paradox now once again i i don't mean to sound facetious but to people who have to look at dates to determine the equitable authority of the quote depends on its date praise the lord prophet of god said 1947 more than once repent and be baptized that was in 47. no i'm sorry that's the same word of god and it carries the same authoritative power all the way through now was a revelation of the word to the prophet progressive absolutely was there was a time he thought the white horse rider was you know pale horse and had those things mixed up but my brother and sister don't ever let someone fool you into the idea that a quote has lost its authority because the date the prophet preached it we could preach a sermon on that how that god no matter he is in glory but his orders there is just the same effect on the whole world and anybody that takes the promise his order is given his laws of nature and they will absolutely carry themselves true from pentecost or any other time anytime that god made the promise he will stay with that promise regardless of where people is at how many thousands of years off his laws ever remain the same now i'm going to stop for a minute i'm going to interject this to the naysayers of the message the critics that say well brother branham said this this and this now my brother and sister there's things i i like to be blunt there's things that appear to be contradictory but they also say there's things in the bible that are contradictory so when you get a spirit of being contradictory oh to spear so brother brown says here regardless of where the people is at how many thousands of years off my brother and sister there's things the prophet of god said it would appear they haven't come to pass as far as we know there was a healing in africa yesterday can anyone tell me where it was at are you with me there was a deliverance in south america this last sunday can anybody here tell me what it was you see god's moving he doesn't bugle what does scripture say about our prayers don't be like them that blow a trumpet before god's moving he didn't say you need to know what's happening everywhere he said you need to believe i'm in you and you and me you need to believe this and then when we believe that i'm cutting my sermon short by not when we believe that the prophet god says we'll see god move in our midst but not until we believe that so you see it's self-fulfilling prophecy once people say god's not moving do you realize that self-fulfilling prophecy god's not moving of course he's not moving he can't move with your spirit right here he moves on the spirit when people say my god is an awesome god and i believe every word he said and i'm going to live it i'll confess it god comes down the supernatural starts happening hallelujah boy we could go on and on right here in the united states about all the things that god is doing how the seed falls into the ground it rots bring forth life again looks like if it's ever going to bring forth life it's when it's in its perfect shape you just think when the church got so perfect everything is just so good so good that's when god's gonna move no he says if their life was ever in it then why wouldn't it just come forth put in the ground the life spring forth why does all that's around that life all that's around that germ that no man can find how is that everything material around that germ has to die so it can spring forth in new life but everything around it must also die and rock before it can spring forth i'm going to throw a little spin at you can i god wants to move in our midst can we say amen but did you know that i'm gonna look at the ceiling when i say this that you over there your attitude would stop god from moving amen and you up here your attitude would stop god from moving and you down there and on the side those things in your life that you have refused to surrender to the lord would stop god moving but right in the midst that seed gene amen seed germ it's it's gonna it's gonna bring forth life everything around it might have to rot everything else around it's gonna have to start dying out oh god let me die yeah let me die lord let me so our young people we got young people in this church that are getting older and older day by day by day my brother and sister they need a a a repentance they need a baptism they need a new birth amen and they do that why because every day they get older it's going to be harder for them to surrender to the lord that's why it behooves you and i as brothers and sisters to rot so that the seed that hasn't germinated yet will have its opportunity churches wonder well why are all our young people leaving why because the old people haven't rotted yet haven't completely given over to god yet god help us church grace tabernacle i love you but we got to get these spirits in these isms and scissors and contentions and whatever we got to kill them things and we're going to die with it amen so that the spirit of god can come and move in our midst i believe in a supernatural god i've seen him way too many times in my life to say here today and say well those are gone by it is present my brother and sister but we've got to die amen everything material around that germ has to die so it can bring forth a new life but everything around it must also die and rot before it can spring forth life amen so it is with the individual as long as there is any human injection human ideas then god's germ of life the holy spirit cannot work you cannot be healed as long as there's just a fraction somewhere that's not rotten yet it's got all the human elements all the scientific elements all the days of miracles is power so-called all that has to all not only die but rot and then from there grows the germ of life into a new life that's the only way it can grow that's the reason we don't get what we ask for we try to take with us so much of our own ideas are you listening paul haley amen that's the reason the lutheran church couldn't advance no further than it did the pentecostals and such because they inject by a bunch of theologians this ought to be this way this is for another day and this was for that there it stays it cannot grow to that perfect image of christ until every word of god is received into you then you become that word it's like the seed that went in the ground i tell you i want to be that word hallelujah i don't want to just talk about god sent a prophet i want to become that very word hallelujah and the prophet of god came in the 20th century to do what reveal the word do you realize that we all look back and say oh there it is hebrews oh oh here it is malachi oh here it is revelation he's revealing the word do you get it do you get it saints he come as a prophet to laodicea to reveal the word hallelujah and we are the word hallelujah it is there that god through the preaching of the word amen brother brown says i am god's voice to you boy he sure took a lot on himself did he except for it was god moving him to say i'm speaking you hear william branham but it's jesus christ that's speaking and i'm here to reveal the word amen oh hallelujah i say the word's been revealed my brother and sister i say there ought to be some people whose hearts would be enough to just kick them in the seat of the pants and get them going and saying thank you lord thank you lord the word has been revealed i believe it oh how i believe it i have been revealed the prophet of god come along then oh it seems like it's disconnected unconnected not related but the prophet of god says when the bride sees who she is she will become an invincible army what is it she doesn't see oh help i'm cutting a lot off so we aren't late sister emmy come she doesn't stop and look in the mirror of the flesh she cannot stop there she can't focus that because she knows that she has the word and the word corrects the air and if the air is our flesh but the word is in us then the word will correct the flesh oh can we get excited about that i tell you what my brother and sister to realize that the word amen the prophet of god makes several statements several quotes uh some of it you know not so direct that it seems like it jumps out at you but he's talking about how it come down to a time and a place hey man sister jerry i don't mean to put light to her but she just shared this with me my brother tim pruitt put it in this fashion he's he said something you order i i i sometimes muddle these things up forgive me he said we knew that these great things of god had to take place we knew there had to be signs and wonders and openings and signs in the heavens and signs in the earth what we didn't realize was that the word had to be made flesh that's what stumbles people it had to be manifested in the flesh oh hallelujah now when you think about being one in a million i want you to also think about how god loves you so much brother alex we take me back to my original scriptures please [Music] hallelujah maybe i've overlooked it maybe it was in that original piece brother alex my somebody help me i just can't seem to find that he delighted oh 19. [Music] he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me why did god come down pour himself in your flesh why did he come down to let you be his representation because he delighted in you and i oh hallelujah i tell you my brother and sister i want my lord to delight in me amen i want to be so prepared that when that capstone comes down we don't have to get over there chip a little here and chip a little there let that word just come right down in you and i make a difference in our lives oh hallelujah aren't you glad because did you know this is past tense i'll just close it out with that this is all that i preached to you tonight past tense my lord jesus hung on the cross earthly representation of what had already taken place and to all that had the seed gene seed germ of life in them he told you right there it's finished it's finished just recognize now who you are let the word come let the word do the work and you'll be perfect you will be perfect oh hallelujah hallelujah oh i trust tonight it kind of made sense it kind of goes around this way and kind of down that way but we'll leave samson for another night [Music] but believe it or not samson ties right in here he jumped right in the middle of it and every bit of this applied to him and everything that applied to him applies to you and i oh hallelujah well god will make a way brother jason help [Music] me [Music] oh make a way lord where there seems to be [Music] way he works in ways [Music] with love and strength way o god will make a way where there seems to be no way he works in ways we cannot see he will make for me he will be my god holy closely to his son with love and strength for each new day we will make a way god will make thy loving kindness hallelujah don't you just love him tonight how sweet he is to us you see my brother and sister it wasn't as though he threw some pixie dust out there and whoever it landed on was a believer [Music] god examined every single attribute that makes up who you are and he looked down through time and he says that attribute is the attribute of a believer he recognized that and says hmm that's my son and he writes over here with the blood of the lamb writes a name in the book what was it did that name be in the book make you believe no sir it was the testament that you are a believer oh hallelujah oh how loving kindness he let that seed germ come right down in you and i [Music] hallelujah [Music] is better than light my lips shall praise thee let's just stand saying thus will i bless me i will lift up my hand in my day i lift my hands long unto thy name i lift my hands unto thy name my lips shall praise me thus will i bless thee i will lift up my hands in hallelujah oh my sister sue would like to be remembered in prayer let's just continue to remember our sister hey man just a lot of difficulties a lot of little things happening amen so just pray god just give her strength amen i love sister

certain way i just want a complete deliverance and i thank the lord for what he's done amen hallelujah you know when you're driving a car you don't want to have to guess whether it's the one on the right or the one on the left it's the real one amen luis we dismiss let's just sing that little song thank god i am free amen and i truly today thank you lord that i am free oh hallelujah for a long
