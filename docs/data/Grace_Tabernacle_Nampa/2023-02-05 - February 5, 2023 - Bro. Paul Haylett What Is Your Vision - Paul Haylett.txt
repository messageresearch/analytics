morning we just love the Lord [Music] Saints it is with a very very heavy heart that'll come before you today this morning to hear the shocking news that my brother and friend brother Gideon retief you might say he died the poster Duty headed to church a Ponder this morning how the [Music] incredible way that God approaches things I know my brother Gideon even though we didn't interact a lot he was a person that I just understood [Music] and I guess he understood me well enough to look at me with that certain little look on his face and say I know what you're thinking [Music] on its way to church this morning had a heart attack [Music] and uh passed away I don't know they say there's an accident because of that and I just trust that there was anyone else involved in that accident that Lord would just have his hand upon them you know we were privileged sister Jerry and I to spend [Music] virtually all day every day for three weeks in December the further Gideons is to Kathy got to hear his vision for the church this desire to the people [Music] we got two spend time with his daughter and family grandsons that adored him [Music] son Anthony who's from where a little boy has been handicapped but yet it would be as though A light turned on when he would see and hear his father a heart would be broken as though Lord why would you take them away take him away but we stand today and say my God's way is perfect we don't have to understand we just have to know and believe that God's way is perfect [Music] brother Andrew sister Gloria O'Brien called me right after you did Brother David [Music] I have to appreciate that they're saying brother Paul you're going to need somebody to pray for you this morning and we're here to pray for you Saints must remember the church there remember the family I'm just I'm just devastated I [Music] Last Words is we'll see you soon I don't know maybe it'll be sooner than we think I pray that it is amen [Music] around a little bit this morning please forgive me let's just stand as we go into the word this morning I want to preach to you on a very simple thought thank you brother Isaac thank you sister amen on a simple thought what is our vision and my brother and sister God has never left his people without a vision because the scripture clearly says that if there is no vision the people perish and God never called you and I to perish in fact God said I'm going to bless you about beyond measure amen so I say today thank you Lord for your grace and mercy let's turn in our Bibles to Luke the second chapter and uh I had not announced this but uh sister Jerry and I will be preaching I I will be preaching for Brother Rich and Oregon this coming uh Sunday so if you would just please pray for our time there with the Saints amen Luke 2 21 and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child and his name was called Jesus which was so named of the Angel before he was conceived in the womb and when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord now I find that very interesting my brother and sister how God would choose to represent this to us because you we could look at this and say but Jesus was God in flesh but you see even then there had to come a maturity so we see the vessel but that vessel was not a direct manifestation of God in flesh does that make sense that was a baby because God wanted to do all things liken as we would see it as we would experience so God didn't come in a complete way opposite of anything that we would ever experience but he came in the same path walked in the same steps manifested the same revelation does that make sense to you all amen to present him to the Lord as is written in the law of the Lord every male that openeth the womb Shall be Called holy to the Lord and to offer sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just in devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him oh my I'm telling you what my brother and sister what God will do in our life amen when the Holy Ghost is upon us and it was revealed to him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ and he came by the spirit now my brother and sister I want you to catch this so I don't really need to deal with it later he didn't come by an intellectual revelation he didn't come by figuring out the odds the chances just how it might be but he came LED of the spirit amen Our God does the same in our life amen and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took he him up in his arms Simeon took him up in his arms blessed God and said Lord now let us thou thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou Hast prepared before the face of all people a light to light the Gentiles and the glory of thy People Israel and Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him and Simeon blessed them and said unto Mary his mother behold this child is set for the fall and the rising of again of many in Israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against amen Heavenly Father we just ask you this morning come father Lord while my heart is sad this morning at the passing of my brother Lord my heart rejoices to see your word coming to pass in this day in this people father for truly the light has come upon us and we can walk in that light father we thank you for the revelation of that we thank you for the life Lord that you have poured into us something father we would not be capable in the flesh you have not only made it to happen that we would be capable but you have manifested father as the prophet of God said Supreme deity has come to us that we can walk in that light father we thank you today in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated Saints thank you all right as we see the supernatural has come to Mary as a virgin now that promise was to Israel that a virgin shall conceive and not my brother and sister was no doubt generation after generation of young women in Israel devout living their life correctly maybe their mama when they were a child said you know it could be you and there was an expectation but God come and fulfilled his word he come down and Angel spoke to Mary and we would understand I believe today saints that if God has made a promise for us it will come to pass amen people question they say but brother Branham made prophecies and we haven't seen them come to pass but my brother and sister there are things happening around the world today that we know nothing about and we tend to assume that maybe if something was prophesied that it must come to pass and make as it were the evening news of the message but it's not so God brings it to pass prophecy is fulfilled no matter where this takes place and so as God brings about this there isn't a great attention called there isn't uh something that is trumpeted in the evening news but here is Joseph and Mary following the law of Moses so they are just being good Jews to follow the law and to bring this baby to the temple to be blessed to give it to the Lord and so is as they are coming little do they know that while they are following the law they're soon going to be a part of the fulfilling of Prophecy and I say this morning my brother and sister we do our very best each and every day to live the word of God for this hour but little do we know that we are actually also in the midst of fulfilling prophecy amen and I'll put it this way my brother and sister I look at the very Vindication of the message of brother Branham not that brother Branham was there and Supernatural signs took place discernments and and healings I don't look at that myself personally my brother and sister because that's all a part of the commission that God give to him but what I see is a Vindication today is there is a people on the Earth today that are living out and fulfilling the word that was testified in our day if that word was testified and there was no life in it it would not produce a people whose heart's desire is to serve God with all their heart mind body and soul so I thank God today that it wasn't just a prophet coming my brother and sister there was power in that word there was life in that word and the power and that life come down wasn't kept to a prophet but it was poured out as the word says into the church and we are the church and this life is here and now it wasn't for us just to acknowledge that a supernatural sign come in our day but it is to recognize the supernatural natural sign which was Jesus Christ has come and rests upon us today and it is our position now not only to live and let me use it this way to do the law but the law had purpose Beyond just fulfilling the law here is prophecy concerning Mary you're going to have a child I don't know if I can accept that but right in their midst was the prophecy right in the midst of Israel right in the midst of the people was the prophecy they didn't have to take anyone's word for it they could go back because they testified of Isaiah they testified of him being a man of God a great man of God all they had to do is go back and look at what the prophecy was and they would have stopped and said you know what we believe this is going to come to pass and we'll look for it but you see my brother and sister what happened was is there was something that got in between them and you know it's it's there that we'll see how that God was bringing now to fulfill the law and the Very one that says I didn't come to do away with the law I come to fulfill the law the very one is Babe in arms at the moment and they're looking to the law and saying we must take him to the temple and we must give offering but little did they know what God was really doing was bringing them in the intersection of time to fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah to fulfill these things in the word of God to bring them to a place a junction of time that these things could come to pass because you see my brother and sister God follows his own teaching God doesn't have shortcuts that's why it bothers me I'll be honest bothers me in the day that we live in when people ministers around the message are offering shortcuts my brother and sister God does not give shortcuts God does not take shortcuts but God has a word and he's going to fulfill his word and we see Simeon the scripture says he was a just and devout man and he was waiting for the consolation of Israel now let's just take this word consolation my brother and sister the consolation of Israel was a comfort that would come from a fulfilling of Prophecy it wasn't to make them comfortable my brother and sister to set today just for life to be cushy we're not talking about that kind of comfort but it was a comfort that would come to the soul when Israel had their Messiah prophecy declared that there would be peace in Israel and I'm telling you my brother and sister too many people took that word piece and said you know what there'll be no more Wars there'll be no more but the peace my brother and sister is what has come down in the heart and soul of Sons and Daughters of God and that peace to rest upon the word of God it didn't take away our trials it didn't take away our struggles as it were but we have a peace in who we are and where we stand and that was a position that was prophesied and given to Israel at that time that they would come at the acceptance or the the return of the Messiah that there would be a peace come to Israel and so they're all looking and this is why as we shared this last uh service on the road to Emmaus you see they thought that they that Jesus was going to be the one that was going to to bring Israel to a place of being conquerors Overcomers that put down all of their enemies that's the peace that they were looking for but little did they know as the prophecy of Isaiah said that the Prince of Peace amen was coming to them and so as it's here we'll look at this and they're waiting for the consolation Simeon was waiting for the consolation of Israel waiting for comfort that had been prophesied promised to Israel now as we'll look here real quick in Isaiah 9 and 6 just to bring these scriptures you're very familiar with them but I just feel to tie them in For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it to establish it with judgment and with Justice from henceforth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this my brother and sister is such a beautiful scripture this was the promise to Israel this was their consolation and we see this baby now what appointment many poignant moments in in Israel in the history of Israel many many things my brother and sister that were filming of many prophecies and you know when something is uh poignant it is uh many times there's a degree of sadness sorrow uh Etc attached with this so many times through Israel there was something that happened where the people just come just a little bit short and what they thought was going to be fulfilled or what was going to happen did not happen and we see that Israel even to this day is in a constant state of of seeking reaching out grasping out trying to find peace in the natural trying to find the Fulfillment of the word all of these things still to this very moment they're still grasping at that and still at this very moment there's Publications there's writings there's things in recent and past history you might say they're lamenting if only this had happened well I want to tell you my brother and sister do we believe God's in control this morning there is no need for us to be setting if this had happened we need to walk in the light right now not trying to live in the past if we have issues in our life don't look back at those issues look at the light standing right now and say from this moment I'm going to walk in the light amen from this moment I'm not going to look back and say if only this if only that I'm gonna walk in that light and I'm going to claim every promise of God from this moment on oh how easy it is to live in the past I remember brother once saying you know there is a reason the windshield is as big as it is in the rear view mirror is the size that it is yes imagine if God had wanted it Opposite he would give us very limited vision to the Future and give us a very large revelation of the past but it's the opposite amen so God is dealing now he comes down and here is is this time prophecies must be fulfilled we know that there is no there is no bypassing prophecy my brother and sister and so here is right in the temple that day there is no great light there's no sounding of symbols or horns that there is a incredible event taking place now Joseph and Mary are just bringing baby Jesus to fulfill the law I I don't know if this will register with you my brother and sister but we can get up on a Sunday morning and we can think I'm just going to church today but my brother and sister God's got a whole greater plan than us just showing up at church he's got a supernatural amen can I say this a supernatural appointment with you and I the house of God and you say life is difficult and we have this trouble we have this trouble but what about the prophecy no one asked Joseph and Mary how do you feel about taking Jesus to the temple today they were just like we're fulfilling the law we didn't get out of bed this morning jump and Shout praise God something Supernatural is going to happen at the temple today they were there it is according to the law the days have passed the days of purification and we now according to the law have a duty to take Jesus to the temple to give him to the Lord for him to be blessed and they might not even have been excited my brother and sister maybe so there would be a degree like a mother a father dedicating their baby there's something there but you know maybe not heel clicking excitement to run around and say whoa this is the day my brother and sister it was another day the sun had Rose they had put on their best garment they had a duty to do and I want to emphasize a duty that's right and they went off to the house of God to give their little baby boy to the Lord but an intersection of time is a man named Simeon filled with the Holy Ghost anointed of God then at some date history doesn't really lock this down for us but at some point of time the Holy Ghost come and spoke to him and said you will not pass from this life until you have seen the Lord's Christ now this man didn't say well I hope this happens I'm wondering how this will happen he took that in because why he had that relationship with God that the spirit speaking to him and him speaking in the spirit and he knew when that voice spoke to him why because he knew the voice it wasn't just a voice he knew that voice and as that voice spoke to him and says you will not pass from this life until you have seen the Lord's Christ and he believed oh I tell you you'd help a lot of us if we'd throw the nonsense around us throw it out throw this voice out throw this influence out throw this negative thought out and just believe amen here's the there there had to be a lot of reasons why Simeon would have thought may I don't know see it don't really lay it down for us but if you'd give me the kindness to just lay this out maybe Simeon had walked for 40 or 50 years with this revelation that's right maybe not a revelation my brother and sister they just showed up yesterday and said oh I'm not going to die until I see no I believe he carried this with him because God likes to test us with time God likes to use time to test us and he believed and so as we see this the hustle and bustle of all the things of the Temple and here's Joseph and Mary coming now my brother and sister to the Casual Observer they see Mary as a young woman with compromised morals they don't see her as that chosen virgin out of Israel that found favor with God to bring forth the Redeemer in their religious World they were so caught up with their rights and their wrongs and their measures that all they saw was a little girl I don't care what they say I don't care about her story about being met by an Angel she's a young girl and she's having a child now she's had a child she's married Joseph it's such a mess she'll never have happened in our community should have never happened in our church should have never happened prophecy said it would happen amen so they are looking in flesh at the word of God not even understanding no revelation of what God is doing I pray we don't stand that way today I pray that by God's grace we can see the word coming to pass see the life that is in the word being poured out because otherwise we'll see the supernatural pass right before our eyes and never respond I'm sorry I I don't remember the sermon now but brother Branham one time is speaking to a young lady I say young lady to a lady to a sister and he tells her what's wrong with her tells her her name and when you hear it on tape you'll hear the prophet of God in a very deep burdened voice respond yeah respond in a space and he says you missed it and then he goes on and discerns another individual my brother and sister I pray that we are not sitting here today in such a state of the message that the Holy Spirit would deal with our hearts and we would fail to respond amen amen amen hallelujah so that casual Observer looking at Mary didn't see anything at all my they're married now but we know that child probably shouldn't even be here shouldn't even be brought the scripture says child like that shouldn't even be bought into the house of God for Generations but that was a carnal man's vision because God's Vision had come to him godly man holy ghost-filled man named Simeon saw an entirely different Vision my brothers and sisters than the priests saw entirely different Vision than all the religious people saw and God come down to Simeon and is giving a revelation of what is to happen here and so it's there my brother and sister this Vision amen there's the carnal man's vision and then God had a vision in the land that was there for the benefit of the people they didn't understand it but God had it there and this Vision brought the Revelation brought by the revelation of the Holy Ghost is declaring to the people that this is going to be the one oh my brother and sister when Simeon prayed in the temple Simeon didn't whisper Simeon prayed and those around him if they had had an ear to hear would have heard simeon's prayer now the prophet of God will read a quote here in just a bit prophet of God doesn't talk about Simeon as just being a man he's talking about a man on position a man that was respected a man that was honored and if they had just listened to Simeon many of them would have said there's something special Supernatural taking place right now in our midst all they had to do I'm telling you my brother and sister I don't want to sound judgmental today by any means shape or form but what we need to do is just get back and hear what the voice for our day says amen not what somebody interpreted to us not what somebody else explained it to us but we need to just listen to the voice because the voice has declared Deliverance The Voice has declared the coming of the son of man in our midst as declared that we would become as a prophet teachers that we would become God in morphe in US amen God in us living that's what the word says not us in form and formality not us declaring ah we follow my brother and sister no I'm not going to follow the message I am the message God help us to realize that we are the message in this day amen we are the evidence that this word is true because you look around I'm not justifying who we are but look around this is why my brother and sister that a good heart a a minister with the right heart does not just want to preach to you he wants you to see yourself in the message of the hour he wants you to see yourself in the Bible he wants you to see yourself filled with the Holy Ghost because it's in that position right there that it's God in you and everything else is shot out in that little room the prophet of God talked about you're in there you walk out what happened I don't know what happened but I know it happened I know that God is changing me I know that whatever I was in the past even when I say past might be just this morning whatever's in the past is the past and I'm a son I'm a daughter and I'm going to walk forward in the vision because if we don't Satan will constantly throw those things in front of you that you will constantly be reminded you're human in flesh and God's I don't care about your flesh I didn't come to redeem the flesh I come to put the word in you and let the flesh manifest the word of God oh you go brother Paul you're getting out there no I'm not I got I got scripture and I got quotes to back this up amen because God wants the life to be manifested not just for people to say oh Jesus Christ is is alive he's resurrected but for people to be able to say he's walking in flesh again my neighbor Maya Maya Auntie my uncle whoever it would be is a representation of Christ amen now you look at this my brother and sister I've changed the words just a little bit and I hope you don't mind but this Vision was bought brought by the revelation of the Holy Ghost that's right it wasn't as it were riding on the wall that we said okay I gotta follow this or a scroll that was turned that somehow no one had ever interpreted correctly no my brother and sister they had read the Scrolls front to back top to bottom every way you can read it every way you could study it every way you could interpret it they had done that but it was done in an intellectual approach and they had missed the revelation of the Holy Ghost that was to bring this to pass amen amen amen I prayed for years over my mother it was my heartfelt desire I prayed for years that my mother would be alive and remain at the coming of the Lord it was my heart's desire God chose otherwise my brother Gideon God chose otherwise does not take one thing away from the promise of God Amen that's right and Simeon celebrated another birthday and another birthday amen and another birthday and I believe on the other side we'll get to talk to Simeon we ask him Simeon do you ever have doubts oh there was a time or two time or two maybe my heart gave me a few issues and you know it just looked like it was over I don't know how that would be but I believe Simeon had one thing I didn't include the quote but the prophet of God said there's one thing about a Believer paraphrasing this one thing about a Believer they always come back to the word not to emotion not to thinking not what the devil painted the picture they come back to the word I say Lord help us help us no matter how defeated we feel how weak we feel what the flesh is doing what the mind is doing let us Circle back around to the word and let us look at the word and say Lord what did you promise me and Lord you said that you called me before the foundation of the world you said I was a son you said I was a daughter you said that I had eternal life I'm circling back to that I'm not going to receive any other explanation and Simeon is there and my brother and sister history would tell you that he was old and he was feeble he was coming to the end of his life but God is faithful Can someone say Amen my God is faithful and he knew he didn't guess he didn't hope he knew that he would not pass from this life until he had saw the Lord's Christ and I'm going to get ahead of myself and I'm sorry I can't help it but there will not be one son or daughter of God that's name is on the Lamb's Book of Life will pass from this life until they have saw the Lord's Christ amen there is no way God will lose a one go study what the prophet says about that God will not lose a one the picture might not be pretty the picture might not be pretty my brother and sister but God will not lose them oh Hallelujah and here's Simeon believing amen what the Holy Ghost had spoke to him amen and it's in that position that he anchored that down in his soul you see my brother and sister knowing this if Israel had not been influenced by other things you know what the greatest thing that influenced Israel was religion I want to bring you right here to this day right now I don't want our young people listening to this garbage music I don't want our young people acting like these these almost like lunatics out here I'm telling you I've done this before and maybe it comes across funny but my brother and sister there's nothing normal about young men walking with their knees poked out to keep their pants from falling on the ground there's nothing normal about young men walking along with one hand holding up the back of their britches to keep their pants from falling on the ground there's not one thing normal about that behavior not one thing normal about a young man with hair that he has to keep flipping out of his face like a girl see young men the other day with bobby pins in his hair come on that's nothing normal about that my brother and sister and it goes to the other side but we won't go there you've got the point I believe so we look at the world today and realize that there is something that has Twisted the mind of the people and the prophet of God said even what happened in Russia was a Church's fault communism sweeping the nation exactly was the church's fault why because they had given the people an empty promise but here stands Simeon as a witness today to tell you God gave me a promise the revelation of the Holy Spirit and I believe that promise and I went birthday after birthday after birthday I went to the temple time after time to do my own worship and it was there often no doubt wondering is this today is this the day is this the time and when he walked back out of the temple and it had not happened it didn't say that was an empty promise he said this is not the day this is the day but the day of the Lord is coming and I will be there testifying on the day of the Lord amen and so it's there this Revelation brought to him and if Israel had not been influenced by other things when Jesus came to the temple that day they would have been there to worship with them why weren't they in the temple looking for the babe because in their mind various sects of the religion of that time various groups some believed he was going to float down like an angel to the Pinnacle of the Temple and stand there while all of Israel come to worship Him you know it was closer to that revelation Satan's offer to our Lord Jesus Christ see where their interpretation was much closer to Satan's interpretation than God's interpretation so they're all viewing this and Satan my brother and sister would be sitting there saying now if that does come to pass it will be a manifestation where I am now in control and then see how this comes and there it is with our lord Jesus he comes and says hey look I'm going to bring you here to the Pinnacle and I want you to look at all of this I'll give to you if you'll just bow down and follow me shows you religious world doesn't like that because it shows where the influence now if you go listen to the sermon Satan's Eden you'll see how the prophet of God ties it right back to our day that is there all this stuff we're coming to the Lord building multi this back then he said million dollar churches my brother and sister now it'd be like have to be a 20 30 40 million dollar church amen so look at this how many in that day We Believe that that little baby being carried into the temple how many would believe that was the Messiah in morphe Supernatural how do I do this I'll just use the word anatomy instead of trying to give you a breakdown I could see sister April going no no no go back to the old childhood and uh hip bones connected to the I can't even remember all the words that go through that I was all Supernatural my brother and sister that baby that was in Mary's arms was not a product of a human that was God himself in more faith being carried in there not one person but uh Simeon and Anna recognize who this is right but look what the word of God's done today my brother and sister a prophet of God come he laid this out God speaking through him lay this out that you and I today by Revelation couldn't stand and say I am Jesus Christ in morphine I am God in more faith today it is God it's not Flair it's God because it says flesh my brother and sister it can't stand the fire and everything must pass through the fire it's only the supernatural of the Lord Jesus Christ that can pass through the fire of this day you'll find that it is I'll get sidetracked if I go there just think about Daniel Shadrach Meshach and bedniko just think about them my brother and sister if they had just been flesh they'd have caught on fire not Daniel but shadrache would have just caught on fire goes to show you see that God had already taken over that body they gave that body to God and our God is fireproof Hallelujah aren't you glad about that I'm glad our God is fireproof amen there's no way oh Hallelujah so let me keep going here I hope you forgive me today my thoughts are just such a a jumble all the things that have happened you see as hard as it would have been to see that wasn't man's Vision right there that was God's vision that was God in the midst of the people fulfilling the word and only a handful caught the revelation of the opening of the word it went right over the head of so many that they saw this happening they no doubt heard Simeon praying they no doubt as they was saw Anna my brother and sister these things taking place and not one understood but those who had Revelation understood now brother Branham says here in expectations now the waiting of the Messiah had been four thousand years and in every generation they had looked for the Messiah to come but that did stump Simeon Simeon didn't look and say man they've been waiting for the Messiah for so long surely there was a misunderstanding there was certainly a misinterpretation it didn't stump Simeon why because a holy ghost spoke to him God himself spoke to Simeon and Simeon knew that voice and said you know what this is the truth I'll stand with this truth so it didn't stump him he was an old man in his 80s but still he believed he would see the Messiah and he had a long white beard I could imagine and white hair and he was a great man among the people he had great prestige but he had a testimony besides that that's what I like besides all of his scholarships and all of his popularity he had a humble heart before God a receptive heart that God could deal with and he had a testimony by that that he was going to see the Lord's Christ before he died think of it amen I'm telling you my brother and sister the whole world today theologians over here there's the Rapture is not in the Bible uh there's this there's that you can't explain this you do this but my brother and sister the word come and spoke to our hearts and said you know what I'm not going to have you consecrate and judge yourself now to take you through a judgment no sir that's what you're doing right now and Saints I want to encourage you do your preparation now no one be saying another day another day another day I'll get over this complex I'll get over this hurt from my childhood I'll get over this issue I'll get over that issue do it today amen and give it to God and claim the word claim the Revelation the opening of the word today say it's mine today Lord it is mine Lord and I claim it Hallelujah because another day my brother and sister is just another day which is nothing more than another day and it won't get you any closer to the promise but when you can come to that place and say Lord I believe the word that you have opened already we're looking for a greater Revelation why don't you live the Revelation that's already been given amen don't be looking off in the future that's Satan my brother and sister has us stargazing off in the Horizon somewhere of a great move of God but how about we stand today and say Lord what you have opened to me today I believe it you know God never gave Simeon a detailed book he gave him a promise and all Simeon could do is follow the promise hmm amen do we have a promise how about Saints we just ask the Lord to give us strength to follow that promise that's right excuse me if I get a little excited now this is scripture verse 25 26 27. reiterating once again is what we've already read you know that it comes down the very Holy Spirit that revealed this to Simeon led him I would like you to catch this same holy spirit that said you'll not die till you see the Lord's Christ didn't leave Simeon there trying to figure it out didn't leave Simeon out there wandering around like a blind man in the dark trying to find you don't see Simeon you don't see this testimony of Simeon going down the streets of Jerusalem saying are you the Lord's Christ are you is this baby no my brother or sister this leadership of the holy spirit is so positive it is so direct it is so real that we just need to learn to trust it it is we just need to learn to say okay Lord it doesn't seem like I'm headed the right direction it doesn't seem this is the way that I should go but Lord I trust you so much and to understand that God's plans are perfect he will not lead you the prophet of God said God cannot lead you away from his word amen come on I don't care where you've been and what you've stumbled over God will not lead you away from his word amen amen and it was that Holy Spirit I don't know what the circumstances are I don't none of that but I know that the holy spirit let Simeon now when you realize we've been there just uh I'll say a few weeks ago that the time is flying the temple my brother and sister wasn't the size of Grace Tabernacle in fact the area to wash your feet and stuff to enter into the temple was an area that's as big as our church walk down the stone steps men on one side they even had a rail men on one side women on the other you washed your feet and prepped yourself and washed yourself and you come out and exit over here God let him to the porch the entrance for him to enter in you don't have to lift a hand but I just want to put this before you do we really believe with all of our heart that God has led us to the place to enter in so God called us to go study the word study the message that has come to us to go years and years to stop and say Well it fits the word but this isn't the right entrance no I'm sorry that's not what the Holy Spirit does make run for reference once again the song God leads his dear children along and when Simeon come that day he walks right in there and my brother and sister I want you to catch the visual of this here is Joseph and Mary carrying Jesus Simeon isn't busting through the crowd trying to find a little boy that would be inspiration for him to say this is the one but the Holy Spirit Joseph and Mary step by step Simeon step by step and all the mothers and fathers there that day God takes Simeon write to them amen I hope you catch the spiritual significance of that the very Prince of Peace come and as a baby he couldn't reach up and say Simeon this is the Fulfillment of Prophecy so God then put that in the heart of Simeon this is the one this is the Fulfillment of what I promised that I would see the Lord's Christ watch you're looking at a little baby Simeon that's right I am by Revelation I see him of who he is and what he was called for and the supernatural that will be taken place and for a rising and for a falling of Israel my brother and sister the prophecy was brought right out right there and even to the point it was spoken the words that this would be in my words ill spoken of it would be degraded it would be cursed it would be cast down but it will be the truth Hallelujah and that's what God's done right here you look with this and so he had this he was going to see the Lord's Christ amen so he looked at this he led him in the temple that day write to Jesus amen so what was it the consolation of Israel see Simeon been looking for this consolation of Israel and the consolation of Israel was right there maybe no one else well Anna that day but no one else my brother and sister would have went away from there that day with the peace that Simeon had in his heart what the Lord spoke I believed and I watched it come to pass no doubt my brother and sister Simeon walked out of there with a great joy in his heart oh look God has brought this to pass amen but look at this you know I I hope this doesn't come across too hard but I felt led to say it so here we go how is it today that people say well the Lord led me by the spirit to the message but refused to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit here's what the message says and here's what I think now I can take this quote and if I stop at this sentence I can shout hallelujah for the first half of this quote but the last half the quotes hard for me to swallow so I will just cut the quote off right here that way I'm happy but see the holy spirit that called us to hear this word of the hour is the holy spirit that's going to call us to come completely amen into a relationship with the Lord's Christ come into a complete relationship which means my brother and sister I'm still working on it so don't think that I'm hammering on you I'm still working on this but it's coming easier and easier to go through the word and go through the message and stop and say that's got to get out of my life I've got to take this and get rid of this I've got to toss this away I've got to forsake this feeling or this idea I've got to do that because God's working on us God's bringing his word out and and Satan just makes it so easy right this morning our brother rap crook will be preaching in Hickory may be already done about boiling frogs in Babylon sounds like an interesting topic doesn't it what is boiling frogs in Babylon got to do it's got to do with your life Satan just keeps turning the heat up go to Hickory Bible Tabernacle if nothing else just go there to look at brother rap's little screen and he's got a frog sitting in what he calls a Jacuzzi his hot tub fire under it what is happening brother app will be telling them this morning how Satan's going to make them really happy right to the moment they get to hell they won't be happy after that but they'll be happy all the way there my mother and sister I want you to think about it amen I was tempted this morning just to stream it and just put wraps sermon up on the screen I was sitting there in my office just crying my eyes out and I thought well that'd be a lot simpler but I don't believe this time I spent studying this was just to be put on hope and believe God put it to bring it to this hour amen so what happened we refuse to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit my brother and sister we were designed by God to follow the leadership of something so if we step away from the leadership of the Holy Spirit we will step into the leadership of another spirit and so why don't we just simply oh brother Paul Paul you're just being too too whatever Common Sense maybe call it why don't we just look at the word and if the word says don't then we just don't and the word says do then we just do instead of asking everyone to give us 14 interpretations of why we should do my brother and sister if God sent a prophet we believe that was the leadership of the Holy Spirit then we should say Lord I want to follow that leadership I don't need someone explaining me out of that leadership I don't want somebody giving me a comfortable way to live in this life that's outside of the word of God but Simeon comes he takes the baby he prays a blessing over the baby and it's there that this blessing is so incredible and I've got to hurry amen so real to Simeon my brother and sister it's there verses 28 29 and on then he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said Lord now let us that servant depart in peace according to Thy word see he didn't even view it as his own words that he was going to depart in peace he was trusting God that his departure would be in peace where my Knives have seen thy salvation which thou has prepared before the face of all people I like to lighten the Gentiles my brother and sister this event right here was for you and I and the glory of God glory of thy People Israel and Joseph and his mother Marvel now these are people marveling at what Simeon says and here is Mary that met an angel there shouldn't be anything that would cause her to Marvel I'm telling you my brother and sister if an angel come down and said you are going to have a child by the Holy Ghost and you have a child my brother and sister shouldn't be anything else in life shock you but we're human and we tend after a little season and I just want to put it to you this day how many times in our life has God come down on the scene and we can with all honesty in our soul say it was the Lord that came on the scene but you give it two years and we've forgotten all about it hmm so maybe Mary was just a normal little girl in Israel because she's just like you and I um you wouldn't believe that if you're a Catholic though you'd think that Mary was just right there jumped out of the pages of Mythology and was the greatest thing there was an amazing how idolatry can just creep in amen taking this from the message from what the prophet said every Generations had a witness of the supernatural every generation has been given a vision right scripture says without a vision the people perish and my brother and sister this generation has seen the problem boy I'm struggling this morning proclamation of Christ once again in the temple come on that ought to get somebody a little excited God's got a proclamation in this generation in the temple where is the temple Hallelujah we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost amen so the word has declared just as sure as it did to Mary just as sure as it did to Simeon it has made a declaration that God would once again be in his Temple oh Hallelujah I say thank you Lord we don't have a Mecca to go to we don't need to go back to Israel to find a temple God has proclaimed and embodied himself in the temple today oh thank you Lord Jesus my it's interesting how we need such reminders my brother and sister but I'm telling you God is going to give us the reminder because we are the very Temple of the Holy Ghost amen but he didn't come back in the temple as a babe there's a lot of Babe Revelations out there baby acting producing baby I'm telling you I think Jerry and I is loving grandparents are going to let deki drive us home from church today no that has to be maturity Amen to manifest the gift hmm are you with me has to be maturity to manifest there's a lot of people got all kinds of the Lord told me this nonsense like the Lord told me I I should go you know do this and I should go do that and it's just right there black and white in front of them I was just gonna share one of the later comments brother George shared with me but it wouldn't be fair to brother George but it's quite humorous and direct to the point now look at this as our consolation our comfort our peace can we say this morning we have that if we can't say this morning that we have our consolation then I encourage you not to even leave the sanctuary today till you break through and let God be the one who gives that consolation gives that peace to you because my brother and sister without that we are like a ping pong ball or whatever a pinball just bouncing from one thing to the next amen it's not what God called us to do but you see he come came as a lion he came as a lamb and now he's came as a bridegroom so what is our position today I want to recognize my bridegroom when my bridegrooms in the temple if you're with me when my bridegrooms in the temple I want to recognize the bridegroom is in the temple my brother and sister you see he's come down once again in morphe right that's it he's present we need to recognize him sorry I'm skipping some of this it might be confusing forgive me Queen of Sheba now God in all generation has had his servant and his Prophet or his message somewhere in the earth going at all times God has never been without a witness and in every generation they received a witness of God then if the people received that witness then that is a golden age for that generation if they turn that witness down then it is a dark age for that Generation Now I want to bring just a little bit of understanding and what the prophet of God said here we're looking in the day right now where they have turned down now does that mean the bride of Christ has a dark age no but I want you to understand right now we all understand money I'll just use that as the uh the the breakdown my brother and sister you can go home I won't even quote the numbers to you you can go home and go back and just go back 20 years and compare the value of the dollar then and its purchase power to now and you'll see that our nation is on a downward slide it is coming to the place that they just produce more dollars to do what they want but do you realize it's not just their way of dealing with the debt the debt is intentional you understand that the dead is intentional I'll give you a common example when the theory come into our government on economics that a part of the government would be given X millions or billions of dollars then they told them if you don't use that you will lose it so what did they do they started wasting the money because they want that amount of money next year now where would that Spirit anoint them to go out and literally say waste the money we'll simply add it to the debt but way over here led by the Holy Ghost is a man of God that said this nation is already bankrupt it has sold its Soul amen take those quotes to Congress to the Senate and read them and they'll throw you out on your ear probably find some kind of conspiracy charge against you why because they're anointed to fulfill what the voice that's speaking to them says and the voice that's speaking to you and I is not go buy gold and bury it in your backyard or basement so you can survive the economic downturn is that the voice that's speaking to you and I no sir the voice speaking to you and I is saying Get Ready Get ready I'm coming I'm coming I'll be there for you be ready have your wedding dress all sewn and be prepared cause the day is coming I'm coming for you and we're over here in The Flash come on you're just like me I know you are we're over here in the flesh saying oh my it's getting harder and harder to pay the bills this is happening there and we got a savings account that you know has earned us we had one oh I'll tell you what not a lot of money in any way but sister Jerry and I are so proud We have a savings account that earned us 38 cents last year you know I'm going to plan my future on this money I've put away no my brother and sister there's no future for the bride of Christ but what the vision of the Holy Ghost has given to you and I and it said here take the book eat the book open the book up the book is your life the book is everything you need the book will get you out of here hallelujah amen man I'm telling you what I want to break this down I totally missed that one here let me get back to where I said I was going my brother and sister what's a Dark Age there impacts you and I in lots of factors but what it doesn't impact it as it gets darker there it gets lighter in Beulah Land amen The Grasshoppers and the Flies and the fleas and the river turning to blood and everything is over here in Egypt but over here in the promised land it is the light and the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the life is still flowing and the light is still shining and the bride is still believing in fact she's believing more than ever before Hallelujah [Music] hallelujah hallelujah now look at this let me hurry along here I love this now brother Brandon goes on to a deeper explanation go look it up please read it all I want to make sure you catch it but each generation what does it get its opportunity at the fresh word of God each time amen amen amen that's why I'm just throwing that out of there the quote goes on about how they take the truth and make a denomination and Etc but I want you to just catch that one God has given to you and I a fresh opportunity to catch the revelation of Jesus Christ in this day Hallelujah well my brother and sister what we are today would be if we went back a hundred years 200 years 500 years A Thousand Years see there's no age that God said this is going to be the easiest stage everyone I don't like to do that but I like to be transparent I was listening as I finished up my sermon this morning right before Brother David called and I'm glad he called I don't misunderstand there but I was just finishing the last of my notes and I'm listening to brother Rapp and he was like yeah look back in those ages I I couldn't I I don't know that I could have dealt with it having them shove slivers under my fingernails breaking my bones I don't think I could deal with that I'm glad I'm in this age but I want you to look God looked back down through time had a prophet anointed to preach a message greatest battle ever fought I can't handle the idea being stretched until my bones popped out of joint I mean cut with a thousand little cuts and bleeding slowly to death but I want you to think about Satan he's come right down in this hour and his deception is a thousand little thoughts a thousand little complexes a thousand emotions all kinds of things you can't go anywhere I appreciated what brother Chris preached to us how that they have come so smooth that all they need is a few milliseconds to plant something in your mind is the bride under attack yes she is but as a bride got a defense in this hour amen God's got a defense in this hour and what is it doing right here my brother and sister it's got this opportunity of the fresh word of God his mercies new every morning we get out of bed and we can sit there and the devil would try to come but we can sit there and say you know what thank you Lord amen thank you Lord I Thank you for the word I see this I understand that maybe you read something last night in your Bible or in the message and you didn't understand it but you wake up and you go that's what it means what is it fresh every morning amen hallelujah oh Hallelujah amen sister Ruth will you come Hallelujah would we just stand Saints and I would just ask you in your heart maybe you just speak to the Lord this morning and say Lord what is your vision for me see I don't want I don't want Paul's Vision that's right [Music] many thoughts I thought this morning how wonderful I didn't want him to be memories as it were in the sense that has come to pass but to hear my brother Gideon's Vision to young people his vision to the church his vision for his grandsons brother and sister what is our vision what is our vision today or are we just gonna just kind of shuffle along I'll tell you with my heart lifted up I want to say Lord I want a vision like Simeon had Lord I I don't want to pass from this life kind of a two-edged way to explain this but I want to pass from this life my brother and sister I would desire to be one of those alive and remain at the coming of our Lord Jesus amen but I also don't want to be one that passes from this life till I have met the Lord's Christ face to face till I know him and know that the word has come alive and I am present with him and he is not just present with me but he's in me and he's leading me in guiding me and I just would ask you today just to close your eyes if you would and I I just this is strong upon my heart maybe you slip a hand up and say Lord just open to me Father Lord give me Clarity what what your vision for me is what it is Lord where you're leading me where you're guiding me Lord you called me I know that you've called me to something Lord help me to see it help me to live it father to walk in that Vision let me be a fulfillment of a word in this hour Lord that is my heart's desire today to be like Simeon Lord and walk even in the midst of the people in the Temple and be led they led to you Lord led to the Lord's Christ that I could fulfill my part of this gospel in this hour prophecy Lord that's my heart's desire Lord I pray you disturb our hearts don't let us be a church that is caught in complacency don't let us be a church Lord that is satisfied to be lukewarmed Lord don't let us be a church that hears the word of God but it's not anointed enough to move from our present position [Music] help us Lord help us Lord lay aside every sin that so easily besets us help us the Lord to look at your word and if we don't understand it not to just pass over it and go on it's a stop and say Lord I need to understand you I need to understand your written word let us not be moved Lord I Pray by the Holy Spirit maybe to pray for one but yet we would use the excuse I'm too busy maybe you would call us the workplace or home or car to pray [Music] and we would offer an alternative time Lord maybe you would call upon us to deal with something in our own life and father we would lack the motivation to act upon it all I can say today is Lord forgive us Lord forgive us Lord if you call me let me answer Lord if you move upon my spirit let my spirit respond to you Lord if you call me to change Lord let me with joy change [Music] let me run father to possess the promise Lord let me rise up to the mark of the high holy that is my heart today Lord I don't want to miss the vision I want the vision to be re revealed or reflected in Me Lord father I just lift my hand and I say Lord come and help me Lead Me Lord Jesus Lead Me oh Hallelujah Hallelujah come Hallelujah 188
