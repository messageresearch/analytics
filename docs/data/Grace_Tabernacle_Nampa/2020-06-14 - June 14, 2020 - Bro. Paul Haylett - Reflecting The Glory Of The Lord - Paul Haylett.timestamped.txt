[39:43] hallelujah so good to see each and every
[39:46] one our brother Vasily sister Toma amen
[39:50] praise the Lord well you know any doctor
[39:54] that understands knows he can't heal
[39:57] someone and beautiful to have our
[40:00] brother already back in fellowship with
[40:02] us one to welcome our guests in the
[40:05] foyer god bless you amen
[40:07] pray the Lord just bless you in the
[40:08] service today hallelujah you know it's
[40:12] beautiful Saints you see the very plan
[40:15] of redemption has to have a
[40:17] manifestation you you can't have a
[40:20] business plan and execute it and nothing
[40:24] happened amen
[40:27] God started this plan of redemption and
[40:29] you know I don't want to make it sound
[40:32] like I think it's it's more powerful
[40:35] because the spoken word when it was
[40:37] spoken contained all the power necessary
[40:40] to bring it to pass Amen but look how
[40:44] it's speeding up look how everything is
[40:47] just coming and things are coming to
[40:49] pass very quickly and two sons and
[40:53] daughters of God - those whose eyes are
[40:55] open it's very obvious what is coming to
[40:58] pass many people still saying well we're
[41:01] looking for this and you say what but
[41:03] it's already come well it's not Elijah
[41:05] supposed to come no he's already come
[41:08] amen you see these things are happening
[41:11] and and the world you might say is
[41:13] behind the eight-ball but by God's grace
[41:18] we can look and say this is coming this
[41:21] is coming to see the stages of the plan
[41:26] coming to pass oh it to me it's so
[41:29] beautiful because you see when a prophet
[41:31] come and he spoke the words in that day
[41:34] people grasp that and they said praise
[41:36] the Lord and and they thought it was
[41:38] tomorrow that this was happening and
[41:40] years and decades
[41:42] go by and and it's there but the thing
[41:45] is my brother and sister the word is so
[41:47] powerful then all you got to do is just
[41:51] sit back you don't have to say now what
[41:53] do we got to do to see these things come
[41:54] to pass we set back and we just say Lord
[41:58] in your time in your time lawyer so
[42:02] we're not going to get weary in
[42:04] well-doing we're not going to set down
[42:06] on the job we're not going to say well I
[42:08] guess this didn't happen we're going to
[42:11] just say my God said it I believe it
[42:13] it's finished and when God said he
[42:17] finishes a work my brother and sister he
[42:19] finishes the work amen hallelujah
[42:22] hallelujah well praise the Lord you know
[42:26] I heard sister Jerry and sister Emmie
[42:28] practice that song yesterday but I'm
[42:31] telling you I had no clue how closely
[42:34] that coincided with what I wanted to
[42:36] speak today it just totally flew over my
[42:39] head when I heard them practicing it and
[42:41] then I'm sitting here hearing them
[42:43] singing it and thinking wow I couldn't
[42:47] have asked for a better song if I just
[42:48] said sister Jerry wants you to sing
[42:50] about my sermon but you see it's not my
[42:53] sermon it's God's sermon and so we would
[42:55] have had to have said you know sing
[42:57] about what God wants to speak today amen
[43:00] redemptions manifestation amen I I never
[43:04] was you know I always find a little
[43:06] humor thank you so much god bless you
[43:09] I find a little humor sometimes I've
[43:11] heard people say you know brother Donnie
[43:14] preaching on such-and-such part 257 I
[43:19] almost feel like I've wore out my
[43:21] thoughts on redemptions manifestation
[43:23] but we can't this was all about the plan
[43:28] of redemption this is all about
[43:31] redemption being revealed to you and I
[43:35] oh isn't that beautiful hallelujah
[43:38] I'd like to speak to you this morning on
[43:41] reflecting the glory of the Lord let's
[43:43] turn in 2nd Corinthians the 3rd chapter
[43:46] verses 1 through 18 now I use this very
[43:50] scripture on on Wednesday night but I
[43:55] I'm kind of dividing this thought off
[43:58] because this scripture kind of covers
[44:01] where I was at on Wednesday night but it
[44:04] also takes us at the latter verses of
[44:07] this where we want to be today amen and
[44:11] so I just say to each and everyone god
[44:13] bless you we love you in the Lord and I
[44:15] just pray that you know in spite of all
[44:18] this virus and all the things that
[44:20] they're doing the Christian life will
[44:23] never be muzzled by the things of this
[44:26] world no health pandemic no falls or
[44:30] Rises of a government none of that will
[44:33] ever hinder or bind the Christian life
[44:36] amen because that life is buried deep in
[44:41] Christ and we are in Christ so therefore
[44:46] the life is in us amen and as we read
[44:50] the other night you see Satan cannot
[44:52] defeat the Spirit of the Lord so he'll
[44:56] just attack you but remember while he's
[45:00] attacking you that the Spirit of the
[45:02] Lord is in you it is your very life so
[45:05] he can't defeat the Spirit of the Lord
[45:07] facing the Lord he knows he can't defeat
[45:11] you unless you let him so Lord has
[45:13] helped us to lift our hands and praise
[45:15] him in the good times and the bad times
[45:17] and whatever struggle there might be we
[45:20] just come and say III just Lord Here I
[45:23] am now I don't like to take other
[45:26] people's thoughts and other people's
[45:27] words without credit being due but I was
[45:30] listening to brother Danny steamin
[45:32] preached this morning and for just a few
[45:35] minutes it's a long story on how I come
[45:37] to that but my brother and sister he
[45:39] made a statement and then I just latched
[45:41] on to and he said we come on the basis
[45:44] we've been taught and come on the basis
[45:46] of only belief right
[45:50] we don't come and say well now if I can
[45:53] somehow take a science book or I can
[45:55] take something here and prove it we look
[45:58] at the Bible we believe the Bible only
[46:02] believe but brother Danny turned it
[46:05] around and he said the problem is we
[46:07] listen to too many voices we listen to
[46:09] too much
[46:09] other stuff and he says we've come to
[46:11] the place that we we only believe but
[46:14] what about this and what about that he
[46:16] said let's turn those words around only
[46:19] believe he said also believe only Amen
[46:23] not the Bible Plus Amen not the Bible in
[46:28] this opinion not the Bible and that
[46:31] opinion Amen only believe believe only
[46:35] this is sufficient hallelujah hallelujah
[46:40] amen second Corinthians a third chapter
[46:43] we'll read a few verses and allow you to
[46:45] be seated Amen do we begin again to
[46:50] commend ourselves or need we as some
[46:53] others epistles of commendation to you
[46:55] or letters of commendation from you ye
[46:58] are our epistle written in our hearts
[47:00] known in read of all men for as much as
[47:04] ye are manifestly declared to be the
[47:06] Epistle of Christ ministered by US Steel
[47:09] you know I just Saints I want to
[47:12] interject this I think that people if
[47:15] the Apostle Paul was standing here today
[47:18] would have a struggle with Paul they
[47:21] would think you think too much of
[47:23] yourself but my brother and sister Paul
[47:27] was just a vessel amen what God poured
[47:32] in Paul poured out hallelujah and that's
[47:36] what we are amen for as much as ye are
[47:44] manifestly declared to be the Epistle of
[47:46] Christ ministered by US written not with
[47:48] ink but with the spirit of the Living
[47:51] God not on not in tables of stone Amen
[47:56] now I don't remember if I included that
[47:58] or not but I read the scriptures this
[47:59] morning you see God is taking our stony
[48:02] heart amen
[48:05] you see he's not writing it on stone
[48:09] Amen he needs someone who says Lord I'm
[48:13] just human and I fail you but I'm not
[48:17] going to quit
[48:18] a man that's what he's looking for well
[48:21] the one with that attitude of the Lord I
[48:23] make mistakes and I've made some pretty
[48:25] big ones but what separates me from many
[48:28] people is Lord I can't quit
[48:31] amen thank you lord Alleluia so it's not
[48:36] a matter of the who's perfect among us
[48:38] but it's whose heart has been turned
[48:40] from stone amen
[48:43] into the fleshly table of the heart and
[48:47] as such trust have we through Christ to
[48:50] God were not that we are sufficient of
[48:52] ourselves to think anything as of
[48:55] ourselves but our sufficiency is of God
[48:58] who also has made us able ministers of
[49:02] the New Testament not of the letter but
[49:05] of the spirit for the letter killeth but
[49:08] the spirit amen
[49:10] what it was the spirit that wrote on
[49:12] your heart amen
[49:15] is also the spirit that giveth life to
[49:18] you amen so it's not God wrote something
[49:22] on your heart you failed he cuts off the
[49:24] life
[49:25] no he writes it on your heart and he
[49:27] keeps putting the life into you to live
[49:31] up to what he put on your heart Oh
[49:33] hallelujah but if the stration of death
[49:39] written and engraven in stones was
[49:40] glorious
[49:41] you know that's reference to the ten
[49:43] commandments because no man could live
[49:46] it was glorious ten commandments are
[49:52] glorious I don't care how much time has
[49:54] passed my brother and sister the Ten
[49:56] Commandments still apply and if we're
[49:58] obedient to them amen not as unto the
[50:02] law but as on a desire to please God
[50:05] amen because if you do it as low law now
[50:08] you know I put this when I think about
[50:10] doing things as unto the law right we've
[50:13] been taught that we should obey the law
[50:14] given to Caesar what is Caesar's but how
[50:17] many of you spent last week you see how
[50:22] technical that could get
[50:24] oh ma I failed because I drove over the
[50:27] speed limit well if your intent was to
[50:30] drive over the speed limit
[50:31] you know I don't care what the law says
[50:33] I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do something's
[50:35] wrong
[50:36] but you see under the law mr. policeman
[50:40] radars you and says I'm writing you a
[50:41] ticket under grace mr. policeman comes
[50:44] to you and says I know you were probably
[50:47] preoccupied you know and what you were
[50:49] driving a little fast but I'm gonna let
[50:53] you off today with this little warning
[50:54] that that's not good to do see how many
[50:58] types that there is from the Word of God
[51:00] that comes right down in our natural
[51:01] life hallelujah but if the
[51:08] administration of death written engraven
[51:09] in stones was glorious so that the
[51:11] children of Israel could not steadfastly
[51:13] behold the face of Moses for the glory
[51:15] of his countenance which glory was to be
[51:17] done away how shall the ministration of
[51:20] the Spirit be rather glorious Heavenly
[51:23] Father we ask you for your blessings
[51:25] this morning Lord may you come down
[51:27] father rich in mercy Lord we ask you to
[51:30] come in our midst this morning you know
[51:31] what our needs are father Lord we don't
[51:34] need someone to stand in the pulpit Lord
[51:36] and and hammer away at us of our faults
[51:38] and failures what we need Lord is for
[51:40] you to come down and minister to our
[51:42] hearts this morning father that we can
[51:44] walk out Lord with liberty Lord knowing
[51:47] that we live under your auspices in your
[51:52] mercy father we thank you bless all that
[51:55] are here today may we enter in I pray in
[51:57] the name of Jesus Christ amen
[51:59] you may be seated
[52:05] you know I tell you my brother and
[52:07] sister I sometimes my mind and I hope I
[52:09] don't lose people when I do this but
[52:11] sometimes my mind is almost you know
[52:14] like a like a a net you know when we
[52:19] raised alfalfa seed you spend a lot of
[52:22] time out there in the field just
[52:24] sweeping a net to see what kind of
[52:26] little bugs might be crawling around in
[52:29] your crop and you you catch all kinds of
[52:32] things in there and just as a prophet of
[52:34] God opened it up said there's three
[52:35] kinds of believers my brother and sister
[52:38] you'll be out there with the net
[52:39] sweeping and you catch ladybugs and you
[52:42] also catch like us and so we look at
[52:44] that and realize that as we are here the
[52:47] Word of God God allows us to be able to
[52:49] come here in the word and later you
[52:52] might say in time we catch a point from
[52:54] over here and realize how those are
[52:56] connected together and so sometimes it's
[52:59] line and we go for a little season and
[53:02] another line of precept upon a precept
[53:04] and a word upon a word but ultimately
[53:07] God's coming and bringing continuity in
[53:09] his word that we realized the whole plan
[53:12] of God we start to see the opening of
[53:15] the word and what God has done for us
[53:17] and and it comes together you know this
[53:19] is how a child starts off which is
[53:21] playing with blocks with numbers on them
[53:23] and pretty soon they're designing the
[53:25] block amen so that's the progression
[53:28] that God has brought in to the bride of
[53:30] Jesus Christ and his word is opening to
[53:33] us in a progression amen for if the
[53:36] ministration of condemnation now my
[53:39] brother and sister living under the law
[53:41] would bring a season or a time of
[53:43] condemnation right when you knew I am
[53:46] wrong and many people as they would come
[53:49] now you know we see the word how it
[53:52] brings out and they would bring the lamb
[53:54] offering for their sin and you know a
[53:57] year later the priest might look out and
[53:59] might remember that man and the man
[54:01] might be coming and offering a lamb once
[54:04] again for the very sin that he brought a
[54:07] lamb for last year and that would have
[54:10] carried on in their life not really
[54:12] changing just the lamb become the
[54:14] covering for their sin but yet under the
[54:18] under the administration of the law
[54:20] which what brought condemnation it was
[54:22] actually glorious because it brought the
[54:24] people face to face with what was the
[54:27] issue of their life and my brother sir
[54:30] if we are honest with ourselves today we
[54:32] would lift a hand and say Lord bring me
[54:34] face to face
[54:36] with the issues of my life I don't want
[54:38] to bury my issue I don't want to leave
[54:40] it behind I don't want to forget about
[54:42] it to have it resurfaced many time
[54:45] sometime in the future but Lord let me
[54:47] come face to face with that and deal
[54:50] with it amen because we are no longer
[54:52] called to live under condemnation much
[54:55] more dust administration of
[54:57] righteousness exceed in glory so my
[55:00] brother and sister who would want to
[55:02] live under the law when you could live
[55:04] by the Spirit of the Lord in a Liberty
[55:07] knowing that God has ordained you from
[55:09] the foundation of the world
[55:10] to be an overcomer in the day that we
[55:13] live in amen so as we look here we'll
[55:15] see now for even that which was made
[55:18] glorious had no glory in this respect my
[55:21] reason of the glory that Excel it's so
[55:23] if one thing is glorious but you are in
[55:25] the presence of something much more
[55:27] glorious you're not going to sit there
[55:29] and look back to this lesser glory as it
[55:32] were and focus on it but you're gonna
[55:34] look to those things that are more
[55:36] glorious amen seeing then that we have
[55:38] such hope we use great plainness of
[55:41] speech I like this my brother and sister
[55:44] the Apostle Paul you know he moved from
[55:46] a point as it was that he was giving
[55:49] milk as it were to Pentecostal babies he
[55:52] was giving people that were coming God
[55:54] dealing them and pouring out the milk
[55:56] but Paul says we made a shift we have
[55:59] moved to a place that now we can move
[56:01] from just hinting these things to you
[56:04] that we can speak it directly we don't
[56:07] have to come and sugarcoat it any longer
[56:09] we don't have to come and make it
[56:11] palatable to you but we'll give this to
[56:14] you in a plainness of speech that you as
[56:17] a son or daughter of God can look at
[56:19] that and say you know that hurt I need
[56:22] to I need to you know as they use the
[56:24] phrase I need to raise my game but my
[56:26] brother and sister that's not going to
[56:27] cause you to turn away you simply bow a
[56:29] head lift
[56:30] and say Lord forgive me I'm gonna rise
[56:33] up to the standard that you have called
[56:35] me to amen you know that's the problem I
[56:37] don't I don't want to go this way but I
[56:39] want to just say this this morning
[56:40] that's the problem with many of the
[56:42] churches on the earth today is they
[56:45] don't want to offend the people they
[56:47] don't want to cause anybody to be
[56:49] uncomfortable and so they sugarcoat the
[56:52] gospel to the point it's no longer
[56:54] effective a man that is almost I read a
[56:57] little deal here a while back
[56:58] a man was talking about the medicine he
[57:02] took for his diabetes and he said you
[57:05] know this stuff is so horrible it was
[57:07] some kind of a liquid and he said this
[57:09] stuff is so horrible he says I need to
[57:10] add some sugar or something to make this
[57:12] edible amen well my brother and sister
[57:15] if we do that with the gospel we
[57:18] sugarcoat the gospel to make it
[57:20] palatable to us and we take all the
[57:22] effectiveness out of it then we might as
[57:25] well just say we are a club and and you
[57:28] know whatever instead of paying ties you
[57:30] could pay a membership fee amen so you
[57:32] look at these kind of things my brother
[57:34] and sister and realize what God is doing
[57:36] so in the beauty of this amen Moses in
[57:40] such glory not as Moses my brother and
[57:43] sister would put a veil over his face
[57:45] that the children of Israel could not
[57:46] stedfastly look to the end of that which
[57:49] is abolished but their minds were
[57:51] blinded now I want to ask you real quick
[57:53] just in case I forget it a little later
[57:55] in my notes I want to ask you which is
[57:58] worse a man who is natural eyesight he
[58:00] is blinded or a man who is spiritually
[58:03] blinded amen just think about it I would
[58:07] rather finish the days of my life
[58:09] blind in the natural but my heart opened
[58:13] to the Word of God to the presence of
[58:15] God amen hallelujah for until this day
[58:21] remaineth the same vail untaken away in
[58:23] the reading of the Old Testament which
[58:25] Vail is done away in Christ so the very
[58:28] word of God is telling us that it is and
[58:31] we know this pertains to Israel but it
[58:33] also comes over into the Gentile world
[58:36] that my brother and sister at Vail that
[58:38] was there hallelujah now Vail that was
[58:42] blinding them the word says
[58:44] that veil has been taken away so we
[58:48] don't need an excuse of I got a veil
[58:50] what we need to do is pray for
[58:52] revelation amen the veil is gone the
[58:55] Word says so not hope not the message
[58:57] not someone else the Lord says that veil
[59:00] is taken away amen so we don't need a
[59:04] don't settle for well I just don't see
[59:06] it if it's there in the Word of God
[59:08] somebody presents it to you your first
[59:10] action ought to be to go to the Lord and
[59:12] say Lord it's in your word reveal it to
[59:14] me Lord I want to see that I want to see
[59:17] this
[59:17] but you see Israel to this very day my
[59:20] brother and sister still blinded the
[59:22] gospel being preached there's been many
[59:24] have gone there and preached and and the
[59:26] they are still veiled behind that veil
[59:28] but look we don't want to circumvent
[59:30] that some people say well we ought to go
[59:32] make a great presentation of the gospel
[59:34] to the to the Jews and whatever but look
[59:37] we can't push God's program amen let's
[59:40] just sit back and let's pray because it
[59:43] will come to pass but there's a secret
[59:45] Amen that's veiled in the word because
[59:47] you see my brother and sister the full
[59:49] opening of the word to them cannot take
[59:52] place until the full opening of the word
[59:54] has come to us everything in God's time
[59:58] everything in God's season amen so we
[1:00:01] cannot circumvent the plan of God and
[1:00:03] say well we'll go and take the veil from
[1:00:06] their eyes no you can't do that you can
[1:00:08] preach Jesus Christ to them all you want
[1:00:11] to preach and they still will not be
[1:00:13] able to see it amen hallelujah
[1:00:16] but even unto this day when Moses is
[1:00:20] read the veil is upon their heart
[1:00:22] nevertheless when there shall turn to
[1:00:24] the Lord the veil shall be taken away
[1:00:26] now the Lord is that spirit and where
[1:00:28] the Spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:00:31] Liberty can someone say Amen this
[1:00:33] morning but we all I love this and now
[1:00:36] this is part I'm trying to scroll the
[1:00:38] screen here hold mine but we all with
[1:00:41] open face beholding as in a glass
[1:00:44] Amen have you ever looked through that
[1:00:48] that glass hard to look through not a
[1:00:53] perfect image you cannot get a perfect
[1:00:58] reflection from something that is beyond
[1:01:01] the glass through the glass are you with
[1:01:06] me but we all with an open face this is
[1:01:11] meaning that we all with good conscience
[1:01:13] amen we don't have some kind of a idea
[1:01:16] some kind of a plan some kind of theory
[1:01:17] but we with an open face beholding as in
[1:01:19] a glass the glory of the Lord are
[1:01:22] changed into the same image Oh
[1:01:25] hallelujah I might not see clearly the
[1:01:28] image right now but I have a promise of
[1:01:31] God's Word
[1:01:32] I'm gonna be changed into that image
[1:01:34] hallelujah so one man says this is the
[1:01:37] image another says this is the image I'm
[1:01:39] sorry I'm not listening to you I know
[1:01:41] that the word has said that I would be
[1:01:44] changed into the same image from glory
[1:01:47] to glory even as by the Spirit of the
[1:01:50] Lord hallelujah the Holy Ghost in orme
[1:01:53] it's coming down moving changing you
[1:01:55] changing me molding us into the very
[1:01:58] image of Jesus Christ amen
[1:02:01] hallelujah we ask Lord for your
[1:02:03] blessings upon the word today amen
[1:02:06] hallelujah oh you know I sometimes just
[1:02:09] get a little excited forgive me you know
[1:02:11] I was sitting there this morning I
[1:02:13] thought my honest I just felt like I got
[1:02:16] up way too early and I said they're just
[1:02:18] kind of hard time to wrap my thoughts
[1:02:21] and and you know as I was trying to
[1:02:23] finish up this thought this morning and
[1:02:24] and I was just like lord I need you to
[1:02:26] help me and I tell you come right down
[1:02:28] and all of a sudden I just I don't even
[1:02:30] know how to describe it to you just had
[1:02:32] a big smile on my face and just seemed
[1:02:34] like everything just just started
[1:02:36] falling in place and and I pray today
[1:02:38] that I can I can express it it won't be
[1:02:40] an inadequacy of the word if there's any
[1:02:43] inadequacy this morning it will be in my
[1:02:45] expression of it to you amen now look my
[1:02:48] brother and sister brother Brown speaks
[1:02:50] in the ephesian church age he talks
[1:02:52] about of reason and purpose of being
[1:02:54] said youthful that God is a redeemer he
[1:02:57] needed someone to redeem he he needed a
[1:03:00] reason or purpose of being he wanted to
[1:03:02] be a healer so he needed some
[1:03:04] that needed healing a man needed someone
[1:03:06] that needed saved Amen so we looked at
[1:03:09] and realized now we're not trying to
[1:03:11] apply the human element of reason and
[1:03:14] purpose to our Lord but to God but my
[1:03:17] brother and sister to understand that we
[1:03:19] were created in His image and oftentimes
[1:03:23] it you know we we need to to express
[1:03:26] ourself we need to do something you know
[1:03:28] oftentimes I would just say this you
[1:03:33] know there's something in us that we
[1:03:35] want to do and you'll find someone that
[1:03:37] the words flow easily to them and they
[1:03:41] realize over a period of time that they
[1:03:43] love to write poetry that had to be
[1:03:46] something in them that needed to be
[1:03:48] expressed because I have never in my
[1:03:50] life ever wanted to write poetry so
[1:03:53] there's not something within me if you
[1:03:55] follow what I'm saying
[1:03:56] so it's not in me to to write poetry but
[1:03:59] I realized later on in life as you know
[1:04:03] I started to minister started to pastor
[1:04:05] the church and that the desire to
[1:04:07] express things has been in me since I
[1:04:10] was a little boy my own family used to
[1:04:12] say my you know if we could ever get him
[1:04:14] to shut up you know but that was in me
[1:04:17] just a real desire to express things to
[1:04:20] speak it out and you know it's in each
[1:04:23] one of us and so here is here we are and
[1:04:27] the image of God and so if God had a
[1:04:30] reason needed or wanted a reason or
[1:04:32] purpose of being amen his plan to be our
[1:04:36] Redeemer now my brother and sister if
[1:04:38] God chose not to be a healer that was
[1:04:40] his decision amen but it was in him to
[1:04:44] be a healer so that had to come out amen
[1:04:46] and it was in him amen the joy that we
[1:04:50] possess as sons and daughters of God is
[1:04:53] not a joy that we have naturally but it
[1:04:55] is a joy that was in God to have a
[1:04:58] creation and have a people that he could
[1:05:01] serve amen
[1:05:02] now we look at this you say now what did
[1:05:04] you say is serving us well my brother
[1:05:06] and sister does he not our God
[1:05:09] constantly is serving us he sees a need
[1:05:11] he comes and he brings something to deal
[1:05:14] with our need if that is not a heart of
[1:05:17] a
[1:05:17] servant then I don't know what is he
[1:05:19] does not want to see his children suffer
[1:05:22] he does not sometimes he allows those
[1:05:24] things to maybe break a very willful
[1:05:26] spirit a stubborn spirit God would allow
[1:05:29] those things as the hedge was opened
[1:05:31] with Joel but my brother and sister of
[1:05:34] God is a serving God amen and so the
[1:05:36] very desire to serve a people which is
[1:05:40] asked the Redeem amen he placed in us
[1:05:43] that we turn around and if a man is
[1:05:45] serving God today a man or a woman boy
[1:05:47] or girl serving God today out of a fear
[1:05:50] of going to hell then you have missed
[1:05:52] the very Spirit of God because God said
[1:05:55] no I put this in you your desire to
[1:05:59] serve amen not to be a slave but the
[1:06:04] desire to serve people sometimes say
[1:06:06] well you know they talk like well you'll
[1:06:08] be a servant my brother and sister being
[1:06:09] a servant is a glorious position amen
[1:06:12] so a servant that truly knows how to
[1:06:14] serve let me just put it this way you
[1:06:17] can go into a restaurant a lovely place
[1:06:19] the flowers the candles anniversary
[1:06:22] birthday whatever it might be and a poor
[1:06:25] servant can ruin your whole evening amen
[1:06:33] now my brother and sister a poor servant
[1:06:37] in the house of God could take a Sunday
[1:06:39] morning which we've already felt the
[1:06:41] presence of God moving arm is a poor
[1:06:44] serve could take that moving of the Holy
[1:06:46] Spirit and leave it flat and dry and the
[1:06:49] people go home wondering what happened
[1:06:50] today do you see it's all in the nature
[1:06:53] or desire of the servant amen so if
[1:06:56] we'll come with a servant's heart Lord
[1:06:58] you serve us you bring your word you
[1:07:00] save us you heal us you provide for us
[1:07:03] now Lord not out of obligation but out
[1:07:06] of a heart's desire I come back to serve
[1:07:09] you I come back to to be obedient to
[1:07:12] your word as a form of service because I
[1:07:15] love you Lord too many people are caught
[1:07:17] up in this I got to this and I got to
[1:07:20] that I remember one time hearing an
[1:07:22] individual say well I you know our
[1:07:24] church says well my brother and sister
[1:07:27] they've missed it because it's not the
[1:07:30] church that should be saying
[1:07:31] you should be saying my Lord said Amen I
[1:07:34] saw in his word and he spoke to me that
[1:07:37] he wants me to do this and this to quit
[1:07:40] doing this and this and you know serve
[1:07:42] Him with all my heart mind body and soul
[1:07:44] amen
[1:07:45] so we see now as it is of the reason and
[1:07:49] purpose of being if we as Christians do
[1:07:52] not find our reason and purpose of being
[1:07:54] my brother and sister then we'll be
[1:07:56] faithful in church we'll do all those
[1:07:58] things that we're called to give but
[1:08:00] never reap the full benefit of what God
[1:08:03] intended for us to have from that Amen
[1:08:06] now look this message of restoration
[1:08:10] look it's not just another religious
[1:08:12] movement what the earth does not need is
[1:08:14] another religious movement we've already
[1:08:17] got so many people are confused because
[1:08:19] this church says this and the church
[1:08:21] just down the street says this - this or
[1:08:24] this Plus this or this and that and
[1:08:26] people are confused legitimately
[1:08:28] confused I don't know whether I should
[1:08:30] this I don't know whether I should that
[1:08:32] I don't know you know because this one
[1:08:34] says this but my brother and sister when
[1:08:36] you come to the place that the message
[1:08:39] of restoration is getting us right very
[1:08:42] simple here nothing deep today
[1:08:43] getting us right back to the word right
[1:08:45] let the word become your absolute amen
[1:08:49] it don't need to be this Minister on the
[1:08:51] radio this Minister on the television
[1:08:54] this minister in this church what did
[1:08:56] the Word of God say right this is God in
[1:08:59] written form speaking to you and I amen
[1:09:02] and we cannot as we well know hey man
[1:09:04] I'm just going back to stir up your pure
[1:09:06] Minds and remembrance as we well know my
[1:09:08] brother and sister God will not
[1:09:10] contradict his Bible now when you look
[1:09:15] at this I just love this revelations 19
[1:09:19] is actually one of my favorite
[1:09:21] scriptures chapters of the Bible amen
[1:09:25] verse 7 is actually would rank right at
[1:09:28] the top of my favorite scriptures he
[1:09:31] says after these things I heard a great
[1:09:33] voice of much people in heaven saying
[1:09:34] Alleluia salvation and glory and honor
[1:09:37] and power unto the Lord our God for a
[1:09:40] true and righteous are his judgments now
[1:09:43] my brother and sister he concern
[1:09:45] earns me when I look in the world today
[1:09:47] I don't get much sister Jerry and I are
[1:09:49] just slowly pulling away from any kinds
[1:09:51] of social medias any real influence in
[1:09:54] our life but my brother and sister when
[1:09:56] you have people that feel like and they
[1:09:58] will voice it they'll put it in print
[1:10:00] push send or whatever it is and send it
[1:10:02] to the whole wide world that they think
[1:10:04] God is harsh now my brother and sisters
[1:10:08] there knowing a different side of God
[1:10:10] than I know because while God has if I
[1:10:14] could put it in this as sound like I'm
[1:10:15] contradicting myself but I can tell you
[1:10:18] an own testimony of years gone by that
[1:10:20] God will break your body to get your
[1:10:23] attention oh just like the shepherd with
[1:10:27] a little lamb that keeps wandering off
[1:10:29] well after a while break its leg so that
[1:10:31] he gets to hold it carry it and my I'll
[1:10:34] tell you my god and I'm standing here
[1:10:36] doubt 58 years old and I'll tell you
[1:10:39] thank you Lord for about tearing my
[1:10:40] right leg off my body amen because
[1:10:43] that's one of the things it took to
[1:10:45] catch my attention to realize I was
[1:10:48] going down the wrong path and many
[1:10:50] things were not not good amen hallelujah
[1:10:54] so you look at this now for true and
[1:10:57] righteous or his judgment he had judged
[1:11:00] the great which did corrupt the
[1:11:02] earth with her fornication has avenged
[1:11:04] the blood of his servants at her hand
[1:11:06] and again they say Alleluia and her
[1:11:09] smoke rose up forever and ever and the
[1:11:12] four and twenty elders and four beasts
[1:11:14] fell down and worshiped God that sat on
[1:11:16] the throne saying amen
[1:11:17] Alleluia and a voice came out of the
[1:11:21] throne now you see my brother and sister
[1:11:24] this would not have been God Himself
[1:11:27] speaking saying praise me praise me come
[1:11:33] on praise me but it would be the Spirit
[1:11:38] of God
[1:11:41] because the Spirit of God is life and
[1:11:43] you can't have life and not praise Him
[1:11:48] now look many times I've kind of maybe
[1:11:51] harass maybe somebody I heard the word
[1:11:53] harassed used once that brother Paul
[1:11:55] harasses us to worship the Lord well if
[1:11:58] you view that as harassment then well
[1:12:00] I'll tell you what you won't know what
[1:12:02] to do when I finally decide to harass
[1:12:03] amen you see you cannot serve God and
[1:12:06] not worship Him it's just an
[1:12:09] impossibility there is just no way to
[1:12:12] truly serve God from the depths of your
[1:12:15] soul and not something rise up in you to
[1:12:18] praise God amen it's just an
[1:12:21] impossibility and a voice came out of
[1:12:23] the throne saying praise our God all ye
[1:12:26] is servants either fear Him both small
[1:12:28] and great now look my brother and sister
[1:12:30] however you want to interpret this a
[1:12:32] voice come from the throne I'm not
[1:12:33] trying to dictate nothing to you but
[1:12:35] it's the Spirit of God that leads sons
[1:12:38] and daughters of God amen we're not led
[1:12:41] by any other spirit there's not an angel
[1:12:43] that just comes down from heaven and
[1:12:45] says well I just thought I'd do God a
[1:12:47] favor and tell you to do something no
[1:12:49] they go where they are sent Amen where
[1:12:53] they are led amen when God says I want
[1:12:56] you to go speak I want you to go do they
[1:12:59] do that upon the commandment of God amen
[1:13:02] so this is not another voice and as I
[1:13:06] heard it were the voices of a great
[1:13:07] multitude and the voice of many waters
[1:13:09] is a voice of mighty thunderings saying
[1:13:11] Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent
[1:13:14] reigneth
[1:13:15] let us hmm hallelujah let us be sad
[1:13:21] downcast and downtrodden and unable to
[1:13:24] lift our hands unable to lift our voices
[1:13:26] unable to stomp a foot unable know my
[1:13:30] brother and sister not some new-age
[1:13:33] interpretation of the Bible but this
[1:13:35] says here let us be glad hallelujah and
[1:13:39] rejoice hallelujah that all my goodness
[1:13:43] and give our little honor to him oh how
[1:13:48] do you give honor my brother and sister
[1:13:50] you give honor by give
[1:13:54] back the praise that God said I poured
[1:13:58] myself into you and that filling you up
[1:14:02] are able to give that back and my
[1:14:05] brother and sister let me put it this
[1:14:07] way in a natural Webster dictionary form
[1:14:09] of giving honor that is to speak in a
[1:14:13] high and lofty manner of praise of the
[1:14:17] character of the one being spoken about
[1:14:22] hallelujah my god is good my god is
[1:14:25] awesome my god is a glorious beyond
[1:14:28] measure
[1:14:30] hallelujah I want to give honor to him I
[1:14:33] don't want to talk about I wish God
[1:14:35] would do this and I wish God would do
[1:14:36] that I say thank you lord
[1:14:39] then I've got breath in this body life
[1:14:41] in this body to lift you up and praise
[1:14:44] your name hallelujah Oh for the marriage
[1:14:50] of the Lamb that come now if we cut that
[1:14:52] scripture off right there and we didn't
[1:14:54] speak no more that ought to be enough to
[1:14:57] take every son and daughter of God and
[1:14:58] make them come to the place that they
[1:15:00] would say Lord I want to be ready if the
[1:15:03] wedding is happening Lord I want my
[1:15:06] dress on Lord if you are moving in the
[1:15:08] midst of your people then I want to be
[1:15:11] open to receive of that that ought to
[1:15:13] move us enough without even the last
[1:15:15] line but look at this and his wife who
[1:15:18] is she who is she Saints I think we
[1:15:22] should know who she is
[1:15:23] we are his wife amen
[1:15:27] and what did she do she put her feet to
[1:15:31] action she didn't sit back and say well
[1:15:34] when the bridegroom comes and brings me
[1:15:37] a wedding dress and when he comes and
[1:15:39] does this and when he comes and does
[1:15:41] that and when he speaks this and speaks
[1:15:43] that what does she do she said you know
[1:15:45] what there's going to be a marriage of
[1:15:47] the Lamb
[1:15:48] it's going to happen the word senseful
[1:15:50] there's going to be a marriage of the
[1:15:52] Lamb and I am his wife and I'm going to
[1:15:55] be ready there is nothing that has
[1:15:58] stopped me from being ready
[1:16:01] allelujah I'll tell you what no girl
[1:16:04] that ever was serious about getting
[1:16:06] married sit back and said well I've got

[1:16:55] pushed out in the garage because they
[1:16:56] filled the house full of everything to
[1:16:58] do with my daughter's wedding oh I think
[1:17:01] it's a perfect type my brother and
[1:17:03] sister amen the bride she's not waiting
[1:17:07] that was the foolish virgin amen we got
[1:17:10] to learn to separate that the foolish
[1:17:11] virgin was the one that said well I've
[1:17:14] got a lamp and I've got a vessel and I
[1:17:16] know that he's gonna come but
[1:17:18] everything's good life is good god is
[1:17:20] good but no oil burn off him that's not
[1:17:25] who we are

[1:17:30] give honor to him for the marriage of
[1:17:31] the lamb has come and his wife Helen
[1:17:34] lujah has made herself ready now look
[1:17:39] what's happened by the very act of
[1:17:42] making herself ready was granted to her
[1:17:45] that she would be arrayed in fine linen
[1:17:50] it's kind of it's kind of an interesting
[1:17:55] thing it's kind of I don't know if you'd
[1:17:59] call it a fad or whatever but many a
[1:18:01] young lady now partly I think it's
[1:18:03] because of the condition of the economy
[1:18:05] but many young lady is getting married
[1:18:08] in and you might say secondhand dress
[1:18:12] now if you're thinking about this
[1:18:14] natural
[1:18:15] whatever please don't lock this down
[1:18:17] like I'm opposed to this but you see the
[1:18:21] Bride of Christ is not going to be
[1:18:24] married in a secondhand dress
[1:18:30] now you say brother Paul what are you
[1:18:32] getting at well I would be getting at
[1:18:35] you getting married to the Lord Jesus
[1:18:39] Christ based on someone else's testimony
[1:18:44] can't happen can't happen you yourself
[1:18:50] have to come see you've made the
[1:18:52] preparation and to you is granted that
[1:18:55] you would be arrayed in the fine linen
[1:18:58] of the pure Word of God not somebody
[1:19:01] said that somebody said not that
[1:19:05] somebody says I was with a prophet I was
[1:19:07] with this one I was with that one
[1:19:09] my brother's sister that won't do it
[1:19:10] we're not called as the Bride of Christ
[1:19:12] to get married in a secondhand dress
[1:19:15] when the natural is that's an entirely
[1:19:19] different thing amen but you look at
[1:19:22] this now fine linen clean and white fine
[1:19:25] linen is my pastors righteousness the
[1:19:33] prophets righteousness brother Solon's
[1:19:36] whose righteousness no sir no sir Amen
[1:19:40] this fine linen is the righteousness of
[1:19:43] saints hallelujah I say let's thank the
[1:19:46] Lord for that hallelujah I love I love I
[1:19:52] respect many a man Amen that many a
[1:19:55] men's had influence on my life but my
[1:19:58] brother and sister by the grace of God
[1:20:00] learned many years ago I got to move on
[1:20:02] till this is real to me amen till this
[1:20:06] has been revealed to me I can't take it
[1:20:09] that someone says this is this and this
[1:20:11] is that you know it's just like a young
[1:20:13] man we were talking to the other day he
[1:20:15] said there was a time he said I remember
[1:20:17] in the message where everybody said you
[1:20:19] know now you have to see the third poll
[1:20:21] if you don't believe the third poll
[1:20:23] you're not the bride you're not going in
[1:20:24] a rapture and you know what that's
[1:20:26] correct that's just the opening of the
[1:20:28] hey let's not make it more complicated
[1:20:30] it is God promised he would open word to
[1:20:33] you and I amen but when you say yeah if
[1:20:35] you believe the third Pole everything's
[1:20:37] good God opened his word hallelujah I'm
[1:20:40] saved huh what did the word that was
[1:20:44] open say where do you fit in the opened
[1:20:49] word hey man you can't just say I
[1:20:52] believe it I believe it it's gotta be
[1:20:53] someplace in there you find yourself
[1:20:57] Amen now I'm not speaking here I believe
[1:20:59] we're amongst godly people but my
[1:21:01] brother and sister you know you might
[1:21:03] have taken the same word and that same
[1:21:05] word might send one man to heaven send
[1:21:07] another man to hell you can't just say
[1:21:09] oh I believe that what do you believe
[1:21:11] amen
[1:21:13] let's not do a generality amen Oh
[1:21:17] lelou yeah and he said unto me write
[1:21:19] blessed are they which are called oh
[1:21:22] look how blessed we are today saying
[1:21:25] that God would just be gracious enough
[1:21:27] to put on our heart and we would desire
[1:21:30] to be a part of this hey man blessed are
[1:21:34] they which are called unto the marriage
[1:21:35] supper of the lamb and he saith unto me
[1:21:37] these are the true sayings of God now as
[1:21:41] we're speaking this morning amen
[1:21:43] we are talking about coming or being the
[1:21:46] reflecting the glory of the Lord now my
[1:21:49] brother and sister if we are here a
[1:21:51] clothed now in the righteousness of
[1:21:54] saints then that is going to produce
[1:21:57] something in us now this is quite some
[1:22:00] time back I just draw the thought but we
[1:22:02] had the liberty or the blessing to be
[1:22:04] able to speak this thought down in
[1:22:06] Phoenix but my brother and sister for
[1:22:08] every action there is a reaction and you
[1:22:11] cannot put on this garment which is the
[1:22:14] fine linen which is the righteousness of
[1:22:17] the saints and that very action as it
[1:22:20] were of putting that garment on will
[1:22:23] bring a reaction in you you can't say I
[1:22:27] put on the garment and nothing changed
[1:22:30] it will bring a reaction in you and I
[1:22:34] Amen as you walk into the word if the
[1:22:38] action of walking into the word my
[1:22:41] sister you say well you know the Lord
[1:22:43] dealt with my heart and I know I need to
[1:22:45] change my life and I'm moving in that
[1:22:47] direction
[1:22:48] but it doesn't seem like maybe I still
[1:22:50] smoke maybe I still have a little
[1:22:52] problem here a little problem there my
[1:22:54] brother and sister don't get discouraged
[1:22:55] of that you just keep walking and though
[1:22:58] promise of the Word of God says if you
[1:23:00] walk into the word that it will walk you
[1:23:03] and it will wash you whiter than snow oh
[1:23:06] my how white is snow and it will wash
[1:23:10] you whiter and so so the very action now
[1:23:12] of putting on this garment of fine linen
[1:23:16] the righteousness of God will change us
[1:23:19] Oh hallelujah I don't care how big the
[1:23:21] issue is how little the issue is what
[1:23:23] the issue might be but the very action
[1:23:26] of walking into that and the very action
[1:23:29] my brother and sister of hearing the
[1:23:30] call means you're blessed well praise
[1:23:34] the Lord praise the Lord who who wants
[1:23:36] to be blessed I'll say every one of us
[1:23:38] had lift our hand today and I can tell
[1:23:40] you right now you are blessed because
[1:23:42] you have heard God's call on your life
[1:23:44] amen now look get myself confused here
[1:23:51] excuse me you see my brother and sister
[1:23:56] this finished work of the Lord now did
[1:23:58] God not say that he would finish this
[1:24:00] work he began in us so this finished
[1:24:03] work of the Lord I think all of us ought
[1:24:04] to actually you know we ought to
[1:24:05] actually do that I still think about
[1:24:07] brother bud Southwick talk about a
[1:24:09] rugged mountain man a man that just you
[1:24:12] know he was just a tough character and
[1:24:14] you all know the story how how that he
[1:24:17] was going out there and he just couldn't
[1:24:18] give up cigarettes and you know he's
[1:24:20] there and he gets up off it's a little
[1:24:22] caught there and he says well go out and
[1:24:24] I'm gonna check the horses one last time
[1:24:27] and he goes out there to the far end
[1:24:30] down stand downwind of everything I'm
[1:24:32] far into where the horses are tied and
[1:24:34] pulls out a cigarette and he's about to
[1:24:35] light the thing and brother Branham says
[1:24:37] I'll attempt he says now brother bud
[1:24:39] when was it that you gave up smoking now
[1:24:46] if we stop in the rationale and reason
[1:24:49] that human Humanity would say it's a he
[1:24:52] hasn't
[1:24:54] right I haven't given it up I've got a
[1:24:58] cigarette in my fingers but you see it
[1:25:02] took those words that time that place
[1:25:04] and inspiration come down and What did
[1:25:08] he say well just as soon as I know right
[1:25:12] now never smoked another one in his life
[1:25:16] you see what he did is he responded to a
[1:25:20] voice that actually that voice come from
[1:25:23] the very throne of God it wasn't a man
[1:25:26] speaking to him
[1:25:27] that was God telling him this is your
[1:25:30] moment of deliverance accept it receive
[1:25:33] say right now if God deals with a heart
[1:25:36] Saints I'm talking to myself also God
[1:25:39] deals with our heart concerning
[1:25:40] something don't say Lord well win this
[1:25:42] or Lord well win that just right now
[1:25:45] Lord right now I'm finished with this
[1:25:47] right now
[1:25:48] hey man I'm done with this thing amen
[1:25:51] because you see when the Spirit of the
[1:25:53] Lord moves amen because the scripture
[1:25:55] says the Spirit of the Lord is life amen
[1:25:59] so God doesn't deal with us to make our
[1:26:00] life harder come on look I know a
[1:26:07] brother I know a brother that was
[1:26:08] delivered from from an addiction
[1:26:12] cold turkey delivered from that
[1:26:14] addiction and shook like a leaf for
[1:26:18] three or four weeks while that heroin
[1:26:21] left his body now why would God not heal
[1:26:26] him from the withdrawal as well as the
[1:26:30] desire for I don't have an answer for
[1:26:35] that but I know he never had a desire to
[1:26:39] ever inject heroin in his body ever
[1:26:42] again but he now get this he's going
[1:26:47] through withdrawals which would you
[1:26:49] think would cause him to desire for more
[1:26:51] to deal with the result but he had no
[1:26:53] desire for the heroin but his body still
[1:26:55] had to do the withdrawal now what the
[1:26:58] prophet of God talked about healing then
[1:27:00] people be prayed for in the name of
[1:27:03] Jesus Christ declared that you are
[1:27:04] healed and they go home and get sick as
[1:27:06] a dog
[1:27:07] and they would be there and had been
[1:27:09] easy to say well I guess I wasn't healed
[1:27:11] but you see the withdrawal are you with
[1:27:13] me the withdrawal of that had to bring
[1:27:18] and the body had to then come and purge
[1:27:20] that in many cases but others were
[1:27:23] delivered instantly no sign ever again
[1:27:26] to be seen
[1:27:26] I don't know how God does it I just
[1:27:29] thanked him today he does I thanked him
[1:27:32] today he doesn't if I have to go as it
[1:27:35] were with withdrawal of something in my
[1:27:37] life that on this trouble with that
[1:27:39] thank your Lord that I know whatever
[1:27:41] want to go back to that Amen that's what
[1:27:43] we need to look at right not our
[1:27:45] circumstance see the problem is we're
[1:27:47] becoming a people that are focused on
[1:27:49] our circumstance when we should be
[1:27:51] focused on what the promise of God that
[1:27:53] was spoken is I forget your circumstance
[1:27:56] forget all those things look at the
[1:27:58] promise to say my God said it I believe
[1:28:00] it Amen it's going to come to pass it's
[1:28:03] going to come to pass it might be
[1:28:04] difficult along the way but it will come
[1:28:07] to pass hallelujah Amen now look how I
[1:28:11] just want to come in here you see this
[1:28:15] finished work of the Lord the wife right
[1:28:17] that we were talking about Amen this
[1:28:20] Bride of Christ right is through the
[1:28:21] scripture it's kind of interesting when
[1:28:23] you talk to somebody who says they read
[1:28:25] their Bible and you say something about
[1:28:26] being the Bride of Christ or the wife
[1:28:28] and they say that's in the Bible
[1:28:31] come on Saints I'll admonish you and
[1:28:34] I'll admonish me right along with it if
[1:28:36] you don't know your Bible you can't
[1:28:38] expect it to work for you can I share a
[1:28:44] little humor this young man and this
[1:28:47] young woman got married she had him
[1:28:49] boiled water her mama had pampered her
[1:28:52] from the day she was born she was 18 20
[1:28:54] years old hadn't even boiled water in
[1:28:56] her life and she's she's there and her
[1:29:00] husband's like honey we can't afford to
[1:29:01] keep going out and eating every night
[1:29:03] going out and eating somewhere we're
[1:29:04] gonna have to start eating at home and
[1:29:06] she said well honey you know I don't
[1:29:07] know how to cook and he says we'll just
[1:29:09] do something and he comes home the first
[1:29:11] night and and this this whatever it was
[1:29:14] on the plate he can't even identify it
[1:29:16] he tastes it he's like oh this is
[1:29:17] terrible let's go out to eat
[1:29:20] and so after a little bit of time of
[1:29:23] that he says like honey he says what is
[1:29:25] this stuff she said why I don't know
[1:29:26] honey I just go in the kitchen and I
[1:29:28] first thing I see I just get some of
[1:29:31] that and put it in a pan and I get this
[1:29:32] and put it in a pan and put this in a
[1:29:33] pan and he says and that's what I end up
[1:29:36] with and he says honey have you ever
[1:29:38] heard of a cookbook and she said well
[1:29:42] yeah we got about a half a dozen of them
[1:29:44] for her wedding presents he said would
[1:29:46] you please read one now Saints we got no
[1:29:54] excuse we've got the perfect recipe for
[1:29:59] the overcoming life we got the perfect
[1:30:02] recipe to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:30:04] we've got something that is so
[1:30:07] scrumptious to the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:30:09] that you shouldn't be able to resist it
[1:30:12] hmm praise the Lord
[1:30:15] shouldn't be able to resist it now look
[1:30:20] we have seen his star and come to
[1:30:22] worship Him he said I think the light
[1:30:24] shines best in darkness the darker it is
[1:30:26] the better of the light shines sometimes
[1:30:29] just a small light well I'm not much of
[1:30:32] a Christian I'm not this I'm not that
[1:30:34] it's plenty dark out there you don't
[1:30:37] worry about what your status is as a
[1:30:39] Christian you whether you feel like
[1:30:40] you're some kind of giant slayer or
[1:30:43] whether you just feel like you're just a
[1:30:45] little bitty Christian it's dark enough
[1:30:47] out there your light will shine
[1:30:49] hallelujah amen where there's much light
[1:30:53] it's not noticed but the darker gets
[1:30:55] that small light will shine that much
[1:30:57] stronger
[1:30:57] and remember that there's no darkness
[1:30:59] can exist in the presence of life light
[1:31:02] is so much more powerful than darkness
[1:31:04] until it cannot stand in its presence
[1:31:07] hallelujah there's a man here that not
[1:31:10] oh not to miss do a title here you know
[1:31:13] a man can turn on the light I'm telling
[1:31:15] you as a man here who has already turned
[1:31:17] on the light hey men we don't need we're
[1:31:19] not waiting for somebody to turn the
[1:31:21] light on the light is on hallelujah amen
[1:31:25] it cannot stand its present darkness
[1:31:27] cannot stand when the light starts to
[1:31:29] shine because the Sun is so much greater
[1:31:31] the sunlight that it just presses
[1:31:33] the darkness out and it's no more and
[1:31:35] this dark world someday is going to turn
[1:31:37] to all light when Jesus Christ the son
[1:31:40] of righteousness amen
[1:31:42] the very one that's closing you right
[1:31:45] we're clothed in righteousness so Christ
[1:31:47] the son of righteousness and come again
[1:31:49] then he'll have no more darkness that
[1:31:51] time just as we look out at night time
[1:31:53] and see the moon shining the moon and
[1:31:56] the Sun is husband and wife as to say
[1:31:59] and in the absence of the Sun the moon
[1:32:02] reflects the light of the Sun hallelujah
[1:32:06] my brother and sister we shouldn't be
[1:32:08] reflecting anything else but the light
[1:32:11] of the Sun amen to the earth giving it a
[1:32:15] lesser light right I'm not God but God's
[1:32:18] in me amen hallelujah I can't stand here
[1:32:22] and say I'm God but God's in me to such
[1:32:25] a portion that before I was even born
[1:32:28] the scripture says he formed me come on
[1:32:32] think about it
[1:32:33] you say but I'm short I'm tall I'm this
[1:32:37] I'm that they're handsome I'm ugly God
[1:32:41] formed you now in the natural ice cream
[1:32:50] and Donuts might be forming you but in
[1:32:55] the spiritual you are what God formed
[1:32:59] you to be now let your potential out
[1:33:02] don't sit back and be a lazy Christian
[1:33:05] amen hallelujah I knew some folks had a
[1:33:08] turtle one time and they would always
[1:33:11] get it out of its little thing there and
[1:33:12] the the kid that I hung out with little
[1:33:16] sister would get it out of the deal and
[1:33:19] then she would hold the turtle and she
[1:33:21] would feed the turtle I forget what they
[1:33:24] fed it but she would feed the turtle and
[1:33:26] it would there and take a bite
[1:33:36] she would hold it right there for it she
[1:33:40] spoiled that turtle so bad yes you can
[1:33:42] spoil a turtle she spoiled that turtle
[1:33:46] so bad you could put it back in its
[1:33:48] little aquarium thing and put the very
[1:33:50] food at eight right in front of its nose
[1:33:52] and it wouldn't eat it would sit there
[1:33:55] and open its mouth it wanted someone to
[1:33:59] shove it in come on come on burn in the
[1:34:11] Sun husband wife is seyd absences Sun
[1:34:13] the moon reflects hmm I think he's
[1:34:15] talking about us to the earth giving a
[1:34:18] lesser light that we can see how to get
[1:34:21] around by the moonlight until the Sun
[1:34:23] rises and then the Sun and the moon
[1:34:25] becomes one hmm
[1:34:29] I'm eaten on this the sunlight in the
[1:34:33] moonlight is all the same that's what
[1:34:35] the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:36] should be reflecting the light of him
[1:34:39] while he is absent from the earth in a
[1:34:41] physical body the the church should be
[1:34:44] the reflection of Jesus Christ in these
[1:34:46] dark hours when Santa Claus and tinsel
[1:34:49] all over the street we should scream out
[1:34:51] it's the birth of Jesus Christ not the
[1:34:54] visit of Saint Nicholas amen we were
[1:34:58] living in an awful dark time and that's
[1:34:59] when our light should really shine now
[1:35:02] before we read God's Word I wonder this
[1:35:04] that if we will honor his word oh
[1:35:07] another thought jumps in here now he'll
[1:35:10] honor his word how do we honor his word
[1:35:13] we honor his word by reading it then
[1:35:17] believing it now we should read it faith
[1:35:21] cometh by hearing that if we honor it by
[1:35:23] reading then we honor him by believing
[1:35:26] what we have read amen it's not an
[1:35:29] intellectual thing my brother and sister
[1:35:31] pick up your Bible read it believe it
[1:35:35] and watch it dominate your life now if
[1:35:39] you don't want to be dominated
[1:35:41] you know remember I'm out still to this
[1:35:43] day remember the look on your faces when
[1:35:45] I said that you know stood in front of
[1:35:47] you in church and said here I need to
[1:35:49] admit to you
[1:35:49] that I am a manipulator many of you your
[1:35:53] eyeballs went oh what's coming next but
[1:36:00] the truth is my brother and sister to be
[1:36:02] manipulators to be placed into a
[1:36:03] position that you don't want to be or
[1:36:05] don't know that you want to be now every
[1:36:08] preacher preaching the gospel should
[1:36:09] have the courage enough to be able to
[1:36:10] say I want to be a manipulator because
[1:36:12] what I want to do is move you into the
[1:36:14] presence of Almighty God that's what we
[1:36:17] came to church for to get in the
[1:36:18] presence of God and sometimes come on
[1:36:20] I'm not meaning to be funny this morning
[1:36:21] but sometimes we come into church some
[1:36:23] of us are just dragging so much our life
[1:36:25] is such a mess and everything about it I
[1:36:27] just don't know and you don't get
[1:36:29] nothing out of church because you're
[1:36:30] thinking about mortgage payments car
[1:36:32] payments kids this that and the other
[1:36:33] some of you come together to church you
[1:36:36] fought with your husband or your wife or
[1:36:37] your kids all the way to church you walk
[1:36:39] in here you feel so condemned you know
[1:36:42] the preacher could just be open the door
[1:36:43] to heaven to you and you wouldn't you
[1:36:45] walk to it because I'm not worthy enough
[1:36:46] to walk through it some of you come here
[1:36:50] with your mind stuck on these things and
[1:36:52] this thing and that thing my brother and
[1:36:54] sister sometimes somebody needs to come
[1:36:55] out and kind of shake you a little bit
[1:36:57] get your attention look quit looking at
[1:36:59] yourself I'm gonna go back to your house
[1:37:01] and I'm gonna bust all the mirrors in
[1:37:03] your house cuz you're in there looking
[1:37:04] at yourself going wool unto me but how
[1:37:07] about we get another mirror that when
[1:37:09] you look into that mirror you know see
[1:37:11] the reflection of you I'll put it back
[1:37:13] to me here don't see the reflection of
[1:37:15] Paul Haley I see the reflection of Jesus
[1:37:18] Christ because I know it's not paul
[1:37:20] halen paul halen is on the fast track to
[1:37:23] hell if left on paul hey let's drain but
[1:37:26] if i stand in the Word of God and say
[1:37:28] you know what Lord I just surrender
[1:37:30] myself to you I just want to serve you I
[1:37:32] want to love your Lord and you'll start
[1:37:34] looking into that mirror and you won't
[1:37:36] see a reflection of yourself you'll
[1:37:39] start to see the reflection of the Word
[1:37:41] of God Christ in you hallelujah that's
[1:37:45] the reflection we're looking for not
[1:37:47] some natural mirror as I read the
[1:37:49] scripture to you earlier I won't go back
[1:37:51] to it for the second time that my
[1:37:52] brother and sister we're looking in the
[1:37:54] glass darkly but the one promise we have
[1:37:56] of that word is that when he is revealed
[1:37:58] to us we won't look like us we will
[1:38:02] look like him hallelujah that's what the
[1:38:06] words about amen
[1:38:08] so we should read it faith cometh by
[1:38:10] hearing then if we honor it by reading
[1:38:13] it then we should honor him by believing
[1:38:15] what we have read Oh hallelujah you
[1:38:20] gotta just shut the devil up you know I
[1:38:25] saw a little thing the other day I
[1:38:26] thought was quite interesting people
[1:38:29] don't want you to hear their opinion
[1:38:32] they want to hear their opinion coming
[1:38:35] from your mouth and that's what the
[1:38:38] devil wants my brother and sister he
[1:38:40] wants to hear his opinion coming from
[1:38:44] our mouth well I'm sorry to disappoint
[1:38:47] you devil but I'm gonna take one
[1:38:49] counselor and one counselor only one
[1:38:51] version of the gospel and one version
[1:38:54] only Amen one light and one light only
[1:38:56] and that's going to be my Lord Jesus
[1:38:58] Christ I'm not going to take this man's
[1:39:01] thoughts and that man's thoughts the
[1:39:02] prophet of God the other day said
[1:39:04] somebody come to me to correct me they
[1:39:06] said you're wrong you're wrong you're
[1:39:07] wrong and I'm just paraphrasing this
[1:39:08] he's you know what he said I'm not gonna
[1:39:11] take they said because he will correct
[1:39:14] me hallelujah amen it's not for us to go
[1:39:18] around correct and you you see you know
[1:39:21] my brother and sister how it is now I
[1:39:23] know wives always agree with their
[1:39:24] husbands in a perfect world but you know

[1:39:45] of this you leave the men here now not

[1:48:53] and he knows what he's heard him say you
[1:48:55] know it's the eldest and all this stuff
[1:48:57] and then he hears a weeping and wailing
[1:48:59] and crying and screaming and and he runs
[1:49:03] to his daddy and wraps his arms around
[1:49:04] him and says daddy you know that death
[1:49:06] angel I just saw it go to Johnny's house

[1:49:45] won't be affected when the Death Angel
[1:49:47] comes in swoops at their front door and
[1:49:49] then moves on down the street that child

[1:49:53] is real
[1:49:54] Oh God led us as parents as pastors as
[1:49:57] preachers as brothers and sisters in
[1:50:00] Christ not be there thinking well

[1:50:37] brother and sister I just want to say

[1:51:14] built up hey man we got to introduce our
[1:51:18] families our house our church back to
[1:51:20] the Word of God and let the word be what
[1:51:23] builds us up let the word be what
[1:51:26] satisfies the soul now I'm not talking
[1:51:28] about you never having a moment of
[1:51:30] recreation as it were with a family but
[1:51:32] my brother and sister we're an
[1:51:33] increasing world where we are giving
[1:51:36] this off we're handing our families
[1:51:38] we're handing our churches off to this
[1:51:41] nonsense that says all you know
[1:51:43] Hollywood's making these lovely
[1:51:45] Christian movies now now when did a
[1:51:47] devil ever make a movie that would be a
[1:51:50] blessing to the house of God to the
[1:51:52] kingdom of God come on there's
[1:51:55] underlying sub messages underlying
[1:51:58] things that are put in the twisting of
[1:52:00] the Word of God now you might say
[1:52:02] brother Paul you're going haywire it's
[1:52:03] more as good sermon up till now oh
[1:52:08] praise the Lord I didn't want you to
[1:52:10] leave too happy come on Saints now
[1:52:24] go write this down go home read or
[1:52:28] listen to the whole previous context
[1:52:30] coming right on through I don't want to
[1:52:32] sound like I'm isolating something he
[1:52:35] said I went out on Lakeshore Drive we
[1:52:37] have one of those but he's talking about
[1:52:38] Chicago and I stood there a little while
[1:52:40] and I noticed all them waves jumping up
[1:52:42] and down just to splashing around and I
[1:52:45] thought what's it so excited about
[1:52:46] what's all the excitement and the little
[1:52:49] waves would start and then run out and
[1:52:51] the great big waves and bounce into each
[1:52:52] other and break apart and the phone
[1:52:54] would fly up and then he'd come back in
[1:52:56] now I see the big waves coming in again
[1:52:58] breaking on the bank like you're used to
[1:53:00] here but that was something new for me
[1:53:02] and landlocked serpent so I I noticed
[1:53:05] how it would and I said well it must be
[1:53:07] that the lakes having a revival must be
[1:53:11] what it is it's having a big time just
[1:53:13] jumping up and down I thought that's
[1:53:15] good that's fine but you know I thought
[1:53:17] I wonder if it got a lot of extra water
[1:53:21] in it when it's having a revival and I
[1:53:23] thought no there isn't one more drop in
[1:53:27] it right now than if it was perfectly
[1:53:29] calm
[1:53:29] not one bit it's the same water but it's
[1:53:35] just having a revival jumping up and
[1:53:37] down now to those that think I harp or
[1:53:42] harass about worshiping the Lord you
[1:53:47] might like this up to this point praise
[1:53:49] the Lord I don't jump up and down and I
[1:53:51] got every bit as much we'll go to the
[1:53:55] next part amen
[1:53:56] don't want to leave you disappointed I
[1:54:00] thought well well good does that do
[1:54:05] hmm.well good does that do know that
[1:54:08] getting excited brother Paul and walking
[1:54:10] all over the church and stomping your
[1:54:12] feet and waving your arms and slobbering
[1:54:13] what goods that do hmm come to find out
[1:54:19] when it's having a revival and jumping
[1:54:22] up and down like that it washes all the
[1:54:24] trash out of it up on the shore that's
[1:54:28] what the church needs is a revival get
[1:54:31] all the world and the world washed out
[1:54:33] so it can look clear
[1:54:37] now I want to bring this back to you
[1:54:39] coming back to our thought today you
[1:54:42] don't see a reflection when the waters
[1:54:45] all broken up and splashing there's no
[1:54:47] reflection to be seen but neither do you
[1:54:51] see a reflection on dirty water it's got
[1:54:57] all kinds of bits of bark and twigs and
[1:54:59] this and that you don't see a clear
[1:55:02] reflection oh when it gets all washed
[1:55:07] out so it can look clear be pretty again
[1:55:09] when that water is calm and it's clean
[1:55:13] you lean over the side of the boat the
[1:55:15] dock whatever you look you see a
[1:55:19] reflection Oh hallelujah what causes the
[1:55:27] sea to do that is because there is wind
[1:55:29] comes begins to blow against the waves
[1:55:31] blow against the body of water and pick
[1:55:33] it up that's what the church needs
[1:55:35] tonight well it changed the message here
[1:55:38] if you don't mind that's what the church
[1:55:40] needs today it's a mighty rushing wind
[1:55:43] coming down upon it again reviving it
[1:55:46] getting all the world out the things of
[1:55:48] the world out that way when it starts a
[1:55:50] revival then when it settles down the
[1:55:52] church is in a condition to start off
[1:55:54] then to receive spiritual gifts and
[1:55:56] blessings from God and that's what we
[1:55:59] want
[1:55:59] hallelujah I don't want to just keep
[1:56:01] going to church you keep going to church
[1:56:03] and talking about one day God's gonna
[1:56:04] move in our midst hey man I say let's
[1:56:07] have a revival let it wash the trash out
[1:56:09] get it all throwed out on the bank amen
[1:56:12] let that day in another place brother
[1:56:14] Branham says there that that wind that
[1:56:16] came down on the day of Pentecost not
[1:56:19] just any ol wind maybe you get some guy
[1:56:21] that does a windbag amen and he can
[1:56:24] emotionally crush you to the point that
[1:56:26] you think you ought to go to the altar
[1:56:27] and cry out but there's nothing moving
[1:56:29] you let's settle for the Holy Ghost the
[1:56:32] wind that came on the day of Pentecost
[1:56:33] move in our midst the worse the trash
[1:56:36] out and then we church grace we can be
[1:56:39] ready to receive the supernatural the
[1:56:42] spiritual glyphs gifts and the blessings
[1:56:45] from God and if you want to sign up on
[1:56:47] that program hallelujah I want that hey
[1:56:49] man I want God
[1:56:50] get the trash out of my life now you say
[1:56:52] now brother Paul are you speaking
[1:56:54] specifically to me well no if the Lord
[1:56:56] is speaking to you then you're being
[1:56:57] spoken to I'm just telling you this is
[1:57:00] what the word says this is what message
[1:57:01] says this is what we do and I'll tell
[1:57:03] you what I'm just a simple enough guy
[1:57:05] look at it and I say make sense to me
[1:57:07] hey man Lord just come wash all the
[1:57:09] trash out of my life

[1:57:35] forever you know Laodicean Church age
[1:57:40] will close this out right here he's a
[1:57:43] sovereign God by his own counsel he
[1:57:45] purposed the plan of the summation of
[1:57:48] his own elect which he foreknew the son
[1:57:51] died upon the cross to establish the
[1:57:53] means of salvation Holy Spirit carefully
[1:57:55] execute the will of the Father he is
[1:57:57] working all things at this moment
[1:57:59] according to the purpose of his own will
[1:58:01] amen he is right in the midst of it all
[1:58:04] he's in the midst of his church I say
[1:58:06] amen to that today I believe God's right
[1:58:08] here in the midst of his church this
[1:58:12] great creator Savior God is faithfully
[1:58:14] working amongst his own right now as the
[1:58:16] great Shepherd of the Sheep
[1:58:17] his very existence is for his own he's
[1:58:24] not being God just to be God he's been
[1:58:28] God for you and I
[1:58:31] he's being God that the plan of
[1:58:34] redemption would be manifested Oh
[1:58:36] hallelujah
[1:58:38] he loves them and cares for them his eye
[1:58:41] is ever upon them when the word says
[1:58:43] that your lives are hid with Christ in
[1:58:46] God it means exactly what it says and
[1:58:49] I'm so glad that my god abides faithful
[1:58:52] it is true to himself he won't lie he's
[1:58:54] true to his word he will back it up he
[1:58:57] is true to us he will lose none of us
[1:58:59] but raise us up in the last day and I'm
[1:59:01] glad that I'm resting in his
[1:59:03] faithfulness Philippians 1:6 well I just
[1:59:11] want to step over into another something
[1:59:14] whether Paul your liberal and your
[1:59:18] interpretation that deceived the very
[1:59:21] left if it were possible no I'm not
[1:59:27] I'm confident being confident of this
[1:59:30] very thing that he which has begun a
[1:59:33] good work in you will perform it until
[1:59:35] the day Jesus Christ
[1:59:37] I'm not literal I'm not grasping
[1:59:41] something out here just hoping it would
[1:59:43] be I've got a confidence that God called
[1:59:47] me and it's coming to pass and it will
[1:59:49] my brother and sister he will not take
[1:59:52] us along this path of life and dump us
[1:59:54] off at the end because somehow we didn't
[1:59:56] perform he made a promise he said you
[2:00:00] know what I'll do I'll come down and
[2:00:02] I'll mold you will you come to the day
[2:00:05] that great struggle great trials look
[2:00:07] Saints we don't even have to go through
[2:00:09] this church and testify we know each
[2:00:11] other well enough God knows how to
[2:00:13] change our mind God knows how to change
[2:00:15] our course God knows how to introduce us
[2:00:18] to a deeper relationship God can do all
[2:00:20] this he doesn't come along and say well
[2:00:22] you know not like some employer with
[2:00:24] high demands you know you just don't cut
[2:00:26] the mustard we'll find someone else
[2:00:27] no God says you know what if you need my
[2:00:29] hair achter I will mold more character
[2:00:32] into you you need more faith I will
[2:00:34] release more faith in you amen if you
[2:00:38] need to trust I will bring you to the
[2:00:40] place you've got no choice but to trust
[2:00:42] me
[2:00:43] hallelujah being confident of this very
[2:00:46] thing that he which began a good work in
[2:00:48] you will perform it into the day of
[2:00:50] Jesus Christ he is a true witness now
[2:00:52] this word true is the same word we saw
[2:00:55] back there in Revelation 3 7 you recall
[2:00:58] what it does not mean that true is in
[2:00:59] contrast to false
[2:01:02] many times people are there they caught
[2:01:04] up they think oh yeah okay true true
[2:01:05] false true full look what he says it has
[2:01:07] a rich or deeper meaning by far it
[2:01:10] expresses perfect realization in
[2:01:13] contrast to partial realization well
[2:01:22] praise the Lord you mean I can be
[2:01:25] anointed by the Holy Ghost some people
[2:01:28] say you got the Holy Ghost it's done
[2:01:30] it's finished you got the Holy Ghost but
[2:01:32] you know now I can't defend it I'm gonna
[2:01:35] be bold enough to speak it to you but I
[2:01:36] can't take you to a quote or a direct
[2:01:38] scripture but it's continuity through
[2:01:41] the Word of God you have the Holy Ghost
[2:01:46] my major
[2:01:50] some people say wait not to only go sets
[2:01:52] yet no I'm sorry
[2:01:54] but is the Holy Ghost the Spirit of God
[2:02:01] it's God himself the Holy Ghost is not a
[2:02:05] third entity that was hired to come over
[2:02:07] and take care of business and it is not
[2:02:11] just part of the father's son or the
[2:02:12] Holy Spirit it's God himself
[2:02:19] now if revelation we've been taught to
[2:02:21] pray for revelation if revelation is a
[2:02:23] revealing you don't get one revelation
[2:02:26] or no God right but revelation is an
[2:02:31] unending unfolding unrevealing you know
[2:02:35] what been married is sister Jerry 37
[2:02:40] years
[2:02:41] [Music]
[2:02:46] haven't figured nothing out yet still
[2:02:50] working on that now if it can be such in
[2:02:54] the natural I'd like to just tell you
[2:02:59] guys something you know when your wife
[2:03:04] tells you I like this but then the next
[2:03:09] day she says I like this so you think
[2:03:13] she changed her mind from liking this to
[2:03:16] this so then you shift over here and say
[2:03:19] well I guess that's okay then she shows
[2:03:21] up with this and you're like but I
[2:03:26] thought you liked that well yeah I liked
[2:03:29] it but I didn't want it but you didn't
[2:03:33] say you wanted this either that you just
[2:03:35] like this so I'm confused what was I who
[2:03:37] just didn't catch the way I said it okay
[2:03:46] yes that's good
[2:03:48] [Music]
[2:03:50] until a few days later
[2:03:54] she says I really didn't want that I
[2:03:57] really want this but I thought you said
[2:04:00] you want that and you went and got that
[2:04:01] so I figured you didn't want that no I
[2:04:03] want that but I don't want this and I
[2:04:05] want this one because I think this one
[2:04:06] but I need to take a piece of a
[2:04:08] countertop and put in this one to see if
[2:04:10] this looks like it would be like that
[2:04:12] okay whatever you want look my brother
[2:04:18] and sister that's not how God's working
[2:04:21] it's not how God's working God says you
[2:04:25] know what I'm gonna reveal and sister
[2:04:27] Kari he said I'm gonna reveal a little
[2:04:28] bit of myself to you today and it might
[2:04:33] be a day a week a month
[2:04:34] I hope not a year and God comes and says
[2:04:39] I'm gonna I'm gonna reveal a little bit
[2:04:40] more of me but now you got to forget
[2:04:42] what I already revealed
[2:04:43] [Music]
[2:04:46] No what's he doing every revelation adds
[2:04:51] to the vision or the picture of Jesus
[2:04:54] Christ every revelation we don't have to
[2:04:56] come in here and cut this section out
[2:04:57] because they don't fit every revelation
[2:05:00] is an addition building upon the Word of
[2:05:05] God amen
[2:05:07] it's richer deeper meaning by far
[2:05:09] expresses perfect realization and
[2:05:11] contrast to partial realization now back
[2:05:14] in the Philadelphian age the coming of
[2:05:16] the Lord was drawing nigh but great love
[2:05:18] that age manifested for him it reminds
[2:05:21] me of those beautiful words of first
[2:05:22] Peter 1:8 whom having not seen you love
[2:05:25] in whom though now you see him not yet
[2:05:27] believing you rejoice with joy
[2:05:28] unspeakable and full of glory with them
[2:05:32] we rejoice also we haven't seen him but
[2:05:35] we have felt him and we know him now as
[2:05:38] much as our limiting senses can let us
[2:05:42] but one day it will be face to face oh
[2:05:45] no longer through the glass a man no
[2:05:49] longer
[2:05:49] disss we see you Lord through this glass
[2:05:52] darkly one day face to face that is for
[2:05:57] this a teach he is coming at the end of
[2:05:59] this age partial realization will be
[2:06:03] made perfect realization completed
[2:06:07] realization hallelujah we have been
[2:06:09] looking through a glass darkly but soon
[2:06:11] it will be face to face we have been
[2:06:13] going from glory to glory but soon it
[2:06:15] will be right in the glory and His glory
[2:06:18] and in his glory will shine we shall be
[2:06:21] like him
[2:06:22] wondrously like him Jesus our Savior
[2:06:26] divine
[2:06:27] hallelujah not gonna look in the mirror
[2:06:30] and be a different reflection not going
[2:06:33] to have the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:06:35] come and find out we look nothing like
[2:06:38] him we will be him Oh hallelujah
[2:06:42] hallelujah isn't that wonderful we are
[2:06:45] complete in him that is true he would
[2:06:48] not lie to us about that one day we were
[2:06:51] changed in the atoms will put on
[2:06:53] immortality we will be swallowed up in
[2:06:55] life then we will realize utilization
[2:06:59] what will that realization be we stand
[2:07:03] in his presence and realized that it was
[2:07:06] the Word of God not even loud Asiya not
[2:07:11] this age not our job not relationships
[2:07:15] not our finances none of that will have
[2:07:18] truly molded us it will be God and God
[2:07:23] alone molding us into his image Oh
[2:07:26] hallelujah
[2:07:27] now look bro a master craftsman uses
[2:07:30] many tools so he might be using your job
[2:07:35] he might be using your neighbor he might
[2:07:38] be using there's been a wife a mother a
[2:07:40] father children he might be using
[2:07:44] [Music]
[2:07:49] me but I'll tell you what you do you
[2:07:53] just keep praying Lord till you send us
[2:07:56] a better pastor make this one work
[2:07:59] come on Saints God will use what God
[2:08:02] wants to use he's sovereign he's
[2:08:06] sovereign hallelujah
[2:08:08] just sit back and say Lord Here I am I
[2:08:10] give myself to your Lord whatever you
[2:08:13] want to do mold me any way you please
[2:08:15] Lord I just want to be molded into your
[2:08:18] image I want your life to be my life I
[2:08:22] want everything that you are everything
[2:08:24] that you promise to be I want to be that
[2:08:27] then I claim that but we lift a hand
[2:08:29] today and say I claim that in the name
[2:08:31] of Jesus Christ I want to be Amen all
[2:08:34] that God called me to be Oh hallelujah
[2:08:37] hallelujah I was afraid I wouldn't have
[2:08:40] enough to preach about this morning my
[2:08:43] oh my
[2:08:43] I'll tell you let the revival come are
[2:08:46] you anchored down enough let the wind
[2:08:47] blow hell away I believe we are Saints
[2:08:50] let's let the wind blow let it blow
[2:08:52] every little bit of trash now look I'm
[2:08:53] not looking out thinking okay this
[2:08:55] person's doing this that one's know that
[2:08:56] don't know don't misunderstand me I'm
[2:08:58] not looking at none of that all I know
[2:09:00] is there's little isms and systems it's
[2:09:02] still reside in our lives and I'm just
[2:09:04] asking the Holy Ghost to come and blow
[2:09:06] through here and let it be washed out
[2:09:07] let everything worst out in another
[2:09:10] quote I didn't put it up but I probably
[2:09:12] should have brother Branham says you
[2:09:13] know let let those waves come let it
[2:09:16] beat that out of us
[2:09:18] so that's alright just as long as you
[2:09:20] let the Holy Ghost do the beating
[2:09:24] that's why I don't believe in coming out
[2:09:26] here how sister Nadia now Aurora no you
[2:09:33] won't get nothing beat out of nobody you
[2:09:35] just create resentment embarrassment
[2:09:36] shame this kind of when the Holy Ghost
[2:09:39] comes and says I want that out of your
[2:09:43] life I want you to sacrifice this I want
[2:09:47] you to serve me more give me more time
[2:09:49] we're gonna want you to pour out more
[2:09:50] energy I don't want this part of you I
[2:09:52] want all of you when the Holy Ghost does
[2:09:55] that a son or daughter of God suddenly
[2:09:57] says this Lord but if the preacher comes
[2:10:00] well he may as well just carry a stick
[2:10:04] reminds me of video I seen once for this
[2:10:06] man in church his phone went off now
[2:10:11] somebody else obviously had a phone
[2:10:12] because this is on film but the guy's
[2:10:15] phone goes off and I kind of dislike you
[2:10:17] know right like pastor finally comes
[2:10:19] down there sits can I see your phone
[2:10:23] the guys like pastor looks at it he says
[2:10:27] some words about disrespect or whatever
[2:10:29] throws on the floor he stomps it and a
[2:10:32] piece of right there on the floor of the
[2:10:33] church well he doesn't catch the guy
[2:10:38] back there but the phone filming him my
[2:10:42] brother and sister I'm sure that brother
[2:10:44] was just like honey that's absolutely
[2:10:46] the church I believe we should go to
[2:10:47] church no no but what if that pastor
[2:10:53] would have taught having a reverence in
[2:10:55] a respect not for this ceiling these
[2:10:57] walls this carpet these pews but for the
[2:11:01] God that this is his house see they they
[2:11:05] fail to teach a respect for the house of
[2:11:08] God they failed to teach a respect for
[2:11:10] the Word of God but they want the people
[2:11:12] to respond come on lord help us all amen
[2:11:17] just open our hearts and say Lord blow
[2:11:19] through here I don't care what has to
[2:11:21] get washed away just come Lord come
[2:11:24] right down here let a revival come into
[2:11:26] grace amen now the prophet of God says
[2:11:28] that a revival is not something new it's
[2:11:30] not calling the people off the street
[2:11:31] and doing this and that that's just a
[2:11:33] restoring or bringing you back to life
[2:11:34] what we already have amen and we know we
[2:11:38] know who we are we know what God's
[2:11:39] called us for Lord led there just the
