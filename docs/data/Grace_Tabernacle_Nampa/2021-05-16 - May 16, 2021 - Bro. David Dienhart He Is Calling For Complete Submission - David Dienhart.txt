just simply take sides with amen so don't run away in high this goes right along with what we had here i want to sing this and then brother jay right after that that first song you sang was perfect first one on your list i'd like to sing that again before we i don't mean to sing a lot of songs here but i just felt really inspired to sing that so let's sing this verse in the chorus once again [Music] there's no night you're in his light amen there is no time [Music] is [Music] there is no power [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] what he did yesterday he'll do

praise the lord let's just thank him thank the lord god we are we didn't choose you you chose us before the foundation of the world put it in our hearts that choosing that we would make the choice we

god has come down in unity with his body we are one praise be to god thank you jesus praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord thank the lord i want to sing one more song well i'll do that just before we read the scripture first of all i want to say this i want to thank you again for the anniversary party you gave us and our actual anniversary was friday and i just appreciate the appreciate all the well wishes and the things that were spoken and i speak for diane and i we just appreciate it the lord bless you we love every one of you we i just i don't know i don't have words to express it i get melancholy and i get kind of sentimental but i just i just appreciate the lord's mercy we had a song song when we someday thought i might have a sing this morning and i didn't but i don't know if even jade knows it but we had a song and our wedding sung and it's always been our our theme all the way through marriage with savior like a shepherd lead us and uh we had that song and that's been that was inspired to be sung then and i just know that i hope he's that way with you he's our shepherd he's lit us perfectly in his way the bible said is perfect but it also says one or verse two verses down he had made your way perfect and that's psalms 18. can you imagine being because we're into him he's he's perfect then your way has to be perfect hallelujah he's made your way perfect just think of that that ought to be enough to let off the pressure say amen and go home right there because what else do you need he's everything you need he's already provided everything you need he said i shall provide lady so i need a healing brother david i kept praying and praying he's already provided so what do you mean by his stripes you're healed he's already provided it all you have to do then is accept it walk on with the promise and submit yourself to the word and said it's finished yes that's right that's right don't listen to the devil don't listen to his temptations on your flesh don't listen to your feelings you listen to the word you'll never contact god with your feelings you contact him through faith hallelujah so you just remember that it's faith that he gave you to contact him and faith takes this resting place in the unmovable eternal word i'd like you to stand with me together and i'll sing this song brother now one other thing i'd like to have you pray for us we're making a trip to ohio uh i'm going to be ministering there about three or three services maybe more and i appreciate your prayer for us for me and i just would appreciate that if you do that so god bless you and we'll be praying for you amen we always do and we'll continue i believe in prayer i absolutely believe in prayer prayer changes things you couldn't tell david that prayer doesn't change things i know prayer changes things i know we can call on him and he's already answered because he said he would amen amen that's right let's sing this song turn your eyes upon jesus before we open this [Music] that's the up i want i want to see you this morning think of it [Music] is one more time the eternal one the eternal things [Music] in the light of his glory [Music] our heads of prayer our heavenly father that is the desire of your bride we have one thing to look at one focus one theme in our life one absolute one amen and that's you the word lord god we just claim your presence we know you're present we're asking you to bless your word this morning and may everyone ordained to life the predestinated lord here sitting here this morning will be lord be able to look full into your wonderful face and see the hour therein and see the time and the promise that they are now fulfilling we pray that you're granted in jesus christ's name amen say you are fulfilling oh yes we're fulfilling scripture amen you yourself individually are fulfilling the scripture the word of promise amen turn with me in your bibles to genesis 18. i want to title this he's calling for complete and i want you to notice i'm not just missing words here this this was very inspired on me and i i felt to bring it i was thinking of bringing it the wednesday last i ministered and i just i was stopped and said bring it this morning and i told brother brother chris what he preached on wednesday was wonderful it went right with it and you'll see that and god's trying to get something across to you brother sister i think we ought to be all attention we can to what he's speaking not because i'm speaking it because or paul's speaking or chris speaking it's god speaking and he's speaking through your life if you let him do it he's working through you if you let him do it you got to let him do it you say do i have to let him do it oh yes he won't force his way in so god is calling he's calling for your complete submission not to your thinking not to your intellectual knowledge not to your ideas quit trying to figure the message out and let go and let god reveal it as he wants to to you individually get out of your own thinking and die to yourself you'll never learn god you'll never learning by by by your intellectual study and trying to figure out words and scriptures that's a bunch of nonsense let god reveal it it's hid there for you if you'll just let him do it it calls for submission amen all right and that and i'm saying calling for your individual submission this is not a group affair and i'm going to come back that word affair just a little knowledge help you catch it while i'm in the ministry this morning but it's it's a it's an it's not an a group affair it's an individual affair let me just say right now it's a love affair brother branham said over and over again it's an individual affair and he called it a love affair amen so so he wants your undivided attention to be on him he's your head and he's your husband i'm talking to the bride this morning not my place to say who is and who isn't i'm talking to the bride this morning he's talking to the bride this morning a dependency on him alone he wants dependency not independent you're not independent you're dependent upon him alone just as the wife would be to her husband she doesn't go out here and marry a man and then say well i'm independent she's not independent she has a head that she's submitted to if she really loves him she'll submit to his headship and if she really loves if he really loves her he'll give himself as christ did for the church not to every little whim you've got every not every little every little every little uh thing you want to show off on your on your on your tantrums he's not going to give in to that but he has the will of god he knows the not has the knowledge and understanding of god to be ahead amen and you're submitting yourself to him i'm talking in the spiritual now context i'm not making fun of you and your sister between you and your husband but i'm telling you that right amen because paul and all that he said i'm speaking of christ in the church amen right bringing it right back typing it with the natural husband and wife remember who you represent and you men remember who you represent amen that will bring the marriage under the right context all right so he does not want an a divided attention he does not want your divided attention he wants your full attention i'm talking about christ he wants your full attention separated to him alone all right separated we're talking about when we talk about submission it means cement surrender yielding it also means separation amen all right so so god has always separated light from darkness death from life truth from error always has always will amen all right so separation to him alone not double-minded a double-minded man is unstable in his ways he's divided in interest he doesn't really know where he's standing because brother brown said there's a real believer and then there's the one that the unbeliever and then there's one the in between that don't know which way to go amen are you with me he said satan was the unbeliever adam was the real believer and he was in between she didn't know which way to go and satan took advantage of that but god doesn't want you like that he doesn't want your interest divided between him and somebody and something else someone else something else god's word calls for a total separation from unbelief that's right amen so he wants you separated from your own stinking thinking of your carnal thought that's pretty strong but i got that from a minister it is our own carnal thinking our own our own mind is against us it's enmity to god human thinking his enmity to god so quit trying to figure this word message out with your thinking you just go to feeding and let word as he said faith cometh by hearing the word now why i'm saying that there must be something in here that needs it we all need it just if something looks too strong for you and too heavy just deny yourself put it on the shelf say god it's in your hands and i'm going to continue eating lord you reveal your will to me it takes a death to self daily it takes a submission daily all right i want to get too far here don't he doesn't want you double-minded he wants you to hem your head the word alone all right genesis so we're going to say this and i'm just giving this is just a kind of a pull here to what we're doing he said marriage is come marriage has come it's seed time you ever hear prophet say that emphasis on it he also said it's seed time it's bride time amen and his whole was on her and your whole attention ought to be on him genesis 18 i want to come back to it over here so let me just get over to it genesis the 18th chapter 10th verse and he said this is the angel speaking that abraham said is elohim god in flesh we had god and flesh speak to us today we still have god and flesh speaking to us we have elohim all right but he said i will certainly return unto thee now the mystery of the seventh seal is laying right here the fact that all we're going to reach here is the mystery of the seventh seal which is the seven seals all right because the seventh just capped off the whole revelation because it's himself the capstone all right and he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and what did you what did he do after that he backed it up by knowing the secret of hearts how may know that brother said that's the sign of the son of man that's what's a sign pointing to a union hallelujah i've come for that purpose i've come to fulfill the word amen all right uh return unto me according to the time of life i want you to know time of life seedtime and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son who was having the son sarah thy wife all right and sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him i want to jump down the 14th verse and we know what sarah said she laughed and god said to her is anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed let's think where we're at now in our day at the time appointed i will return unto thee he said oh brother david that couldn't happen what you tell me what the sign was in 63 that wasn't the head coming to the body i will return unto thee full revelation of the word there he was all right i will return unto thee at the time appointed i will return to thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son let me say this it's the time of life all right you may be seated like you turned the song of solomon i won't keep you standing i do have three two other scriptures here to start off with song of solomon we preach around this book a lot but not many preach right on it that's okay i'm not downing anybody because of that but we preach around it and in it and out of it because it's the marriage it's a union it's a it's a love affair between god and his bride all right but the verse eight of chapter 2. now watch this first verse and i want to remind you that in that in in psalm 68 verse 33 you don't have to turn there let me just quote it he does send out his voice that a mighty voice all right then in the fur and the eighth the voice of my beloved hello do you have a beloved the voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains skipping upon the hills let's turn to the 10th verse now my beloved spake it's the emphasis i want to bring out of the 8th verse the voice of my beloved he cometh my beloved spake and said unto me not to everyone else not to the other women to her spake unto me all right rise up we sing that song rising up rise up and if you you'll follow we don't have time to read it but isaiah 61 says arise shine for thy light thy light personal thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon himself her not another amen i think you've heard me preach on that not another he wouldn't share his glory with another but he will share it with her because she's not another well amen brother david that's the truth and it's interesting we have this behind us and this in focus we could say that's rainbow color and preach a message on marriage yeah that god laid in my heart two weeks ago three weeks ago or whatever it's been until quite a while all right and brother chris spoke a message on marriage behind the door in secret i just come unglued when he started saying that and i thought well that's why i've hindered that it's gonna follow right in line brother paul's speaking the same thing here sunday look how everything going brother sister what's what's he calling for calling for a greater submission amen amen you say well the wife will be submitted she will be but sometimes you just need to be reminded and if you're not where you should be he's calling for you to submit if that pulls in your heart give way to the pull because it happens to be the third one not the first one it's not the spirit it's the third one is that right the opening pulling you need an opening you need a closer walk with god then let go and let god do it to submit is to let go okay haven't you got the meetings yet let's keep reading 14th my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love what did he call her my love other words it's identified with his love the same love my love you say well that we just take that well this my level that that's not lightly taken he's not saying exactly that he's saying you're my love and there's no fear in love you're my love i loved you first that's why you love me because you are my spirit you are myself you are love expressed amen arise my love and my fair one and come away come away come away come on come away into my into my preparation for body change come away come away behind the door come away and hide yourself see i told you brother chris come away and hide yourself this thing isn't going to be known publicly going to be known to you individually not a public demonstration it's not some public show this is an unveiling of himself because himself was then he knew to be unveiled all right for the low the winter is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear seed time time of life amen on the earth flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds has come hallelujah and the voice of the turtle that's a turtle dove the voice of the turtle is heard in our land our land hallelujah cooing of the dove there's nothing quite so comforting as the cooing of a dove yeah just heat it all get all heated up and just listen to a dove cool right by you amen that's right it's a cooing of the dove the fig tree put it forth her green figs and the vines with the see everything speaking of seed time the fig tree put it for through green figs see it's time for the seed to be quickened it's time for the ground that has been fertile to receive it amen predestinated ground hallelujah all right he said the vines with tender grapes give a good smell arise my love my fair one and come away this is bride time come away not church time not denominational time the shucks dead it's time for the bride to rise his full focus is on her it's seed time it's back to seed again it's back to himself again manifested in another form it's himself that's the vision you need to catch it's himself she was adam he was adam you want another person it was he that brought her to the man she didn't come herself hallelujah okay all right see rise my love my fair one come away oh my dove look what he look what he speaks look what he is and look what she is oh my dove thou art in the clefts of the rock we'll come to that cleft in just a moment of the revelation the revelation the rock is revelation that's why the bible said god is my revelation god is what oh brother david now you're just going beyond our carnal thinking yes i am god is my rock god is my revelation my refuge my strength right my high tower amen all right i can let off the pressure or we're going to have pressure but you can let off the pressure because bride your future is clear i didn't say you wouldn't have trials and temptations when he said let us go at the other side they didn't know they'd have to meet the storm but he was in the ship if they just realized it instead of waking him up and said do you not care if we pair it that was a slap in the face i didn't i just tell you that we'd go the other side he was sleeping he wasn't moved by the storm they feared they feared it was fear that motivated that it wasn't faith it was fear amen all right all right so oh my dumb thou art in the clefs of the rock in the secret places of the stairs that stairs there is a way of access your access to me has been open like we said about esther she had access only she had access that makes me as excited as you were up here i i get excited when i think of that only she and she didn't approach it just well bless god i'll just walk in no and she when she come with a request she had reverence and respect the king i'll give you half my kingdom but she said if it pleases the king that's the character of the bride that's the character submissing to her husband amen all right all right so we so he said our the clutch the rock the secret places of stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet as thy voice and i counten it succumbly then he kind of comes back with the reprimand take the foxes you're letting little foxes just give yourself more to me we'll take care of the little foxes i'm just going to drop that in all right matthew 25. matthew 25 i've already taken too much time oh well forgive me lord it's his time all right let's start here with the let's just start with this we know there was foolish and wise foolish took no oil in there took no oil in their lamps took the oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels i want you to notice the change here in their vessels with their lamps they didn't have oil in their vessels they had it in their lamps at one time but the lamps have gone out they didn't have any more reserve nothing in there to quicken amen are you with me notice that vessel there there's a lamp and there's a vessel you have oil in your vessels bride you are prepared before the foundation of the world but it has to be quickened it takes the fire of god to quicken the oil but there has to be oil there to quicken all right so there had to be oil there to quicken didn't there there had to be a predestinated seed there to quicken because the pouring outpouring of the holy spirit falls upon all flesh but not all flesh have the seed in them they have a weed they have some kind of seed but not the seed not the wheat not the word scene that's why the bride will see the day and hour she lives and she's a manifestation of that time because she's the message of it the message had to be spoken for you and i to come to birth in our day under that word because we have a supernatural spoken word birth that's exactly how the bride she's a virgin born word of god made manifest not physical born spiritual born not a natural seed a spiritual seed all right now but she's to come on the scene the last days we talked about that last wednesday the promise was she's to come on the scene in the last day what would she be she would have to be him to fulfill the scripture and revelation of himself incomplete oh what an hour what a time that's why we're facing eden again right that's where five we're facing the millennium again i mean again the eden again which is the millennium eden we're facing eden we're facing the seventh day on the earth the earth day of seventh day i may know what i mean seventh that or that millennium day i don't want to go into that but millennium day is its seventh day all right and he rested the seventh day and he burns it off and and and gives the baptism on the earth the baptismal holy ghost and you are the holy ghost made manifest walk right out in it just like he walks right out in you and all the earth is submitted to you hallelujah now that's a thing in a nutshell that pretty good anyway i mean i thought so all right so all right getting back to this so they took they took oil in their vessels with their lamps in verse six and at midnight now you're breaking to a morning from midnight to morning because it's passing the day okay and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him my love my fair one it's time to rise right this the the cry went forth from the one to introduce him because he had his voice are you with me are you're coming he's coming boy she got up because remember his coming was like romeo and juliet remember how prophet said that he didn't come in public view he came up on the ladder he rose right up there and knocked on the window kind of night you know still but it's going to be breaking day pretty quick here and i'm here i've arrived come come on i've got things to show you i've got secrets to make known to you i want to take you into myself i want to hide you away so that you'll have no no no fear about the day and the politics and the hour and the time and all this whether you're gonna have gas or not have gas money or not money and all this other thing come away submit yourself my love my fair one come away all right and while and and go out to meet him go you out to meet him praise god i mean we've heard the prophet pray that very word go out to meet him don't wait any longer but then his message turned the corner so here he is here he is i've introduced it to him now i've got a decrease he has to increase his turn from the prophet to his prophecy all right then it comes down here and all those virgins rose and trim their lamps remember the foolish and the white both rose well you got part of this too you know they had something to move them but they just didn't have enough to move them into a rapture they were sanctified people they were help to the bride what's a bride without attendance what's a queen without attendance they attend to it they just don't have the revelation of the hour they're good people they just lack revelation by god's choosing that's it you can't add a cubit to your stature but there's one thing about it when the word comes you sure that word's in there to be alive you want more of god that's all there is to it that little bride's got to have it she's not going to get out here dilatory about the message that foolish virgin was dilatory amen all right i can't stop on these little side things i just got to keep moving here all right your pull is wonderful i just can't quit all right now go let's go a little further and the foolish son of the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out brother branham before 1963 message of the seals he was telling the people what's wrong with you people even now mention his name i'm afraid he'd mention it david duplessis you remember he said my ministry is out here in the world but i'll bring them in to the baptism and see remember we said the the methodists the baptists the presbyterians and he said they were coming crying for oil brother graham said you notice they didn't get it they don't get it and it was at that time the bridegroom came and look at here and while they went to buy brother branham is denoting they're gone to buy they've gone to buy you look it up and look up and see bridegroom came and see what he says about it or bridegroom come right body change and that's exactly what this coming consummates in that's right you see the mystery brother brown said of the seventh seal is this coming because only the bride can see it why because she has the oil amen praise the lord that's why i'm not afraid to say that we're going to get into the lord to help me get into some things the prophet said here all right so we said here and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready when were you ready amen how are you ready you didn't make yourself ready he made him yourself ready but he gave it into your hands to be ready because it was granted to the bride to be ready amen she's not going to miss it she's not going to miss her time and brother bro and always say let me say something the door will be completely shut until the last one comes in brother branham said i got this quote i forget 64. he said even if there was one happen to be born and that feels sealed everything a little child born here he's not old enough to know the difference but he has to grow up but but that he or she is predestinated bride then everything has to wait for that person to get there we don't know when that last one comes in we just know that when you're ready you go into marriage with him and the door shuts it's not shut totally yet but it's shut on you glory he doesn't leave it wide open he doesn't come to a to a communion with you if you know what i mean a union an invisible union it's an invisible union hallelujah this is an invisible union between you and him not a public show it's not known to the public you see the corner turn you see the sun the sun's out here shining in its strength amen that's why that's why corn these plants you don't harvest wheat until the sun's in its strength and it bakes that wheat and burns it to a golden brown lays in the presence of that sun it's ready for harvest be taken amen there's a slowly of growth but not the sowing of maturity did you catch what i just said the maturity speeds up the growth slows down i'm talking about growth as far as the plant growth because it's come to its head now the head is maturing life's gone all the way to from the root the seed to begin with back to seed again right or back to the revealing of the son of man again remember three sons names he comes the son of man son of god son of david but just before he said he returns to israel son of david he appears as son of man again it's exactly your day amen all right now he said so he said and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not i you weren't in my thinking as bride i know you not i don't have a love affair with you i don't know you that way i never did know you that way although these here get eternal life at the white throne judgment because they were good to the people of god now think of that one yeah you could just go on and talk all you want but brother braham said what noted the difference between those that did get eternal life and didn't is how they treated the word when they met if they found fault with it al i will go into that's another message that's been in my heart for a long time all right now watch this submission the act or fact submission means the action the action called action brother paul the action or fact of accepting or yielding to a superior force or to the will or authority of another person amen all right submit submit means to yield resign or surrender to the power will will or authority of another and they give us and we turn ephesians five it said wives submit yourselves to your own husbands to be subject to acquise in the authority of another to thy husband's will that's still the meaning of it still given the meaning of submit to thy husband's will to be submissive to yield without murmuring amen god take up our cross daily don't we when that murmuring spirit wants to come around start murmuring remember you don't know this word by your intellectual study you'll never know it right it takes a death to yourself and an in an in an indwelling of the holy ghost before you can even call jesus the lord so you say well that leaves me out no it leaves you in it depends what's in your heart isn't that right you see it's a call of submission it's a warning on one hand and a refuge and arrest on the other hand this morning all right all right so we look at that submission to submit and we and i referred to submissive without yielding you go back to scripture and find it philippians 2 13 14 and 16. 213 14 and verse 16. it's a submission by love amen all right brother branham said he said because i live you live also speaking to his girlfriend no speaking to his wife this is not a boyfriend girlfriend affair now this is a this is a union amen right he owns your money he owns your time he controls your life and he wants on the he wants an he wants an absolute focus on him an arrest on what he said he would do submission amen all right now i'm reading out of the message proving his word you've heard this a lot these quotes you've heard a lot but brother i don't care how many times you've heard quotes why don't you lay that intellectual thought aside and realize that every time i've read these and maybe been into a message i don't know i don't have to keep track of my time 75 80 90 times maybe i don't know but i through the years that doesn't mean a thing that does not mean one thing what is he revealed and there's something in that new every time just like this message now watch paragraph 2 35 236 now we say he's raised from the dead i didn't say it the word here said it they said he raised from the dead he says he's the same yesterday today and forever you believe that then don't make him something he wasn't yesterday or don't try to make him something he's not today that he was yesterday yeah all right he said he's the same yesterday today and forever you believe that he promised these things to happen in the last days that saying that the same son of man will be made manifest the same son of man now right away your carnality goes back to the calvary man it was but not in that stature that form are you with me we'll meet him but not right now we have we're still meeting the son of man though all right i hope that didn't make you swallow your tongue but that's the truth where are me how many know you're met the son of man again he's come again he had to come again he had to return again all right even had his picture taken all right now now remember that was not jesus talking to abraham there that could discern the thoughts in sarah's mind behind him that was not jesus he had not yet been born but he was a man in human flesh that abraham called elohim the great almighty showing jesus said it was as it was in the days of sodom he says now watch close in the days of sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man all right when the son of man is being revealed what's revealed unveiled brother branham said where he said in the seal book so i can't remember exactly he said where is it unveiled in you through his prophet and you somebody's got to carry the message out somewhere it's going to be unveiled and when it's unveiled then you that's god with skin on him i don't care how you slice it that's god with skin on him the new birth is jesus christ and you're the new bird right all right now no no he said the son of man being revealed when the son of man is being revealed not no morris church boy is that a good one there's your denominational spirit not no more as church or shuck not no morris church he's not revealed that way not no more the bride is called see in that day the son of man will be revealed the bride is called all right what to join what what is it for to join the church to the head unite he said unite the marriage of the bride what is it he said it's to it's uniting time how many know you've had the sign of the uniting time he preached the message uniting time and sign the sign of the uniting time all right then he said when the son of man will come down and unite the marriage of the bride the bridegroom call the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together what unites the two together the revealing of himself the word see all right the church has to be the word because he is the word and the two unite together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man amen slow with this on purpose i want you to catch every word here not a clergyman not the revealing of a clergyman i i don't know do you see what i mean see this baby thought that it's not going over just right but he's but it's not it's going over right now he said do you see what i mean it's the son of man jesus christ no bones pulled about that it's the son of man jesus christ will come down in human flesh among us and will make his word so real that he'll unite the church and him as one the bride he's not make sure you understand what he means by church the bride then she'll go home to the wedding supper what are we looking for the wedding supper she sees he said amen she's already united when that takes place she's already united when we do that go home see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage because the marriage of the lamb is come he said has come past him all right but the rapture is going to the wedding supper all right when the word here here unites with the person and they too become one and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing if she hadn't see he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride if he had the characteristic displayed of this so will the bride he's uniting himself with his own character he can't manifest another character he won't marry another character amen all right see when the word so he said he was the word the word in the church come what he was the word the church does the same thing he cho now she is him i'm i'm putting in by my referring deck to other things she is him that's what he said she is him same spirit one spirit no longer twain but one same word spoke of the groom speaks of the bride same word if he hit on okay i already said 16 cylinders so will she she's him she is him he's her body he is her body i hope he catch this now we don't have another body but him he is my body because my habitation is in him my dwelling place is in him and then this is his body we've got to get that in the right order amen amen okay i'm coming back to that the lord will help me here with the time i may i'm almost well i'm not stopping yet i can't stop yet brother paul i'm sorry but you know how it is and where brother brother chris said he worries about having enough we worry about having too much but he didn't make me to be like chris or brother paul he made me to be what i am amen so we gotta just follow how many noises he's leading that's all we want isn't it right submission to him let go of ourselves our feelings our reasoning you can't trust your reasoning you can't trust your emotions you can't trust your feelings right it's the word we're trusting your feelings could be up and down you wake up one morning you know you feel 100 miles away from the word that doesn't have anything to do with the word being there because you've got two natures in the same body one's in the soul which is the word of god if you're born again it's the word of god the other old nature out there wants a contrary at all time you meet that every day but you don't trust the outer man you don't trust your senses trust the word you're not submitting yourself to your senses at least i hope you aren't you trust the word and then trust god to lead your senses there you are your reasoning your memory your imagination hebrews 10 5 said a body has thou prepared me lord a body has sal prepared me in questions and answers in 64. brother brandon was asked the questions i can't give over completely to jesus have i an evil spirit this is 8 23 morning 64. paragraph 269 let me just spend surrender all you are oh no not me be careful my husband doesn't believe the way i believe that doesn't have one tinker's who to body you surrendered him as long as he stays in the word with you right are you with me you surrender your whole self to him you married him you say but what if he says i can't go to church what if i can't read the word brother brown said you surrender every you surrender complete to him unless he has you do something or or go somewhere or do something it's contrary to the word then your love is to the word but otherwise you surrender to him you don't withhold it you surrender you respect him you reverence him regardless what if god led you out here well lord you wouldn't lead me to do this remember the lord leads us sometimes contrary in an unexpected way an unexpected time contrary to your reasoning you're in him and he's in you and if there's anything wrong he's going to correct it he's going your way as a believer but what he allows it to happen and all things work together for good to them that love god so you have not one thing to to be disgusted about or murmuring about or complaining about and we all do because our old human self gets in the way that's why jesus said you have to deny yourself take up your cross daily and follow me now so he says you can't surrender don't if you're a woman if you're a woman don't you have to surrender your husband wife surrender all you are watch what he continues to say a little lady when you were married virtuous fought all your life to stay virtuous but one day you found a man that you loved see a real marriage is a revelation you found a man that you love you know that's the one you see brother man said when it's a revelation to you that your wife that's your husband that's an eternal mate from glory you just come out of time met down here ordained to meet down here and go right back out to eternity again a little space that's the real marriage that's why he said you ought to wait and seek god about who you marry absolutely is that right you're young people you ought to hear what brother david brother paul we're not just talking around the bush you better be careful you marry a boy that's full of the holy ghost if you're full of the holy ghost you'll have no other desire but to marry a boy that has the holy ghost and the manifestation and the fruit of that in his life that's right amen that's right because if he isn't he'll make hell on earth for you in the same way a boy looking for a girl don't you look at her pretty stature and her pretty little eyes and her curly hair or his curly hair or if his sweet feet smell good like brother branham said you know well he has such cute feet well she shouldn't have been that close to him to see his feet why was his feet uncovered probably barefooted back in the south they do that anyway i don't know why it would be nice smelling but he probably put her fume on it so that was the decision that's pretty shallow isn't it you better make sure she has the manifestation of holiness in her life which is a life lived for jesus christ a life worthy of the gospel i'll get off of that but a whole sermon could be preached there yeah more than two other one that's for sure whole family series could be preached on that daddies wives husbands wives children all right but you but you found a man that you loved and you were his completely the things that you fought against all your life and tried to live clean and clear and virtuous now you surrender every bit of it to one man are you reading it are you listening what the bride does surrender to one man is that right put yourself completely in his hand you put yourself completely in his hands not don't go and talk about it to other people how bad he is and all the mistakes he's made and put it all over facebook that's not god's spirit you ought to reverence and respect your husband amen i know i know i know you don't like it but that's the truth anyhow that is exactly the truth and go complain and tell others about it you're guilty you need to make it right i'm tempted to really lay it on the line right now but i want to stay with this real close i'm talking about submission wife see that she reverence her husband you take it from there brother paul talk about reverence amen see that she reverence it takes a death to self it takes a death to yourself to be born again takes the death of self there you are you shouldn't say anything about your husband but it's good husbands the same thing why should you declare to everybody else how bad he is and they did this and he did that he saw this and he did this she did this i'm talking about submission i told you this is a warning and telling the bride who she is and what she can expect and how she's a married woman amen all right you were his completely you fought clean and clear you said you told him at the at the at the at that at the at the altar that you said you made a vow to him and you said you would do it he made about to you and you said you would do it god will hold you to that bowel amen that bowel went down in eternity you break that vow you broke god's command and you will answer for it so you see young people what it means to find a wife and to find a husband you better pray and you better make sure your life is in line with this word then god will give you the husband you need and he'll give you the wife you need amen amen all right now so you put yourself completely in his hand you put yourself completely in your husband's hands and you are his every bit of your right every bit of you you put in his hands now all that you have stood for in decency and moral and everything looked at now you turn it over to a man because you surrender yourself to the man and god help that man that would bring any other any other uh influence other than decency and right and dressing god help that man that won't discern that woman to go out there she probably wants it anyway god help that man that man full of the holy ghost wouldn't want to go out the door pushed out in front and back a brother sister that's exactly the words the prophet used i have a right to use of what he used he said it that way i could bring you right back to where he said it amen it's not a laughing matter it's not a joking matter it is serious you draw attention to a man another man outside of your husband to your body you are committing adultery that man's gonna look at you the way you are i don't care how long your dress is if it's tight and you show yourself that way you are going to answer for committing adultery submit submit to the word amen i love you with all my heart but i can't love you properly if i let that go by and not say something when the holy ghost is here anointing it to be said amen amen sound clean and clear to my husband you may be you want to trim off your hair you're cutting it it's just you might as well shave it you want to wear those clothes that aren't decent and you claim to be in the message and walk down the message aisle and it and that that attention is drawn listen there are clothes you can wear that don't draw the attention that i'm talking about you know that and i do appreciate good women in here that dress decently yes but there are some that need to have a birth say who are you i'm not judging but the word is judging amen because you would have discernment about that if he had the holy ghost amen you say it or not i'll say it as loud as i can shout it that's the truth all right let's get back on track here this is on track submission amen now you turn yourself over to a man because you surrender yourself to the man can't you do the same thing to jesus christ just surrender yourself that way all that i am all that my mind all of my thoughts certainly he said i don't think you're pressed possessed by an evil spirit i think the evil spirit anoints you with them kind of thoughts trying to make you think you cannot surrender yourself to god let me show you something why would you want to surrender to him notice how quick that prophet turned that right around why would you ask me the question i just can't surrender because you want to he turns right back around and says you're asking the question because i believe you want to surrender he said he said because there's something else in in there calling to you to surrender it's a very good sign that you ought to surrender yourself another place said it's very simple yet it's hard he said just let go you're trying to hold on to yourself just let go and let him hold on to you well but he may do something that others might think is crazy yeah he may he may do some things with you that's radical but he'll never leave his word what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman now see whether she's a type of the church which has the same responsibility as a woman has sacred responsibility to her motherhood to her virtues to her husband the church has a sacred responsibility to prayer and to the word and to christ just the same as the woman has visible union 1965 you have a responsibility to christ brought prayer in the word all right can i take just a little bit more time would you give me just a little bit i'm not i'm not really at my at my changing time yet i usually preach about an hour and a half you know i'm about that way and sometimes a little longer so it's not out of my norm so just bear with me just a minute i don't think you have anything better to do nobody said amen i'll say it for you amen paul knows good and well that this that this is more important than planting right paul amen all right certainly i know he's pressed to get certain things done i we're pressed to do certain things but what's more important here comes submission regardless of how oppressed you are you can let off the pressure because he's in control all right now let me just go a little bit further because i want to get to something here i want you to turn with me to isaiah 22 22 and if i finish with this i'll finish with it remember all of this mystery all of what god had in his mind is a mystery has been given down let me just get it here all that god had is a mystery god's great secret has always blinded the wisdom of the world they can't get it they don't understand it satan don't understand it well that's a good one none of the rest of them understand it but those who are predestinated to understand it that's how god but just to those he said who are predestinated to understand it how god and christ are one notice next first phase of the threefold mystery of the seventh seal was what first phase was what god manifested god in christ what's the second christ manifested in you what's the third fact eden amen right exactly all right so god secondly the manifested christ in you look what was once god's great secret even kept it a secret wouldn't let john write it right what was god's great secret mysterious secret in his mind watch this is now now put in the hearts of the believer yes amen that's pregnation is put in the hearts of the believer that is the body of christ the believer body of christ what was once god's great secret in his mind before the foundation of the world is now made manifest think of it but god's great mystery what the eternal god has a mystery has now been unfolded in jesus christ first state first thing then given right down to his church what was once in god's mind is now in the body of christ jesus making love to the church the bride whispering secrets to her you love her so much you just tell her the secrets and get her up next to you and love you and everything you know how it is that's what god christ is doing to the church see he's letting her know the secrets just the secrets not these flirters i mean his wife all right now you see why back before last we took perfect evidence see what the evidence of the holy ghost was you can be anointed this outer spirit and still not have the word down the soil soul soul that's right that's right isn't that right what'd he come to quicken he comes to quicken his word what's laying down in there see you can have your spirit anointed feel good speak in tongue shout down i believe in all of that cast out devils he said i still don't know you be anointed to do it now you understand that i could go on i was i still had a part two on that i haven't got to but you understand amen the rain falls on the just the unjust same rain same rain one can produce the word for the season that's very important you get that the other can amen all right because you're because the seed is going to bring forth of its kind now therefore you walked with him when you were when you were in him therefore you walked with him when you were in him when he was on earth you were in him you suffered with him you died with him he was buried with him and now you're risen with him and manifested attribute of god setting in heavenly places already raised resurrected to new life setting in heavenly places in christ jesus all that means so much nowadays church that means so much to see ourselves positionally placed in jesus christ that's it only one now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband therefore we must be the word bride what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour not the bride not a creed or denomination but a living or the bride is a living oracle a living word of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride there's the focus there's god's focus right there that's what he seemed to be focusing on in every message in the formation himself in the formation of the bride formation of the bride it's the finished complete mystery of himself now we go back to eden as a masterpiece family all right now he said so we see this day is fulfilled because now the promise is being fulfilled he said now it is christ the true headship going in coming in his bride doing the same works by the same sign being the same spirit the same life the same god everything the same now we see it being fulfilled what was to come on the scene in this day the son of man in bride form the bride coming of christ there is to come on the scene brother branham said the promise is that there's come on the scene in this day a royal bride a royal seed to the royal promised son she'd be a spiritual seed she's to come on she's to come on the scene and the promise is given to us malachi 4 is one of the promises revelation 10 is another promise all these promises laying there of how he would appear in this day in this hour for our body change he had to come to receive us he had to come to unveil himself to bring us into our position and now what we must now what have we been doing we've had to lay in the presence of the sun to ripen we must lay in the presence of the sun to ripen must lay in what presence his presence where behind the door in secret luke 17 i'm going through these quickly i won't make any more time luke 17 said he said show us show us the kingdom he said the kingdom cometh not with observation he said the kingdom of god is within you [Music] and it doesn't come jesus said it doesn't come in a public show it isn't known to the public this thing that was hidden in revelation 10 this seventh seal is not known to the public that's why they think will you think you are a special people amen he's special he called me he placed me he put me here he revealed it to me i didn't pump it up and worked it up and had to think i had to do something special i gave myself in submission to the word and he does it right but i couldn't even done that unless he to put it in me to be missing it's all him but that's why in this hour those two spirits will be so close because they're both anointed with the same holy spirit but one can only bring the word for the season the other can't then brother brown said that needs to be preached about and preached on take you right back to what he said on that quote that needs to be preached about and talked about and preached on what the difference is because these two spirits would deceive if they could because they can do everything but they can't bring the word for the season in manifestation because they have no revelation of it why they lack oil dynamics have nothing to quicken there if it had the quicken it would quicken the word and you were predestinated for this season you were the seed of promise for this season now this day this scripture is being fulfilled in our years praise the lord hallelujah all right let's go through this now i want to get to this one point i said isaiah 22 22. and he said the head and the body are becoming one unit there's a lot of quotes here i'm passing up but the head and the body are becoming one unit amen you believe that you bet you he said they're becoming one unit anointed with that same spirit your anointed messiah of the hour brother man said show me a person completely surrendered to god and i'll show you a man that's omnipotent he said show me a person a bride that's so completely given over to god walking in that shekinah glory and i will show you the messiah on earth look at what he just pointed his bride to the revealing of the son of man there it is all right now he said and we see jesus pouring himself in that god is pouring himself in his people he's moving on the bride among the bride with a love affair to her pouring out himself into her and they are becoming one for the wedding supper the marriage has come amen and he's making the same manifestations in you a love affair an individual affair i don't think he mince words there no it's a love affair he called it an affair and he called this individual affair it's not a group affair if you have a group affair you've got denominationalism it never was a promise to the bride to be a group amen all right all right let's see i just i'll let you i'll let you go back and pick up in christ's mystery god revealed the headship and the body become one unit now we now when the word moves out of the body brother brown said they are husband and wife he said they are flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life spirit of his spirit amen he said they're not twain any longer he said they are one he come right out and declared that they are one how could he say that unless unless the head had been here to say it right who is this brother who is this brother brown he said i ask you who do you say it is he said it's jesus christ among us friends amen oh we'll see that man but we have his spirit in us now same person in another form same spirit he that's joined to god to the lord as one spirit you are that holy spirit word anointed word living in you that is who you are that's what god sees you are then let off the pressure bride this ought to revelate your your heart here amen amen now okay just enough to finish this up brother brown said this what a beautiful thing i'm going to say it's just before we read isaiah 22 22 and 1st corinthians 7 14 and i take another half hour no no at least eight minutes i like eight because it's eternal it's the first all right brother branham said in the messy i remember what message is on you can look it up what a beautiful thing it is just to lay your life in his hands and say here am i lord yes hear my lord just use me now lead me and guide me and direct me in the way that would be pleasing unto thee watch he did nothing but what pleased the father he won't marry another other than that character are you with me he was a son he showed us what a son would do and you become son because you had the seed in you to be quickened and now it's become flesh when he comes flesh that makes you son are you with me but what was the eternal thing was that predestinated seed in there placed in there planted in there predestinated in there all right now just use me now lead me guide me and direct me in the way that would be pleasing unto thee and now watch what he says and then don't murmur no matter what the path is stay with it anyhow that's real submission that's where you know where you're standing you know you're in christ you know christ is in you you see what the whole picture is complete submission will god have a bride like that you bet he will will he have once completely yielded yes he will yes it does yes it does he's going to have one without spot or wrinkle peculiar people wash through the filter of his word amen there's only one thing you're going to draw through that promised word for this season you're going to draw the holy ghost to quicken that seed in your life now if you want more of him that's the way you get it amen amen that's right oh now and then don't murmur no matter what the path is you stay with it anyhow and god will work it all right the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the lord amen all things work together i just won't read any more i've got a lot we could read let's just stop there now isaiah 22 i must read this because this this this to me it caps it right off here exactly what we're talking about and if you've read in the church age book you'll know what i'm referring to isaiah i should have had this marked isaiah 22 22 but it's worth repeating again and the key of the house of david the emphasis is the key and the house the key of the house david was a king the people gave him headship he just didn't move right and say i'm your king whether you like it or not no they he he had to have favor with those people they gave him the headship over the house i want you to hold that in your heart right there all right but then to do that they submitted to david that's how it was given to him all right now david had a character like god's is that right god of man after god's own heart right we can learn a lot from david if you read about david all right now so he said and the key of the house of david will i lay upon his shoulder i thought this was so good after our brother preached on the key i may read the message a key of the key to the door and nobody well i did anyway it's a good message and you realize well i won't say that yet and i will lay on his shoulder but watch where the key is where the key is laid is laid on his shoulder so he shall open hallelujah i just remembered something now see lord wouldn't let me get by with that what does cleft mean what does cleft mean when you say you're hit in the cleft or the cleft of the rock see the clef it means splitting or opening of the rock opening of the word third poll revelation 10 7. what revelation 10 7 say in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of god this day this scripture is being fulfilled right here behind skin see the mystery of god would be finished that's our message that's the seventh seal that's the message of the seventh angel that's revelations 10. all right that secret is made known brother brandon said that secret hid under those seven thunders that missed those that mystery brother bram said it was mysteries then he turned around and said it's a mystery because revelation 10 7 said it's a mystery okay but it's a mystery of god then who are you the unveiling of yeah all right see and and the state and no matter what see see you just so in revelation 10 said the mystery of god will be finished and you're to eat that mystery eat it up eat the book the book is the bride's book you ought to take it and eat it because it's your book it's revealing who you are it's revealing and unveiling himself in completeness and that's what puts the bride in the rapture brother brahms it will literally turn the heart of the people heart of the bride literally to the original faith all right now now so a cleft is a splitting of the rock or the opening the unveiling of the rock and revelation 10 7 is the third pull revelation 10 is the third reverend second first corinthians 7 4. let's take verse 3 let the husband render unto the wife do benevolence benevolence is respect due respect in the due time due season due respect to her meeting her need due respect let the husband render unto the wife do benevolence and likewise also the wife unto the husband now watch this verse the wife hath no hath not power of her own body now listen to this carefully the wife hath not power of our own body but the husband that word power is means authority the wife has not power of her own body but the husband and likewise also likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but the wife amen all right you want to keep things in order in your home obey that scripture if you want to talk about you know the order if you can read between the line there the order of it that's physical but what the spiritual is saying here revolve submission yeah yeah okay now watch this in a submission there too okay now watch now we're going to go into what now if you want to read what i'm going to read of the church age book if you have brother george's book which is what i'm going to read i hate to call it that but you know what i mean when i say that this leather bound or the red back the red the red paperback volume okay it's on page 334 through 335. i'd i'd think you'd want to go back and just read it over but 334 and 335 and in the regular church age book it's on 294 through 296. so they have a little different numbers they go by here because it's a little different print see all right i'm going to start reading here when he reads that scripture he that's the key of david and the key out of verse 22 here and the key of the house of david while i lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open and this is paragraph 38 if you want to know where the spirit now watch how who's using it the spirit uses this old testament reference concerning the lord jesus christ and his ministry in the church all right now we know that he's got a kingdom a domain he's the head of that church the body is that right his domain in my father's house are many dwelling places mansions okay and the body of christ is made up of individuals that are members of one person all right now so the spirit uses referring to the lord jesus christ and his ministry in the church what the key of david signified at that time the old testament time is mere shadow and that was a shadow pointing to a real here so it's a mere shadow which is now fulfilled in jesus standing in the midst of the lamp stands in the midst of where his body his bride in the midst of those ages in the midst of the lamp stands all right it has to do with our lord after his resurrection and not his earthly pilgrimage right but what does the key signify okay the answer lays in the position of the key it's not in his hand it is not worn around his neck it is not placed in the hands of other men or the verse could not be saying he alone has the use of that key for he alone opens and shuts and no man has that right but jesus himself the son of david that right all right it is is that isn't that right but what is where but where is the key it is on his shoulder but what does shoulder have to do with it and the gut he's referring now to isaiah 9 6 and the government shall be upon his shoulder so what does have to do with it that's where the government's laid the government of his body is laid upon his shoulder it has to be laid there amen now watch it's given something given here to him the government okay but what does this mean the answer is this the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from something it comes from the wedding ceremony of the east if you want to go back and see what the real line of the scriptural of wedding is go back and see what they did in the east amen it's just it's really contrary to our weddings today in some regards all right but what does this mean so he comes from the wedding ceremonies when the bride i love these words when the bride has been committed when the bride has been committed to the groom this is her vows are taken she's been given other words she's been given over into the hands of that man given over committed released placed in the hands of this man when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil remember rebecca went to meet isaac she was veiled why brother brown said she was coming to meet her husband so we have a bride here veiled standing and can then committed now and what's she signifying she's going to signify something now she says she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulders she takes off her veil go back to what brother brown said in proving his word go back to what brother branham said i mean yeah improving his word but also in only that woman that could or the woman or man that couldn't yield look what she had to do she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulders signifying signifying that not only is she under his dominion that she has transferred her rights to him god help us to see this spiritually the way you want us to see it she transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also also that he bears the responsibility and the care anxiousness you just cast your care on him see and the care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right let me read that again he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility and that beloved is the key of david she's under what his government she's given him the key to his house but then what does he do what has he done by placing his life in us his own faith his own life his own presence in us he's also given us the key to our house and our house isn't this our house is christ i was on a trampoline i'd do more than one flip do you understand this is powerful look at what this is saying look at here he says god being sovereign he foreknew by divine decree exactly who would be in his bride you believe that he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come in her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and to him alone brother brown another place said she is his eternal possession you are his eternal possession in order to be his eternal possession you had to be in him and being in him that makes you eternal right now on the inside eternal and not only that you're his kingdom you're his word made spirit and power in your own life all right she is wholly committed to him i like that wholly committed to him and he accept i love this and he accepts the obligation when i read that i just tell you brother sister i said that settles it you let off the pressure he's obligated to his word and i am his word made manifest amen i'm his word brother sister i am his word the revelation of jesus christ for this day is himself in bride form that's exactly what it is it had to be a complete revelation of the whole thing you him and you made you that oh praise the lord says she is holy committed him and he accepts obligation he is her head for christ is the head of the church as sarah called abraham lord even so the bride is happy that he is her lord he speaks and she obeys for that is her delight glory to god amen that is her delight amen okay i'm closing amen i'm closing praise the lord i haven't we're just only one thing you can ever do to beat the devil is rely on christ and humble yourself hey and humble yourself and let him lead you you'll never do it any other way your intellectual powers will never do it you've got to believe it just simply just rely on him he is the shepherd it ain't the sheep's business to keep the wolf away it's the shepherd's business but the sheep must stay with the shepherd in order to stay safe there is my safety zone that's in christ and christ is the word that's in your husband and your husband is the word don't fear john amen just don't don't fear john don't fear little flock all that i am your heir to all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as
