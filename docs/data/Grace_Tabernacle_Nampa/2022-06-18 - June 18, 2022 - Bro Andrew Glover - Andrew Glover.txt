you've in purpose before the foundation of the world and place it upon the hearts of my heart of my brother lord we're expecting to hear you speak through human lips tonight we receive it with joy and thanksgiving now in in thy name we ask these things the lord jesus christ amen amen let's get ready to turn the surface to our pasture let's sing on number 870 are you washed amen do you know what it is not to have one guilty feeling not to wonder where you're going when you of die past not afraid of what tomorrow holds in store and know the reason why yes that's just how it is when you go down in the water caused by fate you believed in what you heard it's no impossible dream [Music] oh [Music] it's like being born again [Music] where [Music] who's been washed white as snow not by anything we've done by the blood of god's old son are you washed by the water of the world oh yes i'm washed by the [Music] by the water of the world oh yes i'm washed flesh i am washed by the water [Music] by the water of the [Applause] by the water of the world just have to share this mini sermon when i hear these words i think about because i've been studying the book of esther and i think about when esther's time was to come before the king she went and bathed or washed herself in the water and only took what the king had provided for her she didn't call out for any other ideas any other fashion she didn't have somebody thumbing through a magazine she just simply took and when you think about the water of the word amen that is our royal garment when we wrap ourself in the word of god and and nothing can nothing can get to us then the prophet of god said we get under that blood and we stay there i'm paraphrasing this and the only way the devil can get to you is to come under the blood and i always get excited about this quote and he says if he come under the blood then you could call him brother amen that's how powerful the blood of jesus christ is i say thank you lord we're being washed and being clothed in that glorious garment well saints i just want to say this evening we will get tonight what we expect so if we are with great expectation tonight put the day behind us i had a whole list of the things i was going to do today i accomplished almost nothing but you know what put the day behind you and let's just come in this focus our brother andrew has been praying he's been studying he has things on his heart and we can draw those things tonight and we will be blessed by that so i just encourage each one just reach out tonight whatever your need is whatever your desire is express that to the lord as we invite our brother andrew just to come now saints i hope you don't mind but i gave him complete liberty of whatever god laid on his heart and whatever time it takes to express that because we didn't come tonight on some set little schedule of you know just pat us on the back and go i want to hear from god i want the word of god tonight to change me amen i don't want to walk out amen the same guy i'm going to walk out either better or worse and i've chose better hallelujah brother jason do you have one more song for us amen god bless you saints here [Music] he is here hey [Music] he is here holy holy i will bless his holy name he is here just listen closely here out your name he is here you can touch him you will never be the same one last time he is here amen he is here holy holy i will bless his name yes and closely hear him call lean out your name he is here you can touch him [Music] and you will never be the same amen can we stand this evening amen how many is that your testimony this evening amen he is here if you could turn up a little bit more be good amen we've come here tonight to honor him and to bless him amen he he is the mighty god he's the everlasting father he's the prince of peace amen everything that his word said he would be he is amen how many is glad to be a christian tonight amen it sure is an honor to be with you all once again and we sure counted a privilege and invitation for brother paul to come back out and see you all again and it's been a few days since we've been here but we sure counted an honor to be back again amen and just to be gathered with believers of like precious faith and amen i think since we've been here there's been a lot done to your building and it looks wonderful amen we're sure thankful for you for that and just before we read the word tonight let's just borrow our hearts together for a word of prayer how many would have a need upon your heart something you would like for the lord to do for you tonight amen he's here to do it heavenly father lord as we gather here this afternoon on this saturday evening lord we're well aware that your presence is here tonight and father your word has told us that we're two or three are gathered together in your name lord you said you would come and be in the midst of your children father as i look across this congregation tonight lord there's more than two or three here tonight lord there's a house full of believers here tonight lord that believe that you're the same yesterday today and forever lord we believe that your power is still real your word is still true lord your presence is still ability and powers here to sway us into that sphere tonight dear god where all things are possible now lord as we step behind this sacred desk once again father we don't take it lightly lord we know that the people that stand before us tonight is the purchase of your blood and lord hands have been lifted across this building father lord whether it be a sickness lord a healing need father lord whatever the need would be o god i invite you tonight lord may you come in the power of your resurrection lord may you heal every sickness oh god lord may you set the captives free lord may you send the spirit of liberty and revelation into this building tonight oh god lord i pray that you would strengthen us for this service lord father for those that are here tonight lord that maybe have pressed through situations to be here tonight god i invite you to come now lord have your way among us tonight lord may we be refreshed by thy presence and we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believer says amen amen if you have your bibles this evening we'll look in the book of john 17. yeah if you can turn this floor monitor up it'd be great brother the book of john that sounds wonderful the book of john the 17th chapter we want to greet you on the name of the lord we bring you greetings from our pastor our church there at home brother sean martin and the saints at faith tabernacle bringing greetings from them it's good to see everyone out tonight brother david good to see you and your wife again god bless you all amen we've sure been looking forward to being here and looking forward to the fellowship with the believers and i tell you it's just an honor after kova to be anywhere amen i tell you there for a few months it didn't know if he's going to go somewhere or stay home or what he was going to do so to be together with believers again is a wonderful thing amen i want to look here tonight in the book of john the 17th chapter and i want to look in the 15th verse of john 17. jesus here speaking if you get time it's a powerful prayer of jesus praying there in john 17 to read the whole thing but just to pull some thoughts here tonight from john 17 verse 15 the bible says i pray not that thou should estate them out of the world but that thou should escape them from the evil they are not of the world even as i am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth for thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world now watch this and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us for that the world may believe that thou has sent me now i find it amazing that jesus is not asking god to remove him from the world to manifest who he is but he's right here in the middle of the world manifesting who he is in the 22nd verse he says and the glory which they gave us me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know somebody say the world may know that the world may know that thou has sent me and has to love them as thou hast love me one other place i want to look with you tonight is the book of colossians the first chapter the book of colossians the first chapter you that study the message you know that this is brother braham's text in christ is the mystery of god revealed in colossians the first chapter another a very very powerful reading if you get time to read the whole chapter but in the 25th verse i want to pick up here paul here writing he says where of i have made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god now how many knows that brother brahma said the mind of christ is to fulfill the word so if you have the mind of christ then the desire is to fulfill the word even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles here it is which is christ in you the hope of glory christ in you the hope of glory then let me ask you who was it in john 17 it was christ who is it in the bride tonight it is christ in you we ask lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this evening uh from those passages of scripture for just a few moments here if i can i want to speak to you on a thought tonight if i title this i want to speak to you on living images of true christianity uh living images of true christianity i i am a firm believer that god has sent us it's been the most powerful message that has ever hit the face of the earth and we know that tonight and we believe that and we treasure this message and i find that according to malachi 4 it meant that god promised that he would send a message of restoration in this generation all that had been lost would be restored now abraham says in the end time evangelism he says the end time evangelist message is from malachi 4 it's a restoring he says the message and the messenger both will have to be a restoration of the faith in the book of jew just about 30 years after the crucifixion he said brethren i give all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation that you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints back there see malachi said the last days the last prophet of the old testament before the great and terrible day of the lord shall come i will send to you elijah the prophet and he will restore the faith of the children back or the faith of the children back to the fathers just before the destruction of time what is it he said it's a message that goes forth and a messenger of the last days that's not to bring them to a creed amen but to jerk them out of those creeds and bring them back to the original faith of the fathers he said the pentecostal fathers were the churches to be in the last days not the mosaic fathers but the pentecostal fathers now and then you realize that brother branham teaches that john was actually malachi 3 he said and what john done when he restored the children back to the mosaic fathers he said but what the message of malachi 4 will do is he will restore the faith back to the pentecostal fathers again he says the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the rapture what can it do according to malachi 4 is to bring them back to the faith that was once delivered to the saints see bring them back to the faith of the fathers the pentecostal part amen in the restoration time he says i will restore saith the lord that's the real event the end time evangelism so the end time evangelism is not to take away from the church amen but it is to give back what the devil has taken from the church now amen it's amazing to think that the pentecostal part of god amen was that men was not led by men amen but they was led by the spirit of almighty god you agree with that men was not led by men but they were led by the spirit of god therefore as the bride of jesus christ we have been restored amen to spiritual leadership the bible says it like this he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saith unto the churches how tragic it is that in the first stage they did not listen to the spirit amen but instead it listened to man amen but thank god in the last days there will be a group rise up amen the true bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit amen in the last day there will be a bride who will raise up and she will listen to the spirit he said in the day of gross darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of pentecost amen to welcome back the lord jesus christ amen i'll set you like this we are not a bunch of fanatics amen we are a group of people that have been prophesied amen in the bible in the message in the word we have been prophesied to be here in the age that we're living in then to think that if we are going to be the bride of jesus christ who is going to follow the leadership of god he meant then there had become a voice of leadership he meant out of all the voices that was in the world and the fact that revelation 10 7 would say in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound amen the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets he meant then the voice that we're following is not the voice of a man amen it is the voice of the son of man that has returned to this generation to lead the bride he's been from the confusions of laodicea amen from the religious ideas of the world into a place of power with god amen the bible says that the days of the voice of the seventh angel amen i need some more up here if that's possible amen my voice is weak but we're going to preach anyhow amen in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound amen the mystery of god should be finished as he declared to his servants the prophets now how many knows that this prophet is not going to be a prophet by man's desire but he's going to be a prophet by god's desire that's why the prophet said he is sending a vindicated prophet he is sending a prophet after almost 2 000 years he is sending someone i want you to catch the way i'm saying this it's not me sending myself amen but it's god sending someone he's sending a vindicated prophet he's sending a prophet after almost 2 000 years he's sending someone who is so far from organization and education and the world of religion amen that is john the baptist and alliance of old he will hear only from god he will hear only from god and he will have saith the lord and he will speak for god he will be god's mouthpiece amen and he as it is declared in malachi 4 6 amen will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect to the last day and they will hear a vindicated prophet give the exact truth as it was with paul he will restore the truth that they had he meant then the truth that had been lost would be restored to the church under the voice of revelation 10 7. he meant under the voice of malachi 4 under the voice of luke 17 30. he meant the truth of god would return to the church amen and those elect with him in that day amen will be the ones who truly manifest the lord amen and be his body and be his voice and will perform his works now amen i have to say it the way i believe it i believe the message of the hour amen has restored the truth of water baptism it has restored the truth of the godhead it has restored the truth of what happened in the garden of eden it has restored the truth of what happened amen in the are what going to happen in the future under all the symbols in the book of revelation amen the message of the hour is a perfect message it's not a man's message it's not a doctor's message amen it is the king's message and that message is bringing a faith in the church of the living god that is anointing you and meant to be more than church members to be more than just citizens they meant to be more than just husbands and fathers and preachers and deacons but this message amen is anointing you to be the bride of jesus christ amen and i'll say it to you like this amen either this message is the truth or it's not amen but i believe it is and if it is the truth amen that there's a power that will come in the church that will anoint her to be the body of the lord jesus christ mine amen to think he will restore amend the true christianity amen he will restore amen true christianity if he can restore amen the truth of the godhead the truth of water baptism the truth of merit and divorce the truth of seven seals amen that i believe he can restore have been the truth of what christianity is i'll tell you this much if you know what something is then you know what it's not are you with me if you know what something is then you know what it's not like if you're wondering what is the mark of the beast amen if you know what it's not then you know what it is and it's not the nra and it's not a covet 19 shot and it's not a chip in your computer amen it is a revelation from a devil's system amen called the called the denominations that will stamp you in the forehead now come on friends if you know that amen then that tells you when all these other people say well it's a covet vaccine and it's a chip it's a credit card you say that's not what it is because my eyes have been enlightened by a message of restoration amen that i'll sit like this when people say christians are just people that conform to a certain creed i say that's not what a christian is when they say christians is people that just goes to church i say that's not what a christian is amen because i'm following a message that has restored the redemptive identity of almighty god to the church and if i know what a real christian is then i know what a real christian is not and a real christian is not a church member that sits on the pew for 40 years and never goes anywhere with god a christian is not somebody that fusses and fights and argues and debates and looks for faults and failures amen a christian is to be the manifestation of god on the earth amen i'm sorry but i'm losing up here if you can who is probing and guessing and hoping and presuming when we are following a message that has been vindicated by the purifier that's why the prophet said is your life worthy of the gospel he said lord jesus any man physically or woman or child amen can move back the pages of the bible but there's no one that can reveal it but you he said lord then i pray taken this this text as it is placed upon my heart to send that across the nations for the people that they might know what type of life is required for them to live he said so many has asked me is the christian life a life of church service is it helping the poor and the needy is it a constant member is it a loyal loyalty to the church and such questions he said may the correct answer come tonight i'll just be honest with you brother david when i hear a prophet of god say may the correct answer come denied i'm now in position to receive the truth of the subject that is at hand he said another place we have assembled here tonight for no other purpose but to know how and to learn how by thy help to be better christians and better fit subjects for this hour that we are approaching do you realize the hour that we're living in the world is hungry to see something real amen the prophet of god said they're not waiting to see how big of a denomination we can make how well of a crowd we can get dressed how big a church we can build they're waiting to see us manifest they've been the life of the lord jesus christ in love and power they're not waiting to see how deep we can get they're not waiting to see how educated we can get they're not waiting to see how smart religiously we can become amen they're waiting to see somebody have been stand and dispound where the glory of god can fall upon a human life in this age and the same thing that was done when jesus was here will be done in his bribe listen friends i believe amen if the church of the living god is going to advance then we must have a restoration of truth and a restoration of truth is essential amen for the church to advance the church can never progress until it knows what grounds it's progressing on the church can never go further until it knows what grounds it's progressing on he said i believe before anybody can ever move or have real confidential faith it's first they have to know where they stand and how to stand after they make their stand you've got to know where you stand you've got to know how to stand and you've got to know how to keep the stand once you make the stand he said i believe that's essential for you cannot just head long plunge into something amen with faith when you don't know where you're plunging you've got to know and if our faith is set right and in the right position it gives a constant satisfaction oh my i can't stop here because i'll preach all night but if your faith is set right and you're in the right position then it will give you a constant satisfaction amen as a christian tonight amen we're all going through troubles we're all going through trials we're all going through persecution amen but as a christian there is a difference between you and a difference between the world and the difference is that no matter what you find yourself going through amen you still are satisfied amen you can be in a hospital room and you're still satisfied you'll be laying in the death bed at the grips of satan and you're still satisfied you can be facing the greatest trial of your life and you're still satisfied let me ask you where is that satisfaction coming from it's not coming from a church it's not coming from a denomination it's coming from the life that is on the inside of you they've been by the baptism of the holy ghost my i feel like preaching here tonight amen we're not a bunch of church members we're christians we're not a bunch of wannabes we're christians we're not a bunch of hitchhikers amen we're christians here tonight who has been born by the water and the blood and the spirit of almighty god my than to fake christians amen must have real confidential faith if you're going to be a christian a real christian must have real confidential faith amen i want you to catch up and hear that the most solemn confession that you can make is that you are a christian do you realize that the most solemn confession you can make is that you are a christian it's not that you're a preacher it's not that you're a deacon not that you're a pastor not that you're a missionary the most solemn confession a human can make is that they are a christian and then i'll say to you like this amen as christians we are created in the image of almighty god amen how many knows the image of god amen is an image of god that is a divine image it is not a human image it is a divine image in genesis 5 1 the bible says this is the book of the generations of adam that in the day that god created somebody say god created in the day god created man amen in the likeness of god made he man amen now watch this it was not man creating god it was god creating man but when a prophet come on the scene the way the churches was approaching it they was approaching it as god he meant as some second person of the trinity amen and man was leading god everywhere but a prophet come on the scene and said no that's not the way it is amen man did not create god and man did not evolute from a monkey amen man was created in the divine image of god in the likeness of god made he him now i want you to look at this word likeness it's a powerful word it means likeness or image amen it is the image of the son of god into which true christians are transformed think about that all the way back in genesis the fifth chapter as a true christian you've got an identity that's a powerful fault now if you go all the way back to genesis 5 verse 1 if you are a true christian you had representation all the way back there when moses was speaking what he was receiving from the pillar of fire amen the image of the son of god into which true christians are transformed amen it is the likeness not only of the heavenly body but also the most holy body and blessed state of mind which christ possesses it is the image of one in whom the likeness of anyone has seen it is applied to man on account of this power of command it is to christ on account of his divine nature and absolute moral excellence now i want you to catch something whatever was in christ amen was here in genesis 5 1. whatever was going to come out and be manifested in a man called jesus was not the nature of mary or the nature of joseph it was the nature of the almighty god that would be displayed upon the earth oh god then as christians we are to manifest amen the lord jesus christ in all ways of our lives i pray this is okay hey then that word christian or christians you know what it's used it's used three times in the bible amen the word christian or christians is used three times in the bible in acts 11 chapter and the 26th verse the bible said when he was speaking about barnabas there when he when when he had found him he brought him unto antioch and it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and they taught much people and the disciples were called christians amen first in antioch they met before they were called disciples they were called christians are you hearing me before they were called disciples they were called christians acts the 26th chapter the 28th verse the bible said that agrippa said unto paul almost now persuades me amen to be a christian amen in first peter 4 16 if any man suffer as a christian then let him not be ashamed amen for let him glorify god on this behalf the protagonist said a christian is not a tool or some kind of mechanical wrench to a great big religious regime amen a christian is not some some kind of a tool that keeps a religious organization moving that is not a christian a christian is to be christ-like a christian cannot be a christian until christ comes in the man and the life of christ in him then it produces the life that christ lived and you do the things that christ did amen if the life of christ is not in you then i hate to bust your bubble amen but you're not a christian the works of christ is not in you i hate to bust your bubble you're not a christian you say preacher i lay hands on the sick and i can preach the gospel and i can sing the glory down that is not the sign of the christian the sign of a christian is the same life that was in a man called jesus has returned to the church in the form of the holy ghost my to think tonight remember said that produces the life of christ and you do the things that christ did he said what am i talking about personal relationship to christ what am i talking about i'm talking about personal relationship to christ i'm not talking about pastor congregation relationship to christ i'm not talking about evangelist congregation relationship to christ i'm talking about a personal relationship to christ you say then preacher how can a personal relationship become between me and christ amen the new birth is the only thing that will produce a true personal relationship between you and the lord jesus christ you say preacher what is a christian amen a christian is this it is a follower of christ it means to be christ-like or like christ [Music] a christian means to be a follower of christ it means to be christ-like it means to be like christ you see we have so many explanations today and definitions of what a christian is do you realize that when brother branham was here that there was about 900 different denominations around 900 do you realize today out of one religion called christianity there's about 3 000 different branches and sex amen of different religions called christianity then what that tells me is 3 000 different or 3 000 plus amen different people are trying to identify what you are amen would you not go crazy amen if you had 3 000 different ideas about who you are as one person well the baptist said you're this and the amish said you're this and the catholic said this and the pentecostal said this and the methodist said this and the christian scientist amen all these different groups trying to identify one person amen but god sent a message in this hour that would go beyond the ideas of denomination it would go beyond the confusion explanation that men was given the church and would bring them back to an absolute and he would reveal to you amen what the real bible definition of a christian is a real bible definition of what a christian is the program said like this many times people say oh what is a christian he said some people limited to joining a church can i read this to you someone said well a christian is a church member someone who takes up their affiliations with the church i believe that all christians should do that but i don't believe that's christianity that's what a christian does after he becomes a christian now come on for you people that don't want to go to church let's preach a minute amen that's not a sign of a christian come on now amen amen it's not just showing up on easter sunday and coming back on christmas amen and if you're lucky you might show up on mother's day that's not what a christian is amen a christian is a christian regardless of what season it is regardless of what condition their family's in regardless of how cold the church is how full the church is how empty the church come on friends this message has come amen to produce real christians he said see then some say it's going to church and serving a declaration of creeds and being loyal to the things in which the church teaches and then things are all right he said others say perhaps packing a little cross or something that is the sign of a christian then there's others who believe that if they burn a candle or do some kind of a penance that's a christian if they will merely be immersed in water or they will do some sacrifice or give some good to the church or help the neighbor or buy some coal for the widow or some shoot for the orphan he said that's the ax a christian should do but that steel doesn't make them a christian come on friends amen you can bother call for the widow you can buy shoes for the orphan you can split wood for the fatherless amen that steal doesn't make you a christian he said then some says if you pack an image of christ in your car or on your wall that is a sign of a christian them things are all right amen but i don't believe that packing an image makes you a christian come on friends he said i believe that being an image is what makes you a christian it's not the pictures on your wall it's not the cross on your mirror it's not the stamp oh god hallelujah it's not the it's not the button that you're wearing on your coat amen what makes you a christian amen is when you as a human being become an image of jesus christ my the problem god said see it's not what we do outwardly it's what happened inwardly i could he told me to take my liberty so can i preach for a minute it's not what happened in outwardly it's what happened inwardly you say well preacher i'm a christian amen and i've got something on the inside if you got something on the inside it'll manifest on the outside but you cannot manufacture something on the and outside and expect to manifest it on the inside this is not a manufacturing of the life of jesus christ this is the manifestation by the quickening power of the holy ghost coming in the human heart oh god i tell you this if you get something inside you won't have to tell nobody it'll work its way to the outside now he told me to take my liberty so can i preach a second amen i happen to believe that a christian lady don't have makeup on her face i happen to believe that a christian woman ain't walking around and heals so high that it looks like she needs a ladder to get in him and a parachute to get out of come on i don't believe boys are running around in skinny jeans that are real christians come on now let's preach a minute if we're going to be christians let's be christians if we're going to be church members and lodge members and social members let's find the social gospel but this message is not a social gospel it is not a religion it is the power of god under salvation it is transforming grace with almighty god that has come down in this generation to change us from the inside out come on now you say well preacher we move beyond we move beyond preaching makeup i can tell that's why half our girls have got it on these days come on well preacher we move beyond preaching on televisions i can tell that's why most of homes have gotten again well i guess it's the evans that's coming out well preacher we've moved beyond preaching boys wearing shorts i can tell that's why we got boys that are 18 years old still running around in a pair of swords well preacher we move beyond preaching on hebrews 10 25 i can tell that's why people don't show up unless it's a special meeting or a special convention but let me say this either we're christians or we're not and if we're going to be christians let's not be christians by lip service let's be christians by a quicker than seed on the inside of our hearts it's not what we do outwardly it's what happened emily that makes us what we are then therefore he is our image and we are in his likeness and we are members of his party we should be images like him then our lives somebody say our lives our lives should reflect the image of christ mercy our lives should reflect the image of christ not in our joining church not in our pack of the crucifix or on our emotions but it should be in the living presence of the living god that's reflected through our life see then i like the song it's jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change is in my life the father god said church membership is all right i have nothing against it or any of those things but brother to be a christian means to be conformed to the image of christ we want to be living images not pack an image but be an image of the lord jesus in christianity versus idolatry he said we are made partakers of his holiness there is a redeemed bride upon the face of the earth tonight who will not bend she will not bow she will not back up he will not retreat she will stand as a living image of jesus christ will somebody give him some praise you might as well you might as well bless his name you might as well worship him you are the redeemed of the lord come on you're not buried in dead traditions you've been quickened from the dead you've been made alive in christ jesus you say made alive oh yeah the problem of god said as christ was the first one to rage from all the prophets and so forth although tied to many places he was the first fruit of those that slept are you ready for this in the bride coming of christ i love to read that quote brother paul i think i was about 15 16 years old i just started preaching on the field and i read that quote one night and a guy met me in the back of the church he said you ain't got no right to read that i said pray tell me why i don't he said because that's for a future day he said you're just confusing them people i said let me tell you something that's not for a future day that's for this day and you know why i'm still reading that quote it's because i heard brother branham before i heard that man and brother branham said this is the bride coming of christ this is the bride coming of christ it is christ amen being manifest in a body it's the waving of the chief again oh hallelujah what is the sheave amen the first one to come to maturity the first one that proved it was a wheat brother if there was one that come to maturity the reason they was waving it is because there was a whole field that was coming to maturity too and let me put that devil on notice jesus christ was not the only one to come to maturity william branham was not the only one to come to maturity but they were way before this generation as a prophetic announcement there is a field full come on ruth stay in the field there's power in the field there's bread in the field there's streets in the field there's a rapture in the field there's a body change in the field everything you have need of is in the field of the son of man come on it's in the book of ruth it's in the book of ruth don't go to no other field stay in the field of boaz ruth you want to be redeemed stay in the field of boaz you want strength stay at the feet of boaz it's the word and for the first time i love how brother says things brother paul for the first time there will come forth for the bride age it's the broad coming of christ in a bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message about not a personality amen not a group of educated men that say with brother man on the mountain somewhere and receive some backwards chimney corner story amen but there will be a message that the full maturity of the word will be turned back again in its full power and will be waved again over the people and the signs and the wonders that he did back there will return to the human flesh again by the message of the hour come on now you thought john 14 was the funeral text till the prophet come on the scene and said no it's about a theophany it's things that are to be and he said these words he said because i live ye live also we didn't know that we had a spot in scripture we thought that was to the world but a prophet come along and said he was speaking to his wife glory to god he was speaking to his wife because i live he shall live also the word which he was has been way back on the day of pentecost the word made manifest now i say it is to be waived again in the last day listen friends you didn't accidentally become a christian you was elected to be a christian brother paul can i preach for a minute amen how come after everything you've been through you're still a christian tonight sister jerry how come after everything you've been through you're still a christian tonight brother david how come after all the battles and all the trials brother jake how come after all the letdowns and disappointments you're still a christian tonight i'll tell you why you're still a christian it's because you didn't become a christian by your own desire you become a christian by god's desire and god died hallelujah god desired you from before the foundation of the world to represent him in this age so he chose you and elected you and the gene seed inside of you brother i feel like put another door in this church where do you want it are you hearing me this joy that i have the world didn't give it and the world can't take it away this revelation that i have the world didn't give it and the world came take it away it was put in me by the poor knowledge of almighty god [Music] come on church he put you in the earth to express him in this age i'm so far off my notes right now it ain't even funny come on seed you're not shuck come on seed you're not stuck you could [Applause] you cannot express yourself in the shuck you cannot express yourself in the stalk you cannot express yourself in the tassel but when the shuck had to give forth a scene there's now room come on now there's now room to be who you are you say preacher what are you saying i'm saying there's room now to worship god are you hearing me do you realize what this message done this message gives you room to shout over the word [Music] no you didn't hear that this message gives you room to dance over the word you say preacher what are you talking about people tell me all the time they say but andrew we think you're just a little bit pentecostal well brother paul i don't like them to be liars so i just say well if you're going to call me pentecostal i'm going to give you something to work with so you're not a liar fair enough fair enough i'll tell you why i'm a pentecostal it's because god sent a message and it restored me back to the pentecostal fathers and the pentecost the pentecostal part of god is back in the earth today in the pride of jesus christ you say preacher i think all this shout is getting out of hand you tell me right now is there a hot good car playing right now is somebody playing this piano it's the music going 100 miles an hour and there's people in here shouting and rejoicing and hollering you know why because this is not a music revival this is not a single revival this is a word revival and the word has been released in this generation come on friends you say brother and this is pentecostal okay let's go to upc church and i'll take the text and i'll preach one predestination they'll get quiet in a church mouse i'll take a text and i'll preach on the god head they'll sit down and go to sleep you know what but you start preaching on the godhead you start preaching about the rapture and you'll lie out of fire in this bride she won't be able to contain herself you know why because it's the revelation [Music] it's the revelation it's the quickening power of the holy ghost expressing itself come on church brother david how can i hold my peace when i am the answer i am the answer to jesus's prayer you are the answer to jesus's prayer jesus pray father when i leave the world let there be a witness in the earth that what was done in me will be done in human flesh again [Music] you are the voice you are the bride you are the christians oh god hallelujah why can't i shout why can't i rejoice it's who i am it's a word revival it's a word revival oh god brother i was on the airplane this morning and it's a good thing i didn't i tried to get loose i'll be honest with you it's a good thing there was a seat belt holding me down says just being honest i was hearing a prophet god say when you see it you rejoice when you see it you rejoice when you see it you rejoice do you see the difference between you and a pentecostal emotional meaning is there rejoicing trying to see it but you're rejoicing because you see it you're rejoicing because the word has become flesh in grace tabernacle hallelujah you're rejoicing because the word has found the body come on come on we're not we're not a bunch of babies we're not a bunch of immature christians we can stay under the anointing we can stay in the presence of god until all the greenness is baked out come on now i'm gonna turn the corner if that's okay outside of this message you'll never be a real christian come on you say can you back that up the problem of god said if your life always was an attribute of god if your life was not always an attribute of god he said then you'll be nothing but a mimic of christianity how i feel i put my choices on here tonight if the attribute of god was not always in you then you'll just be a mimic of christianity are you ready for this he said there'll be millions and billions of them they'll just be mimics of christianity there'll be millions and there'll be billions of just mimics of christianity you know what the bible says in jeremiah 17 10 it says i the lord search the heart i try the reigns even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings mark 7 7 says how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrine the commandments of men the prophet of god picks this up in the church age book he says now why does god call these churches his churches even though they are the false vine the truth of the matter is they are christians they are christians but they are not christians of the spirit come on now they are christians of the flesh they're christians but they're not christian to the spirit they're christians of the flesh he said they are bearing the name in vain fulfilling mark 7 7 but indeed they are christians for what else could they be a is a this is his religion no matter how he lives it because he subscribes in theory to what the quran teaches it's the same way a christian is a christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that jesus is the son of god the born of a virgin crucified died rose again that he is the savior of mankind in fact listen now in fact can i have a few more minutes here in fact they in this laodicean age there will be those who call themselves christians because they subscribe to the fine qualities of jesus while reserving to themselves the right to deny his deity they're christians because they subscribe to the fact that jesus is the son of god he was born of a virgin come on amen since they'll put a nativity scene out at christmas and denies mark 16. come on amen on easter they'll go put up a crucifix and do a rep of calvary and say oh we're christians in reality they're denied his deity how can i break it down you say we're denying this deity oh yeah let a drunk come to the altar well brother god bless you we got an alcoholics anonymous program and that out at me and i'll sure help you i'll tell you right now let a young person let a young person come to them and say i got a promise with pornography and they'll say now listen bro i'll tell you right now what we'll do is we'll take you to a psychologist and he'll sit there and talk to you and we'll cancel with you a little bit i'll tell you what a devil of pornography don't need to be counseled it needs to be cast out he told me to take my liberty so i might as well preach i'm this close to it i might as well cut its head off we don't need psychology in the house of god people say well preacher oh god well they said it publicly so i guess can i i can bump it publicly well the greatest psychologist ever lived was the holy ghost i resent that spirit that is a devil the holy ghost was not a psychologist the holy ghost was god himself come on church well that spirit's on the run we might as well run him back to hillary come from we really we're really going to resort back to psychologist and psychiatrist when the prophet come on the scene in a discernment line and a woman was begging for healing and brother paul she said these words she said brother branham i've confessed to god and i still can't get healed and under a supernatural sign he looks at her and says the problem is you committed adultery against your husband come on now he said you committed adultery against jesus he said here's the problem he said you confessed it to god but you confessed it to your husband he said and you'll never get healed until you confess it to your husband you didn't sin against god you stand against your husband she said oh brother branham if i would confess that to my husband he wouldn't he would leave me he said don't worry sis amen he done the same thing come on now he said he and the same thing i believe it was he was away to the military he said now you go confess he said he went to her and she went to he confessed that he confessed it to her he said you know what happened they both made it right she got healed he said and they're still serving god today brother david i love these next few words he said it brought clean living back but i really love these next words he said now listen that devil had hid from the psychiatrist for years that spirit had hid from the psychiatrist from years you know why because the psychiatrist is mental telepathy the psychiatrist is mind reading the psychiatrist is guessing in probability but the holy ghost is a discerner of the faults and intents of a heart come on church the holy ghost is a deserter of the thoughts of the intention listen the devil that he had from the psychiatrist couldn't hide from the holy ghost the devil that he had from the psychiatrist couldn't hide from the holy ghost you say what are you talking about remember it like this he said that false christian is a nominal christian and belongs to the church but he is not a true or spiritual believer he said that kind of believer is one who has been baptized into the body of christ and is a member of him but nonetheless it's god's order that the tares grow up with the wheat and they are not to be uprooted that is the command of god their day for binding and burning is coming but not yet so the spirit is speaking to the mixed group on the hand he is praising and on the other hand he is rebuking now think about this he is told what is right with a true believer what is a false christian it is a christian by the flesh what is a true christian is a christian by the spirit come on i'm not gonna preach all night but can i finish this it's a christian by the spirit it's the spirit that zechariah spoke of in the fourth chapter he said see speaking of zerubrable he answered and speaking to me saying this is the word of the lord undeservable saying not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts he says who art thou he asked a question who art thou o great mountain are you hearing me for six ages this mountain has withstood them because there was no strength to bring it down but zerubbabel who is a type of the seventh angel says who art thou are o great mountain before cerebral thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof there you are with winkings is i bring forth a headstone with noddings in between snores my bible says he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings you know what they're going to be shouting they're going to be crying grace grace grace grace hallelujah they're going to be screaming they're going to be shouting they're going to be crying grace grace unto it he said moreover the word the lord said unto me the hands of zerubbabel has laid the foundation this house in his hand shall also finish it and thou shall know the lord of hosts has sent me unto you what is this message it's not the message of legalism thank you lord this is coming fresh and a perfect place to preach it grace tabernacle amen it's not the message of legalism it's the message of grace come on church it's not the message of legalism it's the message of grace the prophet of god said jesus amen was the chief cornerstone and he's also the headstone if we will think for a minute the seventh church age messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words that's a beautiful study in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the lord not by organization not by the nomination but by the holy spirit god will bring forth the church in the last days oh help me jesus and there will be a true bride who will rise up in the last days there will be a true bride who will follow not what a man says shall follow what the spirit says and she will rise up in the power of the holy ghost and she will return to the power of pentecost to welcome back her lord are you ready for this they're going to be some shouting in the bride there's going to be some crying in the bride and it's not going to be because the guitar hit the right key and it's not going to be because the favorite song had been tickled your emotions and caused you to relate to emotion there's going to be shouting and there's going to be crying and it's going to be grace grace i shouldn't be here but grace i shouldn't be saved by grace i should have been dead but grace my family shouldn't be in the house of god but grace oh god can i share it to you from a prophet's heart he said how he's let me go all over the world around the world to nations to the millions of people seen millions coming to the lord and accept him as personal savior seen them filled with his goodness and sanctified by his power see them are you catching that word see cease oh god somebody preach with me see see them receive them come to the personal savior see them filled with this goodness sanctified by his power seen them healed by his great omnipotent power then i can cry out brother jason then i can rejoice and say it's not my power it's not my mind it's by the spirit of god it's not my education it's not my theology but by the spirit of god he saves people by the spirit of god he heals people it's the spirit of god that gives the message to the people it's the spirit of god that confirms the word come on church if anybody got a right to shout in nampa idaho it's the bride of jesus christ if anybody's got a right to let go and shout hallelujah and bless it be his name it's the bride of jesus christ you're not rejoicing trying to see something you're not rejoicing trying to see something you're rejoicing because you've seen it [Music] come on church you're rejoicing because you see brother david brother david can you imagine being there in zechariah 9. could you imagine being there in zechariah 9 and hearing the priest say your king will come writing to you up on the full of an ass and they'll be shouting hosanna hosanna in the highs could you imagine being in zechariah 9 and then be all the way over in matthew 4. amen brother paul i'm about to explode up here there's a liberty in this church right now here's a brother he's about he's about 80 years old he was over there when zechariah prophesied here he is in matthew 4 and he looks up he looks up and he says oh my hosanna hosanna hosanna he said oh worship palm branches give me one of them hosanna hosanna hosanna and some old dignified church member comes over there and says listen here brother you're getting too emotional you've been listening to too many tapes you've been fellowshipped with jesus too much hold your peace hold your peace brother he would look at that man and say how can i hold my peace when i see it when i see it how can i hold my peace come on that's not a man that's not a man that's not a crazy man riding a donkey at zechariah 9. that's my king that's my lord he's coming to me as according to his work said he would come how can i hold my peace well then you pray tell me how can i hold my peace when i see malachi 4 luke 17 30. revelation 10 john 14 12 mark 11 mark 16 matthew 28 come on church how can we hold our peace we see it we see it we see it are you ready for it we don't just see it we are it we don't just see it we are it by the baptism of the holy ghost and a new birth we are the word we are the word we got theologians we got doctors of divinity we've got great men all over the world smart intelligent educated he says but it takes the simplicity of believing god brother paul to make his word speak out to show that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever are you ready for this it takes a humble heart to dedicate takes a humble heart dedicated to god bring jesus christ and the present tense if it taken theology what would the presbyterian methodist baptist catholic and so forth oh brother paul we wouldn't have a chance as poor unlearned people but it doesn't take knowledge it doesn't take knowledge it takes the spirit i can i leave you this maybe we'll pick it up in the morning not by matt not a power but by my spirit saith god don't you love how a prophet says things brother david he says it this way he says brother says i'll unfold this mystery he's saying that in god's place he's saying god is saying i'll unfold this mystery and he andrew glover paul haylett david dean heart jason ashton he will cry to it grace grace with shoutings and crimes that's what it is today it's god's amazing grace to his people he takes the unlearned and shows he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever [Music] what are you saying preacher i'm saying true christianity is christ in you yes sir are you ready for this yes and you in christ christ in you the hope of glory christ is the mystery of god revealed now oh mercy it's a threefold purpose come on church it is the seventh seal [Applause] hold my peace hold my peace i can't i see it it's the seventh seal it's the coming of the lord it's the revealing of jesus christ it's the personal presence come on church you say oh preacher you're rejoicing to see it no i'm rejoicing because i see it i see it no brother andrew no you're wrong well if i'm wrong leave me alone i'm happy it's the seventh seal i miss close to it i might as well might as well preach it it's the seventh seal it's it's a seven seal revival it's a seven plunder revival come on church people say well you can't say seven thunders and you can't say this and you can't say he's here and you can't say seventh seal amen listen i can say it you know why i can say it because god sent a vindicated voice who said it i can't help what a man done with it when the prophet said before a false interpretation of it come and you go live oh god y'all gonna call me long winded sure is the world you go listen to it it's in the six seals in the first seal he'll say here's my revelation of it second seal third seal for seal fifth seal sixth seal here's my revelation of it and every one of those seals he will preach to you about what the white horse rider is or what the souls of the altar is or what the purge of the earth is right what it is but comes the seventh seal he says here's my revolution of it and starts talking about his own ministry come on he goes to the seventh seal and says here's my interpretation of it and starts talking about his own ministry so people say well the seventh hill's not open and that's a devil that's anointed people it's a devil that's anointed people to say the seven silk clothes because if this seventh seal ever breaks forth in a church it's like a roman candle it begins to burst all over the church come on church you want a revival quit telling chimney corner stories and preach this message you're on a revival preach the revelation you want a move of god say what a prophet say you want to see the fire of god following the church preach this message i said it the seventh seal is open [Music] put it on the internet brand me what you want to say that seal is open come on church the seventh seal is in the bride the seventh seal is christ come on it's the coming of the lord come on well brother andrew brother paul i'm trying to quit are you hearing me what with andrew i believe the sixth seal i believe it's open because it was revealed in a three-fold manner you're exactly right but you know what amazes me you don't know what makes me shout about the sixth seal we're not in it [Music] we're not in it it's tribulation israel's purged the world is purged but nowhere in there is the bride come on church but you know where she is you know where she is she's in the shaking of the mulberry tree she's in the appearance of the lord she's in the seventh seal i'm on a trail so i might as well chase that devil back to hell where he come from the seventh seal he says it like this paraphrasing it'll be revealed in a threefold manner it'll be revealed in the threefold manner all right you want to go there let's go amen christ the mystery of god revealed threefold manner first fold he reveals himself second fold by the revelation of himself he takes preeminence in a bright body the third fold is by the revelation of himself having preached in a body he leads a bride back to a garden of incondition right there is your seventh seal brother branham you said the seventh seal will be remembered for manner it will are you ready here it is it's in the rapture first thessalonians 4 the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a south first fold the voice of the archangel second fold the trump of god third for are you hearing me [Applause] come on church let's go to glory let's go in the rapture we've got the revelation it's christ life in you now when the word is revealed it expresses itself it's the seventh seal it's christ god died in flesh in order to condemn sin in the flesh that he might bring himself adam closing right here he might bring to himself a glorified glorious body redeemed back that will believe only in the word of god and brother david will not swap it like eve did for intellectual conceptions of man can i call you something you promise me you won't get mad at me hello oddballs hello oddballs hello fanatics hello crazy people hello nuts hello heretics are you hearing me come on church hello hotballs but represent to be a christian you got to be an oddball what did paul say oh god paul stood before the governor felix and brother david he said these words he said in the way that you call heresy is the way that i worship the god of my fathers [Music] you know what we've done by the paul we have limited the way of heresy to emotional worship we've said all that heresy is is somebody that'll express himself and he moves away but do you realize why paul was being called an emotional or be called was being called a heretic is because he was believing all that was spoken and written by the prophets the way of heresy is more than just running the aisles and screaming and shouting the way of heresy is to stand upon the most solemn confession and say i am a christian i believe everything that the prophet said let our musicians come you become an oddball the farmer is an oddball to the mechanic and the mechanic is an oddball to the farmer the believer is an oddball to the unbeliever and the unbeliever is an oddball to the believer [Music] can i say it to you like this and christians are the spirit are oddballs to christians of the flesh [Music] christians of the spirit are oddballs to christians of the flesh [Music] you know why because the christians the flesh don't realize why you're doing all that you're doing two services a week [Music] one's enough it is for a christian the flesh not a christian the spirit i'm not a crazy man his presence is here right now [Music] it's not a time to back off your convictions you might as well accept the fact you're an oddball worrying about what they think about you at work you're an oddball quit worrying about what your friends think about you you're an oddball he was not called or born to fit in he was called to stand out he was born for a purpose brother paul you're an oddball among pastors [Music] why you say that because you was not born to conform to what everybody else says he was born to preach the pure word to the sheep that god has given you if they scandalize your name what difference does it make i recognize it [Music] i'm trying to quit but there's a liberty in here tonight the greatest the greatest victory you'll ever get [Music] is when you quit worrying about what people think about you and you just be who god called you to be [Music] if god called you to see this revelation quit apologizing for it if they walk off let them go they did it to jesus [Music] come on but there's some people here who can't walk off they've been impressed they've been sealed by this revelation they've been sealed by this revelation of the son of man now brother graham says it this way he said you know there were millions in sin when i got saved but he had a purpose in saving me i'm an oddball amongst the brethren many times because i believe in predestination the seed of the serpent baptism in the name of jesus christ all these other things that seem to be and the visions and the power of christ return back and condemning organizations and things i'm an oddball i i'm the oddball but he had a reason to save me a purpose for doing it let us stand our feet tonight i am proud to be an oddball [Music] if it makes me a fanatic to say the seventh hills open then i'm a fanatic [Music] if it makes me a fanatic to say this is the right age then i'm a fanatic if it makes me a fanatic to say this message is rapturing faith and i'm the fa if it makes me a fanatic to say it's going to take more than stories to make a rapture then i'm a fanatic not ashamed of it i'm not hiding from it it's who i am beat me stalk me kick me out persecute me but when you all get down i'll still be a fanatic [Music] because there's nothing there's nothing you can do to me in time that could change what god put in me in eternity [Music] and god put a seed in me from before the foundation of the world that when this pressure would come brother paul we wouldn't blow out and blow up and give out it manifest [Music] right amen [Music] the devil hates you brother sister jerry the devil hates you because every persecution that comes up on the church it just gets stronger [Music] i'll tell you where i've come to okay you all ought to know me by now i've come to a place where i actually shout over persecutions that's exactly right you say how do you do that don't you hurt oh yeah i hurt why i'm hurting i'm worshiping you know why because i know when the persecution's over i heard a prophet say the persecution makes the believer stronger [Applause] so i say devil you thought you had a file on your hands before you put this persecution on me you just wait till it's over [Music] you think we're just gonna stop before you persecute us you just wait till it's over i feel like david right here tonight you don't like me shouting because the ark of the lord has returned you didn't like that then watch this you don't like me preaching the message i'll preach it that much harder you don't like us reading quotes we'll read 20 more come on it's who we are it don't matter what pressure you put us under it's who we are we're christians we're holy most filled spiritual believers we're not a bunch of christians in the flesh we're christian to the spirit manifesting in the life of jesus christ [Music] do you realize tonight as a christian you can manifest god under any kind of pressure [Music] and as i as i prepare to end this i want to ask you this one question have you got what it takes to be a christian in the most difficult hour you say preacher where you going with this i'll tell you i'm going with it i'm going to a story the prophet of god told he said a man sit down at the bar room one night and his buddy said there's no such things as real christians left in the earth he said there's no such thing he said now here's what you have to do he said that man told his buddies that or his buddies told him that and he looked at him and said wait a second he said there is he said there's a real christian and it's my wife brother david she wasn't there hearing the conversation they said oh yeah prove it he said okay follow me home so he took him home he walked in they was all sitting there and his wife come in and she said hi honey how are you and he said good he said woman fix me she went in there began to scramble the eggs however she fixed him scrambled and fried him over easy whatever brought him and sit down for him he took that plate of eggs and threw it in the floor said woman you know i don't like my eggs like that brother david [Music] she squared her shoulders back said bless god i'll tell you one thing you ain't gonna tell me what to do i'll tell you right now but in that moment who she was was activated who she was was activated and without raising one finger without lifting her voice she walked over and began to pick up the broken pieces and begin to say must jesus bear the cross alone and all the world will go free there's a cross for you there's a cross come on friends she didn't know the conversation at the bar room so she didn't have time to manufacture something it was either there it wasn't there she didn't know that her testimony was on the line when he threw them eggs before but the difference was she was not a christian by the flesh she was a christian in the spirit i'm saying sometimes as a true christian you'll have to pick up the broken pieces [Music] but can you do it and remain a christian father let the world know let's put our hearts together tonight that the world may know [Music] heavenly father we bow our hearts before you tonight father your spirit is here in the building your anointing and liberty has broke through upon your people tonight now father i pray if there be one here tonight who's a christian by the flesh i pray oh god you would quicken that soul tonight lord if there be one that's a christian because they go to grace tabernacle because brother paul's their pastor because they found it a better church to associate with or they like the music or they like the singing or they just come because well i'll just be honest with you i really like the way brother paul preaches and they're not manifest to what he's preaching oh god may you come by their way tonight father i pray tonight if there be one lord there be one here tonight dear god that doesn't have that on the inside of him that if tomorrow order after the service we would be putting a trial or we'll be putting a hard spot if we didn't have what it takes to manifest you may you give it to us tonight dear god lord we don't want to be mix of christianity lord we don't want to be false christians we want to be true christians we don't want to be christians of the flesh we want to be christians of the spirit father if there's one here tonight dear god who's ashamed they're ashamed to say what they believe they're ashamed to say what they see oh god by the power of the holy spirit release them from that bondage of tradition release them from that bondage of fear release them from that bondage it would keep them from the revelation that you've seen in this generation oh god may you release them to not father lord if there's a young person here maybe they're at that teenage years or they're those teenage moments or those those moments as a as a young boy or a young girl and they're feeling the pressure the pressure to be something that they're not peer pressure pressure from friends pressure from school pressure from college pressure from their job maybe even pressure from unbelieving family members [Music] god i pray tonight you would release a courage in that vessel i pray oh god you would release your strength in them father lord to have as your prophet talked about that man walking down the street with a sign on his back i'm a fool who's full are you i'm a fool for christ [Music] remember said that man had a different kind of smile he had a smile of contentment he had a smile of satisfaction granted tonight dear god i pray in jesus christ in jesus christ's name in jesus christ's name with every head bowed ever i closed just raise your hand to it let the spirit come by right now and minister to you let the spirit minister to you now hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i give myself away i give myself away so you [Music] i give myself to you lord i give myself to you to be an oddball i give myself away as that brother comes give myself away so you if anyone needs prayer tonight we'll be glad to pray for you god bless you tonight friends give yourself away give yourself to the spirit the spirit of revelation the spirit of wisdom the spirit of christ oh here [Music] is [Music] [Applause]

is myself to you [Music] i give myself to you [Applause] [Music] away so you can use me if you'd excuse me for one moment [Music] on a day of pentecost you know what an upper room is that's a room above another i want you to think where you are tonight you're in a room above another we can have the same holy ghost in this upper room as they had that night i say or that day i say to you don't walk away from the moving of the holy ghost give yourself away that we can walk out with the same feeling of the holy ghost that they had no excuses no alternatives no reason why i can't tonight but i can stand and say lord i live my hands tonight and i lift my heart most of all tonight lord i give myself away may your holy spirit come lord move in our midst today lord move in our midst oh lord make everything that's hindrance everything that's distraction everything that draws us away from you lord we are in this upper room lord we've heard the word preached your presence is here [Music] oh lord i read the words when the prophet says lord help me be more sincere my heart breaks within me oh lord if you thank you hallelujah just on my heart during this service listen the little song come holy spirit i need thee that is my prayer tonight come holy spirit i don't want to just talk about it saints the day of the message being god sent a prophet is good for the one who doesn't know but we are mature believers we are coming up in the maturity as sons and daughters of god and we've got to move on we've got to move on because our future is not behind us it's not our life i should say is not behind us it's not even here now it's in the future as it were because you see we've been called to dwell in heavenly places and i'm going to take what the prophet said and draw that portion of heaven right down tonight and i'm going to step into that and claim that portion of heaven for me and for you tonight amen that portion might be your healing it might be your deliverance oh my brother and sister when you have as our our brother mentioned this when you have the spirits of this age even causing the denominational churches to to be bound up and say we need a deliverance from these things my brother and sister they're going to go for the oil because they are crying for a deliverance but god has i'm going to say this positive god has already given us deliverance he's already poured his spirit out on us and already the yoke of bondage is broken and we have liberty can we say liberty in the name of jesus christ we have liberty hallelujah oh hallelujah oh come on holy spirit oh grace tabernacle needs you lord [Music] oh [Music] holy spirit i need thee come sweet spirit i pray [Music] oh [Music] in christ alone [Music] christ alone i place my trust find my glory in the power of the cross every victory let it be said of me my source of strength my [Music] glory oh i comprise myself in battles one for i've been blessed by [Music] i could stop and count successes like diamonds in my hand but those trophies [Music] and find my glory in the power of the cross in every victory can it be said of me a source of strength a source of hope is christ alone in christ alone do i glory for only by his grace i am redeemed for only his tender mercy could reach beyond my weakness to my needs and now i seek no greater honor in just to know him more [Music] i place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross in every victory let it be said of me a source of strength my source of hope is christ alone now look at how this is this just struck me my source of strength see what god's doing he's turning our eyes from ourself entirely on him to the world that say well i'm i'm gonna do this for me or i'm gonna no no i'm sorry all i am and all i will ever be christ did for me every moment of strength i've ever had in my life it was him every prayer answered him every deliverance him every blessing him oh hallelujah in christ alone oh hallelujah brother
