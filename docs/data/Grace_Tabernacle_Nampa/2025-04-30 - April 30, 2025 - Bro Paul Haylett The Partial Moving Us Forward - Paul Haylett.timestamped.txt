[12:47] Good evening to you

[12:50] all. Why don't we start with that song

[13:03] [Music]
[13:05] Indeed. Be thou my

[13:26] thou my best
[13:30] thought by day or by night.

[14:05] Lord. Thou my great
[14:11] father, I thy true son.
[14:16] Thou in me
[14:20] dwelling and I with thee one.
[14:27] riches I need not nor man's empty
[14:35] praise. Thou my
[14:40] inheriteritance now and
[14:45] always. Thou and thou
[14:50] only, first in my
[14:55] heart, high king of
[15:00] heaven, my
[15:02] treasure. Thou
[15:05] art now. Thou my breast, shield, my
[15:11] sword for the

[15:57] May I reach
[16:00] heaven's joys, oh bright heaven
[16:06] son, heart of my own heart,
[16:13] whatever
[16:16] befall, still be my
[16:21] vision, oh
[16:23] ruler of
[16:28] all. Amen. Let's go to number
[16:32] um 447. We'll sing he abides with
[16:37] [Music]
[16:42] me. Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[16:47] walk the pilgrim way for the hand of
[16:51] God. In all my life I
[16:53] [Music]
[16:55] see. And the reason of my bliss. Yes.
[16:59] The secret all is this. That the
[17:03] comforter abides with
[17:08] me. He
[17:11] abides. He
[17:14] abides. Halleluah. He abides with me.
[17:22] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[17:26] the narrow way. For the comforter abides
[17:32] with
[17:34] me. Once my heart was full of sin. Once
[17:39] I had no peace within. Till I heard how
[17:43] Jesus died upon the
[17:47] tree. Then I fell down at his feet and
[17:52] there came a peace so sweet. Now the
[17:56] comforter abides with
[17:59] [Music]
[18:00] me. He
[18:04] abides. He
[18:07] abides. Halleluah. He abides with
[18:13] me. And I'm rejoicing night and day. as
[18:18] I walk the narrow way. For the comforter
[18:23] abides with
[18:26] me, and he is with me
[18:30] everywhere, and he knows my every care.
[18:34] I'm as happy as a bird, and just as
[18:40] free. For the spirit has control. Jesus
[18:45] satisfies my soul. Since the comforter
[18:49] abides with
[18:52] me, he
[18:56] abides. He
[18:59] abides. Halleluah. He abides with
[19:05] me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[19:10] walk the narrow way. For the comforter
[19:15] abides with
[19:18] me, and there's no thirsting for the
[19:22] things of the world, they've taken
[19:25] wings. Long ago I gave them up and
[19:31] instantly. And all my night was turned
[19:34] to day. All my burdens rolled away. Now
[19:40] the comforter abides with
[19:44] me. Oh he
[19:47] [Music]
[19:48] abides. He
[19:51] abides. Hallelujah. He abides with
[19:58] me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[20:02] walk the narrow way. For the comforter
[20:07] abides with me. He abides. Oh, he
[20:14] abides. He
[20:17] abides. Halleluah. He abides with
[20:23] me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[20:28] walk the narrow way. For the comforter
[20:33] abides with
[20:37] me. Amen. Number 482,
[20:41] [Music]
[20:44] please. We find many people who can't
[20:50] understand why we are so happy and free.
[20:56] We've crossed over Jordan to Canaan's
[21:00] fair land. And this is like heaven to
[21:06] me. This is like heaven to
[21:11] me. Yes, this is like heaven to me.
[21:17] I've crossed over Jordan to Canaan's
[21:21] fair land. And this is like heaven to
[21:27] me. So when we are happy, we sing and we
[21:32] shout. Some don't understand us, you
[21:37] see. We're filled with the spirit. There
[21:41] is not a doubt. And this is like heaven
[21:46] to
[21:46] [Music]
[21:47] me. Oh, this is like heaven to
[21:53] me. Yes, this is like heaven to
[21:58] me. I've crossed over Jordan to Canaan's
[22:03] fair land, and this is like heaven to
[22:07] me.
[22:09] We've heard the sweet music, the
[22:12] heavenly court from glory land over the
[22:17] [Music]
[22:19] sea. A soul thrilling message from Jesus
[22:24] our Lord. And this is like heaven to
[22:29] me. Oh, this is like heaven to
[22:34] me. Yes, this is like heaven to me.
[22:40] I've crossed over Jordan to
[22:45] gain and this is like heaven to
[22:48] [Music]
[22:51] me. Amen. Before we go to our prayer,
[22:53] let's sing number 698.
[22:57] [Music]
[23:04] I've the mountain with
[23:11] Jesus and I've been in this valley.
[23:17] Oh
[23:20] Lord, but
[23:23] never one time has he failed
[23:30] me. To him with my
[23:35] troubles I go.
[23:41] Oh,
[23:42] let me walk with you,
[23:48] [Music]
[23:49] Jesus. Don't
[23:53] ever leave me
[23:59] alone. For
[24:01] without you,
[24:04] I could never.
[24:10] No,
[24:12] never make heaven my
[24:19] home. You found me when I was so
[24:29] lonely. You found me when I was so blue.
[24:40] You found me when no one would love
[24:49] me. And no one knew just what to
[25:00] do. Let me walk with you, Jesus.
[25:09] us. Don't
[25:12] ever leave me
[25:18] alone. For
[25:21] without you,
[25:23] I could
[25:28] never. No.
[25:31] Never make
[25:33] heaven my home. One more
[25:38] time. Oh,
[25:41] let me walk with you,
[25:48] Jesus. Don't
[25:52] ever leave me alone.
[25:59] For
[26:01] without you
[26:03] I could
[26:11] never make
[26:14] heaven my
[26:18] home. Amen. We're going to go to
[26:21] prayer. Um I'll ask brother David if you
[26:24] could lead us in a word of prayer. Let's
[26:27] remember uh brother David Lunsford,
[26:30] sister Sarah's dad, his passing. We'll
[26:33] just remember the family um
[26:36] especially brother
[26:38] Gideon and um there's a request for
[26:41] saints in South Africa as well. And many
[26:45] are not here today. Brother Ivan,
[26:47] brother Isaac, um I don't know, Sister
[26:49] Carrie, maybe not feeling well today.
[26:51] No. Um
[26:53] they're helping
[26:57] Christian just came home from the
[26:59] hospital. All right. Also remember them
[27:01] a prayer as well then with

[27:10] David. Let's bow our heads. Our precious
[27:14] father, we bow before the King of
[27:16] Kings, the Lord of Lords, our Redeemer,
[27:20] our salvation, our
[27:22] strength. And Lord God, we just are
[27:27] please are thankful that we can be
[27:30] assembled here
[27:31] tonight. You just simply said where two
[27:34] or three are gathered together in my
[27:36] name, there am I in the midst. You've
[27:40] heard these requests, Lord. You knew
[27:41] they would be asked. We pray for the
[27:44] peace of the Lunsford family, Sister
[27:47] Wanda, Sister Sarah, her brothers, the
[27:51] family. Lord, we ask you to comfort
[27:53] them, strengthen them, be with them,
[27:56] decisions to be made. Oh God, I pray
[27:59] your hand be upon them. Our brother
[28:01] Ivan, brother Isaac, his family, Lord,
[28:05] and sister Nadia. Lord, I pray that your
[28:07] hand would be upon them
[28:09] also. Give them what they have need of,
[28:12] Lord. We are all very needy people, but
[28:16] we have this assurance that you said, "I
[28:19] will supply all of your need." So,
[28:22] Father, we just remember this
[28:26] our one coming from the hospital, Lord,
[28:29] Sister Demi, and their little baby. And
[28:33] Lord, I pray for that one, Lord, to be
[28:36] strengthened.
[28:38] Lord, other requests. Lord, I know that
[28:40] you are totally in control of every one
[28:43] of these things. We are expecting you to
[28:46] speak tonight. Give us what we have need
[28:48] of. We've come here to be fed. We've
[28:50] come here to be drawn closer to thee.
[28:52] We're expecting to leave here not the
[28:54] same as we came, but drawn closer to
[28:58] thee. Bring deliverance and healing now
[29:00] to those that need
[29:02] healings, Lord, we pray. and for thy
[29:04] glory committing these needs to you
[29:07] giving you praise for answering. In

[30:45] lonely

[34:03] 702. Maybe let's dance together as we
[34:05] sing
[34:06] this. Give me your
[34:11] hand and let's agree together.
[34:18] that all of our
[34:22] eneies will crumble at our
[34:28] feet. And
[34:29] whatever we bind on
[34:33] earth shall be bound in heaven.
[34:40] For at the name of
[34:45] Jesus, Satan has to
[34:51] flee. Oh, we've got the
[34:57] power in the name of Jesus.
[35:04] We've got the
[35:08] power in the name of the
[35:15] Lord. Though Satan
[35:20] rages, we cannot be defeated.
[35:27] We've got the
[35:32] power in the name of the
[35:39] Lord. And for many years
[35:44] now, saints have tried to stop us.
[35:51] Oh, but the bride of
[35:56] Jesus, Lord, we're still
[36:01] alive. And like a
[36:04] mighty
[36:07] army, we keep maring
[36:13] onward, fighting every
[36:19] battle. Cuz the Lord's on our
[36:25] side. We've got the
[36:31] power in the name of Jesus.
[36:38] We've got the
[36:43] power in the name of the
[36:49] Lord. Though Satan
[36:55] rages, we cannot
[37:01] be at
[37:07] the in the name of the
[37:12] Lord. Let's give a little hand clap of
[37:15] thanks and praise to our Lord. Amen. How
[37:19] beautiful. Amen. We could not sing that
[37:23] song. We've got the power if we were
[37:26] talking of ourselves. Amen. And we just
[37:29] thank the Lord that he has given a
[37:31] revelation. Actually, that's what it is.
[37:33] Just listening to the prophet speak. And
[37:36] the victory we have in this day is
[37:39] revelation to you and I. It's not just
[37:42] words. Some people say you're just
[37:44] speaking words. The prophet says it's a
[37:47] revelation of your overcoming power, the
[37:52] Holy Ghost in you. Amen. And I just have
[37:55] to say thank you Lord for that because
[37:58] without the Holy Ghost, Amen. Just as
[38:01] the word says, we couldn't even call him
[38:03] the Christ without the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[38:07] And that just makes my heart excited.
[38:10] Amen. You know, another thing makes me
[38:14] excited to call brother Trevor
[38:17] grandpa. Amen. That means he has
[38:20] officially joined the older
[38:24] generation. So, I'm sorry, brother
[38:26] Trevor, but you you'll be happy to be
[38:28] here. It's a good position to be in. So,
[38:31] we're so happy that Demi delivered a
[38:34] healthy, happy boy and that she's good
[38:36] and and Christian doing good. Amen. I
[38:40] look at that young man and I just think
[38:43] Lord just unleash the potential that's
[38:45] in him. Amen. So good to be here. So
[38:49] many so many things, you know, I just uh
[38:52] you might say reminiscing after sister
[38:55] Jerry notified me today that uh brother
[38:57] David Lunsford had passed. Uh we had a
[39:00] lot of good memories. He would come up
[39:02] to see the family and and um brother
[39:05] David, sister Diane has been a little
[39:07] bit of this. we would all go over and
[39:09] eat at the orchard house and and just uh
[39:13] be relaxed and to be able to do that.
[39:15] And um we're going to miss him. Amen. I
[39:20] know that sister Sarah uh bittersweet,
[39:24] but to be there at the passing of her
[39:26] dad and we just want to remember the
[39:29] family. Amen. And uh also I think we
[39:33] announced it uh brother Ivan had text
[39:36] and said that they would not be able to
[39:38] be here tonight. So we want to remember
[39:40] them. Um brother Isaac doing better but
[39:44] still kind of has that stomach issue. Uh
[39:48] so we just want to keep on remembering
[39:49] them. There's so many you might say not
[39:53] minor. There's no request that's minor.
[39:56] But um anyway, once again, uh we're
[40:00] happy our sister April's made it back um
[40:04] from that location and um just uh uh
[40:09] appreciate what she is uh doing in that
[40:12] natural side. Someone showing the
[40:14] compassion of Christ uh to to people. We
[40:19] want to remember uh brother Ruben
[40:21] Daniels. I don't know, it's probably not
[40:23] a familiar name to you, but brother
[40:26] Ruben uh pastors a church in Ran
[40:29] Fontaine, South Africa. Uh I've had the
[40:32] privilege, sister Jerry and I, visiting
[40:34] their church, ministering there. Uh uh
[40:38] brother Ruben, I'm not sure exactly what
[40:40] kind it is, but um Brother Rubin has
[40:44] cancer and uh it has just uh reduced him
[40:48] down to just a small portion of who he
[40:52] is, right? Just uh very very uh hard on
[40:56] him. Uh so please remember brother Ruben
[40:59] Daniels in prayer. Lovely brother,
[41:02] lovely church. um and um that the Lord
[41:06] would just come on his behalf and touch
[41:09] him. And also the the church there uh
[41:13] Emanuel Gospel Center, my my heart very
[41:16] much connected to them. So many dear
[41:18] friends and we want the Lord to just
[41:21] come down and just take all the question
[41:23] marks away. And I know there'll probably
[41:26] some of them that will listen to this
[41:28] service and uh we just want to take all
[41:31] the undercurrents. Ask the Lord to take
[41:33] all the undercurrents away and just give
[41:35] very direct leadership to them. They as
[41:38] a group of believers, now this wording
[41:40] might not be correct or the best, but
[41:44] they're lovely group of believers and
[41:46] they deserve a Holy Ghostfilled sincere
[41:49] pastor. Amen. Someone who can just unite
[41:53] them together and take them on to the
[41:55] rapture. So, uh we want to continue to
[41:58] remember them in prayer. Amen. youth
[42:02] meeting this Friday evening at 700 pm
[42:04] here at the church. Let's turn to our
[42:06] Bibles. Ephesians the third chapter.
[42:08] Thank you so much. Uh I enjoyed the song
[42:11] service. Thank you musicians. Amen. Uh
[42:15] just uh felt a nice calm peace. uh in a
[42:19] day um I I'm not speaking or confessing
[42:23] myself into this, but in a day filled
[42:25] with all kinds of little distractions
[42:28] and little things to um oh, how will you
[42:32] say that? They have the ability to raise
[42:34] your blood pressure. Uh you know, and
[42:37] you face those. It was just nice to be
[42:39] able to come in the music uh calm and
[42:42] soothing. The song service just calming
[42:44] and I thank the Lord for that. Ephesians
[42:47] 3. Now, this will be the same scripture
[42:50] that uh I I used in a sermon just before
[42:54] we went to South Africa, but I feel
[42:56] really led to continue down this
[42:59] thought. I preached it on a Sunday, but
[43:01] we're going to pull it into a Wednesday
[43:03] night thought. And um so, we're going to
[43:06] be talking on uh the partial uh moving
[43:11] us forward. Amen. And that might seem
[43:13] like a a little strange uh title, but uh
[43:18] taking it from what the prophet of God
[43:20] talked about, partial realization
[43:22] becoming a full
[43:25] realization. Amen. We'll be looking into
[43:28] that thought along that vein. Amen.
[43:31] Ephesians 3:10. to the intent that now
[43:34] unto the principalities and powers in
[43:36] heavenly places might be made
[43:39] known by the church the manifold wisdom
[43:42] of God. And I would say tonight Lord let
[43:44] us know your wisdom. Come down father
[43:48] speak to our hearts and open our minds
[43:52] to understand the wisdom of God
[43:55] according to the eternal purpose which
[43:57] he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord. in
[44:01] whom we have boldness. And I I if I
[44:03] could if I could highlight that and put
[44:06] that in the most giant capital letters.
[44:09] Uh amen. That we have boldness. I think
[44:13] something that's lacking uh in the
[44:16] church and in the message is is uh we're
[44:20] not moving forward in any kind of a
[44:22] boldness. God made the promise. You
[44:25] didn't make it. That's right. Brother
[44:27] Brandham didn't make it. God made it.
[44:30] And therefore we should be able to
[44:33] absolutely come with a boldness and say
[44:35] if if our Lord Jesus Christ if he said
[44:39] it it is going to happen and then we
[44:43] could put the biggest period right on
[44:46] the end of that settled done because he
[44:49] said it. Amen.
[44:51] Amen. In whom we have boldness and
[44:54] access with confidence by the faith of
[44:56] him. Wherefore I desire that you faint
[44:59] not at my tribulations for you, which is
[45:02] your glory. For this cause I bow my
[45:04] knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus
[45:07] Christ, of whom the whole family in
[45:09] heaven and earth is named, that he would
[45:12] grant you according to the riches of his
[45:15] glory to be strengthened with might by
[45:18] his spirit in the inner man. Amen. Now,
[45:21] the physical man, God will touch the
[45:23] physical man, but it's the inner man
[45:26] that really matters. Amen. Because this
[45:28] old flesh is just aging. I I don't know
[45:31] where the wrinkles come from. I don't
[45:34] know where, you know, all of these
[45:35] things come from, but I tell you, the
[45:38] inner man is getting closer to whom my
[45:41] theophony said I would be, and it's
[45:43] drawing me into it. Amen. So, the body's
[45:46] aging, but God's pulling us into our
[45:49] youth. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[45:53] Amen.
[45:59] that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
[46:01] faith, that ye being rooted and grounded
[46:03] in love, may be able to comprehend with
[46:06] all saints what is the breadth, the
[46:09] length, and depth and height, and to
[46:11] know the love of Christ, which passes
[46:15] knowledge, that you might be filled with
[46:17] all the fullness of God. Now unto him
[46:20] that is able to do exceeding abundantly
[46:23] above all that we ask or think according
[46:26] to the power that workketh in us. Unto
[46:29] him be glory in the church by Christ
[46:31] Jesus throughout all ages world without
[46:35] end. Amen. Amen. Thank you Lord. We ask
[46:39] you to bless this time. The saints that
[46:40] are unable to be here today and every
[46:43] need we commit to you in the name of
[46:45] Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated.
[46:50] As we look at this, just to touch on
[46:53] this scripture, I I believe here in the
[46:55] book of Ephesians, it's laying out to us
[46:58] a very solid foundation or footing for
[47:01] us to take and hold on to to look at
[47:05] these things and say, you know what,
[47:07] this I don't care what I see around me.
[47:10] This is my promise in the word. And and
[47:13] God's made this real to us by
[47:15] revelation. These are not just
[47:17] scriptures that we read, but this is the
[47:19] very life of Christ. If we could just
[47:22] envision that we're sitting there now in
[47:26] the under the porch on a chair and our
[47:29] Lord Jesus Christ is sitting right there
[47:32] having conversation with us. Uh this is
[47:34] the way I feel like we should take this
[47:37] that he literally is here in a personal
[47:40] conversation. Not just scripture we
[47:42] refer back in time but a personal
[47:45] conversation that is being spoken to us
[47:49] and uh as it is the word of God no
[47:51] matter who preached it. Amen. It is the
[47:55] word of God and uh so I say Lord help
[47:59] us. Now here again I want to read to you
[48:02] a quote that I read of those services
[48:04] here a couple weeks ago. uh I think it's
[48:08] a very pertinent out of the 70th week of
[48:10] Daniel and uh in the last days is when
[48:13] God is going to reveal these secrets to
[48:16] the church. Now to put a very bold
[48:20] punctuation there if we could put a gap
[48:22] in there that that this last days and we
[48:25] are living in the last days my brother
[48:27] and sister without a shadow of a doubt
[48:30] there is not another age to come. The
[48:32] prophet of God preaches about a bride
[48:34] age, but that's a spiritual condition.
[48:37] Amen. That is not a natural time span of
[48:42] an age coming, but that's a spiritual
[48:44] condition that the bride is coming
[48:46] because she's stepping out of the
[48:48] atmosphere and influence of Leodysia
[48:52] into a whole another realm. And the
[48:54] world does not know that realm. They do
[48:56] not understand that. And the prophet of
[48:58] God says, "Neither will they understand
[49:01] it because they were not called to
[49:03] understand it." That shows us really how
[49:05] privileged we are as a people that God
[49:08] would open our eyes and open our ears.
[49:10] It's not something that we want to be
[49:12] flippant or arrogant or any of those
[49:15] things, but realization, a boldness, if
[49:18] we would go back to that, that God has
[49:20] says, "I called you from before the
[49:22] foundation of the world, and now I'm
[49:25] proving that I called you." And so we
[49:28] live in that realm. You know, the
[49:30] prophet of God shows us that the bride
[49:32] is going to be small in number. And so
[49:34] many people just reading something
[49:36] recently, somebody says, "Oh, there's
[49:39] going to be a a great falling away
[49:41] amongst the bride because and they had
[49:44] their idea of what a small number was."
[49:46] Well, my brother and sister, we know in
[49:48] re realization that that uh the small
[49:51] number is going to be relevant number,
[49:55] right? But who knows what that number
[49:57] is? You know, I I couldn't sit here
[49:59] today and say uh uh you know, there's a
[50:02] small number here in this service
[50:04] tonight. So, we must all be in the
[50:06] bride. My brother and sister, that small
[50:09] number is relevant to God's thinking and
[50:12] God's thinking alone. Nobody can just
[50:14] say it has to be less than this number,
[50:16] less than that number. Now, the prophet
[50:18] of God made reference, but you sometimes
[50:21] need to put it under a spiritual
[50:23] application and not sit there with your
[50:26] calculator and figure out how many
[50:28] people on earth. And so, the bride's
[50:30] going to be just this number. It doesn't
[50:33] work that way. So, as we look at this in
[50:36] the last day, God is going to reveal
[50:37] these secrets to the church. He hasn't
[50:40] done it before. And the reason he hasn't
[50:43] done it is to keep the church watching
[50:46] and praying all the time, not knowing
[50:49] when it was coming. But you remember in
[50:51] Daniel 12, he said, "The wise shall
[50:54] understand." Oh my, look at this, my
[50:57] brethren. This is why we need God's
[51:00] wisdom because the wise are going to
[51:02] understand what the word is saying. The
[51:06] wise are going to understand the moving
[51:08] of the spirit and the prophet of God.
[51:11] Now, we can take some of these things
[51:12] the prophet said and put it in totally a
[51:15] carnal literal sense. And brother Brown
[51:17] said read between the lines. But as I
[51:19] look at my Bible today, there is nothing
[51:22] printed between the line. So if we come
[51:25] in a carnal sense, we're not going to
[51:27] understand. But when the Holy Spirit
[51:29] moves upon us and we start to understand
[51:32] by a supernatural revelation, God
[51:35] speaking to us, it might be a midnight
[51:37] hour, it might be noon time, but God is
[51:40] speaking through the spirit to his bride
[51:43] and she understands. Amen. So it is the
[51:47] wise shall understand in the last in
[51:50] this last day. See, it's been given to
[51:52] him. the spirit of wisdom. My my brother
[51:57] and sister, we got a lot of people pray
[51:59] or claim they've got
[52:01] revelation. But another factor that
[52:04] really should weigh in our life is do we
[52:06] have the spirit of wisdom? That's right.
[52:08] We can say we understand and
[52:11] intellectually many a person can explain
[52:14] many things. But is there real wisdom
[52:17] there? And I say Lord help us reveal
[52:20] give us a revelation of real wisdom to
[52:24] understand what is happening because my
[52:26] brother and sister in South Africa and I
[52:29] pray the dear sister uh yeah I don't
[52:32] mean any harm as I bring this but a dear
[52:35] sister was sharing with me how her
[52:37] husband backslid and he he he is not
[52:41] serving the Lord but she said the thing
[52:44] that is very confounding about it is
[52:47] that he can take any subject in the
[52:50] message and explain it with
[52:55] clarity. She said any
[53:01] subject but there's no life. Yeah,
[53:04] that's right.
[53:06] So the life doesn't come by being able
[53:09] to recite it. That's right. The life
[53:11] comes from relationship. That's right.
[53:15] And without that relationship being
[53:17] impregnated by the word, it cannot bring
[53:20] forth life. Amen. So something beyond
[53:23] man's knowledge, man's intellect has to
[53:27] be the relationship that brings forth
[53:30] life. Amen. So the spirit of wisdom
[53:34] comes into the church to make known to
[53:36] the church by the revelation of the Holy
[53:39] Ghost bringing the church in and
[53:41] revealing what day that we're living in.
[53:44] So my brother and sister, what day we're
[53:46] living in, I'm going to take this a
[53:48] little different twist tonight. The day
[53:50] that we're living in is not to look over
[53:52] here and say, "Oh, look, Russia's
[53:55] prepared to do this. Oh look,
[53:57] financially America is here. Oh, the
[54:00] whole world is broke. Oh, the pope just
[54:03] died. Oh, this. No, my brother and
[54:05] sister. None of that thing is actually
[54:07] relevant to the bride of Christ. What
[54:09] we're looking at is what is happening
[54:12] and revealing the day that we're living
[54:14] in. And that is Christ is in you and I.
[54:18] And the word has been opened and we are
[54:20] slowly moving into a position where the
[54:24] partial partial realization is moving us
[54:28] into a full realization. Now in a full
[54:32] realization, I'll just kind of jump this
[54:34] ahead for a second. The rapture is in
[54:37] full realization. It is not in partial
[54:40] realization. The rapture takes place
[54:43] when the bride is mature. And so we must
[54:46] come into that realization to come to
[54:49] that place. So bringing the church in
[54:52] and revealing what day that we're living
[54:54] in. Just the same as Gabriel came to
[54:57] Daniel, the Holy Spirit comes to the
[54:59] church in the last days to reveal these
[55:02] great deep secret things. Do you
[55:05] understand? Now this is in 70th week of
[55:08] Daniel. Uh uh in this it's paragraph
[55:12] 6768. And it's good to go read behind
[55:15] that, read further. Amen. We're not
[55:18] trying to isolate the quote, but
[55:20] certainly we don't have time to quote
[55:21] the whole sermon. But you look at this,
[55:23] my brother and sister. You see, this
[55:25] understanding is not to be confused with
[55:28] how we can explain the message. Amen.
[55:31] It's not to be confused how much
[55:32] scripture we can quote, but it is to
[55:36] be rooted in the fact that God is coming
[55:40] looking for a bride. Now, my brother and
[55:44] sister, he didn't come looking for a
[55:46] bride that could quote the most. He
[55:47] didn't come looking for a bride that
[55:50] could bring, you know, the the message
[55:52] quotes or the scriptural quotes or can
[55:55] retain the most about Luther or or any
[55:58] of those others. My brother and sister,
[56:00] he was actually looking for a bride that
[56:03] was willing before even that she would
[56:06] commit herself and she would say, "You
[56:08] know what? So, you're coming back for
[56:10] me?" Amen. Look at the story of the meat
[56:13] packer and the the little orphan girl.
[56:16] You know, it's not just a little story
[56:18] out of history, but it's a very deep
[56:20] story because here's a young lady, the
[56:22] bride, that has said, "You know what?
[56:25] I'll take your word for it." Did he give
[56:28] her anything of value, uh, tangible? Did
[56:31] he give her some written record that had
[56:34] been certified? He did not. He gave his
[56:37] word. Amen. And she took that word and
[56:40] said, "That word is sufficient for me.
[56:43] She was mocked. She was derided. She was
[56:46] scoffed at. But she didn't care because
[56:49] it was his word." And when she took his
[56:53] word, she took it not into her brain.
[56:55] She took it into her heart. Amen. And
[56:58] then she labored for him. Not a works
[57:01] gospel. She was doing this from her
[57:04] heart because she had fallen in love
[57:06] with him. Amen. And that's one of the
[57:09] keys I think sometimes that is missing
[57:12] is the love affair has gone out and we
[57:14] are now coming to quotes and we're
[57:17] coming to these things and we're laying
[57:19] out facts and and all of that is well
[57:21] and good. I'm not opposed to that. But
[57:24] somewhere in the midst of that, there
[57:26] has to be an overwhelming love that is
[57:29] drawing us, my brother and sister, as it
[57:32] is. I said it a minute ago. I'll say it
[57:34] again. God's not coming for those who
[57:36] can quote the most of this message. He's
[57:38] coming for those who are living this
[57:41] message. Amen. And I say, Lord, help us.
[57:45] Amen. You see, it's not just a matter of
[57:47] coming down because it says at his
[57:49] coming would be as it was in Sodom. And
[57:52] so, we're not just coming down here to
[57:55] go stick our nose out here and see what
[57:57] condition the world's in. Because
[57:59] certainly in our mind, we would say this
[58:02] has to be Sodom.
[58:04] But my brother and sister, God's not
[58:06] looking at us to judge our position by
[58:10] their position. He's called us. Amen.
[58:13] That it's not just a doctrine, but it's
[58:16] more like a couple in
[58:20] courtship. Now, we've had a couple here
[58:23] in the church, young couple in the
[58:25] church here, got married recently.
[58:28] Courtship would be so fresh to them.
[58:31] Now, by God's grace, Sister Jerry and I
[58:34] have
[58:36] survived
[58:38] survived 42 years
[58:41] today.
[58:42] 42
[58:44] long years.
[58:49] She's still the girl. Amen.
[58:52] That I determined in my heart years
[58:55] ago I wanted to be my wife. That's
[58:58] right.
[59:00] You know, it's that
[59:02] courtship that's
[59:04] enduring. It's a love that is
[59:07] enduring. And uh Sister Jared be
[59:10] embarrassed, but actually have a picture
[59:13] that she shared with me that is is my
[59:17] heart's memory of those
[59:20] days.
[59:22] Um her as a young girl and she's
[59:26] beautiful.
[59:30] Do we still have that kind of love
[59:31] affair? Yeah.
[59:34] Are we still sitting here today and
[59:36] saying, "When I first met my Lord,
[59:39] he was so beautiful to me." So precious
[59:43] to me, so real. And I thought in my
[59:46] heart, I want to be his bride. Amen.
[59:50] Amen. It should be so real. That's what
[59:52] the Lord's looking for is a bride that's
[59:55] in love with him. not just following
[59:58] commandments and and uh reading trying
[1:00:00] to read between the lines of of oh this
[1:00:03] will make him happy. My brother and
[1:00:05] sister when real love is there there's
[1:00:07] an organic uh something about it that
[1:00:10] love just happens and that's what he
[1:00:12] wants his word to be to you and I is
[1:00:15] something that our love for him just
[1:00:18] happens because it is what we are. It's
[1:00:20] who we are. Amen. And so the beautiful
[1:00:24] picture of courtship. Amen. You know, in
[1:00:29] the natural and spiritual, each new day
[1:00:32] reveals
[1:00:34] uh uh what one is coming to love about
[1:00:38] the one he's fallen in love with. And
[1:00:41] here we are moving down in this
[1:00:43] relationship.
[1:00:45] Now, I'm not opposed to using the terms
[1:00:47] that, you know, I've been a Christian
[1:00:49] for x amount of
[1:00:51] years, but what really matters is, have
[1:00:54] we been in love? That's right. All those
[1:00:57] years.
[1:00:59] And and there's nothing to be ashamed
[1:01:01] of. Might have been going to church and
[1:01:04] living a godly life for 50 years, but
[1:01:07] maybe 40 of those years we actually
[1:01:10] weren't in a love affair. But what
[1:01:13] matters is if we're in the love affair
[1:01:15] now. Amen. So we don't have to be
[1:01:17] ashamed to say, "I wasn't always on fire
[1:01:20] for the Lord, but I'm on fire now, and
[1:01:23] that's what matters." Amen. Not to talk
[1:01:26] about being on fire 25 years ago. Amen.
[1:01:30] It reminds me just dealing with someone
[1:01:32] a little marriage issue here very
[1:01:34] recently. And and you know, as they
[1:01:36] share this, they're they're speaking
[1:01:38] about how there was a time that they
[1:01:40] were really in love, but something has
[1:01:42] happened to that. And and that's what
[1:01:44] Satan's trying to do in this day is come
[1:01:47] into the midst of our love affair. And
[1:01:50] he is trying his very best just to make
[1:01:53] it an
[1:01:56] affair. Is that the right words to use?
[1:01:59] Not a love affair,
[1:02:02] just an affair. Not an affair like
[1:02:05] unfaithful, but just in that
[1:02:07] relationship. Amen. I trust that you
[1:02:10] understand. You see, where we're at
[1:02:13] today is this partial that we experience
[1:02:16] in the flesh. What we can realize in the
[1:02:19] flesh is slowly moving. Sometimes moving
[1:02:22] so slowly that we fail to grasp that it
[1:02:26] is moving. We would say it seems like we
[1:02:29] have stalled out right here. that God is
[1:02:31] still moving and things are happening
[1:02:35] and prayers are being answered and God
[1:02:38] is still stirring hearts and when we
[1:02:41] hear I don't mean to to to tell on the
[1:02:45] wife or embarrass her but I just believe
[1:02:47] it's a beautiful example that we were
[1:02:50] sharing actually sister Jerry says here
[1:02:52] look at this in the message and she's
[1:02:54] sharing something with me and we're
[1:02:57] sitting there at our kitchen table and
[1:03:00] it brought both of us to tears. And I
[1:03:02] tell you, as I looked back on that
[1:03:04] through the day, I thought, "Thank you,
[1:03:05] Lord, that the word of God, the message
[1:03:08] of the hour, still has the ability to
[1:03:11] move us in such a fashion that we
[1:03:14] haven't become coarse and hardened to
[1:03:17] this that it's just words, but let it be
[1:03:20] something that still stirs our heart and
[1:03:22] moves us." Because you see, even though
[1:03:25] it seems as though we're not moving
[1:03:27] forward at a great pace, the partial,
[1:03:30] the prophet of God said it, I believe
[1:03:32] it, the partial is becoming a full
[1:03:36] realization.
[1:03:37] Amen. And that I thank the Lord for.
[1:03:41] Amen. So the gospel, the good news is
[1:03:44] something that we must fall in love with
[1:03:47] and remain in love with. Amen. to be a
[1:03:52] people in love with the word. You know,
[1:03:54] that's what separates it, my brother and
[1:03:56] sister. You see this where where people
[1:03:58] in and around the message in and around
[1:04:01] church and not even in the message, just
[1:04:03] out in the denominational world, a lot
[1:04:05] of sincere people, but there's a lot of
[1:04:07] people just go to church. Amen. The Lord
[1:04:10] didn't want us to just go to church. He
[1:04:12] wants us to come here to realize if I
[1:04:15] could use these words, the interface.
[1:04:18] Now the interface can take place
[1:04:21] anywhere but he chose to make the
[1:04:25] interface right here in the house of
[1:04:28] God. Amen. It's not just coming to
[1:04:31] church. It's our time to come. God's
[1:04:34] provided place of worship to come and
[1:04:37] meet him face to face. And he promised
[1:04:40] unless I can't count there's more than
[1:04:42] three of us here tonight. Amen. And so
[1:04:45] we know that he is here tonight. Can we
[1:04:48] say amen to that? We should be able
[1:04:51] tonight of the deepest need, the deepest
[1:04:54] desire or the highest heights of our
[1:04:56] worship to express it tonight because he
[1:04:59] is here. Amen. Not waiting for another
[1:05:03] meeting. Our our brother Andrew, I'll
[1:05:05] just throw this in. I forgot to mention
[1:05:07] it. Brother Andrew is going to be coming
[1:05:09] out here for a wedding. And uh we were
[1:05:12] we were talking, brother Andrew Glover.
[1:05:14] and we were talking and and uh you know
[1:05:17] he I asked him would you be able to
[1:05:19] minister for us and uh Lord willing he
[1:05:22] has accepted but it's Lord willing that
[1:05:24] everything would work now my brother and
[1:05:26] sister we shouldn't have to sit here
[1:05:29] tonight and say you know what I'll be
[1:05:31] able to deal with a little issue I'll be
[1:05:33] able to find a little victory when a
[1:05:35] minister like brother Andrew comes and
[1:05:37] gets us excited no we should be able to
[1:05:40] be excited tonight on the simple promise
[1:05:42] that God said we're two or three are
[1:05:44] gathered in my name, I'll be there. That
[1:05:47] should be enough to bring an excitement
[1:05:49] and anticipation and boldness into our
[1:05:52] lives.
[1:05:54] Amen. So, we look here in Proverbs 22
[1:05:59] 1-6. We look at this. A good name is
[1:06:02] rather to be chosen than great riches
[1:06:04] and loving favor rather than silver and
[1:06:07] gold. The rich and poor meet together.
[1:06:11] The Lord is the maker of them all. A
[1:06:14] prudent man foreseeth the evil and
[1:06:17] hideth himself, but the simple pass on
[1:06:20] and are punished. By humility and the
[1:06:23] fear of the Lord are riches and honor
[1:06:27] and life. Thorns and snares are in the
[1:06:30] way of the frowward, but he doth keep
[1:06:33] his soul shall be far from them. train
[1:06:36] up a
[1:06:37] child in the way he should go and when
[1:06:40] he is old he will not depart from it.
[1:06:44] Now I want you to just kind of go this
[1:06:46] way because you see our Lord Jesus said
[1:06:48] not to keep the children from him. Amen.
[1:06:51] That we should worship like children. So
[1:06:54] I'm moving all of us back if you don't
[1:06:57] mind. There are some children here
[1:06:59] tonight. They don't have to move
[1:07:01] anywhere. But moving us back to a
[1:07:03] position that we'd actually look at the
[1:07:06] promises of God, look at the word of
[1:07:08] God, look at our relationship with the
[1:07:11] Lord as a child would. Now, I shared
[1:07:15] with the church of that sweet young lady
[1:07:17] that wanted to know, "How do I get
[1:07:19] closer to the Lord?" Brother Paul. Well,
[1:07:22] my brother and sister, we don't get a
[1:07:24] child closer to the Lord by pulling out
[1:07:27] a book of rules, the dos and the don'ts
[1:07:29] and all of the things of the message
[1:07:32] that you're expected. That's not how
[1:07:33] you're going to train that child. But
[1:07:35] when you look back through the word of
[1:07:37] God to train up a child, my brother and
[1:07:40] sister, it isn't saying train them by
[1:07:42] fear because you'll get the results of
[1:07:44] what fear brings. Amen. You don't train
[1:07:47] them by obligation because all you will
[1:07:50] get is the results that
[1:07:53] obligation gives you. Yeah. Oh, we can
[1:07:56] train by these things, but you wonder
[1:07:59] why it malfunctions later in their life
[1:08:01] because it never was real. It was an
[1:08:03] obligation. Amen. Train by the rules. We
[1:08:07] can put a whole list of rules out. Now,
[1:08:09] the scriptures, God gave a whole book
[1:08:12] full, as it were, of rules. Then he
[1:08:15] turned around and said, "I'm going to
[1:08:16] write it on the fleshly table of your
[1:08:19] heart. It's not going to be graven in
[1:08:22] stone. It's not going to be inscripted
[1:08:24] in a book somewhere that you have to go
[1:08:27] to the certain page, the certain
[1:08:29] paragraph and follow that." No, that's
[1:08:32] where the Holy Spirit comes and starts
[1:08:34] to move that. But let me move forward
[1:08:36] here. If we train by rules, my brother
[1:08:39] and sister, rules without respect equal
[1:08:42] rebellion. And so when we give our young
[1:08:45] people, wait, we're all kids here
[1:08:47] tonight. When we give ourselves nothing
[1:08:50] but rules to follow to serve God and the
[1:08:54] opice of the message of the hour, it's
[1:08:56] do this and do this and do this. My
[1:08:59] brother and sister, sooner or later we
[1:09:01] become callous to that. But when you
[1:09:04] search out this scripture and take
[1:09:06] certain avenues that that the language
[1:09:09] gives us, Amen. It's telling you, "Train
[1:09:12] up these children to love the Lord." Oh,
[1:09:16] my brother and sister, when you're in
[1:09:18] love, Amen. There's a lot that you will
[1:09:21] do simply because you're in love. Amen.
[1:09:25] And here we are tonight. Amen. Serving
[1:09:29] God. And it says that they will not,
[1:09:32] Amen. will not depart from that. They
[1:09:35] have that love of God in their heart.
[1:09:38] And even if things aren't going well, if
[1:09:42] things have went a little sideways, if
[1:09:44] things have have been such my brother
[1:09:47] and sister, it's in the last while here,
[1:09:50] just a lot of interaction, uh people
[1:09:53] struggling over things and certain
[1:09:55] things in their life. And these are all
[1:09:57] in far away places. But my brother and
[1:09:59] sister, one thing that stirs my heart is
[1:10:02] to have a young man telling me, "This is
[1:10:04] what's happening in my life and I'm
[1:10:07] struggling and and I failed the Lord
[1:10:09] here and I failed the Lord there." But
[1:10:11] brother Paul, please understand, I still
[1:10:14] believe and I still love the Lord. I'm
[1:10:16] just fighting a battle like I've never
[1:10:18] fought before. And all I could give him
[1:10:20] wisdom was, "Brother, keep fighting."
[1:10:23] Amen. Just keep fighting, brother, cuz
[1:10:25] God promised you the victory. And you
[1:10:28] see then what it is. A love for the
[1:10:30] word. A love for our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:33] is the only thing that's holding him.
[1:10:36] It's not rules. It's not obligation.
[1:10:39] He's broken all of those. But something
[1:10:42] in his heart won't let go. Amen. Oh my
[1:10:47] brother and sister, how precious that
[1:10:48] is.
[1:10:50] Amen. That the Lord is training. We're
[1:10:54] seeing a
[1:10:55] partial moving, my brother and sister,
[1:10:59] into a full
[1:11:00] realization as our love for the Lord
[1:11:02] Jesus Christ, for the word is growing
[1:11:05] every single day. Amen. And if it's not,
[1:11:08] we should stop, push pause, kick
[1:11:11] everything out of the way. It happens in
[1:11:14] natural marriage, right? Amen. It'll
[1:11:16] happen in your spiritual walk. Time to
[1:11:19] stop, push, reset, pause, and reset a
[1:11:22] and kick all this stuff out and get back
[1:11:24] in love again. Amen. To let the love,
[1:11:27] not obligation, but the
[1:11:29] love guide our life. Amen.
[1:11:37] Mark
[1:11:38] 12 28-31.
[1:11:43] Now, it'd be good here in Mark 12 to
[1:11:46] read before and do this because I I just
[1:11:49] pulled this out. There's a lot of lovely
[1:11:52] things there. One of the scribes came
[1:11:55] and having heard them reasoning together
[1:11:57] and perceiving that he had answered them
[1:11:59] well, asked
[1:12:01] him, "Which is the first commandment of
[1:12:03] all?" Isn't it interesting this this uh
[1:12:09] scribe perceived that he'd answered the
[1:12:13] question
[1:12:15] well he had to acknowledge that the
[1:12:19] answer was a good answer.
[1:12:24] Oh my. Thank you Lord that sometimes by
[1:12:28] God's grace we can just give a good
[1:12:31] answer
[1:12:32] and our answer is the prophet of God
[1:12:35] said if you have nothing else to say
[1:12:38] tell them how your candle got lit a good
[1:12:42] answer
[1:12:44] good
[1:12:47] answer Jesus answered him which is the
[1:12:50] first commandment of all Jesus answered
[1:12:52] him the first of all the commandments
[1:12:54] commandments is here. O Israel, the Lord
[1:12:58] our God is one Lord.
[1:13:02] My You're never going to hear a
[1:13:03] trinitarian quote that one for its
[1:13:06] foundational value, right? Well, it was
[1:13:10] one
[1:13:11] God and three pieces. No, come on. Come
[1:13:16] on. You talk about one of the greatest
[1:13:17] deceptions ever placed upon humanity.
[1:13:22] They're going to be stunned, my brother
[1:13:23] and sister. We don't want to see them
[1:13:24] lost. There's that's not the right
[1:13:26] attitude, not the right approach. But my
[1:13:29] they're going to be stunned when they
[1:13:31] found out that all these prayers through
[1:13:33] the years they were praying to
[1:13:36] to nothing. Yeah.
[1:13:45] Recently, I was turned on to a little
[1:13:47] video clip and the man is standing in a
[1:13:50] courtyard or uh plaza type environment
[1:13:54] and and he's challenging people uh on
[1:13:58] baptism, what they believe and whatnot.
[1:14:01] And you know, I thought it was
[1:14:03] interesting and sad because on the one
[1:14:06] part,
[1:14:07] uh, all these adults, do you regular
[1:14:10] attend church twice a
[1:14:12] week? Well, what about this? And he
[1:14:15] starts in on on the Trinity, and it's
[1:14:18] stunning how few
[1:14:20] people can give a credible scriptural
[1:14:24] answer, right?
[1:14:26] And I thought, Lord, help us. Amen.
[1:14:29] Maybe we need to here at the church just
[1:14:31] go back a little bit and relay some
[1:14:34] foundational things about this and and
[1:14:36] get them on the screen and and whatnot.
[1:14:39] Maybe a handout. I don't know. Brother
[1:14:41] David, maybe you can help me do that.
[1:14:43] and we just let's go back and and give a
[1:14:45] fin find found foundational answer that
[1:14:49] that if you was in the plaza and you
[1:14:51] were uh uh approached and and you were
[1:14:54] asked to defend Acts 2:38 that we
[1:14:57] wouldn't be just stuttering around but
[1:14:59] we'd be able to do it. And I thought it
[1:15:01] was interesting just a simple fact here
[1:15:03] I deviate for just a moment. Not one of
[1:15:06] the respondents even brought up Acts 19.
[1:15:10] the one solid evidence in the Bible of
[1:15:15] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ. Not
[1:15:19] one of them mentioned it. But one man
[1:15:21] did come to the point further in his
[1:15:23] conversation to ask him, "Where is
[1:15:25] baptism in the trinity in the Bible?"
[1:15:28] And the man answering just smooth as
[1:15:31] butter.
[1:15:33] It's a revelation.
[1:15:36] We have no foundation to build it on.
[1:15:40] It's a revelation. If God speaks to you,
[1:15:43] you'll
[1:15:44] understand. No, my brother and sister.
[1:15:47] God said, "I'm hiding it from wise and
[1:15:49] prudent people, and I'm revealing it to
[1:15:52] the babes." And sometimes babes don't
[1:15:54] want to be told about the baby bottle,
[1:15:56] how it was designed, the scientific deal
[1:15:59] of it, blah blah blah. They want a
[1:16:01] bottle. They want it in their hand. They
[1:16:03] want to use that bottle. They don't want
[1:16:06] a theory.
[1:16:08] But you see it's kind of sad because
[1:16:10] this is what it comes down to. There is
[1:16:13] very smooth, very researched, very uh
[1:16:16] lay it out. So, and people becoming
[1:16:19] baffled. Well, they won't defend their
[1:16:23] faith. They're not sure about their
[1:16:25] faith. Might even start to question
[1:16:28] their faith because, pardon me for
[1:16:31] putting it strong, they're ignorant
[1:16:33] about their faith. Or maybe kind. Let's
[1:16:36] be kind. Should we be kind? They're
[1:16:37] naive about their faith. Lord, help us.
[1:16:42] Amen. We should be in a better position
[1:16:44] than that. First of all, the
[1:16:46] commandments is here. O Israel, the Lord
[1:16:48] our God is one Lord. And thou shalt love
[1:16:51] the Lord thy God with all thy heart and
[1:16:54] with all thy soul and with all thy mind
[1:16:57] and with all thy strength. This is the
[1:17:00] first commandment. The second is like,
[1:17:03] namely this. Thou shalt love thy
[1:17:05] neighbor as thyself. There is none other
[1:17:08] commandment greater than these. Now, you
[1:17:11] might wonder where I'm going here, but I
[1:17:13] want to tie this back to train up a
[1:17:15] child. My brother and sister, if we'll
[1:17:18] come, we can completely fulfill Mark 12
[1:17:22] in the lives of our children and young
[1:17:24] people if we will train them up to fall
[1:17:28] in love with our Lord Jesus Christ. And
[1:17:30] that means that we've got to show them
[1:17:32] that we're in love. Yes. If we can't
[1:17:35] just talk about being in love, oh, you
[1:17:37] know what? Yes. Yes, we we love the
[1:17:40] Lord. But no love inside, no love
[1:17:42] expressed, no love on display. My
[1:17:45] brother and sister, if we train up a
[1:17:46] child in a true uh essence of Mark 12,
[1:17:50] they are going to have struggles. There
[1:17:53] there's no there's nothing going to say
[1:17:55] they won't go through fiery trials. But
[1:17:58] when they are in love, it's easy to come
[1:18:00] back into that position and say, "I
[1:18:03] remember that God loves me." Just like a
[1:18:07] a a young lady, I don't know if I shared
[1:18:08] it or not, a lovely young lady wanted to
[1:18:12] come. She come back into the minister's
[1:18:14] office uh during Easter weekend. A and
[1:18:17] uh I I loved how brother Tim Dodd uh he
[1:18:20] took first step into this. She said,
[1:18:22] "Uh, I I struggle my my mom and dad
[1:18:26] there some things in their life." And
[1:18:28] the mom had already just in bitter tears
[1:18:31] admitted she hadn't always expressed
[1:18:33] herself so well to her daughter that she
[1:18:35] loved her. And and the the little girl,
[1:18:38] you know, uh not that little, 15, 16
[1:18:40] years old is saying, "I I don't think my
[1:18:42] mom loves me. I don't think my dad loves
[1:18:45] me. And I don't think the Lord loves
[1:18:47] me."
[1:18:49] Now, you look at that. That's a recipe
[1:18:51] for a young lady going to find love
[1:18:53] somewhere else. Satan's setting up a
[1:18:55] pattern where she's going to start
[1:18:58] searching for love somewhere because
[1:19:00] we're human. And love is a component
[1:19:03] that we need. It is it is an essence of
[1:19:06] which we must have as humanity. And if
[1:19:09] we don't have that, we become in
[1:19:11] essence, it's a hard word, but we become
[1:19:13] a little bit mentally, spiritually,
[1:19:16] emotionally depraved. Yeah. And so then
[1:19:19] you'll find many a young woman, sorry to
[1:19:21] pick on you young sisters, you'll find
[1:19:23] many a young woman go out and give
[1:19:24] herself to about every young man that
[1:19:27] pays attention because she's craving
[1:19:29] love and thinking the physical touch is
[1:19:33] love.
[1:19:35] And she said, "I don't even think the
[1:19:37] Lord loves me." I loved how brother Tim
[1:19:39] brought this. He just asked the girl
[1:19:42] straight
[1:19:45] out, "Do you believe on Jesus Christ?"
[1:19:48] The little girl looked a little
[1:19:51] stunned, almost like, "You question
[1:19:54] that." She said, "Yes, I do." And
[1:19:57] Brother Tim just very polite, very
[1:20:00] loving, said, "God is love." That's
[1:20:04] right. And I'm telling you, I'm not
[1:20:06] mocking in any form or fashion. Don't
[1:20:08] misunderstand, but make the point. I was
[1:20:10] looking in that little girl's eyes and I
[1:20:13] see the light. Come on.
[1:20:16] I believe in the one who is love. That
[1:20:19] means he loves me. Amen. Oh, my brother
[1:20:22] and sister, see how deceptive Satan can
[1:20:25] be. And he's trying to cause us to stay
[1:20:29] over here in the partial understanding
[1:20:33] that it's about emotion. It's about
[1:20:35] thoughts. It's about this physical
[1:20:37] realm. It's all over here. And that's
[1:20:39] not where God called us to live. He
[1:20:41] said, "I'm going to call you out of a
[1:20:43] partial realization. And I'm going to
[1:20:45] bring you just like Israel coming out of
[1:20:47] Egypt in the promised land. I'm going to
[1:20:49] bring you from a partial realization
[1:20:51] into the full realization where you
[1:20:54] realize that the Holy Ghost, God in you,
[1:20:56] Christ in you, is the love." Amen. And I
[1:21:00] got to see that little girl's whole
[1:21:01] demeanor change and tears running down
[1:21:04] her face and my heart rejoiced. Amen. to
[1:21:08] be there and be a witness of that. Amen.
[1:21:10] By God's grace, we were able to share a
[1:21:12] couple things that were pertinent to
[1:21:14] her. A and you do that. But you see,
[1:21:16] Satan was trying to get a foothold into
[1:21:20] her life and the word, my brother and
[1:21:23] sister, come so simple and set her free.
[1:21:28] Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:21:31] Amen. Just to love the Lord my God.
[1:21:37] Amen. It's there, my brother and sister,
[1:21:40] as we look at
[1:21:42] this. Amen. With all thy heart. Yeah.
[1:21:46] Not a partial. Amen. Going back to
[1:21:49] realization here. Not a
[1:21:51] partial. Amen. With all thy soul, not
[1:21:55] partial. With all thy mind, not partial.
[1:22:00] All thy strength, not partial.
[1:22:04] This is the first commandment. In other
[1:22:06] words, you got to sell out. Amen.
[1:22:11] You got to sell out. Yeah. Let me hurry
[1:22:14] along
[1:22:15] here. And things that are to
[1:22:21] be, it's a perfect place calling you to
[1:22:24] that perfection.
[1:22:26] See, we're not here in
[1:22:28] Leodysia, Satan's Eden in this carnal
[1:22:30] realm of everything is a cover up for
[1:22:34] something else. Every time it's there,
[1:22:36] there's some kind of motive. I just read
[1:22:38] a little deal. Just give you an example.
[1:22:41] Amen. Pastor has been preaching to his
[1:22:44] church, goodsized church. He's been
[1:22:45] preaching to his church about tithes and
[1:22:48] offering. And it's going along, it's
[1:22:50] going along. It went into days, weeks,
[1:22:52] and months. And finally, he just comes
[1:22:55] out of frustration and says, "If I'm
[1:22:57] going to buy this $65 million uh jet,
[1:23:00] you guys got to give more
[1:23:02] money." You see, he wasn't talking about
[1:23:05] giving to the Lord's work, but in his
[1:23:08] mind, he
[1:23:10] justified a jet as being necessary for
[1:23:13] the Lord's work.
[1:23:16] Can I talk to you guys about
[1:23:18] something? No. Is this unreal? This is
[1:23:22] the house of God. Is that the
[1:23:24] gospel? No. Preach about tithe and
[1:23:28] offering in a godly fashion for a godly
[1:23:31] purpose. What you're actually preaching
[1:23:33] is not for the benefit of the preacher
[1:23:35] when you preach those things. Amen. God
[1:23:37] rewards the giver. Amen. God rewards one
[1:23:41] who is happy to give. And it's really
[1:23:43] about the blessing coming back on that.
[1:23:45] not making a man in office, a position
[1:23:48] wealthy, but to satisfy the word of God.
[1:23:51] And yet, see how that's been twisted.
[1:23:53] So, they camouflage that. They
[1:23:55] camouflage that. Oh, the poor man only
[1:23:58] lives in a $17 million house. And he
[1:24:02] needs another 65 million for a jet.
[1:24:05] Wait, he doesn't have anywhere to keep
[1:24:07] the jet. You need to build him a runway
[1:24:08] and a hanger. And he doesn't know how to
[1:24:11] fly the jet. So, you need to send him to
[1:24:13] jet flight school. See, it never ends.
[1:24:15] All for the gospel. Come on, my brother
[1:24:18] and sister. Need a yacht that's got a
[1:24:21] built-in pool on the back of it so you
[1:24:23] can baptize people.
[1:24:25] See the nonsense that is there because
[1:24:28] the people haven't even moved into the
[1:24:32] realm of partial realization. They're
[1:24:35] outside the parameters of that. But they
[1:24:38] recognize that God will bless even in
[1:24:42] that distorted view. Yeah, people give
[1:24:45] and God blesses them. But we're here
[1:24:48] with a message of the hour and God has
[1:24:50] brought that to us and our realization
[1:24:53] is becoming real. Amen. It's coming
[1:24:55] alive to us. Let's not settle down.
[1:24:58] Sorry to just throw this in, but I want
[1:25:00] to make this point. Let's not settle
[1:25:02] down. God sent a prophet. Amen. That was
[1:25:05] just down here at the basic level of the
[1:25:07] partial realization. And God's calling
[1:25:10] us up higher and calling us along. and
[1:25:12] he's bringing us along and I'll bring it
[1:25:15] this fashion here on the road to Emmas.
[1:25:17] Jesus didn't just stop on that road. He
[1:25:20] didn't just say, "Let's just stop right
[1:25:22] here and cut to the chase." But he
[1:25:25] walked. It wasn't just him walking. They
[1:25:28] were walking. He was calling them along
[1:25:32] that road because he knew it would come
[1:25:34] to a certain place that in the evening
[1:25:37] time they would sit down. And he knew at
[1:25:40] the breaking of the bread, the opening
[1:25:42] of the word. Amen. The seventh seal
[1:25:45] being opened, a third pole being opened,
[1:25:47] all of these things being He knew at the
[1:25:49] breaking of the bread, their eyes would
[1:25:51] be opened.
[1:25:53] And we must remember we got to walk with
[1:25:55] him before we can run for him.
[1:25:58] Amen. It takes a walk before we can run
[1:26:02] and testify of the supernatural. We have
[1:26:05] to have a walk with him. Amen.
[1:26:08] Okay, I'm lost. The Bible said, "So
[1:26:11] Jesus said, "Be therefore perfect even
[1:26:13] as your father in heaven is perfect."
[1:26:15] It's a perfect kingdom. So it must be a
[1:26:17] perfect people come because you have to
[1:26:20] stand and be married to the perfect son
[1:26:23] of God. You must be a perfect bride. Oh,
[1:26:28] how are we going to get to the position
[1:26:30] of perfect bride? a snap of the finger,
[1:26:33] someone just witnessing or prophesying
[1:26:35] over you, it won't do it, my brother and
[1:26:38] sister. But this bride is being brought
[1:26:40] from the partial realization
[1:26:44] into a full realization. Amen. And if I
[1:26:46] could use this in a natural sense, my
[1:26:48] brother and sister, brother Donnie
[1:26:50] Reagan, many years ago preached along
[1:26:52] this line and he says, you know, a
[1:26:54] brother says, "Brother Donnie, I I need
[1:26:55] to come talk to you." And and when he
[1:26:58] comes, he's got a 12-year-old girl with
[1:27:00] him. And he's like, "Okay, what's going
[1:27:02] on, brother?" Well, we want to get
[1:27:06] married. Brother Donnie says, "You don't
[1:27:08] even sit down and entertain that. You
[1:27:10] tell him, you know what? You're messed
[1:27:11] up. You need to wait for her to grow up.
[1:27:13] And when she's grown up, you won't be
[1:27:15] the right man. So, just get out of
[1:27:17] here." Amen. But you see, the bride
[1:27:20] cannot be an immature bride. Anywhere
[1:27:23] you see that in a natural sense to go
[1:27:26] back on that you you're seeing something
[1:27:28] perverted. Amen. That young lady needs
[1:27:30] to come to maturity. Amen. Before she
[1:27:34] enters into that relationship and here
[1:27:36] is Christ coming long bringing his bride
[1:27:40] into a maturity that she can literally
[1:27:43] stand one day and be the bride and
[1:27:46] accept a bridegroom and the relationship
[1:27:49] is complete. Amen. not a partial
[1:27:52] relationship. I'll take her home. She'll
[1:27:55] have my name. She'll be my wife. But no,
[1:27:59] my brother and sister, God wants a
[1:28:01] mature bride, and he's going to bring
[1:28:03] her into maturity before he truly puts
[1:28:06] her in a position of bride.
[1:28:09] Hallelujah. You must be a perfect bride.
[1:28:12] So, how can you do it through anything
[1:28:13] else but the perfect word of God, which
[1:28:17] is the waters of separation that washes
[1:28:19] us from our sins? Amen. That's right.
[1:28:22] The blood of Jesus Christ. Think of it.
[1:28:24] The dripping bloody word. Amen. The
[1:28:28] blood, the word of God. Bleeding blood
[1:28:30] to wash a bride in. Amen. Yes, sir. She
[1:28:33] stands perfect virgin, unadulterated.
[1:28:36] She never sinned. Can we say amen to
[1:28:39] that? She never sinned in the first
[1:28:42] place. Amen. She was trapped into it.
[1:28:44] See? Hallelujah. There's a position for
[1:28:47] us to stand into. And when we can come
[1:28:49] to the place we can fully accept that.
[1:28:52] Not an exemption to live any old way
[1:28:54] because we're not going to be
[1:28:55] accountable. But when you're trapped,
[1:28:57] Amen. Trapped into it. Hallelujah. See,
[1:29:02] this is what's happening, my brother and
[1:29:04] sister. I dealt with a young man in
[1:29:07] South
[1:29:08] Africa. Amen. Still caught in a little
[1:29:11] cycle of of of uh condemnation.
[1:29:16] And I thought, well, I'm going to have
[1:29:18] to really I'm going to have to really
[1:29:20] kind of lay this out to this young man.
[1:29:22] But all of a sudden, it's like a little
[1:29:24] inspiration struck him. But then he
[1:29:26] turns around and says, "But I've been
[1:29:28] delivered from that." And I was like,
[1:29:30] "You're headed in the right direction,
[1:29:32] young man." Amen. You don't have to stop
[1:29:34] here and dwell in this circle, this
[1:29:37] circle, this circle, because you have
[1:29:39] been delivered from that. Amen. And God
[1:29:42] says, "I never even held it to your
[1:29:44] account in the first place." Hallelujah.
[1:29:46] Amen. See, we're not living in or
[1:29:50] holding to man's idea of perfect. Right.
[1:29:53] Amen. Is there anyone perfect amongst
[1:29:55] us?
[1:29:56] Oh
[1:29:58] my. We won't even start going down that
[1:30:02] road because it would take about two
[1:30:06] questions for most of us to fail the
[1:30:08] perfection test.
[1:30:12] But you see, it is perfect
[1:30:14] love that's drawing us into God's
[1:30:17] perfect plan.
[1:30:19] Nothing less. Now, if God chose to
[1:30:22] express his love to you and in you,
[1:30:26] should we
[1:30:28] not stop and receive it? Amen. Wouldn't
[1:30:33] be It's not a funny video. It's shown as
[1:30:37] a funny video.
[1:30:40] of a wedding. And when the minister
[1:30:44] says, "You may kiss the bride," she
[1:30:46] refused to kiss
[1:30:50] him. Let's not be that kind of bride.
[1:30:54] When it comes time for us to show the
[1:30:56] Lord we really love
[1:30:58] him, let's not pull back. That's right.
[1:31:01] Amen. at that point to look at it in the
[1:31:04] hardline of Jewish
[1:31:07] uh matrimonial
[1:31:09] tradition going back into the old Jewish
[1:31:12] tradition once the vow is said she
[1:31:15] belongs to him now in this feminist day
[1:31:18] that we live in that just seems to be
[1:31:20] just oh so that's horrible belong that
[1:31:23] means possession no that's how God
[1:31:25] looked at it once a vow is exchanged
[1:31:29] you're not your own anymore aren't you
[1:31:31] glad we're not our own. Amen. The vow
[1:31:34] has been exchanged and and we're moving
[1:31:36] from this partial relationship. Well,
[1:31:38] I'm engaged to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:31:41] Isn't that good enough? No, my brother
[1:31:43] and sister. We got to move into the
[1:31:45] fullness of the marriage of the lamb.
[1:31:48] Amen. It's not an engagement of the
[1:31:51] lamb. It's not a courtship of the lamb.
[1:31:53] It's a marriage of the lamb. And God,
[1:31:56] help us just not to stop, not to
[1:31:58] hesitate, but just drive right in that
[1:32:00] and say, "I want to be the lamb's wife."
[1:32:03] Amen. I don't want to just have some
[1:32:05] partial relationship. I want to be the
[1:32:07] lamb's wife. Hallelujah.
[1:32:11] Amen. Because living in the
[1:32:14] partial leaves us lacking.
[1:32:17] But we're being called into the full
[1:32:19] realization. Aren't you glad tonight?
[1:32:22] Amen. Sister Vikica, will you come? Hey,
[1:32:26] man. I need to unwind myself here. Just
[1:32:29] just this last little bit of
[1:32:31] thought. So, we see Enoch, right? In
[1:32:35] Genesis 5, we see that Enoch, Amen,
[1:32:38] walked with God and was not, for God
[1:32:40] took him. And and we look at that as
[1:32:43] seeing Enoch as perfect. Now, if Enoch
[1:32:47] had just been born perfect, my brother
[1:32:49] and sister, would God not have some
[1:32:52] obligation if he made one man
[1:32:55] perfect that he would be obligated to
[1:32:58] make you and I perfect? We're talking
[1:33:00] within the kingdom of God.
[1:33:04] So, Enoch was not our idea of perfect.
[1:33:10] It was not our idea of what he did to
[1:33:13] please God.
[1:33:15] The reality of it is all that mattered
[1:33:18] was that the Lord was happy, that the
[1:33:21] Lord viewed him with pleasure. Scripture
[1:33:25] 5:24, "And Enoch walked with God, was
[1:33:27] not, for God took him." You see, my
[1:33:30] brother and sister, this is exactly what
[1:33:32] God's moving you and I to come to the
[1:33:35] place that we've been walking with the
[1:33:38] Lord. Now, it doesn't give us a real
[1:33:42] diagram of everything that Enoch went
[1:33:45] through. It doesn't show the the fiery
[1:33:48] trials, the tests as it is with
[1:33:51] Job. We don't see as it is with other
[1:33:55] men in scripture what they went through.
[1:33:58] But what it does is gives us a very
[1:33:59] clear picture. And let me just say this
[1:34:02] in simplicity as I close.
[1:34:05] The definition of
[1:34:07] walk is to move forward by placing one
[1:34:10] foot in front of another. Yeah, that's
[1:34:14] right. To stroll. Amen.
[1:34:18] Well, praise God. You know what I think
[1:34:21] I'm going to do? I think I'm going to
[1:34:24] get up off of my seat. I think I'm going
[1:34:27] to get out of the chair. I think I'm
[1:34:29] gonna quit standing here and complaining
[1:34:32] and I'm gonna start walking with the
[1:34:35] Lord. Amen. Oh, nowhere does it show
[1:34:40] that he just received that as just a
[1:34:43] gift anymore than we have received the
[1:34:47] gift from our Lord Jesus
[1:34:50] Christ. Enoch, here I
[1:34:52] come. Here I come. I'm taking what the
[1:34:55] Lord said about you. I'm gonna move
[1:34:57] forward by placing one foot in front of
[1:35:00] another.
[1:35:02] Amen. I'm gonna stroll over heaven.
[1:35:05] Amen. I want to stroll over heaven with
[1:35:07] you. If you're if you're willing, if
[1:35:09] you're welcome to that idea. Amen. To
[1:35:12] walk along and say, "Man, I don't know
[1:35:16] where we come from. What I do know is is
[1:35:18] God was faithful cuz we're here. I don't
[1:35:21] know that we'll remember all the trials
[1:35:23] and the struggle and that." He said he'd
[1:35:25] wipe every tear from our eyes. So maybe
[1:35:27] there will be some remembrance of what
[1:35:29] we went through. But what we will
[1:35:31] remember was the lamb made the way for
[1:35:34] you and I. He gave us the guidance, the
[1:35:37] direction, and the strength. Amen. Let
[1:35:40] us stroll. Amen. And walk. Amen. See,
[1:35:44] God's bringing this partial realization
[1:35:47] into a full
[1:35:49] realization.
[1:35:51] One step at a time.
[1:35:54] I'm in South Africa and I hope you
[1:35:57] understand this. I don't say it just to
[1:35:58] be funny, but I had a brother, I know
[1:36:01] this brother, had a brother come up to
[1:36:03] me and look me in the face. He said,
[1:36:05] "Did you go to
[1:36:06] Krueger?" And I said, "No, they offered
[1:36:09] to take us, but I wanted to focus on the
[1:36:12] people." And he says,
[1:36:14] "Well, we appreciate that, Brother Paul.
[1:36:17] God bless you." How do you eat an
[1:36:19] elephant?
[1:36:21] One bite at a time. One bite at a time.
[1:36:27] That's right. And that's what actually
[1:36:29] stirred
[1:36:30] me. One step at a time, we're going to
[1:36:36] have victory. One step at a time, we're
[1:36:40] going to come closer to the rapture. We
[1:36:43] don't need a miracle to get us there, my
[1:36:45] brother and sister, but one step at a
[1:36:48] time, drawing us closer to the Lord
[1:36:49] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:36:53] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:36:55] 2:30. Amen. And then I'm going to ask
[1:36:58] brother Alex, maybe brother Sergey can
[1:37:00] cover. Amen. Sing that song. There's
[1:37:03] none like you. Amen. It's got that
[1:37:06] little f/G thing, you know. I don't know
[1:37:08] what that means. It's just part of the
[1:37:10] alphabet to me. Amen.
[1:37:17] There is none like
[1:37:25] you. No one else can touch my heart like
[1:37:32] you do.
[1:37:37] I could search for all
[1:37:41] eternity,
[1:37:43] Lord, and find there is none. Let's just
[1:37:49] stand and worship the Lord for just a
[1:37:51] minute
[1:37:51] [Music]
[1:37:55] now. And there is none like you.
[1:38:07] No one else can touch my heart like you
[1:38:16] do. I could search for all
[1:38:21] eternity,
[1:38:24] Lord, and
[1:38:26] find there is none like you. One last
[1:38:32] time.
[1:38:36] Oh, there is none like
[1:38:45] you. No one else can touch my heart like
[1:38:51] you
[1:38:55] do. I could search for all
[1:39:01] eternity, Lord. Lord and
[1:39:05] find there is none
[1:39:09] like
[1:39:13] you. Amen. Let's go to the key of D.
[1:39:17] Song number 425. We'll sing the
[1:39:20] chorus. We walk in the
[1:39:26] light.
[1:39:29] Beautiful
[1:39:31] life. Come where the dew drops of
[1:39:39] mercy are
[1:39:42] bright. Shine all around us by day and
[1:39:50] by night.
[1:39:55] Jesus the light of the
[1:40:00] world. Sing that
[1:40:02] again. We'll walk in the
[1:40:08] light.
[1:40:10] Beautiful
[1:40:13] light. Come where the dew drops of
[1:40:20] mercy are bright.
[1:40:23] God shine all around us by day and by
[1:40:33] night.
[1:40:35] Jesus the light of the
[1:40:41] world. Amen. Let's go to number
[1:40:45] 557 as we get ready to dismiss.
[1:40:54] See in
[1:40:56] shady green
[1:40:59] pastures so rich and so
[1:41:04] sweet. God leads his dear
[1:41:09] children along.
[1:41:14] Where the
[1:41:16] waterers cool flow bait the
[1:41:21] weery ones
[1:41:23] feet. God leads his dear
[1:41:28] children along.
[1:41:35] Some through the
[1:41:39] waterers, some through the
[1:41:43] flood, some through the
[1:41:48] fire, but all through the
[1:41:53] blood, some through great
[1:41:58] sorrow, but God gives us
[1:42:04] Oh, in the night
[1:42:08] season and all the day
[1:42:14] long. And
[1:42:17] sometimes on the mount where the sun
[1:42:22] shines so
[1:42:25] bright, God leads his dear
[1:42:30] children along.
[1:42:33] [Music]
[1:42:36] Sometimes in the
[1:42:39] valley, in the
[1:42:42] darkest of
[1:42:44] night, God leads his dear
[1:42:49] children along.
[1:42:55] Some through the
[1:42:59] waterers, some through the
[1:43:04] flood, some through the
[1:43:09] fire, but all through the
[1:43:14] blood, some through great sorrow.
[1:43:20] But God gives us
[1:43:24] all in the night
[1:43:29] season and all the day long.
[1:43:36] When those
[1:43:39] sorrows befall us and
[1:43:45] Satanos, God leads his dear
[1:43:50] children
[1:43:55] along. Through grace we can
[1:44:00] coner,
[1:44:01] defeat all our foes.
[1:44:06] God leads his dear
[1:44:10] children along.
[1:44:16] Some through the
[1:44:20] waterers, some through the
[1:44:25] flood, some through the
[1:44:30] fire, but all through the
[1:44:35] blood, some through great sorrow.
[1:44:40] But God gives a
[1:44:45] song in the night
[1:44:49] season and all the day
[1:44:56] long. Oh,
[1:44:59] away from the
[1:45:01] mire and away from the clay.
[1:45:07] God leads his dear
[1:45:11] children
[1:45:17] along
[1:45:18] way up in glory.
[1:45:24] Eternity
[1:45:25] day God leads his dear
[1:45:31] children
[1:45:32] [Music]
[1:45:36] along. Some through the
[1:45:41] waterers, some through the
[1:45:46] flood, some through the fire.
[1:45:51] But all through the
[1:45:56] blood, some through great
[1:46:00] sorrow, but God gives a
[1:46:05] song in the night
[1:46:10] season and all the day long. Some
[1:46:15] through the waters. Some through the
[1:46:20] waterers, some through the
[1:46:25] flood, some through the
[1:46:30] fire, but all through the
[1:46:35] blood, some through great sorrow.
[1:46:41] But God gives a
[1:46:45] song in the night
[1:46:49] season and all the day
[1:46:56] long. Amen. As we dismiss number
[1:47:01] 10:42, this is the evening
[1:47:07] time. It's later than you
[1:47:14] think. The bride is
[1:47:17] preparing
[1:47:19] now for her Lord to
[1:47:26] me. And all things are
[1:47:30] ready
[1:47:31] [Music]
[1:47:33] now. The bridegroom I
[1:47:37] [Music]
[1:47:39] hear, and he that hath an ear to hear,
[1:47:45] the evening time is here. One more
[1:47:53] time. This is
[1:47:56] the evening
[1:47:59] time. It's later than you think.
[1:48:07] The bride is
[1:48:10] preparing
[1:48:11] now
[1:48:13] for Lord to
[1:48:15] [Music]
[1:48:19] me and all things are
[1:48:22] ready now.
[1:48:26] The bridegroom my
[1:48:29] [Music]
[1:48:32] ear. He that hath an ear to
[1:48:37] hear, the evening time is here. All
[1:48:42] things are ready
[1:48:44] now. Oh, all things are
[1:48:48] ready now.
[1:48:52] The bridegroom I
[1:48:57] hear, and he that hath an ear to hear,
[1:49:04] the evening time is
[1:49:09] here. Amen. You're dismissed. God bless
[1:49:12] you.
