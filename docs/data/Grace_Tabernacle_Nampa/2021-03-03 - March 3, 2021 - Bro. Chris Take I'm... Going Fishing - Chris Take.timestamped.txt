[35:09] amen luke 24 13.
[35:13] and behold two of them went that same
[35:15] day to a village called emmaus
[35:17] which was from jerusalem about three
[35:19] score furlongs
[35:21] about seven and a half miles and they
[35:24] talked together of all these things
[35:25] which had happened
[35:27] and it came to pass that while they
[35:28] commune together and
[35:30] reasoned
[35:34] jesus himself drew near and went with
[35:36] them
[35:37] but their eyes were holding that they
[35:40] should not know him
[35:41] and he said unto them what manner of
[35:43] communications are these that ye have
[35:45] one to another
[35:46] as you walk and are sad like he didn't
[35:49] already know
[35:51] and one of them whose name was cleopas
[35:53] answering said unto him
[35:55] art thou only a stranger in jerusalem
[35:58] who are you man
[36:00] and has not known the things which are
[36:01] come to pass there in these days and he
[36:04] said unto them
[36:05] what things they said unto him
[36:07] concerning jesus of nazareth which was a
[36:09] prophet
[36:10] mighty indeed and word before god and
[36:13] all the people
[36:14] and how the chief priests and our rulers
[36:16] delivered him to be condemned to death
[36:18] and have crucified him but we trusted
[36:20] that it had been he which should have
[36:22] redeemed israel
[36:24] and beside all this today is the third
[36:25] day since these things were done
[36:28] yeah and certain women also of our
[36:30] company made us astonished
[36:31] which were early at the sepulcher and
[36:34] when they found out his body they came
[36:36] saying that they had also seen a vision
[36:38] of angels which said that he was alive
[36:41] and certain of them which were with us
[36:42] went to the sepulcher and found it even
[36:44] so as the women had said
[36:46] but him they saw not then he said unto
[36:48] them o
[36:49] fools and slow of heart to believe all
[36:51] that the prophets have spoken
[36:53] ought not christ who have suffered these
[36:55] things and to enter into his glory
[36:58] and beginning at moses and all the
[37:00] prophets he expounded unto them
[37:02] in all the scriptures the things
[37:04] concerning himself
[37:07] i would love to stand on that sermon
[37:11] and they drew near drew nye unto the
[37:13] village where
[37:14] whether they went and he made as though
[37:16] he would have gone further
[37:17] but they constrained him saying abi with
[37:19] us for it is toward evening
[37:21] and the day is far spent and he went in
[37:23] to tarry with them
[37:24] and it came to pass as he sat at meat
[37:26] with them he took bread
[37:27] and blessed it and break and gave it to
[37:29] them and their eyes were open
[37:31] and they knew him and he vanished out of
[37:33] their sight
[37:36] and they said one to another did not our
[37:37] heart burn within us while he talked
[37:39] with us by the way
[37:41] and while he opened to us the scriptures
[37:43] and they rose up the same hour and
[37:45] returned to jerusalem and found the
[37:47] eleven gathered together
[37:48] and them that were with them let's bow
[37:51] our heads
[37:52] heavenly father lord jesus not as we
[37:54] come to partake of the bread of life
[37:56] lord may the man not get in the way lord
[38:01] mother move me out of the way lord i
[38:03] yield myself to you father
[38:05] each one here tonight lord yields their
[38:08] heart lord opens
[38:09] themselves up to you father desiring
[38:11] lord you to come
[38:13] father and lord work on us lord give us
[38:16] great revelation of your word
[38:18] expound to us lord like you did the two
[38:20] on the road to emmaus lord
[38:22] father may we not look to the world
[38:24] around us father and the chaos that we
[38:26] live in but father we would look to the
[38:28] truth
[38:29] the solid foundation which is christ
[38:31] lord in revelation
[38:32] of who you are or a desire to not listen
[38:35] to hear
[38:36] special words or to hear things that are
[38:39] that are new and and lord just
[38:43] great father but lord to hear your word
[38:46] father which
[38:47] is truly great what man calls great you
[38:49] call foolish
[38:51] but when man calls foolish you call
[38:53] great lord
[38:54] i pray you just minister to our hearts
[38:56] may we just
[38:58] yield into your hand tonight lord let
[39:00] you could have your way we thank you for
[39:02] your presence lord
[39:03] now we just give ourselves to you in
[39:05] jesus christ's name we pray
[39:07] amen you may be seated tonight
[39:14] amen
[39:20] you know my title tonight
[39:24] is i'm going fishing
[39:29] can you put the title up there because
[39:30] the three dots are important
[39:33] i'm going fishing uh the subtitle is
[39:37] follow me
[39:38] so we're going to get to that well first
[39:41] we're going to talk about these
[39:42] two disciples on the road to emmaus
[39:45] you see emmaus actually means
[39:48] warm baths and
[39:53] cleopas which is the one that's
[39:55] mentioned it the name
[39:57] meaning is of a renowned father and i
[40:00] think that we as children of god
[40:02] are of the renowned father
[40:06] the lord jesus christ and so
[40:10] um here we are on the road to emmaus
[40:12] okay we're the same as them tonight
[40:17] and we're going to take a walk i'm in
[40:19] history because
[40:20] these people aren't just stories in the
[40:23] book these
[40:24] were living breathing disciples of jesus
[40:26] christ no different than me and you
[40:28] and this really happened
[40:31] so here they are they they were
[40:32] disciples of christ
[40:35] children of the renowned father and
[40:38] they had been following jesus on the
[40:41] shores of galilee
[40:43] they saw the miracles they saw the great
[40:45] things done
[40:46] and then then they
[40:50] they they had the the last supper and
[40:53] they took jesus the the pharisees and
[40:56] the romans
[40:57] they took him and these two men
[41:01] witnessed the death of what they
[41:04] believed to be the messiah
[41:07] and so all of this transpires and they
[41:11] meet jesus on the road because as as it
[41:14] says
[41:14] they were talking about him and when you
[41:16] talk about the lord he likes
[41:18] he comes by because he likes to sit in
[41:20] on that conversation he loves
[41:22] to be worshipped and when you're talking
[41:24] about him you're worshiping him
[41:26] and so he he steps out of the bushes and
[41:28] he says
[41:29] hey what's going on um what are you what
[41:32] are you guys
[41:32] lamenting about what are you discouraged
[41:34] about and they
[41:36] they said you know because anybody in
[41:37] the know would know
[41:39] that jesus had been crucified it was the
[41:42] headlines of the paper
[41:43] and um there this man now approaches
[41:46] them and doesn't know what's going on or
[41:48] what's being talked about
[41:49] and there's a little bit taken back and
[41:52] and kind of
[41:53] you know you kind of get this impression
[41:55] that cleopas just starts to vent
[41:57] right he's frustrated he's discouraged
[41:59] he's venting he's saying you know
[42:00] this man that that that we follow uh i'm
[42:04] gonna
[42:04] pick the scripture up here for reference
[42:06] he says uh
[42:07] a prophet mighty indeed and word before
[42:10] god and all the people
[42:11] and the the chief priests they took him
[42:13] they condemned him and they crucified
[42:15] him
[42:16] he says but we trusted that it had been
[42:18] he which should have redeemed israel
[42:20] and beside all this today is the third
[42:22] day since these
[42:23] things were done and so there's uh
[42:25] there's this this this uh
[42:27] statement made that you know this was
[42:30] who we
[42:30] trusted to have been the redeemed to to
[42:34] to redeem israel this was the messiah
[42:37] or so we thought is what cleopas is
[42:40] saying and then he says oh
[42:41] and by the way the the women they went
[42:44] to the sepulcher and they say
[42:45] you know this that or the other
[42:48] and so they're discouraged and um
[42:51] i don't know if i picked up the quote um
[42:54] here
[42:56] i did so we'll get to it now actually no
[42:59] we're just going to go with this okay so
[43:00] brother adam says in proof of his
[43:02] resurrection he said um
[43:09] let me make sure this is the right quote
[43:16] oh yeah so he's talking about the these
[43:18] two other rotimates he says
[43:20] oh how could that man ever fail how
[43:23] could he ever let us down like this
[43:25] and now we stand in shame and disgrace
[43:27] we are going back home to start up our
[43:29] fishing and carpentering again
[43:31] so we'll finish that quote later but so
[43:34] you see the state these guys are in
[43:36] they're like they left everything right
[43:38] they they put their the
[43:40] the um their lathe down their their
[43:42] their chisels
[43:43] they put down their nets and they went
[43:45] to follow jesus the messiah
[43:47] and they saw great evidence that this
[43:50] was
[43:51] who they've been looking for they saw
[43:53] great evidence that this was the man
[43:56] that the scripture said he even had a
[43:58] virgin birth
[44:01] this is him yet something
[44:04] happened something happened he was
[44:07] crucified
[44:08] he's dead so they're saying okay he's
[44:11] dead
[44:12] what's the point now right okay so what
[44:15] happened here
[44:16] is is things didn't go how they thought
[44:18] they would go
[44:20] they had this vision in their mind now
[44:22] you see
[44:23] you had cleophas and his friend and then
[44:25] you have the pharisees the sadducees the
[44:26] pharisees and sadducees turned him down
[44:29] nothing that he did or said they said
[44:31] this man is upbeat was above because
[44:33] they had an idea in their mind of how
[44:35] things should go
[44:36] that's one side of it but then you know
[44:37] you have like you have this thought in
[44:39] your head
[44:40] you know about how thing an event is
[44:42] going to transpire you
[44:43] you're excited about it and then it
[44:45] happens and it comes and then you're
[44:47] kind of let down because
[44:48] it didn't go exactly how you thought in
[44:50] your head that's
[44:52] carnal nature and sometimes it can be a
[44:54] very important thing
[44:56] and and you thought things were a
[44:58] certain way and
[44:59] and by all reasons they were but then
[45:01] something changed
[45:03] and now it's not panning out how you
[45:05] thought it would
[45:06] it's very discouraging right and so here
[45:09] is cleopas
[45:10] and and his friend here and talk about
[45:13] coming off a high
[45:15] they were on the mountain
[45:19] elevated off the mountain they're
[45:21] walking with jesus the messiah for
[45:23] who knows how long we're gonna say three
[45:25] and a half years
[45:26] from the time he called in the beginning
[45:27] of his of his ministry jesus began to
[45:29] call the disciples perhaps they were
[45:30] part of that group
[45:32] and um they've been they've seen all
[45:34] this stuff john says
[45:36] in the book in in the gospel of john it
[45:38] says you know there's no way we could
[45:40] have
[45:41] written everything we saw jesus do there
[45:43] wouldn't be enough books
[45:45] to cover the books would fill the world
[45:47] the earth and they were a part of this
[45:49] they were there day in and day out
[45:51] seeing all of these miracles happen and
[45:54] everything testifying i want you to
[45:56] catch this now everything testifying
[45:59] that jesus was the messiah but then
[46:02] one thing changed he died
[46:07] one thing changed one thing was
[46:10] different than their carnal
[46:11] understanding
[46:12] of what the messiah would do but the
[46:15] scripture says
[46:16] they didn't remember the scripture
[46:20] they didn't remember the scripture about
[46:22] what would happen and that how he would
[46:24] die
[46:24] and raise again it's right there i don't
[46:27] remember which book it is
[46:28] i read it tonight i just didn't write it
[46:30] down it says they forgot the scripture
[46:32] that's right so yet everything panned
[46:35] out right to according to their
[46:37] revelation until
[46:38] he died then they said oh this can't be
[46:41] him
[46:43] or they just didn't know what was going
[46:45] on they were discouraged
[46:46] one thing happened that was contrary to
[46:49] their carnal understanding
[46:51] and here they are saying never mind
[46:53] we're going back to emmaus
[46:54] warm baths or laodicea i like to say
[46:58] going back to warm right it doesn't say
[47:02] lukewarm but it doesn't say cold it
[47:03] doesn't say hot baths
[47:05] or cold baths it says warm baths
[47:08] they're going back to what they thought
[47:11] what they knew was familiar
[47:13] okay so we were wrong but
[47:17] what jesus does when he steps on the
[47:20] path
[47:20] with him is he begins he preaches
[47:23] himself
[47:24] from genesis to revelations
[47:27] he preaches himself to them but what is
[47:30] he doing
[47:32] he's reminding them they already know
[47:34] what the scripture says
[47:36] but he is reminding them look you forgot
[47:38] you let one thing
[47:41] change your mind you say
[47:45] well that one thing was big it doesn't
[47:46] matter he says
[47:48] stop look at the whole picture
[47:52] step back and look at the whole picture
[47:58] they were basing their conclusion of his
[48:00] death
[48:01] on circumstantial evidence
[48:04] you say well they saw it happen
[48:08] right but that's not how god works
[48:13] god doesn't work by what you can see all
[48:14] the time so you see
[48:17] a death but that's just circumstantial
[48:19] evidence that he's defeated
[48:21] there's something about that that that
[48:24] isn't
[48:25] known or was forgotten and
[48:28] circumstantial evidence
[48:29] i just wanted to put this in here
[48:30] because i didn't even know what it was i
[48:32] just knew
[48:32] i'd heard about it circumstantial
[48:34] evidence in law evidence not drawn from
[48:37] direct observations of a fact in issue
[48:40] if a witness testifies that he saw a
[48:42] defendant fire a bullet
[48:43] into the body of a person who then died
[48:45] this is direct testimony material facts
[48:47] in murder
[48:48] and the only question is whether the
[48:49] witness is telling the truth if however
[48:51] the witness is able to testify
[48:53] only that he heard the shot and that he
[48:56] arrived on the scene seconds later to
[48:57] see the accused standing over the corpse
[48:59] with a smoking pistol in his hand the
[49:01] evidence is circumstantial
[49:02] the accused may have been shooting at
[49:04] the escaping killer
[49:06] or merely have been a bystander who
[49:08] picked up the weapon after the killer
[49:09] had dropped it so just because they saw
[49:12] him die
[49:14] they assumed all was lost they assumed
[49:17] that this
[49:18] evidence was not circumstantial that it
[49:20] was factual
[49:22] but it was just circumstantial evidence
[49:24] because
[49:25] they were basing what they saw of what
[49:28] they
[49:28] knew death means
[49:31] you don't come back
[49:35] but in god's kingdom that
[49:39] what happened there is just
[49:40] circumstantial evidence
[49:42] it is not the truth or whether or not
[49:44] that person will never
[49:46] come in i'm not talking about the
[49:48] resurrection i'm talking about now yet
[49:50] how many testimonies do you have of
[49:51] people being raised from the dead
[49:53] you say well that's impossible not in
[49:55] the kingdom of god
[49:56] death is just circumstantial evidence
[49:58] and so here we
[50:00] in in other words you can't base a
[50:02] verdict off of what you saw
[50:04] that's what that is right circumstantial
[50:06] evidence you can't say that person's
[50:08] not going to come back because you saw
[50:10] them die they saw jesus die
[50:13] that didn't mean anything but it was
[50:16] different to what they thought
[50:18] it would be i hope you're catching this
[50:21] thing
[50:23] so if they would have stood back and
[50:25] eventually they did stood back to look
[50:27] at the whole picture
[50:28] say okay he died yes
[50:31] let's set that on the table but what
[50:33] about everything else he did
[50:36] that proved him to be who he said he was
[50:40] what about every see what happens is is
[50:43] as
[50:43] we get something happens and that's all
[50:45] we see
[50:51] we hear one thing about someone and then
[50:53] that we are to think about that
[50:55] and when we see that person so yeah
[50:58] i think that's the way they this other
[51:00] person said they were yeah
[51:02] but see that's circumstantial evidence i
[51:05] had some this
[51:06] at work somebody told me some stuff that
[51:08] was pretty
[51:09] uh not good about a person
[51:13] you know and it bothered me at first i
[51:16] was like whoa am i missing something so
[51:18] i
[51:18] studied the this other person when i'm
[51:21] interactions with them i would watch
[51:23] them
[51:23] you can tell a lot about a person with
[51:24] how they interact and and i i just kept
[51:27] telling my wife i'm not picking up on
[51:28] any of what they said
[51:30] then sort of think about who they were
[51:32] and who they were talking to
[51:34] i was like oh i realized what they were
[51:36] saying was coming from someone else
[51:38] who has a jealousy problem so what they
[51:41] saw was not
[51:42] actually what they saw it's what they
[51:45] wanted to see
[51:48] so if i stood back
[51:51] and by god's grace i didn't i looked at
[51:52] the whole picture my interactions with
[51:54] him from the very beginning
[51:56] to the very end and to present none of
[51:59] that lines up
[52:00] if you take the message this is the big
[52:02] thing right now right it's a message
[52:03] look at the whole thing
[52:05] did he say it he said it that it wasn't
[52:08] this
[52:09] who cares look at everything
[52:12] that was preached it's not is it not
[52:15] truth
[52:16] find it in the scripture where it was
[52:18] not truth order wasn't corrected later
[52:20] on
[52:21] praise the lord so what happened was
[52:23] cleopas and his friend they
[52:25] they they got so discouraged and this is
[52:28] what happens to us sometimes
[52:29] they got so discouraged their eyes kind
[52:31] of filmed over they forgot everything
[52:33] else
[52:34] all right sometimes you get in the heat
[52:35] of a moment you get that fight-or-flight
[52:37] mentality and your brain something kicks
[52:39] in you just
[52:39] you can't even talk you forget how to
[52:41] talk that happened to me one time there
[52:42] was a loud crash in the basement and i
[52:44] thought someone busted through my front
[52:45] window
[52:46] and i couldn't even speak oh my god
[52:48] that's all i came out of my mouth
[52:52] and so fear or things they do that to
[52:54] you
[52:55] and and you just freeze up you know if i
[52:58] asked uh you know sean come up here and
[53:01] and
[53:02] speak for 30 minutes you know he may or
[53:04] may not just
[53:06] uh um right depends on the person but
[53:10] you freeze up sometimes so they they got
[53:13] super discouraged and we get discouraged
[53:15] on sometimes and we oh you know we get
[53:17] to look at our circumstances
[53:19] and we we think oh you know nothing's
[53:22] right nothing's good
[53:24] i'm gonna tell my little girl something
[53:26] bad will happen and she'll just say oh
[53:28] this whole day is terrible
[53:30] right we do that sometimes too we all
[53:32] this you know we
[53:33] we sp we're driving to work we're tired
[53:35] we spill our coffee all over our lap now
[53:37] we stink like coffee because coffee when
[53:40] it's spilled on you
[53:40] stinks it smells good in the cup but it
[53:43] doesn't mix well with cotton i guess i
[53:45] don't know
[53:46] and now it's the day's ruined right
[53:50] but sometimes and sometimes the
[53:53] circumstances can be even more
[53:54] overwhelming
[53:56] but god's grace comes along
[53:59] and walks with you on the road to erase
[54:01] he didn't he didn't say hold on guys
[54:05] stop you're going the wrong way
[54:08] you need to go that way
[54:13] he just said hey how's it going and he
[54:16] walked with him
[54:17] what are you guys talking about oh okay
[54:20] okay okay he heard them out he listened
[54:22] then he says you fools
[54:26] apparently they were so discouraged they
[54:28] didn't even care
[54:30] because let's be honest if someone said
[54:32] that you'd be like huh
[54:34] you say what right they're just kind of
[54:37] like
[54:38] whatever i guess we are right
[54:41] talk about discouraged
[54:45] and so he begins to tell them and remind
[54:48] them okay so
[54:50] you can't yes look at the whole picture
[54:52] you can't go and go back through
[54:54] everything
[54:55] he said everything the word said then
[54:56] draw your conclusion not from circle
[54:59] circumstantial evidence but from the
[55:01] word
[55:03] never ever base your eternal security on
[55:06] circumstantial evidence
[55:10] they said she said he saw
[55:15] they said she said he saw he said they
[55:18] said she saw
[55:21] the dr seuss book he well
[55:25] well this guy said brother branham said
[55:28] this so
[55:31] i have the privilege privilege i don't
[55:33] know if i can call it that
[55:35] of knowing somebody who is part of the
[55:38] i don't know the believe the sign thing
[55:42] and and they say stuff every once in a
[55:44] while
[55:45] and god's given me the grace and putting
[55:47] the words in my mouth but they say stuff
[55:49] that's not even
[55:50] anywhere in the message
[55:54] because somebody they know said that
[55:57] which is hilarious because you think
[55:58] about it that's totally hypocritical
[56:00] because that's what they're blaming us
[56:02] for doing anyways
[56:04] because they're basing their assumption
[56:07] off of circumstantial evidence because
[56:09] it's what they want to believe
[56:15] okay they simply have circumstantial
[56:17] evidence
[56:18] and they are misinformed but here's the
[56:21] deal with the word of god
[56:23] the catch-22 if you're looking for
[56:26] christ
[56:26] you'll find him in every line every word
[56:30] every scripture if you're looking for
[56:33] him
[56:35] if you're looking for mistakes and
[56:36] contradictions you'll find those
[56:39] instead every line every scripture every
[56:42] verse
[56:42] you'll find a contradiction because the
[56:45] word of god
[56:46] is not just any old book that's right
[56:49] it's alive it's the word of god it's the
[56:53] bread of life
[56:55] and it was written in such a way
[56:59] to have that effect because god doesn't
[57:02] want everybody
[57:04] he only wants who he called so we've got
[57:06] to thank him for his grace for calling
[57:08] us
[57:09] but but everybody gets a chance
[57:12] everybody gets a chance everything about
[57:14] the christian life revolves around your
[57:16] heart
[57:17] and soul amen it's revelation
[57:21] it's faith you have to believe it you
[57:23] can't answer every question
[57:25] i'm sorry you can't if you could the
[57:28] lord wouldn't be revealing himself to us
[57:30] for eternity and that's scripture
[57:35] praise the lord so the cleopas and his
[57:37] friend got discouraged they started
[57:39] looking at circumstantial evidence and
[57:40] they started they based their assumption
[57:42] of the messiah
[57:43] on what they saw happen that hope
[57:46] he died everything else has to be false
[57:51] i can't find the newspaper clipping it
[57:53] all has to be false
[57:56] if amen the two on the road
[57:59] were looking to their circumstances but
[58:01] god's grace jesus came by
[58:03] he said and he he came by why because
[58:07] they belong to the kingdom
[58:08] well i think these people are out here
[58:11] you never know who's going to be who
[58:12] okay but these people out here will just
[58:15] mask them together because it's a spirit
[58:17] the tears and the wheat being bound up
[58:19] together but
[58:23] where am i going with that but why why
[58:25] did why are they allowed to just
[58:28] go to emmaus without ever encountering
[58:29] jesus
[58:32] the reason cleopas and his friend
[58:33] encountered jesus because they
[58:36] were children of the kingdom at some
[58:39] point in time
[58:40] you may or may have encountered a spirit
[58:42] of doubt
[58:43] is this true i remember one time i was
[58:45] out in the village civic alaska
[58:47] right on the bering sea and i was
[58:49] getting ready to preach
[58:51] i'm in the office right i'm praying
[58:53] you're in the office back there
[58:54] you know get ready to preach your
[58:56] adrenaline i just i have to move my legs
[58:58] i'm just
[58:59] you know getting worked up and nervous
[59:02] and that's just
[59:03] you're just kind of not not to uh
[59:06] be sacrilegious but you're kind of
[59:07] getting in the zone right it's like
[59:09] you're fixing to go out and box you know
[59:11] your shoulders are getting robbed you're
[59:12] getting warmed up you're you're praying
[59:14] you're you're laying in the unknown the
[59:16] anointing and and making sure and
[59:18] everything and
[59:19] and all of a sudden boom
[59:22] this message is false brother branham's
[59:25] a liar
[59:26] that's what i was going through this the
[59:28] the anointing went away
[59:30] and i was just standing there like i'm
[59:31] ready to go to preach and i don't even
[59:33] believe the message
[59:34] that's the thoughts going through my
[59:35] head right and i
[59:37] i i was like man this is incredible
[59:42] i i was like what what's going on right
[59:45] because
[59:46] by the grace of god he'll never give you
[59:47] anything you can't handle so even though
[59:49] these thoughts are going through my head
[59:50] these strong
[59:51] thoughts of doubt still that voice in my
[59:54] heart was like
[59:55] you're just wrestling with the spirit
[59:57] and so i begin to talk out loud you
[1:00:00] might try this sometime
[1:00:01] and i said okay devil so it's a lie
[1:00:04] what about when god did this
[1:00:07] okay you think it's not true what about
[1:00:09] when god did this and i sort of testify
[1:00:11] what god did in my life
[1:00:12] people i knew testimonies i'd heard to
[1:00:15] be true and confirmed and i could
[1:00:17] testify
[1:00:18] next thing i know he tucked his tail and
[1:00:20] ran out the door
[1:00:22] and the spirit of the lord came down and
[1:00:24] we had a wonderful service
[1:00:27] not sure why i said that
[1:00:31] because god came by jesus came by
[1:00:35] that spirit of doubt came along but
[1:00:37] jesus came by where the man preaches the
[1:00:39] uh evangelistic sermon jesus then jesus
[1:00:42] came
[1:00:42] praise the lord and so this is the same
[1:00:44] thing that happened to cleopas and his
[1:00:46] friend
[1:00:46] they needed to be reminded who they were
[1:00:51] he preached to them part one of christ
[1:00:54] is the mystery of god revealed
[1:00:57] he did
[1:01:03] something in their hearts connected deep
[1:01:05] color to the deep
[1:01:06] they begged him to stay you have to ask
[1:01:08] him to stay
[1:01:10] you have to ask him he's a gentleman hey
[1:01:12] lord i need you
[1:01:13] he likes to be needed he likes to be
[1:01:17] asked for help then what did he do he
[1:01:20] broke bread in their presence
[1:01:22] bread is what life bread of life who is
[1:01:26] the bread of life
[1:01:27] christ before their eye and then their
[1:01:30] eyes were open he broke the bread
[1:01:32] just like in our day he broke the bread
[1:01:34] he revealed himself to us
[1:01:37] our eyes were opened amen we went back
[1:01:39] to the faith of our fathers
[1:01:42] christ broke the bread and ormas the
[1:01:43] bread a type of the word of god being
[1:01:45] broken
[1:01:46] opened up to them then their eyes were
[1:01:48] open and he vanished but they went back
[1:01:50] to jerusalem to be with the other
[1:01:51] believers
[1:01:54] they had a full complete revelation they
[1:01:57] were hearing the word being preached
[1:01:58] from jesus but it wasn't until he opened
[1:02:01] their eyes
[1:02:02] that they had a revelation of who he was
[1:02:04] and went back to
[1:02:06] to to the other disciples so now we're
[1:02:07] gonna pick this quote up again
[1:02:09] proof of his resurrection 1955
[1:02:12] and paragraph 134 isn't that just the
[1:02:15] modern christian today
[1:02:16] we'll restart oh how how could that man
[1:02:19] ever
[1:02:20] fail how could he ever let us down like
[1:02:21] that like this and now we stand in shame
[1:02:24] and disgrace we are going back home to
[1:02:26] start up our fishing and carpentering
[1:02:28] again see
[1:02:28] isn't that just a modern christian today
[1:02:30] oh let the healing take place and
[1:02:33] they're shouting the victory
[1:02:34] let the power of the holy spirit fall
[1:02:35] and they're shouting the victory and
[1:02:37] those who are really filled with the
[1:02:38] holy ghost
[1:02:40] remains that way down through life's
[1:02:42] journey but the man that's still walking
[1:02:44] with the carnal mind
[1:02:46] little discouragement come up something
[1:02:48] go wrong and they go away saying well i
[1:02:50] thought it was all right but
[1:02:51] oh my look at it now i thought that
[1:02:54] little church would never fail
[1:02:55] i thought this person oh saints watch
[1:02:58] that
[1:02:59] it's not one person it's never ever one
[1:03:02] person
[1:03:03] it's not me it's not our pastor it's not
[1:03:05] brother david it's not brother jason
[1:03:06] it's not one person
[1:03:08] there's nothing to do with that for you
[1:03:13] you get to christ because i let me tell
[1:03:16] you
[1:03:16] i'm going to fail you because i'm a
[1:03:18] human i pray that god has grace
[1:03:20] and you forgive me when i do i'm going
[1:03:23] to say something
[1:03:24] and i'm going to offend you maybe i
[1:03:26] already have
[1:03:28] because we're human beings
[1:03:31] but the grace of god what is it love
[1:03:33] covers a multitude of sins
[1:03:36] offenses you got he said you got your
[1:03:38] mind on the wrong thing see but
[1:03:40] he says put your mind on him that can't
[1:03:43] fail
[1:03:44] let your conversation not be about your
[1:03:46] church
[1:03:49] lord i convicted me because i've been
[1:03:51] guilty of that maybe not my church but
[1:03:53] churches
[1:03:55] stop talking about it leave them to
[1:03:58] their own wheat
[1:03:59] leave them to their own grass you have
[1:04:02] your own you eat it you feed on the word
[1:04:03] of god he
[1:04:04] says let your conversation not be about
[1:04:05] your church but about your lord
[1:04:08] that's the one not about your neighbor
[1:04:10] but about your lord let your
[1:04:12] conversations be of
[1:04:13] him you'll never get in trouble if you
[1:04:15] talk about jesus that's right
[1:04:18] talk about your neighbor your neighbor
[1:04:19] might walk up or the person you're
[1:04:21] talking to might talk to your neighbor
[1:04:26] stop talking about this preacher that
[1:04:28] church or that pastor
[1:04:30] focus on christ there will be a lot less
[1:04:34] problems if we all just shut up
[1:04:37] praise the lord be a lot less problems
[1:04:42] amen so let's let's go over in our
[1:04:45] bibles
[1:04:46] to john chapter 21.
[1:04:53] praise the lord oh that's after luke
[1:04:56] there
[1:04:57] okay john chapter 21
[1:05:05] verse three oh i'm sorry respond
[1:05:09] after these things jesus showed himself
[1:05:11] again to the disciples at the sea of
[1:05:12] tiberius
[1:05:13] and on this wise showed he himself there
[1:05:16] were together
[1:05:17] simon peter and thomas called didymus
[1:05:19] and nathanael of cana and galilee and
[1:05:21] the sons of zebedee
[1:05:23] and two other of his disciples
[1:05:27] simon pierce said it saith unto them i
[1:05:30] go
[1:05:30] fishing there my title
[1:05:34] they say unto him we also go with thee
[1:05:35] they went forth and entered into a ship
[1:05:37] immediately and that night they caught
[1:05:38] nothing
[1:05:42] but when the morning was now come jesus
[1:05:44] was on the shore but the disciples knew
[1:05:46] not that it was jesus
[1:05:47] they said then jesus saith unto them
[1:05:49] children have ye any meat
[1:05:50] they answered him no he said unto them
[1:05:53] cast the net on the right side of the
[1:05:54] ship and ye shall find
[1:05:57] they cast therefore and now they were
[1:05:59] not able to draw it up for the multitude
[1:06:01] of fishes
[1:06:02] therefore the disciples whom jesus the
[1:06:04] disciple whom jesus loves saith unto
[1:06:06] peter
[1:06:07] it is the lord now when simon peter
[1:06:09] heard that it was the lord he gird his
[1:06:10] fisher's coat onto him for he was naked
[1:06:13] and did cast himself into the sea
[1:06:16] and the other disciples came in a little
[1:06:17] ship for they were not far from land
[1:06:19] but as it were 200 cubits dragging the
[1:06:22] net with fishes
[1:06:23] as soon as they were come to land they
[1:06:25] saw a fire of coals there and fish laid
[1:06:27] there on and bread
[1:06:28] jesus saith unto them bring up the fish
[1:06:30] which he have now caught
[1:06:32] simon peter went up and drew the net to
[1:06:34] land full of great fishes and hundred
[1:06:36] and fifty and three and for all there
[1:06:38] were so many yet
[1:06:39] was not the net broken he just saith
[1:06:41] unto them come and dine and none of the
[1:06:42] disciples just ask him who art thou
[1:06:44] knowing that it was the lord
[1:06:46] so now here we have peter and
[1:06:51] brother um here we so here we have peter
[1:06:55] now the this the scripture says jesus
[1:06:57] showed himself again to the disciples
[1:06:59] and then at the end of towards the end
[1:07:00] of the chapter it says that this was
[1:07:02] this was the third time he appeared unto
[1:07:04] them
[1:07:04] so we're going to just kind of take a
[1:07:06] little bit of liberty here in this story
[1:07:08] and we're going to go with this the lord
[1:07:10] had risen from the dead
[1:07:11] peter denied the lord three times
[1:07:14] he cursed and denied the lord three
[1:07:16] times that he even knew him
[1:07:18] then the lord comes back and you don't
[1:07:20] we don't read of any interactions
[1:07:22] between the lord and peter
[1:07:23] we hear the lord appearing to the two
[1:07:24] honor roche maest and he appears
[1:07:26] as they're eating a meal and it shows
[1:07:29] himself
[1:07:30] to them but we don't read of any
[1:07:32] interactions with peter so we're going
[1:07:33] to take that
[1:07:34] and we're going to tell this little
[1:07:36] story tonight
[1:07:38] and so here's the lord risen from the
[1:07:40] dead he interpreted his word by bringing
[1:07:42] it to pass
[1:07:43] but then he went away they saw him peter
[1:07:46] saw him once
[1:07:48] he appeared into their midst and then we
[1:07:50] don't know where he went after that
[1:07:52] but here's peter and and and and he
[1:07:56] peter was perhaps now confused the lord
[1:07:59] raised from the because guess what the
[1:08:00] lord raised from the dead and peter says
[1:08:01] i'm going to go fishing
[1:08:02] that doesn't make sense why wouldn't
[1:08:04] peter go tell everybody that jesus rose
[1:08:06] from the dead
[1:08:06] because he did eventually you see
[1:08:09] so there's something going on in peter
[1:08:13] he's discouraged about something he's
[1:08:14] confused he doesn't know what's going on
[1:08:17] okay the lord raised from the dead
[1:08:19] did we really see him was that really
[1:08:21] him alive there in the room
[1:08:24] you know what guys i'm going fishing i
[1:08:26] don't understand because you know peter
[1:08:28] peter was a rough guy
[1:08:29] who spoke his mind a little bit
[1:08:31] outrageous
[1:08:32] out of control and you get the
[1:08:36] impression that he likes
[1:08:37] things in his control he drew the sword
[1:08:40] and chopped the guy's ear off right
[1:08:42] and then he you know he he tried to to
[1:08:44] uh
[1:08:45] um he was getting mad at them at the
[1:08:48] people for breaking the roof in his
[1:08:49] house
[1:08:50] and and he he he's a man who likes to be
[1:08:52] in control
[1:08:53] of what's around him and now he's
[1:08:55] completely
[1:08:57] he has no control on what's happening
[1:08:59] and he doesn't know exactly what's going
[1:09:01] on yet
[1:09:02] we're going to take this liberty if you
[1:09:04] feel differently
[1:09:06] so so he says what's next what's going
[1:09:10] on he's discouraged i'm going fishing
[1:09:13] that's why it's i'm dot dot dot going
[1:09:15] fishing
[1:09:16] i'm going fishing and the disciples are
[1:09:18] like you know what man we're going
[1:09:20] with you let's go fishing perhaps
[1:09:22] peter's thinking it to himself you know
[1:09:23] i don't understand all this
[1:09:24] all this this stuff over here it's it's
[1:09:27] different and then i don't know what's
[1:09:28] going on but
[1:09:29] i know how to fish i can control fishing
[1:09:34] so they went and they caught nothing
[1:09:38] i don't know how many of y'all fish but
[1:09:40] when i go fishing and i catch
[1:09:41] nothing i really enjoy myself i still do
[1:09:44] but if you're fishing and your friend's
[1:09:46] fishing and he's catching his limit
[1:09:48] and you're getting nothing it's
[1:09:51] frustrating
[1:09:52] have you caught any fish no
[1:09:56] fished all night no fish this is what i
[1:09:59] do for a living peter turns to john this
[1:10:01] is what i do for a living bro and i
[1:10:02] haven't caught
[1:10:03] nothing i can't even catch a fish
[1:10:06] i can't i can't even i can't even uh um
[1:10:10] stand up for my lord i deny him three
[1:10:12] times john's like whoa
[1:10:13] i thought we're talking about fish i i
[1:10:16] can't do anything i can't even
[1:10:18] fish i i what am i doing here john why
[1:10:21] why do i even live i should just
[1:10:22] jump overboard and let it take me to the
[1:10:25] bottom what's the point of all this
[1:10:27] did we see jesus was he real was he
[1:10:29] alive is it truth
[1:10:30] is he the messiah or was that some kind
[1:10:32] of ghost or some fig in a
[1:10:34] figment of our imagination i thought i
[1:10:36] could fish and now i can't even
[1:10:38] i caught nothing who who is this joker
[1:10:40] on the shore
[1:10:41] no no fish do you see fish
[1:10:46] he's discouraged throw your net on the
[1:10:50] other side
[1:10:53] he doesn't argue why because he did the
[1:10:57] first
[1:10:58] time and then he cast his net and he
[1:11:01] couldn't drag it to shore
[1:11:03] throw your net on the other side peter
[1:11:06] and his heart goes
[1:11:08] i've heard that before yes sir
[1:11:11] i've heard that before come on guys
[1:11:13] throw the net over
[1:11:15] toss the net over the side one more time
[1:11:17] peter we've been out here all night bro
[1:11:19] you're really losing it we don't even
[1:11:21] know who that guy is
[1:11:23] he's probably over there laughing at us
[1:11:24] because we're throwing our net like he
[1:11:26] said on the right side
[1:11:27] let me ask it john uh peter
[1:11:31] what's the difference between the right
[1:11:32] side of the ship and the left side of
[1:11:33] the ship
[1:11:34] five and a half feet
[1:11:38] just throw it overboard
[1:11:43] they throw it overboard and they can't
[1:11:45] even they barely drag it to shore
[1:11:48] now i'm just gonna take it as as it's
[1:11:50] red here simon peter pulls the net of
[1:11:52] fish
[1:11:53] onto the shores what it says didn't say
[1:11:55] anybody helped him 153 fish
[1:11:57] the fish they caught were tilapia
[1:11:59] galilee tilapia
[1:12:02] 13 to 15 pounds apiece but the spiral
[1:12:06] says great fishes
[1:12:07] so we'll say 15. that's 2500 pounds of
[1:12:11] fish
[1:12:12] peter just dragged down to the shore by
[1:12:13] himself big strong guy
[1:12:16] fun tidbits i don't even know if that's
[1:12:17] important but anyways
[1:12:19] the lafayette sounds good on the fire
[1:12:21] right now
[1:12:22] and so here they are and and now we see
[1:12:25] we
[1:12:26] see peter you know he thought he blew it
[1:12:30] and then the lord blesses him with all
[1:12:32] these fish
[1:12:33] and john says peter it's the lord
[1:12:37] boom out of the boat he goes to shore
[1:12:40] you ever been discouraged sometimes and
[1:12:42] god blesses you just to remind you
[1:12:44] how much he loves you how much he cares
[1:12:48] for you
[1:12:49] here's peter discouraged god doesn't
[1:12:52] come up and
[1:12:53] knock it off son he says here have
[1:12:56] 153 fish that's good money
[1:13:02] no matter what you do god comes along
[1:13:04] right and he says hey son
[1:13:06] it's okay there's this song the yantz
[1:13:08] brothers wrote
[1:13:09] do you know grace amazing grace
[1:13:15] have you heard
[1:13:18] how sweet the sound and
[1:13:22] i think it was at the the camping bible
[1:13:24] way he tells the testimony
[1:13:25] and how he the brother who wrote it
[1:13:27] remember his name louis
[1:13:29] um lineal's brother
[1:13:32] he had a dream and it's like he fell
[1:13:34] down in the dream
[1:13:36] and and and and he saw himself fall down
[1:13:39] and uh you know it's like he was gonna
[1:13:41] go say hey come on son get up knock it
[1:13:43] off
[1:13:44] but instead he was like he said he said
[1:13:46] he just wanted to pick him up
[1:13:49] and hold him close and say it's going to
[1:13:50] be okay and he said his that was like
[1:13:52] the lore with me
[1:13:54] i fall down and get all skinned up and
[1:13:55] he doesn't come along and whip me up
[1:13:57] say get up son knock it off he pulls me
[1:13:59] in close and says
[1:14:00] i love you here's peter discouraged
[1:14:03] denied the lord three times
[1:14:04] cursing while doing it god says here's
[1:14:07] some fish peter
[1:14:08] i love you he goes to shore
[1:14:12] and now he pulls peter aside
[1:14:16] when they had died jesus said to simon
[1:14:18] peter verse 15. simon son of jonas
[1:14:20] loveth thou
[1:14:21] me more than these what is these
[1:14:26] his brothers the fish
[1:14:29] thus life these what
[1:14:32] what is your these that god is asking do
[1:14:35] you love me more than all of this
[1:14:37] do you love me more than this peter
[1:14:42] peter says and now i can see this in my
[1:14:45] head just as real as
[1:14:46] as you all here's peter discouraged the
[1:14:49] lord pulls him aside
[1:14:51] just him and peter not john the beloved
[1:14:54] of the lord
[1:14:54] not the other disciples pulls peter
[1:14:56] aside
[1:14:58] knowing he denied him three times
[1:15:01] cursing denied him cussing bad words
[1:15:06] i don't know blank that guy
[1:15:09] blank talk to me i don't know him right
[1:15:12] just like you hear on the street
[1:15:13] people say he said peter the one giving
[1:15:17] the keys to the kingdom
[1:15:19] the lord pulls him aside says peter do
[1:15:21] you love me all more than this
[1:15:23] i can just see peter get a little choked
[1:15:24] up yes lord
[1:15:26] yes what does he say
[1:15:29] yea lord thou knowest that i love thee
[1:15:33] yea lord thou noah said i love thee
[1:15:35] exactly
[1:15:36] though peter denied him three times god
[1:15:39] could
[1:15:39] see his heart and he knew that the flesh
[1:15:43] was contradicting how
[1:15:44] peter actually felt inside sometimes you
[1:15:48] meet people they have the most
[1:15:49] arrogant attitude you can't even stomach
[1:15:52] their ego
[1:15:53] because inside they're a hurt little boy
[1:15:56] or they're a hurt little girl
[1:15:57] and you gotta look past that shell that
[1:16:00] that you just want to punch and look
[1:16:03] into their heart and say they're acting
[1:16:04] like that because they're afraid
[1:16:06] of the world and you reach out to them
[1:16:09] and you show them the love of christ
[1:16:11] they might spit in your face but at
[1:16:13] least you did your part
[1:16:15] and they may come back later and say
[1:16:17] thank you right you don't know
[1:16:21] so he says peter do you love me he says
[1:16:23] lord you know that thou knowest that i
[1:16:25] love you he says unto him feed my lambs
[1:16:27] he say it to him again the second time
[1:16:29] because peter is thinking
[1:16:31] i can't i denied him in the pressure how
[1:16:34] am i gonna preach
[1:16:35] how am i gonna feed the lambs how am i
[1:16:37] gonna do this i i couldn't even stand
[1:16:39] the pressure
[1:16:39] and confess i knew him the lord pulls
[1:16:41] him in again and says peter
[1:16:44] do you love me yay lord now no one said
[1:16:48] i love me
[1:16:49] he says unto him feed my sheep
[1:16:52] peter's still having a hard time i wish
[1:16:55] i could remember but i heard one time
[1:16:57] three times he denied him three times
[1:16:59] jesus asked do you love me
[1:17:01] feed my sheep
[1:17:04] he said unto him the third time simon
[1:17:06] son of jonas
[1:17:08] loveth thou me the lord gave him three
[1:17:11] chances
[1:17:12] to redeem what he said before for every
[1:17:15] time he denied him
[1:17:17] god gave him the chance to
[1:17:20] confess him and his love for him
[1:17:24] he says he says peter was grieved
[1:17:27] because he said unto him the third time
[1:17:28] loveth thou me and he said unto
[1:17:30] him lord thou knowest all things
[1:17:33] thou knowest that i love thee jesus says
[1:17:36] unto him
[1:17:37] feed my sheep verily verily i say unto
[1:17:41] thee when thou was young thou gerdest
[1:17:43] walk as dither thou woodest but when
[1:17:46] thou shalt be old
[1:17:47] thou shalt stretch forth thy hand and
[1:17:49] another shall gird thee and carry thee
[1:17:50] wither thou wouldest not
[1:17:52] this spake signifying by what death he
[1:17:54] should glorify god
[1:17:56] and when he had spoken this he saith
[1:17:58] unto him
[1:18:00] follow me amen oh saint
[1:18:03] god has such grace
[1:18:07] god has such mercy god has such
[1:18:10] love for you pulling you aside
[1:18:16] giving you the chance to confess your
[1:18:18] love to him
[1:18:20] and then he has two simple words
[1:18:23] follow me follow me
[1:18:27] then peter turning about sees the
[1:18:29] disciple whom jesus loved following
[1:18:31] which also leaned on his breasts that
[1:18:32] supper and said lord
[1:18:34] which is he that betrayeth thee excuse
[1:18:37] me so that's what
[1:18:38] he said at the supper and then 21 peter
[1:18:41] seeing him say to jesus lord
[1:18:43] and what shall this man do the lord
[1:18:46] pulls him aside i think i think it is
[1:18:49] it's significant feed my sheep
[1:18:53] follow me then he says he begins to look
[1:18:55] at the other preacher
[1:18:56] or the other pastor or the other church
[1:18:58] what about them what about the situation
[1:19:00] over here
[1:19:00] what about what you said about this the
[1:19:02] lord says
[1:19:04] something that we can take to heart
[1:19:05] tonight
[1:19:07] if i will that he tarry till i come what
[1:19:09] is that to thee
[1:19:11] what does it matter what i do with them
[1:19:13] or what they're doing with them
[1:19:15] follow me he says follow thou me r
[1:19:22] in other words the lord paul peterson
[1:19:25] says
[1:19:25] peter in other words he says peter you
[1:19:27] are forgiven
[1:19:29] he doesn't approach the subject he just
[1:19:31] pulls him in
[1:19:32] close letting him know peter you are
[1:19:35] forgiven
[1:19:36] have courage and go do what i called you
[1:19:38] to do because
[1:19:39] pete god the lord gave peter the key to
[1:19:41] the kingdom
[1:19:42] yeah what does peter peter do when the
[1:19:44] lord goes
[1:19:46] he goes fishing discouraged
[1:19:49] yet believing he's able to do what god
[1:19:51] asked him to do so god pulls him in
[1:19:53] go do what i called you to do john we
[1:19:55] already read the scripture
[1:19:56] so just follow him whether you fully
[1:19:59] understand it or not
[1:20:09] excuse me he hasn't asked you for your
[1:20:13] theology
[1:20:15] he doesn't ask you to have an answer for
[1:20:17] everything happening around you
[1:20:19] he said simply follow me when you ask
[1:20:22] him lord what about this he says what is
[1:20:26] it to you
[1:20:26] follow me
[1:20:30] what about what about this did this
[1:20:31] really happen what does it matter
[1:20:34] follow me because if you follow christ
[1:20:38] he will lead you to all
[1:20:42] all truth there's nothing you can do
[1:20:46] to separate yourself from the love of
[1:20:49] god
[1:20:52] there's nothing you can do to separate
[1:20:55] yourself from the love of god amen
[1:21:04] there's a song i'm trying to remember
[1:21:06] there's the words to it
[1:21:08] i just can't remember it basically it's
[1:21:12] a song
[1:21:13] as it goes the lady sat down to counsel
[1:21:16] with this pastor and she says you know
[1:21:18] i've done all this how how could i
[1:21:22] come back just to serve
[1:21:25] to to you know how how could the lord
[1:21:27] even want me now what because of what
[1:21:29] i've done
[1:21:33] and uh man i can't remember the words
[1:21:37] basically uh does it he oh that's what
[1:21:40] it is
[1:21:41] he'll do whatever it takes
[1:21:48] he'll he'll go lower than your worst
[1:21:50] mistake
[1:21:52] he'll do whatever it takes
[1:21:55] maybe i'll sing that sometime you see
[1:21:57] it's not about your ability it's about
[1:21:59] faith in history
[1:22:04] goodness gracious if it was up to us i
[1:22:07] wouldn't be here
[1:22:10] god places the gift in my life to
[1:22:12] minister and i love
[1:22:14] following what god has called me to do
[1:22:17] so when i say this it's a bib
[1:22:19] tongue-in-cheek
[1:22:21] do you think i want to be a preacher
[1:22:24] but you can't get past it because what
[1:22:26] god calls you to do and you find joy
[1:22:28] and inspiration in it but the carnal
[1:22:31] flesh he doesn't want to do this
[1:22:35] the carnal flesh doesn't want to raise
[1:22:36] their hands
[1:22:38] wednesday night carl fletcher doesn't
[1:22:40] want to be here wednesday night
[1:22:44] it's not about your ability it's about
[1:22:46] faith in his it's not about your
[1:22:48] accomplishments it's about
[1:22:50] his victory it's not you about your
[1:22:52] understanding it's about revelation only
[1:22:54] he can give next time you decide to just
[1:22:57] go back to emmaus
[1:22:59] or just go fishing remember these words
[1:23:01] follow
[1:23:02] me next time you find something
[1:23:05] magicians you want to come tonight next
[1:23:07] time you find something you just you
[1:23:08] just girl
[1:23:09] you can't get over it you can't get it
[1:23:11] out of your head
[1:23:13] remember follow me follow
[1:23:16] me say to god it's that simple
[1:23:20] you say oh you see these people we left
[1:23:22] and now we just follow
[1:23:24] jesus and they're living a life directly
[1:23:27] contrary to the scripture
[1:23:28] they don't have revelation for one thing
[1:23:30] and what does it matter what they're
[1:23:32] doing it grieves me to bring that
[1:23:35] up but it it just comes up i don't put
[1:23:37] it in my notes it just comes up and
[1:23:39] that's because that's just what we're
[1:23:40] dealing with right now right you
[1:23:41] understand that i'm not pointing my
[1:23:42] fingers at any man
[1:23:43] or any people um it doesn't matter what
[1:23:47] they're doing that's why we don't read
[1:23:48] their stuff
[1:23:49] let them know who cares what they say
[1:23:52] when they try to tell you that
[1:23:53] tell you they try to preach their
[1:23:55] doctrine to you
[1:23:57] if you have to just hang up the phone
[1:24:00] if you have to mute their notifications
[1:24:03] on their on
[1:24:05] whatever message or whatever it is
[1:24:07] delete their conversation block their
[1:24:08] phone number
[1:24:09] i give you permission even if they're
[1:24:12] your relation
[1:24:13] because you don't have to be subject to
[1:24:15] their gospel
[1:24:18] you don't have to accept it in the
[1:24:20] carnal
[1:24:21] in the on the on the the secular carnal
[1:24:23] side i i
[1:24:24] i encourage you to to there's books
[1:24:28] on what's called boundaries
[1:24:32] boundaries with people but as a message
[1:24:35] believer we have boundaries why because
[1:24:37] do i fear that they're going to convince
[1:24:39] me otherwise
[1:24:40] absolutely not but guess what i'm flesh
[1:24:45] i'm man remember and when i read their
[1:24:49] stuff
[1:24:49] the man rears up and starts to scream
[1:24:53] down in my head
[1:24:55] i don't want to deal with that that is
[1:24:57] just going to bring me down
[1:25:00] do you want do you do you want to go and
[1:25:02] hear negative stuff all the time
[1:25:04] it actually makes you physically ill did
[1:25:06] you know that
[1:25:07] negative people get sick
[1:25:11] being around negative people can make
[1:25:12] you sick why do you think you just feel
[1:25:15] ugh when it's cloudy for days or rainy
[1:25:18] for days
[1:25:19] because you get depressed the sun comes
[1:25:21] out
[1:25:22] today was a beautiful day by the way i
[1:25:24] hope you got outside and got some of
[1:25:25] that sun
[1:25:28] because we're so much affected by what's
[1:25:30] around us and the atmospheres we're in
[1:25:32] so if you want to be the best christian
[1:25:34] you can possibly be
[1:25:36] what atmosphere should you always be in
[1:25:41] the atmosphere of the lord because
[1:25:43] that's going to build you up
[1:25:45] every time you get tore down okay did
[1:25:47] you know when you fly an airplane but
[1:25:49] the david here knows
[1:25:50] if you push down you have to pull back
[1:25:55] up to go up you can't just you know how
[1:25:58] you steer you turn around the corner and
[1:25:59] they let go the wheel and it straightens
[1:26:00] itself out
[1:26:01] you can't turn in an airplane and let go
[1:26:03] and let it straighten itself out
[1:26:05] you got to turn back the other way
[1:26:07] that's one thing you got to learn at
[1:26:08] first you know a little bit of rudder
[1:26:09] a little bit of turning of the yolk if
[1:26:11] you're not careful you go
[1:26:14] the whole time fine i've done it you
[1:26:17] have to learn to turn it
[1:26:19] and then turn it back right at the right
[1:26:21] minute so you level out
[1:26:24] it's harder than you think to get those
[1:26:25] wings to go flat
[1:26:28] the same thing every time you do
[1:26:29] something that brings you down
[1:26:31] or turns you the wrong way
[1:26:34] you can just let go and play oh it's
[1:26:35] going to be okay you got to take the
[1:26:36] yolk and you got to turn
[1:26:38] back and you got to be careful because
[1:26:40] if you overturn
[1:26:42] you get legalistic you got to just turn
[1:26:45] it right just
[1:26:46] knees it in hey as you start to see that
[1:26:48] the wings swing over that
[1:26:50] bubble start to come into its spot you
[1:26:53] step on the bubble okay
[1:26:54] right rudder the bubble's going right
[1:26:56] step on the right rudder
[1:26:57] pull that in little yaw right bring it
[1:27:00] right in flat
[1:27:02] and then you can get a little wheel
[1:27:05] there right it's been a while since i'm
[1:27:06] flying but flow but
[1:27:07] you can adjust it and then you can hands
[1:27:09] off right
[1:27:10] trim thank you you can trim it right
[1:27:14] not your hair you trim it okay and then
[1:27:17] it then it's coasting along
[1:27:19] but when the weather gets rough now
[1:27:21] we're not talking about
[1:27:22] 737's talking about small airplanes
[1:27:25] small engine plane
[1:27:26] the weather gets rough you got to have
[1:27:28] your hands in the controls
[1:27:30] you gotta fly through that storm guess
[1:27:32] what god
[1:27:34] is the best
[1:27:37] he's not really your co-pilot he's the
[1:27:39] pilot
[1:27:40] you're the co-pilot god will bring you
[1:27:43] right through
[1:27:45] he'll bring you right through the storm
[1:27:48] i mentioned a story here a while ago
[1:27:50] there's a
[1:27:50] he was called the bush pilot doctor he
[1:27:53] flew to
[1:27:54] remote places in alaska to give medical
[1:27:57] attention to people
[1:27:58] and he was a what you call fairweather
[1:28:01] pilot he had never gone through a
[1:28:02] serious storm right
[1:28:04] small airplanes for the most part don't
[1:28:05] have instrument rating
[1:28:08] you can't fly ifrs instruments you have
[1:28:10] to fly
[1:28:11] via visual flat rooms and so um
[1:28:15] he got through into this they had to go
[1:28:18] through this path
[1:28:19] and it just closed in right airplane
[1:28:21] airplane can't just go above the clouds
[1:28:23] and fly over the mountains
[1:28:24] there's wind up there flip that thing
[1:28:26] right over so he's going through the
[1:28:28] valley
[1:28:28] and through the valley and it's muggy
[1:28:30] right next thing you know
[1:28:32] all he sees is white you can't see the
[1:28:34] ground
[1:28:35] he can't see the blue sky what happens
[1:28:37] is your head goes upside down with that
[1:28:39] and you get vertigo and so a more
[1:28:42] experienced pilot had already made it
[1:28:44] through
[1:28:44] and he said okay keep
[1:28:48] no matter what you feel keep
[1:28:52] watch the instrument keep it flat
[1:28:55] keep it lined up you're not upside down
[1:28:57] here's the other pilot talking in
[1:28:59] through the valley you're not upside
[1:29:00] down
[1:29:01] keep flying and fly this heading
[1:29:03] [Music]
[1:29:04] he couldn't look at around him if he
[1:29:06] looked past the windshield and out the
[1:29:08] door
[1:29:09] out of the side he would have got
[1:29:11] disorientated
[1:29:12] tried to turn try to go and he would
[1:29:14] plow right into the side of the mountain
[1:29:16] but he had some on the other side he
[1:29:17] couldn't see the other pilot but he
[1:29:19] could hear him
[1:29:20] you can't see christ per se but you can
[1:29:24] hear him and he's saying
[1:29:25] heading 360.
[1:29:30] keep it steady keep it flat
[1:29:33] keep it level some pilots used to put a
[1:29:36] glass of water on there
[1:29:38] dash right because you know if the
[1:29:40] water's in the cup
[1:29:42] you're right side up
[1:29:42] [Music]
[1:29:46] it's true it sounds silly but you need
[1:29:48] that when you're in those conditions
[1:29:51] so what i'm saying is when you get to a
[1:29:53] valley and you can't see
[1:29:54] up or down hands on the yoke
[1:29:59] and listen to the voice and follow your
[1:30:01] heading and you will make it
[1:30:03] completely through to the other side the
[1:30:06] clouds will split and you'll see the sun
[1:30:07] and you'll know you were right side up
[1:30:10] follow me praise the lord let's stand
[1:30:15] [Music]
