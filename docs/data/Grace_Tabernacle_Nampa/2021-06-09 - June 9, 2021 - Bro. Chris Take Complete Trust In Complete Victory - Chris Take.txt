you in our hearts that you speak to us tonight oh we're depending on you we're looking forward to hearing from you [Music] as always it's good to be in the house of god amen always expecting to hear from him since you're already standing if you want to turn in your bibles to revelations chapter 15 amen it's good to be back we enjoyed our trip down and enjoyed hearing what god did for the youth at camp and me and my wife had a little break over the weekend just really appreciated that but um brakes are good and they're needed but i'm ready to get back into saddle so revelation chapter 15 amen verse two everybody we saw sends their greetings back just plain blanket statement there and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and then that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of god and they sing the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous are thy works lord god almighty just and true are thy ways thou king of saints zechariah chapter 2 from one end of your bible to the other beautiful these books separated by hundreds of years if not more it doesn't matter which way you go take a scripture here in the scripture there and it all perfectly lines up a testament that god truly wrote this with amen zechariah 2 verse 8 for thus saith the lord of hosts after the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye of christ's eye for behold i will shake mine hand upon them and they shall be a spoiled to their servants and ye shall know that the lord of hosts hath sent me see and rejoice o daughter of zion for lo i come and i will dwell in the midst of thee saith the lord amen lord blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated tonight amen you are the apple of his eye daughter of zion and he promises to dwell in the midst of thee amen looks like we lost our powerpoint maybe but oh there we go my title tonight is complete trust is complete victory unless uh so a lot of words my subtitle is true interpretation of your christ relationship now tonight lord the lord would will we want to talk about finding victory from interpreting your relationship with your heavenly father through hurts from people who claimed to represent him so finding the true interpretation of what your relationship with christ how christ views you and how he wants you to see him a true revelation of that not not basing this upon false false representation of christ amen we don't want to know christ through man's interpretation of him we want to follow christ by revelation of who christ is in you amen so complete trust is complete victory when you can trust in god fully when you can give everything you have to god god will give you the victory and this isn't necessarily tonight about the interpretation of the word though it is it's a different angle i guess and so i pray that god give me the words and and just speak through me tonight so i don't fall into the the uh habits of phrases that we use because i really want to bring this from a different angle and that is that we we serve god we love god god's given up given us the holy ghost we have a revelation of the word but on this earth we were on a journey and a journey to become more and more in the image of christ and along the way we pick up hurts and we pick up pains and we pick up complexes because we live in the flesh man who is fallen and if we're not careful we can start to base on on past things and and say well um i don't do this anymore i have been delivered from this and i don't have these problems anymore i'm good and we give our we turn a blind eye to the things deeper within us and i believe that as we come down uh closer to the statue of the perfect man we're not breaking off big chunks we're breaking off small pieces we're we're putting in the detail of the crease in the shirt and we're putting in the finer details of the eye and and the the creases and the knuckles of the hand we're getting down to the fine details because gods are going to come for a bride with the blemish he's coming for a perfect representation of himself and so god is starting to get down to the nitty-gritty goddess i need to move down deeper into our hearts and say look i'm not worried about this stuff that that um this over here stop looking at the big things and start asking yourself on a daily am i doing everything that i can to please my savior am i doing everything that i can to fall in line with his word and what i want to focus by god's grace tonight is that sometimes we can look at christ we can look we can view a certain um a certain area of his word or a a um a doctrine if you will or just or just a a um a description of christ we can view that through a false representation of christ sometimes we can say oh you know um and one of the big ones is is that that this is kind of where this came from sitting in in church the other day it started off with the title i've got a problem calm the father and the the lord is through my heart and said if instead of i've got a problem father god comes down and he can and he he works in your life and so you can trust him and then you don't you don't serve him or you don't look at him through your relationship with your earthly father if that was one of pain and and hurts through life instead a comma is put there when god delivers you from that and you can come to christ fully trusting him and say i've got a problem father and so that kind of just converted down to this complete trust is complete victory and so that's a big one that that it kind of comes came came out in the study of this is that that's what you see a lot people have a hard time trusting god as their father if they had a hard time trusting their earthly father and what god wants tonight is he wants you to find complete trust in him and the only way you can do that is you have to take the description of christ directly from the truth of christ which is the message of the hour which is the word and this goes into all sections right this is the reason we needed the seventh the seventh messenger this is we the reason we needed all these things down through time that were lost and dispersed and and mixed into time and and the loose sins that had to be tied up because we needed a true representation of christ so if you step back and you take a broad view of the message and and and and the word um you say well i have a true understanding i have a true revelation of that and that's why i want to get into it even deeper you have i believe that even when you have that there's little things in your life that you keep you keep um you keep down you don't pay attention you don't listen to because you you're not realizing that you're viewing christ with the wrong idea you're viewing what god is trying to tell you through a relationship you have with a with a with a pastor or a preacher or a friend or or something that an event that happened in your life a big one that it we're kind of experiencing around the message right now is emotions and people can say well i got the holy ghost because i cried i got the holy ghost because i was emotional at the altar and then their life doesn't line up with that and they begin to question god that's a misrepresentation of god's truth about receiving the holy ghost and so they they can go through life even sometimes thinking well i got the holy ghost because i expressed emotions at the altar or i spoke in tongues because someone told them or someone maybe didn't directly tell them but someone portrayed christ to them that that's what it was all about and and they go years down the road and suddenly realize they never even had it and all the doubts and the questions and the struggles they had god says look that's not what it is that was a false representation here is the truth of it i was actually talking to a brother down there and i s god has done an incredible work in his life and has brought restoration to his family he said i sat in this church for 17 years before realizing the truth and receiving the holy ghost it happened but god is gracious and god is true so what are what are what is um praise the lord so it's about relationship with christ which if you think about it is the whole point and it's com and this is completely about the word of god my wife sometimes she come to me and she'll say i don't understand you know why do i feel this way or or you know what's going on and and i laugh and i joke and i say sometimes i know you better than you know you and i said that and i told them i said well that's the same with christ god knows us better than we know ourselves and we we we we stress and we figure what's wrong with us what's going on what's my problem and god is is ready and he brings along an answer and shows you and brings through that that complete trust he brings the victory over that amen it can be a big it can be a complex in your life that come along through who knows what the devil got in there and so you look at god and you view this that you view you might view christ through that complex and god tries to move on you could be a it could be a complex of coming to the altar and you you won't do it and you can't do it and and and and everything else in your life is lining up and god's working on you and and and and but this little area you you um help me lord you you you try to understand what it you you kind of look past it but god comes along and he shows you the truth the truth of of his word and he and he and he deals with your heart and suddenly you realize oh i'm lacking victory because i'm not trusting in this in this in this portion amen praise the lord i hope the lord can straighten that out that was amen praise the lord the problem is when believers have a knowledge of the message doctrine but a wall within their heart prevents christ from becoming real to them and this can be as a whole someone without the holy ghost has a mental knowledge of the message and and you know the song take it from my head down to my heart and there can be a wall there and they not even realize it the same thing you can have a revelation of the message as a whole but there's certain things that are just in your head and they haven't moved to your heart because you have a wall up because you have a you're you're you're looking at it through the wrong interpretation through the wrong relationship you're looking at it through an earthly relationship or an earthly understanding and god's trying to tell you don't take an earthly representation don't take a physical or natural representation take the spiritual take the truth of god's word take the truth and believe it here instead of believing it from them over there so praise the lord amen we're going to go to ruth chapter 3. you can follow along if you would like to judges then ruth so rude chapter three gonna pick up here in the middle of the story then verse one then naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall i not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now is not boaz of our kindred with whose maidens thou wast behold he went with barley tonight in the threshing floor wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy raiment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking and it shall be when he lieth down that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what thou shalt do and she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me i will do but the men says in the message the waters of separation 1955 she had picked up the handfuls and she thrashed them out happy taking them back and that night she went down to to when he was winnowing wheat that night at the garner look ruth here uh um a example of the bride of christ is is is getting food from christ he's getting she's getting food she's she's she's taking it in she's she's getting ner she's being nurtured by christ but she still doesn't know him she still doesn't know him and she's going along happily in that not realizing there's greater things if she would go in and find a marriage with boaz but the word naomi the jew just like paul took the message to the gentiles she brings the truth to ruth and says look he's a kinsman um do you want me to look for your rest for you you need to go find your rest your your what what's wrong see ruth sometimes god has to give you a revelation not only of his word but a revelation of what you need from his word we have in the in the industry that i work in software engineer um our programming there's some there's a saying thank you for showing me what i didn't know i needed to know because it's very common you don't even understand what's going on you can't even in your wildest imagination figure it out until someone says oh that's because you need to know this to figure this and so so excuse me you need to know what you need the right information so you can ask the right question that's what i'm trying to say so god sometimes god has to give you a revelation sometimes of what you need isn't god good my goodness the grace of god you don't even know ruth didn't even know she needed to meet boaz she was getting plenty of food the bread was baking like crazy and she was getting extra portions so naomi says look ruth what you need is you need to go meet boaz that it may be well with thee listen he's winnowing barley tonight in the threshing floor here's what you need to do so now the word just like paul brought the word to the gentile the word comes and tells ruth what she needs to do to step into further blessings to step into a further relationship with christ amen that's why it comes to a choice will you go further or will you deny it and when you deny it that's when you step out of that so um he goes on to say he says um at the barn boaz laid down and when he laid down ruth notice this not ashamed to dispose herself to this man so ruth had to receive a revelation of what she needed then she had to trust what the word said about boaz she couldn't say well boaz might be like my other husband who let me down who gave me no no no who gave me no child in other words there was no life in that relationship so she said well what if it's gonna be like that again so um she had to to find and trust the word to fully surrender to completely trust so she could find complete victory so she steps she goes to to boaz he says um and not ashamed to dispose herself to this man as the real true born again church tonight is not ashamed to dispose herself to the holy ghost call of god when right down into the barn with this man giving him trust every man that comes to christ must forsake everything on both sides and put his full faith in the lord jesus christ no matter what your mother says what your daddy says what this says or mama says or what anybody says true trust christ i like how he ends this he says don't be afraid you have to fear is the devil's favorite weapon he loves fear because fear paralyzes you fear you know you you see somebody you know they they're all brave right there's there's all kinds of stories of people falling off cliffs are almost falling off us because they're all you know cocky and they stand look at this down the very edge and all of a sudden it hits them and fear takes over and they just can't turn around and walk away and so they either fall they almost fall it happens right fear paralyzes you in the natural and the spiritual fear can keep you from fulfilling fulfilling god's desire for your life you stay you stay maybe you're being called to something and uh i remember um when i was when i was when i was 15 i first felt the call to preach and i thought that's totally absurd i'm never ever going to be a preacher and um i was told you know just just get into the word of god and if it's god's desire it'll just come out even more and i was i think i was 18 and brother lindsey mcgrady was preaching and um i didn't i didn't want to preach and i was feeling feeling called to preach because i was afraid to preach and i was sitting in the second row or front row back on the left side and as he's preaching along he points and he says don't be afraid do what god has called you to do and god delivered me from the fear he gave me the calling he gave me the position to play the ability to fulfill his desire for my life but i was too afraid to step forward see it calms down god's going to do everything he can to give you what you need to fulfill the revelation he has of you in him but you have to take the first step forward that's what this free moral agency the funny thing of it is is you will if you're predestinated that's a whole other sermon but um so you have to step past fear so ruth had to step past the fear of the what ifs oh we can just go on and on about what ifs we can go on and on about what about this and or what will they think that's the worst thing guess what nobody really cares in that aspect we all care for one another but in that aspect no one's gonna think less of you they're gonna be if they're a true son or daughter of god they're gonna be excited for you and so um sometimes you have to take the step of faith and i and any any person who's been serving god for any amount of time any amount of time god can do a lot in one week one day you know that you have you when you trust god and you take a step of faith into the unknown knowing he knows the unknown you find complete victory because you're completely trusting in him that's how abraham had to take the revelation that i needed he needed to leave and walk away onto the desert and just where are you going abraham not really sure but god said to to follow him he had to have faith in order to do that he had to have complete trust so ruth could not interpret the man boaz through any other previous relationship you can't interpret your relationship with christ through a previous relationship with another religion or or or even in the natural with a with a a man or a previous pastor or preacher there are many people who can't get past the hurts of previous pastors or preachers who have done things said things been a certain way because they view christ through that's like someone who grows up being preached and get being preached at through like a kind of an angry twist on the word of god they go through that thinking god's mad at them and and so because of that false representation of christ they view god as is standing there with a switch ready to get them and so they serve god differently they serve god out of fear instead of out of love amen praise the lord and that's why i read that script scripture at the beginning zechariah 2 you're the apple of his eye and daughter of zion he will come dwell in the midst of thee i really that god's been really dealing with my heart i've already said this up here uh before that he's trying to tell the bride look trying to tell us myself included i love you yeah i really really love you don't be afraid to come to me when you when you you you've slipped up or or when you just you just don't understand why you feel what the way you feel you don't understand this relate this situation he says just he's saying just come to me i love you we're his bride we're his wife do you does a good true husband ever want to just beat his wife no no when she comes to him oh my all he wants to do is just hug her pull her in close and and and give her even more love and that's what we're coming to because because the bride needs to get into that relationship with christ to receive amen the seed of christ so she had to take the truth of boaz that she learned from the word if ruth looked entirely at the truth of boaz from the message of her day it said boaz will take care of you boaz will love you boaz will heal you boaz will deliver you that's what the truth said about boaz but she had to have faith in that truth it's there for us it's there for us to read it's there for us to to to hear but you have to accept that it really is the truth and sometimes we accept parts of it and not the whole and then we wonder why our victory is not complete we have partial victory we have but because we are not trusting christ completely so that he can come and give us complete and total victory so um you struggle we can struggle to get past the hurts of life when you struggle to trust christ you say why can't i find victory over here and it's because over here you won't fully trust him over over here you won't fully give yourself to them and this goes right back to surrendering everything to christ and it goes right back to you know total separation from from everything that's that is uh from all unbelief everything that is not of christ and that that can go right on down from from from the lust of the flesh and and and drinking all the way down to complexes in your life brother battle talks about an inferiority complex and that can go right on down to that you feel like you're less so when you read the word and you read about the promises that god has for the bride you say oh yes for the bride but not for me so you live below your privilege and when you live below your privilege you live below your victory because living below your privilege doesn't just mean you won't accept god's blessings it means you won't accept god's deliverance and when you where god is is there and he's like he's trying to get to your heart that's what i was trying to say a few minutes ago god is trying to get to your heart are you going to let someone into your heart who's yelling at you who's angry with you who's telling you constantly what you're doing wrong no you're gonna put a wall up you're gonna you're gonna put up a fortification and then you're going to you're going to you're going to say what you think will please them to keep them happy lip service you're going to serve them you're going to serve god with an intellectual understanding sometimes we we look at people who have an intellectual understanding of christ and think what's wrong with them why won't they just you know if they would just let god work on them and let god deal with them you know they would go down to their heart if they just understand that you know it's all about the heart not about the head if they would just realize it's in their head when what when what we should be saying is god lead me to pray what's keeping them right from letting it into their heart because they want to you want to but there's something that's stopping you some and that's the flesh right because that's the badger skin and we talk about the badger skin and we say oh you know a temper that can fight a buzzsaw but sometimes the bad your skin is there because of past uh hurts or past or complexes in your life where you're serving god but you just you don't want to lay at the feet of boaz because it's kind of awkward it's kind of awkward right she's going in the room full of men to lay down to feed a boat she's probably thinking what if someone catches me what are you doing in here or what if this or what if that but that's where she found her victory and then and then she had to trust that she could make it to the feet of boaz but then she had to trust that boaz would respond to her need the way she was told he would you have to trust that when you come to god with a need someone can tell you oh look anytime man you need anything just just call me up we'll talk and the first time you call them they all they can do is tell you what you're doing wrong and chew you out are you ever going to call them back again no so she had to say you know she's probably thinking about her her husband i forget his name she had to she had to look past that and say what what she had to believe like she had to believe what the word said about bobas i'm sorry if i'm repeating myself amen if you understand amen amen so stop looking at your relationship with christ through your earthly relationships he always loved you he always will god is not angry with you you are his pride and joy you're the apple of his eye sometimes we can get to serving god through superstition and we think well i'm feeling i'm feeling led to do this does that mean something bad is going to happen or i i want to pray for for um you know i want to pray for patience but i'm afraid if i do you know then i'm going to go through well i want to pray that i'll trust the lord more but but what if i go through this really really bad trial and things are really really bad god's always teaching you and bringing us through things but don't serve god as if he's a reactionary god he's not you you you uh there was a sister i was i could remember her testimony she grew up and her understanding of god was if she ran a red light she might die because she she broke the law and god's just gonna just smite her down but that's not that's not the god i serve that's not the god the bible the bible talks about look i had to pray lord i don't know why you want me to preach this because you think as a preacher you get up and you think you think about everybody in the congregation sometimes if you have a tendency to get in the flesh and think okay who could this be for but i have no idea i can think i know you but i god christ knows you and and i and you have to just you just have to fully surrender and and just say what what god lays upon your heart and the the big thing that that comes to me from this from this thought is is is when you have a father who didn't do things right didn't treat you right didn't show you the love he should have didn't didn't and and and because of that that's how you look at christ he's your father we sing this long my father knows what i need but if your earthly father didn't know what you need how can sometimes you can say i can't get past that i can't i can't i can't serve god or or you are serving god but you're doing it through fear and when you serve god through fear there's victory lacking in your life it could be little things it could be small things maybe there's healing lacking in your life because you you you just can't forget let yourself fully trust him because of what happened before so instead of saying lord help me trust you more lord help me trust you more say lord help me see you as my father like the words as you are help me to see you as my husband like the word says you are maybe your husband doesn't have his act together but um god is go but instead of looking after that or or past what not or the other you look at god through what the word says about him and that takes tremendous faith it takes tremendous faith when you has it have a interpretation not that god not that someone told you this is how god is but a similar relationship falsely represented to you what that relationship should be and that's not the truth of what it actually is according to god's word and you have to let yourself be like ruth and say well i'm just going to trust and when she did amen ruth excuse me boaz goes down and is her kinsmen redeemer plays the part of the kinsman redeemer and then now you watch maybe this will be the next sermon she received no life from her womb with her previous relationship the previous husband he died according to the scripture she remarries boaz who redeems her back to she was gentile she had no inheritance but because of her relationship with boaz who was her kinsmen through naomi she's now brings forth a promised son just like the bride of christ and what this is saying tonight is if you can love your boaz christ enough to trust him to lay had his feet in the presence of of many other similar men boaz was in charge of the of the the uh the threshing and everything but there were similar men in his position in the room in the threshing floor taking care of the wheat and doing all this but she went to boaz she went to the true representation of his position and he redeemed her and from that trust came the promised word and that is your victory your victory isn't found in emotion your victory isn't found in some preacher your victory isn't found in your mother your father your brother your sister your uncle your aunt your cousin your victory is found in the word but unless you surrender to boaz and go into that and know him until you do that and bring forth the seed of the word that's where you find your victory because god takes you under the shadow of his wings psalm says takes you into the shadow of his wing and the word that you bring forward is what gives you your victory i'll i decided that amazing god's word when you trust god we don't we don't preach a prosperity message when you trust god and you follow his will even though it's hard scary you find such peace there you find healing in your body you find healing in your relationship you find victory in your spiritual walk when you line right up where god says you should be it's scary to get there sometimes but even though god says don't be afraid don't fear do what do it do do what the word says to do he's going to give you he when he says don't be afraid he's not putting it all on you that you need to deal with your fear he says turn under me and i'll take care of your fear it's like cruise control you don't have to steer actually actually it could be cruise control and you got to follow a map but god is going to bring forth in your life everything he has preordained you to do and uh musicians want to come tonight as the closer we get to the drawing clothes of this age who knows when it will be god is moving on the heart of his bride we have the message of the hour we're feeding on god's word and god is is is is loving on us yes he is absolutely right i don't need to get up here and tell you what you're doing wrong because the way of the way of god's love is god's love is so pure god's love is so righteous just being with him makes you want to be a better person just being with him makes you ever have those those are the best friends you could have just being with them makes you want to be the best christian you can be those are the friends you want to find [Music] those people you want to find it's the same thing with god that's what he says he says you know we don't read our bible and listen to a message because that's our duty or our chore he's inviting us into a communion with him when you find communion through the reading of the word then you that's that's it that's what god is looking for we matthew 25 we preached about the last time where are we in that scripture well if we're if we're receiving seed of christ now we're in with the bridegroom we've shut out the world we've shut out the foolish virgin they're off doing the thing trying to find their oil and we are with christ just because you're in there doesn't mean sometimes you say you sit on the other side of the bedroom that can happen you sleep on that side tonight but we want to continue to surrender because the more we surrender the more we spend time with god [Music] the more you love him and when you love god when you love christ i prefer to say christ i actually when i do my notes i try to say christ instead of god not that that's a bad thing but when you say christ there's a more personal relationship there even i even noticed this one time i was witnessing just uh somebody that was working for us and when i would say i i said jesus christ he stepped back and every time in the conversation i said jesus christ you've got to have this funny look on his face there's power in the name of jesus christ amen that's the name of our husband you are mrs jesus christ and that's what he's telling you tonight because guess what the more he tells us that we are his wife the less yeah when you the more we become [Music] you can get married maybe the honeymoon lasts the first year maybe maybe not and you you're married you're in a relationship you're receiving seed there's rocky times in that so you can't say oh well we can't be married to christ because my flesh no you can't god's able to get into that relationship with you because that's where he has to be for you to come to perfection it has to be that close of a relationship and as time goes on the blood of christ will grow into the statue of a perfect man will drop these ropes of flesh which can never be perfected but the spirit of christ in us forces the outward into alignment with god's word and i trust that that was okay tonight god's word is freaking me [Music] for flowing fountains [Music] greatest love story is our peace i cast all my cares which one were you singing yeah greatest love story let's sing that tonight but uh we'll just not do the verses tonight first three so i'm casting all my tears on you [Music] i know
