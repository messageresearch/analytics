[30:08] sea the
[30:10] word that's what I believe
[30:16] is
[30:21] [Music]
[30:44] [Music]
[30:46] the original
[30:49] scene
[30:50] praise the Lord you love him tonight
[30:54] I love him let's not let the weather and
[30:57] the Dark Skies Cloud your vision tonight
[31:00] he's saying that you're on the vision
[31:02] you know so praise the Lord that
[31:04] original life
[31:06] Let's uh let's just bow our heads
[31:09] gracious Heavenly Father
[31:12] truly it's the original sea the original
[31:14] life you are the vision
[31:17] father and you are what keeps holding me
[31:21] every time that it seems like I I in
[31:24] myself I would go astray somehow with
[31:27] your word that brings me back
[31:29] it's the grace of almighty God in this
[31:32] day unveiled to realize truly that you
[31:36] are that seventh seal and you're
[31:37] unveiled before us
[31:39] as we approach your word this evening
[31:41] I'm asking Lord let the angel of the
[31:43] Lord come with us again tonight
[31:46] seen you do it many times I know I'm in
[31:48] my this flesh Lord there's no good thing
[31:51] even in your own body of Jesus you said
[31:54] there's none good but God
[31:56] so farther tonight
[31:58] come by thy Holy Spirit
[32:00] Quicken each heart and life unto thee we
[32:03] ask in Jesus Christ's name
[32:05] amen
[32:06] while we're standing if we could turn
[32:09] seems like I start in this place a lot
[32:12] for whatever reason to Genesis the first
[32:15] chapter
[32:16] and it's uh not just because it's easy
[32:19] to find but
[32:22] there's so much in just this verse and
[32:26] we'll read a couple different places
[32:27] there quickly before we're seated
[32:31] and we'll read Genesis 1 and 1.
[32:37] I still hear Pages turning that's
[32:39] unusual
[32:41] for where we're starting
[32:44] okay in the beginning God created the
[32:47] Heaven and the Earth and then we'll drop
[32:50] down to verse 26.
[32:54] and it says uh and God said let us make
[32:58] man in our image after our likeness let
[33:01] them have dominion over the fish of the
[33:04] sea the fowl of the air over the cattle
[33:06] over all the Earth and over every
[33:08] creeping thing that creeps upon the
[33:10] Earth and so God created man in his own
[33:12] image in the image of God created he him
[33:15] male and female created he them and then
[33:19] one other place over in the second
[33:21] chapter
[33:23] uh
[33:25] this is where verse 21
[33:29] so 2 and 21.
[33:33] it says and Lord God caused I just want
[33:36] to drop up to verse 18 for just a second
[33:40] it says in the Lord God said it is not
[33:42] good that man should be alone and will
[33:44] make a help meet for him and then we go
[33:46] to 21 and the Lord God caused the Deep
[33:49] Sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and
[33:53] he took one of his ribs and closed up
[33:55] the flesh thereof and the rib which of
[33:57] the Lord God had taken from man made he
[34:00] a woman and brought her unto the man
[34:02] and Adam said this is now bone of my
[34:05] bones
[34:06] Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called
[34:08] woman because she was taken out of man
[34:12] gracious Heavenly Father we've read a
[34:15] great portion of your word this evening
[34:17] it would take us days Lord maybe years
[34:19] to really cover
[34:22] Lord the things of jigs but we ask you
[34:25] tonight to bring it
[34:27] Lord and you said by the quickening
[34:29] power of the Holy Ghost as we come to
[34:32] you in the name of Jesus Christ bless
[34:34] this congregation they're blessed to
[34:36] even hear these things Lord
[34:38] so we let the blessing live in the lives
[34:41] of these tonight and whoever be on the
[34:43] tape land lord may they just receive
[34:46] something to help in this Earthly
[34:48] journey in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[34:50] please be seated
[34:55] brother Paul for having us come tonight
[34:58] I'm glad to be back with you my wife's
[35:01] had a little bug the last couple of days
[35:03] with her stomach and uh
[35:06] and Isaac and Kristen of course she's
[35:08] had the arm thing they took her out of
[35:11] the thing I guess today and said she
[35:12] doesn't need surgery so we're praising
[35:14] the Lord for those things uh
[35:17] and it's uh we were talking the other
[35:20] day or the other night after after
[35:21] service uh last week there and you know
[35:24] people a lot of times they're looking
[35:26] for all kinds of
[35:27] Miracles and I've heard guys even preach
[35:30] oh there's a great day coming and
[35:31] there's going to be this happen and that
[35:32] happened I'm going now wait a second you
[35:34] had two people that were basically
[35:36] supposed to be dead that are alive now
[35:38] and no problems
[35:41] is that a miracle
[35:43] but brother Branham said it won't be a
[35:45] public show this time and yet it's going
[35:47] on all the time
[35:50] you know testimonies just coming out of
[35:52] Central America and we were down there a
[35:54] woman that the doctor said should have
[35:56] been dead on a
[35:58] Saturday or Sunday we didn't get to her
[36:00] till a Wednesday and this was last year
[36:03] when I was there and the Lord raised her
[36:05] up miraculously prayed for her three
[36:07] different times and and the Lord raised
[36:10] her up and by the third time they said
[36:12] she had moved off the bed for 20 days
[36:14] her family was gathered waiting for her
[36:16] to die God raised her up right there my
[36:20] niece was with me she was really excited
[36:22] because she said I've never seen Uncle
[36:23] David I've never seen a miracle before
[36:26] and there was right before us I got to
[36:29] hear her side of the testimony this time
[36:31] when I was down there and she said you
[36:34] know
[36:35] uh I don't know where I was she goes I
[36:37] was in a nice place she could didn't
[36:40] really
[36:41] she goes but I wasn't there but she goes
[36:43] when you guys prayed I heard it
[36:45] and I came back to my body
[36:48] and I said this is a woman that's
[36:49] supposed to have been dead for five days
[36:51] she was it looked like she was I had my
[36:53] ear down there to hear she was still
[36:55] breathing because there's almost no
[36:57] movement she said I came back to my body
[37:00] well
[37:02] we're sitting there and as we were there
[37:04] praying then the rest of the family came
[37:06] in and

[37:09] doing you know we're here we're you know
[37:11] her pastor is here and we're going to
[37:13] pray for her because the Bible says we
[37:15] lay hands on the sick they shall recover
[37:19] and with his stripes we're healed and
[37:21] and so as we're explaining these things
[37:23] to the family I said why don't we all
[37:24] pray for her as a family
[37:26] so I mean there's a whole room full of
[37:28] them and they're going oh yeah okay okay
[37:31] this is good and so we prayed again she
[37:34] said the second time you prayed
[37:37] with the family she said I felt strength
[37:40] come into my body and that second time
[37:42] we prayed she turned her her head to me
[37:44] and spoke to me and said I have faith
[37:49] and when I saw that
[37:51] we explained we said hey look you know
[37:53] Lord's doing something here let's pray
[37:55] one more time when we prayed the third
[37:58] time she said help me up
[38:02] and we helped her out of the bed helped
[38:04] her across the room she sat in a chair
[38:06] and started barking orders to make
[38:08] tamales for her to get make tamales
[38:11] because that's what she was doing at the
[38:13] time for a job was selling tamales on
[38:15] the streets there in Honduras
[38:18] that was her testimony
[38:21] she said when you prayed I came back
[38:23] when you prayed I got strength when I
[38:26] prayed here am I I got a picture of her
[38:28] if you want to see after service now
[38:30] feeding us some more tamales when we
[38:33] were down there this time so it's
[38:35] happening all the time it's here you're
[38:37] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[38:40] these are Promises of God but if we
[38:43] don't recognize them as promises if
[38:45] we're if we you know just shut ourselves
[38:47] in and think oh this is not going to you
[38:48] know it's not happening or it's going to
[38:50] happen way off there or it happened back
[38:52] there in the you know brother Brad and
[38:53] we say that's a denominational Spirit
[38:56] friends
[38:57] always look into what God's gonna do and
[38:59] what he's already done he's doing it
[39:01] right now
[39:04] and I'm sick of hearing it's going to be
[39:06] somewhere else it's right here
[39:09] the kingdom of God is within us
[39:15] praise the Lord so why did we read
[39:17] Genesis 1.
[39:19] well
[39:20] it starts out there and we covered This
[39:22] I Believe last time that we spoke here
[39:25] and we talked about how if you switch
[39:27] the words around and and how God in the
[39:30] beginning or in God the beginning
[39:32] however you know you can turn those
[39:34] words different ways
[39:37] well who's the beginning well we we
[39:40] studied it out it's Jesus Christ
[39:43] we go to the Book of Revelations there
[39:45] and he says in Revelations 1 and 8 I
[39:48] believe it is I'm the beginning and I'm
[39:50] the ending
[39:52] and it's so in God or in Jesus Christ
[39:56] the beginning God created all things we
[39:58] find that in another scripture it says
[40:00] he created all things through Jesus
[40:01] Christ
[40:03] all things were created through Jesus
[40:05] Christ and he's what in the beginning
[40:08] amen thank you brother somebody's
[40:10] listening Hallelujah and so all things
[40:15] were created by the word which is called
[40:18] Jesus Christ
[40:20] so the very first thing the very first
[40:22] if you want to call it a personality
[40:24] trait of God
[40:26] of what we call God and what and how
[40:29] that even Jesus Christ in the Book of
[40:32] Revelations chapter 3 it says that he is
[40:35] the beginning of the creation of God
[40:39] the Elohim the self-exists in all
[40:42] existent one that that has done all of
[40:45] everything
[40:47] when he began to create himself
[40:51] he creates Jesus Christ
[40:54] how did he create Jesus Christ
[40:57] well
[41:00] how do you suppose he did that
[41:02] friends is the word
[41:05] he literally created Jesus Christ by his
[41:08] word he creates himself by his word
[41:12] now
[41:13] here you know we get overseas I was just
[41:16] down in Mexico heard a lot of different
[41:17] preaching and stuff and I hear guys
[41:20] preach a lot of stuff y'all brothers You
[41:22] Preach whatever God lays on your heart
[41:24] I'm not this is not to put anything down
[41:27] with that
[41:28] but I love it
[41:30] when if this word brother Benham said
[41:33] after the seals every scripture here
[41:36] somehow points us to Jesus Christ
[41:39] and I love it that when I can go into
[41:42] the scripture and how important it
[41:44] becomes to me because roommate says
[41:46] we're there we read it we're Made In His
[41:48] Image what's his image
[41:51] look at yourself
[41:53] what are we
[41:55] or in His image
[41:57] what's that image well I got some of
[42:01] this stuff which sure causes me a lot of
[42:03] trouble
[42:04] it really does because it's Fallen image
[42:09] because it was born in sin which is
[42:13] unbelief it was born because of unbelief
[42:15] you know shaped and iniquity came
[42:17] into the world speaking what speaking
[42:20] lies
[42:22] that's things that aren't true
[42:24] and that's what comes out of this
[42:26] outside man
[42:28] and there's a spirit inside of there
[42:30] this is the we're talking about the
[42:32] image of God
[42:33] and there's a spirit inside of there
[42:35] that makes this stuff move
[42:38] makes it talk makes it see makes it and
[42:41] translates all that stuff into
[42:44] the third part which is the soul
[42:48] brother Branham said the soul is the
[42:51] nature of the spirit and that's why ye
[42:53] must be born again
[42:56] because your first birth into this world
[42:58] came because of what unbelief
[43:01] sin iniquity
[43:04] speaking lies that was your first nature
[43:07] because this is what came first
[43:10] after the fall the flesh comes first
[43:13] brother Ben who explained it very
[43:14] clearly he said how does a birth happen
[43:17] he said well uh you know once the seed
[43:20] comes together and the flesh begins to
[43:22] form
[43:24] that becomes your first husband
[43:27] and then uh he said just before the baby
[43:29] comes on the scene he said what happens
[43:31] the spirit comes to enter that body
[43:33] because that body is going to come and
[43:35] to be alive it has to have a spirit
[43:38] but that flash that stuff came about
[43:42] because of unbelief in the garden
[43:45] and because of that
[43:48] that Spirit when it enters this flesh
[43:51] it's stuck with sin iniquity speaking
[43:54] lies
[43:56] because that's what brought about its
[43:58] birth
[44:00] and so that's what it's and so the
[44:02] nature
[44:04] becomes the nature of the world because
[44:07] that becomes our first husband
[44:10] and that's why I'll say it again I like
[44:13] to say it almost every time time I
[44:15] preach she must be born again you have
[44:18] to meet Jesus Christ
[44:21] so that this soul that we have wins
[44:24] inside of us is converted or changed
[44:28] or it becomes a different seed
[44:32] the spoken word is the Original Seed
[44:35] who's the spoken word Jesus Christ
[44:38] and when you receive Jesus Christ you
[44:41] take on a new seed which begins a new
[44:44] nature to be able to believe what he saw
[44:48] us as before the in Ephesians if we get
[44:51] that far before the foundation of the
[44:53] world
[44:55] he saw us in Christ
[44:58] in himself in the word
[45:01] before the foundation of the world
[45:05] and so
[45:07] it says that when we're in that image
[45:10] we're in the image of Christ he didn't
[45:12] let us make man in our image
[45:14] what did it say there he gives him
[45:16] Dominion right is that where it said it
[45:19] yeah let us make man in our image after
[45:20] our likeness let him have do minion
[45:25] over the fish the fowls the cattle
[45:29] everything upon the face of the Earth we
[45:33] have dominion over when we are in His
[45:37] image
[45:39] Prophet gave us some examples the bull
[45:44] as a man he reached for his gun
[45:48] concealed carry right he's going to do
[45:51] the bull in but his gun wasn't there
[45:54] praise the Lord
[45:56] because then he had to turn to something
[45:58] else
[46:00] and he turned to God
[46:02] he said I love that bull God is love
[46:06] who did he turn to what did he turn to
[46:08] the love of God in Jesus Christ the same
[46:12] one that said God so loved the world he
[46:14] gave his only begotten son
[46:16] that whosoever that's me
[46:18] I don't care you know hey praise the
[46:20] Lord I hope you all do believe this
[46:22] for yourselves not just for me that's me
[46:26] I'm one of those who whosoevers that's
[46:29] me
[46:30] should not perish but have everlasting
[46:32] life
[46:34] and when he turned to that what did it
[46:36] do he had dominion over the bull
[46:39] go lay down
[46:42] when we come into the image of the word
[46:44] of God in which the bride of Christ is
[46:47] taking on we have dominion same thing I
[46:51] believe it was at the Hornets of the
[46:53] bees whatever it was
[46:54] needs please go back to the
[46:58] to your nest I didn't mean to hurt you
[47:02] that's dominion and it comes as we enter
[47:05] into the image
[47:07] of God
[47:09] into the image of God and so he was
[47:11] given Dominion now
[47:15] and that's Christ that's Christ in the
[47:18] word he had Dominion
[47:21] so what are we looking there we're
[47:22] looking at Jesus Christ who had Dominion
[47:26] over some little fishes over a lunchbox
[47:28] of a little kid feeds 3 000 people
[47:30] that's dominion over the Food Services
[47:34] okay you know you talk about McDonald's
[47:37] turning out a lot of stuff I'd like to
[47:39] see them do that
[47:42] I understand what I mean he had Dominion
[47:45] he had dominion over the sea he had
[47:46] dominion over the weather
[47:48] now I mentioned that it was God creating
[47:52] Jesus Christ by the word did you know it
[47:54] says in the Book of Psalms he has
[47:55] dominion over the storm
[47:58] what was it he's the word of God and the
[48:01] word of God that was spoken back here in
[48:04] a seed form
[48:06] dominion over the seas over the storms
[48:08] Jesus Christ steps out to fulfill
[48:12] that scripture
[48:15] I created that God it was in the heart
[48:18] of God that God would do that when he
[48:20] was in the form as a man
[48:23] you're doing it
[48:26] and I'm not saying this to bring any
[48:28] kind of Glory to me it's the glory of
[48:30] God in Nicaragua a few years ago people
[48:33] still looking for miracles and signs and
[48:36] wonders they're happening in front of
[48:37] faces
[48:39] I don't know if there are for 100 people
[48:41] on a school ground opening our meeting
[48:43] and a storm came up pouring down rain
[48:47] I didn't know what to do brother Sandy
[48:48] Beach was interpreted for me and I
[48:51] looked and there was a flash of
[48:52] lightning and right after the flash of
[48:54] lightning I saw the pillar of fire go
[48:56] past just said speak storm go back to
[49:00] where you came from in the name of Jesus
[49:02] Christ three minutes later you could see
[49:04] the stars I can't do that
[49:08] but that Pillar of Fire can the image of
[49:11] God can and when the image of God came
[49:13] down to speak to those people
[49:16] the word of God he backs it up he will
[49:21] back it up in your life
[49:26] he's still doing it
[49:28] all the time
[49:32] wow I could go on and on with that stuff
[49:34] but it's Christ
[49:37] showing his Dominion in you and me
[49:41] you ever pray for something and God
[49:43] answer it
[49:45] I hope so
[49:48] that's God
[49:49] taken Dominion through your life
[49:53] as the Bride of Jesus Christ that is the
[49:56] seed word of God
[49:58] in you
[50:00] taking dominion over the situation
[50:06] I hope we get three visions I didn't
[50:08] read it yet so I don't have a
[50:11] I have to get there right
[50:13] see brother Paul
[50:17] but then we we read there from 21.
[50:21] and I never noticed this until just
[50:23] recently I mean I've read it probably a
[50:26] few hundred times
[50:27] it starts out there and Lord God caused
[50:29] a deep sleep to fall upon Adam
[50:32] and he slept
[50:33] and he took one of his ribs and closed
[50:35] up the flesh instead thereof who's that
[50:39] talking about
[50:41] come on
[50:43] who fell into a deep sleep and they
[50:46] opened up his side with the Roman spear
[50:51] and what did Brother Branham say flowed
[50:53] out the Bride of Jesus Christ that's
[50:56] Christ
[50:57] that is Christ in that verse showing us
[51:00] from the mind of God from the heart the
[51:03] soul of God I'm going to take a bride
[51:06] the same way
[51:08] I'm going to sleep they'll take it out
[51:11] of my side
[51:14] in this
[51:17] butterfail
[51:21] and then what happens
[51:23] well we know what happened that you know
[51:25] in a Calvary
[51:28] brother random said the entire debt was
[51:32] paid everything finished
[51:34] right there
[51:37] was asleep
[51:39] he doesn't know what's going on
[51:42] did he
[51:48] well
[51:49] and when he wakes up what's he got in
[51:52] front of you
[51:53] oh
[51:56] it's a woman
[51:59] it's a woman
[52:00] I have this woman
[52:02] in front of me
[52:04] and where did she come from
[52:06] bone of my bone
[52:09] Flesh of My Flesh
[52:12] what's behind this
[52:15] friends you go back to John the first
[52:17] chapter in the beginning was the word
[52:18] was with God I know you're familiar with
[52:21] these things
[52:22] I'm trying to go fast because there is
[52:24] so much I just want to explode
[52:27] praise the Lord
[52:29] and when you drop down to 14 between
[52:32] those first few verses of John
[52:35] and he and it says he was the word and
[52:37] what's the next part and Elijah Ministry
[52:41] and right after that Elijah Ministry
[52:43] what do you see it the word became flesh
[52:46] oh come on Friends
[52:49] the word of God came down he comes to
[52:52] Elijah prophet
[52:54] and after that the Revelation comes the
[52:57] word becomes flesh God is seeking your
[53:01] flesh My Flesh to Shell himself once
[53:04] again
[53:05] he is the word of God and he will have
[53:10] flesh
[53:12] in his likeness
[53:15] Dominion
[53:17] to provide Dominion
[53:20] through his bride that came where out of
[53:23] his side
[53:25] you love him tonight
[53:27] oh my
[53:30] what came
[53:32] Adam
[53:34] gets the revelation
[53:37] I got a woman here
[53:39] what was it
[53:41] Jesus
[53:44] when he's
[53:45] let's I'm a little
[53:48] praise the Lord let's go to John
[53:51] I think it's 17.
[53:58] 17 and 24.
[54:08] Lord Jesus
[54:16] now this is before Calvary we're aware
[54:19] of that
[54:20] and he's this is Jesus and he's praying
[54:24] and as he's praying
[54:26] he comes to this
[54:29] the reasons
[54:31] for why he's
[54:33] coming to this action in verse 23 he has
[54:36] a certain prayer that he makes
[54:39] and as he's making this prayer in verse
[54:43] 21 that they all may be one he was and
[54:45] that was
[54:46] a father Thou Art in me and I and thee
[54:48] and they also may be one in US
[54:53] in US
[54:56] where are we to be in Jesus Christ
[55:00] and he's saying this in his prayer and
[55:03] the glory which you give to me
[55:05] I have given that's past tense
[55:10] that they may be one even as we are
[55:14] how can he say that he hasn't had
[55:16] Calvary yet but he's been giving them my
[55:19] word is a seed and whosoever
[55:24] it's a seed
[55:26] we're talking about this the other night
[55:27] with somebody and there's all different
[55:30] kinds of seeds
[55:31] you take the hazelnuts from Oregon it
[55:35] grows so well over there
[55:36] they do well in really wet climates
[55:39] because that outside thing is so hard
[55:42] otherwise it takes years and years and
[55:45] years just to break down the outside so
[55:48] the seed can be come forth even Tomatoes
[55:52] you all like tomatoes I like tomatoes
[55:55] those that little that gooey stuff on
[55:57] the seed
[55:59] they say that
[56:00] takes two years if you just drop one of
[56:02] those on the ground just for the gooey
[56:04] stuff to go away
[56:06] before the seed can even sprout
[56:09] so when he was back there saying those
[56:11] Parables and stuff
[56:13] he lays a parable about this
[56:16] the parable about that he's laying seeds
[56:19] in the ground front
[56:23] some of them will Sprout like that even
[56:26] to give a parable about that someone
[56:28] Sprout this way some will Sprout on the
[56:30] rock some will Sprout but some of them
[56:33] they really get it
[56:37] they take the seed of the good word of
[56:39] God and they bring forth 30 60 90 100
[56:42] fold
[56:46] and so it comes down to verse 24.
[56:50] and this father I will
[56:54] that they also whom that has given me be
[56:57] with me that where I am
[57:01] that they may behold my glory which thou
[57:04] has given me for thou loveth me before
[57:06] when
[57:07] did the love of God
[57:09] come on to Jesus Christ I can I can if
[57:12] Paul does this I can do this right
[57:16] give me where where that where I am
[57:20] they can behold my glory
[57:22] which was given to me when before the
[57:25] foundation of the world
[57:27] before the foundation of the world
[57:31] God saw his image
[57:34] in Dominion
[57:37] body or you know only this time that's a
[57:41] reverse order from the soul from the
[57:43] heart that believes the word it moves
[57:46] into the spirit of a man
[57:49] brother Bennett said
[57:51] you know you people that used to go to
[57:52] the bar or to whatever you used to do
[57:55] and you're not doing it anymore he said
[57:57] that's a sign of Resurrection already
[57:59] lives in you
[58:01] it's already there
[58:04] recognize it
[58:06] it's already there
[58:09] it's built there before the foundation
[58:11] of the world by the seed word of God and
[58:14] it's going to bring forth it has to
[58:17] bring forth
[58:18] before the foundation of will but I
[58:20] wanted to look at that word will I will
[58:24] oh my
[58:26] God I brought this out of there's two
[58:28] three three different definitions that I
[58:31] found this in there's of course the
[58:33] different concordances they are strongs
[58:36] and whatever
[58:37] this other stuff I have
[58:39] this one around a long time but I ran
[58:42] across it again last night
[58:44] where he says I will well who's the eye
[58:46] it's Jesus Christ we know that
[58:49] but when he said I will
[58:51] what he's saying is I mind to or I want
[58:54] to it's my intention I am resolved
[58:56] determined
[58:59] or it's going to become my purpose
[59:02] and then you'd start you know BCD how
[59:04] the dictionaries do it's my desire It's
[59:07] My Wish
[59:09] it's my love
[59:12] I would love to do this or I like to do
[59:15] it
[59:16] not time to go to it tonight but love is
[59:18] a commitment
[59:20] that's why when we say till death do us
[59:22] part he means it
[59:25] it's a commitment
[59:27] and so it says I when he says I will
[59:30] it's my love
[59:32] it's
[59:33] well John 3 16. God so loved and now we
[59:39] see the love of God projecting itself
[59:41] through that little word I
[59:43] Jesus Christ
[59:46] now this all of a sudden here we see God
[59:50] fulfilling his own word now in a quick
[59:53] time frame
[59:54] because we just jumped you know a few
[59:57] chapters and we see the I will
[1:00:00] and it also means to take pleasure in
[1:00:04] to take pleasure in when he said I will
[1:00:08] he's doing this out of the love of God
[1:00:12] to have pleasure spiritual pleasure with
[1:00:15] a bride that he knew before the
[1:00:17] foundation of the world who are tonight
[1:00:22] I hope you're understanding trying to
[1:00:25] sow some seeds friends of who you are
[1:00:28] there's tons of scriptures we could go
[1:00:31] through
[1:00:33] but
[1:00:35] let the seed of God come into you and
[1:00:37] believe these things what he said about
[1:00:40] you in the strongs that says determine
[1:00:43] or to choose amen he said you didn't
[1:00:46] choose me I chose you Jesus Christ chose
[1:00:50] you
[1:00:53] we were just lucky enough and have
[1:00:55] enough Grace to say Thank you Lord
[1:00:57] you chugged me
[1:01:00] you Cho you chose me
[1:01:02] he chose me
[1:01:05] by his grace
[1:01:08] and again we see it uh desire intends to
[1:01:13] love comes up again in that other
[1:01:14] translation
[1:01:16] to be pleased with to do it willingly
[1:01:20] to take for oneself and when you start
[1:01:23] getting into the root words to take for
[1:01:25] oneself to choose or elect to an office
[1:01:28] I'm just quickly going through these
[1:01:31] he elected you
[1:01:34] he chose you
[1:01:35] he chose me
[1:01:37] to be the Bride of Jesus Christ he chose
[1:01:41] us
[1:01:42] and from the the third translation there
[1:01:44] in the root there it says to to raise up
[1:01:47] Elevate or to lift up
[1:01:50] to raise up the ground and I love the
[1:01:53] last one it said to take up stones
[1:02:00] Jesus Christ in every scripture friends
[1:02:04] this is a reality what was the
[1:02:08] what was the the penalty for adultery
[1:02:13] pick up stones
[1:02:16] to kill them
[1:02:17] and then to burn them with fire
[1:02:21] kill them
[1:02:26] pick up stones
[1:02:28] and kill them
[1:02:29] and burn them with fire
[1:02:32] the Bible says that Jesus Christ became
[1:02:34] sin
[1:02:35] for you and me
[1:02:37] he took the full Judgment of God against
[1:02:42] adultery by a revelation from God that
[1:02:46] he was the one that's supposed to do it
[1:02:48] take this body down I'll bring it back
[1:02:51] he knew what was going to happen and
[1:02:53] even the burden with fire the Bible said
[1:02:55] he went to hell I just read it today and
[1:02:57] he was at first Peter
[1:02:59] said he went to hell and preached to the
[1:03:01] souls in prison
[1:03:03] he took the full judgment
[1:03:06] of adultery why is that so important
[1:03:09] why is it so important we could again
[1:03:13] back to the scripture
[1:03:15] who do we got back here here's a man
[1:03:16] called David
[1:03:18] we find and I think it's in the book of
[1:03:19] Acts as he was the man after God's Own
[1:03:21] Heart
[1:03:22] he wants the very heart of God
[1:03:25] to be in him he wants to have God's
[1:03:28] heart
[1:03:30] in him
[1:03:32] okay
[1:03:33] and when the word of Prophecy came to
[1:03:36] Samuel
[1:03:37] he says Sam you know why why are you
[1:03:39] crying over Paul uh Saul for
[1:03:42] why I I'm tired of that guy
[1:03:45] you know in modern terms
[1:03:47] I'm tired of him he don't he didn't have
[1:03:50] it in him
[1:03:51] now he was the People's Choice
[1:03:55] but God says go anoint me
[1:03:57] a king
[1:03:59] God is going to provide himself as a
[1:04:02] king any Shepherd boy
[1:04:05] Conway Mia King
[1:04:07] I'm gonna be king
[1:04:09] yeah he's a little Shepherd boy I know
[1:04:11] no they didn't want him at the you know
[1:04:12] at the feast
[1:04:15] there man isn't there he I'm thinking
[1:04:18] Sammy was probably having a trial one
[1:04:21] two three four five six seven
[1:04:24] he's got that cruso oil going lower
[1:04:28] I know you told me to come down here and
[1:04:30] anoint somebody
[1:04:33] don't you have one more
[1:04:36] oh man yeah we got one more it's out
[1:04:39] with the sheep and here he comes you
[1:04:42] ever smelled sheep especially during
[1:04:43] breeding or you know birthing season
[1:04:47] it's pretty tough so well Paul's a
[1:04:50] farmer he can probably tell you
[1:04:52] it's not a pretty thing those birthing
[1:04:54] sheds and stuff
[1:04:56] and here he comes you're right there
[1:04:58] into the walks into the room and that's
[1:05:01] the one that's me
[1:05:04] God gonna provide himself as a king
[1:05:07] in flesh
[1:05:10] what did we see
[1:05:11] a Shepherd boy goes out the next day
[1:05:15] here's his army all these scrubby little
[1:05:18] white looking things
[1:05:20] with this with his staff
[1:05:22] here's your king Israel
[1:05:26] God
[1:05:27] showing the simplicity
[1:05:30] of he's going to be born in a manger
[1:05:33] and who's going to see the birth
[1:05:35] there were shepherds in the same country
[1:05:38] keeping watch over their flock by night
[1:05:41] and God's the shepherd boy
[1:05:45] to catch the anointing
[1:05:47] but what really was important was the
[1:05:51] word
[1:05:52] that told him
[1:05:54] you're the next king
[1:05:56] and that word propelled him
[1:05:59] into Chronicles where it says Israel and
[1:06:02] Judah came together and asked David will
[1:06:05] you be our King and it says they
[1:06:08] anointed him King over Israel
[1:06:11] no the child's doing three oh man
[1:06:14] we're talking about the sin of adultery
[1:06:16] David did that
[1:06:19] and did you ever really think about when
[1:06:21] the prophet comes to him and he what's
[1:06:23] the story he tells him it's about sheep
[1:06:26] is David knew sheep
[1:06:29] and he knew how important they were they
[1:06:32] were so important to Bartimaeus they
[1:06:33] were his eyes because they didn't have
[1:06:36] seen High dogs back then they ate the
[1:06:38] dogs
[1:06:40] seriously
[1:06:41] they did
[1:06:43] and so
[1:06:45] they say that Bartimaeus
[1:06:47] sacrificed his eyes
[1:06:50] the night before he met Jesus
[1:06:54] and Jesus said what would you like and
[1:06:57] he said I want my eyes
[1:07:01] Jesus Oh my God
[1:07:06] well David Shepherd he hears the story
[1:07:11] brother Branham said it showed that
[1:07:12] David still had
[1:07:14] a good spirit or heart about him I can't
[1:07:17] remember exactly how he said it because
[1:07:18] he gave the proper judgment he said that
[1:07:21] man ought to die
[1:07:24] that man should die
[1:07:27] he knew what it was talking about
[1:07:31] about
[1:07:33] and did you ever notice what the prophet
[1:07:36] said
[1:07:37] okay now it's not just well I think it
[1:07:40] was Nathan right is that right was it
[1:07:42] Nathan a prophet in this Prophet looks
[1:07:45] at David
[1:07:46] and what's he say David pronounces his
[1:07:48] own judgment proper judgment the man
[1:07:51] should die and Nathan says Thou shalt
[1:07:53] not surely die
[1:07:55] he used the exact same words the circle
[1:07:59] is done Eve
[1:08:03] and this time
[1:08:05] there was life in those words
[1:08:08] because this time it wasn't words of
[1:08:10] Lies
[1:08:11] it was the words of God
[1:08:13] coming through a prophet you'll not
[1:08:15] surely die
[1:08:19] well we know David went through a lot of
[1:08:21] problems
[1:08:22] because of that but what was it all
[1:08:25] about it was about John 17 24 I will and
[1:08:31] he's doing it for the bride because he
[1:08:33] says in that whole passage there that
[1:08:35] where I am they may be also
[1:08:38] that's his desire
[1:08:40] that's his love
[1:08:42] that where he is we're there
[1:08:46] he willed it he loved us
[1:08:51] he loved us to the point
[1:08:55] to where he gave himself
[1:08:57] to go to sleep to have a bride out of
[1:08:59] his side
[1:09:00] it's Christ in every word I wish I could
[1:09:04] find him more places he's everywhere I
[1:09:06] look
[1:09:07] preach Christ
[1:09:09] I just mean not to rebuke preachers but
[1:09:12] brother Branham said we're not getting
[1:09:14] him through to Christ and he's the word
[1:09:16] he's in the
[1:09:21] endic pages
[1:09:23] and he can live in you
[1:09:25] by the Holy Ghost
[1:09:28] just receive him receive the word of God
[1:09:32] brother sister get through to Christ
[1:09:35] he's the word and when he says I will
[1:09:37] there's something else there about David
[1:09:40] that you know we don't I we tend not to
[1:09:43] think about
[1:09:44] oh wow David was spared
[1:09:47] sure glad that happened right
[1:09:50] there was something else
[1:09:53] what else was involved there
[1:09:57] the woman
[1:09:59] should have all been it's also been
[1:10:00] stoned and burnt with fire
[1:10:05] and God was protecting that woman
[1:10:10] because 600 years later
[1:10:13] so and so begat so and so
[1:10:17] and Jesus Christ
[1:10:19] God was anointing himself as king
[1:10:24] through that act to save that woman
[1:10:29] an adulteress
[1:10:33] Modern Eyes of God not the second seed
[1:10:36] that she bore the first one died
[1:10:38] because she was
[1:10:41] her husband was still alive but when the
[1:10:44] first husband died
[1:10:47] she could bring forth
[1:10:49] and she brought forth the lineage
[1:10:51] leading us to Jesus Christ where God
[1:10:54] himself is anointed king of kings and
[1:10:58] Lord Arts
[1:11:02] you love him
[1:11:04] I love him
[1:11:07] another little just to close on that
[1:11:09] definition
[1:11:12] part of that to lift up
[1:11:15] you know to raise up or to take up
[1:11:17] stones
[1:11:19] foreign
[1:11:21] I will
[1:11:23] I will and it's love and to take up
[1:11:26] Stones what's so what's another thing
[1:11:28] he's talking about we're talking about
[1:11:29] Jesus Christ in all the scriptures God
[1:11:32] creating Jesus Christ and he's creating
[1:11:35] Jesus Christ in flesh right now in you
[1:11:38] and I If you're receiving him that's who
[1:11:41] he is the word of God
[1:11:42] it's happening right now
[1:11:45] might only be one cell tonight I don't
[1:11:47] know there's billions of them in these
[1:11:49] bodies
[1:11:50] but if you get one cell closer to Jesus
[1:11:53] Christ tonight I'm happy
[1:11:57] Isaiah said it pretty well line upon
[1:11:59] line line up online
[1:12:01] precept
[1:12:02] up on precept and if you can catch the
[1:12:04] precept tonight every word of this book
[1:12:07] carries Jesus Christ in it somehow I'll
[1:12:10] leave it up to you other brothers to
[1:12:13] dig out some more
[1:12:15] because Jesus when Peter and I know
[1:12:18] you're familiar with this Peter who do
[1:12:20] men say that I am well some think you're
[1:12:22] John the Baptist raised from the dead
[1:12:24] maybe one of the prophets maybe it's
[1:12:26] just like the message today
[1:12:28] might be in Jeffersonville might be who
[1:12:31] knows maybe it's with his brother so and
[1:12:32] so it's this church or that church or do
[1:12:34] you stream there would you ask somebody
[1:12:37] you get on you know wait how message
[1:12:39] people when you ask them
[1:12:41] you know are you Christian
[1:12:43] what's one of the first things they say
[1:12:44] where do you go to church
[1:12:47] I don't care where you go to church
[1:12:48] praise God I'm glad you're here tonight
[1:12:52] what good it would be well I've preached
[1:12:54] empty churches before I really have a
[1:12:55] couple times
[1:12:57] it's kind of boring for a preacher then
[1:13:00] I found out there was a Mormon guy
[1:13:01] standing out the wind outside the window
[1:13:03] listening
[1:13:04] I didn't even know he was there
[1:13:07] but God had me preach 15 20 minutes
[1:13:11] to posts so that a Mormon guy could hear
[1:13:14] about Jesus Christ
[1:13:18] never doubt the Holy Ghost
[1:13:22] and
[1:13:23] it also means to raise up oh we're
[1:13:26] talking about Peter and but who do you
[1:13:28] say that I am and I ask that question
[1:13:30] often who do you say that he is
[1:13:33] who do you say that he is because that's
[1:13:35] what's really important
[1:13:37] who do you say that he is I say he's the
[1:13:41] Christ the son of the Living God he's
[1:13:43] the word of God he's my everything he's
[1:13:44] my all
[1:13:46] what else is there
[1:13:48] that's what nothing he said in another
[1:13:50] place are you guys are going to go too
[1:13:51] where else are we gonna go
[1:13:54] where else can I go
[1:13:58] you are the words of eternal life
[1:14:02] and but Jesus said you know Peter I'm
[1:14:05] going to call you a rock now Simon
[1:14:08] and on this Revelation you know Flesh
[1:14:11] and Blood did not reveal this to you it
[1:14:13] was a revelation brother Brian taught us
[1:14:14] this you know I know you're aware of
[1:14:16] this and how did it's not a rock there
[1:14:19] it's not Peter it's the Revelation that
[1:14:22] thou art the Christ the son of the
[1:14:24] Living God
[1:14:25] it's the Revelation brother Brandon said
[1:14:28] you need we need to pray for Revelation
[1:14:29] more than you could possibly imagine
[1:14:34] because
[1:14:36] when
[1:14:38] and he said on this Stone you know not
[1:14:40] even the gates of hell you know brother
[1:14:42] Paul was telling us about the gates
[1:14:45] been there seen it it's all those
[1:14:47] different religions not one of them
[1:14:50] can Prevail against
[1:14:52] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:14:57] and he said on this Stone I'll build my
[1:14:58] church on this Stone
[1:15:02] on the Revelation that Jesus Christ is
[1:15:05] the word of God he's building his church
[1:15:09] right now
[1:15:12] he is receiving you unto him as you
[1:15:15] receive him and you are becoming like
[1:15:17] him and we are being placed into the
[1:15:20] very image of God so that God can have
[1:15:23] your flesh
[1:15:25] to use what was part of that prayer in
[1:15:28] John that they might behold my glory
[1:15:31] and when you pray and God answers he
[1:15:35] gets Glory out of that
[1:15:37] when we see a miracle a storm go away
[1:15:40] whatever it is
[1:15:43] even the weather warm up a few degrees
[1:15:44] oh God I'm freezing to death can you
[1:15:47] just warm it up a little bit
[1:15:49] gee whiz the weather departments it was
[1:15:52] going to be like 12. and wound up 25.
[1:15:57] I know it seems foolish but it works
[1:16:01] not because I can do it but I can ask
[1:16:04] he said you ask
[1:16:07] just don't ask different stuff okay or
[1:16:09] we'll get it all mixed up
[1:16:12] it's got to be in one mind and one one
[1:16:15] Accord right
[1:16:17] so
[1:16:19] praise the Lord
[1:16:21] the last part of that definition is to
[1:16:23] lift up or take away or to raise the
[1:16:27] voice
[1:16:29] who was the last voice in this age well
[1:16:31] it was we think of it as being the
[1:16:34] prophet of God no it wasn't
[1:16:36] it was the message of the hour it was
[1:16:38] Jesus Christ in a prophet
[1:16:41] where's that voice supposed to be living
[1:16:43] right now
[1:16:44] praise the Lord look at those hands
[1:16:46] praise God
[1:16:49] you are the final voice friends
[1:16:53] and he's going to raise the voice
[1:16:56] whose voices are you going to use
[1:17:00] we talk about rapture we call it Rapture
[1:17:02] I've never seen that word is it in the
[1:17:04] scripture you ever seen it I don't think
[1:17:06] it's there
[1:17:08] not that word
[1:17:10] body changes
[1:17:12] a moment twinkling eye those things
[1:17:15] quickening power is
[1:17:18] and when Jesus went to the tomb of
[1:17:20] Lazarus
[1:17:21] she had great Doctrine
[1:17:24] your brother shall rise again that was a
[1:17:26] prophecy from the voice of God
[1:17:28] your brother shall rise again and she
[1:17:31] said yeah I know it Lord
[1:17:33] at the resurrection at the last day
[1:17:37] Pharisee
[1:17:39] denominational spirit
[1:17:42] he's dead
[1:17:44] if you'd have been here back then
[1:17:47] he'd be alive
[1:17:49] and I know
[1:17:52] he's going to come up there
[1:17:54] Jesus said no no the word always
[1:17:57] corrects the error
[1:17:59] the word always corrects the error and
[1:18:02] brings us back to Jesus Christ he said I
[1:18:05] am
[1:18:06] the resurrection
[1:18:10] Aaron
[1:18:13] I'll bet her eyes went what
[1:18:15] Boeing
[1:18:18] and
[1:18:19] the life
[1:18:20] he that were dead
[1:18:22] and believeth in me yet shall he live
[1:18:24] and he that is alive and believeth shall
[1:18:28] never die and he asked her a question do
[1:18:30] you believe it that's what it hinges on
[1:18:32] Friends
[1:18:34] it's not way off in outer space
[1:18:36] somewhere the kingdom of God is within
[1:18:38] you and the last voice of this age is in
[1:18:41] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:18:43] who are we
[1:18:47] speak
[1:18:49] God spoke and brought forth Man In His
[1:18:52] Image and that image is to be the word
[1:18:56] of God and that word is to become flesh
[1:18:59] again and he wants to raise up the
[1:19:01] stones what are the stones Peter on the
[1:19:05] your rock
[1:19:07] and I'm going to build my church
[1:19:09] on that rock of Revelation
[1:19:13] I'm just I'm just telling you scripture
[1:19:15] hey feel free to correct me brothers
[1:19:17] sisters
[1:19:21] but I'm telling you what this word says
[1:19:25] okay what time are we looking at oh man
[1:19:31] Ephesians I mentioned that we'll close
[1:19:34] with Ephesians there's a lot of more
[1:19:36] stuff We're not gonna get too praise the
[1:19:38] Lord that's
[1:19:40] I hope you go home and look this stuff
[1:19:41] up
[1:19:44] I got into Ephesians recently
[1:19:49] because
[1:19:52] brother random said Ephesians parallels
[1:19:55] Joshua I believe it's in the adoption
[1:19:57] series I hear some amens on that praise
[1:20:00] the Lord so let's look at the first
[1:20:03] chapter
[1:20:07] we started out this message with in the
[1:20:10] beginning God created
[1:20:12] so the very personality of God is to
[1:20:15] create things
[1:20:17] and he creates things by Jesus Christ
[1:20:20] who is the word of God
[1:20:22] and
[1:20:24] you know that
[1:20:26] Joshua dealt with the children of Israel
[1:20:30] and Joshua
[1:20:32] you know when brother Brown says
[1:20:33] Ephesian parallels Joshua so that means
[1:20:37] it's run side by side
[1:20:39] Joshua was for them Ephesians
[1:20:43] who's it written by
[1:20:45] First Church age Messenger to the
[1:20:48] Gentiles or the alpha revelation
[1:20:53] okay I understand that right so in
[1:20:57] Joshua what was the point they had been
[1:20:59] living the law
[1:21:02] under the words of Moses
[1:21:05] and it had been Moses's voice had pretty
[1:21:07] much been in control of everything
[1:21:09] because God told him
[1:21:11] you go down to deliver the people I'm
[1:21:13] gonna be there whatever you say is going
[1:21:16] to happen Red Sea split Red Sea splits
[1:21:19] he said you already spoke it why are you
[1:21:21] crying to me
[1:21:23] you say water to blood there's the blood
[1:21:26] you say Locus there's locusts or
[1:21:29] whatever
[1:21:30] bugs whatever they were and
[1:21:34] so that was in control but all of a
[1:21:36] sudden now
[1:21:38] Moses my servant is dead
[1:21:41] a person dies what happens to their
[1:21:43] voice
[1:21:45] and I'm not saying get rid of the
[1:21:46] message that's not the point here not at
[1:21:49] all
[1:21:50] I'm saying that message has moved
[1:21:53] brother random said Joshua it's a type
[1:21:55] of shadow of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:57] and if that message is not living In You
[1:21:59] and I
[1:22:00] it don't matter how much how dry that
[1:22:03] Jordan River is you're not going to be
[1:22:05] there
[1:22:06] where you know
[1:22:08] we have to become the voice of God to
[1:22:12] this last day
[1:22:14] not because we're
[1:22:16] claiming something different than what
[1:22:18] Moses told us because he said no you got
[1:22:20] to do what Moses told you
[1:22:23] the Joshua this time you speak
[1:22:27] you speak Joshua
[1:22:30] and what was that it was the Crossing
[1:22:33] from the law
[1:22:34] and to Total Grace
[1:22:38] I gave you the land
[1:22:40] Joshua believed that 40 years before
[1:22:42] that because him and Caleb were the only
[1:22:44] two when everybody else said oh we can't
[1:22:45] go we're grasshoppers please no
[1:22:47] grasshoppers here tonight
[1:22:51] but
[1:22:52] Joshua and Caleb said no let us go up at
[1:22:55] once he has given us the land past tense
[1:23:00] it's already ours God made him wait 40
[1:23:02] years
[1:23:04] 40 years and he had to watch all them
[1:23:07] other people die
[1:23:08] that's the Joshua part now what about as
[1:23:11] we close
[1:23:13] Ephesians
[1:23:14] Paul First Church age messenger Apostle
[1:23:17] Foundation person right
[1:23:20] Foundation is to be Apostles and
[1:23:21] Prophets so on
[1:23:23] Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of
[1:23:26] God there's that word again will of God
[1:23:30] to the Saints which are at Ephesus
[1:23:33] which the first church page we know that
[1:23:36] but it goes to somebody else too and to
[1:23:38] the faithful in Jesus Christ
[1:23:41] that's me
[1:23:43] is that you tonight
[1:23:46] are we the I believe you are
[1:23:48] I wouldn't be preaching this kind of a
[1:23:50] message here we'd be preaching salvation
[1:23:54] you're the faithful in Jesus Christ so
[1:23:56] this book is for you
[1:23:59] it's for me it's for everyone who wants
[1:24:03] to cross into another land
[1:24:06] next thing he says grace to you and
[1:24:08] peace from God our Father from the Lord
[1:24:10] Jesus Christ when he says Grace be unto
[1:24:12] you
[1:24:13] and peace
[1:24:16] isn't an interesting Jesus said I give
[1:24:19] you peace which in a way the world is
[1:24:22] going to know what this is
[1:24:24] but he says Grace
[1:24:26] I give you Grace
[1:24:28] and we may have to stop here because I
[1:24:30] really don't want to keep you late I
[1:24:32] know it's tough you guys are working and
[1:24:34] stuff and
[1:24:35] but I want to give you the
[1:24:38] I took this one I didn't check this word
[1:24:41] here to be make sure it's the same you
[1:24:43] know letters or numbers that they have
[1:24:44] but Grace when it comes in verse chapter
[1:24:47] 4 verse 7.
[1:24:51] let me read it so you understand where
[1:24:53] I'm getting but unto every one of us is
[1:24:55] given Grace according to the measure of
[1:24:57] the gift of Christ okay here he says I
[1:25:00] give grace to you and peace
[1:25:03] he's speaking it into existence
[1:25:07] it's there but you gotta fight for it
[1:25:11] it's there
[1:25:13] there's a kingdom there but we got to
[1:25:15] fight for it there's a kingdom of Grace
[1:25:18] there's a kingdom of peace
[1:25:20] because in the beginning God created
[1:25:24] and there's creative power behind every
[1:25:27] single word
[1:25:28] if it created Jesus Christ
[1:25:33] Behold a virgin shall conceive did she
[1:25:35] conceive you bet she did what was it God
[1:25:38] creating by the word
[1:25:40] a virgins 400 years later whatever it
[1:25:43] was
[1:25:44] to conceive
[1:25:46] and you could go scripture after
[1:25:48] scripture after scripture and they all
[1:25:50] point us to Jesus Christ
[1:25:53] God creating the beginning of the
[1:25:55] creation of God and we were in him
[1:26:01] while he was asleep
[1:26:03] and when he wakes up then the Revelation
[1:26:05] starts
[1:26:07] hey I have a bride
[1:26:11] I died and I
[1:26:14] went to this prison and and here I've
[1:26:16] got a bride now
[1:26:19] she's a woman brother Brandon said she's
[1:26:21] a glorious perfect woman
[1:26:26] right of Jesus Christ and the word Grace
[1:26:28] there okay
[1:26:30] god-given her god-gifted or committed
[1:26:33] brother Branham said the strongest thing
[1:26:35] you can do as a Christian is commit
[1:26:36] something to God that means you lay it
[1:26:38] on the altar so that's it I'm going to
[1:26:40] walk away and wait and see what you do
[1:26:41] with it Lord
[1:26:43] might not hurt to look over your
[1:26:44] shoulders sometimes just to see what's
[1:26:46] happening I have a hit tendency probably
[1:26:48] to do that too much but it's a
[1:26:51] commitment
[1:26:52] you lay it on the altar say Lord here it
[1:26:56] is I commit my children to you I commit
[1:27:00] my disease or this disease or this
[1:27:03] person or my job or whatever it is
[1:27:06] you commit it to God and the last part
[1:27:09] of that where it says Grace
[1:27:15] Joy
[1:27:17] pleasure
[1:27:19] loveliness
[1:27:23] sweetness
[1:27:26] and if you want to break it all the way
[1:27:27] down
[1:27:29] it says to Rejoice to be glad it's a
[1:27:33] greeting it's cheerful God bless you
[1:27:38] that's Grace
[1:27:40] do you love him
[1:27:42] his joy unspeakable and full of Glory
[1:27:46] sister go ahead and come maybe we'll see
[1:27:48] that here in a minute
[1:27:49] if you're there I'm we'll have to quit
[1:27:54] joy unspeakable
[1:27:56] it's Joy and there's that word pleasure
[1:28:00] again
[1:28:04] Revelations 4
[1:28:07] sure that's what it is
[1:28:13] let me double check
[1:28:15] four and eleven we'll read that and then
[1:28:17] finish
[1:28:26] 4 11. Thou Art Worthy O Lord to receive
[1:28:30] glory and honor and power for thou Hast
[1:28:33] created all things
[1:28:35] who created all things Jesus Christ this
[1:28:39] is the revelation of Jesus Christ that
[1:28:41] says in line one of the Book of
[1:28:42] Revelations it's his Revelation and he's
[1:28:46] speaking it so we can receive him
[1:28:49] so we can receive it in the last part it
[1:28:51] says and for thy pleasure they are and
[1:28:53] were created
[1:28:56] and that comes through Grace
[1:28:58] the grace of God shadow bar Upon Our
[1:29:03] Hearts and when you're breaking into the
[1:29:04] next level
[1:29:06] it says to be well
[1:29:08] it's a farewell
[1:29:10] and it's also a greeting
[1:29:13] when
[1:29:15] this
[1:29:18] I think I'm pulling out the wrong one I
[1:29:20] am
[1:29:22] uh well it'll work
[1:29:26] you all are familiar with
[1:29:34] this picture right
[1:29:37] where did that picture originate
[1:29:44] go ahead sister
[1:29:46] yeah but what state did it
[1:29:49] what's the
[1:29:52] letters that we put on the mailbox if
[1:29:55] you're sending something to Arizona
[1:29:58] hmm
[1:30:00] do you think it was a greeting
[1:30:05] because the prophet said you got to turn
[1:30:06] it this way
[1:30:09] isn't it interesting even the the
[1:30:12] article Christ on Sunset Mountain
[1:30:15] but you know when brother Branham came
[1:30:17] out and preached it just after that
[1:30:18] because we were all asleep
[1:30:21] he said
[1:30:23] if you turn it this way
[1:30:25] it's the rising of the sun it's a
[1:30:29] greeting
[1:30:31] and it's hurt by and it's also a
[1:30:34] greeting
[1:30:35] and I in one of these articles this has
[1:30:37] a bunch of the articles in it that were
[1:30:39] written in the different magazines
[1:30:42] and I believe they said the last place
[1:30:44] that was seen was over
[1:30:46] the state of Hawaii what's the
[1:30:48] significance
[1:30:50] could it be that the fact it was the
[1:30:52] 50th state
[1:30:54] and 50s of Jubilee
[1:30:57] and that they have this strange greeting
[1:30:59] aloha
[1:31:02] you know what it means hello
[1:31:05] you know what else it means bye-bye
[1:31:12] where we live in France
[1:31:14] foreign
[1:31:16] Grace and it's all Grace and it's all in
[1:31:20] that word grace
[1:31:23] I'll quit
[1:31:25] I have found God give me a key sister
[1:31:28] I'm getting horse
[1:31:31] I have found his Graces all complete he
[1:31:36] supplies everything

[1:31:46] free yes free indeed it is joy
[1:31:51] unspeakable and full of Glory
[1:31:56] [Music]
[1:32:03] and the help has never yet been cold I
[1:32:08] have found the pleasure I once craved is
[1:32:13] joy and peace within where's it at
[1:32:18] wondrous blessing I am safe from that
[1:32:23] awful guilt of sin
[1:32:26] I am joy unspeakable full of Glory Full
[1:32:32] Of Glory Full Glory it is
[1:32:42] never yet been told I have found that
[1:32:47] hope so bright and clear living in the
[1:32:52] Realms of Grace face
[1:32:56] his presence is right here I can see his
[1:33:01] smiling
[1:33:04] Joy
[1:33:06] Joy
[1:33:07] Of Glory Full Of Glory Full Glory it is
[1:33:14] Joy speakable and full of glory and the
[1:33:18] help has never yet been told
[1:33:22] I have found the joy no tongue can tell
[1:33:27] how it waves up Glory rolls hope it is
[1:33:33] great A great or flowing well stringing
[1:33:37] up within my soul what stand it is Joy
[1:33:42] speakable and full Glory Full Of Glory
[1:33:48] Full Glory it is joy unspeakable
[1:33:54] glory and
[1:33:56] has never yet been told one more time it
[1:34:00] is Joy speakable and full of Glory Full
[1:34:06] Of Glory for Glory it is joy unspeakable
[1:34:11] and full
[1:34:13] glory and the half never yet been told
[1:34:23] him tonight
[1:34:25] if you don't get nothing else and I say
[1:34:27] this often
[1:34:29] out of a service
[1:34:32] fall desperately in love with Jesus
[1:34:34] Christ he is this word
[1:34:37] somehow somewhere pray that these other
[1:34:40] brothers they will find Jesus Christ for
[1:34:43] you in these words they are ministers
[1:34:47] and they have the Bible calls them
[1:34:50] flaming
[1:34:51] flaming angels
[1:34:55] and what's that fire
[1:34:58] and you know if you have this Grace
[1:35:00] unspeakable I never thought of it
[1:35:03] but you know what's in that seventh seal
[1:35:09] there's things you can't even speak
[1:35:12] the thing that amazes me too is how God
[1:35:15] with paradoxes how he does things so
[1:35:18] there's a place I was reading
[1:35:21] I don't even remember because I A lot of
[1:35:23] times I'll skip from different tapes or
[1:35:26] I'll start one and forget where I was at
[1:35:28] and start a different winner or else
[1:35:30] even same thing with scriptures
[1:35:32] that I believe is brother Brandon saying
[1:35:34] you know what's interesting about it is
[1:35:36] that it's when you're at that lowest
[1:35:38] point
[1:35:40] and you're going through all the fiery
[1:35:42] trials and the struggles
[1:35:44] that's when Grace appears
[1:35:47] and what's Grace
[1:35:52] it's Joy it's it's joy that no matter
[1:35:56] how bad the trial is friends
[1:35:59] I am a redeemed creature
[1:36:04] Jesus Christ through Grace
[1:36:08] wants to live in me
[1:36:11] he wants to live in you
[1:36:14] he loves you
[1:36:17] and he wants to give you Dominion
[1:36:21] over your prayers
[1:36:24] he will he's already done it he's just
[1:36:27] waiting for us to say hey can I can I
[1:36:29] take dominion over this
[1:36:32] you sure can as long as you can find a
[1:36:36] reasonable answer in here
