[37:09] just have
[37:10] just a couple quick things to say here
[37:13] let's not forget communion this
[37:15] afternoon at five o'clock and uh
[37:18] I know there'll be circumstances
[37:20] probably hinder some maybe from coming
[37:22] but let's do our very best amen just to
[37:26] fulfill the word of God what the what
[37:29] the word has spoken to us
[37:32] um
[37:33] want to uh just remind everyone hard
[37:36] decision for me to make but there'll be
[37:40] no Wednesday service
[37:41] and uh consequently we just
[37:45] ask the Lord to just give each one of
[37:47] you a blessing a Happy Thanksgiving
[37:49] amongst family celebrate that let's
[37:52] remember the real real reason we're
[37:54] thankful it's not for houses or lands or
[37:57] fine clothes but it's for his Precious
[38:01] Blood his love
[38:03] redeeming power amen that he has for us
[38:07] and so we just want to remember a
[38:10] Thanksgiving Day brother Trevor sister
[38:12] Kerry will be enjoying the fine
[38:15] amenities of El Al so let's just lift
[38:19] them up in prayer we're happy to have
[38:21] our sister Elisa to come down to visit
[38:24] and say hi or not buy we don't have
[38:28] goodbyes but you know uh might be a
[38:31] little while before she gets to see her
[38:33] her dear friend sister Emmy again so
[38:36] glad to come and and sister Alice and
[38:38] sister Andrea uh you know uh we don't
[38:42] save pews but we could make arrangements
[38:46] to uh you know just happy always happy I
[38:50] enjoy their Fellowship so much and so
[38:54] um
[38:56] brother Jason's dad and mom uh didn't
[38:59] make it here this morning no doubt just
[39:01] spending that time with family but uh we
[39:04] love our brother Gill sister Karen find
[39:07] a Affinity with them and so let's just
[39:10] always remember to lift one another up
[39:13] in prayer and let's always just
[39:18] look on the bright side Saints
[39:21] we have so much
[39:24] to be thankful for
[39:27] we come into this Thanksgiving season
[39:29] which a nation then pours out all kinds
[39:32] of decorations and efforts and you know
[39:36] it's good the world says it it goes back
[39:39] uh you know the United States I should
[39:42] say it goes back to to to
[39:44] uh Plymouth Rock and the pilgrims and
[39:48] all of this but our Thanksgiving goes
[39:52] back even before go golf a hill
[39:57] even before
[39:58] man understood
[40:01] it goes from the foundation of the world
[40:04] and the fact that we are in Christ and
[40:06] so blessed that the word has been opened
[40:09] to us let's let's be thankful all the
[40:12] Days of Our Lives now I want to put just
[40:15] a little bit of a disclaimer
[40:17] that no prior conversation no prior
[40:20] knowledge young adults but
[40:22] I just had went down uh in the basement
[40:26] just a few minutes ago and I
[40:29] had to because it's just my nature look
[40:32] around the corner and see what's on the
[40:34] young adults board there
[40:35] and I'm telling you it's not collusion
[40:39] it's not conspiracy
[40:41] it's Christ
[40:43] and uh so let's just stand and turn in
[40:45] our Bibles to II Timothy the first
[40:49] chapter verses 7 through 9 and
[40:53] um
[40:57] just kind of give me a little uh and
[41:00] give me just a I don't know a little
[41:01] spark I just was down there and you know
[41:04] I've never really tried to jump and
[41:06] click my heels since I've got older but
[41:09] I was just I looked on the board young
[41:11] people young adults and I was just like
[41:13] praise the Lord
[41:15] and if any of you need to understand you
[41:18] can just go down after church and look
[41:20] on the board and you'll understand
[41:23] first or second Timothy 1 7-9
[41:31] for odd hath not given
[41:35] we've got to get our halves and
[41:37] haves-nots correct
[41:40] for God hath not given us the spirit of
[41:43] fear
[41:45] we can say Amen to that can't we
[41:49] but we need to also give equal Amen to
[41:52] the very next portion
[41:55] but of power
[41:58] he's given us power Saints not to just
[42:01] sit around and wonder what is happening
[42:03] but power as Sons and Daughters of God
[42:08] nowhere will you find
[42:10] the scripture declaring that we should
[42:12] back away
[42:14] from the word of God in any time shape
[42:16] form or fashion
[42:18] and sometimes that hurts
[42:21] sometimes it's just painful to face our
[42:25] reality
[42:26] but that's what God called us to do for
[42:29] God hath not given us the spirit of fear
[42:31] but of power and of love
[42:35] and of a sound mind
[42:39] be not thou therefore ashamed of the
[42:41] testimony of Our Lord
[42:43] nor of me his prisoner but be thou
[42:46] partaker of the afflictions of The
[42:49] Gospel According to the power of God
[42:53] verse 8 might be a tough one in the
[42:55] flesh
[42:56] to deal with
[42:58] but in the spirit it moves us into a
[43:01] whole different position who hath saved
[43:03] us
[43:06] sorry I'm breaking this down but I just
[43:07] want to make these points before we move
[43:09] on hath saved us past tense
[43:16] not when you get good enough I will save
[43:19] you
[43:20] he says I have already
[43:23] saved you
[43:27] and called us with a holy calling not
[43:30] according to our works
[43:34] come on Saints let's just face it we we
[43:36] just say well we don't believe in a
[43:38] Works gospel while we're working
[43:42] while we're trying to do everything we
[43:45] think God would be pleased with we're
[43:48] working
[43:50] because it's a nature that God has
[43:52] placed in US
[43:55] amen but there comes a time when our
[43:56] works always come short
[43:58] that we have to realize
[44:01] the rest of this verse
[44:03] not according to our works but according
[44:06] to his own purpose in other words he
[44:10] claimed ownership of this purpose
[44:16] and Grace which was given us in Christ
[44:19] Jesus before
[44:22] the world began
[44:24] now if we can ever recognize Saints we
[44:29] can never recognize and grasp this it
[44:31] will bring a peace in our life that we
[44:34] can move forward with confidence and
[44:37] faith and say Lord this path you set me
[44:40] on I have stumbled over every Rock and I
[44:44] have fallen in almost every Briar Patch
[44:47] but you said I would make it
[44:50] and I am going to believe that and I'm
[44:53] going to act upon that because I believe
[44:57] you were talking about me
[45:00] amen
[45:02] I got a little excited here I jumped
[45:05] right over the beginning of things here
[45:06] I want to speak to you today
[45:09] and our purpose revealed
[45:11] see God wouldn't give us purpose without
[45:14] showing us what the purpose was and how
[45:18] to fulfill it
[45:19] Heavenly Father we just ask you this
[45:21] morning Lord just to come down in our
[45:23] midst speak to our hearts and Lord just
[45:26] thank you Lord for your grace your mercy
[45:29] your kindness to us Lord that you would
[45:31] just continually woo us to you you're
[45:33] drawing us to you father and father it
[45:36] becomes alive in us and Lord so many
[45:39] thoughts so many things that we've
[45:41] studied so many scriptures and quotes
[45:43] Lord but I pray today Father you would
[45:45] just allow us the Lord to articulate
[45:47] what you desire to be spoken and we ask
[45:51] this in the name of our Lord and Savior
[45:53] Jesus Christ amen you may be seated amen
[46:00] Hallelujah
[46:05] you know God is good
[46:09] he is so good to us
[46:12] now
[46:14] sometimes we
[46:18] look in the world around us and we kind
[46:20] of wonder what is going on and
[46:23] making knives
[46:25] uh the influence is there are in the
[46:27] world today
[46:29] you know if you go and study this you'll
[46:32] find that this has been recognized even
[46:36] in the carnal world
[46:38] how influence or perception can be and
[46:41] this is why many times you'll see the
[46:44] pretty girl draped on the hood of the
[46:45] car because they have figured out that
[46:48] some sub such subtle messages are
[46:53] effective
[46:54] now those are obvious ones my brother
[46:56] and sister but Satan you see has come
[46:59] and recognized that he can give all
[47:01] kinds of subtle Direction subtle
[47:04] influence and we would say that uh you
[47:07] know we we really don't believe it
[47:09] affects us as Believers but you better
[47:12] believe that it affects you and we'll
[47:15] we'll touch on that a little bit more we
[47:18] are living
[47:19] uh in a Time increasingly that people
[47:23] specifically you'll see this amongst
[47:25] young people you will see this a young
[47:27] amongst young white males is one of the
[47:30] most predominant deals that they are
[47:33] going through life and will openly
[47:35] declare that they do not recognize any
[47:37] purpose for their life it is almost as
[47:40] though it is a disease that is spread in
[47:43] the minds of of people that they're
[47:46] going through life without any purpose
[47:48] they will they will voice questions like
[47:51] I don't even know why I am here what is
[47:54] the reason of my being and so as this
[47:58] goes we'll find that uh we'll see that
[48:01] there's always there's the prophet of
[48:02] God said every time that God is doing
[48:04] something Satan will come he's always a
[48:07] little behind right because he's not a
[48:10] Creator he's an impersonator he's the
[48:12] counterfeiter and so there has to be a
[48:15] real to be a counterfeit and the real
[48:16] comes out first but it's not long behind
[48:19] that that the counterfeit comes and so
[48:22] as God is coming in the hour we're
[48:24] living in and I trust that we as Saints
[48:27] of Grace can say Amen to this we see
[48:30] that God is focusing down to understand
[48:32] what our purpose is that why we're here
[48:35] and what we are facing and as God is
[48:38] bringing us into an increasing Focus my
[48:40] brother and sister Satan has come and
[48:43] he's loosing in the opposite to get the
[48:46] action and he's literally robbing the
[48:48] purpose or if there is purpose the
[48:51] purpose has been contaminated we'll find
[48:54] that it's one thing that we must work in
[48:56] the part of the the wages as it is is a
[48:59] reward for work and greed effect of that
[49:03] which one desires to accomplish or uh
[49:07] acquire more than is necessary more than
[49:10] is beneficial more than is is a blessing
[49:13] and so you know
[49:15] um it is there that Satan's coming he's
[49:17] trying to counter this and so God is
[49:20] coming in an hour the revealed word of
[49:22] the hour my brother and sister was not
[49:25] just to tell the world that Jesus is
[49:27] coming again we can read our Bible and
[49:29] get that but God said I'm going to come
[49:31] down and go right back into the
[49:33] beginning and restore every part of the
[49:36] word in its correct place so that we can
[49:39] understand that it's more than just
[49:40] Jesus Christ coming back for a people
[49:42] but he's coming back for a specific
[49:45] purpose and those people are not going
[49:48] to be now I'm not doing away with the
[49:50] 11th Hour worker but by and large my
[49:52] brother and sister God is choosing to
[49:55] use a people to fulfill his word and so
[49:59] God could do that he could use nature he
[50:01] could use trees or whatever and he does
[50:03] but God specifically chose us in His
[50:06] image to come and fulfill the word of
[50:09] God and we're living in a day whether
[50:12] they are Christian born in Christians
[50:14] home raised in in church or whatever
[50:16] there is an apathy that's coming upon
[50:18] the people uh kind of a lethargic
[50:21] reaction without Direction and you'll
[50:24] see this my brother and sister and the
[50:26] world we live in today and um it brings
[50:29] in such a nature such a fashion that
[50:32] people don't look out and have a vision
[50:35] for the future now the word of God says
[50:38] that to without a vision the people
[50:39] perish and we are Sons and Daughters of
[50:42] God are not just coming to church to
[50:44] check off a box on the calendar that we
[50:46] came to church today
[50:48] to be able to count up I went to church
[50:50] X number of times this last year that
[50:53] should be sufficient my brother and
[50:54] sister it's not of our works it's of his
[50:57] purpose
[50:57] and so it's there that God's purpose was
[51:00] not for us to check the box on the
[51:02] calendar
[51:03] but our purpose is to be revealed in the
[51:07] word of God so if we are in the word our
[51:10] purpose will be revealed to us see we
[51:14] cannot come and be in the will of God in
[51:17] the word of God without recognizing what
[51:20] our purpose is and so as we see this we
[51:25] see the nation heading the direction
[51:27] that it's hidden we see the nation
[51:29] coming manifesting certain things in the
[51:32] world we live in today we'll look at
[51:34] this and I have to say for myself and I
[51:37] believe that you would agree with me
[51:39] that if it weren't for the fact that God
[51:41] had opened our eyes to the direction to
[51:44] speaking specifically to the United
[51:46] States if God had not opened our eyes to
[51:49] the direction this nation must go we
[51:52] would be in as much mental turmoil as
[51:55] the rest of the world but we see that
[51:57] God's word being revealed has revealed
[52:00] there is a purpose behind this whole
[52:02] plan and in that we'll look and in 1956
[52:06] the prophet of God declared that year he
[52:08] said they'll either accept or reject
[52:10] Jesus Christ as a nation this year and
[52:14] my brother and sister I have done the
[52:16] research spent the endless hours of
[52:18] studying and cross-referencing and you
[52:21] will find my brother and sister the rise
[52:23] of all problems you might say in our
[52:26] nation begin in that time frame and as
[52:30] it was people blame it on those
[52:32] returning from the war those that were
[52:34] coming we went into the Korean War it
[52:37] went on into the late 50s early 60s the
[52:41] conflict in Vietnam which tore our
[52:43] nation apart and people that say we
[52:45] believe these are the influences the
[52:47] whole hippie uh love movement all of the
[52:50] these are the reasons my brother and
[52:52] sister those are the effects they were
[52:55] not the reason they were the effects and
[52:58] so it's there that God's anointed a
[53:01] prophet to say they accept Christ or
[53:03] they uh reject him in this day and it is
[53:07] a season and of a time my brother and
[53:09] sister we're seeing the fruits of
[53:11] rejection we're seeing what is happening
[53:13] to a nation that rejected God so you see
[53:17] it didn't happen overnight they didn't
[53:18] reject God in 1956 and 1957 chaos broke
[53:24] out
[53:25] but it's just like an apple setting
[53:29] on on the rail
[53:31] it will look good for weeks and weeks
[53:34] and weeks and weeks and weeks
[53:36] now follow this
[53:38] but as a season of coldness comes
[53:42] it actually has a preserving effect
[53:50] so we think the apple is going to be
[53:52] okay
[53:55] but inside
[53:57] internal
[53:59] down in the deepest of the deep which we
[54:03] would call the soul Realm
[54:05] the apple is decaying
[54:09] and the first hint of heat
[54:14] all corruption manifests itself
[54:18] that's what we're seeing you say well
[54:20] where's the heat in our nation our
[54:21] nation's getting cold away from God this
[54:24] bride my brother and sister has an
[54:25] atmosphere that she is on fire she is
[54:29] the Heat
[54:30] and so God is now bringing forth a heat
[54:33] in the land
[54:35] that is causing the corruption
[54:38] to be manifest
[54:41] you see if it was only lukewarm and cold
[54:46] it could endure for a long time
[54:49] but there's some heat
[54:51] that's coming forth being manifested in
[54:54] the day that we're living in
[54:56] so you look at this my brother and
[54:58] sister I would say today that the
[55:00] rejection of God's plan in 1956 has
[55:04] affected every one of us are you not
[55:06] daily affected by the spirit of laodicea
[55:09] of the things of this world we are
[55:12] affected and that's why God has been so
[55:14] loving so kind so gracious to give us
[55:17] the warning he says look if you just sit
[55:21] on the Pew if you just sit there and you
[55:23] do you're not going to just sit there
[55:25] and get hotter and hotter you're going
[55:27] to sit there and get older and colder
[55:30] and of course we can see that in the
[55:32] natural sometimes uh it's my own fault
[55:34] as it words sister Jerry will call me
[55:36] and tell me supper is ready I tell her
[55:39] I'll be there in a minute and 50 minutes
[55:41] later I show up now I cannot complain to
[55:44] my wife that she served me cold food
[55:46] because she did not
[55:49] she served me hot food
[55:51] I failed to come
[55:53] and partake
[55:55] and the word of God the fire of God the
[55:58] Holy Ghost is just as hot today as it
[56:01] was when he said come out of her my
[56:04] people
[56:07] it's just a matter of whether we decide
[56:09] to come or not
[56:12] or wait
[56:15] but you see what's happening my brother
[56:16] and sister in our nation
[56:23] we're reflecting another leadership
[56:31] that's why the word of God said come out
[56:33] of our people
[56:34] and this is why we can sing songs like
[56:36] this world is not my home
[56:38] because we're under a different
[56:40] leadership
[56:42] and that's why what we see in politics
[56:44] and all of these the all of this greed
[56:46] and all of the things that are taking
[56:48] place we're seeing another leadership
[56:51] because Lucifer said you know what I
[56:53] want to rise I'm just paraphrasing this
[56:56] I want to rise above
[56:59] his throne
[57:01] I want to rise to the highest Pinnacle
[57:03] the highest peak and he declared that he
[57:06] was going to and so what he was
[57:09] basically saying was is I have
[57:10] leadership skills
[57:12] I have something that will pull the
[57:15] people even the very angels of God he
[57:19] had sway over them to pull them
[57:23] now look at us mere mortals
[57:26] a whole world now being sway being drawn
[57:28] I just saw a picture the other day
[57:31] if they hadn't said it was a man I
[57:32] wouldn't have recognized it was a man
[57:35] high heels on shave legs with some kind
[57:38] of stalking with this big white dress
[57:41] and doing and kind of the weird spiky
[57:44] hairdos they do with all these dangling
[57:46] earrings and they were giving this is
[57:49] for in Europe they're giving this man
[57:50] some kind of a award that he's
[57:53] accomplished some great thing and if you
[57:56] looked at this you would you would just
[57:57] look at this and go that that is so
[57:59] ludicrous if I was to show you a picture
[58:01] whoever designed his clothes had to been
[58:04] on something
[58:06] and they were
[58:07] an anointing from the pits of hell
[58:11] and they're now raising up and giving
[58:13] awards to men like this that's no man
[58:16] I'm telling you that man could not
[58:18] survive a day outside of his Satan's
[58:22] created Eden
[58:25] now it sounds judgmental
[58:27] and I don't mean it judgmental In the
[58:29] Flesh the man's got a soul I'd like to
[58:30] see that Soul saved
[58:32] but this is the effect of the rejection
[58:35] this is the effect of allowing Satan to
[58:38] rise to a pinnacle
[58:42] see there's a lot of things that we
[58:44] don't understand Saints can we say Amen
[58:46] to that a lot of things we don't
[58:47] understand but that's one thing I want
[58:49] to drive home to you today no move of
[58:52] God is ever wasted
[58:56] we might be sitting here this morning
[58:58] saying there was a time in my life that
[59:00] God dealt with me and it would be and
[59:02] the devil would be saying see that's
[59:03] your only opportunity God's moved on but
[59:06] I'm telling you if your sons and
[59:07] daughters of God and we'll touch
[59:09] scripture here in a few minutes you're a
[59:11] son or daughter of God no move of God in
[59:13] your life is a wasted move
[59:15] and so we'll find ourselves sometimes
[59:18] having got cold got lukewarm and cold
[59:20] and we're there and we wonder would God
[59:22] ever move in my life I want to give you
[59:24] reassurance today that God is setting a
[59:27] stage in your life because that seed
[59:29] cannot be lost
[59:31] it cannot be departed it cannot go away
[59:34] my brother and sister and so God is
[59:36] moving and it's like as it were we
[59:39] referenced it sometimes to like a a game
[59:41] of chess and there's moves that are made
[59:43] and Satan's moving here and there's
[59:45] times that Satan would say Checkmate but
[59:48] you know what God gives Supernatural
[59:49] inspiration for us to move into another
[59:52] position and Satan's trap Falls
[59:55] it fails it can accomplish
[59:59] and we see this
[1:00:01] I'm telling you no move is wasted
[1:00:04] if God wants you in the wilderness my
[1:00:06] brother and sister
[1:00:08] I don't know I'm not going to put
[1:00:09] anybody on the spot today but I believe
[1:00:11] probably in our midst today there would
[1:00:13] be some that would say you know what I
[1:00:14] feel like I'm in a Wilderness there's a
[1:00:16] purpose for you being in the wilderness
[1:00:18] if you I feel like I've been thrown in
[1:00:21] the fire there is purpose for you being
[1:00:24] in the fire
[1:00:35] you know
[1:00:37] no matter where you're at spiritually or
[1:00:39] naturally
[1:00:41] this bride of Christ
[1:00:43] now we're just humans right
[1:00:46] and we have no way
[1:00:48] to come to a point to say
[1:00:50] I know
[1:00:51] you're a son of God
[1:00:54] I can take a little DNA and go prove
[1:00:57] that
[1:00:58] but my brother and sister the DNA of God
[1:01:01] is how we respond to the word
[1:01:05] and when you respond to the word of God
[1:01:08] you recognize then that couldn't be me
[1:01:11] I'm just flesh and blood and I can do
[1:01:13] ancestry.com and trace my family right
[1:01:16] back generation Generation generation
[1:01:18] there's no God in my family my great
[1:01:21] great grandmother did not marry a god
[1:01:24] but yet the very DNA of Sons and
[1:01:27] Daughters of God chose where we come
[1:01:29] from
[1:01:30] and people would say well you guys are a
[1:01:32] little bit arrogant because you think
[1:01:34] that you are something special I don't
[1:01:36] think I'm something special the word
[1:01:38] showed me clearly I am special and it's
[1:01:41] not me and my flesh it's the word it's
[1:01:45] the word saints that said we were
[1:01:47] special
[1:01:48] it's a word that declared our position
[1:01:51] and I believe the word can we say we're
[1:01:54] Believers this morning I'm a Believer
[1:01:57] amen and so this bride of Christ
[1:02:01] no matter where it's at spiritually
[1:02:02] naturally she's been made to be an
[1:02:05] overcomer
[1:02:06] she was not just by chance going to
[1:02:08] overcome a little here and a little
[1:02:10] there you see what you're facing is God
[1:02:12] is bringing you into a position where
[1:02:15] you recognize as a scripture that I
[1:02:17] opened with that you have been blessed
[1:02:19] with power
[1:02:21] now that power is only to be manifested
[1:02:24] with us in a correct position in the
[1:02:27] word right the prophet of God said you
[1:02:29] don't really have power you have
[1:02:30] authority but yet my brother and sister
[1:02:32] if you have authority to unloose the
[1:02:35] power you have power
[1:02:37] but God would anoint the bride right
[1:02:39] just like it is for money
[1:02:42] you know he used to be around the
[1:02:43] message we'd never talk about money over
[1:02:44] the pope but that was just almost like
[1:02:46] too carnal
[1:02:48] but my brother and sister if you need
[1:02:51] you have a need in your life
[1:02:53] and you're sincere you come and ask the
[1:02:55] Lord he says ask
[1:02:57] for some things in my name
[1:03:00] anything
[1:03:03] but you see what separates this bride
[1:03:05] from the religious world is the bride's
[1:03:08] not going to say I need a 7 000 square
[1:03:09] foot house I need a Bentley I need a
[1:03:11] Lear jet I need this I need that I need
[1:03:13] that I need a million dollars in the
[1:03:15] bank the bride will never do that but if
[1:03:16] the bride has need and she comes in
[1:03:18] sincerity God said I've never seen the
[1:03:21] word says I've never seen my children
[1:03:23] begging bread
[1:03:25] somebody say but I'm flat broke well
[1:03:27] look
[1:03:30] yeah
[1:03:32] you have to determine then what is
[1:03:34] begging
[1:03:36] see God has a way of providing God has a
[1:03:38] way of moving
[1:03:40] and a lot of that has to do with our
[1:03:42] perspective
[1:03:45] see spiritually are naturally this bride
[1:03:47] has been made to be an overcomer and the
[1:03:50] reason my brother and sister as the
[1:03:52] prophet of God just sharing some of
[1:03:53] those stories he says you know these
[1:03:55] other birds they they can fly really
[1:03:57] really high but they can't fly as high
[1:04:00] as the eagle
[1:04:02] and so this bride has been brought into
[1:04:04] a position uh handcrafted as it were by
[1:04:08] the grace of God to rise up and live in
[1:04:11] Heavenly places
[1:04:12] and now I could take you to the quote
[1:04:15] but I won't because you know I'm telling
[1:04:17] you the truth the prophet of God says we
[1:04:20] are guilty of living below our privilege
[1:04:25] now who are we going to blame
[1:04:28] come on we've all played the blame game
[1:04:30] at some time in our life who are we to
[1:04:33] blame if we are living below what God
[1:04:37] declared is our privilege
[1:04:39] we can't blame God we have to come back
[1:04:42] look in the mirror and say you know what
[1:04:44] what's hindering me is me
[1:04:47] and so Lord help me come then when I
[1:04:50] would ask I would ask in sincerity not a
[1:04:53] miss and that you would come now look
[1:04:58] our Joshua
[1:05:00] I love reading the book of Joshua
[1:05:03] come on Church our Joshua was declaring
[1:05:05] to us today rise up at once and possess
[1:05:08] the land
[1:05:09] and that's not an empty command he says
[1:05:12] because you are more than able to
[1:05:16] it's not I'm sending you out there to be
[1:05:18] slaughtered in laodicea he's there
[1:05:21] declaring possess your land but our land
[1:05:23] is not real estate in this state or any
[1:05:26] other state our land is a spiritual
[1:05:29] Kingdom
[1:05:30] and so he's telling you you are more
[1:05:33] than able to go possess this land rise
[1:05:37] up at once I love those passages in
[1:05:39] Joshua rise up at once and take the land
[1:05:43] but look at the Spirit of the age
[1:05:45] look at the spirit that 1956 has brought
[1:05:48] to America that people would say I want
[1:05:51] that
[1:05:53] but won't cross the street to go to
[1:05:54] church
[1:05:55] won't get out of bed to go to church
[1:05:57] won't do a lot of things but they want
[1:06:00] it there's something down in their soul
[1:06:01] that they're craving that but they won't
[1:06:04] put out the effort and you say but it's
[1:06:06] not works brother Paul yes it is the
[1:06:08] prophet of God gave that as it were
[1:06:10] indictment that they would not even
[1:06:11] cross the street to go to church
[1:06:16] so what was it the word says you ought
[1:06:17] to be in the house of God
[1:06:20] we can apply that across a lot of
[1:06:22] different fronts okay not just about
[1:06:24] coming to the house of God
[1:06:26] but our Joshua said rise up at once
[1:06:29] and so if we will just follow Joshua's
[1:06:32] command imagine the Bible would be a
[1:06:35] whole different book if Israel had
[1:06:36] listened to Joshua
[1:06:39] whole different book my brother and
[1:06:40] sister
[1:06:42] but you see it just wasn't in them
[1:06:46] it just wasn't in them
[1:06:49] so many times in so many places
[1:06:52] the ministry not entirely responsible
[1:06:57] but so many times in so many places
[1:07:00] the ministry says
[1:07:01] I don't I don't want to offend them
[1:07:06] I'll just water this down
[1:07:11] they have good intentions don't they
[1:07:14] I love you I wouldn't want to hurt one
[1:07:16] of you
[1:07:17] but I tell you how much I love you
[1:07:20] I love you enough I will preach this
[1:07:22] gospel that it will get you in a rapture
[1:07:26] that's real love
[1:07:28] is not making you feel warm and fuzzy
[1:07:31] not making you just I feel so
[1:07:32] comfortable in church that's not love my
[1:07:34] brother and sister Real Love is going to
[1:07:37] say that you need to get that out of
[1:07:39] your life you need to get on fire you
[1:07:41] need to get this and re-establish these
[1:07:44] things in your house and in your family
[1:07:45] and in your life that's real love
[1:07:49] the rest is called pandering
[1:07:52] yeah
[1:07:53] but the world would interpret that as
[1:07:55] being love
[1:07:57] says my love is corrective
[1:08:00] now do you want my love as a natural man
[1:08:02] or do you want God's love
[1:08:04] amen because me as a man would be prone
[1:08:06] to make it easy on you
[1:08:08] me as a man would never want to have a
[1:08:11] sharp edge to what we're preaching
[1:08:14] but Christ in me Christ in any holy
[1:08:17] ghost-filled preacher is going to look
[1:08:19] at you and say you know what all I
[1:08:21] really care about I care about the
[1:08:22] natural I care about these things of
[1:08:24] your life I care about the Troubles of
[1:08:26] life but what I care most about is you
[1:08:29] standing Before the Throne of almighty
[1:08:31] God you standing in his presence is what
[1:08:34] I really care about
[1:08:37] but look at the Spirit of laodicea
[1:08:40] look at the age we live in you tell me
[1:08:43] as you study as you read as you listen
[1:08:45] if the prophet of God did not hit it on
[1:08:48] the head over and over and over again
[1:08:51] concerning what this day would be like
[1:08:54] they're looking for the educated tall
[1:08:57] beautiful handsome curly-haired
[1:09:02] and then no offense meant
[1:09:07] then anointer virtually a child a young
[1:09:10] man like her brother Tim Pruitt
[1:09:13] didn't make him some poster child
[1:09:17] a man with a little bit of handicap and
[1:09:20] these kind of things and a gravelly
[1:09:22] voice and whatever and then when he
[1:09:25] preaches the power of God goes out and
[1:09:27] touches lives and changes lives as it
[1:09:29] was as it would be sorry to make this
[1:09:31] connection back to her brother Tim but
[1:09:33] just as they said about Jesus there was
[1:09:34] nothing to attract you to him
[1:09:38] and the prophet of God says they'll be
[1:09:40] attracted to this
[1:09:41] fine churches find choirs beautiful
[1:09:45] singing
[1:09:48] almost in their streaming
[1:09:50] the church will run it through a program
[1:09:53] that gives us about a 10 second delay so
[1:09:56] if anybody makes a blooper
[1:09:58] we can cut it out
[1:10:08] do you want Jesus Sermon on the Mount
[1:10:10] edited or unedited
[1:10:18] you realize that Satan doesn't mind a
[1:10:20] Wilderness experience
[1:10:23] he actually looks for it and the reason
[1:10:25] is is it gives him more opportunity to
[1:10:27] throw more roadblocks or obstacles
[1:10:29] in your way for you to overcome
[1:10:33] you know what the devil is out there
[1:10:34] when Israel's coming out of Egypt
[1:10:37] he's rejoicing look
[1:10:39] he could have just walked over
[1:10:41] the promised land but hey now they're
[1:10:43] going out here and what it did now we
[1:10:45] understand the Judgment of God Satan
[1:10:47] didn't have any influence on that you
[1:10:49] might say in that judgment but you see
[1:10:51] Satan was there saying that's the right
[1:10:52] decision send them out into the
[1:10:55] Wilderness for 40 years and just let
[1:10:56] them die off in their unbelief
[1:11:01] but there was a generation
[1:11:04] come on there was purpose my brother and
[1:11:06] sister for the Wilderness there was a
[1:11:08] generation that looked at that and said
[1:11:11] I love my daddy I love my mama I love
[1:11:13] uncle and auntie and I love all these
[1:11:15] people but I'm never gonna get caught in
[1:11:18] the same trial and if God says walk I'm
[1:11:20] going to walk if God says speak I'm
[1:11:22] going to speak if he says Sing I'm going
[1:11:24] to sing if he says worship I'm going to
[1:11:26] worship
[1:11:28] and when the word comes I'm going to let
[1:11:30] him know I believe
[1:11:31] Lord I'm over here in the corner in the
[1:11:34] far back corner of the congregation I
[1:11:36] believe
[1:11:39] and It produced a people that were not
[1:11:41] free of doubts remember
[1:11:44] those that come and said hey uh this
[1:11:47] side of the river is a land for cattle
[1:11:51] and we're people men of cattle we we
[1:11:54] just want to say here Joshua didn't say
[1:11:56] I'll go make a reference and see what
[1:11:58] was Joshua had already heard the prophet
[1:12:03] Joshua already knew what the word was
[1:12:05] Joshua responds right there says you'll
[1:12:07] either cross over
[1:12:09] or you'll die just like your parents
[1:12:13] young people
[1:12:14] Saints of Grace
[1:12:16] we got no place to say we believe God
[1:12:18] sent a prophet and we just settled down
[1:12:19] on that we don't do anything we have to
[1:12:22] cross over
[1:12:24] we have to get on the other side and
[1:12:27] experience what it was to enter the
[1:12:29] Promised Land
[1:12:31] then if we come back on this side right
[1:12:33] here and God blesses you with a nice job
[1:12:35] a nice home a good family some of the
[1:12:38] amenities of life that's wonderful I
[1:12:40] have no qualm about that but we've got
[1:12:43] to get on the other side first
[1:12:47] or all of this over here in La Lucia
[1:12:49] will corrupt us
[1:12:51] will destroy us tear us apart
[1:12:57] but you see the bride of Christ doesn't
[1:12:58] mind the Wilderness either
[1:13:04] this might come across as a strange
[1:13:05] thought to you but maybe not hope not
[1:13:08] we should not mind
[1:13:10] the Wilderness called laodicea
[1:13:13] because it's giving us
[1:13:17] more opportunity to say woe is me
[1:13:22] no
[1:13:23] it's giving more opportunity
[1:13:26] to say look at that brothers and sisters
[1:13:30] that
[1:13:31] looks bad to my flesh
[1:13:34] but my spirit says that looks like
[1:13:36] victory
[1:13:38] that looks like a Bible I'm going to win
[1:13:40] and I haven't even entered into it yet
[1:13:42] not as a victory I can stop right now
[1:13:45] before I even Drew my sword and Mark
[1:13:47] another victory
[1:13:49] you see that's the bride she's not
[1:13:51] contained in the spirit of laodicea
[1:13:54] she's contained in the spirit of the
[1:13:56] word which is the Holy Ghost amen she's
[1:13:59] not looking at this woe unto me that
[1:14:01] we're here in this world and the things
[1:14:03] of this world and the impact on my
[1:14:05] family from this world it is a victory
[1:14:08] I'm going to claim my unsafe family I'm
[1:14:12] already declaring them in the name of
[1:14:14] Jesus Christ I believe that because
[1:14:16] otherwise what are you going to pray for
[1:14:20] woe unto me Lord my children are lost
[1:14:23] that's not the prayer of the believer
[1:14:25] and you can't just say well I put them
[1:14:27] in the Rapture you can't do that either
[1:14:29] but I'm telling you you can come down
[1:14:32] and you can enter in and be the
[1:14:34] intercessor in prayer intercessor Before
[1:14:37] the Throne of God and first and not
[1:14:40] first and foremost but amongst the top
[1:14:42] you can live this Living Word in front
[1:14:45] of them
[1:14:47] oh children we can be Overcomers as we
[1:14:49] crash and burn
[1:14:52] oh we will crash and burn it's just
[1:14:54] human nature
[1:14:56] but we're going to go down fighting
[1:14:58] we're going to take a breath and we're
[1:15:00] going to rise up fighting
[1:15:02] oh my brother and sister the problem is
[1:15:05] is we just go down whimpering and if we
[1:15:07] do come back up it's still a whimper
[1:15:11] hmm
[1:15:13] this bride's going to look at this and
[1:15:15] say look at that God's given me another
[1:15:16] opportunity to overcome
[1:15:19] not that I might
[1:15:21] but to declare it I am going to overcome
[1:15:25] this situation
[1:15:28] look Church young people whoever it
[1:15:30] might be
[1:15:31] you're sitting here right now you've got
[1:15:33] to struggle in your life and you realize
[1:15:35] that's keeping you from being on fire
[1:15:37] for God I would ask you in your heart
[1:15:39] outward however you want to do it to
[1:15:42] come and say Lord change my words change
[1:15:46] my vocabulary let me be there saying
[1:15:49] Lord I believe your word and this
[1:15:51] trouble and this stroke struggle I'm in
[1:15:53] the trouble I'm in it's big it's before
[1:15:55] me but I will overcome it I am an
[1:15:58] overcomer not a might be could have been
[1:16:01] once was I am right now an overcomer in
[1:16:05] Christ Jesus
[1:16:07] oh Hallelujah
[1:16:09] God giving you that recognize your
[1:16:12] purpose my brother and sister
[1:16:15] you see it's all a matter of perspective
[1:16:18] not us saying oh no another trial I
[1:16:21] don't like them as much as any anymore
[1:16:22] than anybody else I don't like them
[1:16:27] you know believe it or not God's use
[1:16:28] farming to temper me on some of these
[1:16:31] things
[1:16:33] as a young boy my dad
[1:16:35] used to say farming he'd say if it's the
[1:16:38] living breathing it will die
[1:16:40] if it's a machine it will break
[1:16:44] and there's nothing like getting a phone
[1:16:46] call
[1:16:47] from an employee saying you know the
[1:16:50] pump that's mounted on the right side of
[1:16:52] the bell housing or the hydrostat of
[1:16:54] this machine yes
[1:16:57] just blew up
[1:16:59] there's about eighteen thousand dollars
[1:17:04] my life is over
[1:17:06] if God loved me this would never happen
[1:17:11] no
[1:17:13] okay
[1:17:15] Lord thy will be done
[1:17:17] I'm going in the Rapture anyhow
[1:17:20] this is all going to burn
[1:17:22] if I can just figure to leave you put
[1:17:24] this to you'll come back to earth and
[1:17:26] there's going to be a little spot right
[1:17:27] there and you're going to realize that
[1:17:28] was all my farm equipment that I valued
[1:17:30] so much
[1:17:32] as everything I play so much value is
[1:17:34] this little pile of molten metal right
[1:17:36] here
[1:17:39] and God's going to say
[1:17:42] you place value on this
[1:17:45] see the battle we have to fight with
[1:17:49] God says you know what fiery trials
[1:17:52] anybody had any lately
[1:17:56] what are they for
[1:17:58] to make our trucks break down our
[1:18:00] tractors break down and this breakdown
[1:18:01] and that breakdown and empty our bank
[1:18:03] account no sir he said it's for molding
[1:18:06] your
[1:18:08] bank account
[1:18:10] character
[1:18:13] and if you could stand before God
[1:18:16] and say Lord what would it take to mold
[1:18:18] my character into a son or daughter of
[1:18:21] God and he said everything you've got
[1:18:23] standing in his presence you would say
[1:18:25] it's yours Lord
[1:18:27] but we here in the flesh hold on we claw
[1:18:30] oh oh bro it's a dollar
[1:18:38] and God's saying
[1:18:40] where
[1:18:42] are you placing your value
[1:18:45] what is your purpose
[1:18:50] now you know as well as I do in the
[1:18:52] flesh we'd like to all have a hundred
[1:18:53] thousand dollars in the bank versus one
[1:18:55] dollar
[1:18:57] that's a carnal fleshly thing
[1:19:00] but when you recognize God
[1:19:02] doesn't see value
[1:19:04] in anything
[1:19:06] other than the word that we see value
[1:19:10] we're looking from two different
[1:19:11] perspectives
[1:19:13] God says you know like you've no doubt
[1:19:15] heard the jokes you know or the guy
[1:19:16] shows up in heaven good Christian man
[1:19:18] but he shows up in heaven a couple
[1:19:19] suitcases full of gold
[1:19:21] and the angel up there says
[1:19:24] oh more pavement
[1:19:30] yeah that's about how much
[1:19:32] God places value
[1:19:33] on what we place value
[1:19:36] okay let's move on here
[1:19:41] you see we must
[1:19:42] God giving us opportunity to overcome
[1:19:45] you see but the real Victory is
[1:19:46] recognizing what our purpose is a matter
[1:19:49] of perspective we can say oh no another
[1:19:51] trial or we can say oh my look another
[1:19:54] victory
[1:19:56] it's all in our perspective my brother
[1:19:58] and sister and when we recognize our
[1:20:01] purpose for being here it will change
[1:20:03] our whole view of the world we live in
[1:20:06] and when we see things around us we'll
[1:20:08] recognize this is not about Flesh and
[1:20:10] Blood this is not about uh this issue or
[1:20:13] this issue or this issue this is about
[1:20:15] principalities powers of Darkness but
[1:20:18] mostly focused on this is about me and
[1:20:20] the word
[1:20:22] it's not even now this sounds a little
[1:20:24] harsh my brother and sister but it's a
[1:20:25] two-way two-edged swords waves here you
[1:20:28] see it's not about me wondering what's
[1:20:29] wrong with you
[1:20:33] I'm just really going to focus and
[1:20:35] figure out what's wrong with this
[1:20:36] brother or this sister
[1:20:43] you know what Lord help me
[1:20:46] judgmental Spirits you know where they
[1:20:49] come from
[1:20:50] the man who is not bold enough
[1:20:53] to pull the beam out of his eye
[1:20:58] we're too big a coward to pull the beam
[1:21:01] out of our own eye
[1:21:03] but we're going to fix everything for
[1:21:06] everyone else
[1:21:10] you know why
[1:21:12] because pulling the beam out of your eye
[1:21:15] is painful
[1:21:21] I don't have enough prayer life
[1:21:23] I'm not reading my Bible faithful enough
[1:21:27] I'm not in the house of God like I
[1:21:29] should I'm not praying
[1:21:30] that's what happens when the beam comes
[1:21:32] out
[1:21:33] Spirit of laodicea has come and affected
[1:21:35] me more than I thought
[1:21:37] my music is
[1:21:39] no longer okay
[1:21:41] how I dress
[1:21:43] is not correct
[1:21:46] how do you say this
[1:21:49] my stomping and pulling
[1:21:52] the beam
[1:21:54] out of our eye
[1:21:57] and I love that story about how you know
[1:21:59] that lady she's just
[1:22:01] really down on that lady
[1:22:04] look at her house it's so dirty her yard
[1:22:07] her windows
[1:22:09] one day in a fit of inspiration you guys
[1:22:11] know this story she goes out and washes
[1:22:14] her windows and she looks out and she's
[1:22:16] like oh praise God
[1:22:18] the neighbor finally did something about
[1:22:21] their house
[1:22:24] pulling
[1:22:25] the beam out
[1:22:28] because you see until we get the beam
[1:22:30] out Saints
[1:22:32] we could sing and shout and dance about
[1:22:36] and it won't do us one bit of good amen
[1:22:41] Lord help us
[1:22:43] I'll lift my hand first and say Lord
[1:22:45] help us
[1:22:46] help us Lord
[1:22:49] because you see what God's doing is
[1:22:53] bringing us a place that when it comes
[1:22:55] so close it would deceive
[1:22:58] your vision will be so clear
[1:23:00] that's not the word that is the word
[1:23:03] rightly dividing able to discern the
[1:23:07] spirits of the age able to come to the
[1:23:09] place that you see Christ as the prophet
[1:23:13] of God said you see Christ in everything
[1:23:17] you mean the wickedness out here we see
[1:23:19] Christ in that yes sir it's the word
[1:23:21] fulfilled
[1:23:23] he he prophesied the word must be
[1:23:26] fulfilled oh my we have went so far
[1:23:28] south
[1:23:29] amen I know we're still on
[1:23:32] here but
[1:23:33] so look at this now Saints
[1:23:36] sorry I'm going to say this just kind of
[1:23:38] I'm not going to water it down for any
[1:23:39] of you some of you have just been
[1:23:41] sitting around and decided that it must
[1:23:43] be just your trial of life to be Satan's
[1:23:45] punching bag
[1:23:49] here I am devil beat me up again
[1:23:52] there's one thing between having a trial
[1:23:55] and putting yourself in a position be
[1:23:57] Satan's punching bag
[1:23:59] because in a trial my brother and sister
[1:24:01] you have decision to decide do I move
[1:24:05] forward do I camp here in the wilderness
[1:24:07] of sin or do I go forward do I detour
[1:24:12] you know at Moab what do I do at Moab
[1:24:15] what do I do here when I get to Katie's
[1:24:17] Barney what am I going to do you have
[1:24:19] decision but when you have given up and
[1:24:21] you just stand there and let the devil
[1:24:23] beat on you you will not see the spirit
[1:24:25] of being an overcomer you will not be as
[1:24:28] it were fighting the good fight of Faith
[1:24:30] you are just hoping somehow you will
[1:24:33] endure this
[1:24:34] I'm here to tell you today if you don't
[1:24:37] have a vision to know that God has
[1:24:39] already given you power by the word to
[1:24:42] bind those spirits and to move forward
[1:24:44] oh does it apply it does
[1:24:46] my dear wife is so loving and kind of
[1:24:48] money embarrass her right now and I'm
[1:24:50] sorry to do this but you know what
[1:24:52] Thursday morning she looked me in the
[1:24:55] face and says having a little trouble

[1:25:03] I had to go off and cry because I was I
[1:25:05] was there just you know what's the
[1:25:08] little guy in the cartoon that had the
[1:25:10] little rain cloud over his head

[1:25:15] of those guys you know
[1:25:17] you know my own personal
[1:25:20] see it's raining here
[1:25:25] until
[1:25:27] you consult the man who turns on the
[1:25:29] light and you say you know what Lord I I
[1:25:31] walk out of the house I can pick up I
[1:25:33] drive off and say Lord I'm not going to
[1:25:35] be defeated today
[1:25:37] I'm not going to be defeated so it
[1:25:39] sounds a little harsher my dear wife to
[1:25:40] say you know are you having trouble
[1:25:42] living with church last night but you
[1:25:44] see God knew I really needed to hear
[1:25:46] that because I needed to tell the cloud
[1:25:48] go away
[1:25:49] I'm done with you go away I'm not going
[1:25:52] to be defeated I spoke the truth I can
[1:25:55] reinforce it by the word of God I can
[1:25:57] take it back through the message I can
[1:25:59] run it through the filter it goes

[1:26:13] laodicea I'm going to stand on the word
[1:26:16] in spite of what my flesh feels like
[1:26:20] Hallelujah you see I'm not here to
[1:26:23] testify of defeat and neither are you

[1:26:37] down bringing down our purpose of being
[1:26:39] here
[1:26:41] oh I'll tell you what I just had to cut
[1:26:43] so much out of this slot because it was
[1:26:45] going to be too long and it still will
[1:26:46] be but my brother and sister the prophet
[1:26:48] of God said the purpose that you have on
[1:26:51] this life is to defeat Satan

[1:28:13] made known
[1:28:19] when people say there's things that God
[1:28:21] has not
[1:28:24] brought
[1:28:25] and you have no right to claim it
[1:28:28] my brother and sister my Bible says
[1:28:31] he's made known unto us the mystery of
[1:28:33] his will
[1:28:37] do I comprehend it all
[1:28:39] I'm not speaking down on myself but I'm
[1:28:41] probably amongst the least intelligent
[1:28:43] there is in this building right here but
[1:28:46] God never said Paul your IQ will save
[1:28:49] you
[1:28:53] what he said was is your faith
[1:28:56] oh Hallelujah I'll get excited about
[1:28:58] that my
[1:29:01] has nothing to do with where I was born
[1:29:03] in the family uh what the birth order
[1:29:05] was what state I was born in what nation
[1:29:08] I was born in on the dark side on the
[1:29:10] sunny side or whatever side nothing to
[1:29:13] do with that he said my faith is there
[1:29:17] deposited in you and you are now
[1:29:19] receiving that faith and by faith you
[1:29:22] will overcome by faith you will manifest
[1:29:25] the very purpose I put you on the Earth
[1:29:28] oh Hallelujah is it okay to be excited
[1:29:31] today amen
[1:29:33] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:29:36] his will according to his good pleasure
[1:29:38] with which he hath purposed amen
[1:29:42] in himself
[1:29:45] you realize my purpose your purpose is
[1:29:47] not even anchored in US
[1:29:52] a PhD or a high school dropout
[1:29:55] big and strong
[1:29:58] or weak
[1:30:01] had nothing to do
[1:30:03] but I tell you what
[1:30:05] you'll find in The Believer faith
[1:30:09] giant sized faith
[1:30:12] and it won't matter what the world
[1:30:14] thinks or how the World Views it or what
[1:30:16] the results as it were of them physical
[1:30:18] accomplishment of this world is none of
[1:30:21] that matters faith
[1:30:26] you can preach about 10 sermons right
[1:30:29] off of that one right there
[1:30:33] which he has purposed in himself you
[1:30:36] realize my whole purpose your whole
[1:30:37] purpose
[1:30:38] is his purpose
[1:30:42] I don't have no message identity of
[1:30:44] purpose I don't have no church identity
[1:30:46] of purpose I don't have no certain
[1:30:48] Minister identity of purpose I have
[1:30:50] purpose in him
[1:30:55] well our family's totally messed up
[1:30:58] is that your purpose
[1:31:06] we're poor is that your purpose rich is
[1:31:09] that your purpose
[1:31:11] no those are called crutches
[1:31:16] you don't see healthy people
[1:31:18] walking on crutches
[1:31:20] let's be healthy
[1:31:25] dispensation fullness of times he might
[1:31:27] gather together in one all things in
[1:31:29] Christ both which are in heaven and
[1:31:31] which are in Earth even in him
[1:31:34] in whom also we have obtained an
[1:31:36] inheritance
[1:31:38] I like that idea
[1:31:40] I like obtaining an inheritance being
[1:31:44] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:31:47] of him who has worketh all things after
[1:31:50] the counsel of his own will that we
[1:31:53] should be the praise the praise of his
[1:31:57] glory who first trusted in Christ in
[1:31:59] whom ye also trusted after that she
[1:32:02] heard the word of Truth The Gospel of
[1:32:04] your salvation and whom also after that
[1:32:06] ye believed you were sealed with that
[1:32:09] Holy Spirit of promise
[1:32:11] how beautiful we set solid not shaken by
[1:32:15] every wind of Doctrine and doubt and
[1:32:17] fear we set solid and in the end it all
[1:32:20] comes down that he says you know what
[1:32:22] I'm going to do I'm going to give you
[1:32:24] this inheritance the earnest of it until
[1:32:27] the Redemption of the purchased
[1:32:29] possession until the you know what I've
[1:32:31] got
[1:32:33] brother Trevor and I just visiting a
[1:32:35] little bit about that I just keep coming
[1:32:36] back uh running into quotes where
[1:32:39] brother Brown's talking about the
[1:32:40] diamond and how even the chip off of the
[1:32:43] diamond it's still the diamond
[1:32:45] it's not throwed away
[1:32:47] I might be the least in the Kingdom my
[1:32:49] brother and sister but I'm in the
[1:32:51] Kingdom amen now God made me a part of
[1:32:53] the body of Christ and I'm gonna claim
[1:32:55] that I'm going to stand in that I'm
[1:32:57] going to confess that because I
[1:32:59] recognize now that I have purpose now
[1:33:02] First John 3 7-9
[1:33:06] little children let no man deceive you
[1:33:08] he that doeth righteousness is righteous
[1:33:10] even as he is righteous and he that
[1:33:12] committeth sin is of the devil for the
[1:33:15] devil sinneth from the beginning for
[1:33:17] this purpose the Son of God was
[1:33:19] manifested
[1:33:21] isn't that amazing
[1:33:23] for that very purpose he was manifested
[1:33:26] that he might destroy the works of the
[1:33:29] devil whoever is born of God does not
[1:33:32] commit sin
[1:33:33] for his seed remaineth in him
[1:33:41] you know what the devil's after says
[1:33:45] he's not after your brain
[1:33:48] he's not after your muscles
[1:33:51] he's after
[1:33:53] the seed
[1:33:55] that's what he wants
[1:33:58] but you know the devil can't take the
[1:34:00] seed from you
[1:34:02] but he can convince you
[1:34:05] to give it to him
[1:34:07] but even the word said
[1:34:10] whoever is born of God
[1:34:12] now okay let's stop for a moment you
[1:34:14] don't have to shake your head you don't
[1:34:15] have to lift a hand you'll have to do
[1:34:18] but we have sinned
[1:34:23] face it we have send
[1:34:27] so how can you reconcile
[1:34:30] yourself to that right there
[1:34:33] I was born of God but yet I committed
[1:34:35] sin
[1:34:37] I mean my mind says I sinned
[1:34:42] but your life
[1:34:44] through the blood
[1:34:46] comes out pure white
[1:34:49] Before the Throne of God
[1:34:52] scripture says I won't even hold it to
[1:34:55] their account
[1:34:57] is that not an awesome God we serve
[1:34:59] isn't that awesome beautiful I just want
[1:35:02] to just Rejoice I want to run up down
[1:35:03] the aisle here my brother and sister
[1:35:05] because God says I knew what your flesh
[1:35:07] did but I know who you are and I cannot
[1:35:09] even that's what it really comes down to
[1:35:11] I cannot even hold that to your account
[1:35:14] because I have made you a part of me and
[1:35:17] I am sinless so if I am sinless and you
[1:35:20] are a part of me there's no way on Earth
[1:35:23] you can be a sinner
[1:35:25] oh thank you Lord hallelujah amen so
[1:35:30] while we're trying to be over here and
[1:35:32] we won't go to church because we've done
[1:35:34] this and we won't go to church because
[1:35:36] we've done this and we won't go to
[1:35:37] church because this reason and we won't
[1:35:39] pray because I and we won't read our
[1:35:42] Bible because forget it my brother and
[1:35:44] sister recognize God said you have a
[1:35:48] seed and my seed is that seed that
[1:35:51] remaineth in you everything else will be
[1:35:55] tore apart even families will be
[1:35:57] fractured down to the very core of their
[1:35:59] lives and people will be upset about
[1:36:01] these things and all this falls apart
[1:36:04] kingdoms falling down economics falling
[1:36:07] down America my brother and sister the
[1:36:09] prophet of God said even now she is
[1:36:12] bankrupt right that terrifies me as a
[1:36:15] man that does business to think I'm
[1:36:17] doing business in a nation dealing with
[1:36:19] banks and everything else that are all
[1:36:21] bankrupt but I'm telling you my brother
[1:36:23] and sister the word of God come and says
[1:36:25] that all right I will cause the spirit
[1:36:27] of the age to take care of you I will
[1:36:30] create a harbor for you I will give you
[1:36:32] a piece of escape to run into and I will
[1:36:36] feed the sparrow I will feed you don't
[1:36:39] worry about it when the day comes I will
[1:36:41] take you home and let the Judgment say
[1:36:44] has been heaped against the Nations will
[1:36:46] come and it will pour out like a flood
[1:36:48] over them and we don't need to be
[1:36:50] sitting here having a mental breakdown
[1:36:51] over it we need to be saying Lord help
[1:36:54] me help me rise up Lord I want to live
[1:36:57] in Heavenly places I want to live this
[1:36:59] word I want to have purpose in my life I
[1:37:01] want to be a testimony in my family I
[1:37:05] want to be a testimony in the house of
[1:37:07] God testimony in my community
[1:37:11] oh Hallelujah
[1:37:13] look at this because whoever is born of
[1:37:16] God doth not commit sin amen that seed
[1:37:19] will not come out of you but Satan's
[1:37:21] going to try and get you to hand it over
[1:37:22] he might dig every bit of Earth as it
[1:37:25] were that's covering that seed over but
[1:37:27] he can't take it he can't kill it
[1:37:31] so some of you that keep falling back in
[1:37:34] condemnation and just don't you just
[1:37:36] don't even hardly put an effort to
[1:37:38] serving God because condemnation's been
[1:37:40] heaped upon you my brother and sister
[1:37:42] what you got to do right now is step up
[1:37:45] out of that position and say I will no
[1:37:48] longer occupy and perform Satan's
[1:37:51] purpose I will serve the purpose of my
[1:37:54] God hallelujah
[1:37:56] oh let me just jump over some things
[1:37:59] oh how to yeah you know I had a little
[1:38:01] Revival this morning Saints I just have
[1:38:03] to tell you
[1:38:04] amen this is what I wrote down
[1:38:07] the Church of the Living God
[1:38:09] is a devil defeating
[1:38:11] word believing group of people
[1:38:14] so if you ever need to figure out who
[1:38:16] you are identity crisis or whatever just
[1:38:19] remember you are a devil defeating amen
[1:38:22] a Bible believing word believing people
[1:38:26] amen
[1:38:28] and the prophet of God says how do you
[1:38:30] do that you just let the word flow
[1:38:31] through you
[1:38:33] you don't go learn Greek in Hebrew and
[1:38:35] you don't do all these other things and
[1:38:37] you don't have to you know fast yourself
[1:38:38] into skin and bones
[1:38:42] just let the word flow through you
[1:38:45] you know what that means
[1:38:47] remember when the prophet of God
[1:38:48] preached about channels
[1:38:52] you've got to let the word the Holy
[1:38:54] Ghost come through and clean that
[1:38:55] channel out
[1:38:57] I want the I want the Holy Spirit to
[1:38:59] move through me but it just don't work
[1:39:01] well
[1:39:03] maybe you need to repent a little bit
[1:39:05] watch a log break loose
[1:39:08] or pen a little bit and watch a boulder
[1:39:10] roll away repent a little bit and do you
[1:39:13] know as a farmer we deal with water all
[1:39:15] the time do you know that a whole pile
[1:39:16] of leaves can stop water just as much as
[1:39:18] a whole loader bucket full of dirt can
[1:39:22] one little complex
[1:39:25] laying next to another little complex
[1:39:27] overlapped by another complex next to a
[1:39:31] big complex next to a little comp
[1:39:33] and pretty soon the channel
[1:39:36] blocked off
[1:39:39] and then we say
[1:39:41] I sure don't feel the presence of God
[1:39:44] that's right the sprinklers don't run if
[1:39:46] there's no water coming out of the pipe
[1:39:49] yeah
[1:39:51] come on
[1:39:53] let me hurry along here Saints I don't
[1:39:54] want to be too too late
[1:39:58] influence of another brother Brown says
[1:40:00] this I'm I'm definitely I'm definitely
[1:40:02] cherry picking this out you go look and
[1:40:04] read it in the whole context okay but
[1:40:06] look at this the only thing that'll
[1:40:08] manifest the word of God is the Holy
[1:40:11] Ghost itself
[1:40:13] amen
[1:40:15] amen when he the Holy Ghost will come he
[1:40:18] will take these things of mine and show
[1:40:21] them to you
[1:40:25] you know I preached quite a few years
[1:40:27] ago
[1:40:29] well I believe it was dedication of
[1:40:30] Living Word
[1:40:32] the challenge of our day my brother and
[1:40:34] sister is not to get the sin out of the
[1:40:36] church
[1:40:37] the challenge of our day is to get the
[1:40:39] Holy Ghost in
[1:40:42] because you can fight to keep sin out of
[1:40:45] the church for the rest of your life and
[1:40:48] deem your personal Ministry your own
[1:40:50] personal life a failure
[1:40:52] but you get the Holy Ghost in and the
[1:40:55] sin will leave
[1:40:58] that's the challenge of our day my
[1:41:00] brother and sister
[1:41:01] not how big our church is or what we
[1:41:03] have or what program we did but to get
[1:41:06] the Holy Ghost inside of our church and
[1:41:08] watch it make a difference in our lives
[1:41:11] amen
[1:41:13] oh Hallelujah
[1:41:15] now just several quotes as we just wind
[1:41:17] this down here
[1:41:19] God knew this great where Warfare was
[1:41:21] going on between right and wrong and he
[1:41:24] knew what the enemy was going to do
[1:41:27] now I hope this isn't offensive to you
[1:41:31] we're now seeing
[1:41:33] a revelation of a new kind of warfare
[1:41:35] like we've never saw before
[1:41:37] we've had spy planes for years right all
[1:41:41] the way back Cold War spy planes
[1:41:44] but now
[1:41:46] you can go down to Best Buy
[1:41:48] and buy a hundred dollar drone
[1:41:51] and run it up in the air and fly it out
[1:41:54] there and see what the enemy's doing
[1:41:58] a new kind of warfare
[1:42:02] and let me tell you right now the devil
[1:42:05] like never before is scrutinizing your
[1:42:10] lives
[1:42:11] to see where he can get in
[1:42:14] to see how he can afflict something upon
[1:42:17] you
[1:42:18] we're living in the day my brother and
[1:42:19] sister the prophet of God will just
[1:42:21] break this down paraphrasing it as it
[1:42:23] were the prophet of God said you in this
[1:42:26] day right now if you don't want the
[1:42:27] devil
[1:42:28] after you you have to get under the
[1:42:31] blood
[1:42:33] okay I got another Blood
[1:42:37] you said you have to stay
[1:42:40] under the blood
[1:42:42] theirs where the key is my brother and
[1:42:44] sister because he's got the devil's got
[1:42:46] his spiritual drone as it were out here
[1:42:48] and he's looking he's looking he's
[1:42:51] looking where what's happening in these
[1:42:52] lives I can just come in all I need is
[1:42:54] one little in the armor to inject
[1:42:56] some poison all I need to do and you
[1:42:59] know what if we're not careful we're
[1:43:01] just living life but maybe we get a
[1:43:02] little sloppy about things
[1:43:04] and see there it is
[1:43:07] I don't know if any of you watched some
[1:43:09] of this warfare that's taking place over
[1:43:11] there uh you know I mean it just it
[1:43:14] terrifies me
[1:43:16] honestly in my flesh it terrifies me
[1:43:19] there literally was a deal these
[1:43:20] Ukrainian soldiers
[1:43:22] got a big plastic box and I'm like that
[1:43:24] sure looks like the Drone we have at the
[1:43:26] farm
[1:43:27] he pulls that thing out sets it over on
[1:43:29] top of a deal how's the deal Loops it
[1:43:31] around his neck it looked like it had an
[1:43:33] iPad on it and he just there and it's
[1:43:35] just like nothing
[1:43:37] flies off
[1:43:40] and only a couple minutes later
[1:43:42] zeros in
[1:43:44] oh look at that people walking in and
[1:43:47] out of this hole in the ground
[1:43:49] it's only like five minutes later
[1:43:56] never before in the history of mankind
[1:44:00] has Satan had such a microscope
[1:44:03] on the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:44:07] every single moment every move
[1:44:12] where can I get them
[1:44:15] where can I Stumble them
[1:44:17] maybe it won't be a bomb
[1:44:19] maybe it'll just be a canister
[1:44:23] filled with all kinds of
[1:44:26] this is not true that's not true you're
[1:44:28] deceived you're in a cult
[1:44:32] they've proven that the war of the mind
[1:44:34] is
[1:44:36] pretty much as effective
[1:44:38] is the
[1:44:40] of the bomb and missile and bullet
[1:44:44] hmm
[1:44:48] sorry I keep dragging this out forgive
[1:44:50] me Saints you know just exactly how to
[1:44:52] equip his people
[1:44:54] so if we notice the very first thing
[1:44:56] that God equipped his children with
[1:44:58] being infinite he knowed what it took to
[1:45:01] defeat Satan any time any place anywhere
[1:45:05] on any condition
[1:45:08] come on let's not offer excuses any
[1:45:10] longer I I can't I can't deal with this
[1:45:13] part of my life
[1:45:15] God's given you everything you need any
[1:45:18] time any place anywhere on any condition
[1:45:22] do we believe this is the words of a
[1:45:24] prophet the words of God
[1:45:26] now he wouldn't say I'll give them
[1:45:29] something here
[1:45:31] now I want you to just forgive me
[1:45:32] because I'm going to butcher this quote
[1:45:36] he didn't say I'll give you something in
[1:45:38] 1965.
[1:45:42] and then I'm just going to let you
[1:45:45] go a few years
[1:45:47] and then maybe I'll study out something
[1:45:49] better to give them than after a few
[1:45:53] years later
[1:45:55] that's where most of these false
[1:45:57] doctrines come from Saints people are
[1:45:59] like well brother Branham had this but
[1:46:00] he never really gave us the full
[1:46:01] revelation of that my Bible says in the
[1:46:03] fullness of time
[1:46:05] all the mysteries of God would be
[1:46:08] revealed
[1:46:10] not a cookie here and a cookie there
[1:46:13] not a little bit here a little bit there
[1:46:15] now that's how Revelation comes to us
[1:46:17] but God laid all of that word out
[1:46:20] and then it's our Revelation that is
[1:46:23] what's expanding and growing not a new
[1:46:25] word of God
[1:46:27] see so I want to go back here real quick
[1:46:29] see we noticed
[1:46:32] he know just exactly how to equip his
[1:46:34] people
[1:46:35] anybody equipped here today
[1:46:37] amen we've been equipped Saints we don't
[1:46:40] have an excuse
[1:46:41] we shouldn't look for an excuse
[1:46:43] amen because we've been equipped and
[1:46:46] we've been given that ability to defeat
[1:46:49] Satan Anytime Anyplace anywhere on any
[1:46:52] condition
[1:46:54] bye
[1:46:56] let's just hurry here
[1:46:58] looking unto Jesus
[1:47:04] that's the very reason that Jesus was
[1:47:06] not understood when he come to the Earth
[1:47:09] if they would have only looked into the
[1:47:12] word of God instead of their own of
[1:47:14] their tradition
[1:47:16] of that day
[1:47:18] they would have known he was the son of
[1:47:19] God because the Bible plainly declared
[1:47:22] his full coming
[1:47:23] and he come in full revelation of the
[1:47:26] word
[1:47:26] and each generation reveals him in the
[1:47:30] full Revelation that's lauded for that
[1:47:33] time
[1:47:34] this generation
[1:47:36] come on let's not be looking backwards
[1:47:38] prophet of God told us don't be looking
[1:47:40] backwards 50 years
[1:47:42] come on now you say well you can use
[1:47:44] that out of context well I don't mean it
[1:47:46] to be out of contact but my brother and
[1:47:47] sister we should not be looking back to
[1:47:50] say I sure wished I had been in the
[1:47:52] Tabernacle band then you go study you'll
[1:47:55] go study what the prophet of God said
[1:47:56] there's times in the message that he
[1:47:58] says this Tabernacle is just as bad as
[1:48:01] any of them
[1:48:02] he didn't cut him Slack
[1:48:04] why because he wanted them to get the
[1:48:07] draws out he wanted them to get to the
[1:48:08] place that they looked through the word
[1:48:10] and not just oh we were from the
[1:48:12] Tabernacle
[1:48:13] now there are those in our midst that
[1:48:15] their family the roots go back and it's
[1:48:16] very very incredible and at some time in
[1:48:19] place when God would anointed I would
[1:48:21] love to hear about some of that but you
[1:48:23] see my brother and sister the New Birth
[1:48:24] has still got to be connected
[1:48:26] I went to this church no New Birth
[1:48:28] you're in trouble go to that church
[1:48:30] you've got a new birth God bless you
[1:48:32] that you went to that church but
[1:48:34] otherwise you see so he says here now
[1:48:37] each generation reveals him in the full
[1:48:39] Revelation that's allotted for that time
[1:48:41] this generation must Jesus Christ that's
[1:48:46] the revelation of him that's promised in
[1:48:48] the word must be revealed to this
[1:48:52] generation now all of you already read
[1:48:54] all the way down to that bottom line and
[1:48:55] I wish I could have blocked it out a
[1:48:57] little bit but my brother and sister I
[1:48:58] tell you you know a song I Love the song
[1:49:00] I love to sing the song but it's there
[1:49:02] if the churches won't receive it
[1:49:05] somebody
[1:49:07] will rise up
[1:49:09] and do it
[1:49:10] I believe my whole Hallelujah God has
[1:49:14] come in our hour he's given us purpose
[1:49:16] he's given us word he's given us unction
[1:49:19] to act upon it he's given us overcoming
[1:49:21] power from depressions and fears and
[1:49:23] doubts and everything that's there
[1:49:25] Satan's assault on the mind and on the
[1:49:27] spirit and on the body and it's there
[1:49:29] God's give us overcoming power to that
[1:49:31] and it's there if they don't want to
[1:49:33] receive it we're going to rise up we're
[1:49:35] going to rise up my brother and sister
[1:49:36] and do it oh I'll tell you I hope you
[1:49:39] misunderstand I'm not just excited for
[1:49:41] excited sakes I'm right here I'm looking
[1:49:44] at this realizing he's talking about me
[1:49:46] he's talking about me the whole story of
[1:49:49] my life my brother and sister every
[1:49:51] story if I gave every detail there would
[1:49:54] be times that you would say oh this is
[1:49:56] terrible that's terrible but I can look
[1:49:58] back and realize even down in the depths
[1:50:01] of Despair I was rising up
[1:50:05] I was rising up when I wouldn't hardly
[1:50:08] utter the name of Jesus Christ I thank
[1:50:10] the Lord I never used his name in vain
[1:50:12] but even I wouldn't utter the name of
[1:50:14] Jesus I was rising up even at that point
[1:50:17] I just didn't know it
[1:50:19] I didn't know it he was pulling me up
[1:50:20] out of the pit of despair
[1:50:22] he was bringing me up
[1:50:24] and he says you know what I'm going to
[1:50:26] put you in church Paul
[1:50:29] thank you Lord
[1:50:31] you put me in church
[1:50:35] you know Paul was happy
[1:50:39] my poor wife married to me for a lot of
[1:50:42] years
[1:50:46] Paul the chameleon
[1:50:49] I could go to church and people would be
[1:50:52] like God bless you brother Paul
[1:50:55] I fixed tractors
[1:50:58] I figured all kinds of things out in
[1:51:00] church and people think you're there
[1:51:01] getting blessed
[1:51:05] might find it shocking I did it to make
[1:51:07] her happy
[1:51:09] I didn't do it to make God happy
[1:51:14] but God said hey there's a day now Paul
[1:51:18] I'm going to raise you up a little
[1:51:20] higher
[1:51:23] I got raised up on that and I actually
[1:51:25] thought that that was it
[1:51:27] I thought praise the Lord I finally made
[1:51:29] it
[1:51:30] and I was there for seasons
[1:51:33] and God says
[1:51:35] okay now that you made it back to Ground
[1:51:37] Zero Paul
[1:51:39] would you like to go a little higher
[1:51:42] than something inside of me said I want
[1:51:44] to go a little higher
[1:51:48] and it's never stopped
[1:51:52] it's never stopped
[1:51:54] right because you see I've had some days
[1:51:55] I've got to see the absolute glory of
[1:51:58] God move
[1:51:59] power and authority
[1:52:02] and something in my soul says
[1:52:04] Paul
[1:52:06] you're only within the view of heavenly
[1:52:09] places
[1:52:11] you're just there as it were looking in
[1:52:13] the door come up a little higher
[1:52:17] up a little higher Paul
[1:52:19] you can do it
[1:52:21] you can see all the years it took you
[1:52:24] see sometimes Saints I hope you don't
[1:52:25] mind me putting it this way
[1:52:27] some of us are a little bit slower than
[1:52:30] others
[1:52:31] I don't mean that derogatory
[1:52:35] but he made me a promise
[1:52:38] that I would live in Heavenly places
[1:52:43] and it's still happening
[1:52:47] it's still moving
[1:52:49] and you already did
[1:52:51] my sis
[1:52:54] what year would it been that we came
[1:52:56] parents introduced to the message I
[1:52:59] always posted about when I was nine
[1:53:00] which would have been about 1970.
[1:53:05] something like that
[1:53:23] I'm just now breaking
[1:53:25] into Heavenly places
[1:53:30] and the whole time God has been saying
[1:53:33] come on Paul
[1:53:35] come on Paul
[1:53:37] come on Paul
[1:53:38] you couldn't do it Paul
[1:53:40] just step
[1:53:43] in my footsteps
[1:53:45] just follow me
[1:53:49] you know who the brave ones are on a
[1:53:51] hike
[1:53:52] is the one who sets the pace
[1:53:58] the Holy Ghost is come on Amen I'll
[1:54:01] never leave you
[1:54:03] I'm not going to take that other turn in
[1:54:05] the trail and forsake you
[1:54:08] I'll be right here
[1:54:10] keeping you guiding you
[1:54:12] don't worry about it
[1:54:14] I've never lost a one
[1:54:19] I read a or saw a video deal that had
[1:54:22] some reading on it about this Christian
[1:54:24] man that went Grizzly hunting in Alaska
[1:54:28] and he chose this particular guide
[1:54:30] because the man was a Christian
[1:54:33] and they're going through Bear Country
[1:54:36] thick brush
[1:54:38] this guy got incredibly nervous he said
[1:54:40] you could just smell bear
[1:54:44] and he was a man from a relatively large
[1:54:46] city
[1:54:47] and he said I'm walking through this
[1:54:49] brush and all I can think of is a big
[1:54:51] paw he said I had a vision of this big
[1:54:53] paw coming out
[1:54:58] and the guide would go hey where did you
[1:55:00] go
[1:55:03] and the guide stopped and says I sense
[1:55:05] something's not quite right here
[1:55:09] and he quotes scripture to him
[1:55:12] he says never fear
[1:55:14] I will lead you
[1:55:16] and guide you
[1:55:19] and then he smiles at this Hunter a big
[1:55:22] grin
[1:55:23] and he said I've never lost a one that's
[1:55:26] right
[1:55:28] even in that stage of life
[1:55:32] he said I realized
[1:55:34] I wasn't trusting God
[1:55:37] Saints
[1:55:39] trust him
[1:55:40] trust her
[1:55:42] Hallelujah we have purpose
[1:55:45] we're seeing the manifestation of it
[1:55:49] and if the churches won't receive it
[1:55:51] somebody will rise up and do it sister
[1:55:55] Ruth come we'll just call that good
[1:55:57] right there
[1:55:58] Hallelujah you know if you need a simple
[1:56:00] reminder Saints
[1:56:02] our purpose is living the word
[1:56:06] amen we don't have to be super Christian
[1:56:09] we don't have to have an answer for
[1:56:11] everything
[1:56:12] we just have to trust God
[1:56:15] because he said
[1:56:17] purpose is not in us the purpose
[1:56:20] is in him
[1:56:22] oh God bless you God bless you amen
[1:56:27] let's just sing a song or two let's just
[1:56:30] sing the song Jehovah Jireh
[1:56:32] amen let's just stand Worship the Lord I
[1:56:34] kept you a little longer than I meant
[1:56:36] Saints but
[1:56:38] oh my
[1:56:40] you know you just end up skipping over
[1:56:42] some things that leaves a little Gap or
[1:56:44] a little something in there I'll pray
[1:56:45] the Lord just those for you
[1:56:48] my whole desire for preaching what I
[1:56:51] preached today
[1:56:51] [Music]
[1:56:56] is for you to be reminded
[1:56:58] that God has purpose in your life
[1:57:01] you say but I'm not really serving me
[1:57:03] like I should well God will take you
[1:57:05] down a lot of trails to train you to
[1:57:07] trust him
[1:57:08] a lot of trails a lot of miles will be
[1:57:11] underneath your feet to bring you to a
[1:57:14] place that you can say what I recognize
[1:57:17] this
[1:57:18] I don't know if you can identify this I
[1:57:20] can identify with this come to us face
[1:57:22] to face with a trial that you have faced
[1:57:25] before in your life and God by
[1:57:26] Supernatural Divine wisdom let you know
[1:57:28] Clarity you face this battle you face
[1:57:32] this trial
[1:57:34] what are you going to do now
[1:57:38] and we realized I failed it before
[1:57:41] now I recognize who I am and I recognize
[1:57:43] what God's doing
[1:57:45] there's a purpose I'm facing this again
[1:57:47] because God doesn't allow brother Donnie
[1:57:50] Reagan did it this way I thought it was
[1:57:52] so funny and enlightening at the same
[1:57:54] time he said God will not allow you when
[1:57:58] you fail a test God's not going to allow
[1:58:00] you to just go on and forget about it
[1:58:03] and brother Donna used the platform in
[1:58:05] their church and he says some of you are
[1:58:07] going to look really funny six foot
[1:58:09] three 255 pounds sitting in that
[1:58:13] kindergarten chair
[1:58:15] but God's not going to let you go until
[1:58:19] you pass
[1:58:21] that test
[1:58:23] thank you Jesus
[1:58:24] thank you Lord
[1:58:27] oh Hallelujah

[2:03:45] to offer Hallelujah well I know I sing
[2:03:48] this song an awfully lot
[2:03:51] but as I was studying and I come to that
[2:03:54] quote that we finished on
[2:03:57] if the church won't act upon it the
[2:04:00] church won't receive it the church won't
[2:04:02] live it
[2:04:03] God will raise up somebody will and all
[2:04:07] I can say today is thank you Lord out of
[2:04:09] all of those seeds that we would say
[2:04:12] spread upon the Earth God said I'm going
[2:04:14] to raise you up
[2:04:16] and I'm going to raise you up and you up
[2:04:19] you up what a blessing amen there is a
[2:04:25] New Testament Church
[2:04:26] that is rising up and I am so happy
[2:04:29] Saints to be one of those that God chose
[2:04:32] to raise up Hallelujah
[2:04:35] [Music]
[2:04:41] crossed
