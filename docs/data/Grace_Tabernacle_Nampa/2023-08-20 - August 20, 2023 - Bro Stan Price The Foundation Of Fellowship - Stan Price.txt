[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] Jesus now for we are standing in your presence [Music] sing it again Hallelujah we are standing [Music] Holy Ground hey and I know that there are angels all around [Music] for we are standing in your presence [Music] amen you may be seated I've been to sing as I invite my wife to come up she just left but I want I want you to I need you to sing I need you to play for me Sister Sarah we're going to be singing number 1050. I'm no longer a slave but I want to share a testimony before because we'll start with the course brother that whenever we sing that's the way we sing it but I want to share testimony my daughter my oldest daughter had epilepsy for gosh I don't know probably 15 years maybe and I always struggled with that we would pray for her and and it seemed like that she would go for for several months and uh and one time I think she went for for quite a distance of time but then she would have another seizure and down in Florida how the law is I don't know how it is here but you have to be even if you're on medication you have to be seizure free for six months or what you can't drive she had little kids she would always have to depend on somebody to take her to the grocery store and so and so uh she had uh she had a seizure one time when she was out jogging or walking or something fell into a ditch and if there hadn't been somebody driving by at the time to see her you know we don't know what might have happened so herner husband had bought this German Shepherd and they got this idea that they were going to train this German Shepherd to be a service dog for her everywhere she went that dog was going to have to go it was Tethered to her I was telling brother Paul he wouldn't let her bring it to church but but she took it everywhere else I mean all our family gatherings you know when came Amy and Daniel and there was that dog and so and so she kind of struggled with it I kind of struggled with it for sure and so she said that that she kept putting fleeces before the Lord and and and and and it seemed like it kept being that she needed to keep that dog and uh and so she was in she was in Saint Augustine last year uh and brother Andrew Glover was preaching uh a Revival over the over the the weekend there Friday Saturday and Sunday and she had she said I'm going to put one more fleece before the Lord about that dog and uh and so she's sitting in service Saturday night and brother Andrew says you don't need a fleece you just need to believe God well she was delivered from epilepsy [Music] [Applause] here's the thing and this is the reason why I was sharing this testimony because that night she sent out a text to her to her mother and I and her sisters and everybody that she knew you know late at night we get this text and she says I have no more epilepsy but she says listen to what she says she says I have no more fear of having a seizure and I thought that's been it all along see that fear was that doorway see the fear and brother Branham defines fear this way he says we're afraid God won't keep his word and so this song has become almost a theme song in our church and so I wanted to sing it I know you all know it probably and we sing it maybe a little different we don't sing the uh I think it's we'll just we'll just sing it you just have to follow us brother Alex I no longer a Slave To Fear oh I am a child of God I'm no longer a Slave To Fear oh I am a child of God you unravel me with a melody you surround me with a song of Deliverance from my enemy till all my fears are gone well I'm no longer a Slave To Fear oh I am the child of God I'm no longer a Slave to fear for I am a child of God from my mother's womb you have chosen me your love has called my name [Music] I've been born again into your family your blood flows through my veins well I'm no longer a Slave To Fear [Music] oh I am a child of God I'm no longer a Slave To Fear oh I am a child of God the bridge brother you split the sea so I could walk right through it my fears were drowned in perfect life to rescue rest so I could stand and say I am a child of God who rescued me so I could stand and say I am a child of God oh I am a child of God I am a child of God amen [Music] [Applause] let's stand and turn in our Bibles started Hebrews the seventh chapter and then we'll read a scripture and and uh Revelations the fifth chapter Hebrews the seventh chapter beginning at the first verse it says for this Melchizedek king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness which is what the word Melchizedek means it means king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of peace without father without mother without dissent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually a brightest a priests continually Revelations the fifth chapter a familiar scripture I believe to all of us Revelations 5 will begin reading at verse 8. and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints now watch who is going to be singing this song it's not the 24 Elders the Holy Spirit stopped the meeting and questions and answers on the seals when brother Branham just ran right across this because someone asked him is this the raptured uh Saints and he said no and he and he and then went on to the next question and then it's like is there something wrong here you know with somebody sick you know does somebody need prayer and somebody from the audience hollers out read the scripture again and so he said they because it's the prayers of the Saints they sung that new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and open the seals thereof for that was slain and hath redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue people and Nations see that's why it can't be the 24 Elders because they're Jewish all 24 Elders are Jewish so he says and has Tomatoes Hast made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth let's bow our hearts Heavenly Father Lord you have just I just thank you so much that you have brought me to this place here this morning father among this people the the purchase of your blood father and we're just we're just looking forward to just sitting down all of us together and just enjoying the word that you have prepared for us this morning you know every need father and I don't have anything written out to say you know My Heart Lord I choose for you to lead us and to guide us and to and to take us where you want on a little journey this morning just like just like when you reveal yourself to job in the Whirlwind now father you took him on a little journey you showed him your love you showed him that that you cared it wasn't about it wasn't about the Temptation and the trial and it wasn't a result of Joe being a a bad person but it was another way that you were expressing your love to job to bring him a little higher father and you and you proved to him God you said I'm so full of love that I I know when this little this little goat was conceived and and watch it's fixing the bear it's fixing to bring forth birthday and you see this field it's it's no man even touches this but I take care of it and I water it and you were just expressing your love to job in such a way and father it's our heart's desire for you to take us on that same Journey here this morning and into you and and I believe if that happens if we allow it to happen father if we set our thinking aside we will walk out of this place and not be the same people that walk in and that's our hearts desire in Jesus name bless your people we pray amen God bless you you can be seated you know that song the first time I heard it I was at my daughter's Church in Canada and that verse where it says you unravel me you know it because you know I have the same as I have a lot of favorite scriptures but I have one that rises above all of them which I shared with you last night but I I mean I have a lot of favorite quotes I have quotes all taped in my Bible but there's a quote that that has meant more to me probably than any other quote and that's when brother Branham is is about to preach the token message which he said this is the most important message outside of the seals this is the most important message that I've ever preached and he said he said right in the beginning before he'd even started talking he says I had to unfold myself amen amen and live among it before I could say these things see we have to unfold ourselves and and what that mean what that meant to brother Branham I don't know but what it means to me is I have to just unfold all of my thoughts and all my ideas and I have to be prepared to live among this word and when I can experience that word without my human thinking involved that's when I can share it amen amen and that's and you know Jesus said the words that I speak or spirit in their life your words if you're just going to quote the prophet that's not your that's not his words right I mean people quote the prophet the same as the denominations quote the church quote the Bible but it's when the source of that yeah is him then it contains his life and it'll do amazing amazing things and so we just submit ourselves to him that's what we this is what we do I want to call this message this morning I want to call it I thought about well I might call it the Melchizedek the priest but that really I mean that's what we're talking about but I want to call this the foundation of Fellowship the foundation of Fellowship you know there's three things that that we talk a lot about and and one of them is love all right we talk about God's love but do we really understand God's love because God's love is a person okay and I'm and I'm thinking I'm thinking well I'll use one of brother branham's uh illustrations he said there was this woman that that uh their house caught on fire and and she was out hanging clothes on the line and and the baby was in the second floor you know you remember the story where she was horribly disfigured and so she runs into that house through the fire because she wrapped herself in one of those blankets and then when she picks up the baby she realized she doesn't have enough blanket to cover both of them so she wraps that baby she runs out of that house she's burnt up terribly she looks horribly disfigured can you say that she doesn't love but the Bible says that those that love are born of God can you say that she's born of God because she did that no you can't so maybe the love of God is something different and something greater see and that's the way that's the way I look at at Fellowship because Fellowship is you know I've I've I've been through I've been in around the message for many years and you then you get together with somebody and you talk about the football game or whatever you know I mean or talk about the food that you were eating or the clothes that you're wearing or what you did and everything and then you come away man that was Great Fellowship there's no Fellowship there that wasn't Fellowship amen and then you can even come together and sometimes talk about the word and it's still not really Fellowship because Fellowship is a blending together it's it's when it's when I don't know maybe it's when I can start a sentence and you can finish it you know because we're so Blended together and that's what happens see the devil you know I don't know how you view the pandemic but I saw it as an absolute assault on the bride of Christ because he doesn't care about these people out here he's already got them but what he was trying to do is he was trying to keep this body from coming together he was doing everything he could to to destroy the fellowship in this bride and I know and I'm not this is just how I handled it as a as a minister we continued having church because we were in Florida our governor said we need to be in church that's what he said I heard his words he said we need to be in church right now and so most of the churches shut down but uh but we kept on going and so I Remember December well it was that it was it was it was right before that was right at right after Christmas I think it was Christmas on was on a Friday and and then and then there was Saturday and Sunday morning I was to preach and uh and I I woke up Saturday morning I had a terrible fever you know high fever and then and like all of my deacons had covet you know several people in the church had coveted and so I was on this this little chat thing that Barry Coffey had set up and he just put my name in there so I was part of part of this and so it was like 80 ministers or 100 ministers from around the world so I went on this and I said Brothers I need prayer I'd like prayer because you know I haven't been tested but I got a high fever and everything and I've got to go to the pulpit tomorrow because I don't have anybody to take my place and so you know they agreed and everything and so so I got this i got this message from a brother that was on there and he said he said brother he said if if your deacons have got coveted you got covered and he said you need to reconsider having an in-person service tomorrow and I said brother it meant and it really meant a lot to me but I I said brother I said the early church every time that they came together there was a chance they might not survive and I said so what they got in this coming together was more important than their own life and so I said that's the kind of church that I have there's people that didn't come and and for their own reasons or whatever but there was a group that said if if you're having Church we're going to be there and so we kept on having Church you know through the whole thing no no fear I mean I stood right In a Pulpit and said Cove would come and get me you know if you can get past now the token I know Brothers I know I know ministers that passed away I know Minister's wives that passed away from covid so you can't say the covet's going to keep or the the token's going to keep me from dying but the token is going to keep anything that's not God's Will from happening to you and so there was there was no fear of that but anyway this Fellowship is is you go back to the to the very beginning okay and that's and and that's what I like to do because because that's really what this message has taken us back to is the beginning and if we can see the beginning we know that we know that we know the end we know the whole thing because there's God's plan right there and so I think I mentioned last night that you know that that Adam was created in theophany form right God made him in his own image God was logos he was he was now God didn't didn't make Adam the logos but as far as his condition he was the same he was theophany he was a spirit man that could respond to the word see and so so then God put that into human flesh and that's the Nate that's the way that God would come and walk without him they heard the voice of God walking in the garden and so whatever form that was that God was in he interacted with Adam because Adam had access to something he had access to his own soul he had access that was Adam's own control tower that's right and he would blend with with God they would walk together and that was what maintained Adam's life that was the Tree of Life the the perspective that Adam could eat one time from that tree and and live forever is not right because Adam's life is not the life of almighty God it's not a self-sustaining life it is a is I could say that it was a Perpetual life Adam had to have that relationship with God in order to continue walking okay and so so when Adam fell he was cut off from that right he didn't have access he didn't lose his soul but God said the day that you eat thereof that day that you die because he did he'd lost access to that and he and he began by choice because that's how Satan had tempted them he began by choice to go by his own human thinking that's it right and in fact in fact here's how I illustrate it because when God when God came down and he said Adam Adam where are you all right here's the god that created everything that knew everything that stands out he knows everything that's going on but he's challenging Adam because he's saying where is that part of you that I fellowship with what have you done to that and so it then it became an uh uh a dealing with Adam in a human way through his mind see but that thing and and here's where here's where I kind of bring Melchizedek into this because it's just one of my ways that I kind of look that's why I like Brother David and I I think I get a we get along because we're like out of the box kind of guys you know I mean that's just you know when you hear us preachers no telling what's going to come out you know it's maybe some kind of Oddball angle but but now listen if you ran it if you run the genealogy you run to chronology here's a reason that it's in the scripture it's not the Boris to put it to sleep whenever we're reading it and so you see Adam was you know in you know Adam lived so many years and and he began sons and daughters and then he died and so forth it goes on down and you'll find that Adam there's very little separation between Adam and Noah now think about Adam think about Adam and Eve they were the only people on the planet that knew what they fell from and so and so they're like when when Abel or when Seth would bring up his offering and and and Adam would say man you know you get some Joy or or a little place of Fellowship out of bringing this offering it is nothing compared to what it was when God would come down and walk with us in the cool of the day and blend with us and and love us and take care of us and so this went this this is my kind of little out of the box kind of thinking this Adam shared this story you know I can see them sitting sitting around the campfire with his 800 grandchildren and telling them about this you know I mean about all of this that that happened to them well these these stories went on down well did you know that Noah lived all the way into the time of Abraham Noah and Abraham were were lived the same amount of time I mean they were they live they were alive together and so I would imagine that Noah related this story to Abraham about this great place of fellowship and so Abraham's like man that would be so great to have that well in Genesis to what is it the 15th chapter I think it is and Melchizedek came out and served Abraham communion now I want you to think about something disappearing of Melchizedek to Abraham had nothing to do with sin all right Abraham didn't have to bring an offering he didn't have to bow down before Melchizedek Melchizedek came and met him and he served in communion and when he served him communion Abraham said this is what Adam was talking about this is this place of Fellowship that Adam was talking about and he said you must be the same one that walked with Adam so here's my tithe here's here's everything I'm giving you everything and the Bible says in Hebrews the 11th chapter now here's where here's this is really interesting because Hebrews 11 chapter says that Abraham looked for a city which have foundations he wasn't looking for just any city was looking for a specific City which hath foundations whose Builder and maker is God find that anywhere in the Old Testament it's not there it's not there and Paul didn't explain it but the prophet did yeah because he said the reason that Abraham looked for that city is because he had met the king of that City but watch what happened with this with this communion Abraham wasn't just looking for any City he was looking for a city which housed foundations because that was where he was amen see the walls the the foundations the apostles you know the the Abraham and the the Patriarchs the gates of the city everything he's part of that City so in this communion in this communion that Abraham enjoyed with Melchizedek was revealed Abraham's own election and so that is what opened the door for Abraham to be the the father of our faith I mean the Royal seed and so this this this scripture we read here you know it's really interesting because you know brother Brandon speaks of and who is this Melchizedek he talks about Melchizedek to paraphrase he talks about Melchizedek being one of the Mysteries revealed under the seals and yet he preached Melchizedek the great prince in 1955. before the seals open so there's a way that you can look at it and you could say okay Melchizedek is God no question about it you know theologians there's Jews that believed that Melchizedek was Shem they that's what they believe but we know Melchizedek was God because it says without father without mother without beginning of days without ending of Life he's identified king of righteousness king of Peace king of Salem king of Jerusalem you know and and and so from this perspective you can say and the prophet comes out and preaches in 1955 that this is God but see after the opening of the seals when we sing a new song and the prophet's involved in that yeah when we sing a new song and it says thou has made us unto our God Kings and Priests well Melchizedek is the only one that's identified in the Bible as being a king and a priest until Revelations 5 and verse 10. and it it includes us now see so whatever Melchizedek was is now revealed in the bride and that's why brother Branham comes out in 1965 10 years later and says who was this milk something that was revealed under the seals because the sales is the Revelation to you that's father the prophet said well the Revelation it's the revelation of Jesus Christ well that's what I said the revelation of you you know when when sister Jerry's sang that song it made me think of that quote you know it's the rising of the Sun flesh of his flesh bone of his bone power of his power she is him oh how about that okay let's why don't we say it flesh of his flesh bone of his bone Powers power I am him [Music] I am him see it's real easy for us to put it in the third person but to be able to recognize that that is who I am that's what this message is meant for that's what is and that's what it's saying that's what he's saying right here has made us unto our God Kings and Priests this is not this is not we're going to be Kings there's something coming that's going to happen we are right now Kings and Priests and so what does God want to do see this ties right back into what we were preaching last night about God's rest because God's rest is for him to walk without him that's that was God's rest and and Paul was telling us whatever you do don't don't not get that because when the Holy Spirit there's born in you it is going to have the same exact desire that God himself has it's going to and see that's why and I got this quote and I'm just gonna I'm just gonna read it uh I didn't know whether I would read it or not but this is one I don't have in my Bible and I should have and I'm I apologize for that but that day of Calvary you you know this is probably everybody knows exactly where I'm going but there's something he says here that that I want you to get he says on that day on Calvary he says now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself so how should we be if we have that same spirit then we should live for others so he says he never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine brother Brandon said in the same message he says you go when you buy coal for the Widow or you buy a man a suit that he needs a suit but if you're doing that because that's what you're supposed to do you're a hypocrite I'll share with Sharon with brother Paul did a few years ago there was a there was a man a kid really teenager whatever went into a school and began shooting the school up killed a bunch of children all right did you know you probably read it in the newspaper but did you know there was a policeman standing outside that school and he would not go into that school because I don't know why he was taken to court and he was exonerated for whatever reason but he had a reason for not going to school but but just for illustration purposes I'm going to say he was close to retirement you know when he didn't want to risk his life because you know he'd worked all his life and he's fixing to because he was an older older man and he's fixing to retire man and he's not going to go in because these kids are a bunch of you know whatever and so he's not going to risk his life saving him but if his son had been in that school it would be a completely different thing and if we do things for others because we're supposed to we're just a hireling we're just a hireling but if it's because this generally this is genuinely my creation because the god that created this lives in me and has the same desire and love of this creation than I do then that's genuinely eternal life because that's God's own life but he said when you have when you live your life for others you have an eternal life or when you live your life for yourself when you live your life for yourself you have an eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when they come in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he'd live for others you listen to this you receive eternal life by receiving that day that's so what did we see last night that day was a total and complete and finished work there was nothing else had to be done I don't care how I don't care how you look at your flesh Christ finished it right there and so if we will enter into what happened on that day that is eternal life because our election places us as bride of Christ it places us with God's Own desire for his creation now see that's where we come to to being priests see being a king okay you're a king you're a ruler all right but you know biblically the word ruler means to Shepherd it means to take care of you know it's like I mean years ago you're like man you know one of the promises of the church age is I'm going to rule of nations with a wrought iron I can't wait that guy that cut me off in traffic man I'm fixing to bust him you know but see this is a Shepherd this is a shepherd's staff and you're and you're going however you imagine God in the garden That's the Way You Are that's who you are and even we see it over in Revelations 22 which we've which we're doing real good on time so we're gonna we'll probably go there but I want you to see that that the word priest or priesthood in the Bible if you enter if you look in a search engine or whatever in the New Testament you'll come up with 153 hits 153 scriptures that have the word priest or priesthood in it 114 are those are in the gospels and the book of Acts and they deal strictly strictly with the priests and the Pharisees or the high priest of that time or the challenges that Jesus was getting so we're not interested in being that kind of a priest right and then in the book of Hebrews because no other place in the Epistles except for the book of Hebrews in the book of First Peter does the word priest or priesthood exist and then and in First Peter I think it's two times in the Book of Revelations it's three times and all five of those occurrences are you and then in the book of Hebrews this one little book that's 13 chapters long the word priest or priesthood exists 34 times so God is is showing us something and we think we think okay priests to be a priest okay I'm the one that administers this this you know the sacraments or around no what a priest is is he's an administer of the kingdom of God and so we are administers of the kingdom of God we are the people that Romans 8 said there are the all creation that's Adam not just the mountains and the Seas and the grass and and all that but Adam is crying out looking for the Tree of Life and you know they are just as redeemed as we are but until we take our position they have nowhere to come right and that's why the prophet said in Revelations 5 when he's preaching this in the breach he said John wept why did John Wayne weep because the prophet said that that John wet because if the lamb did not claim the book everything was lost okay so that means that what has happened in this day and I know you'll understand how I mean this I'm not saying that overshadows the cross but the cross happened and yet if the lamb doesn't claim that which is perfect purchase then creation is lost why is creation lost if he doesn't claim this because creation has nowhere to come back to the Tree of Life unless the bride takes her position unless we come to a revelation that we are Kings and Priests right now not not somewhere in the future not when there's a new city in fact let's let's just look at something real quick before we because the thing that the thing that I'm not going to say fight because it's not a fight It's just sometimes we have this perspective all right Hallelujah I'm saved it's done praise God I'm I'm eternally secure I'm never going to be lost I'm walking this life and one day there's a city because we see the city coming down in Revelations 21 you know we put that on a chronology like okay well that City doesn't show up till Revelations 21. but let's go to Hebrews 12 and see what see what Paul says because Paul in the Hebrews 12 is showing the difference between Mount Sinai and Mount Zion okay and he's explaining something he's saying we've not come to Mount Sinai we've not come to this place of fear we've not come to this place where God is a consuming fire necessarily in that sense to where if we touch it we're going to die we not come to that but he says in verse 22 but you are come to Mount Zion you are come he says and unto the city of the Living God well I thought that the New Jerusalem was out here you are the New Jerusalem your position is New Jerusalem you are the Touchstone of of God's whole creation right and watch he says to the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly the church and the Church of the firstborn which is written in heaven and to God the judge of all the spirit of just men made perfect to Jesus the mediator of a New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel there are eight things here eight things that we are come to that Paul tells us and it's all tied with our election it's all tied to a finished Redemption it's all tied to everything is over and and and I and I'll tell you something very personal to me that about a year and a half ago I was preaching on this and I'm looking at these and I've and I've got these things listed out and I'm studying and everything and there's part of this I just didn't understand and so of course the prophet you know which is sometimes it's more common than not that you find a scripture like this you this is amazing I know the prophet must appreciate on this didn't even touch it didn't didn't he quote it so in some people's book brother Paul we're not allowed to to comment on this but not so so I have no you know you look what the commentators you know it didn't it it didn't ring the bell and so I'm like I'm down on my knees and I'm Lord I want to what does this mean and you know what the Lord spoke to my heart said what do you see you are come to this what do you see that's the challenge what do you see it's not what brother Branham saw brother Branham saw the right thing but if I'm just going to quote what brother Branham saw I'm just saying you know there was a story years ago I heard this you know I mean you take it for what it's worth it's just hearsay but there was a certain big name in the message and he's in a motel room with brother Branham and and brother Branham sees the pillar of fire in that room and he says brother so and so I'm not going to name him he said brother so and so don't you see that Pillar of Fire and brother so and so said no but I see the one that does that's not good enough for me it's not good enough for me we have got to have a personal experience with the pillar of fire and with the word of God that's happened in this hour and that's what will change us okay so so let's go over to Revelations 22 we're doing real good here let's go to Revelations 22. and we'll take this little thought and then we're going to go back to Song of Solomon all right and we know we know just a drop back in Revelations 21 it says in verse 9 it says There came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talk with me now who was that angel I have my own thoughts because he revealed the city the same one revealed mystery Babylon so it may just be the same one that we know but anyway come hither and I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit into a great and high mountain and showed me a great City holy Jerusalem descending from God out of heaven so the city is the bride the city is not the streets and the buildings and the walls the city is the bride okay and watch what Revelations 22 said and he showed me a pure River of Water of Life clear as Crystal proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the land so so we can look at it and I'm not saying there's not a city because you listen to Future home the second half of that tape brother branham's described in a literal place but if we don't catch the spirituality of this thing we're never there's never going to be a city for us right and so he says he saw the a river of the Water of Life clearest Crystal proceeding out of the Throne of God now where did the prophet say the Throne of God is in you right the Kingdom of Heaven is in you right and and and Jesus said in John 7 37 that out of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Water so this is a description of me amen and he goes on and he says and in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the singular the Tree of Life there's not 10 there's not two there's not a hundred there's not five thousand we say well there's you know there's 50 people here or whatever there's 50 trees of life no there's only one tree of life many branches one tree so everywhere John saw was the singular Tree of Life which bear 12 manner of fruits yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healings of the Nations all right okay I'm confused now though because the leaves of the tree that's Divine Fellowship that's the prophet said that restoration of the broad tree the leaves were divine Fellowship amen so the leaves of the tree were further healing but I'm thinking now we're in the new heavens and new earth what needs healing all right this is important what needs what needs healing some searches in the message everything brother random said and the closest I could find to a definition of what what this is or or will be or whatever brother bam said well these two Nations they used to be at war with each other and now they've come together so there was a healing there well I'm not because I believe that I'm not just because the prophet said it because it's the principle it's the truth but yet let's say a million years from now is is is Egypt and Israel going to be coming up and saying oh wait yeah a million years ago we used to hate each other see there's not going to be any memory of that yeah right there in a whole different economy you know all the tears are wiped away there's no remembrance of sin you know and so and so I'm thinking what is this word healing mean and if you'll go back to Matthew 24 and in Matthew 24 Jesus identifies what's going on right here because Matthew 24 and we heard brother Vitale say it that you know that that Matthew 24 is the three questions it's the first six seals and the seventh seal is Christ he's sitting there you know so he was the seventh seal but but then after after he opens the first six seals it's it's Parables about the coming of the Lord and so you have to catch that this is about the coming of the Lord and he says in verse 44 therefore be also ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household the word household here is the same word as healing in Revelations 22. and so Matthew 24 is dealing with a people who when he comes are taking care of the household of God and that doesn't mean you're taking care of your brother sitting next to you it means that you have the spirit of God and a desire to take care of everything you're grieved when you see people not just grieve with sin but seeing people that are out of their position because you want to see because you have the mind of Christ you want to see things I remember for years I never cared about anything but we lived we lived in a little house we didn't live in a golf course neighborhood but we were across from the golf course and there was a way that we would drive to church on Sunday morning that was through that neighborhood and I remember something changing for me and I was so grieved that people were mowing their lawns I was so grieved that people were playing golf and not honoring God on that day I mean we're not we're not Sabbath worshipers but the prophet said we honor that that's right you know the prophets I've heard stories where people were throwing a ball in his side yard and he told him to stop it's the Sabbath day you know we shouldn't be doing our household chores on the oh you're a legalist no I'm I'm primed to follow the word I'm trying to follow the message of the hour but there's something inside of me that says let's let's set a day aside and respect God and spend our time in the in the in the kingdom of God and I know brother Paul was you know he had to go do stuff and I know there's things that have to be done sometimes but we don't plan to do it it's like people that plan not to come to church on Wednesday night Grieves me you know it Grieves me because because this maybe is a little too pastoral brother but I mean you know Hebrews 10 you know forsake not the assembling that's not Church attendance it's something that's happening Among Us right now that's coming that we want to be together and that's why it Grieves me to hear these internet Ministries it Grieves me to see people that are out just listening to tapes by themselves and they have no interaction no Fellowship no accountability because the basis of the whole thing is fellowship and we should be coming back to this position that's what a priest is a priest is somebody that is sharing the kingdom of God and that's what Jesus is saying here he says who then is the wise faithful and wise servant whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household to give him meat in due season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing verily I say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his Goods so here's the question all right there's a principle that I look at in the day of Paul now Paul sowed the word but there were even things because Paul was caught beyond the curtain of time there were things he couldn't talk about amen he saw things he couldn't talk about did in my own pet Doctrine kind of a way I believe is revealed here at the end time but people had the Holy Ghost but they could only go as far into the Holy Ghost as what there was word available and so even in the Dark Ages where you say hey nobody had nothing the prophet said they received the word for the day they had they were they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost but let's say the dirt the Dark Ages is so dark that I don't know if you know this but Colombo didn't even live in the Dark Ages he came and went before that that period of the fire attire even started so that's how dark it was the messenger couldn't even live in that age right and so but they were born again because they believed that message and and and they Rose to whatever word was available in their day so the words being restored you know when it was back in the late day of Lutheran the day of of Wesleyan it wasn't just Luther and Wesley those were the principal Messengers but there was great men through that time and God is restoring his word and people are rising to match that word right but what kind of people should we be if we're living in the fullness of the world there's not one thing that hinders us from coming into a complete ought to be fully redeemed position and that's who we are and that's what that's what this eating the book is about because eating the book is is feeding on who I am that's right amen it's it's it's not like okay the preacher man he got long today man if if you're listening to if you're sitting in a lawyer's office and you're listening to the will be be read and it's your will you are wide awake listening for how much stuff you get and you know the fear is that people just aren't engaged you know they're not engaged with with what it is and so so you see the principle here that the the fullness of the word will put us in now I know I and I said it last night we're gonna make mistakes we're going to make mistakes till we get out of here but there's a perspective and I'll and I deal with it this way you know what Divine Healing is Divine Healing is not God is going to heal me Divine Healing as I am healed right now and and my declaration that healing is the absolute substance of my healing and I don't care how much symptoms I have I don't care what the doctor says I don't care about any of that I know I am healed right now and so I'm standing in this position and the prophet said we we have rapturing faith so rapturing faith is not I'm going to be rapture but it's that I am right now entering into this condition and I don't care what kind of circumstances testify against me I'm going to believe God's word because that's where my Revelation comes from that's who I am and so God is looking for a people and Luke he says in a different way he says when the son of man comes will he find faith on the Earth because that faith on the earth is not your faith it's his faith it's his virtues perfected in a bride which is what should happen if the fullness of the word is waved before us then that's what it is right now let's get I just really felt I woke up at four o'clock this morning I'm thinking about these things and I couldn't go back to sleep and so the Lord just was speaking to my heart and said go go to Song of Solomon now Song of Solomon is a is a special special book to me and I just share a little personal thing well I mean I'm looking at looking at song with Solomon of course we study these things all the time you know but then I found out that in the Jewish religion there are four books that they don't let any of their children touch until they're mature enough and one of them is Esther the Book of Esther Proverbs Ecclesiastes and song because Song of Solomon is is is they think it's too erotic you know and it is I mean it's very but it's but it's the most beautiful that's right book in in the it's one of the most beautiful books in the Bible it's it's pure poetry and I and I went I I I was feeling it was probably back in 2015 or 16 or whatever and I was feeling definitely LED to preach on Song of Solomon so I got up and it was in January and I got up and we took we took the first chapter of Song of Solomon and I go through 17 verses here I go through that first chapter in one service and I'm like okay well there's eight chapters so that'd be eight Services sometimes you feel pretty good when you have something laid out in front of you you know and you know the Lord's one and so when I got done with that message that day the Lord spoke to my heart and he said you remember that brother Branham was hunting with that Indian guy and they're going up to hunt elk and the Indian guy is telling brother Branham what is your hurry and brother Brandon says well I'm going up where the L car an Indian says elk live there they'll be there when we get there he says he says to end in takes takes one step and look them nine times and so the Lord was telling me slow down you are missing what's going on I preached 64 messages on the Song of Solomon 64 messages and it was amazing but this fourth chapter I just want to read a little bit of this this scripture because see it has to do with our position that's what we're interested in we exalt Christ as if Christ is out here but but Christ is in us and it's the positional placing of a bride and I'm not and I'm not saying and maybe I'm out even out of because I I don't know when it doesn't I'm just going to tell you my heart I'm seeing the message get into a lot of psychology and it's marriage counseling and and financial counseling and all this stuff what kind of thing will not be fixed by our positional placing what kind if we know who we are it will make me treat my wife right it will make me deal with my finances right it will fix everything in my life because it will be as if Christ is living and so that's that's the way I choose there's a scripture in second Peter you know I mean in the first chapter and he's just gone through the statue of perfect man and everything and and then he says as long as I'm In the Flesh I'm going to bring you in remembrance of these things so that's who I am maybe you know if I preach here all the time maybe your man brother Stan if he just would quit talking about the rest all the time you know but I am going to keep bringing us into remembrance amen of an eternal position in Christ amen until we all step in and I'll tell you what I'm not saying I've arrived but I tell you what it never gets old to me I re I remember my pastor probably the last couple of years that he ministered before he before he decided to step down because he I think he knew Alzheimer's was coming and everything but he's like preaching on the eldership that we should be stepping up I mean Elders Among Us you know when he would go through the early church and he and he preached it and and people were saying gosh when is he going to get done with this eldership thing and I thought as soon as we get it as soon as we see the value of what he's looking at here you know and so this this this fourth chapter let's begin let's begin and you know that this is this is the bride and Christ bride and Christ you know I mean it's talking back and forth and it says in verse 9 and this is the bridegroom talking to the bride he says thou has ravished my heart my sister my spouse thou has ravished my heart with one of thine eyes with one chain of thy neck what this literally said this is a very poetic term that's in it's in Hebrew literature and what and what the basis of what he's saying is you put heart in me but there's even a deeper meaning that I was reading I was reading this this man that knows a lot about Hebrew and a lot about the the not tradition but the uh origin of things and and and and literature and stuff and so he looks at it he says this word ravish really means you unbarked me all right now think about what that means Brother David knows that a tree I I mean I'm like I don't know anything about trees and I always thought like okay here's a tree the life's in the middle but did you know that the life of the tree is right under the bark and the bark is is the tree's protection and what he is saying to the bride is I'm taking off all of my protection I'm taking you completely into myself and and and it's as if a a great Soldier comes back from a battle you know what he's got all his armor and everything on and he comes in through the door of the home and he takes all the armor off because he's in a safe haven well God looks at that in you amen amen I mean it's so beautiful the way but he says let's let's go down because this is good how fair is thy love my sister my spouse watch he calls her sister you know and I wondered about that but see he could call her my spouse but in our human way of thinking a spouse is something that begins and it could end but you can never not be the brother of a sister and so he's saying that there's a tie here there's a connection here that's greater than just a human thought of marrying somebody and so so he says he says uh it's better than thy love than Wine and the smell of thine ointment and all spices thy lips oh my spouse drop as the honeycomb honey and milk are under thy tongue and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon now watch this a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring shut up a fountain sealed and that's what we were for seven Church ages because we didn't know what we were and who we were and even in Romans 8 it talks about the spirit itself deals it speaks instead of us because we don't know what to say we don't know what to pray we don't know the will of God so we're praying things I remember my pastor one of the last times he spoke for us he said I prayed and prayed and prayed for things and thank God he didn't give to me yeah that's the truth because because there's a there's the spirit itself is groaning inside of us with with prayers but see that's what I see that's what I see that's the point of prayers of the Saints in Revelations 5 9 because the opening of the book has taken away the veil of the Flesh and we know the will of God and we don't just pray but we actually declare the word that's the speaking of the word oh we could go into that we did the other day it somewhere somewhere we preached but there's a quote in in Hebrews and that's Hebrews uh questions answered in Hebrews part three and I was looking for everything that I could find that brother Branham said about the tree of life and in this quote brother Branham says in that tree talking about the Tree of Life in that tree dwells prayer I thought wow what does that mean because I always thought prayer is like I'm asking God for something see when you're asking God for something the other half of that prayer is god-given so in that tree in the tree of life that we are dwells the answer to prayer you see that's the speaking of the word that's when God has taken preeminence and preeminence is not meaning that okay he's got two percent of my life and football's got a one percent and cooking has one percent and all this you know we have a big long list but he's he's first I want to talk one time at one of our ministers meeting about preeminence of Christ and her brother said oh I said that just means he's first preeminence means he's the only thing that's right he's the only thing he's the control tower you still have your five senses all right I don't want to get in the areas of spirit and soul because that's a kind of a question you know I mean people with terminology everything but I will I do know this my brother Brandon went to the board and then the message at North at night he drove three circuits circles and he says that's you he said that's God Amen so I'm thinking okay and me I got this middle circle you know and that's where kind of the question is you know is that Soul or Spirit Well it's actually scripturally it's the spirit but the terminology of the Prophet used especially toward the end is that's the soul that's right but in but in the Bible the word Soul talks about the whole life right right so it's the terminology is different but let's stay with that terminology so in that soul is the attribute that's the seed of God that's who you are and outside of that in the second realm there's memory conscious reason and affection imagination right and then on the outside of that is is you know see feel taste smelling here you know five senses and there's nothing wrong with that and when the prophets said that I'm thinking well God has memory conscious reason affection imagination right because I remember in in excuse me whenever uh Samson is standing there with us with his arm on the pillars and he said God remember me amen he says I don't want my thought of all my failures I don't want my thought of my womanizing I don't want my thought of of of of giving away the secret of my strength I don't want it I don't want you to remember that I want your memory of your original Commission of me and so he pushes the walls and the place fell down right so God's memory then in in Isaiah 1 I think it is or somewhere come let us reason together so there's reasoning you know God has affections God loves things God hates things amen well God doesn't have imagination imagination is not Disney World imagination means a plan it means a purpose okay that's what that word means if you have imagination you are you're formulating a plan right it's not some kind of fantasy land thing so God has these qualities but how are God's qualities fed from the inside that's right because that attribute that soul that that who God is and and you put it on a chart and the arrows are going out and so he has a memory that had that came from his soul he had a memory he has an affection that comes from his soul he has a all these things but see when we come in the world we're the opposite because we came in the world without real access to who we are in our soul is this okay we don't have access really we get mixed signals you know we have okay I want I want a better life I want something I want a better life and we buy a new car but really what we're crying out for is is a life with God right but so we walk through this life and I got and I got I got taste I got smell okay so I smell something oh that's bad all right so now I have fed my memory from the outside you see and I'm not going to do that again uh like you like brother Paul and I were talking about this morning about brother Branham said the woman that she's cooking the the sausage on the on the stove you know when she Burns her hand well she's got a feeling and brother Branham said if she would just not fear and just go on doing what she's doing it would be all right but she runs off you know she goes and gets the unguin teen I mean that kind of dates you if you know what onion team is But but so she's got a memory that's been fed by her feeling but see when we're born again that's what brother Brandon referred to when we have a new control tower so now we have something in us that's driving us from a different direction right and so that's what he's saying here you're a garden enclosed amen you're a well you're a spring your spring shut up you're a fountain sealed and so something has to happen for for that to be released and for every and and for you to step into this position of living for others because you can't do it correctly in a human way right and so he says he says verse 13 thy plants are an orchard or pomegranates oh I gotta stop on that okay got to stop on that we're sharing that with with the the Saints there I forget where it was we were I think it was at the Spanish Church talking about the pomegranates how many have ever wondered about the pomegranates on the on the priest robe I have I wondered what in the world is that and you know brother Branham would describe okay it's it's described there's a bell and a pomegranate Bella and a pomegranate you know and so brother Brandon would describe those bells that that priest had to walk holy holy holy under Lord those bells made a certain noise but I wonder what in the world does the word pomegranate what does that have to do with anything and so I was at my daughter's in Canada I think it was last year or sometime year before last and I'm studying these words and I love following words in the scripture all right because you can take and I've got some books that that you know you can cross the Greek word over to the Hebrew word and if you can get to the Hebrew word every Hebrew word comes to a two-letter or three-letter root word and the and the meaning of that two or three letter root word influences everything in those words I mean it becomes the basis of what those words mean so I'm following this and I'm reading Revelations 10 you know verse 8 to 11 which we should and it says you know eat the book and why do you eat the book because you must prophesy right you must prophesy okay that's the kind of brother Prophet brother Branham was he wasn't an Old Testament Prophet that the word came to that he came out of the Wilderness but he was a first fruits of a bride that is a deliverer of the word okay and so and so I'm looking at this word so I so I cross it over to the to the to the Hebrew equivalent and do you know that the root word of prophet prophesy prophecy is the word seed so that a seed is what comes in Prophecy now here's where it goes good did you know that the pomegranate is a fruit that has more seeds than any other seed so think about this because a robe to me I mean you look at Second Corinthians 5 and it talks about being clothed Revelation 3 talks about being clothed so theophany is a garment we wear right it is a condition it's a low cost condition to the bride and just maybe just maybe and I'm not saying this is the the full understanding of it but it's what I it's what I see when that woman touched the border of of Jesus garment okay the prophet said she had no scripture you told her to do that but there was an election inside of her and said if I could if I could get one of those seeds from the high priest garment then that will be for my healing you see who you are amen creation is looking for a place where the fruit amen twelves to where the seeds can be expressed and so that's what he says a garden closes thy plants are as an orchard of pomegranates with Pleasant fruits camphor spiknerd spikner and saffron calamus cinnamon with all trees of a frankincense myrrh aloes and Chiefs spices and watch this a fountain of gardens a well of living Gardens and streams from Lebanon awake o Northwind and Come Thou South and blow upon my garden that the spices thereof May flow out let my beloved come into his garden and eat his Pleasant fruits this is the seventh seal right here right brother David this is the seventh seal let him come into his garden so that the spices can come out and it and it's the Fulfillment verse 1 of chapter five I am come into my garden my sister my spouse I've gathered my myrrh and my spice and I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey I have drunk with my wine with my milk eat eat o friends God eat oh friends drink drink abundantly yes oh beloved amen do you love him amen Amen brother Alex if he could come to the to the pan I want to sing a I want to sing that song I Give Myself Away you sing it a little bit differently I think here than than we do at home or somebody sister or somebody can come to the piano because I am not an acapello singer I don't know what the number is brother I give myself away is the name of it let's start with the with the chorus and sing this with me we're not let's all stand let's sing because this is a word this is a a solemn hour and you know I have I have been in the message a long time and like it was like all about man if I could just learn enough if I could just listen to tapes enough if I could just pray enough I will finally have achieved and I realized it's all about surrender it's all I have to do is surrender you know I may said it last night or said it several times but brother Brenner said in perfect strength and perfect weakness he said it's not problem the problem's not that we're not strong enough that's right he said the problem is we're not weak enough because we have to to master the thought of human ability that we can't do it and so we are the body that he wears so all we have to do is give ourselves to him and you know what he knows exactly what he wants done with his word so let's sing this I Give Myself Away Give Myself Away so you can use me I Give Myself Away thank you Lord I give myself away so you can use me here I stand Here I Am Lord my life is in your hands Lord I'm Longing To your desires revealed in me I Give Myself Away [Music] I give myself away so you can use me I Give Myself Away give myself away so you can use me take my heart take my life as a Living Sacrifice all my dreams all my plans Lord I give them in your hands I Give Myself Away [Music] I give myself away so you can use me I Give Myself Away I give myself away so you can use me I'd like I'd like to make a comment here if I can and then I'm going to invite brother Tim to come up to to finish singing a song but I have to share a story because we sing we're singing this song I Give Myself Away do we really believe that are we really believing that we're giving ourself away because I want to share a story which I've shared all over everywhere I go there was a man in Venezuela and his name is Daniel Pacheco and he was going to a Revival meeting and he was on a bus and like they do in those countries the Police Stopped the bus and they searched the bus and they found drugs and they said okay and they lined everybody up whose drugs are these and and the bus driver pointed it brother Daniel said they're his drugs and he said no they're not all I have is this backpack that's all I'm taking I'm on a way to it they didn't believe him they arrested him they arrested the guy who fessed up that they were his drugs and he said this guy has nothing but it didn't matter they didn't believe him they arrested Daniel Pacheco Daniel Pacheco had a wife he has two kids and his daughter and his and his wife was six months pregnant Daniel Pacheco goes to prison and he and he just got out this last spring but he had been in prison for eight or ten years in the message a message believer who had a wife and a whole family but when he got to prison he met a bunch of Believers and said we've been praying God would send us a passage so are we are we that sacrificed in our life that that because this is like okay God I am committed to you as long as things are going the way I want them to go but you know there's a scripture in Matthew 25 there's a great Throne there's a great judgment goats and the Sheep and you know what one of those said I was in prison and you visited me so what God would you allow God to put you into a condition that where you're in prison so that another category of election can manifest who they are that's a sacrifice life and so I can't do it Stan price can't do it but the spirit of God in Me can sacrifice his life amen I Give Myself Away um so you can use me I give myself away oh I give myself all my life is not my own I belong I give myself I give myself to you because my life is not my of Hallelujah thank you Hallelujah all my life is not my own dang it brother sing it sister [Music] I self away yes Lord give my life to you Lord I Give Myself Away hear myself away so

were saying yes Lord I love you my husband yes I believe and it just stirred my heart my brother and sister because you know as he's talking about Melchizedek my brother and sister I want you to focus on this little small fact that Abraham was not preoccupied with business in the tent God ordained him to be looking out of the tent because there was something in his heart that said something's fixing to happen and he was looking for something that was coming and he was focused on that and as it is my brother and sister we can say he is coming but we heard our brother last night and to this morning is not looking for his coming he is here amen we are a blessed people to know our Melchizedek is on the scene he is here today saying talk to me share your heart express your desire I'm here

condition I don't look at my daughter-in-law my grandchildren I'm looking at a token promise and he loved me enough to give me that promise that I can stand with confidence and say I'm Amazed I'm
