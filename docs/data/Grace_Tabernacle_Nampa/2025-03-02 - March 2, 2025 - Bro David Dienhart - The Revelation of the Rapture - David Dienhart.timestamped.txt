[35:00] the ministry in this hour is not to

[35:05] word for the season now amen and that
[35:08] keeps the bride going forward amen
[35:11] reaching continually what are we
[35:13] reaching for Brother David the Finish we
[35:16] have the finish in sight we have the
[35:18] body change in sight how are we going to
[35:20] get
[35:21] there by the revealing of himself to
[35:25] you amen it's the only way you're going
[35:27] to make it is that he reveal himself to
[35:30] you so let's stand well before we stand
[35:33] I have a couple things I want to read
[35:35] the prophet said my title this morning
[35:38] is the revelation of the
[35:40] Rapture the
[35:43] revelation of the
[35:45] Rapture what is a revelation we know
[35:49] what it is it's the faith so we're
[35:51] speaking of the faith of the
[35:53] Rapture it's got to be revealed first
[35:58] in
[35:59] you you've got to have that Revelation
[36:01] bride before you can have a body
[36:04] change but this message has made the way
[36:07] for it this message is for the going
[36:10] home of the
[36:11] Bride we believe the message is the full
[36:13] revelation of Jesus Christ amen which is
[36:17] here it's the Sun is up how many believe
[36:20] the Sun is up he said is the rising of
[36:22] the Sun but he then he says in the same
[36:24] message he said now we see the Sun is up
[36:27] where is it where is it where is it up
[36:30] and where is it
[36:31] shining in you it's shining in the bride
[36:36] it's up in the bride she is the
[36:39] revelation of the son the full
[36:41] revelation of Jesus Christ is walking on
[36:44] Earth today what is it the revelation of
[36:46] the son of man those aren't cliches
[36:49] that's the
[36:50] truth amen amen so the prophet says in
[36:55] the message rapture paragraph 65 but to
[36:58] the church the bride the Rapture is a
[37:02] revelation to
[37:04] her it's revealed to
[37:07] her the Revel that the Revelation the
[37:10] true bride of Christ will be waiting for
[37:12] that
[37:13] revelation of the
[37:15] Rapture amen now my title was the
[37:18] revelation of the Rapture but also I
[37:20] want to include this she's going up she
[37:24] can't be closed
[37:26] up she's going going up can't be closed
[37:31] up she's being taken
[37:34] up when God when the excuse me when the
[37:37] prophet saw the bride marching she
[37:39] returned again like she was at the first
[37:41] how many know that when she returned
[37:43] again she saw her him her Marching In
[37:46] step with the word because he said she
[37:48] was the word
[37:50] marching and she didn't go down she went
[37:55] up her walk was up just like Enoch
[37:58] brother Braham said Enoch walked with
[38:01] God Amen Enoch walked with God and one
[38:04] step was higher The Next Step was higher
[38:06] than the last
[38:08] step the path of the just is a shining
[38:10] light that groweth greater more and more
[38:13] unto that perfect day we're looking for
[38:15] the perfect day of a mortal body
[38:18] change amen
[38:22] amen paragraph 66 he said now it's a
[38:26] revelation
[38:27] for the Revelation is Faith you cannot
[38:31] have a revelation without it being
[38:35] faith faith is a
[38:38] revelation because it's something that's
[38:40] revealed to you now we're talking about
[38:44] individual here this morning this is not
[38:47] a group Affair God I it doesn't matter
[38:50] it's not a group Affair you belong to
[38:51] this church you belong to that church
[38:53] you belong to this church it's not a
[38:54] group Affair it's an individual affair
[38:57] between you and Christ I believe in
[38:59] going to church I believe you ought to
[39:01] be in a church I believe you ought to
[39:02] make a church home where the ministry is
[39:05] preaching the word for the
[39:09] season and that is where we're at today
[39:11] but it's an individual Affair Christ
[39:14] isn't revealed to a group Christ is
[39:16] revealed to the individuals who are the
[39:18] members of one body amen right
[39:23] amen so faith is a revelation because
[39:26] it's something that revealed to you now
[39:28] what is a revelation now Faith is
[39:32] what
[39:33] substance now Faith is the substance of
[39:37] things hoped for it's not an imagination
[39:39] it's something you know it's something
[39:41] you have right now with Revelation you
[39:43] have it it's not that there won't be
[39:46] more Revelation even on the same thing
[39:48] but you have that Revelation you have
[39:50] that much substance and the substance
[39:52] will grow until we're body our bodies
[39:54] change right amen
[39:58] so the revelation of the Rapture is the
[40:00] substance of the
[40:02] Rapture and when you have the substance
[40:05] of the Rapture guess what you have
[40:08] Rapture
[40:10] Hallelujah so what's the bride looking
[40:12] for what's the message going to produce
[40:14] the revelation of the
[40:17] Rapture all right so now it's a
[40:19] revelation because it's something that's
[40:22] revealed to you you know
[40:24] it you know it that's right
[40:28] there's going to be somebody in this
[40:30] earth that knows it yes there's
[40:32] somebody's going to be walking with God
[40:35] because if you're walking with God
[40:37] you're going to end up the way Enoch end
[40:39] up right you become a wasnot yes the
[40:43] Lord why because of the moving and
[40:45] revelation of the
[40:47] Rapture
[40:49] hallelujah amen I'm I'm just bringing a
[40:51] lot here we're going to cover it all I'm
[40:52] going to go right back here because the
[40:54] Rapture is a person
[40:57] right it's not it's not something that's
[41:01] that's it's it's a substance and you
[41:04] were in God before the foundation of the
[41:06] world as
[41:09] substance then you were poured into a
[41:11] body of clay flesh but before Adam was
[41:14] poured into as a man he was made in the
[41:16] image of God which is spirit is that
[41:19] right before he became man of the earth
[41:22] he was
[41:23] Spirit then he moved as the Holy Spirit
[41:25] and moved and governed and God placed
[41:28] him in control of the earth and he and
[41:30] he moved just like the Holy Ghost moves
[41:32] us and and and and orders our way he
[41:35] ordered the Earth right who's ordering
[41:37] your
[41:39] earth right who's got control of your
[41:44] Earth if the word's in you the word has
[41:47] that control and you just let him do
[41:50] it you give your body you give yourself
[41:53] over to him and he does it
[41:57] see he has control if you let him have
[42:02] control amen you don't need to add to
[42:05] him or take from him he's perfect he's
[42:08] the word he's Flawless he can't make
[42:11] mistakes you make them man makes them
[42:14] but he never makes them right amen so
[42:16] who's he looking at If he if you're if
[42:18] he's in you he's not looking at you at
[42:20] you the body the man he's looking at
[42:22] himself through the blood the blood
[42:25] carries a life and you've got the life
[42:27] life so you stand perfect in his
[42:32] sight amen I went beyond myself now
[42:35] there we'll just back up here faith is
[42:37] something that's been revealed to you
[42:39] like it was to Abraham that could call
[42:41] anything contrary to what had been
[42:43] revealed to
[42:45] him as though it wasn't so
[42:50] amen so what was he walking by
[42:54] faith we live by faith we walk by his
[42:56] faith we live by his faith he we have
[42:59] been ordained to live by something we
[43:01] don't see with our carnal eyes but we
[43:03] see as substance that's greater than
[43:05] what you see with your carnal
[43:08] eyes because we look not we our Focus
[43:10] isn't on what we see that's temporal our
[43:12] focus is on the
[43:15] Eternal
[43:16] amen that's
[43:19] real this out here isn't real this is
[43:22] passing away you say well it looks real
[43:24] but it's not the real we're talking
[43:25] about the real has never had a beginning
[43:28] or end so you were in God's thinking of
[43:31] himself and God's in you now the thought
[43:33] of himself what he thought of himself to
[43:34] be you're acting that
[43:37] out okay so so now Faith is something
[43:40] has been revealed to you like it was to
[43:42] Abraham who could call anything to what
[43:44] he had been revealed to him as though it
[43:46] wasn't so now Faith that's what faith is
[43:50] is the revelation of God now what's the
[43:53] True Believer paragraph 68 perfect Faith
[43:56] the prophet told us what a True Believer
[43:58] was the True Believer is the faith of
[44:00] God Amen that's moving in you it's
[44:05] working in you it's carrying you it's
[44:08] walking in you it's going somewhere yeah
[44:12] amen amen we have the view of the end
[44:15] the boy on the plank wrote it because
[44:16] his his eyes weren't down here what's
[44:18] all going around him his eyes were on
[44:20] the finish and he stayed
[44:22] steady he was walking he was riding by
[44:25] faith he saw the finish that was the
[44:28] goal he was pressing toward that right
[44:32] and you've been given the ability to
[44:33] press toward that and to make
[44:35] it because God by Revelation gives you
[44:38] Faith to walk in and it's his
[44:42] own and so here we are here we are the
[44:45] revelation of God what the True Believer
[44:47] is is moving in you the church is built
[44:50] upon the Revelation the whole entire
[44:53] body is built upon the revelation of who
[44:56] Jesus Christ Christ is now what he is
[44:59] today he was yesterday but what he is
[45:01] today is poured into another
[45:04] form the revelation of Jesus Christ in
[45:07] you is growing in that bride in this in
[45:10] the formation of the Bride coming to a
[45:12] full stature yes
[45:16] hallelujah amen what a full stature
[45:18] growing into maturity of who
[45:22] Christ because you always were Christ
[45:25] you're going into the full stature of
[45:27] Christ because why you are a new man you
[45:31] are a new
[45:33] creation all right
[45:37] now so on the on the message
[45:41] 65125 379 he said well I'm going to read
[45:44] that I'll read that in just a minute I'd
[45:47] like you to stand with me and turn to
[45:48] Psalm 27
[45:55] please Psalms 2 7 brother
[45:58] Bram read this when he preached the
[46:00] message Rapture he said it was the
[46:02] background he wanted to read psalms 27
[46:06] because it was the background of what he
[46:08] wanted to speak
[46:11] on pretty good background it was the
[46:14] background of it so Psalm 27 verse1 the
[46:17] Lord is my light hello the Lord is my
[46:22] light in him is no
[46:23] Darkness at all the Lord is my light and
[46:28] my
[46:29] salvation Whom Shall I
[46:33] Fear the Lord is the strength of my life
[46:38] of whom shall I be
[46:43] afraid when the wicked even mine enemies
[46:46] and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my
[46:49] flesh they will try remember the prophet
[46:51] said they will try to shut off the bride
[46:54] they will try to do that they'll try to
[46:57] stop the bride from ministering but they
[46:59] can't do
[47:01] it Prophet they'll try to close her up
[47:03] but they can't do
[47:05] it why she has the Revelation and
[47:08] walking in the faith of
[47:12] rapture she won't be shut up she can't
[47:15] be closed up she'll be taken up and
[47:18] she's on her way
[47:20] now amen she's marching now she's
[47:24] Marching In step with the revealed word
[47:26] of the hour which is the son of man
[47:28] revealed that's what she's walking in
[47:31] that's what she's testifying to
[47:33] Hallelujah right glory to God Amen all
[47:38] right so he says here now when the
[47:41] wicked they came to eat up my flesh they
[47:43] stumbled and fell you can you can just
[47:47] absolutely you can absolutely trust that
[47:50] they will continually stumble and fall
[47:53] they can't shut her up they can't close
[47:56] her up up she's the word living amen
[47:59] she's Christ Living they couldn't shut
[48:01] him off yesterday they won't shut him
[48:03] off
[48:04] today he's here again in the full
[48:07] revelation of himself full Redemption
[48:10] the book The Promised book has been
[48:12] opened he's come to claim what he's
[48:14] redeemed full Redemption is now your
[48:18] possession it's the full revelation of
[48:21] Jesus
[48:23] Christ okay so he says
[48:27] verse three though a host should encamp
[48:30] against me my heart shall not fear
[48:33] though Wars what the what is a host what
[48:35] is a host ecumenical move Council of
[48:38] churches that image will try to stop the
[48:41] bride
[48:43] right
[48:45] Hallelujah you say how can that be God
[48:48] said it would God said it would be that
[48:50] way God said it would rise up amen right
[48:54] and it's right in the formation now and
[48:55] we have even a president that's anointed
[48:57] to even bring it further than what the
[49:00] others
[49:02] have who who gives the power who's
[49:04] becoming politically strong the Council
[49:07] of churches the image to the Beast is
[49:09] becoming politically strong we know it
[49:12] we see
[49:13] it how long I don't know but the bride
[49:17] brother sister God wants you to see
[49:19] where you're standing who you are and
[49:21] that you have been positionally placed
[49:23] in Christ The Rapture
[49:27] amen I don't I let me say it Lord just
[49:30] as clear as I can we come with clearness
[49:32] of speech Paul said we're not coming
[49:35] with we're coming with with plainness of
[49:38] speech but there's an element though I
[49:41] speak Revelation there's still an
[49:42] element that has to take place and that
[49:45] is the Revelation to you
[49:48] personally amen you say you're excited
[49:51] Brother David I'm more than excited I'm
[49:54] stimulated and that's what taking us
[49:57] home is the simulation of Revelation

[50:05] lot that don't see it but the bride has
[50:07] been awakened and what all others beside
[50:10] the bride don't see is they don't see
[50:12] the Awakening of the Bride she's
[50:15] awakened she's awakened to who she is
[50:18] the book opened up who she is the third
[50:20] pull is open the
[50:22] word amen I may preach this a lot faster
[50:26] than I thought
[50:27] all right all right though a h should
[50:30] encamp against me my heart my heart will
[50:33] not fear though War should rise against
[50:35] me in this will I be confident one thing
[50:39] have I desired of the Lord I'll be
[50:41] confident this one thing have I desired
[50:43] of the Lord that I will seek after that
[50:45] I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[50:47] the days of my life notice they dwell in
[50:51] the house of the Lord where what is the
[50:53] bride's Dwelling Place absolutely is in

[1:11:48] church after the opening of the seals he
[1:11:50] said I'll call you
[1:11:51] bride it's different bride bride is a
[1:11:54] married woman woman different than the
[1:11:57] church the church is a good Sanctified
[1:11:59] woman out here but she's not
[1:12:03] bride amen there's a
[1:12:08] difference that's why the carnal
[1:12:10] Believers will always come against you
[1:12:12] and say who do you think you are it's
[1:12:14] not who I think I am it's who he said I
[1:12:16] am
[1:12:19] right amen
[1:12:21] hallelujah all right now
[1:12:26] he said he said the move is on the for
[1:12:29] the bride that's the truth he said
[1:12:31] that's thus saith the Lord the move is
[1:12:34] on for the bride
[1:12:37] amen where is she going where's she
[1:12:39] going she'll leave so so so suddenly
[1:12:42] because her her whole time here has been
[1:12:45] a a non-public
[1:12:48] show this working in her is not a public
[1:12:51] show it's the seventh seal unveiled she

[1:13:16] known
[1:13:19] amen amen well he said so it's on it's
[1:13:23] thus sayth the Lord then he turns and
[1:13:24] says well in the Rapture time now he
[1:13:28] said Rapture age now it's Rapture time
[1:13:30] in the Rapture time which is Matthew
[1:13:33] 2510 they that were ready went into the
[1:13:35] marriage is that right he refers to that
[1:13:39] he said the bridegroom call went out
[1:13:41] behold the bridegroom
[1:13:42] cometh and everybody rose up one didn't
[1:13:45] have oil they can only go so far the
[1:13:47] other had the oil in their vessel they
[1:13:49] had the oil they had the oil on the word
[1:13:52] the word and the oil came together
[1:13:55] in the vessel they had it to anoint that
[1:13:59] word to receive that
[1:14:02] word and when they that were ready went
[1:14:05] in with him to the marriage and when the
[1:14:09] last one come
[1:14:11] in or other words at the last
[1:14:15] Trump do you know that call I pray it's
[1:14:17] still going out because the bride is the
[1:14:21] final voice right she's calls
[1:14:25] and she's still calling and what the
[1:14:27] prophet said come out of her do you
[1:14:29] realize that voice is still
[1:14:31] voicing yes come out of her come out of
[1:14:35] her my
[1:14:38] people not my group not my servants my
[1:14:40] people My Bride come out of
[1:14:43] her and it still calls but it's going to
[1:14:46] call for the last time because when that
[1:14:48] last call the last one comes in and
[1:14:50] recognizes who she
[1:14:54] is the door's clut the door is shut
[1:14:56] right that's it she can be in that in
[1:14:59] behind that door for a period of time
[1:15:01] yet it's preaching to the Eternal
[1:15:05] lost but preaching for the bride because
[1:15:08] it's to the bride and it's to that
[1:15:11] church what church Sanctified Church
[1:15:14] yeah but they can only go so far because
[1:15:17] when the door was shut they came and the
[1:15:19] bride was already in and they came back
[1:15:21] and said well we thought there was to be
[1:15:23] a Rapture let us in let us in he said I
[1:15:26] don't know
[1:15:29] you
[1:15:32] amen they're left out in what
[1:15:35] tribulation but they rise up again in
[1:15:37] the white Throne judgment and given life
[1:15:40] because their names were found on the
[1:15:41] book of life because they wouldn't bow
[1:15:44] to that to that image because they
[1:15:47] recognized what they
[1:15:52] missed see they didn't have oil
[1:15:56] they had the lamp they had the word oh
[1:15:58] we got the word we got the word we
[1:15:59] believe God sent a prophet we got the
[1:16:01] word but no revelation of that
[1:16:05] word amen are you with me no revelation
[1:16:08] of
[1:16:09] it and so they missed the bride Rapture
[1:16:12] because they weren't part of the Bride
[1:16:14] they were good clean cloth they were the
[1:16:16] they were in the L in The Book of Life
[1:16:18] you could say lamb book of life but the
[1:16:20] bride was in another section of that
[1:16:21] book yes it was called the bride section
[1:16:25] go back to suon church age and see if
[1:16:27] that's not the truth brother Ram said
[1:16:29] she was ordained in a certain portion of
[1:16:32] that book called a little book opened a
[1:16:35] little book within that
[1:16:38] book her names would never be removed
[1:16:40] the names of the Bride could never be
[1:16:43] removed all the cloth all the cloth with
[1:16:46] good clean cloth but he put the pattern
[1:16:48] on that cloth and said this is the bride
[1:16:51] section and cut out the bride
[1:16:56] amen amen amen amen amen they were ready
[1:17:01] to go into
[1:17:03] marriage amen why they had the
[1:17:09] oil they were born again they they miss
[1:17:12] being in the bride because they're not
[1:17:13] born again oh they've been repented
[1:17:15] they've been baptized but they didn't go
[1:17:17] any further
[1:17:19] right good sanctified people the clean
[1:17:23] the cloth was clean
[1:17:25] now are those there are those I don't
[1:17:27] want to get into this CU another message
[1:17:28] and I've already been through it but
[1:17:30] those names that were taken off of the
[1:17:32] book were those that resisted that word
[1:17:34] resisted that message had a wrong
[1:17:36] attitude toward the word when it was
[1:17:38] brought to them of the
[1:17:41] truth and went back just like just like
[1:17:44] Lot's wife turned
[1:17:47] around is that
[1:17:49] right when they started out but they
[1:17:51] turned around and Luke and and and not
[1:17:54] not Luke I mean uh lot was a lukewarm
[1:17:57] carnal
[1:18:00] believer but he didn't turn around but
[1:18:03] his wife did turn around and went back
[1:18:05] and that name is removed the prophet
[1:18:09] said they because they rejected the
[1:18:12] message they didn't believe what was
[1:18:14] said they turned around and looked
[1:18:17] back cuz their heart never left Sodom
[1:18:22] right amen those carnal denominations
[1:18:25] system churches is nothing but sodom's
[1:18:32] religion it's a dominating female
[1:18:35] spirit and don't think that's left out
[1:18:37] here it tries to come in and upset the
[1:18:39] bride
[1:18:40] too amen but the bride is not a
[1:18:45] dominating female she is subject to the
[1:18:47] word loves the word amen
[1:18:52] himself all right I've gotten way off
[1:18:54] off track here but let's go
[1:18:57] back not off track necessarily no it
[1:19:01] it's still part of the Rapture all right
[1:19:03] the bride okay so bridegroom came to
[1:19:06] receive his bride it wasn't a public
[1:19:08] show it's a secret catching away brother
[1:19:11] sister that has been
[1:19:13] happening and I pray that it's still
[1:19:15] happening it's a secret it is and it is
[1:19:18] happening there's a secret catching away
[1:19:21] the coming of the Lord which the bride
[1:19:24] sees
[1:19:25] the bridegroom she's in Union with him
[1:19:28] it's not a public show the curtain has
[1:19:31] dropped nobody can enter that without
[1:19:34] the
[1:19:37] token amen all
[1:19:41] right all right so he poured himself
[1:19:47] now he did that to receive a bride a
[1:19:49] secret catching way taking her to a body
[1:19:52] change in in
[1:19:55] in what what how is he taking us right
[1:19:58] now into a body change how's he doing it
[1:20:00] in a
[1:20:04] Rapture we're going to a body change a
[1:20:07] mortal body change but we have to we are
[1:20:09] going in a spiritual New Birth in a word
[1:20:13] body in a new body in a new man amen
[1:20:17] which is Jesus Christ in you the new
[1:20:21] birth that's how we're going to a body
[1:20:23] change because we know him because he
[1:20:27] knew us first yes you think it's
[1:20:30] anything we could just pump ourselves up
[1:20:31] to do this no it's the fact is that he
[1:20:34] made himself known that we were in him
[1:20:36] he knew us and because he knew us we
[1:20:40] could know him and would know him
[1:20:42] because my sheep know my
[1:20:44] voice why because they were part of the
[1:20:47] revelation of himself they were the
[1:20:49] revelation of himself for this day and
[1:20:51] this day is the full revelation of
[1:20:53] himself so where does that put us bride
[1:20:57] one one not only together we're one with
[1:21:01] him we're no longer Twain the marriage
[1:21:04] is
[1:21:09] come
[1:21:11] Hallelujah Greek to some open to
[1:21:15] others that's exactly what's happening I
[1:21:19] am not responsible for who can or who
[1:21:21] can't I am responsible for what I'm
[1:21:23] doing with the
[1:21:25] word I'm responsible to preach this word
[1:21:28] I'm responsible for preaching the word
[1:21:30] for your season amen and that season has
[1:21:34] left a Pentecostal
[1:21:38] season that was good in it season we
[1:21:41] needed in its season is that right the
[1:21:43] restoration of the gifts the baptism of
[1:21:45] the Holy Ghost but if you got a true
[1:21:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost you're going
[1:21:49] to see and walk in the revelation of the
[1:21:52] Rapture for the word and the word for
[1:21:55] the
[1:21:56] season
[1:21:58] right because when that comes in you it
[1:22:01] begins to grow up what is it growing up
[1:22:04] into a
[1:22:06] perfect faith for a perfect
[1:22:10] Rapture that is already perfect Faith
[1:22:12] but what has it got to do it's got to
[1:22:15] grow is that right is that
[1:22:19] right doesn't the bride isn't she
[1:22:21] birthed and have to grow into maturity
[1:22:25] by these precious promises we are made
[1:22:27] partakers of his divine nature
[1:22:32] am and where's it growing it's growing
[1:22:34] in the
[1:22:37] bride how's he manifested
[1:22:42] himself Amen in the formation of what
[1:22:45] the revelation of Jesus Christ himself
[1:22:47] in the formation of the Bride go back to
[1:22:49] things that are to be and see if that's
[1:22:51] not what he said
[1:22:54] the problem is is that people don't want
[1:22:56] to spend time in the word they'd rather
[1:22:58] spend time busy with the world things
[1:23:00] the world and the world swallowing them
[1:23:02] up
[1:23:04] yes they can't bring fruit they start to
[1:23:06] bring fruit but they bring no fruit to
[1:23:11] Perfection CU where do you find faith
[1:23:13] that pleases God where you going to find
[1:23:15] Faith where you going to find the
[1:23:16] revelation of the Rapture it's going to
[1:23:18] be because you're feeding and in on the
[1:23:21] open
[1:23:23] book right
[1:23:27] you said Brother David You Preach like
[1:23:28] you're mad I'm not mad at anybody I

[1:37:46] now we know what faith is let's go
[1:37:48] beyond that to verse
[1:37:49] five by
[1:37:52] what by by
[1:37:55] faith
[1:37:57] Hallelujah by faith Enoch which is our
[1:38:02] type the second the the seventh from
[1:38:05] Adam where are we what are we where are
[1:38:07] we now the seventh from the second
[1:38:11] Adam
[1:38:13] amen amen are you with me yeah all right
[1:38:16] what came out of that what came out of
[1:38:19] the message at the end of the seventh
[1:38:21] age what came out we're at the end
[1:38:23] brother sister there no say we still got
[1:38:24] time we're at the end I don't know how
[1:38:27] much longer but we're at the
[1:38:29] end we've already done enter to bride
[1:38:32] age all right the Corner's already
[1:38:36] turned but did you turn with the corner
[1:38:39] that's the thing yeah have you turned
[1:38:42] with
[1:38:42] it we're not building a wall we're
[1:38:45] building a house the prophet said yeah
[1:38:47] and don't don't don't kick out the
[1:38:49] Cornerstone because the Cornerstone has
[1:38:51] become the head of the corner yeah and
[1:38:53] this is where we at the bride is
[1:38:55] fulfilling scripture because she's got
[1:38:57] to glorify him the head she comes in the
[1:39:00] for she's made known in the formation of
[1:39:02] the
[1:39:04] head because being here she being here
[1:39:07] she's the revelation of the head yes
[1:39:11] right amen all right so by faith Enoch
[1:39:17] which is our type Enoch was translated
[1:39:20] uhoh same word amen same word in
[1:39:23] Colossians
[1:39:24] 113 Enoch
[1:39:26] was translated
[1:39:29] conveyed from one position to another
[1:39:33] position from one place to another place
[1:39:36] have you been conveyed from one position
[1:39:38] to another position yes amen thank God
[1:39:42] thank the Lord Jesus that he Christ hath
[1:39:45] positionally placed
[1:39:46] us we've been positionally
[1:39:50] placed who did that
[1:39:53] did your good works do
[1:39:55] that did your M did your well I can I
[1:39:59] can keep myself I don't have any
[1:40:00] mistakes you won't make it because those
[1:40:03] that make it go through trials tests and
[1:40:05] mistakes and failures absolutely
[1:40:08] failures had nothing to do what's inside
[1:40:11] your soul that's right if you're born
[1:40:14] again has not a thing to do with it
[1:40:16] right amen cuz you didn't desire
[1:40:18] wouldn't desire to do it in the first
[1:40:20] place so in this flesh you're going to
[1:40:22] have failures some mistakes so quit
[1:40:24] listening to the devil to beat you down
[1:40:26] because of those
[1:40:28] things because of your feelings because
[1:40:30] of your senses because of your
[1:40:34] reasoning amen the word doesn't need any
[1:40:37] reasoning it can't be reasoned with it's
[1:40:39] perfect it's
[1:40:42] Flawless he's already positioned you
[1:40:45] he's not judging you by the outer
[1:40:47] man right if that's the case he didn't
[1:40:50] need to die for you then because when he
[1:40:51] died for you shed the blood for you and
[1:40:54] washed you you're washed you're loose
[1:40:56] and the loosing and the washing is
[1:40:57] absolutely perfect there is therefore
[1:41:01] now no condemnation to them that are in
[1:41:03] Christ
[1:41:04] Jesus because why you're not here with
[1:41:07] any ambition any desire to walk
[1:41:09] according to the flesh when you're in
[1:41:11] Christ you are not walking according to
[1:41:13] this
[1:41:15] flesh
[1:41:17] amen when you're birthed in Christ you
[1:41:20] will you are not walking according to
[1:41:22] this flesh
[1:41:24] and you have the discernment to know the
[1:41:27] difference and if you should make a
[1:41:29] mistake the prophet said being born
[1:41:32] again he would show you and when he
[1:41:33] shows you Lord I didn't mean to do that
[1:41:36] it's already finished it's already
[1:41:38] worked The Works finished I've already
[1:41:40] chose you I've already elected you I've
[1:41:42] already placed you in myself and I'm
[1:41:44] revealing myself to you despite your
[1:41:46] failures God glory to God and every one
[1:41:49] of those failures are bringing you to
[1:41:50] the realization of that very thing and
[1:41:53] causing you to let go and walk in the
[1:41:55] character of Jesus Christ will you
[1:41:58] perfect this flesh and bring this flesh
[1:41:59] to Perfection no you're going to be
[1:42:02] you're going to be bothered by it you're
[1:42:04] going to be a sticky carnal nature
[1:42:06] that's going to bother you as long as
[1:42:08] you're remaining in this body but you
[1:42:10] have victory over your enemy you have
[1:42:12] victory over this evil one this man you
[1:42:15] have victory over it already
[1:42:18] right you've been already given victory
[1:42:21] over it over it that's you're more than
[1:42:23] a conqueror you're in the Conquering
[1:42:26] one can anything separate you from the
[1:42:29] love of God can failures can mistakes
[1:42:31] can things above things in the past your
[1:42:33] failures you're this you're that you did
[1:42:35] this you did that not a one of the
[1:42:37] things she'll be able to separate you
[1:42:39] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:42:41] Jesus now that settles it that ought to
[1:42:44] settle
[1:42:46] it in your soul it ought to settle it
[1:42:50] yes it's not whether you reason with it
[1:42:52] and feel it oh I just don't feel what
[1:42:54] you're saying I don't feel it quit
[1:42:55] you're trying to feel and realize that
[1:42:57] the feeling goes deeper it's my

[1:44:01] a
[1:44:03] shadow the shadow only points to light

[1:44:28] with you even in
[1:44:33] you oh my all right I got to finish here
[1:44:38] but look at how this is spoken of in i
[1:44:41] in Hebrews I didn't finish this listen
[1:44:43] carefully how this is read by faith
[1:44:46] Enoch was
[1:44:48] translated that he should not see
[1:44:51] death brother sister before Enoch's body
[1:44:55] was changed the scripture said he was
[1:44:57] already
[1:45:01] translated that he should not see
[1:45:05] death he already had the
[1:45:09] Revelation and we're here like Enoch see
[1:45:12] the type in the Bible he walked with
[1:45:14] God how could he walk with God unless he
[1:45:17] was
[1:45:18] sinless oh that's a good
[1:45:21] one brother David you just said we have
[1:45:23] troubles I'm not talking about this
[1:45:24] being
[1:45:26] sinless right I'm not talking about
[1:45:28] this right every Born Again believer in
[1:45:31] Jesus Christ is sinless because you're
[1:45:33] in the sinless one how can you have sin
[1:45:36] when you're in the sinless one that's
[1:45:43] right sin is not counted against you
[1:45:46] when you're in Jesus Christ all he can
[1:45:48] see is
[1:45:49] himself who did he see in Enoch who is
[1:45:52] in Enoch
[1:45:55] and you're under the blood he was under
[1:45:58] he where was he
[1:46:00] at Walking with God what made him walk
[1:46:04] with God he was the seed of
[1:46:07] God
[1:46:10] right God was his
[1:46:12] father yeah look at him walking with God
[1:46:16] having this Revelation already in him
[1:46:17] that he wouldn't see death it was
[1:46:19] already a revelation to him he had
[1:46:20] already been changed spiritually
[1:46:23] yeah and then it goes on to say and was
[1:46:25] not found and conjunction was not
[1:46:30] found
[1:46:32] amen for for because God had translated
[1:46:36] him now watch here it is for before his
[1:46:42] translation he had this
[1:46:45] Revelation which was his
[1:46:50] testimony amen are you with with me he
[1:46:54] said he had this testimony that he
[1:46:56] pleased
[1:46:58] God but without faith it's impossible to
[1:47:01] please him for he that cometh to God
[1:47:04] must believe that he is not an a was not
[1:47:07] a will be though he was and will be but
[1:47:11] is amen and he that is and he is a
[1:47:14] rewarder of them that diligently
[1:47:18] diligently seek
[1:47:21] him draw an nigh to God he'll draw nigh
[1:47:24] to you seek Him and you'll find
[1:47:29] him amen they that hunger and thirst for
[1:47:32] righteousness shall be
[1:47:35] filled say you don't believe that who's
[1:47:37] lie then who you're going to believe
[1:47:38] you're going to believe the lie if you
[1:47:39] don't believe the truth you have to turn
[1:47:41] down the word which is truth to believe
[1:47:43] a
[1:47:44] lie right all
[1:47:47] right but look at how he translated now
[1:47:50] if we go to what the prophet said
[1:47:54] he said this Rapture this
[1:48:05] this let me just find where he brought
[1:48:08] this out he said oh here it is 318 first
[1:48:11] seal 63 Enoch walked before God for 500
[1:48:15] years and had a testimony now here's his
[1:48:18] testimony that he pleased god with
[1:48:21] raptured faith
[1:48:23] fath
[1:48:27] right praise God see his testimony
[1:48:31] before he even changed before he even
[1:48:33] had a body change he pleased god with
[1:48:35] that revelation of
[1:48:38] rapture you see why I'm so excited about
[1:48:41] our
[1:48:43] testimony then what are we facing how
[1:48:46] soon is it we see the politics and
[1:48:49] church controlling
[1:48:50] politics and the church was such
[1:48:52] phenomenal wealth she'll buy out the
[1:48:54] whole country and nation and she'll do
[1:48:58] it you can see it's working right
[1:49:00] towards
[1:49:01] that about ready to have a a new pope I
[1:49:04] wonder if the next one will come out of
[1:49:05] the
[1:49:08] US
[1:49:11] Amen brother sister what's holding off
[1:49:13] this thing right now what's holding
[1:49:15] what's you see who that false prophet is
[1:49:19] you see who the Antichrist is you know
[1:49:21] who the Beast is yeah
[1:49:24] but the others are blind to it even many
[1:49:26] in the message are blind to it because
[1:49:28] it's working right around the message
[1:49:30] and they don't even know
[1:49:31] it can't discern it why they need to be
[1:49:34] born
[1:49:35] again David can't discern anything David
[1:49:39] can do nothing if I try to rely upon
[1:49:42] David and my own ideas and lean to my
[1:49:44] own understanding I'll fail I fail every
[1:49:48] time right amen but he can't fail and
[1:49:51] he's in you and he's in me and he's
[1:49:54] translated us already
[1:49:56] spiritually because before our body
[1:49:58] change we have this testimony that we're
[1:50:00] walking in a Rapture
[1:50:02] faith we are in a Rapture
[1:50:05] age glory to God Amen that's exactly
[1:50:09] right remember all right so he said see
[1:50:13] he pleased God and just started walking
[1:50:15] right out every step a little higher why
[1:50:17] he walking in the light walking in the
[1:50:19] light walking in the light he had more
[1:50:21] than a word he had Dynamics mechanics
[1:50:24] together that's why he could walk a
[1:50:26] little step higher a little step higher
[1:50:28] a little amen because we're not here to
[1:50:31] minister the letter we're here to
[1:50:32] minister the spirit of that letter amen
[1:50:36] amen we are here to worship Him in true
[1:50:38] worship which is spirit and Truth
[1:50:43] together amen amen
[1:50:49] now amen Ephesians 1
[1:50:56] I won't be long now if you just give me
[1:50:58] about can you give me about 10
[1:51:01] minutes I don't hear any
[1:51:04] answer okay well okay and I preach long
[1:51:09] enough
[1:51:12] then yes or
[1:51:14] no
[1:51:15] yes all right yeah that's not the
[1:51:18] majority but that's minority
[1:51:23] I wish he'd shut up so we can go home
[1:51:24] and fill our
[1:51:27] bellies you say that was harsh no it
[1:51:29] isn't it's
[1:51:32] truth because whether you say it
[1:51:35] out what are you
[1:51:41] thinking but I'm going to continue just
[1:51:43] a little bit
[1:51:44] here amen
[1:51:50] now because I'll tell you we're so taken
[1:51:53] up with impatience we need
[1:51:56] patience we can spend two or three hours
[1:51:59] watching a
[1:52:01] movie and feed on
[1:52:04] it but when it comes to the word for the
[1:52:06] hour and the
[1:52:08] day what are you going to do go out
[1:52:10] there and stand around go out to a
[1:52:12] restaurant and go home and take a
[1:52:15] nap I'm not against those things but why
[1:52:18] can't we give time to the word
[1:52:22] I'll tell you why because we're at the
[1:52:25] end and the church has cooled off it's
[1:52:28] come to church go home come to church go
[1:52:32] home but I know in a little
[1:52:35] group in minority there's a people that
[1:52:38] love
[1:52:39] this I know
[1:52:41] that that's what keeps me
[1:52:45] going he say well you're overtime since
[1:52:48] when have we made a
[1:52:49] time you can't put God In The Box
[1:52:56] that's
[1:52:57] right I'm not Bering anybody I believe
[1:53:00] he's speaking these words to every one
[1:53:01] of
[1:53:03] us amen well you could say it a little
[1:53:06] nicer you know you could have love in
[1:53:08] what you say you don't know
[1:53:11] love you're looking at filio instead of
[1:53:13] agape
[1:53:15] love because God would do everything he
[1:53:17] can to keep you out of
[1:53:20] hell and turning your back on this
[1:53:24] message God is feeding his
[1:53:27] bride amen all
[1:53:32] right
[1:53:35] 122 and hath put all things under his
[1:53:37] feet and gave him to be the head over
[1:53:39] all things to the church is he or isn't
[1:53:42] he he is all right which is his body the
[1:53:46] church is his body the fullness of him
[1:53:48] the fullness of him the fullness of him
[1:53:51] that filth with all in all and verse one
[1:53:55] chapter 2 and you hath he
[1:53:59] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[1:54:02] and sins what's quickened
[1:54:04] mean Made Alive

[1:54:18] has raised us up together and made us
[1:54:20] sit together in Heavenly places in
[1:54:23] Christ Jesus hath made us sit together
[1:54:26] in Heavenly places not only have you
[1:54:28] raised you've raptured amen because now
[1:54:32] you're setting in Heavenly places in
[1:54:35] Christ
[1:54:36] Jesus do you see that say amen amen all
[1:54:43] right I'm going to bypass Luke
[1:54:46] 1731 I'll read this and I'm going to
[1:54:49] have to stop
[1:55:05] Luke chapter 17 verse
[1:55:10] 30 well we know the re the son of man is
[1:55:13] being revealed verse 31 in that day what
[1:55:15] day the day of his Revelation the day
[1:55:17] when the son of man was being revealed
[1:55:19] Abraham and Sarah being revealed as it
[1:55:21] was in that day
[1:55:23] in that day he which shall be upon the
[1:55:25] Housetop and his stuff on the house let
[1:55:27] him not come down to take away and he
[1:55:30] that is in the field let him not
[1:55:31] likewise return back other words you've
[1:55:34] marched forward you've gone forward quit
[1:55:35] trying to go back amen you've gone up
[1:55:38] the Housetop go higher yeah don't go
[1:55:41] down and get your stuff out of the house
[1:55:44] you passed that by are you're willing to
[1:55:47] sell everything sell out to make that
[1:55:49] Rapture then just keep moving forward
[1:55:51] keep going forward
[1:55:52] don't come back don't go back what's he
[1:55:54] say here remember Lot's
[1:55:58] wife many have started this message many
[1:56:01] went started out with it and after 40
[1:56:03] even 50 years have turned their back
[1:56:05] into a denominational
[1:56:07] hogwash right turned right
[1:56:10] around why they never had that in them
[1:56:13] to begin
[1:56:15] with remember Lot's
[1:56:20] wife all right
[1:56:22] he said will you go also turning to
[1:56:24] disciples Peter said where would we go
[1:56:27] you have the words of eternal
[1:56:32] life either this message does or why
[1:56:35] don't you go find the
[1:56:37] original because you can't have a copy
[1:56:40] you can't have a wrong one without
[1:56:42] original
[1:56:44] first if they don't believe this is the
[1:56:46] prophet of the hour the message of the
[1:56:47] hour then go find the one that
[1:56:50] is you say well this this is a false
[1:56:53] prophet go find the real one you can't
[1:56:55] have a false without a
[1:57:03] real amen all right

[2:00:01] the bride's already

[2:00:12] I said Christ the bride she's not
[2:00:15] another person that is her
[2:00:16] identification that's who she is that's
[2:00:19] her stand and that's her Revelation and
[2:00:21] she's been possed positionally placed
[2:00:23] right there and everything Christ ever
[2:00:25] had in him is yours and all that he ever
[2:00:27] was you are and all that you are he was
[2:00:31] am what is it it's the unveiling of God
[2:00:34] and we've come to that place right now
[2:00:36] that he's unveiled himself right down to
[2:00:38] us right down in us right down in the
[2:00:40] form of his bride it's the bride coming
[2:00:42] of Christ and we see it coming and it's
[2:00:44] going to be finished in a meeting in the
[2:00:46] air am let's Stand Together
[2:00:55] there's three comings he
[2:00:57] said the first time he comes is to
[2:01:01] redeem that wasn't complete until he we
[2:01:04] know that Prophet said that wasn't yet
[2:01:06] complete fully until he claimed what he
[2:01:09] had
[2:01:09] redeemed then the full Revelation comes
[2:01:13] all right then everything now he said
[2:01:15] now the second time he said he come to
[2:01:18] redeem the second time he comes to catch
[2:01:21] away his his bride I just told you
[2:01:23] you're being caught away he said
[2:01:25] it Like A Love Like A Love Affair he's
[2:01:29] pouring in himself they are becoming one
[2:01:31] for the wedding supper and he said it's
[2:01:33] a love affair all right he said right
[2:01:36] here it's a love affair Like A Love
[2:01:39] Affair amen he comes around and steals
[2:01:42] her out at night time takes her away
[2:01:44] from the world to meet him in the air
[2:01:46] the secret coming of the
[2:01:50] Lord here we are bride I say to the
[2:01:54] bride and I don't know I'm not saying
[2:01:57] who's bride and who isn't I'm saying to

[2:02:11] the Lord is risen upon
[2:02:14] thee

[2:02:19] Bible said he wouldn't share his glory
[2:02:20] with another
[2:02:22] but the bride is not

[2:02:41] tribulation not the bride the bride is
[2:02:43] Justified she goes straight to glory and
[2:02:45] a Rapture that's right she in my opinion
[2:02:48] the last member will be caught up one of
[2:02:50] these days the the last member will be
[2:02:53] caught up one of these days other words
[2:02:57] it's an ongoing thing that's right he's
[2:02:59] catching away secret catching away here
[2:03:01] it is again one of these days the last
[2:03:03] member will be caught up one of these
[2:03:06] days it might come and you wouldn't know
[2:03:09] nothing about it and they won't who's
[2:03:11] they won't everybody but bride they
[2:03:14] won't know it they'll say I thought the
[2:03:16] Rapture was supposed to take place and
