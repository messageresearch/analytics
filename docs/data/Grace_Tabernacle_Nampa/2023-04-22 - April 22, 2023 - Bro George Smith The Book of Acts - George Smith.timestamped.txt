[27:28] thank you now for health and life we
[27:31] pray that it should help us now in Jesus
[27:33] name amen
[27:34] amen you may be seated
[27:36] and um
[27:38] we're going to continue the study that
[27:42] we had probably two years ago
[27:44] and we had to um
[27:47] you know
[27:48] couldn't come here for a while
[27:50] but we did finish the chapter 18 we're
[27:53] going to review the chapter 18 of the
[27:55] book of Acts and I just want you to
[27:57] follow along
[27:58] we're going to not go over every verse
[28:01] we may jump over your favorite verse as
[28:04] possible but it's designed for you to go
[28:08] and read your Bible every day when you
[28:12] feel like it not just when grandma
[28:13] called to remind you but every day
[28:18] and so at this point of our study in
[28:20] book of Acts chapter 18 Paul and Silas
[28:23] which is his trusted associate
[28:25] they were in the midst of their second
[28:28] missionary journey
[28:30] and the date is about 49 A.D a long time
[28:33] ago
[28:34] and Paul at this point had already
[28:36] written his letters to the Galatians and
[28:39] uh the letter had also been written to
[28:41] the 12 tribes which we know as the
[28:44] general Epistle of James
[28:46] and of course that's in a chronological
[28:49] Bible ours is set up a little different
[28:50] but those letters are written first
[28:53] so verse 1 of chapter 18 after these
[28:56] things Paul departed from Athens and
[28:58] came to Corinth
[29:00] I see a lot of times we just read
[29:01] through that well where are these places
[29:03] well
[29:05] um
[29:06] am I doing something wrong brother Paul
[29:07] no we're going to
[29:10] um have a little translation for some of
[29:12] the Believers that will be benefited are
[29:14] you going to translate
[29:21] so Corinth is about 20 miles west of
[29:23] Athens
[29:25] and Corinth was a city that was well
[29:27] known for idolatry and very bad
[29:30] reputation of the citizens
[29:33] but on the edge of the edge of the city
[29:34] they had a great great Temple now big is
[29:38] not always better
[29:40] sometimes small is better so had this
[29:43] Great temple to the Goddess Diana
[29:45] complete with women priests and every
[29:48] kind of perversion you can imagine
[29:50] I've been there but of course the temple
[29:53] is not there anymore
[29:54] and that's one of the reasons that Paul
[29:56] seemed to be so heavy-handed against
[29:58] women
[29:59] and some were completely out of their
[30:01] place and doing every ungodly thing
[30:12] to speak Spanish
[30:24] we're in Idaho
[30:25] it's okay
[30:29] okay so this great Temple of Diana and
[30:32] Paul seemed to be heavy-handed because
[30:34] there was a lot of women out of control
[30:36] and
[30:39] um
[30:39] uh but uh Paul was very sure of his
[30:43] Revelation
[30:45] um because he preached by Revelation
[30:47] that he'd received from God
[30:51] that's why that
[30:54] I carry this level with me
[31:00] well but Paul we need to make some
[31:02] adjustments here
[31:08] that's so that you can see that we must
[31:11] stay level okay then we'll start I'll
[31:13] say balance
[31:14] not just in you know the way we eat but
[31:17] the way we meet the animals the way we
[31:19] dress
[31:22] and so he
[31:25] um in the church age book in chapter one
[31:28] paragraph 98. brother Brown says we need
[31:31] to call for revelation we need to call
[31:32] on God for Revelation
[31:34] anything else
[31:46] I was young one time
[31:51] I can hear it
[31:58] so he says here we need to call on God
[32:00] for Revelations
[32:03] we have accepted the Bible
[32:07] but still it's not real to most people
[32:10] because the Revelation by the spirit is
[32:13] not okay
[32:15] in the city
[32:19] but if it's not revealed
[32:24] brother said that the job of the
[32:27] ministry was to make Christ real to the
[32:29] peace
[32:32] but we want to make it real to you so uh
[32:37] he says this the word has not been
[32:39] quickened Paul was very sure of his
[32:42] Revelation
[32:43] and so he wrote over to the Galatians
[32:47] back at that point or even if an angel
[32:51] comes down
[32:53] any other gospel see
[32:58] other than that which I have already
[33:00] okay okay
[33:02] it goes straight to the hot place
[33:07] in the corner oh
[33:10] you got an opportunity
[33:13] you know Fables
[33:16] Paul had to deal with the generation of
[33:18] women out of control
[33:23] and William Brandon faced similarly
[33:29] two women
[33:36] um
[33:55] in case you don't know what that means
[33:58] it means balanced in every way
[34:21] okay
[34:25] so there is a continuity
[34:29] Spirit working in the seven Messengers
[34:33] especially similarity between the first
[34:36] messenger and the seventh matches
[34:42] they didn't go away with the prophet has
[34:45] been part of the word of God and it'll
[34:48] be seen in the true followers of the
[34:50] word of God not following personalities
[34:53] we've had too much of that nonsense okay
[34:57] that's right okay because it says over
[35:00] in Genesis 1 every seed after its kind
[35:03] and we assume that if you come to what
[35:06] we call a message church that you're
[35:07] listening to the message you're just
[35:10] growing in the message
[35:12] Baptists are making more Baptist
[35:14] Catholics making more Catholics
[35:17] in the open book you see okay so brother
[35:21] Brown says in Melchizedek the great
[35:23] Prince and King
[35:24] a few nights ago in a prayer meeting a
[35:26] man said to me the Holy Ghost was given
[35:29] only to the twelve on the day of
[35:31] Pentecost well that man didn't know his
[35:33] Bible
[35:33] I said well then what about the 120th
[35:36] that was there at the same time that
[35:37] received it as the twelve how about down
[35:39] at the house of Cornelius when the
[35:41] Gentiles received it 33 years later when
[35:44] Paul asked the Baptist if they'd
[35:46] received the Holy Ghost since they
[35:47] believed he laid his hands on them and
[35:49] then received the Holy Ghost
[35:51] setting the church in order in Corinth
[35:54] and he says um he also said in the
[35:58] church Apostles prophets teachers
[36:00] evangelists Gifts of healing all those
[36:02] marvelous gifts years and years after
[36:04] Pentecost even now you see yeah he goes
[36:08] on says well then uh it is today to
[36:11] every believer going to all the world
[36:13] and preach the gospel to Every Creature
[36:15] how far all the world how many all the
[36:20] people every creature either believeth
[36:23] in his baptized shall be saved
[36:26] and these signs shall follow them
[36:28] my name shall they cast out devils and
[36:31] heal the sickness there you are it's
[36:33] God's promise that he swore he would do
[36:36] it no matter how much Rises up to try to
[36:38] counterfeit or impersonate or how many
[36:41] things rise up to try to contradict it
[36:43] or take it
[36:45] now who in the right mind would want to
[36:46] take down something that said in the
[36:48] word of God
[36:49] they are out there I travel a lot I've
[36:53] seen them they'll look you right in the
[36:55] face and think they're right
[36:56] doesn't matter how many things rise up
[36:58] or try to contradict it or take it down
[37:00] it will go on and on and on for God has
[37:04] swore by himself and he would keep it
[37:06] you see so remember back in Galatians
[37:09] the weeds or even an angel and so I want
[37:13] to just look at that for a minute
[37:14] because he says here in Galatians 1 8.
[37:17] says
[37:20] um
[37:21] but though we or an angel from heaven
[37:24] now if an angel from heaven comes down
[37:26] here and
[37:27] tells Paul now you said I'm going to
[37:29] preach and he says something different
[37:31] I'm sure you guys would be smart enough
[37:34] throw him out right
[37:37] from Heaven preach any other gospel to
[37:40] use that which we have
[37:41] let him be occurred and then being a
[37:44] good teacher he repeats it because some
[37:46] of them weren't paying attention as we
[37:48] said before so I repeat now if any man
[37:51] preach any other gospel
[38:00] that's not just those guys standing
[38:02] around there that's even today
[38:04] so let's go on right now
[38:08] um in chapter 18 and verse two and he
[38:11] found a certain Jew named
[38:14] Aquila that was the man born of um in in
[38:18] pontus and lately come from Italy with
[38:21] his wife Priscilla because Claudius had
[38:23] commanded all the Jews to depart from
[38:25] Jerome and so he came to them so Paul
[38:28] meets these two people and because he
[38:31] was of the same craft in other words
[38:32] they they had something they did he
[38:35] Abode with them and they worked for by
[38:38] their occupation they were tent makers
[38:41] yeah they made tents they knew how to
[38:43] sew you know and so um they they made
[38:47] what we call affordable mobile buildings
[38:50] for working living traveling like
[38:53] economical RVs today you know and so we
[38:56] find these couple later in another study
[38:58] but uh Paul went to church when the
[39:00] doors were open I see we have brother
[39:02] Brown telling us that if God is living
[39:05] in your heart you can't wait for those
[39:07] doors to open
[39:09] see that sounds good and it's true
[39:11] there's got to be something inside here
[39:13] to attract you that's the word of God
[39:16] it's not personalities
[39:19] okay
[39:20] so they went to church they spoke only
[39:22] to the Jews and some Greeks and um so
[39:26] finally his helpers arrived in verse
[39:28] five from up North
[39:30] but the opposition was very great people
[39:32] were against what he was teaching says
[39:35] Paul was pressed in the spirit you know
[39:37] overcome one translation said he was not
[39:40] free to speak because the Jews opposed
[39:42] him and blasphemed as he testified that
[39:45] Jesus is the Christ
[39:47] I see some people have more
[39:50] patience than others
[39:52] but if somebody's going to say blaspheme
[39:55] what you're saying what you're preaching
[39:56] well we don't have no patience for that
[39:58] time's running out you know
[40:00] so this is a real turning point for Paul
[40:03] he worked hard he endured opposition
[40:05] beatings in prison
[40:07] but now he's facing open blasphemy it's
[40:11] bad you see so what do you do he didn't
[40:14] call Jerusalem he shook the dust off his
[40:16] feet and moved on look at that in verse
[40:19] 6 of 18 and when they opposed themselves
[40:22] and blasphemed he shook his reignent and
[40:25] said to them your blood be upon your own
[40:27] heads I am clean from thenceforth I will
[40:30] go to the Gentiles
[40:32] he'd had it with these these Jews that
[40:35] were constantly
[40:36] speaking against the blood of Jesus
[40:38] Christ you know and so sometimes you
[40:42] just got to push delete and go forward
[40:44] some things can't be fixed you know
[40:48] so it does get very emotional sometimes
[40:52] and you see we would like for everybody
[40:54] we'd like for all of our neighbors and
[40:56] our you know relatives to enjoy the
[41:00] truth and live in peace with God
[41:03] but some are just not wired to receive
[41:06] the truth
[41:07] we have what's called predestination
[41:09] some are not wired for truth others are
[41:13] wired for the bars and whatever
[41:15] we don't need a church full of people we
[41:17] just need Believers
[41:18] and so these people you know if you
[41:21] share with them too much they will
[41:23] eventually blaspheme and so you've got
[41:27] to move on and you can only help those
[41:29] that ask for help as soon as the
[41:32] minister understands that the better he
[41:34] can sleep at night because you try to
[41:36] help people and they just blast every
[41:37] time well forget it we got better things
[41:39] to do okay let's look at verse seven
[41:43] and he departed thence and entered into
[41:45] a certain man's house named justice okay
[41:48] and this man worshiped God and his house
[41:52] joined hard to the synagogue that means
[41:54] they shared a wall he lived right there
[41:55] next door to the church okay and uh
[41:58] Christmas the chief ruler of the
[42:00] synagogue believed on the Lord with all
[42:02] his house and many of the Corinthians
[42:04] heard and believed and were baptized
[42:06] okay it's looking good so far then speak
[42:09] the Lord to Paul in the Night by Vision
[42:11] be not afraid but speak and hold not
[42:14] your peace for I am with thee and no man
[42:17] shall set on thee to hurt thee for I
[42:21] have much people in this city and to
[42:23] continue there a year and six months
[42:25] teaching the word of God among them so
[42:28] here's Paul in Corinth 18 months setting
[42:31] the church in order and he was there by
[42:33] permission of a vision of the Lord
[42:36] so 12-17 once again we have the
[42:38] fanatical religious Jews they took Paul
[42:42] into court
[42:43] this guy is persuading men to worship
[42:45] God contrary to the law
[42:48] now these weren't
[42:49] you know agnostics these were Prophet
[42:52] believing Jews and they couldn't see
[42:55] past the Old Testament they had that
[42:57] ingrained in them and they couldn't see
[42:59] that the light moved on they were stuck
[43:01] back here with some truth but they were
[43:04] contrary to what kapal was teaching you
[43:06] know and he was only showing Christ from
[43:09] the word you know that they said they
[43:11] knew see he had a Ministry similar to
[43:13] William Branham the Bible says I'm here
[43:16] to tell you this day these scriptures
[43:18] are fulfilled that was basically his
[43:21] message see and so they said they knew
[43:24] it they knew it by see they didn't have
[43:25] Bibles very few people could read and so
[43:28] the priest would read the Bible they
[43:30] would believe and that's what they were
[43:31] stuck with you know well anyway they
[43:35] knew what they
[43:36] what they read but they had no
[43:38] Revelation so they realized when the
[43:42] judge realized this wasn't a civil case
[43:43] but a religious issue he dismissed them
[43:46] all okay out of here you know these
[43:48] people broke no law leave so the Greek
[43:50] citizens were really upset and so they
[43:52] beat up one of the chief rulers of the
[43:54] synagogue the law did nothing just
[43:56] looked the other way
[43:57] sounds like currently police you know
[44:01] same Spirits they haven't died so in
[44:04] verse 18 Paul goes off to Syria but he
[44:06] stopped off in Ephesus
[44:08] so he left equivalent Priscilla in
[44:10] Ephesus and they were very instrumental
[44:12] informing the church in Rome and Corinth
[44:15] and noun Ephesus the great husband and
[44:17] wife team and if you haven't seen the
[44:20] film Paul Apostle of Jesus Christ it is
[44:23] available online you can go buy it very
[44:26] very scriptural film that Hollywood made
[44:28] a few years ago and I even drugged the
[44:30] pastor and his wife into the theater we
[44:32] watched the movie
[44:34] yeah
[44:35] it won't hurt you
[44:37] it's not advised for small kids but it's
[44:39] a very very scriptural movie okay
[44:43] so now Paul's on his third missionary
[44:44] trip strengthening the disciples
[44:46] bringing words of encouragement okay
[44:48] look at verse 24.
[44:50] and a certain Jew named Apollos born in
[44:52] Alexandria
[44:54] an eloquent man and mighty in the
[44:56] scriptures came to Ephesus
[44:58] this man was instructed in the way of
[45:00] the Lord and being fervent in the spirit
[45:03] he spake and taught diligently the
[45:06] things of the Lord knowing only up to
[45:08] the baptism of John
[45:09] okay
[45:11] so meanwhile here's Priscilla and Aquila
[45:14] and this Jewish Man shows up apparently
[45:17] a very gifted teacher he knew his Bible
[45:19] he'd been taught but he lacked
[45:21] Revelation okay and so he was still back
[45:25] there with the baptism of John which was
[45:27] true just wasn't you know current
[45:29] and um it was marvelous in its day but
[45:32] the light had moved on so here's Apollos
[45:35] he's from Alexandria Egypt this was a
[45:38] very important city back then they had a
[45:41] vast Library which burned later but
[45:44] Alexandria is still a chief City in
[45:46] Egypt and that's where the the uh
[45:51] more readable and user-friendly Greek
[45:54] translation was made of the Old
[45:56] Testament commonly called the Septuagint
[45:58] that's where that was done that was
[46:00] finished about 200 years before Christ
[46:03] so Greek was a trade language commonly
[46:05] known amongst that part of the world and
[46:08] that would have been the Bible that
[46:10] Peter quoted from Jerusalem used by all
[46:12] the others uh Apollos and Paul and even
[46:15] today it's the Bible used by the Greek
[46:18] Orthodox Church in Istanbul Turkey
[46:21] there's just a lot of facts we're not
[46:23] going to repeat them so pay attention
[46:25] and so
[46:27] um
[46:28] this church in Turkey is the Eastern
[46:32] Catholic Church Rome is the Roman
[46:34] Catholic Church Headquarters Roman
[46:36] Catholic church and so at one time they
[46:39] were just it was one Church you see
[46:41] until they couldn't agree on Doctrine
[46:44] and they divided in the year 1054.
[46:48] but in February 2016 the two heads got
[46:51] together because it's going to be one
[46:53] church at the end we're going to be the
[46:56] odd man out we don't fit any of their
[46:58] patterns
[46:59] you know but we are the original
[47:00] Catholics
[47:02] we're in line with Peter
[47:04] okay verse 26.
[47:06] and he began to speak boldly in the
[47:08] synagogue
[47:09] when Aquila and Priscilla had heard they
[47:12] took him unto them so they invited him
[47:14] to lunch
[47:15] and expounded him the way of God more
[47:18] perfectly
[47:19] so more precisely the revelation of the
[47:22] word of God for the day in which they
[47:24] live see not the glare from another day
[47:27] that's right now Billy Graham did his
[47:29] job right each one did their job right
[47:31] but we're living here
[47:33] we take all the scripture we don't cut
[47:35] part of it out we believe it all you see
[47:38] and so they shared with whom what God
[47:41] was doing currently and um uh but
[47:45] there's a there's a certain scriptures
[47:46] allotted for each part of History yes
[47:49] we're living in the seventh age you see
[47:51] so we got all of that to be responsible
[47:53] for and our age so we love the word it
[47:56] feeds our soul but we're looking for the
[47:58] exit of laodicea we want to leave so the
[48:02] message continued to be the same and
[48:04] Apollos was speaking exactly as Paul was
[48:06] teaching showing publicly by the
[48:08] scriptures that Jesus was the Christ
[48:11] they had to prove it they never had a
[48:13] resurrection before
[48:15] and so um later you know the other
[48:17] doctrines would be revealed to him so
[48:20] getting into verse 19 chapter 19. so
[48:23] Apollos is holding meetings in Corinth
[48:25] and Paul's traveling and he came in
[48:28] contact with some Believers in Ephesus
[48:30] it was an important city back then of
[48:32] about 350 000 people
[48:35] and um Priscilla and Quilla were there
[48:37] and so he's made some new Believers he
[48:40] says verse two he said to them have you
[48:43] received the Holy Ghost sin she believed
[48:44] and they said we have not so much has
[48:47] even heard of such a thing you know and
[48:49] he said well how were you baptized
[48:51] we're baptized according to John's
[48:53] baptism then he said John truly baptized
[48:57] with the baptism of repentance saying
[48:59] unto the people that they should believe
[49:01] on him which should come after him that
[49:03] is on Christ Jesus when they believe
[49:06] this they were baptized in the name of
[49:09] the Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid
[49:11] his hands on them the Holy Ghost came to
[49:13] them
[49:14] on them and they speak with the tongues
[49:16] and prophesied and verse 7 says and all
[49:19] the men were about
[49:21] 12.
[49:23] great Apostle Paul stopped off and
[49:27] ministered to these people that says 12
[49:29] men so we can assume there might have
[49:31] been some women so there could have been
[49:32] 20 people we don't know but it says 12
[49:35] men that's a pretty pretty small group
[49:36] you know it's like two benches of people
[49:39] and it's part of part of our our
[49:41] scriptures
[49:42] they spend a lot of time you know
[49:45] putting down the details for our
[49:47] admonition that we could learn we could
[49:50] know how this thing started because we
[49:52] are the same family okay
[49:54] so
[49:56] um
[49:57] this was the same it was done in all
[50:00] through the scriptures the same baptism
[50:02] as they spread the gospel up until the
[50:05] Catholic Church changed it and went to
[50:08] the trinitarian baptism in the year 325
[50:11] for those of you that aren't aware of
[50:13] that so the baptism remained pure and
[50:16] simple in the name of Jesus Christ for
[50:18] just over 300 years and for these asked
[50:22] you know for these 1700 years the
[50:24] prevailing teaching has been precisely
[50:26] the red letter words of Jesus in the
[50:28] name of the Father and Son Holy Ghost
[50:30] but it's one name
[50:31] What's that name but they just smooth it
[50:34] over and we got this mess we have today
[50:37] but God rich and mercy sent a prophet to
[50:39] our age and showed it focused on the
[50:42] truth you see
[50:45] so Paul stayed there over two years he
[50:47] was Pastor in verse 10 so that all heard
[50:49] and uh I would suggest that as soon as
[50:52] you can go back to your church age book
[50:54] we have an English and Spanish and read
[50:56] chapter three carefully very carefully
[50:58] the
[51:01] Church of Ephesus so brother Brandon
[51:04] speaking about that he says here their
[51:05] persecutions back then and trials and
[51:08] patients were over the Blessed name of
[51:11] Jesus it wasn't you know when we when we
[51:14] Face the Lord we're not going to get a
[51:15] gold star because we had a broken
[51:16] fingernail nothing like that their whole
[51:19] problem was over the name of Jesus he
[51:22] says you know that is not at all strange
[51:23] for it is the word and the name that
[51:26] brings the enemy pouring after us like a
[51:27] flood that Mighty word which was
[51:30] manifested in healing signs and wonders
[51:32] and other demonstrations caused the
[51:34] Pharisees
[51:35] to um scream out for the death of the
[51:38] True Believers and now that name hated
[51:41] and despised by the Jews is mocked by
[51:44] the culture
[51:46] who are the cultured people
[51:48] that's the important the arrogant people
[51:50] see as they laugh to think that anyone
[51:53] could be so foolish as to believe in a
[51:55] man that died and rose again and now in
[51:58] heaven
[51:59] so here were the religious persecutors
[52:01] the Jews
[52:03] cursing this Jesus
[52:06] and whom to them was a false Messiah and
[52:10] here was others laughing with delight
[52:12] and mocking sarcastically at the name of
[52:14] a new God who to them wasn't a god at
[52:16] all
[52:17] now here's something else that started
[52:19] in that agent will continue right down
[52:20] Through the Ages even today getting
[52:23] deeper and darker that is people were
[52:25] repudiating that name that means refuse
[52:27] to recognize to reject
[52:30] it was not the true Ephesian church that
[52:32] was doing it no sir it was the false
[52:34] Apostles we got false Apostles amongst
[52:38] us
[52:39] carrying spoken word books
[52:41] saying great things but they're false
[52:45] so you gotta have discernment
[52:47] to know what's going on you see
[52:49] so the Ephesians knew that name and they
[52:51] loved it okay so in another place
[52:54] brother Brandon says uh this great
[52:55] servant Moses now as Moses went with the
[52:58] Judgment stick before him that same
[53:00] stick tonight to the church is Jesus
[53:02] Christ if those Egyptians could have
[53:04] ever got that little simple stick out of
[53:07] Moses hands they would have had him
[53:09] whipped and when the devil can ever get
[53:11] the deity out of the name of Jesus
[53:13] Christ he's got the church with yeah and
[53:15] they're doing it in churches today
[53:19] you see there's strong forces here in
[53:22] the 21st century anointed doing their
[53:25] best to remove the deity out of the name
[53:27] of Jesus Christ and put it over here in
[53:29] this man and this man whatever
[53:32] and there's no power that's right
[53:34] there's failure you see so
[53:37] um they're following personalities and
[53:39] not the god of the Bible
[53:41] so it's still tonight about the name of
[53:43] Jesus Christ
[53:45] and that's of course a sermon for
[53:46] another day but um
[53:49] verse one I'll say verse 11 of chapter
[53:51] 19. we have here it says and God brought
[53:56] special Miracles by the hands of Paul so
[53:59] he was very Anointed God was with him
[54:01] you know verse 12 so that from his body
[54:04] were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs
[54:06] and aprons and the diseases departed
[54:09] from them and the evil spirits went out
[54:11] of them now I've been to Rome many times
[54:14] first time we went you know we're just
[54:16] tourists looking around and they took us
[54:18] to where Paul's grave was and it's the
[54:21] stone isn't a nice you know pretty soon
[54:23] it's broken and so I asked him how come
[54:26] it's broken
[54:27] which I should have known better but you
[54:29] know I was young
[54:31] like you used to be
[54:33] and um
[54:34] it says on there Apostle Paul martyr
[54:38] and so the lady explained well you see
[54:39] said for years people have come here and
[54:42] they have a string and a piece of cloth
[54:44] and a rock and they tie it together and
[54:46] they'd
[54:48] when it hits they take it out and go and
[54:51] pray over people
[54:52] so right here
[54:54] the you know the Hankins were taken from
[54:56] his body well they were still doing that
[54:58] years later and in the year 2000 the
[55:01] pope said we're going to lift this
[55:02] sarcophagus out of the ground we're
[55:04] going to put it up everybody can see it
[55:06] so you can go now to the church there
[55:07] and see it right up close
[55:10] but anyway
[55:12] um in 13-20 we have What's called the
[55:14] Vagabond Jews these are freelance they
[55:17] were just doing things their way they're
[55:18] not Orthodox and there was a man named
[55:21] Siva and he was a chief priest among the
[55:24] Jews and he knew his prophet's words
[55:26] very well well he could quote it you
[55:28] know and so he had seven sons
[55:31] and they were into exercising evil
[55:34] spirits you know removing Spirits
[55:35] casting out demons and they heard about
[55:37] the success of Paul in verse 11 of you
[55:41] know we just read special miracles
[55:44] and they thought hey we should try that
[55:46] so they found a man with um with the
[55:49] evil spirit actually he was insane
[55:51] and in verse 13 we adjure you in the
[55:53] name of Jesus whom Paul preaches
[55:56] wait a minute they were not Witnesses
[55:59] like Paul
[56:00] they were what we call English wannabes
[56:02] they wish they could be like Paul you
[56:04] know so look at verse 15. it says here
[56:07] and uh and the evil spirit answered out
[56:10] of this whole this guy Jesus I know and
[56:14] Paul I know but who are you guys where'd
[56:16] you come from
[56:18] and the man in whom the evil spirit was
[56:20] leaped on these guys and overcame all
[56:24] seven of them
[56:25] and prevailed against them so that they
[56:28] had to run out of the house naked and
[56:31] wounded
[56:32] evil spirits had nothing to mess with
[56:34] if you don't know where you're standing
[56:36] leave it alone
[56:38] but in all that confusion verse 17 this
[56:41] was known called the Jews and Greeks
[56:44] dwelling in Ephesus and fear fell on
[56:46] them in the name of Jesus was magnified
[56:48] and many that believed came and
[56:51] confessed and showed their deeds so this
[56:53] this little encounter here with this
[56:55] crazy man and how what it did to these
[56:58] seven sons of the priest hey they all
[57:01] took notice and they said hey we better
[57:04] come clean too it might happen to us
[57:06] tomorrow so they brought all their their
[57:08] evil stuff which was you know like their
[57:10] black magic and their their all their
[57:12] stuff that wasn't of God they've brought
[57:14] it together
[57:15] and um many of them also used curious
[57:18] Arts that's what we call from the Dark
[57:21] Side of the occult and brought their
[57:24] books together and burned them right
[57:26] there in the street and they counted the
[57:28] price of them 50 000 pieces of silver
[57:32] okay now this is this is important that
[57:34] these details are here you see such was
[57:37] the conviction that Christ is real you
[57:39] know in his word and so The Magicians
[57:41] brought their stuff and they had a book
[57:43] burning and it's the only way to get rid
[57:46] of evil spirits you can't put it in the
[57:48] corner you can't sell it at the yard
[57:50] sale you got to burn it it's the way it
[57:52] happens you see and so they had a great
[57:54] Revival
[57:56] they were serious about following uh the
[57:59] way of Christ it's not optional uh it's
[58:03] not popular but they were convicted
[58:05] because the Holy Ghost preacher preached
[58:07] the truth let's see and so the value of
[58:11] the books equivalent to 50 000 days
[58:14] wages for one man or about the
[58:17] equivalent of 10 men's wages for 14
[58:19] years
[58:20] that's a lot of stuff
[58:22] but once they thought was valuable in a
[58:25] way of life was now trashing the fire
[58:28] that sound like the tape uh what is it
[58:31] um
[58:32] the token
[58:34] get all the trash out and burn it yeah
[58:38] and um anything contrary to Jesus Christ
[58:41] went in the fire
[58:42] they were serious they applied the token
[58:45] so Satan was on the scene but look at
[58:47] verse 20. so publicly so mightily grew
[58:51] the word of God and prevailed so with
[58:53] all this Burning verse 23 and the time
[58:57] at the same time there Rose no small
[58:59] stir about that way Well yeah if you if
[59:01] you burn all this stuff somebody's going
[59:03] to be upset mainly Satan you know
[59:07] and so um they call themselves of the
[59:10] way from I'm the way the truth and the
[59:11] life and that that word kind of stuck
[59:15] with them so then as usual you know
[59:17] there was the twin every meeting has
[59:20] three kinds of Believers and it's
[59:22] powerful as things were the twin was
[59:24] always there contradicting you see and
[59:27] so there was a Revival and the people
[59:30] you know they turned from idol worship
[59:32] and turned away from their favorite
[59:34] personalities or being baptized they
[59:36] were following the way but the ones
[59:38] making the idols the ones writing those
[59:41] books and all that they got upset we're
[59:44] going to starve you know and so
[59:46] Demetrius was a silversmith in Ephesus
[59:49] and craft the elaborate shrines for the
[59:52] Temple of Diana
[59:54] that's the Roman name our Artemis was
[59:56] the Greek name so they had a union
[59:58] meeting of the the guys that worked in
[1:00:00] this business verse 25
[1:00:02] says here whom uh he called together the
[1:00:06] Workman of the like occupation and um
[1:00:10] said now sirs you know that by this
[1:00:12] craft we have our wealth moreover you
[1:00:15] see and hear that not alone in nephesus
[1:00:17] but all over Asia this Paul has
[1:00:20] persuaded and turned away people saying
[1:00:22] that there be no Gods which are made
[1:00:24] with hands which is nothing but the
[1:00:26] truth you know
[1:00:28] so that not only is our craft in danger
[1:00:32] and to become you know worthless but
[1:00:35] also that the Temple of the Great
[1:00:36] Goddess Diana should be despised and her
[1:00:39] magnificence should be destroyed whom
[1:00:41] all Asia and the world worshiped so they
[1:00:44] were convinced that everybody was
[1:00:45] worshiped by Diana and here's one
[1:00:47] preacher preaching against it and the
[1:00:49] whole thing's going to come to zero so
[1:00:51] they're worried you know so they had a
[1:00:53] meeting and they all got you can read it
[1:00:55] all for yourself they got all excited
[1:00:57] and started screaming and hollering
[1:01:00] but the blessings of God were with the
[1:01:02] Saints you know and uh so in verse 32 it
[1:01:07] says here um
[1:01:08] and some therefore cried one thing and
[1:01:11] another for the assembly was confused
[1:01:13] and the more part knew not wherever they
[1:01:16] were even come together
[1:01:19] sounds like America
[1:01:21] the riots we had recently then you know
[1:01:23] why they're there they paid him twenty
[1:01:25] dollars in a bus ticket they go down
[1:01:26] there and make a scene so they had the
[1:01:28] same thing going on back there you know
[1:01:30] so in verse 30 and 31 Paul wanted to go
[1:01:33] in and help he wanted to set things
[1:01:34] straight but his friends and companions
[1:01:36] stopped him no it's too dangerous now so
[1:01:38] it was a well-calculated Ruckus what it
[1:01:40] was and It produced organized confusion
[1:01:44] but their attention was focused on
[1:01:46] Alexander in verse 34 when they knew
[1:01:49] that he was a Jew all with one voice in
[1:01:52] the space of two hours cried out great
[1:01:54] as Diana of the Ephesians they were
[1:01:56] screaming and hollering you know
[1:01:58] so
[1:01:59] it's not so different from from what's
[1:02:01] going on you know in our world
[1:02:04] so we have a religious riot in emphasis
[1:02:06] because of the way and what it produced
[1:02:09] what's that It produced God fearing
[1:02:11] Christians they weren't doing the
[1:02:13] burning they were trying to live right
[1:02:14] they're willing to take a stand for the
[1:02:16] truth no matter what the relatives
[1:02:18] thought or what they believed and these
[1:02:21] were our brothers and sisters this isn't
[1:02:23] something you know the same line right
[1:02:25] till tonight you see and they were the
[1:02:28] present-day fulfillment of Hebrews 13 8.
[1:02:31] so back in 1950 brother Brandon said
[1:02:33] Behold the Lamb of God get ready wake up
[1:02:35] lift up your heads Redemption is drawing
[1:02:37] nigh get ready signs and wonders
[1:02:39] appearing critics infidels waxing worse
[1:02:42] and worse
[1:02:43] so that was a long time ago in 1950 they
[1:02:46] were already showing up it didn't just
[1:02:48] happen this last five years you see he
[1:02:50] says we've got to put up with them but
[1:02:52] we're not looking to them we're looking
[1:02:54] to God
[1:02:55] you've got to focus on the word John 8
[1:02:58] 32 you shall know the truth how are you
[1:03:00] going to know the truth because you have
[1:03:02] a Bible on the on the on the nightstand
[1:03:03] no you got to get into it
[1:03:07] you know Sister Jerry makes pretty good
[1:03:09] pies pretty much almost five star a lot
[1:03:11] of times
[1:03:12] but she had to read she had to learn
[1:03:14] that
[1:03:15] whatever you do you had to learn it and
[1:03:17] so you shall know the truth and the
[1:03:19] truth shall make you free
[1:03:22] what's the alternative stay in prison
[1:03:24] stay ignorant you know you've got to get
[1:03:27] into the word and and learn what it says
[1:03:29] so the believer is secure and they're
[1:03:32] fortified by the word of God and he
[1:03:34] knows what first John 4 4 says greater
[1:03:36] is he that's in you that's right than he
[1:03:37] that's in the world we don't fear what's
[1:03:39] going on in the world we know where we
[1:03:41] stand
[1:03:42] and Jesus prayed for you and I yeah look
[1:03:45] over John 17. Jesus is praying
[1:03:49] and this is before he ever went to the
[1:03:51] cross
[1:03:52] and it says here in verse 20 of 17. it
[1:03:56] says here neither pray I for these alone
[1:03:59] these guys right here but for them also
[1:04:01] which Shall Believe on me through their
[1:04:04] word amen that they all may be one
[1:04:08] as thou father art in me I in thee that
[1:04:11] they also may be one in us that the
[1:04:14] world may believe that thou has sent me
[1:04:17] so that's what we're studying the
[1:04:19] testimony of these guys that were there
[1:04:21] it's scripture it's real and that's why
[1:04:24] we believe okay so you were in the
[1:04:26] thoughts of Jesus Christ long before he
[1:04:29] went to the cross and he loves you so
[1:04:31] much that he died for you
[1:04:33] you were on his mind see
[1:04:36] so this crisis that they had there it
[1:04:39] came to came to nothing the mayor of the
[1:04:41] city said hey going home so we get into
[1:04:44] verse 20 of verse 1 of chapter 20 and
[1:04:46] we're not going to be long is it still
[1:04:48] light outside or free parking so it's
[1:04:50] okay
[1:04:53] brother Paul said I could go to a
[1:04:54] midnight wanted but you're probably
[1:04:56] alone
[1:04:57] so verse 1 of chapter 20 and after the
[1:04:59] Uproar was deceased so they had a big
[1:05:02] big Riot about all this stuff the big
[1:05:04] fire and everything after that was done
[1:05:05] Paul called unto him the disciples and
[1:05:08] embraced them and departed for it to go
[1:05:10] to Macedonia
[1:05:12] okay so after the riot he has a meeting
[1:05:14] they prayed so the text goes on to
[1:05:17] mention several of his faithful
[1:05:19] traveling companions seven helpers of
[1:05:21] significance verse six they sailed for
[1:05:23] five days to cover 200 miles
[1:05:27] now we can't quite comprehend that
[1:05:29] you know how far is it to Seattle
[1:05:33] 600 miles
[1:05:34] yeah I flew the other night 57 minutes
[1:05:36] from here we can't understand this five
[1:05:39] days but they were in a boat and the
[1:05:42] boat had to be the wind had to blow and
[1:05:43] so forth so
[1:05:45] sometimes they could even row it but
[1:05:47] they were patient people they didn't
[1:05:49] have another choice we live in a world
[1:05:51] of many choices you know when you bring
[1:05:54] it up on your phone you can walk you
[1:05:55] take the bus you can take you know
[1:05:56] whatever and um so we have many choice
[1:06:00] of restaurants and everything and but
[1:06:03] even today down in Brazil
[1:06:05] from from the city of manaus out to the
[1:06:08] ocean it's um it's 1200 miles and in a
[1:06:12] diesel barge this takes six days just
[1:06:16] don't go that far so not everybody lives
[1:06:19] like we do you know so anyway they're
[1:06:21] with the Believers in troas for seven
[1:06:23] days troaz is in Turkey it was a Roman
[1:06:27] Seaport and the working people gathered
[1:06:29] together to um
[1:06:31] to spend the evening with Paul and learn
[1:06:34] more about the faith they were following
[1:06:36] the pattern established in the beginning
[1:06:37] coming together around the apostles
[1:06:39] teaching for Fellowship for daily
[1:06:41] breaking of bread chapter two and
[1:06:44] brother random said that they partook of
[1:06:45] communion on each occasion because the
[1:06:48] scripture says do this in remembrance of
[1:06:51] me as often as you do this remember my
[1:06:53] death there's nothing in your Bible
[1:06:54] about remember my birth and all these
[1:06:57] presence and all this stuff no remember
[1:06:59] my death you see so
[1:07:02] verse 7 of chapter 20 it says and upon
[1:07:05] the first day of the week when the
[1:07:07] disciples came together to break bread
[1:07:09] Paul preached unto them ready to depart
[1:07:12] on the next day and continued his speech
[1:07:16] until midnight
[1:07:18] yeah
[1:07:19] they had long church he had a lot to say
[1:07:22] they were listening you know and so we
[1:07:25] knew we noticed throughout our study
[1:07:27] that Paul and his associates always made
[1:07:29] a point of going to church with the Jews
[1:07:31] on the Sabbath in their synagogues and
[1:07:33] these were the early missionaries that
[1:07:36] took the gospel whenever and wherever
[1:07:38] there was somebody to listen even down
[1:07:41] at the river in chapter 16 and Lydia and
[1:07:43] so forth and here for the first time is
[1:07:46] mentioned that they came to break bread
[1:07:48] on the first day of the week
[1:07:50] we just take all this for granted let's
[1:07:52] see here we're in chapter 20 the first
[1:07:54] time they even mentioned that so two
[1:07:55] points the early church were
[1:07:57] specifically worn against submitting
[1:08:00] themselves to the bondage of any
[1:08:02] legalistic observant of Sabbath days you
[1:08:05] see so these early churches voluntarily
[1:08:07] chose the first day of the week as an
[1:08:10] appropriate time for Fellowship of
[1:08:11] worship and remembrance of the day that
[1:08:14] our Lord arose okay and it's a you know
[1:08:17] in the four Gospels
[1:08:19] so new day new people new creation and
[1:08:22] the observance of the first day of the
[1:08:24] week also many of the early writings
[1:08:25] even to irenius and the second Church
[1:08:27] age so here's Paul having a communion
[1:08:29] service with the Saints in troas and
[1:08:32] he's leaving the next day okay so he's
[1:08:35] preaching very very long and he had a
[1:08:38] lot to tell them still preaching at
[1:08:40] midnight verse 8 has some details and
[1:08:43] there are many lights in the upper
[1:08:44] chamber where they were gathered
[1:08:46] together now why is that important
[1:08:48] because they didn't have lights like
[1:08:50] these they had fire burning many many
[1:08:52] torches they're in upstairs heat goes up
[1:08:56] so it's you know how it is when see
[1:08:58] that's why we have air conditioning then
[1:09:00] used to have air conditioning
[1:09:02] right brother Paul yeah years ago
[1:09:05] just open the windows we can't open
[1:09:06] these windows and so we have air
[1:09:08] conditioning so nobody go to sleep but
[1:09:10] if
[1:09:11] somebody gets tired
[1:09:14] I have a magic way of keeping you awake
[1:09:18] so don't even think about it
[1:09:21] so they're in their separate chamber
[1:09:22] it's warm and the next verse says and
[1:09:25] they were sat in the window a certain
[1:09:27] young man named euticus
[1:09:29] and he fell asleep
[1:09:32] and as Paul was long preaching he sang
[1:09:35] down with sleep and he fell out of the
[1:09:38] third window and they thought he was
[1:09:39] dead
[1:09:41] sounds bad but that's what happened you
[1:09:44] know
[1:09:45] and so um he's having this this service
[1:09:48] in verse 10 and Paul went down fell on
[1:09:52] him embraced him trouble not yourselves
[1:09:54] hey he's alive and when he therefore was
[1:09:57] come up again to the for the meeting
[1:10:00] they broke bread ate talked a long while
[1:10:03] even until the break of Dave and he
[1:10:06] Departed
[1:10:07] so all night church I had communion he
[1:10:10] left all these little details are in
[1:10:12] your Bible you know I'm just so thankful
[1:10:14] that we have brother Luke back there
[1:10:17] writing all this stuff's not downhill so
[1:10:19] now he's on his way to Jerusalem he's
[1:10:21] headed to Jerusalem for the Feast of
[1:10:23] Pentecost which is 50 days after the
[1:10:25] resurrection chapter 2 of Acts and um it
[1:10:30] seems like they were in a hurry from
[1:10:31] everything we can read here so they
[1:10:32] stopped at a place called militas
[1:10:36] um and he sent a messenger because see
[1:10:37] they're they're in the they're in the
[1:10:38] water they're in the Mediterranean
[1:10:40] and they come to the little Port so he
[1:10:43] sent some Messengers up to miletus to
[1:10:46] call the Elders of the Church of
[1:10:48] emphasis they came down to the port to
[1:10:50] see him
[1:10:51] and verse 18. let's see what we have
[1:10:54] here 18. and when they were come to him
[1:10:57] he said to them you know from the first
[1:11:01] day that I came unto Asia after what
[1:11:04] Manner I have been with you at all
[1:11:06] seasons serving the Lord with all
[1:11:08] humility of mine with many tears and
[1:11:11] temptations which befill Me by lying in
[1:11:15] weight by the of the Jews and now I kept
[1:11:18] dot back anything from you everything
[1:11:20] profitable I told you and so he preaches
[1:11:22] to him a while and um it's a basically a
[1:11:25] farewell speech to the church leaders he
[1:11:28] felt compelled to go to Jerusalem and
[1:11:30] the Saints at every stop said don't go
[1:11:32] they're going to hurt you but look at
[1:11:34] verse uh look at verse 25 for example
[1:11:37] and now behold I know that you all among
[1:11:40] whom I have gone preaching the kingdom
[1:11:42] of God shall see my face no more
[1:11:45] that's a sad announcement this is their
[1:11:48] father in The Gospel this is the man of
[1:11:49] the hour
[1:11:50] you're not going to see me no more I'm
[1:11:52] going you know look at 27 for I have not
[1:11:55] shunned to declare unto you all the
[1:11:58] counsel of God everything God told me
[1:11:59] I've told you
[1:12:01] 28. take heed therefore unto yourselves
[1:12:05] and to the flock so he's he's talking to
[1:12:08] the ministers there at that place take
[1:12:10] heed uh all the flock over which the
[1:12:13] Holy Ghost has made you overseers feed
[1:12:16] the Church of God which he hath
[1:12:18] purchased with his own blood for I know
[1:12:20] this that after my departing
[1:12:23] Grievous hungry wolves are going to come
[1:12:25] in and spare nobody
[1:12:28] also of your own selves shall men arise
[1:12:31] speaking perverse things to draw
[1:12:34] disciples after themselves that's called
[1:12:36] control I want it my way care what you
[1:12:39] think that was going on clear back there
[1:12:41] therefore watch and remember that by the
[1:12:44] space of three years I cease not to warn
[1:12:46] every man night and day with tears
[1:12:50] and um
[1:12:51] he goes on speaking to him down in verse
[1:12:54] 38 Sorrowing most of all says here and
[1:12:57] they they all wept and fell on Paul's
[1:13:00] neck and kissed him souring most of all
[1:13:03] like his words that he spoke that they
[1:13:05] should see his face no more and they
[1:13:07] accompany him onto the ship so they
[1:13:09] helped him onto the ship and he went on
[1:13:11] their their father in The Gospel he's
[1:13:13] leaving you know it's sad day and so he
[1:13:17] was the messenger from God and they
[1:13:19] actually never saw him again they
[1:13:21] received a last letter written from the
[1:13:23] prisoner in Rome the epistle to the
[1:13:25] Ephesians so that's the end of chapter
[1:13:28] 20. and um uh we're gonna be here again
[1:13:32] tomorrow
[1:13:33] we're going to finish the book
[1:13:36] yeah because you got plenty to chew on
[1:13:37] for tonight
[1:13:38] some of you is paying attention others
[1:13:41] were
[1:13:44] so may God bless you it's been a
[1:13:47] pleasure being with you
[1:13:48] and we'll continue what time tomorrow
[1:13:52] 10 30.
[1:13:54] yeah don't be late we pray that brother
[1:13:56] Jose can make it so come on brother Paul
[1:13:59] thank you for your attention
[1:14:03] [Applause]
[1:14:09] all things work together
[1:14:16] our brother George and um you know it
[1:14:19] just even lovely to set and have
[1:14:22] Conversation Over
[1:14:24] the book amen just to to be able to just
[1:14:29] talk and see and and you know the word
[1:14:33] has been revealed
[1:14:36] amen we're not going out to try and find
[1:14:39] it again it's been given to us it's here
[1:14:42] but sometimes we need to have our
[1:14:45] understanding stimulated to be able to
[1:14:48] look and realize and when you think
[1:14:50] about this I I want to you know brother
[1:14:52] George said a couple words that really
[1:14:54] struck me a price a precise record was
[1:14:58] recorded and my brother and sister
[1:15:00] there's been a precise record recorded
[1:15:03] in this day and I want you to just think
[1:15:06] about the record that is being written
[1:15:09] about this bride of Christ in this hour
[1:15:12] right now everything that God has said
[1:15:16] the word says He will do and I'm telling
[1:15:20] you I can look in my Bible and I can
[1:15:22] look in my life and I'm seeing it happen
[1:15:26] amen it's not me doing it it's not you
[1:15:29] doing it it's Christ in you doing it the
[1:15:34] word is alive amen and we are sitting
[1:15:39] here today and if we are paying
[1:15:41] attention
[1:15:43] we can literally see it unfold in front
[1:15:48] of us
[1:15:50] it is happening
[1:15:52] now the critic I want you to just think
[1:15:54] about this I'm not not trying to preach
[1:15:56] here but just a little excited for a
[1:15:58] moment I want you to think about this in
[1:16:01] the world today what do they do our
[1:16:03] government is doing what it wants to do
[1:16:06] what it's anointed to do and they always
[1:16:09] have a distraction
[1:16:11] but this just struck me brother George
[1:16:13] is saying now you guys Focus come on
[1:16:15] let's focus so what happens is Satan has
[1:16:19] a distraction but God has his own way of
[1:16:22] catching our attention
[1:16:24] he's drawing us to the word and the
[1:16:27] world is being drawn to wars and rumors
[1:16:30] of wars and economic crisis and
[1:16:32] pandemics and moral decays and and the
[1:16:35] bride is caught to the word she's being
[1:16:39] called to the word all she hears is a
[1:16:41] voice saying come up higher come to the
[1:16:44] word amen I thank God that the word is
[1:16:48] what has caught our attention amen not
[1:16:50] personality amen not size not how great
[1:16:54] the building is but the word has become
[1:16:58] everything to you and I amen what is it
[1:17:01] the word says that we are the final
[1:17:04] voice
[1:17:06] amen my brother and sister if we're the
[1:17:09] final voice what are we saying
[1:17:12] what are we saying if our voice
[1:17:14] literally became the absolute final
[1:17:17] voice Lord what is our voice saying
[1:17:21] I want my voice to say my God is an
[1:17:24] awesome God I want my voice to be lifted
[1:17:27] up to say the word is coming to pass in
[1:17:30] me I want the my voice to be able to say
[1:17:34] I believe every word of my Bible and I
[1:17:39] believe that the word said that I would
[1:17:41] rise above the laodicea and I will be a
[1:17:45] conqueror and I will walk with him and I
[1:17:48] have been called to be a representation
[1:17:52] of my husband
[1:17:54] oh my brother and sister I know many
[1:17:57] years ago in Chile when when I went down
[1:18:00] there the first times and and uh
[1:18:02] preaching and traveling and then the
[1:18:05] next year we just felt led of God to
[1:18:07] take sister Jerry with us and and we
[1:18:09] remember this with humor in our house
[1:18:11] and and uh brothers and sisters come and
[1:18:14] they said Oh Brother Paul we've met
[1:18:16] sister Jerry yes my lovely wife
[1:18:21] hmm now we know who you are
[1:18:28] come on
[1:18:30] we are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:18:33] let the world know who our Lord and
[1:18:37] savior is
[1:18:39] let them look at the bride and be able
[1:18:42] to say now we know who he is
[1:18:45] amen hallelujah hallelujah I had to
[1:18:49] cheat I think brother George called me
[1:18:51] out there when he caught my attention
[1:18:52] because I was looking up a quote
[1:18:55] and uh anyway maybe I was the one not
[1:18:59] paying attention and I want you all to
[1:19:01] know that when when he got took me to
[1:19:03] the theater I have repented from that
[1:19:09] but it is good
[1:19:12] you get to see really very clearly Paul
[1:19:17] did not live an easy life
[1:19:21] he led a life that a still Small Voice
[1:19:26] directed him
[1:19:28] and he obeyed amen
[1:19:33] amen I really want to preach
[1:19:36] that's a problem with preachers but the
[1:19:38] prophet of God says several times in
[1:19:40] various ways and I won't go ahead and
[1:19:42] quote them but he's talking about if
[1:19:44] God's put out another branch in this day
[1:19:46] it will be another book of Acts and my
[1:19:50] brother and sister the branch has come
[1:19:52] forth it is producing amen there is a
[1:19:55] Bride come out of this word we know the
[1:19:58] prophet's message is true because it's
[1:20:00] producing exactly what it said it would
[1:20:03] produce amen we don't have to change it
[1:20:06] to another idea we don't have to modify
[1:20:10] it for the culture for the age for the
[1:20:12] time but we can stand on the word of God
[1:20:15] and realize the book is not just being
[1:20:19] eaten the book is producing
[1:20:24] I say thank you Lord let's give the Lord
[1:20:26] a little hand clap of praise
[1:20:30] Hallelujah
[1:20:35] Hallelujah
[1:20:38] the word is producing that book of Acts
[1:20:40] again amen let's just stand amen
[1:20:43] enlisting the song Here Sister Sarah if
[1:20:46] you'd come please musicians
[1:20:48] when I think of the goodness of Jesus
[1:20:51] I had all kinds of little notes here you
[1:20:54] know part of that precise record that's
[1:20:56] recorded
[1:20:57] is a record that showed your name
[1:21:01] on a Lamb's Book
[1:21:03] amen and then we come forward in time
[1:21:06] and it shows where Satan tried to derail
[1:21:10] us
[1:21:11] distract us turn our attention away and
[1:21:15] we ended up in dancehalls and bar rooms
[1:21:18] and we ended up caught up in money and
[1:21:19] we got caught up in this and we were
[1:21:21] caught up in ourself
[1:21:24] and the record shows that at the calling
[1:21:27] of the word
[1:21:28] [Music]
