confirming that and um so that would be U uh we're a little slow getting started on that I I'm sorry coming back into the year here but seemed like every time that I thought we'll start this there was a little something right on that time space and uh I I should have just pressed forward so forgive me for that and uh we just uh look forward to our young people uh being back I just love fellowshipping with them as I uh am fortunate blessed to speak to the young adults it's quite interesting as you speak to them to see their reactions to things I I see um this might be a little pointed forgive me but I see siblings sometimes looking out of the corners of their eyes at each other like yeah he's talking to you uh but then other times I see them making fun of each other and um it's just good it's fun I enjoy it and I pray that there'll be something of it will be a blessing this this morning with absolute Joy if I could jump and click my heels together I would jump and click my heels together and um sister Rachel would you come to the platform Amen brother Alex we want the camera to catch a very clear shot of huh you want let's be over here okay amen so this is something that we have been blessed to witness uh coming to pass to see the the progression and uh my heart has rejoiced uh to see two young people well maybe not so young but anyway uh two young people uh fall in love and and and it's amazing to watch that you know some of us are old enough now we remember that we did that we just don't remember how we did that and um but today uh it is with great pleasure sister Rachel you're not in the background yes there you go and it's okay if your sleeves touch it is with great joy that we announce the engagement of our brother Alex and our sister Rachel it is to me such a pleasure to to uh be associated with them uh been a lot of years you know I first met sister Rachel she was maybe like this and then a lot of years in a gap and then to be reintroduced and to see such a Godly young lady such a heart's desire and brother Alex I I've witnessed when he first moved here I've witnessed this steady growth I've just witnessed this maturity would you agree with me witnessed this matur coming forth and seeing come forth and and just displaying the many talents that God has placed in him and uh you know is is such a contribution I'm going to tell on you brother Alex he he didn't feel good and so the the uh labor of being song leader this morning fell on me brother Isaac doesn't feel good brother Alex didn't feel good but he come in the office and he just says um I can lead songs praise the Lord do you feel better not really I can do this for you do you want to do this well if you want me to I said I'm not making that decision and you see his desire to serve was more than the the Affliction uh or sickness on him and uh I think he's doing a lovely job this morning and uh so I look at that and and I want to comment on sister one more time here and that is here's a young lady with a heart to serve you know to to just see that desire in her uh that she is willing to put the extra little effort uh and uh you know you see that often times

this morning welcome you all the precious name of the Lord we're happy to we actually just feel like family already we want to appre say thank you brother Paul for having me and my family and and uh sometimes when you go into a church you got ice to break and uh but there's really no ice to break we've just felt such a warm welcome and we want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts we just

Rachel uh beginning a New Journey in their life and I think it's wonderful you know we as we get older it goes quick you see you see your own life coming and you're like I was there in that season and so we know how to pray amen we know how to pray for one another and so we just want to say congratulations may God be with them also before we get into the word I know we're bit maybe a little lengthy this morning um we just want to thank you for your prayers earnestly I thank you from the bottom of my heart Samuel had a reactive Airway attack in in the mountain there we had had no idea that it was coming next thing you know I'm in the front seat of a LifeLight and Samuel's in the back and uh the Lord undertook just a hand of almighty God and I want to thank you for your prayers Prayer Changes Things and the Lord does things in such ways that you could miss it if you weren't really spiritual and so I want to stand before this congregation and say thank you Lord for saving my son protecting my son and I want to thank you the Church of the Living God for praying and being an intercessors God bless you let's go straight to the scriptures we thank you all for all the song specials in the atmosphere that has been provided I've just enjoyed it immensely we're going to turn to Second cor uh Corinthians chapter 3 I love the word of God and I I don't I don't believe we can get enough and it should never be common amen it should be our heart's desire never to let it become common amen and I want to encourage all young people to let the word be the love of your life even married couples just like you can't let the love diminish neither can you let the love for the word of God diminish from your life so second Corinthians Ians chapter 3 and I want to begin with verse 17 and then we'll turn back to Exodus chap 23 praise the Lord everybody there amen amen 2 Corinthians 3:17 now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is a liberty but we all with an open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory amen even as by the spirit of the Lord amen Exodus chapter 23 brother if you could I I don't want to hurt the congregation that'll be counterproductive but if you can give me a little more here I'm one of those preachers that like the monitors hot it helps me preach Exodus chapter 23 praise the Lord praise the Lord is that too loud are you okay out there be honest Glory okay praise the Lord thank you brother I have just a touch of rebound maybe just just a touch down not much I like it okay Exodus 23 thank you brother Exodus 23:20 everybody there amen amen behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared yes thank you Lord I want to speak this morning on changed from glory to glory amen anyone have a need you'd like to lift before the Lord let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this atmosphere that we step into knowing Lord that you are the the one to be glorified in our midst and the only provided place of worship is in Christ Jesus so Lord we are asking Lord you take us up into Heavenly places and Lord May the spirit of God have preeminence and may there be Liberty for you to speak to every heart Lord we are like human beings like magnets Lord that would pull mistakes our way and pull trouble our way but Lord you are the one that guides us through this world so we pray wash Us in the blood of Jesus Christ and may we walk in the spirit of God Lord give us Mana from heaven we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you can have your seats thank you here in Exodus 23: 20 it says behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring bring thee into the place that I have prepared amen praise the Lord God has not left us alone but he sent an angel to lead us into the promises of God and we know that there is a direct parallel between the Old Testament and the New Testament we know that God did not send an angel to the old and withhold from the new but that actually that angel as we understand in the scriptures we can follow from Genesis to revelations in Nehemiah 9:12 just to get our footing here Nehemiah 9:12 says moreover thou lest them in the day by a cloudy pillar and in the Night by a pillar of fire to give them light in the way wherein they should go isn't that wonderful in verse 19 of the same chapter it says yet thou was in thy manifold mercies yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsook us them not in the wilderness and the pillar of cloud departed not from them by day to lead them in the way neither the pillar of Fire by night to show them light and the way that they should go so if they wanted to make it to Canaan they had to follow the angel of the Lord and if they were following the angel of the Lord they were sure to make Canaan everybody love the Lord now if you will turn with me as I get my footing Numbers Chapter N9 turn there and we'll start with verse 15 numbers 9 verse 15 everybody there listen now on the day that the Tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the Tabernacle namely the tent of the testimony and at evening there was upon the Tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire until morning and then the cloud was I'm sorry so sorry verse 16 and so it was always the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of Fire by Night both was the angel of the Lord verse 17 and when the cloud was taken up from the Tabernacle then after that the children of Israel journeyed and in the place where the cloud Abode the children of Israel pitched their tents and at the command commment of the Lord the children of Israel journeyed at the Commandment of the Lord they pitched and as long as the cloud Abode upon the Tabernacle they rested in their tents and when the cloud carried long upon the Tabernacle many days then the children of Israel kept the charge of the Lord and journeyed not verse 20 and so it was when the cloud was a few days upon the Tabernacle according to the Commandment of the Lord they Abode in their tents and according to the Commandment of the Lord they journeyed and so it was when the cloud Abode from evening to morning that the cloud was taken up in the morning then they journeyed whether it was by day or by Night the cloud was taken up they journeyed amen hallelujah or whether it was two days or a month or a year that the cloud carried upon the Tabernacle remaining thereon the children of Israel above in their tents and they journeyed not but when it was taken up they journeyed and at the Commandment of the Lord they rested in their tents and at the Commandment of the Lord they journeyed and they kept charge of the Lord at the Commandment of the Lord praise the Lord amen and by the hand of Moses this is a wonderful thing because the Church of the Living God moved as God moved them and the priest God commanded them to make two silver trumpets and the priest's job was to study the pillar of fire and when the pillar of fire moved then the priest would begin to sound to Israel it's time to pack your tents it's time to pull your Stakes it's time to go whether it was two in the morning or 3 in the morning or 4 in the morning when when God moved the church moved praise the Lord and the pillar of fire moved and the church moved with it am the trumpets would blast and the people would move are you with me because God said I will bring you to the place that I have prepared God made the promise God promised to guide us to that promise if you want healing the spirit will guide you to Healing if you want salvation God will need you to Salvation if you want the Holy Ghost God will guide you to the Holy Ghost how many believe that and brother brandom said the angel of the Lord accompanies the message always are we preaching the message this morning the angel of the Lord is with us how many believe that that the angel of the Lord is among his people now brother brandham said the true church would follow follow the pillar of fire day or night at any time and he said Luther saw the pillar of fire moving out of the Dark Ages and he sounded a gospel trumpet it's time to move and the elect of that day heard the gospel trumpet and they Rose and they moved with Luther praise the Lord amen we find the same thing with Wesley we find the same thing with Pentecost and he said now when God moves you cannot organize it that's it we cannot put offense around the message the message came to set us free from organization not to make another one and we are not bound by Doctrine we're not bound by Ministry we are a free people in Christ that are followers of the pillar of fire we move as God moves as a church and as individuals and brother bham said now we are to follow every day every hour of the day every step of the way we must be led by Jesus Christ and the Lord went before them amen Marching In The Light of the pillar of fire do you know that as we journey we're walking towards a destination and that we are moving towards a millennium and we are walking not just with Doctrine but we're walking in the Glorious light of the pillar of fire hallu we are a free people a different people that is not bound but we're a living moving Christ the the shakana the presence of godallah that accompanies his message always is with us amen amen praise the Lord says the Exodus 3:1 if you want to pull that up the Lord tells Moses come now therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt and Moses said unto God who am I that I should go un Pharaoh that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt and God said certainly I will be with thee amen right so Moses certainly was not confident in his own ability he was not resting upon his own ability to navigate a people moses' job was to follow the pillar of fire it was God leading his people not Moses Moses was used of God the people saw Moses and Moes Moses was following the pillar of fire now Moses how am I going to feed two million people how am I going to give first aid to every cut and every broken bone and and every you know anxiety how many babies are born in a night how am I going to handle this but it wasn't Moses God said I will be with thee that's an encouragement to preachers that it isn't us that can bear the people's burden but it is the word that'll bear the burden and we're only pointing you to the pillar of fire amen amen hallelujah it was a CO it was a comfort to Moses now when they came to the Red Sea God made the way because he is the way maker Hallelujah when Moses came to the Red Sea he goes Lord what do I do he said speak and go forward so when Moses couldn't go any further God could take him on that's how we are sometimes we're discouraged because life is real Church problems are real we have problems everywhere wherever the devil is there is problems but God gives us a word that will bring us forward hallelujah hallelujah how many believe that speak tell them to go forward forward brother bham said there is no retreat in God God don't retreat it isn't God that Retreats from cancer it isn't God that Retreats from church problems it is God that goes forward God help us to come under the influence of the Holy Spirit we try many times in our own strength and we fail that's it and brother brandham was prophet enough man enough to show us that men fail he told us he didn't have to he told us he told a lie Under Pressure amen we can't relate to 30 to 40 Visions a day but we can relate to a man under pressure telling a lie and God dealing with him not condemning you ain't even fit to use but God turned him around and he used it to help us that's right ain't that wonderful that's it don't condemn yourself for your mistakes use them as stepping stones to help the young people praise the Lord but another lesson this teaches us is we are not to stay on the same ground that's it I don't care how big the wall is how big the mountain is how big Jericho is the word will take you forward if you wanted to open up speak the word and go forward how many want to go forward in Christ take God at his word and God will take you forward whether it be Devils or sickness or it just circumstances that are too big for you that's right amen speak and go forward have you ever been to a place that you think I can't make it another day yes sir but you do make it another day how did you make it it wasn't you did you ever come to a place you said how will I never get out of this and then a year later you have forgotten and God took you right through it and you did make it sir you're still serving God won't he take care of every giant won't he take care of every sickness and every Church problem and every discouragement hasn't he brought you this far speak and go forward hallelujah hallelujah now the Bible tells us in numbers 21:4 if you'll pull that up numbers 21:4 says and they journeyed from Mount by the way of the Red Sea to Compass the land of Edom and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way so the way that God God LED them was a very difficult place right and let me I want this to sound loud and clear many times we say why am I battling the devil said well the reason you're battling is your serpent seed oh the preacher pray for the preacher he's the only one having this wait waiting on us to come to Perfection brother you pray for us no we all go through that the devil come and say the reason you're not blessed is your serpent seed but according to this these weren't serpent seed that's right but he led the predestinated because they had some maturing to do before they took the land that's right remember the Bible said don't give your inheritance to a fool he'll squander it and then all your life's labors will just go down the drain so God didn't want that God wanted to train them before he gave them their inheritance amen it's just the same for us but notice now the Lord the pillar of fire is leading through rough paths bitter Waters and deserts and Howling Wilderness sometimes God will do it and we're all right in our own minds but God knows what we need he knows what our mothers need what our daddies need what our young people need what our church needs God knows how to make real gold out of us hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's right put your hat upen quit being in the Molly grubs stand like a son and a daughter of God hallelujah sing like a daughter of God hallelujah possess yourself like a child of God hallelujah he said I will make a way in the wilderness that's right I when they needed bread God gave them bread when they needed water God gave them water Hallelujah and they needed rest God gave them rest the holy spirit will put the devil out yes sir the devil isn't dealing with flesh and blood only if we allow it that's right but if we stay under the anointing of the pillar of fire he's dealing with God Amen he'll Bluff and snort and cry he'll stand there like Goliath but every giant will fall every sea will move every mountain will crumble hallu how many believe that amen right that was what Joshua did Joshua had passed through the Jordan God opened it just like the Red Sea but Jo Joshua didn't run just Reckless into Jericho brother brandham said he was pacing saying Lord how do I take Jericho and he met the captain of The Lord of hosts did you ever catch what brother brandham said he said the pillar of fire that led them through the Wilderness for 40 years the pillar of fire became a man there you are he said he became incarnate in a man a prefigure of Jesus Christ he said are you with us or on the Lord's Side he said I'm the one that's been leading you the whole time God becoming flesh leading us to God in flesh Hallelujah speak and go forward amen hallelujah God will make the way clear sir I'm preaching myself I feel myself preaching to myself this morning amen when the church stops marching it starts wondering that's right what am I doing here wondering and wondering yeah what am I doing here has God left me am I an orphan why does everything go right for brother Paul I always get the short end of the stick oh we all what what's brother juel say wowy wowy woo I heard that for a long time hav't many heard that before brother juel Wy Wy wo brother Bram said when Pentecost stopped marching they organized that's right the Holy Spirit teaches us Satan in the framework of the church and when we stop we become formal and when we stop we organize to keep ourselves right on the outside but are we right on the inside that's it in order to be right on the inside we must follow the leading of the Lord day by day we must pray through every day amen amen hallelujah yes you don't have to turn there you'll remember in Ezekiel chapter 1 you'll find that Ezekiel is caught up in the spirit and he sees a fire a cloud infolding itself everybody with me and he said it was the color of amber or the midst of fire and he said out of the midst come four living creatures amen we know about the four living creatures and he said every one of them a face of a man a face of an ox a face of an eagle a face of a lion and he said there was four on each side so brother brandom said whatever direction that they went they always went forward brother brandom said this was a type of the Ark of the Covenant he said as it was on the earth it was rolling on wheels how many remember the wheel in the middle of the wheel the four Beast was rolling on Wheels he said it was the ark in its Journey he said it was rolling on its Earthly journey and then when John saw it it was stationary but what I want to show you is that the ark is never stationary The Mercy Seat traveled with the church and the church is not going backward the church is not stationary the church moves with the spirit of God every individual moves with the spirit of God as many are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God the nature of the Beast could not go backward they could only go in One Direction you are anointed to go in a forward momentum your prayer life must go forward your church services must go forward forward we're anointed to go forward sir the church responds to the anointing amen hallelujah that's how in the Dark Ages that they were not overcome by the devil and and the military arm of Rome she went forward anyhow amen and when the church broke into Babylon in this day how do we survive not our own wisdom it is an an anointing of an eagle anointing that allows us to go forward when everything else is falling away hallu advance means to go forward to the objective sir do we have a vision do you have a vision for your home do you have a vision as an individual of what you are reaching for what you are contending for amen amen that's right we all must have a vision you will perish yes sir The Church Must Have A Vision amen forward means to proceed Amen to move forward in a purposeful way yes sir that's right do you have purpose in your life how how many thank God that he has taken you to where you are now amen amen amen how many of you seen Fall Away how many of you seen just but you're standing against the grace of almighty God God give us purpose yes sir as mothers give us purpose for our children and for the future of our household amen men Brethren husbands let us have purpose yes sir of life and vision what do I want for my household that's it amen amen now forward think of forward so Ezekiel Saw the Ark of the Covenant moving and when he saw it it went from the Tabernacle to the temple to God in flesh amen amen it was advancing all the time it went from Badger skins to Solomon's Temple then to the greatest Glory Jesus Christ amen I want you to think of this the law foreshadowed the New Testament and and Christ is our Perfection and if you think of the victories of the Old Testament the Bible said now he has blessed us with a more excellent Ministry and that he has based a better Covenant with better promises this is a better Covenant we ought to be more Victorious than they were of the old because we are coming to higher places if they had Divine Healing in the old we certainly have Divine Healing now amen amen because we're advancing amen every Ministry ought to be advancing amen remember Nathaniel uh Philip come said come and see Nathaniel Nathaniel steps into the presence and I I doubt there was just two people I'm sure there were throngs of people somehow some way Jesus recognizes him he recognizes he's recognized and the spirit of the Lord said behold an Israelite whom there is no G amen it must have shocked him Master how did you how did you ever know me Hallelujah before philli called thee Hallelujah when you're under the tree I saw thee Pastor hallelujah hallelujah the king of Israel and Jesus said you believe because I told you I saw you under the tree you will see greater things than this you'll see a greater Ministry God has taking you to a higher realm of faith you'll see Angels ascending and descending upon the son of man because God always moves forward we're not just moving but we're moving forward to an objective and to a goal that's right amen otherwise we're wandering that's it in the wilderness the spirit of the Lord Moved Through the Ages because the church is not stationary and every message opens up a new message that's right not an old one amen John the Baptist was a man man sent from God the Bible said I love the way brother brandham took that he said John had no Fellowship right because he was a man sent from God he said he had no backing or no cooperation because he was a man sent from God there was no politics in John because he was a man sent from God brother brandom said he called it what it was because he was a man sent from God brother brandom called it what it was because he was a man sent from God organization is Antichrist thank the Lord he has told us that he was a man sent from God now brother brandham said John was bringing something new the dispensation was closing and John was bringing forth a new dispensation and he was preparing the way of the Lord so John's daddy was a priest but he did not follow the old order of the priesthood because he was a man sent from God and something new was coming forth that did not even resemble right amen that's right the old order amen praise the Lord amen Jesus Christ came forth which was the fullness of the word bodily that's it that's right and God had called John to introduce him the word and brother bham said those blinded Pharisees could not see the word made manifest because they were wrapped up in their priesthood that's it listen to this he said the old system had to give way it was the word that had been promised he said now like the seed that goes in the ground the seed must rot I want you to catch the spirit of what I'm saying the seed must rot and out of the rotten mess 400 years without a prophet listen closely out of that rotten religious mess came forth the word made flesh you wonder why we have such problems don't let it discourage you it the word seed must rot in order for life to come forth and we're in Wicked age like Jesus had but the word made flashh is coming forth amen four 400 years without a message John's father was a part of the old order Jesus was of the New Order he was bringing forth the new Faith yes sir hallelujah amen the old system was done at the crucifixion the old lamb was done the feast days were done the old orders were done God was bringing forth life and a new covenant Amen brother brandham said now he said that Jesus came he was the new and the living way not the old way of the law but Grace how many appreciate Grace he said now the old seed before the new seed can come out it must rot not just but it must rot and the same thing is in birth we'll never go forward when you're born again he said notice the person they don't want to rot from the old system right that's it they don't want to come out of it they want to stay in the old and claim the new birth or the message of the age amen if you want the Holy Ghost it's very simple yes sir you must die to the old order of the old man and be born again completely you cannot hold to both when you pull the world into the church it's a perversion God will not bless it and neither will God bring denominationalism into the message the old order must die in order for the life of God to come out of it the bride's Revival to come out of it he said you cannot cling to the old system you must come out of it that's why John said I saw a new heavens and a new Earth because the old has passed away how many say Lord let me die to my thinking die to my former years let me die to the system to be born of God's system two orders cannot exist at the same time and there must become a transformation from old to new If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are made new you don't bring your denomination into the message no sir that's right that's why Paul said Brethren I count myself to apprehended this one thing forgetting those things that are behind me I reach forward to the mark of the high calling in Christ many of people are trying to manufacture yesterday or hold on to yesterday you can't do it you must follow the pillar of fire good Wonder brother brandham said the churches they say this is it and they walk in the glare of yesterday he said now a man when he's driving down the road if he looks through his real ve mirror he'll get wrecked you're to look forward to where you're going and that applies to us we're not looking back to 1965 we're building upon 1965 that's right that's right and if we look back and try to hallow yesterday we become Idol worshippers and we miss what the spirit is doing with the word right now the word is a brother Brandon went away but the word is still here the spirit is still here Christ is still here and he's lifting us into a higher Place Hallelujah that's right amen hallelujah and he said now he said watch this he said looking not looking back but pressing forward he said this in Shalom we're not placing the message as looking back backwards that's what he said he said we're looking forward he said now many times he said women are lean this way nothing wrong with it we know the makeup of a woman he said they'll try to stay a teenager yeah no matter how hard you try just a matter of time we're all old we're all getting older just some are ahead of the others but we're all going to the same place amen and brother brandom said you'll see it and it's okay it's the nature of a woman to be pretty that's fine pretty's fine but you can't hold to yesterday that's delusional that's right you must walk in what God gives you Amen brother bam said if you lose your teeth if they make your teeth get you some if they make you some right thank the Lord amen helps us cope that's right don't be looking back look to the new body body amen your faith will take you to your new body let me tell you this is a pest house anyway brother bam said do not be satisfied where you are that's right am that's it bless God I've been a message believer since I was 23 years old amen how far have you come that's it that's right that's it because as long as the scripture remains be perfect as my Father in Heaven is perfect we're still reaching that's right that's right well at least the preachers are pray for the preachers Paul said I'm pressing forward that's right Paul Paul was caught up to the third heaven Paul was used that seldom any men were used in the way of Paul and Paul said forgetting the the mistakes of the past pressing forward to the mark of the high calling if if Paul had to press forward then we got to press forward when brother brandham had went beyond the curtain of time the voice said keep pressing if you only knew keep pressing if he was close to the Finish Line we're getting vitally close yes sir yes sir Hallelujah brother bam said you never put a period on your Revelation that's right good bless God we know it all let me tell you God gave us a revelation brother brandom said it was culminating in the desert so quickly I couldn't keep up with it and I'll assure you after all of these years of studying giving myself to the word of God I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface it's not it's coming to the revelation of what God is doing in our lives that's it amen it ain't a bunch of head knowledge right it's a life brother Bram said we have powers unlimited how many believe that I believe that the church could get together and start praying for a 12year old boy and God Chang the circumstance from a life FL to being on his feet and playing with the kids by evening time God can defeat every sickness that is in this church and we have untapped resources that's right hallelujah amen he is God this is not a man message it's a god message Hallelujah let us be man sent from God believe everything God showed you and cry out Lord show me more that's it how many are hungry for more I want to see you Lord I want to see what your love is I want to see what the cross really means let me see the depth the width the breadth that's right said we can't even comprehend the love of God brother bham said we're living in the last days we're living in the time where God's Great beautiful Church ought to be standing on its feet shining like the lily of the valley he said we're back here we're back here as a Methodist back here as a presbyterian Pentecostal that's right amen he said oh what a disgrace that's right we should be unfolding God's spirit pouring out not a little gusher not one baptism but baptism after baptism the just shall live by faith sanctification or gifts of the Spirit he said but revelation after Revelation power after power glory after Glory we ought to be way up the road ready for the translation yes he said we're lingering way back in the old things let's go forward every place you put the souls of your feet shall be your possession brother brandom said now let's move from glory to glory from Bible experience to Bible experience let's unfold open our hearts raise up our hands keep saying keep in the Bible praise the Lorden you know brother brandham said there is no end to the tree of Faith that's it amen how many like climbing trees if we could go back to when we were 10 years old we all like to climb trees girl or boy but this tree of faith we ought to be climbing into the all things are possible in Christ untapped resources of God amen amen let's look at that scripture again 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verse1 17 and 18 this is our opening scripture every everybody okay I don't know what time it is that's all right you thank you thank you I appreciate it 2 Corinthians chapter 3:1 17 now the spirit of the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with an open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed listen to this into the same image from glory to Glory Hallelujah even as by the spirit of the Lord now that word changed into is the same word transfigured yes it is transformed is to be changed amen not to be patched up but to be made new so when our faith goes from glory to glory and our faith is trans formed it's literally changing into something and it's coming closer to the glory and the image of the Lord which is the word but it takes the power of God to transform us and make us something different God will transform our nature our attitude our views our perspective our ambition God will change our thinking amen let the mind that was in Christ be in new he'll change our nature our makeup he'll make us a new creature and he won't change us once when we're baptized but he'll change us from glory to glory to glory when you came to the Lord your change only began you ought to be changing every day brought into the perfect will of God that's right right brother brandom said transformation is to change from one thing to another he said like a tadpole being changed into a different creature he said now God sends his transforming power for one reason to fulfill his own word that's it if we didn't have a change we would never fulfill God's word I want you to think of this the word is creative every word of God Is Creative God said let there be amen and I want you to see Abraham and Sarah now Abraham could believe God but he needed a change in order to bring forth the promise of God Sarah could believe God but no matter how much they believe God had to change them to bring the promise to pass do you know that Sarah was a type of us yes sir old Sarah sir dried up womb years couldn't have a baby every day goes by how you feeling honey huh yeah feeling any better what say feeling any better nah praise God we're going to have it anyhow and tomorrow's worse and she's getting feebler and Abraham how you feeling ah never mind this body is going to bring forth the nation of Israel amen this body I'm not I'm not making fun of elderly this is the church the womb is Barren right the milk veins are dried up there is no possible way that Mary that Sarah can bring forth the promise amen one morning they got up the Sun was shining that's it it's early looks over Abraham's looking she goes what are you looking at what happened to you what honey you're you're beautiful Am I Dreaming pinch me ow that's right honey your hair is dark again amen you don't whistle through your missing to the tooth came back amen Sarah Abraham amen one morning was different yes sir yes sir that's I know we come into church hear sermons and we go home but you are Sarah that's it and you're not holding Dr Seuss or Chicken Soup for the Soul this is the creative word of God that is in your heart and there is a change that changed you from the world to the present but what I'm trying to express is the change does not stop it keeps going and it keeps going and you ought to climb higher and higher in Christ that's right hallah exactly right and God brings the change to bring his word to pass that's it right there that's it praise the Lord exactly right it's just like I'm not what I used to be I'm not what I want to be that's right I ain't what I used to be that was what he was saying now Amen brother brandham said God keeps revealing himself to you and you're growing in Grace to Grace from power to power from glory to to Glory that's right so we're only as strong is our Revelation and adherence to the word of God that's it that's right and so God's revelation to you as an individual ought to be daily that's right right that's why when we read the Bible we should read it with Earnest Lord what will you show me today am don't let that you stay with your devotions that's right you read your Bible take time amen nothing's more important take time to have your time with God Amen young people say God reveal yourself to me amen what does this message mean what does Malachi 4 mean what does revelation 10 mean to me Hallelujah brother ROM said the sun changes the seed from glory to glory so it don't stay a seed and become a reproduction it goes through stages and sometimes it don't even look like the seed but it will end up there you are am I wearing you are you getting tired brother brandham said now the corn of wheat that falls in the ground Must Die amen and he said the church comes from Luther and Wesley and it comes back to the original glory and back to the glory that was at the beginning back to the original seed whom God God has Justified he hath already glorified he is bringing us back he said we have been looking through the glass Darkly but soon it will be face to face we have been going glory to glory but soon it will be right in glory we are complete in him and God who has brought you out of the world you feel the call let me encourage you answer the call if there is a pull in your heart say yes and take one step let no nothing hinder you and watch God meet you there amen I don't care where you've been how backing you are have faith in God lord and then it will take you on until you're standing in a glorified body that's right praise the Lord Brother bam said just like Enoch he kept walking I was preaching on that Wednesday he kept rising in the power of the Rapture amen right I say Lord let me get to Higher Ground leave the Earthbound senses that's right quit reasoning let your mind be dominated by the word of God I know I know what I speak of there was a day when tapes were playing tapes were playing we got away from that we focus on other ministers but there is no voice in the the land that is more important to hear than the voice of Malachi 4 the pure word of God saying come up hither amen that's right that's right it washes us it is a creative power that's why brother Brandon speak and there were squirrels because they were showing the creative power in the word of God that's right Vindicated by God himself my brother bom said now God has revealed more to me and he keeps bringing it on he never takes away what has been he just keeps adding on that's why his ministry went first pole second pole third pole and notice the messages the pyramid is a growing message everything is moving to the Capstone the Masterpiece was a growing message the wheat plant the bride tree the church ages the Roman Candle everything is a continual work exactly right never stationary amen and brother bandam said if I could live in any age it would be this one right now this is a hard age but we have been given a word that'll take us above it they've never been given anything like this we are a blessed people but we're living in an age hear me I won't hold you long hear me we're living in an age that says I have need of that's the battle but brother bandam said you should never be satisfied that's right with where you are that's right Paul was Reaching Forward the apostles was Reaching Forward that's good and right now we're battling complacency that's right especially when you I got the baptis got the godhead yeah predes yeah serp got that but it's so much more than that you're revelation will change your life not your mind it'll change your life that's it that's right that's right holy spirit wants to take us higher I'm going to bring us to a close but you can go no higher than what you believe that's right that's right that's right how many want to go higher yes sir yes sir God said my ways are higher than your ways amen so that means that our believing got to go higher that you got to bust the Caps off amen you got to take the roof off you need shoulder room we want to come to a higher realm of Faith amen Lord bring me to a faith I've never been before take away my limitations take away my unbelief and My reasonings let me go deeper into a Deeper Life how many want a deeper prayer life a deep de ER devotion a higher Faith Lord let me have a greater testimony that means I need a greater Revelation that's because you can only go as high as you believe and so we need the spirit to take us higher brother brandham said this when he saw the third pole he the Angels teaching him how to fish and then he said I went higher in the vision that's right amen and he saw the tent and it was dealing with the ministry the third poll and every one of you have a Ministry yes sir it ain't just the preacher every one of us in the body of Christ has an anointed Ministry and every one of us need to come higher in our ministry I want to come higher that's my passion Lord use me this year like never before anoint me are you a musician are you a Sunday school teacher are you audio or what are you Deacon God lift me in my Ministry are you a ministering Spirit sent from the presence of God to encourage the body right amen how many say Lord take my Ministry higher popularity does not vindicate that God's blessing vindicates that amen Amen brother Brandon was losing popularity but God was blessing it Greater as the word came Hallelujah that's right that's right that's right Hallelujah just a can I have just a few more minutes maybe 15 I should never try to prophesy you got think I'm a false prophet you know brother brandom made the statement he took Natural Science and he said Natural Science is a forerunner of God's spiritual achievement so he took Martin Luther and he said Luther had pulled the church out of the Dark Ages by divine revelation that just shall live by faith and it was enough to crush the system in the day and to overcome the powers of church and state and bring them into the light of the Gospel the beginning of the restoration now brother brandham said that science forerun the true achievement of God so he said first he said was Luther the horse and buggy and I went into a study and I was looking and I don't know if it was uh chariots or not chariots but uh what kind of buggy that it was but it says that they trace it back to the 1400s and turkey I think it was and brother bams in the 1500s Here Comes Luther it was a power it was a greater horse horsepower and he said then the automobile and I looked up in the history and it said first was the steam power automobile in the 1600s then there was a combustion chamber made in the S I think it was the 1700s and then Wesley came forth go back and look you'll find it and he said the natural was showing the progression of what God was trying to achieve he said then God brought forth tongues and restoration of gifts he said God was taking them off the earth and the plane was made I think it was for flown for like 30 seconds so 1903 and 1906 God brought the gifts back into the church he said it was just adding more power and then brother brandham said in 1962 John Glenn went to the moon exactly 1963 God opened the word and the power of God fell upon the church and he said they'll never go any higher amen because God is opening a channel for us to have a body change amen do you believe that and brother Brenham said right now God just keeps adding power adding power Revelation gives you authority over the devil amen hallelujah and he said now we are in the astronaut age now we're in the eagle age we're not Earthly we're Heavenly and we're waiting on the countdown God is taking us into the heavenlies that's right that ought to make you shout that's right for the rapturing grace that's right right remember Revelations chapter 1 2 and 3 chapter 4 he heard a voice the same voice that turned him around was the same voice that said John come up high that's right right God is calling us a high he said John saw what Paul saw when he was caught to the third heaven he said but Paul couldn't speak of it he said but John wrote it and sent it to the church that ought to make you shout there is no Summit to God's power in our lives I don't care if you're a widow Hallelujah I don't care if nobody recognizes you you there is no Summit to what God can do in your life how many say Lord add power to my life that power comes by Revelation amen that'll take you from glory to glory to glory you know you have a right to claim your kids you know you have a right to cast Devils out Hallelujah there's an authority and a power behind Revelation and it's not just the preacher it's them that believe these signs shall follow them that believe where are we going we're advancing from glory to glory until we change our bodies and become one with the word how many want to become one with the word me too the next great SE season is the Millennium amen we'll build houses we'll eat the fruits of our labor we will live there the ox and the lamb Lion and the lamb that lay down together yes sir how many are going to be there one of these days we'll be walking in eternity or in the Millennium we'll be walking and we will look and we will see the lion laying down by the lamb and we'll nudge each other and say this is what we fought for thank you Jesus amen hallelujah how many looking forward to that day this message is taking us there because the pillar of fire accompanies the message always and we are not complete we are not stationary until we go to Glory remember brother bandam said when John saw the ark it was stationary amen that's what he said he said because they went through the church ages and he said then John saw it stationary brother Braham said in the name of the Lord that God who came out in the old days as the musicians will come and led the Church of God out of Egypt out of bondage into Freedom has come down again in the same manner to lead his church spiritual out of bondage of sin first by the Holy Spirit sickness next and the third step is to go into glory and to take this Mortal and make it immortality and to the Transfiguration of our human bod to transform them into the perfect image of the Son of God amen amen this is what happens next amen this word that beats in your heart amen you will have a change like Sarah and it might be just a Sunday like this right I got troubles financial troubles got marital troubles got kid troubles grandchildren troubles it might be a day just like this one day was different because God said so amen I feel a change amen I feel like my faith is unlimited amen dear God I feel like I'm in a [Music] vision God will begin to take us to a glorified body and God has called us to do it Amen brother Bram said God will do nothing but he uses Believers to fulfill his word how many believe you need to create that atmosphere around you I am a believer I believe this message the change has already began that's exactly don't stagnate don't sit still let God take you higher how many want to go higher that's right as a minister of the Gospel when I came out of the world I'm like thank you Lord thank you this is so real I have never lost my passion that's it I want to go all the way right I don't want to sit still that's it in memories of yesterday I want to see God in my life today right amen can we stand our feet and before we're dismissed I just I just want to before we close the service rather just want to say this is an opportunity is the Angel of the Lord accompanies the message always and we're Believers amen that's we believe in angels that's right we believe in prophets we believe Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and we believe that if we don't believe it the rocks are able somebody will take our place I don't want to be removed that's right I want to believe with all my heart and if you have never given your heart to the Lord I don't know you why don't this be the day Lord I'm going to give my life to you talk to your pastor and be baptized in Christian baptism if you've been dead or stagnant or backslid not on the outside but on the inside why don't you say Lord I'm tired of this defeated attitude I'm going out of here a new person because you promised me Lord you would give me joy of my salvation I'm not going to be hindered by the problems of the past I am forgetting them now I'm divorcing my excuses of yesterday and I know as I feel the pole I know that the Lord has something good ahead for me how many say Lord I'm forgetting yesterday I want to be like Paul I want to forget of the hurts and all the disappointments I will not con
