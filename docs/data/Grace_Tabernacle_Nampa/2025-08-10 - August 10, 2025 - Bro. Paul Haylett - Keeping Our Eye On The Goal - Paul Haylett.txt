[Music] We know that these prayer requests aren't by chance. You brought them before this assembly because you have confidence in your word. and that word living your little bride Lord in action. We're here to bring these before your throne and not as a hope but as faith believing we receive what we ask for. You know those that are traveling. You know about this upcoming camp. You know about the family of our sister Dorothy. She lived a wonderful life before you. She certainly witnessed and manifested your grace and faith in your promise.

Lord, if there's any here not prepared, may this morning, may their answer be yes, Lord. Yes to your way. You have a way. We must come your way. It's your achievement. It's your grace.

And I say, press on, little lily. Press on. The sun is up. May you ministered now to every need as we expect you to do so and we're expecting to receive from you this morning.

We give you praise now in the name of Jesus Christ. May every one of these needs according to your will and desire be ministered. Bless our brother Paul, Lord, as he's prepared what you've given to him. May he speak out and may he speak things that Paul doesn't even know or none of us, Lord, but feed our soul. It's not the man that glories in your presence. It's your predestinated seed. That's the mystery that has been unveiled, Lord. We were with you from before the foundation of the world. Your very thoughts expressed in the word that we're about to receive and feed upon this morning. We call upon you for revelation that we may honor and glorify and please you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and we give thanks to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. God bless you once again.

He invited us into his chamber &gt;&gt; and his holy spirit has come, &gt;&gt; is speaking to us. We're not waiting for him to speak, but he's speaking even now. Just from the depths of your heart, say thank you to the Lord. Heavenly Father, we just thank you today. Grace and mercy so abundantly poured out upon us, Lord, and opened our eyes to your word. Father, you've poured your life into us. And Father, we come this morning just saying thank you. Thank you, Lord. Oh, what our lives would be without you, Father. Oh, we say thank you for your presence that you came, Father. You've met us in that secret place. You've touched us, poured your Holy Spirit into us, Lord. You strengthen us in an age, Lord, where the onslaught of Satan is so strong, but yet you come. You strengthen us, Lord. Not only in our flesh, in our mind, in our spirit. Father, oh Lord, we thank you. We lift our hands in thanksgiving today. Lord, we bless your holy name this morning. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Amen. Good to be here this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know if I miss greeting someone. Please forgive me. Um it's just so good to see each and every one of you. Brother Daniel, been praying for you, my friend. Amen. and we see our um brother Melo. God bless you. It's &gt;&gt; been a little bit, but we're happy to see you and your lovely family. And uh just uh uh Oleg, Brother Oleg, Sister Elena, and I don't have a clue to remember the kids' names, but Amen. Just uh ask the Lord just to uh touch you. I look in the back row and I see my my dear dear friend, Brother Manassa and Sister Katie. God bless you. Glad to see you here today, Ethan. Each and every one of you. Just God bless you. And we're so thankful for God's grace. Oh, I've looked right over Sister Alice. You know, she's right at that age. She could be my sister. And uh I I kind of claim her that way. just a special bond that's there. God bless you, Sister Alice, Sister April. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is it good to be in the house of the Lord today? &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh just want to remember in a couple weeks we'll start Sunday school. Uh time flies so quickly and it's uh catches us offguard. And also we want to definitely remember the dean hearts as they travel uh to to Arizona. Brother David mentioned that. Um, our sister Dorothy, a very special special sister, a lovely lady. Amen. Such a sweet spirit. All the all the years that I have known her, uh, she just always had such an open, welcoming spirit. Uh, she she would often times, hope this isn't too much for some of you, but she would wrap her arm around me and just tell me that she loved me like a son. And, you know, &gt;&gt; just touches your heart. And uh we thank the Lord to have that kind of a a body of believers, that kind of a family to be associated with. Amen. And uh so um as far as this coming weekend here at the church, we have a couple details to work out. Um and um we'll we'll post it on the WhatsApp uh exactly what will be happening. My original plan was to to go camping. Uh but uh my original plan also was that brother David, whether he knew it or not, was going to cover the services here at the church. So we'll figure something out. And u and uh no, no, the Lord knows. He's the one that sets it all in motion. And uh so we we just uh want the Lord's will to be done. Amen. I'd like to speak to you uh on on uh Thank you. Uh, I sure appreciated the song service, the musicians this morning. It was beautiful. Amen. Uh, I want to speak to you this morning on expectations, but um the real title will be keeping our eye on the goal. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And uh so our expectations often times lead us down the road. They cause us to make decisions. We look into the future. But many a person in their life has started out. Now you can look this up and I don't mean to depress anyone here this morning. It's just a fact of life that when they take the goals of an 18y old and 40 years goes by. They're now 58 years old. The percentage of those who actually fulfilled their plan for their life is minuscule. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Most people end up totally derailed from what they thought they would be &gt;&gt; and where they would be when they were 18. &gt;&gt; And that is just the nature we might say of life. It's not an individual failure. It's not an issue with that person. It is life. There's all kinds of things we don't even know tomorrow. We we don't even know this afternoon for certain. And and uh so we see these things and how that life changes. And uh some of those will be bad decisions. Some of those will be good decisions that we never ever considered because we don't have a crystal ball. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we have the word. And so when we commit everything to the word &gt;&gt; and let the word come. I I love the song service this morning. It fit to me. It fit so perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we commit it to the word, we will find that our plan, our footsteps, everything will be perfect. &gt;&gt; Now our idea of perfect &gt;&gt; and God's idea of perfect &gt;&gt; two different ideas. That's why the apostle Paul told us we must find the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Because if we go in our mind, we will say this is what is best for me. &gt;&gt; And we're looking at it in very short term. We're looking at it emotionally. We're looking at it. We think good because we're looking at it analytically. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you see, analytics and life don't always go together. And uh so as we look at this, I just want to speak to you this morning on keeping our eye on the goal. And you notice I didn't say keeping your eye on the goal because this includes every one of us. Amen. It's not just a preacher preaching to you, but it's every one of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We must keep our eye on the goal. Turn in your Bibles if you would this morning. Once again, I say it's so good to be here in the house of God to see each and every one of you. and um Romans the 8th chapter 14-19. Now my whole thought that I had I struggled this morning uh to not just read uh uh Romans 7 and Romans 8 and Romans 9, but that's a little bit too much scripture just to read in one time. So I narrowed it down. Just had to give some thought to it and felt led of the Lord just to narrow it down to these verses. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it takes a son of God, son and daughter of God to even hear the voice. &gt;&gt; That's right. Exactly. &gt;&gt; You see, if if God's not in you, you you you don't even hear the voice. It's it's just it's just something out there that you just say, "I don't I don't get it. Why are they like they are?" But when you are a son or daughter of God, &gt;&gt; that voice says, "Stop, you stop." &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; It says, "Turn right, you turn right. Turn left, you turn left. Pray, you pray." &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it. &gt;&gt; And so there's where it is the leadership. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For you have not received the spirit of bondage. Again, means that we've been delivered once. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; To fear. But you have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, "Aba, father, my father, my father." The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. And if children, then heirs. Who's an heir of God today? Amen. We are we are Bible believing, Bible reading, Holy Spirit-led people. Amen. And that means we are heirs. We are not here just blindly walking. God didn't say, "I want you to walk your whole days of your life and I'm going to get up there." And this has a little bit of a story that goes with it. Maybe I'll share it in a minute. But you look at this, my brother and sister. God's not bringing us to a place to say you failed. &gt;&gt; No, that's right. &gt;&gt; This is not about bringing us &gt;&gt; to a point to say failure. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is a point to bring us to say well done. &gt;&gt; That's it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're joint hes with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time, actually 18 and 19 are my focus scriptures here. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to even be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And creature here is creation. &gt;&gt; That's right. waitth the manifestation of the sons of God. Heavenly Father, we ask for your blessings upon the word. Bless the saints, I pray today in your name. Amen. You may be seated. Now, as we look at this, my brother and sister, we'll see here in the scripture that to be an heir is not just uh not maybe always what we think it is. You say, "Well, I I um I I I I'm I've got a rich father, natural, rich mother, natural. uh you know they give me everything I want. If not careful, what you'll end up with is a lot of things you didn't want. And so it's there that always having that kind of an inheritance is not really a blessing. Amen. There's many a rich child turned into I knew a couple in my youth. One of them killed himself in a his daddy bought him a Corvette for a 16th birthday. And uh he lasted one week in that car and killed himself. And uh so you see that was not a blessing to be 16 years old and your dad buys you a brand new Corvette. So it was there that that that was actually a tremendous mistake. Uh every every child probably should start off with something that has a speed limiter. Uh but uh even then it don't make you a tentative. And so as it is you look at these things but we are here and the word of God is telling us that we are the children of God. And if we're children, we are heirs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It isn't conditional. Right now, we understand what this scripture says, but we're talking in this positive context that if we are children, if we've come to the place our identity is in Jesus Christ, then we are heirs. And I say we ought to act like heirs. Amen. We ought to act like our father owns the cattle on a thousand hills. In fact, he owns the hills and much more. And it's there that it's time for us to not have this uh you know kind of a downtrodden mentality of our approach to serving God. Now that doesn't make that you rich naturally. I hope you understand that God God didn't say that being spiritually rich equals uh uh yeah spiritually rich equals naturally rich. Amen. That's one thing that the world is pedalling that if God loves you, you'll be rich. Well, I'll tell you what about the people in the middle of these other continents or even maybe here in the United States that are not rich, but they are spiritually rich. Now, who do we want to have an inheritance with? &gt;&gt; Amen. The rich man who goes to hell, Amen. and begs for his finger to be dipped in the water to come and quench his thirst. Or the one who's laying in the very bosom of Abraham. Amen. And it all depends on which side of this inheritance you want to be in the reading &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; of the will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you love just going to things like the reading of the will? I go, Lord willing, twice a week for the reading of the will. Amen. And I get to sit there and hear what my father has given me. Amen. And when I hear what he's given me, Amen. It's up to me now to decide what I will do with what he has given me. &gt;&gt; And so as we look at this the sufferings of this present time, anybody here suffering? Amen. Let's face the reality of it in the natural and things of life. There are burdens that you bear. There are things as ministers sometimes you don't sleep at night because your heart is so burdened for those around you that that all you can think about all night long is Lord help them Lord touch them Lord lift them up. And you see my brother and sister those prayers don't go unheard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Those prayers come before the throne. I know many of you, the prayer warriors in our midst, you deal with the same things that your heart is burdened and you are reaching out because we are not here just for our own accord to to go and breathe as it were through this life and move on. But Lord, help us to touch those around us. Amen. And you know the the whole thing of the suffering of this present time, it sometimes is mental or emotional. It can be physical. There a lot of aspects about this. It might be spiritually. You might be down in the valley, my brother and sister, but you'll never appreciate the mountaintop till you have dwelt in the valley. And when you dwell in the valley long enough and find deliverance on the mountaintop, you don't look down at those in the valley and say, "Oh, those poor sods." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You look down there and say, "Lord, you delivered me. Lord, you helped me. Lord, you come in the power of your word, your Holy Spirit, and delivered me. And it causes you to have an overwhelming sense of compassion for that individual. Amen. It doesn't matter if I'm an old man and I'm looking at teenagers. Amen. I was a teenager once that lost my way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have compassion. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; I've been the middle-aged man that was lost in my way. And God had compassion upon me. And I look and I see compassion to people. I have compassion to people. And here in my older days, Amen. I start to to deal with things in a different fashion, you might say. And we don't want to get too far off on that. But you you deal with things in a different way. And the scripture speaks of the groaning of the spirit. Amen. And we'll find ourselves as we become mature in Jesus Christ, we do a lot of groaning in our spirit. Amen. We're we're often times find oursel we're perfectly healthy. We're well fed. We're well-dressed. Everything's good around us. Our environment, you might say, is good, but we find ourselves groaning. &gt;&gt; Our brother David preached, brother David Nash preached this last Wednesday. My brother and sister, it was wonderful. you get opportunity, go listen to it because he was talking about atmosphere, my brother and sister. And you get in the right atmosphere, you will find yourself groaning for those around you. When you don't have that atmosphere, you'll say, "Well, too bad for them." But in the right atmosphere, you look at every single individual that your life touches and say, "Lord, I wish, I pray, I long for you to come and touch their life." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you look at this uh the earnest expectation of the creature we know and understand of the scripture that is creation. And realize my brother and sister that creation itself is groaning as the word said it would be in this hour. It is groaning because believe it or not creation knows what it was like before the fall. &gt;&gt; We say does it have a voice? Does it have comprehension? Does it have understanding? Tell me why the tree takes a sap to the root. &gt;&gt; There's an understanding there that we as humans do not understand, cannot explain. And all nature, all creation is groaning to go back to the beginning just as you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the word is coming in such a fashion, my brother and sister. Who would have thought that an earthquake in uh Russia would cause uh uh volcanoes to start bubbling up? Hundreds and hundreds of years since there was any activity there. But the earth itself is breaking apart and groaning for a deliverance. I want delivered also. I want a purifying fire to come over me also. I want the word to be manifested in me also. I want the very life that's in the scripture to come out of me also. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Because you see, even creation has expectation of a new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Heavens and earth shall pass away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But my brother and sister, this earth once it has been cleansed. Now, I just I have it here not to get lost in trying to look up the references, but uh if you haven't read uh Daniel, 70 weeks of Daniel in the last while, I encourage you to pick it up and read it because it's incredible because you see the earth, my brother and sister, is going to be prepared for a bride and her husband for the millennial reign. Amen. And when the earth is prepared for that, the bride is going to walk out on the ashes, my brother and sister, of purification. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be we're saying, "I'm walking on the wicked. Oh, I'm not the wicked." It No, no, we're going to look at this and understand how it was that when the sacrifice was offered and when it was done, they didn't take the ashes of the burnt sacrifice and toss it to the wind. My brother and sister, God even gave them an ordinance on how to deal with the ashes of the sacrifice. And when we walk out on this new earth, amen, after its cleansing, amen, we'll be walking out, and you can say it's symbolic. Go ahead, take it symbolic. But you're going to be walking out in a pure world. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you're going to walk out there with a pure word in you, in a pure world, in the presence of a pure and holy God. Amen. I'm telling you, it's not just some little symbolism story, but it's the whole plan of redemption coming forth that God is bringing this out and it will touch every corner aspect of our lives. Let's receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's receive it. Lord, purify me today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; As we look in Isaiah 65 and17 to start down through those verses. For behold, I create a new heavens and a new earth, and the former shall not be remembered nor come to mind. Isn't that nice? &gt;&gt; Amen. that a lot of things that we struggle with in our own memories today, little issues that we had at one time, little besetting sins that we still have to physically and spiritually guard oursel every day. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You say, "But but we're we're we're filled with the Holy Ghost. We're we're we're Christians." No, my brother and sisters, sometimes the very protection that God has given us is like a soldier going to the armory and he has to reach over there and he has to take that shield. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He can't just walk out on the battlefield and say, "Praise God, I've got a shield back there." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God expected him to walk in there, take that shield. Amen. Put on the whole armor. Amen. and grab his sword or his spear to defend himself. Amen. And it was expected that a soldier wouldn't go to the battlefield and say, "Um, can I borrow your shield?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um, I'm out here and I know I know some of you wear these, so I don't mean to be insulting, but anybody who goes to the battle in flipflops deserves a stub toe. See, God wants us to be shaw in the gospel. &gt;&gt; Preparation. Yes. Everything has been given. And if we go out without it, that's our fault. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't blame God for failure in your life if you will not prepare yourself to go to battle. &gt;&gt; And so, as we'll see that God is preparing us to be able to stand in this hour by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're not going to come to church with a, you know, big massive boots and uh a leg and shield and chest deal, all this stuff and and go clunking. Imagine what church would be like. Will we all rise, sit down, stand again, please? I can only do it twice. No. No. That's not what God's song about. We come and this is why we come to the house of God prepared is we put the armor on before we even leave the house &gt;&gt; we put the armor on. &gt;&gt; But be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I created. For behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy. Now, there's plenty of scripture that shows you how that sorrow, famine, unspeakable, the history of Jerusalem, even come to a time of cannibalism and great pain. But God's speaking now natural, but he's speaking spiritual. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me declare to you this morning, if you're in famine spiritually this morning, you can reach out to the Lord this morning and declare your famine is finished. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't need to be in a famine. God has promised everything that I need. Amen. He's already given it to me. And so, what I have to do is receive that. &gt;&gt; Amen. For the voice of weeping shall be heard in her uh nor the voice of crying. There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days. For the child shall die a hundred years old, but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be a cursed. Think about that. Lord's promising here to give time and we get to be blessed or cursed in the same days. &gt;&gt; Look at the difference of what those days yield. &gt;&gt; A 20 year old filled with the Holy Ghost or a 20 year old filled with a life sentence. See what we've got? This whole issue that took place in North Idaho. How sad. How sad, my brother and sister. All because one becomes obsessed, possessed with a spirit anointed. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And at the same time, there'll be someone the same age circumstances &gt;&gt; will walk away and be filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What's our choice today? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it. I want to walk out of here fuller than I've ever been in my life. &gt;&gt; I want to walk out of here with more of Jesus Christ in my heart than I have ever had in my life before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's within my power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they shall build houses and inhabit them, and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build and another inhabit. They shall not plant and another eat. For as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall uh long enjoy the work of their hands. Now, is this talking about our physical labors? No, it's talking about the work of your hands as a son or daughter of God as children of God, your inheritance. Amen. Let me tell you kind of a paradox. You pray through and God blesses you. Can someone say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You pray through and you pray for me. God blesses you, but he also blesses me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; See, now you talk about the original pyramid. And I leave the word scheme off there because this is not a scheme. But the original pyramid shows you how that one person can affect so many. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because as your prayers, I'm just using myself for an example. As your prayers for me affect me, then it causes me to pray for others and it affects them and pretty soon it just keeps expanding out until we'll talk about right here confined in this body of believers that we have a church that is blessed. We have a church that there's no animosities, no undercurrents, no things that undermine or hinder the spirit of God. And it can start with just one person. Who would be that person that would say, "Lord, start with me. Start a revival with me today, Lord. That I can affect the one beside me." Maybe it's a husband or a wife. Maybe it'll be my own children. Maybe we sit back and become paralyzed and say, "Well, I all the circumstances just seems like it's stacked against my children." Unstack it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Go to prayer. Move it. It'll move mountains. You can move that and let it be brought in the condition that God wants it to be. You don't like the direction your children are going, don't cry about it. Don't whine about it. Pray that God would come and shift it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And my God's more powerful than any circumstance on this earth today. Amen. You want it shifted, then get down, get serious, get desperate, and shift it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We'll get down here. I'm getting off my track. Verse 24. And it shall come to pass that before they call. This is how much God wants to be in tune with you. Before they call, I will answer. We often talk and it seems like, you know, maybe you think the preacher is just using an analogy, but I tell you, I have a little circumstance that's been bothering me quite a bit. And uh I wasn't even thinking about this circumstance at that time and it just happens to be right here in this 70 weeks of Daniel and I've been reading it. My mind is somewhere else and I come across the answer. You see, sometimes before you get to the point, you'll even ask God, "Okay, I got to have an answer for this." &gt;&gt; God said, "I already heard the question you never voiced." &gt;&gt; I've already sent the answer on the way. &gt;&gt; Now, you want to think about something coming in advance. You say, "But this is just somebody's writings. This is somebody's preaching, somebody's teaching." Well, let me put it to you this way. I'm not sure exactly what year 70 weeks of Daniel was. Do you know, brother David? 1961. &gt;&gt; You'll like this. August of 1961. &gt;&gt; About five months before I was even born, &gt;&gt; God sent the answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell me God's not an ontime God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. tell me he doesn't know exactly where we're coming to in our life. And if that is too far out, then just go back to the word of God. How many times have you picked up your Bible, started reading, and God's given you an answer from the scripture? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe that would be a little more convincing to you that God really does care, that he does have the answer for you. Now, look at this. This will be a beautiful world. And sometimes we see evidence of this in this natural life. It says, "The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bulock, and the dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord." Now, I saw a little video clip the other day of people who saved a a leopard cub in Africa when it was little. Its mother died in a snare, and it was malnutrition to the point that they literally thought, "We'll just put it out of its misery." But they thought, "We'll take it home. We'll feed it. We'll see what happens." Now, leopards, if you guys are very familiar with Africa, you will understand that a lion is fierce, but there's a nature in a lion that that is seemingly tameable. &gt;&gt; You don't see too many leopards in the circus. &gt;&gt; No, that's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz a leopard would be sitting there in the circus thinking, who am I going to tear apart next? But you see, even then we see the little glimpses of what God is doing, of how someone has compassion and they raise it up and it comes back to visit them every once in a while. It brings its cubs back and shows them off to them every once in a while. The cubs are tolerant while the mother is downright friendly. The cubs are not so, you know, you're not going to pet me, &gt;&gt; but they'll stand on their porch and look at them and purr and whatever. Now, my brother and sister, you see, even the fall of the garden didn't take away every one of these heavenly attributes that's here. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan would like us to believe that this world is just entirely evil, that there's no need to serve him, just give up, you know, surrender. But I'm telling you my brother and sister, heavenly attributes are everywhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We just have to have the eyes to see it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so sometimes it is what is your expectation. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; You come to the house of God today. We've heard it preached for years. You'll get what you expect when you come to the house of God. And I believe that with all of my heart, but let's take it beyond the house of God today. What's the expectation of your life? What is the expectation of the final chapter of your life? The final paragraph of your life? What's your expectation? Is it my brother and sister? Is it a life of of somewhat success, somewhat happiness, somewhat this, somewhat that? Or are you going to come and stand on the word and say, "You know what? My God never did a halfway project. He never did a halfway deliverance. Never did a halfway healing. Never did a halfway peace. He comes and he gives everything that we need in this life has already been given to us. Now you say, "But I prayed for peace and I didn't give it." Well, why don't you stop before you get discouraged and go back through your life? Maybe there's something that you need to deal with and God's trying to catch your attention. Go back and deal with this because peace is right here. Deliverance is right here. The Holy Ghost is right here. But you got to have a clean house &gt;&gt; when you go in this scripture. I didn't write the scripture down. My brain is failing me now to remember. But my brother and sister, there's vessels of honor and vessels of dishonor. I'm telling you, when I sat down at a table, and I have before, and I just grinned and bore it, my brother and sister, but you know, it's hard to eat off a dirty utensil &gt;&gt; and a dirty plate &gt;&gt; and drink out of a dirty cup. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Natural. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; And God's not going to fill a halfway cleaned vessel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have some spirit just to be wasted to pour into a vessel that they don't care enough. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To clean it entirely. &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, it's simple fact. I hope I'm not too blunt this morning, but if you've got things in your life and and God's been dealing with me in my own life, some things, you know, you you have kind of made yourself think this is okay, Paul. But I'm telling you, it's not. And you probably heard me speak this from this pulpit before that God's dealing with me to clean things up a little bit. Let me tell you what it is. God doesn't bust the pot because because he found a spot on it. &gt;&gt; He takes it and sends it through to be washed. &gt;&gt; And it comes out, it still has a spot on it. God doesn't say, "Throw that one in the junk pile." He sends it through and he washes it again. And the washing of the water of the word is a continual process for you and I as sons and daughters of God. We don't just go to the altar. We don't just give our heart to the Lord. We don't just get baptized and go off and just live life. Amen. We need a continual washing. But don't be so judgmental that when you see someone with a smudge on their vessel that you say, "Oh, I guess they don't get it. I guess they're not a Christian. I guess they're not filled with Holy Ghost." Remember, God was willing to wash you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Give God the option, the opportunity to wash them. In fact, go back to the pyramid and be one of them that implements the washing for them. Lord, pray I Lord, lift them up, wash them, fill them, Lord. Make them worthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not looking to be judgmental, my brother and sister. We're looking to fulfill the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I got it. &gt;&gt; You see, even the cosmos, this world is looking to see sons and daughters of God manifested. &gt;&gt; People will look in the word of God with no spiritual understanding and say these things have to take place. &gt;&gt; And they are. &gt;&gt; Whether they long for that, desire for that, sigh and cry for that, it's irrelevant. They recognize things have to take place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love how that was brought up in a service here the other day. They're talking about a chunk of California when those plates do their thing and they've identified the lines, the weak places in the in the continental plates. And strangely enough, the math adds up to what a prophet said &gt;&gt; will fall in the ocean. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Wow. That was a good guess on his part, wasn't it? Man, I wished I could guess that good. God doesn't guess, my brother and sister. &gt;&gt; God knows what's going to happen. and he wrote the book and he's put every power in place and every bit of authority to bring it to pass is already put in place. God's not waiting. When this happens, I'll see if I can make this happen. No, he's already set it in motion. And when it comes, my brother and sister, it's on this time to fulfill the word in this place and this will happen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother and sister, I'll just share a little bit. I'll share a little bit a couple little things here if you don't mind real quick. I decided to discard the early one I I commented about because it's just stupid humor. But I'm telling you a brother and sister, young couple. She was pregnant I think like eight months with their first child didn't really have a house of their own. This is in Chile and they're housesitting. And so it was a welcome reprieve from living I don't remember which parents home that they lived in but you know here they are married couple can't afford a house and uh somebody says we're going to be gone for a while would you stay in our house and take care of it and they're happy man we it's almost like it's our house and wakes up in the middle of the night and something something speaks to him says get up, flee to the mountain. And he's like, "My mind's playing tricks on me." Falls back asleep. Wakes up. Flee for your life. When it happens the third time, he wakes his wife up and says, "Honey, this isn't just my brain." He gets her. Now, here she is. Now, pardon me for putting it this way, but she's barefoot and pregnant, has a house coat on in the middle of the night, silence in the streets, and he starts her walking up the road in the city. &gt;&gt; And that city is very stair stairstepped &gt;&gt; going up and they'd have to stop. She's like, I can't go any further. Go a little further. I got to stop. They finally get up and about that time the tsunami warning goes off in their city &gt;&gt; and the house &gt;&gt; that they were staying in no longer existed. &gt;&gt; There you are. Do we serve a supernatural God or not? &gt;&gt; I don't live in Chile. We're not going to have a tsunami in Idaho, but the same God is here wanting to lead you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wanting to speak to you. &gt;&gt; Will we listen? &gt;&gt; Will we listen? In fact, I forget the name of that town, but you can find it by googling ship in the middle of the city. Um, &gt;&gt; was it constitutional? That tsunami wave was so large it parked a full-size freighter, not through the buildings to end up there over the top of them. And then the ship ended up sitting in the middle of the city. Now my brother and sister, God knew that she was a daughter of God and that baby would be a son of God. &gt;&gt; And this was her son, his son, I mean, that's there as a husband. And he says, "I'm gonna save your life. I'm gonna guide you, lead you, and guide you." Wakes him up. Not a sound in the city. All quiet. Now, there's never a quiet city in Chile because there's a few thousand dogs in that city. But my brother and sister, God knows how to speak to us. I just give that to a little example to you to realize that what God is doing for them or did you might say past tense he's doing for you. &gt;&gt; And can we lift a hand and say it's past tense for me? God is leading me. God has led me. He's taking me through the battle, through the fire, through the flood. He's taking me to the place where I need to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Got it? So even the cosmos is looking for this to be manifested to fulfill God's calling in their life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, it's something that really bothers me. I see way too many believers falling into a pattern. Christians, too many Christians. Whatever will be will be &gt;&gt; right. Okay. So, if the mountain's going to move, it's just going to move on its own. Jesus said, "You speak to the mountain." &gt;&gt; There's some action required on our part as believers to speak to the mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. How how hard is that, my brother and sister? But if you don't have faith enough to even believe as it were for a toothache, then you're going to have a hard time thinking you're going to speak to a mountain and it's going to move. Now that m mountain might be in your heart, might be in your mind, it might be a literal circumstance out here or could be a literal mountain. But if you would not doubt, amen, would not question, would have faith and you speak to these circumstances, they will change. But if we sit back and say, "Well, you know, God's so in control. &gt;&gt; Whatever will be will be. [Music] &gt;&gt; No need to read our Bible cuz whatever will be will be. No need to pray cuz whatever will be will be. No need to leave your house, but we'd starve after a while." No. No. God will probably send a crow to you. &gt;&gt; If you believe whatever will be will be. &gt;&gt; My Bible says you don't work, you don't eat. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that doesn't count for you guys that sit at home on a computer. And that's that's &gt;&gt; but you see my brother and sister, what God is doing is he's training up a people &gt;&gt; that can take the word of God and say this is where I apply this. This is where I take this and this is what I put in place for my life here. Amen. And you know what happens? What Satan is doing? Uh he he is coming and he's trying to get our focus. You say, "Brother Paul, it's such a stressful world to make a living, to work, to do. It's so stressful. No matter how much stress you have in your life, now I'm I'm talking to you now as your friend, your brother. I don't care how much stress you have in your life, you have no excuse to take your eyes off the goal." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Your world in the natural can be crumbling around you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Financially, you can have troubles. health. You can have troubles, workplace troubles, everything. And that is no reason for us to take our eyes off the goal. &gt;&gt; That is Satan injecting himself into the life of a son or daughter of God. That if he can get us to start looking at what our situation is, well, because of this, I can't do this. Tell me where the word will back that up. The word says, because of that, you will do this anyhow. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You will take the word anyhow and hold on to that word anyhow. We've never seen rain. I'm getting in the ark anyhow. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I don't know that I've ever seen a real evidence of the Holy Ghost, but I'm a believer. I'll pursue the Holy Ghost anyhow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So fatalistic. Got it. &gt;&gt; So fatalistic. &gt;&gt; It's just going to happen whether I have any input or not. &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you my brother and sister, footsteps are possession. &gt;&gt; Is that not the scripture? &gt;&gt; Just stand there and see how much of it you possess. &gt;&gt; It didn't say when you have an incredible earthshaking revelation, &gt;&gt; take a step. Only believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And take the next step. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Only believe &gt;&gt; and take the next step. &gt;&gt; Only believe. Take the next step. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There was two men once on a very hard journey. And as they're going along, the one man acknowledged there is a God. the other man was a Christian. And every time they would come to a difficult situation, the Christian would cry out and say, "Lord, I can't go no further. You I need you. Help me, Lord. Help me. Come on the scene." After a while, the other man got tired of hearing it and says, "Look, are you trying to convince you or me?" And he says, "Well, both." Because you see, I know it's true. I'm just reminding myself. And if it changes you, so much the better. At the end of their journey, the one man says, "I'm convinced." &gt;&gt; Now, it seems so worth un you know, unworthile. &gt;&gt; You know, keep your prayers to yourself. I'm not a Christian or I I don't. &gt;&gt; Okay, fine. But if God anoints you, Lord, help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, help us. Lord, help us. Maybe you are convincing you and them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many times do you guys ever talk to yourselves? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you know, it's kind of funny. You know, I I knew a guy years ago, really, really smart guy. He would always say, you know, it's no problem to talk to yourself. Get concerned when you start answering back. But you know what? We need to answer back. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul, do you believe? Lord, yes, I do believe. &gt;&gt; Is this the word? Paul says, "This is the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. And you need to speak that because it will change your perspective. Let me just share interject just a little bit. when I was, you know, coming back out of the world and and struggling, you know, here I am, a married man, three children, you know, moving forward in a a decent business, etc. And and, you know, God was dealing with my heart. I would go to church and I would sit there a clam kind of like some Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to insinuate some of you were clams, but anyway. And I kept thinking, I kept hearing the preacher just like I'm kind of poking you saying, you know, if you believe it, say amen. And I'm like, I expected maybe I'd be like, "Amen. I'm not going to." Nope. But something kept stirring me. &gt;&gt; And you're going to think I'm crazy. And you're right. I remember one day I literally no one in the house walked in and stood in front of a mirror, looked myself in the eye, and said, "Say it, Paul. Come on, Paul. You can say it. Amen. &gt;&gt; That didn't hurt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can do this. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Pretty soon I got some vigor in it. Amen. Pretty soon I figured it it's even better when when your hands up. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I got to church and it was still, whoa, people think. &gt;&gt; And then the next revelation God gave me is to stand in front of a mirror and be able to look in the mirror and look myself in the eyes and say, I don't care what they think. &gt;&gt; Out in public, I did &gt;&gt; front of the mirror. I could say it, &gt;&gt; but I said it till I believed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when I got to the place I believed it doesn't matter what you think. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; After all, I have scripture to back it up. It's by the foolishness of preaching. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'll be a fool for Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we'll stand here and we'll do what God calls us to do. So, you know, it's quite another position. One to say God's going to do what God's going to do. I don't need to do anything. But another one to stand here and I trust this is where you're at this morning is to stand here and say I am here this morning and I know you are because I can see you. I am here this morning to fulfill the word of God for my life. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm here this morning. I'm not here to be seen, to be heard, to do anything. It's not a fashion show. It's not whatever. Amen. I'm here to fulfill what God wants me to fulfill for my life. &gt;&gt; That's my one goal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you must be a fool for Christ, then be the best fool ever. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm here to fulfill that calling because if you believe you're here by accident, &gt;&gt; I had a friend when we were kids and his dad &gt;&gt; in a joking way would always say, you know, you're our accidental child. and he grew up and he he adopted that. He said, "Yeah, I'm just an accident. I'm just an accident. I'm just an accident." One day he comes. Turns out his family changed churches and went away from one of those that you know had the choir and the whole deal and went to a church where the preacher spit and slobbered and yelled and stomped all over the place. And he says, "I'm not an accident." And it's like, "Really? What? You've said you're an accident ever since I first met you. Now, our pastor was preaching this last Sunday, and he says, "God placed me here." That's right. &gt;&gt; For a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if God placed me here for a purpose, that can't be an accident. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, are you an accident? &gt;&gt; Or are you here for a purpose? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, in the military, never been there, but I've studied it. If you're ever placed in a post of duty and you abandon that post of duty, it's called AWOL. And there's consequences. &gt;&gt; I'm actually glad that I serve a God that is so loving, so kind, and so gracious because we'd all be in prison for awall. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, God's got you here for a reason. He wants you to fulfill that word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not here to sign a book. How many sign How many of you have your names on the books of Grace Tabernacle? If you do, I'd like to know where the book is at. &gt;&gt; But I'm here, Lord, at my posted duty &gt;&gt; to fulfill your will, &gt;&gt; to fulfill your word. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, my expectation is that when God called me, he didn't call me to be a slacker and sit around under a palm tree drinking lemonade. And while everyone else fights, as the song says, must I be raised on flowery beds of ease while others fight and sail the bloody seas? Amen. That's not what it is. Now look at it here in Psalm 62 and5. Amen. I need to hurry up. Somebody pray that I go fast. My soul wait thou only upon God, for my expectation is from him. &gt;&gt; He only is my rock and my salvation. He is my defense. I shall not be moved. In God is my salvation and my glory. The rock of my strength and my refuge is in God. &gt;&gt; Trust in him at all times. &gt;&gt; All times &gt;&gt; some midnight hour &gt;&gt; if you should find &gt;&gt; you're in a prison in your mind. Call 911. &gt;&gt; No, call him. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's the answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Trust in him at all times, you people. Pour out your heart before him. God is a refuge for us. I love that scripture. When I come across that, I thought, Lord, that is so beautiful. Amen. Cuz he is everything. You realize this covers every part of your life right here. There's not one aspect of your life that is un not covered by Psalm 62. Amen. He is your strength, your rock, your salvation, your defense. He's kept kept you from just getting blown away by the cares of life. Amen. I don't want to get sidetracked. I love to talk on the cares of life because I love to watch your reactions cuz, you know, it's it's pretty easy, you know, talking about cares of life. And some people like look around like, "Oh, who's got to care?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And others flinch. &gt;&gt; The one is called naive. The other one's living in reality without deliverance. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's it. That's it. &gt;&gt; So you can be in reality, but you actually need deliverance. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, expectation is not just what the Lord will do for you today. Now, I don't want to I don't want to sound counterculture to what we believe. Come to church expecting. Amen. But it's not just I'm coming to church today for what the Lord can do for me today. Amen. What is an investment? Is an investment an in immediate return? &gt;&gt; No. Long term. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let our prayers, our expectation be longterm. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't care if I have to climb through broken glass, beds of nails, whatever it might be. I see the goal and I'm going to reach that goal. And what today is doesn't matter as long as I reach that goal. &gt;&gt; Amen. If anything would try to stop me short of that goal, I'm going to deny it in the name of Jesus Christ and press on. &gt;&gt; In Jesus' name, we press on. Amen. So, it's not about how you feel today. Well, I don't understand what he's saying today. Then keep listening and let God speak to you and tomorrow he'll give you an answer and you press on. Amen. But you see, it's not an expectation. It's not just today, but it's also your vision. &gt;&gt; What will I see tomorrow? Well, I'll tell you what we'll see tomorrow. But we'll see the same God that was here yesterday and the same God that is here today will be present with you tomorrow. That will be your vision. And when he's present with you tomorrow, but tomorrow never comes because tomorrow will be today &gt;&gt; and he'll be with you tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep following my brother and sister. It's a nevers stopping, amen, neverending, eternal circle that just goes on because your day, your tomorrow becomes your today and God is there today. Amen. So that means that you can stand here today and say my tomorrow is already covered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever I need for tomorrow, which will be &gt;&gt; my today &gt;&gt; already taken care of. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many times have you as people financial struggles, whatever the struggle might be, relationship struggle, emotional struggle, whatever it is, and we walk around answering questions that have never been asked. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, when they say, "Why did you do this?" I'm going to tell them, "I did this because of this." &gt;&gt; And if they say this, I'm going to say this. And when they act like this, I'm going to do this. &gt;&gt; And when they look at me like they look at me, I'm going to go. &gt;&gt; And if you were out in public like that, people would say, "That person's crazy." &gt;&gt; But we have these conversations &gt;&gt; with our self &gt;&gt; of something that's never going to happen. &gt;&gt; That's it. Exactly. Right. So now you're trying to make your tomorrow today and let it rule yesterday so that the future will be better. &gt;&gt; An impossible scenario. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God is the God of yesterday. &gt;&gt; He's the God of today. &gt;&gt; He's the God of your tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All things, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; are under his dominion. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So why don't you just live today to the best you can by the word? &gt;&gt; That's it. Let your expectation be. I will live the word today. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I will finish this day being able to stand before God, maybe in my own private quiet room somewhere, whatever it might be, and I'll be able to look up at my savior and say, "Lord, thank you for this day that you blessed me. Thank you for your word that carried me through today because my expectation was that you would help me get through today and you've met it and you'll get through my tomorrow." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And enough tomorrows, you'll be in the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the problem is we've turned the rapture into a goal. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; You realize the rapture is not a goal. &gt;&gt; It's a relationship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You step into that atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. Enoch experience that, brother David. Enoch would have been sitting here in church the other night and he'd have shouted the roof off. He said, "That's exactly what happened there. I'm just living life." See, you guys got Enoch as some perfect guy that never fussed with his wife. Well, she might have fussed with him. Sorry, sisters. Never had a trouble. Never went to work. Never had problems. Never had a headache. Never had a foot that hurt. Never hit his thumb with a hammer. Now, no, we get this idea. Here's Enoch. Just this so perfect aura. &gt;&gt; Enoch lived in a perfect aura. Then God would be obligated to give you a perfect That's &gt;&gt; exactly &gt;&gt; aura. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't live in a perfect aura. &gt;&gt; He lived in a perfect faith in a perfect word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you talk about it. back and see Enoch going right along. Got a band-aid on his thumb trying to fix the screen door. Had kids and a cat that hung on the screen door. He's walking along thinking, "My foot hurts, but the word says I'm healed." &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; That boss of mine. He'd fire me in a heartbeat if he could. Lord, maybe another job. And he feels something and he's there thinking about all that's wrong. And he felt something and the atmosphere changed. And he says, &gt;&gt; "But Lord, you saved my soul." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've filled me with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You've provided for me. You've healed my body. You've done all these things. All I can say is is thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. The job doesn't matter. The screen door doesn't matter. The boss at work doesn't matter. You're the one that matters. And he stepped into an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God said, "I'm pleased with you, Enoch. &gt;&gt; Come walk with me." &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; No, we've got it. Then Enoch, the pious guy with the flowing robes that had all the scripture memorized, never made a mistake. When we get to heaven, we'll ask him. Except for the scripture says he'll have no remembrance. &gt;&gt; So, we won't even be able to ask him, "What was your life on earth like, Enoch?" I don't know. I've just dwelt my whole life in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That earth thing. Was I ever on earth? &gt;&gt; Was I ever part of the cosmos? &gt;&gt; Some of you will get to heaven still worried about paying your mortgage. &gt;&gt; Sorry, that was an uncalled for comment. You see your vision of today, tomorrow, of your expected end. What is our vision of our expected end my brother and sister? &gt;&gt; Are you looking for an escape or looking for a fulfillment? &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; Now, the definition, I had to look up the word fulfillment because I wanted to make sure I used it correctly. Fulfillment is the achievement of one's heart's desire. &gt;&gt; There you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, I'm not looking for an escape from this earth. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for fulfillment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of a heart's desire. &gt;&gt; That's it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I need to hurry right along. Now, look how God views you for just a moment. Revelations 195-9. &gt;&gt; And a voice came out of the throne, saying, "Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, as the voice of many waters, the voice of mighty thundering, saying, Allelujah, for the Lord God omnipotent reignth. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him, for the marriage of the lamb is come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I identify with this scripture. I hold it as one of my favorite scriptures. Because what he's telling us here is we'll give honor to him and praise and glory to him because we're at a marriage. We're we're at a wedding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You realize that what's the millennium is? It's not the great escape. Millennium is your wedding time with the Lord Jesus Christ. your time of celebration, your time and you'll come into that and you're there because God says, "Oh, come look. The marriage of the lamb and his wife hath made herself ready." The priest didn't do it. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white, for fine linen is the righteousness of saints. And he saith unto me, "Write, blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb." And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God. Now I want to know right now how many of you get up in the morning. Amen. Brother Isaac shared something with me a few days ago that's just really really been really been affecting me. A little study he read a little psychology you know a little off in that neuroscience thing of the mind and you know he just really dug into that. Wow. You guys turned me off. No. A little research shows the very first thoughts you have in the morning impact your whole day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And up till just a few days ago, I'd wake up in the morning and I'd start chucking through the paperwork. Got to fix this, got to do that, got to this, got to that. Oh man, man. And my day starts off and the doctor's like, "You have too much cortisol in your blood. too much stress. &gt;&gt; I've been waking up. Lord, if today is not the day of the rapture, tomorrow will be. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I did wake up this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, thank you, Lord, for your blessings. &gt;&gt; Yeah. you know, I'm not exactly the sign of fitness, but of health, but but thank you, Lord, that you're you're changing me. &gt;&gt; I I'm not getting weaker, I'm getting stronger. &gt;&gt; And Lord, spiritually, I'm not getting weaker. I'm getting stronger. And I lay there in bed and I think, "Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord, for this work you're doing for me." I get out of bed and then I want company, so I go make coffee and I wave it under Sister Jerry's nose to wake her up. it works. And um and I'm suddenly happy. Not like I was unhappy, but suddenly it's just like changed the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you see, I was called to fulfill this word of God right here. &gt;&gt; I was called to show up at the marriage supper of the lamb. I was called to be clothed in white linen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was called to stand there before the throne. I'm not making this just personal to me. I'm speaking it in first person, but it's for you. Amen. We were called to this. We're called to fulfill this word. Oh, but brother Paul, you know, I got bills to pay and I've got children to raise and I've got a car that makes weird noises and a job I don't like. That's all temporal. Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't let it distract you and take your vision from the goal and bring it down here and lock it on to these things that God can change tomorrow. And if he doesn't change it tomorrow, it won't matter because one of these days soon you'll be gone anyhow. You won't be saying, "Lord, you can't have a rapture today. I've still got a mortgage to pay." &gt;&gt; You won't be saying, "Oh, praise God. The rapture's on. I won't have to pay the mortgage." You won't be thinking about that. You'll be thinking in a twinkling of an eye. I'll get to see my Lord face to face. I'll get to see the saints of all those rugged soldiers of the cross. I've made it. Oh Lord, thank you. I made it. &gt;&gt; Cuz none of this will matter anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I can tell by some of your reactions, this is mattering quite a bit at the moment, though. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, I do believe in paying your bills. I do believe in taking care of business and and these kind of things. But I believe this is the business we really ought to take care of. &gt;&gt; This is the business that ought to be at the top of our list. This ought to be the business that takes that &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; focus &gt;&gt; that we focus on this. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In the sermon perseverance, brother Brown says this. As you know, I believe then to bring that a little higher that God's got all of his church now, the called out remnant of his church under expectations of his coming. You see, I remember at the gate in his coming there must have been a tremendous Good Friday when they noted he was coming to the feast and expectations and many of them was expecting him to be there. Now look at this. I hope that you place yourself in the right category here. &gt;&gt; Someone to see some kind of miracle. &gt;&gt; Others are wanting just to see him. Others wanted to make fun of him. &gt;&gt; It's kind of a different Passover that had been for a long time. And we rode into the city. Let's just be expecting him to come and take us home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then when he comes this time, see, there's where our expectation. It isn't about, oh, &gt;&gt; pardon me for going here. This critic says this and this critic says that. What does your critic say? &gt;&gt; I don't care what they said. What do you say? index. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't come down and say, "Hey, did you guys um commission the pew pole to see what they think of me?" He narrowed it right down and says, "Who do you say?" &gt;&gt; Amen. s here as any kind of critic you want this morning. &gt;&gt; It wouldn't be a critic of Paul. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother David. You beat me to the punchline, &gt;&gt; but that's good. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how we view it. It needs to come down to thou art the Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The son of the living God. &gt;&gt; That's what all matters. You don't like my punctuation. You don't like my presentation. That's irrelevant. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Who do you say &gt;&gt; today? We need to be able to say the word of God. This is the son of God. Thou art the Christ and you are in me and I am in you and your word is living today. And it is focused me so much on the goal. Now, let me take you back to just a little natural thing right here. And somewhat recently here, there was a a young person uh just ran young woman just ran the fastest mile that a young woman has ran in for however many years. And they're they're asking this question. I was just reading it as a as a paragraph or two. They ask her a question, you know, what was you thinking? And it says that she paused and looked at them and said, "I wasn't. I was running. Are we thinking &gt;&gt; or are we running? &gt;&gt; Amen. You start thinking and you'll have to stop running to do your thinking. &gt;&gt; But it's time for us to just look at the goal and say, "You know what? God called me to that goal and I'm going to run &gt;&gt; and I'm going to keep running and I'm going to put every effort, every energy I've got into running this race. And when I get to the finish line, I expect to hear the words, "Well done, my good and faithful servant." Amen. Not, "What were you thinking?" &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's time for us to refocus. That's right. &gt;&gt; On the goal. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not on what we've done, where we've been, what we own, but to focus on the goal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, Satan's job is to lower your expectation. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. Let's just sum it up. That's very simplistic, but let's just sum it up. It's much more complex than that. It is one of those on the board, you know, the parentheses 2x * y, you know, deals that that's actually Satan's plan gets that complex. Or we can simplify it. It all equals he's trying to confuse you your vision of the goal. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Hm. Muddy water. I was in Chile one time and a brother said, "Hey, brother Paul, we're going to go swimming. You want to go with us?" I was there as a minister and I I didn't really feel like partaking, you know, going swimming. Not that I felt pious or anything, but I just like I'm not here to to do it. It was hot out, but we walked down a trail. Sister Jerry's off with some sisters. We walk down a trail and we get down to the swimming pool and I remember commenting to a brother there that was a good friend of mine. I says, "Brother, in Idaho." He goes, "Yeah, yeah. What?" I said, "We don't call this a swimming pool in Idaho. We call this a mud puddle." He just looked at me. It's deeper than a mud puddle. My brother and sister, Satan wants to muddy the water. &gt;&gt; There's nothing cleansing in a mud puddle. &gt;&gt; You get out just as dirty as you went in. &gt;&gt; And that's what Satan's trying to do. He's trying to cause us to lose our vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. Or he'll erase our expectations altogether. Just recently talked to an individual used the phrase, "It makes my heart hurt. I used to be a Christian. Talk about making your heart hurt, right? They totally totally lost their expectation. &gt;&gt; Their vision is gone and they've lost or it's been blinded to them their vision of God's expected end for them. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you this, my Bible says those he's called out, he will call in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've got quite a bit more here. So, maybe we'll just move on. Well, actually, let me just jump to this. Let's just jump to this communion. I'll cut out all the personal commentary if you don't mind. Is there not a quote for communion on there? I'll just read it to you real quick here, saints. What if the apostle would have said, "Now, after nine days, we believe we got it. See, let's just accept it by faith and go ahead with our work. See, it would have never worked out. They waited there until they knew something happened. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And that's what's the trouble of us is today we don't stay long enough. &gt;&gt; That's right. Absolutely right. &gt;&gt; Well, that's the reason afterwards we can just live any kind of life and do anything. Don't bother us because we didn't stay there long enough. Today we're in, tomorrow we're out. And this way and that way. If we stay long enough till you get in and close the door behind you, &gt;&gt; there you are. &gt;&gt; You're going to stay in there. &gt;&gt; You're sealed into the day of your redemption. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We go in. I don't know about you, my phone won't ring for two or three hours. I go to pray and it won't stop ringing. &gt;&gt; I have failed that test before. &gt;&gt; Do you know what I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; We got up and we went and answered the phone. &gt;&gt; Let's put those two as priorities on the scale. &gt;&gt; Which one's going to win? telephone. Bing. Got to answer that thing. It might be somebody telling me I won the lottery that I never bought a ticket to. &gt;&gt; Seek you first. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it. That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; I promise you, the devil's been waiting all day for you to pray so he could have somebody call you. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then you know what the phone call actually was? &gt;&gt; Hi, &gt;&gt; I'm Mary Beth. Our company wants to offer you a job. Pays you $1,000 a day for two hours of work. All we need is your social security number and your bank account number and your driver's license number and click See, when Satan breaks that, &gt;&gt; okay, this is confessional time. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; When Satan breaks that, did you go right back in the room and go pray? &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; No. At that point, you're thirsty. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And you go take a drink and decide that you want to eat a cookie. &gt;&gt; And once you eat a cookie, you got to clean up the mess. And then you remembered you didn't go get the mail. And then by then your stomach's still growling and you're wondering what's for supper. &gt;&gt; Prayer time. &gt;&gt; Our goal. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Gone. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Satan's a sly old fox. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How about we set a trap for the fox? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. The phone will ring. &gt;&gt; Let it ring. &gt;&gt; That's right. Somebody knocks on the door, &gt;&gt; let them knock. A brother once in closing, Sister Vik, if you would come. A brother told me once, he said, "Brother Paul, now Sister Nadia won't like this because I find humor in this, but she'll forgive me." This brother told me, he says, 'Well, Paul, I got rid of the cat. And I was like, 'Oh, really? How'd you do that? He said, ' Every time I get down to pray, that thing climbs the screen door. And finally, I decided the prophet said, and I went out there and said, in the name of Jesus Christ, I don't know where he landed, but he never came back. So he didn't see it as the cat. He saw it was the devil anointed the cat. But the cat must have agreed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cuz he went and climbed the screen door. &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, don't lose your focus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep focused. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the rest of this is distraction. &gt;&gt; This happened in Arkansas. I've shared it here in the church. We're preaching there at Word of Life Hardy, Arkansas. Out of nowhere, I just start talking about how we we say is a blessing from God. This is a blessing from God. And I'm just starting to preach a scenario. I said, "So, you know, your company, your company says, hey, we want to give you a substantial raise. We want to make you a manager. We want to do all of this stuff, but you'll have to work Sundays and you'll have to close the store on Wednesdays. Now, I'm telling you how God in the foolishness of preaching can be so precise. Literally was a young man. Their front row is a little farther away than ours, but a young man just right here. his mother sitting just past Sister Jerry and the pastor's wife on the other side of the church. Little did I know that that was exactly what that company was offering that young man. And he was supposed to walk out of church that day and call them and give them an answer. And up to that point in time, he'd already told his mother before church, "I think I'm going to take the job. I need the money." But God is so precise. come right down and used the foolishness of preaching to touch his heart. And he got up, walked out of church, called his boss, and said, "I know you're not going to understand, but I put it in the balance, [Music] and serving God won." &gt;&gt; Amen. And his boss says, "Well, if you ever reconsider, the job's still yours." And he says, "Don't wait for me." [Music] &gt;&gt; The house of God, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's more important than even my work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God blessed that young man. I kept track a little bit by phone a little bit. God blessed that young man. Gave him a better job. &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, that's what God wants us to do. Exactly. &gt;&gt; Don't lose focus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On the goal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep your eyes on the cross. Keep your eyes on Jesus. Don't lose your focus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've been a bit little bit lengthy here. Let's just stand. I'd like to sing the song 365. Amen. Hallelujah. Forgive me for my rambling. Amen. These things the Lord just lays on your heart, you just have to put them out. [Music] This is my desire to honor [Music] you and with all my heart I worship you I have within me I give you praise that I adore is in you, [Music] Lord. I give you my heart. I give you my soul. I live for you alone. Every breath that I take, every moment I wait. Oh, have your way with me. Let's sing verse two again. Lord, I give you my heart. I give you my soul. I live for you alone. Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake. Oh, have your way in me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I just as I was studying this out, it just kept coming to me over and over again. Lord, Lord, have your way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let your desire be fulfilled in me. Father, the word has showed me so clearly what you called me for. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Help me stay focused, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not to try and think while I'm running the race, not to reason why I'm running the race, but just run. And the goal, the goal is set before us. It's not a moving goal. It's not a moving target. It's his word. It's unchanging through the ages. The same yesterday, today, and forever. The same God, the same calling, the same results. Oh Lord, I give you my heart, give you my soul. I live for you alone every month that I take. Lord, I give you my heart. I give you my soul. I live for you alone. Every breath that I take, every moment I'm away, have your way with me. I'm resting on the finished work of Jesus Christ today. All circumstances will be gone. The word of God will still remain. No sickness, fear, no guilt or sin can have control and worry me. The keys of faith are in my hands and I am bound for victory. I am free. My new day has come. Now I can be who I truly am. I am free. Covered by his blood. All things are possible with God. All things are possible with God. [Music] A great commission from my Lord. I have now received. The prince of power of the air will never have a pardon me. As amateur creator, I can change the atmosphere around. I use the chain of circumstance for any spirit to be bound. For I am free. My new day has come. Now I can be who I truly am. [Music] I am free. Covered by his blood. All things are possible with God. All things are possible with God. Oh, I know that Jesus the I am is the same today. The prophet came to show the light. The bride must have it on display. The hour has come for Christ in us. to be completely glorified. I want the spirit to be free to do the greater works in me. I am free. My new day has come. Now I can be who I truly am. I am free. Covered by his blood. All things are possible with God. All things are possible with God. I am free. Oh, I am free. My new day has come. Now I can be who I truly am. I am free. sovereigned by his blood. All things are possible with God. All things are possible with God. [Music] Amen. Can we sing? In Christ alone I place my trust. It's number 363. It's key of A. In Christ alone will I glory. So I could pride myself in battles won. For I've been blessed beyond measure and by his strength alone overcome. And oh, I could stop and count successes like diamonds in my hands. But those trophies could not equal to the grace by which I stand. In Christ alone I place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross and every victory. glory. Let it be said of me. My source of strength, my source of hope is Christ alone. in Christ alone do I glory. For only by his grace I am redeemed. For only his tender mercy could reach beyond my weakness to my knee. And now I seek no greater honor in just to know him more. And to count my gains but losses to the glory. of my Lord. In Christ alone, I place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross. and every victory. Let it be said of me. My source of strength. My source of hope is Christ alone. One more time. In Christ alone I place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross. In every victory, let it be said of me, my source of strength. My source of hope is Christ alone. Amen. and praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's change it up a bit before we dismiss. I'll sing the original life. It's KFG um 462. God's attributes were manifested to his bride in this last age. We have caught the revelation by the last prophet's message. And we know who we are and what we're raised up for. Praise the Lord. for the original life. The original life. The original seed.
