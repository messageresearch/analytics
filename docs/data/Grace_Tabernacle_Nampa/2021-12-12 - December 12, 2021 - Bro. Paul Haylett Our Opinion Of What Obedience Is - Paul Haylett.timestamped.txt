[40:04] until i found out that i'm older than
[40:06] brother john
[40:07] and
[40:08] so
[40:09] it puts a new light on old friends
[40:12] but anyway we're just really happy to
[40:14] have them um their their time down here
[40:17] in the states and traveling through
[40:19] and i say thank you brothers for coming
[40:21] and
[40:22] bringing your lick of fire together with
[40:24] us today
[40:25] um
[40:26] new year's
[40:27] coming up very quickly upon us
[40:30] uh brother sergey and sister yulia have
[40:33] offered their home with desire to host
[40:36] new year's at their house and i say this
[40:38] kindly saint so no one misunderstand but
[40:41] in my heart last year i felt a little
[40:43] sad that we didn't give more time to the
[40:45] lord
[40:46] in our new year
[40:48] and so i just desire you pray about this
[40:51] we want to come together in fellowship
[40:53] we want to have conversation we want to
[40:55] enjoy ourselves but it's my heart's
[40:57] desire brother sergey and i are talking
[40:59] about this and this was on brother
[41:01] sergey's heart so if i hadn't brought it
[41:03] up brother sergey as the host would have
[41:05] guided you in that direction anyway
[41:07] because it was on his heart but we want
[41:10] to devote that certain portion of time
[41:14] to the lord to give praise thanksgiving
[41:16] worship to him in new year's time and
[41:20] and i believe that uh you need to look
[41:22] to them don't look to us
[41:24] uh for guidance on that uh maybe sister
[41:27] uh yulia
[41:29] coordinate with your sisters for food
[41:31] and and whatnot and let's remember
[41:35] that
[41:36] we want to be respectful of their home
[41:38] and and this time and
[41:40] i i enjoyed last year minus my little
[41:43] disappointment
[41:45] that we didn't really give time to the
[41:46] lord
[41:47] and so let's just
[41:49] let's just pause
[41:50] this coming new years
[41:53] and
[41:54] enjoy our time at their home
[41:56] and
[41:57] and give proper
[41:59] praise worship and time to our lord
[42:01] jesus christ
[42:03] we will be having communion

[43:09] nobody please take it that way
[43:11] but we haven't had sunday school
[43:14] we had fellowships
[43:16] it's just time for us to finish
[43:19] our remodel on our church

[43:45] we need to just rally together and just

[43:50] church finished to get our children back
[43:51] in sunday school
[43:53] and
[43:55] to do
[43:56] these things amen good to be in the
[43:58] house of god
[43:59] i'm glad to be your brother in christ
[44:02] i'm glad to be
[44:03] joined together with saints of lack
[44:05] precious faith let's just go into the
[44:07] word this morning i want to speak to you
[44:09] once again
[44:12] on
[44:13] the two sides of obedience
[44:16] and
[44:16] i would title this today
[44:19] our opinion
[44:21] of what obedience is
[44:24] and i hope today by the word of god i
[44:26] can show you that we can actually
[44:28] believe
[44:30] we are being obedient
[44:34] when we're not
[44:36] it reminds me just a little something
[44:38] that happened you know in the last while
[44:40] kind of lodged my memory mom can i have
[44:43] a cookie
[44:44] mom says yes you can have a cookie
[44:46] and the little boy walks off with three
[44:50] was he really obedient
[44:52] he should have said mom can i have three
[44:54] cookies
[44:56] but if he'd ask for three he would have
[44:57] taken five
[45:01] so we take a certain liberty
[45:04] and we still feel like
[45:06] we're obedient
[45:07] let's look at this today as we just turn
[45:10] in the word of god
[45:11] amen
[45:12] because i tell you saints it's on my
[45:14] heart
[45:15] as i i
[45:17] lay this out to you i i hope that you
[45:19] can see it and the way the lord laid it
[45:21] upon my heart we'll turn first samuel
[45:24] the 15th chapter starting with the 17th
[45:26] verse
[45:27] and uh
[45:28] in this
[45:29] i i said i i hope it really
[45:32] is clear to you if it's not someone
[45:35] please say clarify paul because see we
[45:38] don't want to just gloss over things
[45:39] saying well we read this scripture we
[45:41] come to the house of god we prayed we
[45:43] worshiped all as well we need to walk
[45:45] away with clarity we need to walk away
[45:48] understanding what it is god expects of
[45:51] us and knowing now it's not a works
[45:53] gospel my brother and sister but the
[45:55] scripture clearly lays out there certain
[45:57] things god says i want you to do this
[46:00] and if we just think that they're
[46:01] optional we'll go through life almost
[46:04] always choosing the option
[46:08] god didn't want us to choose the option
[46:09] he wanted us to choose the word
[46:11] amen let's read first samuel 15
[46:15] 17.
[46:17] and samuel said
[46:19] now he's speaking to saul here you can
[46:20] see in the scripture and samuel said
[46:22] when thou was little
[46:24] in thine own sight
[46:27] waste thou not made the head of the
[46:29] tribes of israel and the lord anointed
[46:32] thee king over israel
[46:34] and the lord sent thee on a journey and
[46:37] said go
[46:38] and utterly destroy the sinners of the
[46:41] amalekites
[46:42] and fight against them until they be
[46:45] consumed
[46:46] wherefore then did us thou not obey the
[46:49] voice of the lord
[46:50] and didest fly upon the spoil and didest
[46:54] evil in the sight of the lord
[46:57] and saul said unto samuel yea
[47:00] i have obeyed the voice of the lord
[47:03] and have gone the way which the lord
[47:05] sent me and have brought egg the king of
[47:08] amalek and have already destroyed the
[47:10] amalekites
[47:12] but
[47:13] the people
[47:17] but the people took of the foil sheep
[47:20] and oxen and chief of the things which
[47:22] should have been utterly destroyed to
[47:24] sacrifice unto the lord thy god at
[47:27] gilgal now you notice saul does not
[47:29] identify
[47:31] at that moment
[47:32] his lord he's talking to samuel saying
[47:35] the lord thy god
[47:38] he needed to identify this
[47:40] personal
[47:42] but you see
[47:43] deep down inside
[47:45] he was not able to identify personally
[47:48] because he knew he was out of the will
[47:49] of god
[47:53] and samuel said half the lord as
[47:56] hath the lord as delight in burnt
[47:58] offerings and sacrifices as in obeying
[48:02] the voice of the lord
[48:04] behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[48:08] and to hearken than the fat of realms
[48:11] for rebellion is as the sin of
[48:14] witchcraft and stubbornness as iniquity
[48:17] and idolatry because thou has rejected
[48:20] the word of the lord he hath also
[48:23] rejected thee from being king
[48:26] heavenly father we ask for your
[48:28] leadership your guidance
[48:30] father we
[48:32] remove ourselves lord to the best of our
[48:34] ability that you could just come and
[48:37] lord let our voice speak your word and
[48:39] your word alone
[48:40] lord we thank you for revelation
[48:43] in the day that we live in
[48:46] not father some man's
[48:49] thoughts or theology
[48:51] but the word of god made known revealed
[48:54] a living word
[48:56] in the hearts and lives of sons and
[48:58] daughters
[48:59] bless this time we pray today and lord
[49:01] to the saints father
[49:03] may not be here where they might be
[49:06] today
[49:07] be with the bride of christ
[49:09] speak to their needs speak to their
[49:11] hearts we pray
[49:12] amen and amen
[49:23] as we would look at these thoughts today
[49:26] i just want to come back into this
[49:28] scripture
[49:29] and i want to
[49:31] just kind of touch upon these things
[49:33] that samuel speaks
[49:35] now
[49:36] i actually
[49:39] shortened my thoughts or labored to
[49:41] shorten my thoughts
[49:43] today so just pray with me i want this
[49:45] to be timely and not drawn out
[49:47] but there was such uh so much you know
[49:50] you open the scripture and it just seems
[49:52] like a simple thought and then as you
[49:54] study and research and pray it just
[49:56] keeps growing amen
[49:59] samuel now gives actually an indictment
[50:02] to saul he is not coming and giving him
[50:04] a a pass or a pat on the back he's not
[50:07] there saying you know hey you tried and
[50:10] that's good enough he is actually
[50:12] speaking to him in uh the form you might
[50:15] say of an indictment and he said you
[50:18] know when you was little uh uh you know
[50:21] this
[50:22] this uh position that you was in when
[50:24] you was little and my brother and sister
[50:26] you see
[50:27] it is not oh how do i say this it is not
[50:31] so much
[50:33] that you could say well you know what
[50:35] this person this person the church
[50:37] thinks i'm humble
[50:39] but it's how you actually feel about
[50:41] yourself see god does not like a hearty
[50:43] spirit but sometimes a haughty spirit
[50:46] can be veiled or camouflaged that you
[50:49] know i feel more spiritual than you
[50:51] brother trevor and i would never voice
[50:53] that out loud but i would feel it my
[50:56] heart and think it and so therefore you
[50:59] actually have a haughty spirit coming
[51:01] expressing itself in you that you
[51:03] actually by some token of uh your
[51:06] abilities or whatever you would feel
[51:08] like you were more spiritual and and uh
[51:11] drawn closer and yet we have to remember
[51:13] brother branham makes emphasis of this
[51:15] and i don't want to sign track but he
[51:17] tells you i'm just your brother a sinner
[51:20] saved by grace
[51:22] a prophet to an age
[51:24] is able to come and express it that i am
[51:28] just a sinner
[51:29] saved by grace then the prophet because
[51:32] we know those who knew him personally
[51:34] and we know that he didn't then go out
[51:36] the door and act all haughty to the
[51:38] people
[51:39] in fact so much he quit the ministry for
[51:42] a season because he had lost his love
[51:44] for the people and instead of uh coming
[51:47] as a um oh what am i trying to say uh
[51:50] instead of coming as a um
[51:53] oh my
[51:54] you know a false representation that's
[51:57] not the word but you know instead of
[51:59] coming and camouflaging that he just
[52:01] said i'd rather step away
[52:03] hypocrite
[52:04] yes i'd rather step away i'd rather just
[52:06] not even enter the pulpit because i've
[52:08] lost my love
[52:10] for the people
[52:12] so you have to be authentic
[52:16] don't you love it when you go to the
[52:18] freezer case in the grocery store
[52:20] and you buy something that is heated up
[52:22] in the microwave in tin foil
[52:25] and it says it's authentic italian
[52:28] authentic mexican authentic what
[52:31] no my brother and sister authentic
[52:32] doesn't come in the deep freeze at the
[52:34] grocery store
[52:36] but you see in the world we have there's
[52:38] idea that it can be authentic if we say
[52:41] it is
[52:43] but when put to the test
[52:47] if it's not authentic it will not taste
[52:49] the same
[52:51] when we were in arizona my son kept
[52:53] asking me have you ate a taco wagon
[52:56] and i said no but we went over here to
[52:58] such and such and he's like
[53:01] it's not real
[53:05] the real
[53:08] is the family
[53:10] now we'll get into politics we don't
[53:12] know they should be here or not
[53:14] but they're the ones that you know six
[53:15] months ago were living in a village in
[53:17] mexico their food's authentic
[53:22] the one
[53:23] with all the added ingredients
[53:25] not authentic
[53:27] and so
[53:29] samuel's indictment of soul he said you
[53:32] know back in the days when you were
[53:34] little
[53:36] in your own sight see he didn't say in
[53:38] my sight or their sight or this person's
[53:41] sight but when you were little in your
[53:43] own sight when you still walked under
[53:46] that anointing that i am a sinner saved
[53:49] by grace
[53:51] the god is in control of my life and you
[53:53] walked in that and you were little in
[53:55] your own sight and your opinion of
[53:57] yourself was i'm not worthy
[54:00] now the devil can anoint us to take that
[54:03] i'm not worthy and drive us spiritually
[54:05] into the ground with that but remember
[54:07] saints god would not have called you
[54:09] just reading question and answer this
[54:11] individual you remember the quote you
[54:13] know brother branham i grew up in sin
[54:15] and and you know lived a life of sin and
[54:17] then i come to the lord but i have
[54:19] fallen in sin again and i have a devil
[54:23] in me can i be restored
[54:26] does brother branham read a riot act of
[54:28] well you know i don't know a penance
[54:30] crawl on your knees do this do that he
[54:32] says no
[54:34] if there's a desire in you
[54:36] to be restored god is still with you
[54:41] so never let the devil try to beat you
[54:43] down while you're here desiring to serve
[54:47] him the prophet has shown us very
[54:49] clearly that god is still with you and
[54:52] so saul was taken
[54:54] and given great responsibility
[54:57] uh lifted up into high places
[55:00] and the scripture says in verse 18 that
[55:03] the lord sent thee on a journey now my
[55:06] brother and sister when you look at this
[55:07] if we're not careful we'll start turning
[55:10] serving the lord from a journey into a
[55:12] job
[55:16] i have to
[55:22] reminds me one time of dealing with the
[55:24] situation i won't go into any details
[55:26] but a brother being dealt with over a
[55:29] circumstance
[55:32] and i remember it struck me in the heart
[55:34] and stayed with me through all these
[55:36] years he says i guess i'll repent if i
[55:38] have to
[55:41] let us not be the reason you repent
[55:45] don't let it be the preacher preaching
[55:47] that causes you to repent let it be the
[55:50] holy spirit anointing you
[55:52] let it be the spirit of christ coming
[55:54] down into our life that softens us and
[55:57] says you know what my opinion of myself
[56:00] i was right i was right i know i'm right
[56:03] let her opinion come and say there is
[56:05] none right but our lord jesus christ
[56:08] and in that we will find that we've
[56:10] lowered our opinion of ourself and
[56:12] realized without the blood of jesus
[56:14] christ we are on a path to hell
[56:18] boy i'll tell you what when you remember
[56:20] that your opinion of yourself can't get
[56:21] too great
[56:24] and so it's there samuel tells him when
[56:26] you were little in your sight when your
[56:28] opinion of yourself
[56:31] was was humbled
[56:33] you were give responsibilities
[56:35] you were lifted up into high places and
[56:37] made a king over all of israel
[56:42] and i set you on a journey
[56:52] i can't find in this scripture where god
[56:54] says you know what witness
[56:56] when your bonus is not in jeopardy
[57:02] and if you find yourself constrained not
[57:04] to witness that's the leadership of the
[57:06] holy spirit right we don't throw the
[57:07] pearl before the swine
[57:09] i'm not talking about that realm but
[57:11] when the door and the atmosphere is
[57:13] correct and you find yourself
[57:14] constrained
[57:15] from sharing the gospel of jesus christ
[57:18] you've turned your journey into a job
[57:23] and we look at this
[57:28] he says go and utterly destroy the
[57:30] sinners the amalekites
[57:32] now i didn't say go give them a word
[57:34] test saints
[57:36] come on
[57:38] bear with me here
[57:40] he's not talking about that devil
[57:44] out here
[57:47] and you're going to just kind of sort
[57:48] i'm not talking about people don't
[57:50] misunderstand me talking about the
[57:52] spirits of the day they don't don't
[57:54] compromise with that devil don't make a
[57:56] trust a truce or whatever with him amen
[58:00] i want you to go and utterly destroy the
[58:02] sinners the amalekites and fight against
[58:04] them until they
[58:07] consumed
[58:11] not corralled
[58:14] not put as it were
[58:16] in prison
[58:19] until they be consumed
[58:21] see not just a one-time effort saints
[58:24] young people please listen to me for a
[58:26] moment
[58:27] we live in a day that you are offered
[58:29] everything at your fingertips
[58:32] when i was a child there was all kinds
[58:34] of adult content
[58:37] but people had to go or somebody else
[58:39] bought it and it was somewhere might be
[58:41] in a house or this that and the other
[58:43] but now any person with a phone that has
[58:45] the internet
[58:47] can reach into everything good or evil
[58:51] reading a story about a family that when
[58:54] they're when their child just kind of
[58:56] went totally off the rails and they're
[58:58] like what has happened to our son and at
[59:00] the point that they finally looked into
[59:02] their son's phone they found all kinds
[59:05] of content about devil worship satanic
[59:08] worship
[59:10] and then they started following that and
[59:11] he had been delving into that for a
[59:13] couple years and then it come to
[59:15] manifestation
[59:18] so we're not here just to fight a
[59:20] one-time fight
[59:22] not just a one-time effort to overcome
[59:24] but he said right here you fight against
[59:27] them until they be consumed
[59:30] until they have been vanquished
[59:34] not fight until we're weary
[59:38] any of you ever wake up just as tired as
[59:40] you went to bed
[59:43] we'll say well my back hurt me i did
[59:45] this most the time it's demons it's
[59:48] spirits
[59:49] in your sleep you're in warfare
[59:52] and you wake up tired
[59:55] don't just fight them until you're weary
[59:59] i've talked to individuals and i asked
[1:00:02] them point blank because i figured i had
[1:00:03] nothing to lose why have you quit
[1:00:06] you're still living a good life you're
[1:00:07] you're not uh you know criticizing the
[1:00:10] message you just get and they're just
[1:00:12] we're so weary we've just gave up
[1:00:17] good
[1:00:18] it's in that weariness
[1:00:20] that we should cry out to the lord
[1:00:23] now i want to just interject this at
[1:00:25] this point
[1:00:26] the scripture says
[1:00:29] when you come nigh unto me
[1:00:32] i will come nigh
[1:00:34] unto you
[1:00:37] now listen to me young people especially
[1:00:39] i want this connect with you this
[1:00:40] morning when you feel like you've come
[1:00:42] to the end that is the time for you to
[1:00:46] cry out to the lord
[1:00:48] oh i'll serve the lord if i'm still able
[1:00:50] when i'm 16
[1:00:52] or 18 or 20 when you are 8 10 12 14
[1:00:57] whatever the age might be and you've
[1:00:58] come to the place you don't know what is
[1:01:01] right as it were in your mind and what
[1:01:02] is wrong that's the time to lift a hand
[1:01:05] and lift a heart and cry out to the lord
[1:01:08] because he promised in that season i
[1:01:11] will come nigh unto you
[1:01:16] young man said well i don't know
[1:01:19] my parents are godly people i
[1:01:21] acknowledge this my aunt and uncle godly
[1:01:23] people and i think it was another uncle
[1:01:25] that was a pastor of church he's a godly
[1:01:27] person and then it's like why then
[1:01:30] and he said well
[1:01:32] i just never ever felt the presence of
[1:01:34] god
[1:01:36] you know we mostly do we recoil like oh
[1:01:39] my what did we do wrong he's never felt
[1:01:41] the presence of god but i'm telling you
[1:01:43] my brother and sister the season is
[1:01:44] changing the spirit is changing
[1:01:49] you fight
[1:01:50] until the amalekites
[1:01:53] are consumed
[1:01:56] we don't fight until we're weary we
[1:01:58] don't fight
[1:01:59] on convenience
[1:02:01] we fight until those spirits are
[1:02:04] consumed now my brother and sister
[1:02:08] look at the contrast as it were of
[1:02:10] opinion
[1:02:11] now opinion on webster's online it says
[1:02:14] a belief judgment or way of thinking
[1:02:16] about something what someone thinks
[1:02:18] about a particular thing
[1:02:20] anybody have an opinion
[1:02:23] how many of you brought us to church
[1:02:24] today
[1:02:26] oh come on now
[1:02:28] any of you don't lift your hand
[1:02:31] is not telling the truth
[1:02:34] you like your opinion enough you take it
[1:02:36] with you everywhere you go
[1:02:42] and as one man said if you actually
[1:02:44] don't have an opinion you don't have
[1:02:45] much
[1:02:53] advice from someone with special
[1:02:55] knowledge oh come on
[1:02:57] get over here into the spiritual realm
[1:02:59] my brother and sister did you know god's
[1:03:01] got an opinion
[1:03:03] he expressed it right here he didn't
[1:03:06] keep it a secret we're not guessing amen
[1:03:09] what is this advice from someone with a
[1:03:11] special knowledge advice from an expert
[1:03:16] amen
[1:03:17] he learned
[1:03:20] by the things
[1:03:21] he suffered
[1:03:24] and the scripture says he suffered
[1:03:26] everything that will ever suffer
[1:03:28] so therefore under this context 20
[1:03:31] because you see my brother and sister
[1:03:34] we're coming now to an expression of
[1:03:36] opinion because uh samuel has given the
[1:03:39] indictment to saul that when you were of
[1:03:41] low opinion of yourself i raised you up
[1:03:44] and i made you speaking for god i made
[1:03:46] you the king over israel but when you
[1:03:49] become lifted up you have taken a
[1:03:51] different path you become disobedient
[1:03:53] you're not and we'll touch on this in a
[1:03:55] little bit just slightly but you're not
[1:03:57] hearkening to me
[1:04:01] imagine
[1:04:02] my brother and sister we can sit in the
[1:04:04] day that we live in with the promise of
[1:04:06] a revealed word and people say i'm not
[1:04:08] hearing from god
[1:04:14] had a man tell me one time he said i
[1:04:16] don't believe this message is real
[1:04:19] and i'm like why don't you believe it's
[1:04:20] real and he says because
[1:04:22] the churches aren't hearing from god
[1:04:25] i was floored
[1:04:27] i was floored what do you mean the
[1:04:28] churches are not hearing from god
[1:04:31] there's deliverance over here there's
[1:04:33] deliverance over here there's healing
[1:04:35] over here there is repentance over here
[1:04:37] i see god moving everywhere i look and
[1:04:40] people saying we're not hearing from god
[1:04:43] no let's get it right down i am not
[1:04:45] going to become part of your excuse if
[1:04:47] you're not hearing from god it's not my
[1:04:50] fault
[1:04:51] sounds kind of brutal and blunt doesn't
[1:04:53] it
[1:04:54] but you see if it is then your salvation
[1:04:56] is dependent
[1:04:58] on me
[1:05:00] god never set it up that way
[1:05:02] your salvation is dependent on you
[1:05:08] hallelujah
[1:05:10] reminds me one time a brother sharing
[1:05:11] his testimony how he got saved
[1:05:13] and he said i was in a a little meeting
[1:05:16] he said the preacher was just like the
[1:05:18] worst preacher you ever heard he he kept
[1:05:20] mumbling and he kept backtracking and he
[1:05:22] wasn't giving very clear thoughts but at
[1:05:24] the end of the service that preacher
[1:05:26] stood there and said if you want
[1:05:28] salvation god is here come now and get
[1:05:31] it and he said i felt a power like i
[1:05:34] never felt in my life took me to the
[1:05:36] altar i repented got filled with the
[1:05:38] holy ghost and have lived a godly life
[1:05:40] and now have a godly family
[1:05:43] and he said that brother
[1:05:45] still
[1:05:46] mumbles his words
[1:05:48] and backtracks
[1:05:50] and loses his train of thought
[1:05:52] i remember i told the brother at that
[1:05:54] time i said there's hope for me as a
[1:05:55] preacher
[1:05:58] but you see
[1:05:59] it's not about that preacher
[1:06:02] that brother's final call is if you want
[1:06:04] salvation you want deliverance it's here
[1:06:08] come and get it
[1:06:09] now i say this my brother and sister i'm
[1:06:11] trying to break this habit of picking on
[1:06:13] people but you guys noticed sister jerry
[1:06:15] didn't move to the back row she moved to
[1:06:16] the front and you all think i throw her
[1:06:19] under the bus
[1:06:20] hallelujah
[1:06:24] but look my brother and sister
[1:06:27] when the holy ghost comes down and
[1:06:28] starts to move
[1:06:30] would it be necessary but sean will use
[1:06:32] you for an example would it be necessary
[1:06:34] knowing that at his age in the season of
[1:06:36] his life that brother sean needs a
[1:06:38] deeper experience with the lord and
[1:06:39] would it be my responsibility as a
[1:06:41] minister to come grab him and he's like
[1:06:44] no i don't want to go and i couldn't
[1:06:45] drag him because he's bigger than me but
[1:06:47] anyway you know and the preachers say no
[1:06:49] you're going to be
[1:06:50] delivered today and drag him to the old
[1:06:53] he's not going to get nothing
[1:06:56] but when the holy spirit comes down and
[1:06:58] moves upon his heart and stirs him i
[1:06:59] could have had the most convoluted
[1:07:01] sermon of the day and stumbled over
[1:07:03] myself and god stirred that heart and
[1:07:06] he's gonna find what he's searching for
[1:07:09] but no we we're getting so much into
[1:07:11] form and formality
[1:07:13] we're getting us so much oh i just
[1:07:14] didn't feel the moving of the spirit
[1:07:16] today i'm sorry you didn't come prayed
[1:07:18] up
[1:07:22] oh i'm not abusing you i'm loving on
[1:07:24] your saints
[1:07:26] amen but look at this difference of
[1:07:29] opinion verse 20
[1:07:31] and uh please put that up mason
[1:07:36] see
[1:07:37] he's saying
[1:07:38] that you you guys did all this you did
[1:07:40] what i told you
[1:07:42] god told you not to do and so now
[1:07:45] expressing see he had the right free
[1:07:46] moral agency he's expressing this and he
[1:07:48] says saul said unto samuel yea
[1:07:52] i
[1:07:53] have obeyed the voice of the lord
[1:07:56] here's god's prophet telling him you're
[1:07:58] wrong you've done wrong
[1:08:00] and he's coming back with an opinion
[1:08:03] yay
[1:08:04] i
[1:08:06] in my elevated position of what i
[1:08:08] believe is representation of the message
[1:08:11] of the hour am a true believer of this
[1:08:14] message
[1:08:17] i have obeyed the voice of the lord and
[1:08:19] have gone the way which the lord sent me
[1:08:22] and have brought aegok the king
[1:08:26] of amalek
[1:08:27] and have utterly destroyed the
[1:08:28] amalekites
[1:08:30] but is this true we look in the
[1:08:31] scripture
[1:08:35] he just lied
[1:08:37] but if you ask him did you lie he'll say
[1:08:39] no
[1:08:40] no i've done right
[1:08:42] i've done what the lord asked me to do i
[1:08:44] i'm living the message
[1:08:48] but it's producing something entirely
[1:08:49] contrary
[1:08:51] something that doesn't line up now i'm
[1:08:53] making emphasis of the saints because i
[1:08:55] want you to catch this and this is as
[1:08:57] much an indictment to ministry as it is
[1:08:59] to people but it's here look at this now
[1:09:02] uh look i i brought aegon the king
[1:09:07] wait he's an amalekite
[1:09:09] he should be dead
[1:09:17] oh
[1:09:19] come on saints
[1:09:21] i'm not pointing at people i'm pointing
[1:09:23] at spirits
[1:09:24] people come in
[1:09:26] they bring spirits in with them that are
[1:09:29] just as wicked as ago that's right
[1:09:33] and we're like oh he's a brother in the
[1:09:34] message with a different opinion
[1:09:42] there's only one opinion
[1:09:45] only one opinion
[1:09:47] that's the opinion of our lord jesus
[1:09:49] christ
[1:09:50] amen
[1:09:52] hallelujah
[1:09:56] see
[1:09:57] he's now speaking as it is
[1:10:00] telling
[1:10:00] samuel you're wrong samuel you realize
[1:10:03] that's what he's saying in expressing
[1:10:05] this opinion he's actually telling
[1:10:08] samuel what god laid on your heart to
[1:10:10] speak to me is wrong you know what that
[1:10:12] means he's saying go wrong
[1:10:15] and we have so many isms of systems
[1:10:17] around the message saints and many of
[1:10:19] them contrary to the word of god
[1:10:23] and they stand on that what they don't
[1:10:25] realize is they're not just agreeing
[1:10:26] with you
[1:10:27] they're not disagreeing with the prophet
[1:10:30] they're disagreeing
[1:10:31] with god
[1:10:34] see how clever how slippery
[1:10:36] the serpent is in the day that we live
[1:10:38] in and be so close to deceive the very
[1:10:40] elect he's coming in there saying now
[1:10:42] look we have an opinion of what the
[1:10:44] prophet meant about this
[1:10:46] but there is only one word
[1:10:48] amen
[1:10:50] so you come see now samuel it's contrary
[1:10:52] to your opinion uh we have subdued them
[1:10:56] we have we have conquered them and i
[1:10:59] brought the king back he's now uh uh
[1:11:02] under my subjection uh you know
[1:11:04] subjected to me
[1:11:05] we have seduted them they're no longer a
[1:11:07] threat to us and yes we brought back a
[1:11:10] lot of cattle a lot of gold a lot of
[1:11:12] silver we did a lot of things here and
[1:11:15] uh but this is good but the word subdued
[1:11:18] saints look at this to get control of
[1:11:21] a violent or dangerous person or group
[1:11:25] by using force punishment etcetera
[1:11:30] to get control of something
[1:11:32] such as a strong emotion
[1:11:34] to conquer and bring into subjection
[1:11:37] vanquish
[1:11:38] to bring a control especially by
[1:11:40] exertion of the will
[1:11:42] to curb
[1:11:44] to bring land under cultivation
[1:11:47] to reduce the intensity or degree of to
[1:11:50] tone down
[1:11:54] synonym is conquer
[1:11:56] now i want you to think about this my
[1:11:58] brother and sister he had a word of the
[1:12:00] lord to go and utterly destroy the
[1:12:02] amalekites
[1:12:04] in his mind because the king is now
[1:12:06] subject to him and they are now in
[1:12:09] control of the many riches and
[1:12:11] possessions of the amalekites he feels
[1:12:13] like he's conquered that but my brother
[1:12:15] and sister you and i know well today i
[1:12:18] speak this very bluntly to you you and i
[1:12:21] know that the thorn in your problem is
[1:12:24] is that we don't kill again
[1:12:27] we don't kill him we take him prisoner
[1:12:29] and we say well as long as i'm prayed up
[1:12:31] the devil ain't gonna bother me and
[1:12:34] you'll come to the day the stress of
[1:12:36] life brings you to a place and you are
[1:12:38] there and you don't get prayed through
[1:12:40] on that day and you think it might take
[1:12:42] days weeks months and years to conquer
[1:12:44] that it'll take days weeks months and
[1:12:46] years to come back no it can take a mere
[1:12:49] minutes mere minutes to come back
[1:12:56] reminds me of a story i read once where
[1:12:58] a man was locked in an old-fashioned
[1:13:00] jail
[1:13:01] they were going to hang him
[1:13:03] and he asks him he says hey look i'm
[1:13:05] going to die can you give me just even a
[1:13:07] little knife just a little short bladed
[1:13:09] knife and some wood so i can carve i
[1:13:12] like to carve and and they're like yeah
[1:13:14] that's no problem
[1:13:16] so he just carved a key to his cell
[1:13:22] that's the devil my brother and sister
[1:13:23] we give him the tools
[1:13:28] to get out of jail and come bother us
[1:13:33] well praise the lord
[1:13:34] am i making sense
[1:13:36] i hope so most of you didn't say a word
[1:13:39] i wonder
[1:13:42] soul doesn't kill a gag
[1:13:43] professional courtesy you know that
[1:13:45] that's what it was again begged for his
[1:13:48] life
[1:13:49] and said i'll serve you and i'll give
[1:13:50] ransom to you i'll even give you of my
[1:13:52] wives and of my children for servants
[1:13:55] i'll do all of this if you don't kill me
[1:14:00] i'll give you a promotion
[1:14:02] a nicer house nicer cars vacation cabin
[1:14:07] on and on it goes
[1:14:10] see he begged
[1:14:14] and i want you to see this spirit my
[1:14:16] brother and sister make a short
[1:14:17] comparison here
[1:14:19] this man in the tombs
[1:14:22] those spirits knew who jesus christ was
[1:14:25] and they didn't say oh my goodness we're
[1:14:27] going to fight we're going to line up
[1:14:28] we're going to fight you you know what
[1:14:29] they did they begged for their life
[1:14:32] another egg coming
[1:14:34] they beg for their life don't don't
[1:14:36] don't don't do away with us hey let us
[1:14:38] go over here into the pigs
[1:14:41] but you see jesus knew they were
[1:14:42] vanquished he knew that they were
[1:14:44] conquered and that spirit that was on
[1:14:45] them then was given permission you see
[1:14:47] they didn't take that liberty they were
[1:14:49] given permission but they went over here
[1:14:51] in the swine and then god anointed the
[1:14:53] swine to go and jump off the cliff into
[1:14:55] the sea
[1:14:58] but for a moment they thought they had
[1:14:59] liberty they thought they'd got what
[1:15:00] they wanted
[1:15:02] you see my brother and sister we're not
[1:15:03] here oh i hope you understand this i'm
[1:15:05] not speaking this contrary to scripture
[1:15:07] we're not here just to bind spirits
[1:15:10] that's right
[1:15:11] you know there's been many a person
[1:15:12] coming to church
[1:15:15] and minister before he comes out or
[1:15:16] maybe even during the deal bind those
[1:15:18] spirits
[1:15:20] but that person walks out with the same
[1:15:21] exact spirit on them
[1:15:23] we're not looking saints just to bind
[1:15:25] spirits we're looking for deliverance
[1:15:27] complete absolute deliverance from these
[1:15:30] spirits
[1:15:31] and if you've been binding a spirit in
[1:15:33] your life lord my temper my this my that
[1:15:36] lord i'm binding i'm binding it i want
[1:15:38] you to stop binding it and i want you to
[1:15:40] utterly destroy it
[1:15:42] i don't want you to have to get up every
[1:15:43] day lord oh help me not to tell a lie
[1:15:46] today
[1:15:48] get delivered from that spirit
[1:15:53] now why
[1:15:57] maybe the purging was too messy
[1:16:01] now some of you will misunderstand me
[1:16:02] today but that's fine i'm ready to deal
[1:16:04] with it
[1:16:06] when's the last time
[1:16:08] some of you
[1:16:10] prayed through to the point
[1:16:13] you were wiping the snot off your face
[1:16:15] with a sleeve
[1:16:17] or a kleenex
[1:16:20] when was the last time you reached a
[1:16:22] point
[1:16:23] you forgot about everybody else in this
[1:16:26] building
[1:16:30] saints could it be that the spirit of
[1:16:32] the cold formal
[1:16:34] has worked its way in
[1:16:38] we're no longer
[1:16:40] willing
[1:16:44] could we call that food for thought
[1:16:47] but some of you promise you'll go home
[1:16:49] and actually think about it
[1:16:51] you see the thing is saint satan is so
[1:16:53] slippery he'd come and in our heart
[1:16:55] we're like oh lord that
[1:16:57] brother paul's preaching he's right he's
[1:16:59] right and we walk out and in five hours
[1:17:02] we don't remember even what was on us
[1:17:07] what are we doing
[1:17:09] binding it for
[1:17:10] well jerry said i couldn't get this
[1:17:12] preached in a certain amount of time so
[1:17:14] she might be right
[1:17:19] because we're already there
[1:17:24] maybe the purging
[1:17:25] is too messy for us
[1:17:31] i don't know
[1:17:32] trustees maybe we need to
[1:17:35] instead of getting just little boxes of
[1:17:36] kleenox kleenex around here maybe we
[1:17:38] need to get some
[1:17:40] full-size brother jewels sized towels
[1:17:45] maybe we need to come to the place
[1:17:46] saints that we won't just try to bind
[1:17:48] the spirit
[1:17:50] but we'll actually get desperate enough
[1:17:52] to pursue complete absolute
[1:17:56] deliverance
[1:17:59] why are you picking on us brother paul
[1:18:02] probably for the same reason that samuel
[1:18:04] was picking on saul
[1:18:07] because it's a word of the lord
[1:18:10] not even a single amen
[1:18:14] but look what happens here my brother
[1:18:16] and sister
[1:18:18] but by example of ministry
[1:18:20] oh god help me saint you forgive me i
[1:18:23] think there's times i have not been the
[1:18:24] correct example to you
[1:18:27] god forgive me you forgive me but you
[1:18:29] see it was by the example of the king
[1:18:32] here he is saul he has now brought home
[1:18:36] what he
[1:18:37] called booty or treasure which was egg
[1:18:42] and the people looked and said oh
[1:18:44] god said destroy it all but our pastor
[1:18:49] but our pastor
[1:18:51] look what he's doing
[1:18:53] it'll be all right
[1:18:55] he's doing it
[1:18:57] the prophet of god said stick with your
[1:18:59] pastor he's ordained to lead you through
[1:19:03] so then you look at me
[1:19:06] and as i study this my heart cringes
[1:19:08] like oh god forgive me if i haven't been
[1:19:10] the right kind of example
[1:19:13] but because of the example of saul then
[1:19:15] the people then fell upon all the booty
[1:19:19] all of the gold all the silver all the
[1:19:21] cattle and they justified it look yes i
[1:19:24] did take the amalekite's gold but i paid
[1:19:26] tithe on it
[1:19:33] is that what the lord told them
[1:19:39] yay i've obeyed it
[1:19:42] i like this it's a world we live in
[1:19:45] it's all through it right back on you
[1:19:47] church
[1:19:48] i mean
[1:19:49] his people
[1:19:52] well hallelujah the way the church
[1:19:54] dresses it's not my fault they made they
[1:19:56] chose to wear that no they're watching
[1:19:59] these movies and they're doing this and
[1:20:01] you know they were over here at the you
[1:20:02] know deal you know and i find myself
[1:20:05] constraining myself so i don't offend
[1:20:06] any of you
[1:20:12] do you believe we can have an opinion
[1:20:13] and still be all right
[1:20:19] you won't find a christmas tree in my
[1:20:21] house
[1:20:24] i already know some of you have a
[1:20:25] christmas tree am i going to preach
[1:20:26] against it no and don't think i am right
[1:20:28] now
[1:20:29] i'm just telling you
[1:20:31] god gives us
[1:20:32] the ability to have an opinion amen
[1:20:37] come on are you with me
[1:20:39] all of you have a christmas tree forgive
[1:20:41] me
[1:20:43] no i'm serious i don't need joking
[1:20:45] forgive me i'm not preaching against you
[1:20:47] but i'm telling you i look at the word
[1:20:49] of god i look at these things
[1:20:51] and the difference is i have a
[1:20:53] granddaughter lives in my home but i no
[1:20:55] longer have children to justify the
[1:20:57] prophet saying we do this for the
[1:20:58] kiddies
[1:21:00] you see where paul's at
[1:21:02] i don't have any babies i don't have any
[1:21:04] kitties
[1:21:07] therefore i can't justify
[1:21:10] boy i just dampened this spirit here
[1:21:12] i just killed this thing
[1:21:15] dead
[1:21:17] but you see i want to drive home saints
[1:21:20] how opinions fall that's right
[1:21:22] and you would look at this when i say
[1:21:24] you i don't mean anybody in particular
[1:21:26] you look at this and say brother brown
[1:21:27] said you know
[1:21:33] you're justified
[1:21:35] do it for your children
[1:21:39] 75 years old justified we're still doing
[1:21:42] it for the children
[1:21:44] come on saints
[1:21:46] but i want you to understand where
[1:21:48] opinion
[1:21:49] unless it's absolute
[1:21:51] is only
[1:21:52] opinion
[1:21:54] and many of you right now thinking
[1:21:55] brother paul we have a christmas tree
[1:21:58] and that's your opinion and i say god
[1:22:00] bless you amen praise the lord
[1:22:02] hallelujah
[1:22:04] amen are you with me
[1:22:06] okay those of you have a tree you're not
[1:22:08] offended no don't raise your hands
[1:22:12] but you see what happened saints i
[1:22:14] wanted to use something that startling
[1:22:16] and to make my position as a pastor to
[1:22:19] tell you where i stand on this
[1:22:22] and you are free to take your opinion
[1:22:28] do i use that or not lord
[1:22:32] now we'll pass it over
[1:22:34] i think that's clear enough
[1:22:36] but see what saul does
[1:22:38] he throws it back on the people
[1:22:42] all the sin that's in israel now all the
[1:22:44] sin that's in the camp it was the people
[1:22:46] that took the spoil the sheep and the
[1:22:48] oxen and the chief of those things that
[1:22:49] had been utterly oh oh yes and we did it
[1:22:53] lord so we could sacrifice to you
[1:22:57] i transgressed the word of god
[1:23:00] direct commandment of god i transgress
[1:23:03] that so i could bring as i said earlier
[1:23:06] and pay tithe on all the gold that got
[1:23:08] off the amalekites
[1:23:11] see they couldn't fathom the idea that
[1:23:12] god wanted them just to leave all of the
[1:23:15] things of laodicea
[1:23:17] just laying there
[1:23:19] otherwise it's like well praise the lord
[1:23:23] i i
[1:23:24] that wouldn't hurt what was that guy's
[1:23:26] name
[1:23:27] got up in the morning went out into war
[1:23:30] and he came home
[1:23:32] and um caused his wife and his children
[1:23:36] to die
[1:23:37] anybody remember who he is
[1:23:41] i wanted to hear a little louder out of
[1:23:42] you saints
[1:23:44] yeah
[1:23:45] we don't want to be an aiken
[1:23:47] an unintentional consequence on his wife
[1:23:50] and children now look his wife didn't go
[1:23:53] out there she wasn't picking up
[1:23:54] babylonian garments come on this sounds
[1:23:56] a little crass but she wasn't going
[1:23:58] through the racks at macy's
[1:24:01] oh
[1:24:02] if i sow a little something in here and
[1:24:04] i do a little of that it'll be oh no no
[1:24:06] no no no no no it was a priest of the
[1:24:08] home it was a leadership it was the man
[1:24:12] who should have been saying you know
[1:24:14] what god said don't take anything out of
[1:24:18] laodicea i want you to live in my word
[1:24:21] for the hour and it is not a laodicean
[1:24:24] word it's an eternal word
[1:24:30] unintended consequences
[1:24:35] i never pronounce it right well i'm just
[1:24:37] going to go on we'll preach that another
[1:24:39] day
[1:24:40] look look what happened
[1:24:42] they justify this we're going to
[1:24:44] sacrifice this to the lord at gilgal
[1:24:48] but you see they never killed the
[1:24:49] influence of laodicea
[1:24:53] you know it's funny how these things
[1:24:54] work saints i hope you don't mind we'll
[1:24:55] be a little long today
[1:24:58] now i find it remarkable and i have
[1:24:59] compassion because i was that boy
[1:25:02] but you see these young people pulling
[1:25:03] out of the church parking lot
[1:25:09] and then nothing
[1:25:13] they forgot where they were at
[1:25:16] i was that boy
[1:25:19] i was that young man
[1:25:22] locked my truck
[1:25:24] parents
[1:25:26] as much as i as a pastor would have
[1:25:28] permission or could give permission
[1:25:30] i give you permission
[1:25:32] to do a police style search on your
[1:25:34] children's vehicles
[1:25:38] oh my
[1:25:39] no young people are like amen
[1:25:42] but you see what happens is i learned
[1:25:44] mom and dad cannot look
[1:25:46] at what's under the sea behind the seat
[1:25:48] in the glove box if it's locked
[1:25:51] oh but our children are serving the lord
[1:25:53] that's what my parents thought too
[1:25:58] we don't trust the devil
[1:26:02] see so what happened was as he brings
[1:26:05] back ag
[1:26:07] and then the people
[1:26:09] he throws it off on the people isn't
[1:26:10] that the spirit of the age
[1:26:13] you know we know and and we're going to
[1:26:15] start working towards these things and
[1:26:16] this is a little blunt and some of you
[1:26:17] are probably like oh oh my goodness
[1:26:19] what's brother paul doing he went nuts
[1:26:21] but my brother and sister let it be
[1:26:22] known that there's nowhere in the word
[1:26:25] of god for our young people to be out
[1:26:26] behind the head smooching on each other
[1:26:29] there's no place in the word of god for
[1:26:31] our young people justify behavior that
[1:26:34] resembles the world and you know what
[1:26:37] i'm going to stand here as a witness and
[1:26:39] i'm going to testify this to you some
[1:26:41] parents might not like it some children
[1:26:43] might not like it some elders might not
[1:26:45] like it but you'll never stand before
[1:26:47] god that day and say we didn't know amen
[1:26:51] hallelujah
[1:26:52] so they're thinking they can give an
[1:26:54] offering in exchange for their
[1:26:55] compromise amen now look my brother and
[1:26:57] sister the prophet of god shows us in
[1:27:00] the message that the make believer will
[1:27:03] be more zealous than even the real
[1:27:06] believer
[1:27:07] and so here it is the real believer
[1:27:10] struggling the make-believer has now
[1:27:12] garnered of the things of the amalekites
[1:27:15] and he paid tithe on it he made an
[1:27:18] offering to the lord and everybody
[1:27:20] rejoiced and they sang and they danced
[1:27:22] around the offering of a bullock that
[1:27:24] should have been dead in the field and
[1:27:26] left behind a rot
[1:27:28] and they everybody's like oh look at
[1:27:30] this family look at that family they
[1:27:31] provided a whole oxford sacrifice my
[1:27:34] brother and sister was a filthy offering
[1:27:36] it was a dirty offering they were
[1:27:38] offering to god but people looked at
[1:27:40] their zealousness and said wow they are
[1:27:43] so spiritual and it is there my brother
[1:27:45] and sister god wants you to bring an
[1:27:48] offering that is consecrated sanctified
[1:27:52] glorified that he can come then and pour
[1:27:55] his glory out upon that offering
[1:27:57] he's not looking for a filthy offering
[1:27:59] because of its size
[1:28:06] look
[1:28:08] zealousness will never replace obedience
[1:28:12] samuel said verse 22 have the lord as
[1:28:16] great delight in burned offerings and
[1:28:18] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[1:28:21] the lord
[1:28:23] you realize you could be a family of
[1:28:25] very very tight means
[1:28:29] and there would be talk of we're going
[1:28:30] to do this in the church and you'd say
[1:28:31] man i want to give up i'd like to give
[1:28:33] an offering
[1:28:34] and you give an offering and you go away
[1:28:36] thinking lord i didn't give much
[1:28:38] go right back to the temple saints one
[1:28:41] might
[1:28:42] one might given
[1:28:44] in the right spirit in the right
[1:28:45] attitude will outweigh
[1:28:48] all riches
[1:28:50] but if god has blessed you such
[1:28:53] and you felt led
[1:28:54] and let's just say you threw in all the
[1:28:56] shackles
[1:28:58] you see god knows your heart too
[1:29:03] now he said have the lord great delight
[1:29:05] and burn offerings but to obey is better
[1:29:07] than sacrifice and to hearken to listen
[1:29:11] is better than the fat of rant
[1:29:14] see now look here oh
[1:29:16] can i have some time saints
[1:29:18] amen
[1:29:21] the rebellion is the sin of witchcraft
[1:29:23] and stubbornness is as iniquity and
[1:29:25] idolatry because thou hast rejected the
[1:29:27] word of the lord he has also rejected
[1:29:30] thee from being king
[1:29:31] look what happened to saul he lost
[1:29:34] a god-given position
[1:29:40] we'd say well but predestination
[1:29:42] no my brother and sister
[1:29:44] you'll find remember that man in the
[1:29:45] garage
[1:29:47] brother brown tells a story and the man
[1:29:48] tells a young boy go get me some beer
[1:29:51] god didn't let that man slide off into
[1:29:54] sin and debauchery god cooked his life
[1:29:57] lit circumstances it was the story is
[1:29:59] they never found nothing wrong with that
[1:30:01] car lift
[1:30:03] why did it come down and crush him and
[1:30:05] kill him
[1:30:07] because god wasn't going to let him
[1:30:10] just slide off
[1:30:12] so i say that you say why'd you put that
[1:30:15] in there brother paul because i don't
[1:30:16] want you to think that god's going to
[1:30:17] give you an exemption card
[1:30:20] god's given you truth
[1:30:22] amen he doesn't have any exemption cards
[1:30:25] now look
[1:30:26] he lost his god-given position satan
[1:30:28] knows if he can get you to compromise on
[1:30:31] the
[1:30:33] live word
[1:30:33] compromised life
[1:30:35] okay don't feel judged if this touches
[1:30:37] your life today but if you can stop
[1:30:40] right now and think about things in your
[1:30:42] life
[1:30:43] that you know
[1:30:44] is not right
[1:30:47] most of you won't do it
[1:30:50] but the prophet of god
[1:30:52] tells us about iniquity
[1:30:54] i know i shouldn't do this
[1:30:57] but i do it anyhow
[1:31:00] to us
[1:31:01] that is counted as unbelief
[1:31:06] see
[1:31:07] a compromised life is never able to get
[1:31:10] the full power of the revelation of the
[1:31:12] word
[1:31:14] you can receive healing and live a
[1:31:15] compromised life
[1:31:17] i could share with you a story that goes
[1:31:19] back in time a few years to see how god
[1:31:22] would move and before people could
[1:31:24] receive their healing they end up
[1:31:26] standing in front of a minister in front
[1:31:29] of the church not me i was witness to it
[1:31:31] and confessing faults that would burn
[1:31:33] the hair off your eyebrows
[1:31:37] but they sought the will of god more
[1:31:39] than hiding their own sin
[1:31:42] they come to a stage in their life that
[1:31:45] coming in the perfect will of god was
[1:31:47] more important than even their own pride
[1:31:49] and and being shamed as it were by their
[1:31:51] life
[1:31:53] see
[1:31:55] satan doesn't have to turn you into a
[1:31:58] drunk saints i want you to get this
[1:32:00] people have this idea oh my the devil's
[1:32:02] trying to no no
[1:32:04] if you just compromise on the word
[1:32:06] causes you to live a compromised life
[1:32:08] causes you to remove yourself
[1:32:13] amen
[1:32:14] from your god-given position
[1:32:17] and the devil's outside the door crying
[1:32:20] because we're saying the devil made me
[1:32:21] do it the devil made me do it
[1:32:23] do you know the devil met never made you
[1:32:25] do one thing
[1:32:28] brother random said
[1:32:30] that before eve could dis or could
[1:32:32] receive the false word i won't have the
[1:32:35] exact words but
[1:32:36] before eve could receive that she had to
[1:32:38] have rejected the word of god that's
[1:32:40] right amen so she herself put herself
[1:32:43] out there to be deceived
[1:32:46] see
[1:32:47] so we remove ourselves from our
[1:32:49] god-given position now listen to this
[1:32:51] satan cannot compromise your life
[1:32:55] hear me now you may be struggling young
[1:32:57] people you may be struggling with music
[1:32:59] and and young men and young women
[1:33:01] adoring you or acting like they are
[1:33:03] anyway all of these things see satan
[1:33:05] cannot compromise your life all he can
[1:33:08] do is influence and offer opportunity
[1:33:13] and so he influences
[1:33:16] and offers opportunity
[1:33:17] but he can't force you
[1:33:20] to compromise
[1:33:22] you see when we compromise
[1:33:24] we've already let go
[1:33:26] of something in the word
[1:33:29] we've already let go of a promise
[1:33:30] promised to us before we can actually
[1:33:34] compromise
[1:33:40] i remember one time
[1:33:41] years and years and years ago i used to
[1:33:43] as a young man before i was married i
[1:33:45] used to go to a fitness center and
[1:33:48] my motives were probably wrong i just
[1:33:50] wanted to ride a dirt bike faster and
[1:33:52] further
[1:33:54] but they had what they called adult
[1:33:55] monkey bars
[1:33:57] now we have monkey bars well it's now in
[1:33:59] isaac and kristen yard
[1:34:00] you know the kids are up there i mean
[1:34:02] we've done our best break arms and
[1:34:05] sprain things for you give your kids
[1:34:07] opportunity to fall off on their head
[1:34:09] and snap their arms and whatever else i
[1:34:11] mean we feel happy to offer that to you
[1:34:14] but if you've ever my brother and sister
[1:34:17] been on an adult set of monkey bars
[1:34:20] you know the little crossbars they're
[1:34:21] not this far apart
[1:34:23] they're like six feet
[1:34:25] and when you start on this end you are a
[1:34:28] hundred percent committed
[1:34:32] or it'll only be your fingertips that
[1:34:34] touch the promise
[1:34:36] are you with me
[1:34:38] a hundred percent
[1:34:40] you've launched yourself
[1:34:42] off of that vertical bar down here
[1:34:45] launch yourself at the first bar you
[1:34:48] grab it you don't hesitate you swing
[1:34:50] every bit of might and power you have in
[1:34:52] your body and let go remember oh oh come
[1:34:56] on come on are you with me
[1:34:57] you got to let go of the last to attain
[1:35:01] the future
[1:35:03] and you swing out there and you're
[1:35:05] literally in midair and then you get the
[1:35:07] next one and if you hesitate the least
[1:35:09] bit by bending your elbow or pulling
[1:35:11] back you'll never reach the next one
[1:35:14] you know at that fitness center they had
[1:35:16] to increase the thickness of the mat
[1:35:17] underneath that thing after they
[1:35:18] installed it because guys were acting
[1:35:20] like brother titus
[1:35:22] they were crashing and burning right and
[1:35:23] left and guys were walking out of the
[1:35:25] fitness center with arms taped to their
[1:35:27] chest and
[1:35:28] did they get rid of the monkey bar no
[1:35:30] they put up a sign and says
[1:35:32] if you're not ready for this stay off
[1:35:36] amen could we put a sign up here if
[1:35:38] you're not ready to make a rapture maybe
[1:35:40] it'd be time for you just to pull back a
[1:35:42] little
[1:35:44] or
[1:35:46] prepare yourself
[1:35:49] prepare yourself make yourself ready
[1:35:53] and the lamb's wife
[1:35:55] have thought
[1:35:56] about the rapture
[1:35:59] now what does it say somebody tell me
[1:36:03] made herself
[1:36:05] ready
[1:36:07] see look at this
[1:36:09] oh my let me keep going now look there's
[1:36:11] two times in the bible that we have this
[1:36:14] statement in direct context both of them
[1:36:16] are in uh the book of revelation and the
[1:36:19] first one is in revelation 1 4
[1:36:22] amen and john to the seven churches
[1:36:24] which are in asia grace be unto you and
[1:36:26] peace from him which is and which was
[1:36:29] which is to come and from the seven
[1:36:31] spirits which are before his throne and
[1:36:33] from jesus christ who is the faithful
[1:36:36] witness and the first begotten of the
[1:36:37] dead and the prince of kings of the
[1:36:39] earth unto him that loved us and washed
[1:36:42] us from our sins in his own blood can
[1:36:44] someone say amen hallelujah and
[1:36:47] thought about making
[1:36:49] knows her half that's past tense and
[1:36:52] action past tense and half made us kings
[1:36:56] and priests unto god and his father to
[1:36:58] him be glory and dominion forever and
[1:37:01] ever
[1:37:02] now look i want to back up i've covered
[1:37:04] more ground here than i intended some
[1:37:06] things i cut out i still preach it to
[1:37:08] you i'm sorry but look at this now what
[1:37:10] happens in the end of our scripture in
[1:37:12] samuel is samuel says to them
[1:37:16] you're no longer king
[1:37:18] you've lost your position
[1:37:21] right god's no longer
[1:37:23] embraced you
[1:37:26] now we look at this my brother and
[1:37:28] sister we unders do we have a correct
[1:37:29] understanding of predestination
[1:37:32] amen it's not well i made god unhappy
[1:37:34] today i guess i'm out no sir
[1:37:37] no sir
[1:37:38] he bought you with his blood
[1:37:40] and the value there's no measurable
[1:37:42] intrinsic value to his blood you can't
[1:37:44] put a number to it
[1:37:47] so look at this now and hath made us
[1:37:50] kings and priests unto god and his
[1:37:51] father to him be glory and dominion
[1:37:53] forever and ever now we'll go on to
[1:37:55] revelations 5
[1:37:57] and i saw on the right hand of him that
[1:37:58] said on the throne a book written within
[1:38:00] and on the back side sealed with seven
[1:38:02] seals and i saw a strong angel
[1:38:04] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[1:38:06] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[1:38:08] seals thereof and no man in heaven nor
[1:38:11] in earth
[1:38:12] neither under the earth was able to open
[1:38:14] the book neither to look there on now
[1:38:16] john's weeping
[1:38:19] there's two sides of this saints john
[1:38:20] weeping
[1:38:22] john's weeping one he recognized in
[1:38:25] himself
[1:38:26] he wasn't worthy
[1:38:28] to handle that precious precious word
[1:38:33] he had no authority
[1:38:37] and he was also weeping because of all
[1:38:39] salvation and redemption of man
[1:38:41] was contained
[1:38:43] right there and if it was never opened
[1:38:48] redemption
[1:38:49] in its fullness
[1:38:51] would never come that's right and i'm
[1:38:53] not batting at something so nobody think
[1:38:55] of that but when people sit and say the
[1:38:57] seventh seal is closed
[1:39:00] you know what they're actually saying
[1:39:02] there is no redemption
[1:39:05] for us
[1:39:08] that is a spirit from the pits of hell
[1:39:10] that would try to take your redemption
[1:39:13] back
[1:39:15] and hold it
[1:39:17] hostage
[1:39:18] see the type
[1:39:20] saul was supposed to conquer a guy
[1:39:24] not hold him for ransom
[1:39:27] you'll see the anointing of that my
[1:39:28] brother and sister there are ministries
[1:39:31] that want to take the revealed life of
[1:39:34] the word and hold it hostage
[1:39:38] and dole out little portions to you
[1:39:41] no sir the scripture said and he hath
[1:39:45] opened
[1:39:46] the seventh seal
[1:39:48] redemption has been poured out to you
[1:39:50] and
[1:39:51] amen hallelujah that ought to make us so
[1:39:54] happy we'd jump up and ran around this
[1:39:56] church amen
[1:39:58] oh
[1:39:59] who's worthy to open loose the seals and
[1:40:01] no man in heaven nor on earth nor under
[1:40:02] the earth was able to open the book
[1:40:04] neither to look there on and i wept much
[1:40:06] because no man was found worthy to open
[1:40:08] and read the book neither to look
[1:40:10] thereon and one of the elders saith unto
[1:40:13] me
[1:40:15] bride
[1:40:16] of the laodicean age

[1:40:20] we've not your lamb
[1:40:23] hallelujah
[1:40:26] your lamb has prevailed
[1:40:29] we're not in a day here with no hope and
[1:40:32] no future but the lamb has prevailed
[1:40:36] hallelujah
[1:40:38] oh hallelujah i'm sorry
[1:40:40] i think i just feel like john i feel
[1:40:43] like weeping hallelujah

[1:40:46] has prevailed i have hope for my future
[1:40:49] i have hope for my children and my
[1:40:52] grandchildren i have hope for the church
[1:40:56] hallelujah
[1:40:57] [Music]
[1:40:59] oh
[1:41:00] weep not behold the lion of the tribe of
[1:41:02] judah the root of david hath prevailed
[1:41:06] now look this goes in a whole nother
[1:41:08] thing i pruned it all off but i'll just
[1:41:09] give you a little bit if christ is in
[1:41:12] you
[1:41:13] amen
[1:41:14] hallelujah
[1:41:16] hallelujah
[1:41:18] god in you the hope of glory
[1:41:20] only you know depending on how you word
[1:41:22] it in the message search there's only
[1:41:23] about you know about 400 accumulative
[1:41:26] quotes that talk about that amen god in
[1:41:29] you hallelujah what is that the
[1:41:32] revelation of the manifestation of jesus
[1:41:35] christ and the prophet of god says god
[1:41:38] could have expressed himself in the
[1:41:39] heavens he's going to express it over
[1:41:41] here he can express it over there but he
[1:41:43] chose to express it in you
[1:41:46] oh thank you lord
[1:41:49] thank you lord
[1:41:51] oh
[1:41:52] amen weep not
[1:41:54] the lion my lion your lion hath
[1:41:58] prevailed and then he identifies
[1:42:03] where this come from
[1:42:04] not just a lion
[1:42:06] but the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:42:08] the root of david
[1:42:11] hath prevailed open the book and to
[1:42:13] loose the seven seals thereof
[1:42:18] and i be held and low in the midst of
[1:42:20] the throne and the four beasts in the
[1:42:21] midst of the elders stood limb
[1:42:23] as it had been slain aren't you glad you
[1:42:25] can see the lamb
[1:42:27] having seven horns seven eyes which are
[1:42:29] the seven spirits of god sent forth into
[1:42:31] all the earth
[1:42:32] and he came and he took the book out of
[1:42:34] the right hand of him that set upon the
[1:42:35] throne and when he had taken the book
[1:42:37] the four beasts and four and twenty
[1:42:39] elders
[1:42:40] in
[1:42:40] reverence to the one who now possesses
[1:42:43] redemption
[1:42:46] you see this wasn't just some random act
[1:42:49] as it were oh wait this is the part
[1:42:51] where we have to fall down
[1:42:54] this was reverence
[1:42:56] this was something so sacred to them
[1:43:00] that they yielded submitted themselves
[1:43:03] in the true definition of submission
[1:43:11] hallelujah
[1:43:15] took the book amen
[1:43:18] from him was on the throne
[1:43:20] and when he took in the book the
[1:43:22] elders what is this in all saints do you
[1:43:25] realize when the lamb takes the book
[1:43:28] this
[1:43:29] is the full
[1:43:31] beginning
[1:43:33] midpoint
[1:43:34] ending
[1:43:36] of redemption
[1:43:40] see what the scripture said
[1:43:42] this work
[1:43:44] i've begun and you i had to stop halfway
[1:43:46] because of funding
[1:43:50] this work i have begun in you
[1:43:53] i
[1:43:54] will
[1:43:56] finish
[1:43:58] oh hallelujah
[1:44:00] oh i'm telling you that's why some
[1:44:02] elders fell down they're saying here it
[1:44:05] is here it is redemption has come
[1:44:11] hallelujah
[1:44:14] harpson
[1:44:16] your prayers
[1:44:18] don't worry about what the word says
[1:44:21] there in that fashion
[1:44:23] just catch that that's your prayers
[1:44:25] that's your prayers
[1:44:26] wait this happened before you were born
[1:44:31] you think god didn't know what you would
[1:44:32] pray you don't think he would know what
[1:44:35] was on your heart
[1:44:36] the desires of your heart
[1:44:39] oh hallelujah they sang a new song
[1:44:41] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[1:44:44] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[1:44:46] slain and house redeemed us to god by
[1:44:49] the blood out of every kindred tongue
[1:44:51] people and nation
[1:44:52] and here it is again i took the long
[1:44:54] route didn't i
[1:44:55] think how short my sermons would be if i
[1:44:57] just get to the point
[1:44:59] look at this
[1:45:00] and hast here again a past tense action
[1:45:05] made unto our god hallelujah my god is
[1:45:08] not the god of laodicea my god is not
[1:45:11] shiny with chrome wheels my god is not
[1:45:14] 5 000 square foot with a pool and this
[1:45:17] and that my god is ash in the bank my
[1:45:20] brother and sister he has made unto us
[1:45:23] our god kings and priests whoa and we're
[1:45:27] gonna reign
[1:45:28] i'll tell you there's nothing more than
[1:45:30] i want to do is to be in that position
[1:45:32] to stand there and to reign
[1:45:35] oh sounds like a power hungry person no
[1:45:37] sir because when you get to that point
[1:45:39] you're going to have true humility
[1:45:43] you're going to have true wisdom and
[1:45:44] true judgment
[1:45:46] and a true heart
[1:45:48] and god would say you know what esther i
[1:45:51] give you
[1:45:52] to the half of my kingdom unless
[1:45:55] unless esther
[1:45:58] i don't like what you're doing
[1:46:00] no sir why
[1:46:02] god knew what his pride would be
[1:46:05] he knew the beauty and wisdom and
[1:46:07] judgment of his bride
[1:46:09] and i say today there's no greater
[1:46:12] no greater position
[1:46:14] than to have a wife
[1:46:16] i don't have my wallet on me but
[1:46:18] figuratively
[1:46:19] saints and i'm glad i can say this is my
[1:46:21] life
[1:46:22] no greater position for a man
[1:46:25] than to take the possession of his life
[1:46:28] amen
[1:46:30] do you catch that
[1:46:31] the possession of his life amen
[1:46:36] and give it amen to his wife amen
[1:46:39] hallelujah yeah that's right
[1:46:42] oh i'm a christian jesus died for me
[1:46:44] i i i believe in christ we sit in a
[1:46:47] restaurant in phoenix heard a man
[1:46:49] make that kind of confession and it
[1:46:51] broke my heart oh yes i'm a christian
[1:46:53] too i uh um you know believe uh uh yeah
[1:46:57] that jesus died for me
[1:47:02] total no sincerity
[1:47:05] but you see when you've come in that
[1:47:06] position right there
[1:47:10] your heart just melts that's right
[1:47:12] he has made me
[1:47:15] he's made me a king and a priest
[1:47:19] and i'm going to reign don't you
[1:47:20] recognize reigning is not just power my
[1:47:23] brother and sister it's who you are
[1:47:26] reigning with
[1:47:27] their relationship is not to have power
[1:47:30] over nature power over heavens and earth
[1:47:33] all of this it is who we are reading
[1:47:36] with
[1:47:38] oh hallelujah
[1:47:41] oh praise the lord
[1:47:43] hallelujah
[1:47:46] look at this
[1:47:49] one little compromise on saul's part
[1:47:52] brought compromise to the whole body
[1:47:54] amen
[1:47:55] if paul hitched i mean saul had stood
[1:47:58] before israel that day and this gave you
[1:48:01] might say a short sermon
[1:48:03] on the direction
[1:48:05] and the leadership in the word of god
[1:48:07] if you wonder why i'm killing this king
[1:48:10] it's because it was thus saith
[1:48:14] the lord amen amen
[1:48:16] and he struck him down
[1:48:19] didn't hire a minion to do it
[1:48:21] god told saul to do it
[1:48:24] and then the rest of israel looked up
[1:48:26] and said well the rest of that prophecy
[1:48:28] was is that we take nothing
[1:48:32] we compromise on
[1:48:34] nothing
[1:48:36] we don't take second position on nothing
[1:48:40] and our sacrifice
[1:48:42] measured to us by the
[1:48:44] word is by our obedience
[1:48:49] and god said that there was greater
[1:48:52] than the offering of the oxen the
[1:48:55] bullock
[1:48:56] all of this
[1:48:57] greater than the tithe aiken
[1:49:05] i already asked you once and i feel bad
[1:49:06] can i have just a moment or two more
[1:49:11] this one little compromise on saul's
[1:49:13] part you see
[1:49:17] however you notice saints
[1:49:21] have you ever noticed
[1:49:24] we don't usually listen to someone else
[1:49:27] when we come short of the glory of god
[1:49:30] we fall down on our face and it was just
[1:49:32] a little bump
[1:49:34] and as christians we should view that
[1:49:36] like that
[1:49:43] you know brother so-and-so and i had a
[1:49:45] disagreement
[1:49:48] and i know oh brother trevor i'm sorry i
[1:49:49] just killed myself
[1:49:51] brother trevor and i have a disagreement
[1:49:53] the holy spirit moves on me and i know i
[1:49:55] should go apologize to brother trevor
[1:49:59] and if i will just reach over you know
[1:50:01] because all of us are so far from our
[1:50:02] phones now
[1:50:06] i'll reach over and dial bro trevor's
[1:50:08] number and say brother trevor i don't
[1:50:09] care if you were at fault for a little
[1:50:12] portion of this the holy spirit's laid
[1:50:13] on my heart
[1:50:14] i am sorry
[1:50:16] oh god right
[1:50:18] brother trevor goes to bed that night
[1:50:20] praise the lord
[1:50:21] praise the lord because you know what
[1:50:23] happens when that happens
[1:50:25] if you're dealing with a real christian
[1:50:26] they're going to be going oh no no
[1:50:27] brother it was my fault
[1:50:29] and then you get in a fight over whose
[1:50:30] fault it is
[1:50:34] but give it 24 hours
[1:50:36] how much more resistance there is
[1:50:39] 48 hours
[1:50:41] 72 hours
[1:50:43] a week
[1:50:44] a month
[1:50:46] and pretty soon we have built a fort
[1:50:50] around something that could have been
[1:50:52] dealt with
[1:50:53] so easy
[1:50:55] so easy it could just be between you and
[1:50:58] the lord you don't even have to make a
[1:51:00] phone call
[1:51:03] the longer it goes the greater the
[1:51:05] resistance
[1:51:07] that's why the prophet of god told us
[1:51:09] and the holy spirit speaks to you do it
[1:51:12] do it
[1:51:13] yes now look at this oh please i've got
[1:51:16] to finish
[1:51:20] you see
[1:51:22] it is in our opinion what is little
[1:51:27] maybe i should have named this sermon
[1:51:29] just opinions
[1:51:32] but you see in
[1:51:33] our opinion it's what's little you know
[1:51:36] you can devastate someone
[1:51:38] and walk away and say well i didn't i
[1:51:40] didn't say anything that horse
[1:51:43] only by your opinion
[1:51:46] see by our opinion we declare what's big
[1:51:49] and little
[1:51:50] now this might seem as a silly analogy
[1:51:52] but it actually come to me while i was
[1:51:53] studying and and sitting there thinking
[1:51:55] upon these things and i i just come to
[1:51:57] me and it's like that that's his you
[1:51:59] know we play volleyball around this
[1:52:00] church a little bit don't we
[1:52:03] and you know we we stretch out our rope
[1:52:05] and that's our boundary come on saints
[1:52:08] i've watched some of you
[1:52:09] i think i might even have participated
[1:52:12] but we'll forget about that part it was
[1:52:13] you
[1:52:16] the ball
[1:52:22] it's out no it's in i saw it i was right
[1:52:25] here it is in
[1:52:28] stop prophet said examine your motives
[1:52:31] you're not going to see somebody on my
[1:52:33] team that's going to get a point going
[1:52:35] it's out
[1:52:37] it's out
[1:52:38] no sir we're going to get a point
[1:52:40] it's my benefit
[1:52:44] the rope jumped
[1:52:45] that was your foot
[1:52:47] i saw it as good as you did no you're
[1:52:50] wrong i've got four eyes i see better
[1:52:52] than
[1:52:56] you but you know what's the true mark of
[1:52:59] judgment
[1:53:01] when it could benefit you
[1:53:04] and you would say
[1:53:05] it's out
[1:53:08] but isn't that come on saints i've
[1:53:09] watched you
[1:53:12] i don't see this judgmentally i just say
[1:53:14] this because it's our nature we're human
[1:53:17] and it's going to benefit me it's out
[1:53:20] it's going to benefit me it's him
[1:53:24] we're all biased
[1:53:27] i listened to this lady the other day
[1:53:29] making a speech
[1:53:33] all white people are biased
[1:53:37] i'm
[1:53:38] sorry okay
[1:53:42] okay fine
[1:53:44] but i happen to know
[1:53:47] we were all made in the image of god
[1:53:52] a red mist mustang
[1:53:54] is no different
[1:53:56] than a white one
[1:53:59] and on and on we can go
[1:54:02] see what's happened saints is we have to
[1:54:04] be careful
[1:54:05] that our opinion
[1:54:07] does not put us in a position
[1:54:10] because you see what saul thought was
[1:54:11] little
[1:54:13] what we think is little
[1:54:17] and as prophet says
[1:54:19] you're wrong
[1:54:21] and saul says
[1:54:23] i did the will of god
[1:54:24] i did the word of god i did all that god
[1:54:27] led me to do you know brother branham
[1:54:29] said
[1:54:30] god will never lead you away from his
[1:54:32] word
[1:54:35] so god does not double-minded doesn't
[1:54:37] have two opinions
[1:54:39] you see so what saul was actually doing
[1:54:42] under an anointing so much greater than
[1:54:45] he recognized he was denying god's voice
[1:54:48] to him in that day saying that's not
[1:54:51] true not true not true not true
[1:54:54] hallelujah
[1:54:57] okay
[1:54:58] now
[1:55:00] brother chris brother david i think all
[1:55:02] of us all three of us can say amen to
[1:55:04] this wouldn't it be easier for me just
[1:55:06] to tolerate when and go ahead and say oh
[1:55:08] well i'll compromise on this i'll come i
[1:55:11] i i'm not made out of that no sir when
[1:55:14] it's the word
[1:55:15] it's the word
[1:55:18] come on saints don't feel sorry for the
[1:55:19] preacher
[1:55:20] but i want to tell you i have suffered
[1:55:22] for this uh i i oh if i preach this
[1:55:24] it'll affect this family affect this
[1:55:26] family affect my family
[1:55:29] we'll just
[1:55:30] skip around
[1:55:33] these things
[1:55:35] come on
[1:55:40] in my opinion it won't hurt
[1:55:48] not being judgmental
[1:55:51] jerry and i was in the grocery store
[1:55:54] and here is a mennonite family
[1:55:58] lovely looking man and woman
[1:56:00] probably 50.
[1:56:04] and i thought oh they look nice
[1:56:08] but their daughter then come out of one
[1:56:10] of the aisles met up with him
[1:56:14] and she totally squashed
[1:56:17] holiness
[1:56:20] underneath her
[1:56:21] foot
[1:56:24] do you see how easy saints that our
[1:56:25] representation to the world is
[1:56:29] or walk
[1:56:31] i don't want to damage it so i won't
[1:56:33] imitate or walk
[1:56:36] but when you think about what the
[1:56:37] prophet of god talked about how they
[1:56:38] would walk
[1:56:39] men sing
[1:56:41] and i was like oh my
[1:56:42] oh my
[1:56:44] seemed like a nice girl
[1:56:46] i mean me an old man getting all droopy
[1:56:48] and wrinkled and going bald she smiled
[1:56:50] at me
[1:56:51] she has to be a nice girl
[1:56:53] but what are we projecting
[1:56:56] what are we what are we giving out
[1:56:58] what is the world seeing when they look
[1:57:00] at us
[1:57:02] and it'd be so easy to compromise
[1:57:06] you know here recently i preached about
[1:57:07] some things and i'm have no doubt in my
[1:57:09] mind that some of you went ouch and some
[1:57:11] maybe you said mind your own business
[1:57:14] but you see saints there comes a time we
[1:57:16] can
[1:57:17] only compromise so long
[1:57:20] before the spirit of god would leave us
[1:57:24] when it's the word
[1:57:26] it's the word
[1:57:28] god help us can someone say amen god
[1:57:31] help us to stand for that thing which is
[1:57:34] true yes sir it would be fine sure you'd
[1:57:37] get more pats on the back
[1:57:42] come on here come on church let's just
[1:57:44] form a line
[1:57:46] i tell you you're all going in a rapture
[1:57:48] you're all going to make it you don't
[1:57:49] have to do nothing it's all settled live
[1:57:52] how you want
[1:57:54] ah thank you brother paul thank you
[1:57:56] brother thank you
[1:57:57] now we'll get along here in just a
[1:57:59] minute and i'll show you what tie this
[1:58:01] together get more pats on the back but
[1:58:04] what i will i do standing there that day
[1:58:07] when bony fingers point in my face you
[1:58:10] know better but you failed
[1:58:13] to tell us
[1:58:17] sounds crass and uncaring saints but i
[1:58:19] don't plan on being the man
[1:58:22] that has a bony finger
[1:58:24] pointed in his face and said you knew
[1:58:25] what you didn't tell us
[1:58:27] i'd rather you be mildly offended at me
[1:58:31] for preaching so direct you know what
[1:58:33] spurgeon said he said you're not
[1:58:35] preaching the gospel unless you are
[1:58:37] offending the people
[1:58:40] how would you like to have spurgeon for
[1:58:41] a pastor
[1:58:43] my he'd whoop on us until we were all
[1:58:45] dizzy
[1:58:46] yeah
[1:58:48] come on
[1:58:49] you know better but you failed to tell
[1:58:51] us who
[1:58:52] no
[1:58:53] i'll be like paul i have not shunned to
[1:58:56] declare to you
[1:58:58] the whole council of god no man's blood
[1:59:02] is upon me let it go where it may be
[1:59:04] that's true god knows it he backs it up
[1:59:07] and says it's the truth
[1:59:09] oh saint you see i'm not here to pick on
[1:59:12] you
[1:59:12] it might make some of you scared
[1:59:16] come on it might make some of you scared
[1:59:17] some of you would cringe because paul's
[1:59:19] willing to say it and some of you would
[1:59:21] cringe because i did say it
[1:59:24] but i say this now i'm gonna embarrass
[1:59:25] somebody but i'm just gonna make this
[1:59:26] point and drive it home the other day
[1:59:28] sister carrie sister sarah standing
[1:59:30] there and i just caught a snippet of a
[1:59:32] conversation this was at thanksgiving
[1:59:34] and i just kind of butted in you know
[1:59:36] how i do that and um i i just there and
[1:59:39] they're talking and i said you know this
[1:59:40] is how i feel about it and sister sarah
[1:59:42] sister kerry would know and i said this
[1:59:44] is where it's at in the right context in
[1:59:46] the right spirit the right attitude and
[1:59:49] i said sister sarah i love you as much
[1:59:52] as i love anyone on the face of this
[1:59:53] earth now some people be oh my goodness
[1:59:55] that's so forward is there something
[1:59:56] weird going on there with oh my god no
[1:59:59] no what it is
[2:00:01] is something inside of me so real i look
[2:00:03] at you
[2:00:05] i look at you and i say thank you lord
[2:00:09] thank you lord and answered a prayer
[2:00:10] years ago when i would pray every day
[2:00:13] lord let there be a church of people i
[2:00:16] could go to church with that would
[2:00:17] worship you and live the word and it
[2:00:20] wouldn't be of clicks and of groups and
[2:00:22] segregations and all of this let it be a
[2:00:25] church of true believers
[2:00:28] and i stand here today and i believe i
[2:00:30] can say god has answered that prayer
[2:00:33] and some of you say oh that's good you
[2:00:35] feel that way well come on the rest of
[2:00:36] you
[2:00:37] some of you probably get nervous brother
[2:00:39] paul got in your face and said i love
[2:00:40] you so much
[2:00:42] oh what's going on with him
[2:00:44] well hallelujah i'll tell you what's
[2:00:45] going on with me
[2:00:47] i see the love of christ in you
[2:00:50] and i'm reciprocating
[2:00:52] back
[2:00:53] the love some of you embarrassed to say
[2:00:55] that
[2:00:56] that's fine i understand that
[2:00:58] i've embarrassed many of you
[2:01:01] look in you in the face and say i love
[2:01:02] you
[2:01:03] and i with humor get to see you sputter
[2:01:09] that's good
[2:01:10] i'm one of those guys you know the
[2:01:12] youngest in the family
[2:01:14] dysfunctional family wait you're all
[2:01:16] dysfunctional
[2:01:21] but something inside of me wants to
[2:01:23] express it
[2:01:24] i don't say you have to do that
[2:01:26] but look at this my brother and sister
[2:01:28] we come to this place
[2:01:30] where the love of jesus christ
[2:01:32] not carnal
[2:01:34] not lust of the flesh
[2:01:36] not distorted by the spirit of laodicea
[2:01:39] but the true spirit of christ
[2:01:43] oh hallelujah
[2:01:45] sister
[2:01:46] emmy would you come brother sean so i'll
[2:01:48] just be quiet notice the church is so
[2:01:51] carnal feeds itself on worldly karen
[2:01:54] dead things of the world just like the
[2:01:56] vulture does church politics hmm imagine
[2:01:59] that
[2:01:59] you think brother branham endorsed
[2:02:01] church politics
[2:02:02] i don't think so
[2:02:04] he called it karen called it vultures
[2:02:08] they don't let the holy ghost send a man
[2:02:10] to a church they have to have a politics
[2:02:12] and see if the denomination is going to
[2:02:14] receive him or not that's right they're
[2:02:16] like the world they dress like the world
[2:02:19] they look like the world they act like
[2:02:22] the war world
[2:02:25] they're vultures
[2:02:27] like the world
[2:02:29] they're lazy
[2:02:30] soft
[2:02:32] compromisers
[2:02:34] that's all there is to it
[2:02:36] did you ever see an eagle compromise
[2:02:39] no sir
[2:02:40] there's no compromising in him neither
[2:02:42] does a genuine christian he ain't soft
[2:02:46] he'll hunt
[2:02:47] till he finds it
[2:02:49] [Music]
[2:02:51] i could give you some examples of that
[2:02:53] but i believe you've got it
[2:02:55] amen
[2:02:56] he'll hunt till he finds it amen yes sir
[2:02:59] he'll find his meat he wants fresh manna
[2:03:02] he'll get down there and dig till he
[2:03:04] finds it he'll fly higher and higher and
[2:03:07] if there's none in this valley
[2:03:08] [Music]
[2:03:10] you know i was talking to a brother here
[2:03:12] recently and he was telling me he says
[2:03:13] well when we left our church he said i
[2:03:14] went ahead and left
[2:03:16] but the pastor
[2:03:17] dug up every quote there is
[2:03:19] to justify why he should never move from
[2:03:21] that church
[2:03:22] [Music]
[2:03:25] he said brother paul
[2:03:28] my family was already
[2:03:30] backslidden
[2:03:32] we just didn't know it yet
[2:03:36] we didn't even leave that church for the
[2:03:38] reasons that we recognize now
[2:03:43] maybe some of you
[2:03:44] blitz out of here because he used these
[2:03:47] words he says you know we were under a
[2:03:48] judgmental pastor
[2:03:51] am i judgmental
[2:03:53] somebody please say no
[2:03:58] [Music]
[2:04:03] but he said we were hungry this part i
[2:04:05] really want to emphasize we were hungry
[2:04:08] all
[2:04:09] the time
[2:04:11] [Music]
[2:04:13] and the pastor's like you're sinning if
[2:04:15] you leave here
[2:04:16] you can do this
[2:04:19] but he said
[2:04:20] we found ourselves
[2:04:24] we found ourselves i won't even go into
[2:04:25] all of
[2:04:26] we found ourselves and we knew it wasn't
[2:04:28] right
[2:04:29] [Music]
[2:04:30] this quote here makes me
[2:04:32] think about that
[2:04:35] he'll hunt till he finds it
[2:04:37] he'll find his meat he wants fresh manna
[2:04:39] he'll get down there and dig till he
[2:04:41] finds it he'll fly higher and higher
[2:04:43] if there's none in this church
[2:04:46] [Music]
[2:04:48] he'll rise a little higher
[2:04:51] come on saints we gotta we gotta rise
[2:04:53] with the time we gotta stand on the word
[2:04:56] for our hour and it is a quick powerful
[2:04:58] work the prophet of god said and when
[2:05:00] the satan comes in like a flood he would
[2:05:03] raise up a standard so the standard my
[2:05:05] brother and sister you can't tell me
[2:05:06] it's not coming in like a flood
[2:05:09] it's being poured out it's more wicked
[2:05:11] and wicked every day
[2:05:12] it's being poured out
[2:05:15] look we only thought we knew what the
[2:05:17] face of sodom was
[2:05:18] the higher you go the more
[2:05:22] you can see
[2:05:23] now look this sounds a little political
[2:05:25] forgive me we're closing
[2:05:29] everybody's saying
[2:05:30] they're dumbing down america
[2:05:32] they're dumbing down america they're
[2:05:34] dumbing down america oh we got to do
[2:05:36] something they're dumbing down america
[2:05:39] but prophecy said that's what it would
[2:05:41] be
[2:05:43] but this is what i want you to be
[2:05:44] careful of
[2:05:45] make sure you as the bride of christ
[2:05:47] are not being dumbed down
[2:05:51] amen
[2:05:53] come on
[2:05:54] this bride knows
[2:05:56] what food is
[2:05:58] she's not going to settle for just a
[2:06:00] little blip here and a little blip there
[2:06:02] she wants food
[2:06:05] she's hungry and she's gonna rise up and
[2:06:09] keep rising up until she in her soul
[2:06:12] which is predestinated before the
[2:06:14] foundation of the world is satisfied
[2:06:17] oh hallelujah
[2:06:20] amen none in this valley will rise a
[2:06:22] little higher the higher you go the more
[2:06:23] you can see so it's time is there any
[2:06:26] eagles here this morning
[2:06:28] so it's time for eagles of this day to
[2:06:30] get to flying higher and dig into god's
[2:06:34] promises
[2:06:35] not live on vulture food that's been
[2:06:37] killed years ago
[2:06:39] get out of it
[2:06:40] hallelujah
[2:06:42] get out of it saints you see my brother
[2:06:45] and sister this is what god wants us to
[2:06:48] come we don't want to oh
[2:06:51] [Music]
[2:06:57] brother so-and-so says
[2:06:59] [Music]
[2:07:02] that's good we should have a little
[2:07:03] respect and
[2:07:05] proper context honor
[2:07:07] for the ministry right
[2:07:10] just because brother so-and-so says it

[2:13:27] to go back for thirds
[2:13:30] really
[2:13:31] sisters it's actually a compliment
[2:13:36] and it was a compliment
[2:13:38] to the word of god to the bride of

[2:14:28] certain circumstances
[2:14:32] things i could not understand
[2:14:39] many times in trials
[2:14:43] weakness blurs my vision
[2:14:46] and my frustrations get so
[2:14:50] out of pace
[2:14:54] then i am reminded
[2:14:57] i've never been forsaken
[2:15:01] never had to stand one test alone
[2:15:07] when i look at all the victories
[2:15:11] the spirit rises up in me
[2:15:14] it's through the fire my weakness is
[2:15:18] made strong just worship the lord

[2:15:28] and the hill would not be hard to
[2:15:31] decline
[2:15:36] he never offered
[2:15:39] a victory without fighting but he said
[2:15:42] help would always come in time
[2:15:49] just remember
[2:15:50] when you're standing
[2:15:52] in the valley of decision
[2:15:56] and the

[2:16:09] and he will take you through the fire
[2:16:13] again
[2:16:15] [Music]

[2:16:22] perish
[2:16:23] if i trust the hand of god
[2:16:27] and shield the flames again
[2:16:32] he never promised
[2:16:35] that the cross would not get heavy
[2:16:39] it would not be hard to climb
[2:16:46] he never offered
[2:16:49] victories without fighting but he said
[2:16:52] help would all
[2:16:54] come in time
[2:16:59] just remember when you're standing
[2:17:02] in the valley of decision
[2:17:05] and the

[2:17:11] just hold on
[2:17:15] our lord will show up
[2:17:18] and he will take you through the fire
[2:17:22] again
[2:17:26] he never promised that the cross would
[2:17:30] not get heavy
[2:17:32] and the hill would not be hearted
[2:17:36] blind
[2:17:40] he never offered
[2:17:42] our victories without fighting but he
[2:17:45] said help would always come in time
[2:17:52] just remember when you're standing
[2:17:55] in the valley of decision
[2:17:59] and the
[2:17:59] adversary says given
