really matters foreign [Music] [Music] and your life will be safe [Music] when hold on his name and truly saints that is all that matters amen we can I just you know sometimes when you just pass along the compliment to the Lord it sounds like you're complimenting men but we would just add a scripture to the song service tonight we could dismiss because it truly is everything that was on my heart and uh even to the point of remembering brother Joshua and brother Mason going through some struggles going through a a valley going through a oh you know I remember I remember reading in one of those little history books his sister Sue bought me somebody asked this man who had been in the World War II in the war in Africa and he said what was the thing that was the most terrifying to you during the war and he said the most terrifying thing to me in the war was not being shot at was not the the artillery and not the charge of all of this but to be literally a few hundred miles from anywhere in the desert in Africa and he said I saw the absolute majesty and power of God in a sandstorm and he said it was so thick so dark and so so just destructive he said I was sure I was dying and he said in Warfare you don't think about it you just react but when you're sitting there huddled in a hole you've got nowhere to go and you realize it's just you and God he said that was my most terrifying moment and that was the point that when he came home he referred back to people say you got saved during the war yes just me and God in a little hole in the ground in the middle of the desert you know our brothers going through a struggle right now maybe others are too might be a terrifying time for them let's lift them up in prayer let's not forget them you know sometimes in those times you feel like it's just you alone and sometimes we need that amen let's stand I want to speak to you tonight and um you know I just uh will be my last opportunity and I don't know if we'll pick this up again I I hope tonight you can make continuity of my thoughts because I've had to set so many of them aside we're going to be gone for such a lengthy amount of time I don't know if I will be able to pick this back up again because um where those slots are other thoughts will take their place and so I hope tonight that that the things that I've cut out don't leave too big of a gap second Corinthians I want to speak to you tonight the war within and the war without and defeating the strongholds we have been given a promise my brother and sister and in that promise it's not for us to make the promise come to pass it's for us to rise in faith believing as we'll hopefully Lord willing be able to touch but believing as we walk forward you see how do I say this it's one thing to know you have a promise it's another that Satan would plant a thought that the promise is either going to fail you or you have failed the promise and so in that realm we will find ourselves constantly looking back to see is this taking place is this present and I hope tonight that we can just elaborate on that amen defeating the strongholds and uh my brother and sister I'll say tonight I believe each and every one of us maybe even still have some strongholds we need to defeat and anything that is a stronghold is a place where Satan has power and authority so it doesn't even have to be a besetting sin as it were it could be something very small you know Sister Jerry and I just to drive a point home sister Jerry and I are suffering from the consequence of our own lack of Prudence to deal with puncture Vine she's got one in her foot that she's been trying to soak and get it out and I've got one in the side of my foot that hurts the you know it's not even there still it's whatever residue and you see sometimes that's how Satan is he just comes and he goes leaves his poison that we have to deal with after the fact so it's not even necessarily you might say a besetting sin a moment that Satan uses to remind you of the failure in the past or a lack for the sake of time let's go to the word second Corinthians the 10th chapter verses one through seven very very uh uh common scripture to us and uh we just draw a little thought out of it tonight the Lord willing now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who in present embase among you but being absent and bold toward you but I beseech you that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence wherewith I think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh you know that's interesting because that Spirit has not left sometimes as ministers we preach in such a fashion and people feel like they've got a just a carnal Earthly motive for preaching that what most people don't realize is when you stand right here and you preach along those lines the very first heart that is Smitten by the word is the our own The Man Behind the platform I tell you there's been more than one time I've had to stop and say Lord Lord forgive me Lord forgive me and it seems like you're cutting at someone and the truth of it is is God's cutting at the preacher that's not the way I meant to say that but for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal I want to say that again I say it with emphasis for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty yes through God Amen that's what we've got to remember it's mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalt us itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ now I want to elaborate because we're not going to come back to that my brother and sister captivity is not where something has a choice captivity is bound so God says I'm going to bind these things that's going to uh uh the imaginations and high things that exalt themselves and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when our obedience is fulfilled do ye look on things after the outward appearance If any man trusts to himself that he is Christ let him of himself think this again that as he is Christ even so are we Christ amen so this is not for some preacher to say look I know I'm saved and I question you my brother and sister every one of us has a right to stand on the word and declare that we are saved that we are Sons and Daughters of God it is not to a single man it is not to an organization it is not to whatever but it is between you and I and when you have that experience and people say well I don't know about you can stand there and say look I've had my own backside of the desert amen let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your grace your mercy tonight and Lord so many thoughts swirling in my mind I pray father you just help me to remain focused Lord just be with the Saints Lord our brother Sergey somewhere in the country our brother vasili Lord no doubt the same out on the road somewhere with the family's father the Saints in the Ukraine and Russia Lord South America Africa wherever the bride of Christ is Father we just ask for your Holy Spirit to move and Lord lead us and guide us you've given us a promise father but somewhere along the line Lord we know we have to stand on that promise and not be moved from the promise and so I ask you father give us strength give us courage Lord give us understanding and revelation of of where we stand and the word is it's being opened in our day father Lord that we can stand here Lord and fulfill what you've called us to fulfill we ask these things in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen you may be seated as we would look through my brother and sister I'm I want to just take for a moment and touch back on some of these verses here for the weapons of our Warfare are no carnal but we my brother and sister in a body of Flesh have come and have to be under the anointing of the holy spirit because without that we turn everything into an issue of the flesh whether someone slighted us or offended us or ignored us but look at verse 5 it says casting down imaginations in every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and you know just going through this I hope you don't mind if I speak a little direct tonight but my brother and sister were living in a generation that a lot of things are dealing as a prophet of God taught us the greatest battle ever fought and one of the Realms that Satan is doing so well in is in the realm of thought or imagination and so it's there that Satan starts to work upon them we won't go into all of the eagle evil uh things that Satan would use concerning the imaginations but my brother and sister let us just bring it to the place that we would look into our own life and you can judge for yourself your circumstance you see when Satan starts to anoint an imagination it is there that things happen and people create their own realm they create their own thought they create their own atmosphere and it is in that realm that Satan comes in and starts to anoint the people and it's there that many times people would would uh do I I just listen to a little something that was brought to my attention the other day of a man he's he's on the internet out there and uh says he's and now the prophet in the message he's now the prophet for the age to carry the bride to a Rapture and he's been sending letters and different things to people to correct them to to get their churches in order and now if something goes wrong if he sent a letter and something goes wrong he's declaring that's the Judgment that came for people not following his teaching and I look at that and I think you know isn't that an interesting thing because my brother and sister we can all take some Avenue like that and Satan will come and actually bring that crazy kind of an idea and we will be here maybe a little internal struggle right the battle within and without but we can be in a little struggle and maybe we have issues that happen in our life you know the car won't start God's punishing me this comes over here oh it's God showing his disfavor what is that my brother and sister that's imaginations and it's coming to Captivate you to come now we're not doing you know me I don't preach this just love love love but we are living in the age of Grace my brother and sister and God does not come he is avengeful God but he's not a pentagon and he will never never never judge us until he's giving warning and if we our sons and daughters of God that's who I'm talking to tonight so God's giving warning to us but he doesn't do that by killing your car unless that's for your benefit not judgment benefit but you see Satan anoints us and people start getting ideas that these things happening in their life is because God is angry with them my brother and sister you know I shared that with you and I keep going to go look at them it was either Tozer Spurgeon you know says when we fall away there's not exact words when we fall away God Woos us back now sometimes wooing probably can be pretty Direct Amen in our human thinking we would think man that's not really wooing well my brother and sister I'll tell you God knows what he's doing we need to trust him and we need to come and follow the word and cast down the imaginations that pull us away from the word of God and cast down anything that wants to exalt itself over the word of God and we need to bring in captivity our thoughts amen it's there that Satan Works in that realm and people then start to do that oh I I think this and they start to entertain that and there's a lot of avenues that we could go into that tonight but I won't but look at this my brother and sister some of it can be very personal in life and satanic exalts that imagination anoints that imagination and you know I will bring this one thought up this happened a few years ago there was a man and a woman and it was there that they come they're married and they were fellowshipped around as families and whatever at the church and and it was there that they did that and he got an imagination that uh you know I'm not I didn't marry the right wife and she got an imagination now I wonder where that imagination come from then I didn't marry the right husband so they divorced their spouses and believing that this is the perfect one for them they divorce their spouses tear up their families and 13 months later realized they weren't the perfect couple now what have they done what was that and Imagination an anointing from Satan to look over as it were to lust after another man's wife to lust after another woman's husband but yet in their mind they were sure it was God that told them see how slippery the devil is that's a pretty strong imagination my brother and sister I hope that's not too strong for Wednesday night amen so look at this that we're doing here it's there that we need to come to a place that we bring captivity to our thoughts amen that will that will do a lot and I'll just put it this way you feel like you're not good enough to be a Son of God or a daughter of God cast down that imagination cast down that spirit that would try to convince you to convince yourself that you are not a part of the body of Christ cast that down amen because you see we're supposed to follow the word that's a whole other chapter I'd like to give you a little side note tonight if you don't mind just a lot of things have come across my plate in the last little bit here you know this to me is an interesting side note and one of the reasons that people around the message are increasingly rejecting it is that the message is not catering to the flesh the word of God said the things done in secret would be made known so when they come face to face with the product of their imagination they don't like it now my brother and sister I'm not talking about a preacher beating people up but when the word is preached and it comes back and Deals and comes before them again and again and again they have two options they can repent and come back to the Lord or they can exit with an excuse and let us all be honest tonight it's very face saving to exit with a good excuse not a feeble one but a good one and so when the word of God does not cater to the Flesh and look at the age look at the spirit in the land that we're living right now my brother and sister it's there you know just the craziness I won't even go into the details of it but just the craziness of what is taking a place across our nation right now and now we'd say there's got to be a safe place Idaho would be safe no it's not no the devil is everywhere and the spirit is there is everywhere and so more and more as the flesh rules the semi catch this the semi-spiritual man this is a man that will tell you I went to church with my grandma we go at Christmas and Easter and maybe a couple other holidays the semi-spiritual man probably in remembrance knows more scripture than you do anointed with an imagination that that made him spiritual now I am bringing you this a slightly different Avenue and you you can recognize that but you see look at the realm when a man comes and he believes that he is right and you are wrong this is why partly I chose the scripture there the Apostle Paul said hey if you think you're saved you have to include me because I am Christ also but look at how these Spirits are these spirits of imagination they always draw it you need to worship my way if you are going to make a rapture and what they're trying to do is cast upon the people a spirit that would cause them to look at their own life and say I'm not doing what he's doing and maybe that's the reason that I don't feel like an overcomer is because I need to go do this but my brother and sister that's not the answer the answer is a deeper consecration to the Lord It's a deeper sincerity it's a acting upon the word it's not just shifting directions and following someone else's teaching and so it's there as we see more and more the flesh is ruling the semi-spiritual man and so more and more to be seen uh versus the Unseen and we can turn these around because these do apply in opposites each one of these but it's more and more that people you know they say well if I can see it I'll believe it but my brother and sister that's not what the word says amen the word doesn't say you know I'm going to do that but then the word says I've given many infallible proofs so the evidence is to be seen but they're looking for something that was unseen are you with me and so it's there more and more the scene versus the Unseen you know must see to believe the unproven versus The Proven now my brother and sister you'd say what what do you want to bring there well I'm going to just keep this simple tonight my brother and sister people believe God's got given them favor another vain imagination that if they get rich that's God's favor and it's really strange because there's just Beyond accountability of people who have taken that position and become wealthy and they're convinced that was God and yet to flip that over when the proven is before them because it will not cater to the flesh they'll reject it what is this dying to oneself there comes your time my brother and sister and if you haven't already come there you will come there and that is that you will come and the difference of moving forward with God and stalling where you're at will come down what you will choose to do with your own flesh your own imagination your own knowledge what you decide to do with that will determine whether you move on or not you guys sure are quiet but you see Satan would twist it to his advantage you see he always knows which way to turn it he knows which way to present it now there was a man of war one time said something to this order these won't be the exact words this man of Wars said attack the enemy not only at their weakest point but also at their weakest time recognize what happens to you certain things in our life and because I've been dwelling on imagination a little something you know in our mind that we trouble or just keep fighting over and Satan can just sit and let you go for days weeks months maybe even years and then when the time is right he pounces and it's in that moment that many a man and many a woman has found themselves with the question mark even to the degree is their a god that's how effective Satan can bring bring them to a place is there a God see my brother and sister Satan's whole job I'm glad that God gave us the ability to recognize Satan's tactic in the Book of Job not in real deep tonight Saints just trying to stir us and remind us I'm glad I thank the Lord that God allowed us to see Revelation in the Book of Job and to see that what applied to job my brother's sister applies to us and God said go ahead I'm not worried about him I'm not worried he'll fail I'm not worried he'll give up so go ahead do everything but take his life and when God said that my brother and sister do you realize because eternal life resided in job it was almost as God was saying you can't take his life because that is eternal life that's an eternal seed in job and so you're going to fight against him you're going to war against his flesh you're going to give him friends that help his imagination of what he did wrong and what he has done right and friends that are going to give advice and wife that will be this and that and whatever but yet in the end God said I'm not concerned because I know who job is and job is mine and so that life that was there and I'm so thankful today my brother and sister that God gave us the understanding of that scripture and of that time and place that when things come what we think is a dead end it's pretty bleak stop my brother and sister and realize God would not let you through into this test if God had not provided the way out of this zest that he has already declared go ahead this is my faithful servant attack him I'll tell you otherwise we would sometimes and circumstances be just like why is God what's happening here it seems like the devil's beating me up but when we have that revelation we can stand and say yes sir you know I got purified ones amen they poured the gold off but there must still be some dross in me and God's turning the fire back up again amen anybody recognize the fire amen The Melting Pot the trial the Temptation the struggle and the flame gets what is it purifying a bride that she will be spotless on that day not some bride that's got that you know I don't know if any of you ever done that I used to do a lot of reloading we used to go collect the Lino type from the old style printing presses and and different things wheel weights and just anything that was led and and we would melt it down and then we would have to add I forget now even what it was but we added uh some stuff to it and all of that contamination in that lead would coagulate on the top and we would scrape it off and then you think oh it's ready to make bullets out of no it isn't you got to do it again three or four times Hallelujah three or four times well I've already been three or four times maybe not at that refiner fire maybe not at that level maybe God was just getting all the sticks and stones out first so you see how this comes about so as Satan tries to use this attacking us at our weakest point at the weakest time amen we would come and Satan uses it against us but my brother and sister God has given us a weapon and some of this I'm just paraphrasing not going through all the quotes because of time but you know just to look at what the prophet of God shows us here and Satan's got his weapon that he uses against us but God has given the bride of Christ her own weapon amen we're not sitting here uh powerless uh indefensible we're not setting here as weaklings my brother and sister he has made us Warriors amen he has taught us of the Warfare that matters not of Flesh and Blood not of carnal things but in the spiritual realm is where this Warfare matters and God has given us weapons that we can take and as Satan would come down and he bombards us with thoughts and I'm telling you it's a comfort to me when the prophet of God said that thought might enter your mind but your job is to make sure that it doesn't stop and make a nest and you'd say oh I can't be a very good Christian for a thought like that to pass through my mind my brother and sister all it is is for you is not to dwell on that but to cast it out and say that's not who I am nice try Satan nice try you know sometimes sometimes the enemy has such a incredible way that they work Once Upon a Time in World War II in Italy there was such a strong contingent of Italian and German soldiers that it seemed as though the Allied Army could not move forward it was a pretty Rapid River that they had in fact the rip River however you would say it in Italian was basically rapido very fast river flowing and almost like a channel across the country there they can't penetrate it they can't even get across the river somebody says why don't we make them come to us and they started shooting Cannon shells with pamphlets in them so when they hit the ground they just basically burst open and all these pamphlets they flew over Enemy Lines even had some planes shot down dropping canisters that broke open with pamphlets and the pamphlets were saying they're lying to you they're lying to you they're going to sacrifice you on the table and it's there they're doing this and and you think oh well they're soldiers they're trained soldiers they've been fighting they've been holding their own but then they're holding a pamphlet and they look around and realize those people that are leading them and telling them to go and die are living in Comfort actually eating with China and Crystal and whatever at night and it started to weigh upon the minds of the soldiers and they literally when the rainy season come we're living in foxholes or half full of water their feet were rotting off of their bodies but yet maybe inside a coat pocket they still had a pamphlet see the two-edged sword here go to use a cast off Bible in a trash can to catch a man's mind but Satan will also use a pamphlet of 101 reasons what you believe is wrong Warfare of the Mind it becomes so strong that entire uh uh platoons of Italian soldiers would March up with the rifles turned around and the breach open and hand them to him and say we want to surrender and then they told the German soldiers if they go to to surrender kill them instead the German soldiers walked with them and surrendered how effective this battle of the mind is but the word of God says that we would could should let me rephrase that could should have the mind of Christ how much more my brother and sister if we purge our mind of all of the negative that this world has right here and we get the mind of Christ and the Devil comes to assault us and we are there I hope you can follow this figuratively as we are there and the devil is assaulting us we're just taking those thoughts and brushing them away brushing them away you're not going to build the nest of those thoughts that are anti-word Antichrist in my mind but it doesn't stop Satan you can knock a thousand off and he'll come with a thousand and one Satan uses us against us but you know the true word of God and this is nothing new but the true word of God is our greatest weapon you see my brother and sister the reason I put the word through in there is many people take up a Bible and start to present ideas and try and make that this is what God's saying to you the true word of God will be the word that has come as it were through the fire and is unquenchable amen it is a fire in of itself and it has been tested it has been proven it has been Vindicated and you know what I hope you don't take this wrong I'm not even talking about brother branham's Ministry I'm talking about the experience that you have with Christ there's the thing people say well I knew it was wrong all along you know Saving Face a good excuse a good way out but my brother and sister I'll tell you what I know I know personally it's the truth I know personally that time after time God has dealt with me in things that my wife didn't even know about and so perfect to come down and touch upon those and change directions and change hearts and somebody's going to drop a pamphlet and expect you to digest it brother Sergey and I was having a conversation here recently and sometimes you just got to love just a fresh perspective almost like what do you do with this stuff throw in the trash don't even read it yeah cool just throw it in the trash in electronic age that means when that comes your curiosity is not even allowed to open and scan so that you can criticize their nonsense what is this you say well brother Paul you were talking about breaking down strongholds tonight we are we are you see this is Satan's form of creating a stronghold for him is to plant a seed of Doubt a seed of fear I'm going to be deceived but my brother and sister I preach this a lot and it is a very pet subject to me I will admit that but the word of God says we can't be deceived because what we are the word amen you won't be deceived so what does this mean if you are the word you must be eating the word because pardon me for this normal phrase you are what you eat and if we're eating the word then there's no way Satan can come and deceive you unless he plants something in the womb of your mind and causes you to start dwelling on that well scripture said that signs and wonders would follow them that believe Do You Realize by entertaining that Spirit you've just set yourself out from that position of that promise because you now have a spirit of doubt so you're now stepping back the promise is right here you're stepping back because now you've got to look around and see is it happening anywhere well Saints I don't know about you but we'll go into it tonight some of it's very personal my God has come down in a very personal way in my life it's undeniable do I have to go out amongst the Sadducees and the Pharisees and the herodians and lay my life on a table so they can examine the details to see if they're valid you see how slippery Satan is coming with his pamphlets spreading them oh you need to watch this you need to hear this you need to read this I wouldn't even use it for Firestarter lest the smoke of that Spirit would float through my house so the true word of God is our greatest weapon can someone tell me what Satan's weakest link is foreign the word the word is Satan's weakest link you see the word shows us how Lucifer the prince of the heavens was cast out by the word and he can't get back so if he had any Authority he would go and place himself back but he's had to make Earth his kingdom you know if you're wanting to be a fighter you don't want to go to the man who talks about fighting you want to go to the man who goes in the alley and he's the one that walks out that's what you want to do and Satan brings a fight and he talks a good fight doesn't he Saints but my brother and sister he's already been cast out when he came out of the alley it was by force of the word not of his own and so we see that Satan's weakest point is the word of God and my brother and sister we see in our scriptures our lord Jesus and and Satan comes down and takes him to the Pinnacle takes him all these places and you know it's there what did Jesus do he didn't go and say now this and now that his response was there was only one reference isn't that wonderful when we're all on the same page and nobody has to say what are they referring to but when he spoke to the devil that day it is written Satan knew what he was talking about it wasn't like oh let me explain to you what I'm talking about over here he said it is written he didn't have to go quote chapter verse lines he didn't have to bring up keywords for his search all he had to do is say it is written and right there at that moment Satan he didn't even give up get this Saints this is where many people Miss up here mess up here is because they think when you say to the devil it is written that he's going to just run off but my brother and sister he runs off all right but he leaves a lot of little pamphlets behind him a lot of little ideas a lot of little arrows into the mind and into the spirit because he knows he's defeated but he'll be right back now the scripture says that if we approach the word of God correctly that Satan will flee from us what is the key ingredient the word I always like that story you know when I was younger I used to read that over and over again used to get this have an imagination of the seven sons of Siva I can see them all stop right there the mirror just the tie walk through that doorway we're here to cast you out a few minutes later hope this isn't too visual for you they come running out almost stripped naked beat and scratched bit why they went with knowledge they went with the education they had studied they had observed and had a little dose of imagination in there of how it must have been when they cast Satan out well sorry sweet and he was like well and they're like that doesn't work but you see the devil when he gets you to running doesn't stop he'll chase you as far as you'll run he'll Trace chase a rich man from Wall Street to living in a cardboard box under the Brooklyn Bridge that's how far he would Chase let me hurry here so Satan's weakest point is the word of God it is written not his powerful Saints I don't know how many of us and you don't know I don't I don't really want to know I don't know how many of us actually practice that actually come down to the point Lord the word it's written this spirit is bothering me this thought is bothering me this circumstance is bothering me but it's written Lord that you would deliver me from every affliction I stand on that Lord I believe that Lord and then to watch those things evaporate from in front of you and go away amen the prophet of God said the word will defeat Satan any time in any place do we believe that not the debate of the word don't you just love that when you receive a little email and somebody wants you to engage into a Blog thing just debate the message with us as friends I ain't got no friends that got a pitchfork and horns not one single friend that wants to take the word of God and make it none effect friendship does not connect to that you want to be Paul's friends and surprisingly there's very few that want to so I don't have to worry about saying this you want to be Paul's friend you come with the word that lifts me up and strengthens me the word that encourages me to press forward the word that reminds me of who I am and then I know they're my friend because they care about my soul which is who I really am yeah not the knowledge of the word look dealing with Satan my brother and sister it's not to debate the word and defeat someone on a debate it is not to prove how much knowledge we have but the real proof lies in the word applied if I really believe this little story about a grandmother went to the naturopathic type doctor said I have this symptom I have that symptom the doctor says Well here here's these these two you know vitamins or herbs or whatever here you take this one twice a day you take this one twice a day and we'll see in a month so she comes back a month later and the Seal's not even broken on the bottles she tells the doctor I feel better the doctors but how could you it's a silly story I read the label and it said it would make me feel better and I believed the doctor's like I don't think that's how it works but would it work for us I believe what's on the label and it will change my life on caveat we're supposed to eat the book the doctor sent Grandma home after making her swallow some vitamins it's an interesting story about this lady I think it was West Virginia and that brother back there in West Virginia will tell you I won't say who it is for sure but he'll tell you anything that happens in West Virginia will be extraordinary now let's look at this looking to the Unseen I'm getting sidetracked someone asked me not long ago said brother Branham what do you think about the future I said I do not know what the future holds but I know who holds the future so that's the thing if I can keep acquainted with him then when he found out that this Prophet was in Israel now this goes back and kind of another thing here and please never hesitate to go read the the whole before and behind and then he found out that this Prophet was in Israel he said go fetch him bring him to me and they went down and someone told him that Elisha was at Dothan and when they got down there to Dothan they went in by night time and encamped around about in darkness you see how the enemy always works underhanded in dark and encamped around about the city to catch Elisha so when the young man his servant raised up early in the morning and went out in other words he was a fellow that had taken him in and out and around was his servant life and when he went out he came back and he said alas my master for the whole city is a excuse me is uncamped about with horses and Chariots of the enemy he said why there's more with us than there is with them well he could see no one but Elisha so only thing I can guess Saints is that Elisha must have lifted a curtain in a room and looked out doesn't sound right does it because you still can't see him so Elisha will hurry on here and Elisha prayed and said Lord protect us from these enemies that are surrounding us protect us from the the whole city that's encamped about With the Enemy Lord you've got to come rescue us oh am I on the wrong page Elisha prayed and said Lord open the young man's eyes that he may see and I'm going to add this right in there he may see what is already taking place this is not we hope to see this is not these signs and wonders should good might possibly be following this my brother and sister is a point I want to make to you tonight because you see it all depends on what your outlook is of the signs and the Wonders it's what you look at of seeing and thinking that God is going to do in this day the prophet of God said this is not going to be a show this is going to be a secret and the world out here says prove it show us my brother and sister we can't show them because we cannot make God make what he said in secret open and they wanted to be open they want to be able to judge it in their fashion but God said these things would be done in secret in other words this bride of Christ is coming to maturity coming to the fullness of who she is and it's not a public show oh look at that and the Lord moved the veil from before the young man and he looked in the whole hills and mountains were full of Chariots of Fire standing around that old Prophet well he wasn't afraid then oh oh what I would think tonight Lord let us look past the curtain of time just look over just a peek see what it's all about we're fighting here we're fighting here tonight a great Warfare right against wrong word of God against modern theology trying to make the word of God bring it to the people while the enemy would try to be said it in every way but one is the majority in God Hallelujah aren't you glad now notice the point I want to see is Elijah the man who was of God called the man of God did not look to the natural thing he looked to the supernatural thing he didn't look at what he's seen he looked at what he did not see oh my brother and sister I've got a couple notes injected into this my brother and sister one as we'll look at this this is what happens when you're acquainted with the right one when you are acquainted with the one who's in charge of all things you can say Lord you notice he didn't have to go have prayer meeting he didn't have to go consult anybody else he just said Lord open this young man's eyes and he was so close to God God said I know what he's thinking and I know why he wants to think it and I know the purpose behind it and it happened another thing my brother and sister Elisha didn't have to run outside as it were and Peak and see if those chariots were there he knew who he was I will be with you even in you to the ends the ends the ends of the Earth oh God help us to not have to stop and say Lord are you here Lord are you in Grace Tabernacle tonight are you in our lives Lord are you in my circumstance Lord we should come my brother and sister to the place as Sons and Daughters of God with a promised word for the hour and say my God is on the scene whether I see him or not whether it's approvable whether it is and it doesn't matter he said he would be and I believe and I believe Hallelujah now look at this boy this sure seems like to be the day we're living in if I can just come over here and rub this just a little bit we're fighting here tonight so not 2 000 years ago three thousand years ago now this might be a few years ago but it's in our generation you realize there's people still living that were in these meetings they're passing quickly but we are not devoid of eyewitnesses so what do you do if you have an eyewitness in the court of law I actually did a little studying on this you have an eyewitness in the court of law and you don't want that eyewitness to speak so you do everything to convolute the story and drag the attention of the eyewitness to something else and then look back and get them to stumble on their words and then say see they didn't tell that story the same as they told it before well I'm sorry please all forgive me we follow those people around we'll get the versions of their story also because we're human but you see they want it to be profit when they want it to be profit and they want it to be human when they want it to be human and they want it to be confused when they want it to be confused they simply want it their way and my Bible says I am God and I change no matter if my servant stumbles I'm God Amen I never stumble but you see people get this Warfare into the flesh Realm I'm going to take this old man here that can barely remember who he is now but he witnessed the supernatural we're going to make him look foolish and somehow that proves our point you say brother Paul why you're preaching on this because you're going to face it they're going to knock on your door one day they're going to somehow find your email somewhere and bombard you with their pamphlet maybe an electronic form best thing you can do I jokingly look over at the keyboard and call it the eject button you're out of here then in my imagination I see the devil sorry about that I had to just put that in there see if y'all was paying attention but one's a majority but look at this prophet of God just told it like it is trying to make the word of God bring it to the people while the enemy would try to be said it in every way so they were living in Saints it's happening amen let me move on now you know we preached the other day and brought Hebrews 11 into this and I want to just bring this one scripture real quick Hebrews 11 33 speaking all the heroes of faith who through faith subdued kingdoms I should ask the brothers to have put Webster Online up on the screen because Webster ties it right back to spiritual realms who cares if they went out kicked a king out of a country oh but it means a lot to me when realize that through faith I subdued spiritual realms I can conquer the devil's anointed spiritual Realm and walk away as a conqueror because the word says we're going to be Kings and Priests to our God there's our rulership there's our leadership there's a position amen so look at that now wrought righteousness obtained promises that's another one I highlighted here obtain promises does that mean they just went out found some promise and took holds of it no they recognized the promise that had been given to them and they took possession of it they no longer just talked about that promise my brother and sister let's not let this stumble us it's good to talk about the promises but there comes a day that we need to obtain that promise lay hands on that promise make that promise our promise and put it into action Hallelujah Hallelujah let me just bring this I wrote this little note here once again we're subduing kingdoms do we need to stop let's just say you're in your prayer closet you're in your car you're in your lip do you need to stop and look and make sure God's with you he said he would be he'll be there it's his promise to us it's ours to obtain don't let the devil say well look you're you're just going through a really hard time Where's God you know footsteps and the sands of time it's just a lovely illustration of that imagine if we could see that we're closing here imagine if you could see this Prophet Jason I think about this I'm sorry about using imagination in a negative connotation and also bringing back imagine if God was so gracious just like that little footsteps on the sands of time and he let us really truly experience what had happened now pardon me I would put this in just kind of a rough Realm we'd realize that those two marks was the tips of our toes because God's got our caller and at some point in time we're like hey hey I can walk now you'd say good now you say why'd you bring it out that way Paul because so many Christians got God babying them oh my poor little guy my poor little guy someday you'll be a rugged Warrior for me my poor little guy no sir I'm kind of the fashion I hope you all don't mind looking at me kind of starting here I hope you don't mind I'm more on the got the collar and your toes are dragging ditches and God's going to say man up has God ever said that to you I'm telling you God has said that to me more than once man up quit your whimpering quit your crying quit your sniveling I don't need your excuse I've heard them all in Generations before you ever got here so I don't need your excuse just man up go repent maybe it's not for you Ted but for me it was go repent okay we're hurrying even though it don't look like it sometimes they say slow is fast okay now here brother Branham I cut this a bunch of this out brother Branham is talking about the little lady that come to the table and approach Jesus now son of David we understand by Revelation that she approached him wrong but sincere right she had no office to approach him as son of David so put this in the context put back and shoved back and shoved out put outside whatever it was she was determined she was persistent perseverant something on the inside of her can anyone say Amen to that told her that she was going to get it regardless of how long she had to wait what she had to go through she would get it anyhow she was after the crumbs she didn't want a full course dinner she said the dogs eat the crumbs from under the master's table that's the way to do it oh wouldn't it be much better to have our lord Jesus recognize us call us to the front you know and say here we have this special plate for you a special place for you this woman was so desirous of receiving from the Lord that she would settle for a crumb and my brother and sister a crumb is all we need if we are sincere and the people I couldn't live on a crumb well you just never seem to come from the table of the king yep don't take the high seat take the back seat just be a little person wait don't you know I I'm a pastor don't you know I I've been all over the world don't you no just take a back seat just be little God will testify of the things oh my the Way Up Is Down always he that humbles himself shall be exalted he that exalts himself shall be abased the Way Up Is Down always remember she had never seen a miracle you know when I read this quote it really stunned me I had to go back and kind of like look at this and realize okay she wasn't going like well you did it for her did it for them did it for that did it for this family did for that family you know he's got to do it for me she just knew her Deliverance was in him her security was in him her healing was in him everything she had need of was in him she was a gentile but she had Faith she was something like the Harlot Rahab she said to the spies she didn't say wait till I see how Joshua Combs his hair what how does your generals all look or what kind of Swords do they use what instruments have they got what kind of warfare she said this struck me I've heard that God is with you that Saints we say what can I say to a co-worker sister April we've had these conversations about those what do we do what do we say we live it in such a fashion that their own words would be I know that God is with you amen there is when we can say thank you Lord I maybe have done something for the kingdom why just living it's living in I've heard that God is with you that's good enough for me I want Mercy she believed amen Hallelujah faith cometh by hearing that's right that's right hearing the word of God let's just stand sister Ruth if you would come brother Sean all I want to say tonight Saints to close this out I hope that maybe one word would stirred or inspired you just a little I just want to say tonight these are words from the prophet I want Mercy not Justice because if it was Justice I am condemned I want Mercy Lord I want Mercy and you have given me everything I need to be victorious in this Warfare Amen to be able to stand in this hour amen and tear down Saints we really didn't talk about strongholds so much but we did this is the hour believe if there's a stronghold in your life believe God has already equipped you to overcome that yes God has already given you what it takes to knock down the walls of the enemy and find deliverance we don't need they're good we need to have some more of that we'll have some things we'll announce here in the near future we need to have things my brother and sister but we don't need a great Revival that brother so and so preaches and then I'll get Deliverance no what we need to do is determine in our hearts the prophet of God said that determined in our hearts and God will bring you to that place Hallelujah you love the Lord tonight Hallelujah Lord you are so
