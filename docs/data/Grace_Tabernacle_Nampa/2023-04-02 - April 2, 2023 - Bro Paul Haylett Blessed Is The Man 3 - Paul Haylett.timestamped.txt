[43:38] hand this morning and say Lord that is
[43:40] my heart's cry today I need you Lord
[43:43] I need more of you than I've ever had
[43:47] before Lord
[43:48] [Music]
[43:49] I need you in the morning and the noon
[43:51] and in the night time
[43:54] oh thank you Lord Jesus
[43:57] Lord to fill your presence or to know
[44:02] that you're walking with us
[44:05] oh Hallelujah
[44:08] hallelujah hallelujah
[44:11] amen
[44:16] just a couple things I want to share
[44:18] quite quick quick here uh this coming
[44:21] Sunday Easter Service the certainly
[44:25] would welcome any songs that the Lord
[44:26] might lay on your heart of course I
[44:28] would say that for every service
[44:33] um we'll have a potluck to follow this
[44:35] coming Sunday so
[44:37] we want to remind you that brother
[44:40] George will be coming
[44:42] um I think he arrives afternoon or
[44:44] evening of the 20th so I have some
[44:47] things I have not confirmed with brother
[44:49] George but I would like to have a Friday
[44:51] evening service
[44:53] uh just to give brother George time to
[44:56] share
[44:57] what he sees and hears on the mission
[44:59] field what's happening around the world
[45:01] more of an informal time and we don't
[45:04] want to turn this as the prophet of God
[45:06] talked about soup suppers and all these
[45:08] kind of things we don't want to do that
[45:10] but we might have just a little time of
[45:12] Fellowship in the basement after uh
[45:14] brother George on on Friday evening and
[45:18] then we'll have Saturday uh probably
[45:21] about six o'clock
[45:22] Sunday morning and uh
[45:25] then we'll have a time I know brother
[45:28] George enjoyed the last time he was here
[45:30] with us to be able to sit down uh on
[45:33] fellowship
[45:35] with you so we'll be looking forward to
[45:38] a potluck after the Sunday service also
[45:41] amen
[45:43] so as we would just turn in our Bibles
[45:48] um
[45:50] I'm going to do something a little
[45:52] different this evening this might come
[45:54] as a surprise here but sometimes it's
[45:57] good you know reminds me of a brother
[46:01] in South Africa telling me
[46:04] uh a little bit of brother Gideon's
[46:07] approach
[46:08] and he's talking about how brother
[46:10] Gideon called up and said brother I'd
[46:13] like you to speak this Wednesday and the
[46:15] brother said I started to offer up
[46:18] uh brother Gideon
[46:20] um
[46:21] I'll be you know having to work till six
[46:23] and my time will be very tight and
[46:26] everything will be a very busy week and
[46:29] as he gives all these reasons brother
[46:31] Gideon
[46:32] then says
[46:34] brother I've got to go I'm really
[46:37] looking forward to your sermon on
[46:40] Wednesday click
[46:42] and so tonight for maybe 15 or 20
[46:46] minutes our brother Adrian's going to
[46:49] share a little something from his heart
[46:51] and I'm looking forward to that
[46:54] amen just something just to
[46:58] encourage us right before we go into
[47:00] communion and uh so uh brother Adrian
[47:04] click
[47:06] so anyway let's turn in our Bibles this
[47:11] morning
[47:13] um
[47:13] on things that are to be amen that's a
[47:16] topic my brother and sister is the
[47:18] prophet of God speaks of those things
[47:20] he's he's giving us an insight into what
[47:25] is going to happen before us and we can
[47:27] get caught up in a spirit my brother and
[47:29] sister and we can talk about there's
[47:31] going to be wars and rumors of wars and
[47:33] pestilence and famines and all kinds of
[47:36] tribulations but we as the bride of
[47:39] Christ should be looking we know that's
[47:40] going to happen the word said so but I'm
[47:43] telling you there are things that are to
[47:45] be that are glorious and Supernatural
[47:48] uplifting to the soul empowering a bride
[47:51] of Christ to look with enthusiasm to the
[47:54] day that is coming now my brother and
[47:56] sister I'll just uh throw this in in
[47:58] this context when we're there laboring
[48:01] and you you have no choice but to just
[48:04] labor you have no choice but to take
[48:06] care of the things you have to take care
[48:08] of sometimes we find it when we're weary
[48:10] In the Flesh maybe a little weary in the
[48:13] spirit we we're not Enjoying Everyday
[48:15] Life in some context do you understand
[48:18] what I'm saying but what we have in a
[48:21] spiritual realm is a promise of things
[48:24] that are to be and I tell you if we can
[48:27] look Beyond this flesh and look to the
[48:29] things that are promised to us men this
[48:32] flesh is much more bearable but when we
[48:35] look to the Flesh and have no promise of
[48:37] tomorrow then this life can be pretty
[48:40] dull it can be pretty worrisome it can
[48:42] be pretty bothersome it can be I won't
[48:45] go on all the adjectives that would be
[48:47] included in that but I tell you when it
[48:50] comes and we see all of these things
[48:51] happening what does the word say look up
[48:55] look up Don't Look Down don't just look
[48:57] at what the problems are because our
[49:00] problems are greater than us
[49:03] in the flesh
[49:04] but not greater than him in our flesh
[49:08] amen so it's just a real privilege to be
[49:11] here today so I want to preach once
[49:13] again on blessed is the man you'll find
[49:15] I've jumped ahead all the way to
[49:17] Revelations 19 and if we will just turn
[49:20] in our Bibles Revelations 19 1 through
[49:23] 13. amen and I don't mean to embarrass
[49:26] anybody but brother Daniel and I call
[49:29] you brother because I view you as my
[49:31] brother and friend God bless you to see
[49:33] you this morning amen now look at this
[49:36] my brother and sister what is happening
[49:37] this is a passage of scripture that is
[49:41] very much giving us a spiritual insight
[49:45] into things that are to be and I love
[49:49] this scripture and I really am attracted
[49:52] to that because as we'll get down and
[49:54] read the scripture there amen it tells
[49:57] us that uh there is the time that we
[49:59] should be glad and rejoice and give
[50:02] honor to him for the marriage of the
[50:04] lamest and that passage has always been
[50:07] a very special passage to me because it
[50:10] is an absolute directive
[50:13] of what is going to happen it is not a
[50:15] hope Soul it might be it is an absolute
[50:18] directive saying this is going to take
[50:22] place can someone say thank you Lord for
[50:24] that amen because when it is promised to
[50:27] take place you know it reminds me of a
[50:29] little story once a brother shared with
[50:31] me he said he told his son he says you
[50:33] know son uh you mow the lawn today and
[50:36] dad will take you and your little sister
[50:38] for ice cream so the little boys out
[50:41] there in the heat of a Saturday
[50:42] afternoon mowing the grass all sweaty
[50:45] little guy almost not big enough you
[50:47] know to to do the job and when they get
[50:49] all done well there was uh some
[50:51] circumstances rose up and it looked like
[50:54] they weren't going to ice cream and the
[50:57] little boy comes in
[50:59] and he looks his dad in the face he
[51:01] doesn't say Hey Dad remember you said
[51:03] this
[51:04] he just says
[51:07] as it was spoken
[51:09] so shall it be
[51:17] our little ones remember
[51:19] and so should we
[51:21] as it was spoken
[51:23] so shall it be amen we should have that
[51:28] kind of confidence now we as parents
[51:29] sometimes have failed to follow through
[51:31] and Lord forgive us children forgive us
[51:33] amen I know that my own children Through
[51:36] The Years you know they're all grown up
[51:38] got children of their own and you know I
[51:41] remember dad you said
[51:42] you never want to hear those things it's
[51:44] like okay let's subject go on
[51:46] but we do fail but our Gods never fail
[51:49] can someone lift a hand and say thank
[51:51] you Lord you've never failed me
[51:54] amen your word always comes to pass
[51:57] Hallelujah Revelations 19 1-13
[52:05] and after these things I heard a great
[52:07] voice of much people in heaven saying
[52:09] Hallelujah Salvation and Glory and Honor
[52:12] and power unto the Lord our God
[52:16] for true and righteous are his judgments
[52:19] for he hath judged the great which
[52:21] did corrupt the Earth with her
[52:23] fornication and has Avenged the blood of
[52:25] his servants at her hand and again they
[52:28] said Alleluia and her smoke rose up
[52:31] forever and ever and the Four and Twenty
[52:34] elders and the four beasts fell down in
[52:37] worship God that set on the throne
[52:39] saying amen Alleluia and a voice came
[52:43] out of the throne saying praise our God
[52:45] all ye his servants and ye that fear Him
[52:48] both small and great
[52:52] and as I heard as it were a voice of a
[52:54] great multitude and as a voice of many
[52:56] Waters as a voice of Mighty thundering
[52:59] saying Alleluia for the Lord God
[53:01] omnipotent reigneth
[53:03] let us be glad and rejoice now my
[53:08] brother and sister this directly
[53:09] included you and I right into this
[53:11] scripture
[53:13] and give honor to him for the marriage
[53:15] of the Lamb has come and his wife hath
[53:17] made herself ready and to her was
[53:20] granted that she should be arrayed and
[53:22] find linen clean and white for the fine
[53:24] lineness of the righteousness of saints
[53:27] and he saith unto me right blessed are
[53:30] they which are called unto the marriage
[53:33] supper of the Lamb amen just blessed
[53:36] just to be called
[53:39] can we today say Lord thank you for
[53:42] blessing me
[53:43] amen
[53:48] and he saith unto me these are the true
[53:50] sayings of God and I fell at his feet to
[53:52] worship him and he said unto me see thou
[53:54] do it not for I am thy fellow servant of
[53:57] thy Brethren that have the testimony of
[53:59] Jesus worship God for the testimony of
[54:02] Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy
[54:06] and I saw heaven opened and behold a
[54:09] white horse and he that set on him was
[54:10] called faithful and true and in
[54:12] righteousness he doth judge and make war
[54:15] his eyes were as a flame of fire and on
[54:18] his head were many crowns and he had a
[54:20] name written that no man knew but he
[54:22] himself he was clothed with the vesture
[54:25] dipped in Blood and his name is called
[54:28] the word of God
[54:30] Heavenly Father we ask you to bless this
[54:32] time this morning Lord such a lovely
[54:34] atmosphere father just to feel your
[54:36] presence just ask you come down lord I
[54:39] know there are needs here today there
[54:41] are hearts that are hungry Lord I ask
[54:44] you to satisfy every need father and
[54:46] every Hungry Heart may walk today from
[54:49] this building filled the father Lord we
[54:52] ask for your guidance and for your word
[54:54] and for your blessing the name of Jesus
[54:56] Christ amen you may be seated
[55:03] as I have already said through the years
[55:05] I have looked at this scripture
[55:08] and in times when I struggled with
[55:10] things in my life and I struggled to
[55:12] really see who I was I always come back
[55:16] to this scripture because to me it was
[55:19] an assurance that there would come a
[55:21] time that I would be ready there was a
[55:24] time and assurance that that these
[55:26] pieces would all fall in place and you
[55:28] know at that stage of my life when I
[55:31] lived in a realm you might say of chaos
[55:33] when I lived in a realm that I viewed
[55:36] myself more of a hypocritical nature but
[55:40] my brother and sister it's not hypocrisy
[55:42] when it comes from your heart and you're
[55:44] trying but you come short of the goal
[55:45] amen that is this the process that God
[55:48] is using and we'll touch on that Lord
[55:50] willing a little more here in a few
[55:52] minutes but you look at this and realize
[55:54] that Satan would come every time that we
[55:57] come sort of our expectation of ourself
[56:00] that Satan jumps on the bandwagon to
[56:03] tell us you don't have what it takes but
[56:06] the truth is my brother and sister it's
[56:08] to God who charts our progress it is not
[56:11] ourself it's not the preacher the church
[56:14] it's not the world it's certainly not
[56:16] Satan amen I'll tell you what it is uh
[56:18] just reminds me one time brother Ron
[56:21] Spencer making a statement you know he's
[56:23] dealing you know with cancer and and
[56:26] he's there you know declaring that hey I
[56:28] might have this the doctor say you have
[56:31] this but he said you know I'm here to
[56:34] preach the word of God and that poor
[56:35] devil is going to have to as long as I'm
[56:37] alive gonna have to hear me preach this
[56:39] over and over and over again poor devil
[56:44] amen but he's going to have to hear this
[56:46] bride of Christ because she's got a
[56:48] testimony and God is the one that is
[56:51] marking or charting the process the
[56:53] progress of this bride of Christ amen
[56:55] it's no one else thank you Lord
[56:59] amen and as it is uh I say that
[57:02] Revelation 19 gives us a very clear
[57:04] picture of just how awesome our God is
[57:07] we look at this and realize how
[57:09] beautiful how incredible he is and how
[57:13] this great plan that he had for our
[57:15] lives it can go for a season my brother
[57:17] and sister but as it is you know now
[57:20] this seems like counter-intuitive to use
[57:22] this but I want to I believe it's a very
[57:25] good example my brother and sister there
[57:27] are certain weeds in the world today
[57:29] that their seed can go in the ground and
[57:33] can lay there for many many years before
[57:36] it grows now this seems counterintuitive
[57:39] to use this for an example but it is a
[57:41] very good example a thistle seed while
[57:45] the thistle has not taken over the world
[57:47] only because one out of about 50 000
[57:51] seeds is dermatized otherwise imagine
[57:54] what everything would look like but a
[57:56] thistle seed can lay in the soil between
[57:59] 12 and 15 years before the conditions
[58:04] are just right for it to grow and so I
[58:06] use that because it is something in the
[58:08] natural we are not thistle we are Sons
[58:10] and Daughters of God but God knows the
[58:13] seed of certain attributes can lay in
[58:16] our life for many seasons and we would
[58:19] say why is this not in my life or I
[58:22] would desire to Manifest this and it
[58:24] doesn't seem to be there and the devil
[58:27] will discourage you because it is not
[58:29] coming to pass but when the conditions
[58:32] are right when the season is right and
[58:35] when the moisture of the holy spirit is
[58:37] right night my brother and sister that
[58:39] pops to life amen and so it's there that
[58:42] we come as Sons and Daughters of God
[58:45] never stopping my brother and sister to
[58:47] judge yourself harshly we should judge
[58:50] ourselves daily but don't judge yourself
[58:52] harshly there's a lot of difference of
[58:54] that there's even an acknowledgment what
[58:56] we might say looks like hypocrisy
[58:58] because we can recognize certain things
[59:01] in our life that need to change but we
[59:03] seem to be powerless to change that can
[59:06] someone say I've been there amen but God
[59:09] knows that in the season because
[59:11] everything has to be in its correct
[59:14] order Amen in its correct season and so
[59:18] God knows that while we recognize and we
[59:20] are praying or seeking to have something
[59:23] manifested in our life God knows this
[59:26] season that is necessary because my
[59:29] brother and sister you don't go out in
[59:30] the field and plant sideways with the
[59:33] planter
[59:34] everything's got to be in a row it's got
[59:36] to be in the right way if it's not
[59:38] whatever when the cultivator which would
[59:40] be the word coming to correct us clean
[59:42] up our life when the cultivator comes
[59:44] everything that's planted in the center
[59:46] of the row is a weed
[59:50] now we have a phrase on the farm that a
[59:52] tree in the wrong place is a weed and we
[59:55] all love trees we want to plant trees we
[59:56] want to live you know have trees my
[59:58] brother and sister but if the tree is in
[1:00:00] the wrong place I've seen trees
[1:00:02] absolutely push the whole side of a
[1:00:04] house foundation over because of the
[1:00:06] roots planted too close to the house and
[1:00:09] left unattended for years it has that
[1:00:11] kind of strength so we don't want these
[1:00:13] things in our life if they're
[1:00:15] detrimental to our life amen so you look
[1:00:18] at that many times like we'll see
[1:00:19] speaking in tongues I made reference
[1:00:21] Wednesday night you know people would
[1:00:23] speak in tongues and say I've got it but
[1:00:25] is if that is not in the right season
[1:00:28] not in the right order not in the right
[1:00:29] ground they'll go through the rest of
[1:00:31] their life believing God has blessed
[1:00:33] them and spoke to them and give that
[1:00:36] stamp of approval when in fact the word
[1:00:38] is what we measure our life by not by
[1:00:41] gifts amen so it's always the
[1:00:44] preeminence that is given to the word
[1:00:46] and so as we get this clear picture of
[1:00:49] our awesome God and and he is the only
[1:00:51] one that is worthy these are just the
[1:00:53] scriptures we're just going to bounce
[1:00:55] down through this if you don't mind he's
[1:00:57] the only one that is worthy of our
[1:00:58] praise and glory and honor amen we give
[1:01:01] this to our God we give respect to men
[1:01:06] and to authority of governments Etc but
[1:01:09] we give glory and honor to God Amen
[1:01:11] because the word says we're not
[1:01:13] respecters of men meaning that they have
[1:01:16] dominance of our life
[1:01:19] but we have to as a Christian give a
[1:01:22] respect in other words if you find
[1:01:24] yourself being disrespectful to your
[1:01:27] brothers and your sisters to Ministry
[1:01:29] Etc you've got the wrong spirit
[1:01:32] and there are many people today and I'm
[1:01:34] not going to go off in this but I'm just
[1:01:36] going to speak strongly on this many
[1:01:37] people today believe they have a right
[1:01:40] to speak disrespectfully of those who
[1:01:43] don't agree with them not realizing that
[1:01:46] that clearly declares a wrong spirit
[1:01:49] God give us the right spirit amen
[1:01:51] because with the right Spirit we can
[1:01:53] correctly discern
[1:01:55] amen this brother might not agree with
[1:01:59] me but I will treat him like a brother I
[1:02:02] will treat him with respect and people
[1:02:04] say why are you giving honor to somebody
[1:02:06] that's caught up in something that's not
[1:02:08] correct my brother and sister you're not
[1:02:10] speaking about them as much as you are
[1:02:12] speaking about yourself
[1:02:14] because if you don't have that kind of a
[1:02:16] nature in you then you don't have the
[1:02:18] nature of God now when I say that people
[1:02:21] will say but Jesus called them Snakes in
[1:02:23] the Grass and he called them devils and
[1:02:25] he called them all that my brother and
[1:02:27] sister he was speaking from a Divine
[1:02:29] Authority that you and I don't have
[1:02:32] yes sir
[1:02:35] Lord help us
[1:02:36] because there's a lot of people think
[1:02:38] they have the authority to declare who
[1:02:39] is and who isn't but I'm here to tell
[1:02:41] you we have the authority to pray
[1:02:44] to change the situation
[1:02:46] and we have the authority to judge
[1:02:49] whether it's right or wrong not whether
[1:02:51] they're in or out
[1:02:54] um
[1:02:55] so that's the clarity that we seek
[1:02:58] amen but look at how awesome our God is
[1:03:03] this message is a very personalized
[1:03:06] message
[1:03:11] you know
[1:03:13] my Netflix account
[1:03:15] has been canceled once a week for the
[1:03:18] last six months
[1:03:22] usually about 4 A.M
[1:03:26] my phone dings
[1:03:28] and because it could be a believer and
[1:03:31] have a need or a situation I do my best
[1:03:35] to get out of bed and look at it
[1:03:37] now my brother and sister I'm not
[1:03:39] worried about my next flip Netflix
[1:03:41] account being canceled because I've
[1:03:44] never had it
[1:03:47] now the devil can try and tell me how to
[1:03:50] cancel my situation
[1:03:52] but if I've never had it it doesn't
[1:03:55] apply to me
[1:03:57] amen now I want you to catch this
[1:03:59] because
[1:04:01] the word says
[1:04:03] I've never had any sin held to my
[1:04:06] account when the Devil comes and says
[1:04:09] your sin I can say you've got the wrong
[1:04:13] account this is probably a scam or a
[1:04:16] fraudulent or a misdirected
[1:04:22] I don't need to go on tap the little
[1:04:25] blue thing on the screen and go to their
[1:04:28] account and try to prove to them who I
[1:04:31] am you know and the final proof is
[1:04:33] strangely enough always your credit card
[1:04:35] number
[1:04:38] but you see if they're saying you are
[1:04:42] but you aren't
[1:04:43] disregard that
[1:04:46] that's why the word says that when we
[1:04:48] come to a place so we have no
[1:04:49] condemnation we have complete confidence
[1:04:52] my brother and sister do you understand
[1:04:53] that's not saying come to the day you
[1:04:56] never make a mistake do you realize my
[1:04:58] brother and sister what that mistake
[1:05:00] anybody made a mistake lately
[1:05:02] okay will the rest of you lift your
[1:05:04] hands just because we want to be honest
[1:05:06] in church today
[1:05:07] my brother and sister do you realize
[1:05:10] when you made that mistake you'd say why
[1:05:12] would God allow me to make that mistake
[1:05:14] I'll tell you why God allowed you to
[1:05:16] make that mistake to magnify Grace in
[1:05:19] your eyes to magnify his authority
[1:05:22] before Sons and Daughters of God it's
[1:05:25] not to magnify your mistake that's
[1:05:28] Satan's job his is to say I want you to
[1:05:31] recognize how great my grace is in your
[1:05:36] life
[1:05:37] oh Hallelujah
[1:05:40] so we get to look and see
[1:05:42] this personalized message of our God we
[1:05:45] can talk about Sinners my brother and
[1:05:47] sister if we talk about in the context
[1:05:49] we normally talk about Sin as humans
[1:05:51] well well my sin I made a mistake I
[1:05:54] thought a thought I looked at a woman I
[1:05:55] looked at a man I did this or did that a
[1:05:58] coveted a vehicle a house uh whatever my
[1:06:00] whatever the situation might be we call
[1:06:03] that mistake we call that sin and we
[1:06:06] would say well if you recognize that and
[1:06:08] you don't do anything about it it's
[1:06:09] iniquity but my brother and sister if
[1:06:12] you don't have something stirring in the
[1:06:14] heart and you just by the flesh try to
[1:06:17] come and say I'm going to overcome my
[1:06:19] situation by my willpower I'll tell you
[1:06:22] your willpower will run out
[1:06:25] oh but we ever get in the spirit of God
[1:06:27] getting the presence of almighty God and
[1:06:30] something down in the heart starts to
[1:06:33] rumble and starts to bubble and you are
[1:06:35] there and you say Lord I want to be what
[1:06:37] you called me to be I want to be alive
[1:06:40] like you called me to live I want to be
[1:06:43] everything you said I am and my brother
[1:06:45] and sister something starts to change
[1:06:47] and a week goes by and you still are
[1:06:49] struggling with the same problem and the
[1:06:52] month goes by you're still struggling
[1:06:53] with the same problem and the devil says
[1:06:56] you can't do it and all we can do is say
[1:06:58] you're right devil but I'm on the road I
[1:07:02] am moving down the road I'm taking the
[1:07:05] steps and one by one the Fetters fall
[1:07:07] off the shackles are broken one by one
[1:07:10] we leave the things behind us because we
[1:07:13] were called
[1:07:16] not to live in a Briar Patch
[1:07:18] not to live in the gravel on the side of
[1:07:20] the road not to live in a back alley but
[1:07:23] to live in the presence of almighty God
[1:07:25] oh I tell you I my brother and sister
[1:07:28] this beautiful gorgeous wonderful
[1:07:30] Journey God has called us on it's called
[1:07:32] a journey and it's not over till it's
[1:07:35] over and we take the steps and I'm
[1:07:37] telling you I'm not where I was
[1:07:39] yesterday I'm not where I was last week
[1:07:42] last month last year I'm on the journey
[1:07:45] and I'm moving forward
[1:07:47] all the Devils say look it reminds me I
[1:07:50] just saw a picture on the screen saver
[1:07:52] this morning of the play that our young
[1:07:54] people put on a few years ago and uh it
[1:07:57] was it was wonderful and and it popped
[1:07:59] up a picture you know they were offered
[1:08:02] a shortcut
[1:08:05] the devil's always got a shortcut
[1:08:08] man I'll tell you what huh
[1:08:10] the devil's pretty clever
[1:08:12] because the goal
[1:08:15] well whatever that was
[1:08:17] the castle
[1:08:18] however you want to call that the goal
[1:08:20] was to Castle
[1:08:24] everyone could say our goal is the
[1:08:26] castle
[1:08:28] but God's got a provided way to get
[1:08:30] there right
[1:08:32] right and the devil's got a shortcut
[1:08:33] that says if you happened
[1:08:35] to go through the swamp
[1:08:37] step on the right log that doesn't sink
[1:08:39] and the gator happens to be taken a nap
[1:08:41] that afternoon
[1:08:44] and everything else that's there you
[1:08:46] might make it on that shortcut
[1:08:49] but is that what God called us to
[1:08:52] they never call us take a shortcuttie he
[1:08:55] told us to go his provided way
[1:08:57] and so when we are walking in his
[1:09:00] provided way the word of God clearly
[1:09:01] shows us we're blessed people
[1:09:03] amen we don't need to worry how long the
[1:09:06] journey is or how we're going to get
[1:09:07] there I've been invited to a marriage
[1:09:10] supper and the word says I am blessed
[1:09:12] because I was invited amen so it's not
[1:09:16] about my ability to get there to be a
[1:09:19] part of the the marriage supper the fact
[1:09:21] is I am blessed and if I'm walking in
[1:09:23] God's blessings I will be there amen
[1:09:26] because he's already made the way before
[1:09:28] us now look at this there's verse 5 you
[1:09:31] know it says uh and there was a voice
[1:09:33] come out of the throne saying praise our
[1:09:35] God all ye his servants and ye that fear
[1:09:38] Him both small and great you know when I
[1:09:41] read this and we all have to admit that
[1:09:43] we would look at the word of God and
[1:09:44] read things and have different
[1:09:46] stimulation you might say from that
[1:09:47] right
[1:09:48] if you don't think so then why did the
[1:09:50] denomination come up with a different
[1:09:51] conclusion
[1:09:53] so every there's there's a lot of
[1:09:55] different conclusions come from the same
[1:09:57] word same anointing of the word will
[1:10:01] produce the same seed no matter where
[1:10:02] but if the anointing is not the same
[1:10:05] anointing then that anointing produces
[1:10:08] the anointing of where it come from
[1:10:10] see anointings are birthed
[1:10:14] [Music]
[1:10:16] you say what no yeah some of those
[1:10:18] anointing come out of the pits of hell
[1:10:21] that cannot be the same birthing
[1:10:24] that came from the Throne of God
[1:10:27] so these anointings are birthed my
[1:10:29] brother and sister and do you realize
[1:10:31] that Satan's so Desiring to destroy you
[1:10:34] has birthed these anointings with
[1:10:37] everything brother Chris was just
[1:10:39] sharing what he's speaking to the young
[1:10:40] adults and it's interesting we had a lot
[1:10:43] of different thoughts but the same
[1:10:45] thought and my brother and sister when
[1:10:47] you understand that the anointing that
[1:10:50] come from God was birth specifically for
[1:10:54] you
[1:10:55] amen you realize that's why this is a
[1:10:58] personal gospel it's not just a random
[1:11:00] one size fits-all gospel my brother and
[1:11:02] sister these young people that we have
[1:11:04] here I pray God fills every one of them
[1:11:06] with the Holy Ghost but they've not been
[1:11:08] out raised out here in a bar room they
[1:11:10] haven't lived in a deal of all this
[1:11:12] garbage that's taking place in the world
[1:11:14] today they've been raised in church but
[1:11:16] they still have to have a new birth they
[1:11:20] have to have a personal relationship
[1:11:22] with Jesus Christ amen now I want you to
[1:11:25] know that this birth that God is
[1:11:28] birthing the word to you as individuals
[1:11:30] is so personalized my brother and sister
[1:11:32] when we get down the road aways
[1:11:35] unfortunately we have to kind of get old
[1:11:36] before we really Dawns on us but you
[1:11:39] come and realize how specifically in
[1:11:42] your path of life God met you here God
[1:11:44] met you here God met you here no one
[1:11:46] else has walked that exact same path
[1:11:50] So Gone had a personalized message for
[1:11:53] you but you know the devil's got a
[1:11:54] personalized message and the prophet of
[1:11:56] God said that Satan has studied you for
[1:11:59] years upon years upon years studied your
[1:12:02] nature studied your weakness studied
[1:12:04] your desire and he's doing everything he
[1:12:07] can do when he throws that out it's not
[1:12:10] some random thing my brother and sister
[1:12:12] it's not that he would come and offer
[1:12:15] liquor to a man that hates liquor
[1:12:19] he personalizes it
[1:12:22] he makes it specific he targets it
[1:12:27] I believe that was brother Donnie Reagan
[1:12:29] was preaching some time back about how
[1:12:30] the more that God gives to you and the
[1:12:33] more that God is in you the bigger the
[1:12:34] target is on your back amen when there
[1:12:37] isn't much there Satan isn't really
[1:12:39] shooting so much at you but the more
[1:12:41] that you surrender and give to God the
[1:12:44] bigger the target is and people will say
[1:12:46] praise the Lord I'm a Christian now my
[1:12:48] problems are over no they are gonna
[1:12:50] start growing from that point on because
[1:12:53] Satan sees something and he knows he's
[1:12:56] got to kill it
[1:12:58] it's a shame that he's a bad enough shot
[1:13:00] he can't
[1:13:03] um
[1:13:04] Hallelujah that's why I gave up bow
[1:13:06] hunting years ago
[1:13:07] big beautiful deer standing there
[1:13:10] maybe here to the back of the church and
[1:13:12] I after
[1:13:14] practice and practice and practice and
[1:13:16] practice I get out in the field I'm
[1:13:18] standing there behind a Butch I've got
[1:13:20] my bow drawn and I'm there is he 20
[1:13:23] yards is he 30 yards I don't know I
[1:13:25] always misjudged the distance I'm going
[1:13:27] to call it 40.
[1:13:28] and the arrow flies this much over its
[1:13:31] back
[1:13:32] after I did that dozens of times I
[1:13:35] decided Lord you didn't call me to be a
[1:13:37] bow hunter
[1:13:41] yeah
[1:13:43] but they're Satan
[1:13:47] they're Satan
[1:13:50] they're in position
[1:13:53] I can do them in
[1:13:55] and the one thing that I'm going to
[1:13:57] cause them to do
[1:13:59] is I'm going to cause them
[1:14:02] to miss the marriage
[1:14:06] he doesn't need to kill us Saints
[1:14:09] he doesn't need to leave us wounded
[1:14:14] as the sense of we think wounded
[1:14:18] he's just got to cause us
[1:14:20] to miss
[1:14:22] the marriage
[1:14:24] however he does it
[1:14:27] he doesn't even care
[1:14:29] we might miss it
[1:14:31] sitting in church
[1:14:36] as the prophet of God said
[1:14:38] the man on the bar stool is not going to
[1:14:40] be disappointed
[1:14:43] hmm
[1:14:45] but look at this verse 5. you know when
[1:14:47] I read this I see it as a command
[1:14:51] and a voice came out of the throne
[1:14:53] right so here's a voice it's not the
[1:14:56] it's not the preacher's voice it's not a
[1:14:59] prophet's voice as it were it's not any
[1:15:01] other voice it's a voice that came
[1:15:03] directly out of the throne but wait God
[1:15:05] might have used a prophet he might have
[1:15:07] used a preacher he might have used a
[1:15:09] good friend whatever it is but God knows
[1:15:12] how and that voice come forth and tells
[1:15:15] them
[1:15:16] praise our God now my brother and sister
[1:15:18] I want you this morning to take that as
[1:15:20] it were as a command from God come from
[1:15:23] the voice of God praise our god what was
[1:15:26] expected as it was with Shadrach Meshach
[1:15:29] and Abednego you didn't just sit there
[1:15:31] and say I don't feel like it today you
[1:15:33] either praised or you went to the
[1:15:34] furnace
[1:15:36] oh boy what did I just say
[1:15:39] come on my brother and sister look at
[1:15:42] this this commandment praise our God all
[1:15:45] ye servants and ye that fear Him both
[1:15:47] small and great amen Praises is who we
[1:15:50] are my brother and sister amen we cannot
[1:15:54] say that we have the Life of Christ and
[1:15:56] never find ourselves in a state of
[1:15:58] worship
[1:15:59] oh it's not gonna happen you're not
[1:16:01] going to learn to worship when you get
[1:16:02] on the other side my brother and sister

[1:16:57] we're human we put little pieces of tape
[1:16:59] so small most everybody doesn't even

[1:17:04] and stop and stand here you stand here
[1:17:06] you stand here how fast that was too
[1:17:08] fast that you're walking faster than the

[1:17:49] again
[1:17:51] it's rehearsal time
[1:17:54] it's our preparation time
[1:17:56] amen because there's an invitation to
[1:17:59] the marriage supper of the Lamb and he
[1:18:02] said I know how to have you and to place
[1:18:05] you and to put you in exactly the spot
[1:18:08] you need to be and now go back and do it
[1:18:10] again and sometimes we say I haven't
[1:18:13] failed you so miserably Lord it seems
[1:18:15] like I went through this trial like two
[1:18:17] or three years ago why am I going
[1:18:19] through it again come on my brother and
[1:18:21] sister be happy you are blessed you've
[1:18:23] been invited to the marriage supper of
[1:18:26] the Lamb he didn't say you were out of
[1:18:28] Step get out he said just do it again
[1:18:31] until we get it right
[1:18:34] and so God is bringing us into this
[1:18:36] lovely time of preparation and he's
[1:18:38] granted this by his grace
[1:18:41] by his Mercy he's granted us not a one
[1:18:45] strike in your out but my brother and
[1:18:47] sister as God applied in his word my
[1:18:49] brother and sister how many times a day
[1:18:52] we must forgive each other now if God
[1:18:54] asks you and I to forgive each other
[1:18:56] that many times how many times a day
[1:18:59] would our God want to forgive us I'll
[1:19:02] tell you it's greater than even what he
[1:19:04] asked of us because in our failure it
[1:19:07] magnifies his grace
[1:19:10] and the grace of God is sufficient for
[1:19:12] all of our needs
[1:19:14] amen hallelujah
[1:19:16] oh and it is my brother and sister no
[1:19:19] matter whether we are small or great God
[1:19:21] says I want to hear a little praise from
[1:19:23] you I want to hear a little Thanksgiving
[1:19:25] from you I want it to be your voice that
[1:19:29] comes and you realize in this scripture
[1:19:31] here the voice of that multitude is you
[1:19:35] amen God's not got a voice machine
[1:19:37] somewhere he doesn't have a choir hid
[1:19:40] behind a curtain he's got a bride that
[1:19:42] is the voice that is the multitude that
[1:19:45] is recorded in Revelation 19. it's my
[1:19:48] voice it's your voice can we be the
[1:19:52] Fulfillment of the voice that comes as a
[1:19:55] great thundering of a multitude of
[1:19:57] people
[1:19:58] oh help us oh Lord
[1:20:01] Hallelujah Revelations 22 17 says in the
[1:20:05] spirit and the bride say come amen
[1:20:08] there's got to be an echo
[1:20:11] I'm telling you there's got to be an
[1:20:12] echo my brother and sister the bride's
[1:20:14] not out here
[1:20:24] Lord I told them that they didn't listen
[1:20:27] no sir The Voice
[1:20:30] has an echo
[1:20:31] that comes a great multitude
[1:20:35] that is saying come amen come this is
[1:20:39] life come
[1:20:43] not a voice of human
[1:20:46] condemning human
[1:20:47] commanding human
[1:20:49] but the spirit is speaking and it's the
[1:20:53] bride's voice that they're hearing amen
[1:20:56] oh thank you Lord
[1:20:58] Hallelujah and what are they going to
[1:20:59] say let them hear us say come and let
[1:21:03] him that's a thirst come and whosoever
[1:21:05] will let him take over the Water of Life
[1:21:07] freely amen no limitation
[1:21:09] how beautiful God is
[1:21:11] how beautiful God is
[1:21:14] amen now you see there's got to be a
[1:21:17] voice that was designated to be the
[1:21:19] voice of this multitude and my brother
[1:21:21] and sister it may be coming from our
[1:21:23] lips but I'm here to tell you just as
[1:21:25] God's been laying on my heart and I've
[1:21:27] been studying this God hears the hearts
[1:21:29] cry when we deal in our own little
[1:21:31] personal world right we all have our own
[1:21:33] little personal world when we're living
[1:21:35] in our own little personal World God is
[1:21:38] moving you and I maybe a midnight hour
[1:21:41] maybe early in the morning late at night
[1:21:43] at noon time that there's a cry from the
[1:21:46] heart of the believer there's a heart my
[1:21:49] brother and sister that's in there it
[1:21:51] might be a Stony heart at the moment but
[1:21:54] it's softening it might be a heart
[1:21:56] that's starting to soften but it needs
[1:21:58] to soften more maybe it's a heart that's
[1:22:00] right on the verge of being completely
[1:22:02] soft but just needs that one last little
[1:22:05] touch that voice is coming to the throne
[1:22:07] of almighty God and God says I hear you
[1:22:10] and I know what you need and I'm the
[1:22:12] great physician and I will prescribe it
[1:22:14] exactly what you need and it will change
[1:22:16] your life
[1:22:18] oh we say but we're all believers
[1:22:20] brother Paul I'm telling you I've seen
[1:22:22] some pretty Stony hearts in Believers
[1:22:25] and I'm going to tell you how Stony
[1:22:27] those hearts are I can tell you the very
[1:22:29] nature of their heart I can tell you
[1:22:31] that sometimes they'll profess their
[1:22:33] heart is soft when it's not oh that's
[1:22:35] judgmental Paul no it is and I was
[1:22:37] talking about me
[1:22:40] hmm
[1:22:43] and the word came
[1:22:46] and it washed over me and it washed over
[1:22:49] me and it washed over me it washed over
[1:22:51] me as the sea is on the rocks or the CHL
[1:22:55] on the beach my brother and sister just
[1:22:57] keeps ruashing over washing over and
[1:23:00] what is it doing it's not judging us in
[1:23:03] the sense that people say don't judge me
[1:23:04] don't judge me but it's judging us that
[1:23:07] we ourselves can see I need wash some
[1:23:09] more Lord wash me some more Lord I need
[1:23:12] some more Lord I want to come look I'm
[1:23:15] not going to show up at the marriage of
[1:23:17] the lamb in some kind of filthy work
[1:23:19] clothes I'm not going to show up my
[1:23:22] brother and sister
[1:23:23] oh well we won't go there I'll get
[1:23:25] sidetracked on that amen but there see
[1:23:27] what it is the the coming from our lips
[1:23:30] what is it sometimes it's nothing more
[1:23:32] than our hearts cry it's nothing more
[1:23:35] than what down inside of us we're
[1:23:37] groaning
[1:23:38] but the Holy Ghost can interpret that
[1:23:41] groaning
[1:23:42] sometimes you know I get caught up I'll
[1:23:45] get caught up in thinking of of
[1:23:47] situations I won't say they're all
[1:23:49] problems but you're trying to do that
[1:23:51] and and you know maybe I just hold my
[1:23:54] breath a little bit too long and I sigh
[1:23:56] and Jerry's like what what's the sigh
[1:23:58] about I do the same thing to her she
[1:24:00] sighs I'm what was a sigh about but
[1:24:03] sometimes my brother and sister it's
[1:24:05] just letting go of attention it's just
[1:24:08] letting go of something and there's a
[1:24:09] side that comes in the release of that
[1:24:12] and letting it go and it's there that no
[1:24:15] one can understand I asked Jerry you
[1:24:17] know what was the sigh about and she's
[1:24:19] like I sighed
[1:24:22] I do the same thing
[1:24:25] what was that about I I don't know but
[1:24:28] I'll tell you when you sigh in this
[1:24:30] Spirit the Holy Ghost is there to
[1:24:32] interpret that sigh and to say I see the
[1:24:35] heart is burden I see the heart has
[1:24:37] desire I see the heart is longing and I
[1:24:41] understand what they're longing for and
[1:24:44] they come and then the word of God comes
[1:24:47] now you want to know where the idea of
[1:24:48] YouTube and on these other online type
[1:24:51] things come where you'll be we've seen
[1:24:53] it it's a little bit spooky you take
[1:24:55] your phone amen this is my napkin phone
[1:24:58] hanky phone and you'll have your phone
[1:25:01] and you'll be talking about you know
[1:25:02] what brothers we really should organize
[1:25:04] a Brother's fishing group
[1:25:06] the sisters are having their little
[1:25:08] social where they go house to house when
[1:25:10] they remember
[1:25:11] and um
[1:25:14] us Brothers we really ought to organize
[1:25:16] a Brother's fishing
[1:25:18] and five minutes later you'll pick your
[1:25:20] phone up I'm a little older fashion than
[1:25:22] some of you I'm not really but it's my
[1:25:24] flip phone
[1:25:26] and you'll look online there and
[1:25:28] there'll be 25 different things about
[1:25:30] fishing on your phone it's scary
[1:25:32] how do you know we were talking about
[1:25:34] fishing
[1:25:35] now my brother and sister
[1:25:38] we think the devil designed that
[1:25:44] but the prophet of God said that science
[1:25:46] broke into God's Laboratory
[1:25:49] and when we start to express from our
[1:25:51] heart we start to express the things of
[1:25:54] God
[1:25:55] that's why maybe our fellowship should
[1:25:57] be less about carnal things and more
[1:25:58] about spiritual things and let the Holy
[1:26:01] Spirit comes down and discerns that of
[1:26:04] what we're speaking
[1:26:06] you know I've got this little Affliction
[1:26:08] in my flesh I need prayer
[1:26:11] holy spirit says I'll just come and I'll
[1:26:13] anoint
[1:26:14] all anoint and people might wake up at
[1:26:17] midnight hour
[1:26:18] amen I'll tell you what my brother and
[1:26:21] sister God knows how to wake it up and
[1:26:23] bring the prayers to the throne amen
[1:26:25] he's not missed out on one thing he
[1:26:28] hears the hearts cry he brings right
[1:26:30] down exactly what is needed many times
[1:26:33] in this church people have said that's
[1:26:35] exactly what we were reading yesterday
[1:26:37] or talking about or the scripture I read
[1:26:40] this morning oh God bless you brother
[1:26:42] Paul but my brother and sister don't you
[1:26:44] understand it was the Holy Ghost that
[1:26:47] heard your heart cry and said I'm going
[1:26:50] to send an answer right here because the
[1:26:53] preacher will be oblivious
[1:26:55] but the Holy Ghost has discerned that
[1:26:57] because he knows what you need
[1:27:01] oh thank you Lord
[1:27:03] Hallelujah and you know my brother and
[1:27:06] sister it's the voice of the Bride that
[1:27:09] calls the bridegroom it's a voice of the
[1:27:12] Bride that calls the master amen it's
[1:27:15] not the heathens Voice using his name in
[1:27:17] vain is not the voice that he's hearing
[1:27:20] he's hearing a bride's voice when she
[1:27:23] calls on her beloved he's hearing her
[1:27:25] and says is that not a beautiful sound
[1:27:28] and her prayers come as a sweet odor
[1:27:31] before me praise God oh Hallelujah
[1:27:35] oh Hallelujah
[1:27:38] amen now look I'll tell you
[1:27:41] sometimes weddings can be quite the deal
[1:27:45] sometimes weddings can be a lot of work
[1:27:48] I've heard people after they got married
[1:27:50] says you know brother Paul
[1:27:52] if it wasn't frowned on we would have
[1:27:54] just went to the justice of peace
[1:27:55] because it's getting married is a lot of
[1:27:57] work and it's a lot of money
[1:28:00] imagine that
[1:28:06] but I'm telling you you never heard any
[1:28:07] Holy Ghost filled dad till his daughter
[1:28:10] just go to the Justice of the Peace
[1:28:15] what he wants to do is he wants to see
[1:28:17] his beautiful daughter
[1:28:19] coming
[1:28:20] in the beauty
[1:28:22] of marriage
[1:28:25] and we've been called
[1:28:27] to a marriage
[1:28:29] it's a beautiful thing my brother and
[1:28:31] sister come on let's be honest it can be
[1:28:33] a lot of work yeah it can be a lot of
[1:28:35] work a lot of Labor amen a lot of miles
[1:28:37] a lot of weary times a lot of things
[1:28:40] happen along the road but the marriage
[1:28:42] is beautiful and the marriage my brother
[1:28:45] and sister it's much more than just a
[1:28:47] legal document it is a relationship
[1:28:50] built in the depths of a heart and soul
[1:28:53] amen it is a connection of two souls and
[1:28:56] I'll put it to you this way connection
[1:28:58] of two souls and us being connected to
[1:29:02] our bridegroom amen not an official
[1:29:04] paper we can hang it on the wall I
[1:29:07] joined this we were just looking at a
[1:29:08] deal the other day a certain church and
[1:29:11] that's like how do you know Jerry looks
[1:29:12] it up how do you become a member of the
[1:29:14] blah blah blah church and so it comes up
[1:29:16] there and they have shockingly enough we
[1:29:18] not might need to work on our membership
[1:29:20] thing we have uh well anyway they have
[1:29:23] about 10 or 12 pages
[1:29:25] and they got places for you to initial
[1:29:27] at each one of these places that you are
[1:29:29] lined up with this and then you have to
[1:29:31] give up stand up and give a declaration
[1:29:34] to the church that you agree with every
[1:29:36] one of these and will stand in support
[1:29:38] and can be corrected if you don't
[1:29:46] and I'm sure that that 10 or 12 Pages
[1:29:48] causes those people to be righteous and
[1:29:52] holy
[1:29:57] but I tell you what causes them to be
[1:29:59] righteous and holy
[1:30:01] is that marriage vow
[1:30:04] being part of that marriage
[1:30:07] recognizing I'm no longer me I am him
[1:30:11] amen it's no longer about me it's all
[1:30:13] about him
[1:30:15] and my heart's desire is to please him
[1:30:18] oh Hallelujah
[1:30:23] yeah let me say it again it's your voice
[1:30:25] the voice of your heart that calls the
[1:30:27] master
[1:30:28] now look at this I need to just move
[1:30:30] right along
[1:30:31] amen
[1:30:33] invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[1:30:38] brother Gideon take that down real quick
[1:30:39] before too many read it
[1:30:44] you know one of our problems
[1:30:48] we're too worried
[1:30:50] about what people think
[1:30:57] that's one of our problems
[1:30:59] right and if you're sitting there saying
[1:31:00] well I don't think it's my problem well
[1:31:02] I'm here to be just direct enough to say
[1:31:05] I'll guarantee it is
[1:31:11] we're worried
[1:31:14] about what others think of us
[1:31:19] and sometimes
[1:31:21] we're worried about the man that's the
[1:31:23] cashier at the hardware store
[1:31:25] that takes the lord's name in vain
[1:31:28] 50 75 hundred times a day
[1:31:32] and we're concerned about how he'll feel
[1:31:34] about us
[1:31:40] go ahead and put it up brother Gideon
[1:31:45] what will the Joneses think if I go to
[1:31:47] crying and speaking in tongue oh they
[1:31:50] think if I'm re-baptized what a nonsense
[1:31:53] are you married to the Joneses
[1:31:58] or are you married to the church
[1:32:01] or are you married to Christ the word
[1:32:06] I'll tell you what my brother and sister
[1:32:08] my wife has never went out to the store
[1:32:11] and asked some male Clerk or cash here
[1:32:13] what do you think of my clothes is that
[1:32:16] do I look okay like this no she's
[1:32:18] married to someone and that someone is
[1:32:21] the one whose opinion matters to her
[1:32:24] and the church talking about the
[1:32:26] Believers my brother and sister we're
[1:32:28] not going to go to the denomination and
[1:32:30] ask them if they like our Doctrine or
[1:32:32] not amen we're not married to them we're
[1:32:35] married to Christ and all we care about
[1:32:38] is his opinion uh his word his desire
[1:32:42] his heart's love being poured out to us
[1:32:45] it's not to the rest of this world
[1:32:48] amen but we get careful about this oh I
[1:32:51] don't want to say or do something well
[1:32:53] I'll tell you what I live in a world
[1:32:55] where a lot of farmers unfortunately
[1:32:57] just not to not too religious and I have
[1:33:00] a reputation out in our area about to be
[1:33:03] in that religious farmer guy amen you
[1:33:05] know the guys will be like you know
[1:33:07] what's it like being a farmer and a
[1:33:09] pastor almost like if I was a farmer
[1:33:12] that that is a contradiction to being a
[1:33:14] pastor or vice versa I just tell them
[1:33:17] out there you know what you ought not
[1:33:19] use the lord's name in vain because what
[1:33:21] you're doing is blaming your problems on
[1:33:24] God and your problems were created by
[1:33:26] you and you want to get your life
[1:33:28] straightened out so your problem will
[1:33:30] not think in your mind it's God's
[1:33:32] problem
[1:33:36] okay Paul
[1:33:39] I hear a lot
[1:33:41] I hear a lot of this
[1:33:44] they'll start
[1:33:48] pardon my French Paul
[1:33:50] that did not sound like French
[1:33:55] had not one bit
[1:33:57] of a French accent
[1:34:02] but the point being Saints if we will
[1:34:05] stand
[1:34:06] with the one who redeemed us the one who
[1:34:11] has our soul
[1:34:13] if we'll stand the world will notice
[1:34:16] but if we don't stand at all
[1:34:21] it's not really the direction we're
[1:34:22] going so I'll just I'll just leave that
[1:34:24] be
[1:34:25] so who we married to church
[1:34:28] yeah
[1:34:29] amen thank you brother
[1:34:31] amen what is this all about
[1:34:35] now this can be a subject that you can
[1:34:37] say it's already happened or it's
[1:34:39] happening we're not here to to dissect
[1:34:42] uh the schematic of this but my brother
[1:34:45] and sister what it's all about is our
[1:34:47] pending marriage
[1:34:49] now some would say now according to the
[1:34:51] word we're already yes I understand that
[1:34:52] but I'm making just a point here what is
[1:34:54] this about our pending marriage amen
[1:34:57] this is all about us coming see it tells
[1:35:00] us verse 7 to be glad and rejoice and
[1:35:02] give honor for the marriages come
[1:35:04] and his wife have made herself ready
[1:35:08] I'm telling you what reminds me I've
[1:35:10] been to a wedding or two in my life you
[1:35:12] know
[1:35:13] and uh nobody's really happy with the
[1:35:16] bride
[1:35:17] if at the time the wedding's supposed to
[1:35:19] start
[1:35:20] she's still trying to figure out which
[1:35:22] pair of shoes she's wearing
[1:35:24] under a dress that touches the floor so
[1:35:26] no one sees the shoes
[1:35:29] it seems like a irrelevant decision
[1:35:33] in fact I know a young lady got married
[1:35:35] here in just the last couple years
[1:35:36] nobody had a clue but after the wedding
[1:35:39] there believe her she wasn't in Boston
[1:35:42] or anything but when they started to
[1:35:43] take pictures she reaches down and pulls
[1:35:46] her wedding dress up just far enough
[1:35:48] she's wearing cowboy boots
[1:35:54] and I've been to a wedding where the
[1:35:56] dress was long
[1:35:58] and when it was all over
[1:36:00] somebody said something about you've
[1:36:02] been standing for hours now your feet
[1:36:03] must be killing you she pulled her dress
[1:36:06] up she had no shoes at all on
[1:36:11] hmm
[1:36:12] my
[1:36:15] my brother and sister
[1:36:17] we're getting ready
[1:36:19] for a wedding
[1:36:22] now you won't find
[1:36:24] a reference here in Revelations 19 about
[1:36:28] the shoes they're wearing
[1:36:30] but the scripture does say that our feet
[1:36:32] would be shawed with the gospel
[1:36:35] amen
[1:36:37] there's where it really comes down the
[1:36:39] gospel
[1:36:40] so if we don't have the gospel where are
[1:36:42] we walking
[1:36:43] now I'm I'm purposely jumping over some
[1:36:45] of this so you can fill in some of the
[1:36:47] blanks yourself
[1:36:48] now my brother and sisters I've already
[1:36:50] went what is rehearsal time it's when
[1:36:52] all the wrinkles are worked out
[1:36:54] hey man it's when all of that you have
[1:36:57] to decide you know I remember being at a
[1:37:00] wedding one time or at a rehearsal and
[1:37:01] they had all these cute little cute
[1:37:03] little candle things their aisle was
[1:37:05] probably no bigger than our Church's
[1:37:07] aisle these cute little candle stands at
[1:37:09] every row amen and nobody give it a
[1:37:11] thought until the morning of the wedding
[1:37:13] and here comes this young lady who's got
[1:37:16] a dress that is so wide and so there
[1:37:19] that there is a couple little girls have
[1:37:21] to hold on to the back of it because she
[1:37:23] can't drag it
[1:37:25] and they started in the back of the
[1:37:27] church and the first set of candle
[1:37:28] holders
[1:37:29] and then that can set a candle holders
[1:37:32] and they had to stop and do a little
[1:37:34] revision right there that's what
[1:37:35] rehearsal's for
[1:37:36] amen when God calls this bride and she's
[1:37:39] responding to the call and he's not
[1:37:41] looking for her to stop and say we've
[1:37:43] got to re uh what is that re uh
[1:37:47] calculate or whatever you know when your
[1:37:48] computer does this little thing amen he
[1:37:51] wants us to work this out he wants us to
[1:37:53] be ready he wants us to think of every
[1:37:55] detail and the manual that he gave us to
[1:37:58] be ready for the marriage has every
[1:38:00] detail in it so that we are not there
[1:38:03] saying I didn't know I didn't realize I
[1:38:06] didn't see it's all there now my brother
[1:38:09] and sister let me skip on here time is
[1:38:11] just flying amen hallelujah what was it
[1:38:14] that she was granted to be a raid in
[1:38:17] fine linen amen and not some grubby old
[1:38:21] uh dress to be drug in the dirt right
[1:38:24] but fine linen clean and white for fine
[1:38:26] linen is a righteousness of the Saints
[1:38:30] and I'm telling you what this message
[1:38:31] has come what it's done and I hope this
[1:38:34] doesn't hurt anybody's feelings but my
[1:38:36] brother and sister if you want to know
[1:38:38] how to get yourself ready for this
[1:38:40] marriage you go and read God's tutorial

[1:40:14] oh once again I want to say can we say
[1:40:16] we're blessed this morning amen I'll
[1:40:19] tell you it's a blessing according to
[1:40:21] the scripture verse 9 that you're
[1:40:23] blessed just because you're called to
[1:40:25] this marriage
[1:40:26] I'm going to say Thank you Lord I feel
[1:40:28] blessed this morning
[1:40:30] oh it's been stirring in my soul I might
[1:40:32] seem a little over excited excuse me but
[1:40:35] when I wake up in the morning realizing
[1:40:37] I am blessed not every day is a good day
[1:40:42] my brother and sister I won't go into
[1:40:43] details but yesterday I was trying to
[1:40:45] fix something you know and and as I'm
[1:40:48] trying to fix something I broke
[1:40:51] something that cost 10 times as much
[1:40:53] money
[1:40:58] and we could just call that normal
[1:41:02] or I could sit down and say
[1:41:04] ah the devil did that
[1:41:07] it wasn't the devil that had his hands
[1:41:09] on that don't call me the devil
[1:41:16] come on
[1:41:17] God must be angry at me he allowed that
[1:41:20] to happen
[1:41:22] no
[1:41:24] if I ever have to go to that again
[1:41:28] I will remember
[1:41:30] don't do that
[1:41:35] come on somebody can say Amen
[1:41:38] yeah what is it this is rehearsal time
[1:41:43] amen I'll tell you what happened just
[1:41:45] let me go through this little personal
[1:41:46] tidbit of things you don't do at
[1:41:48] marriages I was a little kid I was
[1:41:50] invited to a marriage Margaret Taylor's
[1:41:53] amen and I'm there and that everybody's
[1:41:55] all excited when they come out and
[1:41:57] they're presenting them out in the yard
[1:41:59] and a kid behind me shoved me and I lost
[1:42:02] my balance and I stepped on Margaret's
[1:42:04] wedding dress and tore it
[1:42:07] Margaret's never forgot it and neither
[1:42:09] have I
[1:42:11] there are some things you don't do and
[1:42:14] one thing I will never do and don't do
[1:42:16] to this day is when the bride is walking
[1:42:19] with her dress I'm moving the other
[1:42:21] direction amen because I am not going to
[1:42:24] get pushed by someone and leave my
[1:42:27] footprint on her dress
[1:42:29] what is it my fault
[1:42:33] only reason it'd be my fault is I was
[1:42:35] there
[1:42:37] and I got too close but what's wrong
[1:42:39] they were
[1:42:40] dozens and dozens of people too close
[1:42:45] I hope you catch this
[1:42:47] but all those dozens and dozens
[1:42:50] I was the only one that lost his balance
[1:42:54] and stepped on her dress
[1:42:58] now whoever it was behind me
[1:43:00] I was upset I was gonna tear into him
[1:43:04] only there's a bunch of faces
[1:43:09] and it wasn't until after I got over
[1:43:11] being ashamed
[1:43:13] that I comprehended that it was my fault
[1:43:18] nobody else's footprint yeah
[1:43:22] yeah and when I broke what I broke
[1:43:23] yesterday
[1:43:25] it would have been easy to say oh devil
[1:43:30] but I'm the one that had the tool hooked
[1:43:31] on that thing was wrenching on it
[1:43:34] my brother and sister
[1:43:37] sometimes we got to just learn
[1:43:39] we're in the rehearsal
[1:43:41] and God's working these things out
[1:43:45] I don't want to make this about me but I
[1:43:47] want to make this point some time back
[1:43:48] there was a man in our shop while we're
[1:43:50] working
[1:43:51] I smashed my thumb to where it turned
[1:43:53] absolutely black and blue and had a big
[1:43:55] blood blister on the end
[1:43:57] and when I did that I jerked my hand
[1:44:00] back and I grunted
[1:44:02] and this man standing there
[1:44:06] and kind of mockingly but yet in a
[1:44:08] friendly way he goes
[1:44:10] Paul I know you don't talk like that do
[1:44:12] I need to supply the words for you
[1:44:17] no
[1:44:19] no the grunt
[1:44:22] the grunt was enough
[1:44:24] the grunt expressed everything I needed
[1:44:28] expressed
[1:44:30] and sometimes just a simple
[1:44:34] Lord help me
[1:44:36] help me Lord
[1:44:38] expresses everything we need to express
[1:44:44] because the Holy Ghost is there to say I
[1:44:48] know how you feel I know the pain in
[1:44:51] your heart I know the pain in your life
[1:44:52] I know the pain of your circumstance
[1:44:57] hmm
[1:45:01] well I had more stuff here than I
[1:45:02] thought I literally thought man we'll be
[1:45:04] out of here sister Jerry tells me at
[1:45:06] home don't ever say that again
[1:45:09] I want to make a real quick point to you
[1:45:11] I'm going to just bounce through this if
[1:45:13] you don't catch it raise your hand amen
[1:45:14] but we look at John 1 right now John 1
[1:45:17] is laying the whole Foundation that in
[1:45:20] the beginning was the word and the Word
[1:45:21] was with God and the Word was God right
[1:45:24] so it gives us a very clear
[1:45:25] establishment of the relationship of the
[1:45:28] written word and our God Amen and so
[1:45:32] it's there that we can identify and do
[1:45:34] this and this is why uh Acts 2 38 is
[1:45:37] brought to life amen that we can look at
[1:45:39] Matthew 28 19 and say absolutely I
[1:45:42] believe 28 19. now if you're ever
[1:45:44] talking to a trinitarian and they get
[1:45:46] stumbled when you say I believe every
[1:45:48] drop of Matthew 28 19 because they
[1:45:50] believe if you believe Acts 2 38 you
[1:45:53] must be rejecting acts uh Matthew 28 19
[1:45:56] but actually it's quite the opposite
[1:45:57] amen so Satan has put the spin on this
[1:46:01] flip this over made it sound like if you
[1:46:03] don't believe 28 19 like they do that
[1:46:07] somehow you're denying the word of God
[1:46:08] but my brother and sister it's quite the
[1:46:10] opposite now we'll see now this
[1:46:13] establishment that the word is God and
[1:46:16] God is the word and verse 14 says that
[1:46:19] the word was made Flash and dwelt Among
[1:46:22] Us amen and I tell you by the prophecy
[1:46:24] of the word in our hour amen the opening
[1:46:27] of the seventh seal we are not to add
[1:46:29] one word to the Bible but I want to add
[1:46:31] one word to your understanding and when
[1:46:33] it says that the word was made flesh and
[1:46:36] dwelt among us we could put a
[1:46:38] parenthesis and the Word was made flesh
[1:46:41] and dwelt in US amen that's what the
[1:46:45] whole goal the whole desire of God was
[1:46:47] for the word to be in us and we'll look
[1:46:50] at that and say my okay there it is this
[1:46:53] is the time this is a place uh God in us
[1:46:55] amen there it is but look the word has
[1:46:58] already been with us and you look at
[1:47:01] this now to see the expression of this
[1:47:03] would be first John 1 and so we went
[1:47:06] from John 1 to First John 1 that which
[1:47:09] was from the beginning hmm not in a
[1:47:13] recent understanding not in the current
[1:47:15] Revelation that we just got but thou was
[1:47:18] from the beginning which we have heard
[1:47:20] and we have seen we've looked upon it
[1:47:24] our hands have handled it
[1:47:27] the word of life
[1:47:29] oh my my brother and sister what is this
[1:47:31] all the way out of the Book of
[1:47:33] Revelation which is the culmination or
[1:47:35] closing of the age and time the word is
[1:47:37] telling us you've already seen him
[1:47:40] already handled him you've already had
[1:47:43] him in your midst he's already with you
[1:47:45] it's already done it's not an appearing
[1:47:48] here in Matthew 19 or in Matthew 20 2
[1:47:51] he's already here it's already been
[1:47:54] manifested to us and we have seen the
[1:47:56] word of life and it's been visible
[1:47:59] before us
[1:48:00] oh thank you Lord
[1:48:03] hallelujah hallelujah we're coming right
[1:48:07] down to the end here I got kind of a
[1:48:08] lengthy little lengthy little reading
[1:48:11] here is that okay
[1:48:13] Amen in communion 1965 12 12 65 prophets
[1:48:19] very close to going off scene
[1:48:24] kind of sad he went off the scene didn't
[1:48:25] he
[1:48:27] 1965 1212. I would have been four years
[1:48:32] and five days old
[1:48:40] and if he was still alive today
[1:48:43] we
[1:48:45] would be such an immature
[1:48:48] bride
[1:48:54] brother Brian was it okay if I buy a red
[1:48:55] car
[1:48:59] brother Brandon what about this
[1:49:01] brother Brown what about that
[1:49:03] brother brother Brown was it would it be
[1:49:06] wrong to invest in a business and
[1:49:08] somehow end up rich
[1:49:11] what about brother brother
[1:49:15] brother
[1:49:16] Brown
[1:49:17] of course don't worry about it you'd
[1:49:18] never talk to him because they would be
[1:49:20] about 2.7 million people in front of you
[1:49:26] are you getting my point
[1:49:30] God said I've given you the word
[1:49:33] now it's time bride grow up
[1:49:40] Lord I want to grow up
[1:49:42] yes sir I want your wisdom I want your
[1:49:45] nature I want your life I want
[1:49:46] revelation
[1:49:48] amen yeah and sometimes we have to go
[1:49:51] dig for those things they don't just
[1:49:52] appear to us
[1:49:55] you know the hour will soon arise when
[1:49:57] right Among Us will be the holy spirit
[1:49:59] will speak out like it did and ananias
[1:50:01] and Sapphira now I want to just put a
[1:50:03] little word in my brother and sister
[1:50:06] Grace Tabernacle
[1:50:07] put your seat belt on
[1:50:09] because that day is coming amen
[1:50:12] amen it's already starting to work
[1:50:14] it's already not necessarily out into
[1:50:17] the public but God is already dealing in
[1:50:20] the church so Direct
[1:50:22] that people are realizing that was me
[1:50:26] you know we usually do quite the
[1:50:28] opposite can I have just a couple more
[1:50:29] minutes we usually do quite the opposite
[1:50:32] the preacher starts preaching kind of
[1:50:34] hard and we're like well why why is he
[1:50:38] preaching to me like that uh uh
[1:50:46] when the holy spirit moves
[1:50:48] and starts to speak out like it did in
[1:50:50] ananiasis fire
[1:50:53] there's going to be a bride
[1:50:55] that actually says
[1:50:57] Lord I needed that
[1:51:00] Lord that distort the height off of me
[1:51:02] but Lord I needed that
[1:51:04] help me
[1:51:08] help me and then there'll be those that
[1:51:09] get angry
[1:51:12] and walk away
[1:51:15] you notice what
[1:51:17] ananias and Sapphira they were actually
[1:51:20] given the window
[1:51:23] the moment of time
[1:51:25] almost like the policeman would you like
[1:51:28] to change
[1:51:30] your story
[1:51:32] no
[1:51:35] then why
[1:51:37] is there blood on your clothes when you
[1:51:39] say you had nothing to do with it
[1:51:42] but you see once they give them the
[1:51:44] opportunity to change the story
[1:51:46] and that time that door is closed
[1:51:49] then everything they say is held against
[1:51:51] us
[1:51:52] and God loves this bride so much he's
[1:51:55] bringing us in the rehearsal time the
[1:51:59] ability to stop and say Lord I want to
[1:52:02] change the directive of my life amen I
[1:52:06] want to change my story from what a
[1:52:08] drunk I was what are this I was and what
[1:52:10] of that I was I want to change it so
[1:52:13] when the Holy Ghost comes my brother and
[1:52:14] sister and says would you like to change
[1:52:16] your story don't be thinking somebody's
[1:52:18] trying to trick you stand up lift your
[1:52:20] hands and say Lord I want to change my
[1:52:23] story I want my story to be one of grace
[1:52:26] and mercy I want a story to be one of
[1:52:29] the blood flowing over me of a life
[1:52:31] consecrated that I can say not
[1:52:34] boastfully but Lord thank you for the
[1:52:36] fine linen thank you Lord that I can
[1:52:39] show up at the wedding at the marriage
[1:52:41] supper not looking like a hobo not out
[1:52:44] here with a filth of the alleys of
[1:52:46] laodicea but in clothes that are perfect
[1:52:49] and spotless before God
[1:52:51] oh Hallelujah
[1:52:53] amen now the hours arriving see now just
[1:52:57] remember that see God is going to dwell
[1:52:58] among his people see this is a
[1:53:00] consequence my brother and sister I use
[1:53:03] the word consequence but I believe you
[1:53:04] understand what I'm talking about we say
[1:53:06] Lord will you come dwell amongst us do
[1:53:08] we not Saints do we not ask the Lord
[1:53:10] come be in the service with us today
[1:53:12] amen and when we ask him to be in the
[1:53:15] service with us today we were asking him
[1:53:17] to point out our faults and our failure
[1:53:20] to point out but he's standing there
[1:53:22] saying this is a problem and here is my
[1:53:26] blood and it's the solution
[1:53:28] don't run from this run into it
[1:53:32] oh Hallelujah
[1:53:35] see God's going to dwell among his
[1:53:36] people that's what he wants to do now
[1:53:39] and we can receive the message as saying
[1:53:41] if I was a young man hunting for a wife
[1:53:43] I could find a wife I say she's just
[1:53:45] perfect she's Christian she's a lady
[1:53:48] she's all this confidence no matter how
[1:53:50] much confidence how much I think she's
[1:53:52] nice I've got to receive her
[1:53:56] and she's got to receive me upon these
[1:54:00] vows
[1:54:02] I don't think it'd be very funny my
[1:54:04] brother and sister
[1:54:05] as a Young Man
[1:54:07] let me just throw something out okay
[1:54:09] let me get this off my chest
[1:54:13] I see people
[1:54:16] at the second greatest blessing
[1:54:19] God would ever give a man or a woman in
[1:54:21] their life
[1:54:25] second greatest blessing the first is
[1:54:27] receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:54:30] and make mockery of their weddings
[1:54:33] shoving cake in faces doing all kinds of
[1:54:36] antics young people
[1:54:38] the Lord tarries I know the day will
[1:54:40] come
[1:54:42] please
[1:54:43] don't make an End tick don't make a show
[1:54:46] out of your marriage
[1:54:48] amen amen it's a very solemn thing to be
[1:54:50] enjoyed of oppressed memory
[1:54:54] and I'll just back it up with a little
[1:54:56] story of a man I knew when they got
[1:54:58] married they just it's like a bunch out
[1:55:00] of control uh message people
[1:55:03] and they just smashed cake in each
[1:55:05] other's face like you can't believe oh
[1:55:07] here's the cake and they're like
[1:55:08] remember what we agreed and he just
[1:55:10] smashed it in her face
[1:55:12] and then you could see her have a little
[1:55:13] temper tantrum
[1:55:15] and she smashed it in his face
[1:55:18] if you is to go to their house today you
[1:55:20] will not find a single picture
[1:55:24] of the cake
[1:55:27] because they're ashamed
[1:55:30] they're not proud they don't look back
[1:55:32] and say oh look what we did
[1:55:35] now they recognize the value of the
[1:55:40] vowel and of the marriage
[1:55:42] and realize
[1:55:44] that was symbolic
[1:55:47] of our relationship with God
[1:55:50] does that know what the word says
[1:55:53] natural marriage is symbolic of our
[1:55:55] relationship with God
[1:55:57] oh yeah God
[1:56:00] just just take it
[1:56:04] come on
[1:56:06] young people I hope this registers deep
[1:56:08] in your soul
[1:56:10] young ladies don't marry a man that make
[1:56:12] that kind of a mockery out of your
[1:56:13] wedding and young men don't marry a
[1:56:15] young lady that would make that kind of
[1:56:17] mockery out of your marriage might be
[1:56:19] the right guy just not right season
[1:56:21] maybe just need to grow up
[1:56:23] amen now I'll take the sting out of that
[1:56:26] sister Jerry and I have concluded that
[1:56:28] if we had waited about four years more
[1:56:30] to get married I would have been grown
[1:56:32] up
[1:56:33] so you look at this and realize but
[1:56:36] there's a maturity amen amen that comes
[1:56:40] that places value
[1:56:43] immaturity doesn't place value maturity
[1:56:47] places value I'll get all sidetracked
[1:56:50] see this young man hunting for a wife
[1:56:53] amen she's got to accept him and he's
[1:56:56] got to accept her well it's the same
[1:56:58] thing we find is the message we see it's
[1:57:01] right we see God vindicates it's right
[1:57:03] it's perfectly right year after year
[1:57:05] year after year and my brother and
[1:57:07] sister the critic would say brother
[1:57:09] Branham was boasting of his own Ministry
[1:57:10] I'm here to tell you year after year
[1:57:13] year after year year after year God is
[1:57:17] proving this to be true
[1:57:18] proving it to be real it's valid and
[1:57:21] it's powerful it's a supernatural
[1:57:24] amen either that I'm completely crazy
[1:57:27] and don't have a clue
[1:57:30] no comments
[1:57:32] because I know that I am sane
[1:57:34] and I have seen the power of God
[1:57:36] Vindicated in my own little world
[1:57:43] yeah remember Great and Small
[1:57:45] I'm not ashamed to say I'm one of those
[1:57:47] small ones
[1:57:48] but the same power of the word come to
[1:57:52] the small one amen has come to the great
[1:57:55] amen
[1:57:56] amen
[1:57:59] amen okay
[1:58:01] it continues right continues right
[1:58:03] everything it says happens just exactly
[1:58:05] the way he said amen now we know it's
[1:58:09] right but see don't do it from an
[1:58:11] intellectual standpoint if you do you've
[1:58:13] got a second-handed religion see we
[1:58:17] don't want a second-handed religion
[1:58:18] something that somebody else has
[1:58:20] experienced and we are living off of
[1:58:22] their testimony I'm telling you I'm
[1:58:24] going to just throw this out I was just
[1:58:26] very temperate about saying this but I'm
[1:58:27] going to we have seen men in this
[1:58:30] message who have quit men that were
[1:58:32] ministers men that had at times in their
[1:58:35] life very very uh profound good
[1:58:37] beneficial Ministries but you'll find in
[1:58:40] the relationship of their life they
[1:58:43] often were anchored in spoke of spoke
[1:58:46] highly of the ministry of their fathers
[1:58:57] what they had was second hand
[1:59:01] and when the ministry of their fathers
[1:59:03] who were off the scene
[1:59:05] ran out
[1:59:06] they had nothing
[1:59:09] to make the next step
[1:59:11] now how many of you we experienced this
[1:59:14] a little bit in Israel
[1:59:15] amen some of those hikes we took
[1:59:19] I'm sitting there you know I'm thinking
[1:59:22] why in the world did I sign up for I
[1:59:24] paid brother George money
[1:59:27] to do this
[1:59:30] now none of you say a word to the cops

[2:12:24] I think it took me about 900 miles to
[2:12:27] explain it to him
[2:12:28] [Music]
[2:12:36] and it broke my heart
[2:12:40] then he just turned at the end of the
[2:12:43] day
[2:12:45] and said Paul

[2:16:22] rest of this
[2:16:23] last quote
[2:16:25] I just want to say this in closing not
[2:16:27] as condemnation
[2:16:29] but the prophet of God goes on to say
[2:16:31] and this is why we take communion
[2:16:33] because it is a person
[2:16:37] relationship a personal revelation
[2:16:42] with Jesus Christ I want to encourage
[2:16:46] each and every one
[2:16:48] say brother Paul
[2:16:50] I make mistakes
[2:16:53] I don't feel like sex should take
[2:16:55] communion because I've made mistakes
[2:16:59] well let's just go back
[2:17:02] you know we declare this to be
[2:17:05] the guide
[2:17:07] to be ready for the Rapture
[2:17:10] go read the manual on repentance
[2:17:15] it's not a 30 day or a 90 day or a six
[2:17:18] month process
[2:17:22] I remember brother Chris
[2:17:25] it's anchored very much in my heart
[2:17:27] others it anchored
[2:17:30] you remember that brother Chris
[2:17:32] maybe maybe not doesn't know where I'm
[2:17:35] going
[2:17:36] another Chris Express what is it
[2:17:40] repentance you're going the wrong
[2:17:42] direction
[2:17:44] and you stop and say Lord forgive me
[2:17:49] you turn and you go back the other
[2:17:52] direction
[2:17:54] I want each one of you
[2:17:56] to consider that the prophet of God said
[2:18:00] communion was an expression of your
[2:18:03] relationship with Jesus Christ
[2:18:06] my wife and I's relationship isn't
[2:18:09] always good
[2:18:11] oh no don't misunderstand me I might be
[2:18:13] overstating it a little bit
