[23:17] live that story out and we're not just
[23:20] some little part you know you might see
[23:22] like an advertisement that says that

[23:27] movie well to be chosen just to be the
[23:30] back walking away down a
[23:33] sidewalk but God chose you and
[23:36] I to be the star of the
[23:40] show he's the real true star but he
[23:43] chose us to just be part of that that
[23:46] whole story is wrapped around you and

[23:54] us to be Is So Glorious can we just lift

[26:53] little
[26:55] um a little deal that had been sent to
[26:58] me here if I can find it
[27:03] um and while it would appear to be just
[27:07] sent as it would be to me this is
[27:10] actually sent to you and so it's in the
[27:13] wording that we need to make uh from
[27:17] Brother Barry
[27:18] coffee thank you for your support of
[27:20] vision books in
[27:22] 20124 your contributions Have Been
[27:25] instrumental instrumental in
[27:27] distributing B IES and message books to
[27:29] Believers across the globe this year
[27:32] bringing joy and encouragement to those
[27:34] seeking God's word your kindness is not
[27:37] only appreciated it is making an inter
[27:41] Eternal impact in the lives of many may
[27:45] God richly bless you for your
[27:46] faithfulness and your heart for his work
[27:50] amen and so I read that as not Paul
[27:54] Halen amen I read that as Grace
[27:56] Tabernacle each and every one of of you
[27:58] for your prayers and your offerings and
[28:02] gifts that have made a difference in the
[28:04] life of Believers I just want to just
[28:07] touch a little bit on this I really
[28:09] should ask brother Sergey to come do
[28:11] this but um we are I'm asking more
[28:15] almost like a prayer request at this
[28:17] point right now uh we are endeavoring or
[28:21] moving forward uh to support a
[28:24] translation work some of it is already
[28:27] there there's already uh um what would
[28:30] you say work
[28:32] completed um but uh as a church um we
[28:37] have endeavored to see the message
[28:40] there's many many uh um languages you
[28:43] know that still do not have the message
[28:46] in their language and or limited amounts
[28:49] or I don't say this negative but factual
[28:52] that some early translations of the
[28:55] message uh were not sufficient
[28:58] and uh no criticism to those that did it
[29:01] I'm sure they did it from their hearts
[29:03] but anyway um we've been working on this
[29:07] and uh uh not me so much but to give
[29:10] credit where it's due brother Sergey has
[29:13] um been working he's been our our front
[29:16] man on this and we won't go any deeper
[29:18] on the details right now but I just want
[29:21] you to pray uh that God would bless this
[29:25] work it truly is a necessary work and um
[29:30] uh we will kind of put together a a uh
[29:34] more complete deal but as we go into the
[29:37] new year uh I would just ask you to put
[29:39] that on your prayer list for this year
[29:42] uh that the word would be translated
[29:44] brother Barry is is uh working very much
[29:47] so to to have this printing done um they
[29:51] have at this point by God's grace found
[29:53] an Avenue uh to have the message printed
[29:57] and good quality uh not not some cheap
[30:01] deal good quality and it and it being
[30:04] shipped uh all around the world it's not
[30:06] just entirely to Africa but um there's
[30:10] been
[30:11] uh quite a quite a amount shipped to
[30:15] South America and Spanish uh and uh into
[30:18] Europe and uh you know I believe we're
[30:21] in the time the season uh that God is
[30:24] finishing up his work we're we're seeing
[30:27] all these things you can interpret
[30:29] quotes you know uh just looking at
[30:31] something a brother posted the other day
[30:33] about uh uh this is it Russia is going
[30:36] for the oil um well we know that's going
[30:39] to happens absolutely is it going to
[30:41] happen today or tomorrow or
[30:44] 2026 that's right we don't know but what
[30:47] we know is what God anointed a prophet
[30:51] to speak is coming to pass amen and I
[30:56] see it right here in Grace Tabernacle I
[30:58] see a faithful group of people we're not
[31:00] a huge Church we're not busting this
[31:02] building at this seams but I tell you
[31:04] what my brother and sister I believe
[31:07] that we have the word being manifested
[31:09] in our midst and so I thank God for that
[31:14] and just certainly encourage you to
[31:16] include these translation work uh in
[31:19] your prayers uh that that God could
[31:22] anoint the brothers uh that are involved
[31:24] each one to do his part and uh you know
[31:28] I just listened to a brother preached
[31:29] the other day I loved his sermon I'm not
[31:31] going to try and imitate his sermon but
[31:33] I loved his sermon he was talking about
[31:35] being on the clock and um he he
[31:38] basically was making the point that
[31:40] we're not our own we're on God's time
[31:43] and it's time for us to do our job and I
[31:46] thought that's the truth right there
[31:48] that we we are not on our own time but
[31:50] we are on God's time and and he's called
[31:53] us and Lord help us to do our job amen
[31:56] hallelujah so
[31:58] uh a thank you from Brother Barry uh I
[32:01] think we forgot to remember Sister April
[32:03] uh she's now I think paying the price
[32:06] for her time off and uh so God help our
[32:10] our sister uh I just want you to know
[32:13] this coming Wednesday if Lord willing
[32:15] this is all Lord willing this coming
[32:17] Wednesday our brother David Nash will be
[32:20] speaking for us and uh then the coming
[32:23] Sunday Brother David will be speaking
[32:26] and sister Jerry and I will be here on
[32:29] Wednesday uh but uh we're going for a
[32:32] quick weekend uh to see our son and uh
[32:36] family in Phoenix and uh so um just
[32:41] wanted you to know that amen let's turn
[32:44] our bibles if you would I want to speak
[32:46] to you this morning uh a title
[32:49] possessing the power to become and um my
[32:53] brother and sister when we look at this
[32:55] scripture if we are not careful we will
[32:58] put it as a past tense or a future tense
[33:01] but God wants you if you read the same
[33:03] scripture every single day he wants you
[33:06] to make it present tense amen so we
[33:09] don't look at God of history or God of
[33:11] the future but we look at it as God in
[33:14] his word today and so if we're still
[33:16] reading the same scripture tomorrow it
[33:19] will be God of his scripture today amen
[33:23] so we look at that and we thank the Lord
[33:25] for that amen and it's one thing to talk
[33:28] about a power it's talk about possessing
[33:32] it's quite another when we take that uh
[33:35] possession make it ours and take the
[33:38] power and manifest it or make it ours
[33:40] and so we certainly would ask uh that
[33:44] God would come and bless the service
[33:45] today let's turn to John 1
[33:49] 11-13 amen
[34:03] amen wonderful God is good to us the
[34:06] closing of the closing of uh
[34:10] 2024 uh you know we have to look back
[34:14] I'll tell you personally one of the most
[34:16] challenging years I've ever had in my
[34:19] life and you know it's
[34:23] interesting is the challenge
[34:28] was not
[34:32] you the challenge was not the politics
[34:35] of our
[34:39] government but the closer we get to the
[34:43] Rapture those little things that we
[34:45] never even give second thought to in the
[34:48] past are rising up in front of us and
[34:51] we're saying Lord is that really
[34:53] me we didn't even used to notice it
[34:58] but now we see it as I I guess I just
[35:02] speak straight we just see it as this
[35:04] giant flaw in our
[35:06] character isn't that amazing what's
[35:10] happened God's taking the magnifying
[35:13] glass of his word he's just slowly
[35:16] turning the
[35:17] magnification to what we saw as a grain
[35:20] of sand that meant
[35:22] nothing now puts us in desperation amen
[35:26] Lord I Need this out of my life you you
[35:30] understand what I'm saying 5 10 years
[35:33] ago we wouldn't have given a second
[35:35] thought but today it's like Lord I need
[35:38] this out of my
[35:40] life and so I tell you that 2024 being
[35:44] probably the greatest challenge of my
[35:49] life God's turning the magnifying glass
[35:52] that's right he's he's cranking that
[35:55] down and I realize the greatest enemy
[35:57] Paul's God's not even
[35:59] Satan it's
[36:01] Paul and I just Lord help me I want 2025
[36:05] to be a year that I would
[36:08] actually let go of some of those little
[36:11] things I didn't think
[36:15] mattered just give you a little example
[36:18] I just recently you know I I I love to
[36:21] read and um had books are not bad
[36:25] books um they're they're not a a
[36:27] horrible story or horrible things in the
[36:32] story and it just dawned on
[36:36] me when I've got so many things to
[36:41] read I gave them big pile of books just
[36:45] expensive
[36:49] books
[36:51] fiction one thing to have a history book
[36:54] on your shelf yeah another to be
[36:57] engrossing your time and thoughts and
[36:59] labors into something that's
[37:02] fantasy not even
[37:04] real and I realized Lord I I just don't
[37:08] need this I don't know why I placed such
[37:11] importance on it in the
[37:13] past and you know I just see these
[37:16] little things coming in her life amen
[37:19] sorry to keep you standing John 1
[37:23] 11-13 he came unto his own and his own
[37:28] received him
[37:29] not but as many as received him can
[37:32] someone raise a hand and say I'm one of
[37:34] the many amen but as many as received
[37:38] him to them gave he power to become the
[37:42] sons of God even to them that believe on
[37:46] his name which were born not of blood
[37:49] nor of the will of the flesh nor the
[37:51] will of man but of God Heavenly Father
[37:55] we ask to bless your word today bless
[37:57] this time together in the name of Jesus
[37:59] Christ amen you may be seated
[38:04] Saints now I want to just focus uh for
[38:08] just a moment there in that scripture if
[38:11] we could you see my brother and sister
[38:13] to them gave he power to become the sons
[38:16] of God now when you look at that we we
[38:19] have to have a good understanding or
[38:21] balance of
[38:23] predestination um I don't know brother
[38:25] Isaac we have some feedback I think it
[38:28] it seems like a little little echo or
[38:30] something up here um so we look at
[38:34] predestination isn't it wonderful about
[38:37] predestination amen Because unless that
[38:39] we just fully reject God Satan cannot
[38:43] take and pull you out of the Lamb's Book
[38:45] of Life that's it I mean he can do
[38:48] everything he wants to do but he can't
[38:50] pull you out of that book and we in our
[38:54] flesh cannot put ourself into that book
[38:57] book amen so when you look at this it
[39:00] says it gave them power to become the
[39:02] sons of God what the word is actually
[39:05] saying there it gave you an ability to
[39:08] accept who you are by
[39:12] Revelation and so when you have that
[39:14] ability to accept who you are you can
[39:17] then look in the word and say you know
[39:19] what I I failed yesterday imagine my
[39:22] brother and sister I'm sure glad we
[39:23] don't keep track imagine if we took all
[39:26] the little things of our life the little
[39:27] failures that were and we wrote them
[39:30] down in a book like a diary my we would
[39:33] be on about the
[39:34] 365th Edition this year so it's there
[39:39] that we look at that see but God gives
[39:41] you an ability to look Beyond those
[39:43] little failures and he let you look into
[39:46] the promise of the word in other words
[39:48] predestination is not a concept in
[39:52] Scripture it is a life being lived amen
[39:55] it is the very word com out that's what
[39:58] predestination is it's not something
[40:00] that we teach and and use it for an
[40:02] anchor to say well praise God I can't be
[40:05] lost but it is there something that is
[40:07] bubbling up inside of you and I that is
[40:10] showing us that's who I am right there
[40:14] an eternal thought of God Amen and God
[40:17] does not change his mind he doesn't come
[40:20] along and say you know what you know you
[40:22] kind of messed up and and you know you
[40:25] did and you did this or you didn't and
[40:27] I'm sorry you hit the limit but my
[40:29] brother and sister I still think of the
[40:31] word how many times must you as a body
[40:34] of Believers forgive me when my stumbles
[40:37] and bumbles as the pastor amen it's that
[40:40] me and it is reciprocal amen that each
[40:43] one of us looks at one another so we get
[40:46] all bent out of shape amen especially
[40:49] married people would would be able to do
[40:51] that we're still you can be married a
[40:54] long time and you're still being mared
[40:57] or molded together we are humans we have
[41:01] opinions and we have and things little
[41:03] things in our life that maybe have kind
[41:05] of been put in there uh and and we look
[41:08] at that and God is bringing this and
[41:10] working this all together and my brother
[41:12] and sister as we come as Sons and
[41:14] Daughters of God we have to do the same
[41:16] thing actually in the plan of God
[41:19] because God is bringing you and I not as
[41:22] a
[41:23] prefinished that's right you can go over
[41:26] here to Home Depot and you can buy a
[41:28] piece of wood and it's prefinished to
[41:31] look like Oak and take it home and put
[41:32] it next to the Oak and it looks
[41:36] false we are not
[41:38] pre-finished God is working on us but
[41:41] see he has a perfect plan that he is
[41:44] molding us together to to bring us to
[41:46] that place of perfection and it's a
[41:49] Perfection that is God's Perfection not
[41:51] Perfection that Humanity thinks it is
[41:54] it's not a Perfection that we can look
[41:56] in the mirror and say I've been a
[41:58] perfect teenager I've been a perfect
[42:00] brother a perfect this a perfect that no
[42:03] my brother and sister it's Perfection by
[42:04] the word and the word is bringing about
[42:06] and often times God's Perfection of his
[42:09] word is actually hidden in this vessel
[42:12] amen amen God working us to a place that
[42:15] you'll come my brother and sister and
[42:17] you know the Rapture already taking
[42:19] place right now we're we're not looking
[42:21] for Rapture to come but there's actually
[42:24] a body change taking place in the body
[42:26] of Christ right now and as it is but my
[42:30] I want to ask you do you feel this
[42:32] morning now now you got to understand
[42:34] this I'm not I don't like to go by
[42:36] feelings amen but do you feel like right
[42:40] now that that you're just Rapture
[42:44] Ready see that's a tricky statement
[42:47] right cuz in our flesh that's it we
[42:50] would look at that and say I am not
[42:52] Rapture Ready but you might be shocked
[42:56] that God has declared many of you
[42:58] Rapture Ready right now but he's waiting
[43:01] till the whole body that's right he's
[43:03] bringing the body together in this great
[43:05] body change and so as the bride of
[43:08] Christ is being prepared by the word
[43:10] she's being uh uh fed she's being built
[43:13] amen structured by the word and the
[43:16] revelation of the word will be different
[43:18] to you as it would be to someone sitting
[43:21] next to you or across the building from
[43:23] you because we have different needs amen
[43:27] we are human and we have all the same
[43:29] needs as the bride of Christ but what
[43:31] position we're actually in is different
[43:33] for each one and that's why sometimes we
[43:36] have to just sit back let God preach the
[43:39] word to us because we say I've got that
[43:42] one heard that one before that's good I
[43:45] got a revelation of that but maybe the
[43:47] one beside you doesn't that's right so
[43:50] do you want to just hear what's good for
[43:52] you or do you want to hear what's good
[43:54] for the body that's right amen we want
[43:57] what the body needs right that's a real
[43:59] believer wants what the body needs
[44:02] because then there'll come the day that
[44:05] the preaching of the word comes to you
[44:07] and they've heard it and they believe it
[44:11] that's why the church has always got to
[44:13] stay in Balance we can't come to a place
[44:16] that we are more spiritual than those
[44:18] around us because there will be a place
[44:20] in our own life that is not mature and
[44:23] we need to be able to receive the
[44:25] preaching of the word to touch on that
[44:28] portion of our body and so God by his
[44:31] grace and mercy has come so he's gave us
[44:34] a power or a
[44:36] revelation to become the sons of God
[44:39] Amen as we stand there in that place the
[44:42] power my brother and sister is in Christ
[44:44] right amen amen so what we're doing is
[44:48] actually surrendering that power that we
[44:51] need we surrender the need to Christ
[44:54] he's the power that comes to fill the
[44:56] need
[44:58] amen so I think that to them he gave
[45:00] power in other words he gave them an
[45:02] acceptance or an amen to the preaching
[45:05] of the word to become Sons and Daughters
[45:08] of God now as Paul is speaking to the
[45:10] Romans in Romans 1:1 for I long to see
[45:14] you that I may impart unto you some
[45:18] spiritual gift to the end you may be
[45:22] established so now my brother and sister
[45:25] the the definition of part by Webster is
[45:28] to give something of quality a thing to
[45:31] make something known to someone so the
[45:35] Apostle Paul's speaking to the Romans
[45:37] and he's telling them you know what I
[45:39] want to make known unto you something
[45:42] that is a spiritual gift that that will
[45:45] change your life it will Build You Up
[45:47] strength in you it's Revelation to you
[45:50] and I want to come now Paul we know if
[45:53] he was speaking as a man uh this would
[45:56] be totally in effective for you and I
[45:59] but he was not speaking as a man so
[46:01] therefore his words were God's words
[46:03] which are Eternal Words which are here
[46:06] today that God would actually be
[46:07] speaking to you and I today wanting to
[46:10] give to you and I a
[46:12] gift amen we just come through the
[46:15] holiday season amen now some of us are a
[46:18] little bit Scrooge kind of you know
[46:20] makes me happy to see my grandchildren
[46:22] happy it makes me happy to see those
[46:24] around me happy but don't waste your
[46:26] money on me me and you know nobody
[46:30] listens you know I mean how many shoes
[46:33] do you need how many socks do you need
[46:35] How many pairs of pants and shirts and
[46:37] stuff and the things that I actually
[46:40] would want in this flesh we're talking
[46:42] in the flesh right now you're not going
[46:44] to buy for
[46:46] me so we love our pastor so much we took
[46:49] on a 7-year payment of about 800 a month
[46:53] no we don't do that right so we stay
[46:57] away from the flesh this the things that
[46:59] this gift was some kind of carnal kind
[47:02] of tangible I can lay my hands on this
[47:06] gift the Apostle Paul wants to give to
[47:07] me and realize the Apostle Paul speaking
[47:10] in these words that he wants to impart a
[47:13] spiritual gift in other words he wants
[47:15] the word to be broken as bread and given
[47:18] to you and I that we would be
[47:21] spiritually built up spiritually blessed
[47:25] by this gift and and it's there that he
[47:28] is not only saying I I want to impart to
[47:30] you this gift but he said in the end
[47:33] you'll be established in other words
[47:35] this gift has a a a a a
[47:39] tangible uh uh oh I lost the word there
[47:43] sorry uh but it'll be a tangible thing
[47:45] to you and I that that what we hear by
[47:47] the word today will affect our life not
[47:51] just for one day I always liked uh you
[47:54] know the little story about the dad who
[47:56] said said why I come to dislike
[47:59] Christmas and it's it's a cute little
[48:02] story he says I I went to the store and
[48:05] I I bought him a dump truck and a loader
[48:08] and a back hole and I I got all of this
[48:12] little conveyers and all this little
[48:14] stuff and and before Christmas was over
[48:16] they must have been in a warm area he
[48:18] said I look out in the backyard and my
[48:20] son is digging a hole in the sandbox
[48:22] with a
[48:24] stick and realized this dump truck this
[48:27] stuff didn't mean anything more to his
[48:30] son than a
[48:33] stick so we got to be careful that by I
[48:37] I believe in deep teaching don't
[48:39] understand I believe in deep things but
[48:41] by Deep teaching my brother and sister
[48:43] if it's not usable that's right we will
[48:46] revert to back to what we had before so
[48:50] just because it's deep and it has a
[48:52] certain a factor it doesn't mean that
[48:56] you'll actually Tak it into your
[48:58] everyday life God wants you to have a
[49:00] gift that will establish you he wants
[49:03] you to have the word that when you are
[49:06] in a time of crisis when you are in
[49:09] times of stress when you're times of
[49:11] sickness whatever that might be that you
[49:14] have something that you will take a hold
[49:16] of hold on and be able to use that that
[49:20] establish also means to Anchor so he
[49:23] wants you to be anchored by the word
[49:26] amen and so as we look at this we we
[49:29] realize my brother and
[49:30] sister uh that God is so good to us
[49:33] because he has come amen has brought a
[49:37] gift to us he's given it to us it's a
[49:39] gift can anyone say I'm more anchored
[49:43] today than I was a year
[49:45] ago 5 10 years whatever it be to be more
[49:48] anchored today than we was you see God
[49:51] doesn't blow a horn every time he does
[49:55] something for you
[49:57] sometimes God just changes the
[50:00] circumstance and allows you to live
[50:04] under that blessing without even touting
[50:07] or or making it known that he did that
[50:09] but yet when we stop in retrospect we
[50:11] can look back and say you know what I
[50:14] I'm not who I was a year ago I I'm not
[50:17] I'm not in the same circumstance I was a
[50:20] year ago and I'm looking for 2025 myself
[50:24] to be another gift coming into the
[50:25] assembly GI coming into our lives that
[50:29] we could finish if God so chooses the
[50:31] end of 2025 we'd be able to say I'm not
[50:34] the same person I was at the end of 2024
[50:38] because God's imparting more and more
[50:40] and more into my life that's changing me
[50:43] bringing me into a different
[50:45] relationship than I ever had before and
[50:48] God is not into the superficial God is
[50:50] into the deep relationship not deep
[50:53] preaching don't misunderstand me deep
[50:55] preaching does doesn't make deep
[50:59] relationships I know many of people that
[51:01] can quote all kinds of things and still
[51:05] are so superficial in their life that
[51:08] you're stunned amen people that would
[51:11] rather tell you about their Millions
[51:13] than talk to you about the Lord amen God
[51:16] help us my brother and sister deep yes
[51:19] they're very deep very intelligent make
[51:21] people like me feel so inadequate but
[51:24] you know what I'd rather be the simp
[51:27] that knew Christ than to be the Rich
[51:29] Young Ruler
[51:36] amen but you see God is doing this he's
[51:40] given his
[51:42] word you might say we're looking a
[51:44] little bit in retrospect today but he's
[51:47] given you the word do you have the same
[51:49] understanding of the word today as you
[51:51] did when he gave it to
[51:52] you I would hope not that's right I
[51:55] would hope hope
[51:57] not cuz if there's no growth my brother
[52:00] and sister we have a problem that's
[52:02] right amen so God's given his word and
[52:05] we love his word and his word is opening
[52:07] to us every day can we say amen amen he
[52:10] didn't just give it to us in a print
[52:12] form he didn't just give it to us in the
[52:15] voice but he gave it to us also in the
[52:18] spirit amen and that is where he comes
[52:20] down and talks to you and I he talks to
[52:22] us in the Midnight Hour he talks to us
[52:25] in our time of need often times we'll
[52:27] have an answer out of the word if we'll
[52:29] just open the word people are like
[52:32] Pastor I need an answer I need an answer
[52:35] I need an answer amen have you opened
[52:38] the
[52:39] word just just go to the word and and
[52:43] God I believe will speak to you from the
[52:45] word and and I I'm a curious guy when
[52:48] you hear nothing more back from this you
[52:50] often think well do I dare ask them do I
[52:53] dare go into this equation because maybe
[52:57] they felt like I didn't do enough for
[53:00] them please don't lift your hands but
[53:02] probably some at some time have felt
[53:04] like I didn't do enough for you but let
[53:06] me tell you what I did do for
[53:08] you I prayed that's
[53:11] it that's it and if we long to get the
[53:14] answer the pastor doesn't have the
[53:17] answer for you it's Jesus Christ who has
[53:21] the answer and so when you go and you
[53:24] start looking in the word and you've got
[53:26] a body of Believers that love you
[53:29] appreciate you pray for you I can
[53:31] guarantee you I can tell you as a matter
[53:34] of fact you will find the answer cuz God
[53:37] wants you to find the answer my brother
[53:39] and sister you don't you know some
[53:41] people that they they they they want an
[53:44] answer they truly want an answer but
[53:45] they go the wrong place that's it to get
[53:48] the answer
[53:50] amen true
[53:52] story a man I knew years ago got in a
[53:56] financial
[53:58] bind had good
[54:00] credit could have walked into a bank and
[54:03] borrowed money under a structured
[54:06] loan every loan typically is considered
[54:09] structured we give you this you pay us
[54:12] this much over this period of time
[54:15] structure instead he started hauling
[54:18] things to the pawn shop and selling it
[54:20] for a quarter of its
[54:23] value and in the end it didn't work he
[54:26] no longer had anything to his name and
[54:29] still didn't get himself out of his
[54:30] financial
[54:32] situation now you say why are you
[54:34] mentioned that brother Paul I'm telling
[54:36] you it's because he found he was
[54:37] searching for his solution in the wrong
[54:40] place and we often times search for
[54:43] Solutions in this world we search for
[54:47] Solutions in ourself when we should be
[54:50] searching for the solution in Christ
[54:52] that's right in the word is where we
[54:54] should be seeking the solution
[54:57] and so it's there my brother and sister
[55:00] God has come and and he's given us these
[55:03] answers he's placed it there and uh so
[55:06] as we'll look at that we see that God
[55:08] sends men but people don't always listen
[55:10] to men I can I I feel free to preach
[55:13] that way not as a pastor or preacher but
[55:16] because I've been in that stage of my
[55:17] life that I I I just simply refus to
[55:21] listen Ministers of this gospel tried to
[55:24] to help me and I didn't want their help
[55:27] my dear wife could give you a whole list
[55:29] of of those times and seasons and did it
[55:31] bless my family that I behave that way
[55:34] no it did not bless my family that I was
[55:36] going to solve this problem that I had
[55:38] on my own I wasn't going to lower myself
[55:42] to ask a preacher to help
[55:44] me maybe it sounds
[55:47] familiar if it does maybe this sermon is
[55:51] for you God sent his men amen why
[55:55] because it wasn't the man who had
[55:57] something he wanted to impart to you
[55:59] just like it wasn't the Apostle Paul
[56:00] that was going to be doing the imparting
[56:03] it was God coming wanting to impart to
[56:05] you and he used a man amen to do that
[56:08] aren't you glad that today each and
[56:10] every one of us is used of God Amen we
[56:14] are God's hands we are his voice amen we
[56:17] are his heart amen and he wants to use
[56:20] us amen we're on the clock maybe we
[56:23] should do our job amen but you look at
[56:25] this realize that God wanted to impart
[56:29] something to you and I and he said I'm
[56:31] going to use these men to do this
[56:35] and
[56:36] why so we could stay the
[56:40] same that we could just go on status
[56:45] quo no God wants you to step up higher
[56:48] amen he's got a higher calling for us
[56:51] Saints don't look at it like God's
[56:52] trying to punish you don't look at it
[56:54] like something is missing at as it were
[56:56] on God's part but God wants to lift you
[56:59] and I up to a higher calling amen and
[57:02] you know sometimes God has to use
[57:04] correction to do that sir right
[57:06] sometimes you know God is God is uh
[57:08] dealing with us uh uh whatever it takes
[57:12] to tap into a higher life tap into the
[57:15] supernatural uh you know 2 Peter 1:11
[57:18] said for so an entrance shall be
[57:21] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[57:23] Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[57:25] savior Jesus Christ now this is what God
[57:28] is trying to do my brother and sister he
[57:30] is coming bringing the word and
[57:33] sometimes we feel like it's a little too
[57:34] blunt but the truth of it is if you went
[57:37] to the end of your life and that was
[57:39] never dealt with you would look back and
[57:41] say Lord why didn't you deal with
[57:44] me and God's trying to deal with us and
[57:47] we're like saying why are you so
[57:49] harsh my brother and sister it's not
[57:51] harsh if God's bringing you into a
[57:53] higher calling it's not harsh if God is
[57:56] purging these things out of our life
[57:58] that are negative holding us back it's
[58:01] not harsh if God is doing everything it
[58:04] takes for us to step up into an eternal
[58:07] position amen so as we tap into the
[58:10] supernatural so this entrance that is
[58:13] opened my brother and sister in our mind
[58:16] we would picture that as like a doorway
[58:18] that that we have an entrance now to do
[58:20] that but we're dealing with the soul and
[58:23] so if you can look then at the doorway
[58:26] of your soul and you look at that and
[58:28] realize that there are a few
[58:31] things that are in the
[58:34] doorway now naturally at home imagine
[58:37] you go home today each one of you to
[58:39] your house and you have to climb over
[58:42] several boxes of tools and pipes and
[58:45] wrenches and whatever to get into your
[58:49] house wouldn't we stop and move those
[58:54] things out of the doorway
[58:56] yes sir especially if the nice dress
[58:59] that you young ladies and Sisters Wives
[59:02] are wearing if you climbed over that big
[59:05] pile and realized that you just tore
[59:07] your dress You' say this stuff has to be
[59:11] moved now I want you to look at this I
[59:13] hope you can follow me you see we're
[59:16] dressed by the
[59:17] word God's not wanting us to crawl over
[59:20] all kinds of self all kinds of
[59:23] shortcomings and complex and what not
[59:26] you know that that smears uh uh as it
[59:29] would be the grease or tears the the
[59:32] dress the word in our life God wants you
[59:35] to get that stuff out of the doorway and
[59:38] let him come and let you come freely
[59:41] amen come to the Water of Life freely
[59:45] and so as God is dealing with us he's
[59:47] bringing us to a place that he's
[59:49] imparting to you and I to give this so
[59:52] we can tap into a higher life and as it
[59:54] is in second Peter uh an entrance shall
[59:57] be ministered unto you abundantly amen
[1:00:00] this is not just enough message to get
[1:00:03] you to church on Sunday my brother and
[1:00:06] sister this is enough of Christ himself
[1:00:09] to get you and I into a position that we
[1:00:12] can be effectively used of God to
[1:00:14] witness to the cashier witness to those
[1:00:17] around you witness to the grumpy
[1:00:19] neighbor witness to whoever it might be
[1:00:22] that this is God putting us in a
[1:00:24] position that we're no longer walking
[1:00:27] imagine to tell and represent ourselves
[1:00:30] as royalty are we royalty today amen we
[1:00:33] should view ourselves as royalty in
[1:00:35] Jesus Christ and if we're in a torn
[1:00:38] smudged tattered dress trying to tell
[1:00:41] the neighbor how we have something so
[1:00:44] much more valuable than they have my
[1:00:47] brother and sister we're not here to
[1:00:48] boast of what we have but we're here by
[1:00:51] the grace of God this is why a message
[1:00:53] came to you and I to open a door Amen to
[1:00:57] open an entrance that would be opened
[1:01:00] and administered
[1:01:02] abundantly not the defeated Christian
[1:01:05] not the one that's walking along saying
[1:01:07] I don't know if I am I I it doesn't seem
[1:01:10] like I am I'm not sure God is listening
[1:01:13] I tell you if you have struggle in your
[1:01:15] life this morning please hear me you
[1:01:17] have struggle in your life this morning
[1:01:19] you need to say Thank You Lord because
[1:01:23] God saw you fit and able to handle
[1:01:25] handle the
[1:01:27] trial God's not going to give you a
[1:01:29] trial to watch you fall on your face and
[1:01:33] have mud on your face so to speak but
[1:01:35] God saw that you would have enough
[1:01:38] character to continue to press to the
[1:01:40] mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus
[1:01:43] that you would be able to look at the
[1:01:45] word and say Lord is this the path you
[1:01:47] have for me then Lord you must have made
[1:01:50] me able to walk this path but we get a
[1:01:55] mentality that I'm going through trial
[1:01:57] after trial struggle after struggle and
[1:02:00] God must not love me God must not be
[1:02:02] hearing my prayer I want you to think
[1:02:04] about job my brother and sister God did
[1:02:07] not say watch me Crush job he was there
[1:02:10] letting the devil see that what was in
[1:02:14] job no matter what happened what was in
[1:02:16] job would come out Victorious did it
[1:02:19] changed job yes it changed job but job
[1:02:23] needed changed a man that was considered
[1:02:25] righteous he still needed more of Christ
[1:02:29] in his life and God is here today you
[1:02:32] are not of less value than job you are
[1:02:35] of Greater uh just as great I mean uh a
[1:02:38] value and in fact the Revelation that
[1:02:41] God give to you to bring you into this
[1:02:44] generation the seventh age moving into
[1:02:47] the bride age my brother and sister God
[1:02:50] placed that value on you to put you here
[1:02:53] that's right don't sit here and say oh
[1:02:55] woe is me you ought to lift a hand and
[1:02:58] say Lord thank you that you would see of
[1:03:01] all the saints of the ages that I would
[1:03:04] be qualified and capable to live in this
[1:03:08] day and manifest Jesus
[1:03:11] Christ right oh my my brother and sister
[1:03:14] the devil sometimes just tricks us into
[1:03:16] thinking why doesn't God care I'll tell
[1:03:19] you he cares more than you can even
[1:03:22] fathom that he cares because he has put
[1:03:25] you here and you might not feel
[1:03:27] Victorious but you're still standing
[1:03:29] today praise the Lord amen the devil
[1:03:31] would love to crush you grind you to
[1:03:33] ashes but you're standing today you're
[1:03:36] not sitting here feeling oh I'm so
[1:03:38] spiritually Victorious but you're still
[1:03:41] standing
[1:03:42] today Hallelujah all these things that
[1:03:45] are going on in life you're still
[1:03:47] standing
[1:03:48] today someone ought to lift a hand and
[1:03:51] say thank you
[1:03:52] Lord amen because this is how God works
[1:03:55] my brother and sister he's not uh he
[1:03:57] doesn't run a nursery with a hot house
[1:04:00] amen God will put you right out and we
[1:04:04] think we got a lot of woes it's a lot of
[1:04:06] Mind woes right that's what the prophet
[1:04:08] showed us it' be a mind battle in this
[1:04:10] day but you wouldn't have felt any more
[1:04:13] encouraged to be there and see your
[1:04:15] children fed to the
[1:04:18] Lions you would have said Lord what are
[1:04:21] you
[1:04:24] doing and and then God would deal with
[1:04:26] them and they would
[1:04:32] say I heard this
[1:04:35] preached and if this is the price I have
[1:04:37] to
[1:04:39] pay feed me with my children to the
[1:04:43] Lions 21st century a little hard to
[1:04:45] comprehend
[1:04:48] that but do you realize that they had
[1:04:50] been drawn out of the Coliseum and
[1:04:52] placed here today in the mind battle
[1:04:56] they would
[1:04:57] sayl why are you letting my children be
[1:05:00] so beaten and battered by the spirits of
[1:05:04] leoda why is music and clothes and all
[1:05:07] of these things having such an impact on
[1:05:10] my
[1:05:11] children my brother and sister the truth
[1:05:13] of it is if you have an open mind and
[1:05:15] can
[1:05:17] understand the devil would like to feed
[1:05:19] your children to the lion of
[1:05:24] leoda but when they turned and gave
[1:05:26] their life for
[1:05:29] Christ but you see it's a little bit
[1:05:31] different we don't have a
[1:05:34] Coliseum and giving our life for Christ
[1:05:36] is submitting to the word that's it
[1:05:39] that's it we don't have to go out here
[1:05:42] and be slaughtered on the street no
[1:05:43] that's right it takes a personal death
[1:05:46] amen a personal commitment and yes
[1:05:50] parents you're going to
[1:05:52] struggle yes young people you're going
[1:05:54] to struggle
[1:05:57] but in every age you can follow a theme
[1:05:59] if you just trust the Lord trust the
[1:06:02] Lord trust the Lord trust the Lord trust
[1:06:04] the Lord through every age my brother
[1:06:07] and sister it wasn't about the Doctrine
[1:06:09] doctrine's important but it wasn't about
[1:06:11] the doctrine that made them decide to
[1:06:13] give their life for Christ it wasn't
[1:06:15] about I understand this or that or the
[1:06:17] preaching of the word it was something
[1:06:19] down inside a seed that had been
[1:06:22] activated by that word that said you
[1:06:24] know what God's real
[1:06:26] God's real I might not be able to
[1:06:28] explain all of this the seals and and
[1:06:30] and you know bring the Hebrews in and
[1:06:32] tie this here and tie that there but I'm
[1:06:34] going to trust the Lord anyhow and he's
[1:06:37] not going to come and ask you did you
[1:06:39] explain it he's going to ask you did you
[1:06:41] believe it amen hallelujah aren't you
[1:06:45] glad we got an entrance that's been
[1:06:46] ministered to us amen and it's not just
[1:06:49] a just a a drought it it's an abundance
[1:06:53] my brother and sister that has given to
[1:06:55] us to Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord
[1:06:57] and Savior Jesus Christ and I just I
[1:06:59] mentioned this but I want to hit it just
[1:07:01] a little bit more my brother and sister
[1:07:03] we Liv in a day and I I hope this
[1:07:05] doesn't offend anybody that I pin at
[1:07:07] this but it doesn't matter how many
[1:07:09] naysayers do their little thing about
[1:07:11] whether or not the seals are open God's
[1:07:14] proving that he has opened the seals you
[1:07:17] can go over here and say but on this
[1:07:18] page it's not open yet and and that's
[1:07:21] after the page where he says it's open
[1:07:23] my brother and sister do you realize
[1:07:25] that God God leaves a certain element in
[1:07:27] every one of us that's called Revelation
[1:07:29] that's right amen and without Revelation
[1:07:31] it don't matter on what page that it's
[1:07:34] on or whether it can be misconstrued or
[1:07:37] construed none of that matters this is a
[1:07:39] personal message amen and it doesn't
[1:07:42] matter what page it's on it's a personal
[1:07:45] message it just needs to be on your page
[1:07:48] because if it's not on your page no one
[1:07:50] will ever make it real to you that's
[1:07:52] right people would say well explain it
[1:07:55] to me I tell you my brother and sister I
[1:07:57] I told a certain brother one time you
[1:07:59] know he said explain it to me and I said
[1:08:01] I can't explain it he come back down the
[1:08:03] road ways and said well why would I
[1:08:05] listen to you you said you can't explain
[1:08:08] it well I'll tell you what my brother
[1:08:09] and sister he's absolutely right I don't
[1:08:12] know why God chose me I don't know how
[1:08:15] God come at the time that he met me was
[1:08:18] seemingly uh uh totally out of place
[1:08:21] order of time I can't explain to you how
[1:08:24] certain words that were spoken would not
[1:08:27] leave me alone I cannot explain to you
[1:08:30] how that I sat and thought I am so low
[1:08:33] and So Unworthy God wouldn't waste his
[1:08:36] time on me and God come along and says
[1:08:38] but I am that's right I can't explain
[1:08:43] that but if you want a theological
[1:08:46] explanation you might have to find a
[1:08:48] theological person to break the
[1:08:52] Revelation to you
[1:08:56] and then all you'll have is theological
[1:09:00] reasoning and a theological life that's
[1:09:03] exactly right and then you'll live life
[1:09:05] and have theological victory yeah that's
[1:09:09] it and sorry to be harsh but then you're
[1:09:12] going to hear the theological answer
[1:09:14] from our lord
[1:09:15] Jesus do you know what the theological
[1:09:18] answer
[1:09:19] is depart from me that's
[1:09:22] right he's not looking for theology no
[1:09:26] he's looking for those that will give
[1:09:29] themselves open the door Amen to receive
[1:09:33] a greater
[1:09:34] blessing there's what he's looking for
[1:09:37] amen theology that's fine you can take
[1:09:40] almost any word in the Bible no doubt
[1:09:42] any word in the Bible and you can find
[1:09:44] the definition in Hebrew or whatever for
[1:09:47] those words and sometimes it's
[1:09:49] enlightening but the minute you have
[1:09:51] that word in the
[1:09:53] Hebrew doesn't do a single thing that's
[1:09:57] right for your soul that's right and the
[1:10:00] man who's in complete ignorance of the
[1:10:02] Hebrew but has Revelation yeah will have
[1:10:05] more that's
[1:10:07] right but it's that it's that element
[1:10:11] that comes in that's trying to replace
[1:10:14] the things of God with knowledge yeah
[1:10:18] that's
[1:10:19] right exactly
[1:10:21] right the tree of knowledge
[1:10:26] is't it amazing how God just allowed
[1:10:28] that to come now the tree of knowledge
[1:10:31] is good I I'm I'm excited that that
[1:10:35] we're here today and we can read and
[1:10:39] write I'm excited that that you know we
[1:10:42] can comprehend the difference between up
[1:10:44] and down especially when you're on an
[1:10:48] airliner and they tell you you know go
[1:10:50] to 32,000
[1:10:53] ft what are you doing
[1:10:55] going to
[1:10:57] 32,000 where on the other side of the
[1:11:01] earth no you we need to have
[1:11:05] that but when it comes to the word the
[1:11:07] prophet of God told us you need to read
[1:11:11] and you need to pray and you need to
[1:11:13] trust
[1:11:14] God cuz I tell you right now there's so
[1:11:17] many things in scripture we can't
[1:11:19] explain if we fight our battle on that
[1:11:22] Hill you'll never finish the race that's
[1:11:25] right
[1:11:29] now second
[1:11:31] Timothy are we
[1:11:33] clear I maybe you disagree I don't know
[1:11:36] but I I do believe that this that we've
[1:11:39] just been speaking ties directly to the
[1:11:41] seven seal that whole thing coming right
[1:11:43] down it's God speaking to you personally
[1:11:46] in other words we could sum it up to say
[1:11:48] you can't make it on Daddy's uh
[1:11:50] Revelation you can't make it on Mama's
[1:11:52] Revelation you can't make it on brother
[1:11:53] or sister's Revelation you can't make it
[1:11:55] on the pastor's Revelation you got to
[1:11:57] have your own personal relationship and
[1:12:00] Revelation with Jesus
[1:12:02] Christ amen amen second Timothy
[1:12:07] 2:20 but in great house there are not
[1:12:09] only vessels of gold and of silver but
[1:12:11] also of wood and of Earth and some to
[1:12:14] honor and some to
[1:12:16] dishonor so in the world we live in
[1:12:18] today you'll find that the denominations
[1:12:20] are pushing away they say that
[1:12:22] predestination is kind of a
[1:12:24] misunderstood thing that you know you
[1:12:26] have this uh ability yes God is doing
[1:12:30] some choosing but not choosing that much
[1:12:32] but my brother and sister I'll tell you
[1:12:34] what God does God can allow things to be
[1:12:37] so
[1:12:39] painful that you'll change
[1:12:42] direction sounds cruel they say a loving
[1:12:45] God wouldn't do that they don't know
[1:12:48] what the love of God is cuz the love of
[1:12:51] God will bring you to a place that you
[1:12:53] will say Lord not not my will but thy
[1:12:57] will be done and we change direction and
[1:13:00] you look at that and some would say that
[1:13:02] that's not a loving God that's a cruel
[1:13:04] God my brother and sister I'll tell you
[1:13:05] how loving our God is he loves us so
[1:13:08] much he knows that we don't comprehend
[1:13:10] what hell is we don't comprehend what
[1:13:13] these things out of judgment are but he
[1:13:16] knows that we are inadequate to
[1:13:18] understand that and he says but I'm
[1:13:20] going to lead you and guide you is this
[1:13:22] not scriptural amen I'm going to lead
[1:13:24] you and guide guide you into all truth
[1:13:26] what is truth eternal life is truth amen
[1:13:30] living in the presence of God is truth
[1:13:32] and he said he's going to lead you there
[1:13:34] amen so it doesn't matter how we feel
[1:13:37] about this in this little touchy feely
[1:13:39] world we live in where everything oh
[1:13:41] don't don't offend don't offend we're
[1:13:43] not going to preach an offensive gospel
[1:13:45] we're just going to all go to hell did I
[1:13:48] say that out loud I'm
[1:13:51] sorry no my brother and sister God cares
[1:13:54] that's it
[1:13:55] right if God didn't care he would say go
[1:13:57] ahead and compromise a little bit and
[1:14:00] I'll Overlook it but he said you add one
[1:14:04] thing to this amen that's what
[1:14:06] compromise would be adding one thing to
[1:14:10] this amen God loves us enough he'd
[1:14:12] rather you be pained right now and
[1:14:15] rejoicing over there amen but the world
[1:14:18] wants to Rejoice now and they don't even
[1:14:20] think that hell is real anymore that's
[1:14:23] right they believe it's a figurative
[1:14:26] writing in the
[1:14:29] Bible could we take a poll is hell
[1:14:32] real I believe it's real cuz the Bible
[1:14:35] said it's real amen heaven
[1:14:39] real yeah amen some theologians today
[1:14:43] are like well heaven and hell it's just
[1:14:46] like you know whether some get caviar
[1:14:49] and some eat prime
[1:14:52] rib well what if you don't like caviar
[1:14:57] no you know they've watered it down so
[1:15:00] far there's no consequence for the life
[1:15:03] and God's saying there is consequence
[1:15:06] and I want you to see it and in fact if
[1:15:08] it's necessary I want you to feel it
[1:15:11] amen
[1:15:13] amen if we would be honest with
[1:15:15] ourselves we would actually admit
[1:15:17] there's been times we thought God was
[1:15:18] punishing us amen right because God was
[1:15:22] changing the course of our life and we
[1:15:24] thought why is he punishing me he wasn't
[1:15:28] punishing you
[1:15:29] no hard to comprehend for some people he
[1:15:33] was actually leading you that's exactly
[1:15:37] right sometimes it takes pain my brother
[1:15:39] and sister to cause us to react in the
[1:15:42] right sense
[1:15:45] amen CU if it was words were good enough
[1:15:48] we would read the Bible once and do
[1:15:50] exactly what it
[1:15:51] said but we read the Bible over and over
[1:15:54] and over again and go do the opposite
[1:15:56] that's it
[1:15:58] h are we doing
[1:16:03] okay see Timothy 2:20 you know says that
[1:16:07] some are to honor and some are
[1:16:11] dishonor you know what an opportunity
[1:16:13] God's given us to step into our role as
[1:16:15] a supernatural
[1:16:17] being when you got up this morning did
[1:16:20] you feel like you were Supernatural
[1:16:26] H I didn't feel too Supernatural this
[1:16:30] morning I I I won't go into it it's
[1:16:33] actually humorous but I don't think it's
[1:16:35] necessary for me to go into what the
[1:16:37] morning went
[1:16:38] like but I can just tell you if you're
[1:16:41] sleeping soundly and you have a runny
[1:16:42] nose you have a
[1:16:46] problem didn't feel too
[1:16:49] Supernatural didn't change who I am in
[1:16:52] Jesus
[1:16:53] Christ amen
[1:16:55] a leg cramp at midnight doesn't change
[1:16:58] who you are in Jesus Christ and we would
[1:17:01] say oh Lord but my brother and sister
[1:17:03] don't say oh Lord but just say Lord keep
[1:17:06] leading me keep leading me Lord you
[1:17:10] wouldn't even care about me Lord if you
[1:17:12] didn't care about me you would just let
[1:17:14] me go but you're not letting me go
[1:17:16] you're pulling me back again and again
[1:17:19] and again and if I have to face the
[1:17:21] fiery trials I'll face them amen who
[1:17:26] would we say Amen to that amen
[1:17:29] hallelujah you see the word said
[1:17:31] somebody's going to be hungry in this
[1:17:34] generation you think God missed the Mark
[1:17:37] when he chose you serve and put a desire
[1:17:41] in you to live this
[1:17:44] word you've seen the jokes through the
[1:17:47] years of of uh uh what's the Archer with
[1:17:51] the you know shoots the arrow and Cupid
[1:17:54] yeah
[1:17:55] yes yeah you know you guys have all seen
[1:17:58] the you've seen the cartoon things they
[1:18:01] do of that Cupid man and woman in the
[1:18:03] park sitting on the bench looking at
[1:18:05] each
[1:18:06] other and there's a really really ugly
[1:18:09] guy just beyond them and Cupid's like an
[1:18:13] arrow
[1:18:15] goes misses the guy goes
[1:18:19] over and the guy runs over and sweeps
[1:18:21] the girl off her
[1:18:23] feet yeah no
[1:18:25] it's not how it
[1:18:28] works Cupid might Cupid might
[1:18:31] miss God didn't that's right God
[1:18:35] knows so he's made no mistake Can
[1:18:38] someone say he made no
[1:18:40] mistake amen so if he made no mistake my
[1:18:43] brother and sister somebody's going to
[1:18:45] be hungry to desire a supernatural
[1:18:49] position in the Kingdom of almighty God
[1:18:52] they're going to be hungry for that and
[1:18:54] when you're hungry you'll find food the
[1:18:56] prophet of God said now just
[1:18:57] paraphrasing this that people that want
[1:18:59] ate from A Fine table amen when they're
[1:19:02] hungry enough we'll eat out of a
[1:19:04] dumpster and I'll tell you what it is
[1:19:06] when the word of God struck your heart
[1:19:08] my brother and sister there's no
[1:19:10] dumpster going to satisfy that amen
[1:19:12] there's no thing of this world going to
[1:19:14] satisfy that there's no such thing as
[1:19:17] denomination satisfying that it'll only
[1:19:20] be the pure word of God that can satisfy
[1:19:22] the hunger that the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:25] placed into you and so when we recognize
[1:19:28] that we got to recognize that God has
[1:19:30] given us a power to become Sons and
[1:19:34] Daughters of
[1:19:36] god let's not let's not just Waltz
[1:19:39] around this thing well I was
[1:19:40] predestinated I this I that no my
[1:19:43] brother and sister there's a hunger in
[1:19:45] you and if the hunger is not in you then
[1:19:47] you're going to starve and when you go
[1:19:49] into starvation mode you'll get real
[1:19:51] hungry then and it'll cause you to do
[1:19:53] something some people hunger for the
[1:19:56] world some people hunger for what
[1:19:58] denomination has to
[1:20:01] offer amen I got a lot of good
[1:20:03] friends I'll tell you how it is I got a
[1:20:06] lot of good friends I got a friend that
[1:20:08] him and his dad gave hundreds of
[1:20:11] thousands of dollars to their church
[1:20:13] when they built a new church and he
[1:20:15] basically made a statement like that's
[1:20:17] my
[1:20:20] insurance for what
[1:20:25] that money is insurance for
[1:20:28] nothing a hunger for the word of
[1:20:31] God satisfying the soul changing our
[1:20:34] position that's it there's where you
[1:20:37] start to see the plan that's right you
[1:20:39] know predestination some people refer to
[1:20:42] it as the insurance
[1:20:43] plan you know that's the plan but it
[1:20:47] doesn't have to do that God wrote your
[1:20:49] name on a book just so your name would
[1:20:50] be on a book so you could do whatever
[1:20:52] you wanted with your name on the book
[1:20:53] and live like you want wanted but
[1:20:55] knowing your name is on the book and as
[1:20:57] you live whatever you want to do and
[1:20:59] your name's on the book you feel
[1:21:01] satisfied satisfied and hunger are not
[1:21:04] the
[1:21:05] same hunger in your soul is what causes
[1:21:09] Sons and Daughters of God to get
[1:21:11] desperate
[1:21:16] Hallelujah hey how
[1:21:18] about I want to hurry up and close
[1:21:22] here what if we
[1:21:25] offer you a comfortable position as the
[1:21:27] defeated
[1:21:30] Christian we could buy better pews
[1:21:33] chairs whatever we could um boy some of
[1:21:38] you would say amen and some of you would
[1:21:40] be really
[1:21:41] upset um ice cream machine in the
[1:21:46] basement soda
[1:21:49] fountain
[1:21:51] and these are good friends these are
[1:21:53] people I know people that that I would
[1:21:56] say I respect boasting how their church
[1:21:59] now offers
[1:22:01] Donuts Sunday morning and they changed
[1:22:04] their rules and you can now have your
[1:22:06] coffee and your donut in the sanctuary
[1:22:09] during this
[1:22:11] service doesn't that sound good I mean
[1:22:14] imagine a great big apple fritter
[1:22:25] and they do churches are now putting
[1:22:27] recliners
[1:22:28] in and they don't want to disrupt your
[1:22:30] eating your
[1:22:31] donut and in your recliner so now they
[1:22:34] put a credit card machine on the back of
[1:22:36] the deal so you can just reach up there
[1:22:37] and swipe
[1:22:41] it sounds pretty good
[1:22:46] right brother David said no I want
[1:22:49] everybody to know Brother David said
[1:22:52] no yes this is Brother David if you
[1:22:55] don't know
[1:22:57] him but see what's
[1:23:01] happening see what's happening it it's
[1:23:04] just pulling them away an inch maybe a
[1:23:07] centimeter at a time just pulling them
[1:23:11] away pulling them
[1:23:16] away Lord that's not what I want to be
[1:23:19] no sir I don't want to be farther away
[1:23:22] from the Lord tomorrow than I was today
[1:23:25] that's right I don't I don't want to be
[1:23:27] you know farther away in a year and a
[1:23:30] year and a year you see how clever Satan
[1:23:32] is my brother and sister and we talk
[1:23:34] about it so that we can draw people in
[1:23:37] so that we can witness to them who Jesus
[1:23:40] Christ
[1:23:44] is
[1:23:47] my let me jump over a few things
[1:23:50] here look sometimes it seems like the
[1:23:52] Lord's just out to correct us all the
[1:23:54] the time right any of you ever have a
[1:23:56] struggles okay let's stop back
[1:23:59] up how many of you strong willed
[1:24:04] people that it seems like God's opposed
[1:24:07] to your
[1:24:11] program there was a few laughs here I'm
[1:24:13] assuming that that was an admission of
[1:24:17] guilt so if you are that person you see
[1:24:20] it's not a sin to be strong willed it's
[1:24:23] only a sin if you don't submit that will
[1:24:25] to
[1:24:26] God as far as the natural out here the
[1:24:29] guy that you know is just willing to
[1:24:31] Wade through the mud and the crud and
[1:24:33] the whatever to to you know I could tell
[1:24:36] you about my childhood when we were kids
[1:24:39] if there was no mud we just want to have
[1:24:40] a mud fight you just went out in the
[1:24:42] Corell and had a mud fight only that's
[1:24:44] not mud that's
[1:24:48] right some of you are cringing right now
[1:24:54] you see sometimes what will
[1:24:58] is what some are strong sister Carrie
[1:25:01] you just became a candidate is that
[1:25:05] okay sister car's been bucked off a
[1:25:07] horse and it
[1:25:10] hurt if that had been
[1:25:12] Paul that horse would have been in the
[1:25:15] next Parina bag that come out of the
[1:25:21] factory what' sister KY do
[1:25:26] licked her
[1:25:28] wounds
[1:25:30] cried may
[1:25:34] maybe got back on the horse that's
[1:25:38] right some of you would look at the
[1:25:41] horse and say they're dangerous I read
[1:25:43] that somewhere not touching it you see
[1:25:45] how we're all a little bit
[1:25:47] different you know it's like the joke
[1:25:50] about the guy comes home from work
[1:25:51] whining to his wife and she's like
[1:25:53] what's wrong honey and he's like I got a
[1:25:55] paper cut
[1:25:57] today that was a big deal to
[1:26:00] him so some people think God is just
[1:26:03] down on
[1:26:05] them I mean let's you don't have to lift
[1:26:07] a
[1:26:09] hand but there's more Believers that
[1:26:12] think God is angry at them than you
[1:26:15] would
[1:26:17] imagine now you might say it's their
[1:26:20] guilty conscience their
[1:26:22] iniquity that is working on them but it
[1:26:26] doesn't matter as long as they embrace
[1:26:27] the idea that God's angry at
[1:26:30] them but they miss the whole point my
[1:26:32] brother and
[1:26:33] sister that God is not angry at us God
[1:26:37] is Not punishing us God is leading
[1:26:41] us he promised he would and he is
[1:26:45] leading you and just so it happens to
[1:26:48] take you places you don't want to go
[1:26:50] circumstances you don't want to go
[1:26:52] through circumstan that seem that it's
[1:26:55] taking you away from
[1:26:59] God and we don't
[1:27:05] understand that God's quite willing to
[1:27:08] correct us amen that's
[1:27:13] [Music]
[1:27:15] ex quite
[1:27:18] willing but I want you just a quick
[1:27:20] example I want you to understand how God
[1:27:23] can do that sometimes
[1:27:26] times Abraham and
[1:27:28] Sarah not even realizing take this point
[1:27:32] that they were going through a body
[1:27:34] change God blinded their eyes to their
[1:27:38] own body
[1:27:40] change and a king comes
[1:27:43] along see
[1:27:45] Sarah she's so
[1:27:48] beautiful who's going to say that about
[1:27:50] a 90y
[1:27:52] old that's how black Ed Abraham and
[1:27:56] Sarah were to the change taking place in
[1:28:01] them now I want to ask
[1:28:03] you do you have a right to criticize
[1:28:07] what God's doing in your
[1:28:10] life God blinded Abraham and
[1:28:14] Sarah the
[1:28:16] world a Godly Man as the scripture shows
[1:28:19] us decides she's going to be my wife now
[1:28:23] I'm telling you Sarah must have been
[1:28:27] beautiful and Abraham does the lion see
[1:28:31] this this King I forget his name right
[1:28:33] at the moment help me brother yeah it
[1:28:37] it's it's quit laughing at me
[1:28:45] Jerry just lost it
[1:28:49] all the king wasn't wrong he looked out
[1:28:52] saw a beautiful young lady do you guys
[1:28:55] understand in the story beautiful young
[1:28:57] lady I want to marry
[1:28:58] her Abraham does the lion that's right
[1:29:02] and God makes the king do the
[1:29:03] apologizing that's right that's it oh
[1:29:07] think about how God works in our life my
[1:29:09] brother and sister God didn't even hold
[1:29:11] that against Abraham he made the king do
[1:29:14] the apologizing told them if you don't
[1:29:17] your Kingdom's done amen that's right
[1:29:22] amen now that's not ad ating that we do
[1:29:25] things that make everybody apologize for
[1:29:27] our Behavior but I tell you how much God
[1:29:30] guarded the promise that's it not
[1:29:33] promise it looked like punishment to the
[1:29:35] king but in the end God still blessed
[1:29:38] his kingdom because he followed the word
[1:29:40] of the Lord okay are you guys ready for
[1:29:42] me to be
[1:29:44] done you see my brother and
[1:29:47] sister people look at the scripture
[1:29:49] sometimes and think oh the preacher's
[1:29:51] preaching at me well if the preacher was
[1:29:53] preaching preaching at you and he was
[1:29:55] that carnal to preach at you now I'm
[1:29:57] going to put it in this strong of words
[1:29:59] if the car if the preacher was that
[1:30:01] carnal to say you know what I I I'm
[1:30:03] going to I'm just going to preach at you
[1:30:05] brother I'm just going to hammer you you
[1:30:08] know this way and that way and whatever
[1:30:10] things might be or I'm going to preach
[1:30:12] at you my brother and sister if that was
[1:30:15] the way you're doing then you're in the
[1:30:17] wrong Church anyhow that's right right
[1:30:21] but if the preacher comes along and says
[1:30:22] look that music that you've started
[1:30:24] listening to
[1:30:26] again the office party where they
[1:30:28] offered you a sip of Brandy and you took
[1:30:30] it is nothing but an open door to go
[1:30:34] back where you came
[1:30:36] from this little deal over
[1:30:39] here if I could speak strongly enough
[1:30:42] the prophet of God dealt with it my
[1:30:44] brother and sister so I feel I can deal
[1:30:46] with it we're wearing what we're wearing
[1:30:48] sisters because that's what they sell in
[1:30:50] the store look let's not judge what
[1:30:53] those skirts and dresses and whatever
[1:30:56] are appropriate because that's what they
[1:30:57] sell in the store we need to find what
[1:31:00] it is that reflects who we are in Jesus
[1:31:03] Christ we're not called to look like
[1:31:06] them we're not called to act like them
[1:31:08] and the prophet of God said if they
[1:31:10] don't have anything there they still
[1:31:12] sell goods and sewing machines amen
[1:31:15] let's stop and look at ourselves let's
[1:31:17] let's put the word of God in our own
[1:31:19] life in our own household and let's
[1:31:21] stand and let it reflect what we we
[1:31:24] really are are we the world right amen
[1:31:28] my
[1:31:28] goodness one foot in the world and one
[1:31:31] foot in glory how's that going to work
[1:31:35] it
[1:31:36] doesn't and I'm not preaching close
[1:31:39] clothline religion please don't
[1:31:41] misunderstand me but you see we got to
[1:31:43] stop and we got to look at ourself and
[1:31:45] say what am I
[1:31:48] reflecting and when God wants to deal
[1:31:51] with you don't think it's the preacher's
[1:31:53] opinion
[1:31:54] if it's in the word of God that's it
[1:31:56] amen H come on come on it's sometimes
[1:31:59] it's just time for us to come to a place
[1:32:01] and say do I look like a daughter of God
[1:32:04] or do I look like a fashion statement
[1:32:05] that's exactly right oh my my brother
[1:32:08] and sister you see even us Brothers you

[1:34:09] that right sister Ruth comes so I will
[1:34:15] stop I just uh if you'll just start
[1:34:19] playing something real low Romans 9 want
[1:34:21] you to catch this 9 and 22- 26 what if
[1:34:26] God willing to show his wrath to make
[1:34:28] his power known endured with much
[1:34:30] longsuffering the vessels of Wrath
[1:34:34] fitted to
[1:34:37] destruction you talk about an awesome
[1:34:39] God that we serve a patient God he's
[1:34:42] even patient with the unbeliever that's
[1:34:46] right I may be like no you're just a
[1:34:49] vessel of Wrath done God's patient with
[1:34:53] them
[1:34:54] example I'll cut out a little other
[1:34:56] notes Here amen
[1:34:59] Cain he's there he's
[1:35:03] angry and God
[1:35:05] says if you
[1:35:09] would back up a little bit
[1:35:11] Kan just do the right
[1:35:14] thing and I'll accept you that's
[1:35:18] it you realize what that was God

[1:35:27] exactly right that's how tell me that
[1:35:30] isn't love tell me that isn't love the
[1:35:35] world wants to twist the Bible oh if he
[1:35:37] loved if he really loved if God was love
[1:35:39] my brother and sister he offered
[1:35:41] Redemption to the seed of
[1:35:45] Lucifer if that isn't love amen if that
[1:35:49] isn't a patient caring loving God but
[1:35:52] you see the very nature of Cain would
[1:35:55] not allow him he had the opportunity
[1:35:58] that just shakes you and I that we would
[1:36:00] be there in our heart today we would say
[1:36:03] yes Lord I want that Lord but he's right
[1:36:07] there offered Redemption yes sir and he
[1:36:10] turns it down
[1:36:12] flat if you won't take me like I
[1:36:15] am you want to know that's a spirit of
[1:36:18] denomination
[1:36:20] today take me like I Am Lord
[1:36:24] in fact I'll add a few more tattoos and
[1:36:26] I'll do a little bit more of this and
[1:36:28] I'll go and you know there's that guy
[1:36:30] that sings with all those religious
[1:36:32] groups has got this long beautiful gray
[1:36:34] hair now it used to be brown and he's on
[1:36:37] some deal just talking about how the
[1:36:39] Lord told him that's what he should
[1:36:42] be that's not what the word said that's
[1:36:45] exactly
[1:36:47] right Cain coming back okay first off
[1:36:50] you got to reject Abel's offering
[1:36:54] y you realize if God would have
[1:36:55] compromised with Cain it wouldn't have
[1:36:57] been long he would have been demanding
[1:36:59] that Abel's offering would be
[1:37:04] unacceptable God didn't compromise no
[1:37:07] you come right back here to the
[1:37:10] word I'll spare you I'll give you life
[1:37:13] you can't do
[1:37:18] it
[1:37:21] amen let me just go along
[1:37:28] I skipped over a couple things but we're
[1:37:29] message Believers here today we can we
[1:37:32] can reach out and grasp
[1:37:33] this the word is telling us what is
[1:37:36] there for
[1:37:37] us does that make sense the word's
[1:37:40] telling us very clearly what is there
[1:37:42] for us you I mean is there's no
[1:37:45] misunderstanding what is there for
[1:37:51] us and you know what it's all so telling
[1:37:54] us the power he's gave you as Sons and
[1:37:57] Daughters of God there's more amen
[1:38:00] praise the Lord there's more to be
[1:38:02] released we haven't got the full uh the
[1:38:05] full uh uh
[1:38:08] uh amount amen I had another word there
[1:38:11] and I just can't grasp it we we're not
[1:38:13] not sitting here oh we've got it all we
[1:38:15] got it all no God's showing us Amen in
[1:38:18] other words I'm not using myself an
[1:38:21] example for anything more than the
[1:38:22] example
[1:38:24] what I've got right
[1:38:26] now Lord I want more that's it isn't
[1:38:29] that the daily life of a christianen
[1:38:32] lord I want more of you I want more of
[1:38:36] you Lord day by day Lord I need more of
[1:38:40] you see God moving on us in that fashion
[1:38:45] amen there has been Power released and
[1:38:49] there's more Amen to be released amen
[1:38:52] amen because the word shows us very
[1:38:54] clearly as we close the word has showed
[1:38:57] us very clearly that you have everything
[1:39:00] it takes for this age absolutely really
[1:39:05] amen back to my question earlier when
[1:39:08] you got up this morning did you feel
[1:39:11] like you had
[1:39:13] everything for this
[1:39:17] age
[1:39:19] no I'm pretty sure I can say this with
[1:39:22] authority yeah you didn't feel like you
[1:39:25] had everything that's
[1:39:27] right amen but God said it anyway amen
[1:39:32] that's right now mornings like this
[1:39:35] morning you just have to decide whether
[1:39:37] you believe the word or you believe
[1:39:38] yourself exactly right amen maybe after
[1:39:41] a couple three four five cups of coffee
[1:39:44] maybe it helped you come out of your
[1:39:46] lethargic position and realize oh it's
[1:39:52] Sunday I'm supposed to be
[1:39:57] happy that's come on
[1:40:00] Saints God's given his
[1:40:03] word his word holds amen it's faithful
[1:40:07] it's true amen
[1:40:09] amen
[1:40:13] hallelujah well we made it to the
[1:40:15] halfway point of the
[1:40:18] sermon in these scriptures right here it
[1:40:20] says that all creation is waiting for
[1:40:23] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:40:26] Amen you can't see out these windows
[1:40:29] right here but if we could you look
[1:40:30] right out there we're not waiting on
[1:40:32] them no they're waiting on us amen I
[1:40:36] heard a brother here some time back I
[1:40:38] think just a little misunderstood of
[1:40:40] what the scripture was and he was
[1:40:42] talking about like we the bride are
[1:40:44] waiting on them but do you realize my
[1:40:47] brother and sister God's not going to
[1:40:50] take an immature
[1:40:51] bride I take you if the bride was ready
[1:40:54] for the Rapture if God's timetable let
[1:40:57] me put it that way don't want to put it
[1:40:59] on any individuals if God's timetable
[1:41:01] was such Russia the Morning News would
[1:41:05] be Russia was in wherever taking over
[1:41:08] the oil wells just like the prophet
[1:41:10] prophesied all of these little things
[1:41:12] that we think we're waiting for would
[1:41:14] take place just like
[1:41:16] this I
[1:41:19] mean what's that to God
[1:41:23] what God is more concerned about is your
[1:41:26] character my character
[1:41:29] molded into His
[1:41:32] Image that's right amen we're not going
[1:41:34] to look like humans in Le
[1:41:36] oia although this
[1:41:39] form right Jesus Christ didn't come
[1:41:41] looking any different than you and I
[1:41:43] that's right so we understand what the
[1:41:45] physical form would be that's right but
[1:41:49] within that physical form is the form
[1:41:52] that is the reflection of the Perfection
[1:41:55] amen oh Lord I want to be the reflection
[1:41:57] of the Perfection Hallelujah let me stop
[1:42:00] I didn't realize I had so many notes
[1:42:02] Here I really truly only made it about
[1:42:04] halfway down the
[1:42:05] page Oh My Oh My Brother David why do we
[1:42:10] do this to
[1:42:12] ourselves okay Jesus on the authority of
[1:42:16] the
[1:42:17] word and then we're done
[1:42:23] you see all those scriptures I had never
[1:42:25] made it
[1:42:27] to you see what I mean others we could
[1:42:30] refer to but people Christianity and the
[1:42:33] way they have it today is so
[1:42:38] shallow 1954 it was
[1:42:43] shallow how much more
[1:42:47] shallow no wonder the unbeliever can
[1:42:50] hardly see how to believe Christianity
[1:42:53] that should we should have that in bold
[1:42:56] letters no
[1:42:58] wonder they don't see any difference
[1:43:00] between their life and
[1:43:04] Christianity because it's no more than a
[1:43:07] form but Christianity is real in its
[1:43:09] power and if it's just ceremonial any
[1:43:12] other any other ceremony would take its
[1:43:15] place I have nothing against lodges but
[1:43:17] masonry Odd Fellows or any of them would
[1:43:20] be just as well if it's ceremony it has
[1:43:23] its good and bad just like the church
[1:43:25] but Christianity is a living being in
[1:43:33] mankind Hallelujah a living being we're
[1:43:35] not just here with some kind of we
[1:43:37] follow the message and hold up a message
[1:43:40] book a church age book and say this is
[1:43:42] what we follow we follow Jesus Christ
[1:43:45] amen amen and this is why this message
[1:43:48] the prophet of God said it would never
[1:43:50] this message would never become a
[1:43:52] denomination
[1:43:53] because Jesus Christ is not a
[1:43:56] denomination oh Hallelujah that makes me
[1:43:59] excited amen hallelujah is a living
[1:44:02] being in mankind that's the proof of the
[1:44:05] resurrection of God's son who was God
[1:44:08] With Us that's right oh Hallelujah let's
