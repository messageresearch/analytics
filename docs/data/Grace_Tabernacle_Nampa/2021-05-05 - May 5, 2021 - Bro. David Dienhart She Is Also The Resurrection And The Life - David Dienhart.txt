grace hallelujah grace doesn't have the struggle grace we trust amen amen thank the lord for faith amen you can if you'd stand with me this tonight i'd like to go right straight to the word i'm thankful for this time i have and just to express what god laid in my heart i had something that's been on my mind for my heart here for about two or three weeks four weeks and thought that's the way it would go and the lord was opening that really quickening that to me further this morning when i got home it changed completely and i feel like the lord wanted me to bring this and then next the next time we speak the lord willing i'd like to bring the other so god knows how to do things just right he knows what the people need and who's here and i felt it would be more appropriate maybe to bring the next one when everybody on a sunday was was present but tonight this is the revelation of the hour amen and we just are thankful we have the revelation of the album the message of the hour the unveiling of the word which we are by grace here again by grace through faith a part of i'm so thankful for that to know who we are and it's becoming clear and clear and that's what's taking us in a rapture and that's where we're standing today and i'm thankful for that time let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer our heavenly father as we as we open the bible here lord any man as your prophet said can open the bible but it takes the holy spirit to break it to open it up to reveal it and father we know that a message in this hour has come forth a full revelation of jesus christ so that we can go home lord and we know without the unveiling of yourself there be no rapture so we thank you lord for the completeness of the revelation and this hour that you've hid in the back part of your mind and held it and would make it known in this hour when the book would be taken and the claim made on your bride we thank you for this lord we thank you for mercy and grace now father bless your word open my mouth to what you want said close it to what you would not have said i'm dependent upon thee lord i have no ability in myself i'm strictly an instrument of yours and lord as far as i know completely submitted to you and lord jesus i pray that you would open your word in the hearts of these believers tonight by revelation we pray that you would reveal it there is a people here have the ability to hear from god and we are thankful for them lord and thankful to be a part of this great unveiling of yourself that will take us right into a body change lord so thankful for that revelation of rapture that is progressing increasing lord day by day blessed be your name and for your glory we pray amen amen turn with me to second corinthians the fourth chapter i have a couple scriptures and i'll let you be seated i want to title this an interesting title but and very straightforward she is talking of the bride she is also the resurrection and the life she is also the resurrection and the life amen now that's a little that that may choke some carnal believers but i don't believe there's carnal believers here i believe we can receive the word for the hour and time we're in because we're not talking about humanism here we're talking about the unveiling of the word and and it's not a human knowledge it's not some human exercise and and something we're we're learning by man's teaching this is the this is what's known by the revelation of the word given by the spirit spoken through a prophet amen i i just thankful for the spoken word because we wouldn't make it in a rapture without spoken word the original seed and that's what's coming our day and that's what's that's what's called us and that's what's that's what's bringing us home amen so ii corinthians 4 and um let's see believe we start with the 16th verse let's just start with the 13th i just go back to that point right there so then death or excuse me we having the same spirit i just want to put emphasis on that of faith same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed and therefore have i spoken isn't that just exactly what true confession is amen that's what god acts on that's why the bible said hold fast the confession of your faith amen he said because it's not it's not human faith it's god's own faith the bride's faith is god's own faith we have the faith of god being born of god we have the faith of god amen and god is opening his word the faith of god in us is the holy spirit himself and god reveals himself to us as we have need of it you believe that yes absolutely he's he's he's already determined you to be in the body change amen so so he said so we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believe therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes isn't that lovely that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many rebound to the glory of god for which cause we faint not but though our outward man i put emphasis there for which cause we faint not but though our outward man emphasis perishes perish yet inward man i put emphasis on that is renewed revived renewed day by day so you're you're the little bride's living in a revival she has a revival amen she's in revival it's not a reviving excuse me let me just say like it's the reviving of what you've got amen it's bringing you up it's it's reviving it's revival going on in the bride it's a bride's revival it's actually a rapture revival and but the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory now i want to make i want to emphasize 16th verse and also the 18th while we look not we look not at the things which are seen now we're looking here by faith we're now now it's it's not if we look by faith it's not looking at things which are seen but the things which are not seen amen all right for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal but you're looking at it amen are you with me that's faith because faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen amen all right now i want you to go to the scripture with me in saint john 14. saint john 14 and i'd like to to read here 19 and 20. let's just take the 18th verse with it i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you see me because i live you shall live also now now that was before the resurrection are you with me he said you shall and they have and brother branham almost every situation when he said throw that scripture he said because i live you live also are you with me are you uh you kept that change there yeah and if you're if you're not born again and predestinated to be born again you shall live again you shall live also but those that are in christ are living they've risen there's been a resurrection within them of the word amen is that that without that you wouldn't have no resurrection of the body amen is that right all right let's go on here a little further he said at that day now now a little while because i live you let me just say it the way the prophet because i live you live also ye live also at that day you shall know not imagine not hope so this is faith at that day you shall know revelation that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you now with that scripture it tells you who you are amen all right you may be seated faith sees what god sees amen faith sees what god sees faith sees what god wants you to see amen faith sees what god sees and faith will always humble itself to the word faith humbles itself amen all right brother branham on the message uh rising of the son because i live he said you live also because i live you live also he said speaking to his wife because i live ye live also who's he speaking to is there any wife here tonight he's speaking to his wife because i live ye live also because i live you live also what a resurrection that was i made say amen what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead amen be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power amen by what god's quickening power what did he come to quicken what did he what did he send out his word for what he what he what did he send himself forth through the word to do quicken his seed amen ephesians 1 4 if you'd like to turn with me to these scriptures ephesians 1 4 very familiar scriptures but oh the scriptures can be familiar and that's good but it's the revelation those scriptures hold it's quickened to us see we don't preach the letter we preach the spirit the letter everybody's got the letter it's not the letter the letter killeth but the spirit to have the spirit is to have the mind of christ to have the mind of the letter the mind of the word amen all right according as he has chosen us where in him wonderful he has chosen us in him who's him eternal life we are chosen in him hallelujah before the foundation of the world see it didn't have anything to do with it didn't have a thing to do with it amen he chose us in him now is the devil going to come and take you out of him when he chose you in him like we preached one time you see the plague can't come nigh our dwelling this isn't it our dwelling is christ our habitation's in christ there's no plague going to come nigh that devil can't reach in and take you out of him out of that habitation brother brahm said christ is our temple we are his temple hallelujah amen all right so but because he said i live you live also and you're chosen in him before the foundation of the world that you should be holy and without blame well that's a good one who can lay anything to the charge of god's elect who can lay anything to their account and say you did this who what sin can be imputed to the elect hallelujah no sin imputed to the elect bride there's none because if you impute sin to the elect bride you've imputed it to christ amen and you can't impute sin to him he's perfect and so the bride in him has to be perfect the bride in him would be what he is she can be in him and not be what he is all right with that so the so the scripture says i mean the yes the scripture says that's what i'm talking about tonight but the prophet said this said it several places different little different ways it says all that he was we are all that he was we are she is also the resurrection in the life all right saint john 11 saint john 11 verse 25 26 this is jesus at the grace of grave of lazarus jesus said unto her this is martha said unto martha i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me now the prophet noted that in me when he quoted john 3 16. he said he that believeth in me amen he said when did we believe in him when were we believers in him did we just become a believer in him no we always were a believer in him we just had to realize it by the unveiling of the word for our season because we were predestinated to be the word manifested for the season in this hour this day is our day amen you were ordained to manifest the word for this season not another season not even his season but this season amen i'm talking about his season i'm talking about the calvary man season of when he came to give his life yet it's all christ in his season amen all right verse 26. now verse 23 again i am the resurrection and the life he that belie i was going to title this i am the resurrection the life and i thought well to make it a little more pointed she is also this yes all right i am the resurrection the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth where in me shall never die whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe this thou this the question is here tonight believe us thou this amen all right so all that he was we are every seed remember every seed will bring forth of its kind every seed will bring forth of his kind you have a farmer ought to say amen to that every seed shall bring forth of its own kind is that right you don't plant a wheat and get corn that's right didn't and you don't plant the word seed and not get the word jesus christ it could be planted in you the seed of god and not have jesus christ is that right all right so he said so we go on here every seat will bring fourth was kind what is this bride but he she is himself revealed the bride is himself i say eve but it wasn't eve at that time until she had cain and abel then she was the mother of all living that's what eve meant that's when he called her e but before that her name was adam adam's wife was the was the was adam revealed in morphe is that right she was another form of adam she she had the same spirit adam had amen amen that's right it's not another different body same spirit same dirt same flesh but a different but a different form amen but she was adam she wasn't identified nothing else she was adam if you saw her you'd see adam now this is what it had to come back to in this revelation of himself in this day because without that there be no rapture it took this revelation to bring about the eden again amen because when that when that's manifest god has a bride and what did it take to do that unveiling of himself all right so let's continue on the bride is himself revealed he was not only the mechanics god's word now see the god's word has the octane oh the words full of power yes it is but it's mechanics until the dynamics come on is that right so he's not only the mechanics he was not only the mechanic now put the bride here because i'm speaking of him the bride's the same he was not only the mechanics god's word he was the dynamics to prove it amen not only did was he mechanics he had dynamics not only was he not only is she mechanic she's the dynamics he said brother david she's not the dynamic yes she is she is the dynamics the prophet said that holy spirit in you is who you are he that's joined to the lord is one spirit so what's this union take talking about it's bringing us to that oneness that revelation the growing up into who we are the foundation was laid is that right what's the foundation upon this rock i will build my church the revelation of who i am he said i'll build my church and she'll grow up to be who i am then god's place god's place of worship what is the bride it's his body that's where he put his name he put his name in his body amen he put his name in his house in his place of worship hallelujah all right see we're taking god likes to take the fear and scare out of your body and all your mistakes and failures god likes to take it out of you say well i failed devil's right there i'm ready to accuse you isn't he but see we don't serve god by senses we can't contact god by our senses we contact god through amen faith we contact god through faith god's given us his faith to contact him amen amen that's right no so he said he he was the mechanics he was dynamics to prove it and as he's being the groom the bride has to come forth i'm i'm i'm bringing this out of seed is now there with the shock no out of excuse me out of the rising of the sun and he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's a part of him glory it's a part of him and it can only be the manifestation what is this part of him it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations and any others has spoke of the bride it can only be manifest see if of what spoke of the bride was revealed in the groom amen he was the fullness of the godhead bodily is that right when he went to calvary you were in him when he raised you were in him he was the fullness you had to be there amen hallelujah it's victory we're not fighting to get victory we have victory we already have victory we are his victory hello we are his victory amen all right so he said it can only manifest what this bride can only manifest what the groom it can only manifest what he is it can only be his character god is not going to have a bride that's different character it's going to be his cone character amen she come from the she's come from the same source what source the same source he came from amen as a son if we come from the same source where were you before the foundation of the world when the sons of god shouted for joy see where were you you were in eternal life that makes you eternal now you can't be eternal then and not eternal now but that took the word to open that up to you to awaken you to your position and your place because brother brown said you were born in sin shaped iniquity you come with that with that seed germ of life already in there planted but he said you were under darkness and darkness held it down held that that soul he said held over that soul but he said you were to come forth and he said so he sent the light and when he sent the light he said he said all he's got to do is get that soul of yours to agree with him and the darkness is broken and the life comes forth it's already laying there hallelujah i am the resurrection in the life amen the i am you and i are both i ams that's right exactly what we are amen you say well that's present tense that's right it's christ present day you know what the gates of hell are against the divine revelation of christ being here now hallelujah the divine revelation of christ being here now he said is what all hell is against satan hates that manifestation but we are here to be the manifestation of the word for this hour amen and not only this hour all seven ages we are the we are the climaxing manifestation of his revelation he climaxes it coming forth he coming forth in the form of a bride of his wife i wonder if you see the promise of the hour the promised word for the hour what the book has opened up is the mystery hiding in you amen it was always in you it's laying in you you're the mystery revealed that's what calls your name that's what's laying in the book hallelujah amen all right i'm not saying these things be cliches and all this this is genuine reality this isn't some idea it's reality not just a word to us anymore it's not just a word it's reality the word has become alive the word is alive living the bride is the word living and brother paul here it is inaction the bride is the word living and in action and how can we be an action without a proper preparedness of being two wings over our face and two wings over our feet now we can come into action when we humble ourselves to the word well we look not at things that are seen but the things which are not seen our focus isn't on what's seen our faith doesn't recognize that our faith recognizes what's not seen there's a greater vision here amen we have a greater vision than what we see we see the unseen not with these eyes with this eye and that's more real than what we see here because what we see here is just temporal hallelujah all right now see it does something the bride has to be manifested and if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life life of his life spirit of his spirit power of his power she is another person she is him she is him this is what makes the bride such an oddball this is what makes the bride a nut but look at the bolts she's holding together amen drawing drawing drawing what are we drawing the third pull is doing the drawing it's a third pull what else do we have to preach but the third bull that's right thank god he got our attention thank god we see the son of man but the revealing of the son of man was to unite the two together hallelujah all right now remember in communion i was going to read that i'll just bypass it because of time but he did say one little thing here he said where was it he said what was it he saw the elements of freezing elements he said there was two natures he said born of charles nelli branham but in there was another nature present too predestinated was in there by god in this body two natures in there is that right you are sitting here tonight born of the spirit of god with two natures sitting in here but one is greater than the other and you have to recognize what is the other what is the one that's greater is who you are satan's trying to hide that from you he say he wants to identify you as your mistakes and failures when that isn't how god identifies you at all god's already identified you in him god's already identified you perfect god's already identified you sinless if you have the holy spirit that wrote this word abiding in you the person of christ revealed in you which is who you are you are sinless it's a new creation it's a new race and he was the beginning of that race hallelujah he was the firstborn he was a spoken word birth is that right the the birth of jesus christ matthew 18 or matthew 1 18 as unthis wise what about the birth of the bride is on this wise not physically spiritually to come into a physical change it's already begun it's already begun right it's already begun you've already got you've already have if you have the holy ghost you already have the identification that you've come to the blood and accepted without that identification you're not sure whether you come through the blood if you are sure that faith is in you god's going to identify it by giving you his life and then living that life through you to the hour to the time you're going to hear and receive the word for the season talk about a perfect evidence there it is amen all right because not everybody is called to receive it is that right not everybody's called to receive that everybody can there's a special people in the land today i say special i'm not afraid to say that the bride is special her husband is special there's a union here taking place they're no longer going are twain they're becoming one for the wedding supper brother brahm said we are in the marriage now he said not the rapture the rapture is going to a wedding supper not the marriage he said we're being united now we're putting on the garment of his life now amen and he said the revealing of the son of man would unite those two together what does our message today what did he do he unveiled himself unveiled in a full revelation of himself and here she comes here comes the bride glory hallelujah hallelujah all right she is him and as a man and woman are one the woman taken from his side amen you believe that the elements were taken from his side this is what you're made up here of water blood spirit the holy spirit is the witness and if you have the witness then the witness in you is greater than he that's in the world amen we'll get into that in just a minute all right she had taken the spirit talking about eve the feminist spirit from him the flesh from his side made see in in spirit they weren't different are you with me same spirit that's what makes them together what makes the oneness not the flesh the spirit amen hallelujah all right now the spirit of him and the flesh of him put it together made dynamic mechanics and dynamics brother branham said she's got to be the word not for his day but the word of promise for this day that's what she's got to be that's got to be manifest how many know that and when it's manifest and you're seeing it you can say this day this scripture is being fulfilled in me and through me you're fulfilling scripture hallelujah the word is being fulfilled it's been written now it's being manifested hallelujah all right now see she's got to be the word not for his day but of this day that he promised would be in this day that he sent his word for to mold his bride and make her as i said upon this rock i'll build my church been laid right there and the gates of hell can't prevail against that it's a revelation of jesus christ in you which is who you are that is revealed in you that's the birth amen how may is with me that's the new birth that's the birth word that's who you are you're that new birth and you you had a name change amen that's right amen so be it lord so be it unto me according to thy word all right paragraph 151 now and brother branham said here let me finish this up on he said what was in there what was down inside of me i saw that seed and these things coming forth that other predestinated pushed in there he said what was it there was another william branham see watch what he called a little spot of eternal life down there of the genes of god the word of god that was placed in there it was working amen boy when you can come to communion table like that that's the revelation that god sees that's what you're testifying to on these sacraments right there that's what you're testifying of i am his and he is mine and i am one with his body i'm in fellowship with jesus christ i'm testifying of my faith i died with him i raised with him and everything that he did for me at calvary is mine i'm not saying come well don't take it if you don't feel like it i thought what i'm talking about you take it because it's a revelation brother brahma said you take it because it's a revelation that i'm a part of him and i'm a part of you and it's not a second-handed revelation somebody tell you that no it's revealed to you personally you see brother sister this is an individual it's affair a group affair it's an individual affair between you and god it's individual but there's one thing g what the lord will not do he can't lead you off his word he can do anything he wants to do in any way but he'll never lead you out of that word so you have an absolute and the absolute lives in you amen the absolute is in you living if i'm not careful i'll get into this other message that i was going into so i'll back it off a little bit but on paragraph 151 of this day this scripture is fulfilled watch the promise i said here's the promise jesus made the promise watch here he says now we found out the conditions of the world we see where the church nominal is and organization denomination we see where they are we see where the nations are we see that that's this day these promises is fulfilled of course disasters he talked about earthquakes divers places all these things being fulfilled but then he says now now now he's coming right down to the day we're in now his corner been turned here the corner has been turned out of pentecost we haven't done away with luther's message we haven't done away with wesley's message we haven't done away the pentecostal message but it's not our message of the hour the message of the hour is what those things made way for amen you have those you have luther wesley you have pentecost now what do you have the seed again the token amen because what follows it is the token himself amen amen many many men i'd like to stay on that for about another hour all right watch what he now but in this day he's identifying a day he said but in this day there is to come a super royal seed of abraham that's exactly what it would be that's exactly what it'd be would be a royal bride to the royal promised son as i spoke last night it won't be a natural seed it will be a spiritual seed amen amen which is greater the natural the spiritual amen which is eternal that's pretty easy to answer and because the natural's temporal so it won't be a natural seed it will be an eternal spiritual seed of god his own seed all right now he said as i spoke last night it will be natural be spiritual seed there is to be there is to be a royal a spiritual bride raise up which will be the royal seed of the royal faith boy there's a lot of things in this to be the royal seed of the royal faith of the abraham's royal son she is to come on the scene in the last days and the time and the place is a promise that's given to her glory to god now you see your message it's himself in bride form why does that have to come to manifestation because it's the same with adam and sarah or abraham and sarah in the natural in order to have the promised sun amen where was that sun coming through sarah abraham and sarah is that right there had to be a union made there had to be a change to have it amen then they could meet the sun what's taking place in us there's a spiritual union taking place there's an invisible union taking place in order to meet the sun we've got to have that union we are bringing forth the royal seed the royal sun without this it wouldn't come in a manifestation there would be no meeting in the air but you know what that wasn't a public show when that took place the son of man revealed himself and looked like nothing else happened and all the time we're being changed and bringing forth the sun is that right it wasn't publicly known was it wasn't a public show it wasn't known to the public it was the seventh seal right there we see it right there amen right there we see it right here revealed right in abraham and sarah you can take these seals all the way through the bible take that seventh seal go all the way through the bible with it start it in genesis right down here to where we are and we're saying this day this scripture is fulfilled satan can't have it satan can't know it satan can't know that third pull but we are in it because we are that third pull we are the open word boy that's becoming real all right but see she's to come on the scene in the last days and there's scriptures to back up revelations 10. malachi 4 luke 17 30. on and on we could go all right i gotta hurry so that's to come on the scene how how would how would he make his bride by the word revealed to her alone first john first john 3 9. first john 3 9 whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed his seed couldn't be born of god without the seed you cannot be born of god without the seed there that's why many can have the anointing on their spirit the anointing of the true holy ghost anointing even be baptized in their spirit and never hear the word for the season can't hear it why because it's not in their soul they do signs miracles wonders dance shout speak in tongues and live under a denominational spirit that's exactly right i preached that last time i preached here so i'm going to go into all that i'd like to finish it don't know if i will but anyway but that's pretty obvious and pretty clear brother brown said talking about that he said that needs to be preached on in this day that's what he said it needs to be talked about and preached about amen all right but anyway let's keep going so he that's bored his seed remaineth in him and cannot he cannot sin sin is unbelief he cannot sin singular sin unbelief because he is born of god amen if you're born of god whoever whatever god is you are so you're a little god brother brown said he said i don't want to choke you but a man surrendered completely god is omnipotent that right completely submitted surrendered to god that's the full picture today that's what's happening and i don't want to start on that that's later all right john 1 13. keep that born of god john 1 13 we come back if you want to turn john chapter 1 verse 13 which were born as many as received him to them gave ye power to become sons of god even to them that would believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh see no denominational manhandling in the birth of the word bride virgin all right see which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor of the will of the ball man makes me happy not born of the will of man no man handling in this virgin born word bride all right he said see order the will of man but of god amen and we could go to first john or first peter 1 23 and show that we were born by the word and the word will never pass away is that right that word can never pass away can never fail it can never pass away that word hallelujah that word brother brown said if you be that word you can't pass away either see because he said my word will never pass away and the word but the word of the lord we're born by an incorruptible by the word of god the seed the we're not born of corruptible see we're born of the incorrupt by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever but the word of the lord endureth forever and this is the word by which the gospel is preached unto you amen so the revelation has got to be preached you say i'm wondering how many are going to receive it those that will receive it are those that have the ability to hear it we just preach it i'm not paul isn't brother's brother here is not responsible for you receiving anything boy i don't hear any men that's amazing that's the truth you're not responsible for that you're responsible for bringing it it takes the pressure all off it stops a lot of complexes about others it can't receive it like what just goes in one ear and out the other they never change we're preaching that we're preaching that we're preaching and then never change it's not for you to change them you can't change them but you can preach it as god gives it to you you preach that faith and those that have an ear to hear will hear it and they'll be changed by that word for faith comes by hearing the word not the word for another season the word for this season amen that's right that's what has to be ministered we aren't responsible brother said for them getting it we're not responsible for them receiving it or how they act or how they respond to it well that's a good one didn't it i remember when the lord quickened that to me it just lifted a ten thousand pound weight off of me it made me have a lot of liberty to preach the word who am i to judge whether this one can receive it or not by the way they look right isn't that right who can i judge because they look at me and they how do i know what's going on in their heart but their fruit will manifest pretty soon what's in their heart you don't put anybody in you don't put anybody out i don't care how many tattoos and earrings they have on or anything else that's not putting anybody in or out you preach the truth you preach the word for the season and the bride predestinated seed for the season will receive it and not only is it being preached it's being lived it's not well i hope i live it today no you've got to live it today because you're born of god is that right and if you're not living it he'll show you you're not living and he'll correct you how many have that confidence you do anything wrong he gives us a lot of liberty if we do anything a little thing wrong he said he'll show you and what will be your response yes lord forgive me you change amen first john 5 12. first john 5 12. i thought i had a short sermon this month that's a typical statement isn't it a preacher all right now the witness of god is greater verse chapter 5 first john 5 10 he that believeth on the son of god hath the witness in himself he that believes not god hath made him a liar because he believeth not the record that god gave of his son and this is the record that god has given to us eternal life god has no other record of you bride no other record satan will come up and accuse they did this and it is but god says there's no record there is no record of it all right you have one record he's given you and that's eternal life all right and this life is in his son and he who hath the son man and he who hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son of god hath not life in galatians chapter one verse verse 16. paul's saying in verse 15 but when it pleased god who separated brother brother paul said i never received what i received by man i was taught it by the revelation of jesus christ all right then he comes down the line here and he said but it when it pleased god who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal that's unveil to reveal his son in me he that hath the son hath life to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood how can you preach him and have no revelation of him then all you're preaching is the denominational manhandling is intellectual teaching of the message that's right exactly right and listen if if just that that old denominational spirits already put him out right that shuck put him out that denominational spirit's already done put him out you're not in there you don't belong in there you don't belong even being influenced by them and if you're not discerning what that spirit is you need a new birth that's pretty strong statement but that's the truth because you're looking at something other than the revealed word for the hour made manifest you're looking at something that's dividing not bringing unity under the word that's right i'll let the pastor pick it up from there all right when you come face to face with him the problem is not the exact word that's very close when you come face to face with him you've come to yourself you come to yourself now where do you find that brother david second corinthians 4 6 god who commanded the light to shine of the darkness has shined in our hearts to give the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ in the very person himself there you are therefore we have this treasure in earth and vessels right there you go right there it is all right amen that the that the power is not of david or paul or anyone else it's of god we are of god little you are of god little children and have overcome them what overcome who antichrist spirit you cannot bring that denominational antichrist spirit down here no matter how nicely they are how good a people they are how nicely the dress how much they shout how much all those things and then deny the truth of the word being lived before them and being preached to before them just exactly how he's preached same spirit and say you have fellowship with that there's no fellowship with that amen where is our fellowship it's two men in one ship our fellowship isn't out here we can have human fellowship but that fellowship won't amount to nothing when it comes down to spiritual fellowship you're in the same ship therein you're just like brother brother paul and i talking on the phone like goodness sakes we'd gone all day yeah because why there was fellowship we were just there was no barrier there we just we knew we just speak something and exactly what we're speaking of others scratch your head and say i don't know what he's coming from you see there's carnal believers and then there's spiritual believers there's make believers and there's unbelievers in the message they're believers amen are you with me but there's a true believer that's the seed of god you'll say who do you think you are nothing oh well wait a minute who do i think i am nothing but who does he think i am and who do i think by his thoughts i am i'm jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that has nothing to do with david but it's manifested through david okay and that's what stirs up the devil that's what he's trying to stop he hates the manifestation of the word because that's light and light when it's put on darkness exposes it and that's the problem right there that's what he hates he hates that manifested word for the season amen amen if i could emphasize that i would all right god has come in full view of you are ready are there any seed here children of god then god has come he has come in full full view of you the perfect then has come the veil's taken off the veil has been rent you're looking you're looking right into the glass the magnification of the word and said that's me you're looking right at him in the in the mirror of the word and saying that's me amen that's exactly what god wanted you to see that's why he unveiled himself that's why the seventh seal opened that you would recognize your day and hour that you're in when the sleeping virgin's going out there for oil trying to get it shouting and dancing all the way and trying to speak in tongues brother man i got the quote on i just read he said and they're trying to get they're trying to get oil trying to get oil and he said don't you realize that's the time the bridegroom came and left them and he said and the bride was ready and went in who makes her ready yeah how is she ready don't you realize that back here in 1962 don't you realize they're trying to get oil david duplici's he said is out there trying to trying to he said my ministry brother brown has to call them out to call out of babylon to do what he said trying to get him to all thinking they're coming into a pentecostal realm of getting the oil they're trying to buy oil he said don't you realize and he said that just before and several times after he said that's when the bridegroom came don't you realize the secret the mystery of the seventh seal is this coming amen right he doesn't come out here just full blown out in front of everybody he comes in secret and that purpose of that he had to pick up his bride he had to manifest himself in bright form he had to be that coming for the rapture for the body change that's the mystery that's what's so hard for people you begin to preach that and they say oh no no oh no wait a minute it's not known to the public brother brother romeo didn't come up to the window to take her publicly he came in the dark of night i've arrived come on i've come to get you come to take you out of here see he's come that's sister jerry and they sang it sunday morning he's come he's coming we're we'd say brother david that wouldn't be good when he comes i say he wasn't that good that he is yeah and that we're looking for a climax of that i'll let you just go in the message and search it out all right all right cannot do it now it's he said he said now it's seed time bride time the shucks are dead the shucks are dried up i've just i'm just about got to finish here the shucks are dead dried up the word it's the virgin word time this is virgin word time virgin word time not touched it's a virgin remember virgin word time if you put it in the hands of a denomination it sure won't be virgin it'll be manhandled time you get to it but god's church is not touched by denominational manhandling hallelujah it's a virgin-born word of god made manifest jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah how wonderful i love it i believe it i know that it's the truth it'll not be touched there'll be no denominational manhandling in the virgin birth of the bride who's the bride the word it's a virgin word time he's the word she's the word if he's the word she must be the word he's life she has to be life if he's resurrection she's got to be resurrection and she is what a resurrection this is glory to god all right all right and at that day when the son of man is revealed in other words the son of man the ministry of jesus christ himself the church will come through justification through luther through sanctification through wesley through the baptism of the holy ghost through the pentecostals and go right on in on right on into the perfection of the son of man into the perfection of it hallelujah perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife that when husband and wife will be the same self person i say brother sister we're saying this day this scripture is being fulfilled praise the lord he said right into the same self-persons god will be so manifested into his bride his body his church till they'll both be the same they are one now he said you see where we're at now do you see where we're at see the ministry of the groom and the ministry of abide is the same ministry think of that all right don't why be the same person different flesh same person he wasn't another person he was adam well who was eve adam was eve in another form eve was adam in another form that's exactly why those seals had to be opened in this hour to bring us to that full revelation the full revelation and perfection of the son of man just read it right here amen when that which is perfect is come amen what is the perfect what is the complete seven is complete amen what have you moved up into you've moved up into an intelligence now you're not down here kicking around in the clouds you've moved up into the head without the scene you'd never know what to believe now the sight has given you view into the mind the very mind the very the very person of jesus christ why that's me oh well brother david he'll wake up one of these days no leave me alone i feel real good this way that's the truth all right don't hold to them traditions and creeds they were all right in their day but the flower has bloomed to a blossom now it's seed time that's right jesus promised these things now when you see when you see god make his promise live before us and see that it's in us when you see god make his promise live before us and see that it's in you and his spirit is living in you that is the only way of worship the only place of worship the only true way you can worship how did jesus say the true worshipers worship in spirit and in truth dynamics and mechanics all right now it's not what is it he said he said jesus promised these things when you see okay i read that what is this not them people you say brother david just reading quotes well then listen carefully i mean brother brother chris and brother paul they don't preach like i do they can't but they know the same father they can preach the same word they can preach the truth of it in the way god made them to preach it amen on these wednesdays like this this is what it does but you just get catch it you catch the revelation of it because these aren't just words these are god's thoughts expressed and he had to express them to someone might as well be you all right it's not them people see brother i'm trying to say it's not the flesh man it's not the flesh people he said the headship and the body has become one unit it's god manifested in his people that's the reason the husband and wife is no longer twain no longer twain amen no longer twain he said god in his church is one christ in you god's great revelation now that's what we're preaching on for the rest of my life is god's great revelation glory to god even bearing his name impregnated bringing forth christ amen that's what you're doing you're bringing forth christ you're bringing about that day and that meeting you're bringing it god's waiting on his bride she lays in the presence of the son in the unveiling of his word she's laying in that presence what's she doing ripening oh well i'm just too busy i can't do it you're too busy then to go on the rapture that's all there is to it satan will see to it you get busy you'll see to it that you've got other idols in front of you instead of the word you'll see to you put anything he can any kind of idol he can between you and that word and you'll bow to it and serve it instead of serving god in his word he said pretty strong you bet it's strong open get strong because that the world today message around the message arena is full of idolatry i said the message arena you bet it is and did not paul and did not peter say little children flee idolatry amen anything you put between you and god anything that comes between you and takes first place and you bow to that thing and you serve that when you could be in prayer you could be feeding on the word but you're not redeeming the time i'll just get a little evangelistic right there let's use me all right now i'm about ready to close i said about i'll just see if i bypass the headship he said is here amen christ the risen lord is here and with the same power of his resurrection that he ever was manifesting himself he said there's the devil's answer not me that liveth is christ that liveth in me there's the devil's answer he's manifesting himself he just told us where and who he was manifesting himself in and where he'd be seen and where he's unveiled today and here we are a little group but here we are rejoicing in the light of this message and when the word moves down into the body from the head what is it the same word nothing can be added or taken from it and that's exactly what denomination does they add to and take from that's the same thing i don't care if it's a hierarchy of the message in jeffersonville if they're going to add to and take away that's exactly what's happening well we don't need the fivefold ministry we'll just kind of water that down they've added to or taken away that'll cost you billy david so it cost me god will keep me. i know they don't like it but that's the truth they've lifted up they've lifted up things idols i'm not getting started there i'll just go right on it'll be here till midnight all right as the word moves down from the head as the day comes close down the body down to the body vindicating that we are one they are husband and wife they are flesh of his flesh word of his word see life of his life spirit of his spirit you are his victory today the church ought to be listen to what brother braham said the church ought to be ought to be jesus christ in action upon the earth today he said the church ought to be jesus christ in action upon the earth he said because i live you live also my life will be in you this bride is the living word in action she's the promised royal seed today made manifest oh he's got a perfect body he's the perfect word the church will be sowed and believed in the perfect word and perfect word and perfect word will unite together as one flesh one body as a husband and wife is amen can't you see the very time that the unwise virgin wants to make get some oil he said they said we i've already been on that let's just well i'll read this what are they trying to do get oil in their lamp exactly that's an end time seed sign amen while we while she was trying to do that the bridegroom come and the bride went in what is she going into union and it's not in open doors it's behind closed doors in fact it's in the little room that's the third pull who does she meet her husband glory to god i could go into a song there but i'd stop a minute come back you get kind of funny with this i mean it's like it's like am i really here all right i'm closing honestly i am and while they were trying to get the oil the bridegroom come and the bride went in and she was locked out oh what a wonderful day we're living in you see that's a wonderful day brother braham oh yes a wonderful day we're living in jesus seventh seal revelation we're inside of christ as then all true believers see him all true believe we're inside of christ i'm closing honestly listen carefully don't don't slip out with me and as then all true believers see him the word of promise of this day openly manifested that's a big word if you can get it see all true believers that's in the word see god openly sounds like the third pull to me doesn't it like the seven seals open the veil is rent and god stands openly before you openly before you full full view full view not partial view not dark view not a halfway view full view before you manifested brother sister there's what the bride sees what's he see she sees she sees him in her manifested she says that's who i am that's my identification i'm already identified in the rapture that identifies me in order to do this the old denominational traditional veil must be rent again so he takes his sword and rips that veil from top to bottom why top to bottom sure god did it all right you've got to come out of that stuff you'll never do it they'll keep pulling the veil before you every time oh there is nothing to that but it is written and here it is made manifest you see if you don't come out of it he said they're going to pull that veil down before you every time and there's they'll say nothing to it and then what are you doing you're listening to garbage amen all right always his word is his sword and we and he took his sword that day full of fire and ripped that veil from top to bottom he said he said but the sword of the lord see rips the veil down and you see and then you see god standing in plain view manifested in his word what a glorious view to look at all right now we could go you you take it you go back to first corinthians 13 10 through 12 the perfect has come amen if we don't believe the perfect has come then we don't believe the seals are open we do not believe seven seals are open because the seventh seal is the perfect it makes the whole thing cap what's the seventh seal the capstone where was the capstone in the pyramid unwritten word i've got to go west to get the revelation of it of that unwritten word where was the unwritten word what john couldn't write amen amen amen let's stand amen christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing there you are there you are see he said what god is trying to do see what he's trying to do what is the new birth then you say brother branham what is the new birth it is the revelation unveiling of jesus christ personally to you now there's who you are she is the resurrection and the life laying we're
