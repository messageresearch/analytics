[43:27] amen you serve a god like that
[43:30] hallelujah well you know saints there's
[43:32] always just
[43:33] something happening in life my heart is
[43:36] breaking for our brother
[43:37] kenny his family for their son being in
[43:40] this accident
[43:41] but we have to remember saints that uh
[43:44] it's not over till it's over
[43:45] amen and uh prayer changes thing do we
[43:48] believe that
[43:49] amen the most powerful thing that we
[43:52] have
[43:52] is prayer amen and when you think about
[43:56] that
[43:56] you think what the power of prayer does
[43:58] it not only
[43:59] changes the situation but it changes
[44:03] you while you're praying for the
[44:06] situation
[44:07] amen you cannot have a hard stony heart
[44:11] and sincerely pray you must soften
[44:13] yourself you must surrender yourself you
[44:15] must give yourself over to the will of
[44:17] god
[44:18] believing now saints we wouldn't pray at
[44:21] all would we unless we
[44:22] believe god would answer that prayer
[44:24] right that's
[44:25] that's the very fundamental basis of
[44:27] what we have prayer
[44:28] is we believe god will answer that
[44:32] prayer
[44:32] the word of god says that the fervent
[44:36] effectual prayer right not the
[44:38] half-hearted
[44:39] doesn't say the half-hearted prayer
[44:43] of any old person the fervent effectual
[44:46] prayer of a righteous man
[44:48] you want your prayers answered don't go
[44:50] blaming everybody else
[44:51] just stand on the word say lord change
[44:53] me i want my prayers to reach right to
[44:55] the throne of god
[44:57] i want him to come with authority we're
[44:59] not beggars
[45:00] we're sons and daughters of almighty god
[45:03] now having said all of that
[45:05] saints i received a phone call on friday
[45:08] afternoon i believe it was about 5 45 or
[45:11] so
[45:12] and there was a voice on the other end
[45:15] that was rejoining
[45:16] rejoicing tremendously
[45:20] remember we've been praying for ryan and
[45:21] brie and their unborn baby
[45:24] of which the doctors had declared
[45:26] emphatically that they were certain that
[45:28] this child would be
[45:29] a down syndrome child and they had been
[45:32] preparing
[45:33] to you know go go speak to as it were
[45:36] the clinical psychologist
[45:38] and nothing wrong with them they're
[45:39] doing the best that they can do but
[45:42] to be prepared because when many people
[45:46] have a child that there's an issue it's
[45:48] it's such a
[45:49] a shock to them the reality of it
[45:52] they try to prepare them for
[45:56] you know what is coming and doctors are
[45:59] doctors
[46:00] they're men but we serve god
[46:03] amen we serve an awesome god just as the
[46:05] songs here today have declared
[46:07] we serve a mighty god amen not just a
[46:11] mighty god but an almighty god amen that
[46:14] we can stand on the word of god with
[46:16] complete confidence
[46:17] and if it goes to the right or goes to
[46:19] the left it doesn't matter we still
[46:20] serve god right we don't run from our
[46:22] problems we just go face to face and say
[46:24] lord
[46:25] you know best amen because if we come to
[46:28] the place we doubt
[46:30] god we have nothing to stand on i mean
[46:33] absolutely nothing
[46:34] amen you know uh
[46:38] it it's i don't know how to present this
[46:40] but i got this phone call
[46:42] and uh brie
[46:45] um she she said paul i
[46:49] i just had to call you and i said that's
[46:51] wonderful to hear from you
[46:53] she said i hope you don't mind i got
[46:54] your number from a neighbor landlord
[46:59] and i hope it's a good time and i said
[47:01] it's a perfect time
[47:03] she said well i just have to share this
[47:06] with you and i can hear her crying on
[47:08] the other end
[47:10] and you're thinking oh my
[47:14] my little baby girl was born
[47:22] perfect
[47:25] [Applause]
[47:32] so we had quite a conversation this
[47:35] little deal that brother alex will put
[47:36] up in just a minute
[47:38] is just the slight little blurb she sent
[47:41] as a text because she said please share
[47:43] this with your church
[47:45] please please share this and i say thank
[47:47] you from my heart
[47:48] for your prayers that you would care so
[47:52] much about us and our child
[47:55] and we had a lovely time and you know
[47:58] the prophet of god
[47:59] said that if you have the meat and you
[48:01] have the salt but they don't come
[48:03] together
[48:04] the salt can never never preserve the
[48:07] meat
[48:08] amen
[48:11] it's our job saints it's who we are
[48:14] to be the salt of the earth it's who we
[48:17] are to step
[48:18] beyond our comfort zone to remind
[48:21] someone
[48:22] that is filled with fear i don't believe
[48:25] the doctors intended to put
[48:27] fear there but they were convinced the
[48:29] doctors are convinced because they have
[48:31] medical science
[48:32] they have tests they have research they
[48:34] have all of these things
[48:35] in their mind they fully expected to see
[48:38] a down syndrome child
[48:40] birth but god has other plans
[48:44] amen and we stand on the word of god
[48:46] he's the final voice
[48:48] amen we're not going to listen to this
[48:50] over here and listen to that over there
[48:52] we're going to listen to his voice
[48:53] because his voice
[48:54] is the final voice you know what they
[48:56] say the rest of it is just noise
[49:00] hallelujah cut through the noise get
[49:02] back so you hear god
[49:04] amen there's a lot of things i could
[49:06] share about this but
[49:08] i just uh asked brother alex to just
[49:10] pump this on the screen
[49:12] amen now there's quite a story here and
[49:15] i got to hear all of it and i was happy
[49:17] to hear all of it
[49:18] uh brie herself was born in hawaii
[49:21] and uh her father was in the military
[49:24] and so
[49:25] i can butcher names just as well as
[49:27] anyone
[49:28] but uh something on the order of
[49:32] kelana joy
[49:35] and uh seven pounds nine ounces 21
[49:38] inches
[49:40] and she said this is my simplest words i
[49:43] can put it
[49:44] she's god's special miracle
[49:48] see her and her husband didn't go oh the
[49:50] doctors made a mistake
[49:53] she said there was something lifted from
[49:55] her
[49:57] there was something she said of peace
[50:00] settled in all is well
[50:05] and we can say we've heard the message
[50:07] shalom all as well
[50:10] let us share that my brother and sister
[50:12] no matter where you are
[50:14] what is happening you say well people
[50:16] kind of rebuff it well i can take you to
[50:18] quotes i just actually was reading right
[50:20] the start of the service
[50:21] the prophet of god says you know what
[50:23] you just asked for god's leadership and
[50:25] when you have given enough
[50:27] listen to the nudge and stop
[50:31] that's it but if we never
[50:34] share amen oh my
[50:38] amen let's just stand and praise the
[50:40] lord amen
[50:43] saints i fully believe from my heart we
[50:46] have been
[50:46] a part of a miracle
[50:49] oh heavenly father lord we lift our
[50:52] hands in praise

[1:01:14] share a little bit of
[1:01:22] let's go to book of numbers 13
[1:01:26] 27.
[1:01:36] i was going to ask jason to read the
[1:01:38] scripture for me but
[1:01:40] i'm trusting that everybody got their
[1:01:42] bibles
[1:01:43] your bible so you can read it because
[1:01:46] don't expect to sound
[1:01:47] beautiful for my mouth so
[1:01:52] thank you very jason
[1:01:55] uh and this chapter here it talks about
[1:01:58] the
[1:01:59] the spies moses sent the spies to the
[1:02:03] canaan land and um
[1:02:06] they some of them they came back
[1:02:10] afraid yeah and some of them came back
[1:02:14] excited yes because what they saw
[1:02:18] so let's read in the just for the sake
[1:02:21] of time
[1:02:22] uh i'm gonna go i'm gonna jump to verse
[1:02:24] 30.
[1:02:26] then caleb quieted the people
[1:02:30] before moses and said let us go up
[1:02:33] and take once and take position
[1:02:36] for we are well able to
[1:02:40] overcome it he was
[1:02:43] an excited guy yes that's right
[1:02:46] now if we go to chapter 14
[1:02:50] verse 4.
[1:02:56] so you know they were whining already
[1:02:58] complaining and then
[1:03:00] oh but this is there's giants and
[1:03:05] i mean don't you see sometimes that kind
[1:03:07] of spirit
[1:03:10] so verse 4 says so they say to another
[1:03:13] one
[1:03:14] let us select a leader and return to
[1:03:16] egypt
[1:03:17] they were ready to go back
[1:03:21] i've seen that many times we stumble on
[1:03:24] something
[1:03:25] and you know we just throw the towel
[1:03:27] like
[1:03:28] let's go back but
[1:03:31] verse 6 but joshua the son of nun
[1:03:35] and caleb the son of
[1:03:38] whatever he says who were among those
[1:03:42] who had spied despite out the
[1:03:46] the land tore the clothes
[1:03:49] i mean we all know what that means
[1:03:54] they were in a in a situation that
[1:04:00] i said come on people
[1:04:04] you've seen the hand of god all the way
[1:04:07] and you're still trying to go back and
[1:04:09] you still don't believe what
[1:04:10] he's capable of right that's why they
[1:04:13] turned
[1:04:13] their clothes because they were
[1:04:15] desperate
[1:04:17] how these people don't understand or
[1:04:19] don't believe
[1:04:21] still don't trust in god
[1:04:25] and they spoke to all congregation of
[1:04:28] the children of israel saying
[1:04:29] the land we pass through to spy
[1:04:32] to spy out is an ex is exceedingly good
[1:04:35] land
[1:04:36] if the lord delights in us then he will
[1:04:40] bring us into this land and give it
[1:04:43] to us and a land which flows
[1:04:46] with milk and honey let us pray
[1:04:49] heavenly father we read your word lord
[1:04:52] and there is
[1:04:53] so many things that we can learn father
[1:04:55] so many things we can speak of
[1:04:57] father but we want you to come and speak
[1:04:59] to our heart this morning and
[1:05:01] and push me away lord so you can come
[1:05:02] and speak to these people
[1:05:05] father we ask you these things and and
[1:05:07] commit the service into your hands lord
[1:05:09] for your honor and glory in the name of
[1:05:12] jesus
[1:05:13] christ amen well
[1:05:16] you may be seated i just before i get
[1:05:19] started i
[1:05:21] i just want to say thank you to brother
[1:05:22] paul for
[1:05:25] having me here and and his confidence to
[1:05:29] share his pulpit with me and uh gracias
[1:05:33] hermana por el canto espanol
[1:05:37] i think next time i'm going to speak in
[1:05:39] spanish so she can translate english
[1:05:45] and then i am on my way
[1:05:51] with my family to colorado which
[1:05:54] i believe some of my family they're
[1:05:56] watching right now
[1:05:57] and uh but i just cannot do
[1:06:01] drive-through and not stopping by here
[1:06:06] although some people can't do that i
[1:06:09] don't wanna
[1:06:10] i don't wanna say who but i don't wanna
[1:06:11] name names
[1:06:13] i love you brother paul
[1:06:16] but uh you know is is for me this is
[1:06:19] like my
[1:06:20] second home is
[1:06:23] since uh i met brother paul in oregon i
[1:06:26] think i've said this before
[1:06:28] but uh uh is it's uh
[1:06:32] always a pleasure to say it again that i
[1:06:35] i i knew that i found a friend
[1:06:39] and having me here
[1:06:43] in his pulpit means a lot to me
[1:06:47] i'm the least person worthy to be here
[1:06:52] but thank god i
[1:06:56] found grace and uh
[1:07:00] and grace tabernacle and i don't know if
[1:07:03] it's true but he said people love me
[1:07:05] here
[1:07:06] but you know what if it's not true i
[1:07:09] want to say i love you
[1:07:10] anyway i told him brother paul you're a
[1:07:13] pastor you can lie
[1:07:17] i really enjoy every time i come here
[1:07:20] sometimes i get so sensitive
[1:07:24] you probably know me already but uh
[1:07:28] it's a lot of things that i'm grateful
[1:07:31] to the lord
[1:07:32] like my beautiful wife that she's always
[1:07:35] with me
[1:07:36] and that's uh my uh
[1:07:41] companion to everywhere we go
[1:07:44] and and even though she
[1:07:47] she's weary with kids
[1:07:50] and uh and husband sometimes
[1:07:54] she's always willing to
[1:08:01] you know my my title this morning i i
[1:08:05] tell it
[1:08:06] god cares for you
[1:08:11] i don't know i haven't even started
[1:08:12] speaking and i'm already crying so sorry
[1:08:15] but you know what is it's because god
[1:08:18] really cares for you
[1:08:21] and he's being caring for me
[1:08:24] since since the day i made my decision
[1:08:26] to follow him
[1:08:29] he's been reading my steps
[1:08:32] and some i had to admit one time
[1:08:38] i was ready to throw the towel and i
[1:08:40] think i shared this testimony with you
[1:08:42] before
[1:08:45] after being trying to live in a
[1:08:48] christian life
[1:08:50] and i didn't see the hand of god moving
[1:08:53] within me and
[1:08:56] single and uh
[1:09:02] and uh one day i said lord i've been
[1:09:03] trying to do my best
[1:09:06] and i identify myself here too with
[1:09:08] these people they were trying to find
[1:09:10] someone to
[1:09:10] take him back to egypt and there was me
[1:09:14] too
[1:09:17] maybe i'm the only one
[1:09:21] but you know
[1:09:24] this is what breaks my heart is because
[1:09:27] who am i
[1:09:29] so i can have mercy of me more than
[1:09:31] anyone else
[1:09:32] because i grew up with many more
[1:09:36] people young people than my
[1:09:39] my time my time i'm sorry
[1:09:42] but uh you know when i was ready to
[1:09:47] throw everything away
[1:09:50] this is the most i think that the most
[1:09:54] important
[1:09:54] thing in my spiritual life because if it
[1:09:57] wasn't god then who
[1:09:59] was want someone to tell me who
[1:10:03] it was
[1:10:06] i was i was going to
[1:10:10] it was a monday tuesday somewhere in
[1:10:11] there and on friday i was planning to go
[1:10:14] out to
[1:10:15] to the bar for the first time i never
[1:10:17] taste wine or liquor
[1:10:19] by the glory of god
[1:10:22] but i was gonna do it for the first time
[1:10:25] and by wednesday night thursday night
[1:10:27] somewhere in there i got a phone call

[1:11:14] it was a voicemail because i didn't
[1:11:16] answer
[1:11:18] i'm calling jesus to say i love you god
[1:11:19] loves you and i know what you've been
[1:11:22] through
[1:11:25] i was struggling
[1:11:28] then if it wasn't god who told him
[1:11:32] what i was going through who told him
[1:11:35] that what i was going
[1:11:38] what's going to do now friday
[1:11:43] if you see tears right now this is
[1:11:45] nothing compared to tonight
[1:11:49] because god cares for you
[1:11:52] he's been caring for me amen
[1:11:56] then i was about to make a mistake
[1:11:59] marrying someone that
[1:12:01] wasn't a believer or dating
[1:12:06] and then god talked to me again and said
[1:12:11] you don't want to go that route
[1:12:15] you know what
[1:12:19] god rewards when you're faithful to him
[1:12:24] because what he gave me for a wife
[1:12:30] i couldn't find another one that's right
[1:12:33] she's the best
[1:12:34] that she that he had for me and he had
[1:12:37] her
[1:12:38] reserved for me
[1:12:41] and another time i might share my
[1:12:43] testimony about that but
[1:12:45] just i want to tell you this
[1:12:48] we've been 13 years married
[1:12:53] and i haven't regretted it
[1:12:57] because when i ask god for a wife i say
[1:12:59] lord i want to marry someone
[1:13:00] you give me a wife that she's willing to
[1:13:03] go wherever you want me to go
[1:13:05] and she doesn't complain there she is
[1:13:11] she never complains
[1:13:14] god cares for you or not
[1:13:19] i guess we have to move on
[1:13:22] so
[1:13:26] and this scripture here says it was a
[1:13:29] land where flow
[1:13:30] that was flowing with milk and honey
[1:13:33] and as uh
[1:13:37] milk uh
[1:13:40] these days uh typifies the holy ghost
[1:13:44] i mean and the book of joel says that in
[1:13:47] the last days
[1:13:48] god was going to pour off his spirit
[1:13:51] right
[1:13:53] to every soul or flesh
[1:14:00] but you can see a lot of uh
[1:14:05] people uh praying for someone and that
[1:14:08] person
[1:14:09] got healed because this is the holy
[1:14:11] ghost
[1:14:12] right but
[1:14:16] but also the bible here mentioned honey
[1:14:20] and this honey is very important
[1:14:24] we have the holy ghost praise the lord
[1:14:28] but we want to have honey too you know
[1:14:31] why
[1:14:33] because that's what keeps
[1:14:36] everything together i heard a story that
[1:14:39] said that there was a
[1:14:41] lady that had a dream there was a man
[1:14:44] pouring water into a basket
[1:14:49] and and and as
[1:14:52] soon as he poured water into the basket
[1:14:54] the water was flowing
[1:14:56] it never stayed there and
[1:15:01] then this lady came to a man and said
[1:15:02] what are you doing i said i'm pouring
[1:15:04] water here
[1:15:05] and i said but it's not holding it
[1:15:09] and then and and then the the man says
[1:15:11] you know why
[1:15:13] and she said why it's because
[1:15:16] and it's honey so the honey
[1:15:21] when i put honey on that will
[1:15:24] keep the rocks together and then it's
[1:15:27] going to contain
[1:15:27] water so the honey is the brotherly love
[1:15:33] so i will i will say the holy ghost and
[1:15:37] brother in love are cousins
[1:15:39] because they have to go together you
[1:15:42] have the holy ghost praise the lord
[1:15:44] but let's try
[1:15:47] to have the the brotherly love too
[1:15:51] because a people a person with the holy
[1:15:53] ghost
[1:15:57] can preach really good get on fire
[1:16:02] but can be really indifferent out there
[1:16:04] with people
[1:16:06] and you know what that situation is
[1:16:08] going to puff them up
[1:16:10] and he will think that he's a grey man
[1:16:14] and then this reminds me another might
[1:16:17] sound like
[1:16:18] his story but there was a donkey jumping
[1:16:22] going back home and told the mama hey
[1:16:25] mama everybody was
[1:16:26] clapping their hands and putting pounds
[1:16:29] on the on the road
[1:16:30] everybody was happy to see me
[1:16:33] and he was all jumping up and then the
[1:16:36] mom says
[1:16:37] okay son who was
[1:16:40] on your back oh there was an a guy named
[1:16:44] jesus
[1:16:45] okay i want you to go back the same road
[1:16:48] and see if they do the same to you
[1:16:55] i mean it wasn't the donkey
[1:16:59] it was the lord jesus
[1:17:05] so we have here the holy ghost
[1:17:08] and the brotherly love and
[1:17:14] ayah
[1:17:18] i can see here joshua
[1:17:22] uh getting facing
[1:17:27] a hard time because
[1:17:31] he and caleb got so
[1:17:34] courageous and brave enough to say oh we
[1:17:37] can take that land
[1:17:38] easy easy peasy we can take it
[1:17:42] giant who cares
[1:17:46] and it it's really easy for us sometimes
[1:17:48] to get excited
[1:17:49] and if you don't believe ask peter
[1:17:53] when you get there because under
[1:17:57] excitement we can say a lot of things
[1:18:01] but when it comes to the test
[1:18:05] i want to see you having the same
[1:18:06] attitude
[1:18:08] okay now if we got joshua number uh
[1:18:12] chapter one verse six there
[1:18:15] uh
[1:18:18] i i wanna ask you this
[1:18:22] why do you think god told him
[1:18:25] what he told him
[1:18:32] let's see
[1:18:38] let's start with verse 5
[1:18:42] it says no man shall be able to stand
[1:18:44] before you
[1:18:45] all the days of your life as i was with
[1:18:48] moses
[1:18:49] so i will be with you i will not leave
[1:18:52] not leave you not forsake you be strong
[1:18:55] and of courage for to these people you
[1:18:58] shall
[1:18:59] divide as an
[1:19:02] inheritance the language sword to the
[1:19:05] others to give give them
[1:19:09] now i i i think joshua
[1:19:12] was a human being and he was a little
[1:19:15] bit afraid
[1:19:17] caleb you had to open your big mouth
[1:19:19] over there
[1:19:20] back then and now here we are moses is
[1:19:24] gone
[1:19:25] what we're gonna do you say we can take
[1:19:28] it
[1:19:30] come on don't leave me alone here
[1:19:34] i mean joshua was a human being as you
[1:19:37] and i
[1:19:39] so then god come comes
[1:19:43] and comfort him say don't worry
[1:19:47] the way i was with moses i will be with
[1:19:50] you
[1:19:51] and if this if the if if the bible
[1:19:54] is not just history that's
[1:19:57] still alive to these days so the way he
[1:20:00] was
[1:20:01] with brother brown he's with us
[1:20:06] brother paul share a testimony awesome
[1:20:09] testimony
[1:20:12] if god is not alive these days then
[1:20:15] who can do that kind of things to fix
[1:20:19] things even
[1:20:20] before someone can put a hands on
[1:20:24] and i say things but to fix a baby right
[1:20:29] and that's that's what i always tell
[1:20:31] people
[1:20:32] it's good to rely on doctors
[1:20:36] but it is better to rely
[1:20:40] on lord jesus christ
[1:20:44] because a doctor a doctor can do or can
[1:20:47] guess the same way you can guess
[1:20:49] and i'm saying this because i had
[1:20:51] experience with it i had a pain in my
[1:20:53] my my stomach one time
[1:20:56] and this is not long ago my wife i tried
[1:20:59] not to tell my
[1:21:01] bad feelings my wife because she's got a
[1:21:04] doctor
[1:21:05] but uh so we went to the doctor and he
[1:21:08] goes like
[1:21:09] it hurts of course it hurts that's why
[1:21:12] i'm here right
[1:21:14] and he said well i'm gonna give you pain
[1:21:16] pills and if you don't
[1:21:18] get better then come back i say
[1:21:22] that's it he said yeah
[1:21:25] okay he gave me the pills i went home
[1:21:28] put it on the trash
[1:21:30] and i told my wife i'm not going to take
[1:21:32] any and i said lord
[1:21:34] you designed this body that's right you
[1:21:37] can fix it
[1:21:39] because if i'm going to go there to be a
[1:21:41] guinea pig someone's guinea pig
[1:21:44] i want to do those experiments on my own
[1:21:48] and homemade remedy sometimes works
[1:21:50] better
[1:21:51] again i'm not against science or doctors
[1:21:54] i believe in those
[1:21:55] but what i want you to go home
[1:21:59] today is you have to trust
[1:22:02] in the lord more than anything
[1:22:06] so we have moses uh joshua
[1:22:12] they don't worry because him
[1:22:15] and caleb opened their mouth and now
[1:22:18] there
[1:22:18] moses was gone maybe joshua was kind of
[1:22:21] excited because
[1:22:22] he had moses there oh god talks to moses
[1:22:25] and everything is going to be okay
[1:22:27] but guess what god took moses
[1:22:31] now is your turn to act upon
[1:22:34] the word of the lord and uh
[1:22:38] we uh he was preparing all the
[1:22:42] israelites
[1:22:43] into canaan and place
[1:22:46] all their their enemies
[1:22:50] to scare them out or
[1:22:54] kill them or whatever they had to do but
[1:22:56] they was called to take position of that
[1:22:58] land
[1:23:00] so i want to read
[1:23:04] something that it really
[1:23:07] helped me and and encouraged me
[1:23:11] uh because
[1:23:16] when god sent someone
[1:23:20] he's not sending someone on their own
[1:23:22] abilities
[1:23:23] or sending someone to guess what is
[1:23:25] going to happen
[1:23:27] when god sends someone is because he's
[1:23:30] already have commission that's right and
[1:23:34] god is going to be with him as long as
[1:23:37] we are obeying
[1:23:40] his commandments he is obligated to be
[1:23:44] with you amen but if you step out of the
[1:23:48] those lines
[1:23:52] then you're on your own and don't
[1:23:57] point fingers because when you do this
[1:24:01] three fingers are to you you're one that
[1:24:04] way and three for you
[1:24:06] so
[1:24:13] let's go to
[1:24:16] book of judge
[1:24:24] like i say keep reading your bible
[1:24:26] because there were some words that
[1:24:28] they're not going to come out good so
[1:24:32] the book of judges chapter 3 verse 1
[1:24:35] says
[1:24:39] now you have it
[1:24:43] says now you ha these are the nations
[1:24:46] which
[1:24:46] the lord left that he might test
[1:24:50] do you hear that test
[1:24:53] so when you was invited to to be a
[1:24:57] christian
[1:24:58] probably they didn't say that you were
[1:25:00] going to be test
[1:25:02] right but look at this
[1:25:05] the lord left that my test israel by
[1:25:07] them
[1:25:08] that it is all who had not known any of
[1:25:12] wars in canaan this was only
[1:25:16] so that the generations of the children
[1:25:18] of israel might be
[1:25:19] thought to know war at least those who
[1:25:23] had not
[1:25:23] formally known it namely five lords
[1:25:27] of philistines all the canaanites
[1:25:32] cydonized and the heavy ties
[1:25:35] who dwell in mount lebanon
[1:25:39] from alba hermann to the entrance of
[1:25:43] muhammad
[1:25:44] and they were left that he might test
[1:25:46] israel
[1:25:47] israel by them to know
[1:25:51] whether they will obey the commandments
[1:25:52] of the lord which
[1:25:54] he had commanded there their fathers by
[1:25:57] the hand of moses
[1:25:59] those are the children of israel dwell
[1:26:01] among the canaanites
[1:26:02] hittites amorites fertilized the
[1:26:06] hepatitis
[1:26:07] and the hebrew sites and they took
[1:26:10] their daughters to be their wives and
[1:26:12] gave their daughters to their sons
[1:26:14] and they served their gods
[1:26:18] okay
[1:26:21] canaanites uh
[1:26:25] i did some digging a little bit and the
[1:26:28] canaanites
[1:26:28] the name canaanites means merchants
[1:26:32] or the ones who humiliate humility
[1:26:37] the hittites his name means terror
[1:26:42] so i mean this
[1:26:46] this this people here were left by
[1:26:49] god to test who
[1:26:52] his children
[1:26:56] we're not exempt of this test
[1:27:00] we are here to learn war
[1:27:04] and now it's not a war with with with
[1:27:07] the
[1:27:09] handguns but it's a spiritual war
[1:27:13] how are you gonna get strong
[1:27:16] if you're not test that's right
[1:27:20] i never forget what brother paul said
[1:27:21] one the first time he invited me to
[1:27:23] speak
[1:27:24] well you never know if you can do it if
[1:27:26] you never do it
[1:27:29] so here i am but you know
[1:27:32] you never know how much level of
[1:27:35] spirituality you have
[1:27:36] if you're not test that's right because
[1:27:38] we can get comfy
[1:27:40] it's really easy to get comfortable and
[1:27:44] not doing nothing you're getting trouble
[1:27:47] but you're not doing nothing for the
[1:27:49] lord anymore
[1:27:51] so the hittites his name is terror this
[1:27:54] guitar seems to have recent
[1:27:55] great power as a nation for a long time
[1:27:58] they were
[1:27:59] former former rivals to egyptians
[1:28:03] so they were they were they were they
[1:28:05] were not facing
[1:28:09] little guys there weak armies
[1:28:13] no wonder the other 10 guys were kind of
[1:28:16] shaking now the the amorites
[1:28:21] they were people who were arrogant
[1:28:25] have you seen arrogant people
[1:28:33] the spirits don't die huh so those
[1:28:37] those people there were testing the
[1:28:39] israelites
[1:28:40] but the spirit is still
[1:28:46] i pray god that i'm not one of them amen
[1:28:50] they had high self-esteem oh
[1:28:53] [Music]
[1:28:55] i've seen those
[1:29:00] very size they were people who had
[1:29:04] separate themselves and live and protect
[1:29:07] it
[1:29:08] they had a they had no discipline no
[1:29:11] restrictions
[1:29:12] are we living in a liberal world these
[1:29:14] days yes
[1:29:16] they don't care what the bible says oh
[1:29:19] it's my right this might write that
[1:29:24] so we're still on war
[1:29:28] the heavy tights they claim to offer a
[1:29:31] good lifestyle
[1:29:32] how many heard that i don't want to get
[1:29:36] it too deep but do you know what i'm
[1:29:37] talking about
[1:29:39] this is i mean it's parallel thing here
[1:29:44] we have giants here
[1:29:47] this time too but you know what god is
[1:29:50] here
[1:29:51] to care for you he's caring for you till
[1:29:56] this day i
[1:29:59] uh i always think about
[1:30:03] people that they've been
[1:30:06] christians for so long and then all of a
[1:30:10] sudden quit
[1:30:11] ministers i mean you can see a lot of
[1:30:15] folks come to church and then disappear
[1:30:17] and then come back and
[1:30:18] but you know what when you have a good
[1:30:20] relationship with god when you have
[1:30:23] a really a stronghold with the the holy
[1:30:26] ghost
[1:30:27] i mean there is nothing that is going to
[1:30:28] move you
[1:30:31] they might be someone you can stumble
[1:30:33] with or
[1:30:33] [Music]
[1:30:35] you're going to have ups and downs but
[1:30:38] you know what
[1:30:38] a son of god always
[1:30:42] gets up and keep moving forward
[1:30:47] because that's when he called you
[1:30:51] he didn't call you for a period of time
[1:30:53] only
[1:30:56] till the death do us a part right but
[1:30:59] you know what
[1:31:00] the religious relationship with god even
[1:31:02] when you die
[1:31:04] that's not an end
[1:31:07] is the next step yeah that's right
[1:31:11] no wonder brother branham said
[1:31:14] there is no words i can explain what i
[1:31:16] saw over there
[1:31:19] but you know what when a p when person
[1:31:21] has the revelation
[1:31:23] that's right that what is over there
[1:31:26] uh there's nothing you can compare with
[1:31:29] what you can have here
[1:31:31] i mean i know brother paul is doing a uh
[1:31:36] he's rebuilding a nice home
[1:31:39] but there's nothing you can compare that
[1:31:42] nice home
[1:31:44] with what we can have over there i was
[1:31:47] telling last night that i was working in
[1:31:48] a in a house in tri-cities that
[1:31:51] you can almost see that the whole
[1:31:53] tri-cities
[1:31:55] the house has a nice view indoor pool
[1:31:59] i mean they have everything they
[1:32:02] they have the means why not but you know
[1:32:05] what
[1:32:05] still that's not nothing you can compare
[1:32:09] with
[1:32:10] right guess what the wife got sick
[1:32:14] even though she has this beautiful house
[1:32:16] she still got sick
[1:32:19] she had to go through surgery
[1:32:22] so even though she had they have all
[1:32:25] this money
[1:32:26] of this nice house nice view we still
[1:32:29] have some
[1:32:30] oopsies here but when we cross the line
[1:32:36] yeah never again
[1:32:39] you know sometimes i feel my back aching
[1:32:42] when i got there i'll be straight my
[1:32:44] wife always tell me hey
[1:32:45] you got it straight up i do when she
[1:32:48] tells me but then i'll send
[1:32:53] it's a human nature and this is this
[1:32:55] body that is
[1:32:58] i mean going down but inside of you
[1:33:02] it's an important thing in there that
[1:33:05] you have to take care of
[1:33:07] you have to be able to
[1:33:10] feed the one inside more than the one
[1:33:14] outside
[1:33:15] because the more you feed the one the
[1:33:17] guy outside
[1:33:19] is more in trouble gets you
[1:33:25] i know that for fact you know sometimes
[1:33:29] i ate too many tacos that i can even
[1:33:30] move
[1:33:33] i want to go back to work but my body
[1:33:36] says you know what you have to take a
[1:33:37] nap
[1:33:41] but when you feed the spirit
[1:33:46] you feel lighter and lighter
[1:33:50] keep feeding the the the white dog right
[1:33:57] then the jebusites they were people who
[1:34:00] exploited
[1:34:01] and polluted others through immoral
[1:34:04] activities
[1:34:06] we all know that
[1:34:12] and god is taking care of his people
[1:34:16] from the beginning that sometimes
[1:34:20] we can lose track if we don't follow
[1:34:24] what he is trying to tell us
[1:34:27] because the enemy is knows the
[1:34:29] scriptures better than you and me so he
[1:34:32] can come and twist it a little bit and
[1:34:34] use the oh
[1:34:35] this looks fine that's right
[1:34:38] a brother does this in this church
[1:34:42] he's a church very i mean
[1:34:45] they're succeeding they have a lot of
[1:34:47] people
[1:34:49] any brother that they should be okay
[1:34:54] it's not okay if he's not in the word
[1:34:56] that's right
[1:34:57] i don't care who he is i don't care who
[1:35:00] she is
[1:35:00] that's right that's what brother brandon
[1:35:03] always said
[1:35:04] stick to the word
[1:35:08] and you come here
[1:35:12] to hear from the lord but you know what
[1:35:16] we're still human beings speaking to you
[1:35:19] we're trying to do our best so god can
[1:35:21] speak to you
[1:35:23] you know why we can make mistakes go
[1:35:26] back home and keep reading the bible
[1:35:30] because this is like a fire here
[1:35:33] you put wood sticks here
[1:35:37] they all if you put them together
[1:35:38] they're all gonna catch on fire
[1:35:41] but you pull one of them don't feed him
[1:35:44] more with fire
[1:35:45] what's going to happen
[1:35:51] the fire will go up but that's why
[1:35:57] you have this this will keep you
[1:36:00] lighting
[1:36:02] even though there is a small tiny little
[1:36:04] light but as long as this
[1:36:06] this little light is still alive you're
[1:36:09] still shining
[1:36:12] and you know what people will see that
[1:36:14] little light
[1:36:15] that's right so what do you have there
[1:36:18] why if you're going through all this and
[1:36:20] this and this and you're still smiling
[1:36:26] god is taking care of me
[1:36:30] imagine job when when he was through all
[1:36:32] this
[1:36:34] i think he if he had the chance to hurt
[1:36:36] that conversation between
[1:36:38] god and satan they say timeout
[1:36:41] time out god please hey let's let's talk
[1:36:45] talk it over why are you dealing with
[1:36:47] this guy
[1:36:49] i mean i've been doing all everything
[1:36:51] you asked for
[1:36:53] i've been burning sacrifices i've been
[1:36:55] doing all for my children
[1:36:57] and you you're making deals here
[1:37:02] put yourself in job shoes
[1:37:06] but you know what god was
[1:37:10] so confident in job that he was
[1:37:14] willing to test his fidelity
[1:37:20] and if he has that for me and you
[1:37:24] bring it on because we know
[1:37:28] god cares for you god cares for me
[1:37:32] he's been showing that to me for many
[1:37:35] years now
[1:37:38] but he is always necessary to to be
[1:37:41] tested it's always necessary
[1:37:44] just to see uh
[1:37:47] the god can show the enemy says see
[1:37:51] have you considered my servant so and so
[1:37:54] and so on soon
[1:37:57] i i i wanna i want my name there i don't
[1:38:01] know about you
[1:38:04] but he's he's taking care of us
[1:38:10] i want you to go home
[1:38:13] and believe him even more because this
[1:38:17] is what uh
[1:38:20] shaped me a little bit me when when i
[1:38:23] when i
[1:38:24] read this and i want to share with you
[1:38:28] just to just in case
[1:38:31] you still don't believe me the guy cares
[1:38:33] for you
[1:38:35] okay
[1:38:38] um we know that
[1:38:43] uh jacob or israel had 12 sons right
[1:38:48] and uh you know this is what amazes me
[1:38:51] that
[1:38:53] we read we read the bible and we see
[1:38:55] that god deals with
[1:38:57] with men rather than women
[1:39:01] but you know what he uses woman
[1:39:04] to complete his task
[1:39:07] through a man because
[1:39:12] i'm gonna start with with with uh the
[1:39:14] sons of uh
[1:39:16] jacob i don't know if you wanna if you
[1:39:18] brought paper and pen
[1:39:20] you might wanna write down this
[1:39:24] reuben means behold
[1:39:27] a son is the eldest son of jacob and
[1:39:31] leah
[1:39:32] you can find it in genesis 29 32.
[1:39:39] simeon means god
[1:39:42] hears or obeys genesis 29 33
[1:39:47] and you know what caught my attention is
[1:39:49] that jacob didn't name the sons
[1:39:52] right right amen and
[1:39:55] you're gonna you're gonna find out why
[1:39:57] i'm so
[1:39:59] i mean shake me
[1:40:03] the second job of of jacob and leah
[1:40:05] genesis 29 33
[1:40:07] he was associated with levi and the tr
[1:40:10] and the terrible lack of vengeance
[1:40:12] against hummer and
[1:40:13] schemi schemites
[1:40:18] uh levi is
[1:40:21] uh joined means join amen
[1:40:24] or adhesion this is the third sound of
[1:40:28] glia
[1:40:29] the origin the origin of the name is
[1:40:32] found in leah's words genesis 29 34
[1:40:36] this time will my this time will my
[1:40:39] husband
[1:40:40] be joined that's what she said that's
[1:40:43] why she
[1:40:43] she named him levi judah
[1:40:47] means praise
[1:40:50] the fourth son of jacob and leah the
[1:40:52] name originated in leah's words
[1:40:55] of praising the lord and i count as
[1:40:57] birth now i'll praise
[1:41:00] jehovah and she called his name
[1:41:06] genesis 29 35. now
[1:41:10] the next one was dan which means
[1:41:13] a judge the fifth son of jacob
[1:41:16] his mother was bilja rachel's maid
[1:41:20] genesis 36 guy had judged me
[1:41:24] that's what she said see jacob never
[1:41:28] named his sons
[1:41:30] he was too busy i guess naftali
[1:41:35] died his struggles or fights
[1:41:39] my wrestling the sick son of jacob his
[1:41:42] mother was bilja
[1:41:43] rachel's handmade genesis 38
[1:41:47] verse 8 when jacob went down to egypt
[1:41:49] naftali
[1:41:51] had four sons and so on so
[1:41:55] god fortune or luck jacob's
[1:42:00] seventh son by silpa leah's handmaid
[1:42:05] and the brother of usher genesis 30
[1:42:08] verse 11 13.
[1:42:12] usher means happiness
[1:42:16] this fight is enjoying the sermon
[1:42:19] he says happy jacob's eight-son his
[1:42:22] mother was silpa
[1:42:24] leah's handmade genesis 30 13.
[1:42:27] ishakar genesis 30 18
[1:42:30] god had given me means reward or
[1:42:34] recompense
[1:42:38] sybilon in place
[1:42:42] genesis 30 20.
[1:42:48] joseph add or
[1:42:51] increase
[1:42:55] genesis 30 23 and
[1:42:58] benjamin son of the right hand
[1:43:02] the younger son of jacob but rachel
[1:43:04] genesis 35 18
[1:43:05] his birth took place efrata on the road
[1:43:09] between bethel
[1:43:10] and bethlehem is a short distance
[1:43:14] from that his mother died and given
[1:43:18] birth
[1:43:18] and with her last breath named him she
[1:43:21] is still
[1:43:22] she still named the boy
[1:43:25] last birth benua
[1:43:29] benuani son of my pain
[1:43:34] the name which was changed by his father
[1:43:36] to benjamin
[1:43:38] rod son of the right hand last one
[1:43:43] i say i'm done and i have time to name
[1:43:45] him
[1:43:46] so this
[1:43:49] is important here or interesting here
[1:43:52] because when you put all the meanings
[1:43:55] together
[1:43:57] it goes like this
[1:44:01] behold a son is born unto us
[1:44:06] one who hear us
[1:44:10] and become attached to us
[1:44:13] praise the lord
[1:44:16] he judge our struggle
[1:44:22] he brought us good fortune
[1:44:26] and happiness
[1:44:30] he rewarded us by making us his
[1:44:33] dwelling place
[1:44:37] is he caring for us
[1:44:44] and he added us to his family
[1:44:48] as sons for he is seated
[1:44:52] at the right hand of the father
[1:44:56] amen
[1:45:01] this is not awesome i mean
[1:45:04] this shake me why because he used a
[1:45:08] woman
[1:45:09] and they were fighting all the time
[1:45:14] i don't know if they were the only ones
[1:45:15] but
[1:45:17] but i kind of know that when there is a
[1:45:19] lot of women together there is always
[1:45:21] trouble
[1:45:22] and he had not i'm not talking about
[1:45:25] these women's here
[1:45:26] obviously these daughters of god
[1:45:30] but you know what
[1:45:34] i work in aspen and uh they call it
[1:45:37] husband
[1:45:38] which takes the clean linen and pickups
[1:45:40] the dirty linen
[1:45:41] from bedrooms and i have to deal with
[1:45:45] 13 women at a time
[1:45:48] and everyone i want these i want that i
[1:45:50] want
[1:45:51] every everyone want their
[1:45:55] supplies so they can finish their job
[1:45:58] but there was none
[1:45:59] we were short
[1:46:02] and they start fighting each other you
[1:46:03] got this much and you got
[1:46:06] so i imagine that this was a situation
[1:46:09] with
[1:46:10] jacob's wives and
[1:46:13] even though god used them to put the
[1:46:16] names
[1:46:17] on their sons so he
[1:46:20] can show us these days
[1:46:25] how much he cares for us
[1:46:28] i mean if it's not god the same god
[1:46:33] brother paul like i said he shared a
[1:46:34] testimony awesome testimony
[1:46:38] and i heard another testimony from a
[1:46:40] brother in
[1:46:41] south africa south america
[1:46:44] he was as he was a kid
[1:46:48] his mom was going to church
[1:46:52] and uh like any young
[1:46:55] guys or girls they just don't want
[1:46:59] anything to do with god is the life is
[1:47:02] boring in
[1:47:03] church or church or church but
[1:47:06] he decided to make his way out so he
[1:47:09] went and and
[1:47:11] i think was in the amazonas or somewhere
[1:47:13] in there
[1:47:15] because he went to the three-day on a
[1:47:18] boat
[1:47:19] going up river
[1:47:23] and they were they were going to fish
[1:47:26] and when they got there there's they
[1:47:29] didn't even start fishing when he got
[1:47:31] his his foot got cut really bad card
[1:47:35] that he was bleeding badly
[1:47:39] and really soon he started losing
[1:47:41] conscience
[1:47:43] so the other
[1:47:46] competitors there say let's go back so
[1:47:50] they took him
[1:47:50] down and up i think after the first day
[1:47:56] they saw a little stream joining to the
[1:47:58] river
[1:48:00] and on the skirt of that
[1:48:04] there was a little tiny house
[1:48:07] and someone with a handkerchief or
[1:48:09] something like hey hey hey
[1:48:11] come and come here come here and they
[1:48:15] approached to him and and they he said
[1:48:18] hey do you have something to eat i
[1:48:19] haven't eat
[1:48:21] the guy who was living there so they
[1:48:24] shared a little bit what they had and
[1:48:26] and and he said
[1:48:28] oh and you guys have someone injured who
[1:48:31] is it
[1:48:33] he didn't know anything who is it
[1:48:36] and the guy was there in the hammock
[1:48:39] falling almost asleep
[1:48:41] so he went and kind of slapped him to
[1:48:43] wake him up say don't don't fall asleep
[1:48:45] because
[1:48:46] and his foot was horrible
[1:48:50] and and he said you're gonna you're
[1:48:51] gonna have to stay here for three days
[1:48:54] if not he's gonna die and the guy
[1:48:59] took him back to his little house there
[1:49:02] and put some
[1:49:04] herbs and ointments that he i don't know
[1:49:07] what it was
[1:49:08] he did he doesn't know either
[1:49:11] and he left he didn't summon after that
[1:49:14] day he didn't side
[1:49:15] saw him he left the next day he come
[1:49:18] back
[1:49:18] do the same thing put some more remedy
[1:49:22] there and
[1:49:23] he disappeared so the guys there just
[1:49:27] by their own just wondering why who is
[1:49:29] this guy why he disappears
[1:49:32] third day came he did the same thing
[1:49:37] and by the third day say tomorrow you're
[1:49:39] going to be able to leave
[1:49:42] and when he came back
[1:49:45] open his wood it was fine so they were
[1:49:48] able to go home
[1:49:50] so they went they they went home
[1:49:55] time went by and
[1:49:59] the mama said son i want you to come to
[1:50:02] church tonight
[1:50:05] say mom i'm too busy i'm making excuses
[1:50:09] son please this is the last time i'm
[1:50:12] gonna ask you
[1:50:14] mama are you sure if you if you promise
[1:50:16] me
[1:50:17] you will never bug me again with this
[1:50:19] i'll go
[1:50:20] oh i'll promise you son okay
[1:50:24] here we go so he went there
[1:50:28] and when he got to the church
[1:50:32] the pastor start talking to him
[1:50:36] not knowing anything either
[1:50:39] and and he said okay
[1:50:43] um he he said himself say okay
[1:50:47] if god speaks to me himself
[1:50:50] i will believe him so
[1:50:54] this pastor told him say you had this
[1:50:57] accident
[1:50:57] this happened and this other happened
[1:51:01] and and god called you
[1:51:04] and he's calling you
[1:51:07] now the testimony is long i'm just going
[1:51:11] between lines here
[1:51:13] so this guy the pastor says
[1:51:16] god help you back there oh no there was
[1:51:19] a man over there
[1:51:20] there is no one there oh yeah it was
[1:51:24] i saw him my body saw him
[1:51:27] so when he got out of church next day
[1:51:29] first thing he did
[1:51:31] he went all the way back to find the guy
[1:51:34] guess what no one was there
[1:51:37] not even the stream come into the river
[1:51:46] someone explained me that
[1:51:50] brothers and sisters i mean
[1:51:53] i i
[1:51:56] we can have a lot of
[1:52:00] chit chat right
[1:52:04] but when it comes to the work of the
[1:52:06] lord
[1:52:07] if you get this much keep it that's
[1:52:10] right
[1:52:11] if you can get this much keep it don't
[1:52:14] doubt it
[1:52:16] because god is the same yesterday today
[1:52:18] and forever
[1:52:20] i mean this guy is serving the lord now
[1:52:27] but all of us we don't need to go that
[1:52:31] route
[1:52:31] we don't need to cut our feet too
[1:52:35] to be able to hear the voice of god
[1:52:38] we have to obey because that's the only
[1:52:42] thing he requested to the children of
[1:52:43] israel
[1:52:44] if you obey my commands stay with them
[1:52:48] i'll be with you you don't have to worry
[1:52:51] you don't have to fight you
[1:52:53] i'm gonna fight for you amen that's
[1:52:56] right
[1:52:57] and they saw it many times they saw it
[1:53:00] exp they lived that experience
[1:53:05] but still next
[1:53:09] test came they start whining again
[1:53:13] we were better than egypt
[1:53:17] but god help us
[1:53:20] i think that's it from me today may lord
[1:53:24] bless you
[1:53:25] thank you brother brothers and sisters
[1:53:27] for
[1:53:28] your patience and like i say
[1:53:33] if you can take all just take this last
[1:53:36] part
[1:53:38] because god has been taking care of his
[1:53:42] children over there in israel
[1:53:45] and we are the spiritual children and
[1:53:48] everything
[1:53:49] is parallel with the children of israel
[1:53:54] with our age i mean you see
[1:53:58] how many arrogant uh armies were there
[1:54:02] we have arrogant people here not that
[1:54:05] still but only
[1:54:09] with god's help
[1:54:12] we're going we're going to overcome

[1:54:46] you father
[1:54:47] and if the people are here father it's
[1:54:49] because they love you lord
[1:54:53] i guess i'm not a worthy man to be here
[1:54:57] and
[1:54:57] speak or teach something father but if
[1:55:00] you come and teach us lord
[1:55:02] so we all can learn father we want to

[1:56:20] we thank you for the service lord
[1:56:24] father and us i ask you father so you
[1:56:27] can
[1:56:27] speak to the people
[1:56:30] father so they can be able to
[1:56:33] put me aside father and they can keep
[1:56:35] what they you
[1:56:37] spoke to them
[1:56:39] [Music]
[1:56:41] we ask you all these things in the name
[1:56:43] of the lord jesus christ
[1:56:45] amen i don't know who's next
[1:56:57] [Music]
[1:57:09] just a reminder to us god loves us
[1:57:12] he cares for us amen he's never forsaken
[1:57:15] us
[1:57:16] amen you know just thinking as it was i
[1:57:19] made the little comment
[1:57:20] when i was sharing the testimony that
[1:57:23] all this other stuff is just noise
[1:57:25] if we will get the noise out of our life
[1:57:29] we'll find that god is speaking to us
[1:57:31] every single
[1:57:32] day of our lives amen but satan's doing
[1:57:36] his best to raise as much
[1:57:38] noise as much drama as he can
[1:57:41] so that we get focused to the right to
[1:57:43] the left and what's behind us

[2:10:54] position god called her to she's not

[2:10:59] know i'll wait to claim that position
[2:11:02] i'm claiming it now in fact i'll tell
[2:11:04] you one of the things i regret about my
[2:11:06] my youth is that when i left the lord i
[2:11:09] never come back to him for almost 20
[2:11:11] years
[2:11:12] and there's one thing i could change in
[2:11:15] my life
[2:11:16] right here today i'd go back to 15 years
[2:11:19] old
[2:11:20] and i would serve him with everything
[2:11:22] i've got within me
[2:11:24] hallelujah i don't worry about what i
[2:11:26] possess what this that
[2:11:28] opportunity is nothing that's the one
[2:11:30] thing if i could go back
[2:11:31] i'd be 15 years old again and i would
[2:11:34] just go ahead and take that one more
[2:11:36] step and say lord i just completely
[2:11:38] trust you
[2:11:39] and i would just serve him with all that
[2:11:41] is within me
[2:11:43] hallelujah but what a privilege saints
[2:11:46] the prophet of god sister jerry and i uh
[2:11:49] you know my phone's usually dead by
[2:11:52] about noon because sister jerry sent me
[2:11:54] about 40 quotes
[2:11:56] but it's good because the comment and i
[2:11:59] get to send little things back to her
[2:12:00] it's actually been a lovely
[2:12:02] lovely thing that we've got started
[2:12:03] between us
[2:12:05] but i tell you what saints when i look
[2:12:07] at the word
[2:12:09] she sent me one here the other day i
[2:12:12] might not get the words right
[2:12:14] but somebody asked brother branham will
[2:12:17] the church be shut down
[2:12:19] he said no she won't be shut down she'll
[2:12:22] go up
[2:12:23] hallelujah isn't that beautiful
[2:12:27] we're not going to be shut down amen
[2:12:30] they might say well you can't go to
[2:12:31] church because we got some virus
[2:12:33] i'm sorry the church is filled with
[2:12:36] christ
[2:12:37] and this is the tabernacle amen this is
[2:12:40] the one that's got to be filled it's not
[2:12:42] about somewhere else
[2:12:44] oh so many lovely things in the word of
[2:12:46] god
[2:12:47] just keeps pointing us telling us it's
[2:12:50] coming
[2:12:51] it's coming it's coming but you see as
[2:12:53] brother chris preached on wednesday
[2:12:55] night
[2:12:56] my brother and sister you see we've got
[2:12:59] to be patient with god the devil will
[2:13:02] want us to jump to a conclusion and say
[2:13:04] but god didn't answer this prayer
[2:13:06] god must not care i thought it fit very
[2:13:09] nicely with what brother jose brought
[2:13:10] today
[2:13:12] because you see we wait upon the lord
[2:13:15] and when we're waiting god's
[2:13:16] molding us he's changing us he's doing a
[2:13:20] work that
[2:13:20] nothing else can do amen
[2:13:24] this world my brother and sister ever
[2:13:25] notices satan builds them up and then
[2:13:28] lets them fall apart he gives them fame
[2:13:31] but gives them and this is one of the
[2:13:33] beatles made this comment many years ago
[2:13:35] about we were given
[2:13:37] fame and that was our problem
[2:13:39] [Music]
[2:13:42] god gives you the holy ghost where's the
[2:13:44] problem

[2:13:57] is rising up
[2:13:58] hallelujah let's sing this before we're
[2:14:00] dismissed today
[2:14:01] [Music]
[2:14:03] as i look out across the land
[2:14:07] see god's mighty hand
