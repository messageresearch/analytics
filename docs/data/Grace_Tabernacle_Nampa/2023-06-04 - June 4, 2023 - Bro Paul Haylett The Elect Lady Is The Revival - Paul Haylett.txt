just to sacrifice we're not here just to labor we're not here to do but we have a promise of a Heavenly Home a Heavenly reward the word of God just reading this morning the prophet of God says God is causing us or bringing us to judge ourself here that we will not be judged again oh thank you Lord let me submit to your word Lord let me submit to you Lord that I can pass from death into life hallelujah it's good to be in the house of the Lord today amen hallelujah you know I even almost hate to have these pulmonaries but if you would be seated for just a moment just have a few things we want to touch upon for a quick moment here amen one as you would remember from previous announcement that Sunday school is over for the summer take the summer break so um God bless you and um how do I say this I'll just say it don't start coming just before church starts now that you don't have to show up for Sunday School let's come early to the house of God let's spend some time and enter in Amen to pray to worship I don't know about you some of us maybe are are affected by this world a little more than others but I'm telling you Saints it takes a few minutes to shake off the spirit of laodicea amen let's shake it off before we come to worship amen before we come to enter in let's come and and shake that off um June 14th is a Wednesday it was a decision I made and I have reversed myself there will be no Wednesday Service uh June the 14th many of you will have to work and then we will be transitioning to go and get set up at Camp the very next day and then there will be no Sunday service here at the church at the Tabernacle on the 18th of June and for those that won't be able to go to Camp I don't know I think many of you will be traveling there's a wedding a few things like that graduation uh amen um uh I hope this is not too much of an inconvenience for you but just simply will not have enough uh Saints here at the assembly to to Really hold this service or at least I trust that all of you that can will come to camp amen now I want to you know sometimes Saints um we have to be careful um that in the business God's business I I believe in transparency I believe in what we do needs to be defensible and when I say that is is not to be defensive like not my fault not this not that but be defensible of why did this happen and be able to say we did this for this reason we have spent your money for this reason and so this morning I'm giving you just a little transparency of what um we have chose to spend your money on and um those of you that would know in time message Tabernacle it's in Ferndale Washington right now brother John Andes felt led of the Lord and you know it's interesting and I won't get into the controversy but people you know say well brother John this but I happen to know that brother John's had this burden about having a church on the United on the state side for um probably in the in the decade plus um you know 12 15 years he's voiced we we need this and and then God laid upon his heart and he's done this and um we know from the early there's probably not too many of here from the early uh times of Grace Tabernacle but there was times that we shared buildings and you would walk into the building uh on a Sunday morning and literally there would be cigarette butts and beer cans and party balloons and trash everywhere and we would have to change the atmosphere before we could have church and really worship and so they have been in the community center they're in Ferndale and dealing with these same kind of issues and uh so God has granted to them uh to be able to lease a church uh that is closer to the airport there in Bellingham uh it's a lovely facility T it is going to be quite a burden upon them as a church it did not come cheap but they have prayed about it feel like that God opened this door for them and uh so they've been able to move now out of the Community Church Center for church into they're in the process now moving into a church of which they will be the sole occupant and I'm telling you do we remember the days when we became the sole occupant amen when you walked in the house of God whether it be a Wednesday night a Sunday morning and you could still feel the presence of God from the previous service there was no atmosphere of demons to be chased out no atmosphere of the Carnage of laodicea in there but you could walk through the doors of the church into an atmosphere that took you right back and brought you to a place that you could say thank you Lord for your blessings and I'm believing with all of my heart this is what God is is giving to those of end time message Tabernacle and um so we have our in the process of sending a offering to them and um we um with Council we have uh felt like a 2500 uh would be apportioned just help and encourage them to move forward so I just want you to know a little bit of that's where we're sending your money amen now you can divvy that up any way you want call it tithe call it offering call it this call it that it's all God's money and we are God's people amen that means we all are a part of the work that is being done and can we lift a hand and say thank you Lord for allowing me to be a part amen I don't want to be just a stranger an observer a bystander I want to be a part of it amen and oh God bless you brother personant sister akonsha God bless you good to see you here our brother Paul God bless you good to see you and your family here today you'll have to forgive me I'll have to work on remembering names it's always a struggle you know uh to to remember names amen uh and uh communion tonight 5 PM now sister Jerry shared with me I could insert this in the in the sermon real easy but I just bring it out right now Sister Jerry shared a little something with me a little clip which a man is talking about how Medical Science Now has figured out there's certain kind of cell in the human body and amazing my brother and sister that each cell in our body knows right where it belongs they can give you a blood transfusion and it doesn't all just go to your foot but the cells that are in that know right where they belong and medical Sciences now figured out that there is a healing power in the body now when things happen it's recorded in the brain right you're sitting here observing this morning you have an endless loop video playing in your mind this morning Medical Science has figured out there's uh forget the names but they have figured out that there's a certain kind of cell that resides only in the heart and that cell is not a singular cell to itself but as a cell that communicates as a cell that has memory and we can have traumas and we can have trials and we can have stresses in our life and we could say you know what I've had healing in my mind I've been able to put this to the side and I've been able to move on but their understanding that stress is recorded in the heart now if you'll just think about this you'll be able to take it right to scripture stress is recorded in the heart Joy is recorded in the heart the things of life are recorded in the heart and the scripture tells us that we are living in an age when men's Hearts would be failing for fear so it is a fear that is being recorded in their heart that is causing a failure but the psalmist David said that it is joy in the morning my brother and sister that brings the presence of God into our life it is the joy of the Lord and the deliverance and Thanksgiving in our hearts that is recorded in our hearts that gives our heart Liberty the word says if your heart condemns you not amen so there's not judgment recorded in your heart then you have confidence in God and I want to say this morning I want confidence in my God I want nothing but joy in my heart to be lifted up all the stresses of Life come the strain of life is here but we can by God's grace let that go and let the joy of the Lord our hearts Can someone say Amen this morning hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus amen and that calls me as that was said brother Tim to think as we've read requests speaking with brother Trevor last night amen we want to remember Joshua we want to remember our young people we want to remember each one that's not serving God and parents brothers and sisters elders our young people our teenagers are living in the worst of times let's not pray for them after the devil has tore them up and clawed them let's pray for them now that the Holy Spirit surround them the power of the word be there to lift them up we are just human and sometimes we as humans fail and you might say we fail miserably but it's the word of God that is holding each one of us not one of us today can say I'm standing on my strength but we have to acknowledge today I am standing by the grace of almighty God Amen let's just stand and lift our hands for a moment and thank him for his grace as we go into this service today I see my brother vasili God bless you brother amen Lord we just thank you today it's Grace Lord that you have given us we do not stand of our own accord father but we stand by The Amazing Grace that you have poured out upon us as your people I say thank you Lord and we just give praise to you this morning Lord to lift our voices lift our hearts and hands to say thank you for this amazing grace that is here today in our lives has come down and settled in our hearts that we truly can have confidence in you Lord bless the service I pray Hallelujah if we'll turn thank you amen beautiful song service amen I want to read out of Psalms 138 1-8 to start with amen you think we could read this together Saints could we coordinate ourselves to read this together you see this I bring to you today as part of the sermon but yet still just because it is such a lovely encouraging strengthening word of God don't you love it when the word of God gives you strength amen amen can we read together okay I will praise thee with my whole heart before the gods will I sing praise unto thee I will worship toward thy Holy Temple and praise thy name for thy loving kindness and for thy Truth for thou Hast magnified Thy word above all thy name in the day when I cried thou answered me oh Hallelujah and strengthen me with strength in my soul all the kings of the Earth shall praise thee O Lord when they hear the words of thy mouth yea they shall sing in the ways of the Lord for great is the glory of the Lord though the Lord be high yet hath he respect unto the lowly but the proud he knoweth afar off though I walk in the midst of trouble thou will revive me Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies and thy right hand shall save me the Lord will perfect that which concerneth me thy mercy O Lord endureth forever forsake not the works of thine own hands can we say Amen Hallelujah Lord bless the service I pray today amen you may be seated Saints some of you may or may not be uh aware of or or uh enlightened as it were into the proximity principle um are you aware of what the proximity principle is it actually has to do the way it's promoted in the world today is that if you want to be successful you hang out with or in the proximity of successful people if you want to uh uh be a good at business you don't go and seek the advice of poor businessmen if you want to be a good student you don't take the behavior of the student who is failing so the proximity would be that you would be in that little circle uh with those that are what you desire to be amen and so it's there my brother and sister that we as Christians we're not going to go into all the business Avenue but it certainly is true you want to be successful you you don't go with someone who by repeated failure believes they have good advice my brother and sister you find someone so as Christians we want to uh be in fellowship with we want to be close to truth amen we don't want to hang out as it were in the world today and say well I went here and I went there and I saw their faults and failures so therefore I believe I'm Authority what you want to do as the bride of Christ you want to be with the bride of Christ so that the truth that is present in the bride will have that proximity effect upon you in other words sometimes when we don't feel so encouraged in life anybody ever feel that way amen what happens when someone comes around that is singing the Praises of God someone calls you up and says I just felt to call you or I felt to text you and say God bless you and lift you up today that whatever your day might be that God is with you and not by brother and sister the proximity it is the word and and today I believe as I I would just come back my brother and sister speaking on things that are to be my brother and sister were talking about a Revival in this day and there has been a phrase that has been put out it wasn't direct words as it were from the prophet of God but my brother and sister people talk about the bride's Revival well we'll look at this you won't find anything where the prophet of God directly identifies what this bride's Revival would be or is but I'm here to tell you today as I speak to you the elect lady is the Revival she's not looking for a Revival she is the Revival my brother and sister we know the story as it were they were looking for the great Revival and you know they come to the policemen and we're looking for this and he's telling them you found it amen he didn't Point him to an address down the street he didn't tell him come back at a certain meeting time but he recognized that the Revival was in him and this bride my brother and sister is the Revival that the world is looking for today now I've had to cut back many quotes and many references just to try to fit it in a time frame today but I want you to understand my brother and sister that the answer is not to be found in our governments it's not to be found in the Nations or politics it's not to be found in the churches it's not even found as it were in the preacher or the actual body of Believers it's not found there the prophet of God clearly shows us it's found in Christ the word amen and so when we get in Christ the word and recognize that's where we belong that's when we come into the atmosphere of Revival amen and there has to have been life there already for it to be revived amen our sister being you know what she is in the medical field amen if someone's there and all the blood has run out of them and their heart hasn't beat for 20 minutes my brother and sister the very odds that they could ever be brought to life would have to be an act of God Amen because the life has left but if there is even the flicker of life in that individual then they can be by God's grace revived and so we're looking at the Dark Ages we're looking at all the time we're looking of the spirits of denomination and we're seeing that and people say well well why is he talking about Revival we've had Revival my brother and sister it was being revived back to the original life amen not just a life but an original life amen and without that Revival there will be no true life in the individual amen so it is my brother and sister once again the proximity principle is being close to look it up Webster Online will tell you it's been close to truth that doesn't talk about being close to uh uh Warren Buffett on how to own a few railroads and a few Airlines and a few coca-colas and whatever else my brother and sister it's truth amen now look there's a certain anointing of being on the scene I could pick almost any uh event today and tell you about what I have witnessed in my life and uh you you would you would be there and say okay that's good brother Paul that's a very Vivid picture that you've painted but you'll never have the same reaction as you would have if you were on the scene if you were there my brother and sister I understand the circumstances of life I'm a little hesitant to put this out this way but I will because they will be understanding but my brother and sister I've watched many a service online and I can tell you it's not the same as being there I have been in Services before traveling in our personal time vacation drop into a service we were there we felt the presence of God and sitting watching the same service again online and you realize something's missing because there's an anointing with being there in person now my brother and sister when we'll talk about the redeeming blood washing life-changing word of God in this hour to be told what that is is good we need to share this amen we need to give this but there's nothing like experiencing that for yourself there's nothing like having the power of God come down answer your questions when you never told anyone what the question was the power of God coming and moving in your life giving you directions before you ever come to that intersection of life God telling you this is where you need to go this is what you need to do this is where you need to stop as it were sister Jerry and I in Australia a few years ago we had quite a phenomenon our phones they didn't I guess the cell network didn't really like our phone or something and we'd be driving unfortunately I'm here to be transparent to you it caused a little friction between sister Jerry and I because we're driving down the road not only am I on the wrong side of the car hey man how many of you drove on the wrong side of the car amen it causes a little friction you got to remind yourself I got to stay next to the center line next to the center line you come to an intersection you know Center Line you just want to turn and go into the correct Lane but you're driving along there and and sister Jerry you know we're going by GPS and we would go by an intersection and Jared say you missed the turn and I said I didn't know it was my turn how did I supposed to know and then while the phone wouldn't tell us we needed to turn there it was instantaneous to tell us you missed it now correcting now correcting redirecting my brother and sister but the Holy Ghost amen the only time the Holy Ghost does not we don't hear it is because when we don't heed it amen God is Not diligent or negligent I mean to to let us just go on blundering through life without giving a word to us of what we need to do Can someone say yes I have experience amen so there's an anointing with being on the scene now in a minute we're going to read Acts 2 so you'll understand where we're going here but my brother and sister to be on the scene we have choices today we can either be in the upper room or we can choose to be on the street the people on the street said they're drunk and they were right come on do you hear me this morning they said they're drunk and they were right but they weren't drunk on carnal inspiration a carnal anointing they weren't drunk on the things of this world my brother and sister they were drunk on the Holy Ghost amen and so it's there as we today also have our opportunity to choose whether we want to be in the upper room or on the street amen I'll tell you look at this now everyone this will be hard for some of us in this day to digest everyone in the upper room the scripture tells us come in one mind and one Accord now that'd be all easy if you'll all just agree with me but it wasn't man that they were coming into one Accord with it was gone so we can all be in lockstep if you understand that phrase walking perfectly together we can be in lockstep my brother and sister and not be right do I need to repeat that we can be in lockstep every one of us agreeing with one another that does not make us right amen the unity that we must find has to be found in the word of God and when we find that Unity we will find the actual cares of Life the actual things of life we are able Can someone say we are able to take and set aside the difference of personality of the flavor of I like this or I like that I often joke you know that's why literally every year comes by they invent a new kind of ice cream because there are somebody who doesn't like the other 400 flavors but today will come when your favorite flavor of church of preachers of whatever is not available then what do we do you wonder why churches come into disharmity they come into a place where there's discourse uh not discourse discontent in the body of Believers is because they quit finding their unity in Jesus Christ and we're trying to find their unity in numbers we have 51 of the church stands with us I don't care about what your percentage is that stands with the preacher or stands with someone else I want to know how many of us are in unity with the word what is our important thing in our life that we look to and say Lord I have one desire not to stand with brother Paul not to stand with brother or whoever but I want to stand in a Unity with the word of God for this hour and when we can find that my brother and sister amen we find ourselves April to come into the house of God with not a burden to our heart I don't know about you are you able to separate your heart from your mind actually I would hope you could because the mind my brother and sister can be a large filing cabinet do you have a filing cabinet in your house you know some of you do some don't well I'll just use the example anyway go home open that file cabinet is everything inside that file cabinet important no sir you go back we file our business in storage boxes to get them out and get them put away and you know we're starting to go back uh quite a few years saved them way too long sister Jerry is there like oh look at this poem uh let's see how's that was in um that was in 1979 you would have been uh 17 years old you think this check's important yeah that's our mind we have filed grievances and we have also filed things that are of joy don't throw out the important things throw out the unimportant things let the important things be anchored in our soul my brother and sister how many of us today would literally say Lord I would ask you to come today and let our service be an upper room experience let our service be a service of the power of God would speak down through our building but we can't do that if our file cabinet is full of every bit of grievance and trash of the years gone by because those things will hinder us but by God's grace my brother and sister we can say you know what I've got to I've got things to worry about tomorrow I've got things I need to do tomorrow but I in the moment am going to let my heart rejoice in the presence of almighty God Amen I don't care what yesterday held I don't even care Saints if you're sitting here sleepy this morning and Satan trying to distract you I want you to let your heart loose let your heart be free let your heart Rejoice this this morning amen not let your heart be burdened amen they come not only in one Accord with the word but they had to come United with one another in Fellowship now it didn't change their distinct desire of certain food or certain spice or certain clothes or certain colors or certain place some can live right down in the very midst of this city crowded by honking horns and and traffic and others just would melt down there I can say that from experience my brother and sister I lived in an apartment when we were first married amen sister Jerry finally is like look you're worse than the dog you know every time a car drives by I'm at the window it's just a neighbor Paul it's the same car that shows up at five o'clock every single day and I'm like I gotta know who's in my yard it's not your yard it's a parking lot but people do that they live in that world and other people come out in our world and go you know it's a little bit creepy when you're out here by yourself no it's we're not here by yourself we have a neighbor a half a mile that way we have neighbors on top of the hill there's a neighbor down the road that way we're not alone you see we've got to come to the place my brother and sister that we realize the unity that we're looking for in the word of God is not a Unity of Conformity but it's a Unity where we can enter into one mind and one Accord with a word of God for this hour and when we can enter into that one of mind and one Accord amen it is there and I'll tell you I want to be United with you amen I want to be United with you I want to be in fellowship with all of you young and old amen I don't care about what your situation is and you're a teenager you're in high school you have a different set of things of your world I don't care I want to be in unity with you as my brothers and sisters and I want to be in unity with my Lord Jesus Christ I want to be in one mind with him that if he says stop I can say yes Lord if he says go I can say yes Lord Hallelujah sorry for holler and I'm just excited Amen in time seed sign brother Branham says here would be there I think what's the matter Church of God what's the matter with us what's the matter with you Baptists you Presbyterians Assembly of God Jesus only all the rest of you what's the matter with us can't you see the seed don't you be careful what kind of seed you're taking into the womb of your heart this is a very science my brother and sister that they have now discovered that your heart has a memory it is actually not so much that your brain is telling your heart to be it's your heart telling your heart to beat you realize if they continue medical things and correct me if I'm I'm got the facts a little wrong but my brother and sister you can be brain dead and your heart still beating it needs oxygen if they introduce oxygen the heart can go on beating because you see really the stimuli is not necessarily entirely encapsulated in the brain but the heart has an intrinsic instinct to keep on beating now let me bring it down to a term here to those of you that ever walked away from serving God and you got out there in the world out there and you were like I'm free amen I have moved out I'm a thousand or more miles away from home there's nobody here to tell me what to do but you couldn't enter into the world my brother and sister there was not single shackle there was not a single person looking over your shoulder you could be anything you wanted to be but there was something where in the brain that was keeping you from being the world no it was in the heart something down in the heart says you don't belong here you are not a part of this this is not who you are it wasn't a brain because the brain would be fanciful that this group of people this cute girl this circumstance over here that would be fun that would be good I want to do it and the heart is over here saying no amen what we got to do is separate Satan's influence on the brain amen and let it be God's influence in the heart because when we'll surrender the heart to God he'll take you through laodicea he'll take you through this wicked age he'll take you through every dire circumstance he'll take you through every jungle through every desert through every Mountaintop every Valley but we've got to listen to the heart and not the brain amen be careful what kind of seed you're taking into the womb of your heart don't take Creeds take the word they've been talking so much about latter rain in this funny here because brother Branham actually has very much a rebuttal here against the latter rain and the critics of the message are like well William Branham was all caught up in that ladder rain nonsense well when you read this this is one that tells me amen he says they're talking so much about latter rain not discarding you latter rain Brethren but that's not latter rain amen the very thing they said this is the move of God this is the move of God the prophet of God's there saying not is not the move of God man no wonder they even kicked him out of that movement huh if the latter rain would have been here the power of God would have struck that thing and cheetah swept the world the latter rains fixed it up whoa this gives us room for a Doctrine there's still room for a lot of rain Doctrine anybody want to join me I hope you do amen a lot of rain's fixing to come what's the matter the church is manufacturing herself something just like Eve tried to do she tried to have more light to manufacture something we've done the same thing trying to make something in ourselves oh look at that keep your hand off of it let God do it amen take his word believe it hold it in your heart and when the rain begins to fall life will take hold and the word will manifest itself amen we don't have to produce this my brother and sister now there's many quotes about the Sheep you don't tell the Sheep make us wool you don't go out whisper in the sheep's ear make me some wool the Sheep makes wool because he's a sheep and the bride will manifest the word of God in this hour because she is the bride it won't be that we got to manufacture there that we've got to have a certain thing to prove that God is present but I tell you what my brother and sister if you was just to go and have time to just sit out there and watch a sheep any sheep that's healthy wants a lot of water wants food and wants shade and everything else just happens Lead Me beside the Still Waters cover me Lord with a shadow I win that I couldn't just trust you that I can just stop with my care of life and say Lord you see that's when we come in unity footsteps on the sands of time we all know the story we've all seen a picture here or there of the footsteps on the sands of time do you realize my brother and sister that it was actually a necessity to come with you know in the story it's like Lord why did you leave me only one set of footsteps and the Lord telling them no that's when I carried you but my brother and sister do you realize it's actually not a sign of being in tune with the word when we're walking on our own it's when we come to the end of our string and there's only one set of footprints in our lives one set of footprints in our families only one set of footprints in our church that's when we truly have come into the correct position but yet we as humans say I need to be strong I need to be strong I tell you what I need to be I need to be weak and let Christ have his way I need to submit myself and say Lord I can't do this any longer Lead Me Lord Carry Me Lord because I tell you I know the human nature well enough after these many years my brother and sister if we can do something on our own and we as humans will be prone to do it on our own but God's going to bring you amen can I make you all discouraged this morning God's going to bring you to a place that you can't even walk on your own and we fight against it we fight against and we fight against it you should rejoice in it say Carry Me Lord Carry Me Lord because then I walk on my own my footsteps and your footsteps are not perfectly lined up but when he's carrying us amen when the rain begins to fall life will take hold that's what we need to look for that's the latter rain my brother and sister that the prophet of God believed in now let's turn in our Bibles I forgot me a hanky amen well praise the Lord that's all right I hope you all don't mind me kind of snotting around here amen Titus grab me Kleenex right there two or three oh is your name Titus okay okay I didn't know if they was like middle name or something Acts 2 verse 16 through 21. I was just kidding brother Tim amen two Acts 2 and 16 . now look what is brought here their Supernatural event taking place things happening my brother and sister that the world is questioning because they've never seen such now just because the world has not seen it does that mean it's not of God that's what the Pharisees problem was that's what the Sadducees herodians they've never seen this that's what's wrong in Israel right now I like to watch some of these deals of some of these rabbis over there they get some of them are pretty strong you wonder about the spirit that Jesus faced in that day you just have to go and watch through some of these things of these priests and whatnot that are there and these rabbis you know and uh you know some of them come out so strong you know if this and this and this ever happened why blah blah blah and no way it's just a deceit it's a lie we have tradition well good my Bible says you're going to die in your tradition amen I'll tell you what I want to do I want to die in the blood amen and I'm not talking about natural death I'm talking about spiritual death I want to die in the blood amen and let life amen as the rain begins to fall amen then that's when life appears amen but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last days so it's our day is talking about saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your son and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and upon my handmaidens I will pour out in the house in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy where is this taken place my brother and sister there are people here today in the message saying we're looking for that day to happen but you know what they're going to make a mistake and are making a mistake they're trying to manufacture that amen we haven't even got unity in the body in the fellowship and we're going to try and manufacture this why don't we get United in the word and let the word produce it in us because when the word produces it it will last amen it will stand every storm every understanding every trial of life but when it's manufactured you know they manufacture almost everything in this day and age I've seen some time back in advertisement for a deal that it's just like oatmeal well if it's just like oatmeal wouldn't it be oatmeal but it's held together with a few binders which the man who showed it to me says I'm pretty sure these are the same binders that's in wood glue what kind of spirit are we being held together with come on Grace Tabernacle let it be the Holy Ghost That Binds us together as a body of Believers not that just oh we have a good program we have good friendships we have this but let it be the Holy Ghost let this not be kind of like a real manifestation of God let it be a manifestation of God no need to be bind bound together with a good program amen says he'd pour out his uh in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in Heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and Vapor of smoke and the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the Lord and it shall come to pass that whosoever I mean that looks pretty dire when you look at acts 2. it looks pretty dire my brother and sister but we come here now in this time it shall come to pass verse 21 that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved amen not standing next to someone who's calling on the name of the Lord not standing in a church where they're calling on the name of the Lord but you and I can someone say Amen you and I calling on the name of the Lord I clipped this out of my sermon but I'm sorry I gotta reinsert this I tell you what fear and anxiety does it paralyzes you paralyzes you my brother and sister what else could we explain why in the time we should be calling on the name of the Lord we call on nothing but the banker or the doctor the word is what takes our paralysis away the presence of almighty God we can sit and say whoa there's problems in the church be a part of the solution that's not to come with a list of all the things wrong that's for you to get down on your knees and call out to God and say Lord I believe you want us as a body of Believers to be in unity and I want to be in unity I think I might be right but if I'm wrong Lord I Want to Be Right I want to be in unity with the body but what Satan Dewey does his very best Amen to come and bring us to the place come on Saints I'm not just preaching to myself I've been there I'm not just preaching myself he'll come on the place we become mute when we should be crying out to God calling upon the Lord why because we have a desire we have a desire to be saved do it amen when we should be calling on the name of the Lord to ensure our Salvation Satan gives us mute makes us mute we come to the place well how's life brother would you guys really want to know Farm Commodities are down anything to do with the replacement part has tripled fuel has moderated but we already spent the 150 000. can't do nothing about that can't find anybody that wants to work come on if that was my message you would grow tired of it so quickly I leave that man behind I leave him out of the door I leave him because he has nothing to do with who I am and who you are we are Sons and Daughters of God Called to a high commission called to a high calling and the very same God of Abraham is here this morning and Abraham my brother and sister had so many problems we would never have put him in the book as an example but God said I use him for the example because I'm showing you it had nothing to do with you it had all to do with what or who I said you were and we either have to believe our own flesh or we have to believe the word and I say Lord help me be in unity to the word let me be unified with the word amen see once again just being close won't work you know you can have a situation dire circumstance you can be trying to save someone's life there'll be an individual standing right there you'll say call an ambulance and that individual will turn to no one in particular call an ambulance and no one calls an ambulance God didn't send this message my brother and sister to be some ambiguous message it was a message that was targeted right to you it was a message that was so perfectly fit to you then it went to every continent Every Nation every household of every Providence of ever and targeted you amen this is not a random God this is a God that says I want to be in unity with you I need you so much I want you so much amen hallelujah sorry to deviate here but it's there my brother and sister you have to wonder about a man who would be Romancing your young girl and he would be like well you know I want to get married oh oh you do oh wonderful yeah do you cook yeah do you clean yeah good I'll marry you God's not just looking for someone live a perfect life in laodicea are you with me Saints he's not now look and show you the quote said those people out there are more sincere than you how about if we focus in this message here today God there's more sincere people than you you guys are nothing there's more sincere people than you but my brother and sister it wasn't about how sincere you are it's how great the God is that chose you it's how great the God is they said I am your Redeemer I have come for you and I'm gonna put not in just life in you but Revival in you I'm gonna make my word bubble up and bring life out of you where the world thought there was death I'll bring life we might even ourselves have declared oh it just seems like I'm a failure seems like I make so many mistakes and God's there just keep walking yes keep walking amen I'll take care of the details keep walking oh Hallelujah is it all right to be excited amen Hallelujah oh let's just look real quick I need to hurry along I got so much stuff here this looks like the grand Gourmet Amen in the Southern church age brother Brown says here oh which God's a church we're cold or hot best of all she should be fervent hot but she is not sentence has been passed you know that would almost impress us the sentence been passed my brother and sister but remember I got a quote I didn't bring it today but I got a quote where the prophet of God says what happens is we get hot and we kind of drift back down and we start getting cooler and cooler a little bit formal we get cooler and before God lets us get cold he gets us hot again and he said this is a cycle it's a cycle he typed it back to Israel this is cycle Israel but we know if it was a cycle a type of Israel it's a type of you and I and I think we should this a hand and say yep that happens to me I get on fire and then things happen and I cool off a little bit and then I realize whoa somehow or another where'd you go Lord where'd you go then we get on fire again come on am I telling the truth amen I I wasn't thinking I was talking to AI here or something amen we're just programmed to lift the hand amen amen amen sentences didn't pass she's no longer God's voice to the world wow so the church is no longer God's voice to the world she will maintain that she is but God says not oh God still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride can I hear your voice Bride Can someone say amen I believe this I believe God gave me a voice [Music] Hallelujah no voice is in the Bride As we said and we'll talk more about that later my brother and sister you go right into Revelation you'll see the spirit and the bride say come so that bride has to be in Harmony Harmony and unity to be seeing the same thing as the spirit and I'm gonna just get a little excited this morning God's allowing me to have the same voice The Same Spirit of his spirit the very life that is in Christ is in me and that life gave me his voice oh praise the Lord that's why this bride should have a Revival is having a Revival amen because the voice of almighty God is in her [Music] oh thank you Lord now you notice he didn't say the voice was in the church or whatever name is above the door we're of this we have it we have that we have it you see the beauty about preaching a message like this is it can be ambiguous enough that it's not me deciding whether you're bride and have a voice or not it's you deciding whether you're bride and whether you have a voice so nobody will be able to say brother Paul preached and made it sound like I'm not bride no sir that's your decision and if the word says you're not bride I think you ought to go back and read it again huh come on God didn't call us out of this gutter of laodicea my brother and sister for us to sit in church and doubt Who We Are God called us from the very beginning because I know who you are and all I have called shall come no I have not lost a single one man that ought to be enough to get us excited amen it doesn't matter the name above the voice the door my brother and sister The Voice the Revival is in the individual people are like well I'll tell you what or is a preeminent Message Church well your message Church might have some preeminent people in it and I can declare your whole church it's not preeminent well I know it's brutal for us to acknowledge these things but we know what the prophet of God said amen now I'm not here to put anyone in or out I'm here to encourage every one of you run the race with all that's within you amen reminds me of a little story true story this little boy little sawed off legs couldn't run that fast kind of almost required in school to to go out and get into a sport and he was in track and he ended up in cross country and his little short-legged thing all these long-legged guys you know and be like me and brother Sergey having a race yeah that isn't a good example neither one of us would probably make it to the city block and we'd be done but I was running with all these long legged kids and they're just going along he's back there and he's going along and they're coming on the last lap of the course and one of the guys says hey hey it's like last place last place is a loser pass one guy passed another guy and they're like what's happening with him tongue hanging out slobbering I look dizzy he's just running and he's passing people and he ran right by the finish line and kept right on going and they're like hey come back here I'm telling you Saints if I could use that as a little example to you don't just look for the Finish Line I hope I make it for the Finish Line you keep running that you cross right over the threshold of glory and run right in the presence of almighty God Not Looking Back oh make it fall down half on the line no sir get anointed you're not losers you're the Bride of Jesus Christ and you've been called to carry the Revival of the last age message and that is not a Revival we're going to carry and lay down somewhere that's her Revival gives energy and Life to us when the devil screams and the world's crying and everything's falling apart we can say I'm sorry but I gotta finish the race I'm not a loser Hallelujah oh can I finish amen let's look here the pergament church age notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything it was first showed to him by the father John 5 19. this harmony now exists between the groom and his pride this is not for someone else well they all go to that church they all this they owe that the elders in their church this their Pastor was that forget that my brother and sister amen we're here today looking at the harmony between us and our bridegroom can someone just humor Paul and lift a hand and say Lord I want that Harmony I want that in my life Lord I want that that's something I want to possess hey man oh he shows her you know brother Branham I mean his is very presumptuous I mean let's just face it he was almost arrogant to actually be able to make a claim that God is going to show his bride his word don't we need a middleman I don't want to drive the point home but I think you know where I'm coming from do we need a middleman amen it don't matter what religion there is and I'm sorry Even in our midst there are those that think we need a middleman but I'm here to believe what the prophet of God said right there amen the harmony now it to exist between the groom and the bride he shows her his word of life and she receives it are there any receivers here today amen I'm receiving this from my father amen from my God I'm receiving this amen and she receives it and she never doubts it amen come on therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will rise up again here is the secret of this the word has been laid on the pulpit in a message Church read this again Saints the word is in the bride as it was in Mary come on are you with me when the word was in Mary It produced Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah and the word is in you and I today and what are we going to produce not another message church not a denomination we're going to produce Jesus Christ and I'll tell you any woman that is happy to be married to her husband in a natural sense proud to be married to this man is happy to carry his seed happy to produce that life and this little bride here in laodicea is happy to be called The Bride of Jesus Christ she's happy to bring forth Jesus Christ again oh my God the Brian has the mind of Christ for she knows what he once done with the word now isn't really the message just for us to debate we can have you know Debate Club instead of Bible study we could argue I won't go there I definitely won't go there she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord and then the word is quickened by the spirit and comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose you see what God our purpose is my brother and sister our purpose is not to become Canon fodder to laodicea our purpose is not to go out here and get so scarred that seems like there's nothing in our life worth living that's not our purpose our purpose is to manifest the very life of Jesus Christ amen amen Church Wherever You Are what you belong to makes me no difference but there's one thing you must know we've got to be in Christ or you're dead you can't live outside of him you're right your church might be all right as a building your fellowship might be all right as a man but when you deny the body the blood and the word of Jesus Christ you're dead the minute you do it it's God's chosen place of worship now I hope you're catching what's happening here because in a minute you're going to kind of catch this little miniature bombshell amen it's talking about when you deny the body the blood and the word of Jesus Christ you're dead the minute you do it it's God's chosen place of worship okay let that sink in that's where his name is exactly there is where he chose to put his name not in church but in the son Jesus Christ notice safety lied only in the place of his choosing in his lamb in the name of the Lamb notice it was a male lamb a he not a her not a church she but his name not her name where he was going to meet the people was not in her name but in his name him the lamb oh sorry about that now we say the church the Great Mighty Church she did this she did that she has weighed the storms we've picked up population we're great numbers we're a mighty Church she's a great thing but God never said anything about a she he said him him is a meeting place the lamb not the church not her name but his name he didn't put her name anywhere but he put his name in him and that's why all we must do in word or deed we must do it all in the name of Jesus Christ if we pray we got to pray in the name of Jesus if we ask a petition we've got to ask in the name of Jesus in Jesus name if we walk we walk in Jesus name if we talk we talk in Jesus name if we baptize we've got to baptize in the name of Jesus Christ and all that we do in word or deed we do it in the name of Jesus Christ amen my brother and sister Mary shows how insignificant that we really are but yet we are the greatest thing because the prophet of God if you'll bear with me and the prophet of God said that a Godly wife was the greatest thing that could be given to a man Brothers can we say Amen amen and if the prophet of God making that type that the greatest thing that could be given to a husband is a Godly wife then we are the greatest thing that has ever been given to Jesus Christ amen he said I'm gonna mold you into this very image of my perfect wife I'm gonna claim you and I'm gonna mold you into that and nothing else not heaven it'll pass away not earth it will pass away but the word in you oh cannot pass away this bride is eternal amen this Bride is a very Mind Of God that has been expressed to the world oh thank you Lord we're not just some people trying to make it through I'm trying to live right I'm trying to make a Rapture you are the word amen you are flesh today living the very life of God and his seed in this bride will produce another Jesus Christ amen hallelujah oh Hallelujah amen amen did we have some more slides there brothers did we have God's chosen place of worship oh okay excuse me let me move on I hit the screen and amen sometimes we just get beside ourselves now look I chose some place of worship him the lamb we're missing a portion Brothers hmm well yeah there should have been much more of that could be my fault and again brother Gideon's got strong shoulders we baptized baptize the name okay in that same sermon excuse me I just want to share this and the mighty Church did this this that all we must do indeed in the name of Jesus we pray we pray in the name of Jesus we ask for petition we got to ask in Jesus name we walk we walk in Jesus name if we talk we talk in Jesus name if we baptize we got to baptize the name of Jesus Christ for all we do and word or deed we do in the name of Jesus Christ now paragraph 62 for the Gideon if you can find paragraph 62 I would much appreciate that a fellow said to me one time discussing that he said brother my wife I don't see her name is such and such he's a minister maybe sitting here now my wife she's got my name I don't just say Jones He said because it wasn't Jones He said she don't have to get up every morning I hope you see a little humor in this too with the point amen get get up every morning get the broom and say now I sweep the floor in the name of Jones my wife sweeping the house in the name of Haley well you know the name halot means little Haymaker so maybe she'll want to change it to Jones I don't know what Jones means but you know in the name of it I sweep this house no no catch this my brother and sister said I I watched it today dishes in the name of Jones I I patched the clothes in the name of Jones He said I don't think you have to call any name at all brother Brown says I believe you do and he said well why she don't have to say it everything she does is in the name of Jones to begin with I said but you never walk down the street and got her now think about this he's talking about previous to marriage you never walk down the street and got her and said come on Jones young men don't try it it's not going to work just walking up to some girl say your name is now whatever your last name is come on no sir you think about that quite a thing amen so he says uh but you never walk down the street and got her come on Jones and she had to become first by ceremony a marriage ceremony Jones and if she didn't you're living in adultery but you're baptized any way other but the name of Jesus Christ it's an adultery baptism which is not found in the Bible but you do in word and deed and do all in the name of Jesus and after that what you do but first you have to become in his name there is many fine women in this building tonight find loyal women but there's one Mrs William Branham she's the one that goes home with me she's the one that's my wife there's fine people in the world fine churches but there's one Mrs Jesus Christ that's who's coming that is who he's coming for that's where his name lays now get this I I really wish this was on the screen but it's fine it is brother Gideon but it's not there hmm 62. paragraph 62 really get it that's all right we'll move on Saints it's it's fine God's good amen there is where his worship is in her and her alone is it soaking in is it soaking in Jesus Christ doesn't have two wives he doesn't have three wives or four or a hundred you know there's like three thousand and something registered denominations now he doesn't have three thousand lives one wife and there's worship is in oh my brother and sister does it strike you in the heart this is where God wants to express himself and this is where he is giving us this opportunity to say this is what you are this is who you are Lord and this is what we think of you this is how we see you this is how we desire to worship and to serve you and it is the word coming through you and I it's our voice his word amen he doesn't have another word he can't change another word but Thy word is coming and we have become his worship oh thank you Lord hallelujah amen I'll tell you what my brother and sister you got to just love this Amen in this bride of Christ that's where his worship

the great Revival to move us in the Rapture I'm here to tell you it's already showed up it's already here cause the bride is already on the earth and the word is working mightily in her and she is confessing that he is her husband and he is the very life he's everything to me and that's where he comes he says that's my wife I tell you what there's nothing like going somewhere amen and somebody

to church because of long-winded preacher and I thought thank you Lord I've been blessed to go to church with wonderful people because you got a long-winded preacher but you're still here and that just shows that you have a hunger for the word of God it's not about the man up here it's not about personalities it's not about all these things it's hunger for the word can we just once again lift

tonight I pray in the precious name of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah amen I got a bunch of songs here Saints God bless you we'll see you this evening amen excuse me we do not have enough for everyone so if you would take it even if you took it home bring it back um brother Barry brother Barry sent out these little newsletters about Vision books and I want to just be very very clear so there is no misunderstanding brother Barry's not looking for your money brother Barry is letting you know or the money that's already been given has went this is not a solicitation this is not something to make us think oh my I I you give according to your heart brother Berry shared this because it's kind of a testimony to to the saints that have given and this church has given I'll keep it simple this church has given many thousands to this work and it's here if you look and and uh brother vasili would you just step up here real quick so when the people leave and put these on the table back there people could look at them they sent us I think 12 of them so obviously not enough for everyone to take one home and keep it uh but when you look in this you'll see a little introduction of talking about running with the message talking about the countries all over quite a list across here let's see that's uh five deep one two three four five six seven eight uh so roughly there's 39 countries the vision books has made it impact some countries have not had a new message book in 17 years and the message is now coming and the impact right of vision Malawi they're now got a vision to print their own to press forward the it's blessing the Saints so much and so you'll see here when you glance through this and my brother and sister I want you to see it's there in Malawi and sharing these different countries and we're not lifting up brother Barry we're not lifting up Vision books but this was just a little brief thank you that brother Berry could print very inexpensive and share that you would know what is happening with the dollars that you give his offerings and I wanted to bring this to your attention once again in a transparency that you would know what we are doing with the money that you give to Grace Tabernacle we want to support that I have a letter at home from Brother George talking about a half a dozen countries that um the ministry of [Music] it's brother George's Believers International flavor is international are doing we want to support this we don't want to isolate ourselves and just sit down and say they're there we're here we want to support it whatever country it is I'll just give you an idea I'm sorry to draw you out but Years Ago by God's grace when they had earthquakes in Chile this devastated we got to see the damage and by God's grace we raised here you might say through Grace Tabernacle tens of thousands of dollars that we sent to Chile Brothers contacted me and said brother Paul is this money only for people who as it were believed the message like us God forbid God forbid it's not for me to decide and the money the support went to churches that had many different doctrinal points of view of the message and I got to be a recipient of grown pastors men who maybe doctorally did not agree exactly where we stood come crying on your neck saying thank you for displaying the love of Christ to us restoring houses in churches and things like that and my brother and sister as I said not a solicitation for money but we just want you to know God's doing a mighty work said it would be a powerful work in the end time and God is moving in countries he's using every tool he's using technology he's using all this stuff Brothers interpreting translating all of this stuff with all this latest voice over technology all these things it used to take forever to do is being done very brief and the scripture said it would be a short quick work I say God let us be a part of a short quick work God bless you Saints we love you in the Lord sorry if um no I won't say that anyway God bless you [Music] Lord [Music] Jesus [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] I love you [Music] always [Music] you're here [Music] I hope there's other things [Music] behind me [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign thank you [Music] thank you [Music] foreign foreign
