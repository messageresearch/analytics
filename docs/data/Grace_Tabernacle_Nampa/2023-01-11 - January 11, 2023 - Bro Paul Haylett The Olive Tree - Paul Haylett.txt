visitors God bless you I believe you're from New Mexico if I understood that correct amen well God bless you and happy to have you with us tonight just good let's um let's not forget you know sometimes you're sitting there in the back and you're like okay we've got to remember these prayer requests but the minute you get out here they seem to just come back to you and we want to remember brother Isaac's sister Kristen tonight um uh um Monumental day for them they actually signed the papers for their home today and uh so depending on how you look at that they've gained a home or they've gained a few hundred thousand dollars in debt but um we're just happy uh God has blessed them after all these years to be able to have a home to call their own and it is also their what anniversary 15. my own son-in-law and I can't remember how long he's been married yeah tomorrow 15 years so they just doing and then on top all that brother Isaac doesn't feel good so uh just remember them in prayer our brother Bob sister Joanne uh I think it's on our prayer list all the time brother personal and sister akonsha but I don't see brother Tim and sister Miriam tonight so I don't know I think they're still not feeling too good and just the all these things that we have almost empty church for travels and whatever but the Lord knows and you know just as I've often mentioned the little quote I have in the office you know no problem or two or three are gathered together and then so we are the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and he has given us assurance that we uh we can count on that he is here with us tonight so let's just stand thank you brother uh just a wonderful song service amen I sure appreciate shape that and sister Ruth amen I want to speak to you tonight this might seem a little different so I don't know how this will turn out um I want to speak to you tonight on the olive tree and it's a much bigger subject than we can deal with in one Wednesday night but as we were there in Israel there was just so many things spoke to us and uh we we were just mentioning that the other night just how special that was and and brother Trevor and I and you look at this and realize all of these things and God bless you brother for ceiling glad to see you here amen when we see all these things and the prophet of God says you know that when you go to Israel the Bible will become a brand new book to you and I can honestly say from my heart it has there are so many little things that you see that you never really truly grasped them before you know it was interesting now there's a lot of they say this is what it was but you know always in my mind all all my life I've fought now the manger that Christ was born in I can see you know one of those little mangers with the wooden legs crossed and so easy to build and whatever we get over there and then they present you with this fact that probably the manger that he laid in was out of stone and it just shocks your little preconceived notions that it's there and we saw several different places where somebody with Incredible skill carved a manger out of a rock and uh but we wanted to talk on the Olive Tree tonight let's turn in our Bibles uh to the Book of Romans we'll start with the first verse and I'm just going to read a small portion of this because I actually have 23 verses there that there's something I want to draw from all of that so if you don't mind tonight we'll read the first four and then we will preach as we go through this covering these other scriptures so amen Romans 11 1. I say then hath God Cast Away his people God forbid for I also am an Israelite of the Seed of Abraham of The Tribe of Benjamin God hath not Cast Away his people which he foreknew aren't you glad we can say Amen to that tonight amen he did not Cast Away those he foreknew and we are those he foreknew amen thank you Lord what ye not the scripture say if Elias how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying Lord they have killed thy prophets and dig down thine altars and I am left alone and they seek my life but what saith the answer of God unto him I have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal Heavenly Father we just ask you Lord to just bless our time together this evening Lord we're thankful Lord have our brother vasili back off of the road with us tonight Lord we're thankful to have our brothers and sisters visiting with us just ask your father speak to our hearts tonight let the word of God God just come and invigorate US father to put the day the week behind us just to come into your presence Lord and we thank you Father for the opportunity that you granted us tonight to assemble together we ask for this blessing in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated how that must have been just a little bit I think sometimes we feel this ourselves in the day that we live in we kind of feel like Lord where is this bride we we go to church with a group of Believers a body of Believers but yet sometimes we feel so alone we feel kind of you might say a little isolated and you know we look around and we have our little church and and you know you think well you know there's not too many Believers in this area hundreds several hundred thousand people where they aren't but my brother and sister God knows exactly where every one of his sons and daughters are there is not a single one that has been misplaced or set to the side that we need to get uh you know pardon me for using that phrase bent out of shape of how is this going to happen God's got it all in control can we say Amen tonight because if he doesn't have it in control we need to be anxious about everything but that's not what the word says this word does not say be anxious for everything saying the word says that we as Believers will come to a position of rest in Jesus Christ and it's there in that rest that we can look out this doesn't give us a license to be lackadaisical it doesn't give us a opportunity to just brush it off and say well whatever will be will be but we can stand every day and say Lord we want your perfect will in our lives and we trust you so much Lord to follow your leadership that's taking us into your perfect will and so you know this Human Side of us gets in the way sometimes like daily but uh you know we we are in a position that we can simply say Lord I Will Follow You amen and so as we look at this I want to go on with verse 5 even so then at this present time also there is a Remnant according to the election of Grace and I just love how the prophet showed us that we can take this the scripture here speaking back to those in Israel at that time but it also is speaking directly to us in this day and I I love that that in this present time there is a Remnant according to the election of Grace and if by Grace then it is no more of Works otherwise Grace is no more Grace but if it be of works there is there is then is it no more grace otherwise work is no more work what then Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for and as we were speaking to the the other day so they are living in this small portion of about 17 percent of their land and they still have a desire this conflict that is going on a change of government and people say uh this now uh Netanyahu being elected now is a huge mistake and a conflict but my brother and sister you see this right here they are still seeking to obtain what God God promised them and so this will never stop it will never end there will be no time that they stop and say okay we will no longer move forward on this no more than the devil can offer the opportunity to you the bride of Christ to call a truce today to say I'll just settle down right where I'm at today God has sent a prophet we have an open book I'm just going to settle down here that's not the spirit that God has anointed the bride of Christ with she is moving into her promise and Satan cannot stop her she will be discouraged sometimes she will falter maybe wander a little bit but in the end the anointing word the anointed word will come upon her so strongly that she must seek the very face of God and the revealed word of the hour is the revealed face of God in our day and you can move right into that and lay claim to that amen so it's there I love how the scripture this is so obvious when you are there in Israel to see this and then Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained and the rest were blinded according as it is written God hath given them the Spirit of Slumber eyes that they should not see and ears they should not hear unto this day see this is not as it was when this was written spoken to the Romans it's this day and you go there and and as we were uh just recently on a tour in Israel and and it's there that you you look around and you see people uh they're they're performing all of their religious rights but it is as though they are performing there's not a great sincerity there's not a great uh burning desire there they're just performing this and it is by this this promise that we're reading right now that we realize that they do desire you get in a conversation uh with them and they desire the things of God but God has put this Spirit upon them and they are now in this Slumber in their eyes and their ears and as we'll go a little further we know these things as as message Believers but it just strikes you that it is there that it is such a beautiful sight now that might sound strange to say it's a beautiful sight but literally you get to see them in their slumber and we don't glory in the fact they're in a slumber but you see they do have a promise amen there is a promise to Israel but we're seeing this and the reason I would say that we could get a little excited is because clearly without them being in a slumber we would not be in our position we are in today and God in his grace and mercy said I'm going to make a way for you even if I have to take my own chosen people and put them in a condition and put them in a position and I will do that for you and I can only say thank you Lord because otherwise where would we be amen and so it is written God hath given them the Spirit of Slumber and eyes they should not see in ears they should not hear unto this day and David saith let their table be made a snare into and a stumbling block and a recompense unto them let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down their back all way I say then have they stumbled that they should fall God forbid but rather through their fall salvation has come unto the Gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them The Riches of the Gentiles how much more their fullness oh look at the Glorious Day that is coming my brother and sister this bride of Christ this Gentile bride is going to be sealed and she's going to already have taken her position but look at the glory that God is going to pour out on the 144 thousand there is going to be such Revelation come down to them an outpouring of the holy spirit that their lives are going to be transformed it's going to be an incredible sight would almost make you want to be there to witness it but I thank you Lord we won't be here to witness it but the truth of it is we see the same kind of revealing or opening of the word the same moving of the holy spirit that moved upon us is going to move upon them we're going to see that same Awakening that same recognition and the same output pouring of Revelation that they're going to be able to look and say oh my and they are going to worship they're going to pour their hearts out they are going to ask God for forgiveness they're going to raise up with their fruit of their lips which is praising to the Lord and we're going to see a glorious time I just can't wait my brother and sister to to uh see the the finishing or the completion of the plan of God amen because he's riches my brother and sister that's how the word puts it as riches amen God diminished them to raise us up and all I can say tonight is thank you Lord thank you Lord because we would still be out here in denomination trying to do a good work we would be out here trying to live just right and do all kinds of sacraments and all kinds of tradition and to to do that trying to you know as it is coming maybe from Catholic background as our family is a ways back and you look at this and realize we would be just trying to do everything just right so God would be pleased but God says I'm rich in Mercy and I'm willing to take and dampen Israel and Shine the Light on you that you would be able to come and it stirs my heart amen now I'll get along to my thought about the The Olive Tree in just a moment here amen for I speak to you Gentiles and as much as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles I magnify my office if by any means I may provoke you to imitate emulation provoke you to emulation them which are my flesh and might save some of them for if the casting away of them be reckoned the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead for if the first fruit be holy the lump is also holy thank you Lord and if the root now let's remember verse 16 if the root be holy so are the branches and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild Olive Tree were Graft in among them and with them partake us of the root and the fatness of the Olive Tree boast not against the branches but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root the my brother and sister we simply can look at how this ties in the scripture and as it is we do not have Christ Christ has us amen the minute we think we could actually live without him is the minute of our downfall amen so we look at this and realize if there be any good thing if there be any life if there be any fruit that would be born it is from the root amen it is not the branch amen so we look at this boasts not against the branches but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee thou will say then the branches are broken off that I might be Graft in well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou stand Us by faith can we say thank you Lord that we stand by faith tonight be not high-minded but fear for if God spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee um amen Grace Grace and to disgrace certainly a spirit that's in the world today behold therefore the goodness and severity of God on them which fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou also shall be cut off and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be Graft in for God is able to graft them in again amen thank you Lord for your word as we were there in in Israel we look at this and and uh as we traveled the country I become a little bit enthralled with the Olive Tree and you know they have a um the longest known living Olive Tree is more than 1500 years old and many olive trees lived to be 500 years old very common and so it is to me very beautiful how that the scripture ties The Olive Tree into our lives and so it's there that we can see uh this this uh nature that God put in the Olive Tree it's not just for a condiment at our meals but God just give a hole you might say a whole Ministry into the Olive Tree and so we see that the olive tree has been brought in it becomes a great example a great representation to us and Olive Tree is often considered a representative of Israel of the Jews and so it's there that we look at this and realize now that Mount of Olives at one time not now but at one time Mount of Olives was literally completely covered with olive trees and so as time goes on for various reasons they that there's not that many left there now but you'll see that how many times that Jesus was there and Mount of Olives is is a place there in the dialogue concerning uh the life and and what Jesus uh was speaking in that time and place uh became a place that he was comfortable with the place he liked to go to uh to find Solace and rest and you'll see my brother and sister now as it is in this time that this representation of Israel uh how that God chose to to bring out of a tree a nation and not only a nation a people and we'll see how the scripture often types it as trees and people as an interchangeable thing and we understand also that in the fig and olive tree brother Branham uses them kind of almost interchanged in several places but we understand when that buds again it is a timepiece of God and so we'll see my brother and sister that it has butted and we can see and not in to get into all the politics and all the things tonight but just tying back to what I said earlier we see the very nature of Israel the very nature of the people is they are still longing and pressing into or Desiring the promise that God gave them and so their very actions their very Life as a nation is focused around this position and even as more Israelis as a nation as a people are becoming uh less religious there is a still a position because you look at this and God doesn't say you know when they're in a certain religious position no no he says is when my timepiece when it comes to the time my hundred and forty four thousand will respond to the word and I say thank you Lord because it's not then man watching a clock as it were but it is by Revelation the word of God unfolding before us and to realize that we are also a part of the timepiece amen it is not a watch it's not just a a a a a a a little knob to adjust it in a couple hands but there's many intricate pieces that make up a timepiece and we are a part of that timepiece and I say Lord help us as the bride of Christ amen to to fulfill our portion of the timepiece amen we know God is patient but I want to be one who is ready I wouldn't want God just take this figuratively tonight I wouldn't want God to have to say I'm going to have to hold the second hand back because of Paul come on Paul get your act together I'm holding it back for you I want to be ready can we say amen I want to be on fire I want God to be looking down and saying my son is ready to go my son My bride is ready to go she's anxious she's anxious she's on fire amen and we look at this understanding the the timepiece of the day that we live in you'll see brother Branham refers to uh three minutes till midnight and how he makes that reference and how we must be so much closer today than it was at that time it was three minutes till midnight in our mind my brother and sister three seconds 90 seconds I'm getting myself confused here you see what it is my brother and sister what happens is is as we start looking for this to be fulfilled and we look to that to be fulfilled and we're watching the news saying how does this fit in and what does that fit in what God actually wanted us to do and the prophet called us just live just live the word just get up in the morning and live the word amen don't be running around trying to figure out timing of all of these things and how it is that is there my brother and sister what's happening today is the devil is trying to distract us as it is we've got CNN and whatever all those other things are that are trying to draw our attention away and make us nervous but God wants us to settle down his word was his word amen and we can count on his word coming to pass because he fulfills every single promise he ever gave to his children amen and so as we look at this we see as the prophet of God tells us now I'm paraphrasing and moving through some of this because otherwise we could be here forever but you see the scripture shows us clearly here and brother Branham speaks this that God would never completely forsake Israel not even as a nation Israel is a nation my brother and sister has all kinds of social problems and all kinds of social fads and whatever else but God's even got a promise to them simply as a nation not even just the 144 000 but a nation God has a covenant or a promise to them and so we see that God will never forsake them as a nation here and we see that as we would bless Israel God would bless us and we see how now that Israel Moving Forward under this blessing of God my brother and sister they're still when you're over there and you read some of this historical stuff and you look at through this stuff there is still a shock in the world today from 1967 there's a shock how Israel won The Six Day War they they said they can't figure it out how can this be had we've got to see oh I do you remember it was uh 11 1200 tanks against 140 or something and they defeat them and no one understands why but God's hand is still upon Israel because that promise must be fulfilled now my brother and sister we look at that timepiece or that part of the promise and we look down now and God says I'm going to have a bride she's not going to have a spot not going to have a wrinkle she's going to be in love with me she's going to serve me with all of her heart the word is not going to be on a page or a chiseled into stone it's going to be on their heart it's going to be on the fleshly table and they are going to live this word because they love me now if God declared that in his word must that not to come to pass in the day we live in and I say I believe even tonight it's coming to path God is writing his word not just words my brother and sister but his word amen which is personalized what might be good and the word just for you for your condition of life and the things that would bother you God would write on your heart for that and he would write on my heart brother Trevor whoever's heart he would write these things down a prescription just for you amen because God does not waste his words every word of God has purpose and has meaning and has value and so as we see the olive oil is a representation of the Holy Ghost we'll see my brother and sister the only way that there is olive oil is the fruit of the Olive Tree must be crushed and we won't go into it tonight because I could completely Sidetrack our thoughts but I want you to think about it the fruit of the Olive Tree must be crushed not only is that a representation of our Lord Jesus Christ but is a representation of the events that take place in the world today then it must come to a place that the spirit of God becomes the only thing that Israel and of course we know the scripture says not all that is Israel is Israel so you look at that we must be crushed there must be a pressing in there must be a pressure that is brought to bear to bring forth the oil of the olive but my brother and sister I'm going to just throw this out to you real quick before I move on look what causes us to seek the Holy Ghost it is not lacks living it is not pleasure it is not ease it's in a season of crushing it's in a season of distress it's in a season of hard times that we get down and say Lord forgive us forgive us for our lackadaisical ways or forgive us a little besetting sins these things and we press into it it's in the time of trouble not in a time of ease and God says you know what I'm going to let my church she's going to come right to this face and we're going to type these things here in a minute if you don't mind and just to give a representation but the Holy Ghost has come to us my brother and sister we're no no longer looking in the message I I don't want to be negative but there are some people they're still looking out here this must be and that must be but the prophet of God said that this is just paraphrasing everything we need to make the raptures already in US this is not a matter of going and finding something this is a matter of releasing what's already in US and the Holy Ghost is what is coming and unlocking the doors of our life and releasing these things in our life it is not deep teaching as it were it is not through the sky Revelations that people would come but it is the moving of the Holy Spirit bringing us into a deeper consecration lighting the fire remember it was olive oil that was there and that's where the fire come from they didn't go to find a chunk of wood to stick there it was an oil amen that come down the holy spirit that fed that life and brought light to the believer amen and that's what's happening right here in the hour we are living in you see now in second Corinthians the fourth chapter the tenth verse it says here always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body now this is interesting because depending on what Bible they say they're King James but depending on what Bible bring that oh it is still okay so some Bibles my brother and sister actually say that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so catch that connection of mortality without him there is no eternal life and this flesh is going to this old mortal flesh it's a little different than saying our body God put a time stamp on our flesh and says here it is your flesh this mortal flesh has a season and in that season it will manifest our lord Jesus I was a little self when I read and I you know you have this um and I I actually it's like wow one says mortal flesh one says body and in that I was like which is right but really the reality of is exactly the same thing this body is just mortal amen not looking to make this flesh Supernatural God will use it for Supernatural things and he will manifest the supernatural in us but my brother and sister it's not this flesh that God's redeeming so you look at this now that we bear in our bodies the dying of our Lord Jesus amen that the life of Jesus might be made manifest in my flesh your flesh amen so what is it God's given you the capacity now my brother and sister it's so incredible to me when you look around in the world today and you'll see just in natural people or just in the realm of Believers you'll see such incredible talent that has been given uh to to uh people you'll look out here to take the athlete not in the perverted sense of the world today but just somebody that is so athletic to run and jump and do all of these things that you know they just have such abilities and so they have that ability as it were maybe their lungs or their heart is a little bit bigger and and these kind of things and some can just sing you know I'm amazed when we were in South Africa that there was just these little girls you know I'm always always just amazed when you have a little girl that's got lungs as big as this pulpit you know they can just sing out and I'm like I run out of air and they still just sing and that's a gift God has given them Picture Perfect they know the notes and the highs and the lows and the timing and I Marvel at that and God has given some a memory where literally they can just quote scripture or quotes they can just you know there's a brother back East that that when we were visiting with them a few years ago I was there you know this is Paul I'm sorry I don't want to speak ill I'm not going to claim anything of the devil but you know uh you know I might even have to ask Jerry what's our home phone number I did that yesterday and here's the brother I'm saying you know brother Branham said duh duh and he goes oh that is in the countdown page 19 paragraph 46. and I'm like if you don't mind I'm gonna verify that and it's right that's a gift God's given him there's all these things that God has given us but I tell you my brother and sister there's one thing that God has given to the bride of Christ and that is a capacity to be anointed in this mortal flesh to do the supernatural to be able when we hear the word to know that it is the word and say Amen to the word and it is not something we have to conjure ourselves to but it is in us it's a word speaking and the word responding and that is a gift Supernatural that God has given to you and I I might not be the smartest I might not be able to run the fastest might not be able to remember the whatever but one thing God has given I'll say if you don't mind for a minute just to speak of myself God has given me ability to say Amen to the word of God and I don't need to be the smartest man on the block or the strongest man on the Block but to be able to say Amen to this word and to live this word is a supernatural gift that God has given amen that's a capacity the anointing on this old mortal flesh to do the Supernatural and we tie that right back Christ in you amen it is not Paul it is not Trevor it's not David it's not Alex or whoever it might be it's Christ in us that is speaking back to the word amen I tell you I thank God for that otherwise well I say this jokingly our visitors won't quite understand but I'm a high school dropout amen not proud of it but I'm not ashamed of it either but I'll tell you what when I was in school brother sister all I could do is sit there and look out the window and wonder why do they have us trapped inside of here all I wanted was out and I got out but one thing I know now whatever steps I have walked in my life God chose to bring me face to face with the word diploma won't matter a master is a PhD none of that will matter but the grace of God that he has poured into us hallelujah amen and you know what look at this life it cannot be made manifest without the Holy Ghost it's just that simple we can be religious we can go to church we can have a faithful faithful attendance record but without the Holy Ghost it will not be manifested to the degree that God desires and can we see what this means to us it means this old mortal flesh that we're looking and criticizing and we see as a failure has become a house of the greatest power that has ever come on the earth it is a home as it were to the Holy Spirit and moving forward to do the greatest thing that has taken place since our Lord Jesus Christ and it's taking the world that we live in and purging it and bringing forth the word in a manifestation in mortal flesh oh it would be something if God just brought down Supernatural men and women and they were just perfect and then God put the word in that but God said I'm not worried about that I have got the answer to the devil's question and I can take mortal flesh and anointed to believe the word to act on the word to manifest the word and you say oh brother Paul where are you going we'll be there in a minute amen I'm telling you my brother and sister that we just have to acknowledge this is incredible this is incredible what God has done he's taken just common old people all over the Earth common old people now I don't speak ill of this but I want you to understand this in South Africa I dealt with brothers that I kind of almost wondered if they probably could even write their name but I tell you what at the preaching of the word they had already recognized their name was written in heaven amen they might not have been so bright as it were in intellectual eyes or whatever on the Earth today but those men when they heard the word preached you were right there to see them yes yes yes yes that's me praise the Lord amen amen which would we want to be oh my tell me it's not Incredible God brought us right out put his word in US now let's look into the tree but let's not forget the spiritual side here for just a few minutes if you don't mind the Olive Tree a lot of this I garnered from our guide yair and he shared you know I asked him hey what about this what about that it was interesting remember in the biblical Garden the Olive Tree they weren't sure how old those trees were but they acknowledged they were quite old there and you know with age the Olive Tree does not get pretty it actually kind of gets a little bit ugly and around the base of the tree above the root Crown around the base of the tree it starts putting out all these almost seemed like maybe there was some kind of pathogen or mold and the tree was responding and it has all these nodules and all these bulges that was out there that are there's nothing pretty about them but when we were talking to him he says this is a mature tree and it puts those uh that growth out like that and it's actually a water tank what that tree has come into maturity in that tree now has put on this growth and when there's sufficient water it draws this water in and stores it then anybody find a scripture that God says he's going to have pretty Christians but he's going to have strong enduring Christians he's going to have sons and daughters of God that can survive in the good times and in the bad they can survive when the the spirit of God is moving in plenty then survive when things seem to be dry and we say but but you know I wonder about this family or that family or that church seems like there may be a little dry well my brother and sister God has placed in them the ability to wither uh whether the the drought hey man they're not gonna dry up and blow away God has given to them the ability and so you see that in this this tree has been made by God to be able to survive an extended drought and I hope you don't mind because this could be a little confusing the bride of Christ here in the world I'll just put it the world not even narrow it down or maybe I shouldn't be rude to all the rest of the world we'll just call it the United States did you realize bride we're in a drought um amen you just walk out here go down the streets go to the shopping mall the grocery store everywhere you'll see we are in a drought you see it's not just that the spirit of God is laying around everywhere but the bride of Christ right the prophet of God talked about storing it in a storehouse tying back to Joseph soaring in a sore house you realize that the very holy spirit that we long and cry for and we are blessed to have is being stored up as it were inside of you and I and it's not the world's idea of a Christian it's not some people's idea of what is a Christian but God said I will place in you everything you need to make the Rapture that doesn't come into a Time When sin and wickedness is on every corner you can't look up down sideways without seeing wickedness my brother and sister God's got a Reservoir in the bride of Christ that will carry her through all I can say is thank you Lord amen and did you know that you can burn an olive tree until it looks completely destroyed and if the rains come in the right season it will produce a sprig and will grow an entirely new tree on top of that one the devil tries to throw things that Scorch us that burns us and hurts us and seemingly is destroyed I'm telling you I've shared this with the church my brother and sister but we're seeing God move and people away from the message for 30 and 40 years are coming back and coming to the Altar and for asking forgiveness they have been burned by every spirit in every condition there is in laodicea from homosexuality to whatever else you might want to name they've been burned by that but God brings them in the water of the word touches their life and a new sprig comes out of that and God restores not a sprig or a limb but a whole new tree a whole new creature in Christ Jesus a whole new creation amen and so you can burn the Olive Tree but with a moisture it will still live I thought this was interesting when yair told us that you can tear a limb off of an olive tree you can throw it out in the road where there's not one drop of moisture one drop of soil and it will lay there for days and weeks until it looks like nothing but a dry stick but you take that dry stick and you plant it in fertile soil and give it some water and it comes back to life oh my brother and sister I tell you there's I think every one of us has went through times in our life amen our young people are just in an onslaught of this world right now where Satan's just trying to just bring them where they're just a dry stick laying on the side of the road and people look at it and say well I guess they weren't believers they look at themselves and say yes I wasn't a Believer but God comes and takes them and brings them over into the fertile soil of the word and plants them again and the water of the word comes and starts to touch their life and something down inside comes to life and they say I don't want to die I don't belong to laodicea I want to live and God Waters that and brings forth a whole tree Hallelujah I think that's so wonderful when you look at this these are things my brother and sister than a man who is not even a believer in the New Testament can share because it's truth it's reality in the harshness of times the Olive Tree will produce very little fruit foreign Good Times it will produce an abundance of fruit in the good time yes I'll praise your name in the bad times I'll do the same and God built that into the tree nobody had to go out there and say now you're an olive tree and we need you at least in the drought times to at least put on a couple olives and in the Good Times Union branches need to just hang so heavy so this is what we want you to do no this is in it this is the nature God put in the olive tree and the olive tree doesn't need someone to go out there and say you can do it you can do it it does it Hallelujah and when God placed that seed Gene in you and I before the foundation of the world he doesn't have to say well I hope that that will produce I hope that will do what I wanted to do he knows it will now we as humans sometimes we need some encouragement don't we we need somebody to Pat us on the back in the hard times and say brother sister you can do it we're praying for you my brother and sister but there has to be something down inside that man or that woman to say I can't give up I've got to serve God I've got to oh the Cyrene song the world is saying come come look how beautiful we are well I'll tell you my brother and sister this will sound harsh and forgive me but I'm telling you I wonder if all those beautiful women are so beautiful if they take all the remnant of laodicea off of them why because the prophet and the word shows us clearly that beauty is in character now look in the ages my brother and sister in all the ages character has been important but there's never been an emphasis in the word of God about character like there has been in this final Church age in this time God has placed such a significance on character why because we're living in a world that is bankrupt and God said one of the separations is going to be is in this time when it's about oh I can do this and I'm that and I'm pretty have you ever seen the time I'm let me just put it this way I'm not that old I'm still a young man don't you be laughing if when I was 18 you'd have saw somebody with one of them square box Kodak cameras holding that thing out we to hold them off and committed them but look at the world we live in now everywhere now if you do that I'm not judging you but everywhere we look in the world self and then it's funny about the Selfies oh let's do a selfie together click let me see it well I really don't want to show you let me see it I'm not in the picture they're standing right there with somebody and they just selfied themself what is the spirit of laodicea itself self self-indulgent self-pleasing self-fulfilling my brother and sister selfish and so we see how this Spirit of the age is having this impact or effect on people and it's there my brother and sister that this world we're living in right now God says you know what I've anointed you to produce fruit no matter where you're at I don't care whether you are rich or poor whether you live in a fluent country or a fluent city or a fluent neighborhood or whether you on the back streets my brother and sister I'm telling you this reminded us of Chile actually a lot and that we're there in South Africa and and it's amazing it really is truly amazing they have a law there that if somebody has a house regardless of what it is how they have to provide electricity to them and so right on the shoulders of the freeway for going forever and ever and ever they have built all these little Shanty houses and trust me I'm not being derogatory that's just what they are they're pallets and tin and they have all these power lines running everywhere and you know one of these days that thing's probably gonna all those things gonna burn down because just somebody shorts something out now you look at that my brother and sister there are believers in that condition talking naturally and we have two and three cars live in a nice home does that make any difference no sir because that anointed word that Supernatural that come down into their soul is the exact same Supernatural that has come down into our soul amen we think well God would surely drag him out of their poverty no somebody's got to live in that neighborhood to spread the gospel I wonder if maybe they don't have more character than we do that sounded judgmental didn't it you see there's a supernatural anointing that anoints the promise that God said I'll keep you amen the work I began in you amen my brother and sister it's not as though God just spoke that across Humanity that promise has rooted right down in our heart and the Holy Spirit has come right into our heart to come and fulfill that I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you that's not something we should have to go to church to hear to believe that should resonate in the heart of Sons and Daughters of God that we would say this is God's word after all nobody has to tell the Olive Tree it's raining you should drink in question answered in Hebrews part two 1957. now brother Brian was referencing just so people won't say now you're confused on your trees because you'll see that brother Brown includes all other trees in there listen he said the Generation seed the Fig Tree putting forth its buds now watch he said the Fig Tree all the other trees now in other words they'd be a universal Revival at that time now watch this prophecy how it works in and just Blends in perfect now watch all other trees putting forth their buds Reviving now I want you if you if you care enough or you want to do to go read this because you'll find brother Brown making references to Billy Graham and other Ministries amen in fact in fact brother Branham I believe it's in this quote says that uh brother Neville was a way better preacher than Billy Graham you talk about giving somebody a compliment my the world just revers Billy Graham is a great preacher and brother Brown's like brother Neville's better than he is hmm too bad sister April ain't here tonight there'd be a universal Revival at that time now watch this prophecy how it works in and just Blends in perfectly now watch all other trees putting forth their buds Reviving a tree when it's putting forth its buds is Reviving is that right now anyone knows a prophetic teacher that the fig tree has always been the Jew and we know that and it's the Jew now and look at Joel when he come took it over he said what the Palmer worm left the caterpillar eat and what the caterpillar laughed the locusts eat and what the locusts eat if you notice that's the very same insect in different stages the Palmer worm the caterpillar the locus all the same bug just different stages of its life now watch that same bug begin to eat on that Jewish tree back there and cut it down and it began to eat and eat and eat and to eat till it took it to a stump are you following this are you following this you see God had to bring it I'm gonna get ahead of myself but God had to bring it to the place of the season of the grafting you don't go out there with a tree that's got all its Limbs and all its foliage and and cut it and try and graft another limb into just be another limb of the deal my brother and sister God let all of these Spirits chew that down till it was a stump and then he said I will restore saith the Lord all the years that the caterpillar eat of I'll make my people a joy see now the tree has been eaten down the Gentiles was grafted into it that's true all right we must bring fruit why we just read this scripture where the life is in the root amen so it's not for us to say well I was expecting something different God grafted us into the life amen I'm so glad today he grafted us he took us out of Mormonism and Catholicism and Jehovah Witnesses and he took us out of all of these things of our life bar rooms and whatever it might have been he took us all of that and grafted us into life I'll tell you what it makes my heart amen I never was in all of those things but I tell you what I certainly qualified as a sinner and God said you know what I'm going to graft you Paul right into the life and that life is not going to go oh you're not a Jew you're not a Jew no sir it said here's something Desiring life and it's ordained to life because see I learned a lot of years ago with friends in the orchard business that there is actually a technique some men rafting trees just believe that you can cut in to the tree Slide the Graft in and it'll just be fine other men look at that same stump and say The graft needs to go here for one reason they do is if you have a stump that's got a primary limb coming out and you graft it in on the low side you're going to have a limb that's going to be weak won't be able to stand the load of its own fruit and ultimately will break out of the graft and collapse so you need to position the Graft in the right place and God said I know right where to graft you in I got a revealed word that's rooted deep in my word and I'm going to graft you into that revealed word where you can stand as Sons and Daughters of God not falling down not giving up not weak not bearing any fruit but grafted it's right into the right place that the word coming and the Life coming from the root and we could just turn and grow and look to the rising of the Sun and produce much fruit in the day that we live in oh I tell you what my brother and sister it just makes my heart amen Oh we must bring fruit now look I never wanted to cherry pick these things so certainly you can look and make these notes I was afraid I wouldn't have enough to preach tonight you know it's just terrible look at this Olive Tree completely shredded down to nothing seemingly completely finished put forth a shoot and grow a whole new tree on top of that remember when brother Branham was with the brothers down there in Arizona they're talking about grafting and brother Brown's like so now let me get this right if you grasped graph a a grapefruit into this tree when it next year it will produce an orange seems reasonable wouldn't it the life is coming from an orange tree but it gets a lesson that turns into you might say collaboration with the word coordinating and he comes and is able to tell us and show us the life that's in it will produce well the Olive Tree is representation of Jews of Israel but he grafted us into it and it's the life it's the life it's not who we are it's not who we think we are just as we'd say oh I've got the Lord no my brother and sister he's got us because the life is in the root amen and so God Has Come grafted you and I into this amen we the wild the wild come on some of us have to look back in our life and we the wild we really understand that I read that and I'm like Oh my how that hits home we the wild have been grafted into the team we of the nether nature were grafted into it and now we are not creatures of laodicea but we're creatures we're the manifestation of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah I don't know I don't think iPads have pages so to speak or at least this document doesn't but I think I've got my point across sister Ruth will you come amen now you look at this now one more quote I pulled that one on you didn't I I didn't mean to but I just looked down and I saw this because now we see the prophet of God talking 1957 there's 144 000 there's your servants so the children of the kingdom here dear person who asked the question who asked this notable question I think I might have left it back here in somewhere but when they shall be cast out doesn't mean that they will be cast out of God's mind they are cast out of the spiritual benefit for the season well I'll tell you what we saw that in Israel and I don't mean to be rude or crude I probably shared it with most of you but we sit right there and at the Dead Sea at the table and you'll see a couple there and the the lady putting her kids down and the man getting up and he's dressed correctly and he's reading the pages as he's doing everything correctly but my brother and sister you look over there and here's a man doing all these religious things but here's his wife dressed not no no lady should be in public dressed like this so here he is ultra religious right here but it's not being reflected and so God took these spiritual blessings from them for the season to understand who and what they should be in the word has been gone for a season but he's not to keep it from them see for just a little season because when the prophet saw Israel on the day that she was coming to he said well Israel will be when the Sabbath will be taken away and they shall sell on the Sabbath the same as any other day and that's right now in Israel they'll tell you right off you ask them a question now how does this work with the Sabbath uh well we're Jews we believe all this but it's the ultra-orthodox that are worried about all of that see they have an identity that we are Jews we believe just as much as they do but that's their thing 1957 2000 and while we were there in 22 but 2022 this has come to pass in Israel very little regard very very little regard I think if we dug through the message dug through the Bible dug through the message it would probably shock us at the amount of things that the prophet said it'll be like this one day and it's that way right now I believe it would just shock us and I would say that to put fear in anyone but I think it would shock us amen so it's there we see all these things he says well will Israel be completely forgotten and he said how high is it to the heaven how deep is the earth measure with that stick laying before you said I can't you see neither can I forget Israel certainly not Israel will never be forgotten so you see Everlasting and eternal is two different things Israel was cast out but not out of God's mind Paul speaks it over here if I had time to study I could quickly get to the scripture and refer them to you see what comes to my mind and uh we'll finish the quote right here Paul speaking over there said that for we Gentiles to take heed the way we walked and what we've done and we should as message Believers we need to still take heed it is not an absolute go Pasco collect 200 and actually God's called us to a higher consecration a higher dedication a higher Devotion to the word a higher standard amen amen begin grafting in in Israel which was blinded for a season he said just for a season Israel was blinded that's right but the veil will be lifted from their eye and that is when the last Gentile is born in the kingdom of God then their veils lifted from Israel's eyes and they'll say this is the Messiah who we look to see that's right but the Gentile door is closed the ark is closed up there's no more no more grace left for the Gentile that's got to be close my brother and sister look people say you know when brother Branham said he believed the coming of the Lord was nigh could even be tomorrow I've heard people make statements like well that was just a figure of speech I don't believe so I believe the prophet of God living in the world as it were that he was seeing what God granted him to see believed it had to be right there and I tell you what I just uh the The church here our brothers and sisters we've just been talking about this and I just want to get more on fire for the Lord and I want my plea for I don't believe in resolutions but I want my plea for 2023 just a closer walk with the Lord because my brother and sister this is going to come to pass there's not a doubt it will come to pass and I say Lord I'm going to be ready I am going to be ready Hallelujah we love the Lord tonight Hallelujah I hope I didn't get to carried away I've still got a bunch of other little things to share here but I will keep moving along amen let's just stand and sing a couple songs before we dismiss amen I stand I stand In Awe and I do truly Saints as we were blessed so many different things in Israel that the Lord just opened our eyes to see oh my this is not at all like I thought it was right and God opened our eyes and then when my eyes is open to what the real reality of it is and then I go back and I read the scripture I've just got all kinds of things just flying off the page at me and I'm just like wow Lord let it just be so let it be thus let the message be that way let our whole Bible be that way that it just flies off the page to us stirring our hearts Hallelujah let's just start with the first second verse brother Gideon oh I stand and I stand in all of you I stand and I stand in all of you holy God to whom all my Praises do I Stay standing all of you let's sing that again my stand I stand in all of you I Strength [Music] all too oh my Praises do I stand in all of you I'll sing

foreign [Music] foreign [Music] be foreign [Music] my heart Lord give Glory can we just lift our hands and say thank you Lord thank you Lord for grafting me in to the body of Christ grafting me Lord

closer and all we can say is thank you Lord for predestination thank you Lord for choosing thank you Lord and you didn't graft me in father in the wrong place but you grafted us right into your word right into your very life we lift our hands tonight to say Thank you Lord and father as the prophet said we must produce fruit that is our heart's desire Lord Jesus we've been grafted to your word to the message of the hour now Lord let us produce fruit father not the fruit of man but the fruit of the supernatural word that has come in ordained we thank you Lord we bless your holy name Lord bless each one I pray bless our visitors father just touch us let the word Lord be more real to us each and every day Lord we thank you we claim these promises Lord Israel lives on 17 percent of their
