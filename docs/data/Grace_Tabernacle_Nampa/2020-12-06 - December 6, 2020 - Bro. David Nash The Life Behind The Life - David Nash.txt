to announce activities um just as it would be the other day they had uh a christmas party i guess you would call it for the youth and sister yulia hosted a uh a similar party for the you know for the

children amen we live in a world that we can say well it's just terrible out there what are we going to do well what we're going to do is what the word told us to do and we're going to train up our children in the ways of the lord we're going to be examples to them encouragement to them and try to do our very best and you know we want to give our very best we don't want to give a half-hearted effort we want to give our best to the things of god and we know that the scripture says he's a rewarder of them who diligently seek him so i say on behalf of our children let's seek him on behalf of our teenagers seek him on behalf of each and every one that's a part of this body of believers around the world not just here at grace but around the world let's be diligent so god bless you today and so as we move forward parents with younger children please respond if you would to the invitation to join grace kids god bless you man praise the lord bless you all this morning every time i go to sing a song i lose my voice and i have no idea why i'm gonna say it's nerves [Music] but um this past week and i um just some things that are happening in the well the message ranks i guess you could say and some people that i know um [Music] have some bad things to say about what we believe and just been pondering upon this and uh you know once i was clothed in rags of sin but then i met a savior i don't follow this this message because brother branham saw visions or he had great miracle healings i follow this message because i found christ [Music] and until they show me christ somewhere else here i'll stay and so uh the lord laid this song on my heart last night because i believe that i'm a child of the king amen once i was cloned in the rags of my sin oh wretched and poor lost and lonely within but with one risk compassion the king of all kings pity and great love took me under his wings oh yes oh yes i'm a child of the king his royal blood now flows through my veins and i who was wretched and poor now can sing praise god praise god i'm a child of the king where now i'm a child with a heavenly home my holy father has made me his own and i'm washed by his blood and clothed in his love and someday i'll sing with the angels above oh yes oh yes i'm a child of the king oh his royal blood now flows through my beard and i who was wretched and poor now can sing praise god praise god i'm a child of the king oh yes oh yes i'm a child of the king his royal blood now flows through my veins and i who was wretched and poor now can sing praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god i'm a child of the key [Music] amen praise god we are the child children of the king amen thank you lord as we get ready to turn the service to brother david let's sing number 315 something beautiful something good something beautiful [Music] he understood all i had to offer him was brokenness and strife [Music] all my confusion he understood all i had to offer him was brokenness and right he made something beautiful of mine seen again his brother david come oh yes [Music] oh understood all i had to offer him was brokenness and strife he made something beautiful of my life [Music] he understood all i had to offer him [Music] brokenness and strife made something [Music] praise the lord are you glad to be here this morning i'm glad to be here y'all pray for me i haven't y'all i just got back from texas okay i'm sorry but uh we haven't preached for a few weeks i hope we remember how brother praise the lord thank you but uh really glad to be here thank you brother paul for the invitation to stand for the gospel in jesus christ could we sing a song before we get started the sister was playing it before service and i had heard it in spanish last march i'm not going to try to sing it in spanish but it was a tiny simple stable you know that yeah i love that song let's just stand and sing it to the lord [Music] and because the word is to be born within us [Music] hardly a place for a king to be born and take something special to reveal his majesty so i know if i'll give him control he'll be born in me hallelujah your word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it start and inside this house of clay mold it every day let your word be born in the manger of my heart praise the lord well outwardly i'm nothing not much to behold godly the place for his word to unfold but if i just yield this vessel and let him have his way from glory unto glory he'll leave me day by day your word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it start live inside this house of clay then build me every day let your word be born in the manger of my heart just once more on that chorus let your word be born [Music] live inside this house of clay hallelujah hold me every day let your word be born in the manger of my heart oh let your word be born in the manger heavenly father we come to you this morning you've heard that as a prayer the people here this morning there's many here that we know and we've had fellowship with along the trail some faces i don't know father but you know who they are you knew them before there was a life before there was any kind of life on earth you knew their hearts you knew their thoughts you're the infinite god and now they're crying back to you let that word be born in my heart so be it that way lord according to your word he said that wherever two or three are gathered you promise to be here and you are the word of god so we're looking at that promise this morning to be fulfilled in our hearts and lives in the name of jesus christ praise the lord amen not to keep you standing let's go ahead and turn as it were uh trevor carey sister subra lord bless you one of these days you're coming back to try city's brother okay that's he thinks he's getting away with you know i'm not sure what but praise the lord let's turn to first samuel chapter 16. and we spoken on this i know several different times that the lord every scripture has compound meaning and compound revelation and a lot of times you know you'll get going along a certain path and we're just revealing revealing revealing and then pretty soon you come back and you look at it again and go well wow there's another whole dimension here and you know and you think about it and we're three-part human beings you know i have a fleshly part and you hit it i don't like it or you poke it or whatever and but then there's a spirit part that that you know you get in the presence of the lord you begin to feel the spirit and pain doesn't mean so much and and then but even beyond that there's a soul and even in that soul there's yet realms within that soul that because the soul is the nature of the spirit and there's many things that are uh put forth from the soul into the spirit uh you know some people say well you shouldn't be angry but yet the scripture says be angry and sin not so you go well but yet there's other places where he says well turn the other cheek so but all those things are within the soul of the word that's within us so we'll approach this these scriptures this morning i would like to title it if i could the life behind the life praise the lord brother first samuel chapter 16 first verse and the lord said unto samuel how long wilt thou mourn for saul seeing i have rejected him from reigning over israel fill i hold with oil and go and i will send thee to jesse the bethlehem for i have provided me a king among his sons and it will drop down to i think it's verse 11 and samuel said unto jesse here are all thy children and he said thou remainest yet the youngest and behold he keeps the sheep and samuel said unto jesse send and fit him for we will not sit down till he come hither and he sent and brought him in and now he was ready and with all of the beautiful countenance and a goodly to look upon and the lord said arise anoint him for this is he then samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the spirit of the lord came upon david from that day forward so samuel rose up and went to rhema and then in second chronicles of the 11th chapter and just the third verse there i think it is 11 chapters that well first chronicles i'm sorry first chronicles chapter 11. i got as we were just talking i've got notes on top of notes brother willie so first chronicles chapter 11. and just the third verse and it says therefore came all the elders of israel to the king to the king to hebron and david made a covenant with them in hebrew before the lord and the anointed david king over israel according to the word of the lord by samuel amen gracious heavenly father we thank you this morning for your word and for some reason i'd be a little nervous but lord jesus now knowest take this man take these words take this congregation and fill them with your holy spirit and provide unto them the bread of life jesus christ manifest heart to heart from you to them through the words spoken today and above all things may it when it be done and the time as it were be that we should walk away may all be said and done for the lord jesus christ in whose name we come amen praise the lord be seated now we've been through a lot of struggles and a lot of times that we're in right now seems like the you know we had a prophet tell us years ago that the whole world would be crazy go crazy i think we're there i really do i don't know you know i suppose they could get a little more crazy but i also remember a friend of mine that worked at a insane asylum and you know when they had some very morbid type things i mean people would kill people because there was crazy people in there and occasionally one person you know he said the ones that were really scary were the psycho ward because 99.9 percent of the time they're normal but it's that other one-tenth that one percent that when they flip out they could kill two or three people with their bare hands because they have many devils and uh so they told them when they during the training that the the best pla the best way to subdue a crazy person is to act more crazy than they do and he said it really works he didn't believe it but he saw a case where a man that was possessed and there was a bunch of guys sitting around watching a television and somebody changed the channel and one guy got mad and he said it was a big tv up high and he said the guy walked over and took the tv and he was gonna drop it or made me may have dropped it on this guy i don't remember exactly the story and he said he picked that he said i weighed hundreds of pounds he said he just picked it up and you know and everybody's you know scattered and everything and uh he said the guy that was working in the ward when he saw what was happening he ran into the midst of the guys jumped up on the table and started acting like a monkey and he said the guy was he didn't drop it yet because he was looking at him like this with the tv and he dropped it and he pointed to the guy and goes that guy's crazy so so get crazy in the lord okay [Laughter] that's the point here and i think about you know all the what they call mandates they're not laws they're mandates and all the things they got going on in all these different states and the way we see you know it looks like the destruction of the united states which we do it's gotta end sometime but as it does let's us go into the kingdom of god and i think about uh somebody was saying you know in washington they're a lot more strict than idaho praise the lord for idaho but uh they said you know this mandate we have to do this you have to do all this things that you're supposed to do over there and somebody said well the latest one they didn't want you to sing in church i sat there and i thought about that well they want me to wear a mask i got one here somewhere i'm not sure you know what they want me to do that you want me to stand six feet from you well i can do that that's okay but not saying in church i found over 33 versus just looking up singing just looking up singing and not you know worship where it says to sing in church and now maybe it's a little crazy but i'm not even be gonna be careful how i answer you and you look at the children you know shadrach meshach and abednego and it looked crazy because they said bow when you hear the music well and everybody else was bowed and they said we're not even going to be careful about this we know god's able to deliver me from this and whether he does or not that's his business but i ain't gonna bow in fact i'm gonna sing louder hallelujah and if you don't like it well have a nice day but that's just how i feel about it because that's the word of god and that's a life in me behind this life that you see you know praying with the brother there before service and uh you know he's he's saying lord forgive us of our sins when we think about this out guy he was born in sin shaped in iniquity came into the world speaking lies he didn't get born again the outside is not why i got born again while gorna got born again is the guy right here and as we yield to the life behind the life that's when this life starts acting like when it's the life that it's supposed to act like so as we look at these scriptures this morning i'm already getting this thing praise the lord but as we think about this when we look at these scriptures how that saul had been reigning in israel and it was the people's choice really that had brought saul to the forefront he was a head taller than everybody he was the looked like quite big shot he was quite quite the guy and you know he had some good points and things he did for israel that were okay but he had a few things the life behind the life that was in saul never really lined up you find that saul you know in one place he went down and he was supposed to kill everything and when samuel goes to see him saul said well i did everything you said and he says what's the lowing of the sheep well we need that for sacrifice to the lord well obedience is better than sacrifice and and he he said disobedience is a sin of witchcraft and so you see that the life that was in saul he was a godly man i suppose in fact he even spent some time with the prophets it said that how he went down and they said is saul now among the prophets so he knew about the anointing and he knew how to yield to the anointing he'd even you know done the things that he did but there's also a scripture when it talks about that point where it says that saul turned his back on samuel after he was anointed he turned his back on samuel i don't know who's saying the special but there are people that are turning their back on the word of the hour they can still be anointed they can still do all kinds of things god doesn't remove the anointing but once you leave that it becomes a sin of witchcraft i'm just telling you what the scripture says you know and and because of that saul suffered bitterly and we know how he got many devils upon him still anointed king and so so much anointed king that when david had the opportunity to slay him and even his friends are going kill him david he goes no man he's anointed of the lord and so because there was a life that was in david behind the life that matched with the word of his hour and the word of his day so let's look at that there in chapter 16 a little more closely so we the first thing we find is the word of the lord comes to samuel when we know this because it says the lord says unto samuel so god is speaking words to samuel so it's the word of god coming to samuel samuel is the first prophet i believe in the scripture where it says when he was called that it says uh that the word of the lord was revealed in shiloh to samuel so it's a revelation of the word and what that word is to bring forth and so that word of the lord is coming out of samuel and he begins to speak things concerning saul how do you say that sometimes the word of the lord is not always what we think of the will of the lord but he waits for us to see or he waits to see our reaction to the word to determine what the future of the word is because now samuel was he was a prophet he was anointed with the word of the lord and he's been interceding for saul that's the word of the lord we should intercede for people as the bride of jesus christ when we think of the spirit of the judgment well the judge is there to pardon the those that need pardoned and to condemn those that need to be condemned and we think well sometimes the things going on you you know there's a part of me that says you want to go to hell go ahead that's your business but there's another part that says lord don't they're blind they don't know what they're doing and so here was samuel and he'd been interceding for saul interceding finally the word of the lord comes to see okay samuel i appreciate what you've been doing and i understand but he says how long are you going to mourn for him how long are you going to intercede for this he goes i'm done with him that was the word of the lord and so he tells him you know go fill your horn with oil and i'm going to send thee to jesse the bethlehemite where does he send him where does the word send samuel who is the word of the lord for his day he sends him to bethlehem the house of god's bread because the word of the lord now is about to change how the bread is administered he's taking on a new form or a new life behind the life he's been on king saul as an anointing but the heart or the life behind the life didn't matter it was a life that was not in conjunction with what god desired and yet you had to see a samuel that was sitting there interceding in interceding interceding and god says that's enough i'm done with saul reigning over israel and what does he say she goes i'm going to send you to bethlehem the house of god's bread and watch the next line for i have provided me god himself the word of god is going to be proclaimed himself as king among his sons i provided me the word is providing himself to be our king it's not wrapped up in churches pastors or whatever you want to call it we're only here as part of him reigning as king in human beings praise the lord yeah i need nuance it's okay but it's god is providing himself a king and he's using the word of the hour samuel to provide it from the house of god's bread now what's going on here well we go to john the first chapter it says in the beginning was the word word was with god word was god and we you know you dropped down word became flesh where did it happen bethlehem so what is the life behind the life of the word in this space god is taking the throne right here because the word is sending the word to bethlehem amen where he will find the king amen where god will proclaim himself king so saul gets up in fact he complains about it he has tried he had trials too and so but he i can't go there they'll kill me well just go tell him you're coming for sacrifice and so samuel is obedient to the word and he goes and we know the story with the different brothers came through and nope nope nope nope nope and there's no more well yeah there's one more he's out with the sheep well go get him you know hey a couple of these brothers two or three of these brothers are captains in saul's army and they're probably thinking it's me i get to be next king no you know but they go get david and when david comes in they're all just looking at him you know he's been out with a sheep you know nobody washed his feet he probably was the foot what's up funky then you know and here he comes in and god says that's the one now what's happening it says he was ready and how did it say about that he was ready and had a beautiful countless countenance and got goodly to look upon so he comes in and he's not much to look at but he's got his countenance there's something about him that's different he's the youngest this you people with more than one child does the older one ever pick on the younger ones so he's got seven brothers going hey kid you know whatever you know everybody's house is a little different i'm sure they were just nice little soldiers and never treated david badly but and so they're looking at him come in and they're going yeah you got to be kidding i mean they're human beings you got our little brother but yet when samuel took the oil and he and he anoints what was happening he was he was humble he had been humbled by his brethren and he was the most humble and he comes in and the anointing falls upon him as king amen but who was making himself king god the life behind the life the life behind the word behind the prophet is coming now through the anointing oil onto the most humble of all the brothers what's he doing the bible said jesus christ would come humbly he would be the most humble of all men upon the earth and here he comes in in you know natural life form and the brothers are doing that what was happening he said the bible says he would be rejected he would be despised his you don't think they despised him when they were down at the battle before goliath came along and when david goes down there he's going down there to feed him where did he get the bread from bethlehem and his dad said you know the father says go down feed your brethren and when he goes from bethlehem just feed his brethren what do they say david get out of here get out of here troublemaker what was it it was god showing himself as king he would be rejected of his own brethren it was god showing the nature of the king of kings in a humble shepherd boy why a shepherd boy who's the chief shepherd amen right that's right god is the chief shepherd after he was anointed the next day was david up the head of the army with the shepherd's staff no he was right back out in the field protecting the sheep amen what was it god showing himself to be king and a humble shepherd boy god said i'm anointing me a king me god wants to be the king and this is what i'm going to look like that's the life behind the life [Music] i don't think david really knew you know i'm i'm walking out and i'm i'm making a type and a shadow for the messiah i doubt if he knew that maybe but i don't find it written in the word that way but we think as it goes on and how that you know and i know we've talked about this before and when goliath came out and you know all the other his brothers and the whole army of israel saul included an anointed king all inclusive and when goliath steps up what do they do oh man this is not a good deal you know and they're all hiding but david what's he do he jumps up on the rock and says who is that uncircumcised philistine what was that that's it it's the life behind the life it didn't matter what enemy stood before it's god showing himself as king showing himself as the mighty warrior i don't care satan who you are i'll not even be careful how i answer you goliath glasses i'll feed you the birds really i'm going to cut your head off and what was that god showing himself as the prophet because god is speaking through that king that that little shepherd boy king i'm gonna cut your head off and he did it amen god is the prophet jehovah prophet jehovah king jehovah or banner jehovah our warrior amen all in the life of a shepherd boy the life behind the life well we know there's other things that happen and how that you know you think about sin or unbelief as brother branham told us in his unbelief and it's unbelief in the word of god but we think about you know watching the life of the king the king in the king and how that he got scared david got scared when an anointed king cast his javelin to kill him david said it's time to go i'm not going to hang around here any longer and he left the king of israel and all his armies and fled to the wilderness where did jesus go when he was feeling like he was signed to god lord i need a break he would go to the wilderness so what's the life behind the life david said i got to get out of here this is too much and so he fled fleeced to the wilderness but even when he's in the wilderness i think last time we were here we preached about the sword that the priest gave him the bible said he was a man after god's own heart when that priest gave him that sword what was it it was hidden behind the ephod and it's what does the sword represent the word of god where is it where is it hidden behind the ephod of this skin amen brother sister the kingdom of god is where up there that's not what the bible says he said it's within you liable to get i have to get going on another message if i'm not careful right here but and so he flees into the wilderness he receives that sword while he's in the wilderness uh from the high priest who's the high priest of our confession christ who's the word of god who received the word of god from behind the ephod that is over the heart of the priest and so we see it's god declaring himself in different types and shadows you could break i know you brothers can break this out in different all different forms of types and shadows and even uh i know brother branham one time was talking about types he said well there's the type the ant i type the ante type and the type of the type so and sometimes they're right over the top of each other and you have to kind of sort through the words to go ah i see that there but write it that word it changes to this other thing and because it's a life behind the life and we know that the whole army of israel went out a bit against david he's fleeing he doesn't want to go through with what this thing is and he flees from saul and he goes and hides in the wilderness and saul compasses him about by the cave and now this time it's david that's afraid and sometimes we are you know there's that scripture in ecclesiastes a time to do this a time to do that a time to this time to that sometimes we're to stand up boldly say i'm not even going to be careful and the next time you see david coming out of the cave very carefully how he's walking because he doesn't want to disturb those guys or he's dead and that's the life behind the life is knowing how to rightly divide the truth for our lives you as individuals i can't live your life for you you live different places you have different jobs you do different stuff everything's different but you and your relationship with jesus christ that's why it's not can't be a church relationship amen i have no way i could lead this church because every single one of you is different from a different background you're from a different some of you are from different cultures different languages all kinds of everything's different but each one of you are to have a relationship from bethlehem with the king amen and gain the life behind the life and i've seen brothers before and how they argue over certain things and i'm sitting there going man these guys are they're getting really hot about this and at one point i realized you know what they're both right they are both completely right but one is speaking of that as a natural term and the other one is speaking of the type and shadow and they're both and here they're fighting over the same words well it's the life behind the life and so one case david stands up boldly the next case he's walking very carefully and what is that you say well looks like unbelief why didn't he just stand up and okay saul i'm gonna fight you it wasn't the time he even told the guy not now it's not the right time so we have to recognize you know brother brown and preach that wonderful message recognizing your day and its message it's easy to look out there and say well we know what day we're living in we're living right at the edge you know right of things going down being done with that's what age we're living in but there's a message with this age and it's not just a message of 1200 tapes and books and whatever it's a life behind the message it's what life are you living that's right from that message what kind of life is that putting in you and it's easy to criticize oh bro i mean that brother got so mad at him what's the matter with that brother can he be more forgiving and that brother might be looking at you are you crazy do you know what that guy just did it's a different life my feet are not called to do what my ears do they're just not called to that now if i lost part of an ear you could take maybe some of the skin off the bottom and sew it on there and you know sure look funny but it might work but it has a different calling and each one of you as individuals has a different calling you have something god has for you to do and i find myself a lot of times going to the lord what's my part in this and what you know am i supposed to stand up like david before goliath or am i just supposed to sneak out of here you know with nobody even knowing i always joke with brother george smith because he tells me how do you get away with some of this stuff that you do i said i live by two laws george stay under the wire and leave no trace that's just that's how i was trained as a child he used to work with the boy scouts and go in the wilderness and all that and he always trained you'd leave no trace well and i kind of liked it once i got to study in enoch he didn't leave a trace so just trying to live my part but so we see that and we know life goes on and how we read there in uh first chronicles there came the day when saul had been done away with by his own means david didn't have to kill him and how do you have killed him it would have been out of order that at the time that saul was get away with himself essentially remember the sin of oh disobedience was the sin of witchcraft where did he go right before he died he went to a witch that was supposed to have been killed but somebody missed her because she had a part to fulfill for saul to prove to him what his sin had done saul you said to kill all the witches but here i am as a witch conjuring up samuel for you because of your disobedience the life behind the life it showed that no matter how great or how big saul was and how great his anointing was something never got all the way down there he saved because samuel said you know saul this day you know by this time tomorrow you'll dwell with me he was a saved he was you know we would call it a christian man he was saved he had received salvation the salvation of his day through the sacrifice but he didn't have what it took to show the king amen he was a king and perhaps a good one in his early years but he didn't have the life in that particular case to show the king because the anointing when god said anoint me a king me asking if you want to put it that way david's the one he's the humble one he's the one that does what i tell him to do he's the one that acts on the word of god so we fast forward a little bit and we know look out david you got in trouble and shouldn't have took that woman david she wasn't yours and you even murdered me murdered a man to do it and she even became impregnated but god never let that child live and when we do wrong god will not let that child live that child has to die did brother branham said he said you have to die daily this child this stuff this child has to die amen it's got to die it was born of adultery he came into the world speaking lies it was born of adultery all the way back to the garden of eden that's how these bodies got here y'all got a belly button that tells me how you got here it's true i know it's kind of it sounds funny but it's true it tells us how we got here because of sin in the garden so we look at david and the life behind the life and david because of that he got the man killed and he was able then to take his little bride bathsheba and brought forth another son and this son so pleased god but let's just backstab just a little bit because when nathan the prophet at this time comes to david and he begins to tell him the story he said you know there was a guy and he had a bunch of sheep and such and such such shots you know there's another guy over he's he's only got one sheep but this guy over here he wanted that guy's one sheep so he killed him and took his one sheep what do you how do you judge this david why did he tell him the story of a shepherd why didn't he tell him about kings and great men because david understood the shepherd and he understood maybe that somebody had done that to him took his only sheep we don't really know there's all kinds of things happen between point a and point b and he knew what it felt like he said the man should die that did that that was proper judgment brother branham said it proved that david had the proper judgment under the law because under the law a man that committed adultery should have been stoned and burnt with fire he should have been killed a man that not just committed adultery but a man that committed murder he was to be stoned and burned with fire under the law it was the proper judgment it was the life behind the life the law living forth through david at the story of a shepherd what did the prophet say david you'll not surely die you ever think about those words what did the serpent say to eve you'll not surely die but there's a time those same words must be used to provide life because the other thing you know think about was there was it takes you know we say that in our language two to tango right and you had a woman over there that was caught in the same act that 600 years later when they brought her before jesus what did jesus say or they said you know the law says to stoner what do you say well he said you know he starts writing on the ground and they all leave he says where's your accusers she said they're gone he said then neither do i accuse you go your way and sin no more well there was another woman involved in that story that we don't hear because there's a life behind the life and she is going to become the type and shadow of the bride of jesus christ because she has received the man is the word the life comes from yes the seed comes through the man she had received the seed of her husband david the bride of jesus christ we receive our seed from our husband jesus christ and she's standing there too watching what's going on what's going on and he's giving this story david said you can't kill him she'd have been dead too finished stoned and burnt with fire so the grace that was extended to david by the word of god also extended to the wife and not just the wife the son hallelujah it's the life behind the life and she's standing there i'm not surely dying i bet she's going because what if she understood what it was all about and she might oh man this is not sounding good in fact this kind of sounds like something that happened in my family texas again my family okay but and that grace that extended itself by the word to david who is standing in position of god showing himself as king. he said you'll not die david and neither will your bride and your bride will bring forth a son named solomon who will sit upon the throne now who is remember the three uh you know son of man son of god son of who son of david and where did the bloodline come or the word line if you want to call it the life behind the blood that's it it came from the word to the king that saved the the bride that transmits itself to the sun that goes all those things you know so and so you've got to get begat begat you've got you got man by then if you're not asleep you see it runs all the way out to begot joseph we know that joseph had nothing to do with the birth of jesus christ really other than he was just the guy that was there to take care of mary but the word take care of mary you're mary that's it and the life now comes to the but to the word again and this time to marry mary you're gonna have a son and his name shall be called wonderful counselor mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace and upon his government there shall be no end how can this be well the holy ghost will overshadow you and this will happen and you'll yeah and she said what being unto me according to your word give me the life behind the word amen because it wasn't just words that came to her the angel spoke words just like we're speaking to you right now but if it's just words well the book's full of them it has to be a life behind the word hallelujah and when the life when she recognized it that's not just words that's supernatural life being spoken into my womb and what did it bring forth a supernatural life of a supernatural king let's jump back again and because of david and because of that what happened to david he lost his throne lost it he's a human being just like you and i do you ever wonder if well you know he's watching all the people leave and his size you know one of his other sons is threatening to kill him and land with his other wives and you know doing doing all kinds of bad stuff you think maybe he didn't kind of stand there and say oh man david hi lord i really blew this thing i'm not being much of a king look what i've done to the kingdom look what's happening you think you didn't feel convicted i'm thinking he felt real convicted lord i'm sorry i did this and we know that some of the psalms came forth because of that and how he even cried out why because the word of the king was within the king was within him and he said created me a clean heart a clean heart oh god and restore what what had happened he took the wrong spirit he had taken a lustful spirit he said restore the spirit lord restore that spirit that came all the way back here from samuel and the word and the life behind the word amen on samuel that transposed itself onto david to make him to show us god as king in david amen we think about david uh we can read it at second chronicles brother branham of course he says this far better than i'll get out today but second chronicles no first chronicles huh i don't know i keep wanting to go to second chronicles today but it must be something first chronicles 11th chapter it says uh that the philistines had you know garrisoned essentially bethlehem and in verse 15 of the 11th chapter first chronicles he said now three of the 30 captains went down to the rock to david where did that where was david he's on the rock who's the rock of our salvation jesus christ the king of kings so he's on the rock and they go down there but he's hiding he's in the hold and the philistines had bethlehem garrison they had it we don't have time to go into why philistines are what they are and what they represent but they had the house of god's bread to where nobody could get the bread they couldn't get it the philistines had it garrisoned off they had every kind of denominational creed every kind of whatever doctrine great men whatever it was they had philistines had some great guys not just goliath he had brothers and here's david hold up on the rock hiding from the philistines wondering what are we going to do we can't even get to the house of god's bread and he just has a desire oh oh that i had a drink let's read it verse 17 and david longed and said oh that one would give me a drink of the water of the well of bethlehem that is at the gate and the three men says the three break through the host of philistines and drew the water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david dot dot time space he's thinking about this it says but david wouldn't drink of it but poured it out upon the to the lord and said my god forbid it that i should do this thing shall i drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy amen the life that was in them put their lives in jeopardy for the king who was not even a king yet but they saw something in that king that said that king will be like god to us why because he was writing the types and shadows in his life of the king and so they go there and they fought they bought they break through and they bring the water to david i love the way you know they put them in in india they put their lives in jeopardy for their king david said i can't drink that water not after what these men have done i can't do it and he pours it out upon the ground i've often wondered what if i was one of the guys you know in a carnal way i think yeah i fought through all those guys and just dumping it out on the ground you know that's just natural thinking right but what was he doing brother branham said what was the well of bethlehem who is the well of bethlehem is the right way to ask it amen who is the well of bethlehem jesus christ the spirit of god and they went and they drew from the well of bethlehem a charge of water and they bring it to the king and when david sees it he pours it out christ is the well of bethlehem jesus said take the cup this is my blood what was in the cup the life and when david saw the life that was in them had been willing to fight for the life from the water of bethlehem he said i gotta pour it out and christ poured himself out for you and i at calvary because it was god the life behind the light showing us the life of jesus christ in king david praise the lord amen you understand it's the life it's his life in you and it i it's his life that makes us what we are it's christ in you the hope of glory and it was christ being poured out for you and i yeah so we see another type of the life behind the life and then we see you know david when he was thinking oh man i sure blew this and so he's oh i better get out of here they're going to get me too and so he heads up the hill and he stops on a rock and he begins to weep over jerusalem oh lord look what i've done look what i've done to your kingdom it's divided i what drove him to that rock what caused him to weep there over jerusalem well it was the sin of adultery and 600 years more or less we find jesus christ walking up the same hill maybe even looked around and sat on the same rock what drove him to do that the sin of adultery all the way back to the garden of eden because it was there that he had to weep over jerusalem because just as david the little shepherd boy was rejected of his brethren jesus christ has now been rejected of his own people and is getting ready to pour out his life for you and i for the bride to whom when the word said david you'll not surely die neither did she and yet she carried the bloodline from this one to this one to this one to this one and when it got to joseph what did it do it went back to the word which came to mary because only the word had the life that could reign as king praise the lord i love him and i think about you know all the stuff going on around us we're in a pretty crazy time and we understand things are you know starting to go over the edge and all that and every kingdom has to be thrown down that his kingdom can reign on high amen but where does it start the kingdom of god is with in you the kingdom of god is within us it's not you know like whoop this kingdom's right over there and we're going to jump into it it has to be here first it has to be here first or he said you'll never even see it except you'd be born again well what does born again do what's the kingdom within you right and i know the devil always comes alone you're not born again go out and do this go out and do that but i don't want to do that well just go do it because it's no good you're lost he's a liar he lied from the very first time he's lying to you most likely now if you've never come the way god said to do which whosoever calleth on the name of the lord shall be saved saul was saved the bible said he was the enemy of god you surrender your heart and life and then you step into the obedience to the word repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ and when you do that you receive a promise you shall receive you shall might take amen 10 seconds might take 10 years but you hang on to the promise because it's the only baptism of the promise i've had people say well we baptize father son and holy ghost like jesus said well okay and when i go into roman catholic countries and have people want to be baptized the family is all catholics what i do i baptize you in the name of the father son and holy ghost which is the lord jesus christ and the family is happy oh yeah we got it he did it right but acts 2 38 is the one with the promise you go you can go up down you know i don't know jump up and down on the other one maybe maybe not i don't want no maybe not in my life i want the promise of god and he said you shall receive and how now we're talking about the life behind the life is the subject we've got on today and it's like so what's the life behind that when you run it out to the new testament to the day of pentecost the life behind the life that had created jesus christ as we know through type and shadow of king david coming all the way down and here the life behind the life that has now created jesus christ now that sounds a little tough doesn't it what do you mean created jesus that's it the bible says he was the beginning of the creation of god that's right god showing himself as king in king david those types of shadows we've been talking about what were they they were the life that was going to be exposed fully in jesus christ we look good as types and shadows oh it was like you know it was christ being poured out it was christ the well of bethlehem it was christ it was christ but the fulfillment of all those types and shadows was the day that jesus stepped out on the scene and said this day this scripture is fulfilled the life behind all of those things had now come and was to be manifest there's other places in the scripture you could look we have looked a little bit before you know abraham of course is one and how that uh it couldn't come through father abraham the one that's called the father of our faith which you can look in romans to find out what that is speaking those things which are not as though they are that's the father of the faith but salvation didn't come through the father it came through the sun because when god tempts him it says in the bible that you know abraham take your son up and slain as a sacrifice abraham was looking at this going you know i got him supernaturally in the first place so i guess god's able god's able to raise him up and so in his heart he's determined to do it but when they're going when he's going up the hill the sun now is the one carrying the wood and all the other parts of the sacrifice the the fire and the knife and all that stuff it's the sun that's going up the hill but it's the lifeline that came from abraham is now living in the sun the life behind the life going up the hill he says hey dad uh we got the fire we got the knife we got the wood where's the lamb he was old enough he knew what was going on dad where's the lamb maybe getting just a little worried because there were people on earth at that time that practiced child sacrifice dad are you in the right doctrine here come on and what is abraham said the word speaking those things which are not as though they are says god will provide himself amen a sacrifice what was that it's the mind of god that's right speaking into existence amen well when abraham gets ready to kill him what happens the word comes to abraham don't do it abraham you don't need to look over there caught in the thorn bush amen what's there ram because the time wasn't yet for jesus christ to come on the scene where god would provide himself amen that sacrifice but the life behind the life spoke the word and god says you just here's your you know we would call it a placebo right just take this sugar capsule and you'll get better because the blood and bulls and ghosts wouldn't do it but it was the type and shadow that god was going to create himself as our sacrifice through jesus christ you love him so we can find him in abraham we can find him other places in the scripture there's a genesis 49 you want to take we got time for this i you only have one service so does that mean we got six hours we they told me when we were in chile one of the places we went they put the little thing on me the guy put new batteries in he says you got three hours in there and i'm going oh sweet [Laughter] we can be here at least three hours but we didn't do that to him but and i don't want to elaborate but let's just look at the life behind the life and this is this is just so you have a third example in jesus in genesis the 49th chapter you have a different prophet his name is jacob and he's a prophet yes he is his words are all right here in the book this is a book prophecy and he begins to he knows his time is about to depart and he calls all of his sons together and he begins to give each one a blessing according to their lives and according to their you know who they are they've all got his bloodline in them but they're all called to something different just like you and i and he gets i love this one in verse 49 verse 5 and he says simeon and levi are brethren instruments of cruel cruelty are in their habitations oh my soul come not in on thou unto their into their secret so there's a secret in them oh yeah unto their assembly might honor be now not united for in their anger they slew a man in their self-will they dig down a wall now the life behind the prophecy says you know it was reuben right reuben and simeon are reuben and levi simeone olivia levi says they killed somebody out of anger that was their nature that's who they were there's times maybe when you're in battle where anger is a good thing be angry and sin not that doesn't mean that means you should be angry against sin friends don't sin because of the anger but be angry against sin so there's places angry is being is good but watch how the life of that carried on because you flip over you know from genesis into exodus who do we find moses moses was the son of levite married to a woman that was a levite and when he decided it was time to take israel out and he should be the king what did he do he killed somebody amen because the life behind the life had now transferred from the prophecy into moses and he could only do what he did but there was a reason for it because that's not the only one he killed the life behind the life and they get out in the wilderness and what happens he was such a humble man i think there's a place that says he's the most humble man on earth of course he wrote the book but that that says that in but that aside what was this the life was it is in their anger they killed somebody and now they're in the wilderness and everybody is chiding with him moses you know can god give us this can he give us can he give us water unbelief and in anger what did he do he slays a man he smote the rock but not only once he smote it twice you know what brother branham said about that he said he shouldn't have done that amen he said because when he did that the life behind that anger will go all the way down through history and not only will israel reject him but the gentiles also will smite the rock the second time i indict this generation for the second crucifixion he said they'll never kill him naturally again they can't do it because he is king of kings and lord of lords and all life comes through jesus christ but he said they will kill the effects of this message where they crucified him what did it the life behind the life through levi and simeon through levi's line all the way down to moses and he killed the man he killed the man amen because pilate when he got ready he wanted to let him go what's the matter with you people you're all going crazy and you're saying crucify him he didn't do anything i want to let him go what should i do with him crucify him crucify him but i don't want to crucify him crucify him anyway and so he took him he had him whipped and when he brings him back the next time he says behold the man amen and what killed him the levitical priesthood amen because they were angry at what jesus did that's right because the life behind the life had gone all the way from genesis 49 to the day they slowed him over calvary enough sufficiente for those in this by speaking do you understand it's a life behind the life [Music] you know thinking about this deluge that we're under right now where the whole world's going crazy all of them you know there's a few countries a little less crazy than other countries for whatever reason but and states they're less crazy than other states but the only way you're going to get out of this world is to act crazier than the rest of the world to subdue the crazy people and you believe me if you you know somebody tells you to do something you said i'm not even going to do it they're going to think you're crazy because in their mind they have been anointed just drop this in you all know what brother branham said the hardest spirit he ever had to face in life religious but there was a certain way it came he said he was in the pulpit and it was a little flash and a flash and a flash and he said that spirit was so strong if he had not come if the pillar of fire had not come he said it would have knocked him out of the pulpit he said a man was trying to hypnotize him now 1957 we'll go back we're talking about our generation now 1957 they did a little experiment with the old reel-to-reel movies right every 50th frame goes by so fast you don't even see it in a movie theater they put a nice oh coca-cola man nice cold drippy thing you know one frame out of every 50 and within 15 to 20 minutes everybody in the theater couldn't even see it everybody in the theater was getting up to go back and buy a coke i'm talking 1957. first time i ever noticed it and i don't claim to have a gift but god sometimes shows us things it was back under a presidential election probably 15 20 years ago whatever it was i heard a commercial i went they're hypnotizing people with that on the radio there was a subliminal voice and vote for so-and-so so what's the will of god in our day who spoke this just briefly at home a few weeks ago well we have one man who declares himself to be president and he has 50 men running in front of him saying he's the president he's the president but the prophet said goes to the woman that received the grace and said did you know what adam and i just doing david didn't even know about it because he says the king doesn't know about it he was still king he was still alive the life was still in him to be the king prophet says you go in and talk to him bathsheba and while you're there i will come and confirm your words and so she goes in she said hey did you know what ed and i just doing david didn't have a clue and he said well yeah i said that solomon would sit on the throne here comes nathan the word says lest your wife and solomon become like malfactors i don't think that's the right word used in the scripture there you can look it up i think it's first kings one he said but lest they become malfactors what are you gonna do david says get my get my beast the power in action go get the donkey bring the donkey and anoint him prophet anoint solomon king now we have a prophecy and you can find it several places from the message of william branham and he said there will be a roman catholic president and a woman that will rise to power in america amen so you look at that well is this the will of the lord did you know there's another place he said you better pray you better pray he says both sides are messed up but he said you better pray that your children will have freedom what's the will of the lord for our day amen what is it we know it's is it the will of the lord that it go that way or is the will of the lord praying for the bride of jesus christ and the peace to israel because the name solomon means peace and i don't know who read it to me but somebody read you know those things that come up on your phone israel is already saying that depending on who becomes president they could go to war with iran it doesn't sound like peace so what's the will of the lord what's our part amen do we just stand by and let it happen or do we pray or each one of you as individuals do you do i don't care who what your political politics is just one of the strands of the devil religion politics and money are the three st the threefold court not easily broken so you pray that the bride of jesus christ gets out of here without being male factors that's just my take brother paul may have something totally different brother dean heart you be praying amen that and if this is the hour that that's supposed to take place at least you prayed about it and tried to stop it amen david wept over the city jesus wept over the city drove him out but he was restored to the throne he went through his trials and he brought forth some beautiful word of god through that trial it may mean a trial for us or multiple trials but remember as i get ready to close that let me just drop this in before we get away from it there in genesis 49 how can i remember this i'll hold on to this because i want i got a thought over here we had to want to finish with but i got to feel it in genesis 49 the next one he goes to is judah and i know we spoke on this about a year or so ago judah thou art he whom now by thy brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thy enemy the father's children shall bow down before thee judah is the lion's help from the pray my son thou art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall rouse him up what's that what's the life behind that prophecy there's a life behind the line of judah what line was david in judah so you see the life starting to intermingle going through time and he gives us the three comings of jesus christ in that one verse he's saying okay god is going to declare himself a king through judah as a lion's whelp jesus was the young lion on calvary it says i am compassed about by clown you know by these lions he was the young lion that was slain he became the prey but from the prey what did he do he went up amen he went all the way you know brother branham used to tell us the way down is up he went all the way to the pit of hell to preach to those people and then went up and then it says he couched as a lion that's talking about the rest people what's your rest to whom he has said this is the rest line up online line up online here a little there a little this is the rest what is it it's the couched lion the one that went up that sent back his holy spirit and he's just laying down to rest to watch what are we going to do with it what are we going to do with this rest and the last one is who shall rouse him up who roused the king you ever read the book of esther who roused the king wasn't heyman heyman was ready to kill them all but little esther the bride was willing to put her life in jeopardy to go before the king and say spare my children do we understand bathsheba had to intercede for her solomon her son and esther had to intercede to the king for the children of israel okay i said now i got this other thought out there to close with praise the lord i remembered this deluge that we're under and we oh it's the worst unbelief thing i've i never believed it would have gone like this just me personally i'm under the wire and out of sight who'd have thought it would come down to this and things that's going on do you think of other things that brother branham said when he you know he had that vision about the guys mix in the test tubes and when he cried out don't do it broke the vision was that what he saw i don't know but isn't it interesting what's happened since whatever was in those test tubes got out i don't know maybe it was something else but the stuff got out of the test tube however it got out whether it was deliberate active warfare or whether it was an accident we don't know he just said don't do it and now we see this deluge that we're under and oh it looks terrible sometimes i just lord what do i what am i going to do what am i supposed to what's my part what am i you guys does this affect you guys does your head ever just get to where you know that little emoji in there that you know when you're sending your text thing and the emoji with the person's head opened up and blowing up yeah that's that's me and because i don't know i don't know what to even tell you because you're all individuals you all have to have a personal experience with jesus christ my experience won't do it for you you must be born again you must be full of the holy ghost and if you're full of the holy ghost amen and the deluge in genesis i think it's the 11th chapter if i remember right uh no 20 nope that's jim genesis 7 and verse 11 it says the fountains of the deep were opened up amen and noah who'd been sitting there you know just sitting around in the ark for seven days don't see no rain but lord this is what you told me to do just stay right here in the message no no rain yet but on that that day when the fountains began the deep began to open up amen amen did you know that brother brown said there would be 200 000 000 demons released against this message where did they come from from the deep friends and the water went up and the water came down but those that were sitting in the ark might have got a little scary for a little bit but the more it rained the more the water came down and the deep was going up the higher that ark got until one day it's just bobbing along like a cork because the rain stopped and when it got to its resting place what was there a covenant god said i'll not do that again and here's my covenant we have a covenant little bride of jesus christ you shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye amen little bride of jesus christ we shall not all die we shall be changed amen that's a covenant brother branham of the church but he's in the old church facebook it's page 54 in the new one i'm not sure it's close maybe a page or two off because they've re banned some of it he said you speak the word that's right i'll perform it that's my covenant yeah amen now it's the spoken word that abraham the father of the faith said calling those things which are not as though they are i'm raptured right now because the kingdom of god is within me because jesus christ said i am the resurrection of the rapture or what we call the life the life behind the life is the life of god changing you and i into what we would call rapture or a new body by the spoken word or what we would call the third pull that's the life behind the life in each one of you individually and your revelation of who you are not anointed to be the king i'm anointed to be the king's wife or the queen

father for your gracious loving kindness to us lord lord how you come and just reveal yourself so simply in your word stirring our hearts reminding us we say thank you this morning you know saints say just a couple things that brother david spoke really stirred my heart and i just want you i'm not i'm not gonna elaborate too much here but i want you to catch this here in just it might be months things pass quickly but just here in the recent past the governor very outspoken man governor of new york got up and declared to the world god didn't bring about this suppressing of the covet god had nothing to do with it we did it he made this declaration when the covet dropped in new york and there he stood up and boastfully said it had nothing to do with god we did it that's right and he brought about a judgment was not a righteous but a judgment because you see as it has been and this is where i won't elaborate all through this scripture every time man step forward saul this is what stirred my heart saul stepped into a position where he was god didn't do this i saw your king did this david almost went down that route but when you look at this and i'm i'm condensing this down but you look at this when samuel come to david and said here's a man with one sheep and here's a man with many but he come and took his one sheep look at the judgment the anointing that come on david it was not an unrighteous judgment he said that man should die and when samuel said david you are that man what is david didn't say well you have to understand the circumstance you need to understand this you need to understand that what did david do a righteous judgment he said oh god forgive me forgive me lord pray i have sinned amen i love that brother david bathsheba's life was all based on the righteous judgment of david amen when he said god forgive me oh aren't you glad today my brother and sister we're not lifted up in our own when the word comes and speaks to us we don't justify it we stop with righteous judgment and say oh lord forgive me lord forgive me why because this is the nature of the bride she's thankful she's received forgiveness and she knows where her forgiveness comes from hallelujah aren't you glad today just a lovely service stirred my heart amen to know my brother and sister we can see our present position in the scripture already jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever now as the bride in days gone by overcame we have the assurance of the written word this bride is an overcomer hallelujah brother jason would you uh come lead us in a song
