welcome welcome holy ghost we welcome [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we will [Music] is very [Music] he goes my [Music] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] oh reminds me of the words of the prophet when he said [Music] that the holy spirit was very timid and he would come and he would dwell in the right atmosphere where we welcomed him and i say lord we welcome you tonight we don't want to just come to say we went to church but we truly want to welcome him into this building into our presence into our lives tonight walk out i don't know about you but you know we live in a world that just the day-to-day stresses and strains some days it just seems like things can be so difficult and some days it can be just so glorious and some days might start off bad but they finish so good i just have to just share with you just a little something of why i feel so happy tonight i had one of those mediocre days looking at pieces of paper and wondering i think you'll all relate to this wondering where did all our money go and uh you know it just wears on you and brother jason bless the service tonight and i felt a presence as he blessed the service and after he stepped out the door i just lifted my hands and just asked the lord let me not speak tonight just words don't let it just be something that was spoken but lord let there be an anointing amen amen on your words let there be a presence that isn't just someone saying oh you spoke something good tonight but someone would go home and say you know what god spoke to me tonight and i'm telling you saints it was a presence just settled in the room and i just went from feeling a little bit you know not glum but just a little bit tired or weary and right now i feel like just running around the outside of the church and scream a couple laps just to make sure we're all awake or something but amen i i just i trust you understand what i'm saying i just just to feel that presence you just settle in around you it's like nothing matters what happens outside around those in this world just nothing else matters amen let's just go to the word tonight i want to speak to you again from the book of proverbs age old proverbs i i'm i don't know about you but i'm finding inspiration as i read the book of proverbs you know we're not reading every chapter i'm i'm just trying to go along and find inspiration in the words uh and some of this as in the case tonight we have 18 verses but it actually i felt to read all 18 of them but my real thought comes and you'll see it in the title here knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth and that's one of the most beautiful things that when god has come and i don't want to spoil my thought tonight but when god has come and anointed us not at the anointing of a great teacher not the anointing of someone who is great at explaining things but when god himself has come and it's there and he has given us revelation which is understanding it just comes we don't have to fight for it it just comes sometimes we don't understand but in the right season the word just manifests itself and becomes alive to us it's no longer just a bible you know the prophet of god you know he tells us and right at the moment i had it on my mind but the words just escaped me but he said you know when we have that revelation let me just paraphrase that when we have that revelation this bible will become a whole new book amen that's when understanding has come to us amen and we know then what god's plan is and what he had for us and i pray tonight this uh will inspire you we want to look at this uh some very direct you know that's one thing i love about some very very direct things very direct scriptures versus uh uh you know god doesn't let me just put it this way god doesn't beat around the bush god's not gonna you know patty cake us god's not going to sugarcoat everything amen brother branham says these words like this he said god didn't ask you if you felt it he didn't ask you if you liked it he asked you believe it oh lord help me you know we use the word believer around the message a lot but lord i want to be a real believer amen not just not just in word not just in that i want to be a real believer amen proverbs 14th chapter start with the first verse every wise woman buildeth her house but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands now we don't want to change the scripture saints but i think we can just change that every wise person you know it isn't just gender specific here he that walketh in his uprightness feareth the lord but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him in the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride but the lips of the wise shall preserve them where no oxen are the crib is clean but much increases by the strength of the ox a faithful witness will not lie but a false wiltness will utter lies a scorner seeketh wisdom and findeth it not but knowledge is easy unto him that understanding go from the presence of a foolish man when thou perceive us not in him the lips of knowledge the wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way but the folly of fools is deceit fools make a mock at sin but among the righteous there is favor the heart knoweth his own bitterness and a stranger doth not intermittent with his joy the house of the wicked shall be overthrown but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish my right there tells you we're not a prosperity gospel but that verse right there tells you my brother and sister what's wrong with a lot of the world amen you see they think because they have increased in goods right right revelation we've increased in goods we have need of nothing there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death even in laughter the heart is sorrowful and the end of that mirth is heaviness the backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways and a good man shall be satisfied from himself the simple believeth every word but the prudent man looketh well to his going a wise man feareth and departeth from evil but the fool rages and is confident he that is soon angry dealeth foolishly and a man of wicked devices is hated the simple inherit folly but the prudent are crowned with knowledge heavenly father we just ask you to bless this time tonight lord as we desire just to lord look into your word let it deal father with each and every heart i ask you lord deal kindly with us lead us and guide us lord into all truth we ask in the precious name of jesus christ amen you may be seated i don't know that i will get to this in its entirety tonight you know sister jerry often has told me in the past when i say oh it's going to be a short service she's like uh-huh but i want to take verse 15 real quick the simple believeth every word but the prudent man looketh well to his going you see saints this is actually a fundamental reason of why brother paul constantly tells you go back to your bible go back to the message do not take a man's word for it the scripture says the simple believeth every word if you do not take what is spoken to you at the word level you take it at man's level you take it an interpreted level you will find yourself in trouble but if you will take and look well to the word of god go look back and to find that and study that and make sure that it is it's only your soul that you're laying upon the line it's only your soul that you are putting up uh in and uh you might say uh uh duty to this and so i just once again want to encourage you when people will say things i i have become resistant to the idea of people just saying well the prophet said and then they go on and ramble on into some kind of explanation and uh you know i'll just be honest with you i don't mind if you do that to me i often times when i've set in places and people said well the prophet said they don't tell you when where how and they ramble off into something i start writing things down and you'd be surprised at the amount of times you cannot find in context what they said the prophet said i don't say that to be negative tonight i'm just telling you it's up to you okay don't assume that everyone speaking to you is going to put things in the correct way you have a duty to you your family amen to make sure the truth is coming over the pulpit amen now let me just go on hallelujah i got you all glum looking now amen now i want to go to verse 1 here you know and this struck me so profoundly and i'm not looking at it just to a woman but i've i thought you know this is interesting in terms of how the scripture speaks it here every wise woman buildeth her house but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands and you know you'd look at that and we would ask our question why would we destroy our own house and we can take that one upon ourself as being a temple of the holy ghost uh you know created in the image of god we are his tabernacle and you know what we desire is not to pluck it down we don't want to just keep destroying the house it is but when you think about how it would be that someone would have something that had been built up or has the potential to be great and yet they would continue to pick away or destroy destroy that to to do things to that that ultimately brings the demise of that house causes it to fall down my brother and sister you have to just question and we'd realize in the age that we're living in there's all kinds of spirits and just a little reading that we've been doing and looking at what's happening in our nation and brother branham talking about how that we have become a nation of neurotics and i believe certainly we are witnessing the fulfillment of that my brother and sister it's here in the political realm i just mentioned to brother jay that the government accounting office has come up with the total and no don't hold me to the exact numbers but the fourteen hundred dollars that the government wants to send you will ultimately add over fifteen thousand dollars in debt to the national debt and my brother and sister the way the government calculates that that baby that was just born is now in debt and so when you think about that they're going to give you 1400 but it's going to cost 15 000 plus to pay it back so you see when the prophet of god said this nation would be broke well you know it's interesting because sometimes people start to look at that and say well yeah united states is really messed up i'll say amen to that but we also look at this of what the prophet have said and you put it in context and realize when america falls it will suck the nations of this world down with it there will be no one exempt there will be no utopia there will no mecca for us to run to our only hiding place is jesus christ amen so you're not going to run uh you know off to the jungles of brazil you're not going to run off to wherever it might be and hide out my brother and sister it simply isn't going to happen when this falls and when that uh spirit comes and starts to take dominion over the governments of the earth and it becomes a truly one world government uh ruled by we know who my brother and sister the only refuge will be will be in jesus christ but thank the lord the prophet of god said at that point in time amen at the full manifestation of that the bride will be gone so while we should look at this with concern because it is a sign of the time don't be getting all fretted and all heated up about the fact that it's all falling apart amen when this happens the scripture says look up your redemption draweth nigh and that tells me our redemption is really really close hallelujah because we see people i listened to just a little clip today of a congressman uh that uh you wouldn't even have to guess what political party was and he says that there's this 1.9 or whatever trillion dollar covet bill you realize there's hundreds of millions of dollars they haven't spent from the last bill they passed but we got to pass another one because they need to give money to their friends and they couldn't get money from the old deal to give to their friends so they had to create a new deal to give money to their friends but this congressman said this is going to be one of the best things that ever happened to the citizens of the united states you talk about being put under a strong delusion to believe a lie not all the delusions will have religious overtones not all the lies will be doing about deceiving people concerning jesus christ see it all ties together so we look at this and why would a woman see now the scripture types a woman as the church so let's just look at that for just a moment why would the church tear down something so beautifully that god has built but they're anointed to do that just as this would be right here with this take this natural spiritual however you want the foolish plucketh it down with her hands oh god anoint us my brother and sister let me just speak this real blunt i hope this doesn't hurt anybody's feelings tonight let me speak this real blunt let's be builders not destroyers let's lift one another up let's lift a husband a wife children the whole church let's lift one another up and be builders not plucking away with our hands tearing it down not tearing it down is an anointing right from the pit of hell we were not called to tear things down and this scripture right here will show us that the wise woman i want to be a wise woman amen i want to be of that anointing to be a builder not a destroyer hallelujah amen going on i want to hurry along tonight i wish i could just labor all of this but that's not her thought he that walketh in his uprightness feareth the lord so you see the direct correlation between one's position and how they walk is in relationship to how they look at god if we look at god as a dodie grandfather then we will live like he's a dodi grandfather that's just going to give us anything we want i want this i want that i want this i want that but if we look at that that our god as we'll take ourselves as sons and daughters of god our god is a responsible parent what do responsible parents do come on parents you know what i'm talking about responsible parents even go against their own feelings for what is good oh let me just throw this in here let me just slip this one under the door sometimes we do things with our children because we feel amen i feel so sorry for my children i just i know i told them to clean their room but they just have so many toys and so much stuff that they've strewn in their room i just feel sorry for them so i'm gonna act like i never told them to okay let's solve the problem throw half of their toys half of their clothes away so they don't have so much to clean up then you won't have to feel sorry for all that they have to clean up come on no what does a real parent do a real parent says if i let my child get away with it today they will want to get away with it tomorrow they will want to get away with it the next day and the next day and the next day and i as a parent will actually ruin my child saying i love them so what does a real parent do corrects his child even though you know isn't it funny my son joel i tell on him joel if you're listening amen i love you son but i used to tell my kids you don't understand i'm fixing to whip them their mother whipped them twice as much as i did so that kind of gives you an idea but i'm fixing it with my kid and i would tell joel's son this is going to hurt me more than it hurt you and my son is like 14 and he's like that's a lie dad but now he's 34 and he's like i think i understand but you see you have to have that and now god's not a dirty grandfather we'll tie that together in just a minute or else i'll get off on this it's not really a rabbit trail it's just a a right turn instead of a left or a left turn instead of a right amen so our direct view and how we walk is how we look at god see the perverse despises god the upright they they fear god but this is not a fear that comes from you know the mad dog trying to bite you this is not a fear that comes from someone bigger a bully trying to hurt you this is a fear that ties back into the hebrew as reverence this is respect this is love this is honor and he that honors respects and loves god walks upright we cannot say we have the holy ghost and live and be a person contrary to the nature of god now if that rubs some hide off of you i say i'm sorry but truth is truth amen we cannot walk contrary to the word of god and say i love the lord amen we've got a warped view of what it is to be obedient and love the lord now in the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride but the lips of the wise shall preserve them now you look at this my brother and sister in a previous uh and i'm sorry i should have researched it so i could give you something more definitive but but a couple services ago on the proverbs here the scripture said it's pride that bringeth contention isn't it amazing that pride is something that we can hide so well now a certain degree of pride is what keeps us from being slobs right we could have showed up today to church in that shirt that had coffee stains and a little bit of your raspberry croissant but because we have a little bit of pride and respect for the house of god we we dress we dress correctly we we dress in clean clothes nice clothes but you see a rod of pride a rod is something that is stiff so a stiff nature of pride where is it displayed is it displayed in the prudent is it displayed in the life of the wise what does the scripture say that a man has a hard time taming his tongue kind of like a man training a horse now i have a love-hate relationship with horses they eat hay i love them but i used to ride them they've stepped on my feet broke my foot they've done things that caused me to look at horses with very much ill regard but think about a wild bronco a wild horse of the desert brother david's road he's road ranch he's cowboy he knows what it's like to ride a good horse and how difficult it is to do the same job on a horse that's und pardon me with my words i'm not slipping converted an unconverted horse brings nothing but trouble yeah reminds me of a rancher friend that we knew years ago he's passed away now he said i tell you he said i will never never own a horse that will walk away from me i guess when he was young man he was somewhere doing doctor and a calf or something and he looked up and he sees his horse going up over the hill headed back towards the ranch and at that moment he made him he made his mind up i'll never own a horse that will leave me well i want you to think about this my brother and sister that in this we come to a place that a rod of pride could cause us to constantly leave the word you say well what do you mean by that brother paul you see we have the nature of christ but a rod of pride cannot be submitted to the word and exist as a rod of pride stiff the scripture speaks about stiff-necked heart of heart you see somewhere along we have to die can we say amen we have to die and decide we're going to submit to the word of god or we keep our rod of iron pride that's right unbendable no one's going to tell me not the preacher but let me turn that what if it wasn't really the preacher speaking to you what if it was god himself who said i'm going to use this vessel to speak and you say i don't want the words of that preacher and yet it's god speaking the rod of pride will not accept correction but the word of god says those i love what happens somewhere along the line our rod of pride must be broken it must be submitted otherwise we won't even god himself can't chasten us now i pardon me for using these words there's young people here but the scripture says very plainly very direct one that would not receive correction is a bastard child that's not us that is not us we will receive correction from the holy ghost it is not as man-lording we just read this this last sunday it's not as a preacher lording over the house of god yes those people exist my heart goes out to many people that are tape only and and of those things because they have been abused by ministry to the place they trust no man but i tell you what our brother eugene braun up in canada is a man of such a nature with horses he can take a horse that has been abused and will not trust a man and he just sent me a video the other day i'm not saying this horse was such but this is the nature brother eugene has and his desire and his communication with animals is that he's there in a round pin walking and he's got this horse that is following him and he's doubling back and he's doing all of these things and this horse there's no lead rope there's nothing this horse loves him this horse wants to be with him and you can take a horse that's been abused and you put the right man and he can cause that horse to trust again i said my heart goes out to those that have been abused by those that lorded over god's people over god's heritage they had no right to do that and they'll stand accountable one day for that but my brother and sister we have a god we can trust amen and we can stand with his word and he will not forsake us he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you we can stand on that amen we can trust god amen so we see in the mouth of the foolish is this rod of pride but the lips of the wise shall preserve him oh my brother and sister let's not let pride bring contention if we find ourselves in contention let us stop and say lord forgive me that my pride is causing me to bring contention my pride is causing me to act and behave and to live like i am lord break me let me come and come tenderly before you humbly before you oh you say well that must be people that have problems no saints tonight i'm talking to you and i am is that okay amen now verse 4 has quite an interesting thing to it that we shall look at here and maybe a tad bit more depth where no oxen are the crib is clean but much increases by the strength of the ox now you look at that and my brother and sister to me that scripture is very plain you see there's an easy way no effort involved you have the the uh crib is what that word is used the corel the pin the enclosure you see if there's no ox in the enclosure there's no ox in the corral there's no ox inside you won't have to feed you don't have to water you don't have to clean you don't have to do nothing but the scripture clearly shows you that you will not have much gain either so you'll find the very nature of an individual that says you know what i think i'm just going to take the easy way you realize whole churches are filled up with preachers that are preaching the easy way but nothing's gained put an ox put an aux in your corel put an aux in your pen old phrase goes way back my father used to speak this to me he'd remind me when i'd be like dad i don't want to do chores i don't want to do this i don't want to do that and you know that i just don't want to do that i don't want to spend my savings buying a trailer load of hogs i don't want to do this my dad would tell me nothing ventured nothing gained now i want you to apply that tonight my brother and sister as a christian i want an easy way i want an easy life as a christian i want things to go smooth i want it my way you've got no aux in your corel you want to come and you want to grow you want to gain you want to do that get an ox in your corel i hope you follow in the spiritual get something in there that you have to labor at you have to give effort into you have to dedicate yourself it might be that you would say well my prayer life is suffering and when i get down all i can do is say woe unto me lord woe unto me change my wife change my pastor change my church change my wife change my husband change my children how about you pray for someone else put that ox in your corel and instead of being there whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa is me why don't you put an ox in your corel and you pick someone that you see around you and maybe it's not just someone you love but you start praying until you see god make a difference but no i want it simple i want it easy i want to pray for my family i want to pray for my prosperity i want to pray for the ease of my life oh have i offended anyone yet tonight spurgeon says i'm not doing my job until i offend someone so i'll keep laboring you see my brother and sister the manner woman that's willing to deal with the mess not bury it not bury it my daughter's been helping me i'm embarrassed myself but it's the truth my daughter's been helping us move and doing stuff and they went over in my office and they're like uh dad we opened the doors to the used to be a closet in a kid's room it's now a place i probably have 150 books in there and they looked in there and they're like dad we're just not touching that we can't touch that it's just i said why not it's just too much do you realize with organization that same closet could have been nice and tidy and probably held everything in an orderly fashion but you know paul read a book and it just seems like it was easier to set a book on top of a book to set a book on top of a book the easy way out but you know what i have today a mess and it might seem easier to open the closet door and put your troubles in the closet and close the door again i want the easy way out i don't want to have to face it i don't want to have to deal with it i don't want to have to come to conclusion i might actually find that i'm at fault so i'll put it in the closet and i'll close the door and then i'll say everyone stay out of my closet you see it's the manner of the woman that's willing to deal with the mess that sees the game the man or the woman that's willing to get down on their knees and submit to the holy spirit is the one who will see spiritual gain in their life that person will be the one that people will say they are so spiritual they are an overcomer what is it my brother and sister they decided to deal with the mess and often times the mass is their self that's right i'm still working on offending someone tonight am i getting closer you see if you're not willing to deal with the mess you're not willing to see you will not see gain we're willing to deal with our own spiritual position and realize that if we put the spiritual thermometer in there that we're closer to lukewarm than we are to red hot until we're willing to deal with that my brother and sister you'll see no gain in your spiritual life and then you'll say but is god going to answer my prayers well my brother and sister it's just a matter of how serious you are about those things please don't get quiet on me tonight now look at this dealing with a mess i'm going to draw we're going to shift a little direction here tonight is that okay now we're going to just draw from this a mess now brother branham says in door in the door he says a birth is a mess i don't care where it's at excuse this is expression but if a birth is in a pig pen it's a mess if it's in a cow barn it's a mess if it's in a hospital room it's a mess if it's at the altar it's a mess you see if we're not willing to deal with the mess we're not going to see any gain brother branham talks about this i don't want to get sidelined because it's a whole nother subject but brother branham says we have way too many dry eyed confessions we have way too many dry eyed coming i will do and and we'll deal with that in a quote here in a minute but my brother and sister if it's not a mess you didn't break through it's not a lifting a hand and say i believe the message it's got to be a birth there's got to be a birth my brother and sister this message is not exempt that we have come to the place that people come and they are not truly pouring their heart out they're not truly giving up a nature they're not desiring for god to deal with the nature because they look at the mess and say it's easier to close the closet doors of my mind the closet doors of my heart the closet doors of my life and not deal with it you say brother paul why are you preaching this way because i want you to make a rapture and you're not going to make the rapture with bitterness and unfounded things and anger and rebellion and all of these things harbored inside that closet we've got to open the door saints it's it's not that we open it to one another and then pour her shame out it's not a shame for sons and daughters of god to stand in front of the sons and daughters of god and the word says confess your best parts confess your utter utter incredibility no it says confess your faults but you see i'm still working on offending someone tonight so i can make spurgeon's words come true that you haven't truly preached the gospel until you preached it to the level of offending people but you see the reason we can't get there it's because we have this rod of pride and if i was to come to a brother and say brother i have this and this issue i have this in my life and i need delivered what will he think of me what will they think of me what will everyone think of me if they realize i'm human what is it it's pride and our pride is greater than our desire to be free if it's at the altar it's a mess it'll hmm brother branham he just is so mean he would not pass diversity training in 2021 because he's me it'll make you rot in your own thinking your thinking will have to be dead and rotting it'll make you throw away everything things that you once cherished with all of your heart you give up to let that little still knock now look at this you think oh the things i cherished with all of my heart if we're not careful we'll be looking at i wanted a nice house i wanted a nice car i wanted nice clothes i wanted this do you realize the thing that most of us cherish most is buried within us it's not external it is our desire for control of the world around us our desire to control everything is a nature of humanity and that's why when the scripture says cast all your cares unto him we have such a struggle i'm gonna fix this i can fix this i will fix this and instead if we're broken and we're rotten to our own thinking we're gonna say i can't fix this lord i've got to give this to you not all i'll force to give it to you but we'll come to the place we'll say lord i have to give it to you i want to give it to you i can't do this but you see we cherish the ability to say i fixed my problem i don't know if you realize just how hard this is for me to preach because while i might be pointing a finger out there i'm facing the very reality of what i'm saying to you is this not so right that's right please no one get an idea that i'm trying to pick on somebody pick on you in particular i have to face what i preach my own self amen that's right you see now brother brown says here where has thy strength go on samson says we all know that the bible teaches the new birth yes and they substituted handshakes and everything else for the new birth but it'll never take the place of the new birth it's got to be an experience it's aborned again now look i don't mean to be negative but look i'm not going to be stand before god one day and not speak against these things and do it we have not replaced a signing on a book come on saints i want you to think about this if brother paul come on a sunday morning called brother ivan he'd probably refuse but i said brother ivan now you're going to go from row to row and you're going to get all the saints to sign the membership book come on who who would say i'll sign it no sir because we don't believe in the membership book it's not about membership to this church and my name's already in the book and your name is already in the book we don't need to go sign in somebody's book but you see my brother and sister in the message i don't want to offend no one we've settled for god's center prophet yes god says prophet you're in no my brother and sister no substitute for a new birth nothing will substitute for a new birth it don't matter that my grandpappy and and my grandma and all all sides of our family and my parents and and my siblings and my children all believe doesn't matter that's right doesn't matter there's got to be a new birth and the new birth brings a nature change we cannot have the nature of the crow oh come on my brother and sister the prophet of god teaches he's saying we can't have the nature of the crow and be a dove we cannot eat its food but it can eat ours so don't get the idea that we're all eating the same food we must all have the same revelation and same understanding and the same love to the lord no sir we all know that any kind of birth is a mess when a baby is born if it's on the floor if it's in the shock pile or a pink decorated hospital room it's a mess but it brings life anybody crave life i tell you what i don't mean to do this and i'll get in trouble with some parents that will have to whip their kids for me speaking things out and their kids turn around repeating it but there was a song i'll just put it that way my childhood and the song talked about searching for life i could sing it to you that some of your parents had whipped me next and after you whipped your kids for singing but in the song they're just talking about how they're searching they're searching they're searching searching for life come on part of our human nature it's who we are we were made to worship we were made and we'll search for life but what level of life will we stop searching at is what's important we can settle for a denominational experience i could i could have just plastered you tonight with quotes brother brown says some people get just enough to join a church i don't want to join the church i want to go in the rapture i was born to be i am the rapture some people all freak out over that no i tell you i can give you quotes where brother branham says that you are the rapture and you are moving forward from here amen hallelujah it doesn't matter shuck pile pink decorated hospital room it's a mess but it brings life and that's what the new birth is it's a mess but it brings life it isn't a style it is or a put on or a declaration of creeds it's baptism of the holy ghost and that's the secret of the real bible a real oh i put bible in there sorry because when i think of believers i think of the bible that's the secret of the real believing church come on church we want to be that kind of church we want to be that kind of church that is the real believing church we don't want to stop anywhere short of all of the word of god you know i've been criticized you know people say well say only what the prophet said and you know i'm i'm sorry this goes into a deal i won't explain it but my brother and sister my response to that don't just say just what the prophet said because i can give you quotes right now that i could read to you that would imply a certain angle and you would look at that so i say don't just say what the prophet said say all that the prophet said let's not cherry pick some little spot you know how the quotation thing is dot dot dot dot our favorite quote dot dot dot dot no let's say all that he said let's take every portion of it get it all in balance get it all in focus not just a part that fits well hallelujah because we would not only have the cow on the top of the tree we would have built a nice spiral golden staircase our own version of babel to get the cow in the tree what's the secret church of the real believing church mourned again you say brother paul we are born again that's wonderful i say amen thank you lord because you see the old adage if the shoe fits wear it and if it doesn't toss it to the one you think it fits okay so i messed up the old adage a little bit a faithful witness will not lie but a false witness will utter lies a scorner seeketh wisdom and findeth it not but knowledge is easy unto him that understand it you see my brother and sister when eyes are opened and ears are open our understanding which we would call revelation when that comes to you can we say amen we've experienced it revelation god's word speaking to us not a man's interpretation not an explanation not an educational class not a tutorial but revelation amen when that comes to you how many can testify that when revelation has been opened to you was to you not someone else you start to see here here here here here here here and it all starts to come together they don't conflict they don't come and start bouncing off of each other and pieces flying everywhere and something's falling to the floor no sir when revelation comes it starts to come to you and it starts going and if it had an audible sound of a click you would be hearing click click click click click click click and it starts coming together or we can settle for someone who's very articulate would have made a good school teacher showing us this should fit here and if this fits here then this must fit here well sister ruth was sharing with me very interesting i enjoyed that conversation sister ruth about a puzzle with a picture on both sides and pieces that are exactly the same only they don't belong there even if they fit but did see the very elect saints if it was possible oh look it must be right it fits but the picture's wrong think about it think about it but what does revelation do revelation allows you before you ever try to put that in place in your life to say that might fit my thinking my emotion my reasoning but it doesn't fit the word because it's not painting the right picture so what happens revelation starts to come in this knowledge my brother and sister is not a man's knowledge otherwise we would all as believers get a phd in religion and make the rapture so it's not that kind of knowledge so when our eyes and ears are understanding revelation starts to come it all starts to come together and we realize after a while we are you might say little walking encyclopedias you understand what i'm saying we know what goes where and we know what these things tie together and we can say this is what god meant get this now saints we're not talking about arrogant and we're not talking about being assumptive we're talking about revelation coming to you and you can stand there and say this is what the word meant and the word tied to this and this tie together and it produces this right here and you stand there and people are like how do you you sound how why do you think you're that my brother and sister they don't understand because revelation hasn't come that the intellect that you are displaying in their terms the intellect you display is not your intellect the mind of christ is in you and you are then speaking the word and the word is coming forth from your lips just like it would be the preacher but it's not you it's god speaking through you because it is god in you hallelujah and so people will say well where do you guys get that how do you tie all that together that's not what our church believes my brother and sister i can't help what they believe without revelation but when revelations come and i believe you can say amen to this when revelations come you cannot unsee it you cannot just say i'm gonna wipe my my hard drive and just not see the revelation of jesus christ you can't do it because it becomes your very life but knowledge is easy and to him that understandeth right aren't you glad that's why the prophet of god is saying so let me build this foundation for you he said pray for revelation first and foremost pray for revelation because then you can fulfill this scripture because then god has filled you with his knowledge and all the rest of the bible and life all start just falling in place and before you ever try to squeeze something into your life the holy spirit speaks to you and says that might fit but it's the wrong nature it's going to paint the wrong picture it's not going to produce the desired results right that's right because those he loves he chases and some when he chastens them it would be as it were with a rod of iron but some as he chastens is just a nudge as i heard a minister once say he said there's a reason they put the little strip on the side of the road where your car goes rumble rumble rumble it lets you know you're getting off the road and the holy spirit has become your rumble strip that when you start to get off he starts warning you you're getting off you're getting off you're getting off you're getting off and if somehow we get past that you still have two more wheels you're still going to be safe even if you're part way off the road because you got two more wheels and the rumble strip speaks the same message get back in line get back in line get back in line get back in line oh can't you thank god holy ghost is our rumble strip saints amen i thank you lord thank you lord because i tell you what a lot of us have plowed up a lot of sagebrush without the holy ghost in our life amen hallelujah you see it's god's intelligence showing us when where and how amen it's always been him and it will always be him amen oh my the wisdom of the prudent verse 8 is to understand his way but the folly of fools is deceit you know what i say how beautiful it is when the lord shows us our way you know there's two sides to that i've spoke about him loving us and chastening us there's two sides to that tonight those he loves he chastens we all say thank you lord you're correct to me come on saints let's not push back against it let's not say somebody's got an axe to grind it's to do i'm laboring you might realize it tonight i'm laboring to preach this to you because i don't want to be misunderstood but you see we've got to open the closet door and we've got to face what we've thrown in there for years we've got to face it because at some point in our life we have to clean out that closet amen my who would think moving and having a closet full of books could be a sermon those he loves he chastens but the scripture says also blessed is a man whose eyes can see and ears can hear look at the two sides of this he chastens us corrects us because he loves us and then he opens our eyes he opens our ears and then says oh praise god their eyes are open their ears are open i'm going to pour blessings and knowledge and wisdom and revelation into them and he's the one that did it all the time and here we are we'd be off power and brush in the countryside out through the desert but god said no i'm going to warn them i'm going to bring them back i'm going to catch their attention all chasing them because i love them and i'm going to bring them to a place not running off the side of the road not getting lost in the journey not getting lost in laodicea in the wilderness of sin isn't it amazing the name that was given when israel was going from egypt into the promised land the wilderness of sin well we've got a wilderness of sin right here it's on the earth today and it's on every continent every island every place there's a wilderness of sin and god says you know what they're going to get lost in the wilderness sin they're going to get turned around and some are going to say nope i'm just going to go back to egypt but he says nope i love them and i want to bring them to the place i can pour wisdom and knowledge and revelation into them so that i can say hey look you've got revelation you got wisdom you got knowledge i'm going to pour more into you god bless you my son god bless you my daughter and the whole time it's him it's him it's him it's him it's no man it's no ability we have we should lift a hand and say thank you lord you love me so much that you're going to pour yourself into me oh hallelujah let me hurry along here when i pass from this life maybe you guys will remember that i consider time to be a relenting unrelenting foe verse 12 there's a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death without going on further into my notes too deep here i want to just bring it to you brother branham says in the sermon satan's eden he said that that is speaking of an intellectual reasoning of the word of god a way that seems right you know what it makes perfect sense brother david brother chris that we as a ministry ought to leave lead the church in this fashion right here we can preach without talking about the prophet we can do this without doing that we can come and have church without communion because that well that's old-fashioned we can do these things we can lower a standard a little bit fill it up build a new building have a nice deal a good reputation visitors will stay because we're so hospitable and we can do this and somewhere along the line will make a difference now without implying of anyone when where and how i had a man in the message a minister sat down asked me to sit down with him and explain to me that the reason their church has taken the stand that it's taken is someone has to reach out to the foolish virgin well let me just declare it to the internet to the world i'm here to preach to the bride of jesus christ i'm not here trying to catch the foolish virgin because the foolish virgin under that anointing is not going to apply the word in the fashion that she should but this bride will take every drop of the word she will submit herself to the word she will say lord my heart's desire is to be your word i don't want to just confess that your word is true i want to be your word i want to be what it's talking about i want to be that man i want to be that woman we're not here to say look let's all compromise together so the foolish virgin will feel comfortable i say foolish virgin find an altar get the holy ghost get filled up get on fire don't settle for the lukewarm don't settle for a human justification i'm justified they said this i can say this they did this i can do this forget about your justification get into christ get into the word become that word hallelujah do i care about the foolish virgin i have no clue who they are i care about them but i rather stand knowing i preach the truth than to stand saying i compromised that they would be comfortable look what kind of anointing is that will lower the whole standard of the church so that this person will feel comfortable that is nonsense my brother and sister we are not lowering the standard of the word so that we can justify to ourselves that we somehow attracted the people of our neighborhood the prophet of god said in fact when the mayor of the city starts coming to church you have reason to be concerned that's right come on i don't mean to hurt anybody's feelings but we got to deal with the truth saints hallelujah so brother brown says here a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof is a ways of death brother branham clearly says you can find it in the sermon satan's eden he says right there see that was intellectual that was reasoning oh can i have a couple more minutes hallelujah oh my faith cometh by hearing brother brown says here now look i'm closing i just want to i just want to have a moment to it's a fairly long quote i want to have a moment to just expound upon this not just skip through it now hope will agree with the bible i hope i hope i don't know if any of you brother kenny you'll never hear this any of you know brother kenny capps little fireball all five feet of him he makes a comment the other day somebody had posted a deal can you make it to heaven without baptism brother kenny made a comment said well it's in the scripture boy you talk about a firestorm that's why saints you won't find brother paul commenting on the internet because you might as well carry a fire extinguisher because there's it don't take nothing to turn it into a big fireball and so they were people and they had every crazy idea on there i mean it was unbelievable what people said well our church and i think and that can't be and brother kenny god bless you but he had sense enough he just bowed out and the fire raged on without him i shared a little of that with sister jerry you have people making absolutely unscriptural declarations concerning baptism couldn't back it up with the bible if their life depended on it our pastor teaches our church says you see these are the very words the prophet of god said would come to the day and he took it back to the scripture to show us where the scripture said it'll come to that day imagine that now hope will agree with the bible hope will say it's true hope will say i believe every bit of it i believe that's the word of god i believe that god will keep his promise hope believes all of that but hope then says now i believe that god will heal but look at my condition come on saint you wonder why brother paul kind of chastised the church a little bit about how you'll stand out in the foyer talk about your illnesses aches and pains and you won't bring it up here and put it before the body of christ hope believes all that i believe god will heal me but let me tell you about how my hip my knee and my back and my shoulder and my head brother when when was your prayer request did i miss it when did you ask the body of believers which is the manifested body of jesus christ when did you bring that to them that they could lift it to the throne i must have missed it and i do sometimes the other day i said oh brother jason forgot to make an announcement and jerry's like no he made the announcement and i said i must have still been in the back and she's like no you were standing beside me oh i would never do that i'm i'm not that old i'm not that mentally decrepit yet am i thank you for not saying amen no look at this my brother and sister i believe god will heal but look at my condition now faith don't look at that faith comes around and says i don't care nothing about conditions god said so and it's mine you see faith's burly as i once said faith has hair on the chest and when it stands up and pulls its big muscles out everything else vanishes away just takes flies away when faith really takes a hold nothing else stands i'm telling you faith but you've got to have hope let's get this balance right everything is about balance you've got to have hope and charity see let's not substitute hope for real faith but when you as it were want faith and you pursue faith you can't throw hope and charity out praise god i remember one time this is many years ago a prayer line they were really popular in church when i was growing up mind times they might have been three or four prayer lines in a month somebody would come up for prayer and somebody else would come my sister jerry one time got all flustered and upset down in chile one time because she's like that one sister went through the line four times what sister jerry didn't know is the first time was for her second time was for her husband third time was for her mother sister jerry's like she didn't realize how tired you were she could have done that all at once but look sorry sorry for the humor see you've got to have hope and charity and if you've got real burly faith and no love in it you'll ruin your influence before the people if you haven't got love mixed with it see you've seen people real burly what we would say excuse the expression bulldog faith grab a hold but it was so rough with it then you see when you do that it doesn't it hasn't got the kindness here to move with it so what we need is hope faith and charity isn't that right hope faith and charity together god help our children to have it like that can we say amen to that god help our children our church i mean excuse me god help our church to have it like that faith hope and charity amen that we can stand rugged and strong and determined real warriors on the word but we can wrap that all in love look i remember many years ago sorry i don't mean to be nostalgic but i'm going to drive this home but i can remember many years ago when the preachers were proud of the fact they would come out in the service and say i know that young men like you are sinning i know that you are not living right i know and you need to be in that altar and if you're not in that altar i'll come back and i'll drag you up there you know what happened next service he was sitting back here and when he was 18 he never walked in the doors of a church again where was the love where was the love where he might know brother sean will stand as my example i'm sure he doesn't mind i would know he's sinning might even saw him as it were walking into the theater might have saw him somewhere in the city where he didn't belong but you see with faith hope and charity i would start working my way real slow just like the hunter and the hunted and i would work myself into his friendship and i would work myself into his confidence until i could stand with my arm around his shoulders and say son been down that road there's a better way don't go there don't go there come back to the cross you see it's not about superiority it's about god's heritage it's about us loving those that we see as sons and daughters of god so much that we'll do everything we can do within our ability to draw them back to christ not show them not shame them not humiliate them but draw them back hasn't got the kindness here to move with it so what we need is hope faith and charity isn't that right hope faith and charity together god help i say this again god help our church god help grace tabernacle to have it like that the people to have that combination but if you just rely on hope you hinder faith now hope looks for something way off but faith claims it right now right here see faith says god said so and it's mine that settles it it's done see i don't care if i'm still crippled i'm still blind if i'm still sick then i don't have nothing to do with it i believe it anyhow it's mine right now god said so and that settles see that's faith sister emmy if you'll come look saints i spoke some pretty direct things tonight i want you just to understand i want you to step forward claim what is rightfully yours say brother paul i'm living right i'm not sin and i'm not doing that but if you let one promise of god go unclaimed you have robbed yourself sometimes we say well the devil the devil the devil you know i'm stealing this from my brother preach this sermon the devil's outside the door crying because we failed to claim a promise of god and then we blamed it on the devil and he's outside the door saying i didn't have nothing to do with it it was right there all they had to do is step out and claim it [Music] come on saints let's claim i don't care of what thing is happening in your world god's got a solution for it i don't care what troubles have beset you god's got the answer you look to man you will get a man's answer you look to psychology will have a psychologist answer you look to whatever it might be you'll have their answer you look to god and you'll have the supernatural answer that will be life-changing hallelujah let's not pass by amen let's take this position right now god said so that settles it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my i know it was the what song are you playing pleasing sing pleasing that'll be beautiful just caught me right there please i want to be pleasing lord let me be pleasing oh hallelujah brother jason help me god bless you [Music] hallelujah oh lord let everything we say oh lord [Music] let everything i pursue be pleasing oh lord oh yes please let me be pleasing to you and everything that i do be pleasing let everything i pursue be pleasing oh lord let that be our prayer tonight lord give me the knowledge give me the wisdom lord the decisions i'm fixing to make the things i'm fixing to say or do lord would it be pleasing to you lord and if it's not pleasing to him then realize that satan would anoint us with that rod of pride that we feel justified we feel that we have a reason we can say or do i ask you as your brother in christ just stop let our own thinking let our own hearts thoughts our own nature just die and come to the place and we say lord what is it you want me to say what is it you want me to do lord what would i do with my hands what would i do with my feet because lord i want to be pleasing to you i don't want to explain or justify my own nature lord i want my nature to die and i want your nature to live [Music] i spoke direct to your saints tonight [Music] i joked about offending and i i'm sorry i never want to offend the son or daughter of god but sometimes we must speak directly sometimes i just have to follow what god's laid on my heart [Music] lord fill us with your knowledge fill us lord with your wisdom fill us lord with your spirit lord lord don't let this church take my spirit lord don't let this church take the spirit of nampa idaho or laodicea lord let us be unrelenting unstoppable filled with your spirit claiming your promise lord [Music] lord help us to understand [Music] what a glorious life it is to live in the liberty of jesus christ not burdened by our flesh not burnt by our own but the liberty in you [Music] i know it was the blood oh hallelujah i know it was the blood it certainly wasn't no intellectual thing saints [Music] it was the blood of jesus christ that come made all the difference it isn't how many quotes we can memorize it's him oh hallelujah flee to him there's our liberty there's our security there's our deliverance [Music] i know it was a blood i know it wasn't love i know it was a blood for me one day when i was lost he died upon the cross i know it was a blood for me well there's power in the blood there's power in the blood there's power in the blood day when i was lost he died upon the cross there's power in the block for me there's healing in the blood there's healing in the blood there's healing in the blood there is healing in the blood well there's deliverance in the blood deliverance in the blood there's deliverance in the blood for me one day when i was lost he died upon the cause there's deliverance in the blood for me i know it was i know hallelujah you believe that wonder working power he could take a sinner such as i amen take me from my sin take me for my unbelief oh my brother and sister you know what's scary we often talk about how miserable the cinder is but sometimes god catches people that are perfectly happy in their sin [Music] and he draws them out of that because they realize they found something much greater than what satan can offer i'll tell you what my brother and sister you can be just as happy no lucky you can be just as whatever and just be as lost as lost and be lost and god come along and say you really want to be happy and something down inside of them sparks and at that moment they realize i'm really not happy and for the sake of time i'm just going to paraphrase it to you the scripture says here that after all the laughter there's still a heaviness that settles upon humanity oh god there is powers [Music] yes there is there's wonderful power in the blood yes there is [Music] there's power in there's wonderful power in the block there is a there's his praises to sing there's wonderful power in of the land there is of the land [Applause] [Music] all right there's no announcement so you're dismissed in jesus name shake hands with one another say god bless you time change sunday that's right spring forward hour ahead all right well our smartphones which are something smarter than us should change but if not remember an hour forward
