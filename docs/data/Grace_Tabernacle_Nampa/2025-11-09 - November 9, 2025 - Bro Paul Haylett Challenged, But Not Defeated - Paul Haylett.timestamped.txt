[7:56] [music]
[8:00] Amen. It is mine. Praise God. Amen. I
[8:04] want to read something to you real
[8:05] quick. read [music] it the other morning
[8:08] and thought this was pretty good. Um,
[8:11] Proverbs 12:25 [music]
[8:13] says, "Heavenness in the heart of a man
[8:15] maketh it stoop, but a good word [music]
[8:18] maketh it glad." Right? Okay. Keep that
[8:21] in mind.
[8:31] Modern research says that hearing a kind
[8:33] word releases dopamine, serotonin, and
[8:36] oxytocin, [music]
[8:37] the same neurochemicals and depressants
[8:40] try to mimic. God wasn't saying be nice.
[8:43] He's [music] saying chemically
[8:45] recalibrate each other with speech. You
[8:48] could literally talk someone off a ledge
[8:50] with a well-timed compliment and we
[8:52] waste [music] that power on sarcasm and
[8:54] memes. Let's turn around, shake one
[8:57] another's hand, and say the best thing
[8:58] you can say to him. [music] God bless
[8:59] you. Amen.
[9:02] Hallelujah.
[9:06] [music]
[9:10] Make sure we're all calibrated this
[9:12] morning. [music] God bless you.
[9:20] Amen. [music] Number 649 at the cross.
[9:31] Oh,
[9:33] and did my [music and singing] Savior
[9:36] bleed? And did my sovereign
[9:40] [music and singing]
[9:41] die?
[9:43] Could he devote that [music]
[9:47] sacred [singing] head for such a worm as
[9:53] I
[9:55] at [music and singing] the cross at the
[9:58] cross where I first saw the light and
[10:02] the burdens of [music and singing] my
[10:04] heart rolled away.
[10:08] It was there by [music] faith I received
[10:12] my sight [singing] and now I am happy
[10:17] all the day.
[10:20] Was [music and singing] it for crimes
[10:23] that I have done? He groaned upon the
[10:29] tree.
[10:32] Amazing [music]
[10:34] pity, [singing]
[10:36] grace unknown, and love beyond [music]
[10:41] degree.
[10:44] At the cross, at [music] the cross where
[10:47] I first saw [singing] the light and the
[10:51] burdens [music] of my heart rolled away.
[10:56] It was [music and singing] there by
[10:58] faith I received my sight and now I
[11:04] [music and singing] am happy all the
[11:06] day.
[11:08] Well [music] might the sun in [singing]
[11:12] darkness high [music]
[11:14] and shut his glories
[11:18] in.
[11:19] [music]
[11:20] And Christ the mighty
[11:24] maker [music]
[11:25] died for man [singing] the creature sin.
[11:32] At the cross [music and singing] at the
[11:34] cross where I first saw the light and
[11:38] the burdens [singing and music] of my
[11:40] heart roll away.
[11:44] It [music] was there by faith I received
[11:49] my [music] sight. And now I am happy
[11:53] [singing] all the day.
[11:56] The drops of grief can
[11:59] [music and singing] never repay. The
[12:03] debt of love [music] I owe.
[12:08] Near [singing] Lord, I give [music]
[12:11] myself
[12:13] away is all that [singing] I [music]
[12:17] can do.
[12:20] At the cross, at [singing and music] the
[12:22] cross where I first saw the light and
[12:26] [singing and music] the burden of my
[12:28] heart rolled away.
[12:32] It [music] was there by faith. I
[12:35] received my sight. And now I am happy
[12:41] [music and singing] all the day.
[12:45] Amen.
[12:46] Amen. Hallelujah.
[12:50] Forgot to tell you that was part of an
[12:51] article I read. It was about um you know
[12:53] people trying to disprove Christianity
[12:55] in the Bible and such. And um he gave
[13:00] several examples and that was just one
[13:01] of them of how [music]
[13:03] we've already been given this
[13:04] instruction. We've already been given
[13:05] these things and all it [music] does is
[13:07] prove it further.
[13:10] He created the science. He knows it.
[13:13] Hallelujah.
[13:14] Amen. I love it. I love it. Amen.
[13:17] [music] Amen. As we get ready to go to
[13:20] uh prayer this morning, I'd like to sing
[13:21] that little chorus. I keep falling in
[13:23] love with him [music] and I can't even
[13:24] read my own number. I think it's 355.
[13:31] Let's just stand. Sing [music] this to
[13:32] him this morning. Amen. You love him.
[13:34] Hallelujah.
[13:38] I keep [music] falling in [singing] love
[13:40] with him over and over [music] and over
[13:45] and [singing] over again.
[13:49] Keep [music]
[13:49] falling in love with him over and
[13:53] [singing] over and over and over again.

[30:17] &gt;&gt; Jehovah
[30:19] Shammer,

[30:26] me.
[30:29] You supply
[30:33] all [singing]
[30:34] my
[30:36] need.
[30:40] You [singing] are more than enough.
[30:45] [music]
[30:48] more
[30:49] than enough.
[30:52] You [music and singing]

[31:59] [music] holy

[32:04] worship him this morning.
[32:08] We fall [singing] down. We lay our crown
[32:14] at [music] the feet [singing]
[32:17] of Jesus.
[32:20] The [music and singing] greatness of his
[32:23] mercy and love at the feet

[32:35] holy.

[32:43] And we cry holy, [singing]
[32:46] holy, [music] holy
[32:49] is the lamb. [music]
[32:56] We fall [music] down. We [singing] lay
[33:00] our crown at the feet
[33:04] of [singing]
[33:05] [music] Jesus.
[33:08] The greatness of his mercy
[33:11] [music and singing] and love at the feet
[33:16] [music] of Jesus. [singing]

[33:49] at the feet
[33:52] of [music] Jesus.
[33:55] the greatness [singing] of
[33:58] [music] your mercy and love at the feet
[34:03] [singing] of [music] Jesus.
[34:06] And we cry holy, holy,
[34:10] [music and singing] holy.
[34:12] And we cry holy, holy,
[34:16] holy. [music]
[34:18] And we [singing] cry holy, holy, holy
[34:24] is the lamb.
[34:29] Hallelujah.
[34:33] Amen.
[34:36] Amen. [music] He is worthy.
[34:39] He is worthy.
[34:42] Blessed be [music] his holy name.
[34:51] Hallelujah.
[34:52] As we ask our brother [music] Paul to
[34:53] come this morning, one last song here.
[34:57] Amen.
[34:59] Number 699.
[35:06] [music]
[35:07] As your soul longeth after him this
[35:09] morning. More
[35:12] more of you, Lord Jesus. more of you.
[35:16] Nothing else matters.
[35:19] Amen.
[35:22] As the deer [singing]
[35:26] panteth [music]
[35:27] for
[35:29] the water [singing]
[35:31] so my soul
[35:34] longeth I [music] after [singing] thee.
[35:43] You [singing] alone
[35:46] on [music] my heart
[35:50] desire
[35:52] and I long
[35:55] to worship
[35:59] thee.
[36:00] [music]
[36:04] You you alone [music]
[36:08] are my strength, my shield.
[36:14] To you [music and singing]
[36:16] alone
[36:19] does my spirit
[36:23] yield. [music]
[36:28] You are alone on [music and singing]
[36:33] my heart.
[36:36] Desire
[36:38] and I [music and singing] long
[36:41] to worship
[36:45] thee.
[36:51] You're my friend
[36:55] and you are
[36:58] my [music]
[36:59] brother.
[37:00] Even though
[37:03] you [singing]
[37:04] are
[37:06] a king.
[37:08] [music]
[37:13] I want you more than [music and singing]
[37:18] any
[37:20] any other
[37:22] so [music] much [singing] more
[37:25] than any.
[37:34] [music] You [singing] alone
[37:38] are my strength, my shield. [music]
[37:44] To you alone
[37:48] [music]
[37:49] does my spirit.
[37:52] [singing]
[37:56] [music]
[37:59] You alone
[38:03] [singing] are my homes.
[38:06] Desire
[38:09] and I [music and singing] long
[38:12] to worship
[38:15] thee. [music]
[38:21] I want [singing]
[38:23] [music] you more than anyone
[38:28] [music] or silver
[38:30] only you
[38:34] can satisfy.
[38:37] [singing]
[38:43] You alone
[38:47] are [music] the real
[38:50] joy giver
[38:52] and the [music]
[38:53] eye
[38:55] pull [singing] of
[38:58] [music] my heart.
[39:04] You alone
[39:08] [music]
[39:09] are my strength,
[39:11] my sh
[39:20] my [music]
[39:29] you [singing]
[39:31] are alone
[39:34] are my hearts [music]
[39:37] desire
[39:39] and our own
[39:42] to worship.
[39:48] Can we just take a moment [music] just
[39:49] lift our hands and our hearts to the
[39:51] Lord and just give thanksgiving to him.
[39:54] How good he is to us. [music]
[39:57] Such a comforter, such a provider, a
[40:00] confidant. He brings peace to us in our
[40:04] times of trouble. He gives faith in our
[40:07] heart to believe the word of [music] God
[40:10] and then rewards us for believing. Oh,
[40:13] how thankful we are, Lord. How [snorts]
[40:16] we bless you, Lord [music] Jesus, today.
[40:19] Your grace and mercy. Oh Lord, you've
[40:23] poured it out in abundance upon us.
[40:25] [music] And Lord, we just lift our hands
[40:27] and our hearts today, Lord, to say thank
[40:30] you, Father, that Lord, you have chosen
[40:33] us. And Lord, how that you had called
[40:35] us, Father, [music] you made us part of
[40:38] your plan, Father. It was not an
[40:40] accident, but it was intentional. And we
[40:43] are here the recipients of the greatest
[40:45] gift ever given to mankind. We say thank
[40:49] you and bless your holy name today,
[40:52] Lord. Let us live lives that are worthy.
[40:55] Father, let our lives be a testament of
[40:57] you. Father, we ask [music] in your
[41:00] precious name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[41:05] Amen.
[41:08] Don't really have any other notes.
[41:10] [music] Um, Sister Jerry and I will uh
[41:14] be leaving in a couple days uh to the
[41:17] Netherlands and Belgium. Uh, you might
[41:20] call it a working holiday. There'll be
[41:22] days for us just to enjoy uh some
[41:25] special meetings and to be speaking in
[41:27] meetings and uh so just desire your
[41:31] prayers. Amen. a quote. I should have
[41:34] printed it or included it, but I just
[41:37] read this morning and brother Brandham
[41:39] says that he says, "I know when I'm
[41:41] here, these people are praying for me
[41:43] and those over there are praying for me
[41:46] and these here are praying for me." And
[41:49] he says, "When I go forth, I can go
[41:51] forth in confidence knowing I'm
[41:54] surrounded by prayer."
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I just thought it was so
[41:58] beautiful to to be able to walk through
[42:01] this life knowing that we have brothers
[42:03] and sisters, saints of like precious
[42:05] faith [snorts] that are praying for us.
[42:08] We're praying for you. Amen. That we can
[42:10] walk in that confidence that we are
[42:12] surrounded with prayer. And so [snorts]
[42:15] uh we appreciate that and look forward.
[42:17] Brother David will be ministering for
[42:19] you. Amen. Be praying for him. Amen. And
[42:23] so we just look for that. Uh with the
[42:25] chaos that's uh in the airports and
[42:28] whatever, uh [snorts] we're just
[42:29] believing the Lord will make everything
[42:31] work out just right and uh be able to
[42:34] go. I want to speak to you. Thank you so
[42:36] much. Enjoyed the music this morning,
[42:38] the special song. Amen. Uh just uh
[42:42] always enjoy those. Uh I want to speak
[42:45] to you this morning on challenged but
[42:48] not defeated. Amen. [snorts] And we
[42:50] would just go in our Bibles out of the
[42:52] book of Isaiah uh 41:es
[42:57] 9 and 10. And I just thought this was
[43:00] such a lovely scripture for uh it is
[43:04] there that we look in the word of God
[43:06] and we are continually reminded uh of
[43:10] what God thinks of us and how he is
[43:13] dealing with us and what he wants to to
[43:17] do for us. Amen. Amen. Do you do you
[43:20] believe that he is your provider today?
[43:23] Everything that we have need of. And
[43:26] understand this, we're not going to
[43:27] preach some kind of prosperity gospel,
[43:30] but the Lord actually sometimes just
[43:33] gives you things you des just desire,
[43:36] right? He says if you what you desire,
[43:38] you ask in my name and I'll give it to
[43:41] you. So sometimes even just in natural
[43:43] realm of life, he just gives us things
[43:46] that we desire. And and [snorts] I I
[43:48] thank the Lord for that. Amen. I don't I
[43:50] don't think that uh worldly fame or
[43:53] riches is the heart of a son or daughter
[43:55] of God. But I believe that as it is more
[43:58] of him is something that we just long
[44:01] for, desire from our hearts. Amen.
[44:04] Isaiah 41 9 and 10.
[44:08] Thou whom I have taken from the ends of
[44:11] the earth, and called thee from the
[44:14] chief men thereof, and said unto thee,
[44:17] Thou art my servant. I have chosen thee,
[44:21] and not cast thee away. Fear thou not,
[44:24] for I am with thee. Be not dismayed, for
[44:27] I am thy God. I will strengthen thee,
[44:30] yay, I will help thee, yay, I will
[44:34] uphold thee with the right hand of my
[44:37] righteousness. Now one thing I would add
[44:39] to this scripture here we are in the Old
[44:41] Testament. Now we know saints that we
[44:44] are not servants. We are sons and
[44:48] daughters. Amen. But we can still take
[44:50] the very context of this scripture
[44:53] because we are servants that we're
[44:55] called to serve him.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So even though we have another
[45:00] rightful position in the economy of God,
[45:03] we are here to serve him. And I say
[45:05] thank you Lord for this opportunity.
[45:08] Heavenly Father, we ask you just come in
[45:10] the service today Lord. It's just good
[45:13] to be in the house of God amongst saints
[45:15] of like precious faith Lord to have you
[45:18] come and speak to our hearts and Lord to
[45:21] correct us Lord and to give guidance to
[45:24] us Father [snorts] for we would be like
[45:26] children Lord and we would go astray
[45:29] thinking we're in the right way but we
[45:31] are being trained up. We have masters
[45:34] placed over us as children. [snorts] We
[45:36] have parents. We have leadership. And
[45:38] Lord, we're here today for the
[45:40] leadership of your Holy Spirit to move
[45:42] in our midst and give us guidance and
[45:44] direction. Father, we thank you for this
[45:47] opportunity to serve you. Lord, [snorts]
[45:49] we just ask you to bless each and every
[45:51] one those who are not here today.
[45:53] whatever circumstance might be, may your
[45:55] holy spirit just move down in their
[45:57] midst and Lord comfort and give peace
[46:00] and lord just help them in their
[46:02] journey. We ask these things from the
[46:04] depths of our heart, the desire of our
[46:06] heart in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[46:10] You may be seated this morning.
[46:16] Now, as we would look into the word
[46:18] today, I would just like for us to to
[46:24] just kind of dig back. This is nothing
[46:26] real deep. These are things that we just
[46:29] know. These are things that that u we
[46:32] have heard ministered through the years.
[46:35] Amen. Should be there in the reservoir
[46:37] of knowledge that the Lord would give us
[46:39] the ability to have. Amen. We serve an
[46:43] omnisient God. Amen. an all- knowing
[46:45] God. And uh the beautiful thing about
[46:48] that is as we uh are here knowing that
[46:51] God knows all things, he knows your
[46:53] problems. Amen. He knows your good days
[46:55] from your bad days. He knows every
[46:57] struggle that we have ever faced. And
[47:00] when we come into that, sometimes Satan
[47:02] would come and he would try to tell you,
[47:04] "You're all alone. You're the only one
[47:06] that's got this problem. Nobody cares."
[47:08] But my brother and sister, we'll have to
[47:10] remember that we have to go back to the
[47:13] original word. And when we go back to
[47:15] the original word, we'll find that the
[47:18] original word was truth. Amen. That
[47:20] Satan's uh thoughts, his words were
[47:22] something that come along after the
[47:25] fact. Amen. And so all through the
[47:27] scripture, we see God choosing. Now,
[47:29] [snorts] some people would say we don't
[47:31] believe in predestination. Uh and their
[47:33] idea of predestination is God forcing,
[47:36] like God making you serve him. But we
[47:38] look at this and understand the real uh
[47:42] uh choice or whatever it is. Um I
[47:45] struggle for word right there. Uh that
[47:47] we see that God is doing the choosing.
[47:49] Amen. As it is, no man has come to God,
[47:52] but God has always called man and wooed
[47:55] man to him. So we get the idea that I
[47:57] come to a place I decided I was going to
[48:00] serve God. The only way you could serve
[48:02] him was that he called you. Amen.
[48:04] Without that calling, there's nothing.
[48:06] We see God choosing. Now, as it goes, my
[48:10] brother and sister, we see examples, to
[48:12] keep it brief, Cain and Abel. Amen. We
[48:15] see uh there that that how that God
[48:18] already knew what was going to happen.
[48:20] Already knew how that would be. He
[48:22] already had the word for Cain that uh if
[48:26] you would just do good. Amen. But you
[48:28] see, Cain had already made up his mind.
[48:30] He had already had something he believed
[48:32] was the way that he was going to go and
[48:35] that was the way that was right. And so
[48:37] we see Jacob and Esau and we see
[48:40] different examples through the scripture
[48:42] and we see God choosing and he chooses
[48:45] when he chooses where and he chooses
[48:48] who. And when we think about that it
[48:51] takes a lot of the things out of our
[48:53] life that we might have question marks
[48:56] about. we we would see that uh you know
[48:59] we feel like that uh I come to a certain
[49:02] stage of my life and it just seems like
[49:04] I had no options. Well my brother and
[49:07] sister God knew now pardon me for saying
[49:09] it so bluntly but some of us are just a
[49:12] little more stubborn uh determined no
[49:15] stubborn [snorts] uh than others. Amen.
[49:18] And God knew exactly what it would take
[49:19] to catch our attention.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's there at that time that
[49:24] that God says, "You've went far enough
[49:27] down this journey, down this road, the
[49:29] the wrong road." I've I've shared with
[49:31] you, my brothers and sisters, about
[49:33] Artisia, New Mexico, and you come into
[49:35] town from the north and there's a weird
[49:38] multi-road intersection there. And the
[49:41] two roads that are directly in front of
[49:43] you, when someone says, "Come to the
[49:44] intersection and go straight," there's
[49:47] no such thing as straight in that
[49:49] intersection. you come and you go
[49:51] slightly to the right or slightly to the
[49:53] left and it doesn't seem like much at
[49:55] that point where they intersect, but you
[49:57] travel a few miles down the road and you
[50:00] are miles and miles apart from each
[50:02] other. And so it was there obviously
[50:04] Paul chose the wrong straight and uh
[50:07] drove for miles and had to uh manage to
[50:10] turn around and go back. But you see,
[50:13] God is here and he'll let us go down
[50:15] that other road for a distance and
[50:18] [snorts] and but he'll always correct
[50:20] us. We're sons and daughters of God
[50:21] today, right? Can we say amen this
[50:24] morning? We are sons and daughters of
[50:26] God. We're not here. That's
[50:27] non-negotiable, Satan. This is not
[50:29] something you can convince us
[50:31] differently. We are sons and daughters
[50:33] of God. We'll walk the wrong road for a
[50:36] ways, but he has promised, "I'll never
[50:38] leave you. I'll never forsake you." He
[50:41] always will turn us around and bring us
[50:43] back to the place he wants us to be. And
[50:47] so it's there that we'll look at this
[50:49] and in the when, where, and who. Now
[50:52] look at what the when is now my brother
[50:54] and sister. It's been preached to us.
[50:56] It's one of my topics I really like to
[50:58] touch on every once in a while. And here
[51:00] we go again. Amen. When were we in
[51:03] Christ?
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world. Now,
[51:08] I want to put this out to you so that
[51:11] you can grasp this correctly. When we'll
[51:14] look at it, seeing it correctly, you
[51:17] were chosen in Jesus Christ before
[51:20] Lucifer even existed.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; I want you to ponder that
[51:26] &gt;&gt; the one who's trying to convince you,
[51:29] follow me, didn't even exist when God
[51:32] chose you.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You talk about a a real blessing.
[51:37] Amen. It's there even before creation.
[51:41] Before the foundation of the world,
[51:42] before creation, you were in Jesus
[51:45] Christ. Amen. So there it was. You were
[51:48] in thought form, not in a physical form,
[51:50] but in thought form. Amen. So as we'll
[51:53] look at this, we can come into Ephesians
[51:55] 1 [snorts] and 4. Amen. It says here,
[51:59] according as he has chosen us in him
[52:02] before the foundation of the world. You
[52:04] go back through that and you'll find it
[52:07] anchors back before the creation of the
[52:10] world that we should be holy and without
[52:12] blame before him in love. Amen. So he
[52:16] chose us in him, but he also chose us to
[52:20] be holy and without blame. So it was his
[52:24] choice that he would view us as holy. It
[52:26] was his choice to view us as without
[52:29] blame. So sometimes when the devil's
[52:32] kind of beating on you, and I know he
[52:33] probably doesn't bother you guys very
[52:35] much. Amen. Probably has other places to
[52:38] go and other things to do. But to those
[52:41] that he persed
[52:45] that he has not been the original
[52:48] thought, never will be the original
[52:50] thought. You were one of the original
[52:53] thoughts of God. Amen. Lucifer was a
[52:57] thought that came after you were in
[52:59] God's mind. Amen. So it's there. He has
[53:02] predestinated us. Now this is not forced
[53:05] us having forced us into adoption. No,
[53:09] he did not force us into adoption. Amen.
[53:12] He called us and we responded into
[53:15] adoption. Amen. and the adoption of
[53:18] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[53:20] according to the good pleasure of his
[53:22] will through the praise of the glory of
[53:25] his grace wherein he hath made us
[53:28] accepted. Can we say the word accepted
[53:30] this morning? Accepted. Amen. Amen. Has
[53:34] made us accepted in the beloved. Now I
[53:37] want you to catch this because this will
[53:39] be the theme of our thought this
[53:40] morning. Amen. You're not working for
[53:43] acceptance. You're not trying to be
[53:45] accepted. You have already been
[53:49] accepted.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, who can lift a hand and say, "Thank
[53:52] you, Lord, that I'm already accepted in
[53:55] Jesus Christ." Amen. This is not a labor
[53:58] of works. This is not a labor, but it is
[54:01] of love. Amen. That we can come and say,
[54:04] "Thank you, Lord, that you saw that I
[54:06] would be accepted."
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we're right back to the where
[54:11] still takes us back to Ephesians. Amen.
[54:14] Where were we?
[54:16] &gt;&gt; In him.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you are part of Jesus Christ.
[54:22] Period. It's not an addition. It's not
[54:25] added on. It's not something that's been
[54:27] an addendum to, but a part of the
[54:30] original word. Amen. According as he has
[54:33] chosen us in him. Amen. So, look at
[54:36] that. Now, look at the word us. It's
[54:39] really hard to find a definition for the
[54:41] word us because it goes into complicated
[54:43] English and etc etc and [snorts] uh but
[54:47] it is a plural word.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Denoting plurality. So us is more
[54:53] than one.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's also an inclusive word.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Could be used in the phrase of us and
[55:02] them.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Or just us.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; So very inclusive. So when we'll look at
[55:08] the scripture, we'll realize what God
[55:11] has said here in the word according as
[55:14] he has chosen us a very inclusive. And
[55:19] when something is inclusive, it's only
[55:21] you might say one short step to say that
[55:24] it is exclusive.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Because if it's only us,
[55:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Then it's exclusive. Amen.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; It's not that someone else can come and
[55:35] say I'm now part of the us.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; So when you look at that my brother and
[55:40] sister, here is the word of God defining
[55:43] that there is a group of people. Amen.
[55:46] And it's only that group of people that
[55:49] God is defining by this word. Amen. And
[55:53] I say, let's lift a hand and say thank
[55:54] you this morning, Lord, that you would
[55:57] include us before the foundation as a
[56:00] thought in you from the very beginning.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is so beautiful. Amen. Oh,
[56:07] look at the time. You say, "Well, how
[56:09] long you been a Christian?" Oh, it's
[56:11] been 10 years, 20 years, 30 years. How
[56:14] long have you been a Christian?
[56:17] Eternity.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Look at that. You've been in him from
[56:20] the beginning. There was actually when
[56:22] you were in Christ Jesus in the
[56:24] beginning, there was no beginning
[56:26] because he's eternal.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; And so if you were in him in the
[56:30] beginning, that means you are an eternal
[56:32] creature. Amen. You might look at time
[56:35] and say, "Look, you know, my my time on
[56:38] earth, the years, they add up. I get to
[56:40] be old, elderly, etc., etc." Forget that
[56:44] mindset, my brother and sister. That's
[56:46] just a little journey that we spend here
[56:48] on this earth. But look at who we were.
[56:51] We always were in him and will always be
[56:54] in him. And he is eternal. You are an
[56:57] eternal being. This is a flicker.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Thank you, Lord.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Now, there's an old saying often defined
[57:07] uh concerning a man and a woman in a
[57:09] relationship of two hearts beating as
[57:13] one.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Now, I want you to look
[57:15] at this and think for a moment. All the
[57:17] way back through eternity, even when we
[57:19] were just in thought form, our heart was
[57:22] beating already in Christ. Amen. And I
[57:25] I'll reinforce this a little bit with a
[57:27] quote here just to to kind of give you
[57:30] an idea of the platform. But you look at
[57:32] this, my brother and sister. So, even
[57:34] though you didn't exist in this human
[57:37] form, your heart in the mind of God was
[57:40] beating. And he knows how many beats
[57:43] your heart will ever make. Amen. Kind of
[57:45] like the Chinese doctor. He says,
[57:48] "Exercise is a waste of time. Your heart
[57:51] only beats so many times and it is
[57:54] finished."
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Now think about that. Amen. But God knew
[57:58] and he has given everything that he
[58:01] thought we would need into our life for
[58:05] its duration. And one thing he knows
[58:08] that we need in our duration is the
[58:11] word.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he poured the word into you and
[58:14] I [snorts] that it would be there
[58:16] sufficient for this journey that we
[58:18] have. Amen. So he spoke us out of his
[58:21] thoughts and into creation.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; So it's there that it's not that when we
[58:27] were in his thoughts that we had to have
[58:29] a physical body all the way back in
[58:32] time. But God's thoughts are so
[58:34] complete, my brother and sister. He knew
[58:36] exactly. Now, I I'm going to go back.
[58:39] This is something that just has kind of
[58:40] been on my mind lately. Amen. This is
[58:43] why all of this nonsense that they have
[58:46] with biotechnology,
[58:48] you know, people say, "Uh, doctor, we
[58:50] want to have a little blue-eyed boy."
[58:52] And they now have the ability to cause
[58:55] that to come and they would carry that
[58:57] embryo and have a little blue-eyed boy.
[58:59] And they're doing all that. But you see
[59:01] what they're doing? They're trying to
[59:03] play God and be there in thestead of
[59:06] God. Amen. And all of this
[59:09] identity stuff that unfortunately many
[59:13] young person in this day, well, not even
[59:15] young. Amen. Humanity is struggling with
[59:18] their identities. You see, really what
[59:20] it's done is Satan is coming wedging
[59:23] himself in there to say God didn't know
[59:26] what he was doing when he made you. And
[59:30] so the truth of it is God knew exactly
[59:32] what he was doing when he made you and
[59:34] I. Whether we're tall or we're short,
[59:37] whether we have what eye color, hair
[59:39] color, whether we are, you might say,
[59:41] kind of big or kind of little or what
[59:44] our stature would be, none of that is a
[59:46] mistake, my brother and sister. Every
[59:48] humanity, every person in humanity that
[59:51] ever come to a conclusion that there was
[59:53] a mistake. Why can't I look like this?
[59:56] Why can't I be like that? my brother and
[59:58] sister realize that's Satan trying to
[1:00:00] insert him into God's plan and cause
[1:00:04] doubt and cause uh all kinds of
[1:00:06] anxieties. And that's why I I really
[1:00:09] strongly speak this to young people.
[1:00:12] Amen. Is that when God made you like you
[1:00:15] are, you are beautiful in God's sight.
[1:00:17] And that is the only sight that really
[1:00:20] matters. Amen. Is that you recognize you
[1:00:23] are what you are by God's grace.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so the world today is got
[1:00:28] little 12, 10, 12 year old girls putting
[1:00:31] on the makeup, putting on all this stuff
[1:00:34] and they're trying to dress them up. The
[1:00:35] girls are trying to compete with each
[1:00:37] other. Boys are trying to compete with
[1:00:39] each other. My brother and sister, what
[1:00:41] it really is is the devil's trying to
[1:00:43] compete with God.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the real truth of it right
[1:00:47] there. He's trying to get in, trying to
[1:00:49] possess. Amen. So he spoke us out of his
[1:00:53] thoughts into creation. Now, I want you
[1:00:56] to understand this. When he spoke you
[1:00:58] out of his thoughts, he didn't speak you
[1:01:00] as chaff.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; No, that's right.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; He spoke you as gold.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. We see the scripture says that
[1:01:08] everything will be tried in the fire.
[1:01:10] Amen. Those things made out of chaff and
[1:01:13] straw will be consumed. Those things
[1:01:15] made out of gold will be purified. And
[1:01:17] that's what God's doing today, right
[1:01:19] now, through the word. He's purifying
[1:01:22] you and I. He's not going to burn us up
[1:01:24] and we be cast away. Amen. It's just
[1:01:27] ashes on the ground. But he's brought us
[1:01:29] as sons and daughters of God to let the
[1:01:31] word of God purify us in this hour.
[1:01:34] Amen. I tell you what, I can say thank
[1:01:36] you, Lord. We're not the people we used
[1:01:38] to be. God is changing us. He is He is
[1:01:41] baking out all the unbelief and all of
[1:01:44] the impurity. He's working it out of us.
[1:01:47] Amen. And we are coming, as the
[1:01:49] scripture says, as fine gold. Not just
[1:01:52] gold, my brother and sister. You can
[1:01:53] have a piece of gold that is just it can
[1:01:56] have all kinds of pyites and and all
[1:01:59] this other stuff in it and it's gold,
[1:02:01] but it's not pure gold. And it takes a
[1:02:04] refiner's fire. And somebody ought to
[1:02:06] say, "Thank you, Lord, for a refiner's
[1:02:08] fire." I don't want to [snorts] just
[1:02:10] say, "Look, I'm not chaff. I'm gold."
[1:02:12] But if we're not pure gold,
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That means God's got to send us to
[1:02:16] a fire and he's got to bring out the
[1:02:19] impurity.
[1:02:21] Now, let's just go right here into uh
[1:02:24] the sermon Abraham and his seed after
[1:02:27] him. I want [snorts] to touch on a
[1:02:29] couple things here. Now, I want you to
[1:02:32] remember. Now, some people get offended
[1:02:34] over this. I've had people get offended.
[1:02:37] I sat in church and basically was told,
[1:02:39] "I'm an unbeliever." Why did you Where
[1:02:41] did you get that thought? Where did that
[1:02:44] thought come from? Why did you not pick
[1:02:46] of those things? Look, let's look this
[1:02:49] morning. We have three choices this
[1:02:51] morning. You do. It's not my choice.
[1:02:54] It's not anybody else's choice. It's
[1:02:56] your choice to decide who you are.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:07] Three classes of people in the world.
[1:03:09] Always has been and will be to the end.
[1:03:11] Now, let's say that together. Three
[1:03:14] classes of people. unbelievers make
[1:03:17] believers and believers. People get
[1:03:20] offended with that because somehow it's
[1:03:22] implied to them that they're not a
[1:03:25] believer.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Now, who's going to imply to you you're
[1:03:28] not a believer?
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; The one who created you before the
[1:03:34] foundation of the world spoke you into
[1:03:36] existence. Is he going to say you're an
[1:03:38] unbeliever?
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Is he going to tell you you're a
[1:03:41] makebeliever? No. By the very creative
[1:03:45] power of God, he made you as a believer.
[1:03:49] Amen. It's Satan that's come in there
[1:03:51] planting a seed. Amen. As the tears
[1:03:54] amongst the wheat, he's planted a seed.
[1:03:57] And if you grow up and there's a tear
[1:03:59] beside you and you don't bother to look
[1:04:01] for other wheat, you might actually grow
[1:04:03] up thinking you're a tear.
[1:04:07] Remember, it's all about atmosphere and
[1:04:08] environment.
[1:04:11] But if you'll look up.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; I can tell you from being a farmer
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; that until the head comes forth, it's
[1:04:21] very hard to tell the difference between
[1:04:24] wheat and wild oats.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; But sooner or later, the evidence has to
[1:04:30] come out.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; It doesn't come out at the feet.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; It doesn't come out at the legs. It
[1:04:35] doesn't come out at the torso, as it
[1:04:38] were. It comes out in the head
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; and there it is in the end. It always
[1:04:43] comes out. Well, I know I followed the
[1:04:46] message for 40 years, but I just can't
[1:04:49] believe that
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; it's coming out of the head.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. That means for 40 years they had
[1:04:55] an intellectual understanding of where
[1:04:58] they stood in the economy of God because
[1:05:00] God didn't bring people. He didn't
[1:05:02] create you, my brother and sister. And I
[1:05:04] hope this soaks into some of you's
[1:05:06] hearts. He didn't bring you this far to
[1:05:08] then come and say, "I guess I made a
[1:05:11] mistake and you're a tear after all."
[1:05:13] Everything from your roots, amen,
[1:05:16] through everything of your stock up
[1:05:18] through coming. And you being wheat will
[1:05:21] put forth a head that will be wheat. And
[1:05:24] in that head is a comprehension or
[1:05:26] understanding of the word of God. In
[1:05:29] other words, revelation that I always
[1:05:31] was. Hallelujah. I always was weak.
[1:05:35] Amen. It wasn't when I finally come to a
[1:05:37] head and produced a head that I became
[1:05:40] wheat. I always was wheat and I am now
[1:05:44] in a season to manifest this.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; The sun is shining on me. I've got
[1:05:48] moisture to grow in the water of the
[1:05:51] word. And now it is just proving what's
[1:05:54] always been in my heart. I am a seed of
[1:05:56] God.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Three classes of
[1:06:00] people. Now the class that was elected
[1:06:03] before the foundation of the world were
[1:06:04] called in Christ before the foundation
[1:06:06] of the world. How many knows that Christ
[1:06:08] was the lamb of God slain before the
[1:06:11] foundation of the world? I believe every
[1:06:13] one of us can lift our hand and say we
[1:06:14] know that. Well, how was he slain? In
[1:06:18] God's great program, he knowed he would
[1:06:21] he would project a son and that son
[1:06:24] would be the savior of his people. Is
[1:06:26] that right? So when God speaks a thing,
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; it's already finished. [snorts]
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; You can stop today and say, "I've got
[1:06:38] this little sin in my life. I've got
[1:06:40] this little struggle in my life. I've
[1:06:42] got this situation in my life." When God
[1:06:45] put it out there and spoke it, he said,
[1:06:47] "It's already finished."
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't stop here and look at
[1:06:52] what's wrong with you. I want you today,
[1:06:54] saints, to look at what is right with
[1:06:56] you.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; You're called of God. That right there
[1:06:59] gives you everything you need to come
[1:07:02] forth, and it will come to fruition. And
[1:07:06] in the end, you will prove who you are.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my, my brother and sister. You see,
[1:07:12] it's not he who starts the race, it's he
[1:07:15] who finishes the race.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; And we are finishers today by the grace
[1:07:21] of God. Hallelujah.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; So you look at this.
[1:07:28] Do you have any challenges in your life?
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Could we be honest this morning?
[1:07:34] You don't have to do it for my sake, but
[1:07:35] it might not hurt you to lift your hand
[1:07:37] and say, "I have challenges in my life.
[1:07:40] I have things I stumble and struggle
[1:07:42] with. I have things that I butt my head
[1:07:44] up against. Can't seem to get over." But
[1:07:47] I tell you, my brother and sister, God
[1:07:48] has said, "It's already finished. So
[1:07:51] quit laboring, quit struggling, quit
[1:07:54] worrying, quit getting bent out of
[1:07:56] shape. Amen. Relax and let God move in
[1:07:58] your life. Let God come and move you up
[1:08:01] over that hurdle. You can try to dig
[1:08:03] under it. You can try to crawl around
[1:08:05] it. You might try to climb over it your
[1:08:07] own self, but if you let go and let God,
[1:08:10] you will find that everything you need
[1:08:12] to get beyond that challenge will be
[1:08:14] taken care of.
[1:08:17] But let me warn you,
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; there'll be another challenge just
[1:08:20] beyond that one.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; There's not a one and done gospel.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; There's something you will fight
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; all the way to the finish.
[1:08:29] [snorts]
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Reminds me of a little deal I seen. It
[1:08:39] was a marathon.
[1:08:41] This individual wanted to win a marathon
[1:08:43] so bad along [snorts] the way they had
[1:08:46] stashed a little motor scooter and this
[1:08:49] marathon went out through the
[1:08:50] countryside and whatever and they got on
[1:08:53] their little scooter and they took a
[1:08:55] side road or two and passed everybody
[1:08:57] and ditched the scooter and come running
[1:09:00] across the finish line. Hardly broke a
[1:09:02] sweat.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; But the word says your sins will find
[1:09:08] you out.
[1:09:10] and somebody showed up and said, "You
[1:09:12] know, isn't it amazing the goods and
[1:09:14] bads right here is got as many demons
[1:09:17] contained in this little black case as
[1:09:19] there is on the face of the earth. But
[1:09:21] right here also is things and somebody
[1:09:24] comes to official." Sir, sir,
[1:09:27] is this your races jersey riding a
[1:09:31] motorcycle?
[1:09:34] Oh, look closer.
[1:09:38] You're not a winner, you're a cheater.
[1:09:42] They have almost the same amount of
[1:09:44] letters, but they don't mean the same
[1:09:46] thing. You see, my brother and sister,
[1:09:48] that's why God has called you and I.
[1:09:51] Now, this might seem like a kind of a
[1:09:53] paradoxical statement. But God didn't
[1:09:55] call you and I to try to teach our way
[1:09:58] to heaven. He called us to struggle, to
[1:10:01] run, to sweat. Amen. Spiritually have
[1:10:04] sore feet. Amen. spiritually have
[1:10:06] fatigued muscles, spiritually come to a
[1:10:09] place. Now look at all of Israel when
[1:10:11] they come face to face with uh Goliath,
[1:10:14] my brother and sister. They were there
[1:10:16] and and they were men if they had had
[1:10:19] enough faith could have went out and
[1:10:21] done exactly what David did. There were
[1:10:23] men in the multitude of the congregation
[1:10:25] of Israel that if they would have cried
[1:10:27] out to God and said, "God, this man is
[1:10:30] mocking you and we will not allow it. We
[1:10:34] are sons of God. you are our savior, our
[1:10:36] king, our lord, our god, and God would
[1:10:38] have anointed them. But you see, God had
[1:10:40] a plan for David down the road. He's got
[1:10:42] a plan for you down the road. Amen. And
[1:10:45] so what does he do? He doesn't anoint.
[1:10:47] This sounds really narrow. Sounds like
[1:10:49] I'm being very, very critical, but I
[1:10:52] don't mean it that way. He could
[1:10:53] anointed anyone outside in this city
[1:10:55] today, my brother and sister, to believe
[1:10:58] with faith like you do. But he chose you
[1:11:01] to go down and challenge the giant. He
[1:11:04] chose you to pick up the sword of the
[1:11:06] word and say, "You know what? You're not
[1:11:08] going to speak against my God like this.
[1:11:10] My Lord Jesus, my savior, you can't
[1:11:13] speak against him like that." And went
[1:11:15] down. But you see, anyone could. God
[1:11:18] honors faith.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; See, sometimes we get this idea, this
[1:11:22] just happens around the message. No, my
[1:11:23] brothers and sisters, there's healings
[1:11:25] taking places. There's deliverances
[1:11:27] taking place. All kinds of things
[1:11:29] happening out here that's not within our
[1:11:31] rank or our realm. But you see, God
[1:11:34] ultimately faith will take you so far
[1:11:37] that without predestination
[1:11:40] can lead you in a position that God will
[1:11:43] honor, but you won't be bride.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; I want to be bride this morning.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be his chosen. I want to
[1:11:50] sit there in his throne in the throne
[1:11:52] room. Amen. And be in his presence.
[1:11:55] Hallelujah.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Now, so when you look at this, I want to
[1:12:00] go back to this sentence. So when God
[1:12:02] speaks a thing,
[1:12:04] comma there, little space, pause,
[1:12:10] it's already finished.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; I think we need to stop and remember
[1:12:17] that it's already finished.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Now look what the impact should have on
[1:12:22] you and I.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; When God said, "I've called you."
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; That's it. from before the foundation of
[1:12:27] the world. We should say, "Lord, my
[1:12:30] flesh is causing me causing me problems,
[1:12:32] Lord, but what's inside of me is what
[1:12:35] matters." And that is already redeemed.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; That's already been sealed.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know if you guys are
[1:12:43] familiar with Brother Wes ordeal for
[1:12:46] many years. One, you might call it a
[1:12:47] signature song that our brother Wes
[1:12:49] sings, it's already done. Amen. My
[1:12:52] brother and sister, that song is a song
[1:12:55] actually that has more revelation in it
[1:12:57] than people want to acknowledge or do
[1:12:59] recognize. It's a testimony. It's
[1:13:02] already done. Amen. Amen. I I'm already
[1:13:06] sealed. My family's already sealed.
[1:13:08] Amen. We already have been called of
[1:13:11] Almighty God. God said it. It's
[1:13:13] finished.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a hope that we're looking
[1:13:17] to or WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO serve God.
[1:13:20] WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO BE A CHRISTIAN. WE
[1:13:22] ARE
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; I got it.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; I mean this impact it should have on us.
[1:13:31] Just go through every promise of God as
[1:13:33] you read the Bible, you read the word
[1:13:35] there. Every promise of God, you should
[1:13:38] say, you know what? Uh I haven't seen
[1:13:40] the manifestation maybe, but it's
[1:13:42] already done.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; It's already done.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; I'm already healed.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm already sealed. The word
[1:13:50] promised me THE HOLY GHOST. I'VE GOT THE
[1:13:52] HOLY GHOST.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Absolutely right.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; And Lord, bring this body to match my
[1:13:58] confession.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Now look, I want to ask you a question.
[1:14:05] How can you be defeated when he the lamb
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; said you are already victorious?
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that when we say, "Oh, I
[1:14:16] can't do it. I can't do it. I can't live
[1:14:17] it. I can't. I can't. I can. You're
[1:14:19] calling your Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:14:21] Christ a liar.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; You're saying that his word was
[1:14:24] insufficient to bring you to the place
[1:14:27] to complete the work he already began in
[1:14:30] you.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; We got a simple promise. This work I
[1:14:33] have begun in you. I, not the preacher,
[1:14:36] not the church, not the denomination,
[1:14:39] but I will finish it. Denoting a very
[1:14:42] personal relationship coming down as it
[1:14:45] is. May maybe you've saw this. you know,
[1:14:47] it's been around for years, but a man
[1:14:49] running in a race, I don't know, maybe a
[1:14:51] marathon or what it was, but literally
[1:14:53] collapses just like the length of this
[1:14:55] room from the finish line. And the man
[1:14:57] [snorts] that was behind him, comes
[1:14:59] right up on him, goes past him just a
[1:15:01] little bit, stops,
[1:15:04] turns around,
[1:15:06] picks this man up, gets him over his
[1:15:09] shoulder, and walks him up to the finish
[1:15:11] line. and about one foot short of the
[1:15:14] finish line supports him and pushes him
[1:15:17] across the finish line. Look, God could
[1:15:19] finish this race as we know it without
[1:15:22] us. But he said, "I will NEVER LEAVE
[1:15:25] YOU. I WILL NEVER FORSAKE YOU. I'LL pick
[1:15:28] you up when YOU FALL, AND I WILL BRING
[1:15:31] YOU TO THE FINISH, AND I WILL BLESS YOU.
[1:15:34] I WON'T SAY, "LOOK, YOU WEAKLING." I
[1:15:37] WILL SAY, "THIS IS THE RACE I CALLED YOU
[1:15:40] TO FINISH." AND HERE YOU ARE.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; OH, I tell you, my brother and sister,
[1:15:45] Satan would try to convince us that if
[1:15:47] we couldn't be some kind of superch
[1:15:49] Christian, we must not be a Christian at
[1:15:52] all. But when the word says you're
[1:15:54] victorious, you're victorious.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; When he called you to walk, you'll walk.
[1:16:01] When he calls you to run, you'll be able
[1:16:02] to run. None of this I can't. That's the
[1:16:06] devil talking when it comes from your
[1:16:08] mouth or my mouth that I can't. That's
[1:16:10] not the word speaking.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; The word says, I can do all things
[1:16:15] through Christ Jesus.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We ought to stand upon that
[1:16:18] realizing he's already placed that in
[1:16:21] us.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Now, look at First John 5 and 4. Let
[1:16:26] [snorts] me back up a little bit. These
[1:16:27] words just I didn't enlarge them, but
[1:16:29] they just leap off the page at me. How
[1:16:32] can we be defeated
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; when he, the lamb,
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; said we are victorious?
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. That's right.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; I don't know why these little thoughts
[1:16:46] keep coming in my mind, but it also
[1:16:47] reminds me of a video I seen many, many
[1:16:49] years ago.
[1:16:52] They were already tearing down the
[1:16:54] finish line of the Boston Marathon.
[1:16:57] And here come a man with a little group
[1:16:59] of people around him with blood
[1:17:01] squishing out of his tennis shoes. I
[1:17:03] hope that's not too [snorts] too
[1:17:04] inappropriate.
[1:17:07] And the men who were tearing down the
[1:17:08] finish line stopped and started
[1:17:11] resurrecting the finish line
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; because they saw a man so determined to
[1:17:16] finish the race.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; And another man who had finished the
[1:17:20] race already. They said, "Sir, the
[1:17:23] people with the the medallions or
[1:17:25] whatever you would call it u uh of
[1:17:27] finishers of the race have already
[1:17:29] left." And a man who had already run the
[1:17:30] race come back, took his off and put it
[1:17:34] on them.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my brother and sister, our Lord
[1:17:38] Jesus has already run this race. He
[1:17:41] finished it. [laughter] And he looked at
[1:17:43] you and I and said, "I am going to take
[1:17:46] off this robe of grace and I'm going to
[1:17:49] bring it back and I'm going to put it
[1:17:51] around your neck and tell you, you
[1:17:53] finished the race. YOU FINISHED IT WELL.
[1:17:56] YOU'VE DONE WHAT YOU WERE CALLED TO DO."
[1:17:59] AMEN. IT'S NOT ABOUT BOASTING, BUT it's
[1:18:01] about fulfilling. Amen.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. [snorts]
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; First John 5:4.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; For whatsoever is born of God
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; overcometh the world.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; So where's the decision here in this
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; born?
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; You have to decide whether you're born
[1:18:22] of God or not.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; And the devil will try to tell you
[1:18:25] you're not, but God will give you
[1:18:28] infallible proof that you are.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it won't be a guess.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; It will be absolute infallible proof
[1:18:37] that you are born of God.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Overcometh the world. And this is
[1:18:42] the victory that overcometh the world.
[1:18:45] Real complicated here, saints. This been
[1:18:47] on my heart. This about faith. Preaching
[1:18:49] to you about faith here. This real
[1:18:51] complicated. It's your faith.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; But remember, you can't produce your
[1:18:55] faith. It's the word in you that
[1:18:58] produces faith. So there won't there
[1:19:00] will be a false faith faith out here.
[1:19:03] There'll be a people that say, "Oh, we
[1:19:05] did we did we did when they did nothing,
[1:19:08] but God allowed them to come and they
[1:19:11] lay hands on the sick and they recover."
[1:19:13] What was God doing? Honoring faith. It's
[1:19:15] not that individual's faith. It's that
[1:19:17] faith that rose up in that sick person
[1:19:19] that God said it. I believe it. I'll be
[1:19:21] healed.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; So then people rise up and people say,
[1:19:24] "This is a great ministry. This is a
[1:19:25] great ministry. This is a great
[1:19:26] ministry. It's a great faith." Amen.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; And not to do with that man,
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; my brother and sister. You see, even
[1:19:33] your faith,
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; now let's dissect that for just a moment
[1:19:37] this morning.
[1:19:38] [snorts]
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; What faith?
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; God's faith in you.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Has said, "I'm born of God."
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; And you can't even say that Jesus is the
[1:19:54] Christ
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; without the Holy Ghost. Oh, anyone can
[1:19:58] actually say those words.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; But as revelation that activates in your
[1:20:03] life, it takes a revelation. Amen. To be
[1:20:07] able to say Jesus is the Christ.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; And look what it is now. This faith that
[1:20:14] is in you of God is telling you you are
[1:20:18] born of God. And when you are absolutely
[1:20:22] convinced you are born of God, that
[1:20:24] means that every victory over every
[1:20:27] battle you will ever face has already
[1:20:31] been settled.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; He's never lost a single battle,
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; man. You're of him. You're in him.
[1:20:39] You're a part of him. You're spoke of
[1:20:40] him. There's no way that God would let
[1:20:43] you a part of him be defeated.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Impossible.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Come on. on. That ought to give us a
[1:20:50] little faith this morning. Impossible
[1:20:52] for us to be defeated.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Now, you'll take some lumps.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; I think this morning we could all lift a
[1:21:01] hand and say, "We've taken lumps."
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; We've struggled. We've looked at our own
[1:21:06] lives.
[1:21:10] [snorts]
[1:21:12] Now, I don't say this to be humorous,
[1:21:13] but I posted it on the church WhatsApp.
[1:21:15] Maybe you saw it, maybe you didn't.
[1:21:18] a little picture of a little man there
[1:21:19] at the Bible and he says, "I ah, how was
[1:21:22] those words?" Anyway, I I read the Bible
[1:21:25] and I found a few errors.
[1:21:28] In the bottom, it says in me.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; You see, my brother and sister, there's
[1:21:35] the real truth. If you read the Bible
[1:21:36] and don't find an error in you, you
[1:21:39] better go back and read it again.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. But as that is there, the Lord is
[1:21:46] taking that one away, taking that one
[1:21:49] away, taking that one away.
[1:21:52] And we look at this and we say, I had a
[1:21:54] brother been a uh it was testified to
[1:21:57] me. I never before I spoke at this
[1:21:59] church, I I never knew this brother. had
[1:22:01] a brother Millie told me, he says, "Uh,
[1:22:04] [snorts]
[1:22:05] yeah, you know, uh,
[1:22:08] I sometimes wonder if I even hear what
[1:22:11] the preacher is saying. You know, it
[1:22:12] just seems like nothing's changing in my
[1:22:14] life."
[1:22:18] And I was like, "Well, brother," he he
[1:22:19] wanted me to pray with him. And and we
[1:22:22] prayed and he said, "Thank you." and
[1:22:24] went on.
[1:22:26] The brother that was there leaned over,
[1:22:28] whispered my ear. It's a shame he can't
[1:22:31] see where he came from.
[1:22:35] See, [snorts] the devil had him so
[1:22:37] caught in a crux that it's like, I'm
[1:22:39] just making no progress.
[1:22:42] No, [snorts] he used to be angry at a
[1:22:44] temper, argued with everybody this way
[1:22:47] and that and this and that and that. And
[1:22:49] now he's changed. But Satan's got him
[1:22:53] fooled that he can't see the change.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Well, my brother and sister,
[1:23:01] I don't think we should do that, but I
[1:23:03] tell you, I had a I had a family not all
[1:23:06] that long ago tell me, you know, we were
[1:23:09] we were just thinking back when we come
[1:23:11] started serving the Lord
[1:23:14] and the years have come and gone. Our
[1:23:16] kids are growing up and we didn't
[1:23:19] [snorts] really realize what the Lord
[1:23:20] had done for us. But one day we were
[1:23:22] kind of decluttering and we come across
[1:23:24] old photo albums and our kids are like,
[1:23:28] "Oh, oh, here we want to see these
[1:23:30] pictures." And they flipped over the
[1:23:32] first couple and they're like, "Oh, mom.
[1:23:36] Uh
[1:23:38] yeah, we won't look at these albums."
[1:23:41] You see that we forget
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; where God brought us from.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. It might do us well to not forget
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; where God brought us from. I don't know
[1:23:52] that from our worldly days we should
[1:23:54] have a photo album on the shelf so the
[1:23:56] whole world sees you
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; exposed in your worldly attire.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; But maybe God help us we don't forget
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; where we come from.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Because you see we've been challenged.
[1:24:10] This leodia the word says it's the
[1:24:13] darkest age of all the ages.
[1:24:17] Amen. Is that right?
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Darkest age of all the ages. And you are
[1:24:22] challenged. I believe if it would all be
[1:24:24] on us, we'd lift a hand and say, "We are
[1:24:26] challenged." Amen. It might be music,
[1:24:28] might be clothes, it might be
[1:24:29] friendships, it might whatever be
[1:24:31] relationships, whatever it might be. We
[1:24:34] are challenged, my brother and sister.
[1:24:36] But the word has declared, "You will not
[1:24:38] be defeated."
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan cannot defeat you. Amen.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Imagine us showing up in heaven with all
[1:24:47] the saints of the ages and us without a
[1:24:50] single scar from the battle.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to put this in worldly
[1:24:55] human thinking. They'd all be going back
[1:24:58] to our Lord Jesus saying, um, what was
[1:25:01] so special about them? They didn't have
[1:25:03] to fight.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; We're all going to stand there. Not as
[1:25:10] though we're boasting, but we're going
[1:25:11] to have the battle scars.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Battle scars of Leodysa.
[1:25:16] Of times that unbelief attacked us. What
[1:25:19] is unbelief, my brother and sister?
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Sin.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Sin. Unbelief. You can interchange them.
[1:25:29] I'm a sinner. There's unbelief in there.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; I'm unbeliever. Sin will be present.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; They go together.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; But look at this. What does God do? Did
[1:25:40] you come to church? Now it's happened.
[1:25:41] Did you come to church and then God just
[1:25:44] instantly took everything away from you?
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; No, sir. You fought for every
[1:25:49] deliverance. You fought for every But
[1:25:52] when you catch the revelation that it's
[1:25:54] already done.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; It allows us to go forward with more
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; confidence.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Right? As the word says, if your heart
[1:26:03] condemns you not, then you have
[1:26:04] confidence in God. what God's wanting us
[1:26:06] to see today. It's already finished.
[1:26:09] We're still going to face the battle.
[1:26:10] We're still going to face the fight. But
[1:26:12] you got confidence going into this fight
[1:26:14] now. I will win this one just like God
[1:26:16] helped me win that battle. I will win
[1:26:18] this battle. And the next battle that
[1:26:20] comes, I will win that battle. Amen. And
[1:26:23] I'm not going to stop until I've reached
[1:26:24] the goal.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are we okay this morning?
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 15:57 58.
[1:26:35] But thanks be to God
[1:26:38] which giveth us the victory through our
[1:26:40] Lord Jesus Christ. Can we just give a
[1:26:43] hand clap saying thank you Lord.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Lord.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; You've gave us the victory today.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Therefore, my beloved brethren,
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; be ye waffling,
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; blown every which way, wondering.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; No, that's not what the word says. Amen.
[1:27:04] I I [snorts] don't mean to make light of
[1:27:05] that, but you see, sometimes our very
[1:27:07] behavior says we don't really believe
[1:27:09] this verse.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me. Wherefore, my beloved
[1:27:15] brethren, means you sisters also. Be ye
[1:27:19] steadfast,
[1:27:21] unmovable, kind of the same word, but
[1:27:23] covering every base. Amen. Always
[1:27:26] abounding in the work of the Lord. For
[1:27:28] as much as you know that your labor is
[1:27:31] not in vain in the Lord,
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; my every time you prayed through and
[1:27:37] [snorts] then after that seemed like you
[1:27:39] slid right back where you was at. That
[1:27:41] prayer that prayed you through was not
[1:27:43] in vain. Amen. It is there. You can
[1:27:46] study history as the soldiers who fought
[1:27:48] on the island of Euima. Amen. the
[1:27:51] volcanic sand that was there and they
[1:27:53] had to climb the dunes from the beach
[1:27:55] being shot at and men dying all around
[1:27:57] them. And they all testify, you can go
[1:28:00] through history and they all testify you
[1:28:02] would take two steps forward and slide
[1:28:04] right back and you took two steps
[1:28:07] forward or three steps forward, you slid
[1:28:09] back one. And they knew though they had
[1:28:11] to keep going or they would die right
[1:28:13] there. And the those obviously that live
[1:28:16] said, "And we had no desire to die on
[1:28:19] this place, on this mount, on this
[1:28:21] island, in this sand, we were called to
[1:28:24] live."
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So even in the battle of one step
[1:28:28] forward, slide back, two or three
[1:28:30] forward, slide back, you kept going. And
[1:28:33] that's the battle that we are facing in
[1:28:35] this loudian age. Amen. It'll feel like
[1:28:38] that we are not making progress. But I
[1:28:40] promise you because the word can't fail,
[1:28:42] you are making progress. Amen. You are
[1:28:45] building up faith and moving forward and
[1:28:48] you've determined, I'M NOT GOING TO DIE
[1:28:50] in this world. I'M NOT GOING TO DIE IN
[1:28:53] LEODYSIA. This is not my resting place.
[1:28:56] My resting place is in Jesus Christ.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, Satan will tell you though, it's all
[1:29:04] in vain.
[1:29:07] Now,
[1:29:09] as we would look, as I read to you
[1:29:12] earlier, the Apostle Paul had shared to
[1:29:14] us. Amen.
[1:29:19] First Corinthians, he's speaking to
[1:29:21] them.
[1:29:25] If we're not careful,
[1:29:30] I'll just say it.
[1:29:33] You meet a lot of people around the
[1:29:34] message say, "You know what? We've got
[1:29:36] revelation for this hour. God's come.
[1:29:39] He's vindicated this.
[1:29:43] They're all fodder
[1:29:45] and we are the ones that are important.
[1:29:49] They're just a bunch of sinners.
[1:29:52] We've got the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:57] And if we could find ourselves lifted
[1:29:59] up,
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; y
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; we could find ourselves looking down on
[1:30:02] the world.
[1:30:05] Look at the Sorry to be blunt, but we've
[1:30:09] dealt with them right here in this
[1:30:10] sanctuary.
[1:30:13] Women walking the streets.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; They need some food. They need a place
[1:30:17] to stay, sell their body.
[1:30:19] We look down on that. Oh, praise God.
[1:30:24] We're not like them.
[1:30:28] You look at the person, you see it every
[1:30:30] day. Saw one right here in town the
[1:30:32] other day. guy walking down the street,
[1:30:34] you know, he's either on the way up or
[1:30:36] he's on the way down cuz he's walking
[1:30:38] down the street just
[1:30:41] like, "Oh,
[1:30:44] glad I never was a junkie."
[1:30:48] Until you meet a brother, sister that
[1:30:52] was.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; And you can't tell the difference.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; But see, we could be lifted up.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; We could think, "Oh, how special we are.
[1:31:01] God called us. He didn't call them. Is
[1:31:04] this too harsh?
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Speak to message people.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; That we don't become heady and
[1:31:08] high-minded thinking that we're so
[1:31:11] special. Are you special? I say you are
[1:31:13] special, bride of Christ.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. But do we come to the place we
[1:31:17] think we're so special?
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; See, we've seen the supernatural in our
[1:31:23] lives.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, I've seen so much
[1:31:25] supernatural in my my days on earth. Uh,
[1:31:28] it's just so incredible to see these
[1:31:31] things take place.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; We've got to see the supernatural in the
[1:31:36] word.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Between the lines, we see it start
[1:31:40] to open up and speak to us. [snorts]
[1:31:43] And wherever the word is,
[1:31:47] the supernatural is present.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Got it?
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to just put this real
[1:31:53] blunt. When you hear people say, "I went
[1:31:55] to church and there was nothing there.
[1:31:57] The preacher missed the mark today. The
[1:32:00] preacher didn't miss the mark. You did.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Because just the reading of the word
[1:32:04] That's right.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; should have caused you to walk out and
[1:32:06] say, "It was good to be in the house of
[1:32:08] the Lord today."
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not talking about a preacher
[1:32:12] preaching a bunch of nonsense.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; But if a preacher is doing his best,
[1:32:15] trying before the Lord and before the
[1:32:17] people to present the word of God, and
[1:32:19] people deride that, they look down on
[1:32:21] that. They say, "Well, that's not the
[1:32:23] perfect word. That's not pure. That's
[1:32:24] not this. That's not that." My brother
[1:32:26] and sister, the problem's not with that
[1:32:28] preacher. The problem is with the person
[1:32:31] that can't see that God promised to be
[1:32:34] in our midst. Is there two or three
[1:32:35] believers here this morning?
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me count your hands this
[1:32:39] morning. Is there two or three believers
[1:32:41] in this building this morning? Amen. So,
[1:32:43] that means that God promised he would be
[1:32:46] here with us this morning.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; I want to have my eyes open. I want to
[1:32:52] know. Let my heart be sensitive that I
[1:32:54] would know that he was here speaking to
[1:32:57] me this morning.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; And here we are today
[1:33:05] recipients.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; This is the word.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Said here, I'm just going to paraphrase
[1:33:20] it. here at the end time, the mysteries
[1:33:23] of God should
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Revelations 10:7.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Should be fulfilled. [snorts]
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Now, I've heard people interpret that,
[1:33:32] well, should meant it kind of could or
[1:33:34] couldn't, but that's not looking at it
[1:33:36] correctly. Amen. The word should is
[1:33:39] almost as a command.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; It must be revealed.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. And so we look and we're
[1:33:47] sitting in the day that the mystery of
[1:33:49] the revelation of Jesus Christ has been
[1:33:53] revealed.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That ought to make our hearts
[1:33:56] happy. That ought to cause us to be able
[1:33:58] to say, "Thank you, Lord, that here we
[1:34:00] are in the end of time." My brother and
[1:34:02] sister, it's not just people around the
[1:34:04] message that's saying, "It's the end of
[1:34:05] time." You got people in every religion
[1:34:07] on the face of the earth saying, "It's
[1:34:09] the end of time."
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; The signs are here. They're in the
[1:34:13] heavens. are in the earth. They're in
[1:34:15] the oceans and earthquakes and tsunamis
[1:34:17] and everything that's there. Every sign
[1:34:19] says we're at the end of time. And it's
[1:34:22] in that case, that time right there, we
[1:34:24] should be thankful that the should has
[1:34:27] come to pass.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Mystery been made known in this
[1:34:33] day.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Now, look, as Paul's speaking to the
[1:34:36] Corinthians, I want to hurry right along
[1:34:37] here. I finally looked at the clock and
[1:34:40] it scared me. Amen. Now, look at this.
[1:34:43] Now 2 Corinthians 12 6-9
[1:34:47] and uh
[1:34:49] Amen. Brother Isaac, will you pop that
[1:34:52] up there, please?
[1:34:59] For though, this is the Apostle Paul
[1:35:01] speaking now to the Corinthians. For
[1:35:03] though, let me prefrase this a little
[1:35:06] bit.
[1:35:09] I think you guys love me enough I you
[1:35:11] wouldn't crucify me. But in most cases,
[1:35:14] if a man in this day and age stood in
[1:35:16] front of a congregation of people and
[1:35:19] talked like the Apostle Paul is talking,
[1:35:24] man on the internet the other day was
[1:35:26] boasting how he got up and walked out of
[1:35:29] a church service.
[1:35:31] Another man commented and said, "I was
[1:35:33] in that same service. What offended
[1:35:35] you?"
[1:35:37] And the man was like, "Well, he said and
[1:35:39] this a little bit of the comment about
[1:35:41] believers, unbelievers, people." And and
[1:35:45] the guy's like, "Well, he said this."
[1:35:47] And he says, "Man, you just totally
[1:35:48] missed the mark." And the guy
[1:35:50] veheanimately argued back, "No, you're
[1:35:53] the one that missed the mark."
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; You see, my brother and sister, they
[1:35:57] can't endure sound teaching.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; And you could say, "Brother Paul, you
[1:36:02] you say that sounds arrogant." No,
[1:36:04] that's the word.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; That's that's what the scripture says.
[1:36:06] They won't endure sound teaching.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; For though I would desire to glory. Are
[1:36:13] you guys seeing a little different
[1:36:14] picture of the Apostle Paul than we
[1:36:15] sometimes have?
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul's standing right in front
[1:36:19] of the people. Though I would desire,
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; that means something down in him.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Would want to rise up and say, "Look
[1:36:28] what God gave me." Amen.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Though I would desire to glory, I shall
[1:36:35] not be a fool.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my. There's a man that has went and
[1:36:40] he has struggled. He has fought. Amen.
[1:36:43] And God has given character to him. He
[1:36:45] said, "Though I would desire to do this,
[1:36:47] I shall not be a fool. For I will say
[1:36:50] the truth, but now I forebear, lest any
[1:36:52] man should think of me above that which
[1:36:54] he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of
[1:36:58] me." Don't go lifting me up.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; You saw the supernatural. Don't go
[1:37:02] lifting me up.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; I'm not a fool. Don't lift me up.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Unless I should be exalted above measure
[1:37:11] through the abundance of the
[1:37:12] revelations.
[1:37:14] There was given to me a thorn in the
[1:37:17] Let's stop.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; I want I want to break this down. Get
[1:37:20] too far ahead.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Abundance of revelations. Apostle Paul
[1:37:25] saying I would feel like boasting. Yeah.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; And it really all comes down to the
[1:37:30] abundance of revelation that's been
[1:37:33] given to me causes me to rise up and
[1:37:36] say, "Look,
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; and God won't let him."
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; And what happened
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; to mold Paul's character so he would not
[1:37:45] boast of himself?
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; A thorn.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; In his flesh.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; That's it. Thank you, Lord.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; I've heard such carnal interpretations.
[1:37:56] It's like, I wonder what kind of tree or
[1:37:58] bush that thorn come from.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Well, maybe the tree of good and evil.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; So, here's Paul been given this
[1:38:09] incredible revelation from God himself
[1:38:11] and he's holding on to this revelation
[1:38:14] and yet God allowed a thorn in his
[1:38:17] flesh. So much speculation of what the
[1:38:19] thorn was
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; and Paul's flesh. It's really
[1:38:22] irrelevant, saints. We don't have to go
[1:38:25] back and dig through all of the
[1:38:26] languages and the histories, try to
[1:38:28] figure out what the thorn was in Paul's
[1:38:30] life. He's telling you that what God did
[1:38:32] was to keep me from boasting in myself.
[1:38:36] God put something in my life that keeps
[1:38:40] me grounded.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; IT KEEPS ME BALANCED IN my life because
[1:38:45] WHILE I KNOW WHAT GOD REVEALED, I SAW
[1:38:47] THE VISION. I was in HIS PRESENCE. I SAW
[1:38:50] ALL THESE THINGS. GOD SPEAKING to me and
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; I'm still flesh, man.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; I'm still human.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Giving me a thorn in the flesh.
[1:39:08] He knew where that thorn come from.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; I've heard people I hope there's nobody
[1:39:14] here that feels this way. I've heard
[1:39:16] people and had it spoken to me in
[1:39:18] meetings in different places, usually
[1:39:20] overseas.
[1:39:22] I did this and this, brother Paul.
[1:39:25] They're in a prayer line. They come to
[1:39:26] the altar, whatever it might be.
[1:39:29] Is God punishing me?
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; What kind of view is that of God?
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; God's now become an Egyptian taskmaster.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; You displeased me, I'll punish you.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; No, my brother and sister, that's not
[1:39:48] how God works. God will let the
[1:39:50] circumstance of this world make you feel
[1:39:54] punished. But God himself will never
[1:39:57] punish you in the way Satan wants you to
[1:40:00] think.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. But look at this now. Given me a
[1:40:04] thorn in the flesh, the messenger of
[1:40:06] Satan.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; He let Satan come in. Wait, who opened
[1:40:13] the hedge on Job?
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; That's it. Amen.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Did the devil pry it open? got a hedge
[1:40:19] trimmer, a chainsaw or something and cut
[1:40:21] a hole in the hedge. No sir, God says,
[1:40:23] "You know what? I'll just allow it to
[1:40:25] happen." So, what happened here? The
[1:40:27] Apostle Paul, so that he could remain
[1:40:29] balanced with the gospel, God says, you
[1:40:31] know what? I'll just pull my hand back
[1:40:33] just enough because the messenger of
[1:40:35] Satan is just waiting for an
[1:40:37] opportunity.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Have you experienced this in your life?
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; That that that messenger of Satan is
[1:40:45] just waiting for his moment. And you we
[1:40:48] you we don't want to pray. We as
[1:40:49] Christians don't want to pray for
[1:40:50] patience. And you want to know patience
[1:40:53] is when that messenger of Satan, he just
[1:40:55] sits around day after day, week after
[1:40:57] week, year after year just waiting for
[1:40:59] the moment to drive a thorn into you.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Maybe we could take some lessons from
[1:41:06] the devil, but I don't think we need to.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Messenger of Satan to buffet me.
[1:41:12] And look what the Apostle Paul explains
[1:41:15] why
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; he doesn't say because I'm doubting
[1:41:18] whether I'm a Christian or not. I'm
[1:41:20] doubting whether what I experienced was
[1:41:22] real or not. He's there that this given
[1:41:25] a thorn in the flesh to buffet me lest I
[1:41:30] should be
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; exalted.
[1:41:35] Right?
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; There ought not to be a boastful, proud
[1:41:40] Christian in existence.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Because I'll tell you what, harsh
[1:41:45] statement here, forgive me. I'll
[1:41:46] apologize to you personally if it's
[1:41:48] offensive, but the guy who can boast
[1:41:52] about how great a Christian he is makes
[1:41:55] you wonder if he's really a Christian.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Otherwise, God
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; would let that messenger
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; come to him.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; And drive that thorn home.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; There'll be no other gods
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; before me.
[1:42:19] And if we are risen up in our own mind
[1:42:22] and spirit that we are infallible, that
[1:42:25] Satan can't touch us, that no,
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; you're making a god out of yourself.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; And I don't have to worry about this.
[1:42:34] Isn't this beautiful? When you're just
[1:42:36] an average guy like me, I don't have to
[1:42:38] worry about being lifted up and put on a
[1:42:40] pedestal. Now, I could name some
[1:42:42] brothers who have ministries that might
[1:42:44] be at risk at that, but I just don't
[1:42:46] think I'll be on that list. But I'll
[1:42:48] tell you what'll happen.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; A man can lift himself.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; You don't need people.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Don't need Grace tabernacle. Oh, brother
[1:42:57] Paul's such a great pastor. He's such a
[1:42:59] good man. Such a No, you don't need
[1:43:01] that.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; We can slowly lift ourselves up.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; I'm just so important. These people
[1:43:09] can't make it without me.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; No, they'll make it. All right. Because
[1:43:14] we've already proven by the word this
[1:43:16] morning that you are sons and daughters
[1:43:17] of God from before the foundation of the
[1:43:19] world. You will make it. So anybody who
[1:43:22] thinks you can't make it without them
[1:43:24] has a problem they're going to have to
[1:43:26] deal with.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; So there it is. Lest I should be exalted
[1:43:30] above measure. For this thing I besought
[1:43:32] the Lord thrice that it might depart
[1:43:34] from me. And he said unto me, "My grace
[1:43:36] is sufficient for thee, for my strength
[1:43:39] is made perfect when that thorn is
[1:43:43] poking you."
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; I don't want to leave that as my
[1:43:49] interpretation of the scripture here. My
[1:43:52] grace is sufficient for thee, for my
[1:43:53] strength is made perfect in weakness.
[1:43:55] Most gladly, therefore, will I rather
[1:43:57] glory. Now, look at where the Apostle
[1:43:59] Paul went from telling you, I'VE DONE
[1:44:01] THE SUPERNATURAL. GOD CAME TO ME. THIS
[1:44:04] IS THE WORD OF GOD RIGHT FROM HEAVEN,
[1:44:07] right from the throne, RIGHT TO ME. I
[1:44:09] BROUGHT IT RIGHT TO YOU and then he is
[1:44:11] there. But I would rather see. He could
[1:44:14] have gloried back up there in that
[1:44:15] scripture. But now he is. I would rather
[1:44:17] glory in my infirmity that the power of
[1:44:20] Christ may rest upon me. Cuz when I am
[1:44:22] weak, he is strong. When I am here to
[1:44:26] declare, I could go no further, but he's
[1:44:28] brought me here. Amen. That's when the
[1:44:30] Lord would come and say, "And I'll take
[1:44:32] you all the way." That's right.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; I'll bring you to a finish.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; This word will not return void. It
[1:44:38] cannot return void.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Now, I preached all of that to preach
[1:44:46] this.
[1:44:49] Please do not miss this fact.
[1:44:52] The same abundance of mysteries is
[1:44:55] present today.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Now, it was brought to us by these men
[1:45:01] of God. That's right.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; It wasn't our own personal thing that we
[1:45:05] figured out, but those mystery saints
[1:45:08] are right here today. What God revealed
[1:45:10] to the Apostle Paul, what he revealed to
[1:45:13] brother Brandham, what he revealed to
[1:45:15] all of those men through the ages is
[1:45:18] here this morning. And if we're not
[1:45:21] careful, we'll put it down like, "Yeah,
[1:45:22] yeah, that's just the message. That's
[1:45:24] just what we believe. That's right here
[1:45:25] in the Bible. It's right there in the
[1:45:26] Bible." Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm telling
[1:45:28] you, my brother and sister, the things
[1:45:30] that the Apostle Paul said, I saw or
[1:45:32] present in you today. Amen. Revealed
[1:45:35] through the word. Amen. Because
[1:45:37] everything you need is in this word. And
[1:45:40] God said that the mystery should be
[1:45:42] finished.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; And that means the mystery is finished
[1:45:46] this morning.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's been poured out through
[1:45:50] the word.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, it didn't come from some man
[1:45:53] like I didn't come to you and and you
[1:45:55] know skip church for a month and then
[1:45:57] come some morning, oh look, I've got
[1:46:00] something special. It was just through
[1:46:02] the preaching of the word
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; and the word has been opened.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; The word has been revealed.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; And we are here, as brother Brown says,
[1:46:13] reading between the lines. If you got a
[1:46:17] special gift, it was the gift God gave
[1:46:18] you to see between those lines to see
[1:46:20] what God was really saying.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. The words the Apostle Paul, same
[1:46:25] word to you.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. The same revelation is in you.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Now, let me quantify this or qualify
[1:46:32] this. We sit here today and we could say
[1:46:35] the very same things that God revealed
[1:46:37] in all these messengers through the ages
[1:46:39] coming right down to the seventh age
[1:46:40] messenger is in us. But then, Brother
[1:46:43] Brown says, "When you've got a little
[1:46:45] portion of the ocean,
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; you've got everything that's in the
[1:46:49] ocean,
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; but you don't have the ocean." That's
[1:46:53] right.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; So, it's in portion.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; We're not sitting here today. We I I
[1:46:58] don't think there's anybody here in our
[1:47:00] midst this morning that can say, "I was
[1:47:02] there in bed. I was here. I was in the
[1:47:04] woods. I was whatever. And the Lord come
[1:47:05] down and showed me and did this and
[1:47:08] revealed this, and I saw a vision." We
[1:47:10] can't do that. But that word that come
[1:47:12] through that has been taken back to the
[1:47:15] Bible
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; and made plain
[1:47:19] to me
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; plain to you.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Did it come to us as the original
[1:47:24] edition? No. But it [snorts] come to us
[1:47:27] as revelation.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; And the words right here.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; The same revelation
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; in portion.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Poured out to you and I.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:39] Hallelujah.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; And thinking of the Apostle Paul, what I
[1:47:42] just preached to you, the same
[1:47:44] challenges.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Now, we're human. We won't go there, but
[1:47:56] I think if we was to be honest with
[1:47:58] ourselves, we would start right here on
[1:47:59] the front row. That means you, Brother
[1:48:02] Trevor.
[1:48:03] Oh, no. Maybe it means Sister Sue. But
[1:48:05] then that would No, we'll start with
[1:48:07] you.
[1:48:09] If we were that open,
[1:48:11] if we could be that open,
[1:48:13] everyone of age and comprehension in
[1:48:16] this building,
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; could be able to describe their thorn.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Paul experienced it. God [clears throat]
[1:48:27] didn't say, "It's all in theory to you."
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; He's letting you and I
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; experience it.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Can we glory in our infirmity? Yes.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Can we give God praise for the things
[1:48:40] that we see as a weakness and a failure
[1:48:42] in our life and we say, "Oh Lord, if you
[1:48:44] would just know, my brother and sister,
[1:48:46] he's here."
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] And he's allowing that
[1:48:49] because he wants us to lift him up.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we're lifting oursel up, we
[1:48:55] can't lift him up.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he allows us to go through
[1:48:59] this infirmity. If we're [snorts] not
[1:49:01] careful, we become bitter.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; We become bitter. Um,
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; someone else is the cause of my
[1:49:07] infirmity.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; someone else. But what did the Apostle
[1:49:11] Paul say?
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; It was God that allowed that infirmity
[1:49:16] in his life. It was the messenger of
[1:49:17] Satan that actually brought it.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; But it was God that allowed it.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; And I want you to know, God will allow
[1:49:26] challenges in your life. Because if we
[1:49:29] get lifted up, my brother and sister, we
[1:49:32] will not hear the voice of God when we
[1:49:35] are lifted up in our own thinking.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:44] [snorts]
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with this. Sister
[1:49:46] Vik, if you would come, please.
[1:49:51] Often times, especially when we're in
[1:49:54] meetings with youth,
[1:49:59] young people question whether they're
[1:50:01] really a Christian. Maybe they got a
[1:50:02] little struggle, a girlfriend at school,
[1:50:04] a boyfriend at school, uh a certain
[1:50:06] music, certain clothes, whatever it
[1:50:09] might be, a little something that just,
[1:50:11] you know, and and they come and and I'm
[1:50:13] not speaking down on it. I I've been
[1:50:14] there. I walk this road. [snorts]
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you're in the influence of
[1:50:17] the world over here, you feel like you
[1:50:19] belong there.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. But then you go to church
[1:50:21] on Sunday and you get in the house of
[1:50:24] God and the music's playing and people
[1:50:25] are worshiping, the presence of God
[1:50:27] moves down. That same young person says,
[1:50:30] "This is where I belong."
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; And the problem is is they spend all
[1:50:34] their time bouncing between the two of
[1:50:37] these. And all Satan wants to do is get
[1:50:40] them fatigued to the point they just
[1:50:43] say, "I must not be
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; I must not be. I'm just going to give
[1:50:48] up." The problem is they're on the wrong
[1:50:51] side of the bounce when they say, "I'm
[1:50:54] going to give up." If they would be over
[1:50:56] here in the presence of God and the
[1:50:58] house of God and the moving of the Holy
[1:51:00] Spirit, look up to our Lord Jesus and
[1:51:02] say, "I give up. [snorts] I give up.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; I can't do it myself any longer. I give
[1:51:08] up." But Satan, he just tries to time
[1:51:11] the bounce
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; just right that at the point they come
[1:51:15] over here and it's there. Usually it's
[1:51:18] condemnation,
[1:51:20] little something they've done and
[1:51:22] they're like, "If I'd been a Christian,
[1:51:24] I wouldn't have done that." Well, I'll
[1:51:26] tell you what, my brother and sister,
[1:51:28] [music] you experience it yourself. You
[1:51:30] have someone close to you experience
[1:51:32] that. You take them back to the word.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; You take them back and show them that
[1:51:36] God already said it's done.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Bring your problems, bring your
[1:51:43] weakness, bring your challenge. Amen.
[1:51:46] cuz I want to ask you a question. How
[1:51:48] could our Lord Jesus Christ lose
[1:51:52] a part of himself? [music]
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; He can't do it.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; He can't do it.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; That's why we're seeing a a move.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; We're seeing a move taking place. People
[1:52:06] have been away from serving God for
[1:52:08] years now. And when they come back, they
[1:52:11] almost to the person confess they've
[1:52:14] been miserable for years,
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; but they felt like in their condition
[1:52:18] they wouldn't be accepted in the house
[1:52:19] of God.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, I just pray that the atmosphere of
[1:52:27] Grace Tabernacle be such that we're
[1:52:30] [music] a welcoming spirit. We're a
[1:52:33] loving spirit. No, we don't love the
[1:52:35] sin, but we love the person, the sinner.
[1:52:39] Amen. and they should feel welcome to
[1:52:41] come here. We're not here to condemn.
[1:52:43] [music] We're here to speak truth and
[1:52:46] draw them into eternal life by the grace
[1:52:49] of God.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; I'll close with these words.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; You are challenged,
[1:52:55] [snorts]
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; but you are not defeated.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[1:52:59] Let's just stand. Amen. Sing a song or
[1:53:01] two. Amen. 3:17.
[1:53:05] Hallelujah.
[1:53:08] I'm trying to do better. It says C at
[1:53:09] the bottom of that. [snorts]
[1:53:13] We'll sing it in F anyway, but that's
[1:53:14] okay.
[1:53:17] Amazing
[1:53:18] grace
[1:53:21] shall always
[1:53:24] be my song of praise.
[1:53:30] It was grace
[1:53:34] that bought my li
[1:53:48] Why he came to love me so?
[1:53:55] He looked beyond [singing]
[1:53:59] my fall and saw my need.
[1:54:08] Thou forever
[1:54:13] lift mine eyes to Calary
[1:54:21] to view the cross
[1:54:26] where Jesus
[1:54:28] died for [singing] me.
[1:54:33] How marvelous.
[1:54:38] Oh, the grace that [singing and music]
[1:54:41] caught my falling
[1:54:44] soul.
[1:54:46] He looked
[1:54:49] up [music]
[1:54:51] [snorts] my fall and saw my need.
[1:54:59] Amazing
[1:55:01] grace
[1:55:04] that save me from my sin and [music]
[1:55:10] shame.
[1:55:13] Draw me close
[1:55:17] and keep me by his side. Isn't that
[1:55:22] beautiful? He drew you. Keep you right
[1:55:24] by his side. Ever I'll sing
[1:55:30] all praise, all gloryy
[1:55:34] to his name
[1:55:38] if not for him.
[1:55:43] I surely
[1:55:45] would have died.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; I shall forever
[1:55:56] live my life to Calary.
[1:56:04] [music]
[1:56:04] With
[1:56:06] the cross,
[1:56:09] oh where Jesus
[1:56:11] died for me.
[1:56:16] [snorts]
[1:56:17] [music] How marvelous
[1:56:22] the grace that caught [music]
[1:56:25] my falling
[1:56:28] soul.
[1:56:30] He looked [singing]
[1:56:32] beyond
[1:56:35] my fault and saw my need. Now look at
[1:56:40] how beautiful this verse is. How sweet
[1:56:45] it is. Can we say it's sweet this
[1:56:47] morning?
[1:56:49] Walk with him this narrow
[1:56:54] way.
[1:56:57] For now I see
[1:57:01] the light of glory
[1:57:05] glee.
[1:57:10] Soon I shall see
[1:57:14] his [music]
[1:57:15] lovely face and he who will say, "Oh,
[1:57:21] what beautiful words done my child.
[1:57:27] Come be enthroned
[1:57:30] with me. [music]
