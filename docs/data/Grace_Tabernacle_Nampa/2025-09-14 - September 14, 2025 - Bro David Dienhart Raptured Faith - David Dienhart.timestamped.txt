[26:25] Um, also Sister Jolin not feeling well
[26:27] today and for Aaliyah to feel better and
[26:31] uh let's remember brother Mo, sister
[26:32] Danell, the saints in uh North Idaho,
[26:37] Sister April not here. Let's remember
[26:38] her in prayer. Sister Dorcas and family,
[26:41] brother Pashan, Sister Acha and baby
[26:43] Isaac as well. And also uh Sister Sue is
[26:47] not here. We'll just pray for her as
[26:49] well. And let's remember the saints and
[26:51] living word fellowship. um and the
[26:54] saints in the northwest.
[26:58] That's the needs that we have. Happy to
[26:59] see brother Luke with us. God bless you.
[27:02] Brother Paul, could you lead us into our
[27:04] prayer today?
[27:06] [Music]
[27:16] Is it good to be in the house of the
[27:17] Lord today?
[27:19] Amen. Now, the word tells us that that
[27:21] we'll ask anything in his name, he will
[27:25] give it to us. And I just encourage each
[27:27] one today, whatever the need is in your
[27:29] life, just ask. Ask from your heart.
[27:33] Amen. Claim it. He made the promise. He
[27:36] will perform it. Heavenly Father, we
[27:39] come before you today, Lord. Another
[27:42] beautiful day to come into the house of
[27:44] the Lord. To be able to stand before
[27:46] you, Lord, to come into your presence.
[27:49] Father, it's with great expectation that
[27:52] we come today, Father. Lord, not to hear
[27:55] a man, not to just be gathered together
[27:57] to greet our friends and fellow saints.
[27:59] But, Father, to come into your presence
[28:01] and have you speak to our hearts today,
[28:04] Father, Lord, just to encourage and
[28:07] strengthen us, Father. For we live in an
[28:09] hour that Satan is so prevalent, Lord.
[28:12] He's so uh so in this world, Father,
[28:15] that if we are not careful, we will find
[28:18] ourselves under the uh influence, under
[28:20] the atmosphere of this world. But,
[28:23] Father, we're not of this world. We are
[28:25] of you, Father. We are sons of God. We
[28:28] are daughters of God. And we've been
[28:30] called to a higher calling. We've been
[28:32] called to dwell in your presence,
[28:34] Father. And Lord, we're asking you to
[28:37] come today. Use our brother David, Lord,
[28:39] just to speak to our hearts, Lord,
[28:41] encouraging us through the word, Father,
[28:44] that raises our faith, Father. Just
[28:47] reading where your prophet said that
[28:48] without faith, we cannot even have
[28:51] action, Father. And without action, we
[28:53] will not see results. And Father, we
[28:55] just ask you to come now. Raise our
[28:57] faith today to claim deliverance if we
[29:00] need deliverance, Lord. claim healing,
[29:03] Father, if we need healing, Lord. Just
[29:06] encouraging words to our souls today.
[29:08] That you would just move us a little
[29:10] closer, Father, to you, Lord. That you
[29:13] would just touch each family, Lord. No
[29:15] matter what our struggle might be,
[29:17] Father, you called us, Lord. It's not
[29:19] the things of this world, Father, but
[29:22] it's your calling in our life, Father,
[29:24] that we respond to. And we just ask you
[29:26] to come for these prayer requests, Lord
[29:28] Jesus. just little Declan and the Nash
[29:31] family. Father, just ask you, Lord
[29:33] Jesus, to be with them. Strengthen them.
[29:35] Let healing virtue flow. Father, we just
[29:38] ask you, Father, for uh Sister Jolyn,
[29:41] not well today. My dear granddaughter
[29:44] Aaliyah, Father, just been plagued,
[29:46] Father, by this little health issue that
[29:48] just keeps coming back again and again.
[29:51] Satan, we bind you in the name of Jesus
[29:53] Christ. She is healed. She has been
[29:56] living the promise, Father, and it is in
[29:59] her, Father. And we let it come forth
[30:01] now, Father, for every need. Uh our
[30:04] brother Moses, Sister Danell, all the
[30:06] saints there in North Idaho. Father, we
[30:09] just ask you to move in their midst,
[30:11] Father, continue to encourage them, Lord
[30:14] Jesus. And we ask you, Father, for every
[30:17] need, Lord, that is in the Northwest,
[30:19] Father. Lord, the churches, the
[30:21] believers, Father, wherever they might
[30:23] be today, you know their circumstance
[30:26] and we ask you to come down, speak to
[30:28] their hearts today. Lord, we just ask
[30:30] you to be with our sister April, Father.
[30:33] She just has a burden upon her heart,
[30:35] Father, to help these, Lord, through the
[30:37] medical, through the sharing of the
[30:39] gospel, Lord, through the living of the
[30:41] gospel. We just ask you to be with our
[30:44] sister April today, Father. Just lead
[30:46] her, guide her, Father. Lord, just let
[30:48] her make a difference in the lives of
[30:50] those people. Many of them do not know
[30:53] you, but Father, the word is going to
[30:55] every corner of the earth, every nation,
[30:58] every kindred, every tongue. And Father,
[31:00] how you choose to carry it is up to you,
[31:03] Lord. And we would just ask you, Father,
[31:05] just to be, Lord, our sister Dorcas
[31:07] needing healing in her body. Lord, we
[31:10] just ask you to come down, Father. Lord,
[31:12] you blessed her to come through this
[31:14] surgery, Father. But Lord, we're asking
[31:16] for a healing, Father. And Lord, even at
[31:19] this moment, everyone that needs a
[31:21] healing here today, may they just raise
[31:23] a hand, raise a heart, and say, "Lord,
[31:26] you're passing through this building
[31:28] today, Lord. Touch me today, Father.
[31:31] Lord, I need a healing also, Father.
[31:34] Just move upon us. I ask, Lord, we just
[31:37] thank you, Lord. all the saints, Father,
[31:40] in this part of the world, Lord, those
[31:42] that are in the service today, those
[31:43] that are not, we ask you to touch them,
[31:46] Father. Lord, we thank you for your
[31:48] grace. We ask you to just bless us,
[31:50] Father, as we come with great
[31:52] expectation. Let your word just come and
[31:56] bless us,
[31:58] Lord. May we lift our voices in praise.
[32:02] May the worshippers arise today and Lord
[32:05] just lift their voices in praise to you,
[32:09] Lord. You're greater than our
[32:11] circumstance.
[32:13] You're greater than our needs, Lord.
[32:16] Father, what we need is more of you,
[32:19] Father. How we need you today.
[32:22] Come and move in our midst. I ask this
[32:25] in the precious name of Jesus Christ.
[32:28] Amen.
[32:32] And you may be seated. We'll sing one
[32:34] more song and then we'll have Sister
[32:36] Melody sing a special for us.

[37:30] Amen. Sister Melody.
[37:58] [Music]
[37:59] Um, is this is it?
[38:03] I just wanted to say before I sing this
[38:05] that
[38:09] in 2017 I walked away from God
[38:13] and for 8 years I felt so alone.
[38:18] But once God got a hold of my life, I
[38:20] looked back and I saw him in every
[38:23] difficulty that I faced.
[38:26] He never left me. Even though I walked
[38:29] away,
[38:32] [Music]
[38:51] time after time
[38:55] I was searching.
[38:58] for peace in some void.
[39:02] [Music]
[39:04] I was trying
[39:07] to blame
[39:09] all my ills on this world I was in.
[39:16] [Music]
[39:19] Surface
[39:21] relationships
[39:24] used me till I was done in.
[39:33] But all the while someone
[39:37] was waiting
[39:39] to free me from sin.
[39:45] He was there
[39:49] all
[39:51] the time.
[39:54] He was there
[39:58] all the time,
[40:03] waiting
[40:05] patiently
[40:07] [Music]
[40:09] in line.
[40:12] He was there
[40:16] all
[40:18] the time.
[40:19] [Music]
[40:23] Never
[40:25] again
[40:27] will I look for that vague rainbow end.
[40:37] Now that I found the answers, my life is
[40:44] starting
[40:45] to rhyme.
[40:47] [Music]
[40:50] Sharing
[40:52] each new day with him
[40:56] is a breath of fresh life.
[41:02] [Music]
[41:04] Oh, what I've missed. He was waiting
[41:10] right there all the time.
[41:16] He was there
[41:19] all
[41:21] the time.
[41:24] He was there
[41:28] all the time.
[41:33] waiting patiently
[41:38] in line.
[41:42] He was there
[41:46] all
[41:47] the time.
[41:49] [Music]
[41:51] He was there
[41:54] all the time.
[42:00] He was there
[42:03] all
[42:05] the time,
[42:09] waiting patiently
[42:12] [Music]
[42:14] in line.
[42:16] [Music]
[42:18] He was there
[42:21] all
[42:23] the time.
[42:28] All he wants
[42:32] is you.
[42:37] No one else will do.
[42:45] Not just a part. He wants all of your
[42:52] heart.
[42:54] All he wants
[42:58] is all of you.
[43:03] All he wants
[43:07] is you.
[43:10] [Music]
[43:12] All he wants is me.
[43:18] [Music]
[43:21] unreervedly.
[43:26] [Music]
[43:30] Not just a part.
[43:34] He wants all of my heart.
[43:39] All he wants
[43:43] is all
[43:45] of me.
[43:48] All he wants
[43:52] is me.
[43:55] [Music]
[43:58] All he wants
[44:01] is me.
[44:04] [Music]
[44:16] Amen. Thank you for that song. It's
[44:19] beautiful.
[44:22] As we invite brother David to come,
[44:24] let's sing
[44:26] number 114.
[44:34] [Music]
[44:36] Create
[44:38] in me a clean heart.
[44:45] Oh God,

[44:54] within me.
[45:00] Create
[45:02] in me a clean heart,
[45:08] oh God,
[45:13] and renew a right spirit
[45:17] within me.
[45:24] Cast me not away
[45:29] from thy presence,
[45:33] oh Lord,
[45:35] and take not thy holy spirit from me.
[45:46] Restore
[45:49] unto me
[45:53] the joy of thy salvation
[46:00] and renew a right spirit
[46:04] within me. Create in me.
[46:09] Oh, create in me a clean heart,
[46:18] oh God,

[46:27] within me.
[46:33] Create
[46:35] in me a clean
[46:39] heart,
[46:42] oh God,
[46:46] and renew a right spirit
[46:50] within me.
[46:57] Cast me not away
[47:02] from thy presence,
[47:05] oh Lord,
[47:08] and take not thy holy spirit from me.
[47:19] Restore
[47:22] unto me
[47:25] the joy of thy salvation.
[47:30] [Music]
[47:43] &gt;&gt; And you might say, "Brother David,
[47:44] you're sure coming up there with
[47:46] ammunition."
[47:48] Yeah, I am a sword,
[47:52] not an ammunition. I just
[47:56] little out of my comfort zone this
[47:58] morning.
[48:00] You know, God takes us out of our
[48:02] comfort zones.
[48:04] He knows how to do that. And I'm just
[48:06] thankful though. He always makes a way.
[48:10] You know, I appreciated that song,
[48:12] Sister Melody. God bless you for that.
[48:15] And now the question is
[48:18] will you surrender?
[48:20] [Music]
[48:22] Have you fully surrendered? Prophet said
[48:25] you know there's not one thing we need
[48:26] to do. Grace has provided it all. We
[48:29] just need to believe. And then he turned
[48:30] and said there is something you can do.
[48:32] He said that's completely let go and
[48:35] give God your whole self and your being.
[48:38] You have a choice. You can serve
[48:39] yourself or you can turn yourself
[48:42] completely to God and die to self. We do
[48:45] that every single day. We die to self
[48:49] and let him rule.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I pray that God will just
[48:53] speak to every individual, bring light
[48:56] on your need.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; And walk in the light.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together as we pray.
[49:07] So, my computer wouldn't print
[49:11] what I had prepared. So it's a little
[49:13] out of norm. So I if I can't print it,
[49:16] I'll bring the computer then.
[49:19] So I just believe that God knows
[49:22] exactly. There's a purpose. There's a
[49:24] reason for everything. We don't have to
[49:26] know. We don't have to figure it out.
[49:28] God knows. You believe that?
[49:30] &gt;&gt; You're not here by chance.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; You're here by divine
[49:34] direction.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are led to be here. God knew
[49:39] where you'd be. God knew I would have to
[49:41] do this. So, he's got a purpose in all
[49:43] of it. Let's pray. Our precious heavenly
[49:46] father,
[49:47] as you prayed through our pastor this
[49:49] morning, God, we're just giving the
[49:52] whole service to you. We're asking you
[49:53] to move
[49:56] move through your word. That's the
[49:58] channel you move in, Lord. May you move
[50:01] through the word of promise for this
[50:03] hour. For Lord, this is our message.
[50:06] This is our ministry. Lord, is the
[50:09] message of the season, the message of
[50:11] the hour. And Lord God, it's hid from
[50:14] many, but your elect knows it because
[50:17] you said, "My sheep know my voice, and a
[50:21] stranger they'll not follow."
[50:24] Because they cannot follow the voice of
[50:26] a stranger.
[50:28] So Lord Jesus, minister to everyone
[50:30] individually according to your divine
[50:32] and eternal purpose.
[50:35] Take me, Lord. I'm just submitting all
[50:38] things and my whole being to you Lord.
[50:40] Let the people not see the instrument
[50:42] you use but hear the voice
[50:46] of that instrument which Lord you can
[50:48] only play.
[50:50] And now father I just commit it all to
[50:52] you. Every word, every thought, every
[50:54] action and we call upon you for divine
[50:57] revelation
[50:58] that Lord we will leave here raised to a
[51:01] higher plane in Christ. our
[51:05] identification in Jesus Christ's name we
[51:08] pray and we say thank you Lord because
[51:11] we know and believe that we receive what
[51:13] we ask for and we shall see it manifest.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; We give you thanks. Amen.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd like you to turn with me in
[51:21] your Bibles to Psalm 27.
[51:25] Some scriptures here to read. Just want
[51:27] to follow the leading of the Lord now as
[51:30] we go.
[51:35] I'll begin with the first verse.
[51:42] The Lord is my can even say my
[51:46] &gt;&gt; my
[51:47] &gt;&gt; light
[51:48] &gt;&gt; and my salvation.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the
[51:54] strength of my life.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Of whom shall I be afraid?
[52:00] When the wicked, even mine enemies and
[52:02] my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh.
[52:05] See, that's all they had to eat. They
[52:06] can't
[52:08] What's the serpent's meat?
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Flesh.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Okay. They stumbled and fell. Though a
[52:14] host should encamp against me, my heart
[52:18] shall not fear. Though war should rise
[52:21] against me, in this will I be confident.
[52:25] What we just read right here. One thing
[52:28] have I desired of the Lord that I will
[52:30] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[52:32] of the Lord all the days of my life to
[52:35] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[52:37] inquire in his temple.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Where is his temple?
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Right here.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; That's exactly. So where is he?
[52:45] &gt;&gt; So what do you have to fear if he's in
[52:47] you?
[52:51] &gt;&gt; No. Nothing. You're going to believe
[52:53] what you fear.
[52:55] There is a divine respect to God that
[52:57] you've that fear is in him
[53:00] &gt;&gt; to him
[53:02] &gt;&gt; because you reverence him. You know his
[53:04] word will be kept.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a love relationship.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; But you're going to the devil wants to
[53:11] bring you anxiety. He wants to point you
[53:13] to your flesh. He wants to point you to
[53:15] situation just like he's tried his best
[53:17] to point me at this. But he's a failure.
[53:21] He can't overcome the perfect will of
[53:23] God that's working in you. How many
[53:25] believe it's working in you?
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. There you go. All right. So, call
[53:30] him a bluff. You don't have to fear him.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; In order to fear him, you've got to
[53:36] believe him.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's go continue now. Verse
[53:43] five. We know verse four again. One
[53:44] thing I have desired of the Lord, I will
[53:46] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[53:48] of the Lord all the days of my life. And
[53:51] behold the beauty of the Lord. So
[53:53] where's his beauty? It's in his temple.
[53:56] And to inquire. Inquire what? Inquire of
[53:59] him.
[54:00] Amen. In his temple.
[54:04] For it is for it for in the time of
[54:06] trouble. I may say amen. We're in the
[54:08] time of trouble.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; All right. For in the time of trouble,
[54:14] he shall hide me. How about you? I
[54:19] wonder if you can see yourself written
[54:20] here,
[54:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:21] &gt;&gt; He shall hide me in his pavilion.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Pavilion is a is a covering. It's
[54:30] a It's a refuge. It's a place. The name
[54:32] of the Lord is a mighty tower, a
[54:35] pavilion, a safe place. And he'll hide
[54:38] me in the secret of his pavilion. In no,
[54:41] excuse me, in his pavilion, in the
[54:42] secret of his tabernacle,
[54:46] &gt;&gt; shall he hide me. Then there's a tab,
[54:48] there's a secret in this tabernacle,
[54:51] this tabernacle, that tabernacle
[54:54] &gt;&gt; that God could not and would not open
[54:56] until the seals were opened in this
[54:58] hour. Then it would fully be seen. And
[55:00] that what is that third pull? The
[55:02] opening of the word.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; So what's the secret? The prophet said,
[55:05] "Here's the secret. The word is in the
[55:07] bride."
[55:09] &gt;&gt; All right. So he said, "In the time of
[55:12] trouble, he shall hide me in his
[55:13] pavilion. In the secret of his
[55:15] tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall
[55:17] set me upon a revelation."
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Rock is revelation.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Psalm 62, we'll read in just a minute.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; That speaks of your revelation.
[55:28] Verse six, "And now shall my head be
[55:31] lifted up above mine enemies round about
[55:33] me. Therefore will I offer in his
[55:35] tabernacle. Where? In his tabernacle.
[55:40] Amen. Where where is the place of
[55:42] worship? In his tabernacle.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; There's only one place to worship him.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; In his tabernacle. You cannot truly
[55:50] worship the Lord Jesus unless you're in
[55:52] his tabernacle.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's where he placed his name.
[55:56] That's where his name is.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; So where is it? It's in the bride.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. Now, so and now
[56:05] my head shall be lifted up above mine
[56:07] enemies round about me.
[56:12] It therefore I will offer up in his
[56:14] tabernacle sacrifices of joy. Sacrifice.
[56:18] It's a joy to give sac. It's a
[56:20] sacrifice. I mean to say thank you Lord
[56:22] no matter what situation I'm in.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; I will sing. Yay. I will offer praise
[56:28] unto the Lord. You may be seated. I'd
[56:30] like you to turn with me
[56:32] &gt;&gt; now to
[56:35] to Psalms 40.
[56:37] I just have you right seated there on
[56:39] that one. Amen.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Psalm 40 verse1
[56:50] I verse one through two
[56:54] and then I'll take verse seven. I
[56:57] waited. Boy, that's a that's a that's a
[57:00] that's that's a strength. I waited
[57:05] &gt;&gt; patiently
[57:07] &gt;&gt; for the Lord and he inclined unto me and
[57:10] heard my cry. That's the problem. We
[57:12] need patience,
[57:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "He brought me up also
[57:17] out of a horrible pit and out of the
[57:20] miry clay." Look at what he did. He
[57:22] brought me up also out of the horrible
[57:24] pit, out of the miry clay, and set my
[57:27] feet upon a rock, and established my
[57:29] goings. There's the rock again. And he's
[57:32] established your goings.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; And heath put a new s. Okay, I want to
[57:39] move down here to seven. Then said I,
[57:41] lo, I come in the volume of the book.
[57:45] Lo, I come
[57:47] &gt;&gt; in the volume of the book.
[57:50] It is written of me. You say, "Well,
[57:54] yes, it's written of him, but what about
[57:55] you?"
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Right there it is.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; The Bible said that you're that that you
[58:00] were the word in this book.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; And it was a hidden word until the
[58:05] seventh angel's message.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Until he he came
[58:10] with his message, that was a hidden
[58:12] word. But the Bible said we'll find
[58:14] where it's written.
[58:16] And I want to read that to you. If
[58:18] you'll go to 2 Corinthians 3
[58:22] and let's go over there. I'm placing
[58:25] these scriptures out because I want to
[58:27] give a foundation. 2 Corinthians
[58:34] chapter
[58:36] or 2 Corinthians 3 and verse three.
[58:41] Now Paul's saying, "You are our epistle,
[58:44] our written word written in our hearts."
[58:46] You are the bride is the written
[58:48] epistle. Paul said, "You are the written
[58:51] epistle read in and written in my
[58:53] heart."
[58:55] &gt;&gt; What about us being the epistle written
[58:58] in our prophet's heart?
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "You are our epistle." And that
[59:06] epistle written in his heart was the
[59:08] perfect interpretation of the word.
[59:10] Scriptures written for this season.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. For this hour. How many believe
[59:16] that? By divine vindication. So we're
[59:19] not looking at something in part. We're
[59:21] looking at a perfect perfect
[59:23] interpretation to take us home.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; And but that's got to be a spiritual
[59:29] application to you. You say, "Well, you
[59:31] can have the revelation." Everybody
[59:32] says, "Well, praise God we have the
[59:33] revelation." But there's a supernatural
[59:35] element still involved in that. And
[59:37] that's that word quickened to you
[59:38] personally.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's got to be revealed to you.
[59:43] Without the revelation, you're not even
[59:44] saved. You cannot make rapture without
[59:47] Christ revealed in you.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; And Christ is the word.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; All right. So, so he said now and he
[59:55] goes down to verse three. For so much as
[59:57] you are manifestly declared, you are the
[59:59] manifestation of what? The epistle, the
[1:00:02] written word written in my heart. He
[1:00:04] said the epistle of Christ ministered by
[1:00:07] us or the epistle written here as it was
[1:00:10] brought out and we brought out before
[1:00:11] that in meetings that this is Reema but
[1:00:14] the logos is the thought behind this.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what is being revealed to the
[1:00:20] bride? We believe that we take this this
[1:00:22] is God in written form.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; this is God in written form this Bible?
[1:00:29] But there's a thought behind that word.
[1:00:31] Everybody has the word and can quote the
[1:00:33] word, but they don't have the revelation
[1:00:35] contained in that word.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So now he said, "Now
[1:00:41] for so much as you are manifestly
[1:00:43] declared to be the epistle of Christ
[1:00:45] ministered by us, written not with ink,
[1:00:48] but with the spirit of the living God,
[1:00:50] not on tables of stone, but on fleshly
[1:00:54] tables of the or your
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; heart." Amen.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So now we finding where
[1:01:03] this message is written.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; All right. Now we go over here to 2
[1:01:09] Corinthians. Stay in that chapter. Go
[1:01:10] over here now to verse to verse
[1:01:14] 17.
[1:01:16] Now the Lord is that spirit. And where
[1:01:19] the spirit of the Lord is, there is
[1:01:22] liberty. Because when the message comes
[1:01:24] out, it speaks to your heart. It's
[1:01:26] speaking to hearts. They that have the
[1:01:28] word in them for the hour, the season,
[1:01:30] elected, predestinated seed for this
[1:01:33] season, that word, that spirit has to go
[1:01:35] and and combine or connect with that
[1:01:38] seed.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; And it brings that word to life in you.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brings it to manifestation.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word for the season. You're
[1:01:49] the very manifestation of that epistle
[1:01:51] written.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; All right. So now then we Oh, excuse me.
[1:01:55] Amen. Now, nevertheless,
[1:01:59] the veil's been taken away. The Lord is
[1:02:01] that spirit. And where the spirit of the
[1:02:03] Lord is, there is bondage.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, did I read something wrong? Where
[1:02:08] the spirit of the Lord is, brother Paul,
[1:02:09] there's liberty.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; There's liberty, brother, sister,
[1:02:13] there's liberty.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; You now hold liberty.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Well, I didn't give you my I kind of
[1:02:22] coming off of 31st here. I didn't give
[1:02:24] you my title then. Let me just say this.
[1:02:27] It's kind of a part two. Anyway, our
[1:02:29] title last, if you haven't looked, the
[1:02:31] 31st was our glory, our revelation.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Today it's rapture revelation.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; And and and so I'm a subject is raptured
[1:02:42] faith.
[1:02:45] I am. Now, this may choke some people.
[1:02:47] Just you stay with me in the message. I
[1:02:49] am. I don't say I am. I'm talking about
[1:02:51] personal, but put it to you. I am the
[1:02:55] rapture.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; What is happening? There's a going in
[1:03:01] and a coming in his bride. There is a
[1:03:03] secret catching away.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't want to make it so secret
[1:03:07] that but well, I will make it so secret.
[1:03:09] There it's so secret that only the bride
[1:03:11] can have it.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; That's that's what it is. All right. So,
[1:03:17] now let's go back over here to verse 17.
[1:03:19] Now the Lord. Now verse 18, excuse me.
[1:03:22] But we all with open face. Open means
[1:03:26] unveiled.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; So whose face is unveiled?
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; It goes on to say who it is. Beholding
[1:03:32] is in a glass which is the promise. The
[1:03:34] word beholding is in a glass. The glory.
[1:03:38] The glory.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Well, brother David, he won't share his
[1:03:42] glory with another. He will. He will
[1:03:44] not. That's correct. But he will share
[1:03:46] it with himself.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:03:50] Amen. And you're not another. So you are
[1:03:53] his glory. We could take that a lot of
[1:03:55] places.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. We could go to the 17th chapter of
[1:03:59] John and said, "Lord, give them I give
[1:04:01] them my glory."
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Okay. So he said now, so
[1:04:08] we're looking at this 18th verse again.
[1:04:10] But we all with open Who's we all?
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I trust you're one of the we all
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; open face beholding as in a glass the
[1:04:18] glory of the Lord are changed.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; I task you what is rapture?
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Rapture is a change.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Rapture means caught up.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope you understand before the
[1:04:33] end of this service what that is and and
[1:04:36] what it pertains to and that it's not
[1:04:38] all something all out in the future.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Right. There is a part of that still in
[1:04:44] the future.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; But what takes us there is what I'm
[1:04:47] speaking of today.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; All right. So, so you realize then that
[1:04:53] we have see as in a glass the glory of
[1:04:56] the Lord are changed into the same image
[1:04:59] from what? Glory to glory. In another
[1:05:01] scripture it said from faith to faith.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; From revelation to revelation we are
[1:05:07] being changed.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; How many's growing?
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. The path of the justice as a
[1:05:13] shining light that shineth unto that
[1:05:16] perfect day. Is that right? There is a
[1:05:18] proceeding forth. There is a going. The
[1:05:21] prophet saw them marching. Where were
[1:05:23] they going?
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; He saw him go the first time out and
[1:05:27] back again restored. The same bride. He
[1:05:30] said coming right back here. Not the
[1:05:32] same people, the same bride.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; What she is, who she is. bride coming
[1:05:38] marching here in step with the word.
[1:05:42] Amen. And she didn't go down. She she
[1:05:44] walked and as she walked, she went up.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Something was happening in their march.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Something was taking place.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; They were on the move. Amen.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; All right. And the prophet said, "This
[1:06:00] thus sayeth the Lord, the move is on for
[1:06:02] the bride."
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "The move is on." So
[1:06:07] what about where are we moving?
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; We're leaving here.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; We are now leaving here.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Brother David, I don't
[1:06:17] see you leaving." It's got to come to
[1:06:18] that, like Brother David said Wednesday,
[1:06:20] it's got to come to that moment.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; That we'll leave here.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly. And who's looking
[1:06:28] for the moment? I'm looking for the
[1:06:30] moment because that's the moment we're
[1:06:32] we're we're growing into, moving into,
[1:06:35] walking into.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Who are you walking with? You're walking
[1:06:41] with God.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Not God off here somewhere. God in you.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; You're walking with God.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; And in him carries everything you have
[1:06:51] need of.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; And he's in you.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. All right. I don't want
[1:06:59] to get too far ahead of myself here. All
[1:07:01] right. Now, so it's from faith to faith,
[1:07:04] from glory to glory. He is not he will.
[1:07:08] He is changing me.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; I got it.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Yep. We do. All right. Now, Romans 8 or
[1:07:18] Romans 62, I'm sorry. Romans 62 or exc
[1:07:22] Romans Ma or Psalm 62, excuse me. Psalm
[1:07:26] 62
[1:07:29] and verse six.
[1:07:31] I'm I say I'm laying this out that I've
[1:07:33] got some things I'd like to share with
[1:07:35] you on what the prophet said. Brother,
[1:07:37] sister, I have only one way to preach
[1:07:39] it. Paul has a way to preach it. God has
[1:07:40] ordained these things in the way we must
[1:07:43] preach the word. You say, "I don't like
[1:07:45] the way he preaches. I don't like. No,
[1:07:46] you just need to get your mind off of
[1:07:48] that and hear and hear what God's trying
[1:07:50] to say and then judge it not by what you
[1:07:52] see and how you feel about the matter,
[1:07:54] but by the word.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So Psalm 62:6, he only
[1:08:02] is my revelation.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; When the prophet preached the message
[1:08:07] shalom, he took this scripture and he
[1:08:09] said rock in in the Bible means
[1:08:11] revelation. So he said David is saying
[1:08:13] God is my revelation.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so run as a revelation
[1:08:19] unveiling. And so you so you so the
[1:08:22] third pull is the unveiling of
[1:08:24] something. Amen.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; The third pull is the unveiling of the
[1:08:30] word.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; And it's not written with an iron pen.
[1:08:35] It's not written in a in stone. It's
[1:08:37] written in your heart.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Right? So, you're holding a mystery.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; It's no longer a mystery now to you.
[1:08:45] It's it's a reality.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; A secret
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; revealed.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was a hidden mystery. Now it's
[1:08:54] a re Now the mysteryy's been opened. How
[1:08:57] many know that's true? The seven seals
[1:08:59] open. The mystery is opened.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now
[1:09:06] he says right here he said God is he
[1:09:09] only is my rock my salvation.
[1:09:13] He is my defense. I shall not be moved.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; I shall not be. How many's going to camp
[1:09:22] on that and say that I believe that with
[1:09:24] all my heart. I shall not be moved.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; There's not enough pressure. There's not
[1:09:29] enough confederation of churches.
[1:09:31] There's not enough denominational spirit
[1:09:33] around the message to move it.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; I didn't say it was in the message
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; around it.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; It's God. Satan isn't going to wait out
[1:09:41] there. He's coming down here so close it
[1:09:44] would deceive the elect if possible
[1:09:46] because both the elect and non-elect can
[1:09:49] be anointed and anointed by the same
[1:09:50] spirit.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; But one is the word and the other cannot
[1:09:54] be the word.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So the so the the
[1:10:00] evidence is not your emotion. The
[1:10:02] evidence is not your gift and we believe
[1:10:03] in it. Evidence is not signs and
[1:10:05] wonders. Though we believe in it and we
[1:10:06] believe it happens and we're looking for
[1:10:08] God to move by his word today. We we
[1:10:11] want that to happen. But the revelation
[1:10:14] of the word for the season is the
[1:10:15] evidence the Holy Ghost is in you
[1:10:17] dwelling.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he's opened up that word
[1:10:23] in you.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in the beginning was the
[1:10:27] logos. The logos was with the with God.
[1:10:29] And the logos was God.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; And you is with God. How was it with
[1:10:34] God? Because the logos is a thought.
[1:10:36] It's a concept. And it was in God
[1:10:38] working. It was alive. It was living.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; It was substance. And he spoke what was
[1:10:43] substance into word.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; And you have to be here in your hour
[1:10:47] because you're that spoken word bride
[1:10:50] for the season.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; There is the word. That's why the word
[1:10:56] is our absolute. That's why the word is
[1:10:58] our absolute. It's our abs. It's our
[1:11:01] It's our amen. It's the final say
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; over every feeling, over every
[1:11:06] sensation, no matter what anyone else
[1:11:08] says or thinks.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; That word is our absolute.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; And so he said, "God is my rock. I shall
[1:11:15] not be moved. Trust in him." Oh, excuse
[1:11:17] me.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Excuse me. Yeah. No, verse seven. In God
[1:11:21] is my salvation. In God is my salvation.
[1:11:25] My glory, the rock of my strength, and
[1:11:27] my refuge is in God. And I'm safe to say
[1:11:30] in God is my rapture.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Because everything I ever could be or
[1:11:37] ever would be is in God.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. There you are. So, so now we go
[1:11:43] here to Romans 8. And that'll be the
[1:11:45] last of the scriptures for just a moment
[1:11:47] here. Romans chapter 8.
[1:11:51] Very familiar scriptures. I'm glad the
[1:11:54] scriptur is familiar. But oh, I'm so
[1:11:56] happy when he opens it up.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're growing. See, you got to
[1:12:01] recogn I want you to forget you're
[1:12:03] growing.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; There was a planting time and now
[1:12:06] there's a growing time.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; There's a former rain and there's a
[1:12:11] latter rain.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; And the latter rain is a harvest rain.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what has been planted has now
[1:12:19] got to grow up and mature and grow into
[1:12:22] something.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we grow up, the Bible
[1:12:28] said, into the head,
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; even Christ.
[1:12:34] Amen. All right. Now, so we we we we go
[1:12:37] in here.
[1:12:41] I should have made this this pause a
[1:12:43] little bit longer. All right. Now, all
[1:12:46] right. Romans 8:29.
[1:12:51] If I'm too loud, you forgive me. I'm
[1:12:53] kind of a loud preacher. Romans 8:29.
[1:12:58] And the Bible says, "For whom he did
[1:13:00] forno,
[1:13:01] he also did predestinate." We'll come to
[1:13:04] this in just a moment. In a little
[1:13:05] quote, the prophet says, "Here's the
[1:13:07] evidence. Moreover, whom he did for
[1:13:09] predestinate for excuse me for know he
[1:13:12] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:13:15] image of his son that he might be the
[1:13:17] firstborn among many brethren.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Where were those brethren?
[1:13:24] When he was born
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; when he that firstborn where were the
[1:13:28] brethren where were the brethren when he
[1:13:29] went to Calvary where was his brethren
[1:13:31] when he rose
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; in him.
[1:13:36] Amen.
[1:13:38] You were always in him.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; You just wrote said it in your song.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; He was always here.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. You just couldn't
[1:13:46] realize who was here.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Satan couldn't come in and take you out
[1:13:51] of being here. He had to He couldn't
[1:13:53] touch you because God had predestinated
[1:13:55] you to be where you are.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And to receive him in due time.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Come to realization. It's not your
[1:14:04] doing. It's not our doing. It's nobody's
[1:14:06] doing. It's his doing.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; It's his achievement.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So now verse 30.
[1:14:13] Moreover, whom he did predestinate them,
[1:14:16] he also called. And whom he called, them
[1:14:18] he also justified, declared righteous.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; As though you never did it in the first
[1:14:23] place. He justified. And those that he
[1:14:26] justified them he also has.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Say it.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; What? Why, brother David,
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; you're telling me right now you're
[1:14:38] glorified?
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; He hath already done it.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; But I've got to step into it.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; My body isn't glorified yet,
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; but that inside of me, the real me is a
[1:14:52] glor is glorified and already in his
[1:14:55] glory and walking to a glorified body.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. All right. Now,
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; all right. So, whom he justified, them
[1:15:05] he also glorified
[1:15:08] Jesus Christ. Brother Brham, here's what
[1:15:10] he said. What is the new birth then,
[1:15:11] brother Brandham?
[1:15:13] He said, "Christ in you would make you
[1:15:15] the complete revelation of the whole
[1:15:17] thing."
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Just the quote above that. Then he said,
[1:15:19] "What is the new birth, brother
[1:15:21] Brandham?" You may ask me. He said, "The
[1:15:22] new birth is Jesus Christ revealed in
[1:15:25] you personally."
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not another person.
[1:15:31] Different body, different flesh, but
[1:15:33] same person.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, so Jesus Christ,
[1:15:39] this is a quote that he said also. Jesus
[1:15:41] Christ the new birth revealed in you.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the new birth. You say,
[1:15:47] "I'm born again, Brother David. Then who
[1:15:48] are you?"
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus Christ the new birth. You
[1:15:55] say, "I got to be born again." Well,
[1:15:57] that is a new birth then.
[1:15:59] He had to come. Word had to come to
[1:16:01] word. He had to come to himself. He had
[1:16:03] to bring life to himself. He had to
[1:16:05] bring life to that word because in him
[1:16:07] was a mystery. And that mystery was the
[1:16:09] same mystery that was in Adam now in Eve
[1:16:12] form.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, now, so the mystery of
[1:16:18] Adam was Eve.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; It wasn't even Eve then. It was Mrs.
[1:16:21] Adam.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right?
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; She took on the name Eve because she was
[1:16:26] the mother of all living. But Adam was
[1:16:29] not the father of all living.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; So she bore two seeds.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. She did.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Then her name was Eve.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; It couldn't be Mr. Adam at that time
[1:16:44] because Mr. Adam wouldn't have couldn't
[1:16:47] have bore that child. Couldn't have
[1:16:48] given life to her womb for a serpent
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; seed.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; The only seed he could give was God's
[1:16:55] own seed. That's right.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I'll leave it right
[1:17:00] there. I'm not preaching serpent seed
[1:17:01] this morning, but it sure tied in right
[1:17:03] then. All right. Now,
[1:17:06] now that's why the full birth is not
[1:17:08] just repentance.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; It's repent and be baptized
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ, which is
[1:17:15] the the which is father, son, and holy
[1:17:18] ghost.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; The name of father, son, and holy ghost.
[1:17:22] The name of that is one God. That's
[1:17:25] Jesus Christ the Lord. So in the name of
[1:17:27] the Lord Jesus Christ, you you standing
[1:17:30] there as a personal witness, as a
[1:17:32] testimony. I believe what he did for me
[1:17:34] at Calvary. I believe the blood was shed
[1:17:36] for me and I'm willing to take his name
[1:17:39] and die with him in representation of
[1:17:41] that before the people
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; as a witness.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Then he said, "You do
[1:17:48] that, you'll raise you raised back up
[1:17:50] again as Christ raised from the dead,
[1:17:52] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:17:54] Holy Ghost, which is eternal life in
[1:17:56] you.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; The gift of God is a free gift."
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; But it's only given to a certain class
[1:18:02] of people.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those that will believe, those
[1:18:06] that have the rea revelation of what
[1:18:08] happened on Calvary, you're taking his
[1:18:11] word. You believe what he said. You're
[1:18:13] showing it to the people. You're being
[1:18:15] baptized in his name. I don't know why
[1:18:17] I'm bringing this in, but I'm going to
[1:18:18] inject this in anyway. He said, "And you
[1:18:21] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:18:22] Ghost, which is eternal life, which is
[1:18:25] himself living in you."
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; You shall receive the true baptism of
[1:18:34] the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Which there's no other way to get into
[1:18:37] the body of Christ except you're born
[1:18:39] again. And to be born again is be filled
[1:18:42] with the spirit. Is that right? So by
[1:18:44] one spirit are we all baptized or
[1:18:46] birthed into one body
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; and that one body is none other than
[1:18:50] Jesus Christ our savior and salvation.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. We were in him a part of him.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; All right. This all had to be restored
[1:19:01] to the bride in this hour. All right.
[1:19:03] Now
[1:19:04] so we come back here
[1:19:08] now. So so Jesus Christ the new birth
[1:19:10] revealed in you. Christ revealed in you
[1:19:12] personally. You drink and eat the
[1:19:15] revealed word of the hour. Other words,
[1:19:17] you're drinking and eating of the
[1:19:18] message. And by doing so, you're growing
[1:19:21] up into him,
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; the rapture.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; You're growing into him, the rapture.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; There's no other place of rapture but in
[1:19:32] him.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. We could go to a
[1:19:35] scripture right now, but I'm going to
[1:19:36] wait and come to it later. on the
[1:19:38] message the token your life is gone and
[1:19:41] you are dead and your life is dead. You
[1:19:43] are hid in God through Christ sealed in
[1:19:46] there by the Holy Spirit. The Bible said
[1:19:48] the Holy Spirit is the seal
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; to the day of your redemption.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Once sealed, Satan cannot come in and
[1:19:55] break that revealed word inside your
[1:19:57] soul. He cannot break that seal.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; You're sealed in and Satan's sealed out.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; What about my errors and mistakes? The
[1:20:06] blood has already taken care of that.
[1:20:08] Your your confidence lays in the shed
[1:20:10] blood.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; You're behind the blood. You're you've
[1:20:12] gone in beyond the blood.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; You went on to the inside of the inside,
[1:20:16] the little room of your soul.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just not an anointing on your
[1:20:23] spirit out here,
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; which can happen, but unless that word's
[1:20:27] inside of you, you'll never see. You'll
[1:20:30] never realize that Christ is the Lord.
[1:20:32] You can't call him Lord without having
[1:20:35] without the having the new birth
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; because he can't be Lord until his new
[1:20:39] birth.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you following me? You go back
[1:20:42] to Corinthians there and find that out.
[1:20:44] But just to pass it on now. So the mind
[1:20:46] that was in Christ is in you. 2
[1:20:49] Corinthians or 1 Corinthians 2:16. Let
[1:20:52] the mind that was in Christ, the Bible
[1:20:54] said Philippians be in you. Amen. And
[1:20:58] the mind that was in Christ is in you.
[1:21:00] Because now you've moved from a natural
[1:21:03] carnal right
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; thought back to a revelation of who you
[1:21:06] are.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; The only thing could open that up was
[1:21:10] Christ opening the word to you
[1:21:12] personally
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; himself to you personally.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Then you have the mind of Christ and
[1:21:17] Christ and the Bible and the word is the
[1:21:20] same. In the beginning was the word. The
[1:21:23] word was with God. The word was God.
[1:21:25] Then you now listen. Then you and the
[1:21:28] word and God and Christ are the same.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; If he abide in me and my word in you.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; If he abide in me, when were you abiding
[1:21:40] in him, when were you a believer? He
[1:21:42] that believeth in me, though he were
[1:21:43] dead, yet shall he live. When were you a
[1:21:45] believer?
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Always.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world, you
[1:21:49] always were a believer.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; You can't become just a believer. You
[1:21:52] always were. But now it's revealed that
[1:21:54] you are.
[1:21:57] Because the the believer is the
[1:21:59] revelation or the faith of God moving in
[1:22:02] you.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 84 or 86 of perfect faith. The
[1:22:06] believer is any believers in here? The
[1:22:09] believer is the faith, the revelation of
[1:22:11] God himself. So we're not living by our
[1:22:14] own thinking. We're living by God's own
[1:22:16] faith,
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; which that faith was substance.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; And when it's revealed in you, it's not
[1:22:21] just a thought or not a hope. It's
[1:22:23] substance.
[1:22:25] All right. So he said, "Then you and the
[1:22:28] word and God and Christ are the same. If
[1:22:31] you abide in me and my word in you, ask
[1:22:33] what you will,
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; it'll be done."
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Who's leading that? Who's directing
[1:22:38] that? Jesus said, "I can do nothing
[1:22:40] until my father reveals that to me."
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; And he said, "That same harmony will
[1:22:44] exist between his bride and the groom."
[1:22:47] And Jesus said,"I only do what the
[1:22:49] father tells me to do, shows me to do,
[1:22:52] and the bride can do nothing else but do
[1:22:54] what he said do."
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; It's so it's not your figuring it out.
[1:22:58] It's it's not it's it's it's it's
[1:23:01] the faith. Hold fast the faith. Amen.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Hold fast the confession of your faith.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; See, confession is a confession of
[1:23:14] faith. You think God's going to honor
[1:23:16] that? Certainly because your confession
[1:23:18] is God's faith
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; in you, the revelation in you, God
[1:23:21] leading you. You're doing things at his
[1:23:24] ordering, his leadership. So rest. Let
[1:23:28] go, little bride.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; The move is on. All right. Now,
[1:23:34] getting on here.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; I don't want to get too sidetracked on
[1:23:37] these things. Time. when you are planted
[1:23:39] into his death, burial, and re and
[1:23:41] resurrection planted in Christ and
[1:23:44] receive the Holy Spirit life in you.
[1:23:46] Everything that you got that you that
[1:23:49] you've got need of all through the
[1:23:51] journey, you're in a journey.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; All I've been on the journey quite a
[1:23:56] while
[1:23:57] and I I'm not making point of I'm not
[1:24:00] meaning that means anything. It's like
[1:24:01] brother Paul said, I think it was last
[1:24:02] night. It don't matter how long you've
[1:24:04] been, you know, at a late hour like
[1:24:06] this, things that seed will mature a lot
[1:24:08] quicker than somebody come in a lot
[1:24:10] earlier.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; But they mature. Still they mature.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, so you've been on a
[1:24:17] journey a long time, but the word is
[1:24:19] becoming clearer. And what is happening?
[1:24:22] What's happening? The word is becoming
[1:24:23] personal.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; It's no longer me and and Lord out here.
[1:24:28] Where are you someplace else? No, it's
[1:24:30] in me. And the one that's in me, in my
[1:24:33] soul, is who I am.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Okay. Brother Brandham said it like
[1:24:39] this. The real you is the spirit of God
[1:24:41] in you.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Things that are to be. All right. Now,
[1:24:47] now, hallelujah. He said, "And when you
[1:24:51] planted, you're planted into his death,
[1:24:53] burial, and resed in Christ, receive the
[1:24:55] Holy Spirit life in you. Everything that
[1:24:57] you've got need of all the way through
[1:24:58] the journey is in you right then.
[1:25:02] So where is everything you need?
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; It's in you.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Christ in you is everything you need.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Let him open it as he wills to you. You
[1:25:13] don't have to study it and figure it out
[1:25:15] and be and fret about it. Let him open
[1:25:17] it.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Quit trying to figure it out. That
[1:25:22] that relieved me many years ago when I
[1:25:24] was a young man. I I got so burdened
[1:25:25] down. Why can't I understand? Why can't
[1:25:27] I? And the and I found out where prophet
[1:25:29] said, "Don't even try to understand it."
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Just let God reveal it as he will in his
[1:25:35] season
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; and his time.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. What did we just read here? Wait
[1:25:40] on the Lord.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to figure anything
[1:25:45] out. If Christ is in you, the Bible said
[1:25:48] when the spirit of truth comes in, he
[1:25:50] will lead you into where? All truth.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; There you are. So there's a there's
[1:25:56] there's got you've got to come the way
[1:25:57] the doctor prescribed it. Repent, be
[1:25:59] baptized, and you shall receive the gift
[1:26:01] of the Holy Ghost. Until you receive
[1:26:04] that Holy Ghost, that's the new birth.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a many a Christian,
[1:26:10] many a good person, many saved people
[1:26:13] that won't be in the bride.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they they they baptized
[1:26:19] the old Well, Lord, we baptized, right?
[1:26:22] But they stopped,
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; right? They didn't go on.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Probably because it wasn't in them to go
[1:26:28] on.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Now, there's going to be a group of
[1:26:32] people that isn't in them to go on.
[1:26:33] They're good people.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; They're called the tribulation saints.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; They're sanctified people.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; They are the same cloth the bride is
[1:26:42] made out of. Only the bride portion
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; is bride portion.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; The other is a remnant of it. Right?
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; They can't be in the bride. Therefore,
[1:26:54] they miss the rapture because they don't
[1:26:56] have the Holy Ghost in them.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just have to drop that in. If
[1:27:01] you have a question, ask your pastor.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. All right. Amen.
[1:27:09] Okay. Now, so then
[1:27:13] then you and the word are the same. And
[1:27:15] then all right. Now, hallelujah. He says
[1:27:18] when you become the seed everything you
[1:27:20] need of is right in you then be for you
[1:27:22] become the seed is see it God in his
[1:27:26] word
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; God in his word
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; what's being opened you are being opened
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; you are the word to be opened
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; God in his word hallelujah the Holy
[1:27:40] Ghost baptism yes sir and everything you
[1:27:42] have need of for life's journey even the
[1:27:45] rapture is in you right then.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Let me read that again. This is what
[1:27:51] we're coming to. The Holy Ghost baptism.
[1:27:53] Yes, sir. Everything you need for life's
[1:27:55] journey. Even the rapture is right in
[1:27:58] you. Then
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; from a little infant word, infant bride.
[1:28:03] Remember, brother Bram said five stars
[1:28:05] lined up. What was the astronomic heaven
[1:28:07] announcing? An infant bride coming
[1:28:10] forth.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; She'd been planted. She's be to come
[1:28:12] out, become forth. Amen.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Now, that was under that latter former
[1:28:16] rain, teaching rain, planting. Brother
[1:28:18] Brandham called it seed in the in in the
[1:28:21] uh uh spoken word, ris seed. He said
[1:28:24] that was the planting time. Remember,
[1:28:27] and I want you those that know the
[1:28:29] message, remember prophet said that this
[1:28:31] messenger of Revelations 10 and Malachi
[1:28:33] 4 does two things.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said that the former and
[1:28:38] latter rain would rain fall in the first
[1:28:39] month. So, he had to do two things.
[1:28:42] That's right.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; There was a planting rain and there's a
[1:28:45] got to be a a ladder rain or a harvest
[1:28:48] rain
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; to grow up what's been planted
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; into maturity. And that had to happen
[1:28:55] under the opening of those seven seals
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; because without that there been no move
[1:29:01] of God. Brother Bram said to move that
[1:29:03] bride until the opening of those seals.
[1:29:05] And he said till the revelation of those
[1:29:07] seven thunders would come forth that
[1:29:09] John couldn't write. He said it's not
[1:29:11] something outside the word. He said what
[1:29:13] he couldn't write is in the word.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not outside the word. You can't
[1:29:18] add to or take from it. It's in the
[1:29:21] word.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; But it's a mystery. It's a secret.
[1:29:24] What's it held up for? To bring the
[1:29:26] bride into her full position.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; The full revelation.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Who is the full revelation? The
[1:29:33] prophet's message. Revelation 10:7 said
[1:29:36] in the days,
[1:29:38] Amen. In the days of his ministry, the
[1:29:41] mystery of God would be finished.
[1:29:44] Finished means completed, sealed, done,
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; completed.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have enough to make rapture
[1:29:54] under this message. And the message was
[1:29:57] sent to us for the going home of the
[1:29:59] bride. So, let me read it again here.
[1:30:02] Remember
[1:30:08] Amen. Now,
[1:30:13] the rapture is in us now. Don't resent
[1:30:15] that. He said it's raptures right in you
[1:30:17] then when you're born of the spirit.
[1:30:19] Don't resent that. That's the truth. The
[1:30:21] rapture is in us now.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; I will prove it by the gospel. Those he
[1:30:28] has called, he justified. And those he
[1:30:30] had justified, he hath glorified.
[1:30:35] Then your glorification is in you now.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Your change.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; All right. Now I will prove it. Those
[1:30:43] who he called, he justified. Those that
[1:30:45] he justified, he hath glorified.
[1:30:46] Hallelujah. Then in heaven today, we're
[1:30:49] a glor. We are glorified in the presence
[1:30:52] of God right now.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Now you think he can change his mind
[1:30:56] about you, he can't change his mind
[1:30:58] about you.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:03] What kind of God would we serve if he
[1:31:05] could change his mind about who you are
[1:31:06] and what you are?
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; It's not up to you to produce that.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; It's up to you to follow what he said
[1:31:14] and he'll take care of the rest of it.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; It's up to you to give yourself daily,
[1:31:19] die, take up your cross and follow him.
[1:31:21] He'll take care of the rest of it.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; The word is either your absolute, the
[1:31:26] amen, the final say, or it isn't.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. You're sitting right
[1:31:30] here this morning under that right now.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Either is or it isn't.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Got it.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; All right. So,
[1:31:40] so it's in you right now. Those who he
[1:31:42] called, he just Okay, now I'm pushing.
[1:31:45] He said, "What's happening? You're
[1:31:47] glorified in his presence." Hallelujah.
[1:31:49] In heaven today, we're a glorified in
[1:31:52] the presence of God right now. I'm just
[1:31:53] pushing out to it. Amen. Glory. God's in
[1:31:58] his word,
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; in his tabernacle, in the secret of the
[1:32:05] tabernacle, in
[1:32:07] his house.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said you are the house.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; All right. You are his name. You are his
[1:32:16] presence. You are himself.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; You see what the devil wants to keep you
[1:32:22] bound with? Your reasoning, your
[1:32:24] feelings, your senses.
[1:32:27] Don't you add to the word or take. It's
[1:32:28] flawless. The word is flawless. It's
[1:32:31] it's perfect. You can't add to or take
[1:32:33] from it. All they said you accept it,
[1:32:35] water it, believe it, keep giving God
[1:32:38] praise for it, and don't you move off of
[1:32:40] that.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; And God will take care of it in its
[1:32:42] season.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so he said God's in his
[1:32:47] word. You believe it? All right. Growing
[1:32:50] into the full stature of Christ for me
[1:32:53] to live. Going back to scripture, for me
[1:32:55] to live is Christ. Philippians.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; For me to live is what?
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Christ. I My desire whether in life or
[1:33:04] death.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; My desire is that he be magnified.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Enlarged in me.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; The works that I do shall you do also.
[1:33:15] Only greater works than this shall you
[1:33:16] do.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. What was the works to be done?
[1:33:19] Believe on him whom God has sent.
[1:33:24] the works will follow.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. What's the Bible say? We are his
[1:33:28] workmanship created in Christ Jesus.
[1:33:31] Brother Brandham said when he said
[1:33:32] created in Christ Jesus, he said created
[1:33:34] in union with Jesus Christ
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; unto good works which he hath already
[1:33:40] before ordained that you should walk in
[1:33:41] them.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; So what do you got to do? Take him at
[1:33:46] his word.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Quit reasoning with yourself. Quit
[1:33:50] reasoning with the enemy. Eve reasoned
[1:33:53] with the devil.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; He broke the hole through the word,
[1:33:56] didn't he?
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; If she'd have stayed behind the word,
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; there hadn't been no fall.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so it's not by several
[1:34:04] words, by one word.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Now, the opening of Now, what is this?
[1:34:13] All right. Growing into the full stature
[1:34:14] for me to live as Christ. The opening of
[1:34:17] the seven, the the opening of the seals,
[1:34:20] which is the seventh seal. Revelation,
[1:34:23] the message of his going or coming going
[1:34:26] home of the bride.
[1:34:28] What is the seventh seal revelation?
[1:34:30] What are the seven thunder saying? What
[1:34:32] are they hiding? Whatever they're hiding
[1:34:35] is now open and it's opening to the
[1:34:37] bride.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; That's why some say, "Well, the seventh
[1:34:40] seal isn't open." And some say, "Oh,
[1:34:42] yes, it is open."
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; One can say that, both can say that by
[1:34:46] an intellectual conception. But you let
[1:34:48] that bride say that one time and it'll
[1:34:50] fulfill through her because God is now
[1:34:53] working in and through his bride. And
[1:34:55] that is the revelation of himself. The
[1:34:58] full revelation of himself.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, so,
[1:35:07] so the re the seventh seal revelation,
[1:35:09] the opening of the seals is the message
[1:35:12] of the seventh angel. The message of his
[1:35:14] coming.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; We are what now happening? going home.
[1:35:17] The bride is marching. She's going home.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; The move is on. Where are we going?
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; To another organization, another
[1:35:25] denomination? No. We've come out of that
[1:35:27] darkness. We've resurrected out of that
[1:35:29] darkness.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; This is the bride coming of Christ.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; That part had to be made manifest. That
[1:35:36] part had to be known or there would be
[1:35:38] no rapture.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Unless he took the book and laid
[1:35:42] claim on what he had redeemed,
[1:35:45] there would be no rapture.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; He had to lay claim on what he had
[1:35:50] already redeemed.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; That's the message. All right. So, the
[1:35:57] going home of the bride. So there, what
[1:35:59] John was then caught up in Revelations
[1:36:02] 4:1 to see things that would bring him
[1:36:05] into that body change.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it was. caught up
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; amen. And what was he caught up? He saw
[1:36:14] the very thing he saw in Revelations 1.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; The headstone.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Standing the very head himself standing
[1:36:21] in the midst of the bride clothed as a
[1:36:23] bride.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Did you know that?
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; All right. So now now latter rain or
[1:36:33] harvest rain upon this his seed planted.
[1:36:35] Joel 2 23-26. I'm not asking you to turn
[1:36:38] unless you want to. That's write it
[1:36:40] down. Says now it says God is going to
[1:36:43] restore. Verse 25. That's what the word
[1:36:45] said in Joel 2:25. Now verse 23. Be glad
[1:36:49] then you children of Zion and rejoice in
[1:36:52] the Lord your God. For he hath given you
[1:36:54] the former rain moderately and he will
[1:36:57] cause to come down for you the rain, the
[1:36:59] former rain and the latter rain in the
[1:37:02] first month. So they come together.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Prophet will do two things.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He had to have he had to bring us
[1:37:09] back. The doctrine, everything had to be
[1:37:11] restored back to his position. What for?
[1:37:14] He had to there had to be a planting.
[1:37:16] Brother Brandham said there were three
[1:37:17] seeds planted. I'll just drop this in.
[1:37:20] He said that um in 1965 he said one seed
[1:37:24] was planted by Billy Graham, the
[1:37:26] evangelical seed. The other seed was
[1:37:28] planted by old Roberts, which was a
[1:37:30] Pentecostal seed. And the next seed was
[1:37:33] himself
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; to the bride. He never left them. He
[1:37:37] stayed with them and said, "I'll return
[1:37:38] in the time of life and Sarah shall have
[1:37:42] that son."
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; He couldn't look at the unbelief that
[1:37:46] Sarah had because she was a part of
[1:37:49] Abraham.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; And neither can he look at our mistakes
[1:37:52] and failures because we are a part of
[1:37:55] our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Who was what was Abraham? He was that
[1:38:00] royal seed. What was he depending on?
[1:38:02] What did he see revealed through him to
[1:38:05] him? the royal seed.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; What was this? That speaking to that
[1:38:09] royal seed. So God planted a seed.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; But he said, "I'll return again." Amen.
[1:38:16] And bring that royal seed and grow it up
[1:38:18] into who I am for what purpose? The
[1:38:21] rapture.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; The body change.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; All right. Now,
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; so here we go. And he says that in in
[1:38:31] verse 23. Now God isn't going to plant a
[1:38:34] new church.
[1:38:35] God isn't going to plant in the former
[1:38:37] ray a new church.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; No. He's restoring what the canker were
[1:38:42] made and what the locust. He's planting
[1:38:44] the seed of the word. Malachi 4. He did
[1:38:47] what? Just exactly what he said he would
[1:38:49] do.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; All right. Then what's following that?
[1:38:54] There's got to be something coming to
[1:38:55] mature that seed.
[1:38:58] And that's a harvest rain.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I could spend a lot of time on
[1:39:03] that. I'm going to drop that in because
[1:39:05] there there could be just a single
[1:39:07] message on this. You understand? All
[1:39:09] right. Now, now
[1:39:12] he will cause the rain, okay, to come in
[1:39:14] the same God isn't going to plant a new
[1:39:16] church, but is going to bring his
[1:39:18] original planting back to original seed.
[1:39:22] Now see where brother Brandham was when
[1:39:23] he preached the message. God's original
[1:39:25] seed. What did he have to do? He was at
[1:39:28] a he was at a hanging point. Where do I
[1:39:31] go from here? What's happening from
[1:39:32] here? He knew there had to be a change,
[1:39:34] but what is it? And God said, "Pick up
[1:39:36] your pen."
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He said, "God, pick up
[1:39:40] your pen and start writing." And he
[1:39:42] wrote out what the revelation was that
[1:39:44] God wanted not only him to see, but us
[1:39:47] to see. And he answered the the question
[1:39:49] in his heart. Yeah.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; There has to be a harvest. There had to
[1:39:55] be a rain to bring it to maturity.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Not only is there rain, it's the same
[1:40:00] sun.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so
[1:40:12] all right.
[1:40:15] So he says here
[1:40:17] he's going he's not planting he's
[1:40:19] planting his original back he planting
[1:40:22] back to the original seed. He is go he's
[1:40:25] doing it as stated in verse 23 by the
[1:40:28] teaching or former reign. That is before
[1:40:31] the seals opened.
[1:40:34] Now watch a bride started to grow up.
[1:40:36] What do we have to come under?
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; The Pentecostal baptism. Are you with
[1:40:41] me?
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; All right. There had to be a change.
[1:40:44] Just like Sarah and Abraham had to have
[1:40:46] a change
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; in order to receive seed. They had to be
[1:40:52] changed,
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; They were changed. They came through it.
[1:40:55] Then they went down to Greer.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Then they came back and
[1:41:01] God visited Sarah as he said she would
[1:41:03] he would. And she conceived
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; after the change.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; So you've got to come through your
[1:41:10] Pentecost.
[1:41:13] Amen. In order to conceive the real
[1:41:16] seed, you've got to come through
[1:41:17] Pentecost.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've got to have that open, that
[1:41:22] faith to receive seed.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Now, when you receive seed, Brother Bram
[1:41:26] said in the seals, there's nothing to
[1:41:28] awaken the bride. But one year later,
[1:41:29] preaching recognizing your day in his
[1:41:31] message, he said, "What they haven't
[1:41:33] recognized is the bride been awakened."
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, though, then they're the
[1:41:40] corner turned. And many can't turn that
[1:41:42] corner.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; That's the problem. They're wanting to
[1:41:46] go back and hang on to the onto the
[1:41:48] message of Pentecost, which that message
[1:41:51] there will not bring you into a body
[1:41:53] change. That was a reformation.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the eagle message that the
[1:42:00] sight of God himself had to come forth
[1:42:02] and open up himself in order for you to
[1:42:05] come to yourself.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; All right. Now,
[1:42:12] so we're seeing here now he said next he
[1:42:16] said watch before the seals before the
[1:42:18] revelation 10 message you remember what
[1:42:21] the prophet said Revelation 10 message
[1:42:22] is the opening of the seventh seal he
[1:42:24] said no place it is the seventh seal
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; his message is the seventh seal
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; all right
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; because now we realize where our
[1:42:34] position is we have to be taken out of
[1:42:36] the way before he can come again to
[1:42:38] Israel
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; it's the secret catching away.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. He remember
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Jo Joseph bride was in the temple in the
[1:42:48] palace
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; when he made himself known to the
[1:42:51] brethren.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; She was taken out of the way.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; There was a going there. There was a
[1:42:56] secret catching away. She went out of
[1:42:58] the way. Mob moved. And what's the
[1:42:59] message now for us?
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; To see our position in Christ.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; To recognize what we are, who we are.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; All right. Right? And we're going to
[1:43:08] read that here in just a second. Not
[1:43:10] necessarily who you are, but what you
[1:43:12] are.
[1:43:13] That's I want to make that point right
[1:43:15] now. It's what you are. When she when
[1:43:18] she realizes what she is,
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; all right. Something's going to happen.
[1:43:24] And we're very, very close. I believe
[1:43:26] with all my heart, a bride's coming to
[1:43:28] the reality of what she is.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And it's going to produce.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; It's got to produce.
[1:43:37] Amen.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, the new birth,
[1:43:42] he said, so the seals open and the seals
[1:43:45] opening was harvest or latter rain. And
[1:43:47] this is what brother Bram said. He said,
[1:43:49] we've had the former rain. He said, next
[1:43:52] will come the harvest rain or rapturing
[1:43:56] faith. I got to say that again. Don't
[1:43:59] you miss this statement.
[1:44:01] He said, "Next will come the harvest
[1:44:03] rain or rapturing faith."
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; There's got to be something to bring
[1:44:10] this bride that faith in her to rapture.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Before her body change,
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so what's going to do
[1:44:22] it? Brother Ram said the third pull
[1:44:24] would do it.
[1:44:26] I can read and there's more to it than
[1:44:28] that, but I'll read it in a little bit
[1:44:29] here as we go on. Now,
[1:44:35] now in the message Christ, the mystery
[1:44:37] of God revealed, paragraph 240, the new
[1:44:39] birth is Christ's revelation, God has
[1:44:41] revealed to you this great mystery.
[1:44:46] And that's the new birth.
[1:44:51] So, what is Christ? The mystery of God
[1:44:53] revealed. And where is it? It's revealed
[1:44:55] in you.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Then the mystery of God is revealed.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; It's in you. And brother Ram called that
[1:45:03] that in you, Christ in you, God's great
[1:45:06] revelation.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen.
[1:45:12] So you mean there would be a revelation?
[1:45:14] That's God's great revelation. Remember,
[1:45:17] he had in his mind what he had in mind,
[1:45:19] his heart purpose, his sole purpose, his
[1:45:21] heart purpose was have a bride of his
[1:45:22] own choosing. paragraph 163, page 163 if
[1:45:26] you have the Brown church age book.
[1:45:30] Amen. That's where he said it.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; And that's his choosing.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. You going to take out of God's
[1:45:38] hands what he chose?
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; That choosing was in him.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, so
[1:45:48] God has revealed to you this great
[1:45:50] mystery, and that's a new birth. Now,
[1:45:52] you started at a birth, but you've got
[1:45:54] to grow,
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; The new birth is the baptism of the Holy
[1:45:58] Ghost. You have the Holy Ghost in you
[1:45:59] right now, but you got to grow up into
[1:46:01] adoption.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; You've got to grow up into the
[1:46:03] headstone. You have to become in the
[1:46:05] form of the head himself because why?
[1:46:08] The son of man would be revealed in
[1:46:10] another form. And that's bride form in
[1:46:12] this hour.
[1:46:16] Now, you hold that point because that's
[1:46:18] exactly what the prophet said it would
[1:46:19] be and must be to fulfill back to Eden
[1:46:23] again. There had to be a masterpiece
[1:46:25] family.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, now we see here God
[1:46:32] has revealed it. Now, what are you going
[1:46:34] to do when you get all that group
[1:46:36] together? Not necessarily in one
[1:46:37] building, but together where? In Christ.
[1:46:41] What are you going to do when you get
[1:46:42] all that group, the predestinated group,
[1:46:45] not another one, not one more, that
[1:46:48] group,
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; it's an individual affair, but it's
[1:46:50] still his body
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; in the bride form himself. All right.
[1:46:55] What are you gonna do when you get that
[1:46:56] group all together
[1:46:59] and perfectly in harmony when and God
[1:47:02] perfect when the revelation is perfectly
[1:47:05] in harmony. Not one instrument off here
[1:47:08] off tune and this one playing his own
[1:47:10] jingle over here and this one over here.
[1:47:12] No, in tune in harmony.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Same resonance,
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; same sympathetic vibration
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; hearing one voice.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You're under one voice.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; A many member bride, varied position,
[1:47:30] but one voice,
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; one person, one head.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; All right. Now,
[1:47:37] so what are you going to do now? Now,
[1:47:39] perfectly in harmony and God expressing
[1:47:41] it through his word by the same actions,
[1:47:45] the same things he did, the same things
[1:47:47] he did and the same things he did in
[1:47:50] other places. Brother Brham said he's
[1:47:51] doing now.
[1:47:53] the same things he did making the word
[1:47:56] manifest. Now, we just read it right
[1:47:58] here in 2 Corinthians 3.
[1:48:02] Making the word manifest through his
[1:48:04] word.
[1:48:05] So, see what were the what was the what
[1:48:08] was the second pull? What was the first
[1:48:09] second pull pointing to? of furthering,
[1:48:14] catching the attention of
[1:48:16] the bride
[1:48:18] to take them out of denominationalism to
[1:48:22] let them see their bridegroom.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Let us be glad and rejoice for the
[1:48:27] bridegroom comes and the lex seed rose
[1:48:31] up.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; I got it.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; And the others come along and said,
[1:48:34] yawn, brother said, "Oh yeah, I guess
[1:48:38] I'm in this movement. I ought to have
[1:48:39] some of that Holy Ghost, too.
[1:48:46] They didn't get it.
[1:48:48] Prophet made it very clear. They went to
[1:48:50] buy it. But when they come back, the
[1:48:52] bride's already gone.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; A secret.
[1:48:56] They didn't know it. They didn't know.
[1:48:59] When they come back, they were gone.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Where'd they go? Into union.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; To the inside of the inside. Into the
[1:49:05] little room. in in union with himself.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where's the message written? In
[1:49:12] your heart, in your soul.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Um,
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; okay. Now, so we go on here.
[1:49:23] All right. He said, now watch what he
[1:49:26] says.
[1:49:29] Oh, if the church only knew its
[1:49:32] position.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 240. or if the church only
[1:49:36] knew its position. Now, this is what
[1:49:39] struck me just about a week or so.
[1:49:41] Actually, be it struck me about two
[1:49:43] weeks ago and brother David preached on
[1:49:45] rapture.
[1:49:48] I'm not taking away anything. I'm just
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; absolutely
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; magnifying it a little more.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, now it's the ministry.
[1:49:57] You see, it's the ministry that does
[1:49:58] that.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Not the man. The ministry. Ministry of
[1:50:03] what? The word.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; And and if they stop the ministry and
[1:50:07] close it up, guess what? The ministry is
[1:50:09] finished.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Everyone's in their position.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Because we were we were we were per
[1:50:16] ministering the word for what purpose?
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; To bring the faith for rapture.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; To get them in their position. Speaking
[1:50:28] only what the prophet said, not adding
[1:50:30] to that or taking from it. But through
[1:50:32] that channel, you take away that channel
[1:50:36] and what have you got? Death.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; You take away the channel that God
[1:50:42] ordained for this ministry of this
[1:50:45] prophet
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; to come through.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Not another voice. You take away that
[1:50:50] channel and all you've got is a dead a
[1:50:52] dead church, a dead building, a dead
[1:50:55] whatever movement.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; It won't produce anything.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:02] Now, I trust you're hearing.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; All right. Now,
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, oh, if the church only
[1:51:09] knew his position, it will one day. Now,
[1:51:11] Brother Bams. Oh, it will. See, it will.
[1:51:13] No, I believe we're in the day.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; The will one day is our day.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; All right. It will one day. Then the
[1:51:22] rapture. Watch what he said. Then the
[1:51:24] rapture will go.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; What an odd statement. not come.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Go.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; The rapture will go.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Not come. He didn't say not come. And
[1:51:39] we're going to come into the here where
[1:51:41] it comes because it does come.
[1:51:45] But then it's got to go.
[1:51:47] All right. So, not come. What the
[1:51:50] rapture will go when it knows who he's
[1:51:54] talking about? The bride. When it knows
[1:51:57] what it is. Yeah.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes, it is too. It is the truth. He
[1:52:06] must have caught a thought. Well, that
[1:52:07] can't be truth, brother. Yeah, it is.
[1:52:09] It's the truth. The only way you know
[1:52:11] him is by revelation.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Boy, that's a statement. The only way
[1:52:17] you know him, to know him is life. Not
[1:52:20] to know about him, not to not to quote
[1:52:22] quotes, not to do all this, but to know
[1:52:24] him is life.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. That's what Satan
[1:52:30] will do everything he can. He doesn't
[1:52:32] want you to know him.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; And he does. By knowing him, you know
[1:52:35] what you are.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; All right. To know him is to know him.
[1:52:41] Only way to know him is by revelation,
[1:52:44] not by flesh.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? Paul never knew him
[1:52:50] by flesh.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Peter knew him by flesh, but pe
[1:52:55] that fled that that revelation didn't
[1:52:57] come by flesh.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? All right.
[1:53:02] Now, God can't change his way of doing
[1:53:03] things.
[1:53:06] Now, paragraph 578 of Christ the
[1:53:09] mystery. Now, we see the promise being
[1:53:11] fulfilled.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Whoa. Now, the prophet's coming right
[1:53:16] down here now taking what the seals are
[1:53:18] saying, what this is speaking. He's What
[1:53:20] is he preaching in this message? He's
[1:53:21] preaching the seventh seal,
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now we see the promise being
[1:53:27] not fully being."
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; It's been revealed, but it's being
[1:53:31] revealed. Growing other words, growing
[1:53:33] somewhere growing, growing and going.
[1:53:37] Now, we see the promise being fulfilled.
[1:53:39] Christ the true headship.
[1:53:42] Is that your true headship? Then don't
[1:53:45] you look at yourself anymore and try to
[1:53:47] figure these things out and look to how
[1:53:49] you feel as any evidence of your
[1:53:50] salvation or what he said.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, see, we see the
[1:53:58] promise being fulfilled.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; How many see it?
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; See to understand, see his revelation.
[1:54:05] Now, we're seeing the promise being
[1:54:07] fulfilled. Christ, the true headship
[1:54:10] going in. Woo!
[1:54:14] going in coming in his bride.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; So where's the message?
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Where's it moving?
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Christ is on the move. Going in.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; He's rapture. Christ is my rapture.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Going in. And and me and Christ the same
[1:54:33] person going in. Coming in.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; His bride.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; The mystery of God would be finished.
[1:54:44] Where are we going next?
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; To the third coming
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; back in the millennium.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; There it is. He comes three times. You
[1:54:52] know that third coming is when he and
[1:54:54] his bride step back on earth in the
[1:54:55] millennium upon the ashes of the wicked.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Is that right? What is that? What's
[1:55:00] going to happen there? Back to Eden.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Finish the finish and fulfill that
[1:55:06] seventh day.
[1:55:08] Amen. Right back. Right back again. God
[1:55:11] res has restored it completely. The
[1:55:13] ministry, the the the sewing, the the
[1:55:16] former rain, the latter rain is all one
[1:55:19] thing. It's a reviving. It's a restoring
[1:55:21] completely
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; God himself.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; What the calmer worm ate, the cankerworm
[1:55:27] eating, what the cankerworm ate, the
[1:55:28] palmer, so on and so forth.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Down to a root out down to a stump. But
[1:55:35] they couldn't get at the root.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Neither can you. You are the root and
[1:55:40] offspring.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:45] Amen. Amen. Of the king. Root and
[1:55:48] offspring of the king.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my. All right. Now,
[1:55:56] now, so,
[1:55:59] so now we see it fulfilled. Christ the
[1:56:02] true headship going in, coming in his
[1:56:04] bride. What are we, what are we visiting
[1:56:06] here? What is the bride seeing? a secret
[1:56:09] catching away,
[1:56:11] not known to the public. This cannot be
[1:56:14] known to the public until she's gone.
[1:56:17] And he who letth will now let until he
[1:56:19] Christ the bride is taken out of the
[1:56:22] way.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; There you are. All right. Now
[1:56:28] doing he said now happening now bride
[1:56:31] now it's because why? It's bride time.
[1:56:33] It's seed time.
[1:56:35] doing the same works that he did at the
[1:56:37] beginning and making ready
[1:56:41] and fulfilling his word as he did at
[1:56:44] first in John 14:12. He that believeth
[1:56:47] in me, the works that I do shall he do
[1:56:48] also. Then the head and the body are
[1:56:51] becoming one in works and in sign and in
[1:56:55] life, vindicated by God himself through
[1:56:57] his promised word for the last days. How
[1:57:01] is it being vindicated? through his
[1:57:03] promised word for the last days. The
[1:57:05] prom he promised this in the last days.
[1:57:09] You believe that?
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, if you're spiritual,
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; what's going to make you spiritual?
[1:57:16] Christ in you.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; It's not the man that's spiritual.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; It's the It's the mind of God in me and
[1:57:23] in you.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; That makes me spiritual. The Holy Ghost
[1:57:26] in you is the holy one.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Is the spiritual one.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; All right. So, so he that is spiritual,
[1:57:34] he that there's only one that's
[1:57:36] spiritual. That's Jesus Christ. He's the
[1:57:38] one in you.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; So, he that is spiritual.
[1:57:44] I lost my place here. Just a minute.
[1:57:48] No. If you're spiritual, you'll catch
[1:57:50] it.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Catch what?
[1:57:54] Rapture.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Going in. He's going in.
[1:58:01] Then paragraph 579. Then we can see by
[1:58:04] that then we can see the marriage supper
[1:58:07] is at hand.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Blessed is he who called to the marriage
[1:58:14] supper.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Because why? We recognize heaven opened.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And who do we see?
[1:58:24] Who's following him?
[1:58:27] Amen. All right. Now,
[1:58:31] now,
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; but to the church, the bride, rapture,
[1:58:36] paragraph 65. Now, listen carefully, and
[1:58:38] I'm not too far off of closing. But to
[1:58:41] the church, the bride, the rapture is a
[1:58:44] revelation to her.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:51] For the rapture.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; The rapture is a revelation. What? Now
[1:58:57] watch what else he said to her. It's not
[1:59:01] it's it's
[1:59:03] re it's a revelation to her. It's
[1:59:06] revealed to her.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Who else is going to get the revelation?
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; See, it's revealed to her that the
[1:59:13] revelation, the true bride of Christ
[1:59:16] will be waiting for that revelation
[1:59:19] of the rapture. Remember
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; what's coming to bring it. And then when
[1:59:25] does it go?
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; So she has something that's going.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; What is she? The rapture.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; And what is that rapture in you?
[1:59:40] Substance.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Not I hope I make it.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; You know you've made it because
[1:59:46] revelation is faith.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now it's a revelation. Now it is a
[1:59:52] revelation. And he said she'll be
[1:59:55] waiting. Now it is a revelation for the
[1:59:57] revelation is faith.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; You cannot have a revelation without it
[2:00:04] being faith.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; So the revelation is faith. And you
[2:00:08] cannot have a revelation without it
[2:00:10] being faith.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Faith is a revelation because it's
[2:00:16] something that's revealed to you.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Not everybody. Not a group. You.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:24] you faith is a revelation.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Now that's what faith is is the
[2:00:30] revelation of God.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Now you see what revel what John was
[2:00:35] caught up to see.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Okay. The rapture comes. What did he
[2:00:41] what did he see? One on the throne. Not
[2:00:44] two, not three. One on the throne.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:50] who was, which is, and shall come.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; What are we declaring? What are what is
[2:00:57] what is our ministry declaring? That
[2:01:00] which was, is, and shall come.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who is that? It's Jesus Christ,
[2:01:07] the Lord.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:13] Now, so we see here,
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; I got it,
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; the rapture goes comes, the rapture
[2:01:20] comes to go.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; I hope you caught that statement. The
[2:01:24] rapture comes to go.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Now, he cleared this up in the message
[2:01:29] rapture. He said, "I've got to hurry
[2:01:31] because I think they want us to leave."
[2:01:32] And he just really pressed, but he
[2:01:34] brings it clearly out how it comes.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Now, let's get this before we close
[2:01:39] here. He said, 'Now the rapture comes to
[2:01:42] go. The word rapture in the Bible is not
[2:01:44] even used at all. The word rapture.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; We just put the word there. The Bible
[2:01:49] says caught up.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Caught up. Being caught up is rapture.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; All right. We Now there there's a
[2:01:59] spiritual and a physical rapture.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Okay. You must have the spiritual
[2:02:05] revelation of the rapture before you can
[2:02:06] have a physical revelation of the
[2:02:08] rapture. That's God's way all the way
[2:02:10] through.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; When you have a revelation, you're
[2:02:14] healed. Nobody's going to move you off
[2:02:15] of that. You've already got a substance.
[2:02:17] When you have the revelation of the
[2:02:18] rapture, nobody's going to move you off
[2:02:19] of that. You've already You're already
[2:02:21] there. He has glorified. It's a
[2:02:23] revelation to you. It's substance.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; And it won't have to work it up, make it
[2:02:29] up, happen. It's going to happen. It's
[2:02:31] going to be pro. It's going to be
[2:02:33] manifested.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because you're in a higher
[2:02:36] plane, misunderstood, ridiculed, rat,
[2:02:38] but what's that got to do with it?
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Well, that hurt my feelings. Let go of
[2:02:42] your feelings.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; God's not judging you by your feelings.
[2:02:46] Why are you letting somebody else judge
[2:02:47] it?
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Why are you judging yourself by your
[2:02:50] feelings?
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Take the word. What the word say for you
[2:02:54] to do? If you want a new birth, what did
[2:02:56] the word say for you to do?
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; There's got to be justification,
[2:03:00] sanctification, and the baptism of the
[2:03:02] Holy Ghost. Go to first John five and
[2:03:04] read it.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Three that bear witness in the earth and
[2:03:08] they bear witness of what? One thing.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; All right. And there's and there and
[2:03:15] these three are one. So what are you
[2:03:16] going to do when it comes down and you
[2:03:18] haven't been haven't fulfilled or taken
[2:03:21] God at his word. You know there's only
[2:03:23] three things that God said he's required
[2:03:25] you to do outward in an outward thing be
[2:03:28] just in in physical things to be done.
[2:03:31] foot washing,
[2:03:33] communion, and water baptism.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Everyone else, everything else depends
[2:03:38] on your faith.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; And the victory, our victory is our
[2:03:43] faith. What is my faith? Jesus Christ
[2:03:46] the rapture. That's the faith.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, now, Brother Brandham
[2:03:55] makes this statement on God and
[2:03:56] simplicity Albuquerque. How do you know
[2:03:58] the rapture is not going on all the
[2:04:00] time?
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; See, what we call rapture, what the
[2:04:07] earth calls rap, what the denominations
[2:04:09] call rapture isn't rapture at all.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; It's already happening and they don't
[2:04:14] know it.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Got to come to a climax. If they miss
[2:04:19] what's happening, they won't see the
[2:04:20] climax.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; It's hidden.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; Tribulations dates did not know when
[2:04:26] that bride left. Yeah, that's right.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; They couldn't get the message.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I'm not putting anybody
[2:04:38] in or anybody out.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; I'm placing
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; those two.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, the scripture already
[2:04:48] placed them. I You say, "Well, I guess
[2:04:51] if that's me." No, I wouldn't say that.
[2:04:53] It shows you what's in your soul. I
[2:04:54] would say I'm going to be that bride.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; If I have to I'm if I've got to die, let
[2:04:59] me die, Lord. I don't care what it is.
[2:05:01] You work your work in me. I will be in
[2:05:03] that bride because that's that's written
[2:05:05] of me. I accept it. I believe it. That's
[2:05:07] your word you've given me.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; That settles it.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Don't you let the devil point down that
[2:05:12] reasoning to you and say, "Well, I guess
[2:05:14] you know,
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; you know, the battleground is your
[2:05:18] mind."
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, now
[2:05:24] let's go on here just a little bit
[2:05:27] further.
[2:05:35] So, we know the marriage supper is at
[2:05:36] hand. It's a revelation to her. The
[2:05:39] rapture. All right. Now, the word in the
[2:05:42] rapture not used at all. We just put the
[2:05:44] word in. The Bible said caught up. Being
[2:05:46] caught up. Read it here in 2
[2:05:48] Thessalonians. Okay. Now, I'll read that
[2:05:50] in just a minute. How do you know the
[2:05:52] rapture is not going on all the time?
[2:05:53] Paragraph 303.
[2:05:56] First thing you know, it'll be passed
[2:05:58] one be it'll be passed one disappearing
[2:06:01] here and there. It'll be gone. You know
[2:06:04] what?
[2:06:05] Spiritually, we've already done
[2:06:07] disappeared.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that?
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; Spiritually, not physically,
[2:06:14] you've already crossed over.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; You're already in rapture.
[2:06:18] You are that revelation that's revealed
[2:06:21] to you.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; If that revelation's too far from you,
[2:06:24] why don't you just instead of reasoning
[2:06:26] with it, why don't you just go back to
[2:06:27] what the word promised and say, "God,
[2:06:28] reveal it to me."
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; You're that rapture and you've revealed
[2:06:33] yourself in me. Then Lord, open the
[2:06:35] word. Open that rapture to my heart. Let
[2:06:37] it become substance in me.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, here here and
[2:06:44] there, it'll be gone.
[2:06:47] The first thing you know, the first
[2:06:48] thing you know, it'll be gone. What?
[2:06:50] What he said? Excuse me.
[2:06:54] The whole secret,
[2:06:56] the whole
[2:06:59] whole thing is a secret catching away.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; Judgment will strike. Before you know
[2:07:06] it, he said judgment will strike the
[2:07:08] world. And you say, I thought this, it's
[2:07:11] too late now. Watch what he said. The
[2:07:14] foolish virgin didn't know until she
[2:07:16] come back and found the wise virgin
[2:07:18] gone.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Then she was left for the tribulation.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Now, we won't go into how she saved or
[2:07:27] was she saved in the in I could we could
[2:07:29] give an answer to that. If she is she
[2:07:31] saved at the white throne judgment. You
[2:07:33] realize the bride's not standing.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; She's judging.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; She's not standing before the throne
[2:07:39] being judged. Her judgment is now the
[2:07:43] opening of this book judges you.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; That's your judgment right there. It's
[2:07:50] either written of you or it isn't.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; And if and when it's written of you, how
[2:07:55] can the judge say nothing else but case
[2:07:57] dismissed?
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; This name cannot be taken from that book
[2:08:00] because they're my property.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; I've already declared them righteous.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; All right. Now don't miss this. He says,
[2:08:12] "Now 1 Thessalonians 4:16, now watch the
[2:08:15] answer how it comes. The Lord himself
[2:08:17] shall descend from heaven with a shout,
[2:08:20] with the voice of the archangel, and the
[2:08:21] trump of God, and the dead in Christ
[2:08:23] shall rise first." Now, I want you to
[2:08:26] notice a great thing taking place here.
[2:08:28] Don't miss this. See, now notice the
[2:08:30] word says here in 2 Thessalonians that
[2:08:32] there's three things. Notice from the
[2:08:35] 13th to the 16th verse, there's three
[2:08:37] things that has to happen before the
[2:08:39] Lord himself appears.
[2:08:43] What's what's he speaking of? Before you
[2:08:44] meet him in the air, there's three
[2:08:46] things have got to happen. Well, and
[2:08:49] when do they happen? Quickly now so we
[2:08:51] can close. The first thing happens,
[2:08:52] notice a shout, a voice, a trumpet.
[2:08:56] Jesus does all three of them.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; When he descending.
[2:09:02] Yes, sir.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; Now, we've seen him. The picture was
[2:09:05] taken of him. He's appeared as he
[2:09:07] promised in the word again.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; And who's he coming to to receive his
[2:09:12] bride? And while he descends, he's
[2:09:15] making himself uniting with that bride.
[2:09:18] Who is the headstone?
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just turn the picture to the
[2:09:22] right.
[2:09:24] There he is in the cloud. Just exactly
[2:09:27] what the two angels notice when he comes
[2:09:29] back to Israel. There's two witnesses
[2:09:31] that declares coming.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And two witnesses when
[2:09:35] he left said this same Jesus
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; who you seen go
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; in veveloped in a cloud will likewise so
[2:09:44] return.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; And as he descends, what's he descending
[2:09:53] for? Uniting with his body, the bride.
[2:09:55] As he descends, he does all three
[2:09:57] things. What's the voice of? The
[2:10:00] resurrection. What's the shout? The
[2:10:01] message,
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; the voice, the trump. Last trump.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; It's at the last trump.
[2:10:08] We are caught up and changed.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me now? It's a
[2:10:12] gathering. Did not did not the Bible say
[2:10:15] we are Paul said we are gathered
[2:10:16] together by the coming of the Lord.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; We are being gathered together. What
[2:10:20] about now?
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we just said what what
[2:10:25] about when that group gets together? All
[2:10:27] right. Now, well, there's going to be a
[2:10:30] gathering. There's going to be a
[2:10:31] quickening. They're going to rise first.
[2:10:32] You're going to your loved one will
[2:10:34] appear before you.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; But you've already got rapture.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; It just has to go.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; There's a moment of it going right
[2:10:42] there.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. The coming of it is coming right
[2:10:46] through this message.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, through the voice. All
[2:10:50] right.
[2:10:52] That's why you must eat the book. Don't
[2:10:54] worry about it. You don't sit down to a
[2:10:56] meal say now this and this. Some people
[2:10:58] do. They get real picky on this and this
[2:10:59] and this and this. You know, I got to
[2:11:01] eat this and this will do this and you
[2:11:02] just sit down and you eat it and that
[2:11:05] you expect the food to do what it's
[2:11:06] called and purposed to do
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; and you thank God for it and you blessed
[2:11:10] it.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; What about
[2:11:14] eternal food?
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; What about the open book?
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't want to I don't want to
[2:11:20] bear the the the the purging and the
[2:11:22] persecution. I want to bear all this. I
[2:11:24] don't want to bear all that against me.
[2:11:25] I'll act like a crazy man. and I'll be
[2:11:27] different.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; You're not willing to be different,
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; then you're not willing to die to
[2:11:34] yourself.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; You have to die.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Die to yourself. Give yourself over
[2:11:43] submission. Surrender completely and let
[2:11:45] God work through you.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Your brother Luke,
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; it's your birthday.
[2:11:55] Is that your birthday today?
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; No, you said Luke's birthday. Who's
[2:12:00] Luke? It was on the request.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I just figured. Sorry,
[2:12:07] brother. I I just thought of that just
[2:12:09] immediately and I thought, well,
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; huh,
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; just a greeting.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, it said birthday. Happy birth at
[2:12:15] a birthday. So, I Okay, I could be
[2:12:18] wrong. It's a greeting. Greeting,
[2:12:20] brother Luke. God bless you.
[2:12:23] All right. Now I'll relax you for what's
[2:12:26] coming.
[2:12:27] Okay. Now, now three things. Jesus does
[2:12:31] all three of them while he's descending.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Note.
[2:12:36] All right. Hebrews 11:5. Genesis 5:24. I
[2:12:40] won't read them to you, Wes. Yes, I
[2:12:41] will. Genesis 5:24. Very familiar
[2:12:43] scripture. I'm just going to take just
[2:12:46] about you. Give me five minutes here and
[2:12:47] I think I'll be done. Genesis. I'm a
[2:12:50] hour and a half preacher. I don't care
[2:12:51] how you slice it. I've tried and tried.
[2:12:54] Amen. Genesis 5:24
[2:13:04] and very familiar scripture, but seventh
[2:13:06] from Adam is our position right now.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; And Enoch walked with God after he begat
[2:13:13] Methuselah 300 years and begat sons and
[2:13:16] daughters. And all the days of Enoch
[2:13:18] were 365 years. And Enoch walked with
[2:13:21] God and he was not.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we can say we are a was not.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; I'm not part of this world. He was not.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; God took him. So there was a taking.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; There's something coming to take you.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, Genesis, Hebrews,
[2:13:48] Hebrews chapter 11.
[2:13:52] And I because I have a something I want
[2:13:54] to follow up right real quick here.
[2:13:55] Hebrews 11 verse 5. By faith, uhoh.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; By faith,
[2:14:02] Enoch was translated.
[2:14:06] I wonder if he had a revelation of the
[2:14:07] rapture.
[2:14:10] By faith, Enoch was translated that he
[2:14:12] should not see death. And there's going
[2:14:14] to be people see death. Now, don't get
[2:14:16] me wrong, that doesn't take away the
[2:14:17] revelation.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; Fle said, "See death in this flesh." But
[2:14:22] that won't take the rapture away.
[2:14:25] Should not see death and was not found
[2:14:27] because God had translated him. For
[2:14:29] before his translation, he had this
[2:14:32] testimony that he pleased God. Watch
[2:14:34] what the prophet says here. Um,
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; remember when they went to buy oil, talk
[2:14:40] about the foolish virgin. He said, "Now
[2:14:42] wait a minute, brother Bam. I don't know
[2:14:44] about that. When they went to buy oil,
[2:14:46] they came back. The bride was gone. The
[2:14:47] door was shut. They knocked and said,
[2:14:49] "Let us in. Let us in." But they were in
[2:14:51] outer darkness. Now, if you want a type
[2:14:54] of that, that's what I'm coming to. But
[2:14:57] Enoch walked before God for 500 years
[2:15:00] and had a testimony. He pleased God
[2:15:02] with, how did he please God? with
[2:15:05] raptured faith.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; What's the harvest rain going to do?
[2:15:09] What's it do? Brings hap raptured faith.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; How's it come?
[2:15:16] Amen. All right.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:15:22] so get Christ in your heart. Amen.
[2:15:24] That's the real thing. And the Holy
[2:15:27] Spirit is that anointing. The Holy
[2:15:28] Spirit means Christ means the anointed
[2:15:30] one. And you're the one anointed. And
[2:15:32] it's Christ in you anointing you. See
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; to have the the one of the but see you
[2:15:38] to have one of the gifts outside the
[2:15:41] body. Now a person can have the gifts
[2:15:43] outside the body.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; Outside of the body of Christ. Do you
[2:15:46] realize that?
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; The gifts speaking in tongues, miracles,
[2:15:49] signs, wonders. All right. He said you
[2:15:51] can have those gifts outside the body.
[2:15:53] It would do you no good.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; People rely upon gifts. See, it would do
[2:15:57] you no good. Though I speak with tongue
[2:15:59] of men and angels, have not charity,
[2:16:00] which is God himself revealed in you, it
[2:16:02] profitth me nothing. Though I have faith
[2:16:04] and understand all the mysteries of God,
[2:16:06] profit me nothing. Though I give my body
[2:16:08] to be burned as a sacrifice, give all
[2:16:10] the goods, many people will do good
[2:16:12] things like that. Though I have faith to
[2:16:13] move mountains, I am nothing.
[2:16:16] All right? Don't depend on those things.
[2:16:19] The Holy Spirit is a being. It's God in
[2:16:22] you, the person God lit your whole
[2:16:24] entire being. You're changed. You're a
[2:16:27] new creature and a little thing that
[2:16:29] goes wrong, any little thing that goes
[2:16:31] wrong, he'll tell you that's wrong, then
[2:16:33] quit. Don't do it. Father, I didn't mean
[2:16:35] to do that. You forgive me. And that's
[2:16:37] the Holy Spirit.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; We all have errors. We all make
[2:16:40] mistakes. We all But it'll correct it.
[2:16:43] All right. Now, watch. You know
[2:16:45] yourself. It's an individual between you
[2:16:47] and God. You know it yourself. See,
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; you know you've been born again. You
[2:16:52] know it yourself. It's an individual
[2:16:54] thing between you and God. You know that
[2:16:57] something happened. You know that
[2:16:58] there's a change. Whether anything else,
[2:17:01] whether there's anything else, you
[2:17:03] yourself, you're the change.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, wait a minute. You're the change.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; You're the change.
[2:17:15] You're one. You're the one who's being
[2:17:17] changing is changing inside of you. You
[2:17:21] know you have it.
[2:17:24] Whether you spoke with tongues, I'm not
[2:17:25] against that. Now, don't get me wrong.
[2:17:26] Neither was Brother Brandham. Whether
[2:17:28] you spoke with tongues, whether you
[2:17:29] jump, shout, or anything else, you know
[2:17:31] that God lives in you. You know God
[2:17:33] lives in you that you don't walk with
[2:17:35] your own mind. It's the mind of Christ
[2:17:37] that leads you with that word just
[2:17:40] exactly the way it goes.
[2:17:43] When you're born again, now when you're
[2:17:46] reborn again, that's not the outside
[2:17:48] conscience. Spirit, body, that's not the
[2:17:52] outside conscience. The outside what you
[2:17:54] see, taste, feel, smell, hear, reason,
[2:17:56] memory, etc., etc. But the inside of
[2:17:59] that is what you really are. The inside
[2:18:02] of that,
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; that's what soul is what you really are.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:18:11] Now, this out here, Satan just tempts
[2:18:13] you, knocks you around every way here.
[2:18:15] But down in here, he can't do it unless
[2:18:17] you let him do it. Now, in here, you've
[2:18:20] got faith. Faith don't come from the
[2:18:22] outer conscience. It reasons. In faith,
[2:18:24] there's no reason. See, but in faith,
[2:18:26] there's no reason. That's what he says.
[2:18:28] You've got you've got it from God and
[2:18:30] you know it's there. I don't care how
[2:18:32] much looks wrong. You still know it's
[2:18:34] all right. It's thus sayeth the Lord and
[2:18:36] there's nothing going to bother that.
[2:18:38] Nothing can bother that. It's moving
[2:18:40] right on. Difficult means nothing to it.
[2:18:43] Wes right on through it. For it's the
[2:18:45] word and the word's the sword and the
[2:18:48] sword cuts.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; What's happened? The words, the sword
[2:18:51] cuts its way through.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; How? The word.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; If you abide in me and my word in you.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon made this statement with
[2:19:01] St. John 15:7. If you abide in me and my
[2:19:04] word in you, then he said, you know who
[2:19:06] you are.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Perfect faith. All right. Now, I'm going
[2:19:10] to say it by what God said in unveil
[2:19:14] prophet spoke message. God spoke through
[2:19:15] him in the unveiling of God. See, you're
[2:19:18] unveiling of God. All right. All he is,
[2:19:22] I am.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; He's raptured. What am I? All he is, I
[2:19:29] am. What he is, I am.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; And all I am, he is.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; I can quote you right back. Same same
[2:19:46] words, same What is it? She is him.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; She is him. Then if she is him, who is
[2:19:53] who is he? He is she.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; All right. Now it's no longer twain.
[2:20:01] They're one. All right. Now
[2:20:04] closing.
[2:20:06] I'm closing.
[2:20:10] Not a faith.
[2:20:13] This is coming to that third pull. This
[2:20:16] is in perfect faith. Paragraph 184. Not
[2:20:19] a faith, but a perfect faith.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; there's only one perfect faith. You know
[2:20:24] that?
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; That's God's own faith, and that's the
[2:20:27] believer.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; Not a faith, but a perfect faith built
[2:20:31] up in here. And watch a perfect God with
[2:20:35] a perfect heart keep a perfect promise
[2:20:38] by his perfect word, which is sharper
[2:20:41] than a two-edged sword, and a discerner
[2:20:44] of the thoughts of the heart.
[2:20:47] What? We're coming now to the perfection
[2:20:51] because coming coming now to the
[2:20:54] perfection. All right. Because the
[2:20:56] people has to come to this in order for
[2:20:59] the rapture.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; That's what's holding it away right now
[2:21:06] is waiting for that church to come into
[2:21:08] that perfect raptured faith.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; You see what's happening? You're growing
[2:21:14] into that.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:21:17] Wait till that last one comes into that
[2:21:19] perfect raptured faith.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; What's going to take place?
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; You're going to meet him.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; You're going to meet your loved ones.
[2:21:28] You're going to meet him in the air.
[2:21:30] You're going to the wedding supper.
[2:21:32] That's all there is to it. I'm not hope
[2:21:35] I going to make I'm going to the wedding
[2:21:37] supper.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; I'm marching out.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. That marches on.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; All right. Now that's what's holding it
[2:21:46] away. Waiting for that church come
[2:21:48] perfect raptured faith looking for it.
[2:21:50] It means a lot of shaving down for me.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; It means a lot for you and together
[2:21:58] we'll make it by the grace of God.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore,
[2:22:07] no, I'm not going to have you stand
[2:22:08] because that changes the atmosphere.
[2:22:10] This is my last statement.
[2:22:13] Therefore, the bride in the rapture will
[2:22:16] come forth.
[2:22:19] The bride in the rapture will come
[2:22:22] forth.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; And there is all pre there. It is all
