to fulfill hallelujah saints i just have to tell you this morning that uh i move so much because you see what brother jason has just sung led you in song this morning is a very inspiration that has led me to today's thought and i i'm just moved i just think how gracious the lord is and how beautiful the work that god does and and how he makes it so real to us it's not just chance you know i remember one time an individual making a comment he says i don't i don't know whether to believe brother paul that this is the holy ghost or whether these things just happen and i said well brother you're gonna have to narrow it a little narrower than that because you see if you think it just happened then you ought to go buy a lottery ticket amen god's in control god speaks amen the word is alive now it's kind of interesting i hope you understand when i say this statement here i promised brother ken that i would read this before i read it so uh anyway we're gonna just put it on the screen and uh let you read it for yourselves but brother ken and sister lona i just wanted to say thank you can we make it a smidge bigger brothers amen those of you getting older can just thank me for encouraging him to do that um you've been able to read it so you know i feel bad because um brother ken called me up and he says brother paul would there be any way the brothers the body of believers there could help us and of course you would have saw that on the church whatsapp and brothers let's show our love to them let's go do this and then i didn't show up but by god's grace the brothers were young and they're strong and i know brother ivan brother sergey i don't know who else brother chris anyway they they got all that loaded brother allen had tore something in his shoulder and his bicep and really wasn't the doctor didn't want him doing anything but uh brother ken was like if no one shows up he will load every drop of that by himself even if it hurts and so i just say thank you to to the brothers for doing this there's just a lot of things i don't feel at liberty to say but i believe this is just a very much a real token of love that they're speaking back to you it goes beyond helping load their vehicle um their possessions and so anyway we just say god speed to them and just pray that the lord would just bless them in pawnee oklahoma good church there brother wendell martin is just a good solid minister straight forward tell it like it is uh you know doesn't have to doctor it up he's just lays it out there and says here's the word of god now you take it and eat it and live it so we're very happy and and i'm happy for him in this sense too that uh of course brother allen and sister angie have been living there for quite a while calling out their home church and their daughter tabitha and her family brother mitch and all the kids are there and this is the beautiful part and just since about march of this year both of their sons have been baptized so god just dealing very very direct with them and and uh we just thank the lord for that and um you know just in in conversations sometimes we don't understand but i'll tell you this saints i just want you to i want you to focus on this if you or i have to go through a little pain for god to be able to do something for someone else then lord just give us the ability to bear the pain not to complain not to cry not to whine not to wonder but just say simply lord if my life needs to go through something that it might touch someone else then lord let me go through it amen um as i said here i think i said uh brother jay's song service we never discussed one drop of this but it very much very much moved me today and i just want to saints um just move forward and and that i want to speak today on the living word the inside display now the problem we have my brother and sister in the world we live in today is there's way too much christianity on the outside but yet on the inside people still have the same nature nothing changed they're not really uh desiring to change they just want to do that uh you know belong to something be identified with something and and that's well and good that's well and good to be identified with something but the real truth or strength of the gospel is that the inside is changed now we can come you know i've heard people make statements like well you know you've got to tell them not to do this or not to dress like this or act like this my brother and sister that's not really a minister's job a minister's job is to present the word of god and then when the hunger inside the heart of a man or woman a child uh whatever starts to to hunger and thirst after righteousness as the scripture says then when it's deep down within the heart and soul the outside just starts changing but we can enforce a form i guess we would just call it legalism upon people and say you know this is if you're going to believe or belong to our church you've got to look walk talk like this my brother and sister that won't work we have to get christ deep down embedded in the heart and soul and then all these other things you know i always love that little story that brother branham shares uh you know and to those i never knew brother bud southwick personally but i i i am friends with uh brothers that were very intimate or close uh friends with brother bud southwick and he has shared this testimony over many a meal and campfire with others and and you know they're up in the wilderness of british columbia and uh they're out there hunting and brother bud you know says you know this story brother bud says well i better go out and check the horses one last time and brother bud's out there at the end of the the string where the horses are all tied off uh the breeze blowing the odor away as it were and he lights up a cigarette there just to satisfy his nicotine craving and he hears brother branham's voice come from the tent and he doesn't say but southwick you're going to hell smoking those devil fire sticks he doesn't say i thought you said but just simple words brother bud when did you quit smoking you see the desire was in the heart but the craving of the flesh craved that oh my it must have been brother branham's words that changed brother bud's life right there no saints i'm actually sorry to tell you it was brother budd's words that changed brother budd's life right there he could have said i'm ashamed to say it brother branham but i still smoke i can't kick this habit oh brother branham i feel condemned branhamite what did he do he spoke those things that were not as though they were and he says just now he didn't say brother branham come in the tent and you pray for me he made his confession of what his heart's desire was and he says just now brother branham just now you see and god delivered him from that and brother bud never smoked another cigarette in his life and it was amazing because those who knew him well said he had spoke many times of i need to quit you know i know this isn't right but um you know he he couldn't so remember my brother and sister sometimes you know the word just comes in the right season and uh brother jay not to throw you under the bus but the bus is very close uh sister nadia brother sergey's mother yes not brother sergey's mother she is our sister nadia amen i'm trying to change the culture you identified her as sister sergey's mother she's our sister nadia i'm just i'm just rattling your chain here okay we want to we want when our sister uh when our sister shows up by god's grace here in the church we don't want to greet her with god bless you sister sergey's mother we want to be in the culture as it were of naming her amen so anyway i was just kidding jay and i i'm sorry i couldn't help myself but uh let's just stand and go to the word this morning i want to talk to you about the living word the inside displayed and this actually has much more to it but we will go this morning to here in the uh first john the first chapter verses one through five and um we'll look at this and uh my brother and sister to me the song service today just touched right on this because once we know who we are once we are identified clearly first john 1 1 that which was from the beginning which we have heard in which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness you see now my brother and sister i'm kind of going back a few services where i were talking about witnesses and these things so sorry a little bit random on this but you see we're moving from the time that we're going by someone else's witness come on i want you to think about that we've got to move away from the time we're going by someone else's witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us and us is a very inclusive identifiable group it is not an entirely random but it can be identified that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you so this my brother and sister i'm getting ahead of myself let me just read the scripture that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and his son jesus christ and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all amen now look at this happy is he heavenly father we thank you lord that you had just come lord ask you to move in our midst lord just feel like father just the way that you move sometimes the way you bring things about and lord you would give and you would take away as it were father we just asked lord for your leadership for your anointing today for the guiding hand of god in our lives lord you're you're just so precious to us and certainly lord there's things that we do that we make mistakes but lord you've already covered made a propitiation for our mistakes this morning i just lift my hands lord to you and say thank you lord for your grace and for your mercy lord knowing that this great plan of redemption this seventh seal that has been opened and father a great shout in heaven lord that all eternity would know that the plan of god is working it's coming to pass just exactly as it was said to be oh lord how the angels father they would worship and they would be happy and sing songs of praise but father they could not understand or relate to the experience lord that we have knowing of where you have brought us from and where you have promised to take us to guide us today lord open our hearts to your word lord not the words of man but to the word of god lord and i pray you just bless the people in your precious name amen you may be seated so i was sent a um little video that come from the men's meetings and sister kerry right full screen is your husband worshiping the lord hallelujah just a lovely lovely little video that was sent to us by brother barry coffey and uh the men's meetings just a lovely time so we just uh thank the lord you know while some of us would love to go and it's not possible amen it's part of the body and we're all one body so part of me went to those men's meeting and part of me are rejoicing uh in the blessings that they have declared amen so as we look this morning i want to just draw out of uh verse 2 right here it says it was manifested unto us and the definition of manifest is displayed or to be an evidence of so the uh life amen that was in the father amen that eternal life was displayed or uh uh made evident to us uh if if you follow what i'm saying here i need to get that anchored in your thoughts this morning because we're going to just use uh these various words of displayed and display and manifest manifested but you look at this and realize see my brother and sister that this was not something that was just uh spoken and then it was just put out with no display of this now you look at this in uh the first verse it says it was from the beginning i want you to think about that now what does the word say that it was before the foundation of the world so when it's speaking of the beginning it's not talking about just the beginning of a ministry or or a certain particular little time there but this was from the beginning and it's been the gospel through the ages my brother and sister we can see this through our bible the gospel through the ages is an unchanging gospel and we live in a world today that uh many times there's different translations sister jerry and i just visiting the other night about you know how people say well you know the king's game version of the bible is not accurate it has taken certain liberties but yet you would look my brother and sister and i'm not going to be down on any translation today that's not my point but you look in the world we live in today and the new living testimony version whatever it's written in the vernacular of our day the king james version was written in the vernacular of their day but the gist of it is my brother and sister it's still pointing to jesus christ and uh you know i know brothers that say well i i kind of uh prefer this uh you know new new uh what i can't get in my head here uh no it's a you know one where they kind of use modern words anyway you know what i'm talking about uh new living translation uh and uh you look at that and and you know i i read that i look at that sometimes i go online you know and i i compare the scriptures and you know the thing is my brother and sister it doesn't matter if it's out of a new translation or an old translation if you got the holy ghost it says the same thing to you so you know people want to write things in the vernacular of their day and and uh that is that is perfectly all right because you see it's it's a something that started at the beginning and if it's just about the translation of the bible you read my brother and sister then you will be caught up in whether it's new or old or this or that but you see from the beginning uh he's speaking here john is speaking it's that which we have heard amen and that is not the voice of a man speaking to you that's a problem too many people have they have to anchor it back to the man but this is a living word and it should be speaking to you and i and in our prayer life getting in the spirit we should be able to then translate transcend any kind of a distraction any kind of interference any kind of stuff because the word of god was meant my brother and sister to speak to this and i want to say today he's speaking and i want to ask you are you hearing amen so it also says and we have seen with our eyes now i'm going to jump ahead a little bit of my thought today my brother and sister you have to come to a place this is this is what is discouraging to people they come to a place that they look around them and they can't find in their life a example of a real christian that they can not hang on to them right they won't save you but we as humans need someone you might say in our support group or we can look out and say this brother this sister is a real christian i see christ in them if we look around in the world we live in today as christians and we can find no one that we see as displaying the life of christ what is going to be our reaction we are going to be discouraged and we are going to give up that's just a it's just a fact my brother and sister so you see we have seen the word of god but i believe now i'm not trying to interpret the word today don't don't misunderstand me but you see we have to see christ present in the world we live in we cannot live in a world that's merely of somatics it's just merely of words it's merely of of this or that the bible on tape or you know or this and we can't live in that world my brother sister we need to see a real absolute physical manifestation of the word of god in someone's life can some would say amen to that amen and we have looked upon see this is not that we have just set back and and just simply have heard but we have looked upon this and the thing that really strikes my heart and our hands have handled of the word of life you see god's got to be a real tangible god to us see god never intended and we'll touch upon that in just a few minutes but you see god never intended right here according to john 1 1 this is god and we've handled it we've read it we've heard it but you see god intended for it to be deeper than that because then we could go as a hermit in the woods in our den room shut the world out read this and have an answer for everything but it doesn't work that way we as humanity need to see christ moving in those around us we need to see christ moving as parents in laodicea we need to see christ moving in our children otherwise we look out and see what the world is and we start to become discouraged thinking lord is that where our children will end up you have to see christ moving in your children's life and children need to see christ moving in their parents life because we can sit around the living room or around the table and we can talk about why we need to serve god but if our kids never see god you have a hard sale because what the world calls joy and fun and happiness my brother and sister there's actually a very tangible evidence of that in the world because these people are just jokesters and they're laughing and they're doing all the time but the devil's a great master of deception you know the military has mastered what they call cloaking and uh you know when you think about uh little things just to give you an idea my brother and sister so things like night vision was actually developed uh a way between the gap of world war ii and korea they they developed night vision but it never came into the real public realm until many many years later and so i just do that there's many things today uh that that in that realm and i hope you're following me and so now they have developed cloaking it's actually been around for a little bit and they can project a picture and someone could be here doing something and they have project a hologram for you and what you would see would be an empty pulpit a screen and a wall but someone could actually be here and they have developed this and then is such a way that that's that that is happening behind the scene can take place and you don't know any different and that's what the devil's doing in the world today he's trying to just cloak what his what did and he shows this joy he shows his happiness he shows all of these things but he doesn't show what's going on behind the scene but you know what he actually stole that from god because sometimes oh my brother and sister you know remember i've said before that sometimes we come to church we need to let our face know that our heart is happy because what is going on behind the scene is a joy in her heart but you're tired you're this you're that uh you know you've stubbed your toe and and you do that and sometimes brother paul chide you and sister and i didn't say sit jeremy did i oh my i did i'll just go ahead and finish now that i put her sister emmy's like brother paul we are happy and i had to say that in humor sister emmy you know sometimes we just need to let her face know it so what god is doing he's working on the inside now my brother and sister we can smile and laugh and be full of joy and sing to the top of our lungs and go to hell so we got to have something on the inside it's not about the outside amen reminds me of a little story took place memphis tennessee these people had some young children some young boys and uh this uh this colored man was just a couple houses down on the other side the street and every sunday morning when they got up and looked out their front window this big black cadillac is in the driveway and he's out there polishing it and one day this little boy he just couldn't help himself he goes out and uh the neighbor was a very nice gentleman he goes over there and he says sir and he says yes he said i see you polishing this car all the time how come you never drive it and the man went around to the front and popped the hood and raised it up and there was no engine he said i have this car because i enjoy polishing it now my brother and sister we can polish the outside but if there's no life to move us then all we're doing is polishing we're just making ourselves maybe look good right we always wear the right clothes always have the right right this right that but you see god's coming to move in such a fashion that he's putting power into the church amen so we could say right here that we have seen from the beginning we've heard we've looked upon we've handled and we could place this as it were entirely upon the bible but the word of god is not that just we would read our bible it is a necessary ingredient and we should be but you see it has to be a much deeper experience it has to be that we would let the god of the bible out now you look at this and my brother and sister sometimes you know where i stand i believe in this believe this message believe god sent a prophet entirely but i also am a person who looks in a very broad spectrum and you look in the world and there is some men that have given a very very profound explanation uh or or uh oratory of of uh uh letting the god of the bible out and um uh you know it's there that you look at that you see god of history and uh i just remember a man many years ago he was preaching on the journey that's what he called it and he's talking about the journey and he says you know uh it's just like my family uh trying to get out of town on a vacation and that was um that was israel getting out of goshen you know they just um a pretty funny guy you know he says they're just there and it's like praise the lord pharaoh gave us liberty to get out of here and they're over there not even really looking and everything that come to their hand they're throwing it in the wagon because well we got to go i mean we've got to go here or go there you know and uh you know you guys have done this on vacation you know you're about 500 miles from home almost ready to stop for the night and it's like we didn't bring any toothbrushes i forgot my shoes where's the camera it's not what god wants for this journey my brother and sister he wants you to actually be very methodical is it that i need to make a rapture now you look at it my brother and sister it's in that realm that we're not just here to get out of town i think and i've said this before i'll say it again too many people are are crying out for a rapture because they want to get out of the life that they're in they want to get out of their situation they want to get out of the the doldrums as it were so oh lord deliver us my brother and sister it shouldn't be while what he is delivering you from even though that is important it should be you with great anticipation of what god is taking you to amen we're not just getting out of this corrupt earth we are getting into the presence of jesus christ but yet we can do that my brother and sister uh without as it were taking place in the rapture so you see we got to let the god of the bible out we've got to let him become real now verse 2 says life was manifested and we have seen it i hope someone can lift a hand today and say the life has been manifested and i have seen the life of christ amen and we then can bear witness you see if we have never seen it my brother and sister we can talk of what is on the written page and that is good confess what is in the bible until you see it come to pass but it's really awesome when you have experienced what you are talking about amen and so as we'll look at this and it shows unto you that eternal life we can talk about eternal life we can talk about the future we can talk about standing before the sea of crystal before the throne of god and talk about how we'll have a conversation for 10 000 years and we're doing all of this but my brother and sister we got to move that from a realm of just something that's in our mind and it's got to come into it and god actually look at the word and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father was what was it my brother and sister come on what was it displayed not just talked about not just something that's theoretical but it was put on display to you and i that we are no longer talking in a theoretical way but we're talking in a reality of what we have experienced and can speak from the depths of our heart reminds me of a brother one time pardon me putting it this way but it reminds me of a brother one time talking about what it was like to be in a car wreck i couldn't relate to that i couldn't relate those of you from alaska would know brother wild bill and how he smashed in the car and how that his throat and neck were crushed and he pulled the knife out and gave himself a tracheonomy how many of you can relate impossible right to have someone tell you what it was like to say i'm dying anyway i might as well see if i can do this and taking a knife and piercing a hole and boring it in his throat there so he could breathe you see we can't relate to brother bill regardless of how many times and how many ways it was explained to us we cannot relate to that and that is the problem my brother and sister when we get to the place we're looking at the word of god as it is historical when we're looking at the word of god as it is this historical god historical things have happened oh praise god god is real and we love him he died on the cross for us but how about you make that a living word today and what happened on the cross is living to you this morning not something that you look back to but it is right here right now amen so you know it comes a time and a place uh we could place it on the bible it needs to be deeper than that let the god of the bible out amen so you look at this you see it was manifested in us god has put it on display now i'd have to say i don't matter what church you go to and what you believe god will be on display to you if you're searching for him if you're not searching for him you won't find him he won't be on display but if you're searching for him the word of god says those who draw nigh unto me i'll draw nigh unto them you see we have to put that effort i want god close i don't i don't want a god that's out somewhere in the atmosphere as it were my brother and sister i want to god this close now look the life was manifested unto us and look at the positive context amen that it was manifested it was seen and it bear witness and we'll show a witness we will show a witness of it how would you like to be a witness today amen you know been called into court before for certain circumstances subpoenaed and you go in there you know and and um you know what you've seen or what you did you just think this is not even important why am i here but you see what is being done in the court is they are giving a witness after a witness after a witness and each one of those becomes a little part of the picture and when the picture becomes redundant that you literally have dozens i i'm gonna put this thinking of the body of christ it goes from dozens to hundreds to thousands to ten thousands to hundreds of thousands and you can get on an airplane and you can travel the world my brother and sister and you can get off a plane and find real christians and they will talk to you of the delivering power of almighty god they will talk to you about healing power they will talk to you about deliverance they will talk to you about provision and it's the same everywhere you go you don't go to africa and they are there telling you well god doesn't answer prayer god doesn't heal people god doesn't this god doesn't that that's the unbeliever there everywhere but you find a real believer and you will find the witness or manifestation of the word to real christians is exactly the same the world over oh let me just shock some of you not every one of those that i declare as a real believer is going to necessarily confess the message like you confess it there are godly people out there my brother and sister old world baptist you would think they were message believers they dress right they live right oh some of you won't like that right but the fact is the prophet of god even spoke about they'll come out of these other churches they're not just all confined my brother and sister you got to understand the place that god called them from and the position that god put them in now some people don't like that and i if i offend you i am very sorry but the truth of it is god is bigger than our thinking amen and so what it is eternal life that was with the father has been put on display to you and us it is on display to you and us today my brother and sister oh well i didn't see it well i'm sorry it's on display what you see or you don't see will not determine the outcome of the whole promise of god it is to those who are seeking him now if eternal life is on display and it's been displayed to us would it not be our ministry to put it on display once again would it not be you and i's job right he said i'll be with you even in you to the end of the earth so it is our job once again to put the word of god amen the manifestation of who christ is it is now our job to put it on display right you know the little song the kids sing hide it under a bushel no i'm gonna let it shine now this is something brother brother jay and i mentioned it to him we really didn't discuss it this morning but i just mentioned it to him you see we're call brother jay works uh you know with this company and they have a couple different facilities and in that i'm not touting brother jay but in that you see he's felt led of god to speak words to young men young men that are troubled young men that have are alcoholics and have other issues and marriage issues and you see he's then become a witness in that environment you know i've never been inside the door of those buildings and not too many of you would maybe sister emmy and and uh sean and heidi but you see i won't penetrate that door i won't walk in that door i won't work with that young man i won't never know him well enough for him to talk about how his marriage is falling apart and he's become an alcoholic but you see there is one who was called and placed into that position to minister on that day not random my brother and sister god's got a calendar he keeps it amen and so there's a ministry now you can put that everyone has their circle they work in they fellowship in and and the the clerk you know i i just remember i don't ever shop anymore but but you know i remember years ago when when jerry and i was first married living out you know west of caldwell out there and there was one lady in albertson's and if she was on on duty uh we went to her even if we had to stand in line and wait because she was just this nice lady and she was the kind of lady that would go oh oh oh there's a coupon for that so you know we were back living those days i know i know some of you have been there where you know at the end of the end of the month the paycheck just wasn't quite long enough maybe we felt blessed back in them days if we had 25 left over so when the clerk says you can save three dollars on this right here with a coupon you were like thank you wanted to go around the backside and give her a hug amen well she she knew my mama that was part of the story so she wouldn't cared if i had give her a hug but you see eternal life was on display and it was displayed to you and i and now it's our ministry hallelujah who wants a ministry every one of us ought to be lifting the hands saying i want a ministry i want to minister of this supernatural life of jesus christ now look this is what produced hebrews 11. you read your bible go through hebrews 11 and look at this it was by faith but my brother and sister what built faith an abstract god an invisible god a god who never answered a prayer a god who never spoke to his people no sir my brother and sister what produced hebrews 11 was a god that was so real to these people that they would walk through the fire they would go to the lion's den they would do whatever it is that god ordained for them and set in order because they had no fear because they knew they were part of god's ministry and they knew that whatever the word said god would back it up we ought to have that kind of courage today saints now you got to understand this is not like i'm going to stand up here and boast boy if i was ever thrown in a lion's den i tell you what i would do no that's not what it's about if the lions eat me it's the will of god and if the lions lay down in the corner it's the will of god if they take me to a fiery furnace and i go up in flames it is the will of god if i walk out untouched without even the smell it is the will of god you see we have to have that submission before we really truly will have the faith when we face it to stand upon it and when we have submitted to the word of god go study the message how many times that brother brown speaks on those things they're literally in the hundreds my brother and sister but you see each one of those if you was there facing what they did in hebrews 11 you would say man life is hard we can read it today and say oh they subdued lions and they did this and they did this and by faith that's wonderful we have faith but my brother and sister they were rugged christians and i want to encourage you today that in you is the same faith that god placed in them and when god brings you to the time and the place he will ignite that faith in you and as it were a new book amen you could be written in there because you'll stand on that i'm telling you my brother and sister were coming into a time we're coming into a world uh just reading a little a little deal and they're talking about cities like chicago and milwaukee and and different places like that uh baltimore new york city the violence has escalated that people literally uh reading this this lady says i used to take my children for a walk in the evenings and now we make sure we're inside our house with the doors locked when the sun goes down we're afraid to go outside in our own yard now my brother and sister this is prophecy coming to pass we are seeing not just because of the violence but it's of the nature of the spirit that is there and we're seeing that but it is in this season god called for you and i to put him on display now you know brother branham put god on trial right and uh you know some people just get all critical you know i i've heard comments before about that was arrogant for him to preach that but my brother and sister do you realize every time you come face to face with something in your life you put god on trial every time you come face to face with you might call an emergency or a situation in your life you put god on trial because you're either believing what he spoke or you're not and when you don't believe you're telling him you believe he did not tell the truth and so there it is every single day of your life you put god on trial amen so that's what we see my brother and sister uh of how this we are called to display christ not fear you realize my brother and sister now this is just kind of rhetoric in a sense now forgive me but you realize what is happening in the land that we're living in right now there is such a spirit of fear has crept in our nation now if it was something else it would reach the headlines but people are being bullied shoved down knocked down assaulted in grocery stores and walmart and whatever you might have got that in walmart anyhow but anyway that why because they're not wearing a mask you see the spirit of the ages setting the store that i'm against you and you're against me and everyone's against everyone and that is the spirit of the day satan's been trying to do that in the church of almighty god for thousands of thousands of years and he's not going to accomplish that because true believers will always come back to the word and the word unites the word has a uniting quality right amen so i want to just hurry and move on now in first john the third chapter amen uh behold what manner of love the father hath amen if you'll change that brother ivan what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not now i want you to just look at this what manner of love it's almost in a sense a question what manner of love not not superficial not just a a slight dose as it were but a great outpouring that he'd bestowed and when something is bestowed upon you it's as a present an honor a gift amen so this is not earned by good works it's not something but good works accomplishes it you have never seen a true holy ghost-filled christian that did not have good works accompanying his life if we say we have the holy ghost and we are snide and petty you know a common term they use in the day we live in now your snark and say you got the holy ghost you're combative you're judgmental my brother and sister come on the rubber to the road okay is that okay you can't you can't be of those behaviors and say i have the holy ghost you can't have a buzz saw temper and say i have the holy ghost you can't have a loose liberal life and say i have the holy ghost because it does not fit the nature of god and so if it does not fit the nature of god it didn't come from god but he says behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god what a gift that we can come and accept he has spoken and said you are my sons you're my daughters you see that that is so beautiful james 1 17 says that every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of light with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning you know we live in a day my brother and sister right the scripture says that a double-minded man is unstable or double-minded in all of his works so you can't be just double-minded over here and not be double-minded over there you you got to make up your mind you know what what it is you're going to do and be what it is and so this good gift that god has given this perfect gift that god has given to us uh to be able to be called sons and daughters of god this is actually a gift that came down from heaven people say well you know i haven't really seen god do anything in my life but look you've been given this gift my brother and sister and it come down from the father there's no variableness look in our nation look at our nation saints we're headed so many different directions we don't know what direction we're headed kick them out do you realize i want you to catch the irony of this i'm not going into the political thing of it but the irony of it at the process right now they're letting people across the border by by thousands a day at the same time homeland security is burning millions of dollars deporting people so is this an exchange program you see the double-mindedness of this and it comes that we're going to protect religious freedom until we don't and i could cite you many court cases right now where they have not protected religious freedom at all in others the government goes overboard to protect it you realize down in california there's a satanist group that the neighbors started complaining about their behavior and actions and what was going on there and the courts have ruled that because that house is their temple that they are allowed to worship there while throwing chain link fences around houses of god across the nation and saying you defied our coveted rules well i'm sure the devil made all the covet rules because that's the devil he's into obeying the rules you see here jumping back to our scripture first john 3 beloved we are now the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be what will we be when we get on the other side who will we look like what will it be will we be the same person or will we be like a more perfect version of me the lord says you don't you don't know now we are sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is you can tie this directly back john 1 he's the word and the word in you my brother and sister is not a different version of the word this has to be the very version that is god himself almighty jehovah shaddai and when the word meets the word my brother and sister there won't be a discrepancy so don't worry about what your name will be people get all caught up oh you know the vision brother branham said a new name and what's that going to be and people went all into deals and i remember i was a young man at this time when this swept through the message and people were down at the courthouse changing their names well my name was fred but now it's daniel and my name was this but now it's solomon my name was this but it's now israel well i'm sorry my brother and sister changing your name in the natural if you have a name that means rat or something like that i can understand changing your name but you see this is not what it's about because you see we're being identified and what we are becoming not what we're becoming what we are is the word we are the word made manifest in the day that we are living and so what we are as the prophet of god talked about us being many messiahs and it's funny because you go study that out and people are like oh these people believe that cultist stuff not even talking about the message that cultist stuff they believe that they're sons of god they believe that they're many messiahs well they ought to read their bible with a little revelation and realize that we are being molded in the very image of god and if we are in the very image of god my brother and sister we will be what god is and so we will be what it is and so while we are here in the flesh not knowing really what we are sometimes oh am i am i you know am i christian even some days you feel that way you know and i don't know but we know that when he shall appear we shall be just like him because the word that is in you is the word that is him it can't be a different word hallelujah no variableness of turning in our lord jesus christ for we shall see him as he is and when you recognize the word here today when you are here in this life recognizing the word of god and saying amen to it you will recognize jesus christ when you see him amen there were those we could go back and draw this out through through the old testament uh bringing it right into the new testament my brother and sister when these people came in the presence of almighty god they were those that when they came in his presence they knew who they were dealing with and we sometimes speak on the woman at the well and we just like yeah we know that story we know that story but my brother and sister do you recognize the revelation that come to that young lady because as he starts to speak to her now you can look at that and at first it seems as he's kind of downing her you know that i'm not supposed to serve you we're supposed to be separate get the water anyway as he starts to speak to her her mind oh come on let's catch this sometimes we think that well she was a young woman so we're just using one young woman sometimes we think oh this young woman went out she's had all these men in her life oh that is so horrible that's so horrible do you know she knew the word when he started to speak to her she said that is a sign of the messiah that is what will be spoken that is what will be done when the messiah comes she wasn't ignorant she wasn't some trash-hopping bum that was a drop out or whatever it is she had been raised in an environment that she knew the word but circumstances of her life but look how god come right down and said nope she always was my daughter and he comes right down and he speaks to her and she goes into the city and when she goes in the city she starts telling them oh come and see the man who told me all i've ever done and they didn't go out in the street and throw pumpkins and tomatoes at her and say oh you lying no good piece of trash they saw something that quick immediate change in her eye a presence she was speaking of something and they might have said well you know that was sister so's daughter she was raised in church didn't keep her from going out there but god didn't let her go hold her right back amen hallelujah you see so it is we shall see him as he is the word and every man my brother and sister that ever knows the word will recognize jesus christ brother brown speaks about this but we don't even have to go into the message to see that it's all through the bible pointing pointing pointing to these things to recognize that when you are able to let's say amen to the word of god and instead of contesting or fighting or pushing against it or trying to interpret it just to stop and say lord i surrender now please lead me to all truth you made a promise i want all truth amen hallelujah how many of you are selfish when it comes to that i want all truth i don't want a portion of truth i don't want just something out here i want the pure unadulterated word of god i don't need to look at some great man on the earth today i don't need to elevate somebody and say oh if they said it and that it's got to be right i tell you i've got something that has been elevated in my presence and i can take the things of this life i can take men's words i can take dictums from governments and whatever and i've got a filter to run it through and that filter speaks to me and says that is the truth or that is a lie amen almost every bit of lies have a majority of truth hallelujah amen i've got a text hey paul you paid your att bill for august open this site for a reward and i don't know how long we've had cell phones well i'm just going to say 25 years at t has never said thank you for paying them so somebody's a little scammed that they have sent me if i push on that thing and whatever would happen after that my brother and sister they told the truth we paid our bill in august see most of it was a lie what they didn't tell you is what they're going to do to you afterwards hallelujah look if we're going to recognize christ we've got to be in the pure word of god we can't have something that's confused or whatever now look here let's go uh and to move forward brothers to uh when their eyes were open i've had this book in my chopper and as sometimes trucks don't come back promptly i've been reading this and it really really uh spoke to my heart and i hope it does to yours wouldn't you like to took a trip with cleopas and them on the road to emmaus can we take a poll who would like to have been there i would like to have been there i would have liked to that was a supernatural event that took place jesus christ walking right in their midst and they didn't even recognize him this goes to show you that see when when your eyes are veiled even though you're a believer you're going to walk right with the presence of god you don't see it god help us revelation i want to know him i want to recognize him when i see him i'd like to walk with them and it's possible i'm glad to be living today that i can still do the same thing walk with him today just the same as they did the thought of it was how that jesus had raised up from the dead but the sad part of it was that some of them who loved him didn't know it and there's a certainly not certainly a picture of today there is many people who love him who doesn't yet realize that he is alive there is some kind of a history that they have learned in some school it's some book of theology some ethics some code of ethics that they studied somewhere and jesus is a historical figure to them now that just seems like almost impossible right without going any further detail i'll just tell you saints within the last couple years i've experienced individuals making statements that lined perfectly with this now let me make a point here i'm not pointing to myself but i want to make this point that is a witness to me that this statement is correct somebody say i've never heard anybody say that well trust me if you will don't if you don't but i can stand as a witness before man and god that people are still anointed with these same spirits they're still caught under that same influence some kind of a history that they have learned in some school some book of theology some ethics code of ethics that they studied somewhere and jesus christ is this historical figure to them and yet in the history they love him and don't realize that he is alive with us walking right around with us just as he always did he is here just the same as he ever was now you look at this my brother and sister if he's walking with us i don't think any of us had too hard wrapping our mind around going down the road to emmaus and the fact that it was jesus christ walking with him we look at that we look back in this historicalness of the bible and realize this took place these two men they were not unbelievers just coming to the gospel they were believers who were confused at the very things that had already been prophesied and preached to them they thought they understood what jesus meant but they didn't really right and jesus says um okay oh foolish and slow of heart that would have flaked off a whole bunch of people right there they went this guy called me a fool and i'm not a fool and i'm not slow of heart i'm out of here but you see there was something in there that was attracting them to the word they didn't even recognize that the word was walking in their midst but the word was being spoken to them and they were not attracted this is a problem we have in the day that we live in there is a messenger that comes and he speaks the word and the people are attracted to the messenger and miss the fact that it's god that's speaking amen so it's got to be that we are there and they were attracted to the word you see at that point in that story there's nothing about who the man was his description what defined him the cloak he was wearing you know his hair his looks none of that stuff it was the word and we can verify that that it was the breaking of the bread the word that opened their eyes are you with me amen hallelujah yet in history they love him didn't realize he is alive with us walking right around with us hallelujah you know i did something stupid yesterday and hurt myself god was right there with me why did god allow that to happen wouldn't he have kept me from my own stupidity no sorry i just love free moral agency i'm in the house of god today because i wanted to be here amen i worship the lord i sing praises to the lord because i want to there is no dictum that says you will do this and you will do this and will oh there is man wrote it though god didn't god says you know what satan do anything you want to and just don't take his life you realize the hedge that's been opened up around you god could give you all kinds of stuff you say well hallelujah i have this problem well i'm sorry you know if you drink 500 gallons of soda pop it'll do that to you amen you know you you do this here you leap off of tall buildings you know and it hurts then uh you know that that's what happens but god was with him now look my brother and sister when we start to behave i don't think there'd be anybody in this building this morning or that might listen to this service would say oh i believe in a historical god then why do we act like he's a historical god you see with our lips we would confess one thing oh no no he's here ever present oh can i can i just vent for a moment somebody raise their hand and say paul you can vent why saints do we go out in the foyer or out in the parking lot and we go oh yeah i've got this deal right here in this disaster right there and this thing here and the doctor says this come on i hope this smarts a little bit i want it to be do you know there's not a single prayer request concerning those things you say well it's personal well you just shared it with the whole church because you know if this one told that one that one told that one that one told me it's not necessarily gossip might be close but you see saints look i hope you understand my point we we're we're talking about it as though yeah when we go through this i'll have physical therapy i'll have this i'll have that i go the doctor put me on this pill all the and we're acting like god's no longer a healer we're acting like god's not really interested in what's happening in our little things in our life so therefore we put it as though this is historical god he'll get to it when he gets to it i'm sorry saints there are some things i got a prayer request in today pretty vague isn't it remember what brother chris preached about them unspoken prayer requests but i think some of you don't want me to really tell you what's that prayer request my brother and sister i expect god to answer those i am not speaking in vagueness because i just don't do it's because it doesn't pertain to me these these unspoken and these burdens on my heart they're not me my wife my children my brother and sister they're things that i see as a pastor that my heart is aching to see something change and i want it to be before you as a body that you would be faithful and say you know what brother paul's got something that's bothering him and if it's important enough for him to share it with the church it's important enough for me to pray about it why because i believe in the power of prayer of the saints amen no we don't put these out here just as something oh i put in a prayer request praise the lord i expect results right i'm expecting god to come on this scene and touch some of you things that i see that's happening in your lives and i don't believe it's good my brother and sister and i want god to come on the scene and do that do we need to humiliate everybody and like oh i think uh brother so-and-so and sister so and so and then and you're not doing this and you're not doing no my brother and sister i want to give god the liberty and i believe in the power of prayer that god will change that because the last thing on earth i would do maybe i would need to be checked even to bring up what i said sister emmy i said that in humor in case some of you missed my warped humor we're not here to humiliate you know what i like nothing better saints then we get on the other side to look up god bless you oh right i can't believe people might say oh i can't believe we made it brother paul it'll be brother paul going i can't believe i made it but i believe i was called and i'm going to do my very best to live it amen because i believe it amen it's not a story to me it's not historical see so in history they love him but they don't realize he's alive with us right here now look my brother and sister let me put it this way just a little little um oh my mind won't wrap around what it is here just a little paradox i encounter people that definitely without a doubt view god in a historical fashion but the god who is the ever-present help in the time of trouble cannot be a historical god he's got to be a god who is present right here right now that's right you know when i was about 17 i might have been 18 at the time backslid still went to church kind of because i lived in my parents home that was something i respected but without a doubt backslid you know we were driving the highway's totally different you wouldn't wouldn't recognize it for what it is now but when you go south on 95 to go into oregon and nevada that road used to have some twists and winds and uh winding parts and a man ran off the road and got out of his car ran out in the road in front he was afraid we was going to hit his car i ran out in front of my brother and i my brother was driving we spun down the highway the pickup went over the bank and all i remember is god help me 240 feet in an angle like that into the bottom of a ravine in a rock this big wedged in the wheel of a pickup and stopped it sure glad that wasn't a historical god i'm sure glad it was a god that was present right with me even in that condition amen at that time you know they come along in the state snowplow says i it's against the law for me to hook onto your vehicle my brother said well sir i guess you'll either hook on it or we'll retrieve it out of the bottom of that ravine and the man goes well i sure hate to see your pickup do that and he literally looked around at a couple witnesses there and the first guy goes i didn't see nothing i didn't hear nothing other guy said me either the guy turned his truck around hooked a cable on it pulled the pickup up and i watched the rock saints see this is real i get to testify this i get to share this from my heart as a real witness just a rock that was no bigger than that and the minute one ounce of pressure was pulled against that pickup that rock rolled out from underneath that tire and fell into the canyon this is not a rock that was anchored deep in the mountain unmovable now you tell me on a slope like that how a rock that big on the surface would stop a pickup that went off the edge i knew at that time i knew at that time that god would hear my prayers and i wasn't even serving it took me a few more years my almost 20 more to give my heart to the lord but you see i can stand here today and testify to you young people to brothers and sisters god's an ever present god in the time of your trouble he didn't have to stop and say well now let me get back to him we'd have been piled up in the baltimore canyon right there just deader than dead unless a miracle that took place you see i believe this word that i preached to you saints amen now look going on in here let's go on in here where am i sorry oh my we got to wrap this up somebody press the turbo button amen and the reason they didn't believe it is because the resurrection was too unusual see there was they hadn't happened before it was unusual thing for them to believe something like that and the unusualness is where god lays see christ's birth was unusual a virgin shall confuse uh conceive god is always unusual he does unusual thing but it's always according to his word he never does anything outside of his words so unusual because he promises at first then he sends somebody to manifest that word to make it real to people now i want you to look at this my brother and sister i don't care who you are here this morning because i actually don't know what all of you believe or what the innermost thoughts are that's between you and the lord it's not for me to pry into but if you can't take what you believe and run it right back through this bible and confirm every line of it you need to stop and examine where you're at with your life amen because here is a very word of god and we don't have to say oh that's so because brother branham said in a quote we can take you to ample scripture right i am god and i change not amen there's just all kinds of scriptures we won't go there but all kinds of scriptures that god is immovable amen he doesn't have something today and something new tomorrow that's one of the things i personally have against the religious world we live in they keep morphing we've got to loosen the standard to attract the young people we've got to do this to get the family we've got to have a fun night for this and we've got to do this for that and my brother and sister what is the whole what is the real word of god what matters to a son or daughter of god not what feels good not what looks good not what sounds good although the true word will bring that reaction to every one of us but we can't go for that feeling but it's always according to his word he never does nothing outside of his word and so unusual because he promises it first then sends someone to manifest that word to make it real to people now let's look we can go down through the bible and we can see god sends prophets right to make the word known to the people amen is that word only for the prophet to manifest come on i want you to think about this if it was only for the prophet to manifest wouldn't god just give it to the prophet and it go no further why through the ages let's just not look in the day that we live and don't go back into 20th century coming forward to now and say oh this is different no my brother and sister god works by patterns and so god has never just given the word for the prophets to the prophets to go over here and they got their great big old brunswick safe and they open that thing with the combo and open it up and take the revealed word and stick it in there and say that was for me no what do they do they expend their lives are you with me they expend their lives they go through great oh you say well brother paul i don't know how that is look you just study it and i'll tell you what if you've ever ministered you've ever been in conventions you've ever been places where the devil is working right there and you can see it happening and you say that's not a labor no i tell you what i have said in back rooms when i preached in south america and knowing what i was going to face and was afraid but before i walk out the door to come to a platform say lord we're here for a purpose this purpose is not to lift some man up this is a purpose to defeat the devil and deliver god's people and see saints oh help me lord see people delivered of demons right there in front of you amen oh hallelujah i can't even express it to you because god is a on time god he's a god that's ever present amen it's not about the preacher amen so god didn't give that just a gift to a prophet for it to be a prophet to manifest but you study the first fruits if you have a revelation of the word and the first fruits you'll see my brother and sister whatever it was that came to the prophet was meant to pass as it were right the prophet's life had to line up with it but it was meant to be passed through that amen and what did it do it come right down that that word come to a people in a day and it was delivered to them i don't like the word explained now preachers often times explain things right but i don't really like the thing word explain because you see we can explain something and people catch a grasp of it but never have a revelation of it now they could explain to you oh i see it in scripture seven church ages but you see that's much deeper much much much much deeper amen now look at this can i have just a few more minutes would be okay now you're going to think that i've went off the edge here but he sends prophets to make it known to the people right is that what god said brother branham make it known to us look once again i want to say this do you realize if brother brown was a prophet like people look at prophets you would never know that he told his wife tell them i'm not here because we just don't go out and share our failures but you see what god required out of a prophet was transparency and what does god require out of his people transparency god doesn't want a people that hide their sin he said everything that was done in secret will be made known god wants transparency my brother and sister so what was this it passed through a prophet amen it was preached but it was here the word is for you and i to manifest that was the ultimate goal what if the message of the hour let me put it this way what if the message of the hour come and god speaks to a prophet and the prophet catches that revelation and he preaches that revelation and it does not produce one thing it doesn't manifest one thing think about that there'd be no reason to do it this word is for you and i to manifest are the prophets words good enough for us are they good enough for me i'll put it that way now look you're going to think i've just derailed it but you know have you ever seen the hamburger ads i'm thinking of wendy's you're looking at me like i know it's time to eat you ever watched a wendy's ad you ever seen a wendy's billboard a double meat cheddar cheese baconator and the hamburger is lined up perfect and the corners of the cheese are melted just enough they're all draped over the edge and you see the glimpse on all four corners of some tomato lettuce is there just right oh i can see the edge of a pickle oh it looks so good do you know what your double meat cheese baconator looks like when they actually give it to you that thing looks like it has went through a tornado and then been in a car wreck right afterwards and you know the reason why it's that way is because now i'm not picking on young people but that little high school or college kid has just looked at 3624 hamburgers today and it's just another hamburger and they will eat it i've watched in there in the evening and they're there zombies and i opened up my hamburger and the tomato was this big the pickle had to been the tip and the piece of cheese must have been the leftover of the deal because the patty's this big and the cheese is that big but they know you'll eat it what if that would be the gospel we're going to just throw something together you know i'm sitting up here thinking these people probably think i'm nuts they're probably like oh i want to shut up i want to get over i'm going to go home i've got plans i have something in my heart i have to my brother and sister this word is not just something i'll we've preached look we're on what part the redemptions manifestation part 55 55 sundays i spoke about the redemption being manifested god didn't take his word and just start throwing this together and say just throw it out there they'll eat it god wants it put together if god worked at wendy's my brother and sister every sandwich would be just as perfect as perfect could be because he doesn't want a subpar throw together word for the hour he wants a word that the people can look at this and say i can count on this i can give my life i can hang as it were over hell on this word knowing that it's perfect amen you see a perfect word from the throne of god and it's not just for a prophet to manifest it it was a word that was sent down so that we could come let us not church let us not fall back to the human element i know what the truth is i've heard the word preached for years but i have this person done this and this happened and that happened and therefore no go back to the perfect word what does the perfect word say it's not about that church and that church and this ministry and that person it's about the word don't settle for something just toss together go back and get the original but what we do is we fall back to a human element we fall back to a human element we have reasons why we don't do what we need to do would it be too brutal too rude too abrupt to say we have so much iniquity in our lives saints they must grieve god because the prophet of god said iniquity is knowing to do and not doing it oh god purge every bit of iniquity from us purge us lord from everything that would resemble iniquity you see this word come down my brother and sister and it come down in this day it was brought in every effort that was placed upon it and every effort that will continue to be was for you and i it was not to stop somewhere along and like a carrot being dangled but this is the word it's at our fingertips it's in our hearts we have every form of it amen and you are called to make it manifest to the people you minister to you see you minister to people i don't even know so you can't just leave it to some preacher in church you minister at the grocery store the gas station at the corner mart you minister to the neighbor you minister it to some of your relatives you do this you're the one that's called the minister this you can't say well we'll just leave all the ministry to the ministry no sir you are the ministry you are the one that god has called he manifested this to you everything that i have read to you that it was manifested in your sight you've seen it he has become a regular once twice ultimately three to four times a month couple sundays couple wednesday nights preaching to them and he's praying and the lord says pull the veil off pulls the veil off about a third of the church says that's a cult two-thirds of the church says you've been preaching the truth because we were taught to take it back to our bible i'm wondering if that other third actually took it back to their bible or if they were the lazy ones that just well anyway i'll i'll leave that be baptizes pastor associate minister deacons trustees families why because sometimes william branham becomes a hera to the people if google says it it's got to be true oh my my neighbor who i just asked to pray for my daughter and god did touch her and i thanked him he oh by the way he didn't ask anyone else to pray he doesn't pray his own self imagine this we're narrowing this down he's in a cult what did i do i asked a guy in a cult to pray for my daughter yeah we're all in on the cult those of you got your own religion built around your own thoughts in your own world or in a cult of your own hallelujah oh i know sometimes we don't like that it but it's the truth saints amen what did they do god sent wesley he was the voice for that day goes right on down so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age what does that do it doesn't absolve us my brother and sister it actually binds us to live a life and to speak a gospel that is true and people can look at you and say what they claim is real not they spoke it on sunday and they are something different let your ministry be faithful amen and let's purge let me just say this one last time let's just purge any iniquity i just almost struggle to say that because it seems like i'm saying people are you're not christians and i'm not at all my brother and sister but let's just purge iniquity out of our life the word says it let's do it i'm not talking about words of men i'm talking about the word of god sister amy would you come i need to stop it's it's late hallelujah this morning i told myself paul don't do this don't do this sorry just can't help myself amen lord willing i want to just share this with you lord dwelling brother chris we'll be ministering this coming wednesday and then our brother david nash will be coming back through town um on an errand that he come here and then flew out of boise and we'll be coming back and lord willing he will be here to minister for us this coming sunday so be praying for brother chris and brother david sister jerry and i will will be gone uh working amen my brother and sister i want to remind you right as we go an amazing grace has always been my song of praise brother jason can you come lead us in that amen i just want to remind you saints once again the ever-present god is not a historical god he's a god that answers prayer and if we will seek truth now i i don't mean to impose any will upon you saints but i do encourage you include in your prayer life lord lead me and guide me into all truth make that part of your everyday life and you will realize that god will take you places you never thought you would go god will show you things you never thought you would see why because he's faithful to his promise amen hallelujah you know you look at some of these things like the opening of the seals people criticized and said well if william branham had a revelation god wanted him to preach the seals wouldn't he have just gave it to him but you see a lot of that was that direct anointing of the day fresh manna he didn't come and have it all written out because you know what the nature of it is students you write papers for school right if we're not careful we second-guess what we wrote right we write something out we look at it that don't sound right i want to scratch that out i'll write it this way no that looks better i'll write it this way pretty soon we've morphed the whole thing god said you know i don't want anybody morphing this i don't need them writing it down and then rewriting it i'm just going to give it fresh right now and let it be preached fresh amen that's what revelation is about hallelujah [Music] amazing grace can we just stand and worship the lord thank him for his grace [Music] [Music] [Music] just why he came to love me so he looked beyond my fault and saw my knees [Music] jesus died for me [Music] [Music] my fault and saw my
