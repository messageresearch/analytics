[45:14] of rope
[45:15] you know if you're a cowboy you'd call
[45:16] it a pigeon string
[45:18] and what he's trying to do my brother
[45:20] and sister is to get us
[45:21] to offer to be bound
[45:26] well this didn't go like it was supposed
[45:27] to and this isn't like it was supposed
[45:29] to and this seems to be this way
[45:31] and he wants us to stand there if he can
[45:33] just let me be a little dramatic and
[45:35] we cross our ankles and we cross our
[45:37] hands and
[45:38] we just let him tie us up but what
[45:41] happens my brother and sister when a son
[45:43] or daughter of god
[45:44] has found liberty amen
[45:47] the devil might be trying to tie us up
[45:50] to bind us
[45:51] but we kick we scream we cry out to the
[45:54] lord
[45:55] amen we don't just sit still we don't
[45:57] volunteer for what satan's got to
[46:00] offer amen thank you lord
[46:03] exodus the fifth chapter starting with
[46:05] the first verse
[46:06] and afterward moses and aaron went in
[46:08] and told pharaoh
[46:10] now look i don't know about you guys but
[46:13] when i deal with people of high
[46:14] authority
[46:17] usually my adrenaline starts going
[46:21] to them and my brain goes
[46:26] you ever had that happen that's what
[46:28] usually happens when you come face to
[46:30] face with someone who can
[46:31] you know exercise some authority on you
[46:34] and and as it were
[46:35] approve or disapprove you know you just
[46:38] it's a human element
[46:40] the same thing happens when your wife
[46:42] hides behind the bathroom door and jumps
[46:44] out in the dark and yells boo
[46:46] but um amen look at this moses and aaron
[46:49] went in
[46:50] and they told pharaoh look this is a guy
[46:53] who could have just said haul him out
[46:54] and kill them
[46:55] except for god wouldn't allow that amen
[46:57] thus saith the lord god of israel
[47:00] let my people go that they may hold a
[47:02] feast unto me
[47:03] in the wilderness and pharaoh said who
[47:06] is the lord that i should obey his voice
[47:08] to let israel go
[47:10] man bad question i know not the lord
[47:13] neither will i let israel go now my
[47:16] brother and sister i'm going to get
[47:17] ahead of myself but i'm going to say
[47:18] this this sounds like a modern day
[47:20] politician right here
[47:21] amen and they said the god of the
[47:23] hebrews hath met with us
[47:25] let us go we pray thee three days
[47:28] journey into the desert
[47:29] and sacrifice unto the lord our god lest
[47:32] he fall upon us with pestilence or with
[47:34] the sword
[47:35] and the king of egypt said unto them
[47:37] wherefore do ye moses and aaron let
[47:40] the people from their works get ye unto
[47:43] your burdens and pharaoh said behold the
[47:46] people of the land now
[47:47] are many and ye make them rest from
[47:50] their burdens
[47:51] and pharaoh commanded the same day that
[47:53] the task masters of the people in their
[47:55] office are saying
[47:56] he shall no more give the people straw
[47:59] to make brick
[48:00] as heretofore let them go and gather
[48:02] straw for themselves
[48:04] and the tail of the bricks which they
[48:06] did make heretofore
[48:08] ye shall lay upon them he shall not
[48:11] diminish
[48:12] ought thereof for they be idle therefore
[48:15] they cry saying let us go
[48:17] and sacrifice unto our god heavenly
[48:20] father
[48:21] lord we thank you for your grace your
[48:23] mercy for the word in the day father
[48:25] that would just keep our hearts on fire
[48:27] keep us tuned into you father lord
[48:30] constantly lord i know this is my prayer
[48:32] each and every day
[48:34] lord if there be something in me lord
[48:36] purge it from me wash it from me
[48:38] lord that i would be right before you
[48:40] for father it is not who i please on
[48:43] this earth lord
[48:44] but pleasing you is our goal father we
[48:47] love you we adore you ask you to come
[48:49] down in our midst this evening
[48:51] for father i offer myself father as a
[48:54] tabernacle
[48:55] a fire lord a testament and lord we have
[48:58] come together as many licks of fire
[49:00] tonight
[49:01] lord to lift this up before you and this
[49:04] world in the name of jesus christ we
[49:06] pray
[49:06] amen you may be seated
[49:14] let there more work be laid upon the men
[49:18] that they may labor therein and let them
[49:20] not regard
[49:21] vain words and the task masters of the
[49:23] people went out and their officers and
[49:25] they spake to the people saying
[49:27] thus saith pharaoh my we have a lot of
[49:31] these thus say us in this day my brother
[49:33] and sister
[49:34] i like thus saith the lord that's the
[49:36] one i want to listen to
[49:37] amen not what this person over here who
[49:40] thinks they have authority or this one
[49:41] over here
[49:42] but what did the lord say i will not
[49:45] give you straw
[49:47] go ye get ye straw from where you can
[49:49] find
[49:50] it ye yet not ought of your work shall
[49:53] be diminished
[49:54] so the people were scattered abroad
[49:56] throughout all the land of egypt
[49:57] together stubble
[49:59] instead of straw and the task masters
[50:01] hasted them saying
[50:03] fulfill your works your daily task as
[50:05] when there was straw
[50:06] and the officers of the children of
[50:08] israel which pharaoh's task masters had
[50:10] said over them
[50:11] were beaten and demanded wherefore have
[50:14] you not fulfilled your task in making
[50:16] brick both yesterday and today
[50:18] as heretofore then the officers of the
[50:20] children of israel came and cried unto
[50:22] pharaoh saying
[50:23] wherefore dealest thou thus with thy
[50:26] servants
[50:27] there is no straw given unto thy
[50:29] servants and they say to us
[50:32] make brick and behold thy servants are
[50:34] beaten
[50:35] but the fault is in thine own people
[50:38] but he said ye are idle ye are idle
[50:41] therefore you say let us go
[50:42] and do sacrifices to the lord go
[50:46] therefore now and work for there shall
[50:49] no straw be given you
[50:50] yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks
[50:54] oh my oh my asking god's blessings upon
[50:57] the word tonight
[50:59] now we look my brother and sister of
[51:00] what was happening with israel at this
[51:02] time there
[51:03] and you know part of this my brother and
[51:05] sister is the lord spoke and said that
[51:07] they would be
[51:08] 400 years in this bondage and yet my
[51:10] brother and sister
[51:11] it is that god did not just go down to
[51:14] deliver them because
[51:16] the time had ticked tick ticked away and
[51:19] 400 years had passed
[51:20] but it was in the prophecy of the time
[51:23] that the people's desire to be set free
[51:27] was rising up something rising up in
[51:29] them and as the word spoken put
[51:31] time to it the relevance of that time i
[51:34] believe was lost upon the
[51:36] people but the burdens upon them were so
[51:38] grievous and the world around them so
[51:40] grievous
[51:41] that it was in that time frame they
[51:43] started to cry out
[51:44] now my brother and sister if god was to
[51:46] have told us
[51:47] that at a certain time in the coming
[51:49] months or years that he was coming for
[51:51] us
[51:52] many people my brother and sister would
[51:54] not change at all
[51:55] they would not they would say well i
[51:57] know that he's going to come in the year
[51:58] you know 2027
[52:00] i'll just wait till 2027 i'll get my
[52:03] life right but my brother and sister
[52:04] that's not how god works
[52:06] god puts burdens upon us things that
[52:09] start to work upon our lives uh
[52:11] things that have influence upon us and
[52:14] it's in there that he starts you might
[52:16] say the churning
[52:17] within our soul within our spirit that
[52:19] we start to say you know what i've got
[52:21] to have god
[52:22] i need the lord i just can't go another
[52:24] day without this
[52:25] you see god doesn't just give us a time
[52:27] table my brother and sister
[52:29] that we do because now i i'm gonna say
[52:32] that it's not you but people like
[52:34] me got you on that one
[52:38] that we are procrastinators
[52:42] now some of you are not some of your
[52:43] johnny on the spot needs to be done
[52:45] you do that amen that's like the guy who
[52:48] you know the people set their watch
[52:49] because saturday morning at 6 45 they
[52:53] hear his lawnmower start
[52:55] they don't like him but they can use him
[52:58] for a time piece
[53:00] because they're so punctual but most of
[53:03] us
[53:03] would say you know what if he's coming
[53:05] in the year 2027
[53:07] then you know we wouldn't go out and
[53:08] just visit the world that's not who we
[53:10] are
[53:10] but we wouldn't be on fire but what
[53:12] god's turning something inside of us
[53:15] and i say thank you lord because
[53:16] otherwise we we would sit back
[53:18] and it isn't that we wouldn't get right
[53:20] or we wouldn't make a rapture or
[53:22] something would happen
[53:23] would be all the blessings that we would
[53:25] miss all all the answered prayers
[53:28] all of the things that that god would
[53:30] love that he wants to do
[53:31] for us and when we get sluggish and
[53:34] slaggered
[53:35] about all these things and then we just
[53:37] kind of set back and it's like we miss
[53:40] something really good amen so god knew
[53:42] what was happening but look at the
[53:44] tactics of the enemy this evening
[53:46] amen you know he said i hear moses and
[53:49] aaron tell them you know
[53:51] let my people go now they weren't
[53:53] speaking on their own behalf my brother
[53:55] and sister there
[53:56] is a thus saith the lord in front of
[53:57] this and i'm sure that moses well we
[54:00] know where moses stood on this lord i
[54:02] can't do this
[54:03] i stutter and i and all this and nobody
[54:05] understands me i get too nervous
[54:06] and you know my brother and sister they
[54:08] didn't really want to do that but god
[54:10] chose them
[54:11] to be his mouthpiece god could have come
[54:13] and just absolutely
[54:15] shaken the the uh uh the house of
[54:18] pharaoh
[54:19] he could have shaken the government
[54:20] buildings he his voice could have
[54:23] dominated everything
[54:24] but god chooses men to carry the voice
[54:27] amen and he's done that over and over
[54:30] again and i say my brother and sister
[54:32] what a privilege it
[54:33] is that we could stand today and not as
[54:36] prophets but yet we prophesy you say how
[54:39] do you prophesy brother paul
[54:41] because i get up every day and i say the
[54:43] lord
[54:44] is going to lead me and guide me today
[54:47] amen you say that's not really a
[54:48] prophecy well you know what
[54:50] i'm speaking what i want to see come to
[54:52] pass i could have got up and said you
[54:54] know what
[54:54] i'd just be happy to survive today well
[54:57] maybe then that's all you would do is
[54:59] survive the day
[55:00] but i don't want to be a survivor i want
[55:02] to be an overcomer i want to be one that
[55:04] says risen up got some
[55:06] some authority you might say to bind
[55:08] satan and say you know what satan
[55:10] uh you're not going to run rampant in
[55:12] this household
[55:14] today amen so they're there and
[55:17] and uh you know the people as moses and
[55:19] aaron are speaking to pharaoh
[55:21] the people had a desire now i want to
[55:23] just put this into
[55:24] our our day today if you would allow me
[55:26] that amen
[55:27] they're going to be some special
[55:29] meetings we're going to go out here
[55:30] there's a special place out here in the
[55:32] desert
[55:33] and we're going to have some special
[55:34] meetings got some special speakers
[55:36] we're going to have a good time in the
[55:38] lord now the devil will come
[55:40] and do everything he can do to keep the
[55:43] people
[55:44] from going and being blessed in the
[55:46] presence of god
[55:47] and so he would come my brother and
[55:48] sister in this time of worship
[55:50] and and you know he would say nope not
[55:52] going to happen i'm not going to allow
[55:54] it to do that
[55:54] and i've seen it through the years my
[55:56] brother and sister many many times
[55:59] that you'd have a desire to do something
[56:01] and satan throws his wrench
[56:03] out there now my brother and sister
[56:05] satan might be in control of that wrench
[56:07] but remember what the prophet of god
[56:09] said he said that
[56:10] satan has his push coming but god does
[56:13] some pushing also amen
[56:15] so i say thank you lord that my god's
[56:17] bigger than the devil
[56:19] amen so it's there now pharaoh is
[56:21] speaking
[56:22] now this reminds me and i won't name
[56:24] names tonight if i can help myself
[56:25] but you know we've had some politicians
[56:28] here in the united states
[56:29] that as this pandemic is winding down
[56:32] and different things have happened
[56:33] one of them uh come right on national
[56:35] news and basically said you know we've
[56:37] saved all these lives we've done this
[56:39] we've done that
[56:40] god had nothing to do with it
[56:44] oh my my brother and sister when i i
[56:46] heard this i was
[56:47] i was told by someone watch this clip
[56:49] and i did when i heard that i thought my
[56:52] goodness what a sorry state
[56:53] but you know what there'll be millions
[56:54] of people would have said that's right
[56:56] we did it by science we did it by our
[56:58] education
[56:59] we did it by our will and our work amen
[57:01] my brother and sister none of that
[57:02] consists without god
[57:04] amen so you know we got this same spirit
[57:07] right
[57:07] spirits don't die amen so just as
[57:11] these things are come along and and you
[57:14] say well
[57:14] okay this sure seems like this was this
[57:17] now i
[57:18] i don't mean to be funny for funny sake
[57:20] tonight but i always thought this was
[57:22] interesting that long before these kids
[57:24] were walking around their pants hanging
[57:25] off their bottom
[57:26] they did it in the early 70s
[57:30] hallelujah i know because i was in
[57:31] school and i did it i know that's hard
[57:33] to imagine
[57:35] and you know long before everybody wore
[57:37] a long sleeve shirt and turned up two
[57:39] cuffs
[57:41] it happened there's nothing
[57:44] new under the sun
[57:48] so every spirit has already made its
[57:51] appearance and will make its appearance
[57:53] again and we're living in the age which
[57:56] is the culmination
[57:58] so these spirits are all going to come
[58:00] together my brother and sister and so
[58:02] they just bunched together and now we
[58:04] have variations you might say
[58:06] of the same thing now you look at this
[58:09] and realize
[58:10] that we live in a day now i say this for
[58:12] a little bit of humor
[58:13] uh you know uh i was just in town the
[58:17] other day
[58:19] and i'm sorry but i i was looking at
[58:22] this individual
[58:23] and i thought he looks like a pirate
[58:25] from the caribbean
[58:27] all he needs is a boat
[58:30] now i don't know what the identity is my
[58:32] brother and sister
[58:33] i don't know where and i say this in
[58:36] center
[58:37] sincerity i don't know where the
[58:39] anointing is that would cause
[58:41] normally normal looking people
[58:45] to even have it on their forehead and
[58:48] tattoo within the insides and the
[58:50] backsides of their ears
[58:52] and all of these kind of things i i i'm
[58:55] it's just foreign to me
[59:00] i'm going to say it
[59:04] i see a man with a pearl earring in his
[59:06] ear
[59:08] my first thought is that's cute
[59:12] if his wife was wearing it you see we've
[59:15] lost
[59:17] these things these manly kind of things
[59:22] pharaoh says who is the lord then i
[59:25] should obey his voice to let israel go
[59:27] i know not the lord least he was honest
[59:30] and neither
[59:31] neither will i let israel go so you know
[59:34] we live in a day as i gave this example
[59:36] we live in a day where politicians will
[59:38] have influence on millions of people
[59:40] would stand up and say you know what
[59:42] what we're doing has nothing to do with
[59:43] god and
[59:44] you know my brother and sister the
[59:46] regardless of what they say it's very
[59:48] apparent they know not god
[59:49] and you know there is a certain you
[59:51] might say bondage
[59:53] that in the world we live in now my
[59:55] brother and sister if i could just delve
[59:57] into
[59:57] just a current event for just a moment
[59:59] to kind of touch upon this
[1:00:00] you see in the world we live in the
[1:00:02] restrictions that are placed upon
[1:00:04] humanity upon churches all of these
[1:00:06] things they're trying to present this
[1:00:09] with these words of this is the new
[1:00:12] normal now i'm sorry this was
[1:00:15] never the normal for the bride of jesus
[1:00:17] christ
[1:00:18] amen this world was never our normal
[1:00:21] amen now it might be a new normal for
[1:00:24] those who have now been drawn
[1:00:26] into a tighter scope of bondage while
[1:00:29] they are
[1:00:29] they're very dependent many people right
[1:00:31] now very dependent upon the government
[1:00:33] they would like to see the government
[1:00:35] give every one of us two thousand
[1:00:36] dollars a month
[1:00:37] for for whatever period of time and
[1:00:41] all these they would love to see the
[1:00:42] government raise this and extend that
[1:00:44] and all this they would love that my
[1:00:46] brother and sister but what they don't
[1:00:47] realize
[1:00:48] is they are actually just volunteering
[1:00:51] to come into the bondage
[1:00:52] they are bringing themselves into a
[1:00:54] deeper position
[1:00:56] a dependency as it were now my brother
[1:00:58] and sister
[1:00:59] i am a very dependent person i would
[1:01:01] tell you this evening
[1:01:02] that i am a completely dependent person
[1:01:04] just as dependent
[1:01:06] as a newborn baby because i have figured
[1:01:09] out every time that paul
[1:01:10] tries to do things on his own without
[1:01:13] the lord's guidance without his hand
[1:01:15] i mess it up very very bad so i'm
[1:01:18] completely dependent upon the leadership
[1:01:21] of the holy spirit to guide us amen my
[1:01:23] lord jesus he said i'll be with you even
[1:01:26] in you to the end
[1:01:27] so you see what we got to do is stop and
[1:01:29] come to the place that the turmoil
[1:01:31] ends that the questions in the doubts
[1:01:34] and the fears in
[1:01:35] and we can come into a place that we
[1:01:37] know that there is a rest there there is
[1:01:39] a peace there amen
[1:01:41] so the world today desires to keep every
[1:01:44] bondage
[1:01:45] that is in place in this world right now
[1:01:48] keep it
[1:01:48] in place he doesn't want that to change
[1:01:50] in fact he would like to
[1:01:52] increase that if at all possible amen
[1:01:55] so you know it's there that we see this
[1:01:58] playing out
[1:01:59] that the people are desiring they want
[1:02:01] to come and
[1:02:02] and look i'm telling you my brother and
[1:02:04] sister god if you're a son
[1:02:06] or daughter of god and i believe we're
[1:02:08] all sons and daughters tonight
[1:02:09] amen god's not going to leave you alone
[1:02:12] you might as well just plan on god
[1:02:13] whispering in your ear
[1:02:15] in the middle of the night in the middle
[1:02:16] of the day you might as well plan on god
[1:02:18] being
[1:02:19] on the bus to train the plane on the job
[1:02:22] whether you're a got a shovel in your
[1:02:23] hand
[1:02:24] or whether you're doing something
[1:02:26] cutting hair whatever it might be
[1:02:28] you might as well just plan on god being
[1:02:30] right there talking to you
[1:02:31] there's no escape amen there's no such
[1:02:34] thing as a great escape from god
[1:02:36] and so as you look at this and we'll
[1:02:38] realize now
[1:02:39] as it is that they are coming to this
[1:02:41] place that that there
[1:02:43] is a real struggle that is taking place
[1:02:46] here
[1:02:46] between this but look what they said in
[1:02:48] verse 3 they said the god of the hebrews
[1:02:51] hath met with us oh i tell you what my
[1:02:55] brother and sister that's no
[1:02:56] small thing to realize that they as a
[1:02:59] nation forsook god
[1:03:01] and went into bondage for 400 years
[1:03:04] and now their testimony is god has met
[1:03:08] with us
[1:03:09] and what we want to do after this
[1:03:11] meeting is we want to fulfill god's will
[1:03:13] we want to go out here into the the
[1:03:16] desert into
[1:03:17] uh for three days and we want to go out
[1:03:20] there and make a sacrifice
[1:03:22] as i put it to this modern time we want
[1:03:24] to have a revival out there we want to
[1:03:26] hear some
[1:03:26] good old preaching we want god to come
[1:03:28] down in our midst
[1:03:29] and the holy spirit to stir us up again
[1:03:32] because you see we have been away from
[1:03:34] god
[1:03:34] and god in his grace and mercy came down
[1:03:37] to us
[1:03:38] and spoke and you know what we're kind
[1:03:40] of afraid now
[1:03:41] i have to admit i've been down this road
[1:03:43] thank the lord as many years ago
[1:03:45] but i remember there was a stage in my
[1:03:47] life that i thought oh lord you know i
[1:03:49] know i got to get right
[1:03:51] but i don't know lord will i will will i
[1:03:53] get right
[1:03:54] i didn't get right that day
[1:03:58] i wanted to get right i knew i should
[1:04:00] get right but i didn't
[1:04:02] but there come a time stirred up within
[1:04:05] me i won't go into all the details some
[1:04:07] of them aren't very pretty
[1:04:09] but there come a day i said i'm getting
[1:04:10] right today
[1:04:12] today is the day because i kinda now i
[1:04:14] hope you understand where i'm coming
[1:04:15] from
[1:04:16] and this might be the day that a
[1:04:17] pestilence or a sword might fall upon me
[1:04:19] and i was troubled enough in my spirit i
[1:04:22] knew this is the day i'm gonna get
[1:04:24] everything straightened out amen
[1:04:26] hallelujah oh my you know god coming
[1:04:29] into their midst after 400 years there
[1:04:30] was a renewing taking place
[1:04:33] now as we look here in the sermon why
[1:04:36] are people so tossed about now remember
[1:04:39] this morning
[1:04:40] this evening today amen we are talking
[1:04:43] about where shall we find rest now this
[1:04:46] isn't going to do us any good my brother
[1:04:47] and sister if we're over here saying you
[1:04:49] know brother so-and-so sister so and so
[1:04:51] just seem to have such a peace and such
[1:04:53] a comfort and such a confidence
[1:04:55] there there just seemed to be so
[1:04:56] anchored my brother sister won't do you
[1:04:58] any good trying to hang on to their
[1:04:59] anchor
[1:05:00] amen every ship every vessel's got its
[1:05:02] own anchor
[1:05:03] amen i've never heard of somebody saying
[1:05:06] look let me pull up real close to you
[1:05:07] and use your anchor
[1:05:09] i don't think that'll work amen now
[1:05:12] look now our faith cannot rest upon
[1:05:15] nothing
[1:05:15] now i'm going to have to use something
[1:05:17] else because brother chris stole my
[1:05:18] bottle of water
[1:05:19] amen hallelujah now look
[1:05:22] the prophet of god is saying our faith
[1:05:25] cannot rest upon nothing
[1:05:27] now if i hold this bottle of olive oil
[1:05:30] out here
[1:05:31] and i just let go of it it's going to
[1:05:32] keep going until it finds something to
[1:05:34] rest upon
[1:05:36] right so i can't just say now look watch
[1:05:38] this saints i'm going to just put this
[1:05:39] bottle right here
[1:05:40] and i'll come back and get it in a few
[1:05:41] minutes it's got to have
[1:05:43] a resting place amen
[1:05:46] now you know the cool thing about it is
[1:05:48] if our god wants a bottle of olive oil
[1:05:50] to stand out in the open
[1:05:51] it will amen but look at this our faith
[1:05:54] cannot rest upon nothing
[1:05:56] a christian has to have his faith has to
[1:05:59] have
[1:06:00] a solid resting place can we say amen to
[1:06:03] that
[1:06:03] i'm not wanting something that's just
[1:06:05] the quote goes on and deals with it but
[1:06:06] i just want to expound it i don't want
[1:06:08] to put my faith on something
[1:06:09] that i get up in the morning and it's
[1:06:11] shifted over here i
[1:06:12] go tonight and it's shifted over here
[1:06:15] amen come down to a hard spot in my life
[1:06:17] and it's decided to take a vacation
[1:06:20] no amen solid resting place you know
[1:06:24] that and the only resting place that a
[1:06:25] christian
[1:06:26] a true born-again christian can rest his
[1:06:30] faith
[1:06:30] or hers is upon the unmovable word of
[1:06:33] god
[1:06:34] don't you just love that we know exactly
[1:06:37] where to place our faith
[1:06:38] we don't have to go bounce off the
[1:06:40] bushes and the cactus and everything
[1:06:42] else
[1:06:42] trying to figure out where we can anchor
[1:06:44] ourselves
[1:06:45] but we have the immovable infallible
[1:06:49] word of god to come and anchor that on
[1:06:52] now my brother and sister there'll be
[1:06:54] lots of ideas there's lots of ideas in
[1:06:57] the world
[1:06:57] of where we should be and how we should
[1:07:00] serve god
[1:07:00] there's lots of ideas around the message
[1:07:03] on what we should do and what we
[1:07:05] shouldn't do and how we should look at
[1:07:06] the word of god
[1:07:07] what we want to do is make it our daily
[1:07:09] prayer because he said this work
[1:07:12] i began in you
[1:07:15] amen he's going to finish that's his
[1:07:18] promise
[1:07:19] amen i love that it isn't built upon the
[1:07:22] shifting sands of man's theology
[1:07:25] now look what would be the shifting sand
[1:07:27] of men's theology
[1:07:29] that a man you might have confidence in
[1:07:30] would believe this today
[1:07:33] and believe that tomorrow amen
[1:07:36] what god has as a very steady
[1:07:39] faithful place we can anchor our soul
[1:07:43] and whether it's today tomorrow whether
[1:07:45] you got money in the bank or you don't
[1:07:47] whether you're healthy or you're not
[1:07:49] whether their circumstance in your
[1:07:50] family or not you can
[1:07:52] rest and say i know this is where i can
[1:07:55] anchor my soul
[1:07:57] amen so the shifting sand of a man's
[1:07:59] theology
[1:08:00] and doctrines they change too we look
[1:08:03] over time
[1:08:04] people will say well we believe this but
[1:08:06] it doesn't quite fit we'll shift it to
[1:08:07] this
[1:08:08] my brother and sister god's got one word
[1:08:10] it's a true word
[1:08:11] amen so upon some church affiliation
[1:08:15] look at that i mean ah we're i think we
[1:08:18] can be guilty of this
[1:08:19] i think that we have most of us been
[1:08:21] guilty of this people are like oh where
[1:08:23] do you live i live in idaho where do you
[1:08:25] go to church
[1:08:27] well they're not too impressed because
[1:08:30] they've never heard of us
[1:08:33] but let's shift to a big city with a
[1:08:37] very dynamic
[1:08:38] minister pastor and people
[1:08:41] now i know this for a fact i'm not just
[1:08:44] surmising
[1:08:45] this is not gossip i know people that
[1:08:47] have the mentality
[1:08:49] if you're not in our church
[1:08:52] you are not making the rapture
[1:08:56] my question to them is and i've asked it
[1:08:59] before
[1:09:00] can you give me a scripture for that
[1:09:04] hmm so
[1:09:07] it's not our church affiliation amen if
[1:09:11] there's any affiliation
[1:09:12] it'd be with our lord jesus christ but a
[1:09:16] true believer his faith rests
[1:09:17] solidly on shifting as he approaches the
[1:09:20] word of god
[1:09:22] amen so what the word said yesterday it
[1:09:24] will say the same to me today
[1:09:26] and it will say the same thing tomorrow
[1:09:28] amen so what god was pleased with
[1:09:31] yesterday or in ages gone by he will be
[1:09:34] pleased with
[1:09:35] today amen that's a lovely thing i think
[1:09:38] amen
[1:09:39] because when we saw god come and honor
[1:09:41] his word
[1:09:42] in days gone by as we would be
[1:09:44] privileged to look back through history
[1:09:46] we'll know those same things will please
[1:09:48] god
[1:09:49] so what that brings at least to me i can
[1:09:51] only speak for me tonight amen i don't
[1:09:52] want to be presumptuous
[1:09:54] but what it does to me is gives me a
[1:09:56] confidence
[1:09:58] now we brought this out we touched upon
[1:09:59] it the other day i'll touch on it just
[1:10:01] for a moment
[1:10:02] tonight my brother and sister when the
[1:10:04] word says it would deceive the very
[1:10:06] elect
[1:10:06] if it were possible now we don't run
[1:10:09] around i don't want anybody to
[1:10:10] misunderstand that we run around
[1:10:12] boasting that we can't be deceived
[1:10:15] anybody who thinks that is crazy but
[1:10:18] there is a
[1:10:19] confidence that comes knowing that as
[1:10:22] a son or daughter of god i recognize
[1:10:26] amen as we preach this last sunday on
[1:10:28] mary
[1:10:28] amen what did she declare i am a
[1:10:31] handmaiden
[1:10:32] of the lord she didn't say i hope to be
[1:10:35] a handmaiden of the lord
[1:10:37] and someday i might be a handmaiden of
[1:10:40] the lord
[1:10:40] but she had a confidence down within her
[1:10:43] soul
[1:10:44] of where she rested she didn't say well
[1:10:47] i'll be a handmaiden
[1:10:48] and tell proven differently or
[1:10:51] handmaiden until something
[1:10:53] weird puts me off my track she knew who
[1:10:56] she was
[1:10:57] and she declared that and i say god help
[1:10:59] us that we would just declare what we
[1:11:02] know
[1:11:03] satan might be trying to tell us that
[1:11:04] well you can't be a christian
[1:11:06] you couldn't be a part of the bride of
[1:11:07] christ not you not with this
[1:11:09] not with that my brother and sister the
[1:11:11] word called us now remember
[1:11:13] that man come i believe it was a man
[1:11:15] correct me if i'm wrong but that
[1:11:16] individual i'll just put it that way
[1:11:18] come to brother branham and they'd been
[1:11:20] searching whether they had the holy
[1:11:21] ghost and they'd went over
[1:11:22] here and they'd went over there and
[1:11:25] they'd seen a flyer and went over
[1:11:27] here and finally they end up there with
[1:11:29] brother branham
[1:11:30] and they're theirs pouring out their
[1:11:32] heart because they
[1:11:34] have this huge question about whether
[1:11:36] they have the holy ghost or not
[1:11:38] and brother branham asked him he says
[1:11:39] well when did this come upon you this
[1:11:41] desire this
[1:11:42] and they declare and they share what
[1:11:44] time it was and they declare that they
[1:11:46] ask the lord for the holy ghost and the
[1:11:48] prophet of god says that's where that
[1:11:50] come
[1:11:51] amen that's where you got the holy ghost
[1:11:53] all of this
[1:11:54] was just satan trying to bluff the
[1:11:55] individual to doubt
[1:11:57] who they were through all of this
[1:12:01] time and so if you think about that all
[1:12:03] of the frustration
[1:12:05] all of the worry all of the stress that
[1:12:07] it would be
[1:12:08] and my brother and sister you know that
[1:12:10] fear paralyzes
[1:12:12] amen it's a proven effect physical
[1:12:14] psychological
[1:12:16] fear will paralyze
[1:12:19] and that's what satan set out to do what
[1:12:20] they do put such a question mark am i a
[1:12:22] daughter of god am i son of god
[1:12:24] could this be could that be and the fear
[1:12:27] will come
[1:12:28] and paralyze and a paralyzed person
[1:12:30] doesn't move
[1:12:34] but the holy ghost will come in there
[1:12:35] and just put a person right where they
[1:12:37] belong
[1:12:38] amen but you see what god's wanting to
[1:12:40] do as we tie this back to this
[1:12:42] my brothers and sisters the egyptians
[1:12:45] amen
[1:12:46] the king of egypt said unto them
[1:12:48] wherefore do ye moses
[1:12:50] and aaron let the people from their
[1:12:52] works
[1:12:54] look at those words right there my
[1:12:55] brother and sister he tells them
[1:12:58] get you unto your burdens
[1:13:02] my i'll tell you what when the devil he
[1:13:03] comes right down he's so clever
[1:13:06] amen because every one of us got some
[1:13:07] burdens can we admit that
[1:13:09] every one of us has got something that
[1:13:11] just plagues us it's the thing that
[1:13:12] wakes you up at 2am
[1:13:14] and you fret over amen now what does the
[1:13:16] devil want you to do
[1:13:18] he wants you to go back now pardon me
[1:13:20] this evening
[1:13:21] but you want you to go back and lay a
[1:13:23] hold
[1:13:24] of your burden and say this is my
[1:13:27] problem
[1:13:27] this is something from my family
[1:13:29] something i've done
[1:13:31] some condition around me it's mine i
[1:13:33] guess i
[1:13:34] should own it
[1:13:37] oh but what did the word say the word
[1:13:41] says that we give
[1:13:42] our burdens to the lord jesus amen cast
[1:13:45] your burdens unto him amen
[1:13:47] so look at that the paradox that we have
[1:13:50] now because now we have to make the
[1:13:52] decision
[1:13:52] am i going to cast my burden away or am
[1:13:55] i going to own it
[1:13:57] well i'll tell you what my brother and
[1:13:59] sister you can own it for a long time
[1:14:00] but all it'll do is beat you to a
[1:14:02] frazzle
[1:14:03] amen what we need to do is stop yep
[1:14:06] there is now there's scripture that says
[1:14:08] you're going to own your burden
[1:14:09] now you need to understand what that
[1:14:11] scripture is really meaning it's telling
[1:14:13] you my brother and sister
[1:14:14] that we cannot uh live we cannot be
[1:14:16] angry we cannot
[1:14:18] uh uh do all of these kind of things and
[1:14:20] then think we can turn one day and just
[1:14:22] walk away from it like it never happened
[1:14:23] amen we got to deal with it it's got to
[1:14:25] be put under the blood we got to repent
[1:14:28] amen and boy the devil can make
[1:14:30] repenting into a really hard business
[1:14:31] can't he amen but what we got to do is
[1:14:34] just come to the place we are so humbled
[1:14:36] before god
[1:14:37] that we don't care what anyone thinks
[1:14:38] about you you know i mean you could be a
[1:14:40] pastor of a church for an example
[1:14:42] and you'd be worried about what other
[1:14:44] people in other places
[1:14:46] think about you and if you're not
[1:14:47] careful then you will adjust your life
[1:14:49] and your preaching and your church and
[1:14:51] everything
[1:14:52] about what somebody out there is going
[1:14:53] to do but the truth of it is like the
[1:14:55] money man dave ramsey says
[1:14:57] they could care less what kind of
[1:14:59] clothes you wear
[1:15:01] they could care less what kind of car
[1:15:03] you drive what kind of house you live in
[1:15:05] they could care less now my brother and
[1:15:08] sister we got one person to please and
[1:15:10] that's our lord jesus
[1:15:11] amen so everybody wants you to please
[1:15:14] them amen everybody wants somebody to
[1:15:16] please them
[1:15:16] but i tell you there's only one we're
[1:15:18] going to worry about pleasing and that's
[1:15:19] our lord jesus
[1:15:20] amen we do our work we take care of our
[1:15:23] things and
[1:15:24] we'll be fine amen so he tells them
[1:15:27] right here let your people from their
[1:15:28] works with question mark
[1:15:30] get you into your burdens see we're not
[1:15:32] going to give you a rest from the cares
[1:15:34] of life
[1:15:34] now look at this we're the bride of
[1:15:35] jesus christ if you got a mortgage you
[1:15:38] still got to make the payment
[1:15:39] you got a car you got to put gas and oil
[1:15:41] and tires and whatever you understand
[1:15:43] where i'm going i don't need to
[1:15:44] elaborate
[1:15:45] see so there's certain burdens that we
[1:15:47] we are under constantly
[1:15:48] now if we could live debt-free you know
[1:15:52] and you know whatever there's still you
[1:15:55] know the bills you still got to pay the
[1:15:56] bills you still got to pay them on time
[1:15:58] you still got to do all these things
[1:15:59] so we're living here uh no release from
[1:16:02] the cares of life
[1:16:04] amen that's why you know when people
[1:16:05] come around and started preaching that
[1:16:07] we were in the millennium some people
[1:16:08] got all excited
[1:16:10] we're in the millennium already it's all
[1:16:11] done it's all finished we don't do this
[1:16:13] i
[1:16:13] i said i won't go into details about it
[1:16:15] but i set one time in a restaurant
[1:16:17] with a man uh that that believe that and
[1:16:20] he was an old friend from years gone by
[1:16:22] and and he believed that and we're
[1:16:24] sitting in the restaurant and i thank
[1:16:25] the lord
[1:16:26] uh that this and i'll just be blunt with
[1:16:28] you tonight okay i'm not gonna pull any
[1:16:29] punches
[1:16:30] this this waitress uh was was quite
[1:16:33] quite beautiful young woman
[1:16:34] is quite beautiful and not dressed very
[1:16:37] good
[1:16:38] and i just one glimpse of it and i was
[1:16:40] like oh my
[1:16:41] but you know god was gracious because
[1:16:43] she always come from my right shoulder
[1:16:45] and put food and whatever on the table
[1:16:47] from right here and i didn't have to
[1:16:48] bother looking at it
[1:16:49] but i'm not speaking down on this man
[1:16:50] but but it was there and and i'm just
[1:16:52] saying that she was quite beautiful
[1:16:54] i mean like extraordinary beautiful i'm
[1:16:57] gonna drive that home to you did i say
[1:16:58] that
[1:16:59] she's really beautiful
[1:17:02] later we're sitting at his kitchen table
[1:17:04] and we're discussing these things and
[1:17:06] he's telling me
[1:17:06] we're already in the millennium and i
[1:17:08] said then why
[1:17:10] i wasn't very nice there's people that
[1:17:12] don't think i'm very nice
[1:17:15] did you guys know that there's some
[1:17:16] people don't think i'm very nice
[1:17:18] but i'm going to stand for this word
[1:17:20] even if it costs me my life
[1:17:22] i'm not going to put up with the
[1:17:23] nonsense i'm not going to put up with
[1:17:25] that we got this and we got that right
[1:17:26] i want to stand with the word god
[1:17:28] correct me if i'm wrong amen but i trust
[1:17:30] he'll correct me
[1:17:31] amen just listening well i won't go into
[1:17:33] that anyway
[1:17:34] so it was there i just made that simple
[1:17:36] statement it caught him off guard i said
[1:17:38] if we're in the millennium
[1:17:39] there'll be no longer any attraction
[1:17:41] that's right
[1:17:43] but you see what happened is we get
[1:17:45] caught up in the cares of life
[1:17:46] and we struggle with something now if
[1:17:49] somebody offers you
[1:17:50] a shortcut i'll take it back my brother
[1:17:54] and sister when our young people
[1:17:57] what is that called i for just had a
[1:17:58] brain wave
[1:18:01] the journey the play that we played out
[1:18:04] pilgrim's progress
[1:18:05] amen right wasn't there a section in
[1:18:07] there about a shortcut
[1:18:09] amen so they get offered the shortcut
[1:18:12] right
[1:18:12] now some said nope we were told to stay
[1:18:16] on this trail and we're staying on this
[1:18:19] trail but some said you mean i could
[1:18:21] save
[1:18:21] up i bypass all the struggle i bypass
[1:18:25] all of this i bypass whatever i i'm
[1:18:29] i don't want to bypass the rapture
[1:18:33] somebody says oh just put you right over
[1:18:35] here in the millennium no
[1:18:36] i've been laboring as a son or daughter
[1:18:38] of god we've been laboring we've been
[1:18:40] looking
[1:18:41] i want to be a part of that meeting in
[1:18:44] the air
[1:18:44] i want to be a part of coming of my lord
[1:18:47] jesus
[1:18:48] amen i want to be a part of the great
[1:18:50] celebration
[1:18:51] that it will be that the overcomer the
[1:18:54] real christian will have in that day
[1:18:56] i don't want a shortcut amen let me
[1:18:59] experience all the gods because he's
[1:19:01] going to take me through it
[1:19:03] i'm going to finish this race i'm not
[1:19:05] going to run right down to the end
[1:19:06] amen and just quit my brother and sister
[1:19:09] i sometimes feel like it maybe sometimes
[1:19:11] you feel like it but god's not gonna let
[1:19:13] us
[1:19:13] because the seed is in you and
[1:19:16] somebody's gonna be there and look you
[1:19:18] in the face and say
[1:19:19] it's in you it's in you keep pressing
[1:19:23] keep pressing we can do it
[1:19:27] hallelujah amen so no release from the
[1:19:31] cares of life did you know that the old
[1:19:33] phrase keep your nose to the grindstone
[1:19:35] there's something very profound about
[1:19:37] that i read a deal one time that broke
[1:19:38] that down and
[1:19:39] i wished i still had it as a lot of
[1:19:41] things i didn't keep
[1:19:42] you know when people come and they look
[1:19:44] in my office they're like brother paul
[1:19:46] you ought to clean some of this stuff
[1:19:47] out of here
[1:19:48] but in all of that that looks like junk
[1:19:50] to you is a lot of papers with a lot of
[1:19:51] sayings and a lot of things written down
[1:19:53] amen my brother jason i just throwed you
[1:19:55] under the bus how'd it feel
[1:19:57] amen brother jason's always like brother
[1:19:59] paul you need to do something serious
[1:20:00] here
[1:20:01] but you know what my brother and sister
[1:20:03] this man was writing he says you know
[1:20:04] there's more to it about than just
[1:20:06] sticking your nose to the grindstone
[1:20:07] everybody's like i understand that stick
[1:20:08] my nose of grindstone but he said when
[1:20:10] you stick your nose to the grindstone
[1:20:12] you're not looking up or away you're
[1:20:15] looking down
[1:20:16] into your present circumstance and it's
[1:20:19] always painful amen i don't know how
[1:20:22] many of you ever been around a real big
[1:20:24] grindstone you know peddle them and
[1:20:26] and you can sharpen things with it when
[1:20:28] that things are spinning and you got
[1:20:30] something like a hoe or something you're
[1:20:31] grinding an edge on that
[1:20:32] and your finger ever slips that
[1:20:34] grindstone don't care whether it's
[1:20:35] finger or metal
[1:20:37] amen it'll just chew it up so satan's
[1:20:40] trying to get us to get our head down
[1:20:43] and forget who we are could lose our
[1:20:45] vision
[1:20:46] of what we were called for and just get
[1:20:49] caught up in this is my present
[1:20:50] situation
[1:20:51] this is what's going on in my life and
[1:20:53] it's painful
[1:20:55] but let's look up my brother and sister
[1:20:57] we were called to stick our nose to the
[1:20:58] ground
[1:20:59] amen so here again i want to just do
[1:21:01] this now if you listen to the king of
[1:21:04] egypt
[1:21:06] he's going to tell you own your burden
[1:21:09] and you need to then take your burden
[1:21:11] back
[1:21:11] but my brother and sister reiterating
[1:21:13] back to you tonight there's a real focus
[1:21:15] of really what i'm speaking tonight
[1:21:17] amen we've been given a commandment of
[1:21:20] god
[1:21:21] to take our burden and cast it unto
[1:21:24] jesus amen
[1:21:25] we were not called we are not capable
[1:21:29] of day by day week by week year by year
[1:21:32] amen of
[1:21:33] carrying our burdens i've often joked
[1:21:35] with you
[1:21:36] about that you know imagine if you was
[1:21:37] in the airport you saw somebody coming
[1:21:39] towards you
[1:21:40] and they had a suitcase with about 25
[1:21:42] other suitcases attached to it and
[1:21:44] dragging it through the airport now my
[1:21:46] brother and sister you'd say that's
[1:21:48] something weird here
[1:21:49] but that's what's happened to many of us
[1:21:51] we got so many burdens so many cares
[1:21:53] amen i'm guilty i'll just lift my hand
[1:21:54] for you tonight
[1:21:55] amen that we just drag them all along
[1:21:58] with you
[1:21:58] and the joy of our salvation
[1:22:01] has escaped us it has become fleeting to
[1:22:04] us
[1:22:04] we have momentary times that we feel
[1:22:07] liberty to worship and do that and then
[1:22:09] we're right back
[1:22:10] into the grindstone but we are not
[1:22:13] called to do that we were called to cast
[1:22:15] those burdens unto the lord and get up
[1:22:18] now does it make history go away
[1:22:20] if you went and buried your credit card
[1:22:22] you're not going to wake up in the
[1:22:23] morning and mysteriously it's empty
[1:22:25] or paid off but god will give you the
[1:22:29] strength
[1:22:30] to correct your life and get it back in
[1:22:32] order
[1:22:33] amen he'll give you now i used a credit
[1:22:35] card but let's go back to the more human
[1:22:37] element
[1:22:38] base of the human elements and go in
[1:22:40] there whatever the situation might be
[1:22:43] that we can then have the strength to
[1:22:45] press through that battle
[1:22:46] because we already have deliverance amen
[1:22:50] as a one brother preached many times
[1:22:52] years ago i remember the brother used to
[1:22:53] speak it often
[1:22:54] he says you go sow your wild oats and
[1:22:56] then run and pray for crop failure
[1:22:58] god might do that for you once in a
[1:23:00] while but he ain't gonna do it all the
[1:23:01] time
[1:23:02] amen plant the kind of seed you want to
[1:23:04] come up
[1:23:08] amen yep you know he says now the
[1:23:11] people of the land are many and you make
[1:23:13] them to rest from their burdens
[1:23:15] wow what a terrible thing you know i
[1:23:17] often wondered about that in
[1:23:19] in all different countries and different
[1:23:21] economies and different things
[1:23:22] even different churches why that they
[1:23:24] want the people to be under a burden all
[1:23:26] the time
[1:23:27] why wouldn't you want your people a
[1:23:29] church to be in liberty
[1:23:31] why wouldn't you want a church to be
[1:23:33] happy and and the people to be
[1:23:35] just like you know it's wednesday night
[1:23:37] i'm tired praise the lord i'm going to
[1:23:39] church
[1:23:41] i don't care how this old body feels
[1:23:43] i'll bring this body in subjection
[1:23:45] but you know sometimes now i'm not
[1:23:47] trying to poke anybody but sometimes we
[1:23:49] get in this realm that it's like i gotta
[1:23:50] work and i if i go to church on
[1:23:52] wednesday night i'll be too tired on
[1:23:53] thursday morning but i know the god of
[1:23:55] strength
[1:23:56] amen instead i set a question on whether
[1:23:59] you can find the strength why don't we
[1:24:00] stand up with a little authority and say
[1:24:02] lord i'm going to church on wednesday
[1:24:03] night
[1:24:04] brother paul is going to preach too long
[1:24:05] we just know it that's brother paul
[1:24:07] we're not going to get home till way
[1:24:09] past my bedtime but i'm going to get up
[1:24:11] in the morning and i'm going to have
[1:24:13] more energy than i had on tuesday
[1:24:16] morning
[1:24:16] and more energy than i had on any other
[1:24:19] morning because i've asked the lord
[1:24:21] and god answers prayer hallelujah oh
[1:24:24] what a mental concept
[1:24:26] but it's not mental it's the word of god
[1:24:29] amen so as we'll take that
[1:24:31] now look we come to a place you say well
[1:24:33] i just seem to struggle in certain
[1:24:34] things
[1:24:35] just ask god to come give me strength
[1:24:36] lord give me strength lord
[1:24:39] amen so as pharaoh says behold the
[1:24:41] people of the land now are many
[1:24:42] and you make them to rest from their
[1:24:44] burdens he's seeing
[1:24:46] that they need to this is just a
[1:24:48] foretaste my brother and sister of
[1:24:49] laodicea
[1:24:50] we just got to get these people to where
[1:24:52] mom's out of the house dad's out of the
[1:24:53] house
[1:24:54] kids are being raised by cable tv or a
[1:24:57] babysitter or some other kind of thing
[1:24:59] and you know we should have bought this
[1:25:01] house but we bought this house it was
[1:25:02] twice as big
[1:25:03] and now we're under this mortgage but
[1:25:05] you know we love our house more than we
[1:25:07] love anything else
[1:25:08] so we're gonna have to keep just doing
[1:25:09] this honey get a better job honey i'll
[1:25:11] get another
[1:25:12] job i'll deliver pizzas at night do we
[1:25:13] have children uh children i'm your dad
[1:25:17] look that's normal in america very
[1:25:20] normal in america now
[1:25:22] what is he doing don't give them no rest
[1:25:25] from their burden
[1:25:27] god give us wisdom my brother and sister
[1:25:29] i want to see i'll just be blunt tonight
[1:25:32] that'd be okay i want to see every one
[1:25:34] of you living in a nice house
[1:25:36] driving a nice car wearing nice clothes
[1:25:38] with money in the bank but i wish that
[1:25:40] you would be
[1:25:41] poor if it brings you from the house of
[1:25:43] god
[1:25:46] was that plain enough okay
[1:25:51] you see the reason that satan wants to
[1:25:52] put us into this burden my brother and
[1:25:54] sister
[1:25:55] is because he fears a multitude that is
[1:25:58] free from bondage
[1:26:01] let me say that again satan fears a
[1:26:04] multitude
[1:26:05] that is free from bondage now look grace
[1:26:09] here we are wednesday night as brother
[1:26:10] jason always says this is family night
[1:26:12] this is
[1:26:13] this is well i won't go in there offend
[1:26:15] somebody amen
[1:26:17] this is family night now my brother and
[1:26:19] sister if satan can keep us in bondage
[1:26:22] then wednesday night will be just
[1:26:24] another service
[1:26:25] we had at church but what if we are a
[1:26:28] people
[1:26:28] oh can someone say hallelujah amen what
[1:26:31] if we are a people
[1:26:32] with no bondage no bondage amen
[1:26:37] we'd be praying for for our our uh
[1:26:40] for our family you know for an aunt oh
[1:26:42] lord you need to come on the scene god
[1:26:44] hears it we pray for sister a conscious
[1:26:46] mama sister vemma
[1:26:47] lord lord we need you to come on the
[1:26:49] scene amen we've saw i'll
[1:26:51] interject this we've saw god move upon
[1:26:53] sister vimy
[1:26:54] now we won't fully understand where she
[1:26:56] sits in the economy of god it's not my
[1:26:58] problem
[1:26:59] i've seen her cry i've seen her cry out
[1:27:01] to god i've seen her praise the lord
[1:27:03] amen
[1:27:04] so i know that she is there and
[1:27:06] responding
[1:27:07] to it and i don't care some people can
[1:27:09] put a box around a picture frame around
[1:27:11] it
[1:27:11] she's a daughter of god we'll lift her
[1:27:13] up before god
[1:27:15] and we will expect god to come on the
[1:27:17] scene
[1:27:18] and we have to temper that though that
[1:27:20] lord
[1:27:21] thy will be done amen we don't ever want
[1:27:24] to
[1:27:25] push our will on god well you know i got
[1:27:27] a i got a son not serving the lord down
[1:27:29] in phoenix you all know that
[1:27:30] amen if it was me in the human element
[1:27:32] the angel of the lord would come rip his
[1:27:34] front door off tonight
[1:27:37] come on i say that in a humorous fashion
[1:27:40] but if it was left up to paul the angel
[1:27:42] of the lord would rip his front door off
[1:27:43] tonight
[1:27:44] and that family would turn back to
[1:27:45] serving god but you see
[1:27:47] sometimes it's not all about them
[1:27:49] sometimes it's god dealing with you
[1:27:52] and me sometimes god's gonna see
[1:27:55] are you gonna be faithful to lift them
[1:27:58] up in prayer are you going to be
[1:28:00] faithful to stand
[1:28:01] at your post of duty will you stand
[1:28:04] and have rest when the devil says you
[1:28:08] should be agitated
[1:28:09] when the devil said you should be
[1:28:10] nervous when the devil says you should
[1:28:12] be
[1:28:13] in doubt or fear can you stop and say i
[1:28:16] just rest
[1:28:17] in the precious word of my lord jesus i
[1:28:19] just rest upon the promises of god
[1:28:22] i'm not gonna get all shook up and all
[1:28:25] fuzzed up
[1:28:25] because i see this and i think this
[1:28:28] is going to happen my brother and sister
[1:28:31] they were given to god
[1:28:32] god claimed god gave them in the very
[1:28:35] beginning amen
[1:28:36] and we'll just leave it to god
[1:28:38] hallelujah and that might include your
[1:28:40] job your house your whatever you want to
[1:28:42] put right on that same list
[1:28:44] amen because if we are caught up my
[1:28:46] brother and sister
[1:28:47] and we have no rest and our burden then
[1:28:50] controls us
[1:28:52] then my brother and sister will look
[1:28:53] just like the rest of this world out
[1:28:55] here
[1:28:56] amen we'll look like the rats on the
[1:28:58] treadmill
[1:28:59] but i tell you he fears as i said i'm
[1:29:02] sorry to say it again but i just love
[1:29:03] this statement
[1:29:04] satan fears a multitude that is free
[1:29:08] from bondage because what happens he
[1:29:11] fears when you get out from underneath
[1:29:12] that yoke
[1:29:13] that he'll never can i say that
[1:29:16] never get you back underneath that yoke
[1:29:19] again
[1:29:21] oh my brother and sister
[1:29:24] that's something else right there it
[1:29:26] ain't nothing to be ashamed of that we
[1:29:28] got underneath the yoke
[1:29:30] come on are you with me nothing to be
[1:29:32] ashamed of that we were underneath the
[1:29:34] yoke
[1:29:34] but hallelujah when you get out from
[1:29:36] underneath that yoke
[1:29:38] there is no way the devil is ever going
[1:29:41] to drag you back
[1:29:42] because i have found the rest that i
[1:29:45] longed for i found the rest that i
[1:29:47] needed
[1:29:47] i found the rest that brought life to me
[1:29:50] and satan i'll tell you just like that
[1:29:53] man said i'll just chew on him or
[1:29:54] whatever and if i
[1:29:55] tell my teeth are gone and then i'll gum
[1:29:57] him to death hallelujah
[1:30:03] praise the lord
[1:30:07] you know they wanted the same amount of
[1:30:09] bricks
[1:30:11] they wanted to take something away from
[1:30:12] them see nothing's changed
[1:30:15] look at the world it is my brother and
[1:30:17] sister
[1:30:19] america
[1:30:23] i'll just put in natural terms
[1:30:27] more people than ever are sliding down
[1:30:30] the scale
[1:30:32] from middle class to lower class
[1:30:38] they readjusted the economy
[1:30:43] for poverty because they realized that
[1:30:46] whole families can't live on fifteen or
[1:30:49] sixteen thousand a year
[1:30:52] but more families are moving in that
[1:30:55] direction
[1:30:56] now that's just natural right but
[1:30:58] remember there's always a type to the
[1:30:59] spiritual
[1:31:00] you see what they're saying is well it's
[1:31:03] the economy
[1:31:05] it's the virus it's this
[1:31:08] we had to shut your church down
[1:31:12] some people say
[1:31:16] somebody just drove around our church
[1:31:18] anyway uh
[1:31:21] i see taillights um what was i saying
[1:31:26] we gotta shut your church down to
[1:31:28] control the virus
[1:31:31] really now some people say that was
[1:31:34] persecution on the church that's the
[1:31:36] start of it
[1:31:37] no my brother and sister it's the devil
[1:31:38] just trying to get you back in bondage
[1:31:42] the persecution hasn't started this is
[1:31:44] not the tribulation
[1:31:46] this is satan exercising his ability to
[1:31:48] get as many people as he can within his
[1:31:50] grip
[1:31:51] to get them in bondage because you see
[1:31:54] just oh i hope you follow this just see
[1:31:57] he's got to
[1:31:58] get them in the right atmosphere
[1:32:00] physically and
[1:32:01] mentally the right atmosphere for a
[1:32:04] tribulation
[1:32:06] but at the same time praise the lord
[1:32:07] don't you love this that god's always
[1:32:09] put a balance
[1:32:11] and at the same time satan's creating
[1:32:12] this atmosphere to get those people in a
[1:32:15] position for a tribulation
[1:32:17] there's a people over here getting in an
[1:32:19] atmosphere that their roots are being
[1:32:21] sawed off and sometimes we complain and
[1:32:23] whine and cry about our
[1:32:24] roots being sought off but god said look
[1:32:26] i'm not going to let you become bondage
[1:32:28] to this earth to laodicea to this
[1:32:32] world i won't let you i am your redeemer
[1:32:35] i'm your savior i'm your creator i'm
[1:32:37] your sacrifice i'm everything and i
[1:32:40] won't let you
[1:32:41] be bondage to this world i'm going to
[1:32:43] set you free from it
[1:32:46] oh hallelujah thank you lord and then
[1:32:48] when we finally catch that revelation
[1:32:51] what does it bring us rest
[1:32:54] amen when we stop and say you know what
[1:32:56] i see the hand of the lord in this
[1:32:58] amen i see god in it but look at this
[1:33:00] nothing's changed
[1:33:02] they'll say it's the economy oh it's the
[1:33:04] day that we live in
[1:33:05] it's just our morals it's a society it's
[1:33:07] just a new generation
[1:33:09] yes it's this yes it's that no my
[1:33:11] brother and sister it's not it's the
[1:33:12] devil
[1:33:14] amen it ain't just the economy it ain't
[1:33:16] just this it ain't just that it's the
[1:33:18] devil
[1:33:19] amen so look it's there the devil would
[1:33:22] come
[1:33:22] and he would give us now you say this
[1:33:24] sounds like this would apply to the
[1:33:26] preacher and it does but every one of
[1:33:27] you is a minister in your own home
[1:33:30] amen give us no time to study
[1:33:34] give us no time to worship now look my
[1:33:36] brother and sister i hope i don't skin
[1:33:38] anybody tonight i don't mean it
[1:33:40] but if you know a lot of times when
[1:33:42] people don't worship in church
[1:33:44] it's because they don't worship at home
[1:33:45] that's exactly right
[1:33:47] come on i'm just going to tell you the
[1:33:50] truth tonight okay
[1:33:52] and the reason we don't or can't worship
[1:33:54] in church is because we are not
[1:33:56] worshiping at home we're not worshiping
[1:33:58] in the car we're not worshiping in the
[1:34:00] kitchen the living room
[1:34:01] the garage the backyard whatever we're
[1:34:04] not doing that see satan's got some
[1:34:06] bondage on there
[1:34:07] and then we come to church and try to
[1:34:09] break through to enter into that
[1:34:11] no my brother and sister you'll break
[1:34:13] through and enter into that
[1:34:14] when you start worshiping in your
[1:34:16] private time
[1:34:17] amen when you start worshiping when no
[1:34:19] one's around
[1:34:21] you'll find you'll have liberty to
[1:34:22] worship when you're in church
[1:34:25] hallelujah amen and it won't be showing
[1:34:28] off it won't be i'm trying to get people
[1:34:29] to see me
[1:34:30] lift my hands and cry out to the lord it
[1:34:33] will be the natural response
[1:34:35] of the cycle of your life coming to pass
[1:34:38] that you won't be able to help yourself
[1:34:41] amen
[1:34:44] no time to read our bible
[1:34:48] now i won't go into this because it just
[1:34:50] seems like you get rough when you go
[1:34:52] into some of these things
[1:34:53] but my brother and sister i'll tell you
[1:34:56] well
[1:34:57] maybe i'll just go there kind of maybe
[1:34:59] i'll just kind of go kind of go there
[1:35:01] sort of half-heartedly go there
[1:35:04] do you know you can come home after a
[1:35:06] long day and you just get on social
[1:35:08] media and because you just kind of like
[1:35:09] to see what's going on the rest of the
[1:35:10] world
[1:35:12] and it goes from six to eight because
[1:35:15] somehow or another that thing on the
[1:35:17] ipad or whatever speeds up the clock
[1:35:22] now i'm not against that i i have made
[1:35:24] some pretty harsh statements about that
[1:35:26] kind of stuff
[1:35:26] but people have to do what they're going
[1:35:28] to do right i mean we're not nazis we're
[1:35:29] not going to go from house to house
[1:35:30] knock the door down see what you're
[1:35:32] doing
[1:35:33] but i'm telling you see satan will steal
[1:35:35] your time
[1:35:36] he'll wind that clock up faster than you
[1:35:39] ever thought and it'll be one moment
[1:35:40] it's there and next it's bedtime
[1:35:43] see he'll steal our time to read our
[1:35:45] bible but did you know i i have done
[1:35:48] this research
[1:35:51] me a great researcher
[1:35:55] when i don't read my bible
[1:35:59] all i see is what is wrong
[1:36:06] when i read my bible i see what is right
[1:36:11] even if it's wrong
[1:36:14] i recognize this must have come to pass
[1:36:18] amen we're not fighting against flesh
[1:36:20] and blood
[1:36:22] we're fighting against principalities
[1:36:24] and powers of darkness
[1:36:26] in what low places no high places
[1:36:29] in those in authority amen see it's what
[1:36:32] satan's trying to do
[1:36:34] but we don't come to a place that we
[1:36:36] read our bible
[1:36:37] then it it affects our life my brother
[1:36:39] and sister no time to pray
[1:36:41] now look there's no excuse there some of
[1:36:44] us are really busy
[1:36:45] okay i'm not i'm not digging on on on
[1:36:48] your lifestyle
[1:36:49] i'll let you deal with god on that some
[1:36:51] of us are really busy
[1:36:52] but the scripture says we can pray
[1:36:54] without ceasing
[1:36:56] amen now that i say this jokingly i
[1:36:58] remember brother saying this one time
[1:36:59] called everybody off guard
[1:37:01] said i just don't recommend you do that
[1:37:02] on the freeway
[1:37:04] well you know pray with your eyes closed
[1:37:08] but we can pray without ceasing things
[1:37:11] we can devote that time all day long
[1:37:14] lord
[1:37:14] i need you to speak to me lord i'm
[1:37:16] looking for this
[1:37:18] now look more they're wanting to lay
[1:37:21] upon it and he says let them not regard
[1:37:22] vain words in verse 9.
[1:37:24] you see what he was doing is trying to
[1:37:26] tell them
[1:37:27] that that these words have no real value
[1:37:30] they're idle they're worthless
[1:37:32] uh they're uh marked by futility
[1:37:35] ineffectiveness unsuccessful but my
[1:37:38] brother and sister
[1:37:39] what satan sees as vain words
[1:37:43] god sees a spoken word as prophecy
[1:37:49] when the word says this work that i have
[1:37:52] begun
[1:37:52] in you amen that was me
[1:37:55] i will finish i look at that
[1:37:58] it's done it's done i mean i might still
[1:38:01] have some problems in my life i might
[1:38:03] get a little bent out of shape here and
[1:38:05] whatever else but i look at that this
[1:38:07] work he began and me
[1:38:08] is finished praise the lord
[1:38:12] hallelujah i want to tie this together i
[1:38:13] i spoke last wednesday i just kind of
[1:38:16] from memory tried to give a little blip
[1:38:17] of a
[1:38:18] a quote talking about portions amen
[1:38:20] we'll tie that in on another wednesday
[1:38:22] my brother and sister you see god didn't
[1:38:24] just take us and take us out here as
[1:38:27] some old sinner
[1:38:28] and we say well god's working on me and
[1:38:30] i'm still working on this part and that
[1:38:32] part
[1:38:32] my brother and sister god does a
[1:38:33] complete deliverance amen we don't have
[1:38:36] to go for years settled well you know
[1:38:38] one of these days i'll be free of this
[1:38:40] god gives us liberty he sets us free
[1:38:43] when he washes a son or daughter of god
[1:38:46] he gets behind the ears behind the
[1:38:48] elbows whatever else he doesn't miss a
[1:38:50] single thing
[1:38:52] amen and he's kind of like my old
[1:38:54] grandma she'll say well it hurts today
[1:38:56] but it'll look better tomorrow i'm
[1:38:57] scrubbing your elbows
[1:38:59] amen now see the spoken word my brother
[1:39:03] and sister they're never vain words
[1:39:05] do you realize i've shared this story
[1:39:06] here in the church now my brother and
[1:39:08] sister
[1:39:09] there's a man i read a story about lives
[1:39:11] in the midwest i believe was oklahoma
[1:39:13] and the man doesn't go to church he
[1:39:14] believes in god but he just never goes
[1:39:16] to church and does whatever
[1:39:17] but somebody figured out that there's
[1:39:19] three churches in his small town
[1:39:21] that he gave tithe to all three of those
[1:39:23] churches somebody brings that up to him
[1:39:25] one day and says hey what is this that
[1:39:27] you do
[1:39:27] and the man says well here's the thing i
[1:39:29] was raised godly grandmother she
[1:39:31] belonged to this church over here
[1:39:33] and i seen how god stretched the economy
[1:39:36] of their household
[1:39:37] and she gave tithe even when they were
[1:39:39] poor and he said i grew up
[1:39:40] understanding that principle that you
[1:39:43] give to god god will give back to you
[1:39:45] and they said but you give money to all
[1:39:46] three churches he said that's right i
[1:39:48] don't belong to any one of the three
[1:39:50] but i figure if i give 10 to each one
[1:39:52] god will be good to me
[1:39:54] and there he was a
[1:39:55] multi-multi-millionaire and he
[1:39:57] attributed it
[1:39:58] entirely he didn't live a bad life he
[1:40:00] was talking about no i follow the
[1:40:01] premise of the bible
[1:40:03] i'm just not one of these guys that goes
[1:40:04] to a church but he he
[1:40:06] says my success is based on that right
[1:40:10] there
[1:40:11] because it's right here in the word
[1:40:14] took himself right back to the word he
[1:40:16] didn't take himself back to all of it
[1:40:17] but he took him back back to that
[1:40:19] portion
[1:40:19] and said you know what hey i want my
[1:40:22] barns to be full then i will give to god
[1:40:25] amen see satan sees it as vain's work
[1:40:30] amen but god sees it as prophetic word
[1:40:33] amen going to come to pass now look
[1:40:36] let me just jump ahead here a little
[1:40:39] further here
[1:40:44] the devil sure hates my brother and
[1:40:45] sister verse 17 he says you're idle
[1:40:48] you're idle therefore say let us go and
[1:40:50] do sacrifice to the lord
[1:40:51] see how the world looks differently we
[1:40:54] need time
[1:40:55] to serve god we need time saints can i
[1:40:58] say that again we need
[1:41:00] time to serve god you can't just throw a
[1:41:03] snippet of god in here and a snippet of
[1:41:05] god in there
[1:41:06] we need time to serve god
[1:41:10] god designed it that way from the very
[1:41:12] beginning the devil would say you're
[1:41:13] just a bunch of idol people
[1:41:15] and so therefore you're saying let's go
[1:41:17] and do sacrifice to the lord
[1:41:19] no the devil didn't figure that one out
[1:41:20] my brother and sister he figured out
[1:41:22] that a son or daughter of god
[1:41:24] will make time a son or daughter of god
[1:41:27] will
[1:41:27] make it so he can be in the house of god
[1:41:30] he'll make it so he can serve
[1:41:32] god hallelujah amen oh
[1:41:35] she sure hates it you know when you take
[1:41:37] time to pray
[1:41:38] he sure hates it when you take time to
[1:41:40] read your bible he sure hates it when
[1:41:42] you take time to ponder stop meditate on
[1:41:44] the word of god
[1:41:46] and he hates it my brother and sister
[1:41:48] when we don't have time to fellowship
[1:41:50] that's right sometimes we just need to
[1:41:52] rub shoulders with another son or
[1:41:54] daughter of god we need to
[1:41:55] have someone and find ourselves you know
[1:41:57] this is so funny
[1:41:58] at a pastor we're going to close here in
[1:42:00] just a second i had a pastor that called
[1:42:02] me here a while back and
[1:42:03] he's a little discouraged and he said
[1:42:05] brother paul how do you feel about this
[1:42:06] and we started talking
[1:42:08] and and you know i started speaking to
[1:42:10] him and and
[1:42:11] uh uh he goes man i've never thought
[1:42:14] about it that way
[1:42:15] brother paul thank you so much and god
[1:42:17] was good you know the week didn't pass
[1:42:19] out
[1:42:20] i had to apply the very words i spoke to
[1:42:22] him by inspiration right back to my own
[1:42:24] life
[1:42:25] and i had to stop and say now i either
[1:42:28] have to call him up and apologize for
[1:42:30] being a hypocrite
[1:42:31] or i've got to follow this
[1:42:34] and you know it was way easier just to
[1:42:36] follow it than it was to make a phone
[1:42:38] call and say i'm a hypocrite
[1:42:41] come on saints it's good
[1:42:46] we need that fellowship we weren't made
[1:42:48] to live alone
[1:42:50] now in the interval amen
[1:42:53] look at this i want to just close with
[1:42:56] this if you guys would be gracious
[1:42:57] enough give me that time
[1:43:01] amen amen i want this thing
[1:43:05] to appear there i think vika might need
[1:43:09] some help
[1:43:15] hallelujah i want you to read this
[1:43:19] awesome awesome
[1:43:22] a few nights ago i was called to an
[1:43:24] emergency call of a young lady dying at
[1:43:26] the clark county memorial hospital
[1:43:28] she'd had been a member up at a time the
[1:43:31] tabernacle where i used to pastor years
[1:43:33] ago
[1:43:33] and i went into this young lady to talk
[1:43:35] to her and she was under oxygen i said
[1:43:37] they tell me you used to come to the
[1:43:38] tabernacle she said yes brother branham
[1:43:40] i did
[1:43:41] i said do you realize you're dying she
[1:43:42] said i do brother branham
[1:43:44] said she was a mother of one child if
[1:43:46] she's 19 20 years old
[1:43:48] had a four-month baby adults can read
[1:43:50] between the lines understand she'd taken
[1:43:52] uremic poisoning
[1:43:53] and also many things there wasn't one
[1:43:55] thing that doctors could do
[1:43:56] but lay her back and wait for death
[1:43:59] that's all nothing could be done for her
[1:44:00] in the medical science
[1:44:02] and she was going out to meet god just a
[1:44:04] child
[1:44:05] and i said sister do you remember on the
[1:44:06] cradle roll you were baptized in the
[1:44:08] fellowship on the cradle roll
[1:44:10] i said what was the matter she said
[1:44:11] brother branham i tell you
[1:44:17] how many people are right here yes sir
[1:44:21] i still love the lord jesus
[1:44:24] but i find it so hard to serve him
[1:44:28] amen oh my god
[1:44:32] now that is what i find around most
[1:44:35] christian lives most i hate to say it
[1:44:37] that way but it's true
[1:44:39] most people can profess christianity
[1:44:41] they seem to have such a hard
[1:44:43] struggling time to hold on i believe oh
[1:44:46] get this now saints
[1:44:48] come on saints let's get this it wasn't
[1:44:51] the individual this is a prophet of god
[1:44:55] amen i believe we are message church
[1:44:57] aren't we believe god give him
[1:44:58] inspiration to speak these things
[1:45:00] it isn't this individual over here oh
[1:45:03] sometimes we're just like this person
[1:45:04] ain't got it right and
[1:45:05] it's too bad that's a shame over there
[1:45:07] but look what the prophet of god says
[1:45:09] i believe it's because of lack of
[1:45:11] correct teaching of the bible
[1:45:14] where does that come back that comes
[1:45:15] back right here
[1:45:17] amen might have come back to mama and
[1:45:19] daddy not taking time to
[1:45:21] to have an altar in their home and teach
[1:45:23] their child but still it comes back
[1:45:25] right here to a degree
[1:45:27] hallelujah lack of good teaching correct
[1:45:30] teaching of the bible
[1:45:32] there's no such thing as holding on he
[1:45:35] done the holding on hallelujah i don't
[1:45:38] care what age you are you say i've been
[1:45:40] serving the lord faithfully for 50 years
[1:45:42] you're not the one doing the holding on
[1:45:43] he's doing the holding on
[1:45:45] hallelujah amen the whole christian
[1:45:49] principle is based upon rest come unto
[1:45:52] me all ye that labor in heavy laden
[1:45:54] i will give you rest we won't find it
[1:45:58] saints
[1:45:58] he'll be there giving it to us
[1:46:02] hallelujah you don't have to worry and
[1:46:04] struggle
[1:46:05] you're just resting that's all given
[1:46:08] rest you enter in
[1:46:09] to peace look at the connection
[1:46:12] this is deeper my brother and sister he
[1:46:14] didn't put it in big bold letters he
[1:46:16] didn't shout it to the heavens
[1:46:17] but given rest
[1:46:21] you enter into peace
[1:46:24] no wonder satan's got us running here
[1:46:26] and worrying about this and running
[1:46:27] there and worrying about this and going
[1:46:29] and going and going and going
[1:46:30] what's happening with the church what's
[1:46:31] happening to this what's happening there
[1:46:33] my brother and sister it's time for us
[1:46:34] to stop and say lord
[1:46:36] you are in control amen i'm resting on
[1:46:39] the promise of your word lord you are in
[1:46:41] control
[1:46:43] amen and then all of a sudden you start
[1:46:45] to have some peace
[1:46:47] about your circumstance
[1:46:50] that's the whole thing's finished oh
[1:46:54] give and rest you enter into peace that
[1:46:57] the whole thing's
[1:46:58] finished them who he has called he has
[1:47:02] justified
[1:47:03] those he has justified he has already
[1:47:07] glorified brother brown then says
[1:47:11] scripture quoting hallelujah
[1:47:15] can i have just another moment or two
[1:47:18] amen i'm sorry i'm turning into a
[1:47:20] long-winded preacher
[1:47:22] or maybe i always was and it's just
[1:47:23] coming out now
[1:47:25] or sometime in the past
[1:47:29] why are people so tossed about
[1:47:32] that would be an interesting question
[1:47:33] wouldn't it why are people that's it
[1:47:36] so tossed about
[1:47:39] amen
[1:47:42] the christian faith is based solidly
[1:47:45] upon rest that's right
[1:47:47] a christian is not tossed about
[1:47:51] a christian doesn't run from place to
[1:47:52] place a christian doesn't fuss and fume
[1:47:55] and worry about things a christian
[1:47:58] rests it's all over it's all finished
[1:48:01] for the believer at calvary that's right
[1:48:04] oh sickness may come in disappointments
[1:48:06] but the christian is at rest knowing
[1:48:08] this that god is able to keep that which
[1:48:10] he has performed
[1:48:12] knowing that no matter what the thing is
[1:48:14] and how it looks
