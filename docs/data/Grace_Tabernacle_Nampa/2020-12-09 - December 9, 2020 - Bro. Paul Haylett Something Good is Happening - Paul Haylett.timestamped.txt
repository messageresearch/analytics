[36:19] as i was
[36:20] thinking after brother jason had come
[36:22] out there's you know many
[36:24] that are not here tonight whether the
[36:26] brother vasily
[36:27] or the sergey out on the road or the bob
[36:31] sister joanne at home and others that
[36:33] would be at home
[36:35] our daughter joe lynn didn't go to work
[36:38] today
[36:39] under the weather and you know just
[36:41] little normal
[36:42] winter sniffles and whatever amen
[36:46] is that or it's the second round of
[36:47] coven um
[36:50] but um we're not worried about that
[36:51] either right hallelujah amen
[36:54] so we just thank the lord for his grace
[36:57] and his mercy and his guiding hand
[36:59] tonight i want to uh just speak to you
[37:02] under the title something good
[37:04] is happening and uh i just pray you know
[37:08] i just kind of have went back through
[37:10] different things we've spoke on in the
[37:12] last few months and
[37:13] things a little inspiration to my heart
[37:16] uh just to look at this and so if it
[37:19] seems like some of these things
[37:20] are you know brother paul's just on the
[37:22] same vein he maybe was three months ago
[37:25] well i think they call it a recap amen
[37:28] we're coming down to the year of 2020.
[37:31] and um you know 2020 my brother and
[37:34] sister the whole world is telling us how
[37:36] terrible the year 2020 was
[37:41] that was all a matter of your
[37:42] perspective
[37:45] see you can look at that and say you
[37:47] know what
[37:48] we are a year closer
[37:53] to the marriage supper of the lamb
[37:57] we're a year closer today we get to
[38:00] stand before the throne of almighty god
[38:03] and worship him beyond what would be
[38:06] human endurance
[38:08] have you ever thought about that worship
[38:10] god there's no clock
[38:12] your body's not going to go my i need to
[38:15] set down
[38:15] i am tired i had a hard day today
[38:21] no we're a day closer a year
[38:24] closer to just standing there on that
[38:28] sea of crystal before the throne of god
[38:31] and just pouring our hearts out and
[38:33] saying thank you lord
[38:35] amen you know the song i think the
[38:38] lafontaine
[38:39] sing that one are you she
[38:42] my brother and sister i don't think that
[38:44] we as humans will comprehend what it is
[38:48] not of what we have done but what he
[38:51] used us
[38:52] for when you think of talents
[38:57] and the ones that were given talents and
[38:58] what they did with them and one was
[39:00] given talent i want you to take
[39:02] talent now not in the terms
[39:05] of a weight of silver or gold
[39:08] but i want you to take it in the term
[39:11] of talent amen what god
[39:15] give you for ability
[39:19] you see they were those who took their
[39:21] talent and
[39:22] brought back those offerings to god
[39:26] and one said i don't have enough talent
[39:30] now i might be talking to those that
[39:31] never sing a special
[39:33] but i might not be either you see our
[39:37] talent might not be to sing but it might
[39:39] be a talent just simply
[39:41] to live the liberty of this gospel
[39:45] your talent might be that you just
[39:47] wholeheartedly grabble holds of the word
[39:49] of god
[39:50] and your life then expresses a great
[39:53] testimony to man
[39:56] that you're a real christian amen
[40:00] let's not bring our talent back to him
[40:02] though that's right and say i was afraid
[40:05] to do anything
[40:07] amen i was afraid to step out i was
[40:10] afraid to i thought my
[40:12] you know unless they you you know saints
[40:14] i say this in a bit of humor brother jay
[40:17] kind of chides me every once in a while
[40:19] on this
[40:20] but you know what i don't care what the
[40:22] song is i can convert it to
[40:24] f
[40:27] and you guys laugh and i i have no
[40:29] problem with that
[40:31] but you see you say
[40:34] c or d or whatever and i don't have a
[40:37] clue what you're talking
[40:38] about so i have to make a decision am i
[40:41] going to sing
[40:42] or because i don't know what d is
[40:46] i'm going to be silent no sir
[40:49] my talent i say this humorously my
[40:52] talent is convert every song to f
[40:55] and i don't know what f is
[40:58] but it's where i it's what i can sing
[41:00] it's what my
[41:01] my ability takes me to
[41:05] and see we have to decide i hope you see
[41:08] where i'm going you have to decide
[41:10] well i i can't do this as well as they
[41:12] do i can't do this as well as they do i
[41:15] i'm gonna do it the talent god give me
[41:19] was to say amen to the word
[41:21] to pull that word in and feed on it
[41:24] and and so i don't do it as well as this
[41:27] one or do it as well as that one or
[41:29] look as good you know reminds me one
[41:32] time it was kind of a
[41:34] a um not an insult it was never meant
[41:37] that way but it did
[41:38] strike pretty hard you know we were
[41:40] visiting a church once and there was two
[41:42] brothers there that had the exact
[41:45] they were actually a a combo that was
[41:47] like at macy's you know the shirt came
[41:49] with the tie
[41:50] and on a sunday morning here is two
[41:52] brothers
[41:53] standing there with the exact same shirt
[41:56] and the exact same tie
[41:58] and uh the one sister i think she had
[42:01] just a little bit of
[42:02] something in her and she looks over her
[42:05] husband and says it doesn't look as good
[42:07] on you as it does on him
[42:15] but you see it it's not an earthly
[42:18] comparison that we're looking for
[42:20] we're not trying to be measured against
[42:22] this one or measured against that one
[42:25] we want to be measured against the word
[42:27] of god and let the word shine through
[42:30] and let the word reflect in us what god
[42:33] desired to reflect
[42:35] something good is happening let's just
[42:37] stand and go into the word
[42:39] let's just make sure that we lift up one
[42:42] another
[42:43] um and the day that we're living in my
[42:45] brother and sister
[42:47] there's just the devil is absolutely out
[42:50] roaring and um some of the things that
[42:53] uh
[42:54] you look at you hear you study you're
[42:57] just like
[42:58] someone with good sense how could they
[43:01] even
[43:02] possibly think those thoughts how can
[43:04] they come to that conclusion
[43:07] and then we're reminded that the word
[43:10] says he would give us a sound mind
[43:13] so that means someone has to have an
[43:15] unsound
[43:16] mind
[43:21] we're not dinging on anybody we're not
[43:23] doing this my brother and sister
[43:27] let's just look at the natural sister
[43:28] sue not here tonight just remember her
[43:30] brother
[43:31] in prayer a long history goes there but
[43:34] got his medical license revoked in the
[43:36] state of oregon because he stood up and
[43:38] said you don't need a mask
[43:40] it won't work and they just
[43:43] make an example out of him
[43:48] sound mind no i'm sorry
[43:52] you read testimony after testimony
[43:54] people i washed my hands 15 times a day
[43:57] i wore a mask
[43:58] never walked out of my house my husband
[44:00] worked from home
[44:01] and uh we never did this i wore my mask
[44:04] in the car i wore it
[44:05] everywhere i went and i did everything
[44:08] and our family has coven
[44:11] well let me tell you i did drywall
[44:14] brother adam and i had this conversation
[44:17] you just put one of those cheap masks on
[44:19] your face and go sand drywall
[44:21] take the mask off amen i'm sure brother
[44:23] gideon can testify of these things
[44:26] your face will be white and that's just
[44:29] drywall dust
[44:30] amen you see sound mind
[44:34] but you see it's fear rip them not a
[44:37] sound mind
[44:38] a sound mind they'd stand up and say you
[44:40] know what we're just gonna stand with
[44:42] confidence this will work
[44:44] but no fear has overcome them and
[44:47] my brother and sister the fear that you
[44:50] were seeing natural
[44:51] the prophet of god told us there's
[44:53] always a spiritual attribute
[44:55] with it let's turn in our bibles tonight
[44:58] to hebrews 11
[45:00] and 38. brother alex did you get the
[45:04] church whatsapp i sent that has a little
[45:06] video on it
[45:07] would you look at your phone
[45:10] i'm just going to ask you if there's any
[45:12] possible way that you can
[45:14] send that to our deal and after some
[45:17] point here projected on the screen
[45:19] i know we've done it before but i
[45:21] wouldn't have a clue how
[45:23] but uh hebrews 11 38 through 40 very
[45:26] common scripture to us saints
[45:29] amen of whom the world was not worthy
[45:33] that statement is still applicable
[45:37] they wandered in deserts and in
[45:39] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[45:41] earth
[45:42] and these all having obtained a good
[45:44] report through faith
[45:46] receive not the promise god having
[45:49] provided some better thing
[45:51] for us that they without us should not
[45:54] be made
[45:55] perfect heavenly father we ask you lord
[45:58] for
[45:59] blessings upon your word tonight father
[46:01] just ask you to lead us guide us let us
[46:03] speak only according to thy word
[46:06] lord may the full effect lord of your
[46:09] word move amongst your saints tonight
[46:12] lord i i believe sometimes uh not even
[46:15] sometimes lord i believe most of the
[46:17] time
[46:18] we miss the full effect of your word
[46:22] oh lord help us to be open lord in
[46:25] receiving of you
[46:27] lord the spirits have already been bound
[46:29] we'll stand upon that confession of our
[46:32] brother david
[46:33] lord that you'll come and move with
[46:35] liberty tonight in the name of jesus
[46:37] christ
[46:38] amen you may be seated
[46:44] you know as we look at this scripture we
[46:46] have read it
[46:47] uh my so so many times we've preached on
[46:51] it
[46:52] and uh we look at this and realize uh
[46:55] the very depth of this word i i believe
[46:57] my brother and sister
[46:59] has still missed we have missed just a
[47:02] little bit
[47:02] of that and uh as we look at this i i
[47:06] read and you no doubt read of the saints
[47:08] of the ages and when i read of it i'm
[47:11] always in awe because you
[47:13] you read these as it were we'll call
[47:15] them stories uh
[47:16] and and you see what the saints are what
[47:19] they went through
[47:21] uh and what god used them to accomplish
[47:24] and it is tremendous and when we look at
[47:27] that my brother and sister it's
[47:29] easy for us to actually look back
[47:33] and say my look what they did
[47:37] but you see what we need to do is be
[47:39] looking right now because the word
[47:42] shows us and our lord jesus spoke these
[47:44] words out that said we would do
[47:47] greater things than that
[47:50] now we're not looking as it is to have a
[47:53] checklist of
[47:54] we did this we did this we did this
[47:57] it's talking about our day-to-day life
[48:01] amen and there will be my brother and
[48:03] sister
[48:04] such a joy such a pleasure
[48:07] that it is to be sons and daughters of
[48:10] god
[48:11] not that we have accomplished or we have
[48:14] obtained as the apostle paul said
[48:16] not as though we have obtained it but
[48:19] yet we
[48:20] are here knowing with confidence we are
[48:22] a part of it
[48:24] amen it's not as though we must uh say
[48:26] you know brother david did this now i
[48:28] need to
[48:29] you know they call it one upmanship
[48:32] right
[48:33] now you know we do these kind of things
[48:35] oh my i caught this fish and
[48:37] and it we can't help it and be totally
[48:39] honest you know it's a real thing it's
[48:41] not a fish story
[48:42] you know like i was up there and i
[48:43] caught this fish and and you know you
[48:46] you just can't help yourself it's like i
[48:47] caught a bigger one
[48:50] it's just a human element but see we're
[48:53] not here to look back on the saints of
[48:56] old and say you know what
[48:57] we're going to do greater things as
[49:00] brother branham
[49:01] encourager shows us it would be more
[49:03] things
[49:04] we're not here to keep a score and and
[49:06] to place ourselves in a position see
[49:09] we're doing this but to just live
[49:12] naturally
[49:13] and have a joy of our salvation and a
[49:16] thrill to
[49:17] to be sons and daughters of god and i
[49:20] think sometimes you know as the
[49:21] scripture says to
[49:23] not be weary and well doing satan knows
[49:26] that's why the word reminded us
[49:28] to to not become weary because satan
[49:30] knows he can just keep grinding and
[49:32] grinding and grinding
[49:34] and we come to a place that the labors
[49:36] of life overwhelm us
[49:38] and we find ourselves and now i'm not
[49:40] chiding you tonight church i'm just
[49:42] speaking
[49:42] that we would come to church and there's
[49:45] not an enthusiasm in there because the
[49:48] laborers of the day
[49:49] i'm so guilty i'll lift my hands amen
[49:52] i'm so guilty but we must come to a
[49:56] place that the things of this
[49:58] life do not control us
[50:01] amen we'll kind of touch on this now i
[50:03] want to share a little video
[50:06] amen that that was shared with me uh
[50:09] by some brothers amen this is in
[50:11] zimbabwe
[50:13] and you know it's uh just an amazing
[50:15] thing my brother and sister
[50:17] to see a real joy you know what this joy
[50:19] is about
[50:20] they receive some bibles amen they had a
[50:24] whole
[50:24] shipment a whole a pallet as it were of
[50:27] bibles that was given and come into
[50:29] their area of zimbabwe
[50:31] and was given to them now if brother
[50:33] alex will just click on that
[50:35] i just want you to see what some joy of
[50:38] having a bible is
[50:45] [Music]
[50:53] i want to bottle that and bring it home
[50:57] better yet i want to find my quiet place
[51:01] and have that joy of my salvation
[51:04] renewed to where
[51:05] just to lay our hands in this same
[51:09] region
[51:10] a brother will leave it unnamed but a
[51:12] brother is doing a work there they've
[51:14] shipped
[51:16] pallets hundreds hundreds and hundreds
[51:19] of
[51:20] church age books in their languages have
[51:22] been delivered to them placed in their
[51:24] hands
[51:25] and the enthusiasm and the joy that
[51:27] these believers are expressing my
[51:30] brother and sister
[51:31] i think we ought to stop and reevaluate
[51:33] what our life is
[51:35] i'm preaching to myself okay so you
[51:37] can't be offended because paul's talking
[51:39] to paul
[51:40] but we're worried about whether our
[51:41] shoes are are just right and our clothes
[51:44] are just right
[51:45] and you know whether hey you know i wore
[51:47] this dress
[51:48] uh two sundays ago and now i wore
[51:51] something else last sunday if i wear it
[51:52] this sunday will they notice
[51:55] we are not even care about such things
[51:58] amen hallelujah we could have a sister's
[52:01] only sermon on that
[52:07] oh come on sisters have a sense of humor
[52:12] come on remember brother branham said if
[52:16] you're a real believer you can't be
[52:17] offended
[52:20] but you see my brother and sister as we
[52:22] read of the saints of
[52:23] old there was a thrill there was an
[52:26] excitement
[52:27] as they were coming and the word was
[52:29] being presented to them and
[52:31] and they were becoming converts to
[52:33] christ we see
[52:34] something was happening that overwhelmed
[52:37] them
[52:38] and we see you know peter be an example
[52:41] as jesus speak to him and says you know
[52:44] before this time
[52:46] uh uh you know at the time that the
[52:48] crows
[52:49] you know you're going to have denied me
[52:51] and peter never thought that was
[52:53] possible
[52:54] but he was there in that time and as
[52:56] that young maid
[52:58] says now i i perceive by your
[53:01] clothing your words and everything you
[53:03] know you've been
[53:04] seen with them you're this and he denies
[53:07] it and the crows
[53:08] and peter is stricken in his heart
[53:12] so he quit church and moved to a
[53:15] backside of a desert and
[53:19] no that was something inside of him
[53:23] something so great that even
[53:26] his own betrayal was not
[53:30] sufficient to get him to stop
[53:34] now when i use that word betrayal you
[53:36] understand in what context i bring that
[53:39] but you see even facing himself in that
[53:42] bitter moment
[53:44] knowing that exactly what our lord jesus
[53:46] had spoken to him had come to pass
[53:48] against every bit of his will
[53:56] but behind those words the power
[54:00] of our lord jesus giving the keys
[54:04] to peter overrode
[54:07] peter's flesh that ought to be enough
[54:11] for us to say
[54:12] thank you lord the promise of the word
[54:16] overrode the weakness of the flesh
[54:21] and peter rose up after many bitter
[54:24] tears
[54:25] and went right back to fulfill the very
[54:27] commission
[54:29] or talent that he was given
[54:32] i think in awe of what they
[54:36] experienced can you imagine as it were
[54:39] to be a bystander
[54:44] when jesus told them to push their boat
[54:47] out
[54:48] and cast the net off the other side to
[54:51] be the bystander
[54:52] that knew that the whole fleet as it
[54:54] were
[54:56] a fisherman were not finding fish
[55:01] the reason is the holy spirit went out
[55:02] and rounded them all up and put them in
[55:04] one part of the lake
[55:06] you know what i'm saying god said i'm
[55:08] going to hold them in reserve because
[55:11] i'm not going to
[55:12] just let it be they caught a few i'm
[55:14] going to have something
[55:15] happen here that will bring a maze to
[55:18] the people
[55:20] and so the witnesses that saw that and
[55:22] he tells them
[55:23] push it out a little bit and cast your
[55:26] net on the other side
[55:28] and my brother and sister those fish
[55:30] under that anointing
[55:31] swam for that net they didn't have to
[55:34] drag the net around
[55:35] that boat was stationary and those fish
[55:38] swam
[55:38] to that under the anointing of what they
[55:41] had to fulfill
[55:43] and all nature will fulfill the word of
[55:45] god
[55:46] amen and so we see what is happening
[55:48] here this supernatural effect and we
[55:51] look back and say oh
[55:52] lord we would love to have something
[55:55] like that happen it is
[55:58] it is
[56:01] right happening it can happen in our
[56:03] house it can happen in our church
[56:06] we have to set the atmosphere for it
[56:09] but remember the holy spirit the prophet
[56:11] of god said
[56:12] is a dove he's a gentleman and we have
[56:15] to create an atmosphere that he says
[56:18] this is where i want to be
[56:20] amen we think of what they experience
[56:23] and how they became reference points for
[56:26] us
[56:27] have you ever used someone as an
[56:28] individual as a reference point
[56:31] i'll just tell this in the natural many
[56:33] years ago
[56:35] as i i started farming on my own
[56:38] i had more i don't know if it was
[56:42] courage
[56:42] just desire and ability
[56:46] to take a risk and it didn't take very
[56:49] long for me to realize there were
[56:50] farmers around me
[56:52] that were growing much better crops than
[56:54] me
[56:56] you've heard the phrase flattering
[56:59] amen
[57:02] copying someone is a highest form
[57:05] of flattery i wanted to
[57:09] succeed i wanted to survive so i started
[57:12] as it were looking over the fence what
[57:13] are they doing different than me
[57:18] and you know it wasn't great big things
[57:21] it didn't matter what color their
[57:22] tractor was or how new it was
[57:25] it was what they were doing not as it
[57:28] were
[57:28] what they were doing it with yes
[57:35] i heard a man say one time i so respect
[57:37] brother so and so
[57:39] he's just the most solid christian
[57:42] that i know
[57:45] i believe god ordained this i heard
[57:47] another brother says i don't know anyone
[57:49] who prays
[57:50] as much as this brother this
[57:54] one was looking up to the brother in awe
[57:56] because he was the most solid christian
[57:58] he knew
[57:59] but then the ingredient of how he was
[58:02] the most solid christian
[58:04] was revealed amen and so as you were
[58:07] there
[58:08] if we would have a form of flattery
[58:11] let us look to those that are the solid
[58:13] believer
[58:14] not the man find what they're doing
[58:18] because you see each and every one of us
[58:20] possesses the ability
[58:23] amen we possess the ability
[58:28] but we must let it come to pass
[58:31] they become reference points the
[58:33] believers these saints
[58:35] i say today lord let us become a
[58:37] reference point for someone else
[58:39] amen this is not boastful this is not us
[58:41] claiming some
[58:42] some position that's unattainable but
[58:45] lord just
[58:46] anoint us to live a life that becomes
[58:49] a reference point amen
[58:53] to the positive amen
[58:57] look at the sacrifices that we they made
[59:00] you look down through the scripture and
[59:02] and you just read and understand
[59:05] all of the sacrifice that was made by
[59:08] the saints through the ages
[59:10] they they just tremendous the scripture
[59:13] tells us they were sundered
[59:15] thrown in the flames and fed to the wild
[59:17] animals and
[59:18] they were starved and abandoned in the
[59:21] dungeons and
[59:22] all of these things that we just look at
[59:24] that and it's hard in our mind
[59:26] to comprehend what they went through
[59:32] think of the apostle paul how long he
[59:34] languished isn't this terrible he
[59:36] languished in prison
[59:38] for such an extended period of time
[59:41] except for we're thankful
[59:42] for his writings that took place in
[59:45] prison
[59:46] when there was no other distraction and
[59:48] nothing else to focus on
[59:50] but to have a prayer life and open up
[59:52] and receive from god
[59:54] and to pin it
[59:55] [Music]
[59:57] i think when we get there we'll need to
[59:59] go say thank you paul for your sacrifice
[1:00:03] and when it was done and god said this
[1:00:05] is finished they took him out and
[1:00:06] beheaded him
[1:00:09] doesn't seem like a worthy finish for a
[1:00:12] man who laid the gospels before us
[1:00:16] but when we get there he'll be shouting
[1:00:17] hallelujah just like the rest
[1:00:21] amen think about what they've done
[1:00:24] saints
[1:00:25] think about this sacrifice that was made
[1:00:30] and you know when you read that uh it's
[1:00:33] just so real
[1:00:34] hey man i hope it is that real to you
[1:00:36] that you just
[1:00:37] you you just don't you don't have to
[1:00:39] have a hollywood makeup of this just in
[1:00:42] your heart you see how real it was
[1:00:44] as believers they placed the words so
[1:00:48] firmly before them that there was
[1:00:50] nothing going to draw them to the right
[1:00:52] or to the left
[1:00:54] nothing could be offered in them to them
[1:00:57] amen
[1:00:58] it was so real i don't you know there
[1:01:01] was nothing could be offered to them
[1:01:03] that they would say i want to trade this
[1:01:05] experience
[1:01:06] for this here
[1:01:09] there was nothing there you see if it
[1:01:11] had been possible
[1:01:12] satan would have anointed them to be
[1:01:15] offered
[1:01:16] see even judas in his betrayal
[1:01:20] i was just reading those scriptures and
[1:01:23] how jesus
[1:01:24] i don't know if the modern church could
[1:01:26] handle jesus sitting across the table
[1:01:28] from us
[1:01:30] he looked right out here the one who's
[1:01:33] going to betray me is
[1:01:34] whose hand is on the table with me now i
[1:01:38] freeze time pause let's look down the
[1:01:41] table
[1:01:42] no hands no hands no hands hands
[1:01:46] no hands no hands no hands and they
[1:01:49] all the scripture says started to
[1:01:51] examine themselves in question
[1:01:52] is it i is it i but you see
[1:01:56] the word had already declared this
[1:01:58] symbolism as it were
[1:01:59] of who the betrayer was he's the one
[1:02:02] who's taking sop with me now
[1:02:05] and you look and i just i'm not trying
[1:02:07] to make a huge point but
[1:02:08] you look at this how simple it came down
[1:02:11] that pause whose hand
[1:02:15] was on the table dipping
[1:02:19] their bread at that moment and jesus
[1:02:22] spoke that out
[1:02:23] so blunt that anyone could see
[1:02:29] i wonder sometimes why didn't our lord
[1:02:31] jesus just say
[1:02:33] for all of you to know judas is the
[1:02:35] betrayer
[1:02:37] but you see he had to let the word be
[1:02:40] fulfilled
[1:02:41] it had to come about he had to let
[1:02:44] every detail of the revelation
[1:02:48] come forth and here we are today my
[1:02:50] brother and sister
[1:02:51] and not to go back and dig into these
[1:02:53] things of of
[1:02:54] uh the seventh seal and uh some turmoil
[1:02:56] we've had here in the church
[1:02:58] but you know you read your bible and it
[1:03:00] says these things
[1:03:01] have to be revealed these things must be
[1:03:04] manifest
[1:03:04] we can't skirt that we can't step beyond
[1:03:07] that
[1:03:08] we can't push it off in the future it's
[1:03:10] god who's in control of that
[1:03:13] amen and we have to let those things
[1:03:15] come so that they will be played out
[1:03:17] according to the script that god has
[1:03:21] written
[1:03:22] aren't you glad tonight because you see
[1:03:25] we've been identified in that script
[1:03:28] amen we don't have to go on as it might
[1:03:31] be for years now wondering wondering
[1:03:33] wondering wondering
[1:03:34] amen we can stand tonight and say i'm so
[1:03:37] glad i'm one of them
[1:03:39] because that revelation of that word has
[1:03:43] come forth what is it doing it's
[1:03:44] bringing
[1:03:45] forth this bride who is a viable
[1:03:49] and and i cut this out i didn't bring it
[1:03:51] forth tonight uh we will lord willing
[1:03:53] here soon
[1:03:54] but my brother and sister i'll just give
[1:03:55] you a glimpse of this when brother
[1:03:57] branham's talking
[1:03:58] about every seed about mankind being
[1:04:01] brought forth
[1:04:02] after the image of god brother branham
[1:04:04] says they're a seed
[1:04:06] of the word amen oh think about that
[1:04:09] it's you we know this it's a you might
[1:04:11] say a kind of
[1:04:13] recap hallelujah but you see when we
[1:04:16] recognize you're a seed of the word
[1:04:18] but the word's got to be planted see god
[1:04:20] don't circumvent that
[1:04:21] god doesn't circumvent that amen that
[1:04:24] seed has to be planted that seed has to
[1:04:26] be water
[1:04:26] that seed has to have sunlight that seed
[1:04:29] has to have revelation
[1:04:30] that seed has to be placed in an
[1:04:32] atmosphere and god said you know nope
[1:04:34] i'm not going to take you
[1:04:35] fast forward from here to there even the
[1:04:38] 11th hour worker people are like well
[1:04:40] god gave advantage to 11th hour worker
[1:04:42] no my brother and sister i'll tell you
[1:04:44] what the 11th hour worker had
[1:04:45] he had the example or the reference
[1:04:49] point
[1:04:51] are you with me they hear the word
[1:04:55] brother role soriano just shared a text
[1:04:59] a whole church there in the philippines
[1:05:00] been witnessing to the ministry in the
[1:05:03] church the pastor of the church
[1:05:05] and that pastor received the message of
[1:05:07] the hour
[1:05:09] and it would be if i understood the text
[1:05:11] correctly this coming sunday
[1:05:13] they're baptizing all of the ministry in
[1:05:15] that church
[1:05:16] and the whole church has received the
[1:05:19] lord jesus christ
[1:05:22] now my brother and sister this is a late
[1:05:24] hour
[1:05:25] no doubt god could have called them in
[1:05:27] many years ago but i'll tell you what
[1:05:28] you'll do
[1:05:29] you'll find that they will mature so
[1:05:31] quickly
[1:05:33] they will mature so quickly according to
[1:05:36] the word
[1:05:36] the 11th hour worker but you know why
[1:05:38] they can mature so quickly
[1:05:41] oh because there's more word they were
[1:05:43] ordained no god uses patterns my brother
[1:05:46] and sister
[1:05:46] it's because they now have reference
[1:05:48] points that they can look and when they
[1:05:50] have a question they can say brother
[1:05:52] we don't understand this and brother
[1:05:54] from experience many hours of prayer
[1:05:56] praying for revelation can now come not
[1:05:59] in an intellectual way
[1:06:00] but come and open the word to them and
[1:06:04] what would took many years for to come
[1:06:06] to pass for you and i
[1:06:07] they will grasp it i say thank you lord
[1:06:11] amen it's not a shortcut my brother and
[1:06:13] sister god did not give them a shortcut
[1:06:16] they must repent they must be filled
[1:06:18] with the holy ghost they must pray for
[1:06:20] revelation
[1:06:21] they must lay hold on the word feed on
[1:06:24] the word but they will because they're
[1:06:26] part of the plan of god
[1:06:29] oh my thank you lord
[1:06:32] so look at this we recognize that
[1:06:35] just without a doubt they would not
[1:06:38] exchange that for another experience
[1:06:40] and i would say tonight i believe with
[1:06:42] all my heart and i trust that tonight
[1:06:44] this word of god our lord jesus christ
[1:06:46] is so real to us
[1:06:48] that there would be nothing here that we
[1:06:49] would exchange it for
[1:06:52] nothing on this this earth here that we
[1:06:54] would
[1:06:55] exchange that experience for
[1:06:58] now i'm telling you my brother and
[1:07:00] sister we've seen
[1:07:01] we've seen people with talents and i'm
[1:07:03] not speaking against people with talents
[1:07:06] but we've seen people with talents and
[1:07:08] i'll i'll take it back out of
[1:07:10] the present tense message and take it
[1:07:13] back into what brother branham said
[1:07:15] and look the list go through the message
[1:07:17] look at the list
[1:07:18] of those people that brother branham
[1:07:21] said
[1:07:21] now that gift that he had was from god
[1:07:24] but he sold it out for a fleet of
[1:07:26] cadillacs
[1:07:28] they had a gift but they sold it out for
[1:07:30] popularity
[1:07:33] hallelujah well i got something i want
[1:07:36] to sell out to
[1:07:38] but this world can't supply it amazon
[1:07:41] don't got it walmart don't got it
[1:07:44] it's not even on back order because they
[1:07:45] don't know nothing about it
[1:07:48] amen hallelujah
[1:07:51] now look at this in the message
[1:07:53] forsaking all now i've
[1:07:55] cherry picked this out so i encourage
[1:07:57] you once again to catch the full context
[1:08:00] but i believe these words just grasp the
[1:08:02] essence of what we're trying to
[1:08:03] communicate
[1:08:05] what did they leave talking about coming
[1:08:07] out of egypt what did they leave they
[1:08:08] left the hot sun
[1:08:10] under the task master down in egypt what
[1:08:13] did they get for leaving that warm
[1:08:15] sunshine down there
[1:08:17] they got to walk in the pillar of fire's
[1:08:19] light
[1:08:20] leaving that hot sun down there to walk
[1:08:23] in the light of
[1:08:24] god's pillar of fire what an
[1:08:27] exchange
[1:08:30] now it breaks our heart because we have
[1:08:32] the whole picture of the word right to
[1:08:33] realize that
[1:08:35] the elders died in the wilderness
[1:08:39] i've spoke this many times and and i i
[1:08:42] believe it's true
[1:08:44] but i don't want to speak it as doctrine
[1:08:46] because that wouldn't be fair
[1:08:48] but i believe brother trevor with all of
[1:08:51] my heart
[1:08:53] if just one of them would have been able
[1:08:56] to grasp that revelation
[1:08:58] and you had a rough day and you come and
[1:09:00] you heard joshua preach and you heard
[1:09:02] caleb preach
[1:09:04] and you were just thrashed out and
[1:09:06] you're discouraged because there's a lot
[1:09:07] of discouragement in the camp wait
[1:09:09] there's a lot of discouragement in the
[1:09:10] message right now
[1:09:12] so maybe our camp has some
[1:09:14] discouragement
[1:09:16] now i'm trying to break my habit now all
[1:09:19] you think i pick on sister jerry you'll
[1:09:21] notice she moved closer
[1:09:26] but i say this in sincerity
[1:09:29] as joshua and caleb got up if there just
[1:09:32] had been one brother
[1:09:35] in the camp that said i'm discouraged
[1:09:40] i'm tired it just seems like this whole
[1:09:42] journey has
[1:09:43] not went like we thought it would
[1:09:48] but that was what god promised us when
[1:09:50] we were down in egypt
[1:09:52] joshua and caleb are telling us exactly
[1:09:54] what god promised
[1:09:55] they haven't taken away from it they
[1:09:58] haven't added to it
[1:09:59] that's what they said and if they could
[1:10:01] have brought themselves to the courage
[1:10:03] of saying amen
[1:10:06] then there would be just as the nature
[1:10:08] of mankind another brother another
[1:10:10] brother another brother would have said
[1:10:12] that's the truth
[1:10:13] that's the truth amen but you see satan
[1:10:15] had come in so subtly in that group of
[1:10:17] people
[1:10:21] they had got so down-hearted
[1:10:26] because you know
[1:10:29] if the lord would just give us a glimpse
[1:10:30] through history
[1:10:32] and we heard every word that moses had
[1:10:34] said there would be some words
[1:10:37] that they'd be able to say but that
[1:10:38] ain't the way moses said it
[1:10:42] before
[1:10:45] but you see they didn't catch the
[1:10:46] revelation of what moses was saying
[1:10:49] they were measuring words
[1:10:55] kind of like a teenage girl
[1:10:58] maybe her first love boyfriend
[1:11:02] or maybe it's the boy
[1:11:05] loves me loves me not
[1:11:09] loves me loves me
[1:11:14] loves me now where was i um
[1:11:18] loves me not loves me loves me not i'm
[1:11:21] confused
[1:11:22] well i want it to end on loves me so i
[1:11:25] gotta go backwards and
[1:11:26] figure this out
[1:11:33] and her friend will go you're wrong
[1:11:35] you're wrong it's supposed to be he
[1:11:37] loves you not
[1:11:40] forget the words i'll be kind in this
[1:11:43] little thought the little girl grows up
[1:11:44] marries the boy it was real love
[1:11:50] but how many times with that little
[1:11:51] daisy or whatever it is that they're
[1:11:53] doing there
[1:11:54] marigold or whatever come up with loves
[1:11:58] i'm sorry those words don't affect the
[1:12:00] heart
[1:12:02] moses said i'm so messed up i need
[1:12:04] somebody else to speak for me and god
[1:12:06] says you've got a brother use aaron
[1:12:09] we have a prophet saints this said
[1:12:11] things
[1:12:13] that now the critic has come and said he
[1:12:16] loves you not
[1:12:18] well i don't care what the critic says
[1:12:21] my word which is the bible
[1:12:24] says he loves me and it won't matter how
[1:12:28] many loves me not that i hear around the
[1:12:30] world
[1:12:32] he loves me it isn't how many mistakes
[1:12:36] we've made
[1:12:38] because i find it interesting and i'm
[1:12:40] just going to take a poke at this
[1:12:41] because there's a little something
[1:12:42] rumbling around but
[1:12:43] i'm going to take a poke of this i find
[1:12:46] it interesting
[1:12:47] that the critics who say brother branham
[1:12:49] made mistakes
[1:12:51] have themselves on the internet
[1:12:54] contradicted
[1:12:55] themselves i would like for them to just
[1:12:58] go back in their own words
[1:13:00] and say when i reach a stage that i
[1:13:03] never
[1:13:03] never contradict myself i'm going to
[1:13:05] become the world's greatest critic
[1:13:07] but you see they can't and they won't
[1:13:12] because it is the nature i've got a wife
[1:13:15] that
[1:13:15] works at keeping me from doing that i'll
[1:13:18] say well we were here doing this and
[1:13:19] this and she's like that ain't where
[1:13:21] that happen
[1:13:23] but some of them still get out say amen
[1:13:26] sisters
[1:13:31] come on you know i'm telling the truth
[1:13:34] we as people
[1:13:36] have memories and they're not perfect
[1:13:41] but you see when we start to look at
[1:13:44] what we're exchanging for
[1:13:46] we realize it's not how perfect i am or
[1:13:49] how perfect you are
[1:13:50] but it's how perfect he is there becomes
[1:13:54] the guiding light there becomes the
[1:13:56] foundation there becomes the place
[1:13:58] we place our confidence in my brothers
[1:14:00] and sisters
[1:14:01] i'm not placing it in any man i'm not
[1:14:04] placing it
[1:14:05] are you amen no we've went beyond that
[1:14:08] those days are behind us
[1:14:09] we're placing our confidence in jesus
[1:14:12] christ
[1:14:13] and the manifested word it's interesting
[1:14:16] that god chose to use men isn't it
[1:14:20] brother brown says oh what an exchange
[1:14:22] i'd like to take that exchange wouldn't
[1:14:24] you
[1:14:25] congregation says amen a pillar of fire
[1:14:28] walk in the natural sunlight where they
[1:14:30] was driving under task masters
[1:14:33] to come out there and walk in god's
[1:14:35] light under the power of the holy spirit
[1:14:37] a pillar of fire that was leading them
[1:14:40] to a promised land
[1:14:42] now don't read no more for a moment
[1:14:46] a very clear path right what was god's
[1:14:49] promise to them
[1:14:50] not moses promised come on let's get
[1:14:52] this right not moses
[1:14:54] promise moses was the mouth
[1:14:57] moses could not fulfill that word
[1:15:02] so god's promises them is you come out
[1:15:06] we will go through the wilderness and i
[1:15:08] will take you back to your
[1:15:10] land understand this is the land they
[1:15:12] were identified with
[1:15:14] as a people not the land in the middle
[1:15:17] not the land they come from
[1:15:19] but the identity my brother and sister
[1:15:21] is not laodicea
[1:15:23] not this world not anything of this our
[1:15:25] identity
[1:15:26] is beyond all of this and if we're not
[1:15:30] careful satan turns our identity
[1:15:32] to this here the size of the house the
[1:15:35] size of the bank account the kind of the
[1:15:37] car we got the clothes that we have
[1:15:39] all of this things that's where he turns
[1:15:42] our attention but you see
[1:15:43] the focus was never the wilderness of
[1:15:45] sin
[1:15:47] the focus was never all those cities of
[1:15:50] ammon and whatever that they traveled
[1:15:51] through and conquered whatever
[1:15:52] that was never the focus the folk was
[1:15:55] was back to the promised land
[1:15:58] and satan worked so hard to draw their
[1:16:01] vision from the promised land and pace
[1:16:03] it down here
[1:16:04] and the people said you know we need a
[1:16:05] little pick-me-up
[1:16:07] now i hate to make confessions but i i
[1:16:09] like to be transparent
[1:16:10] i've started drinking coffee
[1:16:13] it's horrible but praise the lord it
[1:16:17] tastes like a hershey's chocolate bar
[1:16:20] while i'm drinking it
[1:16:25] see the rest of you you miss something
[1:16:27] there you guys drink this bitter stuff
[1:16:29] that curls your eyelashes and whatever
[1:16:31] else
[1:16:32] when you could settle for something that
[1:16:34] tasted
[1:16:35] so good
[1:16:43] i can see you're all against me i'm
[1:16:44] probably voted out
[1:16:49] but i've decided to quit because it's
[1:16:51] hard on my testimony
[1:16:57] but you see my brother and sister when
[1:16:58] we start to look at what it is
[1:17:01] and what we are focused on and what it
[1:17:03] is that we're called to
[1:17:05] we recognize satan works so hard
[1:17:09] to come down and make and this is the
[1:17:12] reason i brought up coffee
[1:17:13] nothing against those of you that drink
[1:17:15] coffee that's your your right
[1:17:17] yeah relax
[1:17:22] but you see i had someone recently tell
[1:17:25] me
[1:17:27] paul you don't drink coffee and i said
[1:17:30] that's right
[1:17:31] and i proved it when sister jerry and i
[1:17:33] and thank you church for your gift that
[1:17:35] uh you know sent sister jerry and i off
[1:17:37] on a little weekend
[1:17:40] we pulled up the little coffee shack in
[1:17:42] cascade
[1:17:43] sister jerry ordered her whatever it was
[1:17:48] and i looked at the lady she says do you
[1:17:50] want something sir and i said well
[1:17:52] uh i do um
[1:17:56] i want a hot chocolate with some
[1:17:58] caffeine in it
[1:17:59] and she says i know exactly what you
[1:18:02] need
[1:18:06] you see i don't want your original
[1:18:10] when it comes to coffee i'm good with
[1:18:12] the distraction
[1:18:15] and satan's good with the distraction he
[1:18:17] makes this distraction
[1:18:19] better tasting than the original
[1:18:24] and so i use coffee because it just is a
[1:18:27] nice analogy
[1:18:28] pretty soon you look over and there's
[1:18:30] cream
[1:18:31] there's sugar there's
[1:18:34] chocolate there's
[1:18:38] well anyway pumpkin
[1:18:45] right i gotta make sure i preach at all
[1:18:47] of you so nobody thinks i'm picking on
[1:18:49] you
[1:18:51] but you see how satan makes the so
[1:18:55] so desirable
[1:19:01] so here they were walking god's light on
[1:19:04] the power of the holy spirit a purif
[1:19:05] pillar of fire that was leading them to
[1:19:08] a promised land
[1:19:09] now we know all that happened along the
[1:19:11] route to the promised land don't we
[1:19:13] moses gets frustrated at the people he
[1:19:15] must have been
[1:19:16] a tad bit frustrated with god and he
[1:19:19] strikes the rock
[1:19:20] again and now we see how that brought
[1:19:23] about a representation of the smiting of
[1:19:26] our lord jesus christ
[1:19:27] it's all tied right into scripture but
[1:19:29] you see by the spoken word
[1:19:31] moses could have walked there stood upon
[1:19:34] the word that he was given
[1:19:36] and not let the frustrations of the
[1:19:38] people now i say this
[1:19:40] but i personally have experienced i know
[1:19:41] brother david has experienced this
[1:19:43] i'm sure brother chris has experienced
[1:19:45] this that the frustrations of the people
[1:19:47] can and will influence us
[1:19:52] and we find ourselves striking when we
[1:19:55] should be praying
[1:19:57] striking when we should be asking for
[1:19:59] revelation striking when we
[1:20:02] should wait on the lord
[1:20:06] amen and they the people
[1:20:09] got frustrated moses on the mountain
[1:20:14] look we're looking for revelation church
[1:20:15] we're looking for revival we're looking
[1:20:17] for leadership and moses is on the
[1:20:19] mountain
[1:20:20] but i tell you i got an idea right here
[1:20:22] if all you sisters now just think about
[1:20:24] the time period
[1:20:25] all you sisters pull those bracelets off
[1:20:27] all you
[1:20:28] pull those big earrings off all you
[1:20:30] sisters pull those ankle bracelets off
[1:20:32] and all this stuff and let's melt them
[1:20:34] down and let's make us a calf
[1:20:37] obviously the calf's going to get us to
[1:20:38] the promised land right
[1:20:42] it is under that anointing that
[1:20:44] anointing suddenly brings them to a
[1:20:46] place
[1:20:46] they're willing to receive revelation
[1:20:48] that's not in the original word
[1:20:50] believing that's going to bring the same
[1:20:53] deliverance and the same guidance
[1:20:57] are you with me now brother brown says
[1:20:59] same thing today
[1:21:01] walk out of the light of this world
[1:21:04] the things that's of the world to walk
[1:21:07] in the light of god
[1:21:08] it leads you to the promised land so we
[1:21:11] have
[1:21:12] a very clear path from the center i hope
[1:21:15] you're with me
[1:21:16] from the center of our wilderness of sin
[1:21:19] we have a very clear directive
[1:21:22] to follow to get into the promised land
[1:21:25] amen it doesn't include any uh uh kadish
[1:21:28] barnias it doesn't include
[1:21:30] you know any times with with uh all all
[1:21:33] of those i'll i'll just
[1:21:34] condense it down with all of those
[1:21:36] things that happen it doesn't include
[1:21:38] any of that it's just simply walk in the
[1:21:40] light we don't need another
[1:21:42] great revelation we don't need another
[1:21:45] great strong voice we don't need a
[1:21:46] detour
[1:21:48] amen so you look at this i just think
[1:21:52] that's good my brother and sister
[1:21:53] walk out of the light of this world
[1:21:56] the things that's of the world to walk
[1:21:58] in the light of god it leads you to the
[1:22:00] promised land
[1:22:01] amen now look at this i need to hurry
[1:22:03] right along but i
[1:22:04] made my mind up before i started that
[1:22:07] we reach a certain point we'll just stop
[1:22:11] verse 39 and these all having obtained a
[1:22:13] good report through faith receive not
[1:22:14] the promise you see because there's a
[1:22:16] time and a season for everything
[1:22:18] god had already ordained my brother and
[1:22:20] sister that this would be the season
[1:22:22] that god would come and place the word
[1:22:24] in a perfect form
[1:22:26] in a perfect people to bring about the
[1:22:28] culmination of the original promise
[1:22:31] so god didn't have to come and say well
[1:22:33] you know uh um
[1:22:35] this story is incomplete like an editor
[1:22:37] you know coming reading somebody's book
[1:22:38] they're writing
[1:22:39] this story's incomplete you've got to
[1:22:41] have another chapter or you took the
[1:22:43] story this is where it ought to end
[1:22:44] we're cutting this off god don't have to
[1:22:46] do that
[1:22:46] god knew exactly what was necessary
[1:22:48] placed it in the right position
[1:22:50] and so as it is now there's a time and a
[1:22:53] season
[1:22:54] and they received a good report now this
[1:22:56] is not like a
[1:22:57] checklist this is not as though god was
[1:22:59] going down through there and checking
[1:23:01] these things off
[1:23:02] it's not as it were a report card that
[1:23:04] they failed so you've got to have
[1:23:05] another
[1:23:06] class to bring this forward but my
[1:23:08] brother and sister
[1:23:09] god they were doers let me just put it
[1:23:11] that way
[1:23:12] you understand that the saints of old
[1:23:14] were doers
[1:23:16] not perfect they made mistakes but they
[1:23:17] were doers
[1:23:19] right we read the word we have ample
[1:23:21] evidence they
[1:23:22] took god at his word and they are doers
[1:23:26] amen and in spite of that god said i'm
[1:23:29] going to bring it out to a certain point
[1:23:31] because i have another age another
[1:23:33] people that are doers
[1:23:35] they're not going to just talk about
[1:23:36] this you see those
[1:23:38] saints of old sought
[1:23:42] and found god's provided way
[1:23:46] now i'm going to just throw just kind of
[1:23:48] a little human element in here
[1:23:49] if if you can have any of you ever
[1:23:53] experienced the situation the position
[1:23:58] the mental state of
[1:24:01] if they can do it i can do it too
[1:24:05] in the natural yeah i destroyed a good
[1:24:09] dirt bike once
[1:24:10] on that principle he can do it i can do
[1:24:14] it too
[1:24:15] well he could do it i only tried
[1:24:19] but you see that's not where we as the
[1:24:20] bride are
[1:24:22] it's not us saying they did it we can do
[1:24:24] it too because
[1:24:26] it's the same holy ghost it's the same
[1:24:28] promised word
[1:24:30] and it's still the same revelation that
[1:24:33] they
[1:24:33] walked in is right here present so it's
[1:24:36] no longer
[1:24:37] this element of of the apostles and and
[1:24:40] the
[1:24:40] and the all of the saints of old they oh
[1:24:43] they could do this
[1:24:44] you see it was the holy ghost in them
[1:24:46] that calls them to do that
[1:24:48] and the same holy ghost is here and i
[1:24:50] say lord be
[1:24:51] in us also lord in your full power
[1:24:55] your full authority because what that
[1:24:57] will do is bring us to the place we
[1:24:59] fulfill this same word
[1:25:01] so it's no longer whether we're equal
[1:25:03] spiritually or we're this or we're that
[1:25:05] or they were such great men no my
[1:25:07] brother and sister they were men
[1:25:08] anointed of the holy ghost they were
[1:25:10] women anointed of the holy ghost
[1:25:12] and we are too hallelujah
[1:25:16] they surrender to god and we are too
[1:25:19] and so god's bringing to pass the
[1:25:22] fulfillment of his word
[1:25:24] to bring them into the place that they
[1:25:26] needed to be
[1:25:27] now do we understand uh symbiotic
[1:25:30] relationships
[1:25:31] right oftentimes there's a host and
[1:25:34] terminology would say a parasite
[1:25:36] but we'll look at this by in the
[1:25:38] spiritual sense we have a symbiotic
[1:25:41] relationship
[1:25:42] with our lord jesus christ simply put
[1:25:46] we can't live without him
[1:25:51] he's our host
[1:25:54] his life is our life
[1:25:58] and without him we have no life
[1:26:00] therefore we die
[1:26:02] so this symbiotic relationship my
[1:26:04] brother and sister
[1:26:05] is not a three-sided relationship
[1:26:12] one relationship
[1:26:16] boy jesus shook him up didn't he when he
[1:26:19] said
[1:26:20] you gotta eat my flesh
[1:26:25] and drink my blood well we're out of
[1:26:28] here
[1:26:30] this has this this church has just did a
[1:26:33] hard
[1:26:34] left
[1:26:37] but you see they missed the symbiotic
[1:26:39] relationship
[1:26:43] they missed that relationship and that
[1:26:45] was the only relationship that mattered
[1:26:49] it wasn't the church and the priest
[1:26:52] or in this day the pastor it's not the
[1:26:55] church and something else
[1:26:57] it's not some of you here and some of
[1:26:59] you there and i'll put this
[1:27:01] in this just to put a little plug in
[1:27:03] there just to kind of poke it just in
[1:27:04] case that spirit ever shows up
[1:27:06] if we ever as a church get to the point
[1:27:09] that we don't come to church because
[1:27:10] brother so-and-so is preaching
[1:27:12] then i'm going to tell people right now
[1:27:14] anybody that's listening anybody that's
[1:27:15] here
[1:27:16] you need to find you a place in the
[1:27:17] altar because that's not the holy ghost
[1:27:23] our symbiotic relationship is not
[1:27:25] brothers so and so
[1:27:27] and and i really just feed i've heard
[1:27:29] this so often this makes me sick well i
[1:27:31] really can feed
[1:27:32] on brother so-and-so's ministry are you
[1:27:36] feeding on the word or the man
[1:27:39] if you're feeding on the word then
[1:27:41] you'll receive the word
[1:27:43] wherever it comes from
[1:27:47] now we can have favorites that's fine i
[1:27:50] hope i'm on somebody's list
[1:27:55] come on some of you
[1:27:58] i'm sorry i shouldn't i shouldn't do
[1:28:00] that forgive me
[1:28:01] but when you guys get too serious
[1:28:03] sometimes i get nervous
[1:28:07] see the symbiotic relationship
[1:28:10] brings us well we can't live without him
[1:28:12] now the unbeliever says he can live
[1:28:14] without god
[1:28:17] that's his that's his declaration he can
[1:28:19] live without god
[1:28:20] but the believer amen we're speaking to
[1:28:23] believers till that the believer
[1:28:24] recognized
[1:28:25] an undeniable need
[1:28:30] it's not like i can and it doesn't
[1:28:32] matter i can go for a season
[1:28:36] you know i read a nice little quote
[1:28:38] don't who wrote
[1:28:39] who wrote it but it says
[1:28:45] let me save that that's not what it said
[1:28:52] let me say that i'll touch on it in just
[1:28:56] a moment
[1:28:56] see the believer recognize the
[1:28:58] undeniable need
[1:29:00] in other words day by day the believer
[1:29:02] says
[1:29:03] i need
[1:29:06] not i probably should or i could or i
[1:29:09] would
[1:29:10] but they say i need god in my life
[1:29:15] and there's an unquenchable desire for
[1:29:18] more of the lord
[1:29:20] now i'll read my little quotation here
[1:29:22] that i read
[1:29:24] this quotation says the one who says
[1:29:26] that they have enough of god
[1:29:28] has not met him yet
[1:29:33] hallelujah there's just no way when we
[1:29:36] meet god that we could say you know i've
[1:29:37] got enough of you lord
[1:29:39] i got enough to last the rest of my
[1:29:41] lifetime no there's an
[1:29:43] undeniable desire in the heart of that
[1:29:46] believer
[1:29:46] i need more of god
[1:29:51] hallelujah now let me hurry right along
[1:29:54] here
[1:29:56] we know we've been taught we hear it
[1:29:59] faith cometh by hearing
[1:30:01] but we also know that it's possible to
[1:30:04] hear
[1:30:06] but not to here
[1:30:10] right they hear with the ear
[1:30:13] but they're not hearing lest
[1:30:17] the scripture says i'd have to save them
[1:30:20] ouch our lord jesus is rough
[1:30:24] isn't he because if they actually heard
[1:30:27] what was said
[1:30:29] i would have to save them
[1:30:32] yes my oh my that sounds rough but i'll
[1:30:36] tell you what you do you should make us
[1:30:37] happy and say thank you lord
[1:30:39] that my ears are open and we know it's
[1:30:42] possible
[1:30:42] to read and not comprehend right that's
[1:30:46] right
[1:30:46] i it's just plain and simple we can put
[1:30:48] it in all kinds of natural forms these
[1:30:50] young people are learning
[1:30:51] uh uh all these math equations and this
[1:30:54] kind of stuff now
[1:30:55] they never had that when i was a kid you
[1:30:57] know and and they
[1:30:59] i had a young man say brother paul can
[1:31:01] can you answer this
[1:31:03] and i looked at him and i said what is
[1:31:05] it
[1:31:07] i can't even answer it because i don't
[1:31:09] even know what it is
[1:31:11] and he said well it's an equation out of
[1:31:13] trigonometry
[1:31:14] with some other thing added to it and i
[1:31:17] said
[1:31:18] uh i think they invented a calculator or
[1:31:21] something for that
[1:31:23] i said what are you using it for and he
[1:31:25] explained what he was using it for
[1:31:27] and i said let me show you how i figure
[1:31:29] that out
[1:31:31] and he he was there with this paper
[1:31:32] clear full of all these numbers
[1:31:34] and i said well you just run this and
[1:31:36] you do this and you do this and he says
[1:31:37] well that's too simple
[1:31:41] yeah praise the lord so i just what i
[1:31:45] need to do
[1:31:46] is just look at the word in simplicity
[1:31:48] right
[1:31:49] god in simplicity not in the hardest
[1:31:53] form
[1:31:53] of the equation but let's break it down
[1:31:56] into
[1:31:57] simplicity same young man asked me he
[1:32:00] says well brother paul
[1:32:02] how did you guys used to i have to admit
[1:32:04] i've fallen to the spirit of laodicea
[1:32:07] now i either drive a trap around the
[1:32:09] field to figure out how big it is
[1:32:11] because the computer and the tractor
[1:32:12] will tell me or i ride a four-wheeler
[1:32:15] around the field holding on to my gps
[1:32:17] unit
[1:32:19] but you know what we used to take a big
[1:32:22] long tape and
[1:32:24] run it out and figure out our rectangles
[1:32:26] and our triangles and
[1:32:28] we come up with the right answer
[1:32:36] some of you kids ought to come out and
[1:32:37] go to school with me
[1:32:41] of course plan on eating some dirt while
[1:32:42] you're at it
[1:32:45] but you see if people can hear
[1:32:48] but not hear they read but don't
[1:32:51] comprehend
[1:32:53] let me put it this way if christianity
[1:32:56] in general
[1:32:58] brings understanding of god then
[1:33:00] revelation
[1:33:02] 17 should cause the world
[1:33:06] to shudder not blindly press
[1:33:10] forward in their darkness their sin and
[1:33:12] their debauchery it ought to cause them
[1:33:13] to shudder
[1:33:15] because it tells us right here the seven
[1:33:17] angels and the seven vials and
[1:33:19] i'll show you the judgment of the great
[1:33:21] that sit on the waters and
[1:33:23] how the kings of the earth have
[1:33:24] committed fornication now these kings my
[1:33:27] brother and sister
[1:33:28] are a term that is listed as actually
[1:33:31] archaic so if you brought the bible into
[1:33:33] modern times it would talk about
[1:33:35] monarchs it would talk about presidents
[1:33:37] it would talk about prime ministers
[1:33:39] you understand what i'm saying we're not
[1:33:40] trying to change the scripture
[1:33:44] with whom all of this leadership of the
[1:33:47] world has committed fornication
[1:33:48] and the inhabitants of the earth have
[1:33:50] been made drunk in the wine of her
[1:33:52] fornication
[1:33:53] this my brother and sister if the mere
[1:33:56] claim of christianity
[1:33:57] would bring enlightenment this chapter
[1:34:01] we won't go through the whole thing
[1:34:02] but this chapter should cause the whole
[1:34:04] world to shudder and find an altar
[1:34:08] but they just call it a mystery and it
[1:34:11] has
[1:34:12] nothing to do with them are you with me
[1:34:17] so if christianity in general brought
[1:34:19] understanding
[1:34:20] the world would be in revival right now
[1:34:23] now i'm going to just bounce forward
[1:34:25] over some things john 14
[1:34:26] 8 we'll look at this my brother and
[1:34:29] sister and i hope that
[1:34:30] me cutting this short doesn't um doesn't
[1:34:33] upset
[1:34:34] you know the the understanding or where
[1:34:36] we're going
[1:34:37] but just to show the reflection my
[1:34:39] brother and sister of what it is
[1:34:41] that god having chose
[1:34:45] something greater
[1:34:48] in you to make
[1:34:51] them perfect
[1:34:56] are you with me you see
[1:35:00] we actually have an obligation
[1:35:04] to the saints of old not a checklist
[1:35:08] obligation
[1:35:11] but an obligation to believe
[1:35:14] and confess the word exactly as
[1:35:17] god brought it to bring it to pass
[1:35:21] because by following that we not only
[1:35:24] secure our own salvation
[1:35:27] we according to the scriptures bring the
[1:35:29] saints of old
[1:35:30] into a position of perfection
[1:35:34] pretty healthy responsibility isn't it
[1:35:37] but you know what reason i titled my
[1:35:40] thoughts
[1:35:42] something good i started out actually i
[1:35:45] had to
[1:35:45] reword this something good is going to
[1:35:48] happen
[1:35:50] stop stop stop stop stop stop
[1:35:53] something good is happening
[1:35:58] we don't want to get into this deal that
[1:36:00] we're looking you know over the hill
[1:36:02] when god
[1:36:03] no he's working right now saints come on
[1:36:06] you can only imagine where we would be
[1:36:08] today if it wasn't for the lord
[1:36:11] amen we can only imagine what kind of
[1:36:13] mess
[1:36:15] hallelujah amen sister emmy would you
[1:36:18] just come
[1:36:20] we'll just we'll just cut this off right
[1:36:22] here
[1:36:23] still got quite a bit of stuff right
[1:36:25] here matthew 4
[1:36:27] 1-11 our lord jesus being led up into
[1:36:31] the wilderness
[1:36:32] being tempted of the devil you know his
[1:36:36] answer come right back just the same
[1:36:37] answer
[1:36:38] that you and i can put to work today it
[1:36:40] is written
[1:36:42] it's written here's the word it's
[1:36:44] written
[1:36:45] i don't have to defend this message i
[1:36:48] just need to live it
[1:36:50] it's written god's got it all in control
[1:36:54] what god spoke will
[1:36:57] come to pass i have confidence in that
[1:37:00] can you say amen to that tonight
[1:37:03] amen i hope this is just a little bit
[1:37:05] encouraging to you just to realize see
[1:37:07] what god's doing through the ages we're
[1:37:10] looking back at the apostle paul and
[1:37:12] matthew mark luke and john timothy and
[1:37:15] titus and
[1:37:16] all of these men we're looking back
[1:37:19] going
[1:37:19] wow that's incredible what they
[1:37:21] experienced
[1:37:23] if god opened a portal in heaven they
[1:37:24] would be looking out here and go
[1:37:26] my there's the bride
[1:37:30] the other part of us and they're in
[1:37:33] laodicea
[1:37:35] and they're still living it they're
[1:37:37] overcoming in laodicea look at this all
[1:37:40] the wickedness we faced in our day
[1:37:42] and they're facing it plus much more and
[1:37:46] they're living it
[1:37:51] oh lest i close the service on a
[1:37:53] downbeat
[1:37:55] we're here going my goodness if the
[1:37:58] devil just comes with another left hook
[1:38:00] i'm toast
[1:38:02] if this happens i'm just if i lose a job
[1:38:06] if this
[1:38:07] no it's got it all with control saints
[1:38:10] amen
[1:38:14] i know i've recounted this many times
[1:38:17] but it's still it's burnt into my senses
[1:38:21] reading the fox's book of
[1:38:25] martyrs
[1:38:28] a story in there i wished i had marked
[1:38:30] the page and
[1:38:31] had it to share probably ought to go
[1:38:34] back and find it
[1:38:36] but a man of wealth
[1:38:41] brought down to the stake to be burnt
[1:38:43] and they said just look
[1:38:44] recant you're a lovely family you've got
[1:38:47] all of this
[1:38:48] don't let that waste just recant and
[1:38:51] under the
[1:38:52] pressure he said yeah
[1:38:56] okay they let him go
[1:38:59] the devil says i turned one
[1:39:04] but the story goes that he spent the
[1:39:06] whole night tossing
[1:39:08] turning crying out to god
[1:39:11] bitter tears lord i betrayed you
[1:39:14] forgive me
[1:39:16] [Music]
[1:39:18] and with no one there to say oh come on
[1:39:20] go do it go do it
[1:39:22] just what was burning in his soul
[1:39:27] walked away from what we would all call
[1:39:29] logic
[1:39:31] right he's home free they think he's
[1:39:33] given up brother branham says don't
[1:39:35] think you can serve god
[1:39:36] secretly god's called us to an open
[1:39:40] gospel an open book
[1:39:43] [Music]
[1:39:45] and he goes down the next morning it's a
[1:39:48] lovely story some of you might be
[1:39:50] familiar with it
[1:39:51] he goes down the next morning and they
[1:39:53] said what are you doing here and he says
[1:39:54] you know what i'm recanting my
[1:39:56] recanting and they're like what are you
[1:39:59] what do you what are you thinking i can
[1:40:00] only see it being played out but what
[1:40:02] are you
[1:40:02] thinking because you gotta understand
[1:40:06] that that
[1:40:07] romanish spirit is really not about god
[1:40:11] and it's really actually not about
[1:40:12] religion while it is about religion but
[1:40:15] it's not really about god as religion
[1:40:17] it's about their form of worship
[1:40:22] their idol
[1:40:23] [Music]
[1:40:26] which isn't a god amen
[1:40:30] remember they bring the ark the old
[1:40:33] statue
[1:40:35] pitches over on his head they're kind of
[1:40:37] uptight about it standing back up what
[1:40:39] happened here
[1:40:42] what was he doing saints sitting on an
[1:40:44] unfirmed foundation and falling over
[1:40:46] no sir that god
[1:40:50] was bowing down to jehovah
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:40:55] and this man's there and they go to tie
[1:40:56] him up to the stake and he says hey
[1:40:58] don't don't tie me here
[1:40:59] i'm so committed i'm going to stand
[1:41:01] [Music]
[1:41:02] but you know they never did that anymore
[1:41:05] because even as the flames licked up his
[1:41:07] body
[1:41:08] he lifted his hands and cried out in
[1:41:12] worship
[1:41:14] asking god to receive his soul
[1:41:17] and he was there with his hands lifted
[1:41:19] up and they did everything they could
[1:41:22] to push his hands his arms but they
[1:41:23] couldn't get close to the fire
[1:41:26] saints don't think that this gospel
[1:41:29] was a cakewalk and that we have just
[1:41:32] received the bitter blunt end of the
[1:41:35] ages
[1:41:37] no sir they fought they served
[1:41:41] they sold out they committed themselves
[1:41:45] oh could we do any less i ask
[1:41:49] oh but lest i close it on a bad note
[1:41:52] something good is happening we're
[1:41:55] recognizing it's no longer
[1:41:56] us we have our weakness of the flesh and
[1:42:00] of the mind and of the spirit and
[1:42:02] god comes in and takes all of that and
[1:42:06] changes us turns us into a new creature
[1:42:09] in christ
[1:42:10] jesus not that he just now changed us
[1:42:13] saints
[1:42:14] but now the reflection i was sitting in
[1:42:17] an accountant's office
