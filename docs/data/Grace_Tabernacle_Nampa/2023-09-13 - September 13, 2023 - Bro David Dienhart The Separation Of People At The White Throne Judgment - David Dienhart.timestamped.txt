[26:09] thank you
[26:18] eyes
[26:22] [Music]
[26:37] this eyes right here we understand with
[26:40] our heart we see with our heart
[26:44] just Mike no I'm sorry
[26:48] [Music]
[26:57] I just had something on my heart this
[26:59] morning or thought throughout the day
[27:02] that come to me and then about the
[27:04] afternoon there the Lord just laid just
[27:06] seemed to change
[27:08] so this morning or this evening will be
[27:10] kind of a little different
[27:13] it's going to be somewhat informative
[27:15] but I want to take what the prophet has
[27:17] said in some things in the church age
[27:18] book
[27:20] and maybe bring some clarification to it
[27:24] and something I took here a while back
[27:26] oh well then about a year ago in a
[27:30] series but I didn't I felt that this
[27:33] portion I just wanted to dwell a little
[27:34] bit more on tonight
[27:36] so I'm going to bring different quotes
[27:39] to you so it's going to be kind of like
[27:40] a little study and
[27:44] not so much and I can see because
[27:47] there's so many missing that I just feel
[27:51] that certainly the Lord's will change it
[27:54] and I don't think we'd have been able to
[27:56] do this on a Wednesday the other one
[27:58] anyway because it really gets into a
[28:01] little more time and so if you'll stand
[28:04] with me and we can turn to the Book of
[28:06] Matthew
[28:11] and I want to title this a separation of
[28:14] people at the white Throne judgment
[28:18] there's a separation of people at the
[28:20] white Throne judgment
[28:22] so we're dealing here we're looking at
[28:24] the white Throne judgment I also want to
[28:26] bring in the bride as we go through this
[28:28] to
[28:28] bring them into what they are where they
[28:31] are in this time
[28:33] and how they come to that place
[28:37] so
[28:38] it's have a word of Prayer our precious
[28:41] heavenly father as we bow in your
[28:43] presence we take complete Authority by
[28:46] your spirit over this service
[28:48] and Lord asking you to bless your word
[28:51] Lord and open it to the hearts of your
[28:54] people Lord we are coming here bringing
[28:57] forth a perfect interpretation of the
[29:00] word Lord some things here that will be
[29:02] said Lord through the years have been
[29:05] misinterpreted by theologians and and by
[29:08] by maybe uh footnotes and bibles and the
[29:12] Lord we've had a perfect interpretation
[29:14] by Divine Vindication in this hour for
[29:17] your Prophet said when that which is
[29:18] perfect and the perfect he said Has Come
[29:21] then we have a perfect interpretation we
[29:25] have a way provided we have the way
[29:27] provided
[29:28] for it into a Rapture and Lord we know
[29:31] that the bride will be the one in the
[29:33] Rapture because Lord they possess the
[29:36] Holy Ghost
[29:37] at this time they're the only ones in
[29:40] this earth that do possess the Holy
[29:42] Ghost and father there's many good
[29:44] people there's many people Lord that
[29:46] that will that will arise in the white
[29:49] Throne judgment in fact they're called
[29:51] the righteous
[29:53] they are righteous and there is
[29:55] unrighteous in this judgment Lord as we
[29:58] bow before you now we ask you to bring
[30:01] forth in accordance with your will these
[30:03] things and Lord may I stay focused that
[30:06] it just may be brought Lord as you want
[30:08] it to be and For Your Glory in Jesus
[30:11] Christ's name amen amen Matthew 25
[30:15] starting with verse 31.
[30:20] so again my my title is a separation of
[30:24] people
[30:25] and this is something the prophet had
[30:27] mentioned
[30:29] in the church age book under the
[30:31] sardisan church age and that's where
[30:33] we're going to be speaking of here this
[30:36] evening is under that sardisan church
[30:38] age and brother Branham says on
[30:40] paragraph 130 30. he says I want you
[30:43] another point to see here in the great
[30:45] white Throne judgment there will be a
[30:48] separation of people
[30:50] the book of life will be opened and
[30:52] another book will be opened and so we
[30:55] have the scriptures and we'll come into
[30:57] that in just a moment that the books
[30:59] were opened and another book
[31:01] which is The Book of Life
[31:03] and so we want to begin reading here and
[31:07] this is kind of a lengthy scripture so I
[31:09] I just have you I'll read it and then
[31:11] you can be seated and we'll go with
[31:12] these other scriptures here as the Lord
[31:15] will help us
[31:16] Matthew 25 31 when the son of man shall
[31:20] come in his glory and all the Holy
[31:23] Angels with him now this is the
[31:25] scripture that brother Branham right
[31:27] behind what he just what I just read to
[31:29] you began reading this scripture
[31:32] identifying this time to be the
[31:35] uh White Throne judgment now now
[31:38] Scofield and many of them say it is not
[31:40] the white Throne judgment
[31:42] but we had a Prophet come with the word
[31:44] interpretation
[31:46] and I'm glad the interpretation is
[31:48] brought Clarity to the word for us in
[31:51] this hour aren't you amen so when the
[31:54] son of man shall come in his glory and
[31:57] all the Holy Angels with him and then
[32:01] shall he sit upon the throne of his
[32:04] glory and before him shall be gathered
[32:06] all nations that's tongues people
[32:10] whatever it is it's all nations and he
[32:14] shall separate them one from another
[32:17] now it sounds like he's separating
[32:19] Nations but he's separating people
[32:22] of all Nations
[32:23] and and he shall separate them one from
[32:26] another as not
[32:29] but as a shepherd
[32:31] divideth his sheep from the goats
[32:35] and he shall set the sheep on this right
[32:37] hand but the goats
[32:40] but the goats on his left and I'll I'll
[32:42] just stop here a moment and I want to
[32:44] read something the prophet said he said
[32:46] to further clarify notice specifically
[32:49] the words of Matthew 25
[32:51] 31-46 now this is paragraph 142 page 312
[32:55] if you're wanting to write these down
[32:58] it does not say that a Shepherd is
[33:00] literally separating sheep from goats
[33:02] but it is as a shepherd
[33:04] dividing dividing sheep from goats these
[33:08] are not sheep in this particular area of
[33:11] time
[33:12] white Throne judgment a particular area
[33:15] is white Throne judgment he said the
[33:18] Sheep are in his fold they heard his
[33:20] voice the word and they followed him
[33:22] they already have
[33:24] eternal life and cannot come into the
[33:27] judgment
[33:28] but these do not have eternal life and
[33:31] they are in the Judgment they are
[33:33] allowed to go into some are allowed to
[33:36] go into and these that we're speaking of
[33:39] there's two gonna we're gonna read of
[33:40] two here in Matthew 25 righteous and
[33:45] unrighteous
[33:47] and and these righteous are allowed to
[33:49] go allowed to go into
[33:52] eternal life
[33:55] all right so begin to finish reading
[33:58] here in verse 33 and he shall set the
[34:00] sheep on his right hand and the goats on
[34:02] his left then shall the king say unto
[34:04] them on his right hand Come Ye blessed
[34:06] of my father inherit the Kingdom
[34:08] prepared for you from the foundation of
[34:11] the world
[34:13] for I was and hungered and you gave me
[34:17] meat I was thirsty
[34:19] and you gave me drink I was a stranger
[34:22] and you took me in there's something
[34:25] they did
[34:27] okay these are works
[34:31] Now watch how the scripture unfolds
[34:33] itself he said naked and you clothed me
[34:36] I was sick and you visited me I was in
[34:39] prison and you came unto me
[34:41] then shall the righteous
[34:44] now we know the bride are righteous
[34:46] but this is another class of righteous
[34:50] okay they are righteous that then shall
[34:53] the righteous answer him saying Lord win
[34:57] saw we the hungered and fed thee
[35:03] or thirsty and gave the drink
[35:06] when Saul Williams saw we thee a
[35:10] stranger and took thee in or naked and
[35:13] clothe thee or when saw we the sick or
[35:17] in prison and came unto thee see they
[35:19] didn't know it
[35:21] they weren't even aware of what they did
[35:24] but they had it in their heart let me
[35:26] just say this they had it in their heart
[35:28] to fulfill this scripture yeah
[35:32] amen they had to have that in their
[35:35] heart all right and so and so he and and
[35:38] and the King shall answer and say unto
[35:40] them verily I say unto you in so much as
[35:43] you have done it unto one of the least
[35:46] of these my brethren
[35:49] he specifically speaks of these as
[35:52] brother now these Brethren are not those
[35:55] that just read these Brethren are his
[35:58] bride
[36:01] okay and so now let I want to give you
[36:05] understanding here
[36:06] that I am certainly all for good works
[36:09] yes and I think a bride that is full of
[36:12] the Holy Ghost will want to respect
[36:14] another person and do what they can to
[36:16] help that person and give themselves to
[36:18] another
[36:19] because eternal life is living for
[36:21] others
[36:22] but it's not a Works Affair for
[36:24] salvation because the bride already has
[36:27] salvation
[36:29] amen are you with me she's already
[36:31] identified in Christ
[36:33] and especially in this day when the
[36:35] book's been opened
[36:37] see we've had a book opened
[36:41] all right now I just draw I'll just drop
[36:43] that in we've already had a book open
[36:45] yeah all right so and then she'll say
[36:48] and unto the lease of my brother and you
[36:51] have done it if you did it to them
[36:52] you've done it to me why they're one
[36:56] yeah then shall he say unto them on the
[36:59] left hand depart from me you cursed
[37:02] on into Everlasting fire prepared for
[37:05] the devil and his angels for I was
[37:07] hungered and you gave me no meat I was
[37:10] thirsty and you gave me no drink
[37:14] now and I was and they had a choice
[37:16] though they didn't know either what they
[37:18] were doing but and yet in a certain
[37:20] situation they had a choice to make
[37:23] amen these others had choices to me they
[37:27] didn't know why maybe they did it they
[37:28] didn't even know who they were doing it
[37:30] to and neither did the unrighteous
[37:34] all right so and so I was a stranger and
[37:36] you took me in naked and you clothed me
[37:38] not sick and imprisoned and you visited
[37:40] me not then shall they say then shall
[37:43] they also answer him saying Lord
[37:46] when saw we thee a hungered or a thirst
[37:49] or a stranger or naked or sick or in
[37:51] prison did not Minister unto thee then
[37:54] shall he answer them certainly verily I
[37:56] say unto you in so much as you did it
[37:57] not to one of the least of these these
[38:01] who Brethren you did it not to me
[38:05] and these shall go away unto Everlasting
[38:07] punishment but the righteous into life
[38:11] eternal
[38:12] all right you may be seated
[38:15] I want to read something on paragraph
[38:17] just so we know where we're standing
[38:19] here
[38:20] on on paragraph 157.
[38:23] of this message period page 317 he says
[38:27] this in 316.
[38:30] he wants us to understand brother
[38:31] Branham wants us to understand he said
[38:34] many of the things that we've gone
[38:35] through May offend some
[38:37] he said
[38:39] he said it must be accepted and believed
[38:41] by faith some will be offended but what
[38:44] I have set forth be set forth because
[38:47] they but what I have set forth because
[38:50] they failed to understand the
[38:52] sovereignty of God
[38:54] watch this he's God's sovereign
[38:57] which sets forth that God is God and
[39:00] because he is God one cannot defeat his
[39:03] counsels or throat throw his will
[39:08] his will and purpose he thoured his will
[39:11] and purpose but he being
[39:13] omnipotent is ruling in all Affairs and
[39:17] doing what
[39:19] and doing whatever he will with his
[39:22] creation because all were created for
[39:25] his good pleasure therefore as Paul said
[39:27] if God should take one lump of clay and
[39:29] make of that same lump one vessel into
[39:31] honor and another vessel unto dishonor
[39:34] who can be offended and cry against him
[39:37] that he has the right to do this on the
[39:40] grounds of creation alone we cannot deny
[39:44] all right all right yet yet he went
[39:47] further even further for according to
[39:49] Romans 14 7-9 we have the Eerie food
[39:54] irrefutable proof that Jesus Paid the
[39:58] purchase price of the whole world and
[40:01] therefore he can do as he Wills with his
[40:03] own
[40:05] and see now he's going to read we're
[40:06] going to read Romans 14 7-9 here for
[40:09] none of us liveth to himself and no man
[40:12] dieth to himself
[40:15] for whether we live we live unto the
[40:17] Lord and whether we die we die unto the
[40:19] Lord whether we live or die we are the
[40:21] Lords that's ownership
[40:23] we are the Lords of course we we can say
[40:27] too born again we are the Lords whether
[40:29] we live or die we're the Lords all right
[40:31] but he's speaking of ownership for this
[40:34] end Christ both died and Rose and
[40:36] revived that he might be Lord both of
[40:38] the dead and living and brother Brown
[40:41] said here ownership not relationship is
[40:45] meant here
[40:46] all right
[40:48] so carrying on
[40:51] let's go to the scripture
[40:55] and we I just I'll bypass some of these
[40:58] things because we know that bride is
[41:00] Brethren he does he does mention that
[41:04] if you want to see where it's at it's
[41:05] paragraph 143
[41:08] upon what grounds do they enter into
[41:10] life eternal certainly not upon the fact
[41:13] that they already have his life as does
[41:15] the bride but they re but they receive
[41:18] it because they were kind to his
[41:20] Brethren they are not his brethren that
[41:24] would make them joint heirs with Jesus
[41:26] they are not Heirs of to anything but
[41:28] life they are they share No throne with
[41:31] him their names must have been in the
[41:34] Book of Life and not removed
[41:37] so these ones that we just read of these
[41:39] righteous had their names in the book
[41:41] and was not removed
[41:43] these others had could have had their
[41:45] names and been removed
[41:47] or whenever in the book
[41:50] okay so never recorded there are those
[41:53] that will never be recorded
[41:55] either one way or the other
[41:57] but notice in the scripture we're going
[42:00] to read that a minute the books were
[42:01] opened
[42:02] the books that were opened is the life
[42:04] of those standing before the bride and
[42:07] the groom
[42:09] we are not in that judgment standing
[42:11] before that throne
[42:14] we are sitting in the throne
[42:16] the throne that the Judgment that we
[42:19] stand before is the is the Judgment for
[42:21] reward
[42:23] there's where we meet him on the throne
[42:26] amen but this white throne the bride is
[42:30] judging we'll we'll get into that
[42:32] scripture and I'm sure you're aware of
[42:33] it where it is some of these things I
[42:36] probably will bypass for time
[42:38] but just want you to know this
[42:41] so they're not
[42:42] these here are not his brother the
[42:44] Brethren is the bride all right on
[42:47] paragraph 106 of this message
[42:51] 106 107 and 108 106 he says
[42:56] we can we will actually show by
[42:59] scripture that multitudes and he's
[43:01] beginning this message he actually
[43:02] begins this on page 294. it's called the
[43:06] promise to the overcomer
[43:08] he said we will actually show by
[43:11] scripture that multitudes who were not
[43:13] even born again will go into eternal
[43:16] life
[43:18] that's hard to that's hard to understand
[43:19] isn't it
[43:21] but talk about Grace they had a position
[43:24] in the book but not bride position
[43:27] now we'll say that because there is
[43:30] another section of this book
[43:33] now he says here we'll go eternal life
[43:36] as strange as that may sound it is
[43:38] certainly true
[43:40] then we'll show that there is a group of
[43:42] people whose names have been placed in
[43:44] that record before the foundation of the
[43:45] world cannot under any circumstances
[43:48] have those names removed that's bride
[43:51] then there's no another group and I'll
[43:54] just read this because I'm going to take
[43:55] the time but names were on the record
[43:57] before the foundation world will have
[43:59] their names removed
[44:01] there's another group okay so now now we
[44:04] have but we're dealing here with two
[44:06] that are standing before the white
[44:08] Throne judgment unrighteous and
[44:10] righteous
[44:13] all right so paragraph 107 to begin with
[44:16] there is no basis for the claim that the
[44:18] Lamb's Book of Life is not the same as
[44:21] the Book of Life
[44:25] The Book of Life might be called the
[44:27] Lamb's Book of Life and if you want to
[44:30] clarify this even more let's go back to
[44:33] rising of the Sun
[44:35] and invisible Union
[44:38] and he talks about that but when he
[44:40] brings this
[44:42] fourth brother Branham said what I've
[44:43] written here is not my
[44:46] mind this is God's mind that wrote this
[44:50] amen this was of the Lord
[44:52] this is not William branham's thoughts
[44:54] all right so he says to be so there's no
[44:58] basis for the claims that the Lamb's
[45:00] Book of Life is not the same as the Book
[45:02] of Life The Book of Life might be called
[45:04] the Lamb's Book of Life or Christ's book
[45:06] of life even thy book and the Book of
[45:10] the living only names are written in it
[45:16] only names
[45:18] okay are written in it
[45:22] now paragraph 108 you can see that
[45:25] though there are other books mentioned
[45:27] there is always the reference to one
[45:30] book containing names
[45:34] in the Revelation it is called the
[45:36] Lamb's Book of Life or the book of life
[45:38] and where is this book located I won't
[45:41] take time with that but he takes the
[45:43] scriptures it's located in heaven
[45:45] all right now
[45:50] in Revelations chapter
[45:54] 20. let's go over there if you will with
[45:57] me very familiar scriptures Revelations
[45:59] chapter 20.
[46:01] and verse 11.
[46:03] as I said this is this isn't a sheltered
[46:06] message this is something that's just
[46:07] gonna
[46:09] bring some clarification to and there's
[46:12] a lot of there's a lot of
[46:14] misunderstanding in this
[46:17] a lot of men's interpretation to it too
[46:20] but
[46:22] and if and if you disagree that's fine
[46:25] I'm not gonna I'm not gonna hold you
[46:27] accountable I want to bring the portion
[46:29] God had me to bring here this tonight
[46:31] Revelations 20
[46:34] and verse 11 and I saw a great white
[46:36] throne
[46:37] and him that sat on it from whose face
[46:40] the earth and the heaven
[46:42] flood away
[46:43] and there was found no place for them
[46:46] and I saw the dead small and great stand
[46:49] before God there's your Nations
[46:52] and the books were opened and another
[46:54] book was opened which is The Book of
[46:56] Life and the dead were judged out of
[46:59] those things which were written in the
[47:01] books according to their works
[47:07] all right according to their works
[47:11] the bride will not be judged is not
[47:14] cannot will not be judged by works
[47:18] because her Works were already manifest
[47:21] in the Beloved
[47:22] she's already been accepted in him she's
[47:24] the elect
[47:26] this righteous we're speaking about
[47:28] standing Before the Throne is not elect
[47:32] not that they are elected to a position
[47:35] but I'm talking about the elect bride
[47:37] they're not the elected brother Brown
[47:39] said only the elect can be reborn
[47:43] can be born again so we know what we're
[47:46] speaking of here other words not saying
[47:48] that God didn't know and foreign them to
[47:50] a position their names remained on the
[47:52] book but they're not called in the
[47:54] scriptures the elect right all right so
[47:57] we we want to clarify that and so he
[48:00] said they're judged according they're
[48:03] written in the books according to their
[48:04] works now
[48:06] the books were opened I'm taking this
[48:08] out of a message the books were open he
[48:11] said that's the book of your life
[48:14] so those that were there the books
[48:16] opened I'm not we're speaking of others
[48:19] then the bride but it's still the books
[48:21] is your life
[48:23] so their life has become open you can't
[48:25] stand before that that judge and not
[48:29] have your books have your life wide open
[48:31] right brother bam said it would be shown
[48:33] before everybody
[48:35] I can't even imagine the multitudes I
[48:37] mean not beyond multitudes the millions
[48:41] maybe billions that would be there
[48:45] billions time may be trillions
[48:48] and how long would this take I you can
[48:51] only I can't even imagine how long the
[48:53] Judgment would take
[48:54] but what difference does it make the
[48:56] bride's sitting there with eternal life
[49:00] is that right okay so so we see here
[49:04] that that books is your life and every
[49:06] man was and every man was judged thus
[49:11] judge thus what
[49:13] by your life
[49:15] that was lived here all right and in
[49:18] only the book only contains names so if
[49:20] your life matched your name and your
[49:21] name's there
[49:23] you're going to be received
[49:26] if it wasn't or their name was removed
[49:30] you're cast into
[49:32] into
[49:34] the Lake of Fire
[49:36] all right
[49:38] so we want to be certain don't we you
[49:40] know there's no reason to go on this day
[49:42] and not be certain
[49:44] if we're sitting here and not certain of
[49:46] where we're standing we need to be
[49:48] certain not I hope so I hope so
[49:52] you have it's a no-so and God wants you
[49:54] to know
[49:57] so if there's a pull in your heart if
[49:58] there's a is there's a draw in your soul
[50:00] for more of God there's more of God for
[50:02] you if if you know that that has not
[50:05] been quickened into you that Christ has
[50:07] not become a genuine Revelation in you
[50:09] and you have met that person yet you
[50:12] need to meet it because that person is
[50:13] the token
[50:16] amen you have to have the token you must
[50:19] be born again
[50:21] you say well you you can't I can't over
[50:23] Express that
[50:25] I hope I trust the door isn't shut
[50:29] see there can still be those that can be
[50:31] born again
[50:33] but if you have that draw in you and you
[50:35] know you haven't met him yet because he
[50:38] is a revelation when there's a
[50:39] revelation you know it
[50:42] it's not something you don't know you
[50:43] know you have it
[50:45] and that revelation of himself and you
[50:48] is the evidence you're one of it of one
[50:50] of his and that you are him
[50:53] because there had to be a real gift in
[50:57] you that were here that Sunday when
[50:59] Minister there for the camp we spoke on
[51:01] the real gift
[51:03] the real gift is that seed land there in
[51:06] your soul that real gift is your soul
[51:09] amen so so we well this I won't get to
[51:13] preaching here I want to keep steady on
[51:15] my track here I won't get done all right
[51:17] now
[51:19] so we see here
[51:21] and in 13th verse and the Sea gave up
[51:24] the dead which were in it and the death
[51:25] and Hell delivered up the dead which
[51:27] were in them and they were judged every
[51:29] man according to their works and death
[51:31] and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire
[51:33] this is the second death and whosoever
[51:36] was not found written in the book
[51:38] singular of life was cast into the Lake
[51:42] of Fire how were they judged according
[51:44] to their works
[51:46] we read this in Matthew 25.
[51:50] all right brother Brown it's not my
[51:52] emphasis put on that he put that
[51:54] emphasis
[51:55] that's how they were judged
[51:58] all right now
[52:00] so I want to read
[52:03] and now I think we pretty well covered
[52:05] this is one yeah 130 131 yeah there will
[52:09] be both righteous unrighteous I think
[52:10] we've covered that these righteous will
[52:12] not be the bride for the bride sits with
[52:15] him in judgment I think we understand
[52:16] that
[52:18] so we're not standing before being
[52:20] judged we've already been judged
[52:22] see we've already been judged
[52:25] he said
[52:28] over here
[52:30] he said we've already that body that
[52:32] we're that we're birthed into by the
[52:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost That Body
[52:39] has already been judged
[52:43] amen he could not stand Us in judgment
[52:46] again because he's already judged that
[52:47] body
[52:48] amen that we're born into he said you're
[52:51] either in Christ or out of Christ amen
[52:54] you're either in that body or out of
[52:56] that body right here tonight there's no
[52:59] halfway in between
[53:01] you're either in it or you're out of it
[53:05] so no halfway between it there's no
[53:08] pretty good Christians now I want you to
[53:09] notice you say well I'll just be good to
[53:11] everybody and maybe I can get in that's
[53:13] not what he just read we just read they
[53:16] didn't even know it
[53:17] when they did when they visited him when
[53:20] they gave him drink when they did these
[53:21] things they didn't know it
[53:24] and there's multitudes of people we
[53:26] could go back and show many people
[53:28] through the Bible that were good to
[53:30] those elect
[53:32] amen and brother Brandon mentions a
[53:34] couple and I've got another one we got
[53:35] three here tonight we can mention
[53:39] see and and so we'll we'll go right
[53:41] along here so I just wanted to bring
[53:43] that out
[53:45] we don't stand before the Judgment we
[53:47] are now standing before that we are now
[53:49] standing before the judgment
[53:53] well then Brother David The book must
[53:55] been open it sure has
[53:59] the book has been opened and it's called
[54:01] the brother Branham called it the
[54:02] bride's book
[54:06] now their name was in that last book of
[54:08] life
[54:11] but bonus what I just read there have
[54:14] their name in there but those names of
[54:17] his bride could not be removed under any
[54:19] circumstance
[54:21] and brother Branham goes on to clarify
[54:23] that with what we want to get into or
[54:25] just a part of here tonight
[54:27] so I'm going to kind of combine this a
[54:29] little bit
[54:31] now
[54:32] so we read we read
[54:36] Matthew there
[54:41] and now let's go to I mean in
[54:43] Revelations now let's go to Daniel
[54:53] in Daniel the seventh chapter and the
[54:55] ninth verse I beheld till Thrones were
[54:58] cast down in the Ancient of Days did sit
[55:00] whose garment was white as snow and the
[55:04] hair of his head like pure wool he said
[55:06] why is that repeating again because he's
[55:08] in judgment
[55:11] okay his throne was like the fiery flame
[55:14] and his wheels is burning fire a fiery
[55:16] stream issued and came forth from before
[55:19] him now watch thousands thousands
[55:21] ministered unto him
[55:25] thousands thousands ministered unto him
[55:31] I had something on that I wanted just to
[55:38] yeah you see the bride is with him in
[55:40] the throne as she is the as she is to
[55:43] judge the world she she has to be
[55:46] sitting in judgment with him
[55:48] that's exactly what Daniel saw
[55:51] all right because that was the thousand
[55:53] thousand
[55:55] and I've got a quote in here but I'll
[55:56] just say it right out brother man said
[55:58] that thousand thousand was the bride
[56:00] that ministers to him
[56:02] okay and then it says There Were Ten
[56:05] thousands times ten thousands did what
[56:08] stood before him one ministered to him
[56:12] as a wife with her husband and the other
[56:15] was standing before him
[56:17] so we see the Ten Thousand Times Ten
[56:19] Thousand stood before him
[56:22] the Judgment was set and the books were
[56:25] opened
[56:27] okay they were judged according to their
[56:31] works
[56:32] I want you now I won't go to First
[56:34] Corinthians 6 23 only to make this
[56:36] statement
[56:38] that's where know you not that the
[56:40] Saints shall judge
[56:42] we could you could you read that many
[56:43] times that's that's first first
[56:46] Corinthians 6 1.
[56:48] and six two but there's a point I want
[56:51] to make here do you not know verse 2
[56:54] that the Saints so judge the world the
[56:58] world there is mankind
[57:01] so know ye not that the Saints shall
[57:04] judge mankind
[57:08] you see why we have to have character
[57:12] you see why we have to go through a
[57:14] shaping of that stone that stone that's
[57:16] unveiled in your soul
[57:19] that living Stone has to be shaped and
[57:22] cut why we wonder why we go so much
[57:24] pressures and trials and
[57:27] it's the shaping to shape you to your
[57:29] position in the body
[57:31] right you've been speaking about the
[57:32] major
[57:33] we have a measure of that faith we have
[57:37] a measure in the body that nobody can
[57:40] take our position or place as the bride
[57:42] see that Measure of Faith of what his
[57:45] faith
[57:46] Faith or what purpose whatever purpose
[57:48] he had placed you in the body to do
[57:52] amen
[57:53] all right
[57:54] so we know that the that we'll judge
[57:57] mankind he goes on to say can't we judge
[57:59] the smallest matters in the church
[58:02] see see why can't we judge if we've been
[58:05] called to a certain job why aren't we
[58:06] doing it
[58:10] called to a deacon called to a trustee
[58:12] why don't you do it
[58:15] what's wrong where's your judgment
[58:17] where's your discernment
[58:22] he said that's pretty strong Brother
[58:23] David yeah I know it but it's the truth
[58:28] amen amen if you if he chose you for a
[58:31] place I would do everything I could
[58:33] that'd be first thing in my life do what
[58:35] I should do according to his will and
[58:37] where is this will known we've had a
[58:39] we've had a Prophet come and bring us
[58:41] the order
[58:43] we need to consult him
[58:46] I have a message I'd like to bring later
[58:48] it's called Uh do order
[58:51] but it that would be a little strong
[58:54] but but who would what did David fail to
[58:58] to to to to consult
[59:01] Nathan
[59:03] but he consulted captains he consulted
[59:06] the the people
[59:08] find out what their opinions were find
[59:11] out what you don't need to know your
[59:13] opinion if you're not sure of where
[59:14] you're standing why it's standing there
[59:16] you need to find out be sure
[59:21] amen amen but but he went the wrong way
[59:24] and by doing so he did not do according
[59:27] to what the word said to do and Nathan
[59:29] would have showed him what to do to the
[59:31] right way to bring the ark to move the
[59:33] ark how was it moved
[59:36] they put it on a new cart we don't need
[59:38] this arc on a new cart
[59:41] just put it upon the hearts of the
[59:43] fivefold ministry where it belongs
[59:46] and Let It Be Moved feed the sheep see
[59:50] we don't need to find out whether
[59:53] whether we're called or not God oughta
[59:55] already told you that
[59:58] all right I'll get off of my soapbox
[1:00:00] here
[1:00:02] all right let's go to let's go to Second
[1:00:04] Peter
[1:00:06] chapter 3.
[1:00:10] second Peter chapter 3 and I want to
[1:00:13] read over here in just a minute and yeah
[1:00:15] I already did that okay
[1:00:17] yeah
[1:00:18] those those righteous stood and
[1:00:21] unrighteous stood before him in the
[1:00:23] Judgment according to Daniel
[1:00:25] okay second Peter 3 and if that if we
[1:00:28] find out
[1:00:30] that here
[1:00:33] that these people
[1:00:35] these these righteous and unrighteous
[1:00:38] did not know what they were doing
[1:00:41] I mean they did not know that they
[1:00:43] visited us and did with those things
[1:00:46] and you probably can tell have people in
[1:00:49] your lives that were very good to you I
[1:00:51] don't I'm not claiming I can't judge
[1:00:53] whether they do but that day they will
[1:00:56] be judged
[1:00:57] their heart will come open their lives
[1:00:59] will be open what was your motive
[1:01:01] objective see why did you do that
[1:01:04] because it was in my heart to do it Lord
[1:01:07] here enter in
[1:01:10] it was done that was proven right there
[1:01:12] in the Judgment but Lord yeah did you
[1:01:15] meet this certain a certain time and
[1:01:16] this person did such and such yes Lord
[1:01:18] here it is
[1:01:23] amen you see
[1:01:25] we can't put God In The Box and limit
[1:01:27] him we've got to realize he knows these
[1:01:29] Hearts he knows whose names are going to
[1:01:31] remain and who's they're taking off and
[1:01:33] and whose names are not there see he
[1:01:35] knows it but their works are going to
[1:01:37] declare it
[1:01:40] all right now
[1:01:42] so in second Peter I just wanted to read
[1:01:45] this because in the
[1:01:47] in the um
[1:01:50] well if I can find second Peter here get
[1:01:53] to it
[1:01:55] okay second Peter
[1:02:00] and it's in chapter 3 verse 11. no verse
[1:02:04] 10. but the day of the Lord will come as
[1:02:07] a thief in the night in the which the
[1:02:10] heavens shall pass away with a great
[1:02:12] noise and the elements shall melt with
[1:02:14] fervent heat the Earth also and the
[1:02:16] works that are therein shall be burned
[1:02:18] up seeing them that we have seeing then
[1:02:21] that all these things shall be dissolved
[1:02:23] what manner of persons ought you to be
[1:02:26] that's what I want to come to what is
[1:02:28] the bride to be what man or person ought
[1:02:30] to bride to be she's the very
[1:02:32] manifestation of the word promise for
[1:02:34] this hour what is the word promise for
[1:02:36] the Hour the full revelation of Jesus
[1:02:39] Christ
[1:02:42] amen so she's that promised word
[1:02:47] and and and with Christ in you which is
[1:02:50] God poured himself into Christ Christ
[1:02:52] became the revelation of God
[1:02:54] is that right that was the revelation of
[1:02:57] God but if Christ be in you what does it
[1:02:59] make you the complete revelation of the
[1:03:01] whole thing because Christ
[1:03:04] in you
[1:03:06] makes you the revelation
[1:03:09] of Christ
[1:03:12] so it's the whole thing
[1:03:15] amen oh man I'll just drop that in for
[1:03:17] extra minutes so what manner of people
[1:03:19] ought we to be in all holy conversation
[1:03:21] and godliness so so what manner of life
[1:03:24] we're living
[1:03:26] what's going to happen with these
[1:03:27] there's some that are going to see
[1:03:29] something they don't know what it is but
[1:03:31] they have it in their heart to do for
[1:03:33] you the right thing and they do that
[1:03:36] talk about God's grace
[1:03:38] talk about talk about uh God knowing who
[1:03:43] they are and put it in their heart to do
[1:03:45] a certain thing
[1:03:46] knowing they would do it brought them
[1:03:48] around to it to see them do it
[1:03:51] and then turn right around and give them
[1:03:53] life for doing it
[1:03:55] think of that
[1:03:58] yeah see that's talk about Grace
[1:04:01] all right but we're not saved by works
[1:04:04] of man we're saved by grace through
[1:04:06] faith
[1:04:07] not grace alone but grace through faith
[1:04:09] it's the grace of God to reveal to you
[1:04:12] the word the evidence the evidence is
[1:04:15] the revelation of himself living in you
[1:04:17] and you grow up into him see that's why
[1:04:20] we had to have a message of the opening
[1:04:21] of seals because if it didn't come if a
[1:04:23] message didn't come Beyond Pentecost
[1:04:27] then we're all in trouble
[1:04:31] because there was a book opened there
[1:04:34] amen and that's why the prophet could
[1:04:36] say we're standing judgment now well
[1:04:38] then what did the book tell us
[1:04:40] what did it speak of the Bride their
[1:04:43] names are there
[1:04:44] what does it speak to you
[1:04:47] case dismissed
[1:04:49] there's no case to it
[1:04:52] you're free
[1:04:54] there's not even not even a record that
[1:04:56] you even once sinned you were Justified
[1:04:58] to begin with
[1:05:00] accepted into beloved everything you
[1:05:03] needed was in Christ
[1:05:05] amen and Christ in you is the genuine
[1:05:08] relevance of the Revelation revealed in
[1:05:10] you
[1:05:11] that you are him
[1:05:16] okay I'm starting to preach here and I
[1:05:17] got to get back in track all right so I
[1:05:20] wanted to bring that out
[1:05:21] that that this is that what manner of
[1:05:25] people ought we to be now I could read a
[1:05:26] lot in that but you can read it they'll
[1:05:29] just see let me see if I want to go
[1:05:30] further here
[1:05:32] um
[1:05:34] yeah looking for and hastening unto the
[1:05:36] coming of the day of God wherein the
[1:05:39] heavens shall be on fire Heavens being
[1:05:40] on fire shall be dissolved and the
[1:05:42] elements shall melt with fervent heat
[1:05:44] nevertheless we according to his promise
[1:05:47] look for a new heavens and new earth
[1:05:49] wherein dwelleth righteousness beloved
[1:05:52] seeing that you look for such things be
[1:05:54] diligent
[1:05:55] that you may be found in him in peace
[1:05:58] without spot
[1:06:00] Oh Brother David there's nobody around
[1:06:02] here without spot I beg your pardon this
[1:06:04] bride is without spot because she's in
[1:06:07] Christ she's in the sinless one making
[1:06:09] her sinless
[1:06:12] sure we have mistakes and failures but
[1:06:14] God's not judging it by that since the
[1:06:16] blood covenants come he's judging this
[1:06:18] by the witness of the Holy Ghost in US
[1:06:21] the life of that blood
[1:06:25] and as long as that's there the blood's
[1:06:27] showing that's the token
[1:06:29] that's why the toke is not preached very
[1:06:31] much
[1:06:33] because the token you must have the
[1:06:34] token the only way you can get in the
[1:06:36] Rapture is by the token having the token
[1:06:39] you have you have already your clearance
[1:06:41] the token is your clearance
[1:06:44] amen amen amen hallelujah that's right
[1:06:48] okay now so I just but what matter
[1:06:52] people ought we to be because in the
[1:06:54] matter if we are here to be the very
[1:06:55] manifestation of Christ
[1:06:58] that is Who We Are
[1:07:02] amen
[1:07:04] not who we are here who I am here this
[1:07:08] real gift is who I am
[1:07:10] yeah
[1:07:12] amen the baptism was the temporal gift
[1:07:14] but the temporal gift quickened the seed
[1:07:16] inside of me a seed predestinated land
[1:07:18] there to life and that's Christ in me
[1:07:24] that's why I can't disbelieve the word
[1:07:28] that's why I can't disbelieve a perfect
[1:07:30] interpretation of that word because
[1:07:32] without without Christ in you you have
[1:07:35] nothing but letter and the letter can
[1:07:36] kill you we're not Ministers of the
[1:07:38] letter we're Ministers of the spirit the
[1:07:40] life of this Bible the life of the
[1:07:42] letter
[1:07:43] we can't know this life we can't know
[1:07:45] the thought behind this letter this
[1:07:47] letter is God in written form that's
[1:07:49] true and we know it's the truth but
[1:07:52] without the Holy Ghost in you how are
[1:07:54] you going to know what this is saying
[1:07:56] because the Holy Ghost in you would
[1:07:57] would acknowledge and receive what a
[1:08:00] prophet has already said because the
[1:08:02] words come to him
[1:08:06] the interpretation of this hour the
[1:08:08] words come to him
[1:08:11] the seventh angel message revealed the
[1:08:13] Mysteries it's those Mysteries that
[1:08:15] would literally turn your heart to the
[1:08:17] original Faith it's the revelation of
[1:08:19] those Mysteries the book was open John
[1:08:22] even read about him and still in symbol
[1:08:24] form but the book was open but the
[1:08:26] Revelation wasn't there and when John
[1:08:28] heard those seven Thunders utter their
[1:08:31] voices which is the Revelation contained
[1:08:33] in those seals
[1:08:35] see Revelation contained in those seals
[1:08:38] he was commanded to seal it up seal it
[1:08:40] up and when the seventh Seal Seal Seal
[1:08:43] it up was opened it was silent why
[1:08:45] because it wasn't written but in the
[1:08:47] days of the seventh angel the mystery of
[1:08:49] God would be finished
[1:08:52] because the silence denotes a secret
[1:08:56] and only the bride can receive that
[1:08:58] secret
[1:09:00] because the secret is in the public show
[1:09:02] it's revealed in you
[1:09:05] it doesn't come with observation it
[1:09:07] comes by revelation
[1:09:09] it's lived out and that's what if it's
[1:09:11] lived out there's some that can receive
[1:09:13] it not even knowing what they're doing
[1:09:15] but will do a heaven their heart to do
[1:09:17] for you hardly even knowing you or visit
[1:09:20] you or give you water we don't know as
[1:09:23] the further we go along who will step in
[1:09:25] the scene and a hard time we may have to
[1:09:27] go through and provide for you
[1:09:30] do for you
[1:09:33] because they saw they they saw they saw
[1:09:36] they didn't know what it was
[1:09:38] but they had it in their heart to do it
[1:09:41] that's what this is speaking of there's
[1:09:44] going to be those people standing before
[1:09:45] you someday
[1:09:48] amen all right so
[1:09:51] okay Saint John 5 24. let's go over
[1:09:54] there very quickly as we're running here
[1:09:57] a little bit here 5 24. very familiar
[1:10:00] scriptures verily verily I say unto you
[1:10:03] he that heareth my word heareth there is
[1:10:06] receiving he that heareth my word has an
[1:10:09] ear to hear heareth my word
[1:10:11] and believeth on him that sent me
[1:10:15] hath everlasting life
[1:10:18] and shall not come into judgment
[1:10:21] condemnation which is Judgment but is
[1:10:24] passed from Death unto life
[1:10:28] amen you see right there they've already
[1:10:31] got life
[1:10:34] brother Branham and quoting that
[1:10:35] scripture said verily verily I say unto
[1:10:37] you he that heareth my word and
[1:10:39] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:10:40] everlasting life and then the prophet
[1:10:42] says that is the believer is already the
[1:10:46] recipient of eternal life
[1:10:48] because he say why because he's able to
[1:10:51] receive he's able to hear the word
[1:10:55] so he has a real gift on the inside a
[1:10:58] genuine seed there to receive it
[1:11:01] the outpouring of the life the
[1:11:03] outpouring of the Holy Spirit see the
[1:11:05] only way you can be birthed is the
[1:11:07] seedest to be there
[1:11:09] amen
[1:11:12] amen so we're going Beyond an anointing
[1:11:14] on your spirit we're going down beyond
[1:11:16] that Veil
[1:11:18] the real gift lays in there
[1:11:22] hallelujah or we would say in that
[1:11:25] little room
[1:11:26] you come out with something you can't
[1:11:28] explain
[1:11:31] why because it's not revealed to
[1:11:33] everybody but you
[1:11:36] Hallelujah but we preach revelation we
[1:11:39] preach faith
[1:11:41] amen
[1:11:43] and God will have to Quicken it
[1:11:47] we're not sponsible for what they do
[1:11:48] with it it's responsibility of preaching
[1:11:51] it
[1:11:52] they that have an ear to hear they're
[1:11:53] going to receive it because they're
[1:11:54] already a recipient of eternal life
[1:11:58] which brother Brown said which he has in
[1:12:01] his possession now
[1:12:05] my where's the fear then where's your
[1:12:08] anxiety about tomorrow about the next
[1:12:10] day or about what you got to do or don't
[1:12:12] do let God do the take care of it what
[1:12:14] you go through
[1:12:16] where's our trust
[1:12:19] all right now
[1:12:21] and shall not come into condemnation
[1:12:23] shall not come into the judgments
[1:12:26] judgment is what it really means but is
[1:12:29] passed permanently passed permanently
[1:12:31] from Death unto life
[1:12:34] my that's wonderful
[1:12:36] we could say Amen go home right there
[1:12:37] we've passed permanently brother Paul we
[1:12:40] pass permanently
[1:12:41] brothers sisters
[1:12:43] you that are born again we've passed
[1:12:45] permanently
[1:12:47] from death into life
[1:12:51] my my notice okay
[1:12:54] but notice carefully paragraph 135 Jesus
[1:12:58] must have yet another group in mind who
[1:13:01] had a certain Resurrection will receive
[1:13:04] eternal life at a certain Resurrection
[1:13:06] we're going to come into this now in
[1:13:08] Saint John 5 28.
[1:13:10] now he says not having previously
[1:13:13] received it as a member of the Bride
[1:13:16] they receive it
[1:13:18] at a future
[1:13:20] time
[1:13:22] at another Resurrection
[1:13:24] all right now
[1:13:26] now Saint John 5 28 Marvel not at this
[1:13:32] for the hour is coming
[1:13:37] in which all a Double L
[1:13:43] which all
[1:13:45] that are in the graves so it's not
[1:13:49] pertaining to the bride
[1:13:52] you say well it could be this is first
[1:13:54] written no not all come up in the first
[1:13:57] resurrection
[1:14:01] all the elect do
[1:14:02] all the bride does but watch what the
[1:14:05] prophet says about this scripture
[1:14:08] he says now
[1:14:09] all that are in the graves will hear his
[1:14:12] voice
[1:14:13] and shall come forth they that have done
[1:14:16] good
[1:14:17] unto the resurrection of Life what's in
[1:14:20] you what are they doing good to the
[1:14:23] resurrection of life
[1:14:28] who are you what a resurrection this is
[1:14:31] what a resurrection that was when I
[1:14:33] raised with him but what a
[1:14:35] resurrectionist is to prove I raised
[1:14:37] with him
[1:14:39] amen all right
[1:14:42] now he says and shall come forth they
[1:14:45] that have done good unto the
[1:14:46] resurrection of life and they that have
[1:14:48] done evil unto the resurrection of
[1:14:51] damnation
[1:14:52] now we all know now listen to what he
[1:14:55] said paragraph 136 page 311. now we all
[1:14:58] know that John 5 28-29 is not the
[1:15:03] rapture
[1:15:05] it's not the first resurrection
[1:15:09] for only the dead in Christ will rise
[1:15:12] from the graves at that time along with
[1:15:14] the living bride who is still on Earth
[1:15:16] then he quotes the scripture which I
[1:15:18] won't quote in first Thessalonians 4 16
[1:15:20] through 17.
[1:15:23] all right
[1:15:24] now that's all
[1:15:28] so we look at the all
[1:15:37] now the question arises why are these
[1:15:40] righteous within the Judgment there's no
[1:15:41] place that they can come up
[1:15:43] for they are but but there are but two
[1:15:46] resurrections and since they do not
[1:15:48] qualify for the first resurrection they
[1:15:50] must come up in the second
[1:15:53] which is a resurrection unto judgment
[1:15:58] amen
[1:15:59] all right the ones who qualify for the
[1:16:02] first resurrection the bride are not in
[1:16:04] the judgment
[1:16:06] all right you see how secret this
[1:16:09] this
[1:16:10] uh taking away the bride is
[1:16:14] in fact it's happening
[1:16:17] we just don't haven't come to our climax
[1:16:19] yet
[1:16:20] it's taking place but brother Brown
[1:16:23] called it a secret catching away
[1:16:26] well brother Dave you don't have to be
[1:16:28] so secret about it I'm not secret about
[1:16:30] it he's the secret about it
[1:16:33] he's veiled but it's happening and and
[1:16:37] and we could prove that in the scripture
[1:16:39] if we had time see we don't have time
[1:16:41] so so we'll just keep on going now so
[1:16:45] but he goes on to say that all
[1:16:48] is not of course we we know that it's
[1:16:50] not
[1:16:52] it's everyone everybody both
[1:16:54] whatever they are of all Nations
[1:16:57] everything will come alive again
[1:17:00] at the second Resurrection for judgment
[1:17:04] so you think well I will resurrect I'll
[1:17:07] just go yo yeah you will you'll be
[1:17:08] somewhere until that time
[1:17:11] right that's exactly right
[1:17:14] amen all right so and nothing's going to
[1:17:17] be hid You Can't Hide a thing
[1:17:21] Hallelujah
[1:17:22] all right now
[1:17:27] yeah he says here all are going to come
[1:17:30] forth in the grave this is the very same
[1:17:31] Resurrection is spoken of in Revelations
[1:17:33] 20 where the dead were brought forth
[1:17:36] before the Lord and judged according to
[1:17:37] their works so we see that's what that
[1:17:39] is
[1:17:50] though it seems thus we may not
[1:17:52] discredit the words of Jesus who most
[1:17:55] pointedly sets forth that there are some
[1:17:57] found in the Book of Life who will
[1:17:59] either receive eternal life before the
[1:18:01] general Resurrection or after it
[1:18:05] there's going to be some receive it
[1:18:07] afterwards
[1:18:09] all right
[1:18:12] okay
[1:18:14] now
[1:18:15] in paragraph 148 we see that there's we
[1:18:19] see
[1:18:21] okay let me go on here paragraph 141.
[1:18:27] and I won't be too much longer 141. the
[1:18:30] first resurrection has nothing to do
[1:18:32] with the second death
[1:18:34] that is at the end of the Thousand Years
[1:18:37] when all the rest of the Dead live again
[1:18:39] and in that day there will be those who
[1:18:42] come forth to eternal life and those
[1:18:43] others who are caught in the second
[1:18:45] death now and those and now we do not
[1:18:49] need to guess about those in the second
[1:18:51] Resurrection or a given life we are told
[1:18:53] that is given to them watch this we are
[1:18:56] told
[1:18:57] you're talking about the righteous there
[1:18:59] before the in this in the Judgment we
[1:19:01] are told it is given to them those on
[1:19:03] his right
[1:19:04] on the grounds that they've been kind
[1:19:07] and good to the brothers
[1:19:11] okay paragraph 141 page 312.
[1:19:14] those who raise who are raised and cast
[1:19:17] in the Lake of Fire will be so treated
[1:19:19] because of their mistreatment
[1:19:22] of the brethren
[1:19:26] since this is the word of God we simply
[1:19:28] accept it there's no argument here it's
[1:19:30] just simply a statement of fact
[1:19:33] okay
[1:19:36] now paragraph 143
[1:19:45] upon what ground do they enter into life
[1:19:49] Eternal certainly not upon the fact that
[1:19:51] they already have it
[1:19:52] already have his life as does the bride
[1:19:54] but they receive it because they were
[1:19:57] kind to his Brethren they are not his
[1:20:01] Brethren now I've mentioned this before
[1:20:03] okay but their names must have been in
[1:20:05] the Book of Life and not removed now
[1:20:08] because of now watch what he says about
[1:20:10] these he said but because of their love
[1:20:12] of the people of God they weren't bad
[1:20:14] people
[1:20:15] but because they were their love for the
[1:20:18] people of God
[1:20:20] they knew why they did what they did but
[1:20:22] look at love being expressed yeah yeah
[1:20:25] to Christ yeah as much as the least of
[1:20:28] these you've done it unto me
[1:20:30] all right he said
[1:20:32] he said now not I said but because of
[1:20:34] their love of the people of God they are
[1:20:37] recognized and saved
[1:20:40] they're not saved before here
[1:20:43] you're saved later
[1:20:45] he said he said no doubt they served and
[1:20:49] helped the children of God perhaps like
[1:20:52] Nicodemus
[1:20:54] and Gamaliel
[1:20:57] I don't have to go into what Gamaliel
[1:20:58] did they stood up for him didn't he
[1:21:01] yeah let's just wait on here a little
[1:21:02] bit if this things of God that come to
[1:21:04] not I mean if the God we can't fight
[1:21:06] against it
[1:21:07] see what did he do he was good to those
[1:21:09] people
[1:21:11] when did we do this see all right see
[1:21:15] see they stood for the children in time
[1:21:18] of trouble if this seems to smack a
[1:21:21] restoration which caught carefully now
[1:21:23] for the wicked are not restored but
[1:21:25] turned into the Lake of Fire their names
[1:21:29] of many of those destroyed were in The
[1:21:31] Book of Life also because they were
[1:21:33] blotted out because they failed to honor
[1:21:36] the people of God who were
[1:21:39] here's Peter now who were the Living
[1:21:42] manifested Word
[1:21:46] they met the word
[1:21:48] you see what manner of people we ought
[1:21:50] to be
[1:21:52] we ought to be feeding on this open book
[1:21:54] every day we ought to be drawing night
[1:21:55] of God every day through prayer and
[1:21:58] through reading of the scriptures
[1:22:00] and through feeding on the words yeah
[1:22:01] but I don't have time then you better
[1:22:03] make time
[1:22:04] you better redeem the time
[1:22:07] amen we've got a decision to make then
[1:22:10] something's got to have priority in your
[1:22:12] life
[1:22:13] something is going to have priority and
[1:22:16] if it isn't the word what is it and if
[1:22:17] it's not the word it's an idol
[1:22:20] you place something over the head of
[1:22:22] this word
[1:22:25] amen that's so easy to do because we're
[1:22:28] creatures of humanness and we reason we
[1:22:30] do this and that but greater is he that
[1:22:33] is in you that keeps you
[1:22:36] all right we'll make you know what
[1:22:38] you're doing
[1:22:39] then what are we going to do if we love
[1:22:41] him obey
[1:22:44] die to ourselves take up our cross daily
[1:22:46] and follow him
[1:22:49] oh but Lord you don't know the
[1:22:50] circumstance if I follow you how many
[1:22:52] came to brother Brown said we would do
[1:22:53] that we know you're telling the truth
[1:22:55] we'd do it but we'd lose our income we
[1:22:57] would do this we would do that
[1:23:00] is it what means more to you
[1:23:03] than that which they stayed with become
[1:23:06] their Idol
[1:23:08] an idolatrous spirit because something
[1:23:10] came before them other than the word
[1:23:13] taking preeminence
[1:23:15] they had the opportunity
[1:23:19] how many in this message had the
[1:23:20] opportunity and then turned around and
[1:23:22] rejected where are their names
[1:23:25] you see I'm not putting everybody under
[1:23:27] under that I don't know who can still
[1:23:29] come back and not that's not my business
[1:23:31] but I'm talking about it the judgment
[1:23:34] there's going to be those that
[1:23:36] will be there
[1:23:39] okay now
[1:23:42] the foolish virgins they will be judged
[1:23:45] in the second Resurrection we know that
[1:23:47] because they fail to get oil
[1:23:49] they don't come up in the first
[1:23:50] resurrection
[1:23:55] all right see
[1:23:58] and we know that their soul is under the
[1:24:00] altar the Jews
[1:24:02] given white robes when second
[1:24:04] Resurrection judgment
[1:24:08] there are two records of two judgments
[1:24:10] only one see see where Cass I'm talking
[1:24:13] about two two no record of two judgments
[1:24:17] set where the wicked are cast in the
[1:24:19] Lake of Fire let me make sure we're
[1:24:20] clear on that
[1:24:22] only the beasts and false prophet are
[1:24:24] judged at the end in the in of the Great
[1:24:26] Tribulation they're Cast Away
[1:24:28] no this is the white Throne judgment and
[1:24:31] they are judged according to what is
[1:24:33] written in the books
[1:24:35] all right now
[1:24:38] so he goes on to say the Jews will be
[1:24:40] there and I will go into all that
[1:24:42] right now because that's they'll be
[1:24:45] there 140 4 000 are sealed we know in
[1:24:49] their time of receiving the message like
[1:24:53] we had what are we sealed under
[1:24:57] amen
[1:24:59] all right
[1:25:02] okay paragraph 148 314 page it is the
[1:25:06] second Resurrection where the five
[1:25:08] foolish virgins come up notice they were
[1:25:11] virgins they did not have the Holy
[1:25:12] Spirit so they missed being in the bride
[1:25:16] a brother but brother I've shouted I've
[1:25:18] danced I've cast out devils
[1:25:21] I still don't mean you have it in your
[1:25:23] soul the word
[1:25:25] you can do all those things under the
[1:25:27] anointing genuine anointing of the Holy
[1:25:29] Ghost
[1:25:31] but never go beyond that Veil
[1:25:34] now if we don't go Beyond the Veil
[1:25:36] there's no Resurrection first
[1:25:39] Rapture say you've got to go behind the
[1:25:41] veil
[1:25:43] but the veil's been rant
[1:25:47] and it's coming full view of who
[1:25:50] the bride
[1:25:52] what's coming full of you The Mercy Seat
[1:25:56] the Shekinah
[1:25:57] the bread laying there ready to be
[1:25:59] ripened
[1:26:01] amen all right we could go allotted
[1:26:03] that's another message
[1:26:05] okay notice so but these people These
[1:26:10] Foolish virgin being as separated they
[1:26:12] are a separated god-loving people and
[1:26:15] trying to abide in the word according to
[1:26:18] what they knew of it and being a help in
[1:26:20] the work of the Lord will come up at the
[1:26:24] end of time
[1:26:25] they will miss the millennium
[1:26:28] which you can begin to see by these
[1:26:30] truths is much more important and
[1:26:32] wonderful than we have ever thought or
[1:26:34] believed
[1:26:35] amen all these people had their names in
[1:26:38] The Book of Life and their names
[1:26:39] remained
[1:26:41] and whose names did not remain those of
[1:26:44] the world system churches who fought the
[1:26:46] bride
[1:26:47] will be those whose names are removed
[1:26:49] they will the that is who will lose out
[1:26:52] they will be they will be cast in the
[1:26:55] leg of fire now going back to gamalia
[1:26:57] and and where I mentioned that Nicodemus
[1:26:59] he mentions Camellia let's turn over
[1:27:01] here just a moment
[1:27:03] to another scripture in Timothy
[1:27:09] see they were good and kind
[1:27:11] to the brethren now let me just
[1:27:14] get the couple of these real quick
[1:27:18] in paragraph 161
[1:27:23] he says
[1:27:24] and if there are those who will enter
[1:27:27] into life eternal after the white Throne
[1:27:29] judgment solely
[1:27:31] Now watch how they enter into life
[1:27:33] eternal if they enter into life eternal
[1:27:35] at the white Throne judgment
[1:27:37] solely on the grounds of being good and
[1:27:40] kind and just to the elect of God who
[1:27:42] are his Brethren then we cannot but
[1:27:45] accept that
[1:27:46] think of what the other judge
[1:27:49] okay
[1:27:52] so or who hath knoweth the mind of the
[1:27:54] Lord that he should instruct him rather
[1:27:57] let us be subject in faith to him who is
[1:27:59] our father and live so in paragraph
[1:28:02] that's 161 and 172.
[1:28:06] or once 72 yes there then we had
[1:28:11] previously shown there are those who
[1:28:13] stood for the bride and were an aid and
[1:28:15] comfort to her those had their names
[1:28:17] remaining on the book of life and go
[1:28:19] into life Everlasting
[1:28:22] amen all right
[1:28:25] so now
[1:28:28] in Timothy second Timothy
[1:28:33] second Timothy
[1:28:36] let's go over here
[1:28:38] and read what Paul said about a certain
[1:28:41] person starting
[1:28:43] with the 14th verse
[1:28:46] the Lord give Mercy unto the house of
[1:28:52] uh oh this is second Timothy one excuse
[1:28:55] me 116.
[1:28:58] the Lord give Mercy unto the house of
[1:29:00] anisrus for he oft refreshed me
[1:29:04] and was not ashamed of my chain
[1:29:08] wow
[1:29:10] well watch what he goes on to say but
[1:29:12] when he was in Rome he sought me out
[1:29:15] very diligently he's writing this in
[1:29:17] prison Paul is
[1:29:19] to Timothy he said but but when he was
[1:29:22] in Rome he sought me out very diligently
[1:29:24] and found me the Lord grant watch this
[1:29:27] the Lord grant unto him that he might
[1:29:30] find Mercy of the Lord in that day
[1:29:37] and how many things he ministered unto
[1:29:40] me at Ephesus thou knowest very well
[1:29:44] my
[1:29:45] all right okay now
[1:29:52] so we know that we've already been
[1:29:54] through that about those that are cast
[1:29:56] in in the message
[1:29:58] another message here in paragraph 349 if
[1:30:01] you want the date I can give it to you
[1:30:02] and you people with these saw blade
[1:30:05] tempers
[1:30:06] that's always spouting off in the mouth
[1:30:08] of somebody can't put up and things like
[1:30:10] that be careful you're guilty if you
[1:30:12] speak a word against your brother that's
[1:30:14] not right not just go around and tear it
[1:30:18] down
[1:30:20] not just go around and tear it down you
[1:30:22] don't have to stick a knife in a man's
[1:30:23] back to kill him
[1:30:25] you can break his character and kill him
[1:30:28] kill his influence speak against your
[1:30:31] pastor here say something bad about him
[1:30:34] you just might as well have shot him
[1:30:38] told something
[1:30:40] that wasn't right about him well it'll
[1:30:43] kill his influence with the people and
[1:30:44] things like that and you're guilty of it
[1:30:46] what Jesus said
[1:30:49] what manner of people are we to be God
[1:30:52] help us
[1:30:54] amen
[1:30:57] even what you think what you talk about
[1:30:59] in your secret places
[1:31:03] remember God's your thoughts speak
[1:31:05] louder in heaven than your words
[1:31:08] amen that's the truth
[1:31:10] and brother sister we're guilty but
[1:31:12] let's make it right if we see we're
[1:31:14] guilty that's what I meant by our hearts
[1:31:16] condemning us if God's in your heart and
[1:31:18] you do something wrong and that Prophet
[1:31:20] said I knew I did wrong he went to pray
[1:31:22] for that baby and his heart condemned
[1:31:24] him he said how can you pray for that
[1:31:25] baby when you need to go and make
[1:31:27] something right first
[1:31:30] see we're talking about the Holy Ghost
[1:31:31] In You will will make that known to you
[1:31:35] then go get it right you can't wait to
[1:31:37] get it right that's the Holy Ghost
[1:31:39] working in you
[1:31:42] amen all right now
[1:31:47] so names that remained on The Book of
[1:31:49] Life okay and then include the Jews now
[1:31:52] the last thing I'm going to do and I'm
[1:31:53] closing
[1:31:56] I want to just go through some things
[1:31:57] where is the names of the Bride found
[1:32:02] haha
[1:32:03] amen they're written in the book aren't
[1:32:05] they I may would say they're written in
[1:32:07] the last book of life they are
[1:32:10] but where in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:32:15] all right you say well then they're
[1:32:17] they're somewhere well they're in a
[1:32:19] portion aren't they
[1:32:21] there's something there that they are
[1:32:23] they are the whole word
[1:32:25] but watch what the prophet said I want
[1:32:26] to share this with you and then we're
[1:32:28] done
[1:32:29] okay the first one I want to go to is
[1:32:31] paragraph 150.
[1:32:33] and that's now let us go another step
[1:32:35] but before we do let us review our case
[1:32:38] thus far first of all we know most
[1:32:41] assuredly that the purpose of God stands
[1:32:44] in the election I'm going to speak about
[1:32:46] purpose tonight it was purposed in
[1:32:48] himself it was purpose in himself I just
[1:32:52] love that don't you just love that you
[1:32:55] were purposing himself
[1:33:00] it was God's purpose to bring forth a
[1:33:03] people like unto himself that would be a
[1:33:05] word bride she was chosen before the
[1:33:08] foundation of the world in him
[1:33:11] my what a what what a wonderful
[1:33:14] revelation
[1:33:16] let that be revealed to you one time
[1:33:18] where you come from then you'll know
[1:33:19] where you're going
[1:33:22] you know where you're going you know who
[1:33:24] you are you know where you come from you
[1:33:26] know who you are and if you know where
[1:33:27] you come from you know where you're
[1:33:28] going
[1:33:30] all right now she was foreknown and
[1:33:32] beloved before that she was ever brought
[1:33:35] forth during the ages upon the Earth
[1:33:37] she was Redeemed by his blood bought
[1:33:40] purchasing his property can but he's got
[1:33:43] to come forth
[1:33:45] taking the book
[1:33:47] marriage has come takes the book just
[1:33:49] like the Kinsmen Boaz had to take Ruth
[1:33:56] he took the book
[1:33:58] our Kinsmen he takes the book and makes
[1:34:01] claim on his redeemed
[1:34:04] what a happening for us in this hours
[1:34:06] why we put so much emphasis on these
[1:34:09] Seven Seals
[1:34:12] because that revelation of those
[1:34:14] Mysteries that absolutely
[1:34:17] going into one full mystery
[1:34:21] amen it's absolutely the very thing that
[1:34:24] turns literally turns the heart the
[1:34:26] Revelation contained in those seals
[1:34:28] which were sealed up is now revealed
[1:34:34] amen
[1:34:36] will literally turn the hearts of the
[1:34:38] children the seed
[1:34:40] to the original faith
[1:34:42] which is what God's own faith
[1:34:48] all right now
[1:34:50] so where are the names okay where are
[1:34:52] they found so we paragraph 150 we're
[1:34:54] reading she was see it before she ever
[1:34:57] came on the earth she was for known
[1:34:59] beloved she was Redeemed by the blood
[1:35:01] can never come to mind the condemnation
[1:35:02] judgment she can never be in the
[1:35:04] Judgment because sin cannot be imputed
[1:35:07] unto her
[1:35:08] praise the Lord
[1:35:10] amen
[1:35:12] but paragraph 151 this is on page 315
[1:35:16] but indeed she will be with him in his
[1:35:20] throne of judgment judging the world and
[1:35:22] even angels
[1:35:25] her name each of her members were
[1:35:29] written
[1:35:32] in a section
[1:35:37] of the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:35:41] before the foundation of the world
[1:35:45] now you see why and will come realize
[1:35:48] why the in that in the hand of the Angel
[1:35:53] was a book open
[1:35:54] but the Bible said a little book
[1:36:00] was it the Lamb's Book of Life certainly
[1:36:02] but what book was it the bride's book
[1:36:06] you couldn't get her name off of that if
[1:36:08] you tried
[1:36:10] that book was opened right there what
[1:36:13] was the book of redemption what was it
[1:36:16] redeeming
[1:36:19] amen
[1:36:20] you and I
[1:36:23] that's the book that that brother
[1:36:26] Branham called it the abstract deed
[1:36:31] of redemption but now he opens the book
[1:36:33] to lay claim because it's a marriage
[1:36:36] certificate
[1:36:38] amen
[1:36:40] and he lays claim on this who he has
[1:36:43] purchased
[1:36:49] all right and so we come down and
[1:36:52] actually I'll preach this another time
[1:36:54] but I don't like to give my titles but I
[1:36:56] was going to preach on God's mystery in
[1:36:59] Christ
[1:37:01] God's mystery in Christ
[1:37:06] amen
[1:37:09] all right just as Eve was in Adam a
[1:37:12] mystery
[1:37:16] all right now
[1:37:18] 159 paragraph 159
[1:37:21] and says she was written in a section of
[1:37:24] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:37:25] foundation of the world paragraph 159.
[1:37:30] thus if God is so designed that there be
[1:37:33] those whose names are placed in a
[1:37:35] section of the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:37:37] cannot be erased for there the names of
[1:37:39] his bride then we must accept that
[1:37:45] then he goes on to say if there's no
[1:37:47] names that are removed we must accept
[1:37:49] that those names will enter into life
[1:37:51] based on the grounds that be good and
[1:37:53] kind to the elect we must accept that
[1:37:57] all right now well you say must accept
[1:38:00] it who's going to accept it
[1:38:03] we the bride will accept that
[1:38:06] all right now
[1:38:08] paragraph 164. I said I'm closing so I'm
[1:38:12] just I'm right at the time to close
[1:38:14] paragraph 164.
[1:38:16] he says this
[1:38:19] now then the record of now he's talking
[1:38:21] about the wheat plant because a wheat
[1:38:23] plant
[1:38:25] is the is the record of the book it's
[1:38:27] the Book of Life record
[1:38:29] but in the wheat plant is parts that are
[1:38:32] saved parts that are not parts that are
[1:38:35] the life literal life which is the bride
[1:38:37] see and he goes on he says now the
[1:38:39] record of this wheat plant whose end is
[1:38:41] is to reproduce The Original Seed in
[1:38:44] multiple multiplied form is The Book of
[1:38:47] Life or the Lamb's Book of Life or the
[1:38:50] book of heaven or the book is he all
[1:38:53] right
[1:38:54] which is which it would see so I repeat
[1:38:58] the history or record of this wheat
[1:39:00] plant is The Book of Life which a part
[1:39:03] of the book of life is the record of
[1:39:07] eternal life a section of the Book of
[1:39:09] Life
[1:39:11] amen just like the wheat plant there's
[1:39:14] only a portion of that plant that comes
[1:39:16] to wheat seed see that's the life coming
[1:39:19] through carriers
[1:39:21] justification sanctification baptism
[1:39:23] Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost
[1:39:26] himself the person to come right down
[1:39:29] back to Perfection back to the word
[1:39:32] again
[1:39:34] there's only a certain number can
[1:39:36] receive
[1:39:37] that word
[1:39:39] how were we brought back to him through
[1:39:41] the word
[1:39:43] amen all right but see those seven
[1:39:46] Thunders the Revelation contained in
[1:39:48] them wasn't something outside of the
[1:39:49] word it was said in the word
[1:39:55] amen and it was handed down to the hand
[1:39:57] of the seventh angel the sword was to
[1:40:00] unveil that by his messenger the lamb
[1:40:03] was to unveil that by his messenger that
[1:40:05] lamb his voice was a lion
[1:40:09] calling for his Queen
[1:40:13] to come and take her position
[1:40:20] because what is these seals revealing
[1:40:24] the finished mystery
[1:40:26] these Mysteries reveal the mystery
[1:40:28] what's the mystery you're the mystery
[1:40:31] amen
[1:40:34] amen all right so now we just in
[1:40:37] paragraph 164.
[1:40:40] okay I just read that a section of the
[1:40:43] life now so now in paragraph one I'm
[1:40:46] coming right down at the end now 168.
[1:40:49] he and this is page 320. so we're moving
[1:40:52] through this Artisan age he said we have
[1:40:54] the same right today in the church
[1:40:57] he said and he says well let me back up
[1:41:00] here he said all Israel is not Israel
[1:41:02] but all but a tiny minority and their
[1:41:04] names all but a tiny minority of Israel
[1:41:07] and that Minority is the hundred and
[1:41:10] forty four thousand had their names
[1:41:12] blotted out of The Book of Life
[1:41:15] think of that
[1:41:17] amen talking about in this day
[1:41:20] hurt that judgment okay now we have the
[1:41:23] same right today in the church
[1:41:27] he says names are going to be blotted
[1:41:29] out of the book of life no names will be
[1:41:32] blotted out of the book of eternal life
[1:41:33] for that is another record
[1:41:38] though contained in the Lamb's Book of
[1:41:42] Life
[1:41:44] amen it's another record
[1:41:49] that's why we don't despise the day of
[1:41:51] small things
[1:41:52] a little book was taken
[1:41:55] may not be much in everybody's eyes and
[1:41:58] God hiding in Simplicity revealing it
[1:42:01] and then when it's revealed it's still
[1:42:03] hidden simplicity
[1:42:05] amen see
[1:42:06] all right but look at your position
[1:42:08] bride
[1:42:10] was in him
[1:42:13] and when it comes forth in this hour and
[1:42:16] she raises up in her position what is it
[1:42:18] the revealing of the son of man again
[1:42:21] it's his second coming
[1:42:23] that's the mystery brother Brown said
[1:42:25] the revelation of the seven seal was the
[1:42:27] mystery of the coming of the Lord
[1:42:30] and he says and I know about it he said
[1:42:32] no man would know it but I'm going to
[1:42:33] tell you my revelation
[1:42:36] see no man knew it but he said but he
[1:42:39] said what's going to awaken that bride
[1:42:41] it will be the revealing of these
[1:42:43] Mysteries
[1:42:44] will wake her up the seven thunders of
[1:42:47] of of Jesus Will awaken her well then a
[1:42:51] year almost a year and a half later now
[1:42:53] he says they haven't recognized The
[1:42:55] Awakening
[1:42:56] so it's done been preached
[1:43:01] amen because now he says they've been
[1:43:03] awakened
[1:43:07] and he said right here this morning
[1:43:09] Christ's mystery God revealed I'm gonna
[1:43:11] I'm gonna tell you what it says I'm
[1:43:13] going to tell you the mystery secret of
[1:43:15] that seventh seal
[1:43:20] amen all right now
[1:43:23] first John 5 11 right after saying that
[1:43:25] it's another record
[1:43:27] a record he says and this is the record
[1:43:29] first John 5 11 and 12 and this is the
[1:43:32] record that God hath given to us
[1:43:35] the bride
[1:43:38] eternal life and this life is in his son
[1:43:42] Hallelujah if you possess that life then
[1:43:45] what are you
[1:43:49] if that life is in you
[1:43:52] would be the revelation of himself
[1:43:55] that record
[1:43:57] which there's only one form of eternal
[1:43:58] life
[1:44:00] amen all right then that record God hath
[1:44:03] given to us
[1:44:04] eternal life is the record in this life
[1:44:06] is in his seed his son
[1:44:09] he that hath the son
[1:44:11] now what about the real gift he that
[1:44:14] hath the son hath life
[1:44:18] amen he that hath the son hath life and
[1:44:21] he that hath not the Son of God hath not
[1:44:24] life
[1:44:27] and those who have that life were in him
[1:44:29] before the foundation of the world they
[1:44:31] were chosen in him before the foundation
[1:44:33] of the world that great Royal seed Jesus
[1:44:36] Christ would plant it he died and that
[1:44:38] life was in him came up through the
[1:44:40] wheat plant and is reproducing itself in
[1:44:42] the multitude multitudes of wheat seed
[1:44:45] not another seed same seed maltitude of
[1:44:47] wheat seeds having the same life in them
[1:44:50] being like the original because by
[1:44:52] Spirit by Spirit as Eve by Spirit she
[1:44:56] was Adam by spirit
[1:45:00] amen by spirit
[1:45:03] amen she's by Spirit they are original
[1:45:10] so then we see why the redeem brought
[1:45:13] back by the original owner the bride she
[1:45:15] was in him as Eve was an Adam cannot
[1:45:17] ever have her member names taken off the
[1:45:19] Record she is part of him she is in the
[1:45:22] throne she in the throne not on it in it
[1:45:25] and she can never be judged everyone in
[1:45:27] the Bride is a member of him
[1:45:31] he loses none
[1:45:35] but that doesn't that isn't concerning
[1:45:37] that all in the Book of Life or amongst
[1:45:39] them or even like Judas who have a part
[1:45:41] in the record but their names are
[1:45:43] removed now I won't go into that that's
[1:45:45] another program God bless you
[1:45:48] do you love him
[1:45:50] yeah paragraph one more is 173 thus the
[1:45:53] grain of wheat and I'm closing right
[1:45:55] here you can stand
[1:45:57] thus the grain of wheat that became a
[1:45:59] plant for the Harvest is the record of
[1:46:02] the church
[1:46:04] all right what comes out of the church
[1:46:06] see is the record and even as not all
[1:46:10] the wheat plant is wheat seed and not
[1:46:12] all the plant is used in the Harvest so
[1:46:15] with the church all the church is not
[1:46:18] the bride and neither is it all given
[1:46:21] eternal life but a part of it is
[1:46:23] gathered into the Garner and a part of
[1:46:25] it's kept that it might enter into
[1:46:27] eternal life in the second resurrection
[1:46:29] and part of it
[1:46:32] which is accounted chaff is burned in
[1:46:35] the Lake of Fire
[1:46:37] amen
[1:46:40] God bless you
[1:46:42] who are these righteous there in the
[1:46:44] judgment
[1:46:46] who are those unrighteous
[1:46:49] why would they be righteous and receive
[1:46:52] eternal life I think this has been
[1:46:53] answered
