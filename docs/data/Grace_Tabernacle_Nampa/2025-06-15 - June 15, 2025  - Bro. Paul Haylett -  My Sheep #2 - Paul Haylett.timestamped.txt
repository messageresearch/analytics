[16:07] Amen. Let's go to number 969. It's the
[16:10] key of D.
[16:14] [Music]
[16:16] How do you explain?
[16:22] How do you describe
[16:27] the love that goes from east to west
[16:32] and runs as deep as it is wide.
[16:39] You know all our hopes,
[16:44] Lord. You know all our fears
[16:50] when words could not express the love we
[16:54] feel. But we long for you to hear.
[17:01] Listen to our hearts.
[17:07] Hear our spirit sing.
[17:12] The song of praise that flows
[17:18] from those you have redeemed.
[17:23] And we will use the words we know to
[17:28] tell you what an awesome God
[17:33] you are. When words are not enough to
[17:38] tell you of our love, just listen to our
[17:43] hearts.
[17:47] If words could fall like rain
[17:53] from these lips of mine.
[17:58] And if I had a thousand years,
[18:04] I would still run out of time.
[18:09] Oh, if you'll listen to my heart.
[18:16] Every beat will say,
[18:21] "Thank you for the life. Thank you for
[18:26] the truth.
[18:28] Thank you for the way.
[18:33] Listen to our hearts.
[18:37] [Music]
[18:39] Hear our spirit sing.
[18:44] A song of praise that flows
[18:50] from those you have redeemed.
[18:55] And we will use the words we know to
[19:00] tell you what an awesome God you are.
[19:07] When words are not enough to tell you of
[19:11] our love, just listen to our hearts.
[19:18] Amen. Let's sing. He's got it all in
[19:20] control.
[19:22] Let's stand together before the prayer.
[19:26] [Music]
[19:27] He's got it all
[19:31] in control.
[19:37] He's got it all
[19:41] in control.
[19:46] He put that reassur
[19:52] way down in my soul.
[20:00] He's got it all
[20:04] in control.
[20:10] I put my life in his hands.
[20:20] I put my life in his hands.
[20:29] So every road I walk down,
[20:35] I'm sure it's in his plan.
[20:39] [Music]
[20:43] I put my life in his hands.
[20:53] My father knows
[20:56] what I need.
[21:02] My father knows
[21:06] what I need.
[21:08] [Music]
[21:11] And everything
[21:14] I go through,
[21:16] he knows what's best for me.
[21:23] [Music]
[21:24] My father knows
[21:28] what I need. He's got it all.
[21:33] He's got it all
[21:36] in control.
[21:42] He's got it all in control.
[21:50] He put that reassurance
[21:56] way down in my soul.
[22:04] He's got it all
[22:07] in control.
[22:10] [Music]
[22:12] Amen.
[22:15] Brother David, you could lead us in a
[22:16] word of prayer. Let's remember sister

[23:48] great confidence. Lord, they've been
[23:49] mentioned. We're asking for the healing
[23:52] of our sister Sue, Sister Heather.

[27:33] You lead me. You guide me. You're
[27:39] dwelling

[27:52] Amen. Let's go to the key of D.
[27:55] Sing reach out and touch the Lord as
[27:57] brother Paul comes.
[28:00] Reach out and touch the Lord
[28:06] as he
[28:08] goes by.
[28:11] You'll find he's not too busy
[28:16] to hear your heart's cry.
[28:22] He's passing
[28:24] by this moment.
[28:27] Your needs to supply.
[28:33] Reach out and touch the Lord
[28:38] as he
[28:41] goes by.
[28:44] Oh, reach out and touch the Lord

[29:29] Reach out and touch the Lord
[29:35] as he
[29:37] goes by.
[29:40] You find he's not busy
[29:46] to hear your heart's cry.
[29:51] He is passing
[29:54] by this moment.
[29:57] your needs to supply.
[30:03] Reach out and touch the Lord
[30:08] as he
[30:11] goes by. Are you believing that he's
[30:14] here this morning? Amen. Here in our
[30:17] presence here, just waiting for us to
[30:19] reach out and touch him. Amen. We don't
[30:23] have to worry about, my brother and
[30:24] sister, whether you touched him or not.
[30:26] If your heart is reaching out to him.
[30:28] Amen. Just as the woman with the blood
[30:30] issue. Amen. You know, they might have
[30:33] questioned Jesus. How would you know who
[30:35] it was? But he knew. Amen. And he knows
[30:38] who's reaching out today uh in your
[30:41] heart, your needs to just touch him.
[30:43] Amen. Just a couple things I want to
[30:45] share with you. First off, uh happy
[30:48] Father's Day. Amen. And uh we're just
[30:51] blessed. and we'll we'll include those
[30:54] fathers that uh are yet to be. Amen. Uh
[30:59] that it's coming. So we happy father's
[31:01] day. Amen. I felt bad. I was just I was
[31:05] listening to a service this morning and
[31:07] the they were speaking of oh all you
[31:10] fathers we have a treat for you in the
[31:12] kitchen when the service is over. And
[31:14] and I thought oh that our sisters would
[31:17] have that revelation.
[31:19] But uh anyway uh God bless you today.
[31:23] Brother Adrien, Sister Adah and the
[31:25] children send their greetings. Amen. Had
[31:28] a lovely conversation with brother
[31:30] Adrien. And uh so I want to just touch
[31:33] on a couple things concerning camp. Uh
[31:36] and u there's no Wednesday service here
[31:39] and there'll be no Sunday service here
[31:42] because that will take place at camp.
[31:45] And the check-in starts at 400 p.m. on
[31:47] Thursday. And if you have a cabin, don't
[31:51] forget to bring your own bedding. Okay?
[31:55] So there there is no bedding there. So
[31:58] it's good to see each and every one of
[32:00] you this morning. Let's just turn in our
[32:02] Bibles to John the 10th chapter. And I
[32:06] want to speak to you again on my sheep
[32:09] part two. And I'm glad this morning I
[32:11] can say I am his sheep. Amen. That I
[32:14] know where I belong. I know who
[32:17] possesses, you might say, the title to
[32:20] my life, to my soul. Amen. He's redeemed
[32:23] it. Amen. The abstract deed, as the
[32:27] prophet taught, uh, has been settled.
[32:30] Satan might bluster. He might claim he
[32:32] has a claim on us, but my brother and
[32:35] sister, it clearly shows he has no
[32:37] rights to the bride of Jesus Christ. No
[32:40] rights at all. Amen. John 10:24-30.
[32:46] Then came the Jews round about him, and
[32:49] said unto him, "How long do thou make us
[32:53] to doubt, if thou be the Christ, tell us
[32:57] plainly?"
[32:58] Jesus answered them, "I told you, and
[33:01] you believe not. The works that I do in
[33:04] my Father's name, they bear witness of
[33:06] me. But ye believe not, because you're
[33:09] not of my sheep, as I said unto you. My
[33:13] sheep hear my voice, and I know them,
[33:16] and they follow me. And I give unto them
[33:20] eternal life, and they shall never
[33:22] perish. Neither shall any man pluck them
[33:25] out of my hand. And I tell you, that
[33:27] just makes my heart so happy. There's
[33:30] nothing going to pluck us out of the
[33:33] hand of our father. Amen. My father
[33:36] which gave them me is greater than all
[33:38] and no man is able to pluck them out of
[33:41] my father's hand. Now this is
[33:44] interesting. Oh, let me finish and then
[33:46] we'll I and my father are one. Now it's
[33:49] so interesting. I've been studying just
[33:51] a little bit uh on some different topics
[33:53] and reaching out into the internet and
[33:57] uh it's so interesting how that there is
[34:01] such a labor or emphasis has been for
[34:04] years but right now it's just really
[34:06] focused on convincing people of the
[34:09] trinity. It is just they're pressing
[34:12] forward trying to make this stick
[34:15] because Satan knows if you don't know
[34:17] who your father is then you will find
[34:20] yourself wandering and uh confused and
[34:24] no idea just listening to a man that I
[34:26] think is actually quite a good preacher
[34:28] Pentecostal man. Quite a good preacher.
[34:31] And um I hope he listens to his own
[34:33] video that he put up because hopefully
[34:35] he will find himself just as confused as
[34:38] he confused everyone else. Amen. But you
[34:41] see my brother and sister, when Jesus is
[34:44] there saying you can't pluck them out of
[34:45] my hand, and then he's saying you can't
[34:47] pluck them out of the father's hand.
[34:49] He's not talking about two different
[34:50] entities holding on. Amen. He's talking
[34:53] about one hand that holds the redeemed,
[34:57] the bride of Jesus Christ. And so we we
[35:00] don't have to worry about whose hand
[35:02] we're in. There's only one hand that's
[35:03] holding us. Amen. Aren't you glad? Let's
[35:06] just give a thanks to the Lord this
[35:07] morning. Amen. Hallelujah. Lord, we love
[35:10] you and we thank you, Father, that by
[35:12] revelation, you have showed us who we
[35:15] are. Amen. You may be seated. Amen.
[35:20] As we look at this today, I just ask the
[35:22] Lord to just speak to to you uh that I I
[35:25] will be able to present this correctly.
[35:28] Uh several different thoughts and
[35:30] different things come to me and uh just
[35:32] as brother David uh spoke on Wednesday
[35:35] night. I know what uh brother David
[35:38] shared with me in a phone conversation.
[35:40] I I I'm I'm I feel led to go down this
[35:42] road, but God sometimes comes and says,
[35:45] "Nope, this is a stoplight or a stop
[35:48] sign, and I want you to take a right
[35:50] turn or a left turn or whatever it is."
[35:53] So, we want to follow the leadership of
[35:55] the Holy Spirit. Right? Did you enjoy
[35:57] Wednesday night? to those of you that
[35:58] heard Wednesday night, I thought it was
[36:00] a lovely service. Amen. And so is that
[36:03] we want to follow the leadership of the
[36:04] Holy Spirit. Now, the Jews are there uh
[36:07] speaking to Jesus and and saying, you
[36:10] know, um uh just plainly tell us, you
[36:14] know, I mean, you need to let us know if
[36:17] you are the Christ or not. And and you
[36:20] know, the thing was is I I love Jesus's
[36:22] response because it's very reflective of
[36:24] the day that we live in. He's saying,
[36:26] "I've already told you." And you see,
[36:29] that shows that they clearly missed or
[36:32] did not understand the words that he had
[36:35] already spoken in their presence. They
[36:37] did not understand the works that they
[36:40] saw before them. Now, we could go back
[36:42] for just a moment into history and see
[36:44] and we'll see that it's also relevant to
[36:46] the day that they had come to a place in
[36:49] time that they had already figured out
[36:52] what God was going to do and how he was
[36:55] going to do it. And they proved it by
[36:57] their own words. I want you to just
[37:00] understand that they proved it by their
[37:02] own words. They didn't prove it by God's
[37:04] word. And so as it is, my brother and
[37:07] sister, the day that we're living in,
[37:08] very reflective of that also that
[37:11] they've come, God has already spoken.
[37:14] They're going to come as the scripture
[37:15] says, uh, is not Elias supposed to come
[37:18] first? And Jesus says he's already come.
[37:21] And this is what's going to happen in
[37:23] the day because man has constructed uh
[37:26] his own dialogue or his own
[37:28] interpretation of the word. Now my
[37:31] brother and sister I would say that 1977
[37:33] we won't go into this in its entirety.
[37:36] It's not our thought but 1977 look at
[37:40] the turmoil that the prophet's words in
[37:42] that what he spoke about that day. Now
[37:45] my brother and sister instead of
[37:46] stopping and saying you know what what
[37:48] we're going to do and we should as
[37:50] believers we should come down and and
[37:53] ask the Lord to give us uh understanding
[37:55] of this and if we don't find that
[37:57] understanding let us just set it to the
[37:59] side and let God interpret his own word.
[38:02] And so what happened was it created all
[38:05] kinds of factions and all kinds of of
[38:08] events that took place. People got
[38:10] discouraged. uh people were were uh uh
[38:13] this is a case that uh we know
[38:15] personally uh of a a family you know
[38:18] their pastor uh they were caught up in
[38:20] that and their pastor says well you know
[38:22] after this certain morning you know
[38:24] you're not going to need your
[38:26] possessions and he coerced them into
[38:28] selling what they had and naturally he
[38:30] didn't tell them to go donate it to
[38:32] goodwill he told them to donate it to
[38:34] him and so when it doesn't happen he's
[38:37] well off and they are destitute now he
[38:39] didn't come and say I was wrong and
[38:41] here's your money back. But he then
[38:43] moved on and did his own thing and it
[38:45] discouraged many people and it left a
[38:48] stain you might say on the message uh
[38:51] from that that message is not from from
[38:54] uh God. That message that stain is not
[38:56] from a prophet. It is from the people
[38:59] who decided they were going to interpret
[39:01] it without listening to the Lord without
[39:03] letting God interpret his words. And so
[39:06] as Jesus uh is there and the Jews are
[39:09] are putting this question out, how you
[39:12] the reason we doubt it's your fault,
[39:15] my brother and sister, the reason we
[39:17] doubt is because we don't have faith and
[39:19] are not listening to the word. We have
[39:22] let unbelief come in. And so what
[39:24] they're basically saying, how long do we
[39:26] have to unbelief before something
[39:29] happens? And Jesus answers and says, you
[39:32] know, I told you and you believe not. So
[39:34] in the context, my brother and sister,
[39:36] Jesus had already spoken the words that
[39:39] defined who he was. It's right there
[39:42] plain in scripture. We as Christians, as
[39:44] believers, read those passages of
[39:47] scripture and we see and say, "There it
[39:49] is." Amen. And so as it is, they heard
[39:52] those words and it did not affect them
[39:55] in such. In other words, they did not
[39:57] believe what they heard because it did
[39:59] not fit the narrative. Now my brother
[40:01] and sister, it's okay to have a
[40:03] narrative. Nothing wrong with having a
[40:05] narrative. Make sure you can ground the
[40:08] narrative in the right place. Amen. And
[40:11] so as it is without grounding the
[40:13] narrative, you you just then go off into
[40:16] men's ideas. And uh he said, you know,
[40:19] you believe not the works that I do in
[40:21] my father's name. They bear witness of
[40:24] me. Now, we can take this and line this
[40:26] up with every tree brings forth of its
[40:30] fruit. Amen. So, if you have something
[40:34] that's a crab apple, Amen. It's not
[40:37] going to be passable as as a uh a a
[40:41] regular apple, a good apple. I I had a
[40:43] name of an apple on my head and it just
[40:45] disappeared. But a gayla, you know, a
[40:47] crab apple is not going to pass off as a
[40:49] gayla apple. Amen. And when you eat a
[40:52] crab apple, you know you're eating a
[40:53] crab apple. They gave it that name for a
[40:56] purpose. Amen. So you look at this. So
[40:58] it's about its fruit. And as that comes
[41:01] about, he says, uh uh the things I've
[41:03] done in my father's name, they bear
[41:05] witness of me. In other words, I am
[41:07] living out the word that was before you
[41:10] of the prophets of all that was brought.
[41:13] I'm living that out. I can't help it.
[41:16] the fact that you actually did not
[41:19] believe the words of the prophets in the
[41:21] beginning and you had to put your own
[41:23] spin on it. But it comes down, it says,
[41:26] "You believe not because you're not my
[41:28] sheep." Now, if they had anything to
[41:30] gripe about, anything to complain about
[41:32] the fact that now Jesus is standing in a
[41:35] position telling them, "The reason you
[41:37] don't believe, the reason you don't
[41:39] understand is you don't belong to me."
[41:41] That's right. Oh my. That must have
[41:44] galled them to stand there thinking they
[41:46] were in a moral and spiritual high
[41:49] position to be told, "You don't belong
[41:51] to me. So therefore, you're not going to
[41:54] understand me nor believe me or be
[41:57] identified with me." Amen. And so what
[42:00] what it is to them, my brother and
[42:03] sister, it's salt in the wound. But to
[42:05] the real believer that would be standing
[42:07] there in that day, they would be
[42:09] rejoicing. I am his sheep. Amen. I am
[42:13] part of his fold. I I belong there. I
[42:16] belong to him. And uh so you believe
[42:19] not. And remember my brother and sister,
[42:21] the scripture says God's plan will not
[42:24] be hindered by unbelief. Amen. The word
[42:28] of God will come to pass regardless of
[42:30] how many unbelievers are on the earth
[42:33] today. Don't want to sound judgmental
[42:35] judgmental to the world today but all
[42:38] the millions upon millions of people
[42:40] today my brother and sister that many
[42:43] don't believe a god or they just believe
[42:45] God is a very very like a grandfather
[42:48] just kind of going to let you do
[42:49] whatever you want cuz my brother and
[42:51] sister it doesn't matter about that
[42:53] god's word will come to pass amen so it
[42:56] doesn't matter how many unbelievers
[42:58] there are
[43:00] now as you look at this
[43:04] He says, "You're not of my sheep as I
[43:06] said unto you."
[43:08] See, he's telling them, "What I'm doing
[43:12] bears witness of me."
[43:15] And just as I told you, you're you're
[43:16] not of my sheep. You have to take as it
[43:20] is between the lines of what Jesus is
[43:23] speaking to them. They as spiritual
[43:26] people, religious people, I really
[43:28] should say, uh, as religious people,
[43:32] they caught, you might say, the
[43:34] undertone of what Jesus was saying. You
[43:37] can go back. You killed the prophets and
[43:40] garnished their tombs. Amen. You didn't
[43:44] really believe them.
[43:46] And so, I'm fulfilling what they brought
[43:49] forth that you didn't believe then. So,
[43:51] how can you believe it now? Amen. But to
[43:54] those who are my sheep, they heard what
[43:58] he said to them.
[44:00] My sheep hear my voice and I know them
[44:03] and they follow me. See how beautiful
[44:06] that is, my brother and sister. We're
[44:08] not living in a day for us to just say,
[44:09] "I believe a message. I believe God sent
[44:12] a prophet to an age I I believe that
[44:13] God's redeeming or restoring the church
[44:16] back to its rightful position." It won't
[44:18] do any good just to say that, my brother
[44:20] and sister. God's actually looking for
[44:22] action on those words. If we believe,
[44:25] there will be some fruits that show we
[44:28] actually believe. And so when we see the
[44:31] fruits starting to come forth, my
[44:33] brother and sister, if it's crab apples,
[44:35] you don't need to go buy the tree. Amen.
[44:38] You don't need to invest in that tree if
[44:40] it's crab apples. But my brother and
[44:42] sister, if you can grab a hold of what
[44:44] the word is showing us, Amen. He says,
[44:47] "The sheep hear my voice." And I know
[44:50] them. And I'm going to get ahead of
[44:51] myself, so I got to be careful here. And
[44:53] I give unto them eternal life. Amen. So
[44:57] where's this gift of eternal life come
[44:59] from?
[45:01] Comes from the father. But Jesus just
[45:04] said, "I'm going to give it to you."
[45:06] Amen. So maybe the father handed it to
[45:08] him so he could give it to the people.
[45:11] No, my brother and sister. God coming
[45:12] down dwelling in an earthly or fleshly
[45:15] body. Amen. to fulfill his word before
[45:17] the people to make it that we could look
[45:20] and understand and and take a halt of
[45:22] these things and see what it is. And he
[45:25] says here, I I they shall never perish.
[45:28] And this makes me so happy. Verse 28,
[45:31] they shall never perish. Now, my brother
[45:32] and sister, as time goes on, if the Lord
[45:35] so chooses, as time goes on, we will
[45:38] look and see that each and every one of
[45:40] us will pass to a grave. we'll pass from
[45:43] that. If it is to be God's will that
[45:45] that's the way we pass. Amen. I believe
[45:48] the days coming might even be right in
[45:50] the generation that's uh represented
[45:52] here in the church this morning that
[45:54] there'll be those that are alive and
[45:55] remain. Amen. I'd like to be amongst
[45:57] that number that's alive and remain.
[45:59] Amen. But if the Lord chooses to let us
[46:01] pass, my brother and sister, that's not
[46:03] perishing. Amen. We were talking with
[46:06] the young people. And young people, I
[46:08] want to tell you I had fun with you the
[46:10] other night. I hope you enjoyed the time
[46:12] together as much as I did. Amen. It's
[46:14] just good to see young people that are
[46:17] happy. Amen. Can can uh just interact.
[46:20] It was just a nice time. Amen. And uh so
[46:24] you look at that, you see, no man's
[46:27] going to pluck him out of his hand. I
[46:30] don't care who that man is. And we're
[46:32] going to put it in the right context.
[46:33] That man goes all the way back to a
[46:35] pope. After all, he's just a man. Right.
[46:40] He has no authority from the word. His
[46:43] authority comes out of another book.
[46:46] Amen. A book that God doesn't even
[46:50] recognize.
[46:51] Amen. So there's where his authority
[46:53] comes from. Now look at this. No man's
[46:55] going to pluck them out of my hand. My
[46:57] father which gave them me is greater
[46:59] than all and no man is able to pluck
[47:01] them out of my father's hand. So I I see
[47:04] that how beautiful this is. uh how Jesus
[47:08] is speaking. He's actually speaking the
[47:10] gospel to them in a fashion that they're
[47:13] not used to. They're used to big words.
[47:15] They're used to formalities and
[47:17] traditions and they're used to uh just
[47:19] the orthodoxy of it all to come out and
[47:23] and we do this and you know uh uh I
[47:26] heard a brother one time say you know
[47:29] they they were represented in their
[47:32] temple worship. They were represented.
[47:34] That's actually what Satan uh uh took as
[47:38] a template for how he worships today. So
[47:41] that's how formal that Israel had got
[47:44] that everything was robes and gowns and
[47:47] all this proper tradition and and doing
[47:50] all of these things and and Satan, you
[47:53] know, tried to follow that. He thought
[47:55] that's what it was. But God come down
[47:57] and told us that we were to worship in
[47:59] spirit and in truth. Amen. And so when
[48:02] we come, my brother and sister, we can
[48:04] have truth and be so absent with the
[48:07] spirit that we would just be dead
[48:09] letters. But we are not called to be
[48:11] dead letters. We're supposed to be the
[48:12] living word. Amen. We're supposed to be
[48:14] a a living epistle read of all men. Not
[48:18] a dead letter, not a quoter of the
[48:20] message, but a liver of the message. A a
[48:23] living word coming in our day. Amen. and
[48:27] the very things that they were looking
[48:29] for in that day. Uh the very Messiah
[48:32] they said they were waiting for and are
[48:34] still waiting for. And we recognize that
[48:37] they will have to wait until God's
[48:39] chosen time because God's time piece
[48:42] works perfectly. Amen. They talk about
[48:44] the nuclear clock about how that is so
[48:46] accurate to project into the future and
[48:49] it's there. But my brother and sister,
[48:51] the most accurate clock is God's word.
[48:54] Amen. That's where the that it is
[48:56] brought to a place that everything
[48:59] happens exactly when it should. And uh
[49:02] they had created I already kind of spoke
[49:04] on this but I want to reiterate this
[49:05] again. They had created their own idea
[49:08] of how it would be. And I think that
[49:10] we're coming in this day right now and
[49:12] we need to just stop the the trajectory
[49:15] of us creating our idea about how it's
[49:18] going to be and just live the word.
[49:20] Right? We've been given the word. It's
[49:22] right here before us. Why don't we just
[49:24] let God live it out? Why don't we just
[49:26] completely surrender and say, "Lord, uh,
[49:28] you know, let it just come to pass in
[49:31] the way that you want it to come to pass
[49:33] and let me be a willing vessel." Amen.
[49:35] Let me be a vessel of honor that would
[49:38] do as you would ask of me. If you say
[49:40] stop, Lord, don't let me give an excuse
[49:43] to go on, but let me stop. If you say
[49:45] go, don't let me give an excuse for not
[49:48] going, but let me just go. Amen. And so
[49:51] they had these ideas and uh let's just
[49:54] let's just push aside the ideas. My
[49:56] brother and sister, we're hearing a lot
[49:58] of things happening around the world and
[50:00] and uh you know things are being
[50:02] preached that it's got to be like this
[50:04] and it's got to be like that and it will
[50:07] be not even it's got to be. Some are
[50:09] saying it will be like this but cannot
[50:11] defend it from the scripture. We're here
[50:14] as sons and daughters of God. A word
[50:16] called bride called to reproduce the
[50:19] word. Amen. We're not reproducing a new
[50:22] uh new religion. We're reproducing the
[50:25] word. And so we need to just come to the
[50:28] place where we say, "You know what,
[50:29] Lord? I'm just a sheep." Amen. And if
[50:32] you lead me to this pasture, that's
[50:34] where I'll go. If you lead me to this
[50:36] pasture, that's where I'll go. If you
[50:39] lead me right through the middle of
[50:41] Leodysia, don't let me turn to the right
[50:44] or left. No matter how good it looks, no
[50:46] matter how good it smells, how good it
[50:49] seems, but let me just follow in the
[50:51] path that my shepherd has called me to
[50:53] walk in. Amen. And my brother and
[50:56] sister, that I know this is a little
[50:57] straight, but some think that those like
[50:59] the prophet have to return to get us
[51:01] there. No, my brother and sister, we've
[51:03] been given very clear direction on what
[51:06] to do. He doesn't need to come and
[51:08] clarify the directions. We need to yield
[51:11] to the direction. We need to listen to
[51:13] the direction. We need to obey the
[51:16] direction and then we will have what we
[51:18] are looking for. Amen. So these ideas
[51:23] springing up and just as it was there in
[51:25] the New Testament, you know, it drew
[51:28] some into the wilderness here and it
[51:29] drew some into the wilderness there. But
[51:32] you know, they had enough revelation
[51:34] that just leave this alone and and if
[51:37] it's not the truth, it will just
[51:39] self-destruct like these have. It will
[51:42] take them out in the wilderness and they
[51:44] would be lost. And my brother and
[51:46] sister, it breaks my heart. Makes me
[51:48] sad. But we're seeing this come to pass
[51:50] in this day. Amen. We're seeing things
[51:52] that that we the message, we as Bible
[51:55] believers are called to holiness. And we
[51:57] see holiness evaporating away. And and
[52:00] and nobody seems to. I say nobody.
[52:03] That's just a cliche term you might say.
[52:05] Nobody seems to care.
[52:08] But we should care. Amen. Because
[52:11] there's a calling that he has placed
[52:12] upon our life. Not as a group. Amen. Not
[52:16] as a We're not going to find safety in
[52:18] numbers. I can remember a a family that
[52:22] that I know uh uh had moved from a large
[52:26] church to a small one. And they made a
[52:28] statement. They said, you know, uh we
[52:30] like the church we come from, a good
[52:32] church. And if I spoke the name, you
[52:33] would say, yes, a good church. But they
[52:35] said, you know, in a big church, you can
[52:37] hide.
[52:39] In a little church, you can't really
[52:41] hide.
[52:42] And my brother and sister, you see,
[52:45] sometimes God just takes away all the
[52:48] camouflage,
[52:50] all the things that let us hide. And we
[52:53] shouldn't be distraught about that. We
[52:55] shouldn't think the ministry is picking
[52:56] on us when he's plucking away all the
[52:58] camouflage. Because truly, when it comes
[53:01] down to it, we want to be what God calls
[53:04] us to be. I don't want to be a
[53:07] chameleon. And I don't want to be uh,
[53:09] you know, just hiding out all the days
[53:11] of my life. I want the word. Oh, I know
[53:14] it's hard. And and when you say these
[53:15] things, they come upon you. But I want
[53:18] the word to strip us down bare, if you
[53:21] don't mind me putting it that way. That
[53:23] I would stand naked before God. And not
[53:25] literal in the physical realm, but naked
[53:28] before God with nothing hid because
[53:30] that's what the word says it will be
[53:32] anyway. So, we might as well say, "Lord,
[53:34] just let it happen. Let the word come
[53:37] and bear me that I would then see my own
[53:40] nakedness and be able to stand before
[53:42] you and say, "Lord, wash me whiter than
[53:46] snow. I don't want to hide this. I don't
[53:49] want to be the unbeliever in the shadow
[53:51] where nobody sees me, but I want to come
[53:54] into the light and I want the light to
[53:56] reveal who I really am." You say, "But
[53:59] but there's things in my life I wouldn't
[54:00] want revealed." Yes, you do. Yes, you
[54:03] do. As a believer, you want the word to
[54:07] come and reveal these things that are in
[54:09] your life. You want to come to the place
[54:12] that you would be able to say that the
[54:15] works that I do are of my father. Amen.
[54:18] Not to stand there and say, "Well, we
[54:20] have a reason. We have an excuse. We
[54:22] have No, my brother and sister, no
[54:24] excuses. Let us come and be exposed or
[54:28] revealed by the word." Amen. There's
[54:30] more to just being revealed. Oh, oh, I'm
[54:33] the bride of Christ. I see that in the
[54:35] word. I see that. Oh, that's revealed to
[54:37] me. Well, Lord, shine the light bright
[54:39] enough to reveal every other thing in
[54:42] our life also. Amen.
[54:50] Just listening to the prophet the other
[54:51] day
[54:53] sharing that little story about
[54:56] the minister
[54:58] goes to the other side and comes
[55:01] proverbial to the pearly gates and they
[55:03] can't find his name.
[55:06] And they said, "Well, you do you can
[55:09] appeal this."
[55:11] And he goes and they're asking him, "Did
[55:14] you ever lie?"
[55:17] In that perfect light, my brother and
[55:19] sister, truth comes forth. I've lied.
[55:24] Did you ever cheat
[55:28] or steal? Yes, I have. And when it looks
[55:32] like certain judgment has come upon him,
[55:37] the sweetest voice ever come and said,
[55:41] "He stood for me on earth.
[55:45] I will stand for him." Now,
[55:49] my brother and sister, we're not looking
[55:51] for some carnal fleshly perfection.
[55:54] We're looking for a soul that stands for
[55:57] Jesus Christ. We're looking for a
[56:00] testimony that if we was to face a
[56:03] similar situation as it were that they
[56:06] would be the sweetest voice come and say
[56:09] he stood for me. I'll stand for him.
[56:12] Amen. You can have perfect attendance in
[56:15] church doesn't make you a Christian. You
[56:17] can read your Bible every day and pray
[56:19] every day and that doesn't make you a
[56:20] believer. Amen. But a complete absolute
[56:23] trust in Jesus Christ. Amen. And a
[56:26] confession. Amen. the revelation of the
[56:29] word in you. Amen. So, you know, we we
[56:34] don't we don't like this. I I pondered
[56:36] over this, struggled over this, how to
[56:38] say this, and we're here. We'll just say
[56:41] it. There's been so much separation come
[56:45] people saying, "Are you on my side or
[56:47] their side?" And something I won't
[56:49] elaborate on, but I will just express
[56:52] enough of this. A little situation. And
[56:54] unfortunately, we were at the fringes of
[56:56] this and uh a little situation and
[56:58] people are saying, "Well, this is what
[57:00] happened and and these people are now
[57:03] saying this or opposed to this and these
[57:05] are over here and these want nothing to
[57:07] do with it." And my brother and sister,
[57:10] I look at the whole thing and I think my
[57:12] it's strange. I was in the middle of
[57:14] this little situation as it were and was
[57:18] completely naive and unaware that
[57:20] spirits were moving in such a fashion.
[57:22] And literally a phone call that I
[57:24] received, I I asked the man uh that that
[57:27] called me, why are people who are not
[57:29] even involved wanting, begging to be
[57:33] involved? My brother and sister, you
[57:35] see, because there is a turmoil that is
[57:37] taking a place, a separation is coming.
[57:40] And we can take the separation by the
[57:42] word or we can take the separation by
[57:45] man's word. And men will choose sides.
[57:49] It's been that way always. I just
[57:51] remember as a young boy I was a decent
[57:53] baseball player. Amen. And you know you
[57:56] would go and you have a confidence when
[57:58] you're in the the schoolyard or
[58:00] otherwise you have confidence that
[58:02] you'll be chosen for the team and you
[58:04] know as it's there if you've got all
[58:06] these boys all these young men you know
[58:08] you don't want to be the one that's
[58:10] still standing when all have been chosen
[58:13] for the team. Do you know what I'm
[58:14] talking about? Amen. Where you're the
[58:16] one that you want to give 100%. You want
[58:18] to be on the team. You want to be
[58:20] identified and no one chooses you. Well,
[58:22] I'll tell you, my brother and sister,
[58:24] we're here today. God's called you to
[58:26] his team. He has chosen you. You will
[58:29] not be left out. You will not be put to
[58:31] the side. You will not be forsaken. But
[58:34] he wants you to play as it were. If you
[58:37] don't mind my analogy, 100%.
[58:40] Amen. I got chosen ninth.
[58:44] I'm only going to put a little bit into
[58:46] this. No, I don't care if I'm the last
[58:50] one called. Amen. I want to be all that
[58:53] he called me to be. I want to be the one
[58:56] that he said, "I have confidence and I
[58:58] called you. I want to fulfill that."
[59:01] Amen. So, it's there. There's so much
[59:04] separation by man's ideas. Now, you
[59:07] know, it's like, well, we feel like, you
[59:09] know, you got to choose to be on this
[59:10] side or on that side. And uh you know
[59:13] not to go too much into it but my
[59:16] brother and sister not too many years
[59:17] ago uh a little situation and and people
[59:21] actually called upon me to take their
[59:24] side in a situation I didn't even know
[59:27] the details to. I had no knowledge of
[59:29] it. It was just completely uh uh
[59:32] oblivious to the whole thing. And yet
[59:34] they said we want you to choose and be
[59:36] on our side in this situation. And my
[59:39] brother and sister I had to after much
[59:41] prayer just tell them I will not
[59:43] participate. If you believe that is a
[59:46] choosing of sides then you can believe
[59:48] that's a choosing of sides. But I am not
[59:51] going to choose a side when I don't even
[59:53] know the story that I supposedly
[59:55] support. Amen. So what it is my brother
[59:58] and sister God doesn't even want you and
[1:00:00] I here today as Christians to say I'm
[1:00:03] going to choose God's side if you don't
[1:00:05] know what you support. Yeah. You can't
[1:00:09] stand here and say, "I'm going to
[1:00:11] support the word of God." But what is
[1:00:12] the word? Well, uh, it's the Bible. What
[1:00:16] is the Bible? Something's got to be
[1:00:18] opened up and revealed out of the Bible
[1:00:21] so that we can stand and say, "That's
[1:00:24] me." Like the little boy visiting what,
[1:00:26] the auntie's house, you know, looking in
[1:00:28] the mirror and finally he's like, "Mama,
[1:00:31] that's me." Amen. He saw himself. And we
[1:00:35] shouldn't even say, "I'm a Christian."
[1:00:37] unless you're willing to dig into the
[1:00:39] word and realize what it is you're
[1:00:41] supporting.
[1:00:43] Not a concept. There's a lot of people
[1:00:44] that don't even believe there's a God.
[1:00:47] My brother and sister, but they look at
[1:00:49] creation and say, "It's something more
[1:00:50] than man could do. So, I guess maybe
[1:00:52] there is a God." They're not supporting
[1:00:55] anything. They're not really choosing a
[1:00:57] side. They're leaving themselves in the
[1:00:59] balance that if they can prove there was
[1:01:01] no God and some pond moss uh
[1:01:04] deteriorated and created gas and and a
[1:01:07] spark. But where did the spark come
[1:01:08] from? Wait, where did the pond moss come
[1:01:10] from? Where was the gas that came from
[1:01:12] this come from? Where does all this come
[1:01:14] from? I don't know where it came from,
[1:01:15] but that's how it had to happen. My
[1:01:17] brother and sister, they don't even know
[1:01:18] what they support.
[1:01:20] Oh my. They'll tell you they don't
[1:01:23] believe in good or evil, but things
[1:01:25] happen. And these same people from their
[1:01:27] voice say that was evil. Where do they
[1:01:29] get that from?
[1:01:32] They don't know what they support.
[1:01:36] Now
[1:01:38] you see he said verse 26, "You believe
[1:01:41] not because you're not of my sheep as I
[1:01:42] said unto you." See, if there's no
[1:01:44] revelation of who Jesus Christ is,
[1:01:47] that's right. No revelation of who Jesus
[1:01:50] Christ is.
[1:01:54] You can't live it.
[1:01:59] You cannot live what's not real to you.
[1:02:02] Now, don't think this morning that I'm
[1:02:04] condemning people. Actually, I'm having
[1:02:07] great compassion and grace on those
[1:02:09] people because you can't expect them to
[1:02:11] live something that's not real to them.
[1:02:15] That doesn't mean it won't become real
[1:02:16] to them. That they're not well on their
[1:02:19] way for it to be real. But you can't
[1:02:21] judge them because they're not living
[1:02:23] like you think it should be. Amen.
[1:02:29] There's so many little trails we could
[1:02:30] go down.
[1:02:32] But verse 27 says, "My sheep hear my
[1:02:35] voice and I know them and they follow
[1:02:37] me." See, there's a very clear
[1:02:40] distinction between those that are not
[1:02:42] certain what it is and Jesus saying, "My
[1:02:46] sheep." Amen. Can we clearly identify
[1:02:48] them? Here's this little sheep. None of
[1:02:52] you are going to appreciate it if I come
[1:02:53] out and grab you like they grab sheep.
[1:02:56] That's kind of right behind the ears and
[1:02:58] right over the rump and they just grab
[1:02:59] them and they just toss them where they
[1:03:01] want them to be. Amen. I might feel like
[1:03:04] I might feel like somebody ought to be
[1:03:05] on the altar. Should I go down in the
[1:03:07] congregation today, grab you by the
[1:03:08] collar and drag you up here and throw
[1:03:10] you? No. That's not how God works. Amen.
[1:03:12] My sheep, Amen, he leads them.
[1:03:16] A real shepherd never gets behind the
[1:03:18] sheep and beats them trying to get them
[1:03:20] to go where he wants them to go. A real
[1:03:22] shepherd leads them. Amen. And the only
[1:03:26] way they'll follow is to be trained as
[1:03:28] it were, give an example and have to
[1:03:31] have confidence and trust in otherwise
[1:03:35] you can't drive them. I tell you, I was
[1:03:37] around a lot of uh Basco people in my
[1:03:40] younger years and my brother and sister
[1:03:43] sister that that the there is you know
[1:03:46] God God creates things in such a way and
[1:03:48] people to understand those things and
[1:03:50] and uh these guys would go out there and
[1:03:53] I can remember that uh very interesting
[1:03:57] character and he would go out there and
[1:04:00] he would grab a U. It wasn't the rams
[1:04:03] that did the leading. Now, don't take
[1:04:04] this, sister. This is too spiritual.
[1:04:09] He'd grab a U that he was already
[1:04:11] recognized as a she was recognized as a
[1:04:13] a leader. And he would grab her and he
[1:04:15] would bend down and look her in the
[1:04:17] face.
[1:04:19] Then he let her go. It's like, what did
[1:04:22] you do that for? I was telling her where
[1:04:25] to go.
[1:04:27] I used to think you're nuts.
[1:04:30] You never said a word.
[1:04:33] But I tell you in Basco in how I don't
[1:04:38] know if that's the actual description of
[1:04:40] the language, Basque,
[1:04:43] he would say a few words and then just
[1:04:44] start walking and those sheep just lined
[1:04:47] right out behind him.
[1:04:51] I come to believe that he actually was
[1:04:53] telling her,
[1:04:54] Amen. She was reading between lines. She
[1:04:58] was reading between the signs that was
[1:05:00] there and and they would go. He didn't
[1:05:02] he didn't stay in front of them the
[1:05:04] whole time. He just said stepped back.
[1:05:06] And there's got to be one in every
[1:05:08] church. I mean flock.
[1:05:11] And when he did, he had these dogs.
[1:05:14] Incredible dogs.
[1:05:16] And if there was a sheep that started
[1:05:17] wandering off on one side going away, he
[1:05:22] didn't even have to say anything. Those
[1:05:23] dogs didn't run around the whole flock
[1:05:26] till they get to get over on the other
[1:05:28] side. No, they jumped up and ran across
[1:05:31] the backs of the sheep. Went over there
[1:05:33] and convinced
[1:05:36] that sheep, you need to stay with the
[1:05:39] congregation.
[1:05:41] We as humans don't accept that kind of
[1:05:43] behavior. We we we don't like somebody
[1:05:46] telling us that we should be in church.
[1:05:48] We don't like people telling us that it
[1:05:50] looks like you're losing your focus. We
[1:05:52] don't like people telling us you're
[1:05:53] distracted. You you need to change a few
[1:05:56] things. We as humans don't like that.
[1:05:59] But God says we're his sheep. And so
[1:06:01] therefore, he's going to use whatever is
[1:06:04] necessary to bring us back to the place
[1:06:07] he says, the shepherd, the great
[1:06:09] shepherd says we should be. Oh, I know,
[1:06:13] my brother and sister, it sounds like
[1:06:14] we're supporting some kind of abuse. But
[1:06:16] if you really knew my heart, you
[1:06:18] wouldn't even think that thought. Amen.
[1:06:20] Because Jesus says, "My sheep hear my
[1:06:22] voice." Amen. And that voice is speaking
[1:06:24] today. But why does not everyone hear
[1:06:28] it?
[1:06:30] Because not everyone is his sheep.
[1:06:33] And I won't do the judging. He knows.
[1:06:36] Amen. So the people, as I said earlier,
[1:06:39] coming saying, "Why didn't you tell us?"
[1:06:41] Jesus said, "I've already told you."
[1:06:43] People coming today, my brother and
[1:06:44] sister, if this sounds a little stark,
[1:06:46] forgive me. But people coming today
[1:06:48] saying, "Well, why didn't the prophet of
[1:06:50] God say this, this, and this? It would
[1:06:53] saved a lot of He did.
[1:06:55] He did. How did he say it? He read the
[1:06:59] word of God to us. He didn't say it
[1:07:02] himself as in words, but he brought the
[1:07:05] word. And the great shepherd has already
[1:07:08] given the word and told us. And just as
[1:07:10] it was with the Sadducees and Pharisees
[1:07:12] and the Jews of old, they didn't hear it
[1:07:15] because they can't hear it. And that
[1:07:17] sounds stark. It sounds hard, my brother
[1:07:19] and sister. But until the season that
[1:07:22] their ears and their eyes are anointed,
[1:07:24] you can't just see that you are a son or
[1:07:27] daughter of God. You don't just see
[1:07:29] that. That's a revelation that God comes
[1:07:31] and pours into you. And when you see
[1:07:33] that, don't just say, "Oh, I guess I
[1:07:36] am." No. Rejoice that God has chosen you
[1:07:39] to be his sheep and placed you in his
[1:07:42] pasture and wants to make the word real
[1:07:44] to you. Amen. We say here today, many
[1:07:47] people say, "Well, I don't know. I don't
[1:07:49] know. This wasn't clarified. That wasn't
[1:07:51] clarified. And it's things I I'm not
[1:07:54] going to go into specific, but it's
[1:07:56] right here in the word of God. But they
[1:07:58] won't look in the word of God. They got
[1:07:59] to find it in the message. But it is in
[1:08:01] the message because the message pointed
[1:08:03] them to the word, but they didn't hear
[1:08:06] it the way they wanted to hear it or
[1:08:07] thought they should hear it and how it
[1:08:09] should come to them. They had an idea
[1:08:11] just like the Jews, Sadducees,
[1:08:13] Pharisees.
[1:08:16] Is it okay then? I'm excited. Amen.
[1:08:19] Amen. Isn't it interesting
[1:08:23] how sheep hear?
[1:08:27] See, never not everyone hears the same
[1:08:30] thing from the same words.
[1:08:32] I'll just use a simple analogy.
[1:08:35] He called me a buzzard.
[1:08:39] He called me an eagle.
[1:08:42] It was the same words.
[1:08:44] Amen.
[1:08:47] the preacher condemned me today. Someone
[1:08:50] else walks out and says, "Man, I was
[1:08:52] blessed today." You see, it all depends
[1:08:55] on what you hear from the word. And
[1:08:58] Jesus said, "My sheep,
[1:09:01] sign of ownership,
[1:09:03] hear my voice, an identity of a personal
[1:09:09] connection."
[1:09:11] Not any voice, but my voice. Amen. So to
[1:09:16] know them,
[1:09:18] he had to have relationship with them.
[1:09:20] Amen. Amen. So it's not just casually as
[1:09:23] it is that we hear a preacher preaching
[1:09:26] and say, I believe that was anointed of
[1:09:27] God. Uh you know what it comes down to,
[1:09:30] my brother and sister, is that God uh
[1:09:33] our Lord Jesus says, you know what, they
[1:09:36] know my voice. That's it. How how do you
[1:09:40] get to know a voice?
[1:09:42] How is it that, you know, sometimes I
[1:09:44] get fooled. I've I've got a daughter
[1:09:46] that sounds like my wife on the phone
[1:09:48] sometimes and uh even a granddaughter
[1:09:51] who sometimes says things in a certain
[1:09:53] way that I don't know if I'm talking to
[1:09:54] my wife or not. Uh you know, and you do,
[1:09:57] but but at the end of the day, there's
[1:09:59] always something that lets you know I'm
[1:10:01] not actually talking to my wife. Amen.
[1:10:04] Cuz you know the voice. Yeah. And so as
[1:10:08] it is that it's coming, the reason you
[1:10:10] can know that voice is because you have,
[1:10:13] I'm going to use a man and a woman, a
[1:10:14] husband and a wife. The reason that you
[1:10:16] know that voice is because you've been
[1:10:18] in communication with or communion with
[1:10:22] that. It's not just any old voice on the
[1:10:24] other end saying, "Oh, this is your
[1:10:26] wife."
[1:10:27] No, you know that voice because you're
[1:10:30] in communion with that voice. You've
[1:10:32] developed a relationship. Now the word
[1:10:35] know in this context is developed
[1:10:38] relationship with. Amen. So he says I
[1:10:42] know them. My sheep hear my voice and I
[1:10:44] know them. Amen. Because he has
[1:10:47] relationship
[1:10:48] with them. Which means if you have it,
[1:10:51] God doesn't deal in one-sided
[1:10:53] relationships. God doesn't want, you
[1:10:55] know, him to love you and you to love
[1:10:57] whatever. He wants you to love him. And
[1:11:00] if you love him, he loves you. Amen.
[1:11:02] That simple. Amen. And because there's
[1:11:05] relationship, they follow.
[1:11:08] Oh my. Nature proved this out. Amen. So,
[1:11:12] as they look now, I want to jump.
[1:11:14] Hopefully, you can jump with me here to
[1:11:16] John 1 uh and John 1:1.
[1:11:21] That's right. We're talking about
[1:11:23] relationship. We're talking about the
[1:11:25] connection. We're talking about how we
[1:11:26] pull this together. In the beginning was
[1:11:29] the word, and the word was with God.
[1:11:31] Okay? So Jesus is saying they follow me.
[1:11:37] Are you with me? Amen. They follow me.
[1:11:41] In the beginning was the word and the
[1:11:43] word was with God and the word was God.
[1:11:44] So we're all on the same page, right?
[1:11:47] God and the word, same thing. Amen. The
[1:11:50] same was in the beginning with God. All
[1:11:52] things were made by him. Without him was
[1:11:54] not anything made that was made.
[1:11:57] So, it's just interesting to see people
[1:11:59] like go off into the Trinity and start
[1:12:02] talking about creation.
[1:12:05] All things were made by him and for him,
[1:12:09] but God was the creator.
[1:12:14] Come on. We have to tie these loose ends
[1:12:17] together.
[1:12:19] Now when we see this we'll find that in
[1:12:23] this creation where we stand.
[1:12:26] In him was life and the life was the
[1:12:29] light of men and the light shineth in
[1:12:32] darkness and darkness comprehended it
[1:12:34] not. Where there was a man sent from God
[1:12:36] whose name was John. The same came for a
[1:12:38] witness to bear witness of the light
[1:12:40] that all men through him might believe.
[1:12:43] He was not that light, but was sent to
[1:12:46] bear witness of that light. Now, my
[1:12:49] brother and sister, I'll just throw this
[1:12:50] out. Amen.
[1:12:54] He was not the light, but he was called
[1:12:56] to bear witness to light. This puts you
[1:13:00] on equal footing with John. That's
[1:13:02] right.
[1:13:04] We look at those men of old, men of
[1:13:07] renown. Amen. And we say, "Oh, they must
[1:13:11] have been such supernatural guys." No,
[1:13:14] sir. You're right here on the same
[1:13:15] footing in the same position with John
[1:13:17] called to bear witness of that light. We
[1:13:20] are not the light, but we can say the
[1:13:22] light is in us. Amen. And as we'll look
[1:13:25] at this, brother David made a statement
[1:13:26] Wednesday night. I hope you don't mind,
[1:13:28] brother David, that I put this out. He
[1:13:30] said, "We are co-equal with God." Now,
[1:13:33] you hear that statement made and it
[1:13:34] causes a little bit of a bing.
[1:13:37] Say what? But let's just for a second go
[1:13:40] back into the book of Esther. And as she
[1:13:43] comes, she wants to put her petition to
[1:13:45] save her people. And she's there and
[1:13:48] they say, "You can't go unless you're
[1:13:50] invited because if you're rejected,
[1:13:51] you'll never come in the presence of the
[1:13:53] king again." And she says, "I have to do
[1:13:56] this." Now, Mori by revelation told you,
[1:13:59] "This was the day you were created for."
[1:14:02] Can someone say amen to that? This was
[1:14:05] the day we were created for, my brother
[1:14:07] and sister. And if we're not willing,
[1:14:09] another will come and take our place, as
[1:14:12] it were. So there Esther comes dressed,
[1:14:15] not in the finest goddy fashion of the
[1:14:18] age, but as the scripture shows us so
[1:14:20] clearly, dressed in the simplicity of
[1:14:22] the gospel. And she comes and the minute
[1:14:24] she comes into the Oh, there's all those
[1:14:26] fancy terms, but she comes into the
[1:14:28] forier into the transition of the enter
[1:14:30] room and and she's there standing and he
[1:14:33] looks and she doesn't have to say, "Can
[1:14:35] I please come in? Would it be okay? I
[1:14:37] know I'm breaking protocol. I know that
[1:14:40] I've been warned that you might reject
[1:14:41] me. But she presents herself, the word
[1:14:44] coming to the word. And she stands there
[1:14:48] and he puts the scepter forth and she
[1:14:50] comes and she touches it and he says to
[1:14:53] her, "Oh, what is it you desire even to
[1:14:57] the half?" That's right. 50
[1:15:01] 50.
[1:15:05] You realize that Esther herself,
[1:15:10] not without kind of breaking protocol,
[1:15:13] but Esther herself had authority to have
[1:15:17] sent Hmon to the gallows.
[1:15:20] She didn't even need the king's
[1:15:23] permission cuz he has now entered it
[1:15:26] into the books that she has to the half
[1:15:32] of the kingdom. Right? But just because
[1:15:34] we have authority doesn't mean that God
[1:15:37] said go exercise your power. Amen. But
[1:15:41] then the prophet of God comes along and
[1:15:43] says you can create
[1:15:46] the atmosphere. That's right. Huh?
[1:15:49] Anybody a creator?
[1:15:52] I want to be a creator. Lord, help me be
[1:15:54] a creator. Not of a negative atmosphere,
[1:15:57] not of a negative environment, not of
[1:15:59] something detrimental, but let me create
[1:16:01] an atmosphere that my Lord Jesus is
[1:16:04] pleased to dwell in. Amen. And we can do
[1:16:06] that, church. We can do this right here
[1:16:08] in this assembly. We can do it in the
[1:16:10] car. We can do it. But I tell you, we
[1:16:12] don't do it as often as we should do it.
[1:16:15] And we know when we're not creating the
[1:16:18] right atmosphere. Can anybody say amen?
[1:16:20] It's not a mystery to us when we create
[1:16:23] another atmosphere that by revelation we
[1:16:25] know Jesus would not be. If he was in
[1:16:27] the car, I wouldn't be saying this. If
[1:16:30] he was in the car, I wouldn't be acting
[1:16:31] like this. If he was No, my brother and
[1:16:34] sister, that's just God revealing to
[1:16:36] you, you're creating wrong atmosphere.
[1:16:39] Amen. And so we see how this comes that
[1:16:41] it's there. He was not that light. This
[1:16:44] is John. But was sent to bear witness of
[1:16:46] that light. That was the true light
[1:16:48] which lightth every man that cometh into
[1:16:51] the world. He came unto his own and his
[1:16:54] own received him not. Amen. We can take
[1:16:56] this right to the scriptures we've read.
[1:16:58] Right? You know if you are if you are
[1:17:03] tell us
[1:17:05] and right maybe in that very same
[1:17:07] multitude we're there standing that's
[1:17:10] the Messiah the promised one for our day
[1:17:15] and these oblivious
[1:17:18] and these revelated.
[1:17:21] Has anything changed?
[1:17:24] Nothing has changed.
[1:17:27] Amen.
[1:17:33] But as many as received him to them he
[1:17:36] gave power to become the sons of God. So
[1:17:41] there's creative power in that to come
[1:17:43] into a position to be able to say I am
[1:17:46] going to step in and possess this
[1:17:47] position as a son of God.
[1:17:50] That means you have to exercise the
[1:17:52] authority God granted to you. Yeah. You
[1:17:55] can't just say, "Well, if it is to be,
[1:17:57] it will be." Oh, let's see if I can get
[1:17:59] my voice to cooperate. Whatever will be
[1:18:03] will be. I will just wait and see. To
[1:18:09] see if it comes to me, cuz whatever will
[1:18:13] be will be.
[1:18:18] Did I do okay?
[1:18:21] That's not the song of the bride.
[1:18:26] I am a son of God. I am a daughter of
[1:18:29] God. He called me before foundation of
[1:18:32] the world. Satan, it's time for you to X
[1:18:37] out. Go.
[1:18:39] I'm claiming this position right now.
[1:18:43] Amen. In the name of Jesus. Oh. Oh, you
[1:18:46] just think you have so much authority. I
[1:18:48] do. I don't have the power to make him
[1:18:49] go, but I have the authority. And I'll
[1:18:51] tell you what, whenever the Holy Spirit
[1:18:53] comes in and you know what I'm talking
[1:18:55] about, whether it be in music in the car
[1:18:57] or you're hearing preaching or
[1:18:58] something, you know, you're praying and
[1:19:00] that atmosphere comes, that negative
[1:19:02] atmosphere, my brother and sister, has
[1:19:05] to leave. It moves right out. It's gone.
[1:19:08] And I tell you, Satan's good because
[1:19:10] he's trying to restore us back to a
[1:19:12] position also. And that position is
[1:19:14] called spiritual amnesia.
[1:19:17] And we're not called to be restored to a
[1:19:19] position of spiritual amnesia. We're
[1:19:21] called to know who we are in Jesus
[1:19:25] Christ. Amen. But as many as received
[1:19:27] him, to them he gave power to become the
[1:19:29] sons of God, even to them that believe
[1:19:31] on his name, which were born not of
[1:19:34] blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor
[1:19:36] the will of man, but of God. And the
[1:19:39] word was made flesh. That's right. Amen.
[1:19:42] The word. Amen. No, let's not. The word
[1:19:45] is already identified in verse 1 and two
[1:19:48] as being God. And the word was made
[1:19:50] flesh and that was identified as being
[1:19:52] Jesus Christ. Amen. So God was made
[1:19:55] flesh to come down in our midst to be
[1:19:58] able to come and speak words. Now my
[1:20:01] brother and sister, don't misunderstand
[1:20:03] what I'm going to say here. But you see,
[1:20:05] brother Brandham was not God. But God
[1:20:07] chose to come down and use a voice.
[1:20:10] Amen. And use it that it would be. And
[1:20:12] I'm going to read a quote here in just a
[1:20:14] few short minutes that will kind of
[1:20:16] you'll be like, "What?" But my brother
[1:20:18] and sister, you look at that, you see,
[1:20:20] you say, "Well, you're lifting up
[1:20:21] brother Brandham." If I'm lifting up
[1:20:23] brother Brandham in this equation, I'm
[1:20:24] lifting you up
[1:20:27] because you are God's servants. You are
[1:20:30] God's hands. You are God's feet. And if
[1:20:33] we'll submit ourselves to that point, we
[1:20:35] can be everything that God called us to
[1:20:38] be. And he called us to be supernatural
[1:20:40] beings. He called us to be sons of God
[1:20:43] with the authority to bind and to loose
[1:20:46] with the authority to create atmospheres
[1:20:48] with the authority to do these things.
[1:20:51] He come and gave you and I that
[1:20:53] authority and as I said Esther the wife
[1:20:56] the bride if she had recognized Amen.
[1:20:59] But she did you know how she exercised
[1:21:01] her authority? She went to her husband.
[1:21:05] Amen. And she went to the husband and
[1:21:07] she said, "This is the situation. Satan
[1:21:10] in the midnight hour is tormenting me.
[1:21:13] Lord, I call on you, my husband, to bind
[1:21:16] that spirit that's tormenting me." And
[1:21:18] he binds that spirit. Amen. And there'll
[1:21:22] be other examples we could go through.
[1:21:24] Amen. It wasn't for Esther to go stand
[1:21:27] up, shake herself. Amen. And say, "Hmon,
[1:21:31] I put judgment on you." But you see, God
[1:21:34] has a plan. And he puts the plan in
[1:21:36] place and he brings it down in such a
[1:21:39] fashion that the bride says, "Look, I
[1:21:41] was not called as it were to be the one
[1:21:44] to judge Hmon, but I have a husband. I
[1:21:47] have a husband and I'll just call on my
[1:21:49] husband." Amen. And we are here today by
[1:21:52] the authority of the word not to try to
[1:21:55] exercise that oursel but the exercising
[1:21:58] in our part is to call upon our husband
[1:22:00] and say husband I need you to come and
[1:22:04] change his situation. I ask anything
[1:22:11] oh I get excited.
[1:22:13] Amen. Ask anything in my name. Oh my
[1:22:17] brother and sister. Do we exercise that
[1:22:20] or we just talk about it? It's time for
[1:22:23] us to exercise it. We have needs. Can
[1:22:26] somebody lift a hand and say, "We have
[1:22:27] needs. I have needs in my life. It's
[1:22:30] time for me to exercise and say,
[1:22:33] "Father, I need you to come and change
[1:22:36] this situation. I need you to come
[1:22:39] midnight hour, morning, noon, whatever
[1:22:41] it is, I need you to come." Amen. and
[1:22:44] he's there and he hears us and he grants
[1:22:46] our petition if we don't ask a miss.
[1:22:53] Well,
[1:22:55] that's pretty big thing
[1:22:59] because often times
[1:23:02] we do ask a miss
[1:23:08] and it's not as ugly as you think
[1:23:11] because often times we don't preface
[1:23:14] this with Lord thy will
[1:23:18] be done.
[1:23:20] we see and we think it needs to be.
[1:23:23] Remember, brother Brown gives an example
[1:23:27] about people
[1:23:29] trying to pray somebody out of a
[1:23:30] situation and he cautions us. That's
[1:23:33] right. God put them in that situation
[1:23:37] and you're trying to pull them out. You
[1:23:39] need to know the will of God. That's
[1:23:42] right. God's using that to mold them
[1:23:47] into where he wants them to be. and
[1:23:49] we're over here. Lord, deliver them.
[1:23:52] Deliver them, Lord. Deliver them.
[1:23:54] Deliver them. Deliver them, Lord. God
[1:23:56] doesn't want to deliver him. He's using
[1:23:57] that. Amen. Amen. People say, "Wow, you
[1:24:00] know that that the Lord was so so hard
[1:24:03] on Daniel, you know, testing his faith
[1:24:05] like that to throw him in a lion's den."
[1:24:06] You realize God had come down and said,
[1:24:09] "Daniel, I want to prove to you and I
[1:24:12] want you to have proven in this realm
[1:24:15] that you can exercise the ability to
[1:24:18] bind the spirit of the lion." Amen. And
[1:24:21] now, I know this is a twist of words,
[1:24:22] but we're living in an age, my brother
[1:24:24] and sister, where the lion is roaming.
[1:24:27] Amen. Roaring in the age that we live
[1:24:29] in, a spiritual lion. And God wants some
[1:24:32] people that go through some experiences
[1:24:35] to come down to the point to be able to
[1:24:37] stand up and say, "I bind this lying
[1:24:40] spirit in the name of Jesus Christ." And
[1:24:43] be able to walk out of that situation
[1:24:45] unconsumed. Yes. Amen.
[1:24:51] To know the voice, to be in relationship
[1:24:53] with the voice. That's it. to be in
[1:24:56] communication with the voice.
[1:24:59] To be in communion
[1:25:01] with the voice.
[1:25:05] What is communion?
[1:25:07] Is to speak with and to be heard. That's
[1:25:11] right.
[1:25:13] To be spoken to and truly hear a
[1:25:17] personal experience of hearing. Amen.
[1:25:22] I want to emphasize that. a personal
[1:25:27] experience.
[1:25:29] Well, I tell you what, brother Brandham
[1:25:31] said this and this how the Lord come to
[1:25:32] him in the cave and spoke to him and oh,
[1:25:34] he opened the Bible and flipped it to
[1:25:36] the pages and he flipped it back and it
[1:25:37] flipped it right back to the Oh, isn't
[1:25:39] that so glorifying? No, I tell you what,
[1:25:41] you need to have your own experience.
[1:25:43] Amen. You need to have your own time
[1:25:45] that you would stand up and say, "You
[1:25:46] know what? The Lord did this for me."
[1:25:48] Amen. The Lord come down, spoke to my
[1:25:50] heart. The Lord opened my eyes. He
[1:25:51] opened my ears. Amen. Let it be a
[1:25:54] personal experience. Because if it's not
[1:25:55] a p personal experience, my brother and
[1:25:57] sister, you're trying to live on the
[1:25:59] light of another person or the light of
[1:26:01] another age. And God will not accept
[1:26:03] either one. Amen. That's why it must be
[1:26:06] a new birth, a personal experience with
[1:26:08] Jesus Christ. Because without that,
[1:26:11] you're trying to live on somebody else's
[1:26:12] light. And what happens when their light
[1:26:14] goes out? Yours goes out. Amen. And
[1:26:18] we've seen it happen. And you say,
[1:26:19] "Well, I don't understand why this
[1:26:20] person quit and then this person quit
[1:26:22] and this person quit." It's because this
[1:26:25] person and that person were living on
[1:26:26] the light of that person. That's right.
[1:26:28] And when that person proved not to be so
[1:26:30] spiritual,
[1:26:32] they didn't have anything to stand on.
[1:26:34] That's right. My my brother and sister,
[1:26:38] Lord, help us. Hope I'm not offending
[1:26:40] anyone this morning. Amen.
[1:26:44] You see this personal experience of
[1:26:46] hearing without a personal experience we
[1:26:49] end up with
[1:26:51] cold dead formal religion.
[1:26:56] Imagine
[1:26:59] symbolically here if you don't mind.
[1:27:01] We're going to go back in the Old
[1:27:03] Testament here and here it is Abraham
[1:27:08] on the mountain in a burning bush.
[1:27:14] can any of you tell me what Abraham felt
[1:27:17] like? What stirred him?
[1:27:21] From personal experience,
[1:27:28] the only way you'll know what he felt
[1:27:30] like is to had your own burning bush
[1:27:34] experience. That's right.
[1:27:37] We're not puppets. So, we don't have to
[1:27:39] have every word exact like Abraham might
[1:27:41] have spoke. We don't have to shake. We
[1:27:43] don't have to shudder. We don't have to
[1:27:44] stammer. We don't have to do all of
[1:27:46] that. But we have to have that personal
[1:27:48] experience. So, if we don't have a if we
[1:27:50] have cold formal religion, we don't have
[1:27:52] no fire in the bush. Amen. We can just
[1:27:55] talk about a burning bush. No personal
[1:27:57] experience. We can't talk about there
[1:28:00] being light in darkness if we've never
[1:28:02] experienced the light. That's right. In
[1:28:04] the darkness. That's right. Amen.
[1:28:07] And if we have no attributes on display,
[1:28:11] I just believe. Where's the attributes?
[1:28:14] Where's the evidence? Where's the sign?
[1:28:16] We're not an evidence-driven people.
[1:28:20] And you'd say, "Now, what, brother Paul?
[1:28:23] That's right.
[1:28:25] God said so, so we just believe it."
[1:28:28] Let me tell you, do any of you recognize
[1:28:31] concerning Israel the name Ai?
[1:28:37] It's in scripture.
[1:28:40] And they talk about in the battle with
[1:28:42] Joshua and going and conquering. That's
[1:28:47] the story in case just to stir up your
[1:28:49] pure mind here. That's where they go and
[1:28:53] show themselves as a weaker force
[1:28:56] on a hill over here.
[1:29:00] And the people of Ai who had just
[1:29:01] defeated them in battle just a few weeks
[1:29:04] previous. They look out there and say,
[1:29:06] "Look at that little wimpy band. Let's
[1:29:07] go out and kill them."
[1:29:10] They open the gates of the city. They go
[1:29:13] rushing out. They're going to kill these
[1:29:15] Israelites.
[1:29:17] And the Israelites in fear
[1:29:22] flee before them.
[1:29:24] And they flee right up over the hill and
[1:29:26] almost out of sight of the city. But
[1:29:29] look what happened. They left the gates
[1:29:30] of the city wide open behind them. And
[1:29:33] Joshua by revelation, God told him,
[1:29:36] "This is what you do." And when they run
[1:29:38] out, you wait till they're too far and
[1:29:42] then you run in. And they didn't even
[1:29:45] know that they had been deceived until
[1:29:47] their city was burning down.
[1:29:50] And then as they go to run back,
[1:29:54] Israel
[1:29:56] pursues them and they pursue them and
[1:30:00] they get them in the middle and they
[1:30:02] defeat them. That's right. Now my
[1:30:04] brother and sister, you can find this on
[1:30:07] the internet on YouTube. It's very
[1:30:09] interesting because these people are are
[1:30:14] in their understanding proving the Bible
[1:30:17] and they're literally talking about how
[1:30:19] we had this question mark we didn't know
[1:30:20] and then this uh archaeologist guy this
[1:30:23] anthropologist he he come and said I
[1:30:25] found no evidence and it shook the
[1:30:27] Christian world
[1:30:31] you shaken by the fact they couldn't
[1:30:33] find the evidence they thought was
[1:30:35] necessary
[1:30:38] what Christian world are they talking
[1:30:40] about was shaking
[1:30:43] You see my brother and sister, that's
[1:30:45] how they think.
[1:30:48] We think God put it in his word. Ai is a
[1:30:53] city was there. It was burned to the
[1:30:55] ground, settled. I don't need to go to
[1:30:59] Israel. I don't need to get a good pick
[1:31:00] and shovel. I don't need a sifting
[1:31:03] screen. I don't need a whole group of
[1:31:04] people to scrape real careful. God said
[1:31:08] it. I believe it. It's settled. But I
[1:31:12] thought it was interesting. So this man
[1:31:14] is now consumed with this thought that I
[1:31:17] the Bible does say it and I believe it's
[1:31:19] got to be there and uh we're going to go
[1:31:22] prove it. And ultimately God anointed
[1:31:25] they dug holes on this hillside that
[1:31:27] they identified as the only hillside
[1:31:29] according to scripture it could take
[1:31:30] place. And they dug holes and they did
[1:31:33] all this stuff and slowly but surely
[1:31:35] it's revealed. And and so it's there.
[1:31:38] And then the man then turns back and
[1:31:40] says, "Now what I don't understand is
[1:31:43] the man who went there in and I don't
[1:31:47] remember what that was. It was a long
[1:31:48] time ago. Um maybe it was the ' 60s or
[1:31:52] something like that. Why would he say
[1:31:54] there was no evidence?
[1:32:00] The same reason people today
[1:32:03] say there's no evidence that God is back
[1:32:08] in his bride in the word.
[1:32:13] We don't have evidence.
[1:32:16] Well, you're just digging in the wrong
[1:32:18] hole. I'm sorry. If you're digging in an
[1:32:20] intellectual hole, you're going to not
[1:32:23] find enough intellectual evidence to
[1:32:25] support what you think is the evidence.
[1:32:28] And to those of you that know, I mean,
[1:32:30] referring to folks that are, you know,
[1:32:32] criticizing and digging away and saying
[1:32:35] this is all nonsense and you're all
[1:32:36] deceived, but they're on a whole
[1:32:39] different hill digging and haven't found
[1:32:42] a drop of evidence to support. In the
[1:32:45] meantime, God's over here working on a
[1:32:47] bride, revealing the word through them.
[1:32:50] Amen. I don't need Oh, I'm going to say
[1:32:53] a harsh statement. Okay, is that okay? I
[1:32:55] don't need to fly to Africa. I don't
[1:32:57] need to go down there and sit in the
[1:32:59] same chair in a cafe that the prophet
[1:33:01] sat in to be able to say, "This is it,
[1:33:04] my brother and sister. I heard the word.
[1:33:06] It spoke to my heart. I realized God had
[1:33:09] spoken to me and said, "I've given you
[1:33:11] authority to claim your rightful
[1:33:13] position of who you are. And you are
[1:33:16] going to do this because my word says
[1:33:18] so." And we are here today doing exactly
[1:33:21] what the word says. Because the word
[1:33:23] said that we Amen. The spirit and the
[1:33:26] bride say, "Come." This bride's got to
[1:33:28] have a voice. She's not a puppet. She's
[1:33:30] not going to sit back and wait for
[1:33:32] something else to happen. God's anointed
[1:33:34] her to claim her rightful position.
[1:33:37] Amen. Why? Because we're sheep and we're
[1:33:39] in his pasture and we're eating his
[1:33:41] grass and we're growing from the
[1:33:43] nutrients of his word. Amen. That is
[1:33:46] what we're feeding on. And that's going
[1:33:48] to produce a healthy sheep. My brother
[1:33:50] and sister, when sheep start eating
[1:33:52] briars,
[1:33:54] this is a brother Eugene thing. If you
[1:33:55] guys want to find it, just go watch some
[1:33:57] of Brother Eugene's things. Amen. When
[1:33:59] you see sheep, not goats. When you see
[1:34:03] sheep eating briars, you have unhealthy
[1:34:06] sheep or sheep that are starving to
[1:34:08] death. We're not called to eat briars,
[1:34:11] my brother and sister. We're called to
[1:34:12] eat the good word of God. Hallelujah.
[1:34:15] Let me hurry up here. Amen.
[1:34:19] So if we have religion without a living
[1:34:22] God, we have no fire in the bush. We
[1:34:23] have no light in the darkness. We have
[1:34:25] no attributes to display.
[1:34:29] You're going to end up with no testimony
[1:34:32] of did our hearts burn within us. You're
[1:34:35] going to end up Amen. You see, if Jesus
[1:34:38] on the road to Emmus
[1:34:40] had just simply given them an
[1:34:43] intellectual
[1:34:45] understanding,
[1:34:48] I like this.
[1:34:51] Maybe it makes preachers feel good.
[1:34:54] Oh, ye slow of heart.
[1:34:57] Oh, we would be like, "You can't talk to
[1:34:59] me that way. I believe the message,
[1:35:01] right? You I've been a Christian for 35
[1:35:04] years. you can't talk to me like that.
[1:35:08] But it's still the truth
[1:35:10] and it was still real. And Jesus knew
[1:35:13] exactly what it would take to catch
[1:35:14] their attention just like he knew
[1:35:16] exactly what it would take to catch your
[1:35:19] attention.
[1:35:21] Are we called to live on flowery beds of
[1:35:23] ease to be told over and over again,
[1:35:26] we're such good people?
[1:35:29] Amen. Do we need to install glitter
[1:35:32] spreaders in our church and have
[1:35:34] somebody up in the rafters throwing $20
[1:35:36] bills out?
[1:35:39] Come on, my brother and sister. Do we
[1:35:42] need to as deceivers, wolves in sheep
[1:35:45] clothing? I won't do it because it'd be
[1:35:47] a little embarrassing. But do we need to
[1:35:49] come as preachers and lay down on the
[1:35:52] altar with our elbow on the deal and lay
[1:35:54] there and tell the people, "We're not
[1:35:56] leaving here today until you've buried
[1:35:59] me in money."
[1:36:04] Is that God's message? Is that sheep
[1:36:06] food? My brother and sister, that's a
[1:36:09] deception that people because they're
[1:36:11] not eating the right things in the
[1:36:15] beginning. They fall for that. But I
[1:36:18] tell you what, if I laid down on this
[1:36:20] altar and started begging you guys to
[1:36:22] bury me in money, I would find myself
[1:36:25] laying in the middle of the parking lot
[1:36:26] asking for an ambulance. Amen. Because
[1:36:30] the bride will not put up with this
[1:36:32] deception that is there. She wants the
[1:36:35] truth. She wants the word. Amen. Because
[1:36:37] she knows. Now look, I'm going to read a
[1:36:39] quote to you real quick. I've got a
[1:36:41] couple more minutes. Amen. Seventh
[1:36:43] church ages here. Uh Patmas vision.
[1:36:48] Now,
[1:36:55] now only can we speak thus of the
[1:36:56] messengers, but every true believer is
[1:36:58] dramatically depicted here. They are all
[1:37:01] drawing from the same source. They have
[1:37:03] all been dipped in the same bowl. They
[1:37:05] are dead to themselves and their lives
[1:37:07] are hid with Christ in God. They are
[1:37:10] sealed in by the Holy Ghost. Ephesians
[1:37:12] 4:30. And grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[1:37:15] God whereby is sealed until the day of
[1:37:17] redemption. No man can pluck them out of
[1:37:20] his hand. Their lives cannot be tampered
[1:37:23] with. This ought to get a a good amen
[1:37:25] out of us, right? Their lives can't be
[1:37:27] tampered with. In other words, God's not
[1:37:30] going to let a wolf come in and destroy
[1:37:33] their life. Amen. I'll tell you my
[1:37:36] brother and sister, so many people say,
[1:37:38] "Well, I went to church and this was
[1:37:40] what happened and the pastor did this."
[1:37:42] What about the other people that went
[1:37:44] and God took them from that situation
[1:37:46] and brought them over here and led them
[1:37:48] to truth? Which one is justified where
[1:37:51] they stand? I say the one that trusted
[1:37:53] God and said, "You know what? He said
[1:37:54] he'd lead me to truth. He didn't say it
[1:37:56] would be painless, right? But he said he
[1:37:59] would lead me." That's right. Amen.
[1:38:02] and uh no man can pluck them out of his
[1:38:04] hands. Their lives cannot be tampered
[1:38:06] with. The visible life is burning and
[1:38:09] shining, giving light and manifestations
[1:38:11] of the Holy Ghost. The inner invisible
[1:38:13] life is hidden in God and fed by the
[1:38:17] Lord's word. Satan cannot touch them.
[1:38:21] Amen. Praise the Lord. That's where we
[1:38:24] need to stand. Amen. And I want to put
[1:38:26] that out. That's where we need to stand.
[1:38:30] Amen. We're God's sheep, my brother and
[1:38:31] sister. He didn't say, "I've got sheep
[1:38:33] for a day.
[1:38:35] I got sheep for a day, a week, a month,
[1:38:38] a year. We're his sheep. Every day of
[1:38:41] our life, even before we serve God,
[1:38:44] we were in his eyes his sheep." Amen.
[1:38:47] Amen. I like that. I like that. Amen.
[1:38:51] And so we go, "Not even death can touch
[1:38:54] them, for death has lost its sting. The
[1:38:56] grave has lost its victory. Thanks be
[1:38:59] unto God." Can someone say thank you
[1:39:01] Lord? And they have this victory in and
[1:39:04] through the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And
[1:39:07] amen. Amen. I like that. Amen. Now, I'm
[1:39:12] going to speak real straight to you real
[1:39:14] quick. When we take communion,
[1:39:17] we don't take it just as an ordinance.
[1:39:20] It is an ordinance. Amen. It's in the
[1:39:21] scripture. It's spoken as something that
[1:39:23] we should fulfill.
[1:39:25] And it's not really an option. If you
[1:39:27] believe that taking communion is an
[1:39:29] option, by not taking it, you're already
[1:39:31] declaring you've put no value in that
[1:39:34] word. Amen. So, we start stripping that
[1:39:38] out of the Bible. What's going to stop
[1:39:41] us from taking the next page
[1:39:44] and the next page
[1:39:46] and the next page until we've got, as
[1:39:50] one brother joked, I thought it was
[1:39:52] funny at the time. He says, "I can tell
[1:39:53] you how they invented the pocket Bible.
[1:39:56] People started just tearing what they
[1:39:58] didn't like out of their Bible and
[1:40:00] pretty soon they could just slip it into
[1:40:01] their pocket.
[1:40:03] That's how they invented it. My brothers
[1:40:05] and sisters, that's we can't just start
[1:40:07] taking these things away because one of
[1:40:09] these days you're actually going to rip
[1:40:11] out the page that says you're a son or
[1:40:12] daughter of God.
[1:40:16] But as a testimony, that's what
[1:40:19] communion really is. Do you realize that
[1:40:20] it's an ordinance of God, but it's
[1:40:22] actually a testimony? And we should
[1:40:24] everyone have a testimony. Amen. We're
[1:40:28] testifying. I'm in a conversation with
[1:40:31] my Lord Jesus Christ. I am in communion
[1:40:34] with him, which means it's a
[1:40:36] conversation. It's not a one-sided
[1:40:39] dialogue. It's a conversation.
[1:40:42] Amen. And you're testifying to the world
[1:40:45] that I'm in a conversation with my Lord
[1:40:47] Jesus Christ. Amen. And we need to have
[1:40:50] a testimony. Amen. Every one of us
[1:40:52] should have a testimony of what the Lord
[1:40:55] has done for us. What will our testimony
[1:40:58] do for us? It will do exactly for you
[1:41:01] what you confess that it will do for
[1:41:03] you.
[1:41:05] If you say, "I don't have a testimony."
[1:41:08] Then what do you have?
[1:41:13] Am I being too rough?
[1:41:16] See, it's time to quit offering
[1:41:17] ourselves excuses. You say, "Well,
[1:41:19] there's things in my life that I don't
[1:41:21] feel like I can take communion." Get
[1:41:22] those things out of your life. Amen. I
[1:41:25] was just, you know, asking the other day
[1:41:27] a little question. You know, oh, how
[1:41:30] hard is it to repent?
[1:41:36] It's actually quite hard if your heart's
[1:41:39] not in it. That's it.
[1:41:42] Husband and wives,
[1:41:44] repentance should come easy
[1:41:47] because the truth of the word is that's
[1:41:49] your heart right there. You are not your
[1:41:52] own just as we are not our own in Jesus
[1:41:55] Christ. Amen. When we give ourselves
[1:41:59] we give ourselves to to a wife to a
[1:42:02] husband you're no longer your own. You
[1:42:05] belong to them. Lock, stock, barrel
[1:42:09] belong to them. When you give your
[1:42:11] heart, make a confession, Jesus Christ
[1:42:12] is my Lord and Savior, you are giving
[1:42:15] yourself lock, stock, and barrel to him.
[1:42:19] So if you're not taking communion
[1:42:21] because you have something in your life,
[1:42:22] let me give you a lesson how hard it is
[1:42:24] to repent.
[1:42:26] Lord, forgive me for what I have said,
[1:42:30] what I have done. I need forgiveness in
[1:42:34] the name of Jesus Christ. Was that too
[1:42:37] simple?
[1:42:38] That's how simple it is. The only thing
[1:42:41] keeping us from that is a stubborn
[1:42:44] spirit.
[1:42:49] But I got to get everything perfect
[1:42:51] before Well, I guess you're never taking
[1:42:53] communion
[1:42:55] because you'll never get it perfect.
[1:43:03] Be in communion.
[1:43:05] Part of that communion can be
[1:43:07] repentance.
[1:43:09] Part of that communion is thanksgiving.
[1:43:12] Part of that communion is praise.
[1:43:15] None of those are hard, are they?
[1:43:20] Now, you guys will like this one.
[1:43:23] Here we go. Here he
[1:43:26] gonna like this. Here a few days ago,
[1:43:28] not picking on any any women, but here a
[1:43:31] few days ago, a woman run up to me and
[1:43:33] said, "Mr. for Brandon. My mother's
[1:43:36] right out there. She's sick. Hundreds
[1:43:38] and hundreds of people congregating. I
[1:43:40] said, "I can't get to her, sister like
[1:43:42] that. I couldn't get through the mob.
[1:43:46] Take
[1:43:49] my hanky."
[1:43:50] Now, we'll just stop for a moment.
[1:43:54] Would that be scriptural?
[1:43:59] We can go right in the Bible.
[1:44:03] It's right there. Brother Brown was
[1:44:04] absolutely taking a scriptural position.
[1:44:07] Take my hanky
[1:44:12] here and go lay it on her and she
[1:44:15] baldled me out
[1:44:17] for not going.
[1:44:20] No wonder her mother didn't get healed.
[1:44:23] That's right. What if she would have
[1:44:25] come and said, "You know what?
[1:44:27] Maybe she didn't think the hanky was
[1:44:30] sufficient because she didn't know her
[1:44:31] Bible and didn't realize it was
[1:44:34] scriptural.
[1:44:38] Maybe she thought her mother was more
[1:44:40] important than that.
[1:44:44] Maybe she was just simply anointed.
[1:44:49] Can we have a rubber on the road moment?
[1:44:54] Yeah.
[1:44:57] You don't have to close your eyes, but
[1:44:58] but make you feel better. Stop and close
[1:45:00] your eyes.
[1:45:03] Positive or negative. Why do you do some
[1:45:05] of the things that you do?
[1:45:10] Because
[1:45:11] you're anointed.
[1:45:14] That doesn't mean that's what you are.
[1:45:17] Doesn't mean that's who you are. But
[1:45:20] there's spirits around us. Oh, my
[1:45:22] brother and sister, if our eyes were
[1:45:24] opened,
[1:45:25] We would probably be terrified
[1:45:28] of demons that would be there. Brother
[1:45:30] Brown talked about why you don't go to
[1:45:32] the movie theater because he says around
[1:45:35] about them is demons hanging around the
[1:45:39] ceilings in those places.
[1:45:47] back quite quite a few years. We went
[1:45:49] and watched a very good Christian film.
[1:45:54] It was in a theater.
[1:45:58] We were kind of coaxed, convinced it'd
[1:46:00] be okay. The whole time I watched the
[1:46:03] film, I couldn't get the thought.
[1:46:07] The last film that played in here,
[1:46:10] those demons haven't left.
[1:46:14] What am I doing here?
[1:46:17] What am I doing here?
[1:46:20] I just volunteered to pay to walk
[1:46:23] through the doors and sit down with
[1:46:26] hundreds, if not thousands of demons,
[1:46:29] believing this religious film that I'm
[1:46:32] watching will make it all good.
[1:46:36] What I should have did is listen to the
[1:46:37] prophet and said, "Stay out of them
[1:46:39] places." Amen. Because, you know, it
[1:46:41] took some time, but it come out on DVD.
[1:46:43] And I turned around, watched it again on
[1:46:44] DVD, and got way more out of it. Amen.
[1:46:47] Than I sure did in the theater. And it's
[1:46:49] a good film. In fact, I won't go into
[1:46:51] it, but one of these days, we're going
[1:46:52] to play it for our young people if their
[1:46:54] parents are accep.
[1:46:59] But you see, it's our choice. I went to
[1:47:02] a bar, but I only drank a Coca-Cola.
[1:47:07] Something to be said about atmosphere.
[1:47:10] Yeah. I didn't do any sinning. I didn't
[1:47:12] dance. I didn't drink.
[1:47:15] No, let's stop. Think about the
[1:47:18] atmosphere. So, this woman comes here.
[1:47:21] Whatever spirit's on her, she cared
[1:47:24] enough to come and ask for prayer for
[1:47:25] her grandmother, but she wasn't anointed
[1:47:28] with the right spirit to receive
[1:47:32] what God. And you might say, "But that
[1:47:34] was Brother Brandham." But you see, I
[1:47:36] can I with all of my heart. Maybe maybe
[1:47:38] it might be a doubt to somebody else,
[1:47:39] but for me all of my heart, if he she
[1:47:42] would have just said, "Okay, thank you.
[1:47:44] I'll take this." Cuz I remember when
[1:47:47] they went and laid hankies and did that.
[1:47:50] And if she'd have went that, Sister
[1:47:52] Carrie, I just believe that. Imagine her
[1:47:54] walking to her mother and saying, "Mom,
[1:47:55] he couldn't come, but he sent this."
[1:47:59] Yes. Amen. And her healing would have
[1:48:02] come because there would have been faith
[1:48:05] in the man of God. Right? He's just a
[1:48:08] man but sent of God. Amen. That's what
[1:48:11] we got to remember. And what are we?
[1:48:16] Just a man, right? Sent of God. Just a
[1:48:20] daughter sent of God. That's what it is.
[1:48:23] Amen. Don't try to overspiritualize
[1:48:26] this. Amen. God said himself through the
[1:48:28] words of a prophet. We don't have any
[1:48:30] big eyes and little U's.
[1:48:34] So when we come going back to brother
[1:48:36] David's thought on Wednesday when we
[1:48:38] realize that God has made us by his own
[1:48:42] will
[1:48:44] equal to reach up and possess these
[1:48:46] promises.
[1:48:48] If a hanky is how God chooses to
[1:48:50] transfer healing, just receive the
[1:48:53] hanky.
[1:48:55] Amen. If God sends you to an altar, you
[1:48:58] get healed in the altar, then receive
[1:49:00] that. If he sends you through a prayer
[1:49:03] line and they pray for you and you
[1:49:05] receive it, just receive it as coming
[1:49:07] from God. It wasn't brother so and so.
[1:49:10] It wasn't brother so and so. It was God
[1:49:13] that come. Amen. We have to recognize
[1:49:16] these things. Amen.
[1:49:19] No wonder a mother didn't get hit. You
[1:49:20] don't do it like that. See, it's it's
[1:49:22] nothing that I've got to give you. Yeah.
[1:49:26] It's something that God already has
[1:49:27] given you. You just got to receive it.
[1:49:30] I'm just a testimony of his. I'm a
[1:49:32] testimony of his resurrection. He's
[1:49:34] here. The only thing you have to have is
[1:49:38] to have his faith to believe it. Amen.
[1:49:41] That's what God's looking for. Let me
[1:49:43] finish here, saints. Time is just so
[1:49:45] fleeting. Amen. I tell you, I just I I
[1:49:49] love this. Maybe you can just read it as
[1:49:51] homework here. 1 Corinthians 13. Well,
[1:49:53] it's only only five verses. Let's just
[1:49:55] read it. Charity never faileth. But
[1:49:58] whether there be prophecies, they shall
[1:50:00] fail. Whether there be tongues, they
[1:50:01] shall cease. Whe there be knowledge, it
[1:50:03] shall vanish away. For we know in part,
[1:50:06] we prophesy in part. But when that which
[1:50:09] is perfect is come, then that which is
[1:50:12] in part shall be done away. When I was a
[1:50:15] child, I spake as a child. I understood
[1:50:17] as a child. I thought as a child. But
[1:50:20] when I became a man, I put away childish
[1:50:23] things. For now we see through a glass
[1:50:26] darkly, but then face to face. Now I
[1:50:29] know in part, but then shall I know even
[1:50:32] as also I am known. And now abideth
[1:50:36] faith, hope, charity. These three, but
[1:50:38] the greatest of these is charity. Now
[1:50:41] look at this, my brother and sister,
[1:50:43] just to touch on this real quick. When I
[1:50:45] was a child, an immature Christian, a
[1:50:50] child,
[1:50:51] I spoke like a child,
[1:50:56] but now that I'm mature,
[1:51:01] I speak as one
[1:51:04] with maturity.
[1:51:07] Amen.
[1:51:09] Amen.
[1:51:10] You know they marvel
[1:51:13] my brother and sister how people would
[1:51:16] come and say I am the bride of Christ.
[1:51:21] Not talking about church
[1:51:24] collective.
[1:51:26] I am the bride of Christ. I've had
[1:51:29] people say how can you say that?
[1:51:32] Well I can say that
[1:51:34] because I know that. That's right. Yeah,
[1:51:37] I can say that because where I used to
[1:51:39] look through a glass darkly, the perfect
[1:51:42] one has come. That's right. Amen. The
[1:51:45] mystery, not mysteries. Even though
[1:51:48] there's many aspects contained in the
[1:51:50] mystery, it's not when you get the
[1:51:53] mystery revealed, my brother and sister,
[1:51:55] God will open it all up to you. And we
[1:51:59] stand here and when our eyes were open,
[1:52:01] not looking through a glass darkly, we
[1:52:04] saw ourselves all the way back. That's
[1:52:06] right. Through time and eternity and
[1:52:08] realized, no wonder I feel so
[1:52:10] comfortable in the presence of God.
[1:52:12] Reverence. We have reverence.
[1:52:15] But I feel comfortable. I'm not afraid
[1:52:17] of serving God because I've met him
[1:52:20] before. Amen. And he's talked to me.
[1:52:24] Right. Just seen a little clip.
[1:52:27] It was a very short clip.
[1:52:30] True story. a man walking down the
[1:52:31] street one day and there is a dog so
[1:52:34] emaciated it can't even stand.
[1:52:37] And as he belt knelt down beside this
[1:52:39] dog,
[1:52:41] he was like, "Oh, you poor little
[1:52:44] thing." He puts his hand down there and
[1:52:46] this dog is so weak it can't even hardly
[1:52:47] lift its head, but it growled. It's
[1:52:50] like,
[1:52:54] and when it did, something in his heart
[1:52:58] just said, "No dog deserves to be like
[1:53:01] this."
[1:53:03] Pulled his phone out, called his office,
[1:53:05] and said, "I I I I've got a distraction.
[1:53:07] I'll tell you later." And he loads the
[1:53:10] dog up in his car, and he takes the dog
[1:53:13] to the vet, and the vet says, "This
[1:53:15] dog's so sick, but what this dog really
[1:53:18] needs is some love. We can give it food.
[1:53:20] We can give it water. We can do all
[1:53:22] these things. But what it needs is love.
[1:53:27] And a couple tore up couches later,
[1:53:30] he still loved the dog. And the after
[1:53:34] picture, it turned out to have Great
[1:53:36] Dane in it. And the after picture is him
[1:53:40] and his wife and kids walking
[1:53:44] their big, beautiful, healthy bag of dog
[1:53:48] food a week dog.
[1:53:52] And he said, "Truly,
[1:53:56] it needed love."
[1:53:58] Just needed love. Exactly right, my
[1:54:03] brother and sister.
[1:54:05] Not a altar call, not a whatever. But
[1:54:08] you see, God never called us to be
[1:54:10] scrawny sheep.
[1:54:13] Never called us to leave us walking the
[1:54:14] fences looking over at the good grass.
[1:54:17] He called us to be content, to be nice,
[1:54:20] healthy, plump. That's right. Sheep.
[1:54:24] That when we would see our shepherd, our
[1:54:26] heart would rejoice. Amen. And we would
[1:54:29] say, "I thank you, Lord, for saving my
[1:54:32] soul.
[1:54:34] I was once lost, now I'm found." And you
[1:54:38] say, "Brother Paul, why are you saying
[1:54:39] this?" Because I'm not sure we
[1:54:40] appreciate him enough. I'm not sure that
[1:54:44] we are giving enough praise and
[1:54:45] thanksgiving. And maybe I'm just
[1:54:48] speaking for myself. Forgive me if I I'm
[1:54:50] covering you with the same brush, but I
[1:54:53] think it's really time for us to break
[1:54:55] through and realize I am his sheep and
[1:55:01] this is his pasture and he called me
[1:55:05] into his pasture and loved me.
[1:55:10] Loved me. Amen. That's what matters.
[1:55:13] Amen. Because you see that scripture
[1:55:17] didn't apply just to the Corinthians,
[1:55:22] my brother and sister.
[1:55:25] 13.
[1:55:27] And now abideth faith, hope, charity.
[1:55:30] These three, but the greatest of these
[1:55:33] is charity.
[1:55:35] As I close,
[1:55:37] Amen. Sister, if you'd come, musicians,
[1:55:43] I'm preaching to myself, saints. Don't
[1:55:45] think I'm just talking up here like a
[1:55:46] hypocrite.
[1:55:48] If the greatest of these is charity,
[1:55:52] how much charity do we have? That's it.
[1:55:59] Let it touch our life. Let it touch our
[1:56:01] thoughts. Let it touch everything about
[1:56:03] us. How much charity
[1:56:06] do I have on display? Lord help us. Lord
[1:56:11] help us. Amen. Amen. Do you believe the
[1:56:15] book is opened? Amen. Do we see who we
[1:56:19] are? Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. To see
[1:56:22] ourselves
[1:56:24] as our Lord Jesus sees us. That's what
[1:56:27] we need to do. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:56:32] Let's just stand. sing a song or two.
[1:56:35] Invite our brother Alex. I trust I
[1:56:37] haven't kept you too long, saints.
[1:56:40] Father's Day once again. God bless all
[1:56:42] the fathers. Amen. As we look at this,
[1:56:48] I just this song come to me this morning
[1:56:50] and I I just uh want to sing it. Maybe
[1:56:54] doesn't quite fit with the whole context
[1:56:56] of everything, but uh number 606.
[1:57:00] Amen. We shall see the king. Not I hope
[1:57:03] to see the king. That's right. But let
[1:57:06] it be a declaration. I shall see the
[1:57:08] king. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:57:13] Start us, brother Alex. Amen.
[1:57:21] There's a blessed time that's coming,
[1:57:24] coming soon.
[1:57:28] It may be evening, morning, night, or
[1:57:31] noon.
[1:57:34] The wedding of the bride, united with
[1:57:39] the groom.
[1:57:41] We shall see the king when he comes.
[1:57:47] We shall see the king.
[1:57:50] We shall see the king.
[1:57:53] We shall see the king when he comes.
[1:57:57] comes. He is coming in power. We'll hail
[1:58:03] the blessed hour.
[1:58:05] We shall see the king when he comes.
[1:58:11] Are you ready? Should the Savior call
[1:58:14] today?
[1:58:17] Would Jesus say, "Well done," or "Go
[1:58:20] away."
[1:58:23] My home is for the pure. The vile can
[1:58:28] never stay.
[1:58:30] We shall see the king when he comes.
[1:58:36] We shall see the king.
[1:58:39] We shall see the king.
[1:58:42] We shall see the king when he comes.
[1:58:48] He is coming in power. Hail hail the
[1:58:52] blessed hour.
[1:58:54] We shall see the king when he comes.
[1:59:00] Oh my brother, are you ready for the
[1:59:04] call
[1:59:06] to crown your Savior, King and Lord of
[1:59:10] all.
[1:59:13] The kingdoms of this world shall soon
[1:59:17] before him fall.
[1:59:19] We shall see the king when he comes.
[1:59:25] Yes, we shall see the king.
[1:59:29] We shall see the king.
[1:59:32] We shall see the king when he comes.
[1:59:37] He is coming in power. Will hail the
[1:59:42] blessed hour.
[1:59:44] We shall see the king when he comes. I
[1:59:48] shall see the king now. Oh, I shall see
[1:59:51] the king.
[1:59:53] I shall see the king.
[1:59:56] I shall see the king when he comes.
[2:00:01] He is coming in power. I'll hail the
[2:00:06] blessed hour.
[2:00:08] I shall see the king when he comes.
