be the psalm of our night the words in the night father may be songs that come to us of Victory Lord of worship Lord sharing of the grace that you have given us so freely Lord let it be bless your Saints tonight I pray Hallelujah God bless you Saints I would just like to expound for just one moment on this unspoken prayer request that I have placed before you this is a young lady that by God's grace several years ago we were in some meetings overseas and we got to see the absolute Supernatural power of God break a satanic bond in this young lady's life and set her free Lord she's went on to get married she's went on now to have her second child and as I was speaking with the brothers as they contacted me and just asked us here specifically knowing this relationship going back and said brother Paul please pray and have your church pray you see Satan's trying to take that testimony away what he's trying to do is March into the very temple of God and say this isn't so but I tell you my brother and sister when God has written it it will be so amen and so we rebuke Satan in the name of Jesus Christ for this young sister's Deliverance that she could come to her right mind as the as a brother shared with me he says it's like she has lost her mind to see ly overnight just lost her mind and my brother and sister That's what Satan wants to do to you and I now we can say well maybe there's this circumstance or maybe that circumstance we can call it postpartum depression we can call it a lot of things it's nothing less than the devil and a frontal assault against a daughter of God and I just en ask you encourage you just to continue to lift her fervently and lift our young people not just the ones here tonight but those that are associated with this assembly lift them up my brother and sister because Satan is trying to bring a frontal assault if he can't do it by subtility he will simply do it by a frontal assault and just the blast of the devil amen and it's just been a very heart stirring thing for me uh to hear this report and uh I you know just have as a wonderful memory this young sister there are actually many young people in those those Services uh that uh God come and did a mighty work we didn't do a mighty work amen I tell you we would stand and be able to declare we're not even worthy to undo the latchet of his shoe that's right but in spite of that he has called us to be his representation oh thank you Lord amen I'd like to speak to you thank you so much beautiful song service I could tell you the thoughts that I have had in the last couple days uh or last few days actually starting uh uh even this last weekend uh this song Service uh uh encompassed all of those thoughts and just drew them in and I say thank you Lord our musicians and uh brother Alex obviously God uh in my thoughts amen uh God just divinely directed this song Serv service amen I want to speak to you I have a question mark in my title and I want to speak to you tonight on what is your vision and uh I take that from Proverbs 29:18 amen that we we know these scriptures and uh my brother and sister as we would just go right into the word uh Proverbs 29 and 18 tells us that where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he and I've heard it questioned before people say uh this vision and the people perishing and the law connected together in one verse but I believe as we go there's actually quite a bit more but I even voice this to Sister Jerry you know I'm just I'm going to quit writing this down I've got to stop right here because it's just keeps expanding out and uh we'll look at this and we will come along in a little bit here by God's grace and tie this together Heavenly Father we just ask you father just come tonight you know the needs of each and everyone you know father our heart's desires and the circumstances of our lives and father truly I was blessed Lord just thinking of this young sister uh our friend Father and thinking of the circumstances surrounding Our Lives the battle is not ours father the battle is yours amen and father we're here tonight as soldiers in the army of the Living God father we're not here for Satan to come and make his boast but we're here to stand solid upon the word and father we make our claim tonight Lord that the word has preeminence in all things in our lives and father forgive us for the shortcomings of our life when father we in our flesh try to bring the solution when we in our flesh try to find the answer when truly the battle is yours Lord we commit this service tonight in every circumstance in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you you may be seated amen God bless you Sister April I think that uh I keep saying where's sister April and and uh some some have said well you haven't exactly been at church on Wednesday night your own self and U but by God's grace we are here and sister Gabriella uh used any excuse she could I think I don't know uh but uh trust that she had a a good time um uh wedding and grandparents and friends and so God bless you in that time now as we look here in Proverbs I intentionally just pulled this little excerpt out of the scripture it's of a greater picture my brother and sister uh that is presented but we want to just uh draw in on this tonight and you know my brother and sister uh Visions can come from the Lord in night or day amen and Visions often times I I would just have to speak this from my own point of view because I don't know exactly where each and every one of you would would uh have a perspective but we can look at that and um you know sometimes we get the idea of the word says about a vision and look at scripture it's it's used a lot I I on purposely didn't write them down because I don't want to make the significance into a number but in the message brother brandham uses speaks the word Vision uh over 3,000 times makes reference of that and it's uh many times uh in relationship to uh things that are happening in his own life and if we're not careful we would think that Visions would only come uh in a spiritual context as it were to a prophet to a minister Etc as that is but I want to draw another point of view tonight and um we realize that uh each and every one of us is Sons and Daughters of God led by the Holy Spirit can we say Amen that is our goal is not to have our own leadership we do not want to build the kingdom of Paul or apply your name there but that's not what we're looking for I have a vision for doing this but yet my brother and sister we see often times in the human element whether you're talking naturally or spiritually if there is no vision and I don't say this to boast of myself but many years ago I prayed often I prayed often Lord let there be a church in this city that would just want to serve you just want to hear the word not all kinds of Dramas and not all kinds of other periph real things just a church of solid people and my brother and sister in my vision of that time I had no clue what God would decide to do I just knew that I had a heart's cry that I wanted my family to attend to church with real Believers with real solid people that just wanted to stand and and uh live the word out and that was my vision at that time but yet we'll find often times that God says well because I placed a burden upon your heart you're going to be part of a vision you're going to be part of an overall picture that we're doing and so we see these Visions can come from the Lord but yet they're not a vision as it were that the prophet of God is speaking of that is there finds himself standing in the middle of his bedroom floor with his hands lifted up in in this and when he comes to himself realizes his wife is in the bed and and he is in this Vision has been in that and we're not talking about that kind of vision but my brother and sister we as humans need something that we look out into we look into something that we have as it were we might say a goal or something that is drawing us forward and we could go to Webster but I decided just to leave those things alone but my brother and sister you see Visions come from God night and day and we don't always have a image as it were before us that is in the misty Veil often times times God would bring as it were a vision to Sons and Daughters of God by speaking in the spirit to you amen there's no image out in front of you but there is a vision taking place inside you cuz remember you are the temple not made with hands in this hour amen and God is now displaying his vision inside his Temple and projecting it out as it is not as it were a wall not as it were a screen but into the very life of the believer he's projecting that into them and my brother and sister what is a vision well I tell you I say in my own thoughts here a vision it can be by revelation of the word you pick this up I want to just place this and I hope you can understand me tonight when you read the word of God and you see these things in the word of God do you realize God has given given you Vision into his word and you can see yourself in the word you can see your life you can see your family you can see your future in the word that's God's Vision to you and it's not as it would be a super spiritual vision but it's God giving you an Insight calling you into the vision and now my brother and sister if I could say so to get into the vision God's Vision you have to get behind the veil to have the vision amen now God will move us from our carnal positions into a different position but that Vision or that calling of God is taking us Beyond the Veil we cannot sit here and say that we have a spiritual life and never go behind the veil not it's not it's not a position to boast about not a deal like to go to YouTube or some other thing and people are like oh I had a vision my if you went on there and called these people the Judgment then in the last year or two I had a vision the world's ending on this day if they were called to accountability for that but no what do they do they just go on with another Vision they just have another Vision they have another Vision the whole time none of them lining up with the word but they have followers in the millions and so does our Lord Jesus Christ Through the Ages his followers have counted Amen brother brandham talks about it's going to be a small number a small number compared to what my brother and sister still going to be a lot of people Amen in glory there's going to be a lot of people there because God Through the Ages has been calling them and he's gave them a vision I said Enoch had a vision Moses in all the struggle had Vision amen all of these men Through the Bible had Vision I'm telling you what man would take his wife into another nation and there she is not maybe even realizing the change see God blinded Abra Abraham also he didn't have Vision that the vision was coming to pass but there's a king saying Hey I want to marry and she's what your half sister I want to marry her because you see sometimes God clouds our vision to not see what the real vision is coming forth like in the time of trouble in the time of struggle you don't feel like you're a Son of God Victorious and Overcomer of this age you don't feel that way but if you have have a vision by revelation of who you are in the word it no matter what is happening here you recognize that's who I am by Vision amen and without that Vision my brother and sister the scripture says that we'd be cost tossed about by every Doctrine you see it took Vision to see the word of this day it took a heavenly vision we often times think this is only for super spiritual people now my brother and sister every one of the bride of Christ will be be led by Vision amen amen the seeing of who we are because if you don't see who you are then you can read the Bible and it's just religion exactly but when you have Vision to see who you are you have Vision to see yourself in the word that's right you know the prophet of God said Catholics make great Believers when they're converted and the reason is is they're so used to being guided now the average message Believers a rebel I'm not talking about you guys I'm talking about somebody else maybe it is people like us but you see some of that training is because in the message Satan has tried so hard to derail it that every time there's a powerful move there's always some kind of other move comes in and tries to parallel that and people get Leary and when Ministry would say you know what God's going to do this or speak direct people they tend to back up because they don't they don't know the last time we encountered something like this it was wrong but I'm telling you my brother and sister because the word promised there is a day and I believe it is here now that God's going to stand behind the word of his ministry it's his word not man's word and it's going to take place and God give us the wisdom to know and to step into that and I I have a little uh saying I I I cherry-picked out of a sermon Amen to to go along that line if you don't mind later amen now when you see the vision of the word for the day you see the vision of God in you amen Christ in you the hope of glory when you see these Visions my brother and sister these are gifts from God now you can get all leery about all this stuff and and say well I don't know about this I don't know about that they're acting awfully spiritual well I hope we all have Vision enough one day to act spiritual a vision one day to be able to say God said it I believe it am amen and so we can move forward now you might say the Lord's never blessed me with a vision in the sense that the prophet had or seers Through the Ages have had but if you have Clear Vision tonight I don't want to put anybody on the spot but I just want us to have an opportunity to express it do we have Clear Vision tonight amen we have Clear Vision because God has given you a vision amen amen we're not looking at religion and hoping my brother and sister it's it's amazing I I I didn't even actually know these people were Catholics sister Jerry and I in a conversation I made a comment and she says well they act like they do because they're Catholics and I was like they are Catholics he says they are Catholics my brother and sister maybe some of us need to go have a rewind into the doctrine and the Theology of Catholicism just far enough to believe what we're told come on I don't be don't take me too awfully serious here and frown like I think we need to go back to Catholicism but my brother and sister there's a people that are coming up out of the word amen they're not coming to the word they're coming out of the word they believe it it's who they are and they identify with it and if God says you're healed they don't care about their circumstance I'm Healed if God says you're delivered they don't look around and say but they say I'm delivered amen you're the bride of Christ I am the bride of Christ because they have the vision of the word living in them that's right and without that Vision if I could say so we become intellectual that's right and we can quote and we can do all kinds of things but not one ounce of life ever comes out of it right my brother and sister you can put a long hair long dress and nice haircut dress decent on any man or woman amen I've told you before about the lady we went to some college classes with Carrie you know I was sure she had to be a Christian everything about her was just polite and correct and nice and atmosphere long hair and long dresses dress modest and the day I sprung it I was fully expected her to say well we're Holiness or we're this and she just looked at me dumbfounded we're hi hippies so we can produce that kind of life with a hippie Doctrine but we don't want to preach hippology here in the church do we so that we would all just be nice and kind so we start out with a new hippie version of the message no my brother and sister what it is it what separated to carry this lovely nice lady just turned out to be a great friend and whatever of that time my brother and sister that was all well and good but what is the difference is Vision she was that way because it's comfortable for her she she wanted to be modest she wanted to present herself like a lady while she served beer at the Beer Garden in boisey but you see my brother and sister what is a separation a vision of who you are that's exactly right now Satan did say you don't measure up to her or you don't measure up to them but if they don't have Vision my brother and sister there's nothing there to measure up to that's right it's the vision of the word the coming to them is what makes the difference that's right amen now right here in the deity of Jesus Christ brother brandham puts it like this oh how we love him this morning may every Christian this morning see the vision quickly Lord the hour is getting late and I pray that you will let them see the vision and take hold of Life today and live forever before we ask it in Jesus name amen so the prophet is speaking this word out Lord let the people catch his vision no sir the vision of the word the vision of who they are the vision of the word in our hour God's plan to catch that Vision will change their life that they would come to to a place and the hour being late my brother and sister that was 1949 if that was late what is it now now much later but we can't say it's past due because God's never late see we have a problem and I I'll expound a little bit on this in in just a few minutes if the Lord just leads me that way my brother and sister there's a whole Spirit moving through the message that we have missed something because of where we are in time well you know Brother David the prophet of God said the Rapture was going to just take place right here and that dat's coming went a long time so really well he said that he wouldn't lose the one Lord I hope it's not me but if I'm the one you're still waiting on Lord let me get ready let me not look at others and not look at other churches and other continents and Nations and other politics and this and that and the other let me go to the word and look at myself amen amen so it is see when you catch that Vision then you can take a hold of life now maybe I'm reading too literal in this but I'm taking it my brother and sister if you can't see the vision you can't take a hold of Life see seems pretty definitive to me but I'll just leave that a little bit loose that you can interpret it your own way right this is after all just a little bit of a glimpse that I and and you can read before this and after this and make your own conclusion but to me my brother and sister there's something about the vision and life that is very interconnected amen see now my brother and sister what we're seeing right now taking place in the world is very strong very profound and some people would say oh don't even look at what's going on in the world has nothing to do with us but I I beg to differ I say that what's going on in the world has a lot to do with us and it's not about our Eternal destination it's not about our understanding it's not about our Salvation or our healing but it is my brother and sister all of these prophetic pieces falling in place and we can look then by Revelation by Vision we can look at what's happening now my brother and sister you guys all know who Jonathan K is no doubt and here he is with some very good Insight uh tying together the very day that our president of the United States not our president actually because we're not of this world Amen but the president of the United States signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act and they shot the great Rainbow on the front of the White House and do you realize my brother and sister that the date corresponds to the time that Israel was trying to justify they unlawful by the word marriages to the uh Heathen uh uh uh uh around them their marriages into this country and this country and this country and all of the things you take that and bring it forward and the Hebrew calendar and all of this stuff now I don't think that has anything to do with us other than to show us God's on time yeah and he said now president Mr President you might not think much of that but you did this in the perfect time piece to this right here and it lines up perfectly now my brother and sister when's the last time you thought about the Hebrew calendar start checking what happened in the news every day back to a Hebrew calendar but I say a man like Jonathan KH God would put them on the earth Amen to speak these things in an irrefutable manner it's not necessarily bride food but it's not leftovers either and so we see how God is perfectly on time timing these things matching these up and this evil here has a corresponding place in modern time this has a corresponding place this has a corresponding place and my brother and sister I tell you what if we did enough research we'd find out that Enoch had a corresponding place in our day amen of people who are going to walk off the earth not die walk right into the presence of almighty God I'm not smart enough to figure that all out and put it all in there but I know my brother Enoch has an influence on me amen he has an influence because the word called him forth and it was a life he had vision of who he was he lived Godly and that was there that God says time to go home and I want to live an Enoch life am amen I don't want to just talk about Enoch life I want to live Enoch life amen so what's going on we could go into all the details of what is happening in Israel Hamas their assault upon women and children their killing of babies my brother and sister that spirit's not new that's a Herod Spirit that's a Hitler Spirit that's a stallen spirit that's all these things that go back in time even long before Herod amen the way to control a nation don't start at the top and go down start at the bottom and move up because when you start at the bottom you can put fear in those at the top and control them with fear and so you look at what's happening there that has a corresponding understanding and it's profound and it's shocking and my brother and sister we should not let these Natural Things overpower our spiritual vision we can look at the news I bring this out because I know of an individual right now that has in their mind decided all of this that's happening that we've missed the Rapture and we're in the tribulation and therefore if that's the case then brother Brown lied to us and they're backing away from the message because they lied to us and we're now in the tribulation I'll tell you how shallow this sounds like judgmental but I'll tell you how shallow their vision is and they're only seeing the corruption bursting forth a little here and a little there and when Hell Comes To Earth my brother and sister the scripture describes it well enough Locust with teeth and women mocked and people in tear my brother and sister that is going to be the hell on Earth that the word of God is talking about that's going to be tribulation and we've had it so good as Christians that we think a little disruption in the world is suddenly this is tribulation well my brother and sister I spoke at the other day and I will stand upon that again judgment's coming on America it's coming on the world and while we're still here as Sons and Daughters of God you're going to feel the effects of that judgment whether it's in the economy whether it's in pandemics whether it's in this is in that we're going to feel that we're going to see how the rules are being tightened and tightened and tightened and they're going to get to the place they want to see every penny and where every penny went and to be able to control that and shut your life on and off and all of these things it's right here and we may or may not have to go through the fullness of that I don't believe we will the prophet of God talked about the bride going home before the rap uh before the tribulation amen being raptured before tribulation now my brother and sister but where do we draw the line for tribulation well I'll tell you what if our vision is is that this is too hard now and God allows time to carry forward will our vision deteriorate no sir you see my brother and sister I was just reading about eagle eyes that's it if we had the equivalent of an Eagle Eye we could watch an ant crawling from the roof of a 10 story building yes sir right God give me eagle eyes give me eagle eyes to see what is going on you don't have to show me everything Lord just give me an Eagle Eye and so if I could be boastful tonight I believe the Lord has given me an Eagle Eye and my brother and sister what's happening in the White House and what's happening in the Kremlin and what's happening over in Beijing and what's happening all over that my Eagle Eye didn't pick that up but when I saw a bride who's coming in unity with the word my Eagle Eye focused on that and said we're getting close because there's a people who are valuing the word of God much more than the things of this world the influence and all of prosperities and all of this the Eagle Eye is pulling and the Eagle Eye is pulling us to the word and we're seeing ourselves in scripture we never saw oursel in before well revelation 10:7 I see myself in there you beten Malachi 4:5 absolutely right I've see myself amen that's right now don't misunderstand me tonight Malachi 45 people say it's all about the prophet it's about the prophet it's Vindication of the Prophet but he says behold I send you so he's talking to somebody else and my Eagle Eye says that's me that's right he's talking about that's who that conversation is taking place place with was me God was speaking to me amen amen that's right so we see that my brother and sister what's happening the natural it's kind of scary it's kind of shocking it's all of this stuff but if we're not careful amen people believe that brother Brenham said throw the television out because of I love sus and all of this stuff but you know what I see a television doing in this day and age planting more negative Spirits in households amen than any other thing on earth a direct line from Satan's Throne Room coming right in to the house talking to an individual recently and they said I am so afraid for my grandchildren's future and I asked them why looked at me like I must be crazy well look at the condition of the world but the minute you try to turn the corner and talk spiritual to them that's right the door is slammed and you hear the deadbolt click go on be afraid I don't say this lightly these are people I've known for years and and considered to be good friends that's right but you can hear the deadbolt clicking they would rather dwell in the fear that is known to them that's right than the fear of the Lord which is unknown to them amen fear is an amazing thing I don't want to lose it but I want to be controlled by the right fear amen reverence Amen to my Lord so what's happening there's there's battles going on all around us any of you have battles this week yes sir amen those of you that didn't lift your hand please pray for me I I need your prayers but my brother and sister we have battles but look what's happening every aspect of our life there is a battle going on there there's a battle in well-doing have you ever felt like what you're doing seemingly makes no difference a battle in well-doing yet the scripture addresses that directly don't get weary in your wello doing remember that God ordered your footsteps to go he ordered your hands he ordered your thoughts he ordered your heart this wello is not you being a good person and becoming tired of it it's you hearing the voice of God and following that voice and then we do well amen hallelujah and look what another battle and sometimes I struggle so hard with this a battle for our attention distraction here distraction there distraction distraction until you almost feel like you need to just close yourself up in a dark room to cut out the distraction but my brother and sister all it is is Satan vying for our attention he's vying for our thoughts and he's vying for our time tick tick tick on the clock because he knows he can waste it look in football they have perfected this amen do this little play kill the clock play this play kill the clock do this kill the clock do the clock but if you're ahead you want to do that play where you go and I don't know much about football anymore I tried to forget most of it and the clock is ticking and they're out there doing their fancy little doing their little thing you know whoa oh yes oh tick tick tick and 31 more seconds I'm a winner and Satan's tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick if I can just keep their attention that's it I read a little quote the other day this man said I'm amazed we hardly have time to sit in church the preacher takes too long but we can sit for hours and watch our favorite team slaughtered by the opposition ex right thought and that that's Sports in the day we live in amen they can sit there till the last minute jump up bust the furniture no no they shouldn't allowed that call still behind by 50 points yeah but their attention now look the scriptures tells us in this day that there would be no natural affection this is a real case real issue I've dealt with the sister concerning this she's not not here her husband come home home eat supper goes out waxes his car almost every single day she told him I feel like throwing dirt on your car and he says I don't care if you do or not I'll just wash it again no natural affection to a wife and children but he loves his black Mercedes H now if you have a black Mercedes in your garage I'm not preaching to you it's just a car and if I find that you have too much affection to that thing I'll be on the other side be assured I'll be over there praying the thing breaks down and disappoints you because this is just carnal stuff that burns up amen it's going to be burnt in a fervent Heat and to turn the Mercedes back in to iron ore that's right but you see my brother and sister all of this takes place natural and spiritual and I I don't want to sound judgmental okay it's not like I run around with a magnifying glass looking at everybody's life but you really can see where priorities are placed in lives where people are at a brother told me once sorry to go off into example but a brother told me once we kind of actually found a little humor in this he said brother my family needs help buying groceries and he says well the church can help you but he says now I have a few questions if you don't mind he says sure sure he said um you make uh you know you have a really good job over here in this place and they pay really well and make money he says why don't you have money for grocery oh I'm saving up to buy a new pickup placed a pickup over the welfare of his own family and thought it was perfectly normal that we should pass the offering plate and you should pay his grocery bill while he saves for a new $90,000 pickup you see my brother and sister there's no vision right there that's right they're caught up in the whims right every wind of Doctrine the doctrines are unending of the effect they have on Humanity I don't know if I should go there we have young people with us I'll just leave that part B but you see my brother and sister I want you to look at current events not with fear but with fulfillment this is the word of God coming to pass a prophet if you study the message like we should you'll find that the prophet of God speaks of these things and they're laid out it's right before us we should be able to come and say here it is here it is here it is here it is and with that kind of pinpoint accuracy we shouldn't have one drop of fear we should be saying praise the Lord cuz here it is when he says God is looking forward to being in the presence of his bride amen when we look over here and God he says that God loves this bride so much he gave himself for her amen that's what we ought to be looking at it's not about what's happening in the world oh otherwise you know what I'm a cheap skate I'll I'll acknowledge that you know I saw a cartoon that was very accurate it showed two cities with missiles flying out of them and explosions up in the air and explosions in the city and it had a little deal our tax dollars shooting missiles this direction then it had a caption over here our tax dollars shooting missiles over here why it's got to come to pass but let our vision be reflected that in the time of travail Earth shaking travail there's a bride who is getting herself ready she's standing there and sees herself in a smutty dirty world she knows she can walk in the word without a filth on the Hem of her garment she knows that in this age that she can be the Overcomer she has confidence in her bridegroom it's waiting in anticipation for her presence amen amen and and these things the ultra critical would say wait now isn't this already this and that you understand what I'm saying amen The Book of Revelations my brother and sister it speaks of a lamb's wife making herself ready it also speaks of this same Lamb's wife who has a voice that is calling out in the end time a lamb's wife whose voice amen the spirit and the bride say come are we speaking what's our vision and we're going to speak of what our vision is my brother and sister and if we're talking about what's wrong in the message look I'll tell you the passing of our brother Billy Paul amen has stirred up all kinds of hornets nest there's some over on this side saying see another failed prophecy some over here saying oh oh these things didn't happen that didn't happen I understood it to be my brother and sister God didn't come and ask you what you understood God asked you to stand and believe amen cuz look at this there's false understanding come on have we ever had that fuss with the wife I thought you said this no that isn't what I said no that's what I heard well it's not what I said but that's what I heard but the minute I stopped the pretext you see I'll blame myself in this the minute I stopped the pretext that she had to have said what I thought she said then the conversation gets much better we put the vases and the glass jars down and but you see what happens is that so many people are like the prophet said this is that really what he said you have to get behind the veil to know what the prophet said you've got to get into the vision I tell you we got to become one with the prophet's Vision we can't say well I you know let me let me put this it's a it's down a little ways but I want to insert it right now you've got young people in this day right now standing up with some of these apologists going around to the universities and whatever else and a young man standing up to a mic and say um are you trying to say that um I'm not a Christian if I disagree with God I thought the apologist iy did a pretty good job he said well mostly God doesn't care about your opinion opinion I thought that was pretty pretty nice but this young man's sincere am I still a Christian if I disagree with god well I I mean let's just cut the rubber to the road young and old we know to agree with God I think we aren't Christlike otherwise God would be disagreeing with himself so we can't have Christ on the inside and disagree with him and say we're one yeah but see how Satan is got it in and they have a different Vision they have a vision that we can disagree with God that we shouldn't have to do this or we can do what we want or this and that and still be a Christian so a false understanding a false concept gives you a false vision of the word and that leads us to false conclusions so when that's when I I preached here a few Services here talking about seeing who you are and seeing the word and and my brother and sister you see that reason that is so necessary is because if we have a false conclusion no matter what is placed before us we are thinking in an entirely different light entirely different light and when you come to a false conclusion you have brought brought face to face your vision and God's Vision will they reconcile I know who I'm speaking to tonight so don't take this in this context but are you going to drag God's Vision over to your vision or are you going to submit your vision to God's Vision the problem we have is too many people feel so strongly about their Vision that they are willing to pull the word over I don't know if I should go into that or not but maybe I will you know when you have someone Post online the sister's husband is a husband son is a minister and somebody in their little assembly posted a question can a divorced man be a pastor preacher why they posted this I don't know they had some kind of motive but it was quite interesting to read how people's responses were and these are message people responding and you realize marriage and divorce and the word Timothy there's a whole another Vision in the message I'm not being judgmental of any individual that's just a I guess you might say convenient example now do we explain a way why our vision is different than the word or do we lay our vision down and say Lord help my vision match your vision my brother and sister it's simple but it's not because this touches every aspect of our life I'm just going to go ahead and be blunt the scripture tells us take communion and people go forever and ever and ever and ever never take communion you ask them why don't you take commun it's not convenient for me well the Rapture might not be convenient either submitting ourselves completely to the word of God might not be convenient but something inside says I need to I want to am I preaching too hard amen okay good you see what's happening when they come up with this this is a case that we're we're kind of uh dealing with when you come to a false conclusion then the devil says now the prophet's gone his son is gone there's been no rapture we were misled the world's in the tribulation I'm gonna quit serving God now that sounds interesting doesn't it because let me just put it this way forget about how you feel about certain things can I just be real blunt tonight what does what happened with brother Billy Paul's life and the state of world events have to do with your relationship with Jesus Christ exactly right our vision should supersede that's right anything that's it should be above and beyond and not measured by anything of this world but if we've set our vision to a lower standard then when this person backslides we question what we believe I'm sorry my brother and sister when the pope does what the pope does I don't give much consideration to it because my calling and the Pope's calling are two entirely different callings amen he's called well we won't go there anyway but you look at this my brother and sister but you can tell and this is what's led me into this thought to bring this is when people are measuring their Eternal destination by this circumstance this circumstance this circumstance this circumstance they did not have a vision of Jesus Christ in their life they didn't see him as the Redeemer they didn't see him as the grace and the mercy and the blood wash that come the lamb slain they didn't see him they were looking this person is my inner connection if you have that you're a Catholic and have never left it behind our vision is not as it were this message with these things our vision is the word it is the word made flesh and living amongst us and yet people's vision is so low that this person fails they falter this person moves away they start getting cold this event takes place they question is this whole thing true but it is in this time my brother and sister the word said when you see this take place look up Amen Let Your Vision not ride in the world in the dust of Leo deia in the tracks of the S serpent amen if you guys want to hear a really good sermon go listen amen from brother Danny steaman preaching trle the serpent at Living our literal life amen he lays it out just so beautifully my brother and sister I'm not looking at the trail of the serpent what's the devil going to do today where's where's the where's the devil at my brother and sister my vision is so far above him my vision is not what he does or what he thinks but my vision is a vision of a heavenly vision going into the heavens because that's where I was called to that's where you were called to was into the heavenlies not stick our nose and track the serpent my brother and sister you talk about getting dizzy and forgetting who you are you stick your nose down in the devil's business and the devil will twist you around to where you won't know who you are and why you are here that's right amen the devil says gu give up you missed it well that's the devil's job why are we listening to the devil anyway okay devil draw me a map into eternal life you know what he would do he'd take that piece of paper and he'd go here you go and then I'm not making light but I just want to make a point people that say I'm going to follow this oh before I can believe the Bible I need to learn Hebrew and then to understand the Hebrew I got to learn aramic and then I got to go visit all the holy sites and I got to go interview a bunch of Palestinians and a bunch of Jews and wait modern day Philistines you realize the lineage is still in Israel and you'll find these people you know I need a PhD I need to join the biggest Church in the city I need to get voice lessons I need to do this I need to let me tie this back together the clock tick tick tick tick and we think we wasted a few minutes on a family video or movie or YouTube how about when Satan gets in there and Wast a whole life you see how deceptive Satan is I personally know people 40 years in the message cried shouted praised God shared testimonies of the supernatural 40 years later have said it was all wasted but they don't realize my brother and sister as Satan realized all he needs is control of the last five minutes win or lose is always determined in the last five minutes yeah yeah if I could just throw something in the natural out to you sister Jerry and I are working in Mountain Home we're eating at Smoky Mountain Pizza right there in the Main Street coming off the freeway in Mountain Home and there happens to be a television on some sport deal on the wall and I have to admit all the noise all the sports all the whatever I kept glancing up at it if I was backslid I'm backslid but I'm sitting there eating my little pizza so yes I was backslid and I don't even remember the teams it was unimportant what I saw take place is what was anchored to me and here's his team they said oh they've been they've been in the be since the moment of the game started they've been on the lead and it comes down and the other team in 3 minutes does this wild crazy play and boom they're ahead now and this whole sideline of this team that's been ahead for how I don't know how long the football game is they're all just frowning and they're just all the cheerleaders there's no cheer left and Desperation that team it's down to like three seconds four seconds they hike the ball the guys are running and crossing and doing their whole thing and he throws the ball and it's flying and there is four Defenders surrounding this receiver there's no way he's receiving anyway I mean face it when we come to church and the devil's sitting in front of us beside us behind us he's he's right there the word's coming forth It's been past our way he's jumping up and he's got his hand on his shoulder he's whispering in your ear he's pulling you this way pulling you that there's no way you're going to catch the word and this Defender leaped higher higher than anyone football coming down and he tries to catch it one handed like this and he hits it and it flies over here hits that helmet flies over there and bounces off the shoulder of that guy comes over here hits the face mask of the guy next to him and flies over here into the end zone where the offensive team this guy is standing there and the ball goes touchdown and all the sideline Defenders and offensive everybody the camera pans them and they're all like and literally the guy who caught the ball suddenly is like looks down yes yes yes you know that might very well be us making the rapture the devil's got us surrounded by Devils he says there's no way the word's going to get to them that rapturing Faith ain't going to come but God says it can't be stopped I've never lost a one and whatever it has to do it can touch this and touch that and go here and go there it won't matter because that man who is in the end zone that wasn't even the intended receiver still believed enough to run to the end zone he still believed enough to play his part of the whole story if he had stopped short out there somewhere that ball would have bounced on the turf and it would have been all over but when we will walk and say Lord this is a vision you didn't tell me how I would be an overcomer in every single detail you just told me have a vision and walk the straight and narrow you go I'll get you there but we get drawn this way Satan wants to get our vision over here I want to get Vision over here wants to get Vision over there and we start looking at around everybody else I don't know if Brother David had been in the end zone he could have caught the ball Titus he'd been too short maybe couldn't run fast enough in these boots and this and that and that and that I haven't seen that brother in the altar in five years well maybe his altar is in his house maybe God didn't tell him he had to come to this altar what's our vision let our vision be on the goal let our vision be on the word hallelujah amen you see my brother and sister the devil says give up there's spirits in the land I'm just going to be blunt enough to say there's people who tried to plant this spirit in our church that says now if God is in you in the way you you think he is then he's off The Mercy Seat my brother and sister the bride of Christ has no fear of God being off The Mercy Seat amen the prophet himself put in these words and said the mercy seat is in the heart not on the page not on the bookshelf amen not in the CD in the console but the mercy seat is in the heart of the believer you know that means Wherever I Go Everywhere You Go The Mercy Seat is with us amen praise God amen amen I'm sorry to be so blunt but I think there Comes a Day we just have to call black black and white white amen and Grace is not our compromise amen amen the bride knows that this work he began this individual that's all afraid now that we're in the tribulation so that means we've missed the Rapture my brother and sister they don't believe they're not seeing the vision where God said that this work I have began in you that's it I will finish it that's right they're not seeing that their vision is looking at chaos Hamas you know that that word actually means chaos one of its definitions is chaos so chaos has come to the land a fulfillment of scripture God told him he'd that told Israel I'd bring chaos to you for your Disobedience showed up but it also showed up in the last war War before that and weeks whatever we're driving through Israel we're coming to a border a lot of story went with that particular border pretty interesting story somebody asked brother George what's up that way he said we don't go up that way anymore because they surround the buses and they bash all the windows out of the buses we're in a Palestinian occupied area we don't go there and somebody saidwell does anybody get off brother George says if you get off the bus they'll beat you to death that's chaos but you know that's nothing to the chaos of the spirits that are moving up and down these streets right here that's right that's nothing compared to the chaos that's in our Public Schools that's right the chaos that's in our government brother Chris preached that about how that that those Spirits are hidden in the church we're going to take that my brother and sister in the context of church overall nominal everything chaos chaos I made a reference the other day I felt kind of bad for making it but I'm going make another reference and I'll feel bad about this but my brother and sister when you got a church full of two three th000 people I'm going to be really kind and say a lady with hair as short as mine getting up and telling the church about the vision she had last night I don't know there's just something in my vision that says I can't accept that Vision because that vision is not fitting the word not judging the individual the lady appears to be a very nice lady but that doesn't fit the word so the channel of my vision it's not in the picture sister Jerry took a picture when we were in Israel I don't remember what church that was but there's a window and the church would be behind where the pulpit would be and a cross is in that window Christian church and sister Jerry positioned that cross just like crosshairs on the Dome yeah I remember at the time joking with her almost looks like you're siding a missile or something but I don't bring it up to do with that I bring it up that's how zeroed in we got to be that's right that where we're going the cross yes sir is our Crosshair amen is our guide that's it not what this brother thinks not what that church is doing not what these people over in another continent are doing my brother and sister what are we doing amen if we will get our crosshairs our Focus On Christ alone then our prayers will change those around us that's right we have loved ones we say I want to see my loved ones saved well praise the Lord the prophet of God says apply the token get your life right first amen then God will be obligated Amen to answer your prayers but you know what if I could close on this very happy note I don't know that God's obligated to a lot of our prayers cuz we're a Miss come on don't frown at me come on you guys know I love you I just want to know what's your vision what is it we're seeing where do we see ourselves career coaches start with where do you want to be a year from now where do you want to be five years from now 7 10 25 well I tell you what if I God would Grant it I think I think Paul's life need some cleaning up and polishing because the closer my vision gets the more Paul gets in the way the closer the focus of my vision comes there are more I realize Paul needs to deal with this and Paul needs to deal with this my brother and sister I don't think we're close enough or clear enough unless we look at our life literally and say Lord I need to die today that's it I want to die today don't I I don't need God to force me to die I want to die today amen and when our vision gets to that point amen I think we're really close to the Rapture I think we're right there to step over into that me or theophany amen oh my thank the Lord hallelujah you love the Lord amen I don't know if I take your time to go ahead and preach some of these other things I think I'll just skip over some some of this it's a it's different but it's the same but I will I drew a little thought out of the sermon I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision just a line here it's not even in the computer I didn't put it on there brother Gideon so I'm really cherry-picking okay I saw that one Cherry up on the tree there that was just the biggest most beautiful of all the cherries and I Cherry Picked brother brandom says if your faith is strong enough to throw yourself into the Vision it can be for you that's right if not it isn't that's it what is this Vision to us amen I want to be able to claim that Vision that's it I want to have enough Faith to say Lord that word was for me I claimed it amen and watch it come to pass that's right amen sister via amen you see I have a whole deal out tied to this uh and I knew I was just stacking up way too many groceries here but Joshua 1 1-8 I'll just give you a quick glimpse of this is when God is dealing with Joshua and says now after the death of Moses servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan and all this people into the land which I do give to them even the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall treade upon and I have given unto you as I said unto Moses and we jump right down here to verse S or verse six I mean be strong and of good courage it's no place for wimps my brother and sister are serving God in the ospice of the message it's no place for wimps God's weeding the wimps out go read a story about the Army Rangers or the Navy Seals these are fine men of great character but when they don't fit they're weeded out that's right and God is weeding out the wimps that want religion that makes them feel good I want religion that changes me well I don't want religion really at all if you understand the content but I want that but you know what I need to be strong and of good courage there's times I'm I'm not very courageous there's times I'm a little bit chicken-hearted amen now I want the reason I wanted to go on with this I wanted to bring this out because verse eight there in Joshua is talking about the book of the law is the book of the law it's the word do you realize now don't take me 100% in depth here but when you realize when people say I don't live under the law I live under grace you know what they're really saying can I interpret that for you I can ignore the word of God and ask God to help me when I want him to cuz I don't live under the law they don't live under this they don't live under this they just want Grace well I tell you what I want to live with the law so what's our vision of the law Christ in you that's right the hope of glory there's our vision of the law his word says I'll cleanse you I'm cleansed his word says I'll F you I'm filled his word says I'll change you I'm changed why I'm believing the word I'm believing and the law of Nature has to follow the law of God God bless you tonight amen I've kept you just a smidge long amen hallelujah someday I'll learn to control my studies amen let's just stand I'd like to just sing a couple of those old hymns that kind of struck me amen 93 don't lose your vision of Jesus Amen key of f amen somebody help me Amen brother Alex if you're done you're done interpreting you come help me pray for me Saints I tell you I was so sick last night I uh yeah I went to bed last night and I woke up just feeling Beyond horrible realized i' only been asleep for a few minutes not very long at all and uh I just struggled through the night kept waking up just very sick won't go into that detail and uh you know I just thought oh man you know I'd had a little conversation brother Chris and I thought man I I should I should change that but there's something bubbling up inside of me that says you know I I really would like to preach this I really like to preach this you know so you know um I like roses if I die before I get out of here tonight I like roses amen you plant a rose bush around my headstone that way nobody will come and bother it won't tip it over because it can't get through the Roses but my brother and sister God's giving us that kind of zeal to serve him sick healthy sick crippled whatever I want to serve him I want to give myself to him I want to make myself available for God to work and you know I felt well probably about 5:30 this afternoon I I finally felt better and praise God I went and sat down and closed my eyes for a minute and and uh well praise God here we are and if it wasn't for the sake of that clock I'd finish this sermon and we'd get out of here about 10:30 but my brother and sister that's the Zeal I want to have for my Lord Jesus that's the heart's desire that's the vision that I want to see if I have to lay my life down I going to lay it down for this word I want to lay it down for the Saints Hallelujah be quiet don't lose your vision of [Music] Jesus Oh keep your eyes ever on him many friends and dear loved ones have fall their way they have lost their vision of him oh don't don't lose your vision of Jesus keep your eyes ever on him many friends and dear loved ones have lost their way they have lost their vision of him let that just resignate in our hearts Satan comes try to
