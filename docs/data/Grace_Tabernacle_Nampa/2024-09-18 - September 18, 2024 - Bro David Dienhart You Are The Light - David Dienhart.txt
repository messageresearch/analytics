the reality to the bride is that she can believe that he is he's present not a history he is a history not an I was he was not an I will be he will be but what is he now present tense here he is he's in this assembly tonight Veil behind skin he's in his bride today and around the world our brother David ministering around the world what's he preaching to who's he preaching to unbelievers no he preached preaching to those that can hear the word what does hear the word they have an ear to hear it what does hear it receive it not everybody can receive it can they Brother David but is that our business no our business is scatter the light it's not our business whether they receive it or not or who can receive it our business is scatter it because there someone will receive that what if we scattering if we're not scattering the word for the season what season are we scattering it's out if we're out of season it won't do a bit of good but we bring the word for the season that's where the blood is that's where the cleansing is that's where life is eternal life amen amen thankful that we can come in unity with him in Union amen before we open the word let's have a word of prayer our heavenly father we do thank you so much for this time that we have to be in your presence once again together Lord this is an individual fair but you brought these individuals here this portion together tonight and we're expecting you Lord in the unity of your word and the unity of your spirit to bring about your predestinated desire and Lord we're expecting you to unveil your words speak the word to the predestinated seed and let them see further as we all desire more of you we desire more of your presence more of the reality and revelation of yourself in us our position our positive position we pray for your glory and honor now as we ask this in Jesus Christ's name amen amen if you want turn with me in your Bibles i' like to turn to Ephesians chapter 1 we took this last Wednesday as we were on the second part my my my title tonight is a little different than it was last time and it's been different the last time than it was the first time and I just I just I thought I could understand why Lord because it's just expanding and so my title is you are the light let me just rephrase that not my title his title but I'm saying it as he would say it my title you are the light his life made manifest part three he are the light his life made manifest what is his life made manifest for it is light it is the light and the and the the Bible said ye are the light Jesus said I am the light then he said and ye are the light because why you are part of me to begin with and you are manifest in your season in your time that makes life his life manifested the word for the season but you are part of that word is being manifested and that's light now Darkness can't stand before light bride just recognize your position Lord Darkness cannot stand before light amen and the light is risen upon the bride it's not risen upon anyone else in this hour but it has risen upon you amen you're that manifestation in the in the time of insanity and gross darkness and everywhere around us we see nothing but chaos brother brandom said it's chaos like it was in the beginning when he said let there be light we've come he said back to that same position if you'd like to know where he said that it's on the message preached in Prescot 65 10:31 morning if you want to pick that up chaos he said it's back to what it was the beginning and what are we looking forward to we're looking for this Earth to have its baptism and we're looking for that baptism to bring about a body change in this earth when we step in the Millennium we have new bodies amen we've already we're standing here with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the seed is that birth word that spoken word for the season manifested we are we are received we've receive that what will that do for us it'll take us to a body change it is taking us to a body change little by little we're part we're we're taking the land amen of the Holy Spirit himself that's our place that's who we're called to take that's our position so my subject tonight is again as we took last Wednesday that special class of people brother Brandon referring to that in the in the church age book that special class of people is those that can and that have the ability to hear from God to hear God speak amen they have the ability and only she has the ability to hear the word or hear from God Amen so Ephesians one I want to read this again chapter or verse three blessed be the god of and father of our Lord Jesus Christ now what was our Lord Jesus Christ it was the manifestation of the father in flesh as son is that right who was this person he was absolutely the seed of God how many say Amen to that amen amen all right so blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha past tense already blessed us who's he speaking to whoever was in him is who he's speaking to yes amen because he came forth with the fullness of the godhead bodily God was in fullness in him then then being in him somewhere we had to be a part of him and in him before the world began then then that's what I am amen and so God blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings CU I was in him in fullness I was in him then because why you and I are part of him bless blessed us with all spiritual all not just some all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ what is this heavenly places it is the position of the Bride it's her position amen then where is she coming from where is where is she come where do you realize you came from Heaven to come to this earth to manifest what heaven consists of the word amen all right now verse four according as he hath chosen us when who according as he hath you didn't choose yourself amen he he chose you nobody else chose you but he chose you you're a special individual you're a special class of people according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be wi before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame there's your holy Holiness holy life holy living that we should be holy who's holy he's holy that we should be holy and Without Blame Without Blame before him in love what is that love it's his love himself in love having predestinated us positioned us placed us unto the adoption of children maturity of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of whose will his will his will how many can believe this how many can individually believe this amen blessed are you that can believe it because to believe it is to say he is right now he is all right then to the praise adoption of children by Jesus Christ according to the pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted he hath made us that's that's that just Thrills my soul he has already made me accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood that blood was perfect blood wasn't wasn't sexual burn it wasn't man it was God's Own having Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the The Riches of his grace see grace are you saved wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom wherein he hath abounded toward us did we deserve it no why did he abound toward us in all wisdom and and Prudence because we were in him we were part of him amen we were we were his redeemed subjects we were himself to be manifested on Earth having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in him s there much we could read we continue on reading and that would just satisfy it and we could go home with that much and say blessed be the name of the Lord I see my position but let it be I pray Lord Lord let it be a revelation to each of us personally you need more of him you want more of him what are you asking for Lord more of revelation of yourself personally how many believe he's personalizing himself to you amen he's becoming very personal isn't he it isn't I and him but him and I are one it's not two now it's one it's no longer Twain now we're one amen all right now let's go to one more scripture while you're standing Hebrews I get to reading and I get to preaching then I leave you standing Hebrews 10 now that would took no great revelation we can see that right okay Hebrews 105 wherein when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body but a body hast thou prepared me Amen in burnt offerings and sacrifices to sin for sin thou Hast no pleasure then said I lo I come in the volume of the book Hallelujah may God reveal this to you personally each one of us individually that I've come come in the volume of the book the book was closed book amen but you're the words in the book go back to Daniel and see you're the word in the book brother Braham said the bride is the word in that book she's the book all right he said lo I come to do thy will oh God he taketh away the first no excuse me verse 7 then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will then to do thy will oh God above when he said sacrifice and offering and burd offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither had pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he Lo see he's referring back to this again then said he lo I come to do thy will oh God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second amen you may be seated the Seven Seals the seals that sealed the book brother Braham said who were those seals Christ was those seals he said then what would the seals be revealing it would be revealing Christ amen so we see that the Seven Seals that sealed that book amen would reveal the person Christ himself to whom he would unveil the person to whom his bride all right then he said like brother BR referring to this he said like we could go back we don't have time in in Genesis 1 again or two like he opened Adam's side and took part of his flesh amen he said now he said he took part of his flesh part of his body which was what his his wife the feminine which was his wife amen now she was part of his flesh and brother and the scripture said in the appointed time that God brought her to the man other words he brought her to her position what about this appointed time God's brought her Amen to her position what's her position he made known to he revealed himself unveiled himself to her brought her to himself this special class of people I said is the only one that can this bride has the ability to hear from God see brother Braham said she I'm I'm saying I'm saying what he said but this is what I'm what we're saying this is this is not just rhetoric this isn't not just quotes brother sister don't accept it that way this is speaking this is speaking to us individually amen men she was taken from Christ amen she the bride there's a bride here tonight she was taken you were taken from Christ she is flesh of his flesh she is bone of his bone just as Eve or it wasn't even Eve Mrs Adam that's right was flesh of his flesh she was the mystery of Adam unsealed so what was unsealed Adam was unsealed amen Amen brother Bram said the opening of the seals was for what purpose to show the bride where she started I'm just paraphrasing it I you can come back to the exact scripture you paragraph 12 rising of the sun he said this opening of the seals was for to recognize where she come from who she was and where she was going and how she'd be revealed here in the end amen how she was revealed in him in the beginning how that she would be known and revealed in the end this was God's Great hidden Mystery amen and brother Bram referred to it as the mystery that was in the back part of his mind amen she was taken from Christ so she today is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone brother when Christ went to Calvary he went with you in him he had not been separated yet he was both male and female but he had his body in him he that was his body that he would be able to bed himself in who was he the seed Where Were You Who were you that germ in him he was the seed you were that germ you were that seed in him amen amen what are we looking to today that seed what are we recognizing today that seed made manifest so she was taken from Christ she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone amen so so the so here we are this message therefore shows the bride her origin that he is now present as we said that he was and will be what he that was and will be is now she is yoked with his yoke he said take my yoke upon you then she is yolked with his yoke she is his body his prisoner she's directed she's guided she's led by him alone what a position what a positive position the bride is the body she is him the bride is him flesh of his flesh bone of his bone she is him now that's hard for an unregenerated unconverted man to to accept because they can't amen the the the flesh man cannot conceive this this is not something that can be received by study by that's got to be a revelation given to you personally because you're able to receive it you are the prepared ground able to receive that life amen I'll come to that a little more as we go here he said then the bride is the body the bride is the body of the word which is Christ Christ is the head of that body amen she's a part of that head that body she is his bride she is the Flesh and bone of Christ brother BR said what would the bride be the bride is the Flesh and bone of Christ that's what he said amen he said now his now what is she she's his bedding ground of of his germ seed amen outside of that body outside of that body or outside of the of the body of the head if you're not if you're not if that's not if you are outside of that brother brandom said you're lost amen he that's a direct statement he said you're lost outside of the word being in you outside of the word being in you you're lost or or haven't recognized where you're at yet you just haven't come to realization of where you're at until he finds you you're still lost right we were all lost but we found he found us what did he find himself he saw his seed he knew it he predestinated it amen he not only predestinated that seed he pred designates the body to receive the seed amen that's right now you're not your body now is not in its rightful position but he still ordained that body you came anyway but you came in a perverted way but because you were you were predestined in him as seed then it then he had to have a bedding ground to place that seed to to Quicken that seed in to to pour it out in amen and because you were a part of him always where was that pre-prepared bedding ground all right now we are his the bride is his body his sons his sons his his body his sons children born of his spirit in his bedding ground birthed amen amen turn me to Second Corinthians a moment while you're doing that he says when did he choose us let's go back and look at this a moment I'll just read this first when did he choose us brother Bram speaking before the foundation of the world when his great hidden Mystery his great secret when when his great hidden Mystery his great secret he said predestinated there's the mystery predestinated there's the mystery he before Christ or anything else was ever on Earth you see his great mystery that he chose the bride amen that mystery would have to come to the place where it's unveiled now watch this is what he said in the message Christ's mystery of God revealed paragraph 394 he said notice secondly now firstly now we know that this secret is known this seven seal mystery is known and known made known in a three-fold manner amen now he said firstly but God's firstly God man now see God's great mystery that the what the Eternal God had as a mystery has now been unfolded in Christ in Jesus Christ first fold then given right down to his church so all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured where into his church amen amen all that he was all the mystery of God revealed was poured into his bride yes all right what was once in God's mind is now now I'll stop right there let's go back here next secondly so you know what second means he's given right down to his church then second next secondly the manifested Christ in you Christ in his his son now Christ in you the hope of glory now manifest Ed Christ in you the hope of glory that great manifested Christ manifested excuse me God in Christ now that great manifested God in Christ is manifested in you look what was once God's Great secret great mysterious Secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believer now this is what Satan is trying his best to keep HID but he can't keep it hid it's been unveiled to a select few amen is now this has now been put in the hearts it's now been put in the hearts of the believer that is the body of Christ what is the believer the body of Christ what was once God's Great Secret in his mind before the foundation of the world is now made manifest we are living in this day to see This Promise unveiled revealed Manifest this is what's known to the bride this is what sets the bride apart from the church you know the bride's taken out of the church amen in fact when the seals were open Prophet Saidi no more consider you a term church he said I'll call you bride yes he did go back and use the term church but he always referred to it as the bride herself amen she was called out yes but now she become more than just called out now she becomes a married woman amen totally a different amen now she has unveiled in her this life seeing it knowing it seeing this position she has is now made manifest he said think of it and so this particular people he said if the bride is to be the word now let me start back up here what a great thing it is today Lord to know that now we are united united keep that word United this is uniting time and we've already received the sign of the uniting amen what that sign point us to the Bride In Christ becoming one yeah for what the wedding supper exactly what he said pouring himself into her who else where is he pouring himself pouring himself into her Heaven opened Heaven came down Heaven's United how many know Heaven opened yes amen what opened the word opened what was the third pull it was the opening of the word and it was manifest to us Amen on Sunset Mountain at sunset time in Sunset dispensation at the end what was it himself uniting manifest a sign uniting he's come to unite with his body amen and the Mystery is that uniting that only she can hear now it's no more a mystery to you because you've been taken to the man God has taken us to our position and showed us clearly he unveiled the person Christ to you and I now we're not serving an idea some some theology some feeling we are serving a person we are here right now we are here one with that person we are we are here obeying his word amen do you recognize he's here he said he that cometh the God must believe he is Hebrews 11:6 he that cometh to God must believe that he is he's not will be he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen amen is that right that's right for without faith without that Revelation because the believer the True Believer is the Revelation that Revelation the True Believer is the faith of God moving moving amen it's not just it's it's moving in you amen the word is living it said now it's being manifested life is being manifested who life Christ Jesus own life is now being manifested in a form called The Bride it's not not another person it's the same person amen moving in you and I amen so he says he said now great thing is to know we're United with one spirit let me just refer this to you in first Corinthians I was going to read it later but I'll just say it right now he that is joined unto the Lord First Corinthians 6:17 he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit he is joined United he that is united with he that is joined with where he come out of where he's brought back to back to that Union back to that marriage the marriage has come even the opening of the seals he he performed a wedding to make us sure that we realize the wedding's performed it's performing of that Union that wedding amen and by the opening of it you can come to him now and come ready be with didn't get to this little bride here God's got to her first and this time this time amen this end time Hallelujah you can't touch that little bride she'd come back up she couldn't hold that life in the ground it had to come forth it would laying there but it had to come forth again and it came through Luther through Wesley to Pentecost made way for the Holy Ghost himself to come right down in completeness the word again then he that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit he said right here now we're United with one Spirit one Spirit the Holy Spirit has got the word in his grip amen then the Holy Spirit has got the word in his grip where is the word today who is she where is this word that he's got in his grip other words he's got himself he's come to himself he's got himself in his grip manifesting himself as he promised he would in his great mystery she would he would be known he would come forth he would have a bride this would be this would be himself manifested in completeness know you not that Christ being in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing is that right Christ in you makes you that complete Revelation where is his completeness in where was his mystery where was it being known when he unveiled himself he unveiled her she come forth in the unrevealing and unveiling of himself it was for her we even see him in the midst of the church dressed like a woman in Revelations 1 yeah exactly he was he was he was a that's what exactly the prophet say see notice this he said here he is in the form of his bride who is here who is the form the son of man the son son a man was raling himself in the bride form through those ages building his body amen and comes to its head now we have the head messy the head is being united with the bride they are no longer Twain we're realizing we are one nothing can nothing can move and stop this bride from being manifested and going home in a body change nothing nothing can stop that nothing can stop it nothing can stop you being the word am for one Spirit he other words he's got us yok to one Spirit what was he yolk to one Spirit what are we yok to Same Spirit take my yoke upon you my yoke is easy he's given us his word how much easier is that but who standing in the way your enemy your enemy is not the reveal word your enemy is this this carnal man that's the greatest enemy you've got put your name there David dehart is the greatest enemy I've got but the word brings it under submission the word brings it under control if you'll let him do it you've got to let him you give him the headship you give him the deity what's a wife give her husband if the wife doesn't give her husband headship has no headship he may be the head but where's the headship without her giving that headship to him he can't come to his position he won't be in his position he might as well just be single you might as well be single too because you're putting yourself as an idol before you instead of serving the word and here we are listening to lying vanities putting lying vanities as our Idol instead of taking what the word said you're forsaking your own Mercy amen because Christ is here he's here now we're serving a person we're obeying a person we honor a person do you realize that person is here do you realize what it was who took the book who took what was whose sword was it in the hand of that Prophet it was his sword right it was the king's sword was the king the man William Bram no then who was it standing there as he said he would come through a prophet and stand there with the sword in his hand who opened the seals who took the book who who cried out as a lion that Roars who put his word in who put his word did not he say I will do nothing but I reveal my secrets to my servants the prophet so he himself stepped forth he became steep forth took the book took the sword in his hand held the sword in his hand and Loos those seals who do you think it was you think it was a man that did that no it was God himself standing there as a man taking the sword in his hand amen and opened and loose that word who did it Loose to you and I amen hallelujah all right so if the bride is and he's got the word in his grip and watch what he says he's got the word in his grip comes in us where is he coming in us I wonder if we can see the mystery of the seven seal the prophet said was his coming is his coming over with no his coming goes all the way out here all the way and it blows out into this into the Millennium out of the Millennium into the new City amen it's his coming it's all the coming of the Lord but what part are we what part are we playing if he doesn't have his bride then none of the rest of it comes to manifestation it's his coming and he's coming in the form he's brother Brandon made it very clear it's the bride coming of Christ it's not another it's himself she's here to Reve one person the son of man right now many will stand here and listen to this and say that's a bunch of that's a b why my goodness what do he think he is and who does he think he is I don't think I'm anything it's not the first birth I'm gloring in it's this second one it's the second birth see if the bride is to be the word then she's got to be of Christ part of the bridegroom yes she's got to be the word word the word not for his day she's to be the word of this day that he promised would be this day that he and therefore he sent his word forth to mold his bride and to make her he said hope we see it can you imagine how hard that was to to pull out of the Pentecostal Shu and to recognize and bring the people to seed time to him present now that seed himself Jesus himself birthed in you birthed in me through what his promised word amen he transforms us changes Us by the word he didn't come to change another he come to change you and I that were in his thinking that was a part of his thinking that was a part of his plan amen we're not just happen to be just running around just happy gol lucky we have a we have a purpose we have a goal we have absolutely don't let us lose sight of that let us press toward the mark for the High Calling of that goal don't get your eyes has been brought many times that little riding that bike on that plank don't get your eyes around here keep your eyes on the end and stay steady you are the word you are the word moving you're the word moving you're the opening of the word you you are the revealed word yourself you are the faith of God moving in you amen he said now she's the word of this day that he promised would be this day so he sent his word and mold his bride hope we see it how did he bring Christ here by the word of the prophets is that right how will he bring his bride here by the word of the prophet if there's any I'll tell you what I am so thankful for this message it's not just a message it is the Living Word it is the son of man revealed it's exactly what it is it's you and I it's you and I it's you and I Hallelujah that's what it is said he said how did he bring Christ your the word of the prophets is that right he said how did he identify him when he come if he was if he was how did he identify him the seed the seed word Christ the son of God how did he identify him when he came by a man with the spirit of Elijah upon him come out of the Wilderness is that right John the Baptist how did he identify him he couldn't be identified only by the message of his prophet that was God's way has he changed his pattern no he hasn't changed his pattern now watch he said he said he sent the forth his word now watch he sent forth his word now watch keep hold that how did his word Come To His prophets he sent forth his word so he identified him how by a spirit of of Elijah come out of the Wilderness that's how he identified behold the Son of God be I'm pleased whom I'm pleased to dwell in hear ye him all right and what is he saying today he's still saying hear ye him for the voice she's to be by under a messenger is become the final voice to the final age she is who is she then she's the word amen hallelujah she's the voice of God himself in this hour amen all right that isn't taking away anything that's bringing to what he said to manifestation this day this scripture is fulfilled in our very sight in our ears Among Us hiding in Simplicity manifesting himself in Simplicity unveiling himself in a bride that nobody would even consider that this is the way he would come it's a mystery unveiled it's a mystery brother David it's a mystery revealed and if you see it how are then you identified where are you identified if you see that living in the word and you see your position in that am then it's identification watch he said so he brought him by he identified him by a prophet how will he identify his bride 1933 in the river amen then as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ your message will forerun the second is that right then how are we identified by Malachi 4 Revelation 10:7 message Malachi 4 that Prophet does two things amen one he takes those loose ends that were lost Through the Ages and puts them together is that right and then he opened that top up and then they become white stone with nothing R out he said I've got to go west to receive this he said then his message was the mystery and secret of that stone which you are Hallelujah you're little stones of that same Stone you are then the revealed word you are than his manifestation of himself this day this scripture is Among Us it's here he's here standing himself in his own body his own bride his own seed being manifested who's going to hear it now very many that I don't care that's not my business of how many they're there but they're in I can say this scripturally they're in the minority amen how many say Amen to that straight As the gate Narrows the way and few there be that find it amen but thank God you found it and if God has revealed and opened this to you he's identifying I found you you found it amen amen all right this is the satisfaction of the Bride so he sent his Prophet amen how will he bring his bride here by the word of the Prophet how did he identify him how will his bride be identified he promised in Malachi 4 the same thing before he destroyed the Earth here we are why do we see judgment why we see it striking why is California under judgment we know it is brother Ram said judgment has begun on the west coast is that right he said it's already begun he was crucified aresh by the churches put on Calvary brother Braham said that earthquake in in Alaska in 1964 was the sign of that time that he has been officially put out what's the next one I say next what next Earth remember there's an earthquake at his resurrection what are we looking for what are we expecting every day brother sister I'm such under expectation I walk out there in the morning early I go out there and I'm not saying it has to be that way you may be driving down the road I don't know where you'll be but you're going to have something appear before you your loved ones it's that close I know it's close I wish I could pull it out and express it in bright shining Neon Lights it's that close I don't think there's anyone that has a revelation of this holding it within them that doesn't know that and realize that how close I don't know I don't know I just know that every moment I'm looking for that one to appear what am I looking for because when I know that appears that it's that time is time for my change which I've looked for we'll be caught up together to meet him in the air how many's looking forward to that but what do you have to have first to get there you've got to have the revelation of this abiding in you it's always been God's way to reveal it then by revelation thy faith thy faith has made you whole thy faith has done thy faith thy faith has changed your body is that right that faith will do that amen it's Revelation brother sister it's Revelation he did not reveal himself to no other but his reveal his bride amen the rest of them can have an intellectual idea and intellectual but how do you know it's Revelation because it lives itself through you you don't have to pump up you don't have to work it up it's going to happen automatically it's going to be there because it's his life and the works that he did you'll do also what was his Works to believe to absolutely Hold Steady on that word and hold that word in every situation I don't care what happens that word is your absolute you'll hold right there and said thou there is my works and it's got to be manifest amen amen Hallelujah so he brought him by the word amen now now I don't know how far to go with this I'm not going to go much further I'll just have to pick it up again but I'm trying to hit these high points of this now turn to Isaiah or second Corinthians 4 I didn't even come to that did I 2 Corinthians I've just got off the first page even 2 Corinthians chapter 4 in verse six now we have a Ministry I think that's very clear we have a Ministry Revel or 2 Corinthians 4:1 says we have a Ministry that we've received Mercy what's our ministry we've received Mercy then as freely as have received freely give yes amen as we said don't start looking at your lying vanities out here the senses what they tell you that's not your head Jonah said Jonah said I'll look I'll look once again to the temple I'll look once again to where God's dwelling where does he dwell in what's he does he dwell in his church or in his word the Catholic priest said God dwells in his church brother Bram said God dwells in his word then if his word is in you that's where God dwells amen amen and you had to be in him to be the word so 2 Corinthians 46 for God now watch verse 5 We Don't Preach ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for jesus' sake for God not another himself God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness amen did he command that what was the spoken word was what the Original Seed is that right then the then God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness hath shined in our we put my you put my in there my heart to give the light to give the light what is the message God is light this then is the message God is light and him is no Darkness at all in him amen is there any Darkness at all in him no shadow of turning the Bible said if there's a shadow then there's Darkness mixed in it is that right but there's no darkness in him you've got to recognize your position that you are the light the reason you're the light because you're his life see what God's driving at here you are his life so God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light to give the light the revelation of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face that in the face is in the person of so how's God manifesting himself he's manifesting himself in the person of Jesus Christ in you that's exactly what the prophet said the new birth was he said the new birth is Jesus Christ revealed in you unveiled in you amen he said I'll build my church on that Revelation and the Gates of Hell will prevail against it so relax let off the pressure the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it then quit looking at your at your vanity vanities and look and keep focused on the word amen the word that abides the word that's directing the word that's guiding you the word that's leading you I'm coming to that just a minute if I can get through it before we have to close here amen why Amen Let Me finish the scripture in the face of Jesus Christ in the person of Jesus Christ amen did you get that but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels what is it then it's a hidden treasure but the treasure to you and I have been unveiled oh my I find this treasure amen I I can't give it to someone else it's my treasure it's the treasure he let me we find the treasure worth more than 10,000 worlds this treasure amen for we have this treasure in Earth and vessels Earth and vessels sexual born vessels mortal vessels but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels why because there was a seed that was there amen is that that God that God was the seed The Germ brother Brown said and in the age that you were to come on come in by the word The Germ the word found you that bedding ground because you were meant to be together one he had to come to his bedding ground just like you being a part of your father you couldn't know your father until your father had Union with your mother the the appointed predestinated portion of himself the bedding ground then the bedding ground through that you could be known to father because you started growing is that right then spiritually God had to have a bride amen he had to have and and and he said she would be come forth he knew the color of your hair he knew your stature he knew your build he knew when you would come who you might marry who you wouldn't marry he know know was all about you and he ordained you because in him was that germ to begin with and he had to have that bedding ground to unite therewith for to Quicken that predestinated seed that you are amen amen amen amen see it's a mystery unveiled it's revealed amen you are already there I'm bypassing a lot I'm just taking see why can why can the Dynamics here you are a part of the mechanics you are always a part of the mechanics how I should say let me qu requ phrase that how why how come you can receive the Dynamics is because brother Brown said you always were a part of the mechanics amen but when you came into the Earth you came through a perverted fashion but you always were were Amen in him so when you came forth to receive life in your season your time there was something that he put there called the predestinated seed that had to that water had to come forth and that germ had to come to its bedding ground to to its position the Dynamics and the mechanics had to come together amen there you are without mechanic just mechanics no good word only no good Dynamics only still no good but when the Dynamics and mechanics come together then you see Jesus Christ revealed made manifest the same yesterday today and forever that's you hallelujah amen now you were a part of the mechanics the Dynamics found this ground to manifest through then how does he manifest himself through the word the mechanics mechanics Were Meant For Life to come to the mechanics to manifest what to make the change to bring forth your to bring you in fellowship with himself oh Hallelujah there you are see I can't brag he said I'm my first oh I'm didn't yeah I finished that Isaiah 9:2 it says a great light is sprung up Isaiah 9:2 said the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light and they that dwell in the land of the of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shined is that right it's Isaiah 60 verse1 and two right there amen God is light it's it's Psalm 23:5 amen though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fear no evil for thou art with me you're walking with God Amen all right you're walking in the light Darkness may be around but it's not total darkness because you're walking in the light so a part of you that's that was complete you were complete but now the word has come the light has come it's sprung forth a resurrection in your soul and now that light becomes a shadow I mean that Darkness excuse me becomes a shadow because of the light so you don't have to fear the shadow Don't Fear The Shadow it's just a shadow a shadow only reveals that there's light and you're that light you're that birth word you are the word born bride to the word born to the word born son predestinated as he was makes the word seed flesh in you just like it was in him amen amen amen all right so I can brag of my second birth because the first man is natural Earthly but the second is the Lord From Heaven so I can brag on my second birth I can brag on the inside word that's unveiled that's risen brother sister do you realize when he raised from the dead that you being his his own his child his seed that you raised with him right then it's it's done done it's finished you've already resurrected Hallelujah when were you saved before the foundation of the world you're just now carrying it out and make it manifest that you were amen do you understand what it just said amen amen there you are glory to God why does a bride get so excited about these things because it's it's the Revelation it's the word of promise it's the message of the hour hallelujah we're not preaching something out here that was passed we're not preaching a Pentecostal message we're preaching what Pentecost brought to manifestation made way for this is what he made way for the seed himself is revealed behind flesh in flesh today amen all right now the second is the Lord From Heaven that's present in you you are walking with God yoked before the foundation of the world his prisoner amen now it says in in Isaiah 9:6 For unto us here the great light is sprung forth for unto us what the light come to do for unto us a child is born I've got to get to some part here that I've got to get to before I close but listen for unto us who's us is there any us you say well that was Jesus Christ it sure was and it is now unto us a child born he say well Brother David how do you mean he born what is you what is the bride bringing forth is she not bearing children that's right is that right unto us a seed's been quickened unto us individually the life has come to manifestation unto us a resurrection's taken place that's taking us to a body change do you realize when he rose you Rose with him what does Easter mean to us it's an everyday Easter amen yes sir the holiday it's an everyday we're honoring the resurrection every day the person Christ is risen Paul said I'm crucified I want to know nothing but the crucifixion of Christ why because if Christ died he said I'm here to represent his resurrection amen I'm here to live out the resurrection I'm here in him he's risen I'm here to declare you a Risen Lord by death and without death you couldn't be risen without dying you can't be born again with without dying to self you've got to come to a death of self ex and receive him the resurrection to rise with him to newness of life so let me die daily so that the resurrected Christ can be seen in me through me amen the word working mightily not only in me through me what are we here for no other purpose no other reason we're here in this day for one purpose that's to bring the manifestation of the Resurrection to others that Christ is not dead he's here living amongst his people in his people we're walking with God as Enoch walk amen with raptured faith manifesting that daily all right so he said a virgin shall conceive he already said that see now I'm getting back here uh unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder what's his shoulder his body then what's on the shoulder headstone Capstone the word himself then what's the body going to do submit to the head is that right she will give she will give him Authority she will give him deity and and he accepts the obligation she he accepts the obligation and rest little bride rest or all is well well I don't feel like it quit looking at your feelings well I don't appear like it quit looking at what's appearing look at the promise Hold Steady keep your focus right there don't move off of that don't observe lying vanities you forsake your own Mercy then what's your absolute Christ in you you say but he's yeah he's leading let me get down here now I'm just going to bypass a lot here we know he's Emanuel so he's he's the governments upon his shoulders and the increase of his government shall not pass away amen he'll establish it oh my we could just spend a lot of time right there but let's go on see just look at you were in your father I said the other night you was in your father at the beginning if you wasn't you wouldn't be here but you see you had to go to a it had to go to a bedding ground in order to bring you forth now I've showed you that and I'm just going to bypass it it's all over the message you can find it you always wasn't God The Germ of your life which is an attribute of God was which was his thought always was in God what was that thought it was the thought of himself so what are you you're the manifested thought you're his witness you were with him from the beginning amen you're his life in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God the word was with God how was it with God when he spoke that this the spoken word being the Original Seed when he spoke his thought amen you appeared and when he spoke his thought in this hour for you to be here you come to yourself how by the word by the spoken word that's how he brother Bram said it's by the spoken word is how he births his children right the new birth is the spoken word that's why he said this bride is literally the spoken word seed made manifest you're his witness amen you're his witness all right so he saw you he saw you he saw where you were your name everything that was a bedding ground you had to come forth but there was a seed in his in him that had to be expressed and it was a expressed and you could receive it how may see what we're saying all right amen all right now only the rain can raise the seed if the seed's there you were in your F just like you were in your father and by betting ground of your mother you were made manifest in his likeness then the great God if You' got eternal life then the germ of eternal life was in God at the beginning and you were there you were his thinking you were in his thinking your name and all and he by for knowledge ordained you to see this now watch that little inside of the inside that little inside of the inside that's where you start don't miss this quote that little inside of the inside that's the holiest of holies brother Bram said which is your soul that little inside of the inside that's where you start that's the real you that's the real gift brother Braham said the real gift is that Soul down in there that could receive and hear the word of God all right then quit looking out here trying to make it the real gift out here the real gift is that inside amen all right that is the word there's your guide there's your leader there is who you are the very Pillar of Fire you are that shakina of Glory how many heard the unveiling of God he said if you enter in there where that shakina glory is what does that make you he said part of it because you couldn't get in there unless you come through the blood only the bride can get in there that is only her position there is the marriage bed there is the union amen amen all right so that little inside the inside that's where you start which is your soul from that you're a spirit coming forward now then you're Spirit many can stop right there in the spirit realm we we already covered that I can't cover that some more I covered that last Wednesday then you and then from there you become a living being so you're coming from the soul to Spirit to body are you with me makes you the complete living being are you with me yes all right now he said now the living being that outside man has five senses to contact see taste feel smell and here the ends the second realm has has five senses reasoning memory conscious affection amen I left out one but anyway you understand that's the outside body C taste filth here the inside body love and conscience and so forth five senses but the inside of the inside the control tower it's either God or Satan and that's determined now watch what I just won't go ahead of myself and you can mimic any of these things you can contact like a Christian now watch you can mimic he's not talking about the real believer now he's talking about a mimic now he said you can unless you're a real believer you unless you your beginning was that soul in there from God he said then that other can come out here and be actually in their Spirit Anointed with a genuine anointing of the Holy Spirit how many know that you know that Brother David you've seen it cross why every time we turn around it's it's you can never put your you can never put your confidence in emotions you can't put your confidence in gifts you can't put your confidence because you had chills you you shouted you danced the only confidence you have have is that the word is revealed personally to you living through you all right then here he said now he said now let me just read what he said you can mimic any of these things you can contact like like a Christian or you can cast out devils like a Christian you can you can mimic these things see the inside control tower the beginning if the if the beginning the origin isn't of God it'll never return to God isin't that something brother brandom you shouldn't talk so straight you scare people no you don't scare the bride it should do something to you this morning it ought to make you desperate I want to be sure I want to know I have that tug in my heart I'm answering that tug in my soul I want more of God and it's got to come through his Word of Promise for this day and let's start eating on the open book all right let's start taking the message and consume it let's take it take that and take it and let it bring light to the scriptures all right he said now you can you can if the origin isn't of God it'll never return to God do you understand it he said did you not did Judas not cast out Devils did he not cast out devils did Caiaphas the one who condemned him put him to death even prophesy didn't balum prophesy is that right what he said was the word of God it's even in the cannon of scripture is that right was he a false prophet or a true Prophet then what made him true or false all right he couldn't recognize the prophet he couldn't recognize Christ being being present in that little group of people out there following a prophet one both anointed prophets both anointed by The Same Spirit but one could receive and preach and manifest the word for the season and the other couldn't right now watch what he goes on to say he said he said you understand it did not Judas cath Caiaphas prophesy but he couldn't stay with the word see that's right all right that's so who so who's he bringing this message to he isn't addressing it to the outside world we can't talk to the sinner like this because he he knows nothing about it see now let me just go on here let me finish up with this right here but God wants fruit now Jesus wants fruit for himself I'm going to bring this to these things right here together he said now Jesus wants fruit for himself his wife must bring forth the kind of a child that he is you see what we're leading up to now see watch this if they don't if they if it don't bring forth children bride children word children then it's a denominational child then her first love for the is for the world and denomination she's gone back to that and many of them have that claim to believe this message now that's now watch he said he said she's gone back to that and it can't bring forth a real genuine born again Christian because there's nothing there to bring it forth what did the prophet say only the elect can be reborn because in non-elect there's nothing there to bring it forth yeah are you with me now if you understand he's speaking to you personally when you see this made manifest and see you're lining up with that word in you you've been identified there's no way the devil can reach in and take you out of there you're sealed in you always were in you always were his you always were yolked amen but the message had to come for you to see it to realize it to make it manifest it had to be made manifest through a bedding ground all right then and remember we are now as his bride pregnated with his Spirit oh my the church bearing children what is this that's come alive in me just jumping and leaping and rejoicing in the promised word and having a having a a jubilee what is it his child amen now the church bearing children so pregnated by his spirit with his name bearing his name bearing his life bringing forth the signs of his life evident with the pinenes evidence the evidence of his pinenes the evidence other words of his oversight the evidence of his resurrection this is eternal life and vindicates to the world that we are alive in him he said how can we contain that something's got to let go something's got to give away you get so full you can't get only so full you know amen how do you know cuz you're a church member because Christ is living in you so pregnated with his spirit that you're a prisoner to anything else see you're yolked you're confined oh my to the gospel confined to the word and all the children that you can bring forth is that because you're a prisoner them kind them kind that takes the word that's the kind that takes the word is God's true bride bringing forth children they can't die they can't die a child that brings forth a child the bride brings forth on the word can't die because it's the word amen do you get it because it's the word amen do you get it because it's the word amen do you get it she can't die that child can't die because it's a word child it's a seed child it's an eternal child Hallelujah we ought to be showing signs of pregnancy did you get that amen all right the life is in you like it was in Mary but what came out of Mary what's being manifested out of you what's it going to go to a body change this body will be that which is in me will take a have a new body it's his body amen all right now watch okay let's bypass he said I can do nothing if my father worketh I worketh hither to and I work as my father shows me you know that's St John 5 Verse 18 19 and verse 30 John 6:38 Jesus said I've come to do the will of him that sent me amen what about you and I amen he said the natural Man receiveth 1 Corinthians 2:14 the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God because they're spiritually discerned and he cannot know it amen he said but verse 15 but he that is spiritual amen amen receives the things of God so we have his potentials we are in harmony Jesus never never did nothing until first showed him of the father this harmony is now to exist between the groom and the bride this harmony will exist between him and the the broom groom and the bride he shows her his Word of Life reveals reveals it to her brother Brown said that's the true evidence of the Holy Ghost that he will show you reveal to you these things it's not love it's not emotion it's not this he said it's the word revealed to you all right she receives it she never doubts it oh could you compare a Christian I'm closing I'm trying my best to close now could you compare a Christian today with them Christians of long ago how them disciples walked in the power of the spirit moved by the Holy Ghost do it just a prisoner as I preached the other night a prisoner to the word and will of God moved by the Holy Ghost moved by the pillar of fire a prisoner to the word and will of God he couldn't even move until God moved him now what does that remind you of Numbers Chapter N9 when the Holy Ghost when the pillar of fire moved they moved when it Stood Still they stopped pillar fire pillar of cloud either one when it moved they moved when it stopped they stopped as long as it stopped they didn't go anywhere do you see the confidence do you see the prisoners ship that the bride has being yolked to that it's moving in you it's leading you you have confidence in that you don't have confidence in anything else you have confidence in that word leading you the pillar of fire leading you that's what we have that Pillar of Fire for amen it's moving his body moving every member moving you here moving you taking you here taking you over here and it brings it in such a Unity that it manifests one person Jesus Christ who's the bride what is this virgin word born bride she's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen oh that's it it's got to come wouldn't you like to see a church rise like that couldn't move until God moved him it's got to come Isaiah 30 this is the last scripture I'm reading let's Stand Together Isaiah 30 I'm sorry to take you a little overtime here but we had to get to this point Isaiah 30 and verse 20 and though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of Affliction listen to it and though the the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of Affliction yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner anymore but Thine Eyes shall see thy teacher amen what is thy teachers The Word of Promise for the season amen the ministry the god himself amen are you with me he said and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee saying inside the inside saying this is the way walk you in it when you turn to the right hand and when you turn to the left that's a still Small Voice that's the leadership of the Holy Ghost you can trust it you can confide it you can rest in it it will never leave the word it is perfectly on time all the time and if you don't move rest in what his leading is rest in his leadership rest in his moving rest individually amen praise the Lord so you're yolked by The Same Spirit therefore amen therefore [Music] how does he identify his bride
