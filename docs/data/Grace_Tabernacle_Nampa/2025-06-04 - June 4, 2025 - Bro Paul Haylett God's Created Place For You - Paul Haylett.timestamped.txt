[7:46] God bless you this
[7:48] evening. Amen. It's good to be here. I
[7:51] smiled when I see sister Sue come
[7:52] walking down the aisle. God bless you,
[7:54] Sister Sue. Glad to see her. Feeling
[7:56] better hopefully. Amen. Yeah. Good.
[7:59] Good. Amen. I was just thinking about
[8:01] our brother Andrew's service on Sunday
[8:04] there and talking about the
[8:06] approach. Um, one of the songs that had
[8:09] come to my my mind, well, I'll sing it
[8:11] on Wednesday night was, "He has made me
[8:13] glad." Amen. I will enter into his
[8:15] courts with thanksgiving in my heart.
[8:20] Enter his gate with praise.
[8:22] Amen.
[8:24] Amen. I will enter his gates with
[8:29] thanksgiving in my heart. I will enter
[8:34] his courts with
[8:37] praise. I will say this is the day that
[8:42] the Lord hath made. I will rejoice for
[8:47] he has made me
[8:50] glad. He has made me
[8:53] glad. He has made me glad.

[10:14] Amen. number
[10:16] 876. Been talking with the kids about
[10:20] faith and how sometimes, you know, we
[10:21] just don't have to understand it or see
[10:23] it.
[10:24] [Music]
[10:29] But there is an
[10:35] aren hand to
[10:40] me that leads in
[10:43] [Music]
[10:45] way I can not
[10:50] see while going
[10:55] through this world of
[11:01] woe. This hand still
[11:05] leads me as I go.
[11:12] Frosting
[11:15] to the unseen
[11:20] hand that guides me
[11:25] through this weery
[11:30] land and some sweet
[11:35] day I'll reach that strength.
[11:41] still guided
[11:44] by the unseen
[11:50] hand and has
[11:54] led through shadows
[11:59] tree. And while it
[12:04] leads, I have no fear.
[12:10] I know will
[12:13] lead me to that
[12:18] home where sin no
[12:22] sorrow
[12:24] or can
[12:27] come. I'm trusting
[12:32] to the unseen
[12:36] hand that guides me
[12:41] through this weery
[12:46] land and some sweet
[12:50] [Applause]
[12:51] day I'll reach that
[12:56] strength still Guided
[13:00] by the unseen
[13:05] hand, long to
[13:10] see my Savior's
[13:15] faith and sing the storm.
[13:20] be saved by
[13:24] grave and there
[13:28] upon that golden
[13:33] strand. I'll praise him
[13:38] for his guiding
[13:43] hand. I'm trusting
[13:47] to the unseen
[13:52] hand that guides me
[13:57] through this weery
[14:02] land and some sweet
[14:06] day I'll reach that
[14:11] strength still Guided
[14:16] by the
[14:18] unseen
[14:22] hand.
[14:23] Amen. Hallelujah. Number 230. There is

[14:38] come before him this evening.
[14:40] Hallelujah.
[14:43] There is none like
[14:50] you. No one else can touch my heart like
[14:56] you do.
[15:00] I could search for all
[15:04] eternity
[15:06] below and find there is none like
[15:12] [Music]
[15:17] you. There is none like you.
[15:26] No one else can touch my heart like you
[15:33] do. I could search for all
[15:39] eternity, Lord, and
[15:42] find there is none like
[15:50] you. There is none like you.
[15:56] Lord
[15:59] Jesus, no one else can touch my heart
[16:03] like you

[23:26] precious name of Jesus Christ, we ask
[23:28] these things. Amen.

[25:28] way. While hearts are a

[26:10] Lord shall
[26:13] renew their
[26:16] strength. They shall mount up with
[26:21] wings as eagles.
[26:27] They shall run and not be
[26:31] weery. They shall walk and not

[26:52] to come tonight. I'd like to sing all of
[26:53] course we place you. number
[26:56] 236.
[27:00] [Music]
[27:05] Amen. We place
[27:08] [Music]
[27:11] you in the highest
[27:17] place for you.
[27:23] the great high
[27:28] priest. We place
[27:34] you high
[27:37] above
[27:38] all
[27:42] hell. All hell.
[27:48] And we
[27:50] come to
[27:52] you to
[27:56] worship
[27:57] at your feet.
[28:04] place
[28:05] [Music]
[28:07] you in the highest
[28:13] place. For
[28:18] you are the great high priest.
[28:25] replace
[28:29] you high
[28:32] above
[28:34] all
[28:35] [Music]
[28:37] hell. All
[28:41] hell. And we
[28:44] come to
[28:46] you to
[28:49] worship
[28:51] at your feet.
[28:54] [Music]
[28:56] One more
[28:57] time. We can place
[29:02] you in the highest
[29:08] place. For
[29:13] you are the great high priest.
[29:20] We place
[29:25] you high
[29:27] above
[29:29] all
[29:33] else. All
[29:37] hell and we
[29:40] come to you.
[29:49] [Music]
[29:55] Isn't it wonderful in the day that we
[29:57] live? The Lord has given to
[30:01] us the
[30:04] absolute perfect picture of
[30:10] himself. Off to a good start.
[30:15] an absolute perfect picture of himself.
[30:17] He's presented himself before us. And we
[30:21] just really thank the Lord for that
[30:23] because you know the more that we listen
[30:28] to the prophet speaking in this day the
[30:31] more real it becomes to us uh it is so
[30:40] uh accurate of the day that we're living
[30:44] in. I mean it's just picture perfect of
[30:47] the day. And uh I I just thank the Lord
[30:51] for that because as as we listen and and
[30:54] we you know just partake of the word,
[30:57] we're eating the book. Amen. And as we
[31:00] eat the book, it it's just so real to
[31:02] us. And uh is it difficult? Yes. I I
[31:06] think it is. It can be difficult. The
[31:08] struggles of life, the cares of life,
[31:11] the labors, all of this are difficult.
[31:14] But all it is is God's placing more
[31:16] desire in you and I to eat the book.
[31:19] Amen. Nothing else is mattering. Amen. I
[31:22] want to speak to you this evening as
[31:24] we'll just stand to read the word. I
[31:26] want to speak to you once again on the
[31:28] thought of God's achievement. Uh I guess
[31:30] we would call this part two. But uh the
[31:33] title I would give tonight would be
[31:35] God's created place for you. And uh
[31:38] we'll just go right into Genesis 1 and
[31:41] uh
[31:42] 1-4. and
[31:44] um just really struck me. It's just a
[31:47] very simple thought tonight, but it just
[31:49] struck me how that um depending on how
[31:52] you read the word uh is obviously what
[31:56] you will get out of it, right? When we
[31:58] approach it, uh I just love brother
[32:01] Andrew was speaking about that what we
[32:03] want out, what we give in, put into it,
[32:06] we will get that out. And uh as you read
[32:09] the word sometimes it just you see it in
[32:12] a different light. Amen. So Genesis 1
[32:15] 1-4. In the beginning God created the
[32:18] heaven and the earth. And the earth was
[32:22] without form and void and darkness was
[32:24] upon the face of the deep. And the
[32:26] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[32:28] waters. And God said let there be light.
[32:31] And there was light. And God saw the
[32:33] light and that it was good. And God
[32:36] divided the light from the darkness.
[32:39] Amen. Lord, we thank you for your word
[32:41] that we could come tonight, be partakers
[32:43] of your word. Lord, just bless each and
[32:46] every one. Father, those unable to be
[32:48] here tonight, whatever circumstance, but
[32:51] father bless them and bless the saints
[32:53] that have u made the sacrifice to be
[32:55] here. Lord, just lead us, guide us
[32:57] today. Open the word to us in your
[32:59] precious name. Amen. You may be seated.
[33:02] Now I just you know in this it's not
[33:05] like some super great revelation but as
[33:08] we will look at this my brother and
[33:10] sister I just uh the way it struck me in
[33:12] the beginning God created not the earth
[33:15] and the heaven but the heaven and the
[33:17] earth and there's a place that we're
[33:19] going and what is that called? Heaven.
[33:22] Amen. So God created the heaven in the
[33:25] very beginning and he gave it there and
[33:27] he he come the earth itself without form
[33:31] and void and darkness was on it and God
[33:34] stirred upon it. He he come and he
[33:36] hovered over it just as brother Brandham
[33:39] talks about the Holy Spirit hovering
[33:41] over a son or daughter of God you might
[33:43] say incubating them bringing them forth
[33:46] and how that it is and and he said let
[33:49] there be light and there was light and
[33:51] my brother and sister what has come is
[33:53] the gospel of Jesus Christ to you and I
[33:56] that is the light of the world. Amen. We
[33:58] have a son out here that's well but the
[34:00] light that really matters the most to us
[34:03] is the light of the gospel. He's brought
[34:05] that light to us. Amen. And when it come
[34:08] and he spoke that light into our life,
[34:11] we're not looking at the world out here
[34:13] and its creation tonight. We are looking
[34:16] uh uh to to just what God has done for
[34:19] us. Just listening to the prophet uh a
[34:21] couple days ago and he makes a statement
[34:24] that I thought was good and he said, "I
[34:27] just I'm going to preach to Christians."
[34:29] Amen. So, we're not we're not worried
[34:31] about the the the uh unsaved out there.
[34:34] We're not worried about, you know,
[34:35] everything else that's going on in the
[34:37] world. We can make a big deal about the
[34:40] current pope and all kinds of wars and
[34:43] rumors of wars, but really what we're
[34:45] looking at is the fact that God said
[34:47] there would be light. And that light has
[34:49] come to you and I. Amen. And when it
[34:52] come, God saw that the light was good.
[34:55] It did exactly what he sent it to do.
[34:59] And he divided the light from the
[35:01] darkness. So we're not here now as
[35:03] Christians stumbling in this world
[35:05] saying I hope I think maybe so my
[35:09] emotions tell me but the light has been
[35:12] separated. Darkness has been pushed to
[35:14] the side and the light has come to you
[35:17] and I. And I say these are fairly simple
[35:20] words but they hold such power for you
[35:22] and I today because as God speaks my
[35:25] brother and sister now just bounce back
[35:27] to creation for just a moment. When God
[35:30] speaks, all the elements were commanded
[35:32] to respond. There wasn't a single
[35:34] element that said, you know, I think
[35:36] I'll withhold myself. There was
[35:38] everything subject to the word. And when
[35:41] God speaks in this hour, my brother and
[35:43] sister, to sons and daughters of God,
[35:45] the word has come, it's come with
[35:47] authority. Every element must obey the
[35:51] word. Amen. Now, Satan would like us to
[35:54] believe that he could defy the Holy
[35:56] Spirit, that he could defy the blood of
[35:58] Jesus Christ. But we know better than
[36:01] that. The word is powerful. Amen. The
[36:04] two-edged sword and the blood of Jesus
[36:07] Christ is so powerful, my brother and
[36:09] sister, as a prophet of God taught us
[36:11] about the ink and the the and the
[36:13] bleach. My brother and sister, the blood
[36:15] of Jesus Christ takes that and it's not
[36:18] just that it disappeared, but it breaks
[36:20] it down to the base element and puts it
[36:23] right back into creation. Amen. The very
[36:26] thing God called it out of, it sends it
[36:29] right back into that. And we know, and I
[36:32] say thank you, Lord, that everything
[36:34] must respond to that voice. We're in a
[36:36] day that we of all people should know
[36:39] the power of the voice. Amen. and it
[36:41] comes and and we see and and I I want to
[36:44] be sufficiently vague, but I'll just say
[36:47] that uh this last Sunday we had a
[36:50] visitor in the back. Uh and uh by God's
[36:53] grace, we we'll hopefully see her again.
[36:56] And you know, this is just an evidence
[36:59] of of how that when God starts a work,
[37:02] he makes a call, all the
[37:05] elements, are you with me? All the
[37:07] elements must respond and do as they're
[37:10] commanded. You can say, "But what about
[37:12] the background? What about history?" Or
[37:14] what about this or what about that? My
[37:16] brother or sister, when the voice
[37:17] speaks, Amen. Every element that there
[37:20] is must respond to that. And by God's
[37:23] grace and his mercy, Amen. There's
[37:26] something Brother Brandham brought it
[37:27] out. You might say very simplistic. And
[37:30] and uh I like that that it's simplistic
[37:33] because when it comes out that way, you
[37:35] don't have to get like a theologian.
[37:37] I've been doing just a little bit of
[37:39] research just uh using the internet just
[37:42] to do and and you just type in some
[37:44] basic things uh and the internet brings
[37:47] its response and then there's all kinds
[37:49] of theologians that weigh in on these
[37:51] topics, you know, uh and what is the
[37:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost? Can women be
[37:57] pastors? Uh can divorced men be pastors?
[38:00] And it's so amazing that you look at
[38:03] this and and uh men that used to be in
[38:06] days gone by, they they stood solid for
[38:09] for their denomination, but they stood
[38:11] solid on these things in the gospel. And
[38:14] I listened to one the other day. If I
[38:15] spoke the name, you would say, "We've
[38:17] heard this name." And sat there and
[38:19] listened to it. And I'll sum it up by
[38:21] someone's comment that they made at the
[38:23] end of that. They said, "That is the
[38:25] best uh job of dodging the truth I've
[38:28] ever seen in my life." Amen. But you see
[38:31] what's happened, my brother and sister.
[38:33] They are fulfilling what they were
[38:36] created for. Amen. It sounds harsh. It
[38:40] sounds very direct, but you can't, as
[38:42] the old man said, you can't be what you
[38:45] ain't. That's right. And so there it is
[38:47] that we'll see that. So we see God's got
[38:50] a created place for us. And so really,
[38:52] what place that we will be placed in
[38:54] defines who we are. Amen. And so you
[38:57] we're not going to find as the song
[38:59] says, we're not going to have a
[39:00] complainers's bench and Achen's not
[39:02] going to be there and the unbelievers
[39:05] not going to be present and the doubters
[39:08] and all of these things. My brother and
[39:10] sister, the destination that God has
[39:12] created or fixed for you and I tells who
[39:16] we are. Amen. Because God makes no
[39:19] mistakes. Amen. And so when we look at
[39:22] this, let me back up for just a little
[39:24] here. We see that everything must
[39:26] respond to that voice no matter what the
[39:29] circumstance surrounding them. We have
[39:32] such beautiful examples in scripture
[39:34] mostly focused about sisters in the Old
[39:37] Testament that we see the woman at the
[39:39] well. There was no uh theological
[39:42] explanation to her because God had
[39:45] created her to receive that word. Amen.
[39:48] She was there as a daughter of God and
[39:51] the word was already has a place or a
[39:55] residence to come to. Amen. And when the
[39:58] word come, there was something in her
[40:00] soul that said, "That's what I'm looking
[40:02] for." Amen. And as it was with Hadtie
[40:05] Wright, uh, as as brother Andrew was
[40:08] preaching, it just touched me. I
[40:10] thought, you know, just as it was with
[40:12] Hadty Wright, all through scripture,
[40:14] we've had the Hattie rights. Amen. Maybe
[40:16] not the exact word, but it's there.
[40:18] Woman at the well. She could have very
[40:20] well said that's nothing but the truth.
[40:23] Amen. And use those very words. And and
[40:25] we see Rahab. I'm I've always been uh
[40:28] just, you might say, captivated by Rahab
[40:32] because here she is. Now, there are some
[40:34] I've come across some some studies where
[40:37] they say, "Oh, no. Rahab was not." And
[40:40] when we were in Israel, our guide was
[40:42] saying, "No, no, they've misunderstood.
[40:44] Rahab was not a harlot. My brother and
[40:48] sister, the word of God is the word of
[40:50] God. And if the word of God says she was
[40:52] a harlot, then we'll stand on the fact
[40:55] that she was a harlot. But God had
[40:57] created in Raab, amen, that desire and
[41:02] that need for the word. And he already
[41:05] created, you might say, the space for
[41:07] the word to come down into her. We call
[41:10] it the seed, but just bear with me when
[41:12] I use this example. The space was
[41:14] already there for the word to come and
[41:17] land in her. And a promised place for
[41:20] her to go to was already created for
[41:24] her. Amen. She wasn't there battling her
[41:27] way to become who God called her to be.
[41:30] She was what God called her to be and
[41:32] that was already prepared. And that
[41:34] applies to you and I today. And so
[41:37] everything must respond to that voice.
[41:39] Now David writes in the Psalms. It's
[41:41] it's very good. Amen. It gives such a
[41:44] clear picture. Psalm 104. Now, it's a
[41:47] very lengthy reading, so we're just
[41:49] going to kind of go through it. Uh,
[41:51] verses
[41:52] 1-35, but I I just want to take out of
[41:55] this that there was, my brother and
[41:57] sister, an example right here as David
[42:00] is speaking. It's talking about God's
[42:02] achievement. Amen. He's there, that he
[42:05] is a blesser of the soul. Amen. He's
[42:08] very great. He's clothed with honor and
[42:11] majesty who covers himself with light as
[42:14] with a garment. So this very light that
[42:17] God created called out in the beginning
[42:20] now comes and covers as a garment. Oh,
[42:23] praise God. We're not just hearing the
[42:25] truth. We're not just hearing the
[42:27] message preached and saying, "Oh, we're
[42:29] walking in the light. The light has
[42:31] become our covering." It is who we are.
[42:34] Amen. and as it is as with a garment
[42:37] which stretches the heavens like a
[42:38] curtain. So when we really, my brother
[42:41] and sister, have the gospel, the Lord
[42:44] Jesus Christ, we have that relationship.
[42:46] There's many ways we can express it, but
[42:48] when we have that literally verse two is
[42:53] us. That's right. It is who we are. And
[42:57] who layeth the beams of his chambers in
[42:59] the waters maketh the clouds his
[43:01] chariot. Who walk upon the wings of the
[43:02] wind. who maketh his angels spirits and
[43:05] his ministers of flaming fire. Who laid
[43:08] the foundations of the earth that it
[43:10] should not be removed forever. Thou
[43:12] coverest it with the deep as with a
[43:14] garment. The waters stood above the
[43:16] mountains at thy rebuke. Amen. The voice
[43:20] when it spoke the waters, my brother,
[43:22] which covered everything, the waters had
[43:25] to respond. Amen. And there we look at
[43:27] that. At the voice of thy thunder, they
[43:30] hasted away. And I think you catch this.
[43:32] We we won't spend the time to go through
[43:34] every verse, but my brother and sister,
[43:36] it's right here. He puts the springs and
[43:39] the and the valleys and the water comes
[43:42] and it it comes to supply to quench the
[43:45] thirst. And it's here that the rivers of
[43:47] living water are coming down amongst the
[43:50] bride of Christ in this day to quench
[43:53] her thirst. And if there ever was a
[43:55] time, my brother and sister, that
[43:57] there's a thirst becoming evident in the
[43:59] people. Now, we weren't there in in in
[44:02] the early times, the other ages, but my
[44:05] brother and sister, we're looking at a
[44:07] time right now that the thirst, people
[44:09] desiring when the prophet of God said
[44:12] that people would try to satisfy that
[44:14] thirst with almost anything out here.
[44:17] We're seeing that today. And yet, to a
[44:20] son or daughter of God, that world out
[44:23] there cannot satisfy that thirst. Amen.
[44:26] Satan would like to drive them off the
[44:28] edge, but God is calling them back into
[44:31] his flock into his people. And so
[44:35] without uh I would give it to you as
[44:37] homework if you wouldn't mind just to
[44:40] read all the way through 104. Uh it it
[44:43] just so beautiful of how that uh God
[44:47] does this. And we'll see uh verse 16,
[44:49] the trees of the Lord are full of sap,
[44:51] the cedars of Lebanon which is planted.
[44:54] And that when I read that, it reminds me
[44:56] as it is, who told the sap to go to the
[45:00] roots? Who told the sap to come and
[45:03] produce the leaves, bring life back into
[45:06] the tree in the springtime? Who told to
[45:09] do that? This is the power and the
[45:12] majesty of the creation of our God.
[45:15] Amen. And when he can make it, now I
[45:17] know this is not a very good uh uh
[45:19] comparison in one sense, but if God can
[45:22] tell nature how to control itself, how
[45:26] to respond, how could we Amen. Now,
[45:29] we'll touch on this, so don't
[45:30] misunderstand my words at the moment.
[45:33] But how can we people that God created
[45:35] for this day? Amen. How can we even
[45:38] doubt what God has in store and the
[45:41] planning of our life? how perfect
[45:43] everything in our life is because he has
[45:46] orchestrated it. He's the one that's put
[45:48] it in motion. He's the one that said
[45:50] this is what will happen and this is
[45:53] where it will go and this is their final
[45:55] destination. Amen. Now, if we have a
[45:58] final destination, now this is something
[46:00] a little off the side. Excuse me. But
[46:03] you know, one of the things that that
[46:04] just uh frustrates me, if that would
[46:06] even be a fair word to use, is people
[46:09] trying to get you to quit the message.
[46:11] Amen. But they don't have anywhere to
[46:13] send you to. Right? They want to call
[46:16] you out, but they have nowhere. They
[46:18] want to send you back to a wilderness.
[46:20] Amen. They want to send you back to the
[46:22] tables full of vomit. Amen. They want to
[46:24] send you back to all the nonsense that
[46:27] God delivered once. And so you recognize
[46:30] what those spirits are. Amen. Those are
[46:33] not just misguided men. That is a
[46:36] demonic spirit that is trying to
[46:38] separate you from the presence of God.
[46:41] And so, yeah, we could get sidetracked
[46:43] there, but we won't. Amen. Amen. You
[46:47] know, verse
[46:48] 34, he says, "My meditation of him shall
[46:52] be sweet. I will be glad in the Lord."
[46:54] And that should be something that we
[46:56] today meditate on him. And you know uh
[47:00] you can be a sour puss and uh when you
[47:02] start thinking about the things of God
[47:04] and thinking about the presence of God
[47:06] and you start talking about the presence
[47:08] of God and he comes draws nigh unto us
[47:12] and it brings uh this meditation becomes
[47:15] very sweet. The presence of God when we
[47:18] talk to him just such a calming effect
[47:20] my brother and sister just such a
[47:22] powerful effect that comes and talk
[47:25] about being glad. You get sit down and
[47:27] you talk about the word of God. You talk
[47:29] about the things of God and you'll find
[47:31] yourself getting up and walking away
[47:33] happy. Amen. What a change. Amen. Now,
[47:38] I'd like to go just kind of bouncing my
[47:40] way through this into the uh resume of
[47:43] the ages. Now, we'll look at this real
[47:46] quick here. Remember, while Jesus was
[47:49] upon the earth, so was Judas. Amen.
[47:52] So that day wasn't free of spirits. That
[47:56] day wasn't free of
[47:58] influence. Amen. Judas was present and
[48:02] he had an influence. I've often wondered
[48:04] maybe we have a maybe we have an answer
[48:06] for that and I've just missed it. But
[48:08] you know when Judas fell, I wonder if he
[48:11] took some of his followers with him.
[48:18] I I would personally think that he did.
[48:21] people would have been looking maybe to
[48:23] Judas more than really to Jesus.
[48:27] Amen. Just as it is. And the reason I
[48:30] feel that way is we live in this age.
[48:31] And that's the way the spirit works.
[48:34] People don't they don't come often.
[48:36] People come. Brother Brandham said it.
[48:38] He said, "I'm afraid that we're getting
[48:40] people to church and not to Christ."
[48:42] Amen. So, you know, Judas, I think,
[48:45] would have had a following. And uh each
[48:48] came with a different spirit. And on
[48:50] upon death, each went to his own place.
[48:53] Now hold that as a little significant
[48:56] factor. The spirit of Christ later came
[48:58] back upon the true church and the spirit
[49:01] of Judas came back upon the false
[49:04] church. Now I want you to just reach out
[49:06] and grab this for a second. The fact
[49:09] that each one as it were at that stage
[49:12] had a destination. They had a place and
[49:15] a purpose. And so as Judas comes back
[49:18] upon the false church, it is right there
[49:20] in Revelation 6:2 to8. And I saw and
[49:23] behold a white horse, and he that sat on
[49:26] him had a bow, and a crown was given
[49:28] unto him, and he went forth conquering
[49:30] and to conquer. And when he had opened
[49:33] the second seal, now let's let me stop.
[49:36] I got a note here, and I'm skipping
[49:38] right over my own note. Let's look at
[49:41] this. Conquering and to conquer.
[49:45] Hold that in your thought. We'll come
[49:47] and bounce off of that in just a minute.
[49:50] And when he had opened the second seal,
[49:51] I heard the second beast say, "Come and
[49:53] see." And there went out another horse
[49:56] that was red, and power was given to him
[49:58] that set to take peace from the earth,
[50:00] that they should kill one another. And
[50:03] there was given unto him a great sword.
[50:06] And when he had opened the third seal, I
[50:09] heard the third beast come uh third
[50:12] beast say, "Come and see." And I beheld,
[50:15] and lo, a black horse, and he that sat
[50:17] on him had a pair of balances in his
[50:19] hand. And I heard a voice in the midst
[50:22] of the four beasts, say, A measure of
[50:24] wheat for a penny, three measures of
[50:26] barley for a penny, and see that that
[50:28] thou hurt not the oil and the wine. And
[50:31] when he had opened the fourth seal, I
[50:34] heard a voice of a fourth beast say,
[50:36] Come and see. And I looked, and behold,
[50:39] a pale horse, and his name that sat on
[50:42] him was death, and hell followed with
[50:45] him. And the power was given him over
[50:48] the fourth part of the earth to kill
[50:50] with the sword, and with hunger, and
[50:53] with death, and with the beasts of the
[50:55] earth. See how that Judas spirit came
[50:58] back as a rider on a white horse.
[51:03] My without the word coming, the gospel
[51:06] coming to you and I and preparing the
[51:09] ground, my brother and sister, we would
[51:11] read this with a with a theological
[51:14] mind, with an educated mind, and we
[51:17] would say a white horse is pure. And we
[51:19] would be giving the devil the opening
[51:22] just as the world will because they
[51:25] believe that he's coming as their savior
[51:28] and he is coming as their curse. Amen.
[51:32] So you see how this is and he said it
[51:35] was white so close to the real just as
[51:39] Judas was so close to Jesus. A crown was
[51:42] given to him white horse rider. How that
[51:45] was spirit was now in the leader of the
[51:48] nicicoatan system and he was triple
[51:51] crowned pope who set as god in his
[51:54] temple calling himself the vicer of
[51:57] Christ. Now when you take this my
[52:00] brother and sister maybe I'll just read
[52:01] the next line then we'll do. If the
[52:03] victor of Christ means instead of Christ
[52:06] or in place of or on behalf of God then
[52:10] the pope was calling himself the Holy
[52:13] Ghost or disposing the Holy Ghost acting
[52:17] for him. Now when we look at prophecy
[52:19] that has come to pass my brother and
[52:21] sister let's not get too carried away of
[52:25] the interpretation of it. It is another
[52:27] factor, another prophecy that has come.
[52:30] It's another piece you might say of this
[52:33] spiritual puzzle, right? It is not the
[52:35] endgame of everything. It is God
[52:38] preparing us, giving us the warning that
[52:41] we are getting very, very close to the
[52:44] end. Amen. Now as 3 minutes till
[52:46] midnight uh all those years ago we are
[52:50] right there watching the second hand
[52:53] ticking itself right down to strike the
[52:56] note. Amen. Now we've been in Europe,
[52:59] you know, been privileged to be there
[53:01] and in some of those cities when the
[53:03] clock tower my everybody knows when it
[53:07] hits the time. Amen. It's not a secret
[53:10] little hidding of time. But yet now the
[53:13] rapture is going to be a secret catching
[53:15] away. But every evidence of it, my
[53:19] brother and sister, is like a great gong
[53:21] going off. It is a great thing because
[53:24] it is the deliverance of the bride and
[53:26] it is the opening of judgment to the
[53:30] world. Amen. To those that unbelie or
[53:33] unbelievers. Amen. Then the pope was
[53:36] calling himself the Holy Ghost or
[53:38] disposing the Holy Ghost acting for him.
[53:41] That was the Judas spirit in him doing
[53:43] that. See how he conquered going forth
[53:47] conquering and to
[53:49] conquer. Christ did not do that. The
[53:53] only ones that came to him were already
[53:56] predestinated by the father. Amen. In
[54:00] other words, the creation. Now, just let
[54:03] me just word it this way. Please don't
[54:05] judge me by the exact sequence of it.
[54:08] But my brother and sister, God already
[54:10] before the foundation of the world
[54:12] created a place for us to go. Amen. And
[54:16] he also prepared us to go there. Amen.
[54:20] So, heaven was made for us. Amen. But
[54:23] we're not, as we'll deal with this in
[54:24] another quote here in a minute, my
[54:26] brother and sister, we were created to
[54:29] occupy that space right there. And God
[54:32] created heaven, amen, for us to be
[54:34] there. Isn't that a beautiful coming
[54:36] together? Just as it is, there is no
[54:38] marriage if there is not a man and a
[54:40] woman. Amen. There is no marriage if
[54:43] there's no commitment. There's no
[54:45] marriage, my brother and sister, if it
[54:47] doesn't produce fruit. Amen. Now, I'm
[54:49] not talking about children. And I'm
[54:51] talking about the relationship of this.
[54:53] Uh if you have cold formal relationship,
[54:56] it's not a marriage in spite of a piece
[54:58] of paper. A cold formal relationship
[55:02] does not produce what God intended. So
[55:05] therefore, it ultimately is a failure.
[55:07] But when we come in the right
[55:09] atmosphere, the right spirit and and put
[55:11] the right things in the right place, it
[55:13] produces a life that is beautiful. It is
[55:16] there. The prophet of God taking this in
[55:19] so many words. I know I heard it
[55:21] recently. I couldn't find it, but his
[55:23] there my brother and sister, you see,
[55:25] God was God's desire was for a bride.
[55:29] And so he brought about and and if I
[55:32] don't have the words quite exactly right
[55:33] this evening, forgive me. But God found
[55:37] created a bride for himself. Amen. He
[55:41] didn't just randomly go out and and just
[55:44] go, I hope this one will be my bride. I
[55:46] hope this one will be my bride. But he
[55:48] knew us from before the foundation of
[55:51] the world and said, "This is my bride."
[55:54] That ought to make us happy. We have
[55:56] purpose here. We have a place here. We
[55:58] have a place we can stand and know that
[56:00] we are in God's will, in God's favor. We
[56:04] are in his mind. Amen. And so that just
[56:07] makes my heart so happy. Amen. Okay, let
[56:11] me get back to where I was
[56:13] at. Come to him. were already
[56:15] predestinated by the father. And so on
[56:19] and on went that spirit. And one day it
[56:22] will become truly incarnate in a man who
[56:24] will head up the world council of
[56:26] churches just as we've been saying. And
[56:28] by his gold remember Judas held the bag.
[56:33] He will control the whole world. Let me
[56:37] tell you, maybe you don't pay attention.
[56:39] I just on a superficial level pay
[56:41] attention to the economics of the world
[56:43] because they're a time piece. They're
[56:45] also a sign and they're talking about
[56:47] the bond market is right on a verge of
[56:51] having a breakdown. Now, the prophet
[56:54] showed us very clearly that the Jews
[56:56] hold the paper and Rome holds the gold,
[57:00] my brother and sister. And I'm telling
[57:01] you, the paper is not worth anything if
[57:05] there isn't something to back it up.
[57:08] Amen. And so we're headed right to the
[57:10] very words, not just a pope from
[57:12] America, my brother and sister. We're
[57:15] headed right to the fulfillment of these
[57:17] things. And we can look at that and get
[57:19] nervous and we can get anxious. Or we
[57:22] can look at this and say that cannot
[57:24] come to fulfillment till the words
[57:26] concerning the bride come to
[57:28] fulfillment. And when the words come to
[57:31] fulfillment concerning the bride, she's
[57:33] not even here. When those things take
[57:36] place, will you feel the heat, the
[57:38] friction, everything? Yes, you'll no
[57:40] doubt feel the heat and the friction.
[57:42] Amen. But when it collapses, when it
[57:44] goes, Brother Brandham brings us a very
[57:46] scriptural example that we're there and
[57:49] Joseph's wife was in the house. Amen. I
[57:52] say thank you, Lord, that we have a
[57:53] house to go to. Amen. Amen. We're not in
[57:57] the wilderness. We're not out under a
[57:59] bush somewhere. The word shows us
[58:01] clearly we're in his house. Amen.
[58:06] Hallelujah. And he'll control the whole
[58:08] world. And that antichrist system will
[58:10] own everything and try to control
[58:13] everybody. But Jesus will come back and
[58:16] destroy them all when the brightness of
[58:18] his coming and their end will be the
[58:20] lake of fire. But what about the true
[58:22] seed? Amen. Look, we have four long
[58:25] paragraphs here, but we get right down
[58:27] in the summation of this. What about the
[58:30] true seed? It will happen just as we
[58:34] have said. The people of
[58:36] God are being Amen. made ready. Yes,
[58:40] sir. Now, when you look through this and
[58:43] study those words right there, they are
[58:46] being formed.
[58:49] Praise God. You're that block of granite
[58:52] that
[58:53] Michelangelo started cutting away. and
[58:56] we said, "Well, we're the son or or the
[58:59] daughter of, you know, our our parents,
[59:02] grandparents. We're But you see, God's
[59:04] chipping all of that away. We're no
[59:06] longer sit here and go, I'm hoping I I'm
[59:09] the bride of Christ." We have a
[59:11] confidence that comes from the word that
[59:13] is telling us, "You are my wife." Amen.
[59:18] Oh, what a relationship, my brother and
[59:20] sister. How would it be for a wife to to
[59:23] get up every day with a question mark?
[59:25] Am I really Am I really his wife? Amen.
[59:28] Sister Jerry and I used to kind of joke
[59:30] about it because the preacher forgot to
[59:32] mail in our marriage license for the
[59:34] longest time. And and uh you know, they
[59:37] used to bug us about it a little bit
[59:39] like we're not sure they accepted it, so
[59:41] we don't know if you're married or not.
[59:43] But I'll tell you, my brother and
[59:45] sister, not once through the years have
[59:47] they come along and said that she is not
[59:49] my wife. Amen. So, it's there that the
[59:52] confidence to know who we are. But it's
[59:56] also on God's part that he said, "I'm
[59:58] going to create this and carve this out
[1:00:01] and form this to make myself a wife."
[1:00:05] Amen. A bride. Amen. How beautiful to
[1:00:09] look what the message is. It's not just
[1:00:11] about the doctrines of of the seals and
[1:00:14] the thunders and the vials and and all
[1:00:16] of these things. It's not just about
[1:00:18] those things like that, my brother and
[1:00:20] sister, but it's about a bride who
[1:00:22] realizes that she has been handcrafted
[1:00:26] by the Holy Ghost to be the wife of
[1:00:30] Jesus Christ. Handcrafted by the word in
[1:00:33] this hour. Not a randomness, not a not
[1:00:36] a, you know, throw a little here and
[1:00:38] throw a little there. You know, Brother
[1:00:40] Brandham talks about, you know, the
[1:00:41] firemen, uh, the little town firemen,
[1:00:44] you know, and they're out there. Uh,
[1:00:46] squirt a little here. Oh, squirt a
[1:00:48] little there, squirt a little over here.
[1:00:50] Then he talks about how when the firemen
[1:00:52] from the big city come, the captain
[1:00:54] stood out there and said, "This is that.
[1:00:56] Do this. Do that." And pretty soon the
[1:00:59] fire is out. Holy Ghost didn't come to
[1:01:01] church to talk about social programs and
[1:01:04] come about welfare programs and talk
[1:01:06] about this kind of program and that kind
[1:01:08] of program and when we're going to have
[1:01:10] sport night and what we're going to do
[1:01:12] to supply the money for the equipment
[1:01:14] for sport night and oh, aren't we
[1:01:16] gracious? Aren't we blessed? God's doing
[1:01:18] all this. No, my brother and sister, he
[1:01:20] come as the chief captain and said, "You
[1:01:24] need to be born again. You need to have
[1:01:26] an experience that is real. So, you need
[1:01:29] to get in the word. If you don't eat
[1:01:32] natural food, you starve to death. Amen.
[1:01:35] Not long ago, there was a woman that for
[1:01:37] years has been uh eating uh alalfa
[1:01:40] sprouts and all this kind of stuff. You
[1:01:42] may know the story a little bit. And and
[1:01:45] she she just come and uh she passed away
[1:01:48] here
[1:01:49] recently. And uh they did some analysis.
[1:01:53] I don't know, maybe an autopsy, whatever
[1:01:54] it would be. And uh she literally
[1:01:56] starved to death. a willful because she
[1:01:59] was afraid to eat
[1:02:02] anything. This is not good for me. This
[1:02:04] is not good for me. This is not good for
[1:02:06] me. You know, and there was somebody, it
[1:02:08] sounded like they were medical. They
[1:02:10] said, you know what, she'd have lived
[1:02:11] longer if she just ate candy bars than
[1:02:13] she did for what she's eating. Amen. But
[1:02:16] yet, we're not called just to live on
[1:02:18] the sweets. We're called to eat the real
[1:02:21] meat of the gospel. Amen. To really dig
[1:02:25] in. And the meat of the gospel has to be
[1:02:28] revealed to us. It is not something that
[1:02:30] we can come and say, "I'm just going to
[1:02:32] study my way into a rapture." It's a
[1:02:34] revelation. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Now,
[1:02:38] help me. Where was I? Got all excited
[1:02:41] and sidetracked myself.
[1:02:48] The only ones, yes, Christ did not do
[1:02:50] that. The only ones that came to him
[1:02:52] were already predestinated by the
[1:02:54] father. And so on and on with the spirit
[1:02:57] and one day will become truly incarnate
[1:02:59] in a man who will head up the world
[1:03:01] council of churches just as we have been
[1:03:03] saying his goal. Remember Judas held the
[1:03:05] bag. He will control the whole world.
[1:03:08] That antichrist system will own
[1:03:09] everything and try to control everybody.
[1:03:11] We're headed there saints. Amen. They're
[1:03:13] passing religious laws all over the
[1:03:16] world about how, when, where, and
[1:03:19] whether you know what you can do. Amen.
[1:03:22] But Jesus will come back and destroy
[1:03:24] them with the brightness of his coming.
[1:03:26] What about the true seed? It'll come
[1:03:29] just as we have said. The people of God
[1:03:31] are being made ready by the word of
[1:03:33] truth. Not just church, but word of
[1:03:39] truth from a messenger to this age. in
[1:03:42] her will be the fullness of Pentecost.
[1:03:45] For the spirit will bring the people
[1:03:47] right back to where they were at the
[1:03:49] beginning. That is thus saith the Lord.
[1:03:53] Now, let's be just uh almost contrarians
[1:03:56] for just a moment if you don't mind. My
[1:03:58] brother and sister, we're going to be,
[1:04:00] you know, brother Brandham's the one
[1:04:01] that preached the trial. So, I feel like
[1:04:03] we can we can look at this and shine the
[1:04:05] spotlight on this. Can we find one thing
[1:04:09] that we could look at and say this is
[1:04:11] not
[1:04:13] happening? Would he be guilty of
[1:04:15] enlarging upon the calling of Elijah in
[1:04:18] this day? Would he be guilty of
[1:04:21] exaggeration? Would he be guilty of
[1:04:25] misrepresentation? I don't believe we
[1:04:27] can find one drop of evidence to support
[1:04:30] that. Anyone can fabricate evidence.
[1:04:34] Anyone can say, "I did what they said. I
[1:04:37] did what he did. I listened. I did all
[1:04:39] that. Nothing happened." But you see,
[1:04:41] when you go in with a negative, you're
[1:04:44] going to come out with a negative. Amen.
[1:04:47] You can't put the jumper cables on the
[1:04:49] wrong terminal and expect it to charge
[1:04:52] it when you're putting power in the
[1:04:54] ground. Amen. And the ground will never
[1:04:58] you uh uh release the power to to start
[1:05:02] your engine unless something is hooked
[1:05:04] up correctly. Amen. So it's there if we
[1:05:07] come with a negative attitude. Amen. You
[1:05:11] know the man come to brother Brandham
[1:05:13] says, you know, brother Brandham, you
[1:05:14] said I was healed. And brother Brandham
[1:05:16] turns around. He doesn't say, "Oh, I'm
[1:05:18] so sorry. I'm so sorry. Um I I don't
[1:05:20] know. Maybe my faith or this wasn't."
[1:05:23] No. What? Brother Brandham turn around.
[1:05:25] See, people don't like this direct
[1:05:26] approach. They want to find someone to
[1:05:29] blame it on. They don't want to have to
[1:05:30] stand and look in a spiritual mirror.
[1:05:32] Brother Brandham said, he says, "Brother
[1:05:34] Brandon, you said I was healed." Brother
[1:05:35] Brandham turns right to him and says,
[1:05:37] "And you said you believed." That's
[1:05:39] right.
[1:05:41] They see it puts it right back where it
[1:05:42] really should be. Now, some people don't
[1:05:44] like that. They want to find a reason
[1:05:46] why they couldn't hold on to the word.
[1:05:49] They want to find a reason that that
[1:05:50] that this didn't take place. And and so,
[1:05:53] they're looking at this. But I'm telling
[1:05:55] you my brother and sister, God's
[1:05:56] achievement in this hour is he has a
[1:06:00] people. There is a people sitting right
[1:06:02] here tonight, maybe even listening here
[1:06:04] tonight. That is God's achievement
[1:06:07] because in his creation of the word of
[1:06:11] our bride coming forth of what he said
[1:06:13] we would be. And when he spoke the word,
[1:06:16] the elements come together and created
[1:06:18] you. Amen. Even though you didn't come
[1:06:20] to a natural birth yet, you still was
[1:06:23] right there. And not one attribute of
[1:06:26] mother or father would have stopped you
[1:06:28] from fulfilling the word of God for the
[1:06:30] day. Amen. Now let's look look how
[1:06:34] important it is to recognize and claim
[1:06:37] our
[1:06:38] position. Let's talk about Mary for a
[1:06:40] moment.
[1:06:44] Mary's
[1:06:47] response
[1:06:50] translated that's nothing but the truth
[1:06:56] as the words come out of her mouth and
[1:06:58] were recorded be it unto me according to
[1:07:02] thy word see what happened my brother
[1:07:05] and
[1:07:06] sister God's choosing of Mary formed her
[1:07:11] into a young
[1:07:13] lady maybe, you know, they they've some
[1:07:15] religions have turned her into almost
[1:07:17] angelic being, but remember the word
[1:07:20] showed it's right there plain in the
[1:07:22] scripture and brother Brown clarifies
[1:07:24] it. She had to have the Holy Ghost. She
[1:07:26] had to have a new birth. Amen. She
[1:07:28] didn't get a freebie just because she
[1:07:30] was the incubator for Jesus Christ. She
[1:07:34] had to receive the word. But look at
[1:07:36] this. God not only at from her birth,
[1:07:39] well before her birth, but coming up,
[1:07:42] Mary was being formed to be that young
[1:07:44] woman that would stand there confronted
[1:07:47] as it were by an angel. And instead of
[1:07:50] screaming and running away, this is
[1:07:52] terrifying. She holds a conversation and
[1:07:55] she's able by faith from her soul to be
[1:07:59] able to say, "Be it unto me according to
[1:08:02] thy word." Amen. my brother and sister,
[1:08:05] redemption. Now, it couldn't stop the
[1:08:06] plan of God. But if Mary had said, "No
[1:08:09] way. I didn't sign up for this." Amen.
[1:08:11] See how it would have disrupted the plan
[1:08:13] of God. But God's planning is so
[1:08:16] perfect. He had already formed in Mary
[1:08:19] the desire to say, "Be it unto me." And
[1:08:23] I say today, that same supernatural
[1:08:26] forming that took place in Mary has
[1:08:28] already taken place in you and I. We are
[1:08:31] sitting here today of the word of the
[1:08:34] hour, the challenge of our day to be
[1:08:36] able to say be it unto me. When the
[1:08:39] prophet of God said this bride will have
[1:08:42] to be perfect, then we are here saying I
[1:08:45] got so many flaws. I can't be perfect. I
[1:08:48] can't do this. I can't overcome. But God
[1:08:51] has already formed in us an ability to
[1:08:53] say, "Be it unto me, Lord. Let it come
[1:08:57] to pass in my life. Whatever your word
[1:09:00] has required of me, let it come to pass
[1:09:03] in my life. Hallelujah. And you see what
[1:09:07] it come down to. Now, this is a greater
[1:09:09] picture. So, please don't get too
[1:09:11] critical of looking at it because that
[1:09:14] it's too complex for Paul's brain. I
[1:09:16] just have to believe it. Amen. I have to
[1:09:19] just take a hold of it. But you see,
[1:09:21] Amen. What Mary did was accepted God's
[1:09:25] choice for her. Amen.
[1:09:28] And really to make it simple today, this
[1:09:31] is not all about I'm predestinated. I'm
[1:09:34] this. I'm that. That I understand. I
[1:09:38] just accept God's choice. Yeah. Amen.
[1:09:40] Lord, be it unto me. I accept what
[1:09:43] you've called me to be.
[1:09:46] My brother and sister, you see, our God
[1:09:49] is so
[1:09:50] great that if there had been a chance
[1:09:52] that Mary said, "I'm sorry. I can't
[1:09:54] fulfill that." It wouldn't have stopped
[1:09:57] the plan of
[1:09:59] redemption. God already had plan. But
[1:10:01] you see, God's plans are perfect. In
[1:10:03] other words, I I don't want to use any
[1:10:05] of you examples. I'll use myself. If it
[1:10:07] come to the point I said, you know, I
[1:10:09] just can't serve you, Lord. I I just
[1:10:11] can't do this. I I I I just I can't do
[1:10:14] this. You see, God would already know
[1:10:16] that. Y
[1:10:19] remember the little story people say,
[1:10:21] "Well, we don't know for certain." But
[1:10:23] remember brother Brown talking about the
[1:10:25] man that on the
[1:10:27] garage and uh I think he was a minister
[1:10:31] also in the car for no known reason the
[1:10:35] lift collapses and kills him. Brother
[1:10:39] Brandham lays this out that was God's
[1:10:42] way of keeping him from
[1:10:45] transgressing. Took his
[1:10:48] life. See God's plan is perfect. He
[1:10:51] wasn't going to let that soul become a
[1:10:53] Judas. That's right. So Judas had to be
[1:10:57] Judas. Amen. And Judas could not have
[1:11:00] been Christ. Amen. Amen. And when we see
[1:11:04] what God will do, he will preserve his
[1:11:07] plan perfectly. And we're here amongst
[1:11:10] the living today, my brother and
[1:11:12] sisters. So God's plan is preserved
[1:11:14] perfect here today in spite of this
[1:11:18] flesh.
[1:11:19] In spite of, not because of, in spite
[1:11:23] of. Amen. So Mary accepts this. And it
[1:11:26] was there she says, "I not about the
[1:11:29] baby." Do you understand that? Mary's
[1:11:32] not accepting, "Oh, I'm going to have a
[1:11:34] baby without having known a man." She's
[1:11:36] not accepting that. She's accepting
[1:11:38] God's
[1:11:40] plan.
[1:11:41] Having baby is part of the plan, but
[1:11:46] redemption coming to her and her
[1:11:49] claiming her position even so much that
[1:11:52] Jesus points the disciples and tells
[1:11:55] them there's your mother. That's right.
[1:11:58] That's how that's how far when she
[1:12:01] accepted that all those years before.
[1:12:02] That's how far it brought her into the
[1:12:04] plan of God that God would point to her
[1:12:07] and say, "Mother, son, son, mother."
[1:12:10] There it
[1:12:13] is. Mary been prepared for this. Now,
[1:12:16] look at this. She was predestinated.
[1:12:19] Amen. And look at this bride.
[1:12:23] She's chosen. She's predestinated. She's
[1:12:27] called. She is. And you see what it is
[1:12:31] is the whole time because every one of
[1:12:34] us born in sin and shaped in
[1:12:36] iniquity. The whole time God has formed
[1:12:39] in us an ability to say yes Lord. Yes
[1:12:44] Lord. Be it unto me Lord. My brother and
[1:12:48] sister, in a world full of sin and
[1:12:50] influence like this world is, that is a
[1:12:55] supernatural event that takes place
[1:12:58] daily. That's right. Daily. That's
[1:13:01] right. Amen. Now the 23rd psalm you see
[1:13:05] looking at things from this angle that I
[1:13:07] have been 23rd psalm you know is is
[1:13:11] basically just this uh reaffirming uh of
[1:13:15] kind of what it kind of has helped mold
[1:13:18] my thought. You see when you stand there
[1:13:21] and you make a declaration not I think
[1:13:24] the Lord is my shepherd. No, it is there
[1:13:28] something that has been spoken with
[1:13:29] confidence uh confl confidence and
[1:13:33] absolute. The Lord is my shepherd. Amen.
[1:13:38] I almost wish we could just take the the
[1:13:41] uh words and make the my you know five
[1:13:46] times bigger you know as an
[1:13:49] emphasis. I shall not want. Y he maketh
[1:13:53] me to lie down in green pastures. Now my
[1:13:56] brother and sister, we would look at
[1:13:58] that and say maketh me is not an image
[1:14:01] of God dragging us along by a
[1:14:04] collar. You know, having having a a
[1:14:07] noose around our neck pulling us, he
[1:14:09] maketh me to do this or or you know, as
[1:14:11] we stand there, he he kicks a knee out
[1:14:14] from under you so you collapse down. No,
[1:14:17] he's not making it. All took place in
[1:14:19] the heart. Every bit of this was already
[1:14:22] formed into the heart. And he leadeth me
[1:14:25] beside the still waters. That means
[1:14:26] Christ's with you. Amen. He's not
[1:14:29] somewhere else asking you to go it
[1:14:31] alone. And he restoreth my soul. And
[1:14:33] certainly I tell you in the world we
[1:14:35] live in today in the pressures. I need a
[1:14:37] restoration every single day. And I
[1:14:39] believe you would say amen with me.
[1:14:41] Amen. And he leads me in the paths of
[1:14:43] righteousness for his name's sake. and
[1:14:45] and how beautiful these things are
[1:14:47] because that puts Christ with us as a
[1:14:51] constant companion all the time. Amen.
[1:14:54] All the time. And yay for I walk through
[1:14:58] the valley of the shadow of death. You
[1:14:59] know, it was many years ago, so I don't
[1:15:01] mean to make it sound like it was
[1:15:03] yesterday or something, but you know, I
[1:15:05] remember very vividly the first time
[1:15:07] that that scripture really, really spoke
[1:15:10] to me, really just reached out and
[1:15:12] grabbed me. And I walked through the
[1:15:13] valley of the shadow of death. always
[1:15:15] like why would God take us down into
[1:15:17] such a chaotic uh vicious uh whatever
[1:15:21] but it's just a shadow and all the
[1:15:23] shadow tells you wherever there is a
[1:15:25] shadow there has to be light present so
[1:15:29] he's walking with us but yet he's
[1:15:31] present above us amen he's surrounding
[1:15:34] it the shadow well we're living in the
[1:15:36] shadow of death right now my brother and
[1:15:38] sister we're living in a world we we
[1:15:40] have a you know government that is
[1:15:42] saying you know this could be World War
[1:15:44] three and uh certainly we know by
[1:15:46] prophecy it'll be coming to that. So
[1:15:48] there's that shadow over there. But
[1:15:50] we're the bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:15:52] we're not called to have fear. We're not
[1:15:54] called to fear evil. Amen. And so thou
[1:15:58] art with me. Thy rod, thy staff, they
[1:16:00] comfort me. Thou preparest a table
[1:16:02] before me in the presence of my enemies,
[1:16:05] which that was fulfilled today, in case
[1:16:07] you don't know. Amen. And yesterday, and
[1:16:09] will be fulfilled once again tomorrow.
[1:16:12] Amen. Thou anointest my head with oil,
[1:16:14] my cup runth over. Now my brother and
[1:16:17] sister, if we are here, and I use if as
[1:16:20] a phrase, if we are here filled with the
[1:16:22] Holy Ghost, Amen. then we are here
[1:16:26] anointed with oil. And if we are here
[1:16:29] living as God's called us to live, our
[1:16:32] cup is going to be running over. Does
[1:16:34] that mean that we won't have challenges
[1:16:36] and we won't in the flesh struggle? Oh,
[1:16:38] my brother and sister, we will. But I
[1:16:40] tell you, he come because he said, "I
[1:16:42] restore your soul." We can stumb each
[1:16:45] day. And in just a moment of time, a a
[1:16:48] reading or hearing uh just change the
[1:16:51] whole atmosphere, the whole world around
[1:16:53] us. Amen. And I I love verse six also.
[1:16:57] And we'll move on. Surely goodness and
[1:16:59] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[1:17:01] life. Prophesy that over your own life.
[1:17:04] Prophesy that over your wife and your
[1:17:06] children, your husband, and your
[1:17:08] families. uh that surely goodness and
[1:17:11] mercy shall follow all the days of my
[1:17:13] life and I will dwell in the house of
[1:17:15] the Lord forever. Now David had a
[1:17:19] glimpse my brother and sister he had a
[1:17:21] glimpse of eternity right there. That
[1:17:24] was not just oh for the length of my
[1:17:26] life but he was saying you know what I
[1:17:28] will dwell in the house of the Lord
[1:17:30] forever and as eternal beings God had to
[1:17:33] create an eternal place for you forever
[1:17:38] otherwise it would
[1:17:41] have an
[1:17:44] extinguish coming to
[1:17:46] halt. I had eternal life
[1:17:50] until you see the world troubles,
[1:17:53] criticizes, makes light
[1:17:55] of come across theologians saying well
[1:17:58] the ministry they were at least
[1:18:00] respectful to brother Brandham is
[1:18:03] incorrect because hell is
[1:18:05] eternal. But look at the simplicity that
[1:18:09] a prophet brought it to us.
[1:18:13] If hell was eternal,
[1:18:16] even in torment, those people would have
[1:18:18] eternal life.
[1:18:24] How simple. Such utter
[1:18:27] simplicity. So simple people can't grasp
[1:18:30] it. That's exactly right. Let us never
[1:18:34] be that complicated. Now let's go on
[1:18:36] into the influence of another. I just
[1:18:39] need to to keep going.
[1:18:42] What kind of a covering do we
[1:18:45] need? We could pause right there and
[1:18:47] really think about it. What kind of
[1:18:48] covering do we need? A religious
[1:18:53] cloak?
[1:18:55] Theology? We could have a lot of
[1:18:59] coverings. They had to be covered. I
[1:19:03] want to say this right now. The blood of
[1:19:04] Jesus Christ is all sufficient. See,
[1:19:08] Christ never died for them saraphans.
[1:19:11] Now, as I always say, and I just want to
[1:19:13] say it again, they're right here. Even
[1:19:16] those on the internet, you can look it
[1:19:18] up. You can find the paragraph. You can
[1:19:20] find this and and get the full context
[1:19:22] of it. See, Christ never died for them
[1:19:25] saraphins. No. No. But they were created
[1:19:28] beings. He never died for angels. He
[1:19:31] died for sinners. Uh-huh. He never died
[1:19:34] for holy people. He died for unholy. And
[1:19:38] as long as you think you're holy, he
[1:19:40] never done you no good. When you realize
[1:19:43] you're nothing, then he died. He died
[1:19:46] for you. See, then you realize you're
[1:19:48] nothing. Then he was the one uh you was
[1:19:52] the one he died for. God is all holy.
[1:19:55] There is nothing to him but holiness.
[1:19:58] That's all purity. Amen. Where are we
[1:20:03] going to come to purity on our own?
[1:20:08] But you see, he created the whole
[1:20:11] avenue to come down that he declared to
[1:20:15] us, you're righteous because I'm
[1:20:18] righteous. You're holy because I'm holy.
[1:20:22] And he created in you and I the ability
[1:20:25] that even dealing with this flesh every
[1:20:28] single day in our best days, we're still
[1:20:32] dealing with this flesh. And he's
[1:20:34] created in us an ability that when we
[1:20:37] hear we can be righteous because he's
[1:20:39] righteous. And our response is, "Be it
[1:20:41] unto me." Amen. Let that come to pass. I
[1:20:44] say, "Amen, Lord. I will be holy. I will
[1:20:48] be righteous because you are righteous."
[1:20:50] And the word has created in me a desire
[1:20:54] and a longing. And I'm holding to this
[1:20:56] promise of the word that when you come
[1:20:59] as the prophet says in opening of the
[1:21:01] seventh seal that he comes it's Christ
[1:21:03] in you the hope of glory and you have to
[1:21:06] come. Now look my brother and sister I
[1:21:08] don't want to get political. Amen. But
[1:21:10] look at this. There's people that claim
[1:21:12] this message that don't believe that we
[1:21:15] are there. Yeah. Now, when you look at
[1:21:18] that and realize how can they claim that
[1:21:21] possession, that position, if Christ is
[1:21:24] not in them, that's right. If they're
[1:21:27] not in the open word, if they are not
[1:21:29] eating the book, if they do not have
[1:21:31] that of eating the flesh, eat my flesh,
[1:21:35] drink my blood, when they don't come,
[1:21:37] they can't come there because they're
[1:21:39] not having ability to recognize to to be
[1:21:42] a real believer. They have to have that
[1:21:44] in their life. That's right. They just
[1:21:47] can take the words. That's right. But
[1:21:49] I'll tell you, there comes a day that
[1:21:51] the words like the law is nothing but
[1:21:54] death. That's right. It takes a spirit
[1:21:56] to give life. That's right. And when the
[1:21:58] spirit anoints these words, my brother
[1:22:00] and sister, the bride lives. She grows
[1:22:03] and she has she has strength to uh uh
[1:22:07] deal with the day and and go forward. So
[1:22:10] these these seraraphims, they were
[1:22:11] created beings. And he never died for
[1:22:14] angels. He died for sinners. Never died
[1:22:16] for holy people. He died for unholy. And
[1:22:18] as long as you think you're holy, you he
[1:22:20] never done you no good. But when you
[1:22:22] realize, oh, thank you, Lord, for the
[1:22:25] realization. When you realize you're
[1:22:27] nothing, then he died. He died for you.
[1:22:30] See, when you realize that you're
[1:22:32] nothing, then he is. You was the one he
[1:22:36] died for. Amen. Oh man, I tell you that
[1:22:39] just stirs my heart to realize that. Oh,
[1:22:42] sorry. Pardon my way of expressing it.
[1:22:44] But God could cut all of you out of the
[1:22:46] picture and I can stand here and believe
[1:22:51] he died just for me. That's exactly
[1:22:54] right. Amen. My That's right. That could
[1:22:59] be taken with a very selfish approach,
[1:23:02] right?
[1:23:04] Or it could be taken in its utter
[1:23:06] simplicity that God deemed it that just
[1:23:10] for me he would have went to Calvary
[1:23:12] just for me. Don't have to have a whole
[1:23:15] crowd, a whole multitude. Doesn't have
[1:23:17] to have all the message believers on the
[1:23:20] earth and all of those in days gone by.
[1:23:22] I didn't have to have all of those. He
[1:23:24] went and died for me.
[1:23:29] Oh, I tell you, it just stirs my heart
[1:23:32] when we catch the nuance of that to
[1:23:34] realize I'm nothing and he still died
[1:23:38] just for me.
[1:23:41] Oh, God is all
[1:23:43] holy. There's nothing to him but
[1:23:45] holiness. That's all purity.
[1:23:49] You see, we had to have that place in us
[1:23:52] that he put there. Amen. I'm using the
[1:23:55] word created. I believe you follow me.
[1:23:58] He created that space for us to be able
[1:24:00] to say, "I'm holy
[1:24:03] tonight. I'm holy tonight. I'm pure
[1:24:05] tonight. I'm righteous tonight."
[1:24:09] But all of that is in him.
[1:24:12] But you also have to believe that he's
[1:24:15] made a propitiation for you to be in
[1:24:19] him.
[1:24:21] My brothers and sisters, it's not just I
[1:24:22] believe God sent a prophet. There's so
[1:24:25] many things that we have come. But you
[1:24:28] see, God prepared us to be able. You
[1:24:31] see, Judas believed Jesus was the
[1:24:34] Christ. But he got all discouraged
[1:24:37] because he was sure that Jesus was going
[1:24:40] to conquer the Romans, restore the land,
[1:24:42] was going to do all of this. All the
[1:24:44] wealth of the Romans was going to flow
[1:24:46] to them. And Judas had the bag. And
[1:24:49] Judas liked the idea that one of these
[1:24:51] days I'm going to be the secretary of
[1:24:54] the
[1:24:55] treasury. I'm going to be right up there
[1:24:58] and set in the
[1:25:00] cabinet. But it didn't happen the way he
[1:25:02] thought because what had been placed in
[1:25:07] him was a
[1:25:09] Judas spirit. And you say, "But that's
[1:25:12] his name." But the spirit is identified.
[1:25:14] Yeah, that Judah spirit just like
[1:25:17] alcohol that spirit is connected to
[1:25:19] alcohol, right? An alcoholic is caught
[1:25:22] by alcoholic spirit. So you look at that
[1:25:25] that Judas type spirit had caught him
[1:25:29] already and he had conceived what he
[1:25:32] thought it was going to be. But look at
[1:25:34] the utter simplicity that God placed in
[1:25:36] the bride of Christ. She believes the
[1:25:39] word. She believes what God has sent
[1:25:41] through a prophet to speak in this hour.
[1:25:44] She believes that. She doesn't have to
[1:25:45] understand every drop of it. She doesn't
[1:25:47] have to be able to write it out, give a
[1:25:49] thesis, be able to stand up in front of
[1:25:51] the church and explain it all in detail.
[1:25:53] She just believes it. And the prophet of
[1:25:55] God over and over and over the mantra of
[1:25:58] the song that he chose, only believe, my
[1:26:01] brother and sister, only study it out.
[1:26:04] Only research it. No, only believe.
[1:26:07] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Let me hurry
[1:26:10] along right here.
[1:26:12] You see the word come to reveal the
[1:26:15] place that the believer was made for.
[1:26:19] That's right. So God's giving us a very
[1:26:22] clear vision.
[1:26:24] Prophet goes beyond the curtain of time.
[1:26:26] It wasn't the Aahes. It wasn't dry,
[1:26:29] dusty sage brush and
[1:26:31] cacti. It was a beautiful
[1:26:35] place far off in the heavens somewhere.
[1:26:46] No, no. It's actually going to take
[1:26:48] place right here. A renovation is going
[1:26:52] to take place. The remodel like mankind
[1:26:55] has never seen. Amen. In a moment, the
[1:26:59] earth in a flash and a bang, burnt over.
[1:27:04] And the very seeds that God testified or
[1:27:08] placed in the beginning, the very light
[1:27:10] that he placed in the beginning, the
[1:27:12] very water he placed in the beginning,
[1:27:14] all of that is going to come. See, when
[1:27:16] the prophet of God says it's taking you
[1:27:18] back to the original, my brother and
[1:27:21] sister, it's not just taking us back in
[1:27:23] word form to the original, which we will
[1:27:25] because we are the word. That's right.
[1:27:28] Amen. We have become the word. That's
[1:27:30] right. But it will also be the seed that
[1:27:32] was sown here on the earth will come
[1:27:34] back. And that's why brother Brandham
[1:27:36] could stand and say now a heaven. He's
[1:27:39] up there in in uh uh BC up north in in
[1:27:42] the Rockies up there and he tells those
[1:27:45] brothers, "Heaven looks a lot like
[1:27:47] this." Yeah. Amen. If we don't
[1:27:50] understand that, we'd be thinking,
[1:27:52] "Wait, I thought heaven was people with
[1:27:54] halos floating around."
[1:28:00] Yeah. Oh my. You
[1:28:05] see, we'll get right down to a quote and
[1:28:07] we'll call it quits here. Yeah. See,
[1:28:10] heaven was made for you, the bornag
[1:28:12] again believer, and your soul was made
[1:28:15] for heaven. Amen. Amen. The eternity.
[1:28:18] Amen. Eternal coming from the mind of
[1:28:20] God. You were already made eternal.
[1:28:24] Amen. See, we have these ideas that I
[1:28:27] I'm going to labor. I'm going to
[1:28:28] struggle and I'm going to do this work
[1:28:29] and I'm going to be good and faithful
[1:28:31] and I'm going to do all of this so I can
[1:28:32] find eternal life to realize by the word
[1:28:35] itself showing us we already are eternal
[1:28:38] life. We are manifesting it here now and
[1:28:42] we cannot be lost. Now, if God said that
[1:28:45] uh I'm sorry I I just lost you. I
[1:28:47] couldn't do that. Then it would violate
[1:28:49] his own word. Amen. And God will never
[1:28:51] fail on his own words. So my brother and
[1:28:53] sister, if we believe that we are
[1:28:55] predestinated, can we can we just agree
[1:28:57] we're predestinated tonight? Amen. If we
[1:29:00] believe that we are predestinated, then
[1:29:02] we sit here, stand here, whatever
[1:29:04] tonight, eternal life is already in us.
[1:29:08] Amen. Because God is taking us right
[1:29:10] back to the beginning. Now, in the
[1:29:13] message of the
[1:29:14] rapture, today our last great
[1:29:17] reformation was Pentecost. And today,
[1:29:19] we're moving from that. And the
[1:29:20] Pentecostal message won't mix with this.
[1:29:22] Now, see what brother Brown's doing? A
[1:29:24] lot of people believe we're still and
[1:29:26] right in this very message are preaching
[1:29:28] that we've got to go back to Pentecost.
[1:29:29] But the prophet is telling us here,
[1:29:31] we've moved beyond this. Amen. And and
[1:29:34] the Pentecostal me won't mix with this
[1:29:36] because it's another day. It's all the
[1:29:39] word of God, but it's building like
[1:29:41] feet, arms coming up. It's forming a
[1:29:44] bride for the rapture. The bride's not
[1:29:47] just going to say, "I believe God sent a
[1:29:49] prophet." and go in a rapture, my
[1:29:51] brother and sister. But she's being
[1:29:52] formed. She's being sent through the
[1:29:54] flood. She's being sent through the
[1:29:56] fire. She's being proved by the word.
[1:29:58] Amen. And God is forming us. Imagine
[1:30:01] what everybody thought when Michelangelo
[1:30:03] was a chip chip here and a chip chip
[1:30:05] there. They must have thought, "What is
[1:30:07] what is he looking at?" But see, he
[1:30:10] didn't look at what he saw. He looked at
[1:30:13] what he knew was there. And aren't you
[1:30:14] glad God's not looking at what he sees.
[1:30:16] He's looking what he knows is there.
[1:30:19] Amen. Hallelujah. See, don't don't
[1:30:22] displace them people back there. They
[1:30:24] lived to their message. All of them will
[1:30:27] come out that was in the bride. I kind
[1:30:31] of included that. Let's see. We got to
[1:30:32] be careful that we don't say, "Well, we
[1:30:34] have the cutting edge of revelation in
[1:30:36] the message by God's grace and everybody
[1:30:39] else." It doesn't work that way. There's
[1:30:42] some of these people that have been
[1:30:44] marginalized around the message. Oh,
[1:30:47] they just too Pentecostal. They don't
[1:30:48] have the revealed word. I'm talking
[1:30:50] about oldfashioned Pentecostals and and
[1:30:53] that you know, oh that no, my brother
[1:30:55] and sister, they live their word.
[1:30:59] Let's live our word. Amen. Let let's not
[1:31:02] push anybody down and let's just live
[1:31:04] our word that's revealed here. Okay, let
[1:31:08] me keep going here. Quotes, quotes,
[1:31:10] quotes. I don't normally like to do this
[1:31:12] many, but these just all reached out.
[1:31:14] Amen. The mighty conqueror. Amen. Now
[1:31:17] look at this. And then we when we go out
[1:31:20] of this earth, when we die and are going
[1:31:23] into another type of body, that's not
[1:31:25] the kind of body we wasn't made for
[1:31:32] heaven. Yeah, this could confuse some
[1:31:35] people I know because of things they've,
[1:31:38] you know, positions they've
[1:31:40] taken. We were made for earth. We're
[1:31:44] earthn people. And do you remember in
[1:31:46] the Bible souls under the altar crying
[1:31:48] how long? And they were crying to get
[1:31:50] back to a body
[1:31:52] again. Shake one another's hands and eat
[1:31:54] and fellowship. That's what we were
[1:31:57] made. That's how what we were made for.
[1:32:00] And when they have a sign there that
[1:32:02] they're going back, what is it? The
[1:32:04] corporal body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:06] sitting on the throne of God. And when
[1:32:08] we pass by that one, if we go today and
[1:32:12] we don't come for a hundred years and I
[1:32:14] meet you there, I'll say someday we're
[1:32:16] going back. Amen. So the prophet of
[1:32:19] God's telling us if I pass from this
[1:32:22] life and a hundred years goes by, I'll
[1:32:26] be able to tell you we're going back.
[1:32:29] Yeah. Now, where are we going back to?
[1:32:31] In a lot of people's minds, they're in
[1:32:34] heaven. There's nowhere to go. They've
[1:32:37] already walking on the streets of gold.
[1:32:39] They're
[1:32:40] already No, my brother and sister, we
[1:32:43] sometimes got to just get a little
[1:32:45] clarity. See there, that body will rise
[1:32:49] from the throne again. It will come back
[1:32:51] to the earth. And when he does, every
[1:32:53] spirit that's born again. Here's the
[1:32:55] catch. Here's the caveat that that
[1:32:57] really does the separating. Every spirit
[1:33:00] that's born again will come back to a
[1:33:02] corporal body, young men and women, and
[1:33:05] live forever in the presence of God. And
[1:33:10] God created you to fulfill that. That's
[1:33:13] exactly Amen. Isn't that beautiful?
[1:33:16] Amen. We weren't called to be angels.
[1:33:18] You know, that that is a doctrine passed
[1:33:20] through the message here, you know, 15
[1:33:22] years or so ago, you know, oh, oh, we're
[1:33:25] angels. No, my brother and sister, the
[1:33:27] prophet clearly says, "We're not angels.
[1:33:29] We were made for this earth. The angels
[1:33:32] knew no sin, and we are sinners that
[1:33:35] have been saved by God's grace." Amen.
[1:33:38] His perfect grace. Amen. To save a
[1:33:43] perfect people. Oh, could we change that
[1:33:46] without changing the
[1:33:49] word?
[1:33:51] Revealed perfect people.
[1:33:54] Because really, it's the word that
[1:33:57] actually does the declaring of who we
[1:34:00] are. I can say myself over and over
[1:34:04] again, I'm a believer. I'm a believer.
[1:34:06] I'm a believer. But it's actually the
[1:34:10] word, God's achievement
[1:34:13] that proves we're
[1:34:16] believers. Amen. Sister Ruth, would you
[1:34:18] come? Amen.
[1:34:22] Sister
[1:34:23] Nessa. Amen. I tell you, it's uh I I've
[1:34:28] just uh barely scratched the surface
[1:34:31] when you start digging through these
[1:34:33] things. Amen. I would lift my hand
[1:34:36] tonight. Maybe you would choose to when
[1:34:38] you hear this. Lord, I desire to be all
[1:34:42] that you called me to be. Amen. I don't
[1:34:45] want to just fulfill a little portion of
[1:34:47] it. I want to be all that you called me
[1:34:49] to be, Lord. Amen. And I might not even
[1:34:52] recognize all that I am called to be.
[1:34:55] But if I come and fulfill what God has
[1:34:59] revealed to me
[1:35:01] faithfully, the word clearly shows us
[1:35:04] that the Lord will pour more in. It's
[1:35:06] like the Holy Ghost. People are worried
[1:35:07] about, oh, you know what? If I lose the
[1:35:09] Holy Ghost. Well, I'll tell you, my
[1:35:11] brother and sister, you can sit on it
[1:35:13] until it's stale, and you can talk about
[1:35:15] how when you were 15, you got the Holy
[1:35:17] Ghost, and now you're 65. It'll be stale
[1:35:20] by then.
[1:35:21] Or you can just pour it out with the
[1:35:24] promise that God will pour it back in
[1:35:27] and have a fresh anointing of the Holy
[1:35:30] Spirit in our lives day by day. I say,
[1:35:34] Lord, help us. Amen. The deep calling is
[1:35:39] pulling us into a different dimension.
[1:35:42] Hallelujah. The prophet shows us so
[1:35:44] clearly. It's just right here. That's
[1:35:46] right. It's just right here, saints.
[1:35:48] It's not a far off. It's not out there
[1:35:50] beyond the heavens somewhere in the
[1:35:53] galaxies. It's
[1:35:55] just right
[1:35:57] here. Let's live like our next step.
[1:36:00] Amen. Will take us to another
[1:36:03] dimensional.
[1:36:04] Hallelujah.
[1:36:06] Hallelujah. Let's just stand and sing a
[1:36:08] song or two if you don't
[1:36:10] mind. 196. In moments like
[1:36:14] these, hallelujah. And just uh thank the
[1:36:17] Lord in times like this. It just
[1:36:19] encourages my heart that we can just
[1:36:22] come and worship the Lord and and just
[1:36:25] realize
[1:36:27] I was
[1:36:29] called, you know, just as it was with
[1:36:31] Esther. Morai speaks to her. It was for
[1:36:35] this time.
[1:36:37] And we were called for this time. I say
[1:36:41] thank you, Lord. In
[1:36:44] moments like
[1:36:47] thee, I sing out a
[1:36:53] song. I sing out a love song to
[1:37:04] Jesus. In
[1:37:07] moments like
[1:37:10] these, I lift up my
[1:37:15] hands. I lift up my hands to the Lord.

[1:37:55] you,
[1:37:58] Lord.
[1:38:01] I
[1:38:04] love you.

[1:38:10] moments like
[1:38:13] these, how I sing out a
[1:38:18] [Music]
[1:38:19] song. I sing out a love song to Jesus.
[1:38:31] In
[1:38:32] moments like
[1:38:35] these, I lift
[1:38:38] up my
[1:38:41] heart. I lift up my heart to the
[1:38:52] Lord. Sing
[1:38:55] I
[1:38:57] love you
[1:39:01] Lord.
[1:39:03] Singing
[1:39:05] I
[1:39:07] love you Lord.
[1:39:16] I
[1:39:18] love
[1:39:20] you,
[1:39:23] Lord.

[1:39:29] love
[1:39:31] you. We'll ask our brother Isaac to lead
[1:39:34] us. 893, Brother
[1:39:36] Alex. Amen. God bless you. We love you,
[1:39:40] saints.
[1:39:41] Amen. The Lord be with you the rest of
[1:39:43] the week.
