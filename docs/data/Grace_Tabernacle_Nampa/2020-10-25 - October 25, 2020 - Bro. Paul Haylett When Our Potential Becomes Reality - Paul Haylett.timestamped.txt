[40:32] hallelujah can we say amen this morning
[40:35] hallelujah
[40:36] lord just listen to our hearts oh
[40:40] hallelujah hallelujah
[40:44] you know saints i'm just visiting with
[40:46] sister jerry
[40:49] kind of took yesterday afternoon off
[40:51] just to rest up
[40:52] and you know we make mistakes every day
[40:57] prophet of god encourages us he says you
[40:59] know what you need
[41:01] to repent every day
[41:04] hallelujah amen so when you look at this
[41:08] and realize
[41:09] that god already recognized the weakness
[41:13] of humanity
[41:17] don't let your weakness control you
[41:19] [Music]
[41:22] come on saints i want to make that
[41:23] emphasis this morning i don't care what
[41:26] issue you have in your life what issue
[41:28] you have
[41:29] in your family don't let your weakness
[41:34] control you
[41:35] [Music]
[41:38] because if you do you might as well run
[41:40] up the white flag right now and walk out
[41:42] [Music]
[41:44] because the prophet of god showed us
[41:47] satan studies you now get this
[41:51] none of you here today including my own
[41:54] wife
[41:55] would say brother paul knows every
[41:58] detail of my life
[42:00] right can't
[42:03] but the prophet of god showed us how
[42:05] satan studied you
[42:06] [Music]
[42:08] he knows your every
[42:11] weakness and if you don't believe that
[42:15] the
[42:16] enemy would not exploit the weakness
[42:19] then you are delusional
[42:23] so what's he going to do saints he's
[42:26] going to come into your life
[42:28] into your family into your marriage
[42:31] into your relationship with your
[42:33] children or your parents
[42:35] your relationship with brothers and
[42:36] sisters and he's going to find that one
[42:39] weakness
[42:41] and he's going to exploit it he's going
[42:44] to come in and say you know what
[42:46] here is the one place they have fear
[42:49] here is the one place that they they
[42:52] have
[42:53] some kind of complex nobody loves me
[42:56] nobody cares about me
[42:57] [Music]
[43:03] hallelujah oh
[43:07] there's power in the name of jesus
[43:10] amen he's our strong tower that's our
[43:13] that's our only place
[43:15] you see we can live on any continent any
[43:17] nation
[43:18] under any circumstance
[43:20] [Music]
[43:22] that will not just exempt you
[43:25] from satan attacking him so we can all
[43:29] pack up right now move to the wilderness
[43:31] satan will still be there
[43:35] or we can seek the strong tower the
[43:37] refuge we can get into him the prophet
[43:40] of god
[43:40] talking about he is our rest he is our
[43:43] peace
[43:43] sabbath is not a day it's our position
[43:48] in jesus christ if you're unhappy
[43:51] this morning no one around you
[43:54] let me just drive this home to you if
[43:56] you are unhappy this morning
[43:59] no one around you can bring you peace
[44:02] [Music]
[44:05] only him only him can we say only him
[44:10] hallelujah that's the only place we will
[44:13] find peace is in him
[44:16] amen oh hallelujah
[44:20] well
[44:23] brother alex is probably brother paul
[44:25] are you ever going to preach on that big
[44:27] thing that you've laid out before us
[44:28] i am actually i'm just choosing or
[44:31] feeling led
[44:32] to preach on those that are sold out
[44:36] and not those that have opted out
[44:43] the compromise my brother and sister
[44:45] never brings
[44:47] the full reward there's no recompense of
[44:50] reward
[44:51] for the compromiser
[44:54] i possessed all of it you know my father
[44:56] taught me when i first started
[44:58] in business many years ago my father
[45:00] drove home to me
[45:02] this idea he said paul
[45:05] it's not yours if you owe
[45:08] even one dollar against it
[45:13] saints this rest the sabbath jesus
[45:16] christ
[45:16] is not ours unless we are completely
[45:20] sold out hallelujah
[45:24] oh my god i could preach a sermon
[45:27] as a prie to the sermon i want to preach
[45:31] amen when our potential becomes reality
[45:34] saints is what we're going to talk about
[45:36] today
[45:37] uh may god just deal with our hearts you
[45:39] see
[45:40] jesus christ is our absolute if he is
[45:42] not our absolute
[45:44] now i want to just lay this out the word
[45:47] of god says
[45:48] that our relationship we'll touch on
[45:49] this today our relationship with one
[45:52] another
[45:54] is as the relationship that we are in
[45:57] christ
[45:58] so we as a body of believers let's go
[46:02] specifically to husband and wife the
[46:03] word says that they
[46:05] uh leave all things and uh become one
[46:08] right they leave father and mother and
[46:11] they leave all of that and they become
[46:12] one now the word of god shows us and
[46:15] we'll deal with this today lord willing
[46:18] how that we come and we were of him
[46:22] but we're separated from that
[46:25] now what does satan want to do my
[46:27] brother and sister you look at this in
[46:28] the spiritual bring it right all the way
[46:30] down
[46:31] to the family all the way down in
[46:33] humanity
[46:34] satan is always working to separate
[46:39] you don't ever see satan come to someone
[46:42] and say you know what you need to do you
[46:43] need to pray more you need to read your
[46:45] bible more
[46:46] what he does is he gives us reason to be
[46:48] angry or
[46:49] upset or distracted and then he
[46:52] magnifies that and and what happens is
[46:55] the separation becomes greater
[46:58] but i tell you what i serve a god who
[47:00] specializes in putting things back
[47:02] together
[47:03] hallelujah and we'll we'll if i ever get
[47:05] started here we'll
[47:07] get started amen let's just turn in our
[47:09] bibles this morning to the book of
[47:11] romans
[47:11] the eighth chapter uh would you just if
[47:14] you would please repeat after
[47:16] me this morning my prayer
[47:19] makes a difference hallelujah
[47:22] amen you've got to believe that saints
[47:30] now as i was studying for this i kept
[47:34] kind of reaching out to the lord lord
[47:36] what would
[47:38] encapsulate i guess when i would
[47:42] want to share today and i feel like the
[47:44] lord led me to romans 8
[47:46] 14 for as many
[47:50] as are led you realize that everyone's
[47:53] led
[47:54] yes we're led by one of two spirits
[47:58] amen everyone is led so right here
[48:01] he is speaking to the romans now let me
[48:04] interject this i have a quote but i
[48:06] won't read it this morning it'll get
[48:07] drawn out
[48:08] but my brother and sister when the
[48:10] apostle paul
[48:11] was taken to the backside of the desert
[48:14] god did not remind the apostle paul
[48:16] that you have persecuted the church he
[48:18] did not come down
[48:20] on him and say you know what you're not
[48:21] worthy of this that adversary that kept
[48:24] bringing that up in paul's mind was the
[48:26] devil
[48:27] amen but what he did is he took paul and
[48:30] run him through his particular
[48:32] circumstance of
[48:34] his life and part of that was because
[48:36] the power of god was going to be
[48:38] manifested
[48:39] in paul and god gave him the ingredient
[48:42] to keep him humble
[48:45] oh my imagine what some of us would be
[48:47] if god did not give us
[48:49] an ingredient to keep us humble
[48:52] oh hallelujah say thank you lord amen
[48:55] because there's nothing worse that's
[48:57] the word of god says nothing worse than
[48:59] an arrogant spirit
[49:01] amen that will lead you into all kinds
[49:03] of strife
[49:05] for as many as are led by the spirit
[49:08] of god amen we could say this is the
[49:12] holy ghost right
[49:13] because it's all god right
[49:17] and his spirit come down upon you and i
[49:20] amen that's our leadership but it's god
[49:23] amen led by the spirit of god they are
[49:27] the sons of god
[49:28] for ye have not received the spirit oh
[49:31] we're into spirits this morning
[49:33] you've not received a spirit of bondage
[49:35] again to fear
[49:37] but have received the spirit of adoption
[49:41] whereby we cry abba father or my father
[49:44] my father
[49:46] the spirit itself now look how closely
[49:50] my brother and sister we have to be
[49:51] identified with this spirit
[49:53] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[49:57] our
[49:58] spirit now look we can't say we have the
[50:01] holy ghost and have a spirit
[50:02] contrary to the spirit of god
[50:08] amen whoa i want you to think about that
[50:11] that could be about a year's topic right
[50:14] there
[50:15] amen amen it bears witnesses
[50:18] that we are the children of god
[50:21] something
[50:22] inside of us is compelling and drawing
[50:24] us and we identify
[50:26] amen look at look saints i don't want to
[50:28] be distracted today just lots of
[50:30] thoughts going through my mind
[50:32] but just stop for a moment and think of
[50:34] all the things that you could be
[50:36] identified with today
[50:43] i like motorcycles and things that go
[50:45] fast
[50:48] just think about that just in one little
[50:51] realm
[50:53] all the things you could be identified
[50:54] with
[50:59] but this holy ghost comes upon us
[51:03] and identifies us as sons and daughters
[51:06] of god
[51:08] wow and you know just for an example
[51:12] not advocating anything but just for an
[51:14] example
[51:15] you can be identified in jesus christ
[51:18] and still ride a motorcycle isn't that
[51:19] right brother tim
[51:21] amen you don't backslide because you get
[51:23] on the bike
[51:24] right but if you put the bike first
[51:27] you're already backslid
[51:29] all things have to be in perspective
[51:33] excuse me you're all standing aren't you
[51:38] and if children then heirs and heirs of
[51:40] god and joint heirs with christ as so be
[51:42] that we suffer with him
[51:44] that we may be also glorified together
[51:49] i reckon that the sufferings of this
[51:51] present time are not worthy
[51:54] to be compared with the glory put them
[51:56] on the scale saints
[51:58] suffering in glory which shall be
[52:00] revealed
[52:02] come on words matter do they not words
[52:04] matter it doesn't say be revealed to us
[52:08] no catch that not to us
[52:11] it would be revealed in
[52:14] us hallelujah see a lot of people are
[52:18] going to be able to say god sent a
[52:20] prophet in this age
[52:21] a lot of people are going to be able to
[52:23] say that the holy spirit has come down
[52:24] and moved in our day
[52:26] but if it's not revealed in
[52:30] them oh look at that night and day
[52:33] difference right there
[52:35] not just to you
[52:39] in you for the earnest expectation of
[52:43] the creature which brother branham shows
[52:44] us his creation
[52:46] for the earnest expectation of the
[52:48] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[52:51] of the sons of god heavenly father we
[52:54] just ask you today lord
[52:55] amen father come down and speak to us
[52:58] lord
[52:59] let it only be according to thy word
[53:01] bind us father from any other thought or
[53:03] idea or word
[53:05] lord that the saints could come today
[53:07] including myself in that body
[53:10] and rejoice as we worship in your
[53:12] presence we ask you now to come speak to
[53:15] us in the name
[53:16] of jesus christ amen god bless you you
[53:19] may be seated
[53:21] you know i believe his brother kidri
[53:22] diggs made the statement
[53:24] he said you know we come to church and
[53:27] he says that we come
[53:28] and through song and and these things we
[53:31] give
[53:31] praise and worship to the lord
[53:34] he said now is the time that we give
[53:38] worship to the lord
[53:40] in the word that's right hallelujah
[53:42] songs are great song service is great i
[53:44] thought we were going to have a song
[53:46] special this morning
[53:47] but i guess that didn't happen amen but
[53:50] you know look at these things my brother
[53:52] and sister
[53:53] i want to come and i want to worship the
[53:55] lord in the word today
[53:57] amen i want to dive right into the word
[53:59] of god and
[54:00] when god wants a punctuation and i'm not
[54:02] looking for amens don't misunderstand
[54:04] but when god wants a punctuation of his
[54:06] word
[54:06] he wants you to say i agree with that
[54:09] amen
[54:10] i identify with that amen then go ahead
[54:13] feel free
[54:14] however you want to punctuate that amen
[54:17] just let god know you agree
[54:19] amen now as we'll look at this i want to
[54:21] just take out of this
[54:23] 19th verse if i really took all that i
[54:26] want to express
[54:26] out of this this morning uh we we
[54:29] wouldn't get anywhere as it were
[54:30] but i just want to take out the verse 19
[54:33] for the earnest expectation of the
[54:35] creature or creation
[54:37] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[54:39] of god
[54:40] amen now i want to just bring to you in
[54:43] in from webster online amen
[54:46] manifestation a sign that shows
[54:49] something clearly so let's just put that
[54:52] right in here
[54:53] the earnest expectation of the creature
[54:55] waiteth
[54:57] for a sign that shows something clearly
[54:59] of the sons of god
[55:01] amen you see something's got to happen
[55:04] first
[55:04] this bride of christ must come to a
[55:07] maturity
[55:08] she must come to a place right that she
[55:11] is not a babe amen that a man
[55:13] marries and then waits to grow up that's
[55:15] just wrong amen so you look at this and
[55:18] realize that there's something that must
[55:20] be shown
[55:21] also in there it says one of the forms
[55:23] that something has
[55:24] when it appears or occurs occurs
[55:27] amen an occurrence in which the spirit
[55:30] of a dead person
[55:32] appears you see
[55:36] we're not concerned with all that
[55:37] webster had to say
[55:39] that's right hallelujah we'll come to
[55:42] halloween
[55:44] there's all kinds of spirits and
[55:46] whatever that they put out there
[55:48] and whatever now i'm just going to
[55:50] express this as an opinion okay
[55:52] i'm not going to try and make it a
[55:54] church doctrine but i'll tell you what i
[55:56] don't find much reason to celebrate
[55:58] the night of the living dead
[56:02] amen i have no reason to celebrate the
[56:04] ghouls and the ghosts and
[56:06] whatever although casper was a friendly
[56:08] ghost
[56:11] but you see my brother and sister when
[56:13] we look at a manifestation we must
[56:15] always remember there's two spirits in
[56:17] the framework of the church
[56:19] and so while the word of god has called
[56:22] for a bride to be manifested
[56:24] amen there is also the anti-type or
[56:27] counter type
[56:28] being manifested amen so you look at
[56:31] that
[56:31] now i want to jump right down here a
[56:33] little farther in webster's
[56:35] definition a perceptible outward
[56:38] or visible expression amen so
[56:42] creation is waiting for a perceptible
[56:45] something that can actually be measured
[56:47] or seen outward or visible
[56:50] expression of the sons of god amen now
[56:53] let's jump down into another part of
[56:55] this
[56:56] it is a public demonstration of power
[56:59] and purpose you see my brother and
[57:01] sister
[57:02] we are not going to be a bride that is
[57:04] hid as it were
[57:05] in secret amen there will be an outward
[57:09] change and outward expression amen
[57:12] it will be perceptible you won't hold it
[57:15] in and
[57:16] look like the world act like the world
[57:17] smell like the world talk like the world
[57:19] and say i'm a christian there will be an
[57:22] expression
[57:23] of the spirit of god amen the holy ghost
[57:27] cannot come in you without changing you
[57:31] amen i believe it was either spurgeon or
[57:33] tozer
[57:34] all the way back years and years ago
[57:36] said there would come a time
[57:38] that people would claim i'm paraphrasing
[57:40] it would claim
[57:41] to have god and be able to remain
[57:45] as they are tell me we're not in that
[57:48] time
[57:49] we're in this season that people say
[57:52] i've got the holy ghost but they don't
[57:53] change
[57:55] you cannot have the holy ghost and not
[57:58] change
[58:00] amen now i want to go into the book of
[58:03] revelations here
[58:04] to kind of revelation to kind of lay out
[58:07] a little foundation
[58:08] as we further our thought today now
[58:11] revelation 5
[58:12] 1 and i saw in the right hand of him
[58:14] that said on the throne a book written
[58:16] within and on the backside sealed with
[58:19] seven seals
[58:20] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[58:22] with a loud voice
[58:24] who is worthy to open the book and to
[58:27] loose the seals thereof
[58:29] and no man in heaven nor in earth
[58:32] neither under the earth was able to open
[58:35] the book
[58:36] neither to look thereon and i wept much
[58:40] remember this is john speaking
[58:42] and i wept much because no man was found
[58:44] worthy to open
[58:46] and read the book neither to look
[58:48] thereon
[58:49] and one of the elders saith unto me weep
[58:52] not
[58:52] oh come on my brother and sister we're
[58:55] here today weep not
[58:57] i don't care what your circumstance is
[59:00] weep not
[59:01] amen he's on the scene amen hallelujah
[59:07] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[59:12] the root of david half prevail
[59:16] to open the book and to lose the seven
[59:18] seals
[59:19] thereof now i'm going to make a
[59:21] statement here you know i hope i don't
[59:23] offend anybody
[59:24] but i'm going to grind some of these
[59:25] axes till i'm done with them till i feel
[59:27] like the god's there
[59:28] we had a great big fuss in this church
[59:30] about the seals being open or closed
[59:32] now this is going to be direct and the
[59:34] people that maybe would listen i i'm
[59:36] sorry don't mean to offend you
[59:37] but my brother and sister we are not
[59:40] going to
[59:40] sit still and let people come into our
[59:43] midst
[59:44] and tell us what we believe amen we
[59:48] have a revelation from god it was not
[59:51] now this
[59:52] is not going to be my sermon today but
[59:54] my brother and sister
[59:55] there is so much difference between
[59:58] being taught
[1:00:00] and it being revealed
[1:00:06] and i will never again as your pastor i
[1:00:09] apologize i will never
[1:00:10] again stand and let something a spirit
[1:00:14] rise up in our church and tell us we're
[1:00:17] here
[1:00:17] you're wrong you change
[1:00:21] hallelujah in fact i've been praying
[1:00:23] about maybe we have a paper for people
[1:00:25] who when they come into our church
[1:00:27] just to hand it to them and tell them
[1:00:28] read this and if you can agree
[1:00:30] you're welcome come on
[1:00:33] sounds a little harsh don't it but look
[1:00:35] how a spirit can come in
[1:00:37] and disrupt everything
[1:00:41] now when you think about this being the
[1:00:42] family of god let me bring it back to a
[1:00:44] human element
[1:00:45] if someone showed up to your house and
[1:00:48] you have a little routine in your house
[1:00:50] right a little thing
[1:00:51] that your family does the way your life
[1:00:53] moves
[1:00:54] and they come along and said you know
[1:00:56] what you cannot have your toothbrush on
[1:00:58] the left hand side of the sink it must
[1:01:00] be on the right
[1:01:01] you cannot do this your pots and pans
[1:01:03] can't be there they must be here
[1:01:05] you cannot have pizza on friday nights
[1:01:10] yeah you gotta have fish that's right
[1:01:13] whole another spirit lined up to a whole
[1:01:16] nother thing that's good brother david
[1:01:18] that's that's good i like that
[1:01:20] hallelujah now my brother and sister how
[1:01:22] many of us would just sit back and day
[1:01:25] after day and week after week say
[1:01:26] well i guess all these years our
[1:01:28] toothbrush has been on the wrong side of
[1:01:30] the sink
[1:01:32] and i guess the pots and pans need to be
[1:01:34] as far away from the stove as we can get
[1:01:37] them
[1:01:38] no we wouldn't do that we wouldn't put
[1:01:39] up with it say you know what you know if
[1:01:41] you want to have a voice in this house
[1:01:48] come on you better marry into this
[1:01:51] you better already be part of this but
[1:01:54] don't come into my house and tell me
[1:01:57] now you might say brother paul you're
[1:01:58] being kind of blunt yes i am saints
[1:02:01] because you see as we keep butting up
[1:02:03] against spirits
[1:02:05] we either come on we'll either overcome
[1:02:08] that spirit
[1:02:10] or we will surrender to that spirit all
[1:02:13] right
[1:02:14] well hallelujah i'm here to tell you i
[1:02:16] didn't come all this way to give up now
[1:02:18] all right thank the lord amen i got my
[1:02:21] fingers
[1:02:21] on the threshold of glory and no one's
[1:02:25] going to come and distract me
[1:02:28] to start picking up cans at five cents a
[1:02:30] piece in the bar ditch
[1:02:37] amen
[1:02:40] and i saw in the right hand of him that
[1:02:42] said on the throne a book written within
[1:02:44] and on the backside
[1:02:45] sealed with seven seals and i saw a
[1:02:47] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[1:02:49] voice who is worthy to open the book
[1:02:51] and to loose the seals thereof and no
[1:02:53] man in heaven nor in earth nor under the
[1:02:56] earth was able to open the book neither
[1:02:57] to look
[1:02:58] thereon and i wept much because no man
[1:03:01] was found worthy to open
[1:03:03] and read the book neither to look
[1:03:05] thereon and one of the elders saith unto
[1:03:08] me
[1:03:08] weep not hallelujah i've got a little
[1:03:11] revival going on this morning saints
[1:03:13] we've not
[1:03:15] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:03:18] the root of david
[1:03:19] hath prevailed to open the book and to
[1:03:21] lose the seven
[1:03:22] seals thereof now look my brother and
[1:03:25] sister around the message today there's
[1:03:27] a lot of people
[1:03:28] that don't believe that we are in the
[1:03:29] open world
[1:03:31] they believe that something still must
[1:03:33] come
[1:03:34] there must be something else or some
[1:03:36] kind of a revelation some kind of deal
[1:03:39] many believe i'm not insulting them i i
[1:03:42] understand
[1:03:43] these things trust me but my brother and
[1:03:45] sister there's nowhere in the word that
[1:03:47] shows that a prophet has to come back
[1:03:49] and make two appearances in the flesh
[1:03:52] amen so
[1:03:53] everything that we need has already been
[1:03:55] given
[1:03:56] amen everything the bride needs is
[1:03:58] already been given to her
[1:04:00] including the revelation that her name
[1:04:03] was in that book
[1:04:04] amen this is not us waiting to see if
[1:04:08] we're the bride of christ
[1:04:09] it is us through revelation knowing we
[1:04:13] were called of almighty god
[1:04:15] to be a part of the bride of christ amen
[1:04:18] it's not determinate to some man some
[1:04:20] ministry
[1:04:21] some organization to come and say you're
[1:04:24] in you're out
[1:04:24] but it's the holy ghost himself the
[1:04:28] open book revealed to you and i
[1:04:31] revealing to us this is the way the
[1:04:34] truth
[1:04:34] and the life hallelujah i'm not looking
[1:04:37] for another way
[1:04:39] as i've shared many times with yet a
[1:04:41] friend that tried to convince me
[1:04:42] to come and convince you that we were on
[1:04:45] the wrong path
[1:04:46] remain as a church worship god just go
[1:04:48] on a different path
[1:04:49] and i told him you know what i'll leave
[1:04:52] i'll leave this message
[1:04:53] when something greater comes now greater
[1:04:55] my brother and sister
[1:04:56] is a very unique expression because
[1:04:59] greater could be
[1:05:00] something that's more flashy like we
[1:05:02] build a new big mega church and we do
[1:05:04] this and
[1:05:05] greater but i'm talking about a greater
[1:05:07] presence of jehovah
[1:05:09] as when something greater would come i
[1:05:12] would be able to
[1:05:13] walk on
[1:05:16] that spooked some people but you see my
[1:05:19] brother and sister
[1:05:20] it it'd have to line up with the word
[1:05:23] i'm not gonna walk on to something
[1:05:25] that's just an experience oh we felt so
[1:05:29] good no it's gotta line up with a word
[1:05:32] and i told this friend of mine don't
[1:05:34] expect anything to happen
[1:05:36] anytime soon amen
[1:05:39] because you see my brother and sister
[1:05:41] god's got a plan he's got a way he's got
[1:05:43] something he's doing
[1:05:44] he's opening his word amen
[1:05:48] in this bride by the opening of the word
[1:05:52] that's right by the opening of this book
[1:05:55] amen now it says no man was worthy to
[1:05:58] look upon that book even
[1:06:00] so it wasn't because god took sister
[1:06:03] to the banisters of heaven and she read
[1:06:05] her name
[1:06:06] in that book but it was by
[1:06:10] revelation that when that book was
[1:06:13] open my name is
[1:06:16] in that book
[1:06:19] hallelujah now if you let the devil talk
[1:06:21] you out of that because you have some
[1:06:23] little thorn in your flesh
[1:06:24] some little weakness in your flesh my
[1:06:26] brother and sister you might as well
[1:06:28] just run up your little white flag amen
[1:06:30] but i tell you that isn't what the bride
[1:06:32] of christ is what's she going to do
[1:06:34] she's going to say lord i have this
[1:06:36] issue lord i have a trouble here lord
[1:06:38] whatever it might be
[1:06:39] forgive me lord and she's going to rise
[1:06:42] back up
[1:06:43] and she's going to take one more step
[1:06:45] now look my brother and sister
[1:06:47] it's sometimes as it is that in the
[1:06:50] journey of life
[1:06:53] we walk a long time and it seems like
[1:06:55] nothing changed
[1:07:01] nothing's changed in my life
[1:07:04] nothing's changed in my marriage
[1:07:06] nothing's changed in my family
[1:07:07] nothing's changed
[1:07:10] but if you just persevere this is where
[1:07:14] the revelation that your name is in the
[1:07:15] book comes
[1:07:16] and becomes foundational to you that
[1:07:19] it's not about how i feel
[1:07:22] it's not about what my reasoning is my
[1:07:24] knowledge is it's not about any of that
[1:07:27] it's about the revelation my name is in
[1:07:30] that book
[1:07:32] i can't quit i can't stop now i can't
[1:07:35] turn back
[1:07:36] i can't take another pathway because the
[1:07:38] revelation that your name is in the book
[1:07:41] we'll keep you in the pathway
[1:07:45] hallelujah without that revelation see
[1:07:47] you can be distracted to a lot of things
[1:07:50] i thought it was funny here the other
[1:07:51] day i said well you know no doubt that
[1:07:53] brother paul has said things that
[1:07:55] that hurt you you disagreed with
[1:07:57] offended you or whatever
[1:07:58] now a lot of you had the look but some
[1:08:00] of you actually had the courage to lift
[1:08:01] your hands
[1:08:10] are not revelation saints every petty
[1:08:13] thing
[1:08:13] that's it will be a reason to walk away
[1:08:17] that's exactly right
[1:08:18] amen but if you're following paul
[1:08:22] i want all of your money today
[1:08:26] no see see what i'm talking about
[1:08:30] look i have on my phone i wish i had it
[1:08:32] on the screen right now i have in my
[1:08:33] phone
[1:08:34] a billboard i give you a picture here
[1:08:35] here's a big billboard
[1:08:38] and here's four or five sheep down in
[1:08:40] front
[1:08:41] and on the billboard is a picture of a
[1:08:44] wolf in a suit
[1:08:47] and the words on the side of the
[1:08:48] billboard say i
[1:08:50] will eat you and one sheep looks
[1:08:54] the other one and says he sure says it
[1:08:57] straight
[1:09:04] come on i'll tell you what the devil
[1:09:07] will do hit him right down and he'll
[1:09:08] speak
[1:09:09] so blunt that people will agree with him
[1:09:14] well brother trevor
[1:09:20] it's probably right
[1:09:24] before this life is over
[1:09:28] he'll probably eat us
[1:09:31] no sir bride of christ out there with
[1:09:34] her little pink bucket
[1:09:36] and she's painting right over that
[1:09:37] billboard that was a lie
[1:09:39] from the pits of hell amen
[1:09:42] and then maybe it not might not be near
[1:09:44] as pretty as the devil's picture up
[1:09:46] there
[1:09:46] but then you're going to see a little
[1:09:47] stepladder and another little sheep
[1:09:50] up there for painting on the board
[1:09:55] i am redeemed
[1:10:01] it might not be as pretty as what
[1:10:03] satan's got to offer
[1:10:05] and we might have some reservation and
[1:10:07] there might be some drips from your
[1:10:08] paintbrush and everybody's like well
[1:10:10] that's
[1:10:10] that that's just not that's just not
[1:10:12] what we expected
[1:10:14] well i'll tell you what my brother and
[1:10:15] sister when the devil looks at you and
[1:10:16] says i will eat you
[1:10:18] he's telling the truth and many people
[1:10:20] will stand right there and say yep
[1:10:22] amen
[1:10:28] well
[1:10:30] notice there's no interest in humanity
[1:10:31] of eating the wolf
[1:10:35] but there's a lot of interest in
[1:10:36] humanity of eating the sheep
[1:10:39] come on amen
[1:10:46] and i be held and lo in the midst of the
[1:10:48] throne and the four beasts
[1:10:49] in the midst of the elders stood a lamb
[1:10:52] as i had been slain having seven horns
[1:10:54] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[1:10:56] of god
[1:10:57] sent forth into all the ages and we
[1:10:59] won't go into that as believers we
[1:11:01] understand
[1:11:02] these are seven church ages certain
[1:11:04] messengers amen
[1:11:06] and he came and took the book out of the
[1:11:07] right hand of him that said upon the
[1:11:09] throne
[1:11:10] and when he had taken the book the four
[1:11:12] beasts and four and 20 elders fell down
[1:11:14] before the lamb
[1:11:15] having every one of them harps and
[1:11:17] golden vials full of odors
[1:11:19] which are the prayers of the saints
[1:11:23] now my brother and sister do you
[1:11:24] recognize
[1:11:26] that your prayers amen my prayer makes a
[1:11:30] difference
[1:11:31] do you realize that god had already
[1:11:33] given credit or benefit of your prayer
[1:11:37] that you prayed this morning
[1:11:39] right here in the opening of the word
[1:11:42] was
[1:11:42] already a manifestation
[1:11:45] of your prayers hallelujah
[1:11:50] god knew what you would pray for he knew
[1:11:52] what your heart would cry for
[1:11:54] he knew who you were oh hallelujah
[1:11:59] and so here it is this vile coming
[1:12:01] forward the prayer of the saints
[1:12:03] and they sung a new song saying thou art
[1:12:06] worthy to take the book
[1:12:08] and open the seals thereof for thou
[1:12:11] was slain and has redeemed us to god
[1:12:15] by the blood out of every kindred
[1:12:18] and tongue and people and nation
[1:12:22] i had a brother send me a deal last
[1:12:25] night my brother and sister
[1:12:27] and this is out of tanzania and there is
[1:12:30] a sister i don't remember the name of
[1:12:32] the tribe
[1:12:33] the very fierce people they said but she
[1:12:35] received
[1:12:36] the message about 10 years ago and they
[1:12:38] live 50 miles
[1:12:40] out in no man's land she's never been in
[1:12:42] church
[1:12:44] not a day of her life ever been in
[1:12:45] church but the message
[1:12:47] came to her she believes the message
[1:12:51] she believes it with all of her heart 10
[1:12:53] years has gone by
[1:12:54] and now she has a brother starting to
[1:12:57] believe the message
[1:12:59] amen you see god working faithful my
[1:13:02] brother and sister
[1:13:03] well you know i i we're not going to
[1:13:05] circumvent that the scripture tells us
[1:13:07] to assemble ourselves together
[1:13:09] that the benefit of fellowship and being
[1:13:11] around one another
[1:13:13] encouraging one another my brother and
[1:13:15] sister
[1:13:16] but you don't tell me that god does not
[1:13:18] have sustaining power
[1:13:20] well i just couldn't go ahead and serve
[1:13:22] god because i didn't this and i didn't
[1:13:24] that come on my brother and sister
[1:13:26] let the word of god loose in your life
[1:13:30] give him preeminence in his life he can
[1:13:32] send you to the backside of a desert
[1:13:34] paul didn't have a big church to support
[1:13:36] him he had the holy ghost
[1:13:39] amen let the holy ghost come down and be
[1:13:41] your support
[1:13:42] amen say amen to it brother paul
[1:13:46] oh paul listen to the preacher
[1:13:50] amen hallelujah see
[1:13:53] by the blood out of every kindred tongue
[1:13:56] and people and nation
[1:13:57] amen and house made
[1:14:01] us hmm ineos is here
[1:14:04] unto our god kings and priests
[1:14:08] now my brother and sister and we shall
[1:14:10] reign on the earth let me finish that
[1:14:12] now i want you to look at this word hast
[1:14:15] something just attracted me drew me to
[1:14:17] that
[1:14:17] the word hast my brother and sister is
[1:14:20] the past tense we want to get into all
[1:14:22] of the technicalities of the english
[1:14:24] language and
[1:14:25] all these things uh uh but it is the
[1:14:27] past tense of half
[1:14:30] amen but it is in the context of
[1:14:33] already done it's already finished
[1:14:37] house made us come on are you with me
[1:14:40] this morning
[1:14:40] has made us past tense already finished
[1:14:44] unto our god kings and priests
[1:14:47] amen i'm not looking to be a king or a
[1:14:49] priest someday
[1:14:50] i am one right now
[1:14:53] [Applause]
[1:14:55] past amen oh hallelujah i think
[1:14:58] sometimes we ought to change our
[1:15:00] vocabulary
[1:15:01] from i will try to overcome or i want to
[1:15:04] this
[1:15:05] to be able to stand up and say i have
[1:15:07] already amen
[1:15:08] past tense i hast overcome yes
[1:15:11] amen i have been healed you said that
[1:15:15] ain't proper english i don't care about
[1:15:16] your english my brother and sister
[1:15:18] it's the meaning of the word that
[1:15:20] matters
[1:15:21] amen look at the past tense side of it
[1:15:24] claim it it's a finished
[1:15:26] work that's right hallelujah
[1:15:31] i'm already i know this probably would
[1:15:33] just gaff a few people that i could
[1:15:34] stand up here because they're like yeah
[1:15:36] we know you
[1:15:38] but i'm telling you right now i'm a king
[1:15:39] and a priest
[1:15:41] and i'm not boasting i'm not arrogant
[1:15:43] i'm not trying to claim
[1:15:45] i'm just believing my word amen amen i'm
[1:15:48] just believing the word that's come
[1:15:51] hallelujah you know i heard a brother
[1:15:54] one time said yep we're gonna reign on
[1:15:56] the earth in the millennium
[1:15:57] now i heard another brother totally
[1:15:59] unassociated not a rebuttal or anything
[1:16:01] said we're already reigning we're all
[1:16:04] reading two different ideas one looking
[1:16:06] to the millennium we're going to reign
[1:16:07] another one saying i'm an overcomer
[1:16:09] i i claim amen i claim
[1:16:12] my authority oh remember that beautiful
[1:16:16] little story brother branham talks about
[1:16:18] that little guy out there he describes
[1:16:20] that little hat coming down over his
[1:16:22] ears
[1:16:22] and that little baggy uniform and he
[1:16:25] just wasn't much
[1:16:26] nobody really thought much of him but
[1:16:28] because
[1:16:29] he wasn't the power oh he's not going to
[1:16:33] stop that old buick roadmaster
[1:16:36] amen but when he threw his hand out
[1:16:38] there and he blew that whistle
[1:16:40] he was representing the power and he had
[1:16:42] the authority
[1:16:44] to represent that power amen i'm going
[1:16:47] to
[1:16:48] reign right now amen i'm going to make a
[1:16:51] decision to reign right now
[1:16:53] because i don't have to wait some time
[1:16:56] in the future because we are living
[1:16:59] under the open word
[1:17:01] so every promise in the book is the
[1:17:04] pastors
[1:17:07] hallelujah come on some of you need to
[1:17:09] open your mouth and say that
[1:17:10] every promise in the book is mine
[1:17:16] every chapter every verse every line
[1:17:19] amen hallelujah amen
[1:17:22] that's right
[1:17:26] you see my brother and sister it's pants
[1:17:29] past tense it's already done
[1:17:32] and i beheld and i heard the voice of
[1:17:34] many angels round about the throne and
[1:17:36] the beasts and the elders
[1:17:38] and the number of them was ten thousand
[1:17:40] times ten thousand
[1:17:41] and thousands of thousands
[1:17:45] hallelujah then we've got little
[1:17:47] churches
[1:17:48] now this may be sound derogatory but i'm
[1:17:51] just putting this out here so you won't
[1:17:53] fall for that little spirit
[1:17:54] then you got little churches that got
[1:17:56] some twist on the word
[1:17:58] and they're saying yeah there's only a
[1:18:00] few of us but that's all that's going in
[1:18:02] the rapture just
[1:18:04] a few of us
[1:18:08] let's read this again
[1:18:12] let's read this again now this would be
[1:18:14] the saints of all ages my brother and
[1:18:16] sister
[1:18:21] ten thousand times ten thousand
[1:18:24] that's a definitive number we could put
[1:18:27] that one down that's how many there is
[1:18:29] except for then it comes and says in
[1:18:31] thousands of thousands
[1:18:33] god then takes the knowledge of what it
[1:18:35] is that we could build a doctrine around
[1:18:37] our uh what is ten thousand times ten
[1:18:40] thousand
[1:18:42] hundred thousand eight zero
[1:18:47] our hundred thousand and no more
[1:18:54] but then we're going to have to kind of
[1:18:56] get out of the united states and
[1:18:58] we're going to have to go to europe and
[1:19:00] we're going to have to go to asia and
[1:19:02] we're going to have to go to africa
[1:19:03] we're going to have to go to south
[1:19:05] america and we'll have to go all over
[1:19:07] north america
[1:19:08] because it's every nation of kindred and
[1:19:10] tongue it's much easier if i just tell
[1:19:12] you
[1:19:12] look saints we're so special no one else
[1:19:14] is going in the rapture but us
[1:19:16] and we don't need to go out of town
[1:19:17] that'll save us all the effort of going
[1:19:19] around the whole world to find the bride
[1:19:23] see all this stuff becomes nonsense it
[1:19:26] becomes
[1:19:26] nonsense everything pinned to one spot
[1:19:29] pinned to one ministry pinned to one
[1:19:31] whatever
[1:19:32] my brother and sister that's not the
[1:19:33] word of god in fact i'm going to be on
[1:19:36] my notes so we might as well just jump
[1:19:38] all the way off the bridge instead of
[1:19:40] just hanging by one hand
[1:19:41] my brother and sister i want you to go
[1:19:43] back i want you to study the message see
[1:19:44] what brother branham talks about the
[1:19:46] apostle paul
[1:19:47] amen now brother branham goes beyond the
[1:19:49] curtain of time and he's there in the
[1:19:51] midst of those people
[1:19:52] and all that takes place there at first
[1:19:54] he's like these are all branham's no
[1:19:56] these are your converts this one here
[1:19:58] was
[1:19:58] old no wonder they're thankful
[1:20:02] no wonder they're saying my precious
[1:20:03] brother my precious brother
[1:20:06] amen they were old before they come to
[1:20:08] the lord
[1:20:14] brother branham says oh you're all
[1:20:16] secure
[1:20:17] you heard my message now what does he
[1:20:20] say
[1:20:22] he said i preached but who
[1:20:28] i preached what paul
[1:20:33] preached and whatever they were there
[1:20:37] like
[1:20:38] oh no big deal no sir their voices rung
[1:20:42] to the heavens
[1:20:43] are counting
[1:20:46] no you say are you bypassing brother
[1:20:48] branham no
[1:20:49] i'm not because if i am
[1:20:53] that means i don't recognize god
[1:20:56] in his messenger amen that's right amen
[1:21:01] wait the law of the first fruits
[1:21:08] all that was in god he poured into
[1:21:11] christ
[1:21:13] and he poured it into the church
[1:21:18] you see we can't exclude we can't cut
[1:21:20] this off
[1:21:21] it's not for us to decide amen
[1:21:24] hallelujah somebody tell brother paul to
[1:21:27] go faster
[1:21:28] amen
[1:21:31] hallelujah we'll just go ahead and move
[1:21:35] a little bit forward here
[1:21:37] now in the sermon in the rising of the
[1:21:39] sun
[1:21:40] i just want to come back i read this
[1:21:42] quote to the other day i
[1:21:44] cut it down because i just want to bring
[1:21:46] it into this little condensed spot
[1:21:48] and as he being the groom the bride has
[1:21:51] to come forth because
[1:21:52] it's a part of him now i want you to go
[1:21:54] back in your bible and just study
[1:21:56] how god moved there in the garden of
[1:21:58] eden
[1:21:59] and he brought out of adam see how the
[1:22:02] type ties together god has not got a
[1:22:04] changing pattern
[1:22:05] amen so he brought out of adam eve amen
[1:22:08] so here is this bride it comes forth
[1:22:12] because it's a part of him it can only
[1:22:15] be the manifestation of the fulfilling
[1:22:17] of all the revelation any others has
[1:22:21] spoke of the bride
[1:22:23] now i want to make an emphasis on that
[1:22:24] this morning you cannot come now
[1:22:27] in the 21st century and tweak
[1:22:30] how the word or the moving of the spirit
[1:22:33] will come upon the bride people are like
[1:22:34] well now there's going to be blood and i
[1:22:36] hope it doesn't offend anybody
[1:22:38] but there is a spirit behind this many
[1:22:40] would say
[1:22:41] the only way the bride's going to get it
[1:22:43] now is by pressing play
[1:22:46] i don't mean that offensive my brother
[1:22:47] and sister but please
[1:22:49] take me back to the word to support that
[1:22:52] idea
[1:22:54] amen i'm adamant about staying with
[1:22:57] the word of god i am not against anyone
[1:23:00] and if we're not listening to the tapes
[1:23:02] we're not studying the message
[1:23:04] there's something wrong there but you
[1:23:06] see the word never
[1:23:08] placed a preeminence upon that amen so
[1:23:11] you look at this now
[1:23:13] amen it's the revelation any others has
[1:23:16] spoke of the bride
[1:23:17] do you realize you can go all the way
[1:23:19] back into the early
[1:23:21] old testament and find the words
[1:23:24] speaking
[1:23:24] of the bride of this age amen god
[1:23:28] always through types and shadows
[1:23:30] pointing forward to the day
[1:23:33] so much to come down and say that those
[1:23:35] saints and patriarchs and
[1:23:37] faithful men of old longed
[1:23:40] to be here today oh hallelujah if they
[1:23:44] had their way we might have
[1:23:45] a saint paul or a matthew or mark or
[1:23:48] luke or a john or a timothy
[1:23:50] sitting in church with us if they have
[1:23:53] their way
[1:23:57] see so we got to take all that the word
[1:24:00] of god
[1:24:02] people around the message some of them
[1:24:03] say well we don't need the old testament
[1:24:05] anymore we have we have
[1:24:06] the answer we don't need the old
[1:24:07] testament why throw it out my brother
[1:24:09] and sister the word of god just shows us
[1:24:11] very clearly it's the type in the shadow
[1:24:12] of the new testament
[1:24:14] amen it was a foundation and the
[1:24:15] revelation come out in the new testament
[1:24:17] god brought it down where you and i
[1:24:18] would understand it
[1:24:20] so why would you cut it off why would
[1:24:21] you rip your bible in half
[1:24:23] and say we just don't need that portion
[1:24:25] because we got this because there's so
[1:24:27] many beautiful stories
[1:24:28] that are laid out in the old testament
[1:24:31] that give you the fundamental foundation
[1:24:33] for the revelation that was opened in
[1:24:35] the new testament
[1:24:37] and then when a prophet of god come and
[1:24:39] because because
[1:24:40] god chose to open the word completely
[1:24:44] right an open word an open book
[1:24:47] amen an open book is not a closed book
[1:24:50] an open book is not a partially open
[1:24:52] book
[1:24:53] an open book is an open book amen
[1:24:56] and so we come down in the time or the
[1:24:59] season of the open book
[1:25:01] and give us the very glimpse all the way
[1:25:04] back to the garden to see how these
[1:25:07] spirits work
[1:25:08] see what the manifestation of it was to
[1:25:11] see even
[1:25:12] your nature
[1:25:15] you realize your nature is revealed in
[1:25:17] the old testament
[1:25:18] no boy you look at that it's a rough
[1:25:21] book
[1:25:22] it's a rough book i'll tell you what my
[1:25:25] brother
[1:25:26] and sister it's a rough book
[1:25:29] people want to do but you know what we
[1:25:30] need to do we need to grow up
[1:25:33] come on saints we need to grow up man up
[1:25:36] warming up
[1:25:40] the word of god is right here before us
[1:25:41] we got no excuse
[1:25:43] instead of leaning on somebody else you
[1:25:46] know what the problem we have
[1:25:48] we lean on mama we lead on daddy we lean
[1:25:51] on the pastor
[1:25:52] we lean on brother whatever that we've
[1:25:53] almost turned into a saint
[1:25:56] oh we'll turn him into a satan and lean
[1:25:57] on him
[1:26:00] come on the word of god tells us to lean
[1:26:02] on him
[1:26:04] amen lean on him the revealed word of
[1:26:06] your day is christ
[1:26:07] revealed to you amen
[1:26:11] see if it does something different from
[1:26:14] the groom it isn't the bride that's
[1:26:15] right
[1:26:16] hallelujah because
[1:26:20] i love this yes she's flesh of his flesh
[1:26:24] oh hallelujah amen
[1:26:29] amen we wouldn't dress god the way we
[1:26:31] address
[1:26:32] ourselves sometimes and we wouldn't give
[1:26:36] an attribute of an attitude to god like
[1:26:39] we'll give
[1:26:40] to our self
[1:26:44] there's a lot of things we wouldn't do
[1:26:45] if jesus christ was actually standing
[1:26:47] right here
[1:26:48] that we do i'll lift my own hand and say
[1:26:51] lord forgive us
[1:26:52] lord forgive us amen but see she's flesh
[1:26:56] of his flesh bone of his bone

[1:27:49] you the word says
[1:27:51] i'm him you might not like what you look
[1:27:55] at you might not like me for a lot of
[1:27:57] reasons
[1:27:58] but the word and i'm sorry i'm going to
[1:28:01] take the word over your opinion
[1:28:03] i'm going to take the word over your
[1:28:04] feelings i am him
[1:28:08] hallelujah if you if your mirror ain't
[1:28:11] big enough go down here to
[1:28:13] walmart buy you a bigger mirror and
[1:28:16] stand in front of it
[1:28:17] and start telling yourself i am him
[1:28:21] that's right i am the word
[1:28:24] made flesh today
[1:28:29] now i'll just butcher this something
[1:28:30] terrible so forgive me
[1:28:33] but brother stephen coffey recently just
[1:28:36] speaking about how he visited
[1:28:39] over here and he visited over here and
[1:28:42] he was in louisville and he went over
[1:28:43] brother branham's grave and he said i
[1:28:45] was standing there
[1:28:46] and he said it affected me but not much
[1:28:48] i expected more out of it
[1:28:49] and then something hit me
[1:28:52] this is sacred ground you can go to bs
[1:28:56] bcf's website and you can listen to him
[1:28:58] you might have to listen the whole
[1:28:59] sermon to find it but that might do you
[1:29:01] good too
[1:29:03] but he said i this is sacred ground to
[1:29:05] god there's no doubt
[1:29:07] but it didn't move me i didn't go to
[1:29:09] brother brown's tomb and it really moved
[1:29:11] me
[1:29:12] because he's not there anymore
[1:29:17] he's in me that's it
[1:29:20] come on sam i want you to think about
[1:29:24] this we don't need to go to south africa
[1:29:26] and go sit in a restaurant in a booth
[1:29:28] that's the same booth
[1:29:30] we don't need to drive through the
[1:29:31] parkway and stop at the same bench where
[1:29:33] that happened we don't need to go to the
[1:29:35] same racetrack and be to do that
[1:29:37] you see those things are beautiful and
[1:29:39] those things are sacred to god
[1:29:42] but he's not dwelling in those places
[1:29:45] he's dwelling in you and i
[1:29:50] come on we don't need to build up a
[1:29:53] memorial
[1:29:56] oh hallelujah does god have memorials
[1:29:59] yes israel built memorials all the way
[1:30:01] across the wilderness
[1:30:04] but in years going by many of those
[1:30:07] memorials were torn down
[1:30:10] now they were torn down by the enemy by
[1:30:12] the opposition by whatever
[1:30:15] but you see my brother and sister god
[1:30:17] never called us
[1:30:19] go listen in this coming week i would
[1:30:22] encourage you go
[1:30:22] listen to god's chosen place
[1:30:25] of worship god's not identifying in a
[1:30:29] building
[1:30:30] he's not identifying in these things
[1:30:34] my brother and sister do you realize if
[1:30:36] it was in that place now i'm not being
[1:30:38] sacrilegious please i'm not trying to be
[1:30:42] but there's brothers still living that
[1:30:44] know where brother branham was standing
[1:30:46] when he rebuked the storm
[1:30:50] are you with me if it was in that place
[1:30:54] then you and i could go to that place
[1:30:56] and find that exact spot
[1:30:59] and wait till there was a storm and
[1:31:02] rebuke it
[1:31:06] but that's not what god intended god
[1:31:09] intended
[1:31:10] through the words of a prophet in our
[1:31:11] day to show us
[1:31:13] that we have the power to move mountains
[1:31:16] got a mountain in your life this morning
[1:31:19] come on saints i want to just speak
[1:31:21] direct to you
[1:31:22] do you have a mountain in your life then
[1:31:24] you have the authority by the word of
[1:31:27] god
[1:31:28] to speak to that mountain don't expect a
[1:31:31] great earth shaking movement
[1:31:33] it might be one little pebble on the
[1:31:35] back side
[1:31:36] that starts to move but just claim that
[1:31:38] i
[1:31:39] spoke god said it would happen i believe
[1:31:42] it
[1:31:42] and now it is finished
[1:31:45] oh hallelujah oh my
[1:31:49] i hope you don't think i'm out of line
[1:31:51] this morning but it's this time we get
[1:31:52] down to the rubber in the road
[1:31:55] amen amen now see power of his power
[1:31:58] she is him as a man and a woman or one
[1:32:01] and a woman taken from his side
[1:32:04] she had taken a spirit back to taking
[1:32:06] spirits
[1:32:09] she had taken a spirit the feminist
[1:32:11] spirit from him
[1:32:12] the flesh from his side made both
[1:32:15] mechanics and dynamics the wife
[1:32:18] now you know why we have a problem in
[1:32:20] the day we live in my brother and sister
[1:32:24] because the anointing of this word right
[1:32:26] here what did he say
[1:32:28] someone help me the flesh
[1:32:32] oh let's go up a little higher that's
[1:32:33] right as a man and a woman or one and
[1:32:35] the woman taken from his side she had
[1:32:37] taken a spirit
[1:32:38] a lot of women on this earth have taken
[1:32:40] a spirit right sir
[1:32:44] i got to be careful i hear the ice
[1:32:45] cracking
[1:32:47] the feminist spirit from him feminist
[1:32:50] feminist did i say this feminist
[1:32:52] i am not the manly woman that looks
[1:32:54] around like she's a marine
[1:32:57] the feminist amen
[1:33:00] hallelujah why does the world i read
[1:33:02] this recently i don't take credit for i
[1:33:04] read this recently this
[1:33:05] this person wrote and said why in the
[1:33:07] world do they want to make women the
[1:33:09] strong the burly the this the that
[1:33:12] when god created her in such a way to do
[1:33:15] so many things a man
[1:33:19] can't do
[1:33:23] and this is not no i forg forgive me for
[1:33:25] just being blunt but this is not just
[1:33:26] having babies
[1:33:30] and cooking food you know when i was
[1:33:37] about this big you know who i ran to
[1:33:42] when my world was hurting
[1:33:45] mama that's right now i hope you don't
[1:33:48] know get embarrassed about this
[1:33:51] i'm 58 years old
[1:33:54] we shouldn't speak words because they
[1:33:56] might come to pass but i'm getting
[1:33:57] grumpier
[1:33:58] as i get older
[1:34:08] but do you know when my world is kind of
[1:34:11] crashing in i'm talking more in a
[1:34:13] natural sense
[1:34:15] you know where i run to
[1:34:18] she's right here she's not my mama
[1:34:22] she's not my mom
[1:34:25] but you see she has the capacity to just
[1:34:28] wrap her arms around me and tap me on
[1:34:30] the back and say
[1:34:32] honey you just lost all the money you
[1:34:35] earned for me this year but
[1:34:37] it'll be all right that's it
[1:34:40] it'll be all right
[1:34:44] and what do i do i walk away from there
[1:34:46] it'll be all right
[1:34:49] it'll be all right
[1:34:52] come on can you take that from the
[1:34:53] natural move it over in the spiritual
[1:34:56] oh you have cancer what do we do
[1:35:00] we run back into him
[1:35:03] because we've received that spirit of
[1:35:06] him
[1:35:07] we're not independent we're not of our
[1:35:09] own that's it
[1:35:10] right for him amen amen
[1:35:14] made both the mechanics of flash from
[1:35:16] your side made both the mechanics and
[1:35:18] dynamics
[1:35:19] the wife think how incredible our
[1:35:23] sisters are
[1:35:24] if we give credit where credit's due but
[1:35:26] sisters please let me encourage
[1:35:28] you don't boss your husband around
[1:35:31] for one in the natural you get much more
[1:35:34] just suggesting it
[1:35:38] and when he lays his head down on the
[1:35:39] pillow at night
[1:35:41] and he's just drifting off to sleep
[1:35:44] whisper it in his ear
[1:35:47] you get more out of your husband by
[1:35:50] loving him
[1:35:51] that's it you will get more out of that
[1:35:54] relationship
[1:35:56] by pulling him as close i'm talking
[1:35:58] natural now
[1:36:00] pulling him as close as you can
[1:36:06] you'll get so much more than you will if
[1:36:08] you put him off at the end
[1:36:10] and tell him that's exactly right
[1:36:15] now if you want to type natural and
[1:36:17] spiritual just pull that back around to
[1:36:18] serving god
[1:36:19] that's exactly right lord if you don't
[1:36:22] do what i want i
[1:36:23] won't serve you no breakfast for you
[1:36:27] lord
[1:36:31] no how do you get something from god
[1:36:35] you pull him just as close
[1:36:38] as you can and he shows us in the word
[1:36:43] that when we come on help me hear
[1:36:45] somebody
[1:36:47] draw nigh unto him
[1:36:51] not putting god off in a distance
[1:36:53] somewhere
[1:36:54] people are like well you know i just
[1:36:56] i've heard this several times in the
[1:36:58] last while different situations
[1:37:00] people are like well i'm just struggling
[1:37:01] with the message because we're not
[1:37:02] seeing all the signs that the scripture
[1:37:04] says
[1:37:04] well i'm sorry from my side defense i'm
[1:37:08] seeing them
[1:37:10] my side defense my brother and sister
[1:37:11] may i maybe because you know
[1:37:13] the situation or the situation i'm in or
[1:37:16] the position i'm
[1:37:17] in i hear things you wouldn't hear but
[1:37:19] there's things god's moving my brother
[1:37:20] and sister god's moving in asia god's
[1:37:22] moving in africa south america
[1:37:24] god's moving in north america god's
[1:37:26] moving in the middle of africa amen
[1:37:28] europe
[1:37:29] god's moving don't give me this stuff
[1:37:31] just because your little world doesn't
[1:37:32] seem to have anything we never reconcile
[1:37:35] the fact that our attitude i'm not
[1:37:37] seeing god do a bloomin
[1:37:39] thing
[1:37:43] how close are you to him i hope you can
[1:37:48] catch us natural
[1:37:50] i almost asked my wife to stand up here
[1:37:52] so i could prove the point
[1:37:54] but my brother and sister when you're in
[1:37:57] the backyard
[1:38:00] you don't see the husband move
[1:38:05] are you with me yes sir oh
[1:38:08] forgive me i don't want to sound blunt
[1:38:10] but
[1:38:12] when you got your arms around your
[1:38:14] husband
[1:38:16] he can't move without you knowing it
[1:38:19] that's right come on
[1:38:23] get this over in the spiritual realm
[1:38:25] says he can't
[1:38:27] move without you knowing it if you have
[1:38:29] pulled yourself
[1:38:31] as close as you can amen
[1:38:35] but it's when you've got him out there
[1:38:38] somewhere
[1:38:39] you say nothing's happening where's the
[1:38:41] promise in this message
[1:38:43] that god would move that we would have a
[1:38:45] greater works than this
[1:38:47] well i'm sorry you're so far away yeah
[1:38:49] that's it i'm sorry you're
[1:38:51] you're so far away and your binoculars
[1:38:54] you've got tired of looking through them
[1:38:56] because you didn't see anything happen
[1:38:58] reminds me one time if you'll forgive me
[1:39:00] for just taking this back in the natural
[1:39:02] deal
[1:39:02] reminds me one time we were out hunting
[1:39:04] in the owyhees
[1:39:06] and uh we'd parked the truck in one spot
[1:39:08] where we knew they were dear there
[1:39:10] amen and no brother david i'm not
[1:39:11] telling you where that spot's at
[1:39:16] and uh i shot a really i shot a really
[1:39:19] really nice
[1:39:20] four point which my brother's dog
[1:39:23] promptly ain't the antlers
[1:39:24] a few months after that so but
[1:39:28] we went down into this valley and we
[1:39:30] crossed through this deal we'd walked a
[1:39:31] long ways in fact we were talking to
[1:39:33] ourselves when we'd meet up and rest
[1:39:34] dreading the idea how far we're going to
[1:39:36] walk back we come down
[1:39:38] on this little camp these guys were
[1:39:40] sitting around a fire
[1:39:41] it's about four o'clock in the afternoon
[1:39:43] one guy there he's cooking him some food
[1:39:45] and
[1:39:46] we said hey how's the hunt and they said
[1:39:47] there ain't nothing around here
[1:39:50] we have looked at every brush pile we
[1:39:52] have walked through every goalie
[1:39:54] every creek bottom we have been
[1:39:55] everywhere there's not a deer
[1:39:57] around here and we're like oh okay and
[1:39:59] he said where'd you guys park
[1:40:01] we said well go over that mountain
[1:40:03] through that valley up that way and
[1:40:04] over that deal and that's where we're at
[1:40:06] he goes my if i was you guys
[1:40:08] i'd be head back to camp we all looked
[1:40:11] at each other
[1:40:12] we're looking at this hillside behind
[1:40:13] their camp there's three or four big
[1:40:15] fingers of brush that go up this
[1:40:16] hillside right
[1:40:18] we all looked at each other and said
[1:40:19] we've come this far
[1:40:25] we started hiking up the mountain and we
[1:40:27] started shooting deer
[1:40:29] right in sight of their camp
[1:40:32] and when we come back down the mountain
[1:40:34] now we've got to get these deer because
[1:40:35] we're remembering that we can go up this
[1:40:37] road and down here it's about 20 miles
[1:40:39] and we go over here and come around here
[1:40:40] and come back down this thing
[1:40:41] but we'll be in a pickup so no big deal
[1:40:43] and so we can leave these deer right
[1:40:45] here
[1:40:45] and we come dragging these deer and
[1:40:48] we're all like
[1:40:49] can we get these deer off the mountain
[1:40:50] besides going by their camp
[1:40:53] not really look saints
[1:40:57] should never cower when you've just had
[1:40:58] a victory
[1:41:00] but we were walking by just paraphrase
[1:41:02] this with me here we're walking by the
[1:41:04] enemy's camp kind of looking the other
[1:41:06] way
[1:41:07] one guy's out there like why don't you
[1:41:09] go hunt your own part of the world you
[1:41:18] see saints
[1:41:19] i don't care where you're at i don't
[1:41:21] care what your circumstance is
[1:41:23] that is truth well brother paul you
[1:41:26] don't understand our circumstances i
[1:41:28] don't i don't i won't even pretend i
[1:41:29] understand
[1:41:30] i know that's true though that's right
[1:41:32] nothing else really matters i don't need
[1:41:34] to understand you i don't need to
[1:41:35] understand what's wrong in your world
[1:41:37] i know this is true that i was taken
[1:41:40] from his side
[1:41:41] and i have been made both the mechanics
[1:41:44] and the dynamics
[1:41:46] i'm his wife now you take a wife that
[1:41:50] gets married
[1:41:50] and she says well i'll tell you what i'm
[1:41:53] just doomed for
[1:41:54] 50 years of hell
[1:42:00] what kind of marriage did she expect
[1:42:02] when she started yeah
[1:42:05] that's right you get a you get a young
[1:42:08] woman with the right attitude
[1:42:11] watch out brothers don't blame me i'm
[1:42:13] preaching
[1:42:15] did you get a brother that his wife has
[1:42:18] that right approach
[1:42:20] and he's going to find his wallet flying
[1:42:22] out of his pocket all the time because
[1:42:23] she's going to be whispering his arrow
[1:42:25] honey if you would just
[1:42:32] are you guys able to handle this
[1:42:38] his heart's just going to start melting
[1:42:41] and all of his man friends are going to
[1:42:43] like go wow
[1:42:45] she's turning him into putty
[1:42:49] and then they're going to go home and
[1:42:50] look in the mirror and be able to say i
[1:42:52] know how he feels
[1:42:59] what is it amen mechanics
[1:43:02] dynamics the spirit of him and the flesh
[1:43:06] of him
[1:43:07] put it together die mechanics and
[1:43:10] dynamics
[1:43:11] until the church of the people it goes
[1:43:13] on and on you can go look it up here
[1:43:16] amen but i'll tell you i just wanted you
[1:43:18] to catch this my brother and sister
[1:43:20] you see this is how we get you say well
[1:43:22] is god moving in our midst just as much
[1:43:24] as you're moving to him he's moving to
[1:43:26] you
[1:43:28] you have distance to him he has distance
[1:43:30] to you
[1:43:31] come on amen let me just speak blunt to
[1:43:34] those that will be wives and husbands
[1:43:36] sometime in the future you want a good
[1:43:38] relationship
[1:43:40] you pull yourself just as close to your
[1:43:43] wife
[1:43:43] and just as close to your husband as you
[1:43:46] can
[1:43:47] because the principle that applied to
[1:43:49] god draw nigh unto him he draws nigh
[1:43:51] unto you
[1:43:52] and god's word cannot be broken
[1:43:56] okay now we'll move on i'm finally
[1:43:57] getting to my subject
[1:43:59] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:44:03] oh my i want to just drop back for a
[1:44:06] moment
[1:44:06] it can only be the manifestation of the
[1:44:08] fulfilling of all the revelations
[1:44:11] any others has spoke of the bride so i
[1:44:14] can go back to matthew mark luke john
[1:44:16] timothy zachariah
[1:44:20] [Music]
[1:44:23] what did he say about to the bride
[1:44:25] that's me
[1:44:26] that's me i am his beloved and he is
[1:44:29] mine
[1:44:30] hallelujah that is possessive
[1:44:33] come on if some of you just get a little
[1:44:35] meet me give a little air kiss to make a
[1:44:37] point get you all nervous
[1:44:39] go read song of solomon that'll get some
[1:44:42] of you where you'll try and read it in
[1:44:43] the dark in your closet because you'll
[1:44:45] be so embarrassed
[1:44:47] but that's the truth of how god looks at
[1:44:50] you
[1:44:51] and i am amen
[1:44:56] he looked at every bit of us now get
[1:44:58] this i'm on this vein i might as well
[1:45:00] just go there for a second
[1:45:02] he looked at us
[1:45:05] at our comely and
[1:45:08] our uncomely parts
[1:45:12] and still said i love you that's it
[1:45:14] there you are
[1:45:20] you know i guess i got some people all
[1:45:23] kind of humorly tweakered here the other
[1:45:27] day because i
[1:45:28] made the point about don't marry for
[1:45:31] looks because
[1:45:31] looks don't last but cooking does some
[1:45:34] thought i was advocating you marry a
[1:45:36] ugly wife that can cook
[1:45:42] i thought it was advocating mary the
[1:45:44] most beautiful girl you can marry
[1:45:45] that cooks
[1:45:49] in case i didn't get that message across
[1:45:52] that's what i really meant
[1:45:54] but if she ain't got character you ain't
[1:45:56] got much that's right
[1:46:02] oh hallelujah
[1:46:06] now we'll look at that
[1:46:10] i want to just jump down and catch this
[1:46:12] last little deal until that church
[1:46:13] becomes
[1:46:14] both dynamics and mechanics and
[1:46:17] the spirit of god that moved him to do
[1:46:20] the things that he did
[1:46:21] we're back to that spirit again you're
[1:46:23] going to have the same
[1:46:24] spirit can't have another spirit gotta
[1:46:28] have that same
[1:46:29] spirit amen
[1:46:34] now people don't like it when you talk
[1:46:35] about things like dominating female
[1:46:37] spirits
[1:46:39] usually it's the one with the dominating
[1:46:40] female spirit they don't like to preach
[1:46:42] or preaching about it but
[1:46:43] anyway moving beyond that moving beyond
[1:46:45] that
[1:46:47] you see
[1:46:52] well i was just talking to someone
[1:46:53] recently and they were this com comment
[1:46:55] made about well brother so and so preach
[1:46:57] this and mention dominating female
[1:46:58] spirits
[1:46:59] and this individual said you know when
[1:47:01] that happened i bowed my head and said
[1:47:02] lord please don't let that spirit get on
[1:47:04] me
[1:47:06] and others were like how dare
[1:47:09] him
[1:47:16] well okay we'll move on
[1:47:20] ryan until that church becomes both
[1:47:22] dynamics and mechanics right which
[1:47:24] brother brahms showed us is out of him
[1:47:26] and the spirit of god that moved him to
[1:47:28] do the things that he did
[1:47:30] if he hid on 16 cylinders so will the
[1:47:33] bride
[1:47:35] you see saints i'm not looking to hit on
[1:47:37] four cylinders
[1:47:38] i'm not looking to hit on six cylinders
[1:47:41] i'm not looking to hit on eight
[1:47:42] cylinders
[1:47:43] i'm not looking to hit on 12 cylinders
[1:47:46] if he hit
[1:47:47] on 16 cylinders i'm going to hit on 16
[1:47:51] cylinders
[1:47:52] hallelujah amen
[1:47:56] oh brother paul you take way too much
[1:47:59] liberty with the word thank you
[1:48:01] i take that as a compliment amen
[1:48:05] we got a moment nobody's nobody left
[1:48:07] their steak on the barbecue did they
[1:48:12] now here
[1:48:17] oh my
[1:48:25] you see the open manifestation of who
[1:48:27] the bride is
[1:48:28] how do we know who the bride is
[1:48:38] the identification of the bride was
[1:48:40] brought by the loosing
[1:48:42] of the word amen
[1:48:46] now i'll give you just what i consider
[1:48:47] an example if it doesn't quite fit the
[1:48:49] pattern forgive me
[1:48:51] but the prophet of god is now preaching
[1:48:52] in coliseums gymnasiums
[1:48:55] different places like that tents etc and
[1:48:58] he's having
[1:48:59] he is he's experiencing not him but the
[1:49:02] people i guess i should say
[1:49:03] are experiencing these great moves of
[1:49:05] god
[1:49:06] right many are healed little black girl
[1:49:11] wandering through the people crying out
[1:49:12] for her mama or daddy
[1:49:15] and brother branham's there and and
[1:49:16] she's there and and when she recognizes
[1:49:20] god comes on the scene she doesn't say
[1:49:23] i i think i'll see what my pastor says
[1:49:26] about it
[1:49:28] i'll see what this great man thinks
[1:49:30] about it
[1:49:34] she wants him see she don't know no
[1:49:35] different we know different so when
[1:49:37] people now start lifting the man up oh
[1:49:39] this man did this this man did that
[1:49:40] we got but when they didn't know better
[1:49:42] she just was wanting the healer
[1:49:44] you the healer now see brother brown
[1:49:47] could have went the whole explanation
[1:49:48] about no i'm just god's servant i can't
[1:49:50] heal nobody
[1:49:52] but you see god you might say winks in
[1:49:55] our ignorance
[1:49:56] and she's like are you the healer you
[1:49:58] the healer
[1:50:00] you can heal me
[1:50:04] right there what was it she
[1:50:07] knew she knew
[1:50:10] that this was god in flesh
[1:50:14] don't go into a big revel explanation
[1:50:17] big revelation about how this is this
[1:50:19] and we
[1:50:20] oh we don't mean we're going too far
[1:50:21] here and this is here you see my brother
[1:50:23] and sister we've got way out of balance
[1:50:26] god come down used man amen
[1:50:30] amen god sent a prophet the power of god
[1:50:33] the word of god was in that man's mouth
[1:50:36] absolutely but then he himself took us
[1:50:39] back to the word
[1:50:41] and said all that was in christ
[1:50:44] amen he poured into who
[1:50:49] that church
[1:50:53] when will we learn we are moving from
[1:50:57] potential
[1:50:58] to reality we're moving from just
[1:51:02] brother branham said this and we witness
[1:51:04] this and we have a
[1:51:04] right moving to the place
[1:51:08] that people are able to pray
[1:51:11] and see it manifested right in front of
[1:51:14] them
[1:51:15] oh my
[1:51:18] now we're living in another age glory oh
[1:51:21] i love this
[1:51:22] age many of us if given the chance would
[1:51:24] go back to pentecost
[1:51:26] don't you know now god has a mercy seat
[1:51:28] today to be guarded
[1:51:30] you believe that where's the mercy seat
[1:51:33] found
[1:51:34] amen the reason i bring this out my
[1:51:37] brother and sister is because there's a
[1:51:38] little faction moving around through the
[1:51:40] message that's like well
[1:51:42] you know if brother brown's left the
[1:51:43] mercy seat we don't need to be preaching
[1:51:45] none of this nothing's going to change
[1:51:46] but see they've missed the point here
[1:51:48] they've missed the point here
[1:51:50] see the prophet of god said where's the
[1:51:52] mercy seat found
[1:51:53] in the heart of man where did it come
[1:51:55] into the heart of man at the day of
[1:51:57] pentecost when the holy ghost
[1:51:58] which is god come into
[1:52:02] the human heart is that right now let's
[1:52:04] mark this down here and get ready to
[1:52:06] draw it if you want to
[1:52:08] pentecost i'll put pentecost
[1:52:11] this is the mercy seat the holy ghost
[1:52:13] put in here i'll tell you what
[1:52:14] make it more appropriate let's put in
[1:52:16] here the dove which means bird see all
[1:52:18] right
[1:52:19] guarding the mercy seat now god has got
[1:52:21] guards for the mercy seat today
[1:52:23] now watch how beautiful it's drawn out
[1:52:25] now i just give you a snippet of this
[1:52:27] you can take these notes you can go look
[1:52:29] it up you can read it
[1:52:30] but the prophet of god lays a whole
[1:52:33] foundation for us my brother and sister
[1:52:35] that for the bride of jesus christ
[1:52:39] he'll never leave the mercy
[1:52:43] if he is in our hearts
[1:52:46] how could he leave that mercy seat
[1:52:52] he will always saints be on the mercy
[1:52:55] seat
[1:52:55] for you and i he will always be
[1:52:59] there as our advocate he will
[1:53:02] always be there receiving our repentance
[1:53:06] but there will come a time on this earth
[1:53:08] when he steps from that
[1:53:10] and moves the lion now comes on this
[1:53:13] scene
[1:53:13] what has happened my brother and sister
[1:53:15] we're living in a day that many people
[1:53:17] even around the message are believing
[1:53:19] and as they look out they're expecting
[1:53:21] to see a lion he's left the mercy seat
[1:53:23] he's left the mercy seat
[1:53:24] brother branham said over here brother
[1:53:25] brown said over here brother brown said
[1:53:27] over here
[1:53:27] he said that but you have to understand
[1:53:31] the relationship between the bride
[1:53:34] and the bridegroom if we are flesh of
[1:53:38] his flesh
[1:53:39] bone of his bone amen
[1:53:42] he cannot cut you off he cannot abandon
[1:53:46] you
[1:53:47] he cannot leave you under a throne of
[1:53:50] judgment
[1:53:53] are you with me i don't want any
[1:53:55] misunderstoods here
[1:53:57] amen you see we when we come into that
[1:54:01] position
[1:54:01] must recognize we are not just a
[1:54:05] people but we're a chosen generation
[1:54:09] amen we're a people that god said i'll
[1:54:11] put my name
[1:54:12] in them i will mark them as being of my
[1:54:16] very own not just people looking for
[1:54:20] salvation i don't want to go to hell i
[1:54:21] don't want to go to hell
[1:54:23] amen if i can find this maybe i included
[1:54:25] it maybe i didn't
[1:54:26] or the prophet of god oh look at this
[1:54:28] let me just go
[1:54:30] see look what this is now
[1:54:33] the open manifestation of who the bride
[1:54:35] in was brought by the loosing of the
[1:54:36] word
[1:54:37] no other age no other generation my
[1:54:40] brother and sister as it were
[1:54:41] ever has had the word opened so far to
[1:54:45] them
[1:54:46] amen some looking to see the lion
[1:54:49] but when the bride looks she sees a lamb
[1:54:54] that's all she sees
[1:54:59] you come to church let me make a bold
[1:55:01] statement
[1:55:02] you come to church expecting to be
[1:55:04] judged you've come with the wrong
[1:55:05] attitude
[1:55:07] you've come with the wrong understanding
[1:55:10] you need to come to the house of god
[1:55:12] saying i come to see the lamb i come to
[1:55:15] see the lamb the lamb is here he
[1:55:17] promised to be here
[1:55:18] the lamb he gave his life for me he
[1:55:21] loves me
[1:55:21] he said i'm part of him he said he would
[1:55:24] never leave me he would leave the ninety
[1:55:26] and nine and come and
[1:55:27] find me that's how we need to come to
[1:55:31] the house of god
[1:55:32] but if you walk in and say i'm going to
[1:55:34] the house of judgment today it is a
[1:55:35] house of judgment
[1:55:37] prophet of god says i'm just
[1:55:39] paraphrasing this
[1:55:40] you can find it prophet of god says
[1:55:43] anyone
[1:55:45] with the right attitude in a bible
[1:55:48] and a pencil and a paper will only take
[1:55:52] a few
[1:55:52] moments to realize that we are sinners
[1:55:57] that's right
[1:56:04] i've got an advocate amen he's come
[1:56:08] he's coming oh he's standing there
[1:56:11] he's my advocate oh hallelujah i have an
[1:56:14] advocate i have an advocate hallelujah i
[1:56:16] have an advocate
[1:56:19] amen oh hallelujah
[1:56:25] you see how this is the lamb represented
[1:56:28] mercy
[1:56:34] a word to the bride
[1:56:38] you have to come and submit yourself to
[1:56:40] the word that's it
[1:56:44] there's no other way that's right
[1:56:47] sisters you know me
[1:56:51] if you can't submit yourself to your
[1:56:52] husband i don't care how many flaws he
[1:56:55] has
[1:56:57] if you can't submit yourself to your
[1:56:58] husband
[1:57:00] something's wrong that's right amen
[1:57:02] that's right
[1:57:05] maybe it'll come to a time in our life
[1:57:06] that we must look each other in the face
[1:57:08] speaking as it were in the natural look
[1:57:11] each other in the face and say we're
[1:57:12] both wrong
[1:57:17] but see this bride
[1:57:20] looks into the face of our lord jesus
[1:57:22] the word amen
[1:57:25] the word is not wrong amen
[1:57:29] the word is always right
[1:57:33] see this bride's come and submitted
[1:57:34] herself to the word
[1:57:36] she's already coming to judgment saints
[1:57:38] that's why she's not seeing a lion she's
[1:57:40] already coming to judgment
[1:57:41] she's already looked into the face of
[1:57:42] the word and said oh lord forgive me i'm
[1:57:45] a sinner
[1:57:46] lord forgive me i'm weak lord forgive me
[1:57:48] i'm frail
[1:57:50] amen
[1:57:54] oh hallelujah can i have just another
[1:57:57] minute or two
[1:58:04] hallelujah
[1:58:08] notice the pride if the bride in the
[1:58:10] beginning
[1:58:12] i want to be back on a positive note
[1:58:13] here okay i want you all to leave going
[1:58:16] we were beaten up in church we don't
[1:58:19] need a church paramedic
[1:58:22] amen the balm of gilead is sufficient
[1:58:28] notice the bride if
[1:58:32] the bride in the beginning was the word
[1:58:35] or the bridegroom and then if the bride
[1:58:37] is taken
[1:58:39] from the bridegroom now you see we have
[1:58:42] a decision
[1:58:43] to make right here we can decide that we
[1:58:47] have a mind of our own
[1:58:48] and we can read the word of god and
[1:58:50] interpret it our own way or we can stop
[1:58:52] and say this is what god said
[1:58:54] see it's our decision we make amen
[1:58:58] and i love free moral agency trust me i
[1:59:00] love free moral agency
[1:59:02] amen if i i preached this morning and
[1:59:05] then i got in our car and drove 150
[1:59:07] miles an hour down the boulevard
[1:59:09] my decision
[1:59:12] i'd have to go buy a different car to go
[1:59:13] that fast but anyway
[1:59:17] that would also be my decision
[1:59:22] the bridegroom then if the bride is
[1:59:24] taken from the bridegroom
[1:59:25] it must be the word also
[1:59:30] come on saints this is where i i
[1:59:32] question and sorry as i i admit the
[1:59:34] older i get kind of grumpier don't waste
[1:59:36] my time
[1:59:37] don't tell me you got the holy ghost and
[1:59:39] then deny the word
[1:59:41] prophet of god deals with that that's
[1:59:43] not my fault this is the prophet of god
[1:59:44] deals with it
[1:59:45] you cannot deny the word and claim to
[1:59:49] have the spirit of the word
[1:59:51] amen so this little bride amen
[1:59:55] must be the word also
[1:59:59] that's all she can be if we say lord i
[2:00:02] was taken out of you
[2:00:03] i'm part of you then we have to be the
[2:00:06] word
[2:00:08] notice the bride must be why why must
[2:00:11] the bridegroom be the word manifested
[2:00:13] made plain
[2:00:15] why must the bridegroom be the word
[2:00:18] manifested made plain
[2:00:20] is because the bride and the bridegroom
[2:00:23] are one
[2:00:27] now if god get this too long to explain
[2:00:30] it going back through the message
[2:00:32] if god expects you and i to be the word
[2:00:36] manifested
[2:00:38] does he not then have to come and
[2:00:40] manifest himself
[2:00:42] in our presence
[2:00:46] amen remember i preached last sunday on
[2:00:48] potential brother i'm talking about
[2:00:49] there with abraham
[2:00:50] potential amen why was that i want to
[2:00:53] catch this
[2:00:54] i never spoke it the other day and i was
[2:00:55] just working and it hit me i never said
[2:00:57] that

[2:01:11] no one else no one else get this
[2:01:15] no one else saw
[2:01:19] acknowledged and spoke elohim
[2:01:24] no one that's right
[2:01:27] no one
[2:01:31] you talk about god revealing himself to
[2:01:33] exclusive companies
[2:01:36] right down in the midst of the whole
[2:01:37] deal and revealing himself
[2:01:40] right in the midst of the camp
[2:01:50] she is just a smitten
[2:01:54] piece off of him think about this
[2:01:57] there is a masterpiece it was smitten
[2:01:59] say michelangelo could not reproduce
[2:02:02] that again

[2:02:30] trying to put that on there
[2:02:31] glue it in place sand it try to make no
[2:02:34] brother brown says that's what made it a
[2:02:36] masterpiece
[2:02:37] [Music]
[2:02:38] the fact that he was under the anointing
[2:02:41] and he smoked that
[2:02:42] oh come on i hope you catch this my
[2:02:44] brother and sister
[2:02:46] she is just a smitten piece off of him
[2:02:50] there is the masterpiece
[2:02:56] if god wanted you to be perfect he'd
[2:02:58] have made you like the angels
[2:03:02] that you're smitten peace off of him
[2:03:08] michelangelo could not reproduce that
[2:03:10] again he could not put it back
[2:03:11] but god is going to do it he's going to
[2:03:14] bring this
[2:03:15] little bride that's smitten right back
[2:03:18] to the side
[2:03:19] of the original word there he is

[2:03:57] you know i sent that little cartoon out
[2:03:58] on the church app
[2:04:00] i sent that with prejudice
[2:04:04] best sermon because it's ten minutes
[2:04:06] shorter i didn't preach a better sermon
[2:04:07] than last sunday because it's three
[2:04:09] minutes longer
[2:04:12] but you see my brother and sister we're
[2:04:15] not here to measure
[2:04:16] what we got sunday against the clock
[2:04:21] we are here to give
[2:04:24] our self to the word that's right amen
[2:04:27] right
[2:04:28] that's it lord you know you would have
[2:04:30] had me restored i would have been healed
[2:04:32] i would have been brought right back to
[2:04:34] the side of the original word but i
[2:04:35] gotta go
[2:04:39] um hallelujah
[2:04:43] no i'm not advocating that we as
[2:04:45] preachers just burn up your tongue
[2:04:47] but if god's here god's speaking it's
[2:04:50] real hallelujah
[2:04:53] amen and i said all that because i want
[2:04:55] 10 more minutes
[2:04:59] can i have 10 minutes amen
[2:05:02] well two hands three hands four five
[2:05:06] oh some of you i can see are determined
[2:05:08] not to lift a hand
[2:05:11] hallelujah i think you were outvoted now
[2:05:14] look this word half
[2:05:17] i want to use this with a quote below i
[2:05:19] want you to think about this word half
[2:05:21] now in the easter seal brother brown
[2:05:24] says
[2:05:25] but he that understandeth you see my
[2:05:28] brother and sister it's not about
[2:05:29] hearing
[2:05:30] people are like i listen to a sermon
[2:05:32] every single day
[2:05:34] i listen to prophet every single day
[2:05:36] still fight a bosom
[2:05:38] see that won't do it he did understand
[2:05:41] it look at these next words
[2:05:43] he that knoweth his place in this hour
[2:05:47] see it's not oh i don't mean to be
[2:05:50] hammering down on this saint it's not
[2:05:52] that we caught the revelation god sent a
[2:05:54] prophet
[2:05:55] you need to know your place
[2:05:58] in this hour there's where the
[2:06:01] difference is made
[2:06:02] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[2:06:05] him that sent me
[2:06:06] half oh look at this half brother
[2:06:09] branham even puts that in there
[2:06:11] present tense eternal life
[2:06:14] see not looking back we're not looking
[2:06:16] back we're not some other day
[2:06:18] you know oh i tell you it was like 10 12
[2:06:20] years ago
[2:06:21] i don't really remember the time but 10
[2:06:23] or 12 years ago we had a visiting
[2:06:24] minister here at the church and
[2:06:26] god moved so powerfully filled up the
[2:06:28] altars
[2:06:31] in the last 10 12 years well backslid
[2:06:33] but we can look to that time when the
[2:06:35] whole church was in the altar
[2:06:38] say past tense my brother and sister so
[2:06:40] we were talking earlier about a finished
[2:06:42] work
[2:06:43] yes we want to look back in the past
[2:06:46] tense
[2:06:46] it is a finished work here is when it
[2:06:49] was done
[2:06:50] it's finished but there comes a time we
[2:06:53] have to
[2:06:54] dwell in the present
[2:06:57] tense amen so we start living
[2:07:01] in the past tense
[2:07:05] we got a problem in this in this case
[2:07:09] shall not come into the judgment right
[2:07:11] we were talking about judgment earlier
[2:07:14] shall not come into the judgment why
[2:07:15] because they've already took the word
[2:07:17] and they've judged themselves and they
[2:07:19] looked into the word and they said
[2:07:21] oh my yes oh my lord i have fallen
[2:07:24] short lord forgive me no
[2:07:27] pastor no evangelist no preacher
[2:07:31] out here whipping you you no good people
[2:07:35] get in the altar
[2:07:38] you have sons and daughters of god
[2:07:41] looking
[2:07:42] in the word as i said the prophet of god
[2:07:45] saying
[2:07:46] if they have the right attitude and they
[2:07:48] have their bible
[2:07:50] and a pencil and paper it won't take
[2:07:51] very long for them to see their faults
[2:07:55] and we're man enough woman enough you
[2:07:57] know that's why i'm speaking a little
[2:07:59] rough forgive me
[2:08:00] you know what a lot of times our problem
[2:08:01] is
[2:08:03] it ain't the preacher any husband
[2:08:08] it ain't wife
[2:08:11] we're not man enough we're not woman
[2:08:13] enough to look at what we committed
[2:08:16] ourselves to
[2:08:18] our vow amen we made a vow
[2:08:25] someone help me i don't remember that
[2:08:27] that man was in the battle and he said
[2:08:28] lord
[2:08:29] i'll offer the first thing i see when i
[2:08:30] go home father if you allow us to win
[2:08:33] and he goes home and what is it his
[2:08:35] beautiful little girl
[2:08:37] and you think well there ain't no way
[2:08:39] because god passed a law as it were
[2:08:42] forbidding them to offer their children
[2:08:44] to kill their children
[2:08:46] ain't no way he can do that he's got a
[2:08:48] problem but that scripture you go
[2:08:50] study it proves right there god wants
[2:08:52] you to honor your vow
[2:08:54] more even than the law
[2:08:57] you make the vow stand with it be man
[2:08:59] enough be woman enough stand on it
[2:09:02] i made this vow i made it before god
[2:09:05] i'll stand on this lord i said i would
[2:09:08] serve you
[2:09:09] i will serve you amen
[2:09:15] see you then when this new eternal life
[2:09:17] dwells in you
[2:09:18] it is the potential or the earnestness
[2:09:20] of you being quickened
[2:09:21] from mortal to immortality let me say
[2:09:24] that again when this spirit has found
[2:09:26] you the individual
[2:09:27] and has come upon you it is a potential
[2:09:30] of your eternal
[2:09:31] inheritance that god thought of you and
[2:09:33] made for you before the foundation of
[2:09:35] the world
[2:09:36] that is your potential like if you ask
[2:09:39] me for an oak tree and i gave you an
[2:09:40] acorn
[2:09:42] oh most of us be offended
[2:09:45] now the life for the oak tree is in the
[2:09:48] acorn
[2:09:48] now but you have to wait till it grows
[2:09:51] up
[2:09:52] yeah look at that so do we
[2:09:56] when you receive the holy spirit of god
[2:09:58] it's god's potential waiting upon you
[2:10:00] that's already recognized you and you're
[2:10:03] sealed by the spirit of promise of god
[2:10:06] into the body of christ
[2:10:07] and when god looked down at calvary and
[2:10:09] seen jesus dying
[2:10:10] not only he died for his bride the body
[2:10:13] which is the word church
[2:10:15] the church that believes the word of god
[2:10:17] for the age
[2:10:18] whether it's feet body head whatever it
[2:10:20] is see it's christ was bleeding and died
[2:10:22] and god looked upon him and saw his
[2:10:24] resurrection in the church
[2:10:26] raised with him on easter now i want you
[2:10:28] to get all this
[2:10:30] together because i've got something here
[2:10:32] a little bit i want to say lord willing
[2:10:34] now notice it's the earnest that's it or
[2:10:37] the potential
[2:10:39] the quickening power of your
[2:10:40] resurrection when you receive the holy
[2:10:42] spirit is then
[2:10:43] dwelling in you the potential of it
[2:10:47] notice you are now on your way
[2:10:50] hallelujah i'm on my way
[2:10:52] oh there's a song about that i'm on my
[2:10:56] way
[2:10:56] what is that song i'm on my way to
[2:10:59] canaan's land hallelujah
[2:11:01] amen i'm on my way saints amen
[2:11:05] you might find me with a few skinned
[2:11:07] elbows and skinned knees and stubbed
[2:11:08] toes but
[2:11:10] hallelujah don't just count me down and
[2:11:12] out i'm on my way
[2:11:14] amen growing to the full resurrection no
[2:11:17] tree just comes up overnight it's got to
[2:11:18] grow and as we grow in the grace and
[2:11:20] knowledge of god you're baptized in the
[2:11:21] holy spirit
[2:11:22] now as the pentecostal church baptized
[2:11:24] in the holy spirit
[2:11:25] it began growing uh oh this is a part we
[2:11:29] never liked talking about
[2:11:31] limbs has died they was pruning them off
[2:11:35] but the tree is still growing it's still
[2:11:38] going on because it's got to come to the
[2:11:40] resurrection
[2:11:41] they're led by the spirit to the quicken
[2:11:44] the word
[2:11:45] to you who is believers
[2:11:48] oh hallelujah can somebody say that's me
[2:11:53] hallelujah the word keeps quickening
[2:11:57] as you come to the first limb second
[2:11:59] limb third limb on up
[2:12:01] it just keeps quickening the spirit of
[2:12:03] god
[2:12:04] keeps quickening amen to you
[2:12:09] hallelujah well hallelujah can we just
[2:12:13] stand that'll be a sure way i won't go
[2:12:14] ahead and keep preaching
[2:12:16] amen i'll tell you saints it's just hard
[2:12:19] i want to just tell you
[2:12:20] it's hard there's so much there there's
[2:12:23] so much more
[2:12:25] amen the spirit's quickening the bride
[2:12:28] amen moving her from potential to
[2:12:31] reality
[2:12:33] amen the potential is no good
[2:12:36] there's no good my brother and sister if
[2:12:38] you don't ever exercise that potential
[2:12:40] you will not ever reach out and say you
[2:12:41] know what
[2:12:42] this message came for me
[2:12:45] it's not a matter of whether a
[2:12:47] vindicated prophet or this or that or
[2:12:49] the other
[2:12:50] god sent a message to me and i'm
[2:12:53] here to open my arms and say lord i
[2:12:56] receive
[2:12:57] i receive lord this word that you come
[2:13:01] father if i'm not where i should be then
[2:13:04] lord let me submit
[2:13:05] myself and be quickened
[2:13:09] by your word oh hallelujah says
[2:13:13] amen you see something's got to move
[2:13:17] this bride
[2:13:18] in her potential from the reality
[2:13:22] of the potential to the reality of the
[2:13:25] prophesied word
[2:13:26] amen you see if there was no prophesied
[2:13:29] word you wouldn't be here today
[2:13:32] but there is a prophesied word and the
[2:13:35] potential in that prophesied word is
[2:13:37] here to turn you
[2:13:39] into the bride of christ will you
[2:13:42] receive it
[2:13:43] from your heart just say lord i am that
[2:13:46] bride
[2:13:47] i am the quickening of the word in the
[2:13:50] day that we live in i
[2:13:52] am the revelation of jesus christ
[2:13:56] it doesn't lie in a building it doesn't
[2:13:58] lie in a mountaintop it doesn't lie
[2:14:01] anywhere else because it is christ
[2:14:04] in you that's where he chose to dwell
[2:14:08] and that's where he's quickening himself
[2:14:11] is not in a church with four walls
[2:14:13] but in you as a bride coming oh
[2:14:16] i don't offend no one but my brother and
[2:14:19] sister if a man and a woman get married
[2:14:21] and they never consummate that marriage
[2:14:24] the courts
[2:14:24] even say that is not a marriage
[2:14:28] amen and you come and you put yourself
[2:14:32] in a position where you submit and say
[2:14:34] lord
[2:14:35] i am your wife i was taken from you
[2:14:39] i'm a part of you i will be in you
[2:14:42] and you said that you would be in me and
[2:14:45] with me
[2:14:46] even to the end oh don't let that just
[2:14:50] be words that we read
[2:14:51] scripture let that be life
[2:14:55] because it's in that that moves us from
[2:14:57] this flesh
[2:14:59] where it's always about the flesh always
[2:15:01] about i feel i
[2:15:03] see i understand i want i like i dislike
[2:15:07] to the place that we simply say lord i
[2:15:10] surrender
[2:15:11] i submit myself as your wife i submit
[2:15:16] myself to you move me
[2:15:20] as you will lead me as you will
[2:15:24] correct me as you will
[2:15:28] oh hallelujah
[2:15:32] and the bride responds with a great big
[2:15:35] amen hallelujah
[2:15:38] lord we want to be not just potential
[2:15:43] we want to be the reality of the bride
[2:15:46] of christ
[2:15:48] you know it's pretty funny i don't want
[2:15:50] to break the spirit but i want to make
[2:15:52] this point
[2:15:53] it's pretty funny i don't say this
[2:15:55] embarrass sister jerry it's just a
[2:15:57] reality it's
[2:15:58] those of you know as well know the story
[2:16:01] but before i even ask sister jerry to
[2:16:02] marry me
