here tonight saints and then you know i just want to mention right up front just a couple little things here uh one i want to say thank you to the brothers brother oh it helps if it's on my ear amen well i might have left more than my keys at home amen um anyway i just uh want to thank the brothers that have uh if you if you walk downstairs you'll see what has taken place in this last week is a tremendous transformation of um of the basement and uh brother sergey i know you know he just worked until he changed his clothes just a few minutes ago and uh go downstairs the water fountain works and the bathrooms work and the sink and the kitchen's all hooked up and we thank the lord for that brother ivan's been making walls and brother adam making walls and fixing things and and brother isaac was down working on the wiring the other night and i come with him and well maybe it's time for me just to be a pastor and not think that i could actually be much help i found myself standing in its way quite a bit but anyway i'm just very happy to see that and you know um we just want to remember brother bob sister joanne we just want to remember every need uh some of them outside of our assembly amen uh you know sometimes we we have a prayer request for them and if we kind of i don't know about you i'm just being honest sometimes they just slip from our thinking and uh the need is still there and uh so just let's try to be cognizant of of all of those needs around us and may the lord just touch um those in our community this gentleman paul um you know and things like that because i'd be a little bit of what we're going to speak on tonight amen now we are considering not having church on the wednesday between christian christmas and new year's because there's things that we need to tear apart here at the church that if not finished we'll leave the sisters without a door on their bathroom uh we'll leave the brothers with outdoor in their bathroom some things like that so we'll have it finalized this coming sunday as to what will happen there and so anyway let's just stand and go right into the word of god i want to speak to you tonight on uh we are witnesses once again uh and uh overcoming the contradiction and uh it'll be self-explanatory very short scripture tonight uh and uh we'll turn in our bibles to hebrews the 12th chapter uh starting with the first verse and um you know it's uh it's always a joy my brothers and sisters um oh i know the other thing i want to mention those that are not here tonight let's just lift them up in prayer i know sister sue's heart she always wants to be here in the house of god and i'm not sure if anybody heard from brother trevor or sister kerry but you know they're faithful so whatever the circumstance be just just lift them all up in prayer amen now starting here in hebrews 12 1 he says wherefore seeing we also so this term we also my brother and sister is speaking into the fact of what is taking place includes us it's not just something speaking of someone else in a different time and place but speaking to us wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and that's not something we normally say amen to saints but the truth of it is we have to admit there are certain little things that beset us certain little things you know the phrase that is often used well they know how to push their button well the devil knows how to push your button but that's not the end of the story the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross now tell me what joy could he have had that's exactly right brother david he said what i'm doing right now will seal the way into eternal life for my people boy i had to bring joy to the heart of our lord even while he's enduring even while he's suffering my brother and sister just because he was god in flesh didn't mean that that pain was not there it did not mean that that literal suffering was not there this is not figurative endured the cross despising the shame and set down on the right hand of the throne of god for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds heavenly father we ask you lord jesus just come bless our time in the word tonight father i pray lord just as it encouraged my heart to study this father i pray tonight it would encourage the hearts of your saints father once again we lift you up ask father lord you just receive our praise lord receive our worship our adoration father to to just lord stand in your presence to base in your word father what a privilege you've given to us we ask this tonight in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated now for the third time over my memory kicks in let's remember sister kristen with her broken foot uh that it would heal quickly for her amen now as we look at this tonight saint time i want you to see wherefore seeing we also are compassed about what's so great a cloud of witnesses and you know when you study these words out you realize it's telling us that uh compassed is the same as uh surrounded and you know here we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses and you know it's easy for us to look back into the ages gone by here we are in the book of hebrews and and you know we can take that and by faith and by faith and by faith and we look at that and heroes of the gospel heroes of faith we look at that and we say boy look at look at them look at this great cloud of witnesses that is surrounding us uh in the ages gone by those that in the lions uh you know uh dan those of you in the coliseums and look at this but my brother and sister we don't really look or really shouldn't focus now this might sound a little counterintuitive but we don't look back in time as it were to say look what they suffered look what they suffered but what we should do is be looking at that the spirit of god was upon them now my brother and sister you cannot be anointed by the spirit of god and truly be suffering sounds counterintuitive don't it because you see god everything he lays upon us just as it was with job he said you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna lay this upon a son or i'm gonna lay it upon a daughter of god and allow this to happen and god's saying i know that no matter what this is uh they have already overcome this because i am the overcomer and so as it was the plan of god i don't know if any of you took the time to to listen to brother timothy's uh sermon down in phoenix uh but i would encourage you to because he is just laying out a very beautiful plan or pattern that you see god's work god's plan everything is perfect and so there is as it were as suffering as the scripture says in this flesh in this current time but you see that is nothing compared to the joy that is to come and so we would say well look what they suffered but look what they received for reward that would be the greatest thing that we could focus on in looking back in the saints of ages gone by is look at the reward that god has given them the overcomers the victorious amen what stories they shared through the word of god through history of the power of god through the ages and all the demonic powers that come up against them my brother and sister someday you know that i think it's the lafontaine sing that song are you she my brother and sister to me is a very inspiring song because truly the word of god shows us that the age that we're living in is not just accumulation my brother and sister of all the spirits of the ages but it's also a magnification so it's not just adding one and adding one but my brother and sister it's a magnification of the spirits of the ages and you can take that and look as it were in a negative sense and say oh my look at this all of these demons released out of the river euphrates and look at all this happening no wait the magnification my brother and sister is the word in you and i there's the true magnification of the day that we're looking at don't look at the evil of the day because god has already promised that you would overcome the evil of this day he's already said that when this evil would rise up the standard he's not out building fence around you saints he's pouring himself into you amen and as he pours himself into you you have more as it were a resource to stand against the spirit of the day amen so we're not out here looking for a fence or a wall to hide behind but we have the word and that is christ himself to stand upon amen now we look at this and know this for a fact i broke a lot of chains in my life uh but look my brother and sister brother brown preaches on this and he says the chain is only as strong as its weakest link right totally makes sense amen now look at this the plan of god i've got wrote here in emphasis the great plan of god was not made to have the link break in this day so god didn't carry his word through all the ages to come to have a failure of the manifestation of the word in this day oh you say oh man we have troubles in our house and we got uptight about this and i'm upset about that and they did this and this looks like this my brother and sister i want you to realize the devil hates you so bad amen he's just gonna irritate now have you guys ever done that i tell you right now just to make a point i was out in the wind a lot today and you know it's just strange you don't think about it at the time but my neck is chopped or chafed enough and just the moving of this collar is enough for me to just want to and that's what the devil is doing to us he's coming an irritation an irritation now look he would want to come on now look at the cleverness that satan uses and i'll just use brother david i'm trying to break this habit saints but it would be that something i would say to brother david or brother david would say to me that there is a small degree of irritant in that and the devil would come and say brother david's irritating me but do you know the real truth of it is it's a devil that's doing the irritating it's not our brother it's not our sister amen it's the devil who's coming as it would be to bring something to bring an irritation now you tell me my brother and sister if you don't respond to irritations amen hallelujah kids shut up most of you don't have a basement but go in the basement amen look we respond to irritations so look i want you to understand this that satan starting with the simplest to the greatest of things wants to break the link now i want you to think about this if we actually think in the deepest recess of our mind that the link can be broken we actually don't have faith in god's word we have to look at this word and declare to the world and we'll come to that in a minute and declare to ourself that i am not the weakest link and the weakest link he will not be broken because this is god himself amen it's not the preacher it's not this it's not that you know now look brother brown says here and behold i stand at the door and knock now look at this i think it's really really good myself i was inspired by it in the book of revelation the third chapter 20th verse i want to read this one verse many of you will read has read the entire book i wish you to read this third chapter anyhow when you go home tonight but the 20th verse reads this behold i stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him come on saints do you see this simplicity amen the simplicity that the devil would try to keep us from if any man amen come on any man not not i'm i'm going to point to you you you and everybody else is out of luck if any man if any man hear my voice can someone say amen you see this is not a casual we bumped into a thing but god already anointing us to hear the voice and if any man hear my voice and open the door oh lord oh lord come on saints it's time for us to push every barrier you say oh brother i'm going to tell on you how was your day oh oh i guess it was pretty good i don't remember what i call my andre he goes are you setting me up no my brother and sister look we're already been set up god's already said i put you in a position and i will maintain you in that position the devil can't knock you off amen so i'll come in and i will sup with him and he with me look that's just a little portion of this great message to the laodicean church so opening are you with me saints just hearing the voice and opening the door the prophet says that's just a little portion but what a life-changing portion what an absolute life-changing portion but you see there's enough there oh see i love this come on my brother and sister this is beautiful but there's enough there if god will just open that up to us then we will have sufficient see just this little portion if we hear and open the door if that is opened to us it will because we as sons and daughters of god it will lead us into everything sufficient but just that revelation that i need to open the door yes sir oh thank you lord that i hear the voice thank you lord that you give function within our bodies within this flesh to sometimes come on saint sometimes the devil has just beat us around we want to keep the door locked we want to find our favorite pillow and we want to find our favorite blanket and we want to find our favorite corner and we want to wrap the blanket around us and lay our head upon that pillow and let the world just pass without us and the devil says huh it works not just on you but humanity but when we catch a revelation what i've got to do a rough day i open the door wider amen the lord said if you'll draw nigh unto me i'll draw nigh unto you and so we open the door wide open and we shout to the heavens lord i'm here and i'm crying out to you amen the song amen tonight lord i'm crying out to you it's my voice lord i'm telling you i'm here and i want to worship you and i want to serve you it's his word and there is many times like in the message sometimes we could preach hours amen but sometimes just 10 minutes it depends on what part of the word that god opens to us i tell you what i liked that quote when i read it you notice the 10 minutes didn't come first hallelujah i didn't even hear an amen out of you [Music] folks so look at this depends on what part of the word see sometimes come on saints and i think we're in an hour and i'm not trying to justify anything don't misunderstand me but this is not the hour we're not living in the hour to go on a spiritual diet this is the hour for us to feed on the word of god to be partakers of it to eat the meat amen nothing against you people that like to be really really healthy but i'm telling you eagles don't eat carrots they don't eat broccoli they eat meat and i'm an eagle is there any eagles here tonight hallelujah now look i hope you don't mind just the moment of humor there but look at this it's the little things that we leave undone trying to do the big things see this is where the devil trips us off we think if our church is full if we've done this we've done this we're doing a great thing but let's do great things saints i'm here to call on you for great things but let's make sure we do all of the little things as we move along and remember brotherly love brotherly kindness is one of those amen so the irritations that come amen we have to remember the devil wants us to not feel that kindred spirit to one another well i'll tell you i say amen the chain is only at its best its best at its weakest link remember no matter how great the other links are never hold no more than its weakest link and the church is the same no stronger than its weakest member we can have great faith saints come ministry that can god answers their prayer they lay hands on the sick and whatever but if the sheep are starving you know it's possible my brother and sister i won't go into the whole story but one time we were in south america and a whole thing that come there and young people coming out of these meetings and their pastor he's the one who confessed this to me he said my young people come and i thought there should be something more from these great meetings what was there and finally he asked one of the spiritual young men in his church he said you know what what what what was the dare and he said i don't know it all went over my head so great deep mysteries but the lambs are starving you see we've got to have a balanced diet amen i love deep things of god i love those things that that have been you might say nuggets dug out but you see if our lambs starve now would you all humor me tonight you want to know who you should be praying for just turn around and start looking come on none of you are doing it i want you to literally look i want it to be sealed when you see things it seals it in your mind that's who you should be praying for well i don't need to pray for them they're real strong are they come on i want to get right down to the bitter end of this sometimes the people you think are the strongest are hurting the most so we intend to pray for this brother or tend to pray for this sister but you should be praying for the body because oh let's put it this way let's have a little poll who's the weakest in this church are you talking about midnight or noon talking right after you fought on the way to church right after you've been irritated you see every one of us has something that is our own personal weak link some of you just look at me that way i just don't know what to think well note to the weakest member and i'm not sure who you are but here is a note to you second corinthians the 12th chapter verses 7 through 9. paul speaking of the corinthians now if you go in his uh speaking to the corinthians when you go to this whole thing you're you're going to with a little insight you're going to see in in the previous chapters you're going to see him talking about uh uh fornication lasciviousness and you talking about my brother and sister this wasn't just some great jubilee of a church these are a people that had to be real believers in that midst but there was issues everyone wants to go to the victorious church that always preaches about we're going in the rapture but somewhere along the line we have to deal with our weakest link and he said and now look what paul's saying right here and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelation paul my he's speaking in a very bold terms lest i i have this incredible revelations that god has given me and in all reality it would be justified that i would be lifted up because none of you were given these revelations they were given to me to bring to you and so therefore i could in a sense be justified to be lifted up as the one that god chose to bring the word to you in this fashion but i love the word but unless i should be exalted and measured through the abundance of the revelation there was given to me a weak link amen a thorn in my flesh in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me we've heard all kinds of the reasons of what this thorn is my brother and sister and whether satan would use an affliction actual sickness or something of the body or affliction of the mind or the spirit paul acknowledges or identifies and says this is a messenger of satan whether it be an affliction that would cause you in the body to not be able to function as you would desire or whether it was something that afflicts your spirit or your whatever your mind it's still a messenger of satan it was not from god and so there he's telling you you know this messenger of satan to buff at me last paul's talking about his own human vanity lest i should be exalted above measure for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me come on saints how many times let's be honest tonight okay where you just open up some of you're looking a little stiff tonight amen look we open up we've prayed about things and we didn't see an answer to it and we prayed about it again we don't see an answer to it we pray about it again we don't see an answer and the messenger of the devil the messenger of satan is there saying god don't care god doesn't hear your prayer this is not this is all nonsense and that messenger is there to continually prick you and put a thorn into your flesh to keep you from finding complete victory in this because you see we can have victory whether the prayers answered the way we thought it should be or not we don't find victory just because god gives us what we want we find victory because the word the voice that we read earlier the voice has been given to us that we can hear it and the revelations of god that come my brother and sister now i'll try to remember to touch on this but those revelations that come to us my brother and sister these are no small revelations you say well i hear the message and as i hear the preaching of the word and as i i grow in in spiritual maturity and physical maturity and these things i see this my brother and sister do you realize that places you as a minority amongst the minority on the face of the earth you are not just one other person hearing this we walk in our circles we call the message my brother and sister and we look around us and there's lots of people but put that number the scripture says against the whole world and it will be nothing you compare what god's done for you he's given you a measure amongst measures my brother and sister but now look at this note to the weakest member for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me lord lord lord and somebody read it with me he said unto come on read it i want you to have the emphasis me don't say oh he was talking to him no read the word put yourself into the word and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee hallelujah speaking to you and i today this is a living word amen not a day gone by my brother and sister but an ever-present help in the time of trouble and ever-present help in this age and he said my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in a very strong bride or maybe to put it in the context of the spirit of the age a headstrong bride have you ever noticed that sometimes things are preached on it there is a absolute immediate immediate backlash from that i remember a brother might even been in this church preached on the dominating female spirit blew the roof off our church knocked the windows out caused people to slam doors and stomp feet i hope that wasn't you that you see what it is when those spirits are called out they don't like it but look this might sound pointed and i'm sorry if it does but it's the truth and i've got to preach it now if i had come along and said you have dominating feel or you or you or you but you see that dominating female spirit doesn't know gender but that spirit don't like it because it thinks it's talking to you because you said female but the woman is always represented in the bible as the church so a dominating church spirit how much time do we have tonight he said look my grace is sufficient for thee my strength is made perfect weakness speaking of our weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmity that the power of christ may rest upon me so no emphasis of these great things i prayed we talk about these things you know you're getting a conversation i can recount to you the places we have been the things we have seen people we have prayed for and saw god come on this scene and deliver my brother and sister not just something it might have changed their life we're talking about homosexuals chained we're talking about people that are ready to murder people change we're talking about people committed to all kinds of things and the power of the word changing them hallelujah i've witnessed this can we say amen it's there we see this we're not talking a historical god and yet he's declaring them i had to be humbled down i had to humble myself you see this didn't happen without it isn't amazing when your temper goes away you know it when your stubborn spirit goes away you know it amen and paul's acknowledging i had these revelations no one none of the apostles had this or these others didn't have this god gave it to me and then god had to humble me to keep me from being lifted up above what i should have been amen well i tell you what my brother and sister i've i'll just pass on yes not this thank you lord he says most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmity i'll tell you what saints i can i can just instill this to you i'm not ashamed to tell you i make mistakes i'm not ashamed to tell you i have to repent every single day i'm not ashamed to tell you that the devil does his very best to turn my thoughts to the side but i tell you what when we come to that place that we realize how weak we are and how great our god is then we can come and actually glory in the fact that without christ i would be nothing without him i would be as it were of whatever man in this city but he has come he has anointed us he has poured his spirit out on us and we can stand and some would say you're kind of boasting you know they said well it sounds like you're boasting on jesus christ brother brown's life i am amen i am oh my look at this that the power of christ that's what i want i'll tell you having a a conversation with a brother you know and i was just sharing with him the things i would desire to see happen in our church and amongst the people my brother and sister and i'm not ashamed to declare i want to see us get more sincere i want to see us get more fervent i want to see us more faithful i want to see us more on fire is that too much to ask would that be a wrong desire or should i pray that we all start being able brothers to wear a nice silk suit and our sisters were the finest of fashion you see the connection my brother and sister now i hope that you can follow this you know if what you can preach to yourself could ever be preached over the pulpit um it would be beautiful yes sir but look at this connection the abundance of revelation he's speaking of this abundance of revelations but look at you today my brother and sister the seals have been opened and you understand it now can that understanding the seals and believing it doesn't mean you could go out here and just spill this all out and quote everything and say what pages are that's not what it's about it's registering down in the heart and soul amen and so you have been given this revelation in this hour of the opening you see the church ages you see the spirits moving through it you see the power of god coming along you see all of this you see how that when it comes to this and the vials and and uh the thunders and all of these things my brother and sister we're not here ignorant why because of revelation and so we can actually make the declaration tonight that we have this connection with the apostle paul of the abundance of revelation and it's here in this abundance of revelation we should never get raised up above like i am more spiritual than they are and they are and they are we should be here humble that the presence of almighty god would rest upon us but let's not step away from the fact that we have revelation that has not been given by the word of god vindicated revelation of the word of god that was not given to most of the world the power of god resting on us amen he's declared the power of god's resting on me can you not say today you share that same connection with the apostle paul that the power of god is resting on you oh hallelujah see these are the same positions god's granted to you today now let's look i need to hurry along i don't want to keep you late and i didn't want to say that earlier because i always say that and then i keep you alone and then some people are starting to look at me like i can't tell the truth i can it's just hard back to hebrews 12 verses 2 and 3 looking unto jesus the author and finish of our face see we never authored this and we'll never finish it but we will be part of the original word we are a part of the original word and we will be a part of the finished word now you don't find finished word as a phraseology but my brother sister you know what i'm talking about this word's going to deliver a people into a rapture and that's not just a rapture the catching away that's just a little bit of the part of it my brother and sister did you know that the rapture is actually like you going into costco and getting a grocery cart you catch it everyday living something going to carry you from here to there the real goal is not rapture my brother and sister the real goal is the presence of almighty god who is our bridegroom his who is everything we are we are the recipients of all of who he is amen so the rapture is just to move us into his presence just like brother branham talked about death harness death to take us into the presence of almighty god and people then lift the rapture up like oh it's all about the rapture all about the rapture is all about the life yes the eternal life so we look to jesus because he's the author of who we are and the finisher of who we are who for the joy was set before him endured the cross oh how it must bring joy to his heart to see his saints worship him so much they even collected up as a sweet saver before him your prayers holding your prayers in his presence that he can just savor oh i love that because you give example to us that we can understand as it would be to take whatever flower that you would love that fragrance and to be able to smell that and realize that's your prayers coming up before the lord moving him smelling them as it were they're praying again how beautiful they're praying again no he doesn't have to open up his ipad and look and see if you're online he knows it because your prayers are coming by oh how beautiful you know i feel bad to admit this but many many years ago when i was working my way back to serving the lord i um i worked with a gentleman i gave him a ride to work every day we were doing construction work in boise and on the way from his house to my house i drove by an intersection in the city of caldwell that had probably here to the back door rose bushes and at the time i didn't seem to think much was wrong with the idea that i was just helping him prune his bushes and you know jerry started to respond to this like okay paul you're a cheapskate where are you getting all these roses from you know i don't know i mean i remember one time i jumped out and i'm cutting a rose off this guy's bush and it turns out this guy was standing right there and i was just like from my wife he went i thought that was like it's okay i just kept right on doing it the street side of that rose bush was pruned right back to the sidewalk hallelujah but look my brother and sister you see something in me my wife a little something from that but then things changed and i didn't go by that rose bush anymore and she didn't get any more roses so my motives probably weren't quite what they should have been but you see we look at this word now the prophet of god and i i pruned this down just to make this statement to you you can find it brother brown says you know abraham had no clout of witnesses as we have today look at the advantage we've got how many of you remember the original internet i'm like what did it just say i decided it was like paul's trying to get on the computer help him but you see moses had nothing to tap into to go back and see a direct correlation but did you know that actually is a strength for him and not a weakness now i'm going to drive this home in just a very personal way and forgive me if it offends you but we have today a a group of people it would be their desire for brother branham to come back and that he would now preach to us to finish this work i want you to just think about this saints i'm not mocking would you want to be brother branham and come back in this day he would have to hide in the wilderness and then somebody would rent a helicopter and try to find him and we'd be calling i was going to buy a car brother brown what should i i was going to do this brother i was going to do that what should i do should i buy a house it's at the end of time should i have a savings account should i invest when you said keep planting your potatoes did you mean literally we as the bride must have potatoes in our backyard oh you think i'm just being funny people have these kind of questions now imagine if brother branham was still here he would be bombarded day and night of the silliness of humanity but instead what did he do he said you know what god's led me to store this up for you let's go back to our original scripture those that hear the voice will be able to discern what he was talking about and it is only that voice my brother and sister that will guide us through laodicea because it was god's voice it was god's voice my brother and sister and god will use whoever he wants to right amen so abraham had no clout of witnesses in his day but god was speaking to him and here we are in this day and the word of god is still speaking and we are here led by this word now my brother and sister look at this now more demons have been loosed in this day according to the scripture and then we look at this and we can say oh my oh my look how filthy this world is but the word of god says more revelation has been released in this day to the bride of christ so why are we looking at the negative when god is flashing the urim thumb right in front of our face saying this is me this is i jehovah in your presence the holy spirit moving in your midst we should be standing up and saying it's right here all i have to do is say lord i need more of you i need more of you i want to understand you lord i want to worship you correctly i want to serve you faithfully but you see that spirit of denomination comes in and we get cold and formal and you say oh brother paul we're not a cold formal church but the spirit's still irritating you i don't care how many demons are loosed in this day the holy ghost is here god himself has been poured out on his people he has opened up his word and just poured it out upon us i don't care how many demons are here because we have been sealed to the day of our redemption and it's not about what the devil's doing but it's about what god's doing oh hallelujah let me just move on i want to be timely now look sometimes we kind of just get a little wavy you know wind blows real hard you ever want to know the power of the wind my brother and sister you just get out where there's no houses you get out where there's no trees you just get out where it's just nothing but you and the grasslands and you will see the wind is such an incredibly powerful thing and it's subject to the holy ghost so all the power of the wind is still subject now look at this this is the third time i am coming to you and the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established i told you before and foretell you as if i were present the second time and being absent now i write to them which or heretofore have sinned pretty straightforward isn't it everybody's sinner i'm writing a letter to you and to all rather oh we're all included that if i come again praise the lord praise the lord how many want the apostle paul to come and preach to us how many of us are willing to bring our band-aids to church because he says i'm not going to spare you i'm going to tell you the truth whether you like it or not since ye seek proof of christ speaking in me which to you word is not weak but is mighty in you i say amen to that the word of god in me is not weak for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of god so for we also are weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of god toward you amen i'm telling you my brother and sister that same power that spoke to paul that anointed him to declare i have great revelation i have a great position in jesus christ in the word of god amen that same power is loosed on you and i when was the last time that came from your mouth that's right come on when was the last time that you stood even in private and said i am the power of god on the earth today oh whoa whoa whoa brother paul that's way far out there that's way out far that's too far well it has to be either that or god gave a watered-down version of himself to you who's going to claim that one anybody can lift a hand and claim the watered-down version of christ in you no sir so we ought to be looking at this it is a powerful two-edged sword that is inside of me it's living in me and it's keeping my life clean and it's keeping the word clean you know saints i'm deviating just a moment just spare me a little you know no nicolas and spirit ever come and conquered a church i don't care how nicolaitan that preacher is how dominating he is he never conquered the church until you let him just as satan cannot overpower you until you let him come on saints amen i love that for we also are weak in him but we shall live with him we're not living with some other husband come on saints i know this ties into a lot of things i've been just studying all over the map but look we're not living with another husband we have not taken another husband in the house of god and embraced it and give our vow to live with him in better and worse no i already made that vow to one and he is my husband and i am his bride and i will not deviate from good day to bad day to whatever it is because my vow was to him and him alone hallelujah by the power of god toward you examine yourselves right right along the lines of communion examine yourselves whether you be in the faith prove your own selves i should just quit the service right now and just give us all time to sit here and examine ourselves but you see that's our real true job saints not to have the preacher come on it's not to have the preacher have to go oh my here we are again i have to go out here and deal with you sean no that's not what it's about that's what the holy ghost is about that's what the spirit of god comes down reaches into a young man or young woman's heart an old man or old woman and says you didn't do right there and something in us has already been made and proven that we can respond to that because remember if he chastens you and you rebuke it now i don't like to speak these words especially for their young people but i'm not going to shirk from the word of god if we step back or will not receive correction we're bastard born that don't describe me i hold i know who my father is i know who my father is amen and forgive me for saying that for the children but still it is the truth amen so examine yourselves be in the faith prove your own selves know ye not your own selves how that jesus christ [Music] some of you probably wouldn't like me to really i've been practicing my dancing hallelujah i'd be pretty boring dancing but i'll tell you what my brother sister i get in my office sometimes and i just get so excited in there i ain't got much room you know it's just a little narrow thing i just stand in there oh lord thank you thank you how do you like my how do you like my dance move saints hallelujah but i'm going to let the lord know i'm worshiping him i'm let the lord know lord i love you lord i'm so excited my heart is leaping within me lord because you see know ye not your own selves how that jesus christ is in you now who is jesus christ god in the flesh hallelujah oh and the holy spirit and all things were created by him and for him oh brother brown says it's all the same amen one except you be re reprobates but look now he doesn't say now i want you to kind of figure out you know and hope that you're not but he says i trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobate in other words the knowledge that we're not reprobates is already here he just wants you to see it amen hallelujah comes back to knowing who we are now let me hurry along here somebody's stealing the time again now look speaking in the early verse there two or three witnesses shall every word be established and we use that as a format you might say of of establishing the scriptures full of that if you bring in accusation against a brother you know and these kind of things but my brother sister i hope you can see where i'm coming from on this we look at this now two or three witness shall every word be established speaking the word to others right what are you doing you're establishing the word you're speaking the word to others you speak the word to one another are you following me and you speak the word back to god himself you know what the lord likes to hear you he likes to hear you lord i believe your word lord you're beautiful lord i love you lord i thank you for the blood lord he likes to hear you what are you doing saints every time you speak that you're establishing that you're anchoring it more and more firm and you know if you do it in the right way you can speak that to neighbors and friends and co-workers and family and you see what it is is the words being established as you speak it you know i don't remember the man who made this statement but a a a brother shared this with me the other day and he said uh whoever it was and i don't remember now wished i could but he says you know this person which goes back a long ways he said the more outrageous the lie the more people will believe it somebody saints are you with me somebody's got to be establishing the truth satan has this outrageous lie that the earth just popped out of nowhere and we all just come from moss ponds come methane gas that somehow just bang and here you are like the little joke says no no honey your dad's side is not true your dad's speaking about his side the family god created us see my brother and sister the more outrageous the lie the more people will believe it and so you look at this and you recognize what satan is trying to do he's trying to get us all to come to such a lackadaisical place in the word that we actually would say okay well i don't know it could be this it could be that but here again i take you back to the quote where the prophet of god said look some say he's coming on a cloud some say he's coming on a white horse but just so you believe he is coming and then let god manifest his own word you won't miss it if you believe he's coming now look at this we're part of the establishment of the word did i get that do i need to go back and drive over that again or did i make that clear enough we are part of the establishment of the word in this hour it wasn't for prophet to come his voice to go on to magnetic tape or whatever it is and then we just mail tapes all over the world my brother and sister the word says there'll be a living epistle upon the earth red of all men amen that's you and i we're here in the establishment of the word for our age now look at this revelation 10 7. let's put that up there brother amen but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished now some people say this word should leaves a possibility that it's not entire but you know the word should is also a command not a maybe not an if not a possibility but actually a command the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servant the prophet so we look at this and the word is very clear that it's in the days of the voice of the seventh angel now my brother and sister is this message prophetic did you know a prophetic word is making this book edible to the bride amen otherwise we don't know otherwise we can't deal with but a prophetic word come down and broke it down and prepared it and then delivered it to us and then i hope you don't misunderstand my use of this word enticed us or attracted what word you want to use they kind of interchange to eat it well praise the lord throw brother george under the bus i was talking to brother george about a certain circumstance one day and he said i got one better than that paul and i was like oh yeah and they started to tell me how this person they've had like 25 years of ties hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars in a bank account and when brother branham comes back he's going to give it to him in cash does that fulfill the word of god no no man hadn't been hadn't darkened the door of a church in years when brother branham preached on the queen of sheba what did he say the people wouldn't even cross the street to go to church but the queen of sheba would rise up in that day to judge them see we have to put this all together saints we can't isolate and say this is what i think and this is what i think we have to have a balanced word of god we have to come and you know what happens when you eat a little of the book you get a little benefit of the book when you eat a little more of the book you get a little more benefit of the book when you eat the whole book you get the benefit of the whole book amen what was the prophet trying to do did he go in here and say now i only want you to read right here i want you to read right here i want you to skip that read this right no what'd he do he told us you pick your bible up you read your bible you pray over when you read your bible and you continually every day read your bible what was he doing knowing as he by prophetic word prepared the book to make it edible to you when you ate it now i like to apply i hope you don't mind just a tad bit of humor i kind of apply that same principle to a piece of pie amen i see people they cut off the end of the pie they nibble off one edge of it just leave the rest of the pie i'm sorry you just left the whole benefit of getting that piece of pie amen and that's why i'm a firm believer if there's still pie left there to eat it should be eaten because when you take the book don't stop don't stop my brother and sister keep eating the book and the more you eat of the book the more you want to eat of the book and people say well i don't know i'm just not inspired you know going to church the message just don't inspire me anymore i want to know what kind of appetite you've got i don't say that rudely i just say it as a fact now look my brothers and sisters we're not to have a rear view uh uh uh a rear view view of the word of god right amen we are the witnesses do you realize there's been a transformation we preach of this cloud of witnesses and we go back in our bible we talk about abraham and we talk about all of these others coming up through the new testament but do you realize my brother and sister the prophet of god shows us clearly from the scripture he breaks it down and makes it edible for us to realize that when he when we read the scripture in revelation that the spirit and the bride say come the prophet of god said the bride would be the final voice to the final age you realize oh some people got us now now we're going to be here the bride and we're going to be speaking and then the spirit's going to come down and confirm this and call them also you realize my brother and sister the prophet of god said it'd be the spirit of christ in you calling the rapture it will be you calling the rapture not god saying hey it wraps your time it will be a bride so filled with him so desirous of him so looking to him that she is going to cry out and she's going to draw the rapture to her so when the spirit and the bride say come there's not another voice going to show up to call the people it's the same voice saints and that voice is in you oh it's not going to be me walking out on a street corner saying come rapture come but it will be sons and daughters of god so desirous of being a true witness for jesus christ that their life will change the world around them can someone say that i want that lord hallelujah see we're witnesses that are living the word out today amen we can look back to all those um days gone by we can look back even to brother branham's life and f f baldsworth and others we can look back to that my brother and sister that won't change your neighbor that's got a blood clot what will change that neighbor is to see people that registers in that man or that family's heart that these are real christians and i have confidence in them they said they'd pray for me they'll ask their church to pray for me i see the manifestation of god in them they've got something our family don't got and if they hear that voice they won't be able to stop till they eat the book we won't have to force the book on them come on you know what'll happen we are being brought to a place that we are overcoming the contradiction of our age we're no longer in contradiction with our lord jesus christ we're coming in one with him and when his spirit moves upon us we respond i remember one time this man was kind of debating this other man and one was i don't know he's atheist or agnostic or whatever and uh he said the problem i have with you christians you're just a bunch of parrots you're just a bunch of puppets and he said yes sir and the guy's like you agree and he goes yes sir i agree when the holy spirit pulls the strings of my heart i respond and the guy's like i knew it bunch of puppets then the guy just looked in my face and says i actually would like to meet who's pulling your strength but i think i know and i really don't want to meet him oh my my my mind you see we were called you see you know what you're doing saints sister ruth if you would come you're showing the world that the word can overcome the contradiction of our heaven amen your life has now become the witness amen that the word of god is overcoming this world oh can someone say thank you lord thank you lord hallelujah my brother and sister i started as it were in this flesh is a contradiction to god and now i'm a contradiction to laodicea i am now what is at odds with the spirit of laodicea you wonder why you'll meet people and they just won't like you well i tell you what my brother and sister the spirit on them recognizes the spirit on you and that devil no matter where he's at and how many people he's got with him you know he goes around with a whole crowd right we're good with just our lord jesus christ the devil he brings crowds and i won't get into it we'll know the sermon they're they're different spirits lying spirits and other things all these spirits and he's got to bring all of these there's only one holy spirit amen the devil's got just dozens and dozens of spirits but just one holy spirit hallelujah hallelujah let's just stand and worship the lord saints i hope this i hope it encourages you as much as it encouraged me i tell you i'm just looking at this and just thankful to realize that god has come and just moved through our day and you know realized that we have been compassed about just with the holy spirit let me just close with this i want to make sure i got a good damper on the service when we close it [Music] y'all look at me i am what i am right and if you all be honest write down to our young people and say yeah i see brother paul this and i see this and this and this [Music] we see saints what we're looking for [Music] we don't deny our faults i was in arizona and that's what i want to share with you lovely brother just a really lovely brother him and his wife just very special people he told me he said brother paul he said when i go to church i go everywhere else i'm amongst the believers amongst the saints he said i i take these passes with me and when someone does something or says something maybe i find it offensive or i don't think it's quite right he said i just pull one of the passes out he said it's really just taking place in my mind i give him a pass because it's by god's grace i've been given a pass it's by the grace of our lord jesus christ and he said you know brother paul he said it just has i thought this was good it wasn't like it changed anybody else he said it's just done so much for me i go through life and it's like oh about no i gave him a pass oh about this deal no i gave him a pass he actually shared a real life story with real life names [Music] and i thought that's beautiful that's beautiful because the brother he was sharing about i know well and he said sometimes you know he just has this certain thing and i'm like yep he does and he said i just give him a pass instead of remembering instead of holding it against him instead of making a big fuss over it i was like yup that's a brother that might be his thorn and i'm going to stand up and say well that come on stop i hope you don't mind but maybe we need to find the mirror look at our own thorn [Music] spiritually saints give the pass pray for them because you see we are not a counter addiction to our lord jesus christ and the saints of this body are not a contradiction to our lord jesus christ and we are not a contradiction to one another amen have grace have mercy oh hallelujah hallelujah i'd like to sing the song you know sometimes you know when we're studying we just have certain songs we find ourselves singing i'd like brother jason just come help me kind of got a raspy voice here irritated but uh let's sing that song break every chain amen i'll tell you what that's what i'm desiring tonight saints i'm desiring for the word of the lord to come down in my life in your life and everything that satan's tried to do to bind lord break that chain amen that we can walk free

not to future tense but past tense hallelujah not by power not by might but my spirit saith the lord hallelujah [Music] [Music] is this mountain shall be [Music] this mountain shall be removed but by my spirit but by my spirits this mountain shall be removed this mountain shall be removed this mountain can be removed by my spirit oh can't you see why i'm happy i've accepting the word of the lord that why the bride is happy oh can't you see why the bride's happy [Applause] she's accepted [Music] [Music] i want to just lay this in before we sing one last little for us can't you see saints how than through a prophetic message it made this word of god edible to you and i no longer a mystery look at it thousands and thousands of belief systems all discerning the word of god differently and god loved us so much through the words of a prophet he comes down lays this word out breaks it up made it edible to you and i no longer theologians no longer religious schools no longer studying out
