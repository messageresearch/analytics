[28:59] Hell to the sides of the pit let's bow
[29:02] our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we
[29:05] are so happy to be in your house tonight
[29:07] Lord we we love the word and we we want
[29:10] we ask that you'd speak to us Lord
[29:13] father we we've all come Lord we all
[29:15] have uh different lives that we each
[29:18] live and they're intertwined and they're
[29:20] connected in some way but we all have
[29:23] those things in our hearts that we need
[29:24] answers to Lord we all have those things
[29:27] things where we need strengthening Lord
[29:29] the areas of our life those those parts
[29:31] that may be only shared between the
[29:33] husband and wife of of strengthening
[29:35] needed Lord and but God you you you are
[29:37] there always you're you're there in the
[29:39] kitchen late at night you're there in
[29:41] the bedroom late at night you're
[29:42] listening you're hearing us as we talk
[29:45] as we express ourselves as in prayer or
[29:48] or to each other Lord you're paying
[29:51] attention so God tonight this is a if we
[29:54] could take the Liberty to say a
[29:55] compilation father of of the past few
[29:58] days Lord you've come maybe the past few
[30:00] weeks months years you've come to say
[30:02] something tonight help us to listen Lord
[30:05] help us not to interject our own ideas
[30:07] our own opinions father from the pulpit
[30:10] or from the Pew Lord but let us be open
[30:12] with our hearts laid out before you God
[30:16] that you could lift us to a higher place
[30:18] tonight we ask in Jesus Christ's name we
[30:20] pray amen you may be seated
[30:23] tonight I'd like to take the the uh
[30:27] thought tonight on the battle of the
[30:29] twins with the subtitle of origin of sin
[30:33] and righteousness this started out as uh
[30:37] being titled the origin of sin but it
[30:39] just sounded too dark I just couldn't
[30:41] couldn't leave it that way but we're
[30:43] going to look we're going to go back and
[30:45] and and we're going to look at a few
[30:46] things here tonight so we read in Isaiah
[30:50] um how where Lucifer he was uh the son
[30:53] of the morning and he was in heaven he
[30:55] was with the angels at that point point
[30:57] in in time or at that
[31:00] point um you see that that uh Lucifer
[31:04] got the idea um that he wanted to be
[31:07] lifted up above uh God and he wanted to
[31:11] take God's position you know he he
[31:13] thought he could do a better job and so
[31:16] the problem is is that nobody can be God
[31:18] but God and um that's a fundamental
[31:22] truth that we even as Believers
[31:24] sometimes forget because we we start to
[31:26] take matters in our own hands and and we
[31:28] we we start to try to fix situations and
[31:31] as soon as a human tries to fix a
[31:34] spiritual situation um it gets pretty
[31:36] messy uh things don't work out the way
[31:39] that we want them to and next thing you
[31:41] know we're going back to God and saying
[31:43] God look I'm sorry I made this aess can
[31:46] you please help me clean it up and much
[31:49] better would it have been if we started
[31:51] there but as we do that a few times or
[31:54] few dozen times depending on the type of
[31:56] learner you are
[31:57] um you come to the place where you stop
[31:59] you say Lord I need your help right now
[32:01] I need you to come and show me the next
[32:03] step to take and sometimes he doesn't
[32:05] actually give us an answer he leads us
[32:07] to a scripture but that is an
[32:09] answer sometimes in devotions we read a
[32:12] chapter we read a story and God speaks
[32:14] to us and we say oh my situation aligns
[32:17] with this
[32:20] but the fact of the matter is God is God
[32:24] okay and when we try to take his place
[32:26] we lose out
[32:27] but that's not our topic tonight our
[32:29] topic is the Battle of the twins so I
[32:31] want to I I want to look at at the
[32:32] origin of sin and righteousness I don't
[32:34] know maybe we'll have another one on the
[32:36] Battle of twins some point I have no
[32:38] idea but we left ourselves an out um 1
[32:41] Timothy 2:14 uh the scripture say and
[32:44] Adam was not deceived but the woman
[32:47] being deceived was in the transgression
[32:50] now I know we are all very familiar with
[32:53] this but when when something is someone
[32:55] is deceived they genuinely do not know
[32:58] that they are doing wrong they think
[33:00] they are doing right they are deceived
[33:01] they are completely blinded to their
[33:04] actions now we could say and say we
[33:07] could take the part and say well you
[33:08] know Eve I mean she was deceived she
[33:10] thought she was doing the right thing um
[33:13] but she knew she was taking the wrong
[33:17] steps on her way to deception so there
[33:20] was a point in time where she she knew
[33:22] hey this is not the right place to be
[33:25] where was Adam
[33:27] why wasn't she with Adam there's many
[33:29] different things we could we could take
[33:31] the Liberty to go into but the fact of
[33:34] it the fact is that she was where she
[33:36] shouldn't have
[33:39] been now the Bible says there was two
[33:41] trees in the garden The Garden of the
[33:43] knowledge of Good and Evil and the the
[33:45] excuse me the tree of the knowledge of
[33:46] good and evil or the tree of life
[33:49] and God said stay away from that tree
[33:52] now we know being from the word of God
[33:55] and from the the message that that we've
[33:57] been given that that that that that was
[34:00] the serpent was a man like you know you
[34:03] and I but he just was a little bit
[34:05] different and
[34:08] um that the fall was Eve had sex with
[34:12] the serpent and so this tree its
[34:16] location how that all played out we're
[34:19] not exactly sure but we do know there
[34:20] was this thing they needed to stay away
[34:22] from so she was over there she went to
[34:25] it it didn't go to her she went to it
[34:28] and she was having this conversation so
[34:30] she was deceived but there was a step
[34:32] along the way that she where where a
[34:34] point where she could have turned and so
[34:38] um there was a scripture in my head and
[34:40] it slipped away but the so this the
[34:42] reason I dropped this in here is because
[34:43] Adam wasn't deceived Eve was deceived
[34:47] but what led up to that and and and what
[34:51] what could have Eve have done
[34:52] differently I mean we could go all kinds
[34:54] of different
[34:55] directions of what she could could have
[34:57] done differently but she had a choice
[34:59] that she had to make she had a choice so
[35:02] the deception came based on her choice
[35:05] okay now in in the sermon uh and this
[35:09] also sets our point this is the
[35:11] beginning right this is where it all
[35:13] happened right here in this scripture
[35:15] and uh in the Garden of Eden in this
[35:17] quote here the greatest battle ever
[35:19] fought brother B says this F this great
[35:22] first battle that was ever fought began
[35:24] in heaven when Michael and his angels
[35:26] fought against Lucifer and his angels it
[35:29] first started the first battle was in
[35:31] heaven so sin did not originate on Earth
[35:34] it originated in heaven and this is kind
[35:37] of what started me I don't know how long
[35:39] ago uh I put this thought down with this
[35:41] quote because
[35:43] um I got to this quote because I heard
[35:46] somebody say talking about something and
[35:49] they say well you know the origins of
[35:52] that is from the Pentecostal church back
[35:54] in the four uh 50 60 somewhere in there
[35:58] and and at the moment that I heard that
[36:00] it stumbled me for a minute because I
[36:02] thought well they're right and but I
[36:04] thought but it doesn't it doesn't ring
[36:06] true and I know some of you are sitting
[36:08] there and you're thinking wow I thought
[36:10] brother Chris had a much better head on
[36:12] his shoulders but um it took me a minute
[36:15] I had to digest that that's the way I am
[36:17] a lot of times I got to go back and
[36:19] think about something later on all alone
[36:21] without the the pressure of a
[36:22] conversation and and I began to ponder
[36:25] on this and I thought why I know this
[36:27] isn't true but but why what what is the
[36:30] answer to this and and I begin to look
[36:33] and and at the and and this I came
[36:35] across this quote and I I thought isn't
[36:37] that interesting of course sin
[36:39] originated in heaven because the devil
[36:41] can't create
[36:43] anything he's a
[36:45] perverter he did not
[36:47] create so he didn't he he couldn't
[36:50] create Sin Sin had to originate in
[36:54] heaven and the definition of sin is
[36:57] unbelief so you can you hear Brother B
[37:00] when he preaches and he says this
[37:02] there's like there's a halt in the
[37:04] congregation and because we think of sin
[37:07] and we think of as as as you know going
[37:09] down to the grocery store and stealing
[37:12] something from the shell that's a sin or
[37:13] or saying a lie or or checking out a
[37:16] woman or checking out a guy right it's
[37:18] you're you're you're uh we that is sin
[37:22] but sin is unbelief and so if we took
[37:26] this all the way back and we begin to
[37:28] unpack the origin of sin and the origin
[37:30] of
[37:35] righteousness we're going to come to
[37:37] something I want you to just hold on
[37:38] because I know I I was studying this out
[37:40] and I thought you know what I might lose
[37:43] them for just a minute but just hear me
[37:45] out okay so faith is righteousness now
[37:48] in this quote here SP says um but but
[37:52] what is sin it's unbelief okay so sin is
[37:55] unbelief so what what's the opposite of
[37:58] unbelief belief he says what is
[38:01] righteousness Faith so faith is
[38:03] believing right all things are possible
[38:06] or nothing is impossible to God all you
[38:08] have to do is have faith right brother
[38:10] brandom said that many many many many
[38:12] times people will come to the line he
[38:14] said look you got to have the faith so
[38:16] if sin is unbelief then the opposite of
[38:19] sin is
[38:20] belief it's faith faith is righteousness
[38:24] he says and sin is only right
[38:26] righteousness perverted so sin wasn't
[38:29] created sin was righteousness falling
[38:33] from its
[38:35] position okay so sin is a byproduct of
[38:39] something it's a byproduct of unbelief
[38:42] so sin is unbelief so sin wasn't created
[38:45] sin happened okay sin happened because
[38:50] Lucifer had the idea that he could be
[38:54] God if Lucifer thought he he could be
[38:57] God now he's the origin of sin okay so
[38:59] we start with him if Lucifer thought he
[39:02] could be God somewhere in his
[39:03] relationship with God he forgot who God
[39:06] was he he lost faith in God's
[39:11] leadership he lost trust in God's
[39:13] leadership because he said I can do it
[39:16] better if he trusted God completely for
[39:20] God to make the decision as a pastor of
[39:22] Heaven he wouldn't have challenged his
[39:24] position so there was a lack of faith so
[39:29] you see you cannot have sin you cannot
[39:32] have unbelief if you have
[39:36] faith so we say all the time well we got
[39:39] to get rid of Sin Sin isn't something
[39:41] you have to get rid of sin is a lack of
[39:45] something sin is not a substance you can
[39:48] say well yeah I can go down and sin sin
[39:51] down that wherever I mean the bar I'm
[39:52] sinning that's but it's not a substance
[39:54] because sin is unbelief unbelief is the
[39:57] opposite of faith faith is light
[39:59] unbelief and fear is Darkness you can't
[40:02] grab a hold of Darkness but you can grab
[40:03] a hold of light so sin is because you're
[40:07] lacking something so you say well the
[40:09] world came into existence Adam and Eve
[40:11] fell in the Garden of Eden I'm trying to
[40:13] slow myself down part of that is keeping
[40:15] the coat on helps so so sin in the
[40:19] Garden of Eden is where where it all
[40:21] started right so what happened Eve moved
[40:23] out of her position
[40:27] and so did Adam Adam said sure I'll eat
[40:30] the fruit he didn't want to lose Eve
[40:32] beautiful story beautiful type of
[40:35] Christ so he moved from his position God
[40:38] had told him this this is where you
[40:40] stand this is what you do you see there
[40:43] one of one of the definitions of
[40:44] paradise is a Walled Garden so as a
[40:47] father my position in the home is is to
[40:50] build this wall around my family
[40:52] economics uh food shelter all of that
[40:55] trust uh and I make this stable position
[40:58] with by the grace of God and I must
[41:01] maintain those walls around my family so
[41:04] that inside of there there's a paradise
[41:06] they can they can play they don't have
[41:08] to worry about somebody kicking the door
[41:09] down and taking us out or or doing some
[41:11] whatever it is they have trust they have
[41:13] faith so they can play all day long I
[41:17] mean they got chores and school and
[41:19] things but that's a part of their
[41:20] development and that is what develops
[41:22] them into stable adults God did the same
[41:25] God do the same thing he has a our
[41:28] pastor preached on the laws of God he
[41:29] has a parameter he has a wall that walls
[41:32] that he has built around us and they're
[41:34] not for our harm and they're not
[41:36] legalistic you don't take a legalistic
[41:38] approach and say well God says I can't
[41:39] do this and I can't do that look
[41:41] sometimes my kids as much as I love them
[41:44] they come to the wall sometimes and I
[41:46] and there's discipline and there's a
[41:48] reminder that's the wall stay over there
[41:50] in the garden okay so kids test the
[41:54] boundaries and they test test the
[41:56] boundaries because they want to know are
[41:58] do will they hold so when they test the
[42:01] boundaries you better be ready to hold
[42:03] them because if they don't hold they'll
[42:06] push back and they'll go even farther
[42:08] next time and they will feel unstable
[42:10] Paradise is no longer existence because
[42:13] they can just go and do whatever they
[42:14] want now God builds this position he he
[42:18] builds this place around us and then we
[42:20] get the we we have the word of God and
[42:22] we have all of these things and and God
[42:25] this walk
[42:26] built around us it's we call it a hedge
[42:29] okay so God let the devil in to to
[42:32] attack job God put the tree of the
[42:34] knowledge of Good and Evil in the garden
[42:36] you think well okay why would God put
[42:38] evil in
[42:42] Paradise you it had to be
[42:45] present if in this paradise that wasn't
[42:49] there Adam and Eve would not have a
[42:52] choice there always has to be a choice
[42:56] voice you see your flesh that's why your
[42:58] flesh you know we need to stop saying
[43:01] well I I can't wait to drop this robe of
[43:03] Flesh and and and I can't this flesh and
[43:05] this flesh we need to stop looking at it
[43:07] like that look the flesh is necessary
[43:09] for your
[43:10] Perfection you need it your flesh is
[43:14] chaos okay it's out of control right we
[43:17] all know when that person Cuts us off in
[43:19] traffic and we honk the horn we just we
[43:21] lost it what happened chaos our flesh is
[43:24] chaos what keeps chaos
[43:28] confined is
[43:30] order Order and Chaos you have to you
[43:34] chaos is undefined without order order
[43:37] is undefined without chaos there's no
[43:40] reason to Define order if there's no
[43:42] chaos you wouldn't even have the word
[43:43] because there's there has to be the
[43:45] opposite so you can't even have faith
[43:48] would be undefined without
[43:51] sin a god A Healer would be
[43:54] undefined without something to
[43:57] heal so that's why God let the allowed
[44:01] the Garden of Eden to unfold you see
[44:03] predestination is God looking down
[44:05] through time and seeing the choice
[44:08] you're going to make he didn't force you
[44:11] to make the decision he saw the choices
[44:13] you would make and predestination goes
[44:15] back to for knowledge and for knowledge
[44:17] goes back to forget the last one but
[44:21] that's what it is you look ahead God saw
[44:22] ahead in time God saw what you would
[44:23] choose so God knew what Adam and Eve
[44:25] would do but he put it there because now
[44:28] their Exile from the garden is their
[44:30] choice
[44:32] okay and their return back to God is
[44:36] their
[44:38] choice so they're worshiping God because
[44:41] they want
[44:44] to God already had people who worshiped
[44:46] him because they had to they're called
[44:50] Angels why some of them fell and some of
[44:52] them didn't that's God's answer I don't
[44:55] know but Angels the cherubs they don't
[44:58] have a choice they got to worship they
[45:00] got two you know two Wings on the top
[45:02] and two Wings on their feet or whatever
[45:03] however it goes you forgive me for
[45:04] butchering it but they they you know
[45:06] holy holy that's all they do they have
[45:09] to do that that that doesn't make God
[45:12] God but you worshiping God by
[45:17] choice completes him so it's absolutely
[45:22] necessary to the equation of redemption
[45:25] that your flesh is
[45:28] present
[45:30] okay so faith is the opposite of sin or
[45:34] righteousness faith is
[45:36] righteousness now in in and for further
[45:39] clarification on faith being
[45:40] righteousness we have the scripture in
[45:42] Romans 4: 20-2 and this is talking about
[45:45] Abraham and it says he staggered not at
[45:48] the promise of God through unbelief
[45:50] through sin unel it we' we've defined
[45:52] that he staggered not the promise of God
[45:54] through sin but was strong in
[45:56] righteousness strong in faith giving
[45:58] glory to God and being fully persuaded
[46:01] that what he had promised he was able
[46:04] also to perform so faith in the word
[46:07] faith in what God gave him so because of
[46:10] this Faith he was strong in faith there
[46:13] was no room for unbelief no room for sin
[46:16] okay and therefore it was imputed to him
[46:20] for
[46:21] righteousness so his faith in the
[46:24] promise was his righteousness this is
[46:27] where this comes from because everything
[46:28] brother B preaches goes back to
[46:29] scripture now it was not written for his
[46:31] sake alone that it was imputed to him so
[46:34] it wasn't just for him that it was
[46:35] written that his faith in God's promise
[46:39] made him righteous It Was Written Paul
[46:42] says for us as well he says for us also
[46:45] to whom it shall be imputed if we
[46:47] believe on him that raised up Jesus our
[46:50] lord from the dead who was delivered for
[46:53] our offenses and was raised again for
[46:55] our our
[46:57] justification sanctification
[46:59] justification right it's all right there
[47:01] you see this is where people go off the
[47:03] rails and they say well you just got to
[47:04] believe if you truly believe if you
[47:06] truly believe in God you would dis you
[47:10] would come to the revelation of water
[47:12] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ
[47:14] believing believing isn't just believing
[47:18] isn't just
[47:19] saying um yeah God's
[47:23] real you know we were created by God
[47:26] fundamentally I really believe this
[47:28] everybody deep down inside believes in
[47:30] God I don't see how you
[47:33] couldn't they all know right you you put
[47:36] that you put a gun to some agnostics
[47:38] head what's he going to do cry for
[47:41] Mercy he's not going to say yes hell I'm
[47:43] coming for you right there's something
[47:46] lodged down deep inside of these people
[47:48] where they
[47:49] know good and what good and bad and you
[47:52] see people debate this all the time well
[47:54] how do we get morals what's good and bad
[47:55] bad where does that even come from right
[47:57] well it's just a set of laws that we all
[47:58] determin on say well if you all decided
[47:59] to be Nazis does that make it right the
[48:02] answer is no correct so God
[48:04] fundamentally we're all based upon this
[48:06] idea that God exists so this isn't a
[48:09] debate
[48:12] but we believe on God therefore true
[48:16] faith in God it brings you to something
[48:19] now Hebrews 11 vers1 very familiar
[48:22] scripture now Faith is the substance of
[48:24] things hoped for the evidence of things
[48:26] not seeing so faith is a substance now
[48:30] we've covered this before but what I
[48:31] wanted to what I wanted to look at is
[48:34] the the opposite of this because if you
[48:37] can if you can ever catch the Revelation
[48:41] that sin isn't the substance that sin
[48:44] isn't isn't isn't a thing now sin is is
[48:47] something you can do but it's not a
[48:48] thing if you can never catch that then
[48:50] the antidote to sin in your life now
[48:53] we're not Sinners we're saved God has
[48:55] saved us so so where there's no sins
[48:57] imputed to us but we have sins right we
[48:59] make mistakes if we can ever realize
[49:01] when we come to a place where we
[49:03] struggling with something and we can
[49:06] realize that that something is not of
[49:09] substance but it is a lack of
[49:13] something we will address the situation
[49:16] much
[49:18] differently that is why it's so
[49:20] important for the token to be applied
[49:22] into your home because then there's no
[49:25] room
[49:26] for unbelief there's no room for
[49:30] sin now you have to constantly keep a
[49:33] watchful
[49:34] lie so falling from position now there's
[49:38] a man very famous man in the Bible by
[49:40] the name of David and he did something
[49:42] completely terrible he took a man's wife
[49:44] and then he murdered the man but he was
[49:46] go a man after God's Own
[49:48] Heart and it came to pass after the year
[49:50] was expired at the time when kings go
[49:52] forth to battle that David sent joab and
[49:55] his servants with him and all Israel
[49:58] they destroyed Now Catch key in on this
[50:01] this was the time when the Kings not the
[50:04] generals the Kings go forth to battle
[50:08] and David sent joab and his servants
[50:10] with him and all Israel and they
[50:11] destroyed the children of am Ammon and
[50:13] besieged rabah but David carried still
[50:17] at Jerusalem so there's a little there's
[50:19] a little clue in there that is that
[50:22] David was supposed to be out to war
[50:27] so first off David just like Eve just
[50:30] like Lucifer out of their
[50:35] position this is why brother bam says if
[50:38] the bride could ever realize who she um
[50:41] this is why he says position is labors
[50:44] on how important position is because to
[50:46] be in your
[50:49] position is to be in a in a in a place
[50:52] where there's
[50:54] Faith righteous
[50:56] which is the rebuttal of sin it it's the
[51:01] it's what keeps sin back okay and when
[51:05] you get filled with the Holy Spirit
[51:07] that's an everlasting
[51:09] Faith right but still we we have things
[51:12] that we have to deal with so that's the
[51:15] beginning right you get saved you get
[51:17] the Holy Ghost that's the beginning now
[51:19] sin you're no longer a sinner you're
[51:21] clean you're a Son of God but you have
[51:24] sins and we need to get rid of those
[51:26] right we need to keep getting rid of
[51:27] those keep keep the keep the house clean
[51:30] and keep pressing on and that is
[51:33] why well I don't want to get off too off
[51:36] topic and it came to pass in an evening
[51:38] tie that David arose from off his bed
[51:40] and walked upon the roof of the King's
[51:41] house and from the roof he saw a woman
[51:43] washing herself and the woman was very
[51:45] beautiful to look upon and David sent
[51:48] and inquired after the woman and one
[51:49] said is not this BBA the daughter of el
[51:52] the wife of Uriah the hittite
[51:56] the message of his grace of Grace how
[51:58] could David take uriah's wife the
[52:00] beautiful bath Sheba when he had 500 of
[52:02] his
[52:03] own good question but seeing her taking
[52:07] a bath now see imagination right begin
[52:10] to work he didn't have the strength to
[52:13] fight what he saw so he entertained it
[52:17] till it manifested in adultery but seen
[52:19] her taking a bath and there's the
[52:21] negligence now she just forgot to pull
[52:24] the shades down when she was taking her
[52:26] bath and know that the that King made a
[52:29] trip there by there every day down over
[52:31] that wall so fault on both sides right
[52:36] husbands is out fighting the battle
[52:38] and here you
[52:40] go so both out of their position see
[52:46] this is where sin
[52:48] starts Faith holds you to your
[52:53] position your faith faith in the word of
[52:56] God holds you to your
[53:00] position as soon as you move out of that
[53:02] position you're free game for the devil
[53:06] because you stepped out from behind
[53:08] God's will now this this is
[53:13] not some choices are
[53:16] temporary some choices are permanent
[53:18] okay you decide to cut your ear off it's
[53:21] pretty Permanent
[53:24] Choice
[53:26] but so sometimes in our lives we we we
[53:29] we come to face
[53:31] things
[53:34] and we can say well you know we can look
[53:38] at the will of God and say oh this is
[53:40] just you know um big big stuff and and
[53:45] but you can slip out and slip back in
[53:48] that fast you you can you can you can
[53:51] step out and say there there's something
[53:53] crosses your path for a split second
[53:56] then you step back into to your position
[53:58] you're fighting it right you're fighting
[54:00] it as soon as your flesh pulls you and
[54:02] there's that moment you step back you
[54:04] say God forgive me right you just steep
[54:05] out and steep back in and that's what
[54:08] you have to constantly do is keep the
[54:11] chaos in
[54:13] order now if if if the chaos is stronger
[54:16] than the
[54:18] order well then you
[54:20] know whole cities fall off into the
[54:24] ocean
[54:26] right uh what was that Island uh several
[54:29] years ago I was a kid when it happened
[54:31] the whole island Sri Lanka it was got
[54:33] wiped off the map basically with a big
[54:35] tsunami look chaos took
[54:37] over that's a natural example but the
[54:40] Earth is manifesting the
[54:42] sin because the Earth has fallen fell
[54:44] with the sin so the Earth is manifesting
[54:47] groaning and travailing right so the
[54:49] effects of of of the sin on the earth
[54:51] you got the flood just threw everything
[54:53] in into chaos but
[54:56] order so when chaos is stronger than
[54:59] order then chaos prevails but if order
[55:01] can hold its position now how do you
[55:03] hold position now see we're not dsts or
[55:05] we're not yin-yang and all that kind of
[55:07] stuff we are we are Sons and Daughters
[55:09] of God but this principes still apply
[55:11] because the devil can't create so the
[55:13] Dost yinyang all that came from
[55:16] somewhere see they just robbed it of God
[55:18] and twisted it and made it perverted but
[55:20] you see God gave
[55:23] us the flesh but he gave us a soul now
[55:26] the greatest Paradox to me is the son or
[55:29] daughter of God bringing flesh into
[55:32] control that cannot be done outside of
[55:35] the Holy Spirit
[55:37] yeah so God provided this way and he
[55:40] provided this choice that we could make
[55:43] to to we could either pick from the Tree
[55:46] of knowledge or the tree of
[55:48] Faith righteousness life right it's like
[55:52] the black dog and the white do dog
[55:55] whichever one we're
[55:57] feeding okay so are we feeding chaos or
[55:59] are we feeding order are we are we
[56:02] feeding the the spirit of the Soul
[56:04] within
[56:05] us and and then are we looking at at the
[56:08] problems as are we looking at the things
[56:10] that the devil brings to us and and are
[56:12] we saying oh I need to I need to throw
[56:14] that away you don't throw sin away
[56:16] because you can't sin isn't a substance
[56:19] you can't throw it in the trash sin
[56:21] isn't like trash you pick up and
[56:23] throw sin is is something's
[56:27] missing you see we were created with a
[56:31] spot for
[56:33] faith when I say faith I'm talking about
[56:36] capital F talk about Christ we were
[56:38] created with a spot for that and every
[56:41] human being drives to fill that
[56:47] void they always have a choice that
[56:50] everyone has a choice and they drive to
[56:53] feel that void now if you drive to fill
[56:55] that void with
[56:57] Christ you are
[57:00] satisfied you are hungry for more but
[57:02] you're
[57:03] satisfied you there's
[57:06] peace there's hunger and there's thirst
[57:08] like you know we we we we always need
[57:10] water but we're not
[57:12] dehydrated we're thirsting we're we're
[57:14] we're always hungry but we're not dying
[57:16] of
[57:16] starvation but knowledge on the other
[57:19] hand a tree of knowledge of good and
[57:21] evil evil more specifically doesn't ever
[57:25] satiate you're you're
[57:28] never you're always hungry you're always
[57:31] thirsty and you're dying of dehydration
[57:34] and you can cons consume as much as you
[57:38] want and you'll still be slowly wasting
[57:42] away right but you had but the the
[57:44] choice is there so the best way to fight
[57:48] the the things in our lives we we we
[57:49] wish weren't there is more faith because
[57:54] faith is is
[57:56] belief the footsteps of a righteous man
[58:00] or ordered of the Lord say God any more
[58:03] Direction in my life are you feeding the
[58:06] thing that brings you direction see many
[58:10] times you say well you know I've prayed
[58:11] about it and I've thought about it and I
[58:12] just I'm not hearing an answer meanwhile
[58:15] we we're feeding this side we're feeding
[58:18] the tree of knowledge some of it's good
[58:21] right it's a knowled tree of knowledge
[58:22] of Good and Evil but it's not the Tree
[58:25] of Life you see good good good is is
[58:29] good but it ain't going to make you
[58:34] Victorious
[58:36] right so praise the Lord now in the the
[58:40] day on Calvary he says and sin did not
[58:44] start on Earth sin started in heaven
[58:46] Lucifer the devil was a condemned
[58:48] creature for his
[58:52] Disobedience so we're looking at where
[58:54] where does start and and and defining
[58:57] defining sin and in the same time
[58:58] defining Faith right these are the the
[59:00] battle of the
[59:01] twins Esau Jacob Cain Abel uh um uh
[59:07] Sarah and and um Hagar ishmail and
[59:13] Isaac right Children of the free woman
[59:16] Children of the Bond
[59:17] woman the wheat the
[59:20] tears the True Vine the false Vine it's
[59:22] the battle of the Twins and this is
[59:24] where it started it started in heaven
[59:27] When sin was
[59:29] born When sin happened and it happened
[59:32] because of Lucifer's
[59:34] Disobedience before he ever struck the
[59:36] Earth sin began in heaven where God put
[59:38] the angels and so forth you see but
[59:40] Lucifer would have never disobeyed if he
[59:43] had had faith in
[59:46] God Disobedience to God in our lives
[59:49] comes from our lack of
[59:52] faith how do we get more faith
[59:57] Faith cometh by hearing the word of
[1:00:03] God sin began in heaven where God put
[1:00:06] the angels and so forth upon the same
[1:00:07] basis that he put human beings on
[1:00:10] knowledge the tree of knowledge the tree
[1:00:12] of life and the tree of
[1:00:14] knowledge where man could take his
[1:00:17] choice you know what I goofed up that
[1:00:19] was supposed to say life that's why I
[1:00:20] didn't look right but it's Faith it's
[1:00:22] the same thing the Tree of Life tree of
[1:00:24] knowledge where man could take his
[1:00:26] choice and when Lucifer was given the
[1:00:28] preeminence to make his choice he wanted
[1:00:32] something better than God had that
[1:00:34] started the
[1:00:36] trouble something better which really
[1:00:38] isn't better but let me back up
[1:00:42] here he said where God put the angels
[1:00:46] and so forth upon the same basis that he
[1:00:50] put human beings on knowledge so God put
[1:00:53] them on this basis of knowledge and they
[1:00:57] had a
[1:00:59] they there was a choice that had to be
[1:01:01] made and and and Lucifer you see God
[1:01:05] knew this was going to happen he he
[1:01:06] planned it this way because he needed
[1:01:10] chaos character is a victory not a gift
[1:01:14] right you see you we can you say well I
[1:01:16] just can't wait to get to glory and to
[1:01:19] to shed this robe with flesh
[1:01:21] um start utilizing it your flesh is a
[1:01:26] tool when you face
[1:01:31] opposition use it to your
[1:01:35] advantage when when when you face with
[1:01:38] with a
[1:01:39] battle sharpen your
[1:01:42] sword don't say oh man I just I just
[1:01:45] wish I didn't have this flesh no it's
[1:01:48] that attitude towards it that is causing
[1:01:51] you to be in that position God's trying
[1:01:54] to to push you say look son you got to
[1:01:57] get this through your head you need to
[1:02:00] overcome
[1:02:01] it see God doesn't want to save
[1:02:05] you he wants you to
[1:02:08] overcome he's coming back for though the
[1:02:12] Overcomers by the blood of the lamb and
[1:02:14] the word of the testimony they overcame
[1:02:17] so God's not here to pull you out or
[1:02:20] pull you through he's here to give you
[1:02:23] the guidance and the leadership you need
[1:02:24] to
[1:02:27] overcome but if we look at it through a
[1:02:29] victim mentality as oh the flesh has
[1:02:32] attacked me the devil's at me again oh
[1:02:35] the cares of life oh the world is so
[1:02:37] dark
[1:02:38] oh Hunter of Biden and China and all
[1:02:42] this stuff I better get another
[1:02:46] AK we're looking at it all
[1:02:48] wrong as the world descends into greater
[1:02:52] chaos the bride ascends into more
[1:02:56] order why because we need a lot of chaos
[1:03:02] to get out of here you're going to take
[1:03:03] a plane and you're going to take off
[1:03:05] take a little tiny CES the 150 okay tiny
[1:03:08] plane I me me and brother Trevor would
[1:03:09] be like
[1:03:11] this you take off hey no
[1:03:14] problem now you get you get those big
[1:03:17] jets that have the the what in the under
[1:03:20] the wings they've got like eight 16
[1:03:23] wheels eight on each side and a couple
[1:03:25] in the front and the back forget what
[1:03:26] they are massive cargo planes it takes a
[1:03:30] lot of engine and a lot of
[1:03:33] speed and a lot of flaps to get that
[1:03:36] thing off the
[1:03:38] ground but what more of an
[1:03:40] accomplishment when that thing lifts
[1:03:42] into the air than when a tiny CES 150
[1:03:44] lifts into the air I'm going to lose my
[1:03:47] analogy if I don't end it
[1:03:49] soon so chaos is needed to
[1:03:53] increase the engine power of
[1:03:57] order right you need more wind to get
[1:03:59] the plane off the
[1:04:01] ground you say wind that wind is
[1:04:03] terrible no wind doesn't let you you
[1:04:06] have to have wind to
[1:04:08] fly you have to have opposition right
[1:04:13] okay what makes a great
[1:04:15] boxer
[1:04:17] opponents defeated
[1:04:20] opponents what establishes a kingdom
[1:04:23] above the others defeated
[1:04:27] opponents so you aren't down low because
[1:04:31] your
[1:04:33] flesh you know because of the Fallen
[1:04:35] state of humanity now you're down low
[1:04:37] because you stopped
[1:04:39] fighting you you you you let sin you let
[1:04:43] sin you you you you stopped you stopped
[1:04:47] feeding from the Tree of Life and as
[1:04:51] that life
[1:04:53] Departed
[1:04:55] sin took over because sin is a byproduct
[1:04:58] of no faith because sin is
[1:05:03] unbelief all
[1:05:06] right Exodus
[1:05:09] 12:13 and we're closing
[1:05:12] soon and the blood shall be to you for a
[1:05:16] token upon the houses where you are and
[1:05:19] when I see the blood I will pass over
[1:05:20] you and the plague shall not be upon you
[1:05:23] to destroy you when I smite the land of
[1:05:28] Egypt so the children of Israel had a
[1:05:34] choice
[1:05:36] and they were given um an
[1:05:39] equation and the equation was kill a
[1:05:43] lamb roast his
[1:05:45] flesh take some
[1:05:47] hisop and paint blood on your doorposts
[1:05:53] that was the equation
[1:05:56] now the way God works because God is in
[1:05:58] math as soon as you take one of those
[1:06:01] things out of the equation you get a
[1:06:02] completely different answer you'll come
[1:06:05] to an answer but it's a completely
[1:06:07] different answer if I give you know
[1:06:10] let's keep this simple so I don't get lo
[1:06:12] I don't uh make a fool myself but if I
[1:06:15] give my daughter an equation to to
[1:06:17] multiply 2 * 6 and she substitutes 6 for
[1:06:21] four she'll arrive at an answer she will
[1:06:24] have solved the
[1:06:27] equation but it's not the answer I
[1:06:29] wanted I wanted 12 God wanted them to
[1:06:35] pass
[1:06:36] over he wanted them to cross over now if
[1:06:40] you think about it yeah God used this as
[1:06:43] a um this was brought on because of the
[1:06:47] of pharaoh and he wanted to take his
[1:06:48] first born but none of the other plagues
[1:06:51] involved
[1:06:52] Goan why this
[1:06:54] one wh why did why did God want to use
[1:06:58] this to test because it was time for
[1:07:00] them to say to to make a choice either
[1:07:05] I'm going to follow God or I'm
[1:07:08] not because I am sure there were those
[1:07:12] who thought it was absolutely goofy to
[1:07:14] put blood on their doors and they didn't
[1:07:16] and then they laughed at everybody else
[1:07:18] it had to be there folks look at Noah I
[1:07:21] mean look at look at just history in
[1:07:23] general and a Christian takes the word
[1:07:25] of God there is something there to mock
[1:07:27] it it's chaos mocking order right hey we
[1:07:31] got to figure it out look just come over
[1:07:32] here be as crazy and wild as you want
[1:07:34] anytime you want without any
[1:07:36] consequences but so so here they are
[1:07:38] with the blood now they have a choice to
[1:07:40] make and now you say well the blood
[1:07:42] saved them and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:07:43] saves you but you would never do that
[1:07:47] without
[1:07:49] faith you would never say I'm going to
[1:07:51] fill the void I'm going to pass over and
[1:07:54] I'm going to take this equation from God
[1:07:56] I'm going to take this path from God you
[1:07:59] would never ever do that if you didn't
[1:08:03] have faith in God so God said look
[1:08:06] you're about to go off across the desert
[1:08:09] and do all this stuff and face all these
[1:08:11] trials I need to sh I need you to make a
[1:08:15] commitment I need you to say I'm going
[1:08:17] to have faith because they would have
[1:08:19] never done
[1:08:20] it they wouldn't have done it and some
[1:08:22] of them didn't do it
[1:08:24] because they lacked
[1:08:26] Faith because there had to be that that
[1:08:29] element to show them that is what
[1:08:32] happens when you don't listen to God so
[1:08:35] obedience brought them over they
[1:08:39] overcame they passed over you want to
[1:08:42] pass over the river Jordan into the
[1:08:44] promised land to live a life for Christ
[1:08:46] full of the Holy Ghost you have to take
[1:08:49] this same equation the lamb the
[1:08:52] sacrifice
[1:08:54] Faith which is his s the blood of Jesus
[1:08:57] Christ it's the same thing but you see
[1:09:00] the very origins of righteousness say oh
[1:09:02] I want to be righteous the very origins
[1:09:04] of that is faith in God so God has to
[1:09:08] then prove himself to you in a way not
[1:09:12] that we're standing here saying prove it
[1:09:13] to me God no God comes along and he
[1:09:16] shows you he shows you you can believe
[1:09:20] in him he builds your faith you see
[1:09:24] that's the Paradox of it right we have a
[1:09:26] choice but at the same time God chose
[1:09:29] you you didn't choose god brother bom
[1:09:32] says now that sounds like an absolute
[1:09:35] hypocrisy total look you just
[1:09:37] contradicted yourself both
[1:09:41] ways but you still have a
[1:09:44] choice and God doesn't force you to make
[1:09:47] the choice but he gives you what you
[1:09:49] need to make the choice he leads you he
[1:09:52] guides you he says look I think this is
[1:09:54] better over here I know this is better
[1:09:57] over here so he guides you that way and
[1:10:02] your faith in him as your Shepherd you
[1:10:04] say
[1:10:06] okay you go that way right say well if
[1:10:09] God says it's better over there then
[1:10:10] it's better over there the greatest
[1:10:12] mistakes I see in people's life is when
[1:10:14] they say oh no that can't be any good
[1:10:18] look at look at how it looks you know
[1:10:20] that person's got to be making
[1:10:22] mistakes and you want to grab them by
[1:10:25] the collar and say have you asked
[1:10:31] God have you even I almost took a part
[1:10:34] two of the morphism of Christianity and
[1:10:36] said what and TI subtitled it what
[1:10:38] happened to
[1:10:40] prayer you can never pray too much I I
[1:10:42] heard you know we use our car you can't
[1:10:46] has this feature feature I call it a bug
[1:10:49] um that you can't start the car and not
[1:10:52] have the radio turn on
[1:10:54] it's just weird it will happen so we
[1:10:56] have it tuned to 88.1 I think this
[1:10:58] Rejoice radio right very
[1:11:01] conservative and um a lot of times and I
[1:11:05] think this is where our pastor gets it
[1:11:06] too because he's always talking about
[1:11:08] what these denominational preachers are
[1:11:10] saying a lot of times it's a preacher
[1:11:11] I'm like hey this is pretty good so I
[1:11:13] listened to it for a second and this man
[1:11:15] was talking about
[1:11:17] prayer and and he's talking about you
[1:11:19] know praying without ceasing and and he
[1:11:21] he I should have grabbed it but I didn't
[1:11:24] cuz I forgot about it but the Lord's
[1:11:25] bringing it to my remembrance now he he
[1:11:27] references this man who wrote this thing
[1:11:29] and and and I'll I I will I will butcher
[1:11:32] it but I'm going to give it a try
[1:11:33] anyways and and we'll find it later
[1:11:35] together he says this man writes this
[1:11:37] thing on prayer and he says I I I the
[1:11:39] other day I went to do my daily prayer
[1:11:41] and I looked at will my my self- will
[1:11:43] and I said will are you ready to go to
[1:11:45] prayer and will says I am if you are so
[1:11:47] me and will got up and went to go to our
[1:11:49] closet for prayer and all of our
[1:11:51] emotions begin to the emotions began to
[1:11:54] pull back and and suddenly suddenly I I
[1:11:56] was tired and suddenly I had all of
[1:11:58] these things and I was unhappy and and
[1:12:00] but me and will we went to prayer
[1:12:01] anyways and we drugg the emotions
[1:12:04] along and as me and will were praying I
[1:12:06] I suddenly found one of my emotions out
[1:12:08] playing golf on the golf course and I
[1:12:09] had to go get him and bring him back a
[1:12:11] few minutes later one of my emotions was
[1:12:14] was was out building a tractor I had to
[1:12:15] go get him and say look we're not doing
[1:12:16] that right now we're praying with Will
[1:12:19] so I came back to Will and we begin to
[1:12:20] pray some more and if you had to ask me
[1:12:22] when I finished did you have a good time
[1:12:24] I would have had to say no I
[1:12:26] didn't my emotions were all over the
[1:12:28] place but then the next day came and I
[1:12:30] looked at will and said will are you
[1:12:31] ready to go for our daily prayers and
[1:12:33] will says I am if you are and I said
[1:12:35] okay let's go so we drug emotion
[1:12:37] along now emotions would kep crazy again
[1:12:40] and I had to go back and Wrangle them up
[1:12:41] and bring them back together and if you
[1:12:43] would have asked me when I finished did
[1:12:44] you have a good time I would have had to
[1:12:46] give you the answer no I
[1:12:48] didn't now as this went on day after day
[1:12:50] within a couple of weeks something
[1:12:51] happened me and will we're discussing
[1:12:54] about ready to go through our daily
[1:12:55] prayer and as we begin to we looked to
[1:12:57] emotions we begin to walk away emotions
[1:12:59] looked at each other and said you know
[1:13:00] what we might as well just go along cuz
[1:13:01] they're going to do it anyways so they
[1:13:04] came along willingly and then another
[1:13:06] week or so later something happened I me
[1:13:09] and will had decided it was time for our
[1:13:10] daily prayer we went to prayer in our
[1:13:12] closet and and one of the emotions you
[1:13:14] know they by that point they were coming
[1:13:15] along Free Will and they were there they
[1:13:17] were never you know real good players in
[1:13:19] the game they're there begrudgingly but
[1:13:21] they knew hey they didn't have a choice
[1:13:22] so they sat around while we prayed and
[1:13:24] and suddenly one of the emotions got got
[1:13:26] a little bit a little excited and said
[1:13:28] Hallelujah and all the rest of them said
[1:13:33] amen and if you would asked me now did I
[1:13:37] have a good time I would have to say
[1:13:40] yes and how true that
[1:13:45] is
[1:13:49] prayer takes
[1:13:51] work but if we can look our self-will in
[1:13:54] the face and you say look today we're
[1:13:56] going to go to prayer and your self-will
[1:13:57] answers back and says yes let's go don't
[1:14:00] let your emot emotions rule you you rule
[1:14:04] your
[1:14:05] emotions that's why we can't just serve
[1:14:08] God based on how we feel because our
[1:14:10] emotions are going to feel all kinds of
[1:14:12] things because our emotions are grounded
[1:14:14] where in our
[1:14:15] flesh but will is down on our
[1:14:19] soul the spirit is willing but the flesh
[1:14:22] is weak
[1:14:26] so next time it's time for your daily
[1:14:30] prayers just drag emotion
[1:14:33] along and one day they'll catch
[1:14:36] Revelation
[1:14:37] too and you the the the the Life of
[1:14:40] Christ the faith that will raise within
[1:14:42] you will put those emotions and they'll
[1:14:45] start to say amen hallelujah as you seek
[1:14:48] God In Prayer you see we look at prayer
[1:14:51] all
[1:14:52] wrong
[1:14:53] it's
[1:14:54] not it's not this thing where where we
[1:14:57] just we just go and we just talk
[1:14:59] it's it even fails me on how to explain
[1:15:02] it it's it's this time where where we
[1:15:04] just we have to just do
[1:15:06] it we we we just you you have to do it
[1:15:09] you have to go pray you you cannot live
[1:15:11] without it and and I begin to think on
[1:15:13] these lines from the this this preacher
[1:15:15] and I
[1:15:15] thought I imagine myself future self and
[1:15:19] I thought who would I be if I prayed
[1:15:22] like I should
[1:15:25] what kind of what kind of atmosphere
[1:15:27] will we have in the church Wednesday or
[1:15:29] Sunday if we all prayed like we
[1:15:32] should what's holding us
[1:15:37] back what's holding us
[1:15:39] back we all have something that's
[1:15:42] holding us back we can chalk it up to
[1:15:43] not enough time or or or this that or
[1:15:46] the other we could figure out something
[1:15:48] but then our
[1:15:49] emotions will be giving us
[1:15:52] excuses
[1:15:53] but God said lamb sacrifice Faith
[1:15:59] blood brother man preach a message
[1:16:01] called the
[1:16:03] token that's it right
[1:16:05] there the only way to bring
[1:16:09] your flesh into subject
[1:16:13] to go pray regardless of how you feel is
[1:16:17] an increase of
[1:16:20] Faith because if you have belief if you
[1:16:23] have
[1:16:24] righteousness you will fight against
[1:16:28] unbelief you will fight against chaos
[1:16:31] stronger than you ever have
[1:16:34] before when you realize it's just a lack
[1:16:37] of something I just need more not don't
[1:16:41] start going and get you need to you need
[1:16:43] to rip this out no when someone comes to
[1:16:46] the Lord don't hand them a skirt and say
[1:16:48] okay now go put this on no just watch
[1:16:51] the word feed
[1:16:54] them sometimes sometimes we have to
[1:16:55] cover modesty right it's part of the
[1:16:57] word of God the Bible says a a woman
[1:16:59] shall not wear what that which
[1:17:01] pertaining to a man so it has to be
[1:17:02] talked about but it takes Revelation for
[1:17:05] it to manifest on the outside it takes
[1:17:08] Revelation you see I I'll say this in
[1:17:11] closing if I can close there's such an
[1:17:13] atmosphere right now it takes Revelation
[1:17:16] for order to bring chaos under
[1:17:20] control it takes Revelation for for
[1:17:23] what's inside of here to bring your
[1:17:26] flesh in subjection so you literally
[1:17:28] need a revelation to go to prayer every
[1:17:30] time you do do you guys know what
[1:17:32] Revelation is revelation is
[1:17:35] Faith do you realize it's actually very
[1:17:39] simple Lucifer son of the
[1:17:43] morning fell from Grace because he
[1:17:46] stopped believing in
[1:17:48] God each of us fall from time to time
[1:17:52] because we stopped having
[1:17:54] faith in God because we got weak because
[1:17:59] we stopped feeding Faith because because
[1:18:04] because but if we could anchor ourselves
[1:18:08] on the truth what does the scripture
[1:18:11] say know the truth and the truth shall
[1:18:16] set you free why because
[1:18:20] truth all truth comes from
[1:18:24] God and if it comes from God it's God's
[1:18:27] word and if it's God's word it's Loos
[1:18:30] and if it's Loos it's God's life and if
[1:18:32] it's God's life it is
[1:18:37] Faith for I
[1:18:39] am how's that scripture go the victory
[1:18:42] that overcomes the world the blood of
[1:18:45] Jesus Christ The Plan of Redemption the
[1:18:47] fall of Adam and Eve everything was so
[1:18:50] that you could be where you are today
[1:18:53] and God could give you what you need so
[1:18:54] you could bring flesh under control and
[1:18:57] as every time you do that you get a
[1:18:58] Little Bit Stronger you get a Little Bit
[1:19:00] Stronger you get a Little Bit Stronger
[1:19:02] you're the best way to get strong
[1:19:04] Progressive overload so every time you
[1:19:06] work out you add a little bit more
[1:19:08] weight you never stop adding
[1:19:11] weight now there's limits to the human
[1:19:13] body but you reach that point some lift
[1:19:17] 900 lb some lift 1,50 some lift 1100
[1:19:21] lb
[1:19:25] but God puts you underneath a load over
[1:19:28] time to constantly increase your faith
[1:19:32] so he gives you the word of God to give
[1:19:34] you the faith and he gives you the
[1:19:36] battle to test your faith because then
[1:19:38] if you put your faith you say oh I got
[1:19:41] it I believe it God immediately puts you
[1:19:43] to test the faith why because then that
[1:19:45] Faith becomes a revelation you say wow
[1:19:48] yes I
[1:19:49] know right the first time you do
[1:19:51] something you never done before for and
[1:19:53] you do it you know as a kid there was
[1:19:55] this there was this rope swing at this
[1:19:58] people's house and I don't know how big
[1:20:00] the cliff was I was a little kid but it
[1:20:02] looked like it was about three stories
[1:20:04] and this rope swung you out over the
[1:20:06] edge and back onto the cliff on the
[1:20:08] other
[1:20:09] side when I finally did it the Elation
[1:20:13] the the the the wow I did it right you
[1:20:16] you couldn't you couldn't take that from
[1:20:18] me when once you live it once you live
[1:20:21] the vision of Christ you live out faith
[1:20:24] and God says look if you just pray and
[1:20:25] believe I'll heal you and God heals you
[1:20:27] nobody can take that from you and next
[1:20:30] time sin comes knocking on your door you
[1:20:32] can say look I'm sorry but God already
[1:20:34] healed me once and so I know he can do
[1:20:37] it
[1:20:38] again but it takes iterations of that it
[1:20:41] takes that over time so that's why God
[1:20:46] put us in time we see nothing is out of
[1:20:50] order chaos is present but God's in
[1:20:55] control God is controlling everything
[1:20:59] time is a tool in his hands amen let's
[1:21:02] bow our
[1:21:04] heads Heavenly Father Lord
[1:21:09] Jesus thank you for your the word
[1:21:11] tonight Lord thank you for speaking to
[1:21:13] My
[1:21:14] Heart Lord if if we could just remember
[1:21:18] when we have these moments where we
[1:21:20] maybe get more upset than we should or
[1:21:23] whatever it would be the flesh chaos
[1:21:26] takes
[1:21:27] control if we would just
[1:21:30] realize we don't need to get rid of the
[1:21:33] bad attitude we need to get more of the
[1:21:35] good attitude we need to get more of the
[1:21:38] faith help us to to to Really take a
[1:21:41] hold of that so that when we get up in
[1:21:44] tomorrow or before we go to bed tonight
[1:21:47] we would say you know what there's
[1:21:48] battles coming I'm going to pray I'm
[1:21:51] going to read my Bible bble I'm going to
[1:21:53] listen to the sermons of brother brandom
[1:21:55] I'm going to feed on the word of
[1:21:58] God
[1:22:00] and we would be fighting the battle on
[1:22:04] the offense rather than the defense and
[1:22:08] we would no longer feel uh things out of
[1:22:10] control and we would begin to com uh
[1:22:13] progress forward and and begin to see
[1:22:16] the word of God and and have a
[1:22:17] relationship with you like we've never
[1:22:19] had

[1:22:52] to to
[1:22:55] do what you're calling us to sometimes
[1:22:58] that's the battle sometimes the battle
[1:22:59] isn't to do devotions or not sometimes
[1:23:01] the battle is doing what you want us to
[1:23:02] do but we're afraid to take the step
