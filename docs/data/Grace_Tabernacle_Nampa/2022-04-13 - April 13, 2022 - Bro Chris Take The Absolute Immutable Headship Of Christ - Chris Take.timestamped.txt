[23:26] where god chose to speak unto them
[23:32] but he wasn't
[23:35] there yet
[23:38] before he led them to the promised land
[23:44] oh what we have is a pillar of fire
[23:50] it's leading
[23:52] the church of god again
[23:56] for it's leading us back to the bible
[24:02] and it's leading
[24:05] us away from sin
[24:08] and it's showing the resurrected savior
[24:15] showing himself alive again
[24:21] what we have
[24:23] is fire
[24:27] and it's burning
[24:29] in the hearts of man
[24:32] the early church had the pillar of fire
[24:40] leading each and every day
[24:45] and showing to all of the sinners
[24:51] that jesus is the only way
[24:56] without the blood
[24:59] there is no salvation

[25:20] oh what we have is a pillar of fire
[25:27] it's leading
[25:28] the church of god again

[25:39] and it's leading
[25:41] us away from sin
[25:45] showing the
[25:47] resurrected savior
[25:50] and he's showing himself alive again
[25:56] what we have is a pillar of fire
[26:02] and it's burning
[26:04] in the hearts of man
[26:09] [Music]
[26:19] otherwise where would we find our
[26:21] victory
[26:22] amen praise the lord well we thank you
[26:24] for all your prayers
[26:26] over the weekend with the last minute
[26:28] trip up to washington
[26:30] um turned out to be a bit of a blessing
[26:32] under the circumstances
[26:34] um grandma gloria who's kristen's
[26:37] grandma on her mom's side she's doing a
[26:40] lot better than we thought she was she's
[26:41] still on hospice care in her home
[26:45] but
[26:46] we're trusting and believing that god
[26:49] heals her
[26:51] whether his whatever his will is but the
[26:53] ultimate thing that we are asking for is
[26:55] the salvation of her soul
[26:57] um she has two sons that that live with
[26:59] her there and
[27:00] we were able to pick up a bible in uh
[27:03] the first book of the supernatural
[27:04] series and on our way home
[27:07] monday we stopped in and gave it to her
[27:09] and separately me and my wife both had
[27:11] the same thought that her one son brian
[27:14] who has been through a lot um
[27:17] would be the one to read it to her
[27:18] because she can't see very well and then
[27:20] he would get saved too so
[27:23] maybe there's something there just
[27:24] believing believing on that but
[27:28] brother john andes and the church there
[27:31] they send their greetings i saw a
[27:33] million and one people that knew
[27:35] most of you
[27:36] um i said i would try to remember their
[27:38] names so that uh but didier as well
[27:41] since his greetings
[27:42] and uh i was talking with brother daryl
[27:44] ward today just briefly and so he said
[27:47] say hello to for the paul and the saints
[27:48] at grace tabernacle so greetings from
[27:51] brother daryl ward as well
[27:53] amen if you have your bibles tonight
[27:54] want to stand with us
[27:57] we are going to turn to
[27:59] hebrews chapter 7.
[28:12] hebrews chapter seven we're gonna start
[28:14] in verse 23.
[28:18] i'm not asking for forgiveness or
[28:20] apologizing i'm just letting you know i
[28:22] have a lot of scriptures and quotes
[28:23] tonight
[28:26] so bear with me
[28:27] seven hebrews 7 20 i cut out cut things
[28:30] down where i could but
[28:32] i mean
[28:33] it's all good anyway so
[28:36] hebrews 7 verse 23 why don't we have a
[28:37] word prayer first
[28:39] heavenly father lord we are so thankful
[28:41] to be in your house tonight and
[28:43] we know that
[28:45] this is the place you intended
[28:47] father the way your word is the way you
[28:49] are lord there are certain things that
[28:51] you just said in order because
[28:53] and father it is called of us to accept
[28:56] that lord
[28:57] father because you are god and we are
[28:59] not and
[29:00] lord we just thank you for this time to
[29:02] come into your house and worship you
[29:03] your presence is near and we appreciate
[29:05] that lord we don't take that for granted
[29:07] lord jesus and
[29:09] father we are a privileged people to be
[29:11] able to serve you in this crazy world
[29:13] that is
[29:14] around us lord
[29:16] father yet all things are working
[29:18] together for good lord for your glory
[29:20] lord jesus we ask that you take these
[29:22] words tonight that you've laid upon my
[29:23] heart not my words your words lord
[29:26] any words that would be mine or opinions
[29:28] of mine may you move them aside lord
[29:30] jesus that you just have liberty with
[29:32] your word this evening we ask touch your
[29:34] hearts of your people lord we pray in
[29:35] jesus name
[29:37] amen hebrews 7 verse 23
[29:41] and they truly were many priests because
[29:43] they were not suffered to continue by
[29:46] reason of death
[29:47] but this man because he continueth ever
[29:50] hath an unchangeable priesthood talking
[29:53] about christ
[29:54] wherefore he is able also to save them
[29:56] to the uttermost
[29:59] leaving none behind
[30:01] that come unto god by him seeing he ever
[30:03] liveth to make intercession for them
[30:06] for such an high priest became us
[30:08] who is holy harmless undefiled separate
[30:11] from sinners made higher than the
[30:13] heavens
[30:15] who needeth not daily as those high
[30:17] priests who offer a sacrifice
[30:19] sacrifice first for his own sins and
[30:22] then for the peoples
[30:24] for this he did once when he offered up
[30:26] himself
[30:28] for the law maketh
[30:30] key in here for the law maketh men high
[30:32] priests which have infirmity
[30:35] but the word of the oath which was since
[30:38] the law maketh the sun capitalist who is
[30:41] consecrated forevermore
[30:45] turn to
[30:46] right next door to hebrews chapter 6.
[30:50] before we read that i just have a quick
[30:52] scripture here galatians 2 4
[30:54] and that because of false brethren
[30:57] unawares brought in who came in privily
[30:59] to spy out our liberty came in secretly
[31:02] snuck in to spy out our liberty which we
[31:05] have in christ jesus
[31:07] that they might bring us
[31:09] into bondage
[31:11] so man brings bondage but christ brings
[31:14] liberty
[31:16] hebrews chapter 6 verse 17
[31:19] wherein god willing more abundantly to
[31:23] show
[31:24] unto the heirs of
[31:26] promise the immutability of his counsel
[31:30] confirmed it by an oath
[31:32] there's another scripture here in
[31:33] hebrews where he says he could swear by
[31:35] none greater so he swore by himself
[31:38] that by two immutable things
[31:41] immutable means unchanging over time or
[31:44] unable to be changed
[31:47] god changes not
[31:49] which it is impossible for god to lie
[31:52] that is immutable
[31:54] we might have a strong
[31:57] so let me restart that by two immutable
[31:59] things in which it was impossible for
[32:01] god to lie we might have a strong
[32:03] consolation or encouragement
[32:05] who have fled for refuge to lay hold
[32:08] upon the hope set before us
[32:11] not behind us before us which hope which
[32:14] is christ we have as an anchor of the
[32:17] soul
[32:18] both sure and steadfast and which
[32:20] entereth into that within the veil
[32:23] whether the forerunner is for us entered
[32:26] even jesus so he entered into the veil
[32:28] before us
[32:29] made an high priest forever after the
[32:32] order of melchizedek may the lord add
[32:35] the blessing to the reading of his word
[32:36] he may be seated tonight
[32:39] so
[32:41] as spoken of before we're going to speak
[32:44] uh
[32:45] two altars part three tonight
[32:48] um
[32:51] in part one we
[32:54] talked about uh
[32:56] alter the an altar built of lively
[32:59] stones and we took from i think it's
[33:01] second peter
[33:02] or the altar built up of lively stones
[33:04] and and elijah and the mount carmel
[33:07] showdown elijah repaired the altar
[33:09] and there was there's a loud no hewn
[33:12] stone in other words a man can't go and
[33:14] cut the stone it has to be natural
[33:16] ordained of god
[33:18] part two we talked about the sacrificial
[33:20] altar of praise the prayers of the
[33:22] saints are are an incense and an
[33:25] instance for an atonement and
[33:28] for that instance to do its work there
[33:30] is always fire needed typing the holy
[33:33] spirit hezekiah we talk about hezekiah
[33:36] changing the mind of god with his
[33:38] prayers and that you are kings and
[33:40] priests under the order of melchizedek
[33:44] we are under christ
[33:45] as kings and priests in other words we
[33:48] have the ability to offer these incense
[33:50] up so tonight i'd like to take part
[33:53] three and my title would be the absolute
[33:55] immutable headship of christ
[33:58] and the lord's been really dealing with
[33:59] my heart on this subject
[34:01] and this has been kind of marinating if
[34:04] you will for quite a few weeks and
[34:06] jotting down notes and things and and i
[34:08] i felt led um and i even confessed this
[34:11] to the youth group last youth meeting i
[34:13] said we're going to listen to the tape
[34:15] absolute because we've been we've been
[34:17] starting a new thing where
[34:19] there's a new tape every month that they
[34:21] need to listen to and so i said i don't
[34:23] know why yet but i want i feel led to
[34:26] have us listen to an absolute
[34:29] and it's the first one that he that he
[34:31] ministers on and i i began the same time
[34:33] i begin to think about headship and and
[34:36] uh realizing just how beautifully that
[34:38] ties in because christ is our absolute
[34:41] and the only way that christ can be our
[34:43] absolute is if we are under his headship
[34:47] and um
[34:49] so just i hope that they've been
[34:51] listening and they can then can glean
[34:53] the same thing tonight um one more
[34:55] scripture here uh first corinthians
[34:58] chapter 11.
[35:00] so we read here in galatians 2 4 that
[35:03] these men went out privately
[35:05] to spy out our liberty it's your liberty
[35:09] whatever god has given you is now in
[35:11] your possession
[35:13] you have full authority given to you by
[35:16] christ it's yours the promises are yours
[35:19] the liberty is yours and if you do not
[35:22] have liberty all you have to do is step
[35:24] forward under the promise and take that
[35:26] liberty so they they were envious people
[35:30] are
[35:31] the the outside world is envious of the
[35:33] liberty that we have in christ but as
[35:36] we're going to see tonight that liberty
[35:38] only comes when we are underneath the
[35:40] headship of christ
[35:43] so then men desire to bring us into
[35:45] bondage but christ brings us liberty
[35:47] can't talk about
[35:49] headship i suppose without reading this
[35:51] scripture first corinthians chapter 11
[35:53] be followers of me even as i also am of
[35:56] christ now i praise you brethren that ye
[35:59] remember me in all things and keep the
[36:00] ordinances as i delivered them to you
[36:04] but i would have you know that the head
[36:06] of every man is christ and the head of
[36:09] the woman is the man and the head of
[36:12] christ is god now okay everyone's just
[36:15] assumed i'm gonna just attack women
[36:17] tonight
[36:19] well i have a i have maybe news to you
[36:21] maybe not news to you but did you know a
[36:23] man can have a dominating female spirit
[36:25] yes
[36:27] paul starts out he says he says look
[36:29] follow me as i follow christ
[36:32] right away he brings the church of
[36:33] corinthian into lines hey it's not me
[36:35] you're following it's christ
[36:38] it says the head of every man is christ
[36:42] and the head of the woman is the man and
[36:44] the head of christ is god
[36:47] so it's all in order
[36:49] underneath the headship of christ in an
[36:51] abs in the absolute
[36:54] 1962. brother says i said if he slay me
[36:58] so let me back up i didn't put the whole
[36:59] quote in here but in this in this sermon
[37:02] brother brown gets down towards the end
[37:03] here and he begins to share the his the
[37:06] story of where he used to go to the
[37:08] grave of his wife and and his daughter
[37:10] sharon
[37:11] rose and he was he would go there a lot
[37:14] and he was going up one time right after
[37:15] the flood and
[37:17] that they had there and the i think it
[37:19] was the mayor stops him and he begins to
[37:21] talk to him and you know say hey you
[37:22] know are you doing okay what are you
[37:24] doing and and he says you know i'd like
[37:26] to go and hear the dove's coup and all
[37:27] this stuff and and different things at
[37:30] the grave side and so it's just a very
[37:32] moving portion of the sermon and and he
[37:34] says i said if he slay me so he says he
[37:38] says brother brother biller or billy
[37:40] what does christ mean to you now
[37:43] he said you've given your heart to to to
[37:46] you
[37:46] your labor of love into into the
[37:48] ministry god has given you and doing all
[37:51] of these things and and and up late at
[37:53] night with sick calls and preaching on
[37:54] the corner and working a full-time job
[37:57] and yet he took your wife and your baby
[37:59] what all these things what does he mean
[38:01] to you now and brother beno says these
[38:03] words he said i said if he slay me yet i
[38:05] trust him
[38:06] why my anchor holds within the veil
[38:09] i had an absolute i tied myself to his
[38:13] word and his word was holding remember
[38:16] we've been talking about that a lot
[38:18] lately it's not that you got the holy
[38:20] ghost is that the holy ghost got you he
[38:23] is my absolute i found out that all
[38:25] these other things may fail but christ
[38:28] can never fail
[38:30] amen what a nice testimony of faith
[38:37] now you look at the definition of lord
[38:39] it means someone or something having
[38:41] power authority or influence a master or
[38:45] ruler
[38:47] if christ is your absolute
[38:49] he has absolute power and authority over
[38:52] you
[38:54] christ was our is is our example we are
[38:57] called to become like christ what did he
[38:59] do i can do nothing except for the
[39:01] father
[39:03] i do the father's business
[39:05] we've been hearing that too
[39:07] amen so he is your master the brother
[39:09] man says in christ is the mystery of god
[39:10] revealed he says and the body must
[39:13] follow the head as the wife follows the
[39:16] husband
[39:17] being that adam was not deceived he
[39:19] walked out with eve eve was deceived she
[39:22] was in the transgression or the entire
[39:25] resurrection of the whole body would
[39:27] have come forth at the day of the lord
[39:29] jesus when he came forth from the grave
[39:32] but he had to redeem her which is his
[39:36] body he had to redeem his body
[39:39] she has to be redeemed in order to come
[39:43] to him
[39:44] see adam knew he was sinning when he
[39:47] took eve
[39:49] but her head was redeeming her you see
[39:54] there is victory there is safety
[39:58] underneath the headship of christ there
[40:01] is safety as a as a wife under the
[40:03] headship of your husband
[40:06] if he is under the headship of christ
[40:09] um but i just want to use that as a type
[40:12] of being under the headship of christ
[40:14] so adam was covering eve
[40:18] when he took her and he committed the
[40:20] sin he was covering eve he said well how
[40:24] could this happen in the garden of eden
[40:26] and i have you can go in the church age
[40:28] book and read it it was all part of
[40:30] god's redemption plan you see nothing
[40:33] can happen unless god has foreordained
[40:36] it to happen all things follow
[40:38] underneath god's plan
[40:42] now so so this was a type see
[40:46] christ was christ is christ's blood
[40:49] christ himself is the covering but until
[40:52] he redeemed you
[40:54] redeemed the human race we didn't have
[40:57] access to that covering we didn't have
[40:59] access to that headship so adam took
[41:02] upon the sin christ took upon the sin
[41:06] so that he could redeem the bride of
[41:08] jesus christ and he became
[41:11] the covering christ covered the bride
[41:14] with his blood
[41:16] and this redemption that's the seven
[41:18] seals
[41:19] that is it right there christ redeeming
[41:21] his bride and bringing her to a place
[41:24] where she could come to submission
[41:26] and the underneath the headship of
[41:28] christ because brother brown says he
[41:30] says we step out
[41:33] of the will of god god doesn't push us
[41:35] out
[41:36] we step out when we step out from the
[41:38] will of god then now we're on our own so
[41:41] to speak not really but we're in we're
[41:44] in an unsafe position and things can
[41:46] happen we have to step back into the
[41:49] will of god you cannot be in the will of
[41:51] god unless you are underneath the
[41:53] submission and headship of christ
[41:56] there is no other option
[41:58] it will not work
[42:00] i'm laying a foundation we'll get to
[42:01] what we're going to we'll get to this
[42:04] tonight so headship in its pure form is
[42:07] not control
[42:09] or dictatorship
[42:11] it is a love affair
[42:14] i was just energized saints of god
[42:15] looking at this we look at the scripture
[42:18] of you know oh the the man is the head
[42:20] of the woman
[42:22] and i think sometimes i know sometimes
[42:25] we miss the point
[42:27] the point was about wasn't about a man
[42:29] having rulership over a woman the point
[42:31] is you need christ
[42:34] as your head
[42:36] he was setting an order of the family
[42:38] which is a direct representation of
[42:41] christ the family of god
[42:46] so in the purest form it is a love
[42:49] affair
[42:51] you know the world the people the women
[42:53] in the world today want to deny we don't
[42:55] need men
[42:57] well some of the men
[43:00] they need to get their heads straight
[43:03] i don't blame them but this is a world
[43:06] that we live in
[43:08] it goes both sides both the man and the
[43:10] woman responsible but it's the spirits
[43:12] of the age it's not flesh and blood it's
[43:14] the principalities of the air
[43:16] but when you see what's happening in the
[43:18] natural world you get an understanding
[43:20] for what's happening on the spiritual
[43:21] side
[43:22] but the battle talked about how when
[43:24] they went into space and things that was
[43:25] a direct correlation to
[43:28] the opening of the word
[43:30] the space age
[43:32] so what is it it's the bride coming to a
[43:35] peak a pinnacle
[43:37] under the headship of christ so the
[43:39] devil's going to pervert that
[43:41] he's going to flip that around
[43:43] and he's going to fight against that the
[43:46] devil's always
[43:48] motivated his motivation is always to
[43:50] fight against what god is doing
[43:52] right because he does not want you to be
[43:55] a part of that
[43:57] so as the bride
[43:59] comes to her position now of authority
[44:02] you see the same thing women coming into
[44:04] power
[44:06] but at the same time they're denying
[44:07] headship of any man
[44:10] and the bride is accepting the headship
[44:12] of christ
[44:15] it's just the world that we live in
[44:17] today
[44:18] adam laid down his life to protect eve
[44:22] a man and a woman in in in uh that are
[44:26] married husband and wife that are in
[44:30] harmony with god's word
[44:33] the man underneath the headship of
[44:34] christ the woman under the headship of
[44:36] the man
[44:38] he is her protector
[44:42] he doesn't say oh you figure it out you
[44:44] know you do as i tell you to do and
[44:46] figure no that's not he's holding the
[44:48] door for her opening the car door for
[44:50] her
[44:51] right it's a love affair
[44:54] it's a it's it's a it's a moment where
[44:58] we're all humans i forget to open the
[44:59] door too
[45:03] but in that in that in that perfection
[45:06] it's in what it is in that that line
[45:09] christ the man
[45:11] the woman
[45:12] in that line is
[45:15] is a the purest form of love
[45:19] you want to do everything you can to
[45:20] provide for her protect her
[45:23] and she in turn wants to do everything
[45:25] she can to respect and cherish
[45:28] her head i mean isn't that how we are
[45:30] with christ our desires to do everything
[45:33] we can to please him
[45:35] everything we can our our we wake up in
[45:37] the morning and say how can we please
[45:39] you today lord what can we do
[45:41] how can we give you more of ourselves
[45:44] amen and it's the same thing in that in
[45:46] a in in that
[45:48] relationship between a man husband and
[45:50] wife
[45:51] but man has perverted headship
[45:54] any viewpoint that anyone has that of
[45:56] headship that is negative
[45:59] is because a man
[46:01] had his own
[46:02] say opinion about it i'm talking about
[46:05] when we say headship people from you
[46:08] know outside of the message and you know
[46:10] those men in the message that kind of
[46:12] thing
[46:13] right it's they've seen a perversion of
[46:15] that
[46:17] where it's it's perverted into do as i
[46:20] say or else
[46:24] but that's not the way that god desired
[46:26] it it's god didn't say you know my way
[46:28] or the highway
[46:30] he's a leader
[46:32] he is not going to ask you to go through
[46:34] to go do anything he has not done
[46:37] himself
[46:39] anything you face in life he has faced
[46:42] that's why he came to earth and walked
[46:43] in shoe leather
[46:45] because he's leading you he doesn't ever
[46:47] shove you in front
[46:48] and say you know you open the door or or
[46:51] you shine the light no he is leading you
[46:54] he is the light leading you down the
[46:56] path we follow after christ
[47:00] and in turn we are our representation of
[47:02] christ to this generation
[47:04] but that can only come
[47:07] um
[47:08] when we are underneath that headship the
[47:11] perfect headship what is it the absolute
[47:13] immutable headship of christ in other
[47:15] words
[47:17] you need nothing else
[47:18] and it's unchanging that's it
[47:21] you need nothing else and it's
[47:22] unchanging that's
[47:24] following christ in full submission
[47:27] i don't know if i'm stepping on toes or
[47:29] if y'all are just listening tonight
[47:35] the purest form is harmony between a man
[47:38] christ a man and a woman each in their
[47:41] position which will produce
[47:43] unconditional love
[47:47] 1963 christians god revealed again now
[47:50] we see the promise being fulfilled
[47:53] christ the true headship going in
[47:56] coming in his bride doing the same works
[47:58] that he did at the beginning
[48:01] that's underlined there coming in his
[48:03] bride doing the same works that he did
[48:05] at the beginning
[48:07] and making ready and fulfilling his word
[48:09] as he did at first in john 14 12 he that
[48:12] believeth on me the works that i do
[48:14] shall he do also
[48:17] then the head and the body are becoming
[48:19] one
[48:22] you see there will be no rapture for an
[48:24] individual who can't accept
[48:26] the headship of christ
[48:29] not a man's idea
[48:32] and this is the this is the two altars
[48:34] part three
[48:35] man has his altar god has his
[48:39] one is an impersonation looks like the
[48:42] thing but god will never
[48:46] the word slips my mind god will never
[48:48] put his stamp of approval on that
[48:51] because man has hewn the stones oh it's
[48:54] a great program and i saw something
[48:57] today i won't say where it was
[48:59] but it was a program
[49:03] and it's just grieving to see what
[49:06] people will do
[49:07] because it's not about a man's
[49:10] program and laid out
[49:12] guess what uh
[49:13] you know you think you have it figured
[49:15] out god's going to come and turn you
[49:17] upside down
[49:18] they say oh i know i know my future i
[49:20] know where i'm going to be in 30 years
[49:21] and i know where i'm going to live who
[49:22] i'm going to be married to
[49:24] and all this stuff and god says um
[49:27] i'm sorry
[49:29] he doesn't apologize he just goes
[49:31] and turns your life upside down
[49:34] but there's a cap
[49:36] on the bottle so you don't get all
[49:38] poured out
[49:41] here's your
[49:42] protection they say what you know job
[49:45] and all that he went through but still
[49:47] underneath god's protection
[49:50] that was a man
[49:52] fully submitted to christ's headship
[49:54] because his wife came along and said
[49:55] just curse god and die and he said well
[49:57] how can i do that
[49:59] how can i do that
[50:00] to do that is is to remove
[50:02] to go against everything even though in
[50:04] the midst of that situation in the midst
[50:05] of that trial
[50:08] so he goes on to say um
[50:10] head and the body are becoming one
[50:12] in works and in sign and in life
[50:15] vindicated by god himself
[50:18] through his promised word for the last
[50:21] days
[50:22] he promised us in the last days now if
[50:24] you're spiritual you catch it
[50:28] how can it be a dictatorship
[50:32] how can headship be dictatorship when
[50:34] christ in this quote whether i'm talking
[50:35] about christ is coming into his bride
[50:38] doing he's doing it
[50:43] the same works that he did already done
[50:46] did his past tense doing his present did
[50:49] his past
[50:50] at the beginning
[50:52] see christ true headship christ living
[50:55] through you what he expects of you
[50:59] but how do you get that continuity how
[51:03] do you get that perfection
[51:05] when you submit to christ
[51:08] when you come underneath
[51:10] full obedience to god's word
[51:14] full and total obedience
[51:17] so he will not ask you to go through
[51:19] something unless he has himself done it
[51:23] and he's not worried about his word
[51:25] coming to pass
[51:27] because he's doing it through you
[51:31] i was i
[51:33] was reading the quote friday night
[51:36] for the didiers he he plucked me from
[51:39] the
[51:40] free service and had me minister but
[51:43] where brother battle says that god
[51:45] christ has faith in his own word
[51:48] you are his word
[51:50] you are his word manifested we'll read
[51:52] another quote here a little bit later
[51:54] about that so he will he will not ask
[51:56] you to go through something unless he
[51:57] has himself done it so what is the
[52:01] vindication then that's the big thing
[52:03] vindication
[52:04] what's you know that's what people like
[52:06] to are getting into what is truth
[52:09] they're trying to get it to a place
[52:10] where there is no truth it's just all
[52:12] opinion and you can just pick and choose
[52:14] how you want your path to go
[52:17] the thing about this is that's in direct
[52:18] that's completely contrary to god's word
[52:22] we don't really get to choose
[52:24] what we want to do with our lives
[52:27] because we're underneath headship of
[52:29] christ you see we have a choice we have
[52:32] free moral agency
[52:34] to choose to submit to christ and when
[52:36] we do that then our life is ordered of
[52:38] the lord
[52:40] predestination though at the same time
[52:44] you will come under headship as a seat
[52:46] of christ
[52:47] that's a beautiful thing
[52:49] so what is the vindication of true
[52:51] headship we have perverted headship
[52:54] with a chris we see it different places
[52:56] you know pastors and and influential men
[52:59] have their own
[53:00] version
[53:01] that's just a man's idea but what where
[53:04] do we what is the vindication of true
[53:06] headship
[53:07] it's christ himself through his promised
[53:10] word amen right christ himself hebrews
[53:13] says vindicated he says he's talking
[53:16] about headship in this quote he says he
[53:18] says vindicated he's at the head and the
[53:21] body becoming one and then he says
[53:23] vindicated by god himself through his
[53:26] promised word for the last days so what
[53:29] does the word say about headship what
[53:32] does the word say about church what does
[53:33] the word say about marriage what does
[53:35] the word say about children what does
[53:37] the word say
[53:39] about these things and you line up with
[53:41] that word
[53:42] and you will find yourself living
[53:44] underneath the headship of christ which
[53:46] is the most beautiful place you can be
[53:48] brother preaches the message letting off
[53:51] the pressure
[53:52] where are you going to find a place to
[53:53] let off the pressure but under the
[53:55] headship of christ
[53:58] so we're defining headship that we're
[54:00] defining headship here anything contrary
[54:03] to that anything contrary to god's word
[54:05] and the headship of christ anything that
[54:08] pulls you from that position
[54:10] is antichrist
[54:12] no matter i want you to pay attention
[54:14] here no matter how small
[54:19] no matter how small
[54:22] it's god's word or it's not
[54:27] i prayed
[54:28] lord i want to come i got i'm preaching
[54:30] this i can't be a hypocrite pray lord i
[54:33] want to come even more
[54:35] under your headship even more submissive
[54:38] and obedient you know over the weekend
[54:40] it's just
[54:41] it's kind of hard for me to explain but
[54:43] it was just it was a very supernatural
[54:45] weekend for us
[54:46] god just just did a lot and uh just it's
[54:49] just special and some of it
[54:51] you know you can share some of it you
[54:53] can't it just you just it had it was for
[54:55] us let me put it that way
[54:57] but i even prayed where we should go for
[54:59] breakfast on monday
[55:01] because i began to think everything we
[55:04] do is according to will of god i had the
[55:06] desire friday night to stay through
[55:08] sunday evening and come back monday
[55:10] but our plan was to drive back sunday so
[55:12] i just prayed i said lord i don't want
[55:14] to do this if it's just my desire
[55:17] if it's yours make it obvious i prayed
[55:20] make it obvious and i kind of just moved
[55:23] on and
[55:24] and we're we got held up a little bit
[55:26] later visiting with my cousin and
[55:29] the next thing you know we got to go you
[55:30] know so we go to drive out of town and
[55:33] there was a funny rattle in the car and
[55:34] so my wife googled it and apparently it
[55:36] was the timing chain
[55:38] the rattle of death they called and i
[55:40] could see a storm over the past
[55:42] and we're just imagining breaking down
[55:43] the middle night
[55:45] with snow
[55:46] all around us so we we had to go return
[55:48] the car and that delayed us and then
[55:51] we said well we're not going to drive
[55:52] now it's too late and we ended up
[55:54] staying he made it obvious
[55:57] and we were we were greatly blessed so
[55:59] just coming into that place where it's
[56:01] like lord what what's your plan
[56:03] what's your program what i want to line
[56:05] up with that
[56:08] in uh 1965 deaf
[56:11] well 1960 but brown says what is the
[56:13] church the mystic body of christ
[56:16] who set it up the lord jesus himself
[56:19] it wasn't set up at rome neither was it
[56:22] set up in england by john wesley neither
[56:24] was it set up by calvin or in america
[56:26] the baptist by john smith neither was it
[56:29] set up in california by the pentecostals
[56:31] it was set up by jesus christ the king
[56:34] of the messianic kingdom
[56:36] that's who was set up by he is the king
[56:39] he wants to be the king
[56:41] he wants to rule us he wants to be lord
[56:45] and you return that expression say lord
[56:47] i want you to be my lord i want you to
[56:50] be my king he's not our president
[56:53] he's our king in other words absolute
[56:56] authority
[56:58] people let him in say
[57:00] i'll let him be my be savior but they
[57:03] won't let him be lord
[57:05] lord means ownership rulership come into
[57:08] my heart lord save me from hell but
[57:10] don't tell me what to do
[57:12] that's the attitude of the people
[57:15] some time ago i had i i i was thinking
[57:18] on this kind of similar thing and it was
[57:21] you know up front
[57:25] vashti wanted to be the king's wife
[57:28] to be the queen she wanted the benefits
[57:31] but when he called upon her
[57:34] she rejected his headship
[57:36] she said you know i want i want the
[57:38] riches and i want to be queen vashti but
[57:40] i don't want you to tell me what to do
[57:44] and so he put her away
[57:46] and got himself esther and we know she's
[57:49] the type of the bride
[57:51] see people they they want to have the
[57:53] you know it's a catastrophe that you
[57:55] know it's nice to have a man in a nice
[57:57] suit get up and pray over the nation
[58:00] until he says hey woman but anyways
[58:02] um
[58:03] right it's you know the catholic church
[58:06] and all this stuff it's pretty but as
[58:08] soon as god says
[58:10] as soon as it comes down to god telling
[58:12] them what to do they don't want any part
[58:14] of it that's what happened in the
[58:15] separation of brother madam's ministry
[58:17] when he lost lost all his contacts and
[58:19] his open doors it came down to the word
[58:23] and as soon as the word began to be
[58:25] preached
[58:27] which was christ himself
[58:29] i said oh we will take the healings but
[58:31] we don't want that
[58:32] that's right
[58:34] john 6 54 who so eateth my flesh and
[58:37] drinketh my blood hath eternal life and
[58:40] i will raise him up at the last day
[58:44] who so eateth my flesh and ring of my
[58:46] blood hath eternal life and i will raise
[58:48] him up at the last day in other words
[58:51] communion
[58:52] communion with christ and if you go
[58:56] in in first corinthians chapter 11
[58:59] it starts out it lays out and we're
[59:01] gonna did i skip that accidentally no
[59:04] okay
[59:05] we're going to read those more of those
[59:07] scriptures there don't don't don't jump
[59:08] to it just uh john 6 54.
[59:11] but we'll we'll read the rest of this in
[59:13] the first half of of of first
[59:15] corinthians chapter 11 paul lays out
[59:17] headship and and the man you know from
[59:19] the man is not of the woman but the
[59:20] woman of the man and all these things
[59:22] down through and then and then
[59:24] the second half of the scriptures
[59:26] communion
[59:28] for i ever see to the lord verse 23
[59:30] that which also i delivered unto you
[59:32] that the lord jesus the same night in
[59:33] which he was betrayed took bread
[59:35] you think that was by coincidence
[59:37] brother says the bible is perfect up to
[59:40] the periods and calmness
[59:44] what happens when you say lord i submit
[59:47] when you come into the words definition
[59:50] of headship what happens communion with
[59:53] christ
[59:54] that's why we have this scripture here
[59:56] he laid out the line he laid the word
[59:59] out it was time it's coming up to his
[1:00:01] crucifixion and the close of his
[1:00:03] ministry on earth and he lays the word
[1:00:06] out
[1:00:07] you must have communion with me or you
[1:00:10] have no part with me
[1:00:12] he lays it on the line in verse 66 from
[1:00:15] that time many of his disciples went
[1:00:17] back and walked no more with him i like
[1:00:20] how it says it didn't say went away it
[1:00:22] says they went back
[1:00:25] they went back
[1:00:28] they went they they couldn't accept the
[1:00:31] word which is the headship of christ
[1:00:34] they couldn't accept it and they turned
[1:00:37] and walked away from it they rejected
[1:00:39] the headship of christ but you see as
[1:00:42] you know communion with christ is such a
[1:00:45] beautiful thing
[1:00:47] but to achieve that to come to that
[1:00:49] place you have to accept the headship of
[1:00:52] christ you have to be in submission to
[1:00:55] his word
[1:00:56] and to the word of god there is no other
[1:00:59] way
[1:00:59] does it light up with the word
[1:01:02] if it does you accept it if it doesn't
[1:01:04] you move from that but as soon as you
[1:01:06] take a man's
[1:01:08] version of the word
[1:01:10] over christ you step out from the
[1:01:13] headship of christ
[1:01:16] but
[1:01:18] we're not going to end on a negative
[1:01:21] accepting the headship of christ
[1:01:26] in following
[1:01:28] we don't always understand
[1:01:31] but we should understand to always
[1:01:34] follow
[1:01:36] john 6 68 then simon peter answered him
[1:01:39] lord to whom shall we go
[1:01:41] thou hast the words of eternal life
[1:01:44] what was that why was peter allowed to
[1:01:46] say those things in his fallen state as
[1:01:48] a man
[1:01:49] vindication that it's the seed within us
[1:01:53] crying out lord we accept your word we
[1:01:56] don't understand it you think peter had
[1:01:57] it figured out right then no
[1:01:59] he was shocked right church split
[1:02:02] i mean not even 50 50.
[1:02:04] 70 12 or whatever
[1:02:08] right
[1:02:09] big day
[1:02:11] eat his flesh drink his blood i don't
[1:02:13] understand but
[1:02:15] lord you have eternal life
[1:02:20] i'll follow you even though don't always
[1:02:22] understand
[1:02:25] because i understand to always follow
[1:02:27] that's where people go off the mark
[1:02:29] saying to god
[1:02:30] they just say oh it's it's too hard of a
[1:02:32] saying
[1:02:35] how many times
[1:02:37] has has you ran into something in the
[1:02:38] word of god or just like that did not
[1:02:41] make sense
[1:02:42] but you know what
[1:02:44] like our pastor says show me something
[1:02:46] better
[1:02:48] show me something better there is
[1:02:50] nothing better
[1:02:51] and god is always faithful
[1:02:53] to reveal that to you
[1:02:56] if you need to know
[1:02:58] sometimes we don't need to know
[1:03:01] and i've had to wrestle with that saint
[1:03:02] to god i've had to wrestle with that
[1:03:05] questions i want answers i wanted and
[1:03:07] god spoke to my heart over the course of
[1:03:09] time
[1:03:10] and these simple words i i live my life
[1:03:12] buyer i say them all the time god is god
[1:03:14] and i am not
[1:03:18] sometimes we just have to rest right
[1:03:19] there
[1:03:20] we just have to put it there and move on
[1:03:24] so we when we were in part one we talked
[1:03:27] about elijah's author repair and this
[1:03:28] scripture came back to my remembrance
[1:03:30] first kings 18 30 and elijah said unto
[1:03:33] all the people come near unto me and all
[1:03:35] the people came near to him and he
[1:03:37] repaired this is at the mount carmel
[1:03:40] showdown and he repaired thee
[1:03:43] a altar the altar of the lord that was
[1:03:47] broken down
[1:03:50] now the altar of the lord was broken
[1:03:52] down in israel or the church in other
[1:03:55] words the headship had been denied
[1:03:58] the altar had fallen apart there were
[1:04:00] they have denied headship
[1:04:02] ahab was king
[1:04:04] and jezebel ruled the kingdom
[1:04:06] right jezebel had a dominating female
[1:04:08] spirit i mean it's pretty obvious the
[1:04:12] church was out from under the headship
[1:04:15] of christ there's quotes i was reading
[1:04:17] where brother brown says ahab went wrong
[1:04:19] when he married jezebel
[1:04:22] jezebel
[1:04:23] brought in
[1:04:25] the the the religion of baal and that
[1:04:28] religion you read the church age book
[1:04:29] down through it's still here today
[1:04:32] under the guise of the catholic church
[1:04:33] and now it's infiltrated into the
[1:04:36] the denominations
[1:04:37] but you look at where it started we
[1:04:40] don't need the headship of christ we
[1:04:42] don't need the headship of a man that
[1:04:43] was jezebel they say you know
[1:04:45] ah did what she said
[1:04:48] so you see that spirit
[1:04:50] right it's not people it's a spirit
[1:04:53] that dominating spirit broke down the
[1:04:55] altar of the lord
[1:04:56] that spirit pushed christ right out a
[1:04:59] man can have the same spirit when he
[1:05:01] says you know what my life doesn't line
[1:05:03] up but i'm going to do it anyways
[1:05:04] it doesn't line up with the word of god
[1:05:06] i'm going to do it anyways and you see a
[1:05:07] reflection if it's a pastor you see the
[1:05:09] reflection in his church that spirit if
[1:05:12] it's a family a husband you see that
[1:05:15] reflection in his in his wife and his
[1:05:17] children they say what's wrong
[1:05:20] why is she you know why is she like that
[1:05:22] he's not underneath the headship of
[1:05:24] christ
[1:05:27] it's a direct reflection
[1:05:31] you see but
[1:05:32] but here's the thing because i wrote
[1:05:34] this down and and i don't know if i if i
[1:05:36] copied what i wrote down exactly over
[1:05:38] but i was sitting in the back there
[1:05:40] brother our pastor was ministering or i
[1:05:42] can't remember exactly who and i just
[1:05:44] was had these notes on headship and and
[1:05:46] it's a strong subject saying to god it's
[1:05:48] a strong subject it's the line right
[1:05:50] it's the it's the drawing of the line
[1:05:53] and and i begin to think and it's the
[1:05:54] lord you know you're you're a god that
[1:05:56] that you desire to to pull us inside of
[1:05:59] you ever have them days where just you
[1:06:00] look at your wife and say i wish i could
[1:06:01] just pull you right inside of me
[1:06:03] he desires that kind of relationship
[1:06:05] that closeness and i said you know what
[1:06:07] there's these negative things about
[1:06:09] jezebel and the dominating female spirit
[1:06:11] but what happened in that time
[1:06:13] saints of god is christ came down under
[1:06:17] with this elijah anointed of christ came
[1:06:20] down representing christ to the church
[1:06:23] and repaired the altar
[1:06:26] amen
[1:06:27] he repaired y'all he said it's broken in
[1:06:29] my home god will come and repair it he
[1:06:32] said it's broken in this church god will
[1:06:34] come and repair it all you have to do is
[1:06:37] surrender to him and pray that god would
[1:06:40] come and do it because if you as a man
[1:06:43] go and fix it it's no different than it
[1:06:45] was before
[1:06:47] elijah a type of christ under the
[1:06:50] anointing of christ he repairs the altar
[1:06:53] testifying of today
[1:06:55] today sense of god in our midst when we
[1:06:58] see the two spirits operating within the
[1:07:00] framework of the church and we see the
[1:07:01] rejection of the headship of christ in
[1:07:04] favor
[1:07:05] of doing it the way of a man
[1:07:08] god is coming down and the main movement
[1:07:11] is going to be there and they're going
[1:07:12] to go off unfortunately
[1:07:14] they're going to go off
[1:07:16] but there's
[1:07:18] real people
[1:07:19] real families real churches caught in
[1:07:22] that
[1:07:23] divide
[1:07:24] and they might be going off now
[1:07:27] but god's going to come and repair the
[1:07:29] altar
[1:07:30] god has given us a spoken word
[1:07:33] amen god is going to come and prepare
[1:07:36] the altar
[1:07:37] in your family
[1:07:39] and in the churches
[1:07:42] praise god
[1:07:43] that is where you find true unity in the
[1:07:46] bride of christ
[1:07:48] you see you can't create unity
[1:07:51] no meetings
[1:07:53] nothing is going to create unity
[1:07:56] because that's a man
[1:07:58] you say oh i have it figured out this is
[1:07:59] the perfect location you know you pick
[1:08:01] some central location in the united
[1:08:03] states this is it
[1:08:05] i don't know where that is but
[1:08:07] this is the place and we'll have a
[1:08:09] week-long meetings and we'll do a tent
[1:08:10] because a lot of people agree on a tent
[1:08:12] and
[1:08:13] and uh we'll get these ministers because
[1:08:14] a lot of people agree on these ministers
[1:08:16] and we'll get these ministers because a
[1:08:17] lot of people agree on these ministers
[1:08:18] and we'll bring it all to
[1:08:20] what are you doing you're hewing stone
[1:08:23] that's it
[1:08:24] you're cutting stone
[1:08:26] now god is going to lay it on on your
[1:08:27] hearts to have meetings there's nothing
[1:08:29] wrong with that i'm not saying that i'm
[1:08:30] saying if you're trying to bring unity
[1:08:33] bring these people all these people
[1:08:34] together all you're doing is hewing
[1:08:36] stones and the bible says that's not
[1:08:38] going to work
[1:08:42] praise the lord
[1:08:44] jezebel had a dominating spirit the
[1:08:46] church was out from the headship of
[1:08:47] christ the altar was torn down now the
[1:08:50] two altars right so what happened
[1:08:52] another altar rose up in the place of
[1:08:55] the altar of the lord the altar to baal
[1:08:58] and you can go back and you can read the
[1:09:00] sin of jeroboam
[1:09:02] what did he do he took and he went off
[1:09:04] and he started his own israel his own
[1:09:07] church
[1:09:09] and the sins of jeroboam worked its way
[1:09:11] down to generation through generation
[1:09:13] until a man by the name of josiah came
[1:09:15] up
[1:09:16] see god came that sin of jeroboam
[1:09:19] lingered even through good kings but god
[1:09:21] came up
[1:09:23] and repaired the altar of the lord
[1:09:25] underneath the ministry of elijah and
[1:09:26] josiah when he tore down those altars
[1:09:30] so the altar of bell had risen in the
[1:09:31] place but god came down and fixed that
[1:09:34] and brought the church back under the
[1:09:36] headship of christ
[1:09:38] now there's a quote here brother brown
[1:09:39] says joseph meeting his brother in 1956.
[1:09:42] he says one man wrote a poet wrote my
[1:09:45] anchor holds within the veil
[1:09:47] what is a veil
[1:09:49] it's something that we're getting to the
[1:09:51] to the the point
[1:09:53] that shuts off here from there and the
[1:09:55] anchor is on the inside of the veil
[1:09:58] the anchor is on the inside of the veil
[1:10:00] we read it here in
[1:10:04] it was in hebrews chapter six
[1:10:08] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[1:10:10] soul both sure and steadfast and which
[1:10:12] entereth into that within the veil
[1:10:15] acres of the inside of the veil you
[1:10:17] don't see how it's going to be but you
[1:10:18] know that there's something that's got a
[1:10:20] hold of you that's got a hold up there
[1:10:22] well we know what it is now because the
[1:10:24] word has been opened unto us
[1:10:27] we can see we can go inside that veil
[1:10:29] we're talking about the anchor is it
[1:10:31] holds within the veil the world can't
[1:10:32] see it the world doesn't get it how do
[1:10:34] you do it how does your family stay so
[1:10:36] strong how do you how do women stay
[1:10:37] modest
[1:10:38] how do you young men and young women
[1:10:40] stay pure up to marriage how do you do
[1:10:42] it there's an anchor holding that they
[1:10:43] can't see
[1:10:46] first corinthians 11 chapter four
[1:10:49] turn with me there
[1:11:00] familiar section of scripture about a
[1:11:02] woman in her long hair but this is not a
[1:11:04] sermon
[1:11:06] about modesty
[1:11:09] like i said sometimes
[1:11:10] we
[1:11:11] actually let me say this
[1:11:13] we are called to look between the lines
[1:11:15] and see what god's trying to say
[1:11:19] because we line up on the outside but
[1:11:21] but it's not it's not necessarily the
[1:11:23] long hair
[1:11:25] it's the representation of what that is
[1:11:30] verse 4 every man praying or prophesying
[1:11:32] having his head covereth this honoreth
[1:11:34] his head but every woman that prayeth or
[1:11:36] prophesy with her head uncovered with
[1:11:39] her head for that is even all one as if
[1:11:42] she were shaven for if the woman be not
[1:11:44] covered let her also be shorn but if it
[1:11:47] would be a shame for for a woman to be
[1:11:49] shorn or shaven let her be cuffed in
[1:11:51] other words it's a shame for her to be
[1:11:52] shaven so just don't cut your hair
[1:11:54] for a woman indeed ought not to cover a
[1:11:57] man indeed ought not to cover his head
[1:11:59] for as much as he is the image and the
[1:12:02] glory and glory of god but the woman is
[1:12:04] the glory of the man
[1:12:06] for the man is not of the woman but the
[1:12:07] woman of the man that's
[1:12:09] said in order at the beginning of
[1:12:10] creation he god took eve from adam
[1:12:14] neither was the man created for the
[1:12:16] woman but the woman for the man for this
[1:12:17] cause ought the woman to have power on
[1:12:20] her head because of the angels go read
[1:12:23] in the message but the brown says that's
[1:12:24] lowercase a it's men
[1:12:26] angels is men in the scripture
[1:12:29] so
[1:12:31] the for this cause in other words a
[1:12:33] woman with long hair should have power
[1:12:36] in her head find power underneath the
[1:12:38] headship of of her man that god has
[1:12:41] given her underneath that headship
[1:12:42] that's where a woman finds her power
[1:12:44] where do we as the bible jesus christ
[1:12:45] find our power
[1:12:47] under the headship of christ you see
[1:12:49] we've moved now
[1:12:51] tonight we've moved we're talking about
[1:12:52] the woman we're talking about the bride
[1:12:54] you
[1:12:55] you men you women all included tonight
[1:12:57] and the women
[1:12:59] nevertheless neither is the man without
[1:13:00] the woman
[1:13:01] neither the woman without the man in the
[1:13:03] lord
[1:13:05] we are nothing without christ
[1:13:09] christ's desire to have us to make him
[1:13:12] god
[1:13:14] he is complete with us and we are
[1:13:16] complete with him
[1:13:19] for as the
[1:13:21] woman is of the man even so is the man
[1:13:23] also by the woman but all things of god
[1:13:26] judge in yourself is it calmly that a
[1:13:28] woman pray unto god uncovered
[1:13:30] does not even nature itself teach you
[1:13:32] that if a man have long hair it is a
[1:13:33] shame unto him
[1:13:35] but if a woman have long hair it is a
[1:13:37] glory to her a glory to her
[1:13:40] for her hair is given her for a covering
[1:13:43] the hair is the covering but if any man
[1:13:45] seem to be
[1:13:47] contentious we have no such custom net
[1:13:49] of the churches of god
[1:13:51] i was supposed to stop in verse 15. so
[1:13:54] covering the hair the long hair is given
[1:13:56] for to the woman for a covering a
[1:13:59] covering in this scripture is a mantle
[1:14:01] of veil
[1:14:03] a rapper
[1:14:06] having conferences 1960 so men all down
[1:14:09] through the age has stumbled at that so
[1:14:11] simple just accept the blood you can't
[1:14:14] cover yourself
[1:14:16] take god's covering
[1:14:20] you can't learn how to do it there's no
[1:14:22] learning about it god does it himself
[1:14:25] it's supernatural
[1:14:26] it's through life god does the covering
[1:14:30] you can't do it what happens when a
[1:14:33] woman
[1:14:35] say let's use the example leaves a
[1:14:36] message what is one of the first things
[1:14:38] that she does she chops her hair off
[1:14:43] they say almost you know she thinks
[1:14:44] she's her own person now and all these
[1:14:46] things but she the spirit within us
[1:14:48] within her has risen to the surface and
[1:14:51] you see the very the very thing
[1:14:53] testifying
[1:14:55] denying of headship
[1:14:57] we as children of god as the bride of
[1:15:00] christ have been given a covering
[1:15:03] the covering of christ
[1:15:06] our veil
[1:15:08] which is where the anchor holds
[1:15:11] the anchor holds within the veil for the
[1:15:13] panel says i actually i i came across
[1:15:16] that and just left out of the page to me
[1:15:18] obviously the lord it was the heart of
[1:15:20] the lord's thing and i i
[1:15:22] i uh what does it use the quotes and i
[1:15:25] strict word
[1:15:26] searched anchor holds within the veil
[1:15:28] and he says he says those exact words 15
[1:15:31] times
[1:15:32] anchor holds within the veil and i just
[1:15:34] begin to think that covering a woman's
[1:15:36] long hair is given to her as a covering
[1:15:38] which is a veil we are given the word of
[1:15:40] christ and when we're under the headship
[1:15:43] we're underneath that covering
[1:15:45] and that's where our anchor holds
[1:15:48] our anchor holds under the headship of
[1:15:50] christ
[1:15:51] we cannot do without the covering we
[1:15:53] cannot serve god we cannot we cannot
[1:15:56] lift up our voices in prayer unless we
[1:15:59] are underneath that cover
[1:16:01] are your prayers hindered
[1:16:03] are you under the covering as a man you
[1:16:06] say well i'm a man you know i gotta have
[1:16:08] short hair yeah but you're the bride of
[1:16:11] christ
[1:16:12] you have to see we're reading between
[1:16:14] the lines here
[1:16:17] praise the lord it was within the veil
[1:16:19] that our anchor holds and what is behind
[1:16:21] that veil
[1:16:22] christ
[1:16:23] you
[1:16:25] are christ's veil but christ is veiled
[1:16:28] within you to this generation
[1:16:32] it's a secret thing was there was there
[1:16:34] was silence in heaven
[1:16:38] how does it work how do you do it
[1:16:41] it's christ
[1:16:42] anchor holds within the veil the only
[1:16:45] way to get behind that covering is to
[1:16:47] come under the headship of christ
[1:16:51] total submission or obedience
[1:16:54] the token 1964. and you
[1:16:56] some of you probably knew this was
[1:16:57] coming full obedience to the full word
[1:16:59] of god entitles us to the token
[1:17:02] what is the token escape from death what
[1:17:04] is death eternal separation from god
[1:17:09] full obedience is the full word of god
[1:17:11] of the full order to the full word of
[1:17:12] god entitles us to the token no other
[1:17:15] way is there
[1:17:16] that you could ever be entitled to the
[1:17:18] token
[1:17:20] interesting he uses the word entitled
[1:17:22] there's a lot of entitled people in the
[1:17:24] world today
[1:17:27] they have the perverted version
[1:17:30] but as the bride of christ you have the
[1:17:32] true version
[1:17:34] you say lord
[1:17:37] the situation is like this
[1:17:39] but you promised
[1:17:41] the token is mine
[1:17:44] amen
[1:17:45] he loves to see you take up that that's
[1:17:48] that's faith with some skin on it
[1:17:51] that's a burly man that's a that's a
[1:17:53] strong woman god
[1:17:56] yes that's okay to say
[1:17:59] that's having faith
[1:18:01] you say lord and he it makes him so
[1:18:03] proud job said i don't know what's going
[1:18:06] on i don't know how it's gonna work but
[1:18:07] i'm gonna follow you
[1:18:09] peter said lord i don't understand it's
[1:18:11] your flesh doesn't make any sense to me
[1:18:13] but where can i go
[1:18:16] he submitted
[1:18:18] and god gave christ gave him the keys to
[1:18:20] the kingdom
[1:18:22] recognition of his because it went when
[1:18:24] it came to that peter you know right
[1:18:25] there
[1:18:26] submitting
[1:18:29] but see what happened when peter made
[1:18:30] his conversion
[1:18:34] he required an open submission to god's
[1:18:37] word
[1:18:38] no i'm just not you know in the closet
[1:18:40] it's easy to say
[1:18:42] right i submit in church with like
[1:18:45] with with other believers easy to say i
[1:18:47] submit
[1:18:48] but when it comes down to you acting
[1:18:50] upon the word of god
[1:18:51] when there is no music when there is no
[1:18:54] anointing
[1:18:56] present so to speak
[1:18:58] that's when you need faith
[1:19:01] with muscles in it with muscles
[1:19:04] he says you can be entitled until you
[1:19:05] fully obey the word not what somebody
[1:19:08] has put into it capital i
[1:19:11] and added to it but what god said about
[1:19:15] it
[1:19:17] not a man's idea but what god said about
[1:19:20] it
[1:19:23] so full obedience the token the token is
[1:19:26] what is the holy spirit
[1:19:29] is that ticket
[1:19:31] but the only way to come to that
[1:19:33] position
[1:19:34] is to full obedience of the word of god
[1:19:36] full submission to the headship of
[1:19:38] christ
[1:19:40] underneath your covering amen
[1:19:42] now there's a story in the bible very
[1:19:44] familiar to us
[1:19:46] about a woman named rahab
[1:19:49] 2 18 behold when we come into the land
[1:19:51] the spies now are speaking to ray had
[1:19:52] the rahab joshua sent the spies across
[1:19:55] the river jordan
[1:19:57] he said go spy out the lands or they go
[1:19:59] to jericho and and um
[1:20:01] they meet up with rahab right like i
[1:20:04] think it was
[1:20:05] paul
[1:20:07] the spirit's connected there's no
[1:20:09] fishiness going on there
[1:20:14] and so they go she hides them and then
[1:20:16] and then here's the thing that i just
[1:20:19] jumped out to me
[1:20:20] they don't even tell her to put the
[1:20:22] scarlet thread out her window until
[1:20:24] she's already lowered them down
[1:20:26] by the said same cord
[1:20:30] she's already acting
[1:20:33] on the word to come
[1:20:36] she's in motion
[1:20:39] abraham was given circumcision as a sign
[1:20:42] of his faith
[1:20:43] he was already in motion and god said i
[1:20:46] recognize your faith abraham
[1:20:48] so she's in motion she lowers them down
[1:20:51] and she says look make a promise that i
[1:20:53] will my i will be spared and they said
[1:20:56] behold when we come into the land thou
[1:20:58] shalt bind this line of scarlet thread
[1:21:00] in the window which thou that has led us
[1:21:03] down by and thou shalt bring thy father
[1:21:06] you see what did that cord do when it
[1:21:08] let them down it let those servants
[1:21:11] those men in to freedom
[1:21:15] full obedience to god's word will lead
[1:21:17] you into freedom
[1:21:19] so now they say look
[1:21:21] go ahead and hang this core it's visible
[1:21:23] people saw it
[1:21:26] hang this cord out friend that shall
[1:21:28] bring thy father and thy mother and thy
[1:21:30] brethren all thy father's household home
[1:21:32] unto thee in other words whoever's in
[1:21:34] the house
[1:21:35] will be saved
[1:21:39] praise the lord you can reply that to
[1:21:40] your home
[1:21:42] whoever's in this house
[1:21:44] will be saved
[1:21:46] but to your life this house
[1:21:49] will be saved
[1:21:50] and so as the story goes they marched
[1:21:52] around the walls of jericho and they
[1:21:54] blew the trumpets and they shouted on
[1:21:55] the seventh day after walking around
[1:21:58] seven times and victory came to the
[1:22:00] children of israel to the church and the
[1:22:02] walls fell down and here is rahab's home
[1:22:05] still standing untouched
[1:22:07] unfazed a dish didn't even fall off the
[1:22:09] shelf
[1:22:11] so how do you know that because god
[1:22:12] doesn't do anything halfway that's right
[1:22:15] amen
[1:22:17] chapter 6 25 and joshua saved rahab the
[1:22:20] harlot alive
[1:22:22] interesting that it puts there puts that
[1:22:25] in the scripture nothing is in the
[1:22:26] scripture by chance joshua is the type
[1:22:29] of christ
[1:22:30] joshua saved rahab the harlot alive
[1:22:35] christ saved you
[1:22:37] alive
[1:22:38] and her father's household and all that
[1:22:40] she had and she dwelleth in israel even
[1:22:43] unto this day because she hid the
[1:22:45] messengers which joshua sent to spy out
[1:22:47] jericho
[1:22:49] was it the cord
[1:22:52] no
[1:22:53] the core didn't save her
[1:22:55] it was her obedience to the word of god
[1:23:00] that came from the servant's mouth
[1:23:02] the obedience to god's word and brother
[1:23:04] brown says in his quote here fellowship
[1:23:06] by redemption 1955 and also read in the
[1:23:08] bible is a covering red is an atonement
[1:23:11] red is safety you remember when the
[1:23:13] harlot rahab let the spies down on the
[1:23:15] red string to safety
[1:23:16] always safety under red now the blood is
[1:23:18] red
[1:23:19] so she came under the headship of christ
[1:23:22] when she hung that cord out her window
[1:23:24] and through that submission to god's
[1:23:27] word
[1:23:29] she
[1:23:30] got the token protection and be and
[1:23:33] through that even as a gentile she found
[1:23:36] position in the church of god israel at
[1:23:39] the time
[1:23:41] so she came under the headship
[1:23:43] and it was a sign that cord was just a
[1:23:46] sign that spoke of her heart
[1:23:49] she was willing
[1:23:51] for there to be in the to come under the
[1:23:53] absolute immutable hedgehog of christ
[1:23:55] she was willing to submit to the word of
[1:23:57] god so have full obedience to god's word
[1:24:01] you see long hair alone means nothing it
[1:24:03] is a woman's glory it's a sign given by
[1:24:05] the lord it's what god said look i want
[1:24:07] this this is what i desire in a woman
[1:24:09] with the right heart
[1:24:11] doesn't want anything else but that
[1:24:14] it shows the heart of the woman desiring
[1:24:15] to be under headship she may not realize
[1:24:18] it at a young age that that her desire
[1:24:20] for long hair means she desires to be
[1:24:21] under the headship of the word but as
[1:24:23] she matures in christ she'll come to
[1:24:25] that position where she realized it's
[1:24:27] that deep calling out to the deep with
[1:24:29] the deep to respond amen when you live
[1:24:31] in your life there's been situations and
[1:24:33] times where you just did something this
[1:24:34] way and realized later on it was god you
[1:24:37] just fell right into the headship of
[1:24:38] christ and he he led you right through
[1:24:40] that situation
[1:24:42] but from this victory that rahab has and
[1:24:45] this is just stirs my heart
[1:24:48] rahab is delivered and saved by joshua
[1:24:50] type of christ
[1:24:52] and if you go and you read later on down
[1:24:54] in the bible
[1:24:56] well first of all her submission brought
[1:24:57] her redemption
[1:25:00] matthew one verse five and salman begot
[1:25:02] boaz of roychab rahab and boaz begat
[1:25:05] obed of ruth and obed begat jesse
[1:25:08] solem salman means a garment
[1:25:12] so when rahab submitted to the word of
[1:25:14] god she found her covering
[1:25:17] in salman
[1:25:19] and she went in and she married salman
[1:25:21] that you have found in christ amen
[1:25:23] brings a relationship behind the veil
[1:25:27] a relationship it's hid it's a secret
[1:25:30] it's you and god and no one else in the
[1:25:32] middle it's you and god and that brings
[1:25:35] forth the promised language boaz as a
[1:25:37] type of christ
[1:25:39] praise the lord
[1:25:40] coming down here shortly i i almost said
[1:25:43] the beginning that this sermon may be
[1:25:45] the undoing of my
[1:25:47] short preaching uh reputation
[1:25:51] but i don't care hey it's short it's
[1:25:54] long it doesn't matter to me
[1:25:56] it's just the word of god
[1:25:58] second kings chapter 2
[1:26:00] verse 8.
[1:26:02] so rahab found her covering
[1:26:05] a woman finds her covering when she has
[1:26:06] long hair it all means
[1:26:08] under the headship that's what the
[1:26:10] covering means
[1:26:12] you come into the headship of christ you
[1:26:13] are covered
[1:26:14] you're wrapped in his word
[1:26:16] so second kings chapter 2
[1:26:19] verse 8.
[1:26:22] we're going to read here
[1:26:23] where elijah follows elijah
[1:26:26] to the river jordan
[1:26:28] a promise of a new life
[1:26:31] so they cross the river well i'm going
[1:26:33] to get in myself chapter verse 8 and
[1:26:35] elijah took his mantle and wrapped it
[1:26:37] together
[1:26:38] the covering mantle amen
[1:26:41] and
[1:26:42] smote the waters and they were divided
[1:26:44] together into there so that they too
[1:26:46] went over on dry ground now
[1:26:48] there's some there's 50 men of the sons
[1:26:50] of the prophets on the other side they
[1:26:52] stay on the other side they're watching
[1:26:54] you see it was just elijah and elisha
[1:26:57] when you cross that river jordan
[1:27:00] it's just you and god
[1:27:03] and how do you access the other side of
[1:27:06] jordan
[1:27:08] by the covering of god's word
[1:27:11] god's word has to split the waters for
[1:27:14] you for you to walk across on dry ground
[1:27:17] you see there's nothing muddied
[1:27:19] there in that transition it's clear
[1:27:21] revelation
[1:27:23] you know what you're doing you're
[1:27:24] accepting christ you leave those people
[1:27:26] behind
[1:27:28] and it's just you and god across on dry
[1:27:30] ground now it comes to the other side
[1:27:32] elisha is the type of the bride elijah
[1:27:34] is the type of christ and it came to
[1:27:36] pass when they were gone over that
[1:27:37] elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall
[1:27:39] do for thee
[1:27:40] ask and it shall be given unto thee
[1:27:43] before i be taken away from thee and
[1:27:46] elijah said now if you go and you you
[1:27:47] read
[1:27:49] christ he comes vote
[1:27:51] and he he dies on calvary he's rosen
[1:27:53] again but he has to ascend up
[1:27:57] so that the ministry can continue
[1:28:01] in the disciples they have to go sit and
[1:28:03] wait in the upper room to receive the
[1:28:05] holy spirit you see christ had to go up
[1:28:08] so that the ministry could could
[1:28:10] continue now elijah has to go up so that
[1:28:12] the ministry can't continue now elisha
[1:28:15] you as a right underneath that anointing
[1:28:19] underneath the anointing underneath the
[1:28:20] headship of christ the only thing that
[1:28:23] can come out of your mouth is wherever
[1:28:24] else should we go
[1:28:26] he says let a double portion of thy
[1:28:29] spirit be upon me
[1:28:31] what does the brother branham say
[1:28:33] at first he said greater works as in
[1:28:35] more but then they came and they
[1:28:36] corrected that he says greater works as
[1:28:38] in speaking
[1:28:40] something into existence out of nothing
[1:28:44] is the third pool
[1:28:46] so we have a double portion if you will
[1:28:50] of thy spirit be upon me and he said
[1:28:52] thou hast asked a hard thing
[1:28:54] nevertheless if thou see me
[1:28:57] always eyes on christ
[1:29:02] always your eyes on christ
[1:29:06] not
[1:29:07] the prophet
[1:29:09] christ
[1:29:11] elisha had to watch
[1:29:13] the word and the move that the word made
[1:29:15] it christ made if thou see me when i am
[1:29:17] taken from thee it shall be so unto thee
[1:29:19] but if not it shall not be so and it
[1:29:22] came to pass as they still went on and
[1:29:23] talked that behold so now they're just
[1:29:25] walking and fellowshipping
[1:29:28] on the other side of jordan
[1:29:30] that's where you find fellowship with
[1:29:31] christ
[1:29:34] that behold there appeared a chariot of
[1:29:36] fire and horses of fire
[1:29:38] and parted them both asunder
[1:29:41] and elijah went up by a whirlwind into
[1:29:44] heaven and elisha sought and he cried my
[1:29:46] father my father the chariot of israel
[1:29:47] the horsemen thereof and he saw him no
[1:29:49] more and he took hold of his own clothes
[1:29:52] and rent them in two pieces
[1:29:54] all righteousnesses but filthy rags we
[1:29:57] lay aside
[1:29:58] our own
[1:30:00] garment
[1:30:01] and we accept the mantle the covering of
[1:30:04] christ
[1:30:06] headship
[1:30:07] he took up also the mantle of elijah
[1:30:10] that fell from him and went back and
[1:30:12] stood by the bank of jordan he stood he
[1:30:14] stopped
[1:30:17] he stopped
[1:30:18] and he's looking at the river jordan
[1:30:21] and he's saying
[1:30:23] well i gotta cross the river jordan
[1:30:26] i've got a cross to get access
[1:30:29] the word
[1:30:31] brought me
[1:30:32] here
[1:30:33] the word will take you home
[1:30:36] so elisha elijah takes elisha takes the
[1:30:39] mantle and he says where is the lord god
[1:30:42] of elijah
[1:30:44] and when he had also smitten the water
[1:30:47] so he says where is the god of elijah
[1:30:49] and he smites the waters
[1:30:51] he
[1:30:52] took action
[1:30:54] and through entitlement said where's the
[1:30:56] god of elijah they say that's an
[1:30:58] arrogant spirit no it's not it's
[1:31:00] confidence it's confidence that he had
[1:31:03] faith in god's word and he smites the
[1:31:06] waters in faith he went into action and
[1:31:10] then god responded by dividing the
[1:31:12] waters and he walked across
[1:31:14] and he went over on dry land
[1:31:18] you see
[1:31:19] here's here we go this is just a quote
[1:31:21] here where banana says well elijah was a
[1:31:24] type of christ being translated and
[1:31:25] elijah was a type of the church that was
[1:31:27] to take his
[1:31:28] place and finish his ministry with a
[1:31:32] double portion
[1:31:34] finished his ministry continuing of the
[1:31:36] word but the only way for that to happen
[1:31:39] was if elisha took the mantle
[1:31:42] of
[1:31:42] elijah type of christ and clothed
[1:31:45] himself in the word fully submitted to
[1:31:48] the word of god then that brought forth
[1:31:51] a ministry that brought deliverance that
[1:31:53] brought healing that brought
[1:31:55] all kinds of things that healed the
[1:31:57] waters the first miracle he does is he
[1:31:59] goes back and they say hey the waters
[1:32:01] are are messed up here they're bitter or
[1:32:04] whatever it says that they were they
[1:32:05] were poisoned basically
[1:32:07] and he just says
[1:32:09] he didn't he doesn't stop and pray or or
[1:32:11] go seek no he just spoken word says go
[1:32:13] get that put that in the water
[1:32:16] you see
[1:32:17] he knew who he was
[1:32:20] he knew who he was
[1:32:23] but we are called the bride is called to
[1:32:25] finish the ministry of christ a
[1:32:28] continuing of the word
[1:32:32] where is the god of elijah he says
[1:32:35] not where is elijah
[1:32:40] see you go and read it and you can
[1:32:42] preach about that the prophets the sons
[1:32:44] of the prophets go looking
[1:32:46] for elijah's body they go back for the
[1:32:48] return ministry but i just elisha says
[1:32:50] look i told you you wouldn't find him
[1:32:53] see it continuing where is the god of
[1:32:55] elijah
[1:32:57] the anointing of elijah christ was
[1:32:58] handed down to the bride praise the lord
[1:33:02] amen without
[1:33:04] accepting the covering of the word
[1:33:08] the crossing of jordan is not possible
[1:33:11] amen you need if you want to cross into
[1:33:14] the full promises of god's word god's
[1:33:16] word if you want to cross
[1:33:17] the river jordan of death into glory
[1:33:20] you have to be underneath the headship
[1:33:23] of christ you have to have the covering
[1:33:24] of christ full obedience
[1:33:27] amen i think we have said it already
[1:33:30] headship amen under christ is the
[1:33:32] bride's covering god's word
[1:33:35] true headship
[1:33:36] of god's word is the covering of the
[1:33:39] bride
[1:33:41] amen praise the lord
[1:33:43] physicians want to come tonight
[1:33:48] it's a beautiful type of christ and his
[1:33:50] bride these scriptures of headship and
[1:33:53] these things about the long hair
[1:33:55] it's more than just modesty for a young
[1:33:57] woman or an older woman
[1:34:00] it's more than that it's god
[1:34:02] speaking to his bride here's what i want
[1:34:05] you to do i want you to line up with my
[1:34:07] word i want you in the full obedience
[1:34:09] it's a beautiful type of christ in his
[1:34:11] bride
[1:34:12] first corinthians 11 7 be if you will
[1:34:15] the second half of the scripture but the
[1:34:16] woman is the glory of the man you
[1:34:19] are the glory of christ
[1:34:22] you
[1:34:23] are the glory
[1:34:25] glorified
[1:34:28] expression of christ to this generation

[1:34:40] the bride is the glory of christ
[1:34:43] your image is an expression of his glory
[1:34:46] second corinthians 3 16-17 nevertheless
[1:34:49] when it shall turn to the lord the veil
[1:34:52] shall be taken away
[1:34:55] has the word been unveiled
[1:34:58] without that unveiling there's no
[1:35:00] receiving of the word seed
[1:35:04] now the lord is that spirit
[1:35:07] and where the spirit of the lord is
[1:35:09] there is liberty
[1:35:12] they're looking and they're crying for a
[1:35:15] man
[1:35:17] but what they don't realize is
[1:35:20] what they want is a man who will come
[1:35:21] under the headship of christ
[1:35:23] they think they have freedom
[1:35:25] you think you have freedom in doing it
[1:35:27] your way but you're the greatest liberty
[1:35:30] you can ever come to
[1:35:32] is when you fall under total headshift
[1:35:34] to christ
[1:35:36] that is where you find freedom you see
[1:35:38] you have to give
[1:35:40] your freedom away
[1:35:43] to receive
[1:35:44] true unperverted freedom
[1:35:47] you have to give of yourself total
[1:35:49] surrender to christ
[1:35:51] and when you do that that is where you
[1:35:53] find your greatest victory
