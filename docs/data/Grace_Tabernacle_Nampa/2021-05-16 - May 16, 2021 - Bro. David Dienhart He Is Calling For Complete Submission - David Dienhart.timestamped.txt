[43:56] mercy
[43:58] we had a song song when we someday
[44:01] thought i might have a sing this morning
[44:02] and i didn't but i don't know if even
[44:04] jade knows it but
[44:06] we had a song and our wedding sung and
[44:07] it's always been our
[44:09] our theme all the way through marriage
[44:11] with savior like a shepherd lead us

[44:22] i hope he's that way with you he's our
[44:25] shepherd
[44:26] he's lit us perfectly in his way the
[44:29] bible said is perfect but it also says
[44:31] one or verse two verses down he had made
[44:33] your way perfect
[44:35] and that's psalms 18. can you imagine

[48:24] predestinated lord here
[48:26] sitting here this morning will be lord
[48:29] be able to look
[48:30] full into your wonderful face and see
[48:33] the hour therein and see the time and
[48:35] the promise
[48:36] that they are now fulfilling we pray

[48:41] name
[48:42] amen say you are fulfilling oh yes

[48:51] scripture
[48:52] the word of promise amen turn with me in
[48:56] your bibles to genesis 18.
[48:58] i want to title this he's calling for
[49:01] complete and i want you to notice i'm
[49:03] not just missing words here this this
[49:06] was very inspired on me
[49:08] and i i felt to bring it i was thinking
[49:10] of bringing it
[49:11] the wednesday last i ministered and i
[49:13] just i was stopped and said bring it
[49:15] this morning and i told brother
[49:17] brother chris what he preached on
[49:18] wednesday was wonderful it went right
[49:20] with it
[49:21] and you'll see that and god's trying to
[49:23] get something across to you brother
[49:24] sister i think we ought to be
[49:26] all attention we can to what he's
[49:27] speaking not because i'm speaking it
[49:29] because
[49:30] or paul's speaking or chris speaking
[49:32] it's god speaking
[49:35] and he's speaking through your life if
[49:37] you let him do it he's working through
[49:38] you if you let him do it
[49:40] you got to let him do it you say do i
[49:42] have to let him do it oh yes
[49:43] he won't force his way in
[49:47] so god is calling he's calling
[49:50] for your complete submission not to your
[49:54] thinking not to your intellectual
[49:55] knowledge
[49:56] not to your ideas quit trying to figure
[49:58] the message out and let go and let god
[50:00] reveal it as he wants to
[50:02] to you individually
[50:08] get out of your own thinking and die to
[50:09] yourself
[50:11] you'll never learn god you'll never
[50:14] learning by
[50:15] by by your intellectual study and trying
[50:17] to figure out words and
[50:20] scriptures that's a bunch of nonsense
[50:22] let god reveal it it's hid
[50:23] there for you if you'll just let him do
[50:26] it
[50:27] it calls for submission
[50:30] amen all right and that and i'm saying
[50:34] calling for
[50:34] your individual submission
[50:37] this is not a group affair and i'm going
[50:39] to come back that word affair just a
[50:40] little knowledge
[50:41] help you catch it while i'm in the
[50:42] ministry this morning but it's
[50:44] it's a it's an it's not an a group
[50:47] affair it's an individual
[50:48] affair let me just say right now
[50:52] it's a love affair
[50:56] brother branham said over and over again
[50:57] it's an individual affair
[51:00] and he called it a love affair
[51:04] amen so so he wants
[51:08] your undivided attention to be on him
[51:12] he's your head and he's your husband
[51:16] i'm talking to the bride this morning
[51:18] not my place to say who is and who isn't
[51:20] i'm talking to the bride this morning
[51:24] he's talking to the bride this morning
[51:28] a dependency on him alone
[51:32] he wants dependency not independent
[51:34] you're not independent
[51:36] you're dependent upon him alone just as
[51:38] the wife would be to her husband she
[51:40] doesn't go out here and marry a man and
[51:42] then say well i'm independent
[51:44] she's not independent she has a head
[51:46] that she's submitted to
[51:48] if she really loves him she'll submit to
[51:50] his headship
[51:52] and if she really loves if he really
[51:54] loves her he'll
[51:55] give himself as christ did for the
[51:57] church
[51:58] not to every little whim you've got
[52:00] every not every little every little
[52:02] every little uh thing you want to show
[52:04] off on your on your
[52:06] on your tantrums
[52:09] he's not going to give in to that but he
[52:11] has the will of god he knows the not has
[52:13] the knowledge and understanding of god
[52:15] to be ahead
[52:16] amen and you're submitting yourself to
[52:19] him i'm talking in the
[52:21] spiritual now context i'm not making fun
[52:24] of you and your sister between you and
[52:25] your husband
[52:26] but i'm telling you that right amen
[52:29] because paul and all that he said i'm
[52:31] speaking of christ in the church
[52:34] amen right bringing it right back typing
[52:36] it with the natural
[52:37] husband and wife remember who you
[52:41] represent
[52:42] and you men remember who you represent
[52:46] amen that will bring the marriage under
[52:48] the right context
[52:50] all right so he does not want
[52:54] an a divided attention he does not want
[52:56] your divided attention
[52:59] he wants your full attention
[53:02] i'm talking about christ he wants your
[53:04] full attention
[53:06] separated to him alone
[53:10] all right separated we're talking about
[53:13] when we talk about
[53:14] submission it means cement surrender
[53:16] yielding
[53:17] it also means separation
[53:22] amen all right so so god has always
[53:25] separated light from darkness death from
[53:27] life
[53:28] truth from error always has always will
[53:32] amen all right so
[53:35] separation to him alone not
[53:38] double-minded
[53:40] a double-minded man is unstable in his
[53:42] ways he's divided in interest he doesn't
[53:45] really know where he's standing
[53:47] because brother brown said there's a
[53:49] real believer and then there's the one
[53:50] that
[53:51] the unbeliever and then there's one the
[53:52] in between that don't know which way to
[53:54] go
[53:57] amen are you with me he said satan was
[53:59] the unbeliever adam was the real
[54:00] believer and he was in between
[54:03] she didn't know which way to go
[54:06] and satan took advantage of that but god
[54:09] doesn't want you like that
[54:12] he doesn't want your interest divided
[54:14] between him and somebody and something
[54:15] else
[54:16] someone else something else god's word
[54:18] calls for a total separation
[54:20] from unbelief that's right amen
[54:24] so he wants you separated from your own
[54:26] stinking
[54:27] thinking of your carnal thought
[54:31] that's pretty strong but i got that from
[54:33] a minister
[54:36] it is our own carnal thinking our own
[54:39] our own mind is against
[54:40] us it's enmity to god human thinking his
[54:43] enmity to god so quit trying to figure
[54:46] this word
[54:46] message out with your thinking you just
[54:49] go to feeding and let
[54:50] word as he said faith cometh by hearing
[54:52] the word now why i'm saying that
[54:54] there must be something in here that
[54:56] needs it
[54:59] we all need it
[55:02] just if something looks too strong for
[55:04] you and too heavy just deny yourself
[55:07] put it on the shelf say god it's in your
[55:10] hands and i'm going to continue eating
[55:12] lord you reveal your will to me it takes
[55:15] a death to self daily
[55:17] it takes a submission daily all right i
[55:20] want to get too far here
[55:22] don't he doesn't want you double-minded
[55:26] he wants you to hem your head the word
[55:29] alone all right
[55:32] genesis so we're going to say this and
[55:34] i'm just giving this is just a
[55:36] kind of a pull here to what we're doing
[55:39] he said
[55:39] marriage is come
[55:45] marriage has come it's seed time
[55:51] you ever hear prophet say that emphasis
[55:53] on it he also said it's seed time it's
[55:55] bride time amen
[55:59] and his whole was on her
[56:03] and your whole attention ought to be on
[56:06] him
[56:10] genesis 18 i want to come back to it
[56:13] over here so let me just get over to it
[56:16] genesis the 18th chapter 10th verse
[56:22] and he said this is the angel speaking
[56:26] that abraham said is elohim god in flesh
[56:29] we had god and flesh speak to us today
[56:33] we still have god and flesh speaking to
[56:35] us we have elohim
[56:37] all right but he said i will certainly
[56:39] return
[56:40] unto thee now the mystery of the seventh
[56:43] seal is laying right here
[56:49] the fact that all we're going to reach
[56:50] here is the mystery of the seventh seal
[56:53] which is the seven seals all right
[56:56] because the seventh just capped off the
[56:58] whole revelation
[57:00] because it's himself
[57:04] the capstone all right and he said i
[57:06] will certainly return unto thee
[57:08] according to the time of life
[57:10] and what did you what did he do after
[57:11] that he backed it up by knowing the
[57:13] secret of hearts
[57:14] how may know that brother said that's
[57:16] the sign of the son of man that's what's
[57:18] a sign
[57:18] pointing to a union
[57:23] hallelujah i've come for that purpose
[57:25] i've come to fulfill the word
[57:29] amen all right uh return unto me
[57:32] according to the time of life i want you
[57:34] to know time of life
[57:35] seedtime and lo sarah thy wife shall
[57:38] have a son
[57:40] who was having the son sarah thy wife
[57:44] all right and sarah heard it in the tent
[57:47] door which was behind him i want to jump
[57:49] down the 14th verse
[57:50] and we know what sarah said she laughed
[57:53] and god said to her
[57:54] is anything too hard for the lord
[57:58] at the time appointed let's think where
[58:01] we're at now in our day at the time
[58:03] appointed
[58:04] i will return unto thee
[58:09] he said oh brother david that couldn't
[58:11] happen what you tell me what the sign
[58:13] was in 63
[58:16] that wasn't the head coming to the body
[58:19] i will return unto thee full revelation
[58:22] of the word there he was all right
[58:24] i will return unto thee at the time
[58:27] appointed
[58:29] i will return to thee according to the
[58:31] time of life
[58:34] and sarah shall have a son let me say
[58:36] this
[58:37] it's the time of life all right
[58:40] you may be seated like you turned the
[58:42] song of solomon
[58:44] i won't keep you standing i do have
[58:45] three two other scriptures here to start
[58:47] off with
[58:50] song of solomon
[58:54] we preach around this book a lot
[58:59] but not many preach right on it that's
[59:02] okay i'm not downing anybody because of
[59:04] that but we preach around it and in it
[59:05] and out of it because it's the marriage
[59:07] it's a union it's a it's a love affair
[59:11] between god and his bride
[59:15] all right but the verse eight of chapter
[59:17] 2.
[59:20] now watch this first verse and i want to
[59:23] remind you that in
[59:25] that in
[59:31] in psalm 68 verse 33 you don't have to
[59:34] turn there
[59:35] let me just quote it he does send out
[59:37] his voice
[59:39] that a mighty voice
[59:43] all right then in the fur and the eighth
[59:45] the voice
[59:46] of my beloved hello
[59:50] do you have a beloved the voice of my
[59:53] beloved
[59:54] behold he cometh
[59:59] leaping upon the mountains skipping upon
[1:00:02] the hills let's turn to the 10th verse
[1:00:04] now
[1:00:04] my beloved spake
[1:00:08] it's the emphasis i want to bring out of
[1:00:09] the 8th verse the voice of my beloved he
[1:00:12] cometh
[1:00:15] my beloved spake and said unto me not to
[1:00:18] everyone else
[1:00:20] not to the other women to her
[1:00:24] spake unto me all right
[1:00:27] rise up we sing that song rising up
[1:00:30] rise up and if you you'll follow we
[1:00:34] don't have time to read it but isaiah 61
[1:00:36] says arise shine
[1:00:39] for thy light thy light
[1:00:42] personal thy light is come
[1:00:46] and the glory of the lord is risen upon
[1:00:48] himself
[1:00:50] her not another amen i think you've
[1:00:54] heard me preach on that not another
[1:00:56] he wouldn't share his glory with another
[1:00:59] but he will share it with her
[1:01:01] because she's not another
[1:01:05] well amen brother david that's the truth
[1:01:09] and it's interesting we have this behind
[1:01:11] us and this in focus
[1:01:15] we could say that's rainbow color
[1:01:21] and preach a message on marriage yeah
[1:01:24] that god laid in my heart two weeks ago
[1:01:27] three weeks ago
[1:01:28] or whatever it's been until quite a
[1:01:30] while
[1:01:33] all right and brother chris spoke a
[1:01:35] message on marriage
[1:01:38] behind the door
[1:01:41] in secret i just
[1:01:44] come unglued when he started saying that
[1:01:46] and i thought well that's why i've
[1:01:47] hindered that
[1:01:47] it's gonna follow right in line brother
[1:01:49] paul's speaking the same thing
[1:01:51] here sunday
[1:01:55] look how everything going brother sister
[1:01:56] what's what's he calling for calling
[1:01:58] for a greater submission
[1:02:03] amen amen you say well the wife will be
[1:02:06] submitted she will be
[1:02:09] but sometimes you just need to be
[1:02:10] reminded and if you're not where you
[1:02:12] should be
[1:02:13] he's calling for you to submit if that
[1:02:16] pulls in your heart give way to the pull
[1:02:19] because it happens to be the third one
[1:02:25] not the first one it's not the spirit
[1:02:27] it's the third one
[1:02:30] is that right the opening
[1:02:34] pulling you need an opening you need a
[1:02:35] closer walk with god then let go
[1:02:38] and let god do it to submit is to let go
[1:02:42] okay haven't you got the meetings yet
[1:02:44] let's keep reading
[1:02:45] 14th my beloved spake and said unto me

[1:02:56] with his love the same love my love
[1:03:00] you say well that we just take that well
[1:03:01] this my level that that's not lightly
[1:03:03] taken he's not saying exactly that he's
[1:03:05] saying you're my love
[1:03:08] and there's no fear in love you're my
[1:03:10] love i loved you first that's why you
[1:03:12] love me

[1:06:34] just a moment
[1:06:35] of the revelation the revelation the

[1:06:40] that's why the bible said god is my
[1:06:41] revelation

[1:06:54] strength

[1:07:05] or we're going to have pressure but you
[1:07:07] can let off the pressure
[1:07:09] because bride your future is clear
[1:07:13] i didn't say you wouldn't have trials
[1:07:14] and temptations when he said let us go
[1:07:16] at the other side they didn't know
[1:07:17] they'd have to meet the storm
[1:07:18] but he was in the ship if they just
[1:07:20] realized it instead of waking him up and
[1:07:22] said
[1:07:22] do you not care if we pair it that was a
[1:07:24] slap in the face i didn't i just tell
[1:07:26] you that we'd go the other side
[1:07:28] he was sleeping he wasn't moved by the
[1:07:30] storm
[1:07:31] they feared they feared it was fear that
[1:07:34] motivated that
[1:07:35] it wasn't faith it was fear
[1:07:41] amen all right
[1:07:45] all right so oh my dumb thou art in the
[1:07:48] clefs of the rock
[1:07:49] in the secret places
[1:07:52] of the stairs that stairs there is a way
[1:07:56] of access
[1:07:56] your access to me has been open
[1:08:00] like we said about esther she had access
[1:08:03] only she had access
[1:08:09] that makes me as excited as you were up
[1:08:11] here i i get excited when i think of
[1:08:13] that
[1:08:14] only she and she didn't approach it just
[1:08:16] well bless god i'll just walk in no
[1:08:18] and she when she come with a request she
[1:08:20] had reverence and respect the king
[1:08:23] i'll give you half my kingdom but she
[1:08:24] said if it pleases the king
[1:08:26] that's the character of the bride that's
[1:08:28] the character submissing to her husband
[1:08:32] amen all right all right so we
[1:08:36] so he said our the clutch the rock the
[1:08:38] secret places of stairs
[1:08:40] let me see thy countenance let me hear
[1:08:42] thy voice
[1:08:43] for sweet as thy voice and i counten it
[1:08:45] succumbly then he kind of comes back
[1:08:47] with the reprimand
[1:08:48] take the foxes you're letting little
[1:08:52] foxes just give yourself more to me
[1:08:56] we'll take care of the little foxes i'm
[1:08:58] just going to drop that in
[1:09:00] all right matthew 25.
[1:09:06] matthew 25
[1:09:11] i've already taken too much time
[1:09:15] oh well forgive me lord it's his time
[1:09:19] all right let's start here with the
[1:09:22] let's just start with this we know there
[1:09:23] was foolish and wise
[1:09:25] foolish took no oil in there
[1:09:28] took no oil in their lamps
[1:09:32] took the oil with them but the wise took
[1:09:34] oil in their vessels
[1:09:36] i want you to notice the change here in
[1:09:39] their vessels with their lamps
[1:09:43] they didn't have oil in their vessels
[1:09:45] they had it in their lamps at one time
[1:09:47] but the lamps have gone out
[1:09:48] they didn't have any more reserve
[1:09:50] nothing in there to quicken
[1:09:52] amen
[1:09:55] are you with me notice that vessel there
[1:09:58] there's a lamp and there's a vessel
[1:10:00] you have oil in your vessels bride you
[1:10:03] are prepared before the foundation of
[1:10:05] the world
[1:10:06] but it has to be quickened
[1:10:10] it takes the fire of god to quicken the
[1:10:12] oil
[1:10:14] but there has to be oil there to quicken
[1:10:18] all right so there had to be oil there
[1:10:20] to quicken didn't there there had to be
[1:10:21] a predestinated seed there to quicken
[1:10:23] because the pouring outpouring of the
[1:10:25] holy spirit falls upon all flesh
[1:10:27] but not all flesh have the seed in them
[1:10:29] they have a weed they have some kind of
[1:10:31] seed but not
[1:10:31] the seed not the wheat not the word
[1:10:33] scene
[1:10:36] that's why the bride will see the day
[1:10:38] and hour she lives and she's a
[1:10:39] manifestation of that time
[1:10:42] because she's the message of it
[1:10:45] the message had to be spoken for you and
[1:10:47] i to come to birth
[1:10:50] in our day under that word because we
[1:10:53] have a supernatural spoken word birth
[1:10:56] that's exactly how the bride she's a
[1:10:57] virgin born
[1:10:58] word of god made manifest not physical
[1:11:02] born
[1:11:02] spiritual born not a natural seed a
[1:11:05] spiritual seed
[1:11:07] all right now but she's to come on the
[1:11:10] scene the last days we talked about that
[1:11:11] last wednesday the promise was she's to
[1:11:13] come on the scene in the last day
[1:11:15] what would she be she would have to be
[1:11:17] him
[1:11:19] to fulfill the scripture and revelation
[1:11:22] of himself
[1:11:24] incomplete oh
[1:11:26] what an hour what a time that's why
[1:11:29] we're facing
[1:11:30] eden again right that's where five we're
[1:11:32] facing the millennium again
[1:11:35] i mean again the eden again which is the
[1:11:37] millennium eden we're facing eden
[1:11:40] we're facing the seventh day on the
[1:11:42] earth the earth day of seventh day
[1:11:45] i may know what i mean seventh that or
[1:11:46] that millennium day i don't want to go
[1:11:48] into that but millennium day is its
[1:11:49] seventh day
[1:11:52] all right and he rested the seventh day
[1:11:55] and he burns it off and
[1:11:56] and and gives the baptism on the earth
[1:11:58] the baptismal holy ghost and you are the
[1:12:00] holy ghost made manifest walk right out
[1:12:02] in it
[1:12:03] just like he walks right out in you and
[1:12:06] all the earth is submitted to you
[1:12:09] hallelujah now that's a thing in a
[1:12:11] nutshell that
[1:12:13] pretty good anyway i mean i thought so
[1:12:17] all right so all right
[1:12:20] getting back to this so they took they
[1:12:23] took oil in their vessels with their
[1:12:25] lamps
[1:12:27] in verse six and at midnight
[1:12:30] now you're breaking to a morning from
[1:12:33] midnight to morning
[1:12:35] because it's passing the day okay and at
[1:12:38] midnight
[1:12:39] there was a cry made behold the
[1:12:41] bridegroom
[1:12:42] cometh go ye
[1:12:45] out to meet him
[1:13:00] my love my fair one it's time to rise
[1:13:04] right this the the cry went forth
[1:13:09] from the one to introduce him because he
[1:13:12] had his voice
[1:13:15] are you with me are you're coming he's
[1:13:17] coming
[1:13:18] boy she got up because remember
[1:13:22] his coming was like romeo and juliet
[1:13:27] remember how prophet said that he didn't
[1:13:29] come in public view he came up on the
[1:13:31] ladder
[1:13:32] he rose right up there and knocked on
[1:13:33] the window
[1:13:36] kind of night you know still but it's
[1:13:38] going to be breaking day pretty quick
[1:13:39] here and
[1:13:42] i'm here i've arrived come come on i've
[1:13:44] got things to show you i've got
[1:13:46] secrets to make known to you i want to
[1:13:48] take you into myself i want to hide you
[1:13:50] away so that you'll have no
[1:13:53] no no fear about the day and the
[1:13:55] politics and the hour and the time and
[1:13:57] all this whether you're gonna have gas
[1:13:58] or not have gas money or not money and
[1:14:00] all this other thing
[1:14:01] come away submit yourself
[1:14:09] my love my fair one come away
[1:14:13] all right and while and and go out to
[1:14:16] meet him go you out to meet him
[1:14:19] praise god i mean we've heard the
[1:14:21] prophet pray that very word
[1:14:22] go out to meet him don't wait any longer
[1:14:29] but then his message turned the corner
[1:14:32] so here he is
[1:14:33] here he is i've introduced it to him now
[1:14:35] i've got a decrease he has to increase
[1:14:38] his turn from the prophet to his
[1:14:40] prophecy
[1:14:45] all right then it comes down here and
[1:14:48] all those virgins rose and trim their
[1:14:50] lamps remember the foolish and the white
[1:14:51] both rose
[1:14:54] well you got part of this too you know
[1:14:56] they had something to move them but they
[1:14:57] just didn't have enough to move them
[1:14:59] into a rapture
[1:15:02] they were sanctified people they were
[1:15:04] help to the bride
[1:15:08] what's a bride without attendance
[1:15:12] what's a queen without attendance they
[1:15:15] attend to it they just don't have the
[1:15:16] revelation of the hour
[1:15:18] they're good people they just lack
[1:15:20] revelation by god's
[1:15:22] choosing
[1:15:27] that's it you can't add a cubit to your
[1:15:30] stature
[1:15:31] but there's one thing about it when the
[1:15:32] word comes you sure
[1:15:34] that word's in there to be alive you
[1:15:36] want more of god that's all there is to
[1:15:38] it
[1:15:38] that little bride's got to have it she's
[1:15:41] not going to get out here dilatory about
[1:15:43] the message
[1:15:45] that foolish virgin was dilatory
[1:15:50] amen all right i can't stop on these
[1:15:53] little side things i just got to keep
[1:15:54] moving here
[1:15:56] all right your pull is wonderful i just
[1:15:58] can't quit all right now
[1:16:01] go let's go a little further
[1:16:04] and the foolish son of the wise give us
[1:16:06] of your oil for our lamps are gone out
[1:16:08] brother branham before 1963
[1:16:11] message of the seals he was telling the
[1:16:14] people
[1:16:14] what's wrong with you people even now
[1:16:17] mention his name i'm afraid
[1:16:18] he'd mention it david duplessis you
[1:16:20] remember he said my ministry is out here
[1:16:22] in the world but i'll bring them in to
[1:16:24] the baptism and
[1:16:25] see remember we said the the methodists
[1:16:27] the baptists the presbyterians
[1:16:31] and he said they were coming crying for
[1:16:33] oil brother graham said you notice they
[1:16:35] didn't get it
[1:16:36] they don't get it and it was at that
[1:16:38] time the bridegroom
[1:16:40] came
[1:16:45] and look at here and while they went to
[1:16:48] buy
[1:16:49] brother branham is denoting they're gone
[1:16:51] to buy they've gone to buy
[1:16:53] you look it up and look up and see
[1:16:55] bridegroom came and see what he says
[1:16:57] about it
[1:16:58] or bridegroom come right body change and
[1:17:02] that's exactly what this coming
[1:17:04] consummates in
[1:17:08] that's right you see the mystery brother
[1:17:12] brown said of the seventh seal is this
[1:17:14] coming
[1:17:16] because only the bride can see it why
[1:17:18] because she has the oil
[1:17:20] amen praise the lord
[1:17:25] that's why i'm not afraid to say that
[1:17:26] we're going to get into the lord to help
[1:17:28] me get into some things the prophet said
[1:17:29] here
[1:17:30] all right so we said here and while they
[1:17:32] went to buy the bridegroom came
[1:17:35] and they that were ready when were you
[1:17:38] ready
[1:17:39] amen how are you ready you didn't make
[1:17:42] yourself ready he made him
[1:17:43] yourself ready but he gave it into your
[1:17:46] hands to be ready
[1:17:49] because it was granted to the bride to
[1:17:50] be ready
[1:17:55] amen she's not going to miss it she's
[1:17:57] not going to miss her time
[1:18:01] and brother bro and always say let me
[1:18:03] say something the door will be
[1:18:04] completely shut
[1:18:07] until the last one comes in brother
[1:18:10] branham said i got this quote i forget
[1:18:12] 64. he said even if there was one happen
[1:18:14] to be born
[1:18:15] and that feels sealed everything a
[1:18:16] little child born here he's not old
[1:18:18] enough to know the difference but he has
[1:18:20] to grow up
[1:18:21] but but that he or she is predestinated
[1:18:24] bride
[1:18:24] then everything has to wait for that
[1:18:26] person to get there
[1:18:30] we don't know when that last one comes
[1:18:32] in
[1:18:33] we just know that when you're ready you
[1:18:35] go into marriage with him and the door
[1:18:36] shuts
[1:18:38] it's not shut totally yet but it's shut
[1:18:40] on you
[1:18:42] glory
[1:18:48] he doesn't leave it wide open he doesn't
[1:18:49] come to a to a communion with you
[1:18:52] if you know what i mean a union an
[1:18:53] invisible union it's an invisible union
[1:18:58] hallelujah this is an invisible union
[1:19:01] between you and him
[1:19:03] not a public show it's not known to the
[1:19:05] public you see the corner turn
[1:19:10] you see the sun the sun's out here
[1:19:13] shining in its strength
[1:19:15] amen
[1:19:19] that's why that's why corn these plants
[1:19:21] you don't harvest wheat until the sun's
[1:19:22] in its strength and it
[1:19:24] bakes that wheat and burns it to a
[1:19:25] golden brown lays in the presence of
[1:19:27] that sun
[1:19:29] it's ready for harvest be taken
[1:19:34] amen there's a slowly of growth but not
[1:19:37] the sowing of maturity
[1:19:42] did you catch what i just said the
[1:19:44] maturity speeds up
[1:19:46] the growth slows down i'm talking about
[1:19:48] growth as far as the plant growth
[1:19:50] because it's come to its head now the
[1:19:52] head is maturing
[1:19:56] life's gone all the way to from the root
[1:19:58] the seed to begin with back to seed
[1:20:00] again
[1:20:01] right or back to the revealing of the
[1:20:03] son of man
[1:20:04] again
[1:20:07] remember three sons names he comes the
[1:20:10] son of man
[1:20:12] son of god son of david but just before
[1:20:15] he said he returns to israel son of
[1:20:17] david he appears as son of man again
[1:20:21] it's exactly your day
[1:20:25] amen all right now he said
[1:20:29] so he said and they that were ready went
[1:20:31] in with him
[1:20:32] to the marriage and the door
[1:20:36] was shut
[1:20:39] afterward came also the other virgin
[1:20:42] saying lord lord
[1:20:43] open to us but he answered and said
[1:20:46] verily
[1:20:47] i say unto you i know you not
[1:20:51] i you weren't in my thinking as bride
[1:20:56] i know you not i don't have a love
[1:20:58] affair with you i don't know
[1:21:00] you that way i never did know you that
[1:21:02] way
[1:21:04] although these here get eternal life at
[1:21:06] the white throne judgment
[1:21:09] because they were good to the people of
[1:21:11] god
[1:21:13] now think of that one yeah you could
[1:21:14] just go on and talk all you want but
[1:21:16] brother braham said what noted the
[1:21:18] difference between those that did get
[1:21:19] eternal life and didn't
[1:21:20] is how they treated the word when they
[1:21:26] met
[1:21:28] if they found fault with it al i will go
[1:21:30] into that's another message
[1:21:32] that's been in my heart for a long time
[1:21:35] all right now
[1:21:38] watch this submission the act
[1:21:43] or fact submission means the action
[1:21:48] the action
[1:21:52] called action brother paul the action
[1:21:57] or fact of accepting or yielding
[1:22:00] to a superior force or to the will or
[1:22:04] authority of another person
[1:22:07] amen all right submit
[1:22:10] submit means to yield resign
[1:22:13] or surrender to the power will will or
[1:22:16] authority of another
[1:22:20] and they give us and we turn ephesians
[1:22:22] five it said
[1:22:23] wives submit yourselves to your own
[1:22:26] husbands
[1:22:28] to be subject to acquise
[1:22:32] in the authority of another
[1:22:36] to thy husband's will that's still the
[1:22:39] meaning of it
[1:22:40] still given the meaning of submit to thy
[1:22:42] husband's will
[1:22:43] to be submissive to yield without
[1:22:50] murmuring
[1:22:52] amen god take up our cross daily don't
[1:22:56] we
[1:22:57] when that murmuring spirit wants to come
[1:22:59] around start murmuring
[1:23:02] remember you don't know this word by
[1:23:05] your intellectual study
[1:23:07] you'll never know it right it takes a
[1:23:10] death to yourself and an in
[1:23:12] an in an indwelling of the holy ghost
[1:23:15] before you can even call jesus the lord
[1:23:21] so you say well that leaves me out no it
[1:23:24] leaves you in
[1:23:25] it depends what's in your heart
[1:23:28] isn't that right you see it's a call
[1:23:31] of submission it's a warning on one hand
[1:23:35] and a refuge and arrest on the other
[1:23:37] hand this morning
[1:23:39] all right all right
[1:23:43] so we look at that submission to submit
[1:23:46] and we and i referred to submissive
[1:23:48] without yielding
[1:23:48] you go back to scripture and find it
[1:23:50] philippians 2 13
[1:23:52] 14 and 16.
[1:23:56] 213 14 and verse 16.
[1:23:59] it's a submission by love
[1:24:04] amen all right
[1:24:09] brother branham said he said because i
[1:24:12] live you live also
[1:24:14] speaking to his girlfriend no
[1:24:19] speaking to his wife this is not a
[1:24:22] boyfriend girlfriend affair now
[1:24:24] this is a this is a union
[1:24:27] amen right he owns your money he owns
[1:24:30] your time
[1:24:32] he controls your life
[1:24:36] and he wants on the he wants an he wants
[1:24:39] an absolute
[1:24:41] focus on him an arrest
[1:24:44] on what he said he would do submission
[1:24:48] amen all right now
[1:24:54] i'm reading out of the message proving
[1:24:56] his word you've heard this a lot these
[1:24:58] quotes you've heard a lot
[1:25:00] but brother i don't care how many times
[1:25:01] you've heard quotes why don't you lay
[1:25:03] that intellectual thought aside
[1:25:05] and realize that every time i've read
[1:25:06] these and maybe been into a message
[1:25:09] i don't know i don't have to keep track
[1:25:11] of my time 75 80 90 times maybe i don't
[1:25:13] know
[1:25:14] but i through the years that doesn't
[1:25:16] mean a thing that does not mean one
[1:25:18] thing what is he revealed
[1:25:24] and there's something in that new every
[1:25:25] time just like this message
[1:25:27] now watch paragraph 2 35 236 now we say
[1:25:32] he's raised from the dead
[1:25:33] i didn't say it the word here said it
[1:25:37] they said he raised from the dead he
[1:25:39] says he's the same yesterday today and
[1:25:41] forever
[1:25:43] you believe that then don't make him
[1:25:47] something he
[1:25:47] wasn't yesterday or don't try to make
[1:25:49] him something he's not today that he was
[1:25:51] yesterday
[1:25:52] yeah all right
[1:25:55] he said he's the same yesterday today
[1:25:56] and forever you believe that
[1:25:58] he promised these things to happen in
[1:25:59] the last days that
[1:26:01] saying that the same son of man will be
[1:26:04] made manifest the same son of man now
[1:26:07] right
[1:26:08] away your carnality goes back to the
[1:26:10] calvary man
[1:26:12] it was but not in that stature that form
[1:26:17] are you with me we'll meet him but not
[1:26:20] right now we have we're still meeting
[1:26:22] the son of man though
[1:26:25] all right i hope that didn't make you
[1:26:28] swallow your tongue
[1:26:30] but that's the truth where are me how
[1:26:33] many know you're met the son of man
[1:26:35] again he's come again he had to come
[1:26:37] again he had to return again
[1:26:43] all right even had his picture taken
[1:26:49] all right now now remember that was not
[1:26:52] jesus talking to abraham there that
[1:26:55] could discern the thoughts in
[1:26:56] sarah's mind behind him that was not
[1:26:58] jesus he had not yet been born
[1:27:01] but he was a man in human flesh that
[1:27:03] abraham called
[1:27:04] elohim the great almighty
[1:27:07] showing jesus said it was as it was in
[1:27:09] the days of sodom he says now watch
[1:27:12] close
[1:27:13] in the days of sodom so will it be at
[1:27:15] the coming of the son of man
[1:27:19] all right when the son of man is being
[1:27:22] revealed what's revealed unveiled
[1:27:30] brother branham said where he said in
[1:27:32] the seal book so i can't remember
[1:27:34] exactly he said where is it unveiled
[1:27:37] in you
[1:27:40] through his prophet and you somebody's
[1:27:42] got to carry the message out
[1:27:44] somewhere it's going to be unveiled
[1:27:48] and when it's unveiled then you that's
[1:27:50] god with skin on him

[1:28:58] come down and unite the marriage of the
[1:29:01] bride the bridegroom call the bridegroom
[1:29:03] call will come right through this
[1:29:09] when the son of man will come down and

[1:29:24] word
[1:29:24] because he is the word and the two unite
[1:29:28] together and to do that it'll take the
[1:29:30] manifestation
[1:29:31] of the revealing of the son of man
[1:29:36] amen slow with this on purpose
[1:29:39] i want you to catch every word here
[1:29:43] not a clergyman not the revealing of a
[1:29:45] clergyman
[1:29:46] i i don't know do you see what i mean
[1:29:49] see this
[1:29:49] baby thought that it's not going over
[1:29:51] just right but he's but it's not

[1:30:06] among us and will make his word so
[1:30:09] real that he'll unite the church and him
[1:30:12] as one the bride he's not make sure you
[1:30:15] understand what he means by church the
[1:30:16] bride
[1:30:17] then she'll go home to the wedding
[1:30:20] supper
[1:30:22] what are we looking for the wedding
[1:30:24] supper
[1:30:27] she sees he said amen she's already
[1:30:31] united
[1:30:33] when that takes place she's already
[1:30:35] united when we do that go home
[1:30:38] see we go to the wedding supper not
[1:30:41] to the marriage
[1:30:44] because the marriage of the lamb is come
[1:30:48] he said has come past him
[1:30:52] all right but the rapture is going to
[1:30:54] the wedding supper
[1:30:57] all right when the word here here unites
[1:31:01] with the person
[1:31:02] and they too become one and then what
[1:31:05] does it do then it manifests the son of
[1:31:07] man
[1:31:08] again
[1:31:11] the son of man the word and the church
[1:31:13] becomes one
[1:31:15] whatever the son of man done he was the
[1:31:17] word the church does the same thing
[1:31:19] if she hadn't see he hit on 16 cylinders
[1:31:22] so will the bride
[1:31:23] if he had the characteristic displayed
[1:31:25] of this so will the bride
[1:31:26] he's uniting himself with his own
[1:31:29] character
[1:31:31] he can't manifest another character
[1:31:35] he won't marry another character
[1:31:39] amen all right see when the word so
[1:31:42] he said he was the word the word in the
[1:31:44] church come what he was the word the
[1:31:46] church does the same thing
[1:31:49] he cho now
[1:31:52] she is him i'm i'm putting in
[1:31:55] by my referring deck to other things
[1:31:58] she is him that's what he said she is
[1:32:00] him same spirit
[1:32:02] one spirit no longer twain but one same
[1:32:05] word spoke of the groom speaks of the
[1:32:07] bride
[1:32:08] same word if he hit on
[1:32:11] okay i already said 16 cylinders so will
[1:32:13] she she's him she is him
[1:32:15] he's her body he is
[1:32:18] her body i hope he catch this now
[1:32:23] we don't have another body but him
[1:32:26] he is my body because my habitation is
[1:32:31] in him
[1:32:32] my dwelling place is in him
[1:32:36] and then this is his body
[1:32:41] we've got to get that in the right order
[1:32:44] amen amen okay i'm coming back to that
[1:32:48] the lord will help me here with the time
[1:32:50] i may i'm almost well i'm not stopping
[1:32:53] yet
[1:32:55] i can't stop yet brother paul i'm sorry
[1:32:58] but you know how it is
[1:33:03] and where brother brother chris said he
[1:33:06] worries about having
[1:33:07] enough
[1:33:12] we worry about having too much
[1:33:17] but he didn't make me to be like chris
[1:33:19] or brother paul
[1:33:21] he made me to be what i am amen so we
[1:33:24] gotta
[1:33:24] just follow how many noises he's leading
[1:33:28] that's all we want isn't it right
[1:33:31] submission to him let go of ourselves
[1:33:35] our feelings our reasoning you can't
[1:33:38] trust your reasoning you can't trust
[1:33:41] your emotions
[1:33:42] you can't trust your feelings
[1:33:45] right it's the word we're trusting
[1:33:51] your feelings could be up and down you
[1:33:53] wake up one morning you know you feel
[1:33:54] 100 miles away from the word that
[1:33:55] doesn't have anything to do with the
[1:33:56] word being there
[1:33:59] because you've got two natures in the
[1:34:01] same body
[1:34:03] one's in the soul which is the word of
[1:34:04] god if you're born again it's the word
[1:34:06] of god
[1:34:07] the other old nature out there wants a
[1:34:08] contrary at all time
[1:34:10] you meet that every day but you don't
[1:34:13] trust the outer man
[1:34:14] you don't trust your senses
[1:34:18] trust the word you're not submitting
[1:34:20] yourself to your senses
[1:34:23] at least i hope you aren't you trust the
[1:34:26] word
[1:34:27] and then trust god to lead your senses
[1:34:30] there you are
[1:34:31] your reasoning your memory your
[1:34:32] imagination
[1:34:37] hebrews 10 5 said a body has thou
[1:34:39] prepared me lord
[1:34:41] a body has sal prepared me in questions
[1:34:44] and answers
[1:34:46] in 64.
[1:34:49] brother brandon was asked the questions
[1:34:50] i can't give over completely to jesus
[1:34:55] have i an evil spirit this is 8
[1:34:58] 23 morning 64. paragraph 269 let me just
[1:35:01] spend
[1:35:04] surrender all you are
[1:35:09] oh no not me
[1:35:12] be careful
[1:35:16] my husband doesn't believe the way i
[1:35:17] believe that doesn't have one tinker's
[1:35:19] who to body you surrendered him as long
[1:35:20] as he stays in the word
[1:35:22] with you right are you with me
[1:35:26] you surrender your whole self to him you
[1:35:28] married him
[1:35:30] you say but what if he says i can't go
[1:35:31] to church what if i can't read the word
[1:35:34] brother brown said you surrender every
[1:35:36] you surrender complete to him unless he
[1:35:38] has you do something or or go somewhere
[1:35:41] or do something it's contrary to the
[1:35:42] word then your love is to the word
[1:35:45] but otherwise you surrender to him you
[1:35:48] don't withhold it
[1:35:49] you surrender you respect him you
[1:35:50] reverence him regardless
[1:35:55] what if god led you out here well lord
[1:35:57] you wouldn't lead me to do this
[1:35:58] remember the lord leads us sometimes
[1:36:00] contrary in an unexpected way an
[1:36:02] unexpected time
[1:36:03] contrary to your reasoning you're in him
[1:36:06] and he's in you
[1:36:09] and if there's anything wrong he's going
[1:36:10] to correct it he's going your way as a
[1:36:12] believer but what he allows it to happen
[1:36:15] and all things work together for good to
[1:36:17] them that love god
[1:36:18] so you have not one thing to to be
[1:36:20] disgusted about or murmuring about or
[1:36:23] complaining about
[1:36:26] and we all do because our old human
[1:36:30] self gets in the way that's why jesus
[1:36:32] said you have to deny yourself take up
[1:36:34] your cross daily and follow me
[1:36:39] now so he says
[1:36:43] you can't surrender don't if you're a
[1:36:46] woman
[1:36:46] if you're a woman don't you have to
[1:36:47] surrender your husband wife surrender
[1:36:49] all you are watch what he continues to
[1:36:50] say
[1:36:51] a little lady when you were married
[1:36:53] virtuous
[1:36:54] fought all your life to stay virtuous
[1:36:57] but one day
[1:36:59] you found a man that you loved see a
[1:37:01] real marriage is a revelation
[1:37:03] you found a man that you love
[1:37:07] you know that's the one you see brother
[1:37:09] man said when it's a revelation to you
[1:37:11] that your wife that's your husband
[1:37:12] that's an eternal mate from glory
[1:37:15] you just come out of time met down here
[1:37:18] ordained to meet down here and go right
[1:37:20] back out to eternity again a little
[1:37:22] space
[1:37:23] that's the real marriage
[1:37:26] that's why he said you ought to wait and
[1:37:28] seek god about who you marry
[1:37:31] absolutely is that right you're young
[1:37:33] people you ought to hear what brother
[1:37:34] david brother paul
[1:37:36] we're not just talking around the bush
[1:37:37] you better be careful you marry a boy
[1:37:39] that's full of the holy ghost
[1:37:41] if you're full of the holy ghost you'll
[1:37:42] have no other desire but to marry a boy
[1:37:44] that has the holy ghost and the
[1:37:45] manifestation and the fruit
[1:37:47] of that in his life that's right
[1:37:50] amen that's right because if he isn't
[1:37:53] he'll make hell on earth for you
[1:37:58] in the same way a boy looking for a girl
[1:38:00] don't you look at her pretty stature and
[1:38:01] her pretty little eyes
[1:38:03] and her curly hair or his curly hair
[1:38:07] or if his sweet feet smell good like
[1:38:08] brother branham said you know
[1:38:10] well he has such cute feet
[1:38:14] well she shouldn't have been that close
[1:38:15] to him
[1:38:17] to see his feet why was his feet
[1:38:19] uncovered probably barefooted back in
[1:38:20] the south they do that anyway
[1:38:22] i don't know why it would be nice
[1:38:24] smelling but he probably put her fume on
[1:38:26] it
[1:38:27] so that was the decision
[1:38:32] that's pretty shallow isn't it
[1:38:36] you better make sure she has the
[1:38:37] manifestation of holiness in her life
[1:38:39] which is a life lived for jesus christ
[1:38:41] a life worthy of the gospel
[1:38:44] i'll get off of that but a whole sermon
[1:38:47] could be preached there
[1:38:51] yeah more than two other one that's for
[1:38:53] sure
[1:38:55] whole family series could be preached on
[1:38:57] that daddies
[1:38:59] wives husbands wives children
[1:39:05] all right but you but you found a man
[1:39:09] that you loved and you were his
[1:39:11] completely the things that you fought
[1:39:15] against all your life and tried to live
[1:39:17] clean and clear and virtuous
[1:39:18] now you surrender every bit of it to
[1:39:22] one man are you reading it
[1:39:25] are you listening what the bride does
[1:39:28] surrender to one man
[1:39:29] is that right put yourself completely in
[1:39:32] his hand you put yourself completely in
[1:39:34] his hands
[1:39:36] not don't go and talk about it to other
[1:39:37] people how bad he is
[1:39:41] and all the mistakes he's made and put
[1:39:42] it all over facebook
[1:39:51] that's not god's spirit
[1:39:57] you ought to reverence and respect your
[1:39:58] husband
[1:40:01] amen i know i know i know you don't like
[1:40:04] it
[1:40:05] but that's the truth anyhow
[1:40:09] that is exactly the truth
[1:40:14] and go complain and tell others about it
[1:40:17] you're guilty
[1:40:19] you need to make it right
[1:40:28] i'm tempted to really lay it on the line
[1:40:29] right now but i want to stay with this
[1:40:31] real close
[1:40:32] i'm talking about submission wife see
[1:40:36] that she
[1:40:36] reverence her husband
[1:40:42] you take it from there brother paul talk
[1:40:44] about reverence
[1:40:47] amen see that she reverence
[1:40:51] it takes a death to self it takes a
[1:40:52] death to yourself
[1:40:54] to be born again takes the death of self
[1:40:57] there you are you shouldn't say anything
[1:41:01] about your husband but it's good
[1:41:03] husbands the same thing why should you
[1:41:07] declare to everybody else how bad he is
[1:41:08] and they did this and he did that
[1:41:10] he saw this and he did this she did this
[1:41:16] i'm talking about submission i told you
[1:41:18] this is a warning
[1:41:20] and telling the bride who she is and
[1:41:21] what she can expect
[1:41:23] and how she's a married woman amen
[1:41:30] all right you were his completely
[1:41:34] you fought clean and clear you said you
[1:41:37] told him at the
[1:41:38] at the at the at that at the at the
[1:41:41] altar that you said you made a vow to
[1:41:43] him and you said you would do it he made
[1:41:46] about to you and you said you would do
[1:41:47] it god will hold you to that bowel
[1:41:52] amen that bowel went down in eternity
[1:41:56] you break that vow you broke god's
[1:41:58] command
[1:41:59] and you will answer for it
[1:42:03] so you see young people what it means
[1:42:08] to find a wife and to find a husband
[1:42:12] you better pray and you better make sure
[1:42:13] your life is in line with this word
[1:42:16] then god will give you the husband you
[1:42:17] need and he'll give you the wife you
[1:42:19] need
[1:42:21] amen amen all right now
[1:42:24] so you put yourself completely in his
[1:42:26] hand you put yourself completely in your
[1:42:28] husband's hands
[1:42:29] and you are his every bit of your right
[1:42:33] every bit of you you put in his hands
[1:42:36] now all that you have stood for in
[1:42:38] decency and moral and everything looked
[1:42:40] at now you turn it over to a man because
[1:42:42] you surrender yourself to the man
[1:42:44] and god help that man that would bring
[1:42:47] any other
[1:42:48] any other uh influence other than
[1:42:51] decency and right and dressing
[1:42:53] god help that man that won't discern
[1:42:57] that woman to go out there she probably
[1:42:59] wants it anyway
[1:43:03] god help that man that man full of the
[1:43:04] holy ghost wouldn't want to go out the
[1:43:06] door pushed out in front and back
[1:43:11] a brother sister that's exactly the
[1:43:12] words the prophet used i have a right to
[1:43:14] use of what he used
[1:43:15] he said it that way i could bring you
[1:43:17] right back to where he said it
[1:43:19] amen it's not a laughing matter it's not
[1:43:22] a joking matter
[1:43:24] it is serious you draw attention to a
[1:43:27] man
[1:43:28] another man outside of your husband to
[1:43:29] your body you
[1:43:31] are committing adultery that man's gonna
[1:43:33] look at you the way you are
[1:43:34] i don't care how long your dress is if
[1:43:37] it's tight
[1:43:38] and you show yourself that way you are
[1:43:40] going to answer for committing adultery
[1:43:48] submit submit to the word
[1:43:55] amen
[1:43:59] i love you with all my heart but i can't
[1:44:01] love you properly if i let that go by
[1:44:03] and not say something when the holy
[1:44:04] ghost is here anointing it to be said
[1:44:06] amen
[1:44:11] amen sound clean and clear to my husband
[1:44:15] you may be
[1:44:18] you want to trim off your hair you're
[1:44:20] cutting it
[1:44:22] it's just you might as well shave it
[1:44:27] you want to wear those clothes that
[1:44:28] aren't decent and you claim to be in the
[1:44:31] message and walk down the message aisle
[1:44:34] and it and that that attention is drawn
[1:44:37] listen there are clothes you can wear
[1:44:38] that don't draw the attention that i'm
[1:44:40] talking about
[1:44:41] you know that
[1:44:45] and i do appreciate good women in here
[1:44:46] that dress decently
[1:44:48] yes but there are some that need to have
[1:44:49] a birth
[1:44:53] say who are you i'm not judging but the
[1:44:55] word is judging
[1:44:57] amen because you would have discernment
[1:45:00] about that if he had the holy ghost
[1:45:05] amen you say it or not i'll say it as
[1:45:09] loud as i can shout it
[1:45:10] that's the truth all right let's get
[1:45:12] back on track here this is on track
[1:45:15] submission amen now you turn yourself
[1:45:18] over to a man because you surrender
[1:45:20] yourself to the man
[1:45:21] can't you do the same thing to jesus
[1:45:23] christ just surrender yourself that way
[1:45:25] all that i am
[1:45:26] all that my mind all of my thoughts
[1:45:29] certainly he said i don't think you're
[1:45:31] pressed possessed by an evil spirit
[1:45:34] i think the evil spirit anoints you with
[1:45:35] them kind of thoughts trying to make you
[1:45:37] think you cannot surrender yourself to
[1:45:38] god
[1:45:39] let me show you something why would you
[1:45:41] want to surrender to him notice how
[1:45:44] quick that prophet turned that right
[1:45:45] around why would you ask me the question
[1:45:47] i just can't surrender
[1:45:48] because you want to
[1:45:52] he turns right back around and says
[1:45:54] you're asking the question because i
[1:45:55] believe you want to surrender
[1:45:57] he said he said because there's
[1:46:00] something else
[1:46:01] in in there calling to you to surrender
[1:46:04] it's a very good sign that you ought to
[1:46:06] surrender yourself
[1:46:07] another place said it's very simple yet
[1:46:10] it's hard he said just let go
[1:46:15] you're trying to hold on to yourself
[1:46:16] just let go and let him hold on to you
[1:46:19] well but he may do something that
[1:46:22] others might think is crazy yeah he may
[1:46:25] he may do some things with you that's
[1:46:27] radical
[1:46:28] but he'll never leave his word
[1:46:33] what a sacred trust what a
[1:46:35] responsibility to a woman
[1:46:37] now see whether she's a type of the
[1:46:39] church which has the same responsibility
[1:46:41] as a woman
[1:46:42] has sacred responsibility to her
[1:46:44] motherhood to her virtues to her husband
[1:46:46] the church has a sacred responsibility
[1:46:48] to
[1:46:49] prayer and to the word
[1:46:54] and to christ just the same as the woman
[1:46:57] has
[1:46:58] visible union 1965
[1:47:01] you have a responsibility to christ
[1:47:03] brought prayer
[1:47:04] in the word
[1:47:10] all right can i take just a little bit
[1:47:13] more time
[1:47:14] would you give me just a little bit i'm
[1:47:15] not i'm not really at my
[1:47:17] at my changing time yet i usually preach
[1:47:20] about an hour and a half
[1:47:21] you know i'm about that way and
[1:47:23] sometimes a little longer
[1:47:26] so it's not out of my norm so just bear
[1:47:30] with me just a minute
[1:47:32] i don't think you have anything better
[1:47:33] to do
[1:47:37] nobody said amen i'll say it for you
[1:47:40] amen
[1:47:43] paul knows good and well that this that
[1:47:45] this is more important than planting
[1:47:50] right paul amen all right
[1:47:53] certainly i know he's pressed to get
[1:47:57] certain things done i
[1:47:58] we're pressed to do certain things but
[1:47:59] what's more important here comes
[1:48:02] submission
[1:48:05] regardless of how oppressed you are you
[1:48:08] can let off the pressure because he's in
[1:48:09] control
[1:48:12] all right now let me just go a little
[1:48:16] bit further
[1:48:17] because i want to get to something here
[1:48:18] i want you to turn with me to isaiah 22
[1:48:20] 22 and if i finish with this i'll finish
[1:48:22] with it remember
[1:48:25] all of this mystery all of what god had
[1:48:27] in his mind is a mystery
[1:48:30] has been given down let me just get it
[1:48:33] here
[1:48:35] all that god had is a mystery
[1:48:43] god's great secret has always blinded
[1:48:45] the wisdom of the world they can't get
[1:48:46] it
[1:48:47] they don't understand it satan don't
[1:48:49] understand it well that's a good one
[1:48:51] none of the rest of them understand it
[1:48:53] but those who are predestinated to
[1:48:55] understand it that's
[1:48:57] how god but just to those he said who
[1:48:59] are predestinated to understand it how
[1:49:01] god
[1:49:02] and christ are one notice
[1:49:05] next first phase of the threefold
[1:49:09] mystery of the seventh seal was what
[1:49:11] first phase was what god
[1:49:15] manifested god in christ what's the
[1:49:17] second christ
[1:49:18] manifested in you what's the third
[1:49:23] fact eden amen
[1:49:26] right exactly all right so god
[1:49:29] secondly the manifested christ in you
[1:49:31] look what was once god's great
[1:49:34] secret even kept it a secret wouldn't
[1:49:36] let john write it
[1:49:38] right what was god's great secret
[1:49:40] mysterious secret
[1:49:41] in his mind watch this is now now
[1:49:44] put in the hearts of the believer yes
[1:49:46] amen that's pregnation
[1:49:49] is put in the hearts of the believer
[1:49:50] that is the body of christ the believer
[1:49:52] body of christ
[1:49:53] what was once god's great secret in his
[1:49:55] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:49:58] is now made manifest think of it
[1:50:03] but god's great mystery what the eternal
[1:50:05] god has a mystery
[1:50:06] has now been unfolded in jesus christ
[1:50:09] first state first
[1:50:10] thing then given right down to his
[1:50:13] church
[1:50:14] what was once in god's mind is now in
[1:50:16] the body of christ
[1:50:18] jesus making love to the church
[1:50:21] the bride whispering secrets to her you
[1:50:24] love her so much you just tell her
[1:50:26] the secrets and get her up next to you
[1:50:28] and love you and everything
[1:50:29] you know how it is that's what god
[1:50:32] christ is doing to the church see
[1:50:34] he's letting her know the secrets just
[1:50:37] the secrets
[1:50:38] not these flirters i mean his wife
[1:50:44] all right now you see why
[1:50:47] back before last we took perfect
[1:50:49] evidence
[1:50:51] see what the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:50:54] was you can be anointed
[1:50:55] this outer spirit and still not have the
[1:50:58] word down the soil
[1:50:59] soul soul that's right
[1:51:04] that's right isn't that right what'd he
[1:51:05] come to quicken
[1:51:07] he comes to quicken his word what's
[1:51:09] laying down in there see
[1:51:11] you can have your spirit anointed feel
[1:51:14] good
[1:51:15] speak in tongue shout down i believe in
[1:51:16] all of that cast out devils he said i
[1:51:19] still don't know you
[1:51:21] be anointed to do it now you understand
[1:51:24] that i could go on i was i still had a
[1:51:26] part two on that i haven't got to but
[1:51:28] you understand
[1:51:31] amen the rain falls on the just the
[1:51:32] unjust same rain
[1:51:34] same rain one can produce the word for
[1:51:37] the season that's very important you get
[1:51:38] that
[1:51:40] the other can
[1:51:44] amen all right because you're because
[1:51:47] the seed is going to bring forth of its
[1:51:48] kind
[1:51:51] now
[1:51:54] therefore you walked with him when you
[1:51:56] were when you were in him
[1:51:58] therefore you walked with him when you
[1:51:59] were in him when he was on earth you
[1:52:01] were in him you suffered with him you
[1:52:02] died with him
[1:52:03] he was buried with him and now you're
[1:52:05] risen with him
[1:52:07] and manifested attribute of god setting
[1:52:09] in heavenly places
[1:52:10] already raised resurrected to new life
[1:52:13] setting in heavenly places in christ
[1:52:15] jesus
[1:52:16] all that means so much nowadays church
[1:52:18] that means so much
[1:52:19] to see ourselves positionally placed
[1:52:23] in jesus christ
[1:52:29] that's it only one
[1:52:32] now if we are those attributes of god we
[1:52:34] cannot live by creeds we cannot live by
[1:52:36] denominationalism
[1:52:37] we must live by the word because the
[1:52:39] bride is a part of the bridegroom like
[1:52:41] any wife is a part of her husband
[1:52:43] therefore we must be the word bride what
[1:52:45] is that word bride
[1:52:46] the manifestation of this hour
[1:52:50] not the bride not a creed or
[1:52:52] denomination but a living or the bride
[1:52:54] is a living oracle a living word
[1:52:56] of god a living attribute of god
[1:52:59] displaying to the world
[1:53:00] the attributes of god in the formation
[1:53:04] of the bride there's
[1:53:08] the focus there's god's focus right
[1:53:11] there
[1:53:12] that's what he seemed to be focusing on
[1:53:13] in every message
[1:53:16] in the formation himself in the
[1:53:18] formation of the bride
[1:53:19] formation of the bride it's the finished
[1:53:22] complete mystery of himself
[1:53:26] now we go back to eden as a masterpiece
[1:53:28] family
[1:53:31] all right now he said so we see this day
[1:53:34] is fulfilled because now the promise is
[1:53:36] being fulfilled
[1:53:38] he said now it is christ the true
[1:53:40] headship
[1:53:41] going in coming in his bride doing the
[1:53:44] same works by the same sign
[1:53:46] being the same spirit the same life the
[1:53:48] same god everything the same
[1:53:50] now we see it being fulfilled what was
[1:53:52] to come on the scene in this day
[1:53:54] the son of man in bride form the bride
[1:53:57] coming of christ
[1:53:59] there is to come on the scene brother
[1:54:01] branham said the promise is that there's
[1:54:02] come on the scene
[1:54:03] in this day a royal bride a royal seed
[1:54:06] to the royal promised son
[1:54:08] she'd be a spiritual seed she's to come
[1:54:11] on
[1:54:11] she's to come on the scene and the
[1:54:13] promise is given to us
[1:54:14] malachi 4 is one of the promises
[1:54:16] revelation 10 is another promise
[1:54:18] all these promises laying there of how
[1:54:21] he would appear
[1:54:22] in this day in this hour for our body
[1:54:25] change
[1:54:26] he had to come to receive us
[1:54:30] he had to come to unveil himself to
[1:54:32] bring us into our position
[1:54:34] and now what we must now what have we
[1:54:36] been doing we've had to lay in the
[1:54:38] presence of the sun
[1:54:40] to ripen we must lay in the presence of
[1:54:43] the sun
[1:54:44] to ripen must lay in what presence his
[1:54:47] presence
[1:54:48] where behind the door
[1:54:53] in secret luke 17 i'm going through
[1:54:55] these quickly i won't make any more time
[1:54:57] luke 17 said he said show us show us the
[1:55:00] kingdom he said the kingdom cometh not
[1:55:02] with observation he said the kingdom of
[1:55:04] god is within you
[1:55:06] [Music]
[1:55:07] and it doesn't come jesus said it
[1:55:09] doesn't come in a public show
[1:55:11] it isn't known to the public this thing
[1:55:13] that was hidden in revelation
[1:55:15] 10 this seventh seal is not known to the
[1:55:18] public
[1:55:20] that's why they think will you think you
[1:55:22] are a special people
[1:55:23] amen
[1:55:27] he's special he called me he placed me
[1:55:31] he put me here he revealed it to me i
[1:55:34] didn't pump it up and worked it up
[1:55:36] and had to think i had to do something
[1:55:37] special i gave myself in submission
[1:55:40] to the word and he does it right
[1:55:43] but i couldn't even done that unless he
[1:55:45] to put it in me to be
[1:55:46] missing it's all him
[1:55:51] but that's why in this hour those two
[1:55:53] spirits will be so close
[1:55:55] because they're both anointed with the
[1:55:57] same holy spirit but one can only bring
[1:55:59] the word for the season
[1:56:00] the other can't
[1:56:04] then brother brown said that needs to be
[1:56:06] preached about and
[1:56:07] preached on take you right back to what
[1:56:10] he said on that quote that needs to be
[1:56:11] preached about
[1:56:12] and talked about and preached on what
[1:56:15] the difference is
[1:56:19] because these two spirits would deceive
[1:56:21] if they could
[1:56:23] because they can do everything but they
[1:56:25] can't bring the word for the season
[1:56:27] in manifestation
[1:56:31] because they have no revelation of it
[1:56:34] why
[1:56:34] they lack oil
[1:56:37] dynamics have nothing to quicken there
[1:56:40] if it had the quicken it would quicken
[1:56:41] the word and you were predestinated for
[1:56:43] this season
[1:56:44] you were the seed of promise for this
[1:56:46] season now this day this scripture is
[1:56:48] being fulfilled in our years
[1:56:50] praise the lord hallelujah
[1:56:54] all right let's go through this now i
[1:56:56] want to get to this one point
[1:56:57] i said isaiah 22 22. and he said the
[1:57:00] head and the body are becoming one unit
[1:57:02] there's a lot of quotes here i'm passing
[1:57:04] up but
[1:57:05] the head and the body are becoming one
[1:57:07] unit amen
[1:57:08] you believe that you bet you he said
[1:57:12] they're becoming one unit anointed with
[1:57:16] that same spirit
[1:57:17] your anointed messiah of the hour
[1:57:19] brother man said show me a person
[1:57:20] completely surrendered to god and i'll
[1:57:22] show you a man that's omnipotent
[1:57:25] he said show me a person a bride that's
[1:57:27] so completely given over to god
[1:57:29] walking in that shekinah glory and i
[1:57:31] will show you the messiah on earth
[1:57:36] look at what he just pointed his bride
[1:57:37] to the revealing of the son of man
[1:57:41] there it is all right
[1:57:44] now he said and we see jesus pouring
[1:57:47] himself in
[1:57:48] that god is pouring himself in his
[1:57:50] people he's moving on the
[1:57:52] bride among the bride with a love affair
[1:57:54] to her pouring out himself into her
[1:57:57] and they are becoming one for the
[1:57:59] wedding supper
[1:58:01] the marriage has come
[1:58:05] amen and he's making the same
[1:58:08] manifestations in you
[1:58:10] a love affair an individual affair i
[1:58:13] don't think he mince words there
[1:58:14] no it's a love affair he called it an
[1:58:16] affair and he called this individual
[1:58:18] affair
[1:58:19] it's not a group affair if you have a
[1:58:21] group affair you've got
[1:58:22] denominationalism
[1:58:25] it never was a promise to the bride to
[1:58:26] be a group
[1:58:29] amen all right
[1:58:33] all right let's see i just i'll let you
[1:58:35] i'll let you go back and pick up
[1:58:37] in christ's mystery god revealed the
[1:58:39] headship and the body become one unit
[1:58:41] now we
[1:58:41] now when the word moves out of the body
[1:58:44] brother brown said they are husband and
[1:58:46] wife he said they are flesh of his flesh
[1:58:47] word of his word life of his life
[1:58:49] spirit of his spirit amen he said
[1:58:51] they're not twain any longer
[1:58:53] he said they are one he come right out
[1:58:55] and declared that they are one
[1:58:57] how could he say that unless unless the
[1:58:59] head had been here to say it
[1:59:00] right who is this brother who is this
[1:59:03] brother brown
[1:59:03] he said i ask you who do you say it is
[1:59:09] he said it's jesus christ among us
[1:59:13] friends
[1:59:14] amen
[1:59:17] oh we'll see that man but we have his
[1:59:20] spirit in us now
[1:59:22] same person in another form
[1:59:26] same spirit he that's joined to god to
[1:59:29] the lord as one spirit
[1:59:31] you are that holy spirit word anointed
[1:59:34] word living in you that is who you are
[1:59:38] that's what god sees you are then let
[1:59:41] off the pressure bride
[1:59:44] this ought to revelate your your heart
[1:59:47] here
[1:59:48] amen amen now
[1:59:52] okay just enough to finish this up
[1:59:57] brother brown said this what a beautiful
[2:00:00] thing i'm going to say it's just before
[2:00:01] we read isaiah 22
[2:00:02] 22 and 1st corinthians 7 14 and i take
[2:00:06] another half hour no
[2:00:07] no
[2:00:11] at least eight minutes i like eight
[2:00:13] because it's eternal
[2:00:17] it's the first all right
[2:00:20] brother branham said in the messy i
[2:00:21] remember what message is on you can look
[2:00:22] it up
[2:00:23] what a beautiful thing it is just to lay
[2:00:25] your life in his hands and say here am i
[2:00:27] lord
[2:00:27] yes
[2:00:30] hear my lord just use me now
[2:00:35] lead me and guide me and direct me
[2:00:38] in the way that would be pleasing unto
[2:00:41] thee
[2:00:42] watch he did nothing but what pleased
[2:00:44] the father
[2:00:45] he won't marry another other than that
[2:00:48] character
[2:00:50] are you with me he was a son he showed
[2:00:53] us what a son would do
[2:00:54] and you become son because you had the
[2:00:56] seed in you to be quickened
[2:00:57] and now it's become flesh when he comes
[2:00:59] flesh that makes you son
[2:01:02] are you with me but what was the eternal
[2:01:04] thing was that predestinated seed in
[2:01:06] there
[2:01:08] placed in there planted in there
[2:01:10] predestinated in there
[2:01:14] all right now just use me now
[2:01:18] lead me guide me and direct me in the
[2:01:19] way that would be pleasing unto thee and
[2:01:22] now watch what he says and then don't
[2:01:23] murmur no matter what the path is
[2:01:26] stay with it anyhow that's real
[2:01:29] submission
[2:01:31] that's where you know where you're
[2:01:32] standing you know you're in christ
[2:01:34] you know christ is in you you see what
[2:01:38] the whole picture is
[2:01:40] complete submission
[2:01:44] will god have a bride like that you bet
[2:01:47] he will
[2:01:48] will he have once completely yielded yes
[2:01:50] he will
[2:01:52] yes it does yes it does
[2:01:55] he's going to have one without spot or
[2:01:57] wrinkle peculiar people
[2:02:00] wash through the filter of his word
[2:02:03] amen there's only one thing you're going
[2:02:05] to draw through that promised word for
[2:02:07] this season
[2:02:07] you're going to draw the holy ghost to
[2:02:09] quicken that seed in your life
[2:02:11] now if you want more of him that's the
[2:02:12] way you get it
[2:02:16] amen amen that's right oh
[2:02:21] now and then don't murmur no matter what
[2:02:23] the path is you stay with it anyhow and
[2:02:25] god will work it
[2:02:26] all right
[2:02:30] the footsteps of the righteous is
[2:02:32] ordered of the lord amen
[2:02:34] all things work together i just won't
[2:02:37] read any more i've got a lot
[2:02:38] we could read let's just stop there now
[2:02:41] isaiah 22
[2:02:44] i must read this because this this this
[2:02:47] to me it caps it right off here
[2:02:49] exactly what we're talking about and if
[2:02:52] you've read in the church age book
[2:02:53] you'll know what i'm referring to
[2:02:55] isaiah i should have had this marked
[2:03:00] isaiah 22 22 but it's worth repeating
[2:03:03] again
[2:03:06] and the key of the house of david the
[2:03:09] emphasis
[2:03:10] is the key and the house the key
[2:03:13] of the house david was a king
[2:03:18] the people gave him headship
[2:03:22] he just didn't move right and say i'm
[2:03:23] your king whether you like it or not
[2:03:25] no they he he had to have favor with
[2:03:28] those people
[2:03:29] they gave him the headship over the
[2:03:31] house
[2:03:32] i want you to hold that in your heart
[2:03:34] right there
[2:03:35] all right but then to do that they
[2:03:38] submitted to david
[2:03:43] that's how it was given to him all right
[2:03:46] now
[2:03:46] david had a character like god's
[2:03:50] is that right god of man after god's own
[2:03:53] heart
[2:03:54] right we can learn a lot from david if
[2:03:56] you read about david
[2:03:58] all right now so he said
[2:04:02] and the key of the house of david will i
[2:04:05] lay upon his
[2:04:06] shoulder i thought this was so good
[2:04:08] after our brother preached on the key
[2:04:10] i may read the message a key of the key
[2:04:12] to the door
[2:04:14] and nobody well i did anyway
[2:04:17] it's a good message
[2:04:20] and you realize well i won't say that
[2:04:22] yet and i will lay on his shoulder but
[2:04:25] watch where the key is
[2:04:26] where the key is laid is laid on his
[2:04:28] shoulder
[2:04:29] so he shall open hallelujah
[2:04:33] i just remembered something now see lord
[2:04:35] wouldn't let me get by with that what
[2:04:38] does cleft mean
[2:04:42] what does cleft mean when you say you're
[2:04:45] hit in the cleft or the cleft of the
[2:04:47] rock
[2:04:48] see the clef it means
[2:04:52] splitting or opening of the rock
[2:04:57] opening of the word third poll
[2:04:59] revelation 10
[2:05:00] 7. what revelation 10 7 say in the days
[2:05:04] of the voice of the seventh angel
[2:05:06] the mystery of god this day this
[2:05:08] scripture is being fulfilled
[2:05:10] right here behind skin
[2:05:13] see the mystery of god would be
[2:05:17] finished that's our message that's the
[2:05:20] seventh seal
[2:05:21] that's the message of the seventh angel
[2:05:23] that's revelations 10.
[2:05:26] all right that secret is made known
[2:05:28] brother brandon said that secret hid
[2:05:30] under those seven thunders that missed
[2:05:31] those that mystery
[2:05:32] brother bram said it was mysteries then
[2:05:34] he turned around and said it's a mystery
[2:05:37] because revelation 10 7 said it's a
[2:05:38] mystery
[2:05:40] okay but it's a mystery of god
[2:05:46] then who are you the unveiling of yeah
[2:05:49] all right
[2:05:50] see and and the state and no matter what
[2:05:53] see see you just so in revelation 10
[2:05:56] said the mystery of god will be finished
[2:05:59] and you're to eat that mystery eat it up
[2:06:01] eat the book
[2:06:02] the book is the bride's book you ought
[2:06:04] to take it and eat it because it's your
[2:06:05] book
[2:06:06] it's revealing who you are it's
[2:06:07] revealing and unveiling himself in
[2:06:09] completeness
[2:06:09] and that's what puts the bride in the
[2:06:11] rapture brother brahms it will literally
[2:06:13] turn the heart of the people
[2:06:14] heart of the bride literally to the
[2:06:16] original faith
[2:06:21] all right now now so a cleft is a
[2:06:24] splitting of the rock or the opening the
[2:06:26] unveiling of the rock
[2:06:28] and revelation 10 7 is the third pull
[2:06:32] revelation 10 is the third reverend
[2:06:35] second
[2:06:35] first corinthians 7 4.
[2:06:38] let's take verse 3 let the husband
[2:06:41] render unto the wife
[2:06:42] do benevolence benevolence is respect
[2:06:45] due respect
[2:06:47] in the due time due season due respect
[2:06:49] to her
[2:06:51] meeting her need due respect let the
[2:06:53] husband render unto the wife do
[2:06:54] benevolence
[2:06:55] and likewise also the wife unto
[2:06:58] the husband now watch this verse the
[2:07:02] wife
[2:07:02] hath no hath not power
[2:07:06] of her own body
[2:07:10] now listen to this carefully the wife
[2:07:12] hath not
[2:07:13] power of our own body but the husband
[2:07:16] that word
[2:07:16] power is means authority
[2:07:21] the wife has not power of her own body
[2:07:24] but the husband
[2:07:25] and likewise also likewise also the
[2:07:28] husband
[2:07:29] hath not power of his own body but the
[2:07:33] wife
[2:07:36] amen all right you want to keep things
[2:07:39] in order in your home
[2:07:40] obey that scripture if you want to talk
[2:07:43] about
[2:07:44] you know the order if you can read
[2:07:46] between the line there
[2:07:47] the order of it that's physical but
[2:07:51] what the spiritual is saying here
[2:07:53] revolve submission
[2:07:55] yeah yeah okay now watch this in a
[2:07:58] submission there too
[2:08:00] okay now watch now we're going to go
[2:08:02] into what now if you want to read
[2:08:04] what i'm going to read of the church age
[2:08:05] book if you have brother george's book
[2:08:07] which is what i'm going to read i hate
[2:08:09] to call it that but you know what i mean
[2:08:10] when i say that
[2:08:11] this leather bound or the red back the
[2:08:13] red the red
[2:08:14] paperback volume okay it's on page 334
[2:08:18] through 335.
[2:08:20] i'd i'd think you'd want to go back and
[2:08:22] just
[2:08:23] read it over
[2:08:28] but 334 and 335 and in the regular
[2:08:31] church age book it's on 294 through 296.
[2:08:36] so they have a little different numbers
[2:08:39] they go by here
[2:08:40] because it's a little different print
[2:08:41] see all right i'm going to start reading
[2:08:44] here when he reads that scripture
[2:08:46] he that's the key of david and the key
[2:08:48] out of verse 22 here
[2:08:50] and the key of the house of david while
[2:08:51] i lay upon his shoulder
[2:08:53] so he shall open and none shall shut and
[2:08:56] he shall shut and none shall
[2:08:58] open and this is paragraph
[2:09:02] 38 if you want to know where the spirit
[2:09:04] now watch how who's using it the spirit
[2:09:07] uses this old testament reference
[2:09:09] concerning the lord jesus christ
[2:09:12] and his ministry in the church
[2:09:18] all right now we know that he's got a
[2:09:21] kingdom a domain
[2:09:24] he's the head of that church the body is
[2:09:27] that right
[2:09:28] his domain in my father's house are many
[2:09:31] dwelling places
[2:09:32] mansions okay
[2:09:35] and the body of christ is made up of
[2:09:37] individuals
[2:09:39] that are members of one person
[2:09:42] all right now so the spirit uses
[2:09:46] referring to the lord jesus christ and
[2:09:48] his ministry in the church
[2:09:49] what the key of david signified at that
[2:09:52] time
[2:09:52] the old testament time is mere shadow
[2:09:55] and that was a shadow
[2:09:57] pointing to a real here so it's a mere
[2:09:59] shadow which is now fulfilled
[2:10:02] in jesus standing in the midst of the
[2:10:05] lamp stands
[2:10:08] in the midst of where his body
[2:10:11] his bride in the midst of those ages in
[2:10:13] the midst of the lamp stands
[2:10:15] all right
[2:10:18] it has to do with our lord after his
[2:10:21] resurrection
[2:10:23] and not his earthly pilgrimage right
[2:10:26] but what does the key signify
[2:10:31] okay the answer lays in the position of
[2:10:34] the key
[2:10:36] it's not in his hand
[2:10:39] it is not worn around his neck
[2:10:43] it is not placed in the hands of other
[2:10:45] men
[2:10:48] or the verse could not be saying he
[2:10:51] alone
[2:10:52] has the use of that key for he alone
[2:10:55] opens
[2:10:56] and shuts and no man has that right but
[2:11:00] jesus himself
[2:11:02] the son of david that right all right it
[2:11:05] is is that isn't that right but what is
[2:11:08] where but where is the key
[2:11:10] it is on his shoulder but what does
[2:11:13] shoulder have to do with it
[2:11:18] and the gut he's referring now to isaiah
[2:11:20] 9 6 and the government shall be upon his
[2:11:24] shoulder so what does have to do with it
[2:11:27] that's where the government's laid
[2:11:30] the government of his body
[2:11:34] is laid upon his shoulder it has to be
[2:11:37] laid there
[2:11:42] amen now watch it's given something
[2:11:45] given here to him
[2:11:47] the government okay but what does this
[2:11:50] mean
[2:11:51] the answer is this the phrase government
[2:11:54] upon his shoulder comes from something
[2:11:57] it comes from the wedding ceremony
[2:12:00] of the east if you want to go back and
[2:12:03] see what the real
[2:12:05] line of the scriptural of wedding is
[2:12:08] go back and see what they did in the
[2:12:09] east amen
[2:12:12] it's just it's really contrary to our
[2:12:14] weddings today
[2:12:16] in some regards all right
[2:12:20] but what does this mean so he comes from
[2:12:23] the wedding ceremonies when the bride
[2:12:25] i love these words when the bride has
[2:12:27] been committed
[2:12:31] when the bride has been committed to the
[2:12:33] groom
[2:12:35] this is her vows are taken she's been
[2:12:37] given other words she's been given over
[2:12:39] into the hands of that man
[2:12:42] given over committed released placed in
[2:12:46] the hands
[2:12:46] of this man
[2:12:52] when the bride has been committed to the
[2:12:54] groom she
[2:12:55] takes off her veil remember rebecca went
[2:12:59] to meet
[2:13:00] isaac she was veiled why brother brown
[2:13:04] said she was coming to meet her husband
[2:13:08] so we have a bride here veiled standing
[2:13:12] and can then committed now and what's
[2:13:14] she signifying she's going to signify
[2:13:16] something now
[2:13:17] she says she takes off her veil and
[2:13:20] places it over the groom's
[2:13:22] shoulders
[2:13:26] she takes off her veil
[2:13:31] go back to what brother brown said
[2:13:35] in proving his word go back to what
[2:13:37] brother branham said i mean
[2:13:39] yeah improving his word but also in only
[2:13:42] that woman that could or the woman or
[2:13:44] man that couldn't yield
[2:13:47] look what she had to do
[2:13:53] she takes off her veil and places it
[2:13:55] over the groom's shoulders
[2:13:57] signifying signifying
[2:14:01] that not only is she under his dominion
[2:14:05] that she has transferred her rights
[2:14:08] to him
[2:14:13] god help us to see this spiritually the
[2:14:15] way you want us to see it
[2:14:19] she transferred her rights to him that
[2:14:21] he is the head
[2:14:23] but also also that he bears the
[2:14:27] responsibility
[2:14:30] and the care anxiousness you just cast
[2:14:33] your care on him
[2:14:36] see and the care and that he
[2:14:41] and he alone no one else
[2:14:45] no other man no other power
[2:14:49] has any right let me read that again
[2:14:53] he and he alone no one else
[2:14:56] no other man no other power has any
[2:14:59] right and responsibility
[2:15:01] and that beloved is the key
[2:15:06] of david
[2:15:13] she's under what his government
[2:15:19] she's given him the key to
[2:15:23] his house
[2:15:29] but then what does he do what has he
[2:15:31] done
[2:15:33] by placing his life in us his own faith
[2:15:36] his own life his own presence in us
[2:15:39] he's also given us the key to our house
[2:15:45] and our house isn't this our house is
[2:15:48] christ
[2:15:56] i was on a trampoline i'd do more than
[2:15:58] one flip
[2:16:02] do you understand this is powerful look
[2:16:05] at what this is saying
[2:16:06] look at here he says god being sovereign
[2:16:09] he foreknew by divine decree exactly who
[2:16:11] would be in his bride
[2:16:13] you believe that he chose her she did
[2:16:16] not choose him he called her she did not
[2:16:18] come in her own
[2:16:19] he died for her he washed her in his own
[2:16:22] blood he paid the price for her
[2:16:23] she belongs to him and to him alone
[2:16:26] brother brown another place said she
[2:16:28] is his eternal possession you are his
[2:16:31] eternal
[2:16:32] possession in order to be his eternal
[2:16:34] possession you had to be in him
[2:16:36] and being in him that makes you eternal
[2:16:38] right now
[2:16:39] on the inside eternal
[2:16:47] and not only that you're his kingdom
[2:16:49] you're his word made
[2:16:51] spirit and power in your own life
[2:16:55] all right she is wholly committed to him
[2:16:57] i like that wholly committed to him
[2:17:01] and he accept i love this and he accepts
[2:17:04] the obligation
[2:17:07] when i read that i just tell you brother
[2:17:11] sister
[2:17:12] i said that settles it you let off the
[2:17:14] pressure
[2:17:16] he's obligated to his word
[2:17:20] and i am his word made manifest
[2:17:25] amen i'm his word brother sister i am
[2:17:28] his word
[2:17:29] the revelation of jesus christ for this
[2:17:31] day is himself in bride form
[2:17:34] that's exactly what it is
[2:17:39] it had to be a complete revelation of
[2:17:41] the whole thing you
[2:17:42] him and you made you that
[2:17:46] oh praise the lord
[2:17:50] says she is holy committed him and he
[2:17:53] accepts obligation he is her head
[2:17:55] for christ is the head of the church as
[2:17:57] sarah called abraham lord even so the
[2:17:59] bride is happy that he is her lord
[2:18:01] he speaks and she obeys for that is
[2:18:04] her delight
[2:18:07] glory to god amen that is her delight
[2:18:12] amen okay i'm closing
