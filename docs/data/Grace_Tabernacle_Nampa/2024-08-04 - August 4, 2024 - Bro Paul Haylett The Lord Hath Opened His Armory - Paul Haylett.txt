without the invitation we'll never be there at that celebration amen and I just thank the Lord for for the invitation that he has given us his grace and his Mercy to us amen um sister Maria yes God bless you our sister Maria is here now living in boisey from Tanzania let's just give her a little welcome to the church here God bless you our sister amen God bless you Hallelujah truly this Bride is a universal bride am amen you can look right here in this church and realize how that God has drawn from all the continents the Nations here we see how God is so beautiful brother Tim is there any change in Sister Miriam's mom sister wrestler no amen the she was yes let's just remember Sister rler in prayer you know uh always kind of makes me a a little bit soft in my heart but we get to enjoy the beauty of life and we come to what you might say is is the point we don't want to talk about and you know the thing is it's all part of this we we see how that God works and there's nothing more special than graduation day and we don't like it in the flesh amen we we strive for life but let's just remember our sister Whistler uh she's done her best Through The Years be a good mother uh and um grandmother and uh coming to this stage of life and just may the Lord just give her a peaceful Crossing amen that's what we just desire amen so amen um there was something I was didn't write down because I would remember it um but my well let's just go oh I know what it was um how's brother Dan is his blood clot changing let's remember brother Dan amen I put brother on there because I've never let go of him amen he might not be here in Fellowship but I've never let go of him and we want the Lord just to touch that blood clot uh so that the doctors can do the things that they they need to do so let's just remember him in prayer Also let's turn in our Bibles today uh just uh thank you so much uh appreciate that musicians and brother Alex amen um I I'm just going to share a little something you know we had prayer in the back and um brother Chris had come and brother Alex prayed for the service brother Chris and I there and as brother Chris is going out the door he says um is there anything I can do for you and uh the thing that just popped out of me I said well a special song and brother Alex brother Chris looked at each other and said it's already happening and so you know sometimes just that little unction the Lord just gives right it's just all in continuity I I jokingly said to brother Alex did I just see that on your iPad and he said uh it's not written there so uh you know the Lord just knows amen and we thank the Lord I want to speak to you this come uh title of this sermon come uh from uh the uh uh scripture today and uh I I just uh it really struck me uh as it is that you when you look at this and realize how the word of God is true age to AG amen it's never come to a time it's not relevant uh I don't want to keep you or distract you but you know uh in some of my research and looking at things we're talking about what is relevant for this day and um the churches are changing trying to be relevant they they want to do and uh I come across a little video clip that was titled The Greatest Show on Earth then underneath it in parentheses the church and it literally showed the of a circus on the stage of a mega church and you know circus people aren't known for how they dress and there it is right in the house of God just being manifested out and I thought you know what the word is relevant for the bride amen she's not looking for something else she's not thinking I need entertained in the house of God she come because she's got a soul that desires to be fed she says I want the word because the word is my life amen and so I I just thought that was interesting as you just sometimes get on a little thread a little idea uh I I believe the ministry here would know what I'm talking about you just get on something and you don't always dictate exactly where it takes you but you realize at the time when you get there why you went there and uh I'm telling you my brother and sister God is good amen amen we live in a day that everything is so deceptive uh um you know know uh we we look at these things and uh sorry to to keep you standing but I just share this last little thought what was the title of brother Chad's sermon with the tuning Forks Sype sympathetic resonance I I would encourage you to listen to that because it shows right there in sound and I won't go into detail but it shows you right there in sound How Sound can be uh in this as he demonstrates so close that our ear doesn't know the difference but something tells us something's not quite right that's right and as it is there brother Chad makes a very strong point amen so close that you will not know the difference but the Holy Spirit In You amen will show you that there is a difference amen amen Jeremiah the 50th chapter I want to speak to you the Lord hath opened his Armory and uh so as we we'll come today uh and uh we we'll take this my brother and sister hopefully the Lord will just uh let it unfold very clearly and uh sister Sue not to embarrass you but welcome back it seems like it's been a bit since we saw you but uh family and surprise was it a surprise surprise anniversary amen nothing like delaying the presentation of the surprise to really make it a surprise and and um but to have the family and everyone together sorry I couldn't be there kind of felt obligated to some other situations and uh but God bless you amen Jeremiah 50 verses 22- 25 amen this scripture should be looked at in a current sense amen amen a sound of battle is in the land and of great destruction how is the Hammer of the whole earth cut aunder and broken how is Babylon become a desolation among the Nations I have laid a snare for thee and thou art also taken oh Babylon thou was not aware thou art found and also caught because thou Hast striven against the Lord the Lord hath opened his Armory and hath brought forth the weapons of his IND Nation for this is the work of the Lord God of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans I'd like to read verse five again the Lord hath opened his Armory and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation for this is the work of the Lord God of hosts in the leodan age Heavenly Father we ask you Lord just come speak to us today Father it is good to be in the house of the Lord Lord our hearts are happy Lord we are thankful father that we have a place and Lord as we will read a little later we realize Lord that it's not a building it's not but Lord we realize that it is good to be here in the house of God a church that you provided for us Lord and have maintained and filled it with Saints of lack precious faith that desire to serve you Lord how blessed we are today we thank you give praise to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated you know everywhere we look in the day that we're living I I don't want to sound like the the uh local news or or whatever but everywhere you look we we see things of the sounds of battle uh there's there's uh uh almost every continent um there is some kind of Riot there's some kind of warfare taking place and and uh when you look at this I mean you could think about it I'll give you a quick Glimpse you just look down in South America and Venezuela that there is all kinds of chaos and people dying over an election amen and uh we know that it doesn't matter in the world of politics which side is actually elected they're not there because they are serving God they're there because they are serving God oh did it sound like I was just a paradox but you see it's not there to lift up our Lord Jesus Christ Christ but they are there because God ordained for them to fulfill certain Acts or certain things before his coming and so there they are serving God Amen they're not in the house of God praising God worshiping God digging into his word but they are there as servants to serve God's greater plan and we'll look at this and and we can go over and uh here in North America you know it's it's interesting we see all kinds of spirits and conflict that is taking place uh we go to Europe the same thing uh we go to Africa uh the same thing Middle East same thing we look at Israel every country would stand and affirm it has a right to defend itself and then they'll stand in the UN and say Israel does not have that right and so you see that they are unsign uh uh uh un unbalanced in that that they're double-minded and and we see this sound of battle everywhere we go and we see the evidence of Destruction amen we look right here at the evidence of Destruction as the prophet of God speaks on this in just little little thoughts here and there and and forgive me if it sounds like I'm putting them together but I guess in reality I am uh the evidence of destruction in our nation is displayed very prominently in our young people our our children not our children but the the children it's very prominent it because there's nothing being done to help them find a balance in their life they simply say just let the children do what the children want to do and we'll touch on that in just a minute amen the very fabric of our nation we sit here today as Americans and and the fabric of our nation was built on the Constitution but you'll find that even that is now being slowly unwoven to achieve what man desires and we'll see that the very fabric of the church has been torn and it's there that we'll find that as I already kind of got ahead of myself that that the church has become a place of entertainment not of the word of God if a person preaches too hard I won't cite the case but Minister get a little move from God and preach a little bit too hard the church board has a meeting right after that and they tell him under certain clause in his contract amen the contracts between the church and the pastor not between God and the pastor and according to a contract that they're going to pull his contract because we don't want to be known as a church that is too hard my brother and sister what it is is they want to be entertained amen they're looking for someone as the prophet of God said that tall dark handsome guy only now it might be tall dark handsome woman I just was watching a little something I hope you don't mind I I've just decided to come out of the closet I I dig in some pretty probably you might think strange ways and looking at thoughts when something comes and I I want to find the root of it yes and when you find the root of it you you can then start to really understand how these things come down and how they start to grow and how all of a sudden you know being a farmer weeds are like you might say our arch enemy and if you don't pay attention a weed that is like this big in one week is this big and in two weeks is this big and in a month has taken over your garden that's it and so it's there that I I proceed to dig into these kind of things because I want to see where this route comes from and as you look at this you start to see my brother and sister that the church has come to a place that the appearance of the church is more important to them than the actual substance of the church and they want to look look like they are successful they have they have advertising campaigns and PR Specialists and they have all these kind of things but under the surface the prophet of God said they're rotten now Grace Tabernacle we need to hold one another accountable before the Lord amen that we don't come to a place that appearance becomes more important than having the word come into our life when appearance comes to the place that we need to make our song service perfect and and our our our our preaching perfect and uh the specials perfect and everybody looks and dresses perfect when that becomes we have failed we have not reached a level of prominence but we have reached a level of failure because we need to come and be organic Christians which means we're just who we are and that's the difference or what we can lift up is the very praise to our Lord Jesus Christ let our praise my brother and sister now I hope you understand this let our praise be perfect oh that doesn't mean we hit every note and we did this just right and that just right but our praise when it is perfect is acceptable to the Lord he says that I receive and I give blessing back for this praise I give a blessing to these people because I see their heart amen and we see the very fabric as I said of the church being torn and of the family my brother and sister you don't have to look very far to see the the fabric of the family is slowly being torn Satan's desire he doesn't care if we go to church he does not care one thing about where we go to church but if he can tear the fabric of the family then we sit in church we don't want to identify that we have struggle in our family we don't want to be open enough to say we're in chaos in our household but Satan's just happy to bring that and say you know what as long as it exists in that household there'll never be a Harmony in that household and it takes Harmony for us to come and mesh to the word I tell you I believe each every one of us myself included know what it's like when we come into the church to come to a service to worship and our spirit is torn our spirit is all rot up nothing is smooth and nothing is calm and we come to church and that very blessing that we could have received there we cannot receive because we're in an internal battle right and Satan knows that and then we walk away and say you know what I I have this issue I have that issue what you've got is a leodan issue that Satan hates you amen but when you recognize that it's Satan that's doing the hating amen then you can start to deal with these issues and then you can stand and and you can actually take a position I'll tell you I'll make a bold statement here I've been many times in my life where there was chaotic circumstances and knowing that I was going to minister I didn't come as some super spiritual man I come as a Son of God who believes the word and you come there and you bind every Spirit In The Name of Jesus Christ and the chaos my brother and sister is bound but if you don't bind it chaos runs rampant I've seen it in my life where children screaming and hollering running the aisles of a church service Message Church running the aisles of a church making noise and you stop and bind the spirit and those kids sit down put their hand in their lap no parent threatening them they'd already done that but the Holy Spirit coming bringing a peace and a Harmony and settling that down I say let we know the prophet said of George Washington Abraham Lincoln on every corner will not change the direction of the nation but I tell you you can pray for your nation because the prophet encouraged you to that it would be such for your benefit yes come on right I'm not into politics here but I'm just going to name it you think when God prophesied through the word and through a prophet what would happen in America you think Donald J Trump's going to change that no you think Mr Jo Biden or Camala Harris is going to change that my brother and sister when God spoke it nothing's going to change it and now let's roll this right over when God prophesied the word to you amen and he said you are going to have the rocky places made smooth and you are going to be an overcomer you're going to be brought into Perfection you're going to be brought into the very image of God do you think there's anything going to keep you from coming to that place amen amen amen he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the one who bound himself we didn't bind him he bound himself and made the Declaration amen hallelujah Isaiah I don't I don't remember yes I did it's there on the screen Isaiah 34 and5 and I will give children to be their princes and babes shall rule over them and the people shall be oppressed Everyone by another and Everyone by his neighbor the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient or our elders and base Against The Honorable my brother and sister I can tell you this day this scripture is fulfilled this is a time my brother and sister look we have riots taking place in cities and and that when the police go to arrest them when they realize these kids are underage they know what kind of problem they'll have to prosecute them they just turn them loose who's in control that's right the children the Olympics anybody ever hear about them they're suddenly the only news there is on Earth what is the Olympics celebrating mankind men and women their abilities but look where we're coming they can do what they want I don't I don't really care now they're coming to a place openly mocking God oh this is horrible what are we going to do my goodness the world's falling apart no thank you Lord prophecy is being fulfilled amen the word of God is coming coming to pass in this day because it tell us that they would be those that would mock God and they would be those that would be derive and and they would demean and they would do these things this is the word coming to pass never in history even the ungodly are saying this is such a shift what happened here I'll tell you what happened my brother and sister the evil of the age is coming to the surface and we say oh Lord what are we going to do well I'll tell you what you do just be ready when it's over amen don't be then be one of those saying oh let me have your oil but be one full of oil be one prepared for the coming because we're seeing that come to pass amen hallelujah is it okay to be excited this morning amen so now they're openly mocking God these are the sounds of Destruction when you see how it used to be I'm not so old but I'm telling you it used to be that if a man used certain words on the radio or television they censored them it ended the career of many a broadcaster and many commentator but now they use the Vain and the vulgar and the one the fox is guarding the hen house and the fox says it's okay you know I never thought about that fox know okay yeah the fox has now got his own television station H my so look at this when we look at the word go back through the message and I trust that you know the message well enough to I don't have to explain this but my brother and sister the prophet of God told us that the Babylon Spirit Babylonian Spirit was spreading through the land it was the influence of Jezebel she didn't have to have her own TV show her own publication just the very spirit that was there and and Jezebel was the best dressed most articulate woman to ever be in the white house I mean in the and it was that influence let me tell you I can tell you where it started the prophet of God put it right back to Jackie Kennedy that's exactly right amen that water bowl or whatever they call it haircut you know so that seems so simple even the church World said well that doesn't you know but then they embraced it now I can show you where it started can you show me where it ended you should be able to amen it shows Babylon conquered by their very own teaching their very own life their very own action will conquer them amen look at Rome for an example God gave a great example in the beginning in Natural History are we doing okay amen so you see this coming to a place that it will be in this way that that that people they are not out here actively resisting they will say well we we don't like the direction I this comes from a conversation we don't like the direction that our church is going I got bold I said well why don't you find another church come visit us well we're not ready to leave yet they're still there because there's no resolve in them to actually suffer for the gospel no resolve to actually make sacrifice for the gospel they they don't like it but they're not uncomfortable boiling frogs in Babylon amen I don't know if you guys ever listened to that sermon but it's really good amen hallelujah you can find that at hick on Hickory uh their website amen the heat just slowly being turned up I don't like it or church is getting worldly are you going to leave no I mean after all a hot jacuzzi is maybe better than a cold jacuzzi and a lukewarm one's way more comfortable we'll just sit here croak croak croak croak croak I really don't like it but I don't like it enough to leave I don't like it enough to change prophet of God said desperation is what's going to drive this bride to be ready for the Rapture are we comfortable or are we desperate that's it come on my brother and sister it's easy to be comfortable and redefine Comfort over and over and over again I'm still comfortable I'm still comfortable everything is falling apart it's in a hand basket headed down the road but I'm still kind of comfortable music over here you know is invading the Christian world now invading the message and we don't like it but we're we're getting more comfortable the more times we hear it sing amen I just listened or heard I should say I didn't go pursue it I just heard it uh Christian music that was so baseless they never met mention God they never mention salvation it's just always he that's it well Lucifer yeah one of his pronouns is he that's right yeah that's right you got to be careful whose music cuz he likes it amen now I'm not really much of a push on music right I believe the holy spirit will uh move you to know what music is right what will will Grieve Your Spirit and what will lift you up but I'm telling you it can be so comfortable and so gradual that it takes a place of real worship we want worship my brother and sister that God would come in our church today and say this worship is pleasing to me because if he cannot give us a well done then it's not so well done H okay second Peter 3 3 to 5 knowing this first that there shall come in the last days so no no other age no other time the last day scoffers walking after their own lust I don't recommend I'm not going to tell anybody to go look at the Olympic thing but I'm telling you they had a whole display with tens of thousands or maybe hundreds of thousands of people cheering it on yeah scoffers turning the Last Supper into mockery and no one on earth said we should censor this virtually naked people painted up to look like demons and no one says we should censor this walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming now and let me say this this is going to sound so judgmental forgive me the scoffers are wanting to know where his coming is but if they haven't repented and got right with God they don't want to see his coming they'll scoff about where's his coming but in reality they don't want to see his coming because they realize what it is there's an innate something that's inh Humanity that knows that there is something for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation and I say this this is a scoffer speaking so I believe I can scoff the scoffers not all things continue on as they did from the creation amen for the word of God says the cup of iniquity is filling up that's right so that's not the same as it was in the beginning their iniquity babylon's very action is going to judge Babylon their iniquity is being caught in the cup and it is is coming forth at the time they think it's all right they can rewrite the scripture they can rewrite what Holiness is they can rewrite what the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ is they can rewrite it these things that we have are are no longer idolatry they're worship and they rewrite the definition of that but it would be that very rewriting of the definition is coming now as judgment will come as judgment upon them and in that time my brother and sister they'll look back and realize they actually duped themselves there's no greater fool than the fool who fools himself is it okay to speak like that see verse five covers this for this they willingly are ignorant of imagine being willingly ignorant it it's just really hard to Fathom how someone would have all the facts all the evidence I just watched a little video clip as on I don't know Christian broadcasting or something like that and they have found some evidence uh I think over uh you know holy land or something and creationists are desperately trying to find a way to prove Pro that this is not original because what happens is is when they keep finding these artifacts can I be humorous for a moment had somebody send me a deal of a picture of ancient the Museum of ancient Palestinian history have you guys seen that it's an empty room there's the museum empty room but you see what's happening in Israel even in a time of War they're suddenly coming up with these things it's being discovered it's being brought forth and it's like more proof more proof more proof and they are willingly ignorant of that truth that's right can I get real personal here this morning we got right here in this day Supernatural signs and wonders now don't misunderstand me you guys know where I stand but my brother and sister we're going to leave brother brandom entirely out of this picture here as much as we can we're going to put it right off to the side there has been so much evidence of the revealed word in this day I'm not talking about what a prophet did I'm talking about what you the bride are doing what is coming to pass right now amen is so much evidence a preponderance of evidence would be enough to convict anyone or to set them free and they willingly won't receive that no no he told this story like this and then told it again like this just like you do amen and it's there that we see the preponderance of evidence in the life of the bride of Christ is proving that God has called a bride has supernaturally prepared her to be delivered from this world and they willingly disregard that because they see it as facts that are contradictory when the preponderance of evidence is right before them I could go off into quite a few different explanations that have come up as I've been looking through these things but my brother and sister second Peter 33-5 they want to know where is the promise of his coming everything's just went on like it is and for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water now I want to tie a little news fact with you right now down in California they have some neighborhoods in area right off the coast out there you might have caught this if I I look at the news online amen don't have a television look at the news online and this just keeps popping up in the news feed that these people have watched it started out their driveway cracked and then the street cracked and then it's there and now my brother and sister there is a 12T foot difference from the curb or the sidewalk to where their driveway used to be and they don't know what to do about it because it just continues to move and a prophet of God said California it's not going to blow up my brother and sister it's not going to do this or do that it's going to slide into the ocean and they're telling people in multi-million dollar homes telling them we'll no longer allow you to live in your own home even though their home is still somewhat stabilized one man at this point before they made that announcement had a 16t step ladder to get to his front door you something's going somewhere I'm telling you we're living in an age where something's going somewhere and the bride is not looking at that my brother and sister oh no it's sliding in the ocean the bride is looking at the word and the word says you're going somewhere and we know where we're going amen we're not going to worry about sliding in an ocean a tsunami an earthquake a volcano you know if you guys haven't seen it or not the greater Yellowstone Volcano has a circle that goes quite a ways past us really makes me nervous oh in Mountain Home Air Force Base is on Russia's list for a nuke to destroy their fighting ability nukes that have a 250 mile destruction radius anybody nervous yet I could keep going come on my brother and sister this is not what we're looking at this is not what we're living in the influence of this is not who we are we've been called by the word to come and be delivered from this situation amen now in the sermon hear ye himm brother Bram says this text we're speaking of tonight Jesus was taking three of his disciples for it is written in the word that in the mouth of two or three let every word be established do we have two or three that would speak together on the word today amen he set the scene oh just a second God was just about ready to do something and God never does anything without first he makes things ready he sets a scene for his great drama let me say this tonight if I never utter another word I believe that God is setting the scene for the greatest drama ever struck the Earth the reading of the church and the coming of his blessed son the Lord Jesus Christ Can someone say thank you Lord for that amen setting the scene for this to take place [Music] he's pulling his little flock together you thought you were doing it he's pulling you and showing the gospel in every sign and wonder in formed to the world that those who are partakers of the world will perish with the world and it is choosing time now amen and as he goes up to the Mount called Mount Transfiguration it must have been a wonderful place Peter later regarded it as the holy Mount he said that he was in now that doesn't mean that the mountain was holy H it meant the holy God was on the mountain oh I wish I could get you get that to you it's not the holy church it's a holy spirit in the church that makes it what it is it isn't the holy man it's the holy ghost in the man that makes him what he is now I want to tell you anybody make a mistake this last week you get a little upset how you know just a little whatever you want to call it amen I'm going to tell you that didn't cause God to leave you he just the prophet told us how he just sets up on the little Branch waits for our spirit to calm down but he's the one that's soothing your spirit amen so while we can say oh Lord I know that didn't please you he's there let me just use a PTY cat for an example he's there it's going to be all right it's going to be all right amen and when we finally go it's going to be all right he comes right down off the branch and he's sitting right with us again now isn't that an all-encompassing God Amen when you're all rough up by the world he's your calmer he's your peace amen and then when your peace is now manifested he comes right down and snuggles up to you again there's nothing better than that my brother and sister Hallelujah because you see in the age we're living in they've got a lot of holy things you go to Israel they got all kinds of holy spots holy spots that have signs out the doors please don't take your alcohol inside please don't take your cigarettes inside how holy is that my brother and sister when a people who claim to be holy live Unholy lives and want to celebrate the holiness by their unholiness no my brother and sister this is the day we're living in Hallelujah now I made a little comment brother Alex brother Chris in the back and now you'll see why I made the comment amen natural battles right we're seeing Israel uh Israel defending itself we're seeing uh uh you know some of the wars in Africa we're seeing things over here in in Asia all actively taking place natural battles amen and we're going to be my brother and sister as time goes on we're going to actually see that the greatest battle has already been prophesied to you and I it is not Gog and may goog it's not Armageddon it's the battle in your mind that's right amen the prophet of God didn't use those words greatest battle ever fought because it was a cool title he uh brought that out and and give that title because he knew this would be the battle of the age now I want to ask you is that true or not amen I tell you it's the the mind that causes us chaos it's the mind that miscommunicate it's the mind that misinterprets it's the mind that doesn't hear right it's a mind that doesn't speak right amen [Music] hallelujah so this greatest battle was supernaturally been revealed you wonder my brother and sister why people in chaos out here because they don't have a revelation of where the battle really is they think the battle is between husband and wife they think it's between uh what do they call them free whatever and the government our battle is with with the government no I'm sorry if they were running the government it would be just as corrupt just as evil so we have Revelation you did you ever think about greatest battle ever fought as a revelation that's right oh no Revelations when the Bible is opened up and Angels come come floating and fluttering down I'm telling you one of the greatest Revelations that been given to the bride of Christ is to recognize that thought that just went through your mind was not your thought God never claimed it as your thought never held you in judgment as it was your thought he recognize where that thought came from and he knows that your heart your thoughts are pure and holy and righteous but in the flesh we don't interpret it that way that's right but when you catch a revelation that the Great battle being fought in your daytoday life do I read my Bible or Not My Flesh says I'm too distracted as we pick up a novel and read it that's it that's exactly right I'm too tired come on my brother and sister I've shared this with the church I'll share it again I hope you don't mind but there come a time when I was pastoring the church here and we were farming a lot of acres and I literally was telling my wife I think I'm going to resign from being Pastor I I don't know why I didn't say I'm going to resign from farming I'm going to resign from pastoring the church because I can't do this it's just wearing me out working so many hours every day uh that that it's just ridiculous I and I know some people think I'm exaggerating to find yourself at the end of a year having worked like 2,800 hours you do the math it's brutal and I just was slowly convincing myself that if I have to give up something I'll give up pastoring the church and then the Lord one night spoke to me and said why don't you just ask for more strength well mostly because that's just too simple I've got nothing to fret over if I just have you know strength to do all of this I I I won't have anything that I can whine and cry about nothing I can lay down you know how many oh I'm sorry to be so personal but do you guys ever throw any spiritual Tantrums come on he I I'm telling the truth we throw spiritual Tantrums lord I can't believe what you're doing to me if you love me Lord if this was different I could serve you better wouldn't care if he gave you $100 million doar you'd still have the same exact battle only the scripture says that many Temptations destroy I bet that puts an end to buying lottery tickets see so what happens is this great battle has been supernaturally revealed and I I want you to catch this today if you don't catch nothing else that knowing the Mind battle that is in this day is a revelation of Jesus Christ will help you to be able able to stop and say was this from the word or was this from the devil amen what is it well I'll tell you if it draws you close to Christ it's from the Lord if it draws you away it's not from Christ amen hallelujah so here here we go hope I'm not too confusing the bride of Christ is is that you amen we're not worried about Gog and Magog we're not worried about oh I won't pronounce it right the valley of mehto we stood on the mountain in Israel looked down into it and they said this has absolutely been proven history all of these things from the Hebrew and whatever and even your King James Bible and this is the valley let's get out of here hurry up get us on the bus we got to get out of here no I'm sorry my brother sister that's not our battle amen we have already overcome that is not our battle amen no more than we're worried about the tribulation because the word of God showed us very clearly that God would not judge you for those things that have already been judged right he's not going to pull your sin from the sea of his forgetfulness he's not going to come back and you and when the bride judges herself oh thank God for communion amen thank God to be in communion with the Lord thank you that was good Hallelujah I just I just that was just the Lord I'm telling you I'm not touting brother Chris but just the fact that was a song that he chose my brother and sister I I just got a little excited a little flutter down in there because we have blessed communion and when we've been drawn into his presence what is on the outside of the veil no longer can concerns you and I we're not out here worried about oh the economy they're talking about hundreds of thousands of layoffs because the economy is slowing my brother and sister I live in God's economy you live in God's economy you don't live in the economy of Leo deia and I don't care if it gets tough God will send a word and your meal and oil will not run dry because God made that promise not man man's so worried about what will I do tomorrow I want to get a newer car I want to get a newer this a bigger house I want this and I want that I'm just as guilty I'm not speaking down to you I'm just as guilty but what I want more than anything is to live in God's economy I want to live in the word and watch that tree bloom and bring forth fruit my brother and sister not setting back well I I guess we better buckle up we'll have to go to church less cuz we won't be able to afford the gas ass well I'll tell you what my brother and sister this story comes out of Africa we're not lifting nothing up we're just telling you what God can do some brothers in a a Land Rover Cruiser whatever drove for hours out through the bush to a little town to preach and and the brothers see with with common sense if I can say it that way that doesn't really sound right but they drove into the little town where they're holding these servic and the one brother says we ought to put Petrol in the other brother says oh the service won't be all that long we'll just do it when we're headed back home sounded reasonable you know you're in a suit tie you don't want to smell like gasoline when you walk in church they get in there they start preaching those Believers start rejoicing start praising God start prayers being answered Deliverance is taking place and when they come out of the service that night just a supernatural event they come out of the service that night and they realize the gas station is closed and the one brother who is a little more familiar says well there is the one out at the intersection remember that guy lives there so even if we get there late uh we can get him to to um you know open up and give us gasoline they drive out there now the the gas gauge is on on empty they pull up up there and there's a sign on the door have gone to the city the one brother turns to the other one says what are we going to do isn't this human I guess we got nothing left but to pray we've exhausted all of our Human Solutions I guess we better pray now they prayed and the one brother says well there's actually in the morning we'll be a lot of traffic if we happen to run out of gas and most people carry a Jerry can with them so let's just go home they drive through the night they pull up at the one brother's house that owned the vehicle they shut it off they get out they go their ways go to bed come in the morning the brother and it won't start climbs underneath the vehicle and hits it this thing's empty or are we going to reason it we'd be late for church that was part I left out we'd be late for church but we ought to put gas in it the other brother says let's not be late for church let's just go my brother and sister where is the battle at that's right the battle is the Lord's it's not your battle it's his battle he's the one that's in control of the whole picture or he's not that's right is the Lord in control today no sir he is in control amen amen can you say that with me he is in control amen we think we got these Petty battles we think we got our circumstance it's different nobody understands my deal I'll tell you what we do understand as Believers he is in control amen we don't face Armageddon armageddon's not our battle my brother and sister the bride's gone amen Allelujah can we say that we're gone amen we're out of here our battle see now you can take this back brother Brown talked about how it was at this stage of time a few people and and and if any of this applies to you please don't feel like I'm criticizing or don't feel you know judged but brother Brown talks about how at this certain time there was a certain amount of the American public was taking a a pill to go to bed or sleep or whatever and you know and how and then the number increased radically I wonder what it is today yeah you know I tell you what you go they got a pill for everything yeah amen what they don't have is Christ but they've got a pill going to trade a sound mind for a pill now don't miss understand me I'm not judging on this every once in a while you know I might take a aspirin or a whatever it is I've taken a pain pill before Etc and we're not judging it that way but you see our battle is in our mind and there's a spirit of anxiety that blankets a whole nation it's not just you it blankets a whole nation wait a whole world this Spirit of anxiety has people so nervous what's going to happen and depressed my brother and sister depression and fear amen and you know what happens is all of these little isms cause a lack of confidence in oursel and we look at oursel and say I must be defective but I want to tell you how strong Spirits are spirits are so strong that you can walk into a house we have done this in South America walk in a house and the people sitting there almost sitting there in tears a whole family just in such chaos and come and by God's grace be able to speak the word and encourage them and take them back to the word and reach in I hope you don't mind me put it in this way but I reached into their mind by the leadership of the Holy Spirit and started stirring up their pure mind not a defective mind not a weak mind not a mind that's not God's but a pure mind and starts to turn in that up and you just watch the atmosphere change in that room and all of a sudden things start to come to pass and a sister that had a case of depression on her amen she comes and says brother Paul pray for me I'm not my brother and sister the answer to anyone's problem but I serve a God who is and you pray for them and that Spirit was broken and that s sister returned back into the church and started serving God again being a wife to her husband mother to her children and worshiping the house of God why because we serve an awesome God we don't serve a God that abandons Us in the desert leaves us on the side of the road as a broken individual but we serve a powerful God can we say Amen this morning we serve a powerful God and I'll tell you what happens when we get a lack of confidence in ourself we get a lack of confidence in God it's that simple might sound like well that's just too simple but I tell you what have you ever notice the difference in your own life and approach to life when you're prayed up and when you're not prayed up that's right come on that's right when you are prayed up the devil is this small obscure noisy individual in the corner that's right and when you are not prayed up he's 10 feet tall he's a giant and he controls your life that's it and that my brother and sister is the mind in the midst of the battle from one moment to another remember brother brandham prayer line that woman there oh you got a nervous condition oh I I see they called you a witch go watch it you'll see that woman just starts to tremble and then she's set free we'll close out in a minute with a quote here that you'll see why I'm making emphasis on this she's standing there falling apart mentally and it's touching her physical body because of what someone anointed by a devil said about her but she turned an ear to what they said Amen brother Danny steeman preached the sermon it's quite some time back we need to get the re uh revelation of delete and block and when we delete the devil and then block him right amen that voice no longer applies to you amen it's pretty awesome once in a while to uh steal ideas from other brothers yeah I was sitting there in the chair you know in the office watching brother Danny preach that and I'm just like so good oh Paul he was talking to you that's probably what made it good yeah see no confidence in yourself of who you are this is why a revelation of knowing that you are a son or daughter of God is so important cuz when the devil says you're a sinner you're lost you're weak you're this you're that or whatever you can sit there and say you know what in all reality devil from your point of view it's true but I'm here I've got blood covering me I've got the word covering me I'm living in the presence of God and that's not what he says about me he says I am righteous and I am Holy and I am his and that's all that matters it's not what you said devil I'm going to block you and I'm going to delete your message amen I need to hurry somebody pray that Paul hurries amen look look at the day we're living in is this not a daily onslaught of the devil come on my brother and and sister it's a daily Onslaught amen hallelujah Satan's Relentless attack you know it it it used to be that the devil would just come and you know he would do a little something here and do a little something there but you see he sees the clock unwinding his own self he he recognizes signs of the times and as that clock is unwinding he's looking at this and he says I got to turn this up and it's now become an unrelenting yeah voice that says just go live go live your life is short your life you know do this enjoy your youth enjoy all of this just do it I preached that the other day I don't know if it really soaked in so much or something to remember but remember my brother and sister the devil would like you to trade this life for eternal life and the Lord would like you to trade this life for eternal life the devil says live it up and God says take as much of eternal life as you can get a hold of same message see how close it is twins right in the midst live life to the fullest the devil's got a whole pile of cigarettes and alcohol and women and and men and whatever else how here live life to the fullest and God's over here saying live life to the fullest come on get in the word to get that deposit down in the soul amen get that sealed into you and when I call the word home you'll come with it amen but this guy over here he had a great time great time I know this might not be relevant to all of you but did you know that the Marl Burl man do you guys know who the Marl Burl man was he was so cool set on a horse perfectly rided Galloping roping stuff doing all this on a horse he was a master Horseman and he touted cigarettes and died at a modern times relatively young age from cancer that wasn't so cool was it why didn't they post at the end of that commercial that man on a respirator in a hospital gasping for life and regretting declaring with his own words to his family I regret every cigarette I ever smoked why didn't that make it to the come on now you change a cigarette to whatever it is out here in the world why don't they show you the end of that individual why don't they show you that really masculine perfect chest big arms whatever as a drunk in an alley or a drug addict in an alley an overdose case why don't they show you that but I'll tell you you what God is not afraid to show you the end result God's not afraid to show you you take my word and this is what it will produce it will produce eternal life it will produce strength A sound mind it will produce confidence in you of who you are amen God's not afraid to show you where he brought you from and where he's taking you to the Daily onslaught of the spirit of the age Satan's relentless attack you know that's why the scripture told us not to be weary and well-doing because it's it's a case it's a clinical study come on that's right it's right in the message you know that don't you was that Oral Roberts brother David Billy Graham Oral Roberts he's all tired can't do nothing yeah brother Brown said tells a story he says just told them what you need to do is get you know I'm going to paraphrase it my way get out of your mind and go out here and walk run exercise do something so it's actually a it's real it's real we can get so bound up in that yes sir weary and well doing that's second Thessalonians 3:13 if you need to look up the scripture come on I want to ask you today I'm closing we have a reason to Rejoice today Saints we're soldiers of the Cross are we not amen God has opened the door Amen to the Armory that's right any of you familiar that when I was a kid they allowed us to go down to the Armory and shoot in their target range so we got to go in there and and you know just the nature of things you got to see their big room all locked up concrete big door open it up here's all these guns imagine for a kid like myself I don't know if everyone's that way but you walk into a room and it's gun after gun after gun you know you're just like wow and then they would allow you to go out and and we could shoot at their indoor uh target Trap and uh man that was just major day Hallelujah you see my brother and sister the Armory is open y That's it the door has been swung open that's right the tomb now is empty that's right amen and we are standing here with every promise of God concerning a child of God and he's armed us amen the list is too great for me to go through the whole thing so I'll keep it simple but he's given us Faith amen amen we're armed with faith amen it's not our faith it's his faith in us on display amen he has given us strength and peace and confidence he's given us everything but the ultimate of it my brother and sister two ultimates let me put it that way he has given us the holy ghost that little room come on that little room we don't need a tent my brothers and sisters we don't need a tent set up in a little room we can walk in he's already taken us into that little room and deposited himself in us and then I'm going to skip over a couple things or not now look at this 2 Corinthians 10 3-5 though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our war Warfare are not carnal But Mighty amen through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imagination and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ my brother and sister this is speaking of a war Warfare right here every portion of this right here is talking about this Warfare going on it's not talking about to to bind ourselves with weapons and this and that and and you know be a prepper I believe in prepping I've been prep prepping but I'm more worried about the power going out amen ought to have a little extra water a little something you don't mind you know maybe 100 200 boxes of granola bars made with all kinds of stuff you can't pronounce so that they'll survive even a nuclear blast and still be edible and the only other thing that will survive the nuclear blast is cockroaches and so maybe you and the Cockroaches can sit down and have lunch together amen come on what do we need to be Preppers for come on are We any Preppers here we want to be Preppers the Lamb's wife has made herself ready she's prepping oh Hallelujah I think it ought to make us exciting myself amen so you know Satan wants you to think you're defenseless come on can't change your situation but the prophet of God shows us so clearly I cut a bunch of this out we're empowered by the word nothing else amen my brother and sister we're not empowered by the church or the pastor or whatever it is we're empowered by the word amen and you know it's not even how much we can quote no cuz if it was I'd be in Jeopardy right I just tell you how it is around our house a phone number that I probably call 500 times you know or or more and I'm like what's their number Jerry what's their number why do I need to remember she remembered you're not going to get to the early Gates St Peter's not going to say now if you can quote verbatim 250 scriptures will let you in even though you are an idolator cursing drinking all of these things but because you can speak 250 script no come on it's not about how much we can quote my brother and sister it's how much we can let Christ live through us there's the answer when he lives through US my brothers and sister his we can be as dumb as a rock I said we I'm not talking about you I'm talking about me let me rephrase that me can be as dumb as a rock but as long as the holy spirit is flowing through US Christ doesn't see you by IQ he sees you by the heart hallelujah we're not defenseless we're not powerless we are equipped according to the word of God but you know what you got to do you got to learn how to fight I don't know I'm not glorifying this but do any of you really know how to fight amen how about natural guy's bigger than you he's faster than you quicker reflexes do you know how to fight him oh I was talking to the devil sorry I was talking about the devil I mean he's faster smarter Etc you know how to fight him that's yes we don't have to try and figure this out we should be figured out long ago amen we come back to this now we're we're getting to a close here amen and thy seed shall possess the Gate of the enemy hallelujah hallelujah pop that up there brother Gideon now I'd imagine when a trial come up what's the first thing a child of God has for a refuge when a trial comes the greatest weapon was ever put in the hands of mankind that's it amen not 500 hours in the gym sparing tundu karate all these whatever things no my brother and sister not in the boxing ring not lifting weights not working on our flexation so that we can kick them in the head no sir the greatest thing prayer amen it even changes see I love this quote actually I just love brother brandom's Kentucky phrase here it even changes everything Hallelujah prayer amen amen not us you know making threats to the devil or not begging God my brother and sister prayer amen that equalizes everyone in this building young and old puts us on the same level that our prayer coming gives us power Amen in the age we're living in it changed the mind of God one time God told his Prophet to go up and tell the king he's going to die and the King turned his face to the wall and said Lord I beseech you to consider me I've walked before you with a perfect heart I need 15 years longer and God spared his life 15 years longer Prayer Changes Things oh Hallelujah I know one thing I need a better prayer life amen I do a lot of prayer my brother and sister there's times I I just pray all day long and I still feel inadequate of my prayer life hallelujah amen sister Ruth why don't you come I need some encouragements to stop see we're that spiritual seed my brother and sister It's Time come on Church let's shed whatever Spirit it is that hinders us let's shed that let's come today I'm not talking about have to come to the Altar and cry and Aller I'm talking about you with a certainty that you are a or daughter of God to come and say you know what Satan I have deleted you and I have I have blocked you here you're you're just gone you're just gone now one last little quote here this one I hope doesn't hurt too much now if it is written go and go and catch this whole thing so you get it totally in context now if it is written on a little paper or whatever it is doesn't mean so much that's right in other words the size of the piece of paper that's right a message I don't know if I yeah I have a piece of paper here the message written on this size of paper is no less important the one written on this size of paper no more important this size no more important than this size no more important than this size that's it it's the message amen [Music] whatever it is it doesn't mean so much but it's a message that it bears and it's a pardon for sin it's a healing for sickness it's a remedy for worry amen and it holds and gives everything you need in this journey and everything that we need in the great beyond Hereafter here's a punchline all Lays in what you think about Christ tonight amen today amen right here is he a God that's just judging you and you'll never you'll never live up to it or is he a God that said I am here Amen to make sure everything you need to make the Rapture that's right is here already provided to you amen now who who you going to trust sorry to pick you out sister Grace if you live good enough if if you just live good enough and tow the Mark just perfect sister Becky if you tow the Mark just perfect brother K sister Alice you got to tow the Mark just perfect though or a God that would come to you and would say you're going to make it cuz I have already provided then it's not about us amen it's
