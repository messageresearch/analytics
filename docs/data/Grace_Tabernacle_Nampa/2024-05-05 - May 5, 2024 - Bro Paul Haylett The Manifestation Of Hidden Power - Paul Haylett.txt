then Lord touch our eyes touch our understanding guide us today Father we bless your Holy Name the name of Jesus Christ amen amen and amen and amen hallelujah is it good to be here today amen I say it's just really good to be here today amen you know this thought is upon my heart today and I share with you I I was just come across some quotes in my studies and you know sometimes things just profoundly touch you it's like a spark comes and you're just like wow I know I've heard that I know I've read that but that was good you ever have that happen amen where where you just know it was literally not you listening to a tape or you reading a page it was our lord Jesus standing right there saying hey I I've got a little something special for you today I got something I want to encourage your heart with this amen and now obviously you know I support five-fold Ministry 100% but you see the five-fold ministry is an expression of Jesus Christ and so that five-fold Ministry can take place on your recliner or your kitchen table in your car wherever you're at that five-fold Ministry which is truly our Lord Jesus Christ can speak to us we just need to say Lord let my ears be unstopped let my heart be open I want to hear from you would that be our prayer amen a Sunday it should be every day but it's Sunday and Lord I want to hear from you today amen I want you to speak to me that guy that's in the Pulpit Lord he's just there use him use him Lord amen I say this a little bit uh in humor but it doesn't matter if he goes home rung out it doesn't matter if he is just finished in the flesh use him Lord I want to be blessed today amen hallelujah God bless you all thank you wonderful our musicians amen wonderful song service thank you Lord I would like today to turn in the Book of Judges we're going to speak on the title or thought of the manifestation of hidden power and uh there's several places that brother brandham uses this phrase uh and um we just want to come and draw from several several thoughts that we studied today you know how you get started down a vain certain direction you go in and you kind of start searching that out I I don't think it would edify today if I read every quote that brought me to this place today amen but it all ties together and it ties together beautifully amen you know as Carpenters I've I've helped build you know I don't want to exaggerate so we'll just put it I've helped build hundreds of homes and in all my years from my youth and in the best of our work there comes a time that you have to shave a little here and it's you know you don't want the homeowner to see you out there with a sledgehammer straightening up the walls of their house but sometimes in the human element we find ourselves in a position where we just have to be straightened up by the word amen nothing to be be ashamed of the best of our work is still short but God comes and says I'm going to straighten this out for you I'm going to put it all in order and you know I just been studying some thoughts and started off on all this thing and you might call it a tangent but it was there you know it led me from one spot to another spot to another spot to another spot and there's a few of those spots you know I believe in being transparent there's no use acting like the ministry as some Flawless people that never have problems and always always get it right and I have to admit in the last couple weeks the Lord just kind of said um Paul that little something is not quite right that's right and you have to stop and you have to repent amen you have to say forgive me Lord that's right we never want to be lifted up to the point that we think that it's just preaching that's right we never want to be lifted up to the point we just think oh it's scripture I've heard it before but we want to stay at the point this is my God can we say my God Amen is talking to me amen and if he was here today talking to us we would not turn our ear away but we would say Lord thank you for speaking yes sir amen how many believe that God's speaking to you amen that's the word that's the life judges 16: 19- 22 amen now I encourage you to go back if you haven't read this for a while just let these little details speak to you uh certainly here it is that we know now I want to put a a a preface to this if we Judge Samson too hard then we'll have to take him out of the book of Hebrews we see a lot of mist takes we see a lot of stuff that we'd say how did God let that happen but in God's eyes he so chose to bring him back up in The Heroes of Faith and place him right there in the book of Hebrews and I say that not justifying Samson but I say that to you today to Remember When God chose you that's right he chose you with all of your Earthly flaws included oh thank you Lord amen I've got some Earthly flaws amen and God knew I would have these flaws knew you would have these flaws but he also knew that his word would set you right back where you belong amen he's not going to say they're flawed let them go they're flawed they're flawed they're flawed in fact you look through the scripture you'll find more men that God used that had flaws then you will find that we're perfect amen thank you Lord for choosing us amen so here we are into the story of Delilah and Samson and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and she caused him to shave off the Seven Locks of his head and she began to afflict him and his strength went from him and she said the Philistines be upon thee Samson and he awoke out of his sleep and said I will go out as at other times before and shake myself and he whis not that the Lord had departed from him now I want to insert this let's be careful that we don't put our place ourselves in a place where God's departed from us yeah see this is a man that's in the book of Hebrews that's right but God departed from him and shake myself and he wish not that the Lord had departed from him but the Philistines took him and put out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with feathers of brass and he did grind in the prison house and verse 22 my brother and sister it's such an incredibly powerful scripture sir because you'll see on one sense it's almost out of time if we're looking at this whole Arrangement but God wanted the point to be made how be it the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven and now we can say well that's just natural but I need you to catch the spiritual vein today that when we make mistakes and we are repentant of that as it were our hair begins to grow amen hallelujah thank you Lord for your word guide us today father let the word just bring joy in our heart Bring correction let it raise Faith father whatever we find necessary today Lord I believe it's here in your word we ask for your blessings in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated in that we look at what we might consider to be a natural reaction but my brother and sister this verse 22 goes far beyond natural it goes back that the very moment that he failed the very moment that we would say I don't have faith enough I the very moment we would look in the mirror and say I am not an overcomer the very moment we would doubt who we are in Jesus Christ and God would come and speak to us through his word amen the Holy Spirit come down and start to nudge us and the hair of your faith amen might sound like an awkward statement but the hair of your faith starts to recharge again and the reason I can say that and I know that and I will say that just very factual and drive that home is you're here this morning amen cuz if it wasn't a Rejuvenation it wasn't a restoration my brother and sister if it wasn't the word coming back we would have fallen and failed many many years ago and never would we be found again but you see even in the very moment of our shortcomings of life amen faith is already Rising back up again we're already being reminded of the word we're already being reminded by the Holy Spirit of hey look this never was about you it's about me and when we come to that place to recognize that God is in us and that we cannot falter or fade away my brother and sister because God has never failed God has never faltered and he will never leave us nor forsake us where regardless of our circumstance you say but I've had the hardest Trials of my life it doesn't matter what the trial is in fact sometimes the ease of living is more dangerous than the hard trials that we Face amen now we look at this and I just want to just kind of dive into this please uh hold on very close cuz I'll admit I kind of jump around here and there and and you look at this but I want you to remember here starting with this scripture at verse 19 she made him sleep upon her knees amen and it was there my brother and sister in that time if if Samson had been awake and he had saw the razor he would have pushed back it would have been that he still would have strength to resist everything but in his sleep in his Slumber he never saw the razor that was coming to take away his locks of hair and it's this age that we're living in the age of leoda that Satan wants to lull us to sleep and we say but well you know we're laboring we're struggling we're doing this my brother and sister now pardon me to put it this way but we have a first world problem even in our financial problems we're better off than the rest of the world even in our struggles we're in a better position than the rest of the world and I say every developed Nation as a great need to stand up and hear the word preached with strength and authority and the anointing of the Holy Ghost because we are being wooed to sleep Satan has come you know the more you have the more you have to devote to take care of that's right but in the very Spirit of laoda the more we have we want more that's it we desire more we long for more we labor for more and then in that we buy increment increment increment are drawn into the care of life and so it's pulling us pulling us constantly pulling us now my brother and sister the age of sleep and Slumber we look at this you know drawing this out of several different thoughts I like I said I'm kind of going to have some big steps here but we look at the Spirit of Jezebel my brother and sister if Ahab had ever just went down and just married him a good consecrated girl oh the direction of Israel would have changed but he went out and he found that pretty little girl all dled up what we see it was all the covering of an evil heart and this is the world we live in in our big churches and our Beauty and our fine clothes is that we're looking at the outside my brother and sister and never realize that the very nature of it is an evil heart that is causing to draw people away you see as it is I I just want to go back and touch on that see she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man called for someone to come be a representation of the authority of the day be a representation of the word for the hour call a man to come and be able to say we can justify our behaviors and our things and what we believe and what we speak and preach and do all of this by our position not God's position that man came maybe he was a simple Barber but he was anointed by a spirit Spirit to come and destroy the vow that he had Samson had in his life that man with a razor was a vow Destroyer he didn't have to be a great man he didn't have to be a knowledgeable man but he had the knowledge of the razor and he cut off Samson's locks and Samson never even knew it right now it's going to start a sound a little direct and I'm sorry if it does sound judgmental but let's just quit dodging around the facts my brother and sister a son or daughter of God would starve to death in a church out here that's they would starve to death and they would then be weak and they would start to Slumber and sleep and their locks their spiritual locks would be cut off and they'll find themselves saying you know what I don't see any difference between this and this I don't see any difference of their interpretation of the Bible and what the Bible itself actually says now it's there in that world my brother and sister that we will find that Satan working in such a subtile fashion recently dealing with a man wanted to get married and it was a difficult it was a difficult but not difficult decision for me to make and you know he I asked him I says well so why is there not a minister in your church that will marry you and and he made a statement that I thought was profound we don't like the preacher and then after he explained himself I kind of understood almost become sympathetic and I said well what is the reason you don't like your preacher and he said well they ordained him and his wife to be the pastors and we don't agree with that now here again please forgive me I just want to make this point they don't agree with a man and a wife being the pastor but there's not anything else they preach that they disagree with they found one thing that they could latch on to and say we don't like this but I know the church I've been to to different activities at that and I know many people that go to this church and my brother and sister this is a part I don't want to sound judgmental but I am going to make this point they're off the word in so many places having a Woman as a co-pastor would almost be the least of their issue that's right but it strikes a cord so there's always going to be a man that'll be out there Desiring to shave off your locks to shave off your faith to do away amen so as we look at this this Jezebel and Delia spirit are exactly the same spirit amen Ahab raised up in a wishy-washy household but still if he had been connected married to a Godly little girl he would have went a different path but he was there and the point that as a man he didn't have any real conviction deep enough conviction and so he marries this little girl uh Jezebel and she now becomes the greater voice greater than God greater than the priests or the high priests or any of these men greater than that this voice did and that voice was wooing Ahab as it were to sleep on his knee on her knee it's okay it's okay God understands we can worship any way we please we can worship in the Groves and we can worship in the incense and we can worship in all of these things and wor that way it's going to be okay cuz God's still God familiar now we see Israel at that time was under Philistine Rule and we'll look at the church in Israel at that time under this Philistine uh rulership that the church had become very loose in their service to God now you had real Believers I hope this doesn't skin anybody but if it starts to skin you just let it skin you amen you come to a place that we get so loose in our worship that you know we're just like hey God understands and and just like the world the the message needs to understand people's needs well I'll tell you we have one need and that's called we need Jesus Christ every other need that we have we can inflate that and raise that up and make it an important point in our life well I need they don't understand me no don't tell me that you're going to use that line that the preacher don't understand you you're not talking to the preacher you're talking to God and if you think God don't understand you then I well I don't even know what to say about that amen God knows your heart amen he knows every thought every need that you have don't talk about the preacher talk to God about it let the preacher speak to you but let it be God's words that are being spoken not a man amen they become very loose in their service to God and you realize when that happens Saints if Grace Tabernacle gets loose in their service to God it's not going to affect just the weak ones in the church it will affect every one of us from young to old it will leave a mark on each one of us and this is what happened in Israel amen so they started to live they started to live at a level of the expectation I want to ask you this morning what's your level of expectation for yourself right you see I can't set that level for you you have to set that level yourself amen this is why the prophet of God continually talked about his own life as he needed to be more sincere man I tell you what you put my level of sincerity next to his level of sincerity and he says he needed to be more oh it's just cuz he's a prophet no he was a Son of God Amen so we can't come back and say well our level is just fine we need to raise the bar but you see what happens if I the pastor raise the bar and you have trouble in your life then you blame the pastor so I'm going to ask you this morning will you in your heart this morning or if you want to lift a hand say Lord I want to raise the bar I want you to raise the bar I want to live at the raised bar I don't want to settle for a mediocre Christian life I don't want to settle as a borderline believer I want to rise up amen the song says there's a New Testament Church rising up Saints don't go looking down the street don't go looking on the internet you are the New Testament Church that God planted here in this Valley amen we don't need to look for someone else and say oh it's them it's you it's you that he's asking raise the bar amen I've heard too many times and I I don't want this to sound I don't know why I keep going back judgmental but I don't mean it in fact my heart is flooded with Grace this morning because I need it amen amen it's not all about just oh you guys you guys no my brother and sister there's things in my life I'm just like Lord help me raise the bar higher this bar is not high enough Lord I know it's not high enough Samson started consorting with Delilah I hope you don't mind me being a little straightforward I can see Samson you know brother Brown said he was n some great great big huge muscular guy but I think he was probably you know there was something about him he sees Delilah my look at that girl said turning his head he turned it the other way pretty soon who is that girl oh that's Delilah hey hey you he started consorting he started being in arrangement of two together you think Samson if he' to realized that Delilah's whole goal was to collect the bounty on Samson's head in the modern day we you know oh oh they married for money I don't know that there's anybody in this church would be able to stop and say yep I'm married for money CU we ain't got enough money around here to really count but I tell you it's a nature it's a spirit that people constantly they want something better but what the prophet of God said you find someone with the Holy Ghost and character and you've got it right there amen I kind of simplified that but you see my brother and sister that Delilah knew what the Philistines wanted to do to Samson but they couldn't seem to do it they approach him with an army he defeats them with a Jawbone they lock him in the city he carries the gates away everything that happened and Samson didn't sound like too nice of a guy in a sense because you know when they behave like they did he just went out here and caught a whole bunch of foxes and tied their tails together and burnt all their wheat and they said we're going to get him for that was just an excuse for him you might have something in your life that you know shouldn't be there and youd say well the devil's the devil got me because of this no he didn't he just wants you he finds any excuse he just wants you that's right yeah we'll touch on that just a little bit more here so as it is he starts hanging out with Delilah and my brother and sister if he had never laid his head in her lap come on never laid his head in her lamp h a never never had that issue but the prophet of God defines this he says right there see she he started laying his head in a worldly lap that's right he started to come my brother and sister and brother brandom also in these words lays it out very beautifully uh and that if we had not come into that never laid our head in the lamp amen we would not end up in a compromised position that's right you see there's many there's many you know brothers sisters in the body of Christ and you could say well you know sister so and so she's just a really nice sister just really really like her got a great personality she's such a helper all of this the prophet of God says you know a sister should never even wink or do anything that would draw that man's attention that's right see and so I I put that in there for us to realize the devil will use anything he can use now I'm not saying we shouldn't be brothers and sisters be friends Etc but we need to keep that level of decorum correctly because if Samson would have stood there that day when he first saw Delilah and said I Samson am a Son of God and that is not a daughter of God so therefore the only Fellowship I'll have with her is to tell her there is a word of Saving Grace a Christ that will come and redeem her and then go away from that but my brother and sister even that becomes a sketchy thing because Satan will anoint that just like some folks I know amen got caught up in a deal she had a dream that she was married to the wrong man at the same time devil working in tandem gives a dream to a man you're married to the wrong woman this is your wife that's your husband they divorc their spouses caused Great havoc in their families they didn't even make a year in their own marriage and both knew it was a mistake but it was revocable see how the devil Sly old Fox amen we probably ought to teach the congregation that song kids song We ought to maybe be singing that here Sly old Fox amen I don't really know the words from that I've heard the kids sing it shout it jump up and down stomp their feet but it it's a very adequate song He's A sly old Fox amen so he laid his head in the lap ended up with this compromised result and he got wooed woed like a moth to the flame we won't go into the sort of details but he got woed like a moth to the flame she was so beautiful and he was so consumed with lust yeah now lust isn't always just a fleshly thing my brother and sister people can lust in the spirit right they can lust and get caught up in things starting to create their own doctrines their own ideas their own things and and they do that and you'll see how that spirit is accepted now there's people that say well you know William brandham put himself in that position over there and and he was no way he was called of God he made mistakes he did all of this and he did all of that and they are judging that my brother and sister do they have facts I'll tell you what you'll find this an interesting thing probably already know it the critics that are writing books against what you believe all cite the same flawed references do they come up with something new no sir they they cite this it's their reference because so and so wrote this and therefore it has to be true there's only one writing that is true on this Earth and that's the word of God Amen if we're going to cite something as a reference cite it out of the scripture and if you can't cite it out of the scripture don't bother to cite it that's right amen so we see how it was like I said she was was in it for the money right because soon as they have shaved his head they showed up with the reward for her she had no love for him and I'll tell you right now I I I just maybe I'm speaking a little too boldly this morning but if you think this world loves you if you think there's one thing in this world that loves you you're grossly mistaken amen this world will sell you as though you were litter on the side of the road to be recycled you'll see it over and over again oh the devil blesses his own you better believe the devil blesses his own but if you think that you're going to join the ranks of his Elite by selling out to him you'll find yourself in the world of hurt while his influencers isn't it interesting Saints how we come down to a time and age that growing up I never heard the word influencer now I must admit I've been hiding under a rock out in the countryside somewhere for a lot of years decades but you know what does it suddenly come you've got people they're Tick Tock influencers they're YouTube influencers they're I can't remember all the rest of those other whatevers cuz I could care less about them influences do you go do a search you will you find an influencer that is saying get back to the word go to the word go to the word no instead you find influencers that want to influence you like they've been influenced that's the only thing they know and the devil's saying I'll send you a check to influence some more that's right H strange okay now it's time to raise our hands how many of you look at Tik Tok what's the other ones I can't even remember what they're called anyway no my brother and sister this is the world we're living in so she wanted his secret she's willing to do anything she's anointed to do anything to get his secret now I want to draw you off on a little uh Rabbit Trail here for just a moment and the prophet of God shares that is seen the tent Vision a and he's starting to describe and and share this this Vision that he had now I've always found it remarkable but become more real to me in these later years here you see the prophet of God is talking about that little tent and that little room in that tent and the people are going in they go in sick they come out healed they go in deformed or disfigured they come out perfectly whole they come go in there with spiritual disease they come out amen and so it's there that I can see it now in the in the age of the CNN and Etc somebody's going to be like what happened in there I want to know what happened in there so we can make a story about this amen put it on Tik Tok but you see what happened my brother and sister when that person I would say believer goes into that little room and something happens to them in that room have you been there yes sir amen we should all be to lift a hand and say I have been there amen explain it to me explain it come on we need to publish a book on how to go into the presence of God and come out and we're going to put it up it's got to be Sensational well it is Sensational but it's a secret and it's a secret between you and God it's not between you the pastor in God it's between you and God and I say as a pastor I care about your experience but I can't give it to you I can't make it happen it has to be real to you and you have to be on fire when you come out of that little room I don't think my brother and sister you're going to have seen people coming out of that little room what happened in there I can't explain it huh come on on if we haven't been in the room or we haven't been let me rephrase that if we haven't been in the room recently oh this wasn't a one-time experience when God called you he called you again and again and again and said Come On Come Back To The Well of Grace come back to my word come back to the life what happened in there God touched me I can't explain it but one thing I know he touched me yeah wasn't the preacher it was Christ himself am amen so look at this pattern this another thought that I have in my phone maybe to preach on some more but you look at the pattern when the church now let's not talk about the church in general the real church when the real Church finds herself acting like the world Now set on your hands I don't need a a show of hands cuz I know it's every one of you how's that for us amen that we get a little something we start to act like the world Amen Christian music might be one of those cuz it's just easy it's Lively you need cheer it up you think that word being sang by someone who doesn't really even believe believe in the Holy Ghost that's true is going to cheer you up no sorry I'll shock y'all if you're listening to gospel music of somebody who's not got a clean Holy Ghost filled life you might as well be listening to Elvis sing Amazing Grace because there is no difference and you guys would be like Oh Brother Paul is listening to Elvis sing Amazing Grace what's wrong with him well I'm sorry Elvis and Hillsong are related I just kill that cuz Hill song sings a couple songs I like the lyrics too you don't know how hard that was for me to say that now you look at that my brother and sister if it's not filled with the Holy Ghost what's it filled with that's it amen if it's not inspired by the Holy Ghost what's it inspired by I don't want to sound critical but I'm telling you we have to understand the age that we're living in Delilah wants your head in her lap amen amen and you know what it is the real Church finds herself acting like the world and the leodan church wants the secret of the hidden power without making any sacrifice that's right somebody had sent me a little deal it might have been sister Jerry I don't know but I'm cleaning up my phone I cancelled it the other day or deleted it but it it was a little deal talking about when the uh uh modern day Christian wants to have Christ but not give up the world hopefully that's not us if it is just lift our hands right now and repent if that's us that we want these things without any sacrifice then I say Lord forgive me Lord help me amen we can't be the world and have Christ we got to choose my brother and sister amen No sacrifice no gain amen you see there's really no manifestation real Godly manifestation without God's blessing no matter how anointed the preacher is or preachers no matter what kind of program we have in church God's only going to truly bless now let's this gets far off there and I I don't want to go there but you see people can have what you might call marginal faith and God will still heal them he actually requires more out of you than he does out of some of these people in the world CU you know better you know the truth you know the life you know the way that God has for you but because it requires more sacrifice for us sometimes we'll look out here in the world and say I had a friend years ago did construction work with him he could turn the air and inside a new house that we'd be working on Blue if you understand my my lingo and yet he come to work one day strange how this all opened one day he goes you know I I I heard you humming That Tune are you a Christian shows you the mental state spiritual State I was in I said well I'm trying to be oh he went into a tantrum you either are or you aren't don't try you either do it or you don't do it and then he went outside after that tiate and smoked a cigarette but you see I got to be good friends with Larry one day he comes tears in his eyes and he says Paul they've just diagnosed my wife with cancer they give her less than six months he was broken I liked Larry enough there was just something crazy about his personality that attracted me and we would have been I believe up by the post office there that we brought prayer requests for Larry's wife about four and a half months later I'd always ask Larry when I see her hey or say to him Larry we're praying for you and your wife oh thank you Paul even got to where he started calling me brother 4 and a half months later he comes flying into a house he wasn't actually working on that house he was a finished Carpenter he comes flying in that house jumping up and down finally got the god healed my wife complete they run several tests over and over and over again over this span of a few days because they were sure it had to be wrong she's dying now she's perfectly healthy prise the Lord now at that stage of my life Saints I was like just second I know Believers Godly lives I don't understand Lord God honored their faith but Larry cursed like a sailor smoked and drank danced partied you talk about one confused boy like how can this be Lord and brother so and so in Tennessee passes away from answer and we've got Larry's wife healed perfectly whole I don't understand but you see God allowed that to come to a place that they are there and saying God's with us God's blessing us now I want to know I want you to answer this to yourself to yourself would you rather have truth and die of cancer or be healed of cancer and stand in the Judgment judged by the word of God hard decisions my brother and sister don't don't befuddle yourself trying to find answers to this God's given you truth and truth is greater than natural healing amen salvation is more important than how many people we can take pictures and write a paragraph and yet I stand before you believing the word is true and that we are healed in the name of Jesus Christ but it's the truth it's the word that matters you see my brother and sister impersonation will only take the church so far amen amen the word will take us all the way the word will take us right into his presence amen hopefully I'm not sounding too strident this morning I just had this bottled up and I I thank God I can unbottle it and you guys are patient to listen to me now where was thy strength uh or where has thy strength gone Samson now but the church began to try to pattern after the world and the devil might have thought that they'd had the church bound when it organized the Catholic church but when the challenge come the Philistines is upon these Samson There Rose up a Martin Luther that broke every cord and come forth preaching justification look how the prophet ties this together what it is that binds us my brother and sister I'm not afraid I I don't like the thought of it but I'm Not Afraid as it were in a natural side but to be bound spiritual that's right there's where the Trouble Comes amen so you see the devil thought that when that happened that he had bound the church now deah Delilah's motive was to find his power and there's where she could wreck him after she found his power and that's what the devil is trying to do with the church is to find that secret of power but the Catholic cords was broken when God raised up Martin Luther ain't that incredible amen look how the prophet's tying this you know what he's saying same spirit amen exactly same Spirit we look like they're not even related here it's too far in time too far in circumstance too far the prophets tying these together and saying that's exactly the same spirit that come right down here same exact devil and I'll tell you what that Devil's roaming the land amen hallelujah let's go on here amen then she bound him again the word bound him in the Lutheran church but when the scream come the Philistines is upon thee they raised up a John Wesley that sanctification the second work of Grace and it broke the cord and then they bound it again and then there come another message the philistin is upon uh me upon thee and then raised up the Pentecostal group that broke the threads of The Binding of the barriers of denomination and so forth and now we find them just about bound up 1959 that's too bad but it's the truth and now we find in the Pentecostal Church the very thing that the world used to bind the others is binding the Pentecostal church just exactly well praise God we're in the message we're not in Pentecostal churches we're in the message come on are you with me we're A step above them every one of those was A step above the one amen everyone amen amen hallelujah and the first thing you did is try to do is to try to make big shows like the other people does try to take our preachers our pastors our Shepherds and make doctors of divinity out of them now I want to tell you we don't have any Seminary that we send our preachers to except for the Seminary of peer pressure yeah and it's such an interesting online course that it can happen anywhere anytime come on y'all just smile at me please let me see your pearly whites cuz none of you ever been influenced by peer pressure we're all free of that we believe the message h we need the baptism of the Holy Ghost we don't need these things in our midst but that's where it tries to bind the church and then the next thing they tried to do is get away from the humility of the church I I'll just you know sometimes you guys probably think life is just gravy on this side of the fence but wait till you have somebody you had respect for look you in the face and say so what is it you guys are trying to do with your Family Camp and your youth Banquets what are you trying to do well after I picked myself up off the floor it was good I went from that little deal and I sat down why are we doing this H young people will you lift your hands lift your hand up come on let the world see you come on hi hire Titus be an example be a leader Titus there you go Titus is showing you how to do this why is there a youth banquet right there sister Carrie what would be your theme song from the youth banquet what would it be worked my fingers to the Bone and what do you get bony fingers but yet that Spirit comes in what is it you're trying to do well what we're trying to do is get all your 14y Olds to move from your church to ours come on silliness but Spirits are there that's right why I can stand before you and stand before the Lord today to tell you my heart is pure if it wasn't for brothers and sisters in this church and labors you know how much I gave into the youth banquet sounds like a good idea sounds like a good idea sounds like a good idea sounds like a good idea and others labored and the outside world says why why don't you just let your young people go over here to the Philistines I tell you what we'll do we'll pull a sword and we'll fight to the bloody death my brother and sister for for our young people we are not here to give them to the Philistines we're not here to say I'm going to let my children go and God's in control and whatever God wants to happen will happen I'll tell you God's in control and he gave you a backbone and he gave you a heart and a love for not only your children but for every child amen and that's where we stand today but see how those Spirits are they're always undermining undermining yeah but I tell you how it works the devil's that way reminds me of a cartoon can I share a cartoon with you amen it shows two prisons in the desert and it shows this really industrious guy he's got an overlarge spoon from the kitchen and he breaks up the floor in his cell and he digs down and he starts digging and he's like I've lost track of time I've lost track of purpose I'm and he's digging and digging finally pops up and he's made the whole few hundred yards and he's right in the middle of the other prison that's what the devil's trying to do when he undermines just go ahead come on brother Trevor let's go dig a S Tunnel but if we're not careful we just find ourselves prisoners in another place we're not here to have our children just prisoners in another place we're here to see them set free by the holy spirit amen and so it's there that we don't want to come amen and and and make our children that have to conform what we want them to do is receive the Holy Ghost to meet Jesus Christ face to face and so that's where it tries to bind the church next thing they try to do is get away from the humility of the church we're better than another church oh we're more important we have youth banquet and a Family Camp well why don't we add a camping trip on top of that and then why don't we have a couple's banquet wait we can't afford it no why are we doing it God's the provider amen not UPS we're trying to lift the body of Believers up not tear them down amen amen get better dress group or better better educated into the church trying to make our take our ministers and send them off to some Seminary to learn a lot of Education pretty obviously this one hasn't attended when you do that you just Rob the church and bind it of the power of the Holy Ghost that's exactly the truth we're here to be free my brother and sister not bind ourselves I want I I you don't have to lift your hands but I just want you to think about this how many here today could say I have bound myself yeah not even the devil not that people over there not here I bound myself now that is not the spirit of the Holy Spirit that's right amen we find Liberty in Jesus Christ we don't just dig a tunnel from one prison to another hallelujah amen I'm going to hurry you notice I didn't say I was going to quit you know what the S Satan's sitting over here on the picket fence on the rail and he studied us and he's found how to bind us that's right can I be blunt this morning what will bind brother Trevor or sister Carrie might not bind brother Ivan sister Nadia and what would bind you might not bind them amen so this Devil he's got all kinds of programs he doesn't just come with one little program you're in a cult sister Jerry and I was discussing that we we had a quite lengthy discussion on that you know I'm I bring it once again I know I've wore this statement out and I'll just continue to wear it out if we're a cult we're the worst run cult on the face of the Earth cuz the only one that's coming to your house telling you how to live is the Holy Ghost amen sir would you get critical about that you'll find that even Jesus Christ would qualif qualify as a leader of a cult oh devil scarecrow stay away stay away stay away you might get delivered you might get saved you might get the Holy Ghost stay away as though the Holy Ghost was poison but you see that's where Delilah was yeah I'm going to keep coaxing you right into my lap I wrap my loving arms around you no one loves you like I do I'm sorry that line only works for our Lord Jesus Christ right it don't work for anything else oh another definition of cult they try to separate you from those things around you remind me young people of where our young adults class was being unequally yed imagine the Holy Ghost is so bad that it wants to separate you from sin I mean that's unfair you should be able to have free access to sin but what the devil don't get they don't get so there's no desire there to be that person we don't need to build a we could all walk out of here today and go hog wild crazy my brother and sister except for you can't because the Holy Ghost is in you not the preacher nobody's going to follow you around right amen now let's look at this here I need to move on Amen so Satan he's found his way to bind us you know what some of this is so subtle hope you don't mind I don't see anybody Fanning themselves this morning looks like I'm the only one maybe that's hot ah he's found his way to bind us it's too hot in church today someone sitting on the other side says it was too cold separation brother Paul was too loud too quiet in here they had the Holy Ghost they'd make more noise the others on the other side of the aisle are like really you think noise is a sign H use too many quotes I just want to hear from the Bible not enough quotes I'm kind of thinking that that was just Brother Paul's opinion huh got no emotion in our church everybody's there you know you got a problem in church when they have two or three what do they call them defib or whatever things in the back church is dismissed the deacons are there sorry come on there's too much emotion in our church oh well where's that perfect fine line if the church was just like me okay the church was just like you well we won't go there that that that' be just a little bit cutting now John 16:13 said how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth who believes this amen for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come now I want you to take that script scripture and make it a personable uh personal applicable thing in your life amen hallelujah it won't speak of himself now don't get judgmental on somebody that says and I cuz that's who God was dealing with CU you can't go around saying and the Lord showed you unless you know the Lord showed them h won't speak of himself but what he hears is what he's going to speak that's right I want to know is did that work for you amen did that work for you God spoke to you and said you're a daughter of God you're a Son of God you are the word made manifest in flesh walking on the face of the Earth today amen come on some of us need to embrace that that we are the word in flesh I don't care how you feel let me go back here I don't really care if it's too hot or too cold too loud too quiet too many quotes not enough quotes there's no emotion there's too much emotion it's not any one of those it's the word down inside of you that speaks to you and says I know that I know that I'm a Son of God a daughter of God hallelujah he speaking to you and he shall glorify me for he shall receive of my mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine amen therefore said I that he shall uh take of mine and shall show it unto you a little while and you shall uh you shall not see me and again a little while and you shall see me because I go to the father boy that just okay I'm not going to see him but I'm going to see him Hallelujah Saints you realize what the word is just clared I don't need to see Jesus in the flesh amen because I see him in you and I see him in me and so while I didn't see him here I see him now amen while he's walking right here in our midst and the word is coming forth I don't need a tangible physical body other than where he chose to live amen amen glad to meet you Jesus Christ amen amen amen hallelujah that ought to be our position amen that ought to be amen so he went to the father come back and he's living in you amen and the devil would like to say well you guys follow a man I do praise God I follow a man the man Christ Jesus Hallelujah that's who I follow amen the man Christ Jesus right amenallah so too hot too cold what do we do amen now in the uncertain sound brother Bram says here are we all right I know it's getting a little warm in here and the clock is just wasting away but in the uncertain sound brother Brown says any manner woman that's born of the spirit of God knows where they stand can we say Amen to that amen can I throw a curveball at you if you're not totally lying up in the word you know it you know this would be awkward but I can tell you the last time I was at your house and spied on you and I got my little notebook hey I even got a coffee cup at home that says something about be careful what you say you might end up in a sermon that's right do I need to go spy on your house no because he's there that's that's right exactly he's there he is going to let you know amen where you stand amen don't even have to tell the preacher that's right amen all the preacher does is just preach that's it and you're there gleaning it out of the word saying that is a problem in my life I should do this and I shouldn't do that M but you know the devil s Fox can we sing that together sir amen he's a Sly old Fox the preacher was pointing at me oh here just a second let's get this so it's no repercussion for me it's all pointed at you the preacher was preaching at me was he really seriously I say this a little bit joking but truthful if you saw what was going through the preacher's mind you'd say that looks more like static preacher was preaching at me I'm sorry it was Jesus Christ preaching at you because you see you're my friends and I love every one of you love your families and I I just you know there's hardly a day I get in the car leave from church but when I'm like oh my what did I do what did I say and somebody send you a text this is what I was going through I needed to hear that that's right oh you mean you have foolishness of preaching that's right not the word that's foolish but God's delivery sometimes a appears foolish you know why I like to analyze everything because the foolishness of preaching allows those who don't want to receive it to find their reason to not receive it amen there's the foolish part not the man that brought it not the motive behind it not the word he spoke but the foolish compartment gives every individual their excuse that's it that they can take it and set it aside I'm not being too mean today am I amen regardless of what takes place or how many says yes or no they know where they stand there's no uncertain sound hallelujah oh by the man who possesses it the woman who possesses it and I want to just add right in here my brother and sister we're not here pointing some figure of who does and who doesn't you just press to the mark of the high calling and you'll be one of those that has it amen don't stop for anything amen the man who possesses it the woman who possesses it oh what a blessed person they are no wonder David said they were blessed the blessed person lay him up in the operating table and take and try and cut the blessing out of him come on Saints amen you can't cut the blessing out of a son or daughter of God filled with the Holy Ghost amen it's the very fiber of their being it's who they are it's their heart it's there every part of them amen is blessed you'll never find it it's a hidden power it's a hidden something but it's there and every man that ever had it knew they got it every man and woman that ever had it knew they got it let's come to the place my brother and sister on the worst day of your life that you could lift Your Hands to Heaven and say I know by the grace of God I am a blessed person I know that he's poured his favor out on me it's a devil that's telling you you're not God corrects by the word he doesn't correct by Superstition or tradition or opinion or emotion he corrects by the word hallelujah amen every man would ever had it knew they got it no uncertainty every man that's born of the spirit of God knows when he passed from death into life Hallelujah now the prophet's not saying that you knew on such and such date in 1988 at this time I can't really tell you my brother and sister exactly where it was now my testimony is not one to boast about but I tell you what I ran away I ran far I ran fast amen but what I didn't realize is just like the dog in the yard I had a chain on me and I got to the end of that chain and I remember the moment I got to the end of the chain I got to that place I remember that more so than the day that I actually remember oh I Had My Moments Church in Star Idaho brother Harold hilderbrandt preaching away inspired preaching and he's talking about how they would be someone that would come to a stage of their life and they would recognize they can't live without Christ and he's pointing his hand out there and I promise you there was a sight on the end of that and it was pointed right at me and I was there going that's the truth amen that's the truth why can't live without him amen sister Jerry knows those days she went to church just as often in them days without a husband as she did with a husband he had to work Sundays he actually was like I have to work this Sunday but God was doing something amen greater amen that's right well he certainly got a sense of humor because I'm here preaching to you amen every man knows he's pass from death into life knows the place the hour of the minute brother brandham knocks on the pulpit six times and when death changed to life when unbelief of the Bible changed to believe every word of it when hotty and high-m minded things passed to Humble Christian and they know when death passed to life amen I say Amen to that we know I know when death passed to life I don't need to be able to say it happened in this exact second right here but I know that I made that trip from Death right into life amen amen hallelujah now look I got to close this up Samson at the grinding wheel not one drop of natural sight not one thing nobody said hey look at the track I found the park nothing he's at the grinding wheel going around and around and around and around just like we were amen but see something was happening down inside that come on Saints don't be ashamed if you're going around and around amen just start asking God to give you a sight that's far beyond natural amen let him speak to your heart amen but you see there was a vow taking place whether Samson had sight or not there was a vow that Nazarite vow that he had with God he broke the vow but God never broke it God never said you broke the vow I'm breaking you God said no I'm going to let you go Samson and one day the very vow that I made to you will come to pass and that's what made him a judge in Israel amen it wasn't about his Stellar life cuz there was nothing Stellar about life but it was a fact that God chose him to be a judge and I want to tell you today God chose you you might not feel like it you might not think you look like it you might not at the very moment be acting like it but neither did Samson but God said I've chose you to judge Le oia I chose you to be the final voice to the final age I chose you you didn't choose you I chose you and then he's there and I tell you I have to just share this with a little humor cuz that's the way it struck me when I was studying this and I read this I was sitting in a tractor going around in circles and I know exactly how fast I was going 4.4 all day long and you guys think that farming's easy and the prophet says that one little hair no amening and God said The Vow is restored amen sister Betty retif through the denomination everything brother bram's coming South Africa imagine this if you guys knew sister Betty such a lovely sweet sister and here sister Betty brother Willie's getting it everything organized and they're going brother bram's going to be there they're actually going to go this service they're going to have lunch with him and these different things and sister Betty goes downtown gets her hair trimmed up curled what do they call that permanent yeah got her everything just right she wanted to be perfect they sit in the service the prophet of God is preaching and he hits on hair sister Betty this personal she spoke this right to Jerry and I this it's not a recounted version she said I sat right there and my heart sunk the very thing I wanted to do to just look so nice for brother brandham was against the word and she says heartbroken the finish of the whole service she's just sitting there oh God forgive me I thought I was doing a good thing I just wanted to look nice in the presence of prophet going down the road brother brandham speaks to her sister that that's troubling your heart yeah the minute you said Lord forgive me that's it come on Saints what are you carrying today that you've already said Lord forgive me and you're still dragging it along with you it's time for us to believe in the power of the blood of Jesus Christ amen amen he said the minute you said Lord forgive me it no longer existed God saw you sister Betty with long hair and I want to ask you today my brother and sister if Samson in the moment of pushing the grinding wheel was there blind without Revelation but something was happening on the inside Can someone say thank you Lord for something on the inside amen and the prophet says that one little hair started to grow that's right and then they call him to make him sport y see God's always on time yes sir God is always on time they called him to be sport God didn't give him I don't know what is that that they use muscle building whatever steroids God didn't say stop here in this little alley here I've got a man that's going to inject you with steroids Samson you're going to do an incredible thing St Samson's they're blind stumbling along can I tell you about an experiment we did as children me and my brothers we lived in a two-story Farmhouse at that time and uh I have mean Brothers anyway we were doing this thing what it was like to be blind so we're tying you know handkerchief around our eyes and my brothers nudge me here and there until I fell down the stairs amen I decided Lord don't ever let me be blind I don't think I could survive being blind here Samson In the Flesh stumbling along but something's happening that's it God's in control that's it they lead him close to the pillars and Samson by Revelation not by Vengeance or Revenge but by anointing amen of the heart amen they lead him over there to the pillars and he asks that young man can you can you help me find the pillars and he judged the Philistines harder it's the end of what looked like a tragic life than he did in all of his previous life come on Saints don't let the devil lie to you your life will be here to judge leod deia stronger now than ever before I I became a Believer at this time I've been up I've been down I've been Sideways come on have faith in God he's called you now to live the word like you never lived it before that it would be a judgment to a dark and dying Le to see a world that cares nothing about God Amen called you for that amen hallelujah amen amen and as verse 22 says amen his hair of his head begin to grow again that's what it was my brother and sister I don't care how many times you promised God that's it I'm trying to break throwing people under the bus so I'll throw myself amen one time I was hunting very much a turmoil time of my life I was hunting i' drawn a Antelope tag in a very special unit and I only shot a mediocre Antelope but I had my opportunity to shoot a monster and I blew it and when this Antelope was there I was so desperate to kill an antelope do you Hunters know what that feels like I crawled through desert cactus till my arms were clear full of quills and I shot 500 yards smidge over 500 yards I hit four feet below and four feet in front of this Antelope and I laid there on the ground and literally had a tear popping my eyes like I've done all this for nothing and I said Lord if you just let me get an anvelope i I'll serve you that's a great by line the devil's got there how many people have said Lord if it just this I'll serve you God gives it yeah nothing happens that's it so I'll tell you how gracious the Lord is I I don't own that good of a rifle that good a scope I thought man that looked like it was four feet in front of him and that looked like that was four feet below him so I just raised the crosshairs up and I thought okay from his shoulder four feets right here and and 4T low I don't know what 4 feet is but he's probably boom I got me an envelope you know how much impact that had on my life I lost the unction before I even got home yeah but there come a day that's it oh thank you Lord amen come a day that I was so desperate in life I said Lord if you just save me I'll serve you Lord and he came amen and it's been up and down but it's stuck I'm still trying I'm still pressing don't give up hope don't act like you went too far to the right or left don't act like it's no no hope no hope I got no hope I failed so many times I'm telling you Samson failed so many times my brother and sister and God still brought him right back and placed him in Hebrews 11 to give you an example of what it is to see the power of God not how strong you are but the power of God that's what we need to pursue is the power of God not power and strength in this body but yet God anointed him to have strength in the Physical Realm amen and push those pillars over and killed more in that moment than he did in all of his Warfare hallelujah amen oh Hallelujah I got to close here amen I just want to say this really I don't know why why I put this in the sermon but we don't own it oh an explanation to the world how many times we've tried to explain the message so they could just see it unless they're ordained to they won't see it you don't owe an explanation to them you do owe to live the life in front of them that backs up your testimony amen amen we don't need to compromise for the world to accept it wait till you have somebody look you in the face and say now if you guys would could just kind of put that profit thing to the side I could I could actually see acts 238 I could accept that well I'm sorry the only reason I see acts 238 is because of that Prophet guy amen otherwise I'd just be another Methodist just like all of them just like her family had been for a long time we'd just be Methodist come onely amen no need to compromise to get them amen what we need to do is let our spiritual hair grow that's it come on let's quit trimming our spiritual hair because of our unbelief in ooh hang on our self that's it you say why why do you say our unbelief why you say our self and not unbelief in God cuz God's standing right there next to us he is true yesterday true today he'll be true tomorrow so you see it's actually our unbelief that we are Sons and Daughters of God because otherwise amen sister Sue put your left arm out please yes Ser I'm serious yeah I am serious I want to hold sister Susan she's been a dear friend he's closer he's closer than this right here that's exactly right closer come on Saints amen are you with me just waiting because the scripture said he's closer than a brother amen amen how close would you hold your brother now some of you growing up brother David brother Tim I don't know do you guys Embrace very often that's kind of what I was going to say but I didn't want to go there amen you know so that's why I use the Arms Reach yeah that's why I use the arm reach cuz some brothers are just like you're my brother but I'm not hugging you come on he's closer than a brother so he's got to be closer than this right here right and I'll never leave you or forsake you he's always there everywhere we go that's Hallelujah you love the Lord today amen I pray that this something made sense I I'll tell you I tell you what my brother and sister we need to let our spiritual hair grow pray for the Life of Christ to be manifested not to just acknowledge there is a life in Christ but let that life be manifested in me amen and the Holy Ghost is the hidden power the devil can't find he will never find that hidden power that holds you and keeps you and sends you to your Eternal destination amen he can't find it the devil will never have it he wants but well praise the Lord one last thought musicians if you please come we take the parable out of scripture the story out of scripture we recognize there was a near Kinsman that's it that's right our nature placed us as the near Kinsman you'll never see the devil on the cross and if you want to put the devil right back in his place when he talks about how he has Revelation and he has knowledge and he has these things just ask the devil if he's willing to die for you come on devil you want me to go out here and do whatever and act like whatever and and whatnot die for me if I'm that valuable die for me but you see the near Kinsman say I can't do that cuz it might Mar my testimony imagine how the Earth would Rejoice if the devil said I can do anything Jesus Christ did he knows he can't that's it I'm going to go climb on that cross I'm going to put in the cave I'm going to do it for you he can't but we don't need to crucify Jesus Christ Christ again and again he died once for us that is sufficient Hallelujah love the Lord today hopefully your pot roast isn't pot smoked now Hallelujah we'll skip over these things right here this hidden power is not here for us to boast Saints it's here for us to live thank you Lord let's stand Psalms 19465 brother Gideon amen Hallelujah forgive me for my blunders and stumbles and and uh it's a song brother Gideon 465 amen sorry about that Psalms 19 does sound
