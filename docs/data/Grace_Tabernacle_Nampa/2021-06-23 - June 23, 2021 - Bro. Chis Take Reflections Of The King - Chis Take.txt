the lord why don't we stand tonight thank you musicians yes it's good to see by the trevor back man brother david looking forward to seeing sunday amen i'm gonna put that up hope this make sure this works real quick okay there we go let's go to the scripture second corinthians chapter three it's on the screen only if you don't have a bible otherwise exercise your sword second corinthians chapter 3 verse 12. praise of war seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech aren't you glad god speaks so plainly we don't have to use big words to be all fancy to confuse everybody i read a lot of blogs at work to figure out problems solutions to problems and whenever i start reading one and that guy is just going all nerd on me i move right on because you can't understand it because people try to use big words to sound smart but if you have to use big words to sound smart you don't understand what you're explaining but true revelation of christ comes in plainness of speech people will try to speak to you about god and they'll get all confusing with big words not every single time but amen i'm glad all i'm trying to say is i'm glad that the lord uses plainness of speech verse 13 and now as moses which put a veil over his face that the children of israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same veil on taken away in the reading of the old testament which veil is done away in christ but even unto this day when moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the veil shall be taken away amen now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with open face beholding as in the glass the glory of the lord with open face unveiled are changed into the same image so we're unveiled beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord and we're being changed into that image from glory to glory even by as by a man's idea even as by the spirit of the lord let's bow our heads heavenly father lord jesus we come to you tonight seeking lord to hear from you lord jesus father we've come here lord we've done our our part brought together our licks of fire lord jesus eager to hear what you want to say tonight lord we pray that as always looking forward to you keeping your word lord jesus you're not a i hope so god father you're a do so lord you do what your word says lord you keep your promises you're not a man that you could lie i pray that you just take these words lord jesus father this your servant lord may you i just want to step out of the way lord i want to hear from you tonight or just as much as my brothers and sisters here father i pray you'd speak for jesus to us father lip to ear lord live to heart father may we have an ear to hear tonight what the spirit is saying unto us lord jesus revelation is what's going to get us out of here and into your arms sooner and that's the whole point lord we love you father we thank you now in jesus name we pray amen you may be seated tonight so my title tonight is reflections of the king i didn't put my subtitle on there unfortunately but it's christ unveiled amen but the mountain says in the quote um well see this is what happens when i do slides i forget one in there he says in the quote uh the unveiling of god which i don't think i have a quote that's not from that sermon so we'll just blanket statement it's gonna be from the unveiling of god but he says the unveiled god plain view they should have seen him standing there yet he was too common he was an ordinary man they couldn't see it see there stood a man well they said this guy what school did he come from see where were their thoughts already you ever meet somebody with and someone's already told you about them maybe good may be bad when you meet that person you go oh i see it whether it's good or bad because you're basing your introduction on a preconceived idea so already they're used to holy men coming from a great school from a pharisee or a sadducee which um incidentally they brought over from babylon it's in the message you can find that and so they have these great religious uh systems and so they meet this man that's supposed to be a holy man and the first thing they ask is what school did he come from they don't give him a chance he says but remember when that spear struck his body that spirit left him the temple the sacrifices blocks turned over and the lightning whipped down through the temple and rent the veil that's what the lord does he tears up our ideas amen our traditions our organization amen when god comes in his sovereignty his grace he turns that upside down he goes on to say he says what was it there was their god hanging on calvary and they were too blind to see it brought him an open few and still they don't see it they are blinded god failed in a human being amen so christ was in plain view when the veil was rent after he died on the cross that but yet the jews didn't realize it we have scripture that says they were blinded for our sake but they were still given the opportunity and god christ is the same yesterday today and forever and so there are scriptures for the people who are blinded today yet we preach the gospel and yet we desire for their eyes to be open because even in the midst jews eyes were open amen but god was veiled and when god does something a certain way for a certain thing he doesn't ever change that amen that is why the scripture says he is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever you can even in the secular world look at history because history repeats itself and you can say okay what's going to happen in this scenario and when they collect data to say all right if we give an ad and what happens when we give an advertisement and what and all this stuff because it just repeats itself and um amen praise the lord so he was missed behind the veil the veil of christ when that veil writ he was telling them it's not there anymore it's behind skin human skin amen the renting of the badger skin introduced where christ was moving to amen brother brennan picks up this word in morphe which means always was just now revealed changing his mask he says so um god changed his his mass god didn't change who he was because he's elohim he that always existed you can't change god remember god can change you amen god was in morphe so he stepped from behind the veil of badger skin and he was in the veil of jesus the skin the human skin and then then he was poured out on the day of pentecost and we have a scripture here amen joel chapter 2 verse 28 to 32 and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit and i will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the lord come and also come to pass that whosoever shall call in the name of the lord shall be delivered for in mount zion and in jerusalem shall be deliverance as the lord hath said and in the remnant who the lord shall call and then brother branham says now when it said here that he emptied himself or poured out now we would think like this he's speaking of joel that he vomit up the english word of empty or poured out from him see something went out of him that was different from him but the word you know he says kenosis but the table says kinos so it's kenosis but i left it i didn't correct it because in case you wanted to go find the quote it is misspelled but in the greek does not mean that he vomit up or some his arm went off or his eye would out another person that is he changed himself he poured himself into amen into another mask so he was in more faith and he in and kenosis he was pouring himself into amen into well we're going to get there he changed himself he poured himself into amen into another mask into another form not another person went out of him called the holy spirit but it was he himself you get it he himself poured himself into the people christ in you how beautiful how wonderful to think god pouring himself into the human being into the believer pour out it was a part of his drama to do so god all the fullness all the godhead bodily was in this person jesus christ amen so all that god was was poured into jesus and all that jesus was was poured into you and i the holy spirit it wasn't another person as brother bannon says here in the quote it was kenosis it was god pouring himself and changing his mask because he could jesus christ and flesh couldn't pour himself into you so he had to in morphe into the holy spirit and then pour himself into you but it was still always christ i mean that's where the the the denominations and people that believe in the trinity they get so confused because it was hid their eyes are blinded it's hid behind the veil of the word of god which brother phantom says also i highly recommend going and listening to this sermon i haven't finished it yet but praise the lord this time around i should say it was a part of his drama to do so god all the fullness all the godhead bodily okay he was god and god alone not a third person or a second person or a first person but the person god veiled in human flesh and then kenosis poured out so now we have amen god behind a skin veil now the badger skin veiled god in the wilderness and so underneath the ministry of moses amen the the christ was veiled behind the badger but underneath the new dispensation of grace the ministry of christ amen god was be was poor was in the holy spirit was poured into the church the bride and now amen he was with human skin on it amen from old to new amen when god came into your life and god poured himself into you amen you put the badger skin behind you put you put that carnal skin behind you and you stepped into as a new creation in christ jesus but you're still behind skin amen the flesh that we have to fight and keep underneath control but we have been given an example a man of exactly how to do that so christ went back into human skin again on the day of pentecost amen hebrews 13 8 jesus christ is the same yesterday that's kind of small can you see that today and forever okay so this is what i love about the word of god amen it's always the same it doesn't ever change so when you read a promise to israel it's a promise to you when you read a promise to the the the um in the word of god that was written thousands of years ago guess what it's still a promise for you today and if god did it for them he's bound to do it to you because god follows the only his own laws he has to he's bound to them because it is him yeah i can't be anything besides chris because that's who i am if i try to express somebody else it just gets weird but if i it but so christ because he made the law he spoke it his thoughts expressed he has to manifest that because he is bound to his word because his word is him amen so um we're building uh up tonight here so we'll step over here the veil of tradition brother branham says to and today the veil of tradition hides the word again saying it's not so so we have we have a paradox or or a um a scenario if you will amen you have a veil you want to be hid behind the veil in christ but that same veil hides you from the world so when he says the veil of tradition hides the word he's not saying that the word is in tradition he's saying that the word people in tradition are veiled to the true word he did not say worldly people he did not say heathens here he did not say denominational people here he said tradition traditions of religion can hide god from the people how do we know that because it happened in the bible it happened in god's word and now we have amen the messenger bringing it to us in this way so we look back into the scriptures and we see how the jews christ was there out in the open what do they say today oh if i could see him i would believe yet christ was in flesh in their midst and they didn't see him they called him beelzebub they say they say well if you just show me i can you know i can science i can see it i got to see it to believe it but if they could they wouldn't and then i preached a sermon one time i don't remember what it what the title or anything was but i was talking about the woman that washes the feet of jesus and we say oh my goodness if if i was if i was um what's the guy's name the pharisee nobody else remembers if i was simon i think it was simon invited jesus over you say well if i was him i would have made sure jesus had clean feet but yet those same people that say that don't right jesus like brother random priest of sermon is in the corner with dirty feet because you say when you see it in the past you say oh i would never do that but it's repeated today um so a veil was cast over their eyes amen it wasn't and brother brown doesn't say denomination tradition like i said he just says tradition um so message church tradition we spent too much time talking about how it's the denominations and it slipped in we preached at the nominations out of the mark of the beast and it slipped in the signs of the times um amen message church traditions church traditions for us oh well we sing for 30 minutes the preacher preaches for an hour or two special songs on sunday ever notice that rarely a song special is sung on wednesday unspoken prayer requests that's a good one some you know same person every sunday has that our unspoken request everybody wonders when god when they're going to accept anyways and they say we say oh the one no i'm talking about nothing about you think about people like you that are stuck in tradition i say oh order now order now careful not to express yourself too much you might encourage the preacher to keep preaching you know how you've been there in the services where you're tired and somebody's just shouting and amen and you're like if they would be quiet we could wrap this up sunday we go in our best suit oh we just we got it all crisp three piece wednesday we stream i get any laughs on that one after church we'll eat that this specific restaurant you're sitting in church wondering what you should order you'll never find god in tradition tradition is death christ is life they can't go together why why is it that tradition is such a big topic why is it labored over and over and over again in the message in the bible because tradition gives you a false sense of hope tradition gives you a false sense of revelation i know people who are message believers it's all in their head they're following a tradition not so much church this and church now like i said but a tradition of the words of the message the phrases of the message they got the quote to line up they can talk like it but they're speaking through tradition those pharisees they could put a pin in the scroll and tell you where everywhere it hit yet they missed christ it's not about knowing the message word for word better it's about knowing christ better and you find him in the word that's why we don't read the message like a church age excuse me a newspaper the bible like a newspaper because a newspaper you can memorize it you can memorize a or or a stanza of a famous poem and then you can quote it and sound all romantic but um the bible is not that way it's a living word and it doesn't come into you through memorization it comes into you through the anointing and the spirit of christ that's why you have to we have to come to church and we have to hear a preacher because that's god's provided way of worship you see i was thinking as i was listening to the sermon the unveiling of god and i was thinking about how god's provided way of worship is behind the veil amen god's provided way worship is in his bride which is behind the veil which is covering the word that's why it's a secret you can't make it a show because if you make it a show you pull it outside of the veil and when it's outside of the veil it's no longer of god so watch when somebody gets too much into the appearance watch when a church or a preacher or or an idea of the message becomes about the show there's something missing because they're going for what they think it should look like i was praying in the back tonight lord because sometimes as a preacher i come out with a with a preconceived idea of of the delivery of the sermon i said lord i don't want to come out here with how i think it should be said how i i have the words that he's given me and i believe those words will come but i don't want to try to preach it evangelistical when you wanted us in teaching i don't want to try to come out here and and then you know send you all to the altar when the lord's not wanting to work that way it's like lord help me to come out and work the way you see fit you see we have to be sensitive to the moving of the holy spirit in everything that we do lord is is what i'm doing every reflection of you that's our title it's not reflections of the king amen so behind the veil same sermon brother battle says in type moses coming from the presence of god with the word of god for that age now watch we're now in exodus 19 don't miss this now moses is coming from the presence of god moses is coming for the prince of god he has been into the word the word has been wrote in the presence of god with the word he had the word for that age there is a word for each age and moses coming forth his face shined so see the word was in him ready to be manifested give out to the people the true word god had wrote it it was with moses notice it was with moses and was ready to be manifested he was the word to them he was the living word hid veiled himself moses had to put a veil over his own face because it was shining so brightly but it was a type that the word is behind the veil why he was that word amen until that word was made known made known moses had to veil himself do you see it wherever the word is it's failed so now we say wherever the word is it's veil that we have to pray because the only way to step through the veil and we'll get to that quote is by revelation revelation it takes revelation to see you can't convince somebody to see they might act like it man but they're just putting on a show they've never been behind the veil but if they catch a revelation you can't tell them otherwise amen so the bride behind the veil it's a little nugget to think about the reflection now if you see a reflection you know what to look for to see the real you can see a picture of somebody and then you can find them based on that picture that picture is a reflection of of them now brother baum says in the message well the same message he says notice death to stay away from it now he's talking about he's talking about how in the in the tabernacle in the wilderness it was death to go into it but he says now amen christ in morphe and the holy spirit in the church now it's death to stay away from it you must go he says you must go into it through this veil or you won't how god could have mercy on them but remember what it was that god is manifesting what was behind that veil watch what was behind the veil the word what did it fail the word what was it it's in the ark it was the word that that veil hid see and jesus was that word and he is that word and the veil of his flesh hid it amen so you have to go through the veil if if if to get to the word of god in the tabernacle in the wilderness you had to go through the veil it's going to be the same thing today you have to pass through the veil to get to the word of god and to get to the word of god is to become a reflection of the king amen amen this comes this comes from something that was said a couple services ago and i wrote it down it was a little bit differently than i wrote it down but i can find it here the bride's dress is a reflection of the king the bride's dress isn't a reflection of her it's a reflection of the king so that when christ looks at the bride he sees himself amen that's why it's gold tried by fire we're not trying to look like a beautiful some beautiful women just some somewhere we're trying to look like christ we want to be a reflection of the king you are reflections of the king so now it's christ is the same yesterday today and forever so he we see he was in the tabernacle in the wilderness and then the jews said now where is he and the gentiles and peter and james and all them guys are walking around christ veiled and they're asking where's god they've been asking where's god i want to see god down through the ages so now today amen where is he where is god they look out into the outer space to find and back into the universe trying to find life but there's something driving them to find something more than their reality here because there's a deep in their heart if they're chosen of god amen there's a seed down in there but in mankind is a desire for something bigger than himself need a superman or a super strong guy or a beautiful woman or a handsome guy or a fancy car but they get that and it never satisfies and what is actually coming forth from within them is where is god amen in the ranks of the the message people are asking where is god people say well god is here he's he's over here we have to do it this way and and we'll know it's over here and he's going to birth adam's coming back and then you'll find what you're looking for amen but that's not where god is amen god is veiled in the bride the bride's dress is a reflection of her king they're looking and they're trying to find the answers and yet we're sitting here why are we expressing why are we a reflection of the king because he called out for us and we responded not of our own desire but of the desire of jesus christ to have himself a lovely little lady one that's clothed in in a fancy dress one that's clothed in tradition one that's clothed in in in in well other things i was gonna i'll just okay what some that are clothed in tape only some that are clothed in this preacher or this church no no no god is coming for the bride that's dressed in the clothes he has provided god's provided way of worship you can't worship god on the other side of the veil you want to worship god you see these people in in in you know pentecostals they sing those songs that we enjoy and you see them worshiping but they are not in connection with god right they're not in true worship true they're receiving you know effects on their flesh but true worship comes sometimes in the stillness of the morning amen in the middle of a busy day at work i remember one time when i was a carpenter in the union i was working on this job and there was a bunch of people and the iron workers i was working right next to them carpenters are really bad and then there's sailors and then there's iron workers and they had their music blasting you know heavy metal all that is a favorite of them kind of people and right there on the roof in the middle of everybody cursing their music i thought you know what it doesn't matter where i am it's inside me and right there god's presence came down it doesn't matter where you are or what you're doing if you can step behind the veil if you live your life behind the veil which incidentally is the will of god says you get out from behind the will of god you're out from behind his protection but when you're behind the will of god and then god will protect you that's the veil see how all of this just ties together like you can't make this stuff up and then it just perfectly dovetails together by the way you know a dovetail we always say dovetails it's almost impossible to break a dovetail joint the word dovetails together and where it comes together it's impossible to break amen but god's word fits so perfectly so it's the worship comes from your heart not the building we respect this building because it's what god has ordained to be that way but the worship comes from behind the veil comes from the bride because you are expressing what's inside of you and the only thing that christ accepts is the reflection of himself you can try to worship the way they the world through the world through their dancing they're worshiping they're worshiping all kinds of gods all kinds of devils it might some but when you worship from christ within you to the christ within you that's where you find god's true worship so the bride is dressed in a reflection of the king just like this this mountain lake which i did i just picked this picture but apparently that lake looks like a rainbow so there's that amen so it's not a king or some god it's the king you what i want to say tonight where god's grace is you are a reflection of the king it's time for the bride to realize who you are i don't need to stand up here and tell you who you aren't because whatever you focus on is what you become so you you know you look past your failures you you look past your weaknesses and you say i'm a reflection of the king and guess what you look behind you and you say oh i'm lining up with that now because when you look straight ahead that's where you go when you look behind you you crash try it sometime no don't i'm going down the freeway at 80. it is the king jesus christ and you are a reflection of him it's not what does the scripture say what what does paul say it's not robbery he thought it not robbery same thing for you it's not robbery for you to think of yourself as a reflection of the king because that's what you were called to be amen and as time progresses we're going to hear it more and more you're going to read the bible you're going to go wow the lord's really trying to tell me who i am yet 20 years ago you were reading about how there's a prophet now when you read all you sees how you're the bride and christ is in you and you are christ and it's all the same and he's coming back for you and you're lining up with the word you're looking like the word a little bit more every single day from glory to glory the scripture says here with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord a glass a reflection amen are changed into the same image from glory to glory from eternity to eternity amen you coming you're going back to where you came from by the spirit of the lord and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty if you're not finding liberty in your life you're doing something wrong you're not that's not christ if you're not excuse me if you're not finding liberty and what you think is christ maybe that's not christ right people are stuck in in in in bondage in in in places that are labeled message churches but and this will never denominate but god is calling you out of the message church it's about the bride of christ i i call you brothers and sisters stand up and become the bride of christ you have it it's inside of you it's ready it's waiting you're and guess what it just it does it it's amen every day you yield more to christ amen a reflection of him it's like if you had a mirror and it was it was it was it was really dirty you can't you just see this blurry outline it will just see blurry then you you wipe it down you and you there's smears and so you just see a blurry island of a person now you never maybe never seen yourself before and you're wondering what's on the other side and you and then and then god comes along and he wipes another layer off of it and then he wipes another layer off of it and next thing you know which would be in the twinkling of an eye you see christ and that's when that's when we're going to get out of here because when you see christ in the reflection of the word you're gonna you're gonna know that's who i am and nothing can hold you here because if you know where you're from you can go back there if you know who you are you can return back to that amen he's looking to see himself in you he wants you okay so he's christ is looking to see himself in you and he wants you to find yourself in him what does that mean if that if that happens what does that mean it's christ both times that was beautiful the well on sunday with the hands he wants you to find yourself in him why is it so hard for us to believe to really really really believe that this that he really wants to see himself in us we say we believe it and we believe it but when we find ourselves in a struggle or a weakness or we're down we just accept that as our identity it's the flesh right okay we understand that but i'm not talking about who you aren't so you accept that as your identity you know people have why why is it in our day there's such a big identity issue natural types of spirituals there's an identity issue in the bride of christ otherwise we wouldn't be here there is an identity issue but god is trying to tell you look you're a reflection of the king of me and he's saying don't accept the identity the devil wants to hand you wrapped up in a fancy thing or a melancholy moment but accept the identity that christ has for you in his word people are confused if they're a guy or a girl if they're a human or a dog or a lion or a tiger they're trying but when they when they think that's their identity that's who they become that's who they look like when you accept your identity i'm the bride of christ that's who you're going to become praise the lord till nobody can tell the reflection apart amen then that's the twinkling of an eye and the ride will be gone you'll be gone i'll be gone say oh how how do you know faith i'm gonna accept it look uh look they say in the world fake it till you make it and that's not we live our life by faith but you understand what i'm trying to say i hope so you ask so ask yourself when you make a choice which one would be a reflection of my king is this conversation i'm having a reflection of a king is these thoughts that i'm having a reflection of the king is me putting myself down a reflection of the king is me accepting defeat and saying well what will be will be is that a reflection of the king or does he called you to be a warrior conduct yourself as a reflection of the king receive joy and victory in your heart as a reflection of the king it is not wrong to be happy every day of your life that's a reflection of the king not just happy but joy a bubbling joy that you just can't it's contagious you can't get rid of it that's what god's called you to be it's a joyous to spread the good news you think you're gonna you think somebody wants your religion if you're got a big frown on your face all the time you know it's like it's like you know in the catholic church i don't know what are they seeing now when the guys up there all somber rattling off in latin that no one can understand yeah i want that big time no i want something with life in it yes the world is looking in all the wrong places some message people are looking for christ in all the wrong places in some man in some ministry they're moving in churches and moving churches and moving churches and oh you know you you hear them all this brother is such a good preacher and then and then and then they move on and it's this other guy over here and yet their life is still struggling and their life is still not lining up with the word because they're looking for christ in all the wrong places but christ is veiled within his bride amen you aren't just i ain't man to myself sorry brother paul you aren't just some nobody you are destined for greatness you're not just he's just somebody you know you're a reflection of the king you're you are not destined for failure um you are destined for greatness you are greatness because you are a reflection of the king now start acting like it start acting like it man it's funny how much i i i think i say it a lot and my the work i do just it's crazy how much it lines up with the word i know that sounds funny and i couldn't explain myself because you'd have to do it to understand but um one of the big things is is people that that do what i do have have there's a name for it it's basically a complex thinking they're not smart enough to do it yet they do it every single day so you have to act like it and until you convince yourself you've convinced everyone else around you but you have to convince yourself i don't know that one was free so don't carry around that worry anymore it's not yours that worry is not your identity don't carry around those chains anymore amen those chains are not your identity amen christ musicians want to come tonight christ has called out to you go out to meet him you want to become like christ you have to know about christ how are you going to know about christ only if you spend time with him in secret we're not trying to make a show we're not trying to to to just well make a show but we have a desire in our heart i was thinking that tonight i i in the back just sometimes it's hard to separate from the day especially if if you're going to preach and stepping and you're thinking about working and stressing about stuff and and you want to push that aside and i sometimes we feel like we have to we feel like we have to put on an act of what a christian supposed to be or what a preacher is supposed to be or what a song leader is supposed to be but i find that you connect with god when you're real about who you are and where you are because god's not in um god's not gonna god's not gonna accept an act and when you come to church and you come and you got two different shoes because that's just how it went um and you just six and that's a poor example i'm sorry it's all i can i i'm pulling on right now but you just say god i came to hear from you you don't you don't come you know you some some and i keep using preachers as an example that's a good thing since i'm up here but they're the one that you see is sometimes they come out and they just they they're they're talking loudly because they're trying to get themselves to to push themselves into an anointing or into an atmosphere that they think it it should be and say we just come out or you just come to church and you just say god what is it you want to say what is it you want me to hear what is it you want me to accept where do you want me to change amen that's where you connect with god i don't know i hope i hope you're it's it's coming out uh it's it's all up to god anyways it's not a it's uh not up to me just well to come to come as a real to be real is to come with an open heart to be honest that's what it is come with an open come with a a spirit and and you don't have to have had a bad day to come to church like that but sometimes those bad days beat us down until we're just what's next and we're kind of in this right but and then you can still be excited when you come to church and be open don't try to assume what god's going to do what god's going to speak just have faith that he's going to speak just that faith that he's going to talk to you that he's going to speak to you when you do your devotions i don't know last night i was praying and i and i just i was thinking about it and even even even sometimes we have a desire we're serving god we get stuck in in repetition prayers and i was praying and i was just thinking about i was like lord you now understand i know this i serve lord with all my heart but so it just hits you you're real i'm not just talking to the air you're actually listening and as as time goes on we're gonna we're gonna get closer and closer to that connection as you grow in christ as well you get closer to that connection saints when you pray you're not just praying to the air christ is actually listening to you he's there he's not far away on some you know uh unnamed planet in the universe he's he's right here he's right inside he's right next to you and when you he hears everything you're saying like i'm having like i'm right now i'm talking to you you're hearing me as christ is hearing you [Music] i don't know amen that that's the reality that we live in the world a world around us is pretty crazy and there's a lot of noise there's a lot of noise [Music] but if we can push that aside and just realize that the lord is is right there and he's listening and help us to listen back [Music] help us to open our ears and on our hearts to hear from him heavenly father lord jesus [Music] lord we just so thankful father to be called your bride lord to be a reflection of you that's not a a bold or a [Music] wrong statement to make it's what you're trying to tell us because you know if we can accept that in faith that's who we'll become abraham accepted it in faith and he was given a body change and received the promised son father now we accept that in faith we look past our shortcomings we look past what we do when we when we yell at our of the kids or the wife or we speak rough or we or we don't do our business correctly and we and then we're rude with our client lord father we look past all of that and we say lord help us to keep our eyes on the fact that we are a reflection of you
