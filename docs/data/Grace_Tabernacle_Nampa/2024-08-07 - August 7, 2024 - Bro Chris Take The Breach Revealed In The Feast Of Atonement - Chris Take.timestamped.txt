[31:44] so I'm going to give brother Alex a
[31:45] chance to get back there um thanks
[31:47] brother Sergey to all his help but um
[31:51] you know this uh tonight I'm just going
[31:53] to share with you what what what I see
[31:56] and you
[31:58] you go home and you study it and uh I
[32:01] have prayerfully very prayerfully for
[32:05] weeks to months God has been moving in
[32:09] my heart and you read something you you
[32:12] listen to tapes and and you you hear a
[32:15] brother Minister and God always pointing
[32:17] you to something but you you know you're
[32:19] not catching it and so for for so long I
[32:23] just was praying and just reading and
[32:26] more more tapes and more sermons and and
[32:30] uh brother Alex I also sent it an email
[32:32] just the audio clip to you and if you
[32:33] can play that um mie when it's time
[32:36] instead that'd be great so I keep this
[32:38] slide going but if not that's right um
[32:41] so just coming up to this and and then
[32:44] just the past few weeks you know um was
[32:47] sharing with Alex there when we were
[32:48] traveling to North Idaho a couple weeks
[32:50] a few weeks ago how the Lord's been
[32:52] dealing with my heart about the fact
[32:54] that you know why do I need any other
[32:56] entertainment but besides the word if if
[32:58] my goal is to be Christlike if my goal
[33:00] is to go on a Rapture shouldn't I be
[33:03] doing everything I can be doing to
[33:05] prepare myself for that and so I really
[33:08] took that to heart and I started to to
[33:10] to spend more time in prayer and more
[33:12] time feeding on the word um and and as I
[33:16] did God began to open to my heart more
[33:20] of what I want to talk about tonight and
[33:22] it's a lot I have never had 15 pages of
[33:25] notes in my entire life and I know we're
[33:27] not going to go through them I know that
[33:29] but if we have another opportunity uh we
[33:31] will be a few parts I'm sure but tonight
[33:33] you know we we uh I've heard it said
[33:36] more than once um you study like there
[33:38] is no anointing and then when you come
[33:40] up to preach You Preach like you never
[33:42] studied so we're leaning on God
[33:44] completely I have things on paper or
[33:47] iPad I guess it's not even paper anymore
[33:49] um but we just want God to speak to our
[33:51] hearts and and if
[33:54] uh if if if something isn't um
[33:58] just just I just it's nothing new it's
[34:01] nothing new I'm like it's like you're
[34:03] going to go skydiving right you just
[34:04] think you're going to die because they
[34:06] have to go over everything just in case
[34:07] so this are the footnotes but if you
[34:10] hear something that you haven't heard
[34:11] before just prayerfully go back to the
[34:13] word and correct me if I'm wrong please
[34:16] amen you want to take your Bibles
[34:18] tonight and stand with
[34:20] me we're going to turn to Revelation
[34:22] chapter
[34:26] 4 Revelations chapter
[34:32] 4 Revelations chter 4 we'll read the
[34:36] whole
[34:38] chapter I know it's Wednesday so
[34:40] everybody's full of
[34:44] energy Revelations chapter 4 you know
[34:47] you always wonder when God gives you
[34:49] sermons like tonight on Wednesday
[34:52] night praise the Lord got to keep your
[34:54] thinking caps on and your spiritual
[34:57] jacket on and focus as best you
[34:59] can he says uh very familiar chapter in
[35:03] Revelations and after this I looked and
[35:06] behold the door was opened in heaven and
[35:08] the first voice which I heard was as it
[35:10] were of a trumpet talking with me which
[35:12] said come up hither and I will show thee
[35:14] things which must be Hereafter and
[35:17] immediately I was in the spirit and
[35:19] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[35:21] one sat on the throne and he that sat he
[35:24] that sat was to look upon like a Jasper
[35:26] and a Sardis Stone
[35:29] sardine stone sorry and there was a
[35:31] rainbow round about the throne and in
[35:33] sight like unto an emerald and round
[35:36] about The Throne were four and 20 seats
[35:38] and upon the seats I saw four and 20
[35:41] Elders
[35:43] sitting clothed in white rment and they
[35:46] had on their heads crowns of gold now
[35:48] there's lots in this um I I have my my
[35:52] general thought that the Lord laid on my
[35:53] heart but there's a lot in these
[35:55] scriptures and these quotes that myself
[35:57] I don't yet completely understand
[35:59] everything but that's that's our goal
[36:02] right that's our that's our ambition is
[36:04] to understand Christ as best and get
[36:07] more revelation of Christ and out of the
[36:10] throne preceded Lightnings and Thunders
[36:11] and voices and there was seven lamps of
[36:14] seven of of fire burning Before the
[36:16] Throne which are the seven spirits of
[36:18] God brother B says that's the seven the
[36:20] seven spirits or the seven Messengers to
[36:22] the church ages and so they're coming
[36:25] from the throne and the throne is
[36:27] Lightnings and Thunders and Before the
[36:30] Throne there was a sea of glass like
[36:31] unto Crystal so brother Bram says that
[36:33] was the The Brass sea cuz now this
[36:36] Throne that we're looking at that is the
[36:38] the the the altar or the ark or The
[36:41] Mercy Seat in the holiest of holies
[36:42] because the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[36:45] was modeled after
[36:47] heaven and then now he went from the
[36:50] Tabernacle now it's modeled in us so
[36:53] this is this is
[36:55] now uh the the the brass sea and that's
[36:59] the where they would wash the sacrifices
[37:01] that's the sea of glass like onto
[37:02] Crystal and in the midst of the throne
[37:04] and round about The Throne were four
[37:06] beasts full of eyes before and behind
[37:08] and the first Beast was like a lion
[37:10] second beast like a calf third Beast had
[37:12] a face of as a man and the fourth Beast
[37:15] was like a flying eagle these are the
[37:17] cherubs six wing and the four beasts had
[37:19] each of them six wings about him and
[37:21] they were full of eyes within and they
[37:22] rest not day and night saying holy holy
[37:25] holy Lord God Almighty which was and is
[37:28] and is to come and when those beasts
[37:30] give glory and honor and thanks to him
[37:31] that sat on the throne who liveth
[37:33] forever and ever and the 4 and20 Elders
[37:35] F fall down before him that sat on the
[37:37] throne and worship him that liveth
[37:40] forever and ever and cast their crowns
[37:41] Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy
[37:43] oh Lord to receive glory honor and power
[37:45] for thou Hast created all things and for
[37:47] thy pleasure they are and were
[37:51] created and I in verse f chapter 5 and I
[37:54] saw on the right hand of him that sat on
[37:55] the throne a book written Within on the
[37:57] back I don't have it there Alex on the
[37:59] throne a book written within and on the
[38:01] backside sealed with Seven Seals so now
[38:05] so
[38:07] now the the the Christ on the throne is
[38:10] holding the book so he's on the throne
[38:12] he's behind he's at the mercy seat
[38:14] behind The Mercy Seat and and he just
[38:17] said there was lightning and Thunders
[38:19] and and when the when the priest well I
[38:22] I don't want you to stand forever and it
[38:24] saw a strong angeling with a loud voice
[38:26] who was worthy to open the look and to
[38:27] loose the SE seals thereof and no man in
[38:30] Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the
[38:32] Earth was was able to open the book
[38:36] neither to look thereon so John looks
[38:40] everywhere excuse me John looks
[38:43] everywhere and he see he doesn't see see
[38:45] who's worthy there's nobody worthy and I
[38:48] wept much because no man was found
[38:50] worthy to open to read the book and one
[38:52] of the elders said saith unto me weep
[38:54] not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[38:56] Judah the root of David hath preved
[38:57] bailed to open the book and loose the
[38:59] Seven Seals thereof and I beheld lo in
[39:01] the midst of the throne so he sees the
[39:04] lamb
[39:06] come and the seven horns seven eyes
[39:09] seven spirits of God and he takes the
[39:10] book out of the right hand of him that
[39:12] sat on the
[39:13] throne and when he had taken the book
[39:15] The Four beasts and 4 and20 Elders fell
[39:17] down before the lamb having every one of
[39:18] them Harps
[39:21] okay and that's where we'll stop let's
[39:23] bow our heads Lord Jesus we thank you
[39:25] tonight for your word Lord and father
[39:27] you know my heart my heart's desire just
[39:29] to be completely and totally harnessed
[39:31] to the will of the father Lord that we
[39:33] would just Minister your word and your
[39:34] word only Lord there would be nothing of
[39:36] ours in here father you would Empty Me
[39:37] Out Lord to be completely and totally
[39:40] just uh in your in your hands in in your
[39:43] mercy Lord I do not want in approaching
[39:46] your word I do not want to cause error
[39:48] do not want to add to or take from Lord
[39:50] so may you just help us to settle into
[39:52] that place in your Lord with your word
[39:54] Lord Jesus that you could speak to us
[39:56] and open our eyes we pray in Jesus name
[39:59] amen you can be
[40:03] seated so he he doesn't see the lamb the
[40:06] lamb comes and the lamb takes the book
[40:09] from him that sits on the throne and he
[40:11] takes the book and we know that then
[40:14] follows chapter 6 where he he opens the
[40:17] book The Lamb opens the
[40:19] seals now go to Isaiah chapter
[40:23] 6 and savior's spot there in Revelations
[40:28] Isaiah chapter 6 verse
[40:31] 1-8 like I said this is nothing new and
[40:34] maybe you've
[40:38] already you're far ahead of me in your
[40:42] Revelation uh Isaiah chapter 6 now you
[40:45] have to remember one important thing and
[40:47] I ask you to pray for me because I have
[40:48] a lot up here that I've been studying
[40:52] for a long time and and um I don't want
[40:54] to get I don't want to I don't want
[40:57] something to distract me cuz there's a
[40:59] lot we could go this way and that way
[41:00] and I want to stay right right with what
[41:02] God wants to say tonight so in Isaiah
[41:05] chapter 6 you have to remember as we
[41:07] read the scripture that the the the
[41:10] seals were revealed under the Sixth Seal
[41:14] so first through seven were opened under
[41:16] the Sixth Seal and under the Sixth Seal
[41:19] all seven trumpets were were the
[41:21] trumpets were sounded so Isaiah 6 right
[41:25] chapter 6 I'm not trying to make a
[41:26] Doctrine out but brother bam says the
[41:28] Bible is numerically perfect he says in
[41:31] the year that King Uzziah died I saw
[41:33] also the Lord sitting upon a throne high
[41:35] and lifted up and his train filled the
[41:36] temple and above it stood the seraphim
[41:39] each one had six wings with Twain now
[41:42] the Bible says seraphim but brother bam
[41:43] connects us and says these are the same
[41:45] angels that were the four beasts around
[41:47] the throne with Twain he covered his
[41:49] face with Twain he covered his feet with
[41:51] Twain he did fly and one Cried unto
[41:53] another said holy holy holy is the Lord
[41:55] of hosts the whole earth is full full of
[41:57] his glory and the post of the door moved
[41:59] at the voice of him that cried and the
[42:01] house was filled with smoke then said I
[42:03] so the house so the house is full of
[42:05] smoke you have to remember when John was
[42:06] looking for the lamb he couldn't see the
[42:08] lamb because the lamb was in Christ
[42:10] Behind The Mercy Seat shrouded by the
[42:12] incense that was burning on the altar
[42:14] the pray of the saints that was going up
[42:16] so he couldn't see it but then the lamb
[42:17] stepped out and he took the book okay so
[42:20] so the there's a smoke fills the fills
[42:23] the the house and then I said I woe is
[42:25] me for I am undone because I am a man of
[42:27] unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of
[42:29] a people of unclean lip lips from mine
[42:32] eyes have seen the king the Lord of
[42:33] hosts then flew one of the Sims unto me
[42:36] having a live coal in his hand which he
[42:38] had taken with the tongs from off the
[42:40] Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and
[42:42] said Lo this hath touched thy lips and
[42:44] thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin
[42:46] is purged now remember everything
[42:49] brother BR before he preached s it says
[42:51] God hiding himself in Simplicity and
[42:53] when we try to make it complicated we
[42:56] miss the message we miss the point of
[42:58] everything that was laid out before us
[43:00] everything that was laid out in the word
[43:02] and the point is this right here the
[43:04] purging of our sins we're we're
[43:07] 110% if I can say it in the position now
[43:11] pure vessels because Christ can only
[43:14] inhabit such a vessel so so now here
[43:17] you'll see the the revealing which is
[43:19] the same thing as Revelations 10 1-7 in
[43:22] verse 8 John goes and takes the book
[43:24] Isaiah here he he takes the fire so so
[43:27] so the the opening of the word comes to
[43:30] Isaiah in the form of a coal from the
[43:32] altar from The Mercy Seat which is which
[43:34] is Christ himself the shakina glory of
[43:38] God brother said the shakina of Glory of
[43:40] God now dwells in his people we'll read
[43:42] a quote Here and Now verse eight okay
[43:44] remember numerically it's perfect verse
[43:46] eight also I heard the voice of the Lord
[43:49] saying whom shall I send and who will go
[43:51] for us then said I here am I send me
[43:55] John did the same thing in verse 8
[43:56] revelation 10 1-7 was the was the was
[44:00] the the the the word coming forth which
[44:02] was the the seventh seal the revealing
[44:04] of Christ and then from that on number
[44:06] eight or or as the the the eth the
[44:09] eighth day which is the restart right
[44:11] the Sabbath day the restart the step
[44:13] into
[44:14] eternity the angel says go take the book
[44:17] and then he eats the book so now John
[44:20] must must go prophesy right the type of
[44:22] the Bride Isaiah here saying here am I
[44:25] send me and he said go so verse 9 just
[44:28] the same thing he says go and tell this
[44:29] people hear ye indeed but understand not
[44:32] and see ye indeed but perceive not now I
[44:35] want to read this part I don't fully
[44:36] understand this but I just want to read
[44:38] it because for me it it's it's just I
[44:40] think it it's it's I think it's
[44:43] important uh the the last part of verse
[44:46] 13 so he's sending him out saying go
[44:48] this is what you have to say and he says
[44:49] the holy seed shall be the substance
[44:52] thereof the holy seed which is Christ
[44:55] which is or the word the word is is a
[44:57] seed that is the substance that's in the
[44:59] bride so yet I don't know exactly how
[45:01] that fits but there you go you can take
[45:03] that home and study that so in in uh
[45:07] Revelations oh sorry can you thank you
[45:11] Revelations chapter
[45:13] 4 he says now the The Mercy Seat now the
[45:16] mercy seats in the heart seat were in
[45:20] the heart seat where The Shining forth
[45:22] of his glory in all of his children the
[45:24] shakina glory in the human heart it's
[45:26] it's amazing to me if you go back and
[45:28] you look what brother Bon preached
[45:29] before he preached the seals and how
[45:31] much he was saying that was yet to be
[45:33] opened to our understanding after the
[45:36] seals the man himself in in ministering
[45:38] as as we'll see he ministers this he
[45:40] talks about the mercy seed is now in the
[45:42] human heart so the mercy seat is in the
[45:44] bride he says he says it's the bride's
[45:46] Ministry so now where is Christ God's
[45:49] provided place of worship where is
[45:50] Christ he's in us okay cuz we'll get we
[45:54] I don't want to get ahead of myself here
[45:55] but he says now the mercy seats in the
[45:57] heart the human heart is that right is
[45:59] that The Mercy Seat how do you come to
[46:01] it through okay he says comes into here
[46:04] through here Shak Glory it's God's
[46:06] presence and when a man's walking or a
[46:08] woman he's reflecting the shakina glory
[46:10] the shakina glory was what the scripture
[46:12] used to talk about the presence of God
[46:14] that dwelt in the mercy seat and the
[46:16] holiest of holies it's God's presence
[46:19] okay he says he didn't okay Jesus then
[46:21] Jesus Christ I have so many quotes I'm
[46:23] trying to just skim through them
[46:25] reflects himself through him with the
[46:26] shikan of Glory doing the same things he
[46:29] did back there manifesting the same
[46:31] gospel preaching the same word amen so
[46:35] now we want to turn to Leviticus uh
[46:38] chapter
[46:40] 16 verse one and and I I never did my
[46:43] title can you pull my title screen
[46:44] brother
[46:46] Alex so my title tonight is the breach
[46:48] revealed in the Feast of atonement if
[46:51] you go back and and you just just take a
[46:53] second to look at the title that brother
[46:55] brandham titles he says the breach
[46:58] between the seven Church ages and the
[47:00] Seven Seals so there's a gap between the
[47:04] church ages and the Seven Seals
[47:06] something happens in that space of time
[47:09] he calls it the
[47:10] breach so
[47:12] uh now in in our in our day and age that
[47:16] we live in or the time that we are in we
[47:19] are you can go back to Leviticus 16 here
[47:22] we are we are the Feast of Pentecost
[47:27] has
[47:29] completed the trumpets were comp the
[47:32] Feast of the trumpets you have to
[47:33] remember God ises not always perfectly
[47:35] chronological like we think things can
[47:37] happen at the same time yet it's it's in
[47:40] order in the scriptures but it can
[47:42] happen at the same time so where we are
[47:43] right now is the we have we have moved
[47:46] but the says that the Pentecostal age he
[47:48] said he calls leoa the Pentecostal age
[47:52] so but then he says we have moved beyond
[47:55] that and we are in the briding age
[47:57] Pentecost was the Feast of Weeks or the
[47:59] or the Feast of Pentecost and that was
[48:02] the seven Church ages because it was
[48:03] seven weeks they would wave the wave
[48:05] sheath which was Jesus he was the wave
[48:07] sheath this is what you need to be and
[48:09] they didn't have it they had they had
[48:11] Christ there but they didn't have the
[48:13] the what we have today because without
[48:15] us they are not perfected okay so so you
[48:18] have to remember in time things move in
[48:20] time not not what you have today isn't
[48:23] what they had in in in Wesley's day
[48:25] isn't what they had in in Paul Paul's
[48:27] age oh they had they had they wrote the
[48:28] scriptures they had a revelation but
[48:30] they didn't have what what came to this
[48:32] day which was Christ back the but there
[48:35] says the bride coming of Christ he only
[48:38] says that he only says that line in one
[48:39] in one place and um so so time has
[48:44] progressed so now now the Mysteries
[48:46] being revealed these are the the the the
[48:48] Mysteries the Loose Ends those were the
[48:51] things written on the outside of the top
[48:53] of the mountain and brother and that the
[48:55] junior Jackson had the dream where
[48:57] brother man came and popped the top off
[48:59] and it was white stone that's between
[49:01] the lines that's the revelation of
[49:03] Christ himself the the Mysteries that
[49:05] was part of the completion of the the
[49:08] the of the of his message but that was
[49:11] under Pentecost but now the bride is
[49:14] what we're looking at the white stone at
[49:16] Christ himself revealed in us this is
[49:19] the only age where the word is made
[49:21] flesh in a many membered body Christ
[49:23] poured him Spirit into the church but it
[49:25] wasn't the word made flesh in the first
[49:26] first age that happens today because
[49:28] this is the marriage of the
[49:31] Lamb okay so he had bride down through
[49:33] time but this is the marriage of the
[49:35] Lamb so we we're we the Feast of
[49:38] Pentecost and the trumpets Feast of
[49:40] Pentecost is complete the trumpets we
[49:41] know deals with the Jews and there's
[49:43] still trumpets to sound right because
[49:45] you have uh Moses and Elijah so but this
[49:47] is where we are right now we are
[49:50] underneath this Feast of atonement in
[49:52] time so uh Leviticus chapter 16
[49:57] y'all already
[49:59] there Leviticus chapter
[50:04] 16 you can you can read the Leviticus 23
[50:08] lays
[50:09] out the progression so this Feast of
[50:13] atonement is is the sixth
[50:15] Feast like I said the Bible is is
[50:18] perfect numerically perfect I just want
[50:20] to
[50:24] verify yeah so you have
[50:29] there's seven feasts and the Feast of
[50:31] Tabernacles is the last feast and that's
[50:33] the Millennium so the day a told would
[50:35] be the sixth
[50:36] Feast
[50:39] so verse one and we'll probably go to 24
[50:42] we'll see maybe we'll stop and the Lord
[50:44] spake unto Moses after the death of the
[50:45] two sons of Aaron when they offered
[50:48] before the Lord and died so they they
[50:49] weren't supposed to be doing what they
[50:54] did and the Lord said unto Moses speak
[50:57] unto Aaron thy brother that he come not
[50:59] at all times into the holy place within
[51:01] the veil before the mercy seat which is
[51:04] upon the ark that he die not for I will
[51:06] appear in the cloud upon the mercy
[51:09] seat so again Cloud right obscured can't
[51:14] see behind that unless you go behind The
[51:16] Mercy
[51:17] Seat so he says thus shall Aaron come
[51:20] into the holy place with a young bolock
[51:22] for a sin offering and a RAM for a burnt
[51:24] offering he shall put on the holy Lin
[51:26] coat and he shall have the linen
[51:28] breaches upon his flesh and shall be
[51:30] girded with the linen girdle and with
[51:32] the linen miter shall he be attired
[51:34] These Are Holy garments therefore shall
[51:36] he wash his flesh in water and so put
[51:38] them
[51:40] on and he shall take of the congregation
[51:42] of the children of Israel two kids of
[51:44] the goats for a sin offering and one RAM
[51:46] for a burnt offering and Aaron shall
[51:49] offer his bulock of the sin offering
[51:51] which is for himself and make an
[51:52] atonement for himself and for his house
[51:55] so the Feast of of at atement was was in
[51:57] the was was like I said after the
[51:59] Harvest um and and I can't remember
[52:02] which month it is but it's it's in the
[52:03] fall so we're coming up close to it in
[52:05] the next couple of months and and before
[52:08] Aaron could go and offer the the
[52:11] atonement for the children of Israel for
[52:13] the whole nation so when they sinned and
[52:16] they knew their sins they had to come
[52:17] and bring a sacrifice for themselves to
[52:20] to to restore that right but this is for
[52:23] the this is a this is a I could be so
[52:25] liberal to say a blanket atonement for
[52:28] everything whether they knew
[52:30] it the entire nation purged but before
[52:34] before Aaron can do this he first has to
[52:37] show himself to the children of Israel a
[52:41] worthy priest a worthy high priest
[52:43] because if he goes in to make an
[52:45] atonement for himself and he is not fit
[52:48] to be in that office he doesn't come
[52:50] back out they pull him out by a rope so
[52:53] just like Jesus First St he goes he he
[52:55] makes the atonement and he comes back he
[52:57] goes down to Hell preaches his he
[52:59] preaches down there and he comes back
[53:01] and and um preaches the souls in prison
[53:04] now right they don't accept it but he
[53:06] comes back right so he proved himself a
[53:09] worthy high priest that he made the
[53:12] atonement Jesus made the atonement just
[53:14] like the type of Aaron as the high
[53:15] priest so Aaron does this and he comes
[53:18] back and the children of Israel see him
[53:19] so now he's good they can trust him to
[53:21] go in and do this work of atonement for
[53:24] them
[53:27] verse 11 and Aaron shall bring the
[53:29] Bullock of sin offering which is for
[53:30] himself and shall make an atonement for
[53:32] himself and for his house he shall okay
[53:34] verse 12 and he shall take a sensor full
[53:36] of burning coals of fire from off the
[53:38] altar before the Lord and his hands full
[53:41] of sweet incense beaten small and bring
[53:44] it within the veil I'm going to slow
[53:46] down whatever we get to we get to don't
[53:48] want to rush through this and he shall
[53:51] put the incense upon the fire before the
[53:53] Lord that the cloud of the incense May
[53:55] cover the mercy seed okay okay so again
[53:57] just like John saw there's a there's a
[53:59] shrouding of The Mercy Seat so he looks
[54:01] says where's the lamb which all the
[54:03] while the lamb was behind the The Mercy
[54:04] Seat but then he as the lion of Judah
[54:06] then he steps out as the lamb and he
[54:08] takes the book
[54:10] so Mercy Seat that is upon the testimony
[54:13] that he die not and he shall take up the
[54:15] blood of the bolock and sprinkle it with
[54:17] his finger upon The Mercy Seat okay East
[54:20] word and before the mercy seat shall he
[54:22] sprinkle the of the blood with his
[54:23] finger seven times so he does the that's
[54:26] what he does for himself and he does the
[54:28] exact same thing when he does the
[54:30] sacrifice for the atonement of the
[54:32] children of Israel he takes the blood
[54:34] and he goes the Bible says finger upon
[54:38] The Mercy Seat Eastward so the the
[54:40] holiest of holies was West it was laid
[54:45] out west so the holiest of Hol so the
[54:46] the very back we call it back it would
[54:48] be the front I guess is is um is do I
[54:52] need to change mics are we good okay is
[54:55] West and then you had you know the
[54:56] different directions so if for in order
[54:58] for for the high priest to face Eastward
[55:01] he has to step you know if we if we had
[55:03] the The Mercy Seat was this chair or
[55:06] these chairs since they're
[55:08] connected and this is the west and then
[55:11] sorry folks over there this this is the
[55:15] the mercy SE Aaron comes from the the
[55:17] holy place he comes into the Hol of
[55:19] holies and he steps Behind The Mercy
[55:22] Seat because he's facing Eastward and he
[55:24] sprinkles the with the his finger the
[55:27] blood seven times Eastward he spreads it
[55:29] Eastward okay and the reason it's
[55:31] Eastward but says he emphasizes it in a
[55:33] quote we have the reason it's Eastward
[55:36] he says or he says pay attention to that
[55:38] so because the only way for that to the
[55:40] reason that that's in the scriptures so
[55:42] we know the location of the high priest
[55:44] when he does this he's Behind The Mercy
[55:46] Seat and he spreads that and that that
[55:48] spreading of the blood there was a type
[55:51] for the seven Church ages it was blood
[55:53] for each Church age but then he says
[55:56] then
[55:56] says but and before the mercy seat so
[56:00] now he comes back from around the mercy
[56:02] seat and before the mercy seat he
[56:04] sprinkles blood seven
[56:06] times and then he goes and and and
[56:09] Israel knows their sins have been atoned
[56:12] for amen so that's that's uh you know we
[56:17] see Christ our high priest comes and
[56:19] reveals himself to us that means we are
[56:22] a part of
[56:23] him I can imagine a shout
[56:26] going up from the camp when Aaron would
[56:28] walk out because they knew everything
[56:29] was covered nothing was left out and
[56:33] that's what this is this is the book of
[56:35] redemption nothing is left out it's all
[56:38] taken care
[56:40] of and he shall make verse 16 an
[56:42] atonement for the holy place because of
[56:44] the uncleanness of the children of
[56:47] Israel well we can read verse 15 so you
[56:49] know I'm not making this up then shall
[56:51] he kill the goat of the sin offering
[56:52] that is before that is for the people
[56:55] and bring his blood within the veil and
[56:58] do with that blood as he did with the
[57:00] blood of the bulock and sprinkle it upon
[57:03] the mercy seat and before the mercy
[57:06] seat he shall make an atonement okay and
[57:08] there should be
[57:10] um praise the Lord we'll stop there so
[57:14] so again these are the scriptures but
[57:17] and then um so he spreads it the same
[57:20] way he did but then in Leviticus 23: 27
[57:24] he says also on the 10th day of this
[57:26] seventh month there shall be a day of
[57:28] atonement so that's when that's when the
[57:31] Feast of atonement happens is on the
[57:34] 10th day of the seventh month now the
[57:36] Bible could have easily said the seventh
[57:39] month in the seventh month on the 10th
[57:41] day but it didn't it said the 10th day
[57:44] of the seventh month because it's
[57:46] Revelations 10:7 the Bible has to be
[57:49] perfect numerically everything has to be
[57:52] perfect I used to think that people when
[57:54] they talk like this they were just
[57:55] trying to be extra spiritual but that's
[57:57] not the case but the B labors the point
[57:58] it's numerically perfect and it opens to
[58:01] us what God is doing so Revelations 10:7
[58:04] would be this point in time this this
[58:07] Feast of atonement this the high priest
[58:09] coming forth in this way and um so in in
[58:15] um yeah go ahead and go to the next
[58:17] quote
[58:19] there
[58:21] so I somehow have that quote
[58:27] in here but not in my notes and he shall
[58:30] take so this is Revelation chapter 4
[58:32] part three and he shall take up the
[58:34] blood of the bulock and sprinkle with
[58:35] his finger upon The Mercy Seat upon The
[58:37] Mercy Seat watch we're going to get into
[58:39] this after a while East word he says
[58:41] don't forget that word Eastward where's
[58:43] Jesus coming from the east in a Cloud of
[58:46] Glory where does the sun rise Su n rise
[58:48] east where will the s n rise east where
[58:51] was The Mercy Seat sitting towards the
[58:53] east why have I got you all sitting this
[58:55] way towards the east the altar is to the
[58:58] east we'll say it after a while how
[59:01] beautifully I'm going to draw it
[59:03] out sprinkle it Eastward before the
[59:05] mercy seat shall he sprinkle the blood
[59:07] with his finger seven times seven times
[59:09] toward the East he says the seven Church
[59:11] AES shall be covered by the blood
[59:13] Hallelujah Jesus Christ's blood just as
[59:15] sufficient in yesterday today and
[59:17] forever all right
[59:22] so in order and and we'll just we'll
[59:24] hold there don't don't go
[59:26] in in order to to that's kind of that's
[59:30] a a
[59:31] foundation and you know our title is the
[59:34] breach revealed in the Feast of
[59:36] atonement
[59:37] and if this if this is where we are so
[59:40] brother brandom brother brandom preaches
[59:43] the
[59:44] seals and after he preaches the
[59:47] seals he preaches Christ as the mystery
[59:50] of God revealed now you have to remember
[59:52] his understanding of this his revelation
[59:54] of this was GR growing just as if you
[59:57] were working through the tapes he's
[59:58] ministering in order and God would
[1:00:01] reveal it to you as you come to each
[1:00:03] next sermon was the same thing that was
[1:00:05] happening to him he didn't preach the
[1:00:07] seventh seal and then have it all
[1:00:09] figured out God was opening him himself
[1:00:12] to him and and he preaches the message
[1:00:14] so after the seals he preaches the
[1:00:16] message Christ is the mystery of God
[1:00:18] revealed and I'm sorry this is all the
[1:00:20] quotes I had time to to put into the
[1:00:22] slides but I have them if you want them
[1:00:25] he says God made manifest in Christ
[1:00:27] Christ made manifest in that in the
[1:00:29] bride as God took from the body of Adam
[1:00:32] the woman and she fell God has took from
[1:00:34] the body of Christ his flesh his body
[1:00:37] which is his word and is bringing a
[1:00:39] bride out that won't fall by
[1:00:41] denomination or Creed now Pentecost went
[1:00:44] into
[1:00:46] denomination and and every word to the
[1:00:48] church ages brother says the messenger
[1:00:50] comes at the end of the age well we've
[1:00:51] been here for how many years since
[1:00:53] brother bam has passed away off the
[1:00:54] scene and God God's not going to break
[1:00:57] break the system just because we're a
[1:01:01] latest and age it's got to fit the the
[1:01:03] program and and brother brandham says I
[1:01:06] can't see past
[1:01:09] 1977 and he says you can go through the
[1:01:12] and look at it where he says the
[1:01:13] Pentecostal age has closed so as far as
[1:01:17] the word we're underneath the umbrella
[1:01:18] of the lean Church ages because time
[1:01:21] shall be no more in other words a delay
[1:01:23] in time a delay in time which which is
[1:01:26] God's grace and God's mercy and God's
[1:01:28] plan God is Sovereign like I said I
[1:01:30] don't have everything figured out but
[1:01:31] there's this delaying time but we are in
[1:01:33] the bright age I believe we we all of us
[1:01:36] here understand that
[1:01:39] but so so then he says it's dark past 77
[1:01:42] well that's that's the closing as a
[1:01:44] messenger comes towards the end of the
[1:01:46] age that was the closing of the
[1:01:48] Pentecostal
[1:01:50] Age and and now and now so then this is
[1:01:53] this is all kind of happening and the
[1:01:55] the preaches of seals he's preaching
[1:01:57] Christ's mystery of God revealed which
[1:01:58] is the seventh seal and he's and and and
[1:02:01] so he he's he's beginning to come and
[1:02:03] you can see it in the sermons that he
[1:02:04] preaches which you might as well go to
[1:02:05] the next slide there brother Alex so I I
[1:02:07] took a screenshot of of the sermons and
[1:02:09] I know it's small but that that was just
[1:02:11] what I did I was in a hurry um but he
[1:02:13] preaches Christ as the mystery of God
[1:02:14] revealed and and he so I'll finish
[1:02:17] reading the quotes I have from that
[1:02:18] sermon he says she is coming back with
[1:02:21] the pure unadulterated word of God being
[1:02:23] manifested
[1:02:26] he says later on he says that's the
[1:02:27] reason the revelation of the seven seal
[1:02:29] mystery had to be unfolded now you see
[1:02:32] it what they left off so it's important
[1:02:34] to remember like I said Pentecostal age
[1:02:36] that has closed they went into
[1:02:38] denomination he says that the message
[1:02:39] will never denominate so Christ turned
[1:02:42] the corner and we're in the bride age
[1:02:45] right you have to understand we're still
[1:02:46] underneath the umbrella of the lean
[1:02:48] Church age but that he he calls lean
[1:02:52] Pentecost so it's interchangeable so
[1:02:54] there was that was the seventh Church
[1:02:57] Age and and so I want to put you in the
[1:03:00] place where the Brandon was in as he's
[1:03:02] preaching these messages after the seals
[1:03:04] so in order for in order for the lamb to
[1:03:07] take the book he can't be mediating or
[1:03:11] intercessing behind The Mercy Seat he
[1:03:14] can't be spreading blood for these
[1:03:16] Church ages and go and take the book
[1:03:18] because he takes the book and he stand
[1:03:20] before the mercy seat and he breaks the
[1:03:21] seals open that's the seven sprinklings
[1:03:23] of the blood before the mercy seat so he
[1:03:25] can't do both so brother B preaches the
[1:03:27] seals and God begins to open him to this
[1:03:29] and he preaches this message which is
[1:03:31] very pivotal in this so let's let's this
[1:03:34] is where he is he's seeing it God is
[1:03:35] opening the word he says that's the
[1:03:37] reason the revelation of the seven seal
[1:03:38] mystery had to be
[1:03:40] unfolded he says now you see it what
[1:03:43] they left off if Luther would have went
[1:03:45] on it have been here if Wesley would
[1:03:48] have went on if Pentecost would have
[1:03:51] went on what would they done now there
[1:03:55] was only one thing can happen there has
[1:03:57] to be a message at the end time when
[1:04:00] there is nothing else can follow it
[1:04:03] nothing else can follow it now The
[1:04:05] ecumenical world has set up such a
[1:04:07] regime that there can be no denomination
[1:04:09] and no not nothing else follow
[1:04:12] it he says she is ripening into
[1:04:15] Christlike fruit bringing forth the same
[1:04:18] mellowness and sweetness and the same
[1:04:20] spirit that he had in him now really
[1:04:23] quickly you have to remember where we
[1:04:25] are where in this point in time where
[1:04:28] where because like I said time moves on
[1:04:30] right so some of the stuff history be or
[1:04:32] prophecy becomes history so in in this
[1:04:35] point in time there in 6 uh
[1:04:37] 63 you have you have the two you as in
[1:04:41] the days and I'm trying to keep this in
[1:04:42] continuity so you understand as in the
[1:04:44] days of of lot so shall it be in the
[1:04:46] coming of the son of man two angels went
[1:04:49] down to Sodom to preach and and down
[1:04:52] there they had they had lot right who
[1:04:55] was a a make
[1:04:56] believer and then you have the
[1:04:58] unbelievers in Sodom but you had those
[1:04:59] two angels go so that's that's or
[1:05:01] Roberts and Billy Graham which they're
[1:05:03] both off the scene now but and brother M
[1:05:07] says and I wish I got the quote I there
[1:05:09] were so many quotes I had to pick and
[1:05:10] choose and I still put too many in but
[1:05:12] brother brah says when God came down to
[1:05:15] Abraham he created a body he said a man
[1:05:19] flesh to step into like a
[1:05:22] prophet and he speaks to to brother
[1:05:25] brand Abraham and he says I will visit
[1:05:27] you according to the time of life and
[1:05:30] you shall have a son his backs to the
[1:05:33] tent Sarah laughs and he discerns
[1:05:35] Sarah's heart so it's it's a sign which
[1:05:38] is which is exactly what happened in
[1:05:39] brother bram's Ministry okay and he says
[1:05:43] he calls Sarah out and everything and
[1:05:45] all that happens is to show that
[1:05:46] discernment of the hearts and then he
[1:05:50] the then the man this the Lord the angel
[1:05:54] of the Lord goes off the scene or or the
[1:05:56] man the the the the the the the
[1:05:58] messenger that was sent goes off the
[1:06:00] scene but he revealed himself to Abraham
[1:06:05] because Abraham takes a covenant and
[1:06:06] Abraham gets the name change before this
[1:06:08] meeting so Abraham is revealed now all
[1:06:11] this time taring for the promise all
[1:06:13] through the church ages they were caring
[1:06:15] for the promise they were looking to
[1:06:17] what you have today they were Desiring
[1:06:20] it they were pressing for it they wanted
[1:06:21] it Abraham they're pressing for however
[1:06:24] many years for the prom and then God
[1:06:26] comes in this channel of time because it
[1:06:28] had to be a perfect type to today and he
[1:06:31] and he shows himself so we have the the
[1:06:33] cloud right just the is the coming of
[1:06:35] Christ right that is where a lot of
[1:06:37] people in the message missed it is that
[1:06:39] Christ came he didn't come in in in in
[1:06:41] his in his in his in his body form and
[1:06:44] and take the Rapture he came in his
[1:06:46] bride the bride coming of Christ and the
[1:06:48] only way that can happen is if you get
[1:06:51] the promised son so the message comes to
[1:06:54] Abraham and then comes forth from there
[1:06:56] the promised son so that is where where
[1:06:59] we're at in time right there and then he
[1:07:02] preaches so you can see he preaches
[1:07:04] Christ Ministry of God revealed so now I
[1:07:05] just went straight to Jeffersonville
[1:07:07] because he says in these in these latter
[1:07:08] years of his ministry I only preach
[1:07:10] Doctrine there out there I preach
[1:07:12] Evangelistic fundamentals in the token
[1:07:15] he says it's a seed a sign that the seed
[1:07:18] has been
[1:07:24] deratization the progression of what
[1:07:26] he's coming to it's a my own life and
[1:07:29] I'll raise it up again at the last days
[1:07:31] and as you walk you have confidence that
[1:07:34] the Life of Christ is in you if you
[1:07:36] remember that Abraham had the
[1:07:39] circumcision he had the circumcision he
[1:07:42] had the Holy Spirit now that was enough
[1:07:44] for
[1:07:45] Pentecost but then when God turned a
[1:07:47] corner you're sealed by the Holy Spirit
[1:07:49] and this is where I have to be careful
[1:07:50] because this is is brother and I have
[1:07:52] lots of quotes in the token here where
[1:07:54] he goes back and forth but it is the
[1:07:56] holy ghost that is what SEALs you that
[1:07:57] is the token it is the life in the blood
[1:07:59] he emphasizes it over and over and over
[1:08:01] again he says the token is the Holy
[1:08:03] Ghost he says but it's the life so
[1:08:05] Pentecost got the Holy Ghost but they
[1:08:07] didn't get Christ
[1:08:09] himself okay so we as a message we
[1:08:13] turned the corner somewhere you you
[1:08:15] could speculate say 77 78 whatever I
[1:08:18] don't know somewhere we turned the
[1:08:19] corner and and a and a bride begin to
[1:08:22] catch the Revelation that it's the
[1:08:25] promised son manifested inside of
[1:08:28] us the Holy Ghost was for Pentecost we
[1:08:32] are sealed by the Holy Spirit we needed
[1:08:34] that age we needed that time the we the
[1:08:37] Feast of Pentecost we needed that but
[1:08:39] then God steps forth himself and he says
[1:08:43] and he reveals himself he tears the
[1:08:45] seals off of the book The Book of
[1:08:47] redemption and he reveals himself to you
[1:08:49] and I and now we're in the bride age
[1:08:51] receiving the word himself so brother
[1:08:53] random is coming to this and he's and
[1:08:55] he's talking about you know Holy Ghost
[1:08:57] and and he talks about the astronaut age
[1:08:59] which I don't know if I have the quote
[1:09:00] or not he says see how far beyond we are
[1:09:03] justification sanctification and the
[1:09:04] Holy Ghost he says it's astronaut age so
[1:09:07] you could take that and run with that
[1:09:08] and say well we have to have something
[1:09:10] more than the Holy Ghost but you got to
[1:09:12] take that and run that back through the
[1:09:13] message because he says the holy spirit
[1:09:15] is the seal so what is he talking about
[1:09:18] brother man is contradicting himself no
[1:09:20] you cannot receive Christ himself the
[1:09:22] promised son in your flesh until you are
[1:09:25] sealed by the Holy Spirit but you must
[1:09:28] receive him yes you must catch a
[1:09:30] revelation of Christ to you you have to
[1:09:34] there there's no if buts ands about
[1:09:37] it Having the Holy Ghost now I have to
[1:09:41] be careful right isn't enough you
[1:09:44] understand what I'm saying the Holy
[1:09:45] Ghost seals you and brings to you to
[1:09:47] Christ but this is where brother R says
[1:09:49] you can get the Holy Ghost every day of
[1:09:50] your life and go to hell right anointed
[1:09:53] by because they're just anointed by it
[1:09:55] yeah so Pentecost was anointed by the
[1:09:57] Holy Ghost they had all the signs and
[1:09:58] the Wonders and if you and I really
[1:10:00] believe in my heart if you can catch
[1:10:02] this you can see where we are today in
[1:10:04] the
[1:10:05] church because every age prior fought
[1:10:09] the succeeding
[1:10:11] age they said Luther said sanctification
[1:10:14] what are you talking about we're
[1:10:16] Justified the just shall live by faith
[1:10:18] Wesley said what is this Holy Ghost you
[1:10:20] Holy
[1:10:21] Rollers now Pentecost Now Catch This
[1:10:24] Pentecost is looking to to you saying
[1:10:26] where's the signs where's the Wonders
[1:10:29] yeah and you're over here saying it's
[1:10:31] the word yeah absolutely see there's a
[1:10:34] corner that God turned and we'll pray
[1:10:35] that we're not saying that those who say
[1:10:37] that are sealed they're done we're not
[1:10:39] saying that but it's evidence that God
[1:10:42] turned a corner and we're in the bright
[1:10:44] age now it's God himself revealed to us
[1:10:47] because he's not mediating Behind The
[1:10:49] Mercy Seat he can't be and brother B is
[1:10:52] coming to that so he says as you walk
[1:10:55] you have confidence The Life of Christ
[1:10:56] is in you you are in him by one Spirit
[1:10:59] we're all baptized into one body and
[1:11:01] seal there by the Holy Ghost among this
[1:11:05] Believers like this
[1:11:11] okay we apply the token which is the
[1:11:13] seal the believer today standing under
[1:11:16] the shed blood identified with the
[1:11:19] sacrifice you start to hear him in this
[1:11:21] message talk about identified identify
[1:11:24] with the sacrifice
[1:11:25] he says oh it's not the blood he says
[1:11:28] his blood went into the ground and it
[1:11:30] and it went back to the particles that
[1:11:31] it was made of he says it's the life in
[1:11:34] the blood and he says he says he says
[1:11:38] the blood is the token then he says the
[1:11:39] holy spirit is the token and he says
[1:11:41] you're identified with with Christ so he
[1:11:43] goes it sounds like he's contradicting
[1:11:45] himself but he's covering if if you can
[1:11:48] say it this way he's covering the
[1:11:50] perimeter of the Revelation that is that
[1:11:52] it's the whole thing it's the life
[1:11:55] you're sealed with the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:57] you're identified with the sacrifice of
[1:11:59] the blood see he says see you are
[1:12:01] identified in your life by your
[1:12:03] sacrifice that makes you what you are
[1:12:06] now he says something here very
[1:12:08] important he says the blood is the token
[1:12:11] and the token must be applied
[1:12:14] see or it's not even the Covenant is
[1:12:18] excuse me not in effect the Covenant was
[1:12:22] the circumcision that God gave to the
[1:12:24] children to Abraham
[1:12:25] so without the token applied the
[1:12:28] Covenant is not in
[1:12:31] effect brother talks about the foolish
[1:12:34] virgin he said they have the seed but
[1:12:36] they don't have the moisture to make it
[1:12:38] grow right they didn't have oil in their
[1:12:41] lamps so in order to to if you will to
[1:12:46] activate the token you've got to have
[1:12:48] the
[1:12:50] Covenant but in order for the Covenant
[1:12:52] to be activated you have to have the
[1:12:54] token yeah but he says the Holy Ghost is
[1:12:58] the token amen you see because he's
[1:13:01] preaching he's preaching what he doesn't
[1:13:04] even yet understand but he's coming to
[1:13:06] you'll see that as we go down through
[1:13:08] these some of these sermons but he in
[1:13:10] Genesis 17 verse 10 this to God speaking
[1:13:13] to Abraham this is my Covenant which ye
[1:13:16] shall keep between me and you and thy
[1:13:17] seed after thee every man child among
[1:13:20] you shall be
[1:13:23] circumcised there's also PR destination
[1:13:25] in there but Abraham didn't have the
[1:13:28] promised
[1:13:29] son he had the Covenant but that didn't
[1:13:32] give him the son if if if it
[1:13:34] was if it was just get the Holy Ghost
[1:13:39] again I think we've laid the basis of
[1:13:40] what I mean when I say that then then
[1:13:43] there would have been the promised son
[1:13:46] but the word had to come to Abraham and
[1:13:48] reveal himself and make a sign to
[1:13:51] Abraham the Discerning of the hearts in
[1:13:53] order for Abraham to get the promise son
[1:13:55] so it was the opening of the word to
[1:13:57] Abraham brought forth the promised son
[1:14:00] so but he had to have the Covenant and
[1:14:02] that's exactly what brother B was
[1:14:04] talking about when he's preaching the
[1:14:05] token he's saying you need the life he
[1:14:08] says I need to look at you and I need to
[1:14:10] see Christ because he all these people
[1:14:12] running around say I got the Holy Ghost
[1:14:14] I got the Holy Ghost no life to match it
[1:14:17] right oh I got delivered I got healed so
[1:14:20] what show me your life James says show
[1:14:22] me your faith by your Works in other
[1:14:24] words James wants to see evidence of the
[1:14:25] token in your life and brother brandham
[1:14:27] is calling out for the same thing here
[1:14:29] under the
[1:14:30] anointing so the circumcision of the
[1:14:32] heart we know that's the Holy Spirit
[1:14:35] after the circumcision then came the
[1:14:37] promised son so there is something more
[1:14:40] for us there is Christ himself you got
[1:14:43] the Holy Ghost you're moving on in the
[1:14:45] right direction you've crossed the river
[1:14:47] Jordan you're moving unto
[1:14:51] adoption which is what's the top of the
[1:14:54] pyramid Christ himself Divine love and
[1:14:57] brother Brenham I don't if I have the
[1:15:01] quote I do have the quot so we'll come
[1:15:03] to
[1:15:04] that so in in the countdown he says
[1:15:07] astronauts how far it is back from the
[1:15:09] old horse and buggy how far it is even
[1:15:11] from the airplane how far it is from
[1:15:14] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:15:17] the Holy Ghost they're coming to
[1:15:19] Eagles the first they were friends
[1:15:23] excuse me they were lizards then they
[1:15:24] become chicken and they become crows now
[1:15:26] they're Eagles no one can follow them
[1:15:29] when the seventh seal was opened there
[1:15:31] was a a
[1:15:33] a silence in heaven for the space of a
[1:15:37] half an
[1:15:38] hour there was a white stone nothing
[1:15:41] written in other words it takes the C
[1:15:44] Gene of God it takes Christ himself to
[1:15:47] reveal Christ himself to you it's not
[1:15:50] written it can't be written because this
[1:15:53] is a secret not even the the devil
[1:15:56] understands you see he gets the Holy
[1:15:58] Ghost he impersonates it all the
[1:16:01] time because the Holy Ghost will make
[1:16:02] you run run up and down and shout and do
[1:16:04] all that they will it can
[1:16:06] happen but he's imperson but but brother
[1:16:09] says he will not
[1:16:11] impersonate now I hope you're moving
[1:16:13] with me here and in the token again he
[1:16:16] says the token never come into existence
[1:16:19] until the evening
[1:16:22] time God is requiring a token that you
[1:16:24] your yourself have received his token
[1:16:26] the Holy Ghost it's the only way the
[1:16:29] only sign that God will ever pass
[1:16:31] because it is the literal life of Jesus
[1:16:34] Christ returned back into the believer
[1:16:38] I'm reading these quotes from The Token
[1:16:39] but they're not they're not all together
[1:16:41] in order I'm jumping through here the
[1:16:43] token is the Holy Ghost upon the church
[1:16:45] that they see Christ not a third person
[1:16:48] same person returned again in the form
[1:16:50] of the Holy Ghost to continue the work
[1:16:53] on Jesus Christ this today and forever
[1:16:55] that's the token see he says he says
[1:17:00] form of the Holy Ghost to continue the
[1:17:02] work on continues on said the book of
[1:17:04] Acts he says Jesus Christ the same
[1:17:06] yesterday today and forever that's the
[1:17:09] token I'm telling you go back and listen
[1:17:11] to this to this sermon and you'll see
[1:17:13] where he bounces back and forth it seems
[1:17:15] like but he's he's laboring the point it
[1:17:17] is Christ
[1:17:19] himself he says remember if that token
[1:17:21] was not displayed even the Covenant was
[1:17:23] anold so the children of Israel in Egypt
[1:17:26] had the Covenant they were all
[1:17:27] circumcised yet if they did not apply
[1:17:30] the blood to the doorpost they died the
[1:17:32] firstborn
[1:17:34] died you see so so he's not he the
[1:17:36] baptism of the Holy Spirit seals you but
[1:17:40] you need Christ himself you need the
[1:17:41] promised son but if you're sealed of the
[1:17:43] Holy Ghost you will come to
[1:17:45] this you see look you can't explain it
[1:17:48] even as a
[1:17:49] minister it's between the lies you know
[1:17:52] I I sent for the Sergey this if you look
[1:17:53] between between the lines in your Bible
[1:17:56] it's white it's the white stone
[1:17:58] okay so and I didn't I didn't make that
[1:18:01] up so I got that from somebody else but
[1:18:03] it's all the word so you you you you
[1:18:06] just have to have God show it to you
[1:18:08] revelation of it because he hides it
[1:18:11] right but it's in
[1:18:13] simplicity so the Covenant was unold
[1:18:16] there was there was there was no
[1:18:19] Covenant as long as that token wasn't
[1:18:20] there so they had proof of circumcision
[1:18:24] but without the token
[1:18:25] applied it was anold in other words
[1:18:28] Pentecost wasn't wasn't enough you see
[1:18:32] what I'm saying you got to have Christ
[1:18:34] him Christ in you the hope of glory but
[1:18:39] you need the Holy Ghost and if you
[1:18:40] really have the Holy Ghost you will come
[1:18:42] to Christ I'm going to make sure I back
[1:18:44] that up because you could really go off
[1:18:46] the deeping with this right so we need
[1:18:49] something no we need God what it is when
[1:18:51] we say something more you need the Holy
[1:18:53] Spirit to then have God reveal himself
[1:18:55] to you
[1:18:56] greater every day passes God opens
[1:18:59] himself up to you more and is that
[1:19:01] intimate relationship that brings forth
[1:19:04] the promised son so there is more there
[1:19:07] is more but a true b a true child of God
[1:19:10] with the baptism of the Holy Spirit Will
[1:19:12] desire the more Jacob but says Jacob had
[1:19:15] to had to focus on the one thing that
[1:19:17] mattered was the birthright yeah the
[1:19:21] token stood for the Covenant so he says
[1:19:23] the covenants anull without the the
[1:19:24] token but he says the token stood for
[1:19:26] the Covenant so it's the life on
[1:19:29] display that stands for the Holy Spirit
[1:19:32] the life on display that stands for the
[1:19:34] Covenant that you have show me your
[1:19:37] faith by your works for the token had to
[1:19:40] be it wasn't in effect the token wasn't
[1:19:42] okay so but but Jesus says in the
[1:19:44] gospels he says Those Who hear my word
[1:19:46] and do them right so that's hearing your
[1:19:49] word takes takes the Holy Spirit
[1:19:51] revelation of Christ takes the Holy
[1:19:52] Spirit purges The Vessel you hear the
[1:19:55] word you revelate of the word and then
[1:19:57] when you do it you are displaying the
[1:19:59] token but we're not preaching the
[1:20:03] token
[1:20:07] okay yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna stop stop
[1:20:10] with the token here it was just I got
[1:20:12] into it and it was just so
[1:20:16] good okay so now brother brandom comes
[1:20:19] down and he preaches he preaches Souls
[1:20:22] that are in prison now
[1:20:29] and this is in the
[1:20:30] morning and he's preaching and he's
[1:20:36] saying the seals are open I'm
[1:20:39] paraphrasing the seals are open but if
[1:20:41] they're open the Lamb's not behind the
[1:20:43] throne and if the Lamb's not behind the
[1:20:45] throne mediating for the church ages
[1:20:48] then who can be saved right he's Waring
[1:20:51] with it's in his sermon he says it looks
[1:20:53] like it could it be I don't know he says
[1:20:56] but under the Sixth Seal this is from
[1:20:58] the same sermon were there were were
[1:21:00] where these trumpets opened remember
[1:21:02] under there we find out that the lamb
[1:21:04] came forth appeared on the scene he left
[1:21:07] The Mercy Seat his work of redemption
[1:21:09] was finished and he come forth and took
[1:21:12] the book out of the right hand of him
[1:21:13] that sat upon the throne now I can't
[1:21:15] explain to you exactly everything here
[1:21:18] because I wasn't born yet when the when
[1:21:21] the Pentecost and God moved the corner I
[1:21:22] wasn't born yet so but all these names
[1:21:26] were written on the book before the
[1:21:27] foundation of the
[1:21:29] world okay God doesn't need you to be
[1:21:32] born to you know complete something like
[1:21:35] this he's Eternal he's outside of time
[1:21:37] but he works according to his pattern of
[1:21:39] scripture okay so he says he had left
[1:21:41] The Mercy Seat his work of redemption
[1:21:43] was finished and he come forth and he
[1:21:45] took the book out of the right hand of
[1:21:47] him that sat upon the throne and time
[1:21:49] was no more and immediately an angel
[1:21:52] appeared in the seventh chapter or he
[1:21:54] says or the 10th chapter and the 7th
[1:21:56] verse jump with me real quick
[1:21:59] Revelations 10 verse 7 I think we can
[1:22:02] most of us quote it by heart but I like
[1:22:04] to read it
[1:22:08] anyways Revelations 10:7 now remember
[1:22:11] this is the Feast of
[1:22:13] atonement in the 10th day of the seventh
[1:22:16] month but in the days of the voice of
[1:22:18] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:22:19] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:22:21] finished as Heath declared to his
[1:22:23] servants the prophets
[1:22:25] so the prophet had to come to bring this
[1:22:27] scripture to pass to bring us to verse 8
[1:22:30] but he says he says or the 10th chapter
[1:22:34] 7th verse the angel come down and swore
[1:22:36] that time was no longer so he's reading
[1:22:38] he's referencing verse six he's talking
[1:22:40] about the mighty Angel standing and he
[1:22:42] has he has I think it was the the book
[1:22:46] little book open and his right foot on
[1:22:47] the sea and his left foot on the earth
[1:22:49] so he's talking about this he says but
[1:22:51] you see in this book was what was
[1:22:53] redeemed it was the book of redemption
[1:22:56] and everything that he had redeemed was
[1:22:58] written in that book all that he died
[1:23:01] for was written in the book he could not
[1:23:03] leave his mediatorial seat until he had
[1:23:05] thoroughly
[1:23:07] redeemed like I said I can't explain the
[1:23:09] fact I wasn't born yet but that's what
[1:23:11] he's saying he said he couldn't leave
[1:23:13] till it was thoroughly redeemed he
[1:23:14] couldn't redeem it at the cross because
[1:23:16] they were predestinated in the Lamb's
[1:23:18] Book of Life he had to stay on there to
[1:23:20] make intercessions until the last person
[1:23:23] was finished
[1:23:25] later on in the sermon he says after the
[1:23:27] book was taken by the lamb he says the
[1:23:29] Sixth Seal is revealed and all the seals
[1:23:33] so the lamb has to take the book in
[1:23:35] order for all the seals to be open and
[1:23:37] he knows the seals are open and we know
[1:23:39] the seals are open so he's confronted
[1:23:40] with this conundrum this this problem of
[1:23:43] the fact that if if if the seals are
[1:23:44] open which I believe they are then the
[1:23:46] then the Christ isn't mediating Behind
[1:23:49] The Mercy Seat because you can't do that
[1:23:51] and open the seals so he says it could
[1:23:54] be I hope hope it isn't it could be all
[1:23:56] right he says the lamb had redeemed it
[1:23:59] but he could not come forth until every
[1:24:01] name was
[1:24:03] revealed what does revealed mean in this
[1:24:06] context born obviously not and that was
[1:24:10] taking place under the Sixth Seal before
[1:24:14] the seventh broke then the now remember
[1:24:17] the revelation of the seventh seal is is
[1:24:19] opened but the seal itself is is the the
[1:24:23] culmination of of everything the time
[1:24:25] and and going off to the Millennium but
[1:24:27] it's revealed he says then the then the
[1:24:29] lamb came forth from for for what he had
[1:24:32] redeemed he comes to claim what he had
[1:24:34] redeemed it's already got it right there
[1:24:36] in the book taking it from his hand now
[1:24:38] he's coming to receive what he has
[1:24:40] redeemed that's his work he's done he's
[1:24:43] come to receive
[1:24:44] it has proven it the seventh seal proved
[1:24:47] it come back and took the book of
[1:24:49] redemption then he
[1:24:52] says it could be I hope it isn't it
[1:24:55] could be right so he's Waring with
[1:24:57] this and we read we read Isaiah 6 1-8
[1:25:01] and you can read Revelations and and uh
[1:25:04] oh I'm sorry we read re we read
[1:25:06] Revelations 7 but you we all familiar
[1:25:09] with 1 through 7 so I'll just jump here
[1:25:12] the uh verse eight and the voice which I
[1:25:13] heard from Heaven spake unto me again
[1:25:15] and said go take the little book which
[1:25:17] is open in the hand of the Angel which
[1:25:19] standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth
[1:25:21] so the book is opened the book is open
[1:25:24] so the the lamb had to come break the
[1:25:26] seals so the lamb is in front of the
[1:25:27] mercy
[1:25:28] seat and he sprinkles seven times
[1:25:30] because he's breaking the seals
[1:25:34] open that is in the morning but man
[1:25:36] preaches the souls that in prison now
[1:25:37] and it's it's it's it's it's it's solemn
[1:25:41] it's intense he's seeing this what's
[1:25:45] going to happen
[1:25:46] now and that evening he preaches he that
[1:25:50] is in
[1:25:51] you yeah good I'm I mean Saints I was
[1:25:55] going through this last night and I just
[1:25:58] in my office as I as I sat there and I
[1:26:00] looked at these sermons and the
[1:26:02] progression of these sermons and the
[1:26:03] titles that they held I begin to weep
[1:26:06] and I realize what what a what a first
[1:26:08] of all I realized what a what a
[1:26:10] dedication the prophet had to fulfilling
[1:26:12] God's
[1:26:13] Will and second I I realized how well
[1:26:17] that's the most important thing was how
[1:26:19] marvelous God's word is he preaches he
[1:26:23] that is in you so he's having this war
[1:26:26] where is if he's not on the earth seat
[1:26:27] then how can no more people be saved
[1:26:31] then he comes and he preaches he that is
[1:26:33] in you he says now but he that's in you
[1:26:35] is greater than he that's in the world
[1:26:38] God in you like he was in Jesus Christ
[1:26:43] because what all God was he poured into
[1:26:45] Christ and all Christ was he poured into
[1:26:47] the church see that's God in you he
[1:26:51] that's in you so now brother catches
[1:26:53] revelation the mercy seed is in the
[1:26:55] Bride of Jesus Christ because it's God
[1:26:58] in you and I read there you you see two
[1:27:00] years prior to this he preaches how the
[1:27:02] mercy seed is in the heart so God moves
[1:27:05] and now he's in the Bride of Jesus
[1:27:07] Christ and now he says you are Kings and
[1:27:10] Priests so we are the high priests we
[1:27:13] are the mediators we we you know if they
[1:27:16] give you a cup of water they can be
[1:27:18] given eternal life right there's and and
[1:27:20] and all of these things so Christ now he
[1:27:22] says he says go
[1:27:24] he says Christ and I paraphrase will we
[1:27:26] continue his ministry in the bride his
[1:27:29] ministry continues in the bride in the
[1:27:31] bride age so there there you have he he
[1:27:35] realizes it's literally Christ in you
[1:27:38] it's literally Christ made flesh in the
[1:27:41] people and then and he says and so he
[1:27:42] preaches and we'll just do this real
[1:27:44] quick he preaches what shall I so he he
[1:27:46] preaches souls are now what are we going
[1:27:47] to do there's no more Mercy then he
[1:27:49] realizes oh it's he that is in you amen
[1:27:52] then he says what are we going to do
[1:27:54] what Jesus called
[1:27:56] Christ then he goes on he says he says
[1:27:58] he placed the gifts and then he preaches
[1:28:00] Church order what is he coming to he's
[1:28:02] coming to where's it at okay it's
[1:28:05] further down he's coming to a place
[1:28:07] because now if it's Christ revealed open
[1:28:09] to you and Christ comes forth from the
[1:28:11] breaking of these seals now there's
[1:28:13] something coming there's something
[1:28:15] that's going to happen it's called The
[1:28:17] Marriage of the Lamb he says so he gives
[1:28:19] Church order he places an order and then
[1:28:21] there's some some more sermons here but
[1:28:22] the unveiling of God God Amen this is
[1:28:25] what's coming forth from the real of
[1:28:27] Revelation it's Christ in you and he he
[1:28:30] preached that before but he's seeing it
[1:28:32] for himself just like we are today and
[1:28:34] he preaches the
[1:28:37] Masterpiece Go I mean that sermon he
[1:28:39] says it pleased him to bruise Christ
[1:28:42] because it was his Masterpiece when when
[1:28:44] when when when uh Michelangelo struck
[1:28:46] the statue that peace broke off only
[1:28:49] that peace can only fit that statue he
[1:28:52] says that's a mercy to se
[1:28:54] he preaches Rec the Feast of the
[1:28:56] trumpets he clarifies the trumpets and
[1:28:58] and they reveal them The Sixth Seal
[1:28:59] recognizing your day and its message
[1:29:01] future home of the Heavenly badroom so
[1:29:03] it's like he's talking to the fiance
[1:29:05] yeah he's saying this is look he says
[1:29:08] this is how this is how God's gifts
[1:29:10] works this is what you do with Christ
[1:29:12] this is Introduction this is
[1:29:16] Christ this is how this is this is the
[1:29:19] gifts this is how I want the things set
[1:29:21] in order and then he says then this and
[1:29:24] unveils God the unveiling of God he says
[1:29:26] the the the bail has been rent right so
[1:29:30] he's going on then he says now this is
[1:29:32] what praise God this is what your home's
[1:29:35] going to look like he said that that
[1:29:37] that he tells a story I don't I know it
[1:29:39] might be in that Ser he tells a story
[1:29:40] about the girl who who who going to
[1:29:42] marry the the was the Armor All boy and
[1:29:44] he goes back and he builds her a home
[1:29:46] and he comes back and he gets her right
[1:29:47] he's telling that story somewhere in
[1:29:49] here and then he preaches the seed is
[1:29:50] not air with the Shu so now he says you
[1:29:53] are going to be married to Christ but
[1:29:55] there's a
[1:29:56] separation he says God has been in
[1:29:58] unveiled to you or the word says God has
[1:30:01] been unveiled to you now a separation
[1:30:04] comes separation from what from
[1:30:08] Pentecost moving into the bride age next
[1:30:11] slide he preaches this day this
[1:30:13] scripture is
[1:30:15] fulfilled then he preaches God's chosen
[1:30:17] place of worship he says where you
[1:30:20] already read further I know you did
[1:30:21] where where is God's chosen place of
[1:30:23] worship he says where he puts his word
[1:30:26] where his word is he's identify then he
[1:30:29] says he says I marry you to
[1:30:32] Christ that's just a wedding ceremony
[1:30:34] for somebody you think that was there by
[1:30:35] accident no way God he says you are Ms
[1:30:39] Jesus Christ am that's right you see
[1:30:41] this building up he says what are we
[1:30:42] going to do there's no more Mercy then
[1:30:43] he says oh it's he that is in you and
[1:30:46] then from there he unveils God and it's
[1:30:48] Church order and this is what your home
[1:30:50] is going to look like and then we have
[1:30:51] smack in the middle of this wedding
[1:30:53] ceremony
[1:30:55] and then he clears up marriage and
[1:30:56] divorce why because your husband has old
[1:31:00] husband has to be
[1:31:02] dead you can't marry Christ until your
[1:31:05] old husband's dead that's right and then
[1:31:08] who is this
[1:31:09] mzc and then he
[1:31:12] preaches is the rising of the
[1:31:16] sun I had quotes for each of these
[1:31:18] sermons but we're just going to push
[1:31:22] forward we're not we're going to go back
[1:31:24] so he preaches the
[1:31:26] Masterpiece and in the Masterpiece is
[1:31:28] the first time so go back to there slide
[1:31:31] I guess I have the remote here but um
[1:31:34] I'll put it
[1:31:36] away so he there's the unveiling of God
[1:31:39] and then he preaches the Masterpiece and
[1:31:41] it's in the Masterpiece he tells the
[1:31:44] vision for the first time of the preview
[1:31:46] of the Bride in the
[1:31:48] church he had not yet gone there that
[1:31:51] was the first time God show somewhere in
[1:31:53] this time frame God shows him this
[1:31:54] Vision the preview of the Bride he says
[1:31:57] now I'm going to tell you the tell the
[1:31:58] vision I don't know that I can interpret
[1:32:00] it I'm going to tell I'm going to tell
[1:32:01] the vision for my first
[1:32:05] time so he tells he he gives he gives a
[1:32:08] preview of The Bride I don't have the
[1:32:09] quote here but you can you can go back
[1:32:10] and find it in the Masterpiece and he
[1:32:12] says you know I saw the Bride come up oh
[1:32:15] beautiful lovely lady and then said
[1:32:17] here's comes the Church of this country
[1:32:19] or this nation and this nation and the
[1:32:20] Church of America and they said they had
[1:32:22] a paper before them and wiggling around
[1:32:24] doing all this stuff and he said I was
[1:32:26] just smitten and then God and then he
[1:32:28] said Here Comes the Bride again he said
[1:32:30] because it's the Alpha and Omega what
[1:32:32] she was at the beginning she is now
[1:32:33] again again today and he says the last
[1:32:36] few started to get out out of line and
[1:32:39] and there's a one place you can find it
[1:32:40] where he says they were looking they
[1:32:43] were looking to that and and both times
[1:32:45] he tells the
[1:32:47] vision both times it tells the vision
[1:32:49] they're they're they're he says they're
[1:32:50] walking like the beat of rock and roll
[1:32:52] and they're walk and then the the bride
[1:32:54] was walking through the rhythm of like
[1:32:56] Onward Christian Soldiers so they look
[1:32:59] off what do they get distracted by could
[1:33:01] be the music could be the doctrines but
[1:33:03] they get distracted by the church the
[1:33:04] last few in the preview of the Bride
[1:33:07] which is where we are today the last few
[1:33:10] get
[1:33:13] distracted in Isaiah it says there is a
[1:33:15] Highway and a
[1:33:18] way so the way is perfect there's
[1:33:21] distractions on either side of the the
[1:33:23] highway but the way is perfect because
[1:33:26] it's the bride from the church amen so
[1:33:30] where does that leave this filthy
[1:33:32] looking example of a
[1:33:33] church I don't believe it's it's he does
[1:33:36] type it to completely how they're in the
[1:33:38] state of undress but it's also spiritual
[1:33:41] they've got a paper before them I got
[1:33:44] the
[1:33:45] message I got the
[1:33:47] quotes he yet no life to back it
[1:33:50] up and the bride gets distracted by the
[1:33:57] church what is it it's a lot it could be
[1:34:00] a lot of things but it's also the
[1:34:02] conflict between Pentecost and the bride
[1:34:06] age every time God makes a transition
[1:34:08] there's
[1:34:09] conflict but now this is
[1:34:12] it this is it so there are those sealed
[1:34:16] under the Pentecost age but you know
[1:34:19] personal opinion those are the folks
[1:34:21] that were back there in time
[1:34:25] so he says again in the message after he
[1:34:27] gives the this preview of The Bride he
[1:34:31] says the seed fell in the ground at NAA
[1:34:33] that was the original seed and she's
[1:34:35] come through the process of these
[1:34:37] denominations which only comes in
[1:34:39] existence once but the bride returns
[1:34:42] back again in the last days I will
[1:34:44] restore see the Masterpiece is brought
[1:34:46] up that's the reason she was in view
[1:34:49] reviewed the second time she was
[1:34:51] reviewed the first time then she was
[1:34:53] reviewed the second time and she was
[1:34:55] perfectly the second time like she was
[1:34:57] the first
[1:34:58] time oh God have mercy hurry hurry hurry
[1:35:02] life get in the grain right
[1:35:05] quick and then he
[1:35:07] preaches a few other sermons that we've
[1:35:09] already went over okay this is actually
[1:35:11] important so recognizing your day and
[1:35:13] its message he says the time of the
[1:35:15] Gentiles has been in this
[1:35:17] Pentecostal Feast so you see how we the
[1:35:20] Pentecostal Feast is is is wrapped up
[1:35:23] you have the feast of the trumpets the
[1:35:24] Feast of atonement Feast of the
[1:35:25] Tabernacles the Jews fit in there as
[1:35:27] well as we fit in there so it's not like
[1:35:29] I said don't have it all figured out
[1:35:30] it's not always chronical logical how we
[1:35:32] think it would
[1:35:33] be he says the seventh is that great
[1:35:36] trumpet as we had last Sunday the sixth
[1:35:38] trumpet sounded under the Sixth Seal
[1:35:40] just like our Sixth Seal open everything
[1:35:43] at the same time only theirs all sounded
[1:35:45] at once where we've been 2,000 years in
[1:35:47] the Pentecostal Feast so that was the
[1:35:50] church ages because there were seven the
[1:35:53] the the seven weeks Pentecost that was
[1:35:55] the Gentile dispensation that was the
[1:35:57] the the church ages but now you have the
[1:36:00] Feast of atonement is the opening of the
[1:36:04] word which also applies to the Jews
[1:36:06] because they received the atonement
[1:36:08] underneath the seventh trumpet I think
[1:36:11] it is
[1:36:13] so take that you like I said you don't
[1:36:16] have everything all the angles figured
[1:36:18] out but it's obvious that this is where
[1:36:20] we are now as as message people as the
[1:36:23] Gentiles
[1:36:24] we're in this it's it's a thin line
[1:36:26] between now and the end of
[1:36:29] time I mean where where are we I mean
[1:36:31] you have all this stuff foolish virgin
[1:36:34] wise virgin that's
[1:36:35] P while they went out to get oil the
[1:36:38] brid grou came we married to Christ on
[1:36:40] this
[1:36:41] side so you know are there still more to
[1:36:43] be saved absolutely are there still wise
[1:36:46] version coming to Christ absolutely so
[1:36:48] you see it's not boom boom boom God
[1:36:51] moves his word I like to say is dynamic
[1:36:54] right it moves so God doesn't have to
[1:36:56] fit our our perfect a b c d e f
[1:37:00] g because he's outside of
[1:37:03] time so praise the
[1:37:07] Lord I like this quotes all thrown in
[1:37:09] here future home of the heav Heavenly
[1:37:11] bridegroom and the Earthly bride notice
[1:37:13] this is still not referred to this
[1:37:15] Millennium Reign the thousand years is
[1:37:17] not the new Earth see the Millennium
[1:37:19] Reign is a different Reign that's what
[1:37:22] we go into the millennium but that isn't
[1:37:24] the new Earth the new heaven no no no
[1:37:27] that's just a rest Place see a rest
[1:37:29] period That's a honeymoon not at all
[1:37:31] that was my words not at all the new
[1:37:32] heavens and new earth for you see in the
[1:37:34] Millennium we have things that would not
[1:37:36] go into that in other words into
[1:37:39] eternity into into beyond the Millennium
[1:37:42] it's a time of a type of the old seventh
[1:37:45] day out of Eden out at Eden the seventh
[1:37:49] day after he made the world the seventh
[1:37:51] day he rested in Eden and the millennium
[1:37:54] so tribulation will happen the Earth
[1:37:57] will get burned but it's not a new
[1:37:59] Heaven or New Earth we'll come back a
[1:38:01] solto will be
[1:38:02] there right we'll come back and we'll
[1:38:04] live here for a thousand years as we
[1:38:06] should have in the beginning we'll work
[1:38:09] with nature we build and all these
[1:38:10] things and we'll live a thousand years
[1:38:12] and a uh and that's a whole another
[1:38:15] sermon but he says again he says now
[1:38:18] remember there is there is Seven Feast
[1:38:20] days and I can feel youall winding down
[1:38:22] so we we'll to wrap this up the Feast of
[1:38:24] the trumpets the Feast of Tabernacles
[1:38:26] the Feast of the she of sheath waving
[1:38:28] there is seven great feast days and that
[1:38:31] was only a type of the seven Church ages
[1:38:34] and you remember how many sabbaths there
[1:38:36] are between one and the other see seven
[1:38:38] sabbaths between Pentecost and the
[1:38:40] trumpets which was the seven Church ages
[1:38:43] and there was seven feast days that
[1:38:44] represent the seven Church ages keep
[1:38:46] your numbers running okay then he goes
[1:38:49] on to talk about the eth day and how
[1:38:50] it's to restart the holy convocation the
[1:38:52] restart he says
[1:38:54] um and and he and and he and I'll put
[1:38:57] this in here with with with with with
[1:38:59] emphasis on on on on go home and search
[1:39:01] this for yourself but he says he says
[1:39:04] right here I'm just going to read the
[1:39:05] quote and then we're going to move
[1:39:06] forward when there is no more time then
[1:39:08] you go into eternity after the seventh
[1:39:10] Church ages is over and it is lther age
[1:39:14] is over Methodist age is over
[1:39:16] Pentecostal age is over now you go into
[1:39:18] what eternity eternity no more sevens no
[1:39:21] more threes no more other there in
[1:39:23] eternity where there is so no such time
[1:39:26] as numbers and times and things so you
[1:39:28] see how easy people can get way off left
[1:39:30] feel and say well we're in the
[1:39:31] millennian
[1:39:32] already but time no longer is a delay
[1:39:35] and he says the bride of Christ has an
[1:39:37] eternal quality yeah so right now being
[1:39:41] a partaker of Christ if you're the word
[1:39:43] in flesh a part of you is eternal that's
[1:39:45] right even though you're bound in this
[1:39:47] earth and bound to this Dimension you
[1:39:50] are walking in eternity I don't know
[1:39:51] about you but every day when I open up
[1:39:53] the word I'm walking in eternity
[1:39:54] Hallelujah you see it's the fullness of
[1:39:56] Christ come down for
[1:39:58] us you don't have the fullness of Christ
[1:40:01] in you because if you did you wouldn't
[1:40:02] be here right you have a measure but
[1:40:06] you're walking in eternity my goodness
[1:40:07] the word opens up to you Revelation
[1:40:10] comes and he stimulates you I mean I'm
[1:40:11] walking in
[1:40:13] eternity see that's why I said it's not
[1:40:15] always exactly Verbatim what we think
[1:40:17] and and and I'm very Analytical in my
[1:40:19] thinking so I have to overcome that when
[1:40:20] I come to this kind of stuff cuz all
[1:40:23] things think well I'm I'm I'm you know
[1:40:24] I'll get get to worrying that I've got
[1:40:26] it all wrong but it's like well just
[1:40:28] read what he
[1:40:29] said and so he says you cross from that
[1:40:32] seventh day into the eth I mean verse
[1:40:35] eight take the book Isaiah verse 8 who
[1:40:38] will go I I'll go send me yeah so eight
[1:40:41] eternity that's the bride's
[1:40:44] Ministry amen okay I think we need to
[1:40:46] move
[1:40:48] forward so he he gets down and he
[1:40:52] preaches it is the rising of the Sun and
[1:40:55] I wanted brother Alex to play uh this
[1:40:57] portion of this quote here
[1:41:00] um if he
[1:41:05] can so there he spoke to me and said the
[1:41:10] Seven Seals will be open the seven
[1:41:13] Mysteries seven F mystery of the Bible
[1:41:16] that's been closed up since the
[1:41:17] foundation of the world will be revealed
[1:41:20] and we get a humble little group
[1:41:22] compared with all the world we've
[1:41:24] enjoyed these Blessings Now hearing
[1:41:28] those Mysteries marriage divorce
[1:41:30] serpentes all these different questions
[1:41:33] has been completely uh revealed to us
[1:41:37] not by man but by God himself let's open
[1:41:40] those seven mysteries of what the church
[1:41:43] was how it was in Christ at the
[1:41:45] beginning and how it would be revealed
[1:41:47] in the last days and now as this went up
[1:41:51] we have the picture outside on the
[1:41:54] plaque but then I have the picture link
[1:41:58] present here if you notice as Life
[1:42:01] Magazine had it but I wonder if my
[1:42:06] audience visible here has ever really
[1:42:09] looked at the picture see see and the
[1:42:13] way it should be you remember I was
[1:42:16] preaching when this Vision Came Upon the
[1:42:20] subject of the book of the revelation
[1:42:23] were the old judges or we've seen Jesus
[1:42:27] in Revelations 1 when we started to open
[1:42:30] the Seven Seals of the or the church
[1:42:32] ages
[1:42:33] rather just prior to the opening of the
[1:42:36] seventh seal Christ was standing with
[1:42:39] hair like wool white and I describ that
[1:42:44] to you that the old English judges and
[1:42:46] judges of long ago when they went to the
[1:42:49] bench to be sworn in their supreme
[1:42:52] authority was given them they wore a
[1:42:55] white wig as it was over their heads to
[1:42:58] show their supreme
[1:43:00] authority well if you'll turn the
[1:43:03] picture like this and look you probably
[1:43:05] see it from the
[1:43:06] audience it's Christ see his eyes
[1:43:10] looking here just as perfect as it could
[1:43:12] be wearing the white wig of supreme
[1:43:16] deity and judge of all heavens and earth
[1:43:20] can you see his eyes no his mouth just
[1:43:23] turned the picture from this way they
[1:43:25] had it this way the way it's supposed to
[1:43:27] be and can you see
[1:43:30] it he is supreme judge there's none
[1:43:33] other but him and that is a perfect
[1:43:38] identification again a
[1:43:41] Vindication this message is the
[1:43:44] truth it is and making him not a third
[1:43:49] person but the only person with a white
[1:43:53] see you see the dark his face his beard
[1:43:55] his eyes and notice he's looking from
[1:43:58] him comes this light shining on the
[1:44:02] right hand side to which he's looking to
[1:44:04] on the cross that's where he looked to
[1:44:06] the right where he Pardon The
[1:44:10] Sinner in the light of his resurrection
[1:44:14] we still go forth in his
[1:44:17] name in that sermon that's the first
[1:44:20] time he tells them turn the picture that
[1:44:23] I can find and it is the sermon it is
[1:44:25] the rising of the
[1:44:27] sun you see what Pentecost missed they
[1:44:31] missed the coming of
[1:44:33] Christ where we are today Christ came he
[1:44:37] had his picture
[1:44:40] taken perfectly and and and brother bham
[1:44:43] talks about it and you hear him say like
[1:44:44] a pyramid because he's got it the wrong
[1:44:47] way in different sermons he'll talk
[1:44:49] about look at the cloud look at the
[1:44:50] cloud and then he preaches it is rising
[1:44:51] in the sun he says turn
[1:44:53] he says it's
[1:44:56] Christ and this comes in in succession
[1:44:59] to all of these all of
[1:45:01] these sermons here now this day the
[1:45:04] scriptures fulfill the wedding ceremony
[1:45:06] who this MZ it is the rising of the
[1:45:13] sun that's where we are today saints of
[1:45:17] God I had another quote here I don't
[1:45:19] know where it went
[1:45:27] maybe I didn't see
[1:45:33] it well I must not have needed
[1:45:39] it

[1:48:21] closed one and he moved into the next
