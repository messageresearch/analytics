[31:35] charge yourself up and if it wasn't for
[31:38] wednesday nights you imagine how long a
[31:40] week could be
[31:42] amen and but but god just comes and
[31:45] and and he moves and you know i i
[31:48] i was really really just
[31:52] feeling to have brother david or brother
[31:53] chris take the service tonight
[31:56] and the longer i fought on
[31:59] last week's thought and that i wanted to
[32:02] bring it forward i finally i was like i
[32:04] just have to do this so
[32:06] anyway uh let's just stand and
[32:09] and god bless you to our visitors i
[32:11] trust that you have a
[32:12] a good time we just uh home folks here

[32:16] amen just serve the lord with all of our
[32:18] heart
[32:19] i want to uh uh you know sometimes it's
[32:22] amazing you have a thought it just burns
[32:24] you up
[32:25] you study it you get excited i've
[32:26] preached it to sister jerry uh
[32:29] you know at the dinner table i've
[32:31] preached it to her in the bedroom i've
[32:33] preached it to her in the car
[32:34] and and you just get all burned up and i
[32:36] thought i don't even have a title i
[32:38] don't even know what to call this
[32:40] but um i just decided you know this is
[32:43] part of this
[32:44] uh proverbs 22 it's part of this
[32:46] training
[32:47] so we're just gonna uh we just put the
[32:49] lifelong training part two
[32:51] uh on this and and i trust that tonight
[32:54] uh we would take this
[32:56] and and i have a little notation in my
[32:58] notes uh
[32:59] that um you know we know the natural and
[33:01] spiritual parallel each other
[33:04] and so feel free tonight to just uh
[33:06] don't think i'm preaching carnally
[33:09] pull that over into the spiritual and if
[33:11] something in your natural life applies
[33:13] pull it right out of that spiritual
[33:16] you know into the natural and uh i just
[33:18] prayed be a blessing to you tonight
[33:21] just like to go to proverbs the 22nd
[33:23] chapter
[33:24] uh verses one through seven and uh
[33:27] we will then uh take our thought
[33:30] from the seventh verse tonight
[33:34] a good name is rather to be chosen than
[33:36] great riches
[33:38] and loving favor rather than
[33:41] silver and gold the rich and poor meet
[33:44] together
[33:45] the lord is the maker of them all
[33:48] i i really like verse two to realize if
[33:51] we have been fortunate in our life
[33:53] to acquire some assets acquire some
[33:56] things
[33:57] it doesn't matter we are just sons and
[34:00] daughters of god
[34:01] it doesn't make us special it doesn't
[34:03] make us any more valuable
[34:05] we are the lords amen a prudent man
[34:09] foreseeth the evil and hideth
[34:12] himself but the simple pass on
[34:15] and are punished by humility and the
[34:18] fear of the lord are riches
[34:20] and honor and life thorns and snares are
[34:23] in the way of the froward
[34:26] he that doth keep his soul shall be far
[34:29] from them train up a child
[34:32] in the way he should go and when he is
[34:35] old
[34:36] he will not depart from it the rich
[34:40] ruleth over the poor and the borrower
[34:45] is servant to the lender we ask you
[34:48] father just to come tonight
[34:51] just open our eyes our hearts
[34:54] lord we didn't come here to see one
[34:56] another we come tonight lord to see you
[35:00] and lord we know that we can meet you
[35:03] anywhere but father there's just
[35:07] something special
[35:09] according to your word father that we
[35:10] would not forsake the assembling of
[35:12] ourselves together there's just
[35:13] something special
[35:15] to come together with saints of like
[35:17] precious faith
[35:18] and as was spoken tonight lord our licks
[35:21] of fire coming together
[35:23] lord to just enjoy the presence of the
[35:26] lord enjoy
[35:27] one another's company we just ask you
[35:30] for your blessings tonight
[35:32] help us father as we speak your word in
[35:34] your name we pray
[35:35] amen you may be seated
[35:44] you know as we were speaking last
[35:46] wednesday on
[35:47] the impact of training to train up a
[35:50] child
[35:50] and it would be the impact of training
[35:53] or the lack of
[35:54] and it's lasting effect to realize that
[35:57] we can
[35:58] uh leave an influence as it were on our
[36:01] children
[36:02] uh that will be there for their whole
[36:05] life and
[36:06] you know it is there that in this impact
[36:09] of
[36:09] training or the lack of we can look at
[36:11] disciplined we see a
[36:13] unruly generation we see a
[36:16] children according to the scripture said
[36:19] it would be this way that they would
[36:21] lose all respect and certainly we can
[36:24] look out in the world we live in today
[36:26] and
[36:27] and do that but you know it's kind of
[36:28] interesting i i don't want to delve into
[36:30] politics tonight but just to make a
[36:32] point
[36:33] that my brother and sister have you
[36:34] noticed that the spirit of rebellion
[36:36] knows no age
[36:38] so we have people in our government
[36:40] right now that are
[36:41] you know uh speaking out you know burn
[36:44] the cities down and they deserve it do
[36:46] all of this stuff
[36:47] and that spirit of rebellion you know is
[36:49] not something that's just locked into
[36:51] the young people but it has been there
[36:54] and
[36:54] fostered uh through the years it's been
[36:57] trained up in that way and
[36:58] and we're seeing those kind of spirits
[37:00] now we know in the end time which is the
[37:02] harvest time
[37:04] that uh the uh terrors and the wheat uh
[37:07] then becomes separated so we see the
[37:09] same spirit of rebellion comes down
[37:11] into the church and has its effect upon
[37:14] that and
[37:15] my brother and sister it is there that
[37:17] you realize that
[37:18] um it is the training of that or the
[37:21] lack of that has that effect
[37:23] now you look at that and i just want to
[37:25] focus tonight
[37:26] and uh i hope i don't step on anybody's
[37:28] toes forgive me if i do but these are
[37:30] just the things that were on my heart
[37:32] and
[37:33] you look at this and you'll find that
[37:34] certain behaviors pass through
[37:36] a family line they might be you know
[37:38] we're not talking about i'm right
[37:40] irish so i have a temper but we're
[37:42] talking about how
[37:43] that in certain families uh that we do
[37:46] certain things now i hope you find this
[37:47] humorous and not offensive to be spoken
[37:49] tonight
[37:50] but the little story about you know the
[37:52] mothers cutting the end off the roast to
[37:54] fit it in the pan and
[37:55] you know and then there her daughter
[37:58] says mom why do you do that she said i
[38:00] don't know you know i learned that from
[38:01] your grandmother and
[38:02] they got curious and they call
[38:03] grandmother and grandmother says well
[38:06] my mother always did it and so great
[38:08] grandma was still alive they call her
[38:11] and she says oh we always cut the end
[38:13] off the roast because the pan was too
[38:14] small
[38:15] and so you see how that those things
[38:17] come down in and are
[38:18] passed into generation without even
[38:21] having a reason why
[38:22] and so little things are done now don't
[38:25] want to step on nobody's toes
[38:26] but you'll notice many times that when
[38:29] it comes to financial matters where
[38:31] we're looking right here in verse seven
[38:32] in just a minute
[38:34] we're looking in financial matters and
[38:35] you'll find that when a family is is a
[38:38] very
[38:39] astute in their finances that typically
[38:42] they pass that down to their children
[38:44] and their children will follow those
[38:46] same guidelines because that is
[38:48] their normal so if a family is a hyper
[38:52] uh in that you will find that while they
[38:55] might
[38:56] almost live like paupers they'll have a
[38:58] lot of money in the bank never enjoy
[39:00] their life and
[39:01] and not really how to enjoy as a
[39:03] scripture says the fruit of their labors
[39:06] and then you will find on the other side
[39:08] of those and we'll talk on it tonight
[39:10] a little more extensively in a bit but
[39:13] you'll find those that have the idea
[39:15] that you know it doesn't matter i can
[39:18] always take care of that tomorrow
[39:20] and uh you know they're the ones that
[39:22] are always broken they're not thinking
[39:24] about saving they're just thinking about
[39:26] making their credit card payment
[39:28] and even then it becomes burdensome or
[39:30] worrisome to them
[39:32] and you'll find that these kind of
[39:33] behaviors typically are then
[39:35] passed down in a family because the
[39:38] children grow up
[39:39] and living hand to mouth or as my dad
[39:42] you know growing up on a dairy farm my
[39:44] dad used to say hoof to mouth
[39:45] but anyway um growing up hand-to-mouth
[39:49] is completely normal it's just what you
[39:51] do this is how people live
[39:53] you know always struggling to pay the
[39:55] next bill the
[39:56] the mortgage or the rent or the car
[39:58] payment to put groceries on the table
[40:01] and many times people say well if i just
[40:03] have more money but you see the behavior
[40:05] would dictate that no matter how much
[40:07] money they have it will never be
[40:09] sufficient
[40:10] and so what we want as christians is to
[40:13] find
[40:13] balance in our life and you look at that
[40:16] in natural
[40:16] uh types spiritual and you can find my
[40:19] brother and sister
[40:20] that if we go too far on the one side
[40:23] we'll just say well you know hey
[40:25] we believe in predestination it's in the
[40:27] bible and so therefore if our kids are
[40:29] going to be saved god will just take
[40:31] care of that
[40:31] and then we go on the other side which
[40:33] is the hyper side
[40:35] and you know if your child ever does one
[40:38] thing wrong
[40:39] you know you're bent out of shape over
[40:41] it because they're going to miss the
[40:42] rapture
[40:43] my brother and sister what we strive for
[40:45] is the middle of the road we strive for
[40:47] balance in our life
[40:49] that we can come and realize by god's
[40:51] grace
[40:52] amen that we're going to make it amen by
[40:54] god's mercies
[40:56] we are going to find the word is
[40:58] sufficient for our day
[41:00] and his grace is sufficient for our
[41:02] lives
[41:03] and then we can move forward knowing
[41:05] that if we make a mistake
[41:06] the blood is there for us and so it's
[41:09] there that we'll look at this and
[41:11] while we'll be talking in a financial
[41:14] lingo you might say tonight for
[41:16] a while i want you to draw those over
[41:18] back and forth to
[41:20] to see that because you see the natural
[41:22] and the spiritual run in parallel lines
[41:25] and
[41:25] so i want you to just feel free if you
[41:27] you see something
[41:28] just go ahead and pull it over because
[41:30] we're not here as it is some kind of
[41:33] financial seminar
[41:34] because you'll see my brother and sister
[41:36] that often times
[41:38] when we find ourselves unable to cope
[41:40] financially
[41:41] there comes a desperation there comes a
[41:44] behavior
[41:45] comes patterns that creep in there will
[41:47] be things that will
[41:48] you would do or things that you will
[41:50] react to
[41:51] that if you didn't have that pressure in
[41:53] your life you would not
[41:55] and so it's there that often times satan
[41:58] bases
[41:59] to come into a position where we say
[42:01] well it's not how much it costs or how
[42:03] long to pay for it
[42:04] but how big is the payment and uh i i
[42:08] just
[42:08] encourage you as your friend your
[42:10] brother in christ to
[42:11] never allow yourself to get caught into
[42:14] what is the payment
[42:15] be good stewards of what god has given
[42:17] you and my brother and sister if the car
[42:20] starts and it drives it doesn't matter
[42:22] about what it looks like or what someone
[42:24] else thinks of you
[42:26] save up your money pay cash for it amen
[42:29] because
[42:30] then you can enjoy what you have amen
[42:33] now if you disagree with me that's fine
[42:35] we still love one another
[42:36] amen so you look at this and and find
[42:39] that these
[42:40] these uh behaviors now the scripture
[42:44] says that a borrower is servant now
[42:47] a servant my brother and sister is in
[42:49] the root of this
[42:51] a servant is a person or something in
[42:54] a subservient position in other words a
[42:57] lower position
[42:58] and so it is a position that is left to
[43:02] be dictated by another and certainly we
[43:05] know as christians that we look at the
[43:07] word of god and realize
[43:08] how if left alone in this world that we
[43:12] would be
[43:13] subservient to the devil we would be
[43:15] subservient to
[43:16] satan's plan for the age and so we would
[43:19] look at that because you see born in sin
[43:21] shaped in iniquity we come speaking lies
[43:24] all the behavior
[43:25] of the carnal and you look at that my
[43:27] brother and sister and we will find
[43:29] ourselves in debt
[43:33] and so by god's grace isn't it so
[43:36] beautiful
[43:37] the debt was paid we have no
[43:41] no reason to accept
[43:45] satan's verdict for our life
[43:48] now my brother and sister we would be
[43:51] left in a position dictated by another
[43:53] and
[43:54] and while i'm preaching this to you so
[43:55] that no one will think that i'm i'm
[43:57] trying to take another deal uh every
[43:59] year
[44:00] uh we borrow a very substantial amount
[44:03] of money to balance out or buffer the
[44:05] farm
[44:05] uh money coming and going and uh sister
[44:08] jerry will tell you
[44:10] that the minute i sign my name to that
[44:12] paper i'm stressed out
[44:15] it's the minute that i have committed to
[44:17] that that i feel
[44:19] a pressure are you with me
[44:22] and so it might be the mortgage it might
[44:24] be a car payment whatever it might be
[44:26] but you see there is a certain pressure
[44:28] that comes with that and knowing that i
[44:31] now
[44:31] am indebted or obligated to repay that
[44:35] and so what we do and i'm going to speak
[44:38] from a personal side here i hope some of
[44:40] you
[44:40] i hope most of you i hope all of you
[44:43] don't have this problem
[44:44] but you see when you borrow in the
[44:46] natural
[44:47] you commit your resources to repay that
[44:51] now if you uh uh don't feel sorry for me
[44:55] i i willingly did this in half for
[44:57] 30 years but you know it isn't that you
[45:00] go and sign your farm loan
[45:02] that you just committed a little
[45:04] something
[45:05] we literally sign our name and say
[45:07] everything we
[45:08] own will now back that up
[45:12] maybe with a car you know they would
[45:14] come and take your car maybe with a
[45:15] house they would come and take your
[45:17] house
[45:17] but you see we're and i hope you catch
[45:20] the spiritual side of this
[45:21] when we uh get caught up in this debt
[45:25] it is everything that you are
[45:28] committed to that so the devil doesn't
[45:31] come along and say you know i'm just
[45:33] going to take this little something from
[45:35] you
[45:35] i'm going to take this little something
[45:37] from you he wants you
[45:38] he wants to be able to take the paper as
[45:42] it were
[45:43] serve it on you and lay claim to you now
[45:46] we think my brother and sister
[45:48] how it is through the scripture we have
[45:50] such beautiful examples
[45:52] and you know when one would come and and
[45:54] we would see
[45:55] how that one says you know what uh
[45:57] you're a closer a nearer kinsman than
[46:00] i and so do you want to redeem and he
[46:02] says you know
[46:03] i'm not going to redeem this unless it
[46:06] would
[46:06] mar my own inheritance and i can here to
[46:09] tell you tonight
[46:10] that satan would not go to calvary to be
[46:13] your
[46:14] savior because he knew what beyond a
[46:17] doubt
[46:18] that if he laid his life down he could
[46:21] not raise it back up
[46:22] so he's not going to mar his inheritance
[46:26] to pay your debt but praise the lord
[46:29] aren't you glad tonight our lord jesus
[46:31] said i know who i am
[46:33] i know what i was called to do and i
[46:35] will lay my life down
[46:37] and it will raise again amen so
[46:40] that position was not dictated by the
[46:42] devil
[46:43] now you imagine all the minions of the
[46:45] devil must have been so disappointed
[46:47] on the third day when our lord jesus
[46:49] rose and they had been having their
[46:51] victory dance their celebration
[46:54] they thought we have finally won but
[46:56] when he was there
[46:57] took those keys went down there to death
[46:59] hell in the grave
[47:00] and come back a conqueror they must have
[47:03] said what is
[47:04] wrong with our plan and i'm my brother
[47:06] and sister
[47:07] i'm firmly believe it's this is kind of
[47:09] irrelevant
[47:10] but i firmly believe amongst the legions
[47:13] of the demons that satan has
[47:15] there are some that are already
[47:16] committed to the idea they're defeated
[47:19] because at everything through history
[47:22] that they have
[47:23] approached everything that they have
[47:24] done every time they come in contact
[47:26] with a son or daughter of god
[47:28] amen and they come in the experience of
[47:30] the holy spirit
[47:32] they find themselves defeated they say
[47:34] well i've got a grip on them i've
[47:36] knocked them down i'm going to do that
[47:38] but the lord lifts us up hallelujah so
[47:42] it's not about flesh and blood
[47:43] but it's about principalities and powers
[47:45] and we're on the winning side
[47:47] amen so you look at that we have to
[47:50] commit
[47:51] our resources to the promise of repaying
[47:54] now if you look at that
[47:55] in the natural makes perfectly good
[47:57] sense but you look at that my brother
[47:59] and sister if we're not careful
[48:01] there's certainly many religions that
[48:02] hold on to this that we have a
[48:04] debt we must pay and so therefore we're
[48:07] going to have a works gospel we're going
[48:09] to do
[48:10] all of these things well i'm here to
[48:12] tell you tonight that we cannot
[48:14] repay that debt it is impossible for you
[48:17] and i to repay that debt
[48:19] and god would not put that obligation i
[48:22] serve god tonight you serve god tonight
[48:25] because you love him
[48:27] anything short of that you'll give up
[48:30] everything short of that you'll say just
[48:31] repossess it i'm not making no more
[48:33] payments
[48:34] but the love that god places down in the
[48:37] heart of sons and daughters of god
[48:39] is not a debt i must pay him back but it
[48:42] is something that is swelling
[48:44] welling up from within us that we just
[48:48] love our lord and it is because he loved
[48:50] us
[48:51] when we were unlovable but it really
[48:53] even transcends that
[48:55] it goes that there's just simply
[48:57] something in us
[48:58] that wants to love him back amen you
[49:01] know you think about the human
[49:02] relationship huh
[49:03] and i'm just going to call it the love
[49:05] affair i hope you don't mind the term of
[49:07] that
[49:07] but my brother and sister you'll find
[49:09] that it is there that you go through
[49:11] life and you meet that one special lady
[49:13] or that one special man
[49:15] you're not gonna say well i know that
[49:16] there is uh according to science and
[49:19] psychology
[49:20] there will be literally hundreds of
[49:21] people with this personality traits
[49:24] and look like this so i'll just search
[49:25] the world till i find one of them
[49:27] no sir there's something in you that
[49:29] meets this individual
[49:30] and you know this is the one and you
[49:33] love
[49:34] them amen you don't say well we'll go
[49:36] through life and
[49:37] and you know i hope you have a sense of
[49:39] humor tonight
[49:40] we'll see how well she works out as a
[49:42] farm wife we'll
[49:43] see how well she does this we'll see how
[49:45] well she does that
[49:46] no you love her you just simply love her
[49:49] you you simply
[49:50] i have something inside of you that is
[49:53] almost as though something in you
[49:55] reached out you can't see it it's not
[49:58] tangible you can't grab it but it
[50:00] reached out and it got a horse of their
[50:02] heart and they reached out and got a
[50:03] holst of your heart
[50:04] and it's unbreakable that is the very
[50:07] type
[50:07] of sons and daughters of god the bride
[50:09] of jesus christ
[50:10] the world might look at that and say i
[50:12] don't understand these christians
[50:14] but my brother and sister without that
[50:16] relationship they can't
[50:18] understand you the scripture says that
[50:22] without the holy ghost we cannot call
[50:23] him the christ
[50:25] so that relationship has to already be
[50:27] fostered
[50:28] it already has to be in place and it's
[50:31] there
[50:32] well my brother and sister if the world
[50:33] can't see it the world can't find it the
[50:35] world can't understand it the world
[50:37] can't sever it
[50:49] praise god we were born hallelujah
[50:54] hallelujah now look at this
[50:59] the scripture shows us now when i make
[51:01] this statement my brother and sister
[51:03] i hope you don't mind but there is not a
[51:06] particular scripture that says
[51:08] this but it is the context of literally
[51:10] hundreds of scriptures
[51:12] the scripture shows us not to borrow of
[51:15] this world's
[51:16] vain glory in other words there's
[51:19] nothing out here
[51:20] when we're living our life and you say
[51:22] well i need a little something in my
[51:24] life
[51:25] there's nothing out here in this world
[51:28] for a son or daughter of god to say i'll
[51:30] indebt myself
[51:31] to this world to this age out here to
[51:34] the circumstance of this i'll indebt
[51:36] myself
[51:36] to have this now i'm not talking about
[51:38] having a house mortgage and those kind
[51:40] of things
[51:40] i'm talking about more in the spiritual
[51:43] and moral realm
[51:44] amen so you look at this there's nothing
[51:46] that the world
[51:47] has that we should indebt ourselves to
[51:49] that
[51:50] because all of that is vanity now just
[51:54] uh you want to
[51:55] kind of study that just go back in your
[51:56] bible reference that
[51:58] and vanity appears many many times in
[52:01] the bible
[52:01] and my brother and sister it shows us
[52:04] that everything
[52:05] that is in this world that is borrowed
[52:08] from
[52:08] this world you say well brother paul i
[52:11] work for this corporation and
[52:13] i this and i this and i this my brother
[52:15] and sister the word of god says he
[52:16] provides for you
[52:19] so i don't know who we'll name well
[52:20] we'll just name micron up here
[52:22] nobody likes micron so
[52:27] micron doesn't provide for sons and
[52:28] daughters of god
[52:30] god provides for sons and daughters of
[52:32] god
[52:33] god anoints companies like micron to pay
[52:36] good wages
[52:37] for a talent that god gave an individual
[52:40] and so it all comes down to god
[52:43] hallelujah
[52:44] so you look at that amen so we won't
[52:46] commit our resource to repaying
[52:48] something that we borrowed from this
[52:50] world's vainglory can we can we agree
[52:52] with that
[52:53] amen because you see everything borrowed
[52:55] from this world
[52:57] must be repaid with interest
[53:02] i was raised
[53:07] under the philosophy i guess you would
[53:10] say
[53:10] my dad reminded me of it plenty of times
[53:14] son there is no free lunch
[53:20] well you know i wondered now where'd my
[53:21] dad get that idea obviously i could
[53:23] embrace it growing up i started to
[53:25] figure that out
[53:26] when somebody comes around fertilizer
[53:28] salesman equipment salesman he gives you
[53:30] a coat he gives you a hat he takes you
[53:32] to lunch
[53:33] he's expecting somehow to influence you
[53:35] and he plans on getting that back many
[53:37] times over
[53:43] but you know that's just kind of our
[53:46] thoughts
[53:48] and then one day your eyes are opened
[53:49] and you look at that and the scripture
[53:51] says the wages
[53:53] of sin
[54:02] and while i won't try to pin it down to
[54:04] one single scripture concerning
[54:06] salvation
[54:08] all through the bible it shows us
[54:11] that a life lived for christ the payment
[54:15] is eternal life no free lunch
[54:20] no free lunch whatever side of the
[54:22] equation we're on no free lunch
[54:25] now it is fun if you don't mind a moment
[54:26] of humor it is fun when
[54:28] you know you uh deal with someone and
[54:31] they start to butter you up you
[54:32] understand that term right
[54:34] they start they give you notebooks and
[54:36] they give you hats and they give you
[54:37] coats and they take you to lunch
[54:39] and then after they throw their whole
[54:40] presentation out you look them in the
[54:42] face in the kindest of words and say
[54:44] do you realize your prices are about
[54:46] seven percent too high
[54:50] and they like
[54:56] i wonder how many people look the devil
[54:58] in the face one day
[55:01] had the courage to tell them the price
[55:05] for your service the price for what you
[55:08] gave me
[55:10] is too high
[55:14] i think there'll be millions
[55:17] but do you think my brother and sister
[55:19] now with this you know image that we've
[55:21] kind of all grown up and we talk about
[55:23] we're going to get to the pearly gates
[55:26] and we're going to be standing there and
[55:28] saint peter's going to read your name
[55:29] and invite you into glory
[55:31] and you're going to stop just as you're
[55:33] going to pass through the gates and
[55:35] you're going to stop and say say peter
[55:36] can i say something to you
[55:39] sure i just wanted to tell you the price
[55:42] of admission is too high no one
[55:49] no one ever but it's a pretty high price
[55:52] as a christian isn't it all
[55:55] only because the devil presents it as
[55:58] something that should be simpler
[56:02] when we get anointed by the holy ghost
[56:04] saints come on you're with me aren't you
[56:06] when we get anointed by the holy ghost
[56:08] under that anointing no price is too
[56:10] high for eternal life
[56:12] it's only when the devil gets to put his
[56:14] sales pitch in there
[56:16] this price is too high you ought not
[56:18] have to do this look you ought to be
[56:19] able to go
[56:20] live this life and do this and still be
[56:22] a christian
[56:24] sorry you get out from underneath that
[56:27] anointing
[56:28] and the life righteousness holiness
[56:31] perfection in christ we don't value we
[56:34] don't look at that and say that's too
[56:35] high
[56:37] we say you know what that's a prize and
[56:39] i'm going to press to the mark
[56:41] i'm going to press to that i'm claiming
[56:43] that hallelujah aren't you glad
[56:46] amen because remember everything that is
[56:49] in this world must be repaid with
[56:51] interest
[56:52] and remember that our debt was done as
[56:55] it were free gratis from jesus christ to
[56:57] you and i
[56:58] that we could never even remotely repay
[57:01] that
[57:02] and he'll never ask you to and there
[57:04] again i want to reiterate
[57:06] that it is because we love him that we
[57:09] live this life that we live the word out
[57:12] hallelujah now i want to take this in a
[57:15] little different
[57:16] think about these quotations right here
[57:19] 1965 january the 20th 1965
[57:23] and this could have been spoken
[57:24] yesterday and be just as accurate
[57:26] it says now if we're on the gold
[57:28] standard and we are broke
[57:30] now think about this my brother and
[57:32] sister don't want to bust anybody's
[57:33] bubble
[57:34] but you know they have figured out that
[57:36] this stimulus check that you received in
[57:39] the mail
[57:40] is going to cost the american taxpayer
[57:43] somewhere in the region of 15 to 17
[57:45] 000 for the 1400 they gave you
[57:52] no free lunch
[57:58] now we know what the book of revelation
[58:00] says right
[58:02] so we can look at this now we're on the
[58:05] gold standard and we are broke now what
[58:08] is
[58:08] going to happen what is going to happen
[58:10] you know the rich people of this nation
[58:12] these big factories and whisky men and
[58:13] tobacco men and so forth like that
[58:15] is not going to stand to change the
[58:17] currency
[58:19] if you wonder what changing of the
[58:20] currency does just go back and study the
[58:22] history of argentina
[58:24] cuba et cetera it takes countries that
[58:27] were once prosperous
[58:28] and throws them into the chaos of
[58:30] poverty except for the select few
[58:35] the only thing we have to do is borrow
[58:39] it
[58:43] now i want you to follow see this this
[58:47] this goes
[58:50] it's just amazing i've got a half a
[58:52] million bucks
[58:54] with just a little bit of ink out of a
[58:56] bic ink pen
[59:01] and our country produced trillions of
[59:03] dollars
[59:05] on just a little bit of ink on some
[59:06] paper
[59:11] somebody's going to pay that bill
[59:15] see only thing we'll do is borrow it
[59:18] there's only one place we can borrow it
[59:20] and when we do we sell our birthrights
[59:22] out to it that's right
[59:24] that's what you're going to do you're
[59:25] owned by it that system
[59:28] there is nothing else you can do our
[59:30] bible tells us they'll come a day you
[59:32] won't buy or sell without being part of
[59:34] the system
[59:35] now look how that is the child training
[59:37] if you follow me
[59:38] that they're now presenting this idea
[59:40] that you'll need a passport to fly
[59:43] and someone said well that's not going
[59:45] to be sufficient we should make it that
[59:47] you would need a vaccine passport to go
[59:49] from state
[59:50] to state what will you do
[59:53] when they start off with you'll need a
[59:55] vaccine passport to go in the grocery
[59:59] you see my brother and sister what it is
[1:00:02] the child
[1:00:03] meaning the people is being trained
[1:00:06] that will come to the place i'm not
[1:00:08] talking about the bride of christ but
[1:00:10] i'm just giving you just a little
[1:00:11] glimpse of it
[1:00:12] they're being trained to accept the idea
[1:00:17] this is normal we have to protect
[1:00:19] ourselves now have you noticed my
[1:00:21] brother and sister this even is coming
[1:00:23] to the church
[1:00:24] that if you notice that people have an
[1:00:26] inordinate amount
[1:00:28] of fear
[1:00:32] even though jesus said fear not
[1:00:38] they're telling them look you didn't
[1:00:40] know what you was talking about there's
[1:00:41] a lot to fear in the day we live
[1:00:43] no my brother and sister if we get into
[1:00:45] the spirit of christ the holy ghost
[1:00:47] you will recognize that fear just fades
[1:00:50] away
[1:00:51] because you know that nothing can happen
[1:00:54] to you but what god
[1:00:56] allows it to happen oh some people say
[1:00:59] you're taking that too far there's
[1:01:00] accidents all the time is there
[1:01:06] we give the term accident
[1:01:13] i know i'm speaking to the choir but
[1:01:14] god's either in control or he's not
[1:01:18] and if we can come to the place that we
[1:01:20] believe god is not
[1:01:21] in control there is nothing
[1:01:24] that we can trust nothing
[1:01:28] we can trust saints
[1:01:31] do you know if i have my facts right you
[1:01:33] might look it up and find out i'm wrong
[1:01:35] but i believe i read this where
[1:01:37] more people are struck by lightning and
[1:01:38] clear skies than they are
[1:01:41] when there's thunder heads and whatever
[1:01:45] i think you guys need to be careful only
[1:01:47] go out on cloudy days
[1:01:51] because the odds are against you
[1:01:55] you see as sons and daughters of god
[1:01:57] we're not ruled by that spirit
[1:02:00] we are ruled by the fact that we are
[1:02:02] christ and christ is ours
[1:02:04] and he is in complete control and we'll
[1:02:07] stand on his word and whatever his word
[1:02:09] said
[1:02:10] we support that 100 percent
[1:02:13] amen but you see what's happening let me
[1:02:15] get back to this so we can move on
[1:02:17] what happens is the system
[1:02:21] my brother and sister the system they're
[1:02:22] already saying maybe we should put
[1:02:24] something in place retroactive that
[1:02:26] people who receive stimulus
[1:02:28] whenever they make over certain amounts
[1:02:29] of income that we should retrieve that
[1:02:31] from them
[1:02:31] are they going to retrieve 1400 or 17
[1:02:34] 000.
[1:02:41] i hope you're catching this right
[1:02:45] well you know what i mean you guys
[1:02:46] believe in degrees of sin right
[1:02:51] right we don't believe in degrees of sin
[1:02:54] the wages of sin is
[1:02:57] probation
[1:03:01] a fine community service no sir
[1:03:04] the wages of sin is death
[1:03:08] very simple very simple so what's
[1:03:11] happening
[1:03:12] do you see my brother and sister i'm not
[1:03:14] a conspiracy theorist i'm a bible
[1:03:16] that's right i'm a bible would it be
[1:03:18] okay to use the word bible theorist no
[1:03:20] that don't sound right
[1:03:22] because it's not theory you understand
[1:03:26] what i'm saying a bible believer where's
[1:03:27] the settlement that i'm a bible believer
[1:03:30] the bible my brother and sister shows us
[1:03:33] clearly
[1:03:34] it's not a battle of flesh and blood
[1:03:37] this isn't not about the the politics
[1:03:40] the governments the
[1:03:41] the sides of the thing my brother and
[1:03:43] sister what they're looking for
[1:03:45] is your birthright they are going to get
[1:03:49] men and women's birthright by forfeiture
[1:03:54] we were joking today it was amazing when
[1:03:56] the stimulus another man
[1:03:58] brought this up he said you know it's
[1:04:00] amazing when the stimulus check come out
[1:04:02] we went into costco and all the
[1:04:03] televisions were on sale
[1:04:09] and they were priced right there where
[1:04:10] you could afford one
[1:04:14] what are they doing
[1:04:17] putting clothes and food and medical
[1:04:20] no no no they're they're just taking and
[1:04:23] the money is passing right through you
[1:04:26] and not you i hope not you
[1:04:30] please say it's not you passed right
[1:04:33] through you
[1:04:34] and where did it go right to a big
[1:04:36] corporation
[1:04:38] the very people that's the big factories
[1:04:41] the whiskey and the tobacco men and etc
[1:04:44] the money's just passing right through
[1:04:45] you
[1:04:46] it was the way the government could hand
[1:04:47] the money to them
[1:04:51] and yet you won't revolt because you had
[1:04:53] your chance
[1:04:58] i hope you catch the spiritual
[1:05:00] ramification
[1:05:01] we don't really have time tonight to
[1:05:04] really go into that
[1:05:05] so what happened when people fall into
[1:05:08] the system when the birthright sells out
[1:05:10] and we can go right back in our bibles
[1:05:12] and study the birthright right jacob and
[1:05:14] esau
[1:05:14] we can see the birthright some people
[1:05:16] want the birthright so much my brother
[1:05:18] and sister
[1:05:18] as it was in the type of jacob that
[1:05:21] they're willing to
[1:05:22] resort to different things and the bride
[1:05:24] of jesus christ put such a value on this
[1:05:27] birthright that god has given her
[1:05:29] she will not sell it out for the things
[1:05:31] of this world right here
[1:05:33] she's not willing to give it up for her
[1:05:35] uh you know
[1:05:36] bowl of porridge she won't do that now
[1:05:39] look
[1:05:40] any time that you uh are are dealing any
[1:05:42] time
[1:05:43] that you uh are a borrower you'll find
[1:05:46] yourself in a relationship
[1:05:48] i'm not being too clinical tonight am i
[1:05:52] you'll find yourself in a relationship
[1:05:54] my brother and sister whether you're
[1:05:56] talking about just at the counter down
[1:05:58] here and you've got a little
[1:05:59] a line of credit with your your bank or
[1:06:01] you've got a little
[1:06:03] heloc on your mortgage and or whatever
[1:06:05] you've got you you're building a
[1:06:07] relationship
[1:06:08] and and they want to know every once in
[1:06:10] a while how are you doing
[1:06:13] they might might just kind of subtly
[1:06:15] they'll they'll follow your bank
[1:06:16] balances they'll follow your credit
[1:06:18] report
[1:06:19] they'll follow these things because
[1:06:21] they're in a relationship with you
[1:06:23] amen and so it says my brother and
[1:06:26] sister as we do
[1:06:27] while we are not wanting to borrow of
[1:06:30] this world's vain glory
[1:06:32] have you ever seen much i was talking to
[1:06:34] a man the other day sorry if i throw in
[1:06:36] this personal
[1:06:37] thing but i was talking to a man the
[1:06:38] other day he drove a nice pickup
[1:06:40] and uh he had a 750 dollar a month
[1:06:44] payment
[1:06:45] on the pickup and then he'd went out and
[1:06:47] spent about five thousand dollars on
[1:06:49] rims and tires
[1:06:50] another couple thousand dollars on on
[1:06:52] his uh
[1:06:53] exhaust system and uh he's sure hoping
[1:06:56] that the economy doesn't uh
[1:06:58] move because if so he's in trouble
[1:07:03] and i got to thinking about a man who
[1:07:04] lives down the road from us a ways
[1:07:07] now i must admit he's old maybe it's the
[1:07:10] old men that finally collect the dollars
[1:07:11] i don't know
[1:07:12] but i know a man that drives a pickup
[1:07:14] that's worth maybe four or five thousand
[1:07:16] dollars and has four or five million in
[1:07:17] the bank
[1:07:19] he's not concerned because he's
[1:07:22] taken care of business
[1:07:26] hope you follow me you see my brother
[1:07:29] sister it's not the vainglory of this
[1:07:31] world it's not how big our church is
[1:07:32] it's not how
[1:07:33] magnificent or how well known we are or
[1:07:36] who in the city would come to our church
[1:07:38] none of that matters if christ is here
[1:07:40] we have the wealth of this world we have
[1:07:43] everything we need if christ is here if
[1:07:46] we don't have christ here it won't
[1:07:47] matter if we have millions in the bank
[1:07:50] we will be bankrupt and so the vainglory
[1:07:52] of this world
[1:07:53] is banking on a look on a presentation
[1:07:56] on a behavior
[1:07:58] and it shows and it is there according
[1:08:00] to the scripture the spirit of vanity
[1:08:03] now in psalms 37 look at this right here
[1:08:06] i hope none of you qualify in verse 21
[1:08:08] here
[1:08:11] the wicked borroweth and payeth not
[1:08:14] again
[1:08:16] boy that's pretty blunt for a christian
[1:08:18] that might just think i
[1:08:19] ain't paying them no get that get that
[1:08:22] idea the devil's thrown out there about
[1:08:24] not paying your bills out of there
[1:08:26] if you have to eat beans and rice you
[1:08:28] pay your bill
[1:08:30] the wicked borroweth and payeth not
[1:08:31] again but the righteous
[1:08:33] showeth mercy and giveth you know
[1:08:36] you've got to have something to give if
[1:08:37] you're going to give and we know
[1:08:39] god promised to bless us for such as be
[1:08:42] blessed of him
[1:08:43] shall inherit the earth and they that be
[1:08:46] cursed of him
[1:08:46] shall be cut off the steps
[1:08:50] this will go right back to whether god's
[1:08:51] in charge or not that's right
[1:08:54] come on the steps of a good man
[1:08:57] are ordered by the lord and he
[1:08:59] delighteth in his way
[1:09:01] so god's not going to send you in a
[1:09:03] pathway that's not pleasing to him
[1:09:06] people say well the lord told me to do
[1:09:08] this the lord told me to do that
[1:09:11] and then it turns into chaos and people
[1:09:13] are shorted and all kinds of things
[1:09:15] happen
[1:09:16] my brother and sister
[1:09:20] i won't go there nah that's definitely a
[1:09:21] rabbit trail
[1:09:23] but i want to tell you right now steps
[1:09:25] of a good man
[1:09:26] you can study this out and it's not just
[1:09:29] he's a nice kind gentleman we're talking
[1:09:31] about a man who's obedient to the word
[1:09:33] of god follows the leadership of the
[1:09:34] holy ghost
[1:09:36] god's in charge of his life that's why i
[1:09:38] get up in the morning
[1:09:40] and i sometimes say lord forgive me of
[1:09:42] my vanity
[1:09:43] i'm worried about the price of
[1:09:44] commodities i'm worried about the price
[1:09:46] of fuel i'm worried about this i'm
[1:09:47] worried
[1:09:48] about that and then i have to stop and
[1:09:49] say you know what i'm not in charge of
[1:09:51] this anyhow
[1:09:55] though he fall here's the verse i
[1:09:57] referenced to earlier
[1:09:59] though he fall he shall not be utterly
[1:10:02] cast down for the lord uphold of him
[1:10:04] with his hand aren't you glad i'll tell
[1:10:07] you what you think about it
[1:10:09] what is it the footsteps and the sands
[1:10:11] of time to realize that it's god
[1:10:13] carrying us
[1:10:14] we're not doing anything god's taking
[1:10:16] care of us along in this journey
[1:10:18] amen i have been young and now i am old
[1:10:21] yet have i
[1:10:22] not seen the righteous forsaken or his
[1:10:24] seed begging bread
[1:10:26] he is ever oh come on can someone say it
[1:10:30] with me
[1:10:31] he is ever merciful
[1:10:34] and lendeth and his seed is
[1:10:37] blessed i am blessed
[1:10:41] you are blessed but i want to focus
[1:10:44] right here my brother and sister he is
[1:10:46] ever merciful
[1:10:48] and lyndon you read that and you're
[1:10:50] almost
[1:10:51] it strikes my mind like he lindeth
[1:10:54] like a banker
[1:10:58] something spoke to me and said that's
[1:11:00] not right
[1:11:01] our god is not a banker he doesn't say
[1:11:04] i'll give this to you for a season
[1:11:06] and you must give this back plus more
[1:11:10] that's not how our god operates grace
[1:11:13] and mercy
[1:11:14] is sufficient amen and to the day my
[1:11:17] brother and sister
[1:11:18] so we looked into this and to realize
[1:11:21] how beautiful
[1:11:22] that the word of god is and how it lays
[1:11:25] this out
[1:11:26] because the definition of this word
[1:11:28] going back into the greek
[1:11:29] does also talk about uh to borrow as a
[1:11:33] form of obligation
[1:11:34] but this word lindeth
[1:11:37] means to twine amen
[1:11:41] to unite to remain
[1:11:46] to join together
[1:11:48] [Music]
[1:11:50] now let's read that a little different
[1:11:52] he is ever
[1:11:53] merciful and he has joined
[1:11:56] together with you and i and his seed is
[1:12:00] blessed
[1:12:01] he has entwined us that means to
[1:12:05] twist together into
[1:12:08] one oh hallelujah he's not a banker with
[1:12:12] a handout pay the debt pay the debt he's
[1:12:14] over here saying you
[1:12:16] and i are one you in me
[1:12:19] as one hallelujah you're not subservient
[1:12:23] and i will take this and show you by
[1:12:25] type in the scripture in a minute you're
[1:12:27] not subservient
[1:12:29] you are the bride of christ according to
[1:12:31] the word of god
[1:12:32] and what god has done is not because he
[1:12:35] has
[1:12:36] a paper or a debt over you he did it
[1:12:39] freely and he didn't say i loan it to
[1:12:42] you
[1:12:42] but he says i have given you i have
[1:12:46] given you my name
[1:12:47] i have given you my spirit i have given
[1:12:49] you my nature
[1:12:50] i have given you my life
[1:12:55] nowhere did he said i just loaned it to
[1:12:57] you for a season
[1:12:58] he says i gave it to you and you are now
[1:13:02] identified in me
[1:13:05] oh hallelujah oh thank you lord i'm
[1:13:09] sorry saints but i got excited when i
[1:13:11] was looking at this
[1:13:12] you look at this in a world you know
[1:13:14] it's just like well everything
[1:13:15] has a price it does that's absolutely
[1:13:18] right
[1:13:18] everything has a price christ paid the
[1:13:21] price
[1:13:22] to come down and enjoying himself with
[1:13:24] you and i
[1:13:25] to wrap himself with you and i that we
[1:13:28] would become one he paid a price
[1:13:30] and people say well it costs a lot to be
[1:13:32] a christian does it
[1:13:38] hallelujah i was listening to a
[1:13:40] financial deal the other day
[1:13:43] made me cry i say that a little bit
[1:13:45] facetiously but
[1:13:47] it's talking about how if you started
[1:13:48] off at the age of 20 or 21
[1:13:52] and put 122 dollars or something in the
[1:13:56] bank
[1:13:56] every month at that age at 65 you would
[1:13:59] be worth several million dollars just on
[1:14:02] interest and i cried
[1:14:07] because at 20 or 21 i had a new pickup
[1:14:10] and i had a new dirt bike and i had a
[1:14:12] gun and i had this and i had that
[1:14:14] and i had no savings in fact it's kind
[1:14:18] of embarrassing that when
[1:14:19] sister jerry and i got married she had
[1:14:21] more money than i did
[1:14:25] but you see my brother and sister
[1:14:27] nothing is free
[1:14:30] everything has a cost
[1:14:35] he paid that cost and he sent us the
[1:14:38] letter that said you are free
[1:14:40] amen hallelujah i just rejoice
[1:14:43] i'll never i'll never get somebody said
[1:14:45] well you know they when you're saved
[1:14:46] you're safe you know it's just kind of
[1:14:48] that's it
[1:14:48] i'm sorry i wake some up in the middle
[1:14:51] of the night sometimes and i'm just like
[1:14:53] why me lord
[1:14:57] why not the man down the road why not
[1:14:59] the man on the hill why not this lord
[1:15:01] why me
[1:15:03] when it all settles i have no real
[1:15:05] answer to that other than thank you lord
[1:15:09] hallelujah you know i've come across
[1:15:12] some thoughts in different people and
[1:15:14] they think that predestination
[1:15:16] comes as kind of a form of obligation
[1:15:18] that you know okay god chose you and now
[1:15:20] you have to perform
[1:15:24] god making you do this but you see when
[1:15:26] i read my bible
[1:15:27] right the ones who don't even believe in
[1:15:29] predestination have just tore a page out
[1:15:31] of their bible
[1:15:33] but people get this idea of god making
[1:15:35] you oh my how they miss it
[1:15:38] how they miss it my brother and sister
[1:15:40] predestination
[1:15:41] is the revelation that i was called of
[1:15:44] god you realize my brother and sister if
[1:15:45] the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:15:47] ordered of the lord
[1:15:48] then predestination said you would be
[1:15:50] here tonight
[1:15:52] the predestination said you would say
[1:15:54] praise the lord for saving my soul
[1:15:56] and pray destination acknowledge that
[1:15:58] you would look here and look at the
[1:15:59] blood
[1:16:00] and realize how much that debt was paid
[1:16:03] and predestination would look into your
[1:16:05] life and say you know what
[1:16:07] even in the hard times i'm going to say
[1:16:09] the lord is my savior
[1:16:10] the lord is my shield my buckler he is
[1:16:13] my uh
[1:16:14] my my rock he's everything amen we'll
[1:16:18] look at that predestination is not a
[1:16:20] taskmaster causing you to
[1:16:24] it's a revelation that god said i knew
[1:16:27] you would
[1:16:28] i knew you would i knew what i put in
[1:16:31] you
[1:16:32] and i knew that you would be here to
[1:16:34] hear the preaching of the word
[1:16:35] and say amen tonight i am a son of god i
[1:16:38] am a daughter of god
[1:16:40] you wouldn't sit back and said well
[1:16:42] maybe i am or i could be a
[1:16:44] possibility you look at the word and the
[1:16:46] word
[1:16:47] spoke to you and something inside of you
[1:16:49] responds to that word
[1:16:51] and you know you are oh excuse me for
[1:16:54] getting excited
[1:16:55] hallelujah
[1:16:58] as my brother and sister my bible says
[1:17:01] now i'm not saying
[1:17:02] who i have no no control nor would i
[1:17:04] even want that kind of authority
[1:17:06] but my bible says that i'm called to
[1:17:08] hear that's right
[1:17:10] amen can you can you stand with me
[1:17:23] i'm not going to sit back and say oh
[1:17:24] okay so that's god's word for the day
[1:17:26] fine fine fine no sir something i i
[1:17:29] praise the lord that you paul praise the
[1:17:32] lord that's
[1:17:33] yes that's those footsteps right there i
[1:17:35] want to walk in those footsteps
[1:17:37] i want to be that man the bible's
[1:17:39] talking about
[1:17:40] i'm not going to let the devil come and
[1:17:42] say but just a second we have some debts
[1:17:44] that you haven't paid i'm sorry to tell
[1:17:46] you
[1:17:46] my debt is paid it's paid in full
[1:17:51] hallelujah there's nothing like that
[1:17:54] i can tell you saints when we paid off
[1:17:56] the farm that we live on or used to live
[1:17:57] on i should say we're working on the
[1:17:59] next one
[1:18:00] debt you know but there was nothing like
[1:18:04] the feeling of the day when that letter
[1:18:07] come in the mail
[1:18:10] and we realized this place belongs to us
[1:18:13] talking natural now
[1:18:14] there was just something about that
[1:18:18] and there was a man said hey there's a
[1:18:19] farm over here i would love to own this
[1:18:21] farm and he says
[1:18:22] you know what we can loan you
[1:18:25] he named a certain amount of money
[1:18:26] against this farm that you have paid off
[1:18:29] and you could buy that farm
[1:18:37] boy i love that farm no
[1:18:43] because there's nothing like knowing
[1:18:46] that you're
[1:18:46] free oh is that not what the word had
[1:18:50] told us
[1:18:52] oh he who is free is free indeed
[1:18:56] hallelujah i'm not going to say i'm
[1:18:58] going to go back out here and immerse
[1:18:59] myself in the world for a while
[1:19:01] because surely god would just come back
[1:19:03] and drag me back out of this mess
[1:19:05] no sir i am free i am
[1:19:08] not going back hallelujah
[1:19:13] the devil no matter how many flowers my
[1:19:15] daddy used to tell me this i'm sorry to
[1:19:17] just kind of sound like i'm reminiscing
[1:19:18] but my daddy used to say son
[1:19:20] he said i don't care how many roses you
[1:19:22] hang on a pig it's still a pig
[1:19:28] you know yes sir hallelujah
[1:19:33] now i want to just tie this up right
[1:19:35] here
[1:19:37] we're talking about what's ours and
[1:19:38] what's not and what's borrowed and
[1:19:40] what's
[1:19:42] i won't take you in the scripture for
[1:19:43] the sake of time here tonight
[1:19:46] but esther the whole story comes along
[1:19:50] and it's unfolding
[1:19:52] and one day there's a need
[1:19:55] one day the pressure is on one day the
[1:19:58] world around her
[1:20:00] is threatening to consume her and
[1:20:03] all that she values
[1:20:08] mordecai says you know what little girl
[1:20:13] you're probably born for a day just like
[1:20:17] this day
[1:20:24] you know kids can be cruel
[1:20:28] i remember as a young man
[1:20:33] this young man made a statement he said
[1:20:35] oh i wished i was born in the days of
[1:20:37] cowboys and indians
[1:20:39] and this other kid got this slider in
[1:20:41] and he says
[1:20:43] yeah imagine some indian would have
[1:20:45] liked to have seen you
[1:20:49] because your hair is pretty
[1:20:54] that's just cruel this kid goes away
[1:20:55] crushed his little dream is he's telling
[1:20:57] me i would have been killed and scalped
[1:20:59] and
[1:21:00] this is horrible no we were born for
[1:21:03] this day don't look back
[1:21:07] and say i wished we were back here i can
[1:21:10] tell you my brother and sister's never
[1:21:11] been easy to serve god
[1:21:13] there's never been any cake walk there's
[1:21:15] never been any you know peaches and
[1:21:17] cream
[1:21:18] it's always required an effort so here
[1:21:21] we're looking i i hope i'm not being
[1:21:23] too crass tonight i mean
[1:21:28] you see we can fantasize
[1:21:32] some idea of what it would be like to be
[1:21:36] somewhere else to have been someone else
[1:21:40] you know the prayer warrior that
[1:21:42] everybody envies oh brother so and so
[1:21:44] when he prayed
[1:21:45] praise things happen
[1:21:50] we have a fantasy
[1:21:53] that he kneels down for the same length
[1:21:55] of time that we do
[1:21:58] when he prays but god answers his prayer
[1:22:04] we're not willing to pay the price
[1:22:07] he prays pays for answered prayers
[1:22:13] come on saints i don't want anybody to
[1:22:15] feel bad i'm just telling you
[1:22:16] don't envy that unless you're willing to
[1:22:18] pay the price he's paying
[1:22:20] don't think oh i would love to be
[1:22:21] spiritual i'd love to do this are you
[1:22:24] willing to pay the price
[1:22:28] there's the cost
[1:22:32] before i get negative here
[1:22:37] esther comes in that time
[1:22:40] with confidence we've preached about her
[1:22:42] many times here in the church
[1:22:43] and she comes she doesn't walk in and
[1:22:45] say you know what i hope i don't die i
[1:22:47] hope i don't die i hope you don't exile
[1:22:49] me i hope i don't
[1:22:50] you know no sir she went in there she
[1:22:52] said you know what i'm not just the
[1:22:54] queen
[1:22:55] i'm his wife
[1:22:58] i'm not just another woman i'm his
[1:23:02] wife oh if we'll approach god that way
[1:23:05] amen we're not just some person out here
[1:23:08] his word declared that we are the very
[1:23:11] bride
[1:23:12] of jesus christ we are his wife and the
[1:23:15] king looks out there and i can only see
[1:23:17] his heart melt my brother and sister i
[1:23:18] hope you catch the spiritual type here
[1:23:20] he sees his wife and he knows she's
[1:23:23] there not to talk to the
[1:23:25] the banker you know or the chief
[1:23:27] financial officer of the kingdom
[1:23:29] not to talk about the decorator or the
[1:23:31] baker she's there to talk to him
[1:23:35] and she's there and he says you know
[1:23:36] what come he holds his scepter outcome
[1:23:39] and when she come up he says now
[1:23:41] sweetheart
[1:23:43] i'll borrow to you anything
[1:23:46] to the half of the kingdom
[1:23:51] did i twist something up there i got
[1:23:54] mixed up
[1:23:54] didn't i no sir
[1:23:58] he said i give amen
[1:24:01] to you to the half
[1:24:04] of my kingdom esther was not a beggar
[1:24:10] but i can assure you that when esther
[1:24:12] approached her husband
[1:24:13] through the ages she didn't go in there
[1:24:16] and say
[1:24:17] well i've decided to sell that quarter
[1:24:19] of the kingdom to the kingdom next door
[1:24:21] because i need some spending money
[1:24:23] macy's has got a discount
[1:24:28] sorry sisters
[1:24:33] so i'm really sorry
[1:24:36] no sir look at this
[1:24:40] esther then had a reassurance of
[1:24:43] who she was
[1:24:48] and she had no debt to pay she was not
[1:24:51] esther the orphan
[1:24:55] any longer she is
[1:24:58] esther the queen
[1:25:01] she knew it and i believe her life
[1:25:05] showed it she walked with confidence
[1:25:09] she didn't approach her husband as in
[1:25:12] please
[1:25:14] but she approached him as a wife should
[1:25:17] with diligence and confidence integrity
[1:25:22] stewardship and most of all
[1:25:26] love that's it amen
[1:25:29] hallelujah he's ever merciful
[1:25:34] and he's entwining us
[1:25:37] into a relationship
[1:25:41] it is not well i do everything he told
[1:25:44] me to do
[1:25:44] i did the ten commandments didn't work
[1:25:46] for the rich young ruler did it
[1:25:48] no i've done all this since my youth
[1:25:52] didn't work for him no relationship
[1:25:56] amen hallelujah hope you don't mind some
[1:26:00] reading right here
[1:26:03] now the papa's vision is just really
[1:26:05] good it's talking about john now
[1:26:07] and under the effects of vision no human
[1:26:10] being
[1:26:10] could stand the full effect of that
[1:26:12] vision his strength utterly gone john
[1:26:14] fell at his feet as though dead
[1:26:16] but the hand of the lord in love touched
[1:26:18] him and the voice of blessing said fear
[1:26:19] not
[1:26:20] don't be afraid i am the first and last
[1:26:23] i am he that liveth and was dead and
[1:26:25] behold
[1:26:26] i'm alive forevermore what is there to
[1:26:29] fear
[1:26:31] the judgment that fell upon him at the
[1:26:33] cross
[1:26:34] at the grave and when he descended was
[1:26:37] for
[1:26:37] us i mean there is nothing my brother
[1:26:39] and sister
[1:26:40] that would go or transcend that he did
[1:26:43] that
[1:26:43] for you and i he did not do that for a
[1:26:46] historical church
[1:26:47] he did not do that for a church of the
[1:26:49] future he did that for
[1:26:50] us here today oh beautiful
[1:26:54] beautiful beautiful amen
[1:26:58] he absorbed the full brunt of the wound
[1:27:00] of sin and there is therefore now
[1:27:01] no condemnation to them that are in
[1:27:04] christ jesus
[1:27:05] amen
[1:27:08] see for a surety our attorney is our
[1:27:11] judge
[1:27:12] he is both attorney and judge and as
[1:27:14] judge the case is settled
[1:27:16] i tell you what i like i like that now
[1:27:19] you know in my youth i
[1:27:20] i had a little issue i visited the judge
[1:27:22] a few times uh
[1:27:23] nothing major you know 80 or 90 and a
[1:27:27] 35 is not really a big deal
[1:27:32] but i tell you my brother and sister i
[1:27:34] learned the lesson really fast
[1:27:37] when sitting in court one day the judge
[1:27:39] leans over
[1:27:40] and said is your father's name david
[1:27:47] i'll pay the ticket just tell me what i
[1:27:49] owe
[1:27:52] i'm not gonna talk to your father about
[1:27:54] this
[1:27:56] but i just want you to know young man
[1:27:59] if i ever see you in this court
[1:28:02] ever again i will remember
[1:28:05] today you know what i realized
[1:28:10] the judge had just become my attorney
[1:28:14] and he said i'm gonna let you go but i'm
[1:28:18] not gonna let you go forever with this
[1:28:19] behavior
[1:28:20] you gotta change it
[1:28:23] oh and by the way the ticket would be
[1:28:25] about 750 dollars and
[1:28:28] full amount of points on your driver's
[1:28:29] license
[1:28:31] wait that means i don't have a driver's
[1:28:33] license
[1:28:36] yes sir i really appreciate you not
[1:28:39] telling my daddy too
[1:28:43] do you understand my brother and sister
[1:28:46] he's our judge
[1:28:48] he's our attorney and he tried the case
[1:28:52] and says no charge case dismissed
[1:28:56] how beautiful is that now don't
[1:28:59] misunderstand me i don't glory in the
[1:29:01] behavior of my childhood it was
[1:29:02] ridiculous and i would hope every young
[1:29:04] person here would get beaten for that
[1:29:05] kind of behavior
[1:29:07] sounds hypocritical i'll face the
[1:29:09] repercussions of being a hypocrite
[1:29:11] but but you know don't don't do that
[1:29:14] don't do that nothing to be gained
[1:29:15] nothing to be gained amen
[1:29:18] now look at this see for a surety our
[1:29:21] attorney is our judge he is both
[1:29:22] attorney and judge and as judged the
[1:29:24] case is settled
[1:29:25] it's finished there is now therefore no
[1:29:27] condemnation
[1:29:29] anytime condemnation shows up my brother
[1:29:31] and sister it's the devil
[1:29:32] trying to trick you into claiming
[1:29:35] something that's paid in full
[1:29:37] why should the church fear what promise
[1:29:40] has he
[1:29:40] ever failed to manifest before us now i
[1:29:43] want to stop just take a moment right
[1:29:44] now
[1:29:45] my brother and sister i want you to look
[1:29:46] in your life and
[1:29:48] search it from beginning to end top to
[1:29:51] bottom
[1:29:51] has god ever failed you we cannot in
[1:29:55] honesty say god has
[1:29:56] ever failed us hallelujah
[1:30:03] why should it fear punishment or death
[1:30:06] it has all been overcome
[1:30:10] he here is the mighty conqueror
[1:30:13] here is the one who conquered both
[1:30:14] worlds of the seen and unseen not like
[1:30:16] alexander who
[1:30:17] conquered the world at the age of 33 and
[1:30:20] knew no other way to turn for further
[1:30:22] conquest so he died a victim of sin and
[1:30:24] riotous living
[1:30:25] not like napoleon who conquered all of
[1:30:26] europe but was finally defeated at
[1:30:28] waterloo and banished to elba
[1:30:30] only to find himself conquered but
[1:30:32] nothing could conquer christ
[1:30:34] he that descended has now ascended above
[1:30:37] all
[1:30:38] unto him has been given a name that is
[1:30:40] above every name
[1:30:42] do are we agreeing with this amen yes he
[1:30:45] conquered death
[1:30:46] hell and the grave has the keys thereof
[1:30:48] what he loses
[1:30:49] is loose oh i'll tell you my brother and
[1:30:52] sister
[1:30:54] what he loses is loosed what he binds
[1:30:58] is bound there is no changing of it the
[1:31:02] devil come back and say you were once
[1:31:03] caught in
[1:31:04] sin lust of the flesh pride of life you
[1:31:06] were a druggie you were this you were
[1:31:08] that you might have been a woman at the
[1:31:09] well and we can say praise god
[1:31:11] i might have been but i am not i am a
[1:31:14] son of god i am a daughter of god
[1:31:17] hallelujah i am not what you're saying i
[1:31:19] am devil
[1:31:21] amen there was no conqueror before him
[1:31:23] there is none beside him
[1:31:25] he alone is the savior
[1:31:29] redeemer he is the only god and lord
[1:31:32] jesus christ is his name
[1:31:35] now he's speaking back these words as it
[1:31:36] was spoken don't fear john
[1:31:38] don't fear little flock amen all that i
[1:31:41] am
[1:31:43] you can borrow
[1:31:54] hallelujah i'm an heir to it
[1:31:57] and the devil can't forge enough papers
[1:32:00] the devil cannot trump up enough stuff
[1:32:02] he can do nothing my brother and sister
[1:32:04] because i'm an
[1:32:06] heir to it hallelujah that means i
[1:32:09] have rights to it not the right to abuse
[1:32:12] it
[1:32:13] not the right to throw it in the dirt
[1:32:15] kick it around but the right to look at
[1:32:17] what god has done
[1:32:19] what he has given what he has opened
[1:32:21] before our eyes a life he has given
[1:32:23] a love he has given and i can look at
[1:32:26] that and say thank you lord
[1:32:27] now i'll be a good steward i'll be a
[1:32:30] good steward of the love you have given
[1:32:32] me
[1:32:34] amen i was reading some lovely writings
[1:32:43] and a man says something of the order i
[1:32:46] don't remember exact words
[1:32:49] he said remember what the bible said
[1:32:54] you shall know them
[1:32:58] by their love
[1:33:02] then he got mean that was just so sweet
[1:33:04] warm fuzzy
[1:33:06] not by their membership of a church not
[1:33:09] by who they know
[1:33:12] nor by the wealth of their possession
[1:33:17] but by their love
[1:33:23] i'm sorry saints and i'm sometimes not
[1:33:25] the nicest guy
[1:33:28] don't misunderstand i'm not apologizing
[1:33:30] for that
[1:33:32] but i want you to know that i love you
[1:33:35] enough
[1:33:40] to do my very best to speak truth
[1:33:48] and sometimes you'll go home from that
[1:33:51] and you lay in bed and the devil's like
[1:33:53] well
[1:33:56] you sure made them look like bad or you
[1:33:58] made this and you made that
[1:34:02] and i have to remind myself
[1:34:05] i have to remind myself just listen to
[1:34:07] what you preached
[1:34:09] just listen to what you preach listen
[1:34:11] and do
[1:34:12] what you preached
[1:34:15] sorry devil it says right here
[1:34:19] paid in amen
[1:34:23] amen now maybe you don't have that
[1:34:26] problem
[1:34:27] i hope you don't but sometimes my
[1:34:30] brother and sister we kind of forget
[1:34:35] all that i am you are
[1:34:38] heir amen too we're not borrowing
[1:34:42] we're not paying interest on it it's
[1:34:45] ours
[1:34:46] it's ours to live it's ours to share
[1:34:50] how could we ever out give god it would
[1:34:53] be impossible
[1:34:55] but we're not looking at the carnal now
[1:34:58] we're looking
[1:34:58] at the life he has amen
[1:35:03] oh my oh my oh my
[1:35:07] okay can we go into part three right now
[1:35:13] all my power
[1:35:16] amen you know esther didn't have to go
[1:35:20] to the
[1:35:21] chamberlain who cared the eunuch who
[1:35:23] cared
[1:35:24] for all the harem all the women
[1:35:28] she didn't have to go and say now you
[1:35:30] guys go ask my husband
[1:35:33] if they can do this and this
[1:35:40] she knew who she was
[1:35:44] would you please and they're amazing
[1:35:47] have you ever met somebody who is really
[1:35:48] rich
[1:35:49] like rich beyond measure
[1:35:52] it's amazing rich me on major produces
[1:35:56] what i would call
[1:35:56] two very contrasting spirits
[1:36:00] used to do work for a man many years ago
[1:36:01] when i was in construction trades
[1:36:04] the man back then was worth hundreds of
[1:36:06] millions of dollars
[1:36:08] and he would come on to a job site
[1:36:12] and he would say would you please
[1:36:15] do this for me
[1:36:19] of course we will sir
[1:36:22] and then i met men who looked at me as
[1:36:25] though
[1:36:26] i was subservient
[1:36:31] and when these men the same time started
[1:36:33] huge projects
[1:36:34] in boise you know what door
[1:36:38] i beat feet to i went to the one
[1:36:42] who even though at that time sister
[1:36:44] jerry and i could barely barely
[1:36:45] just with three kids just barely paid
[1:36:47] our bills made a living
[1:36:51] i didn't care this is the guy i want to
[1:36:52] work for that's the guy i want to be
[1:36:54] identified with
[1:36:56] this is the one who had respect for me
[1:36:59] in my position
[1:37:02] do you realize what god's doing
[1:37:06] he is giving saints i hope you catch
[1:37:07] this it's it's kind of going off in a
[1:37:09] little
[1:37:10] avenue but i hope you catch this do you
[1:37:12] realize that
[1:37:14] god is giving respects to you
[1:37:19] he doesn't look at us in our lowly
[1:37:21] position
[1:37:22] and say you were once this or you were
[1:37:25] once that he never
[1:37:26] he never brings that up amen god pays

[1:38:04] yours
[1:38:05] to use you speak the word
[1:38:08] and i will perform it that is my
[1:38:11] covenant
[1:38:12] and it can never fail i'll tell you i
[1:38:16] thank the lord and when i read my bible
[1:38:18] and i study this this is here in this
[1:38:19] quotation
[1:38:20] but this is the scripture my brother and
[1:38:22] sister when i read this it's just such a
[1:38:24] lovely reminder of me
[1:38:26] of how my lord looks at me because i
[1:38:28] tell you what my brother and sister
[1:38:30] are we can be hard enough on ourselves
[1:38:32] but lo
[1:38:33] look what our lord he gives respects
[1:38:36] to you and i honor to us as sons and
[1:38:39] daughters of god
[1:38:41] my aren't you glad tonight amen that we
[1:38:44] could just come to this lovely place
[1:38:47] being trained god loves us so much he's
[1:38:50] investing he's training us
[1:38:53] bringing us to a place we recognize who
[1:38:55] we are and the authority that we have
[1:38:58] i mean once again just a little
[1:39:00] reference back
[1:39:03] think about what esther
[1:39:06] had to go through an orphan
[1:39:10] you study the scripture
[1:39:13] i'll tell you mordecai was not a
[1:39:15] pushover
[1:39:18] he had an expectation of esther and he
[1:39:21] held her to that standard
[1:39:23] and she subjected herself to a whole
[1:39:26] kingdom
[1:39:26] [Music]
[1:39:28] for a chance to be queen
[1:39:32] imagine how it would have changed her
[1:39:33] world
[1:39:35] if she had known she was the queen
[1:39:40] but you see how god allowed that to
[1:39:42] happen he let her go through
[1:39:44] every struggle of life everything of
[1:39:46] life the ups and the downs the
[1:39:48] uncertainties
[1:39:50] but because she was queen she had to be
[1:39:54] manifested
[1:39:55] as queen in the right season
[1:39:58] and here we are as sons and daughters of
[1:40:01] god according to the word the bride of
[1:40:03] christ
[1:40:04] amen the queen and we have to be
[1:40:07] manifested
[1:40:10] we can look back and say but i was
[1:40:11] orphaned i was this i was that no sorry
[1:40:15] god knew you were his
[1:40:18] and he said the season will come and i
[1:40:22] will express it isn't that beautiful i
[1:40:23] just love that
[1:40:24] it just always serves my heart saints
[1:40:26] maybe i maybe i am i
[1:40:28] have to admit i'm the guy that that you

[1:40:36] maybe maybe i'm a little emotional but i
