[0:00] uh uh capitalize on probably in one
[0:02] service
[0:03] and uh saints honestly i'm shrinking my
[0:06] plate
[0:07] and i keep trying to shrink it down
[0:09] further i was joking with brother jason
[0:12] in the back room as i was adding another
[0:14] chunk of scripture
[0:16] just you know i just lord help me to
[0:18] shrink the plate
[0:20] but remember the scripture
[0:24] speaks very strongly of us who we are
[0:28] why we're here it speaks of vessels of
[0:31] honor
[0:31] and it speaks of vessels of dishonor now
[0:34] we have to just
[0:36] look at this and i know who we are
[0:37] tonight amen
[0:39] and we look at this no we are not
[0:41] vessels of dishonor
[0:42] we are vessels of honor but satan would
[0:45] like to pour
[0:46] what he desires into the vessel but god
[0:49] says
[0:49] nope if he pour if satan pours something
[0:52] in there you pour it out
[0:53] and cleanse the vessel because it's a
[0:55] holy vessel
[0:56] amen first peter first chapter verses
[0:59] one through
[1:00] five amen peter an apostle of jesus
[1:04] christ to the strangers scattered
[1:06] throughout pontus galatia cappadocia
[1:08] asia and bithya
[1:12] now i want you to remember we're talking
[1:14] about potential tonight
[1:16] elect according to the foreknowledge of
[1:18] god the father
[1:20] through sanctification of the spirit
[1:22] unto obedience
[1:24] and sprinkling of the blood of jesus
[1:26] christ grace unto you and peace be
[1:28] multiplied
[1:30] blessed be the god and father of our
[1:32] lord jesus christ
[1:33] which according to his abundant mercy
[1:35] have begotten us again
[1:37] unto a lively hope by the resurrection
[1:39] of jesus christ
[1:41] from the dead to an inheritance
[1:44] incorruptible
[1:45] and undefiled that fadeth not away
[1:48] reserved in heaven for you
[1:51] now my brother and sister i want to make
[1:53] emphasis here
[1:54] if it's reserved for you there's only
[1:58] one who can make a reservation in heaven
[2:01] amen no man can no pope not even a
[2:04] prophet
[2:05] amen it's nothing short of almighty god
[2:08] our lord jesus christ making the
[2:11] reservation
[2:12] so if he's made a reservation for you
[2:15] then he knew that you contained the
[2:18] potential
[2:19] to show up it's not just about
[2:23] saying we're going to be there but we
[2:25] actually have to show up
[2:28] amen so he sees the potential
[2:32] in us to be there who are
[2:36] kept by the power of god through faith
[2:39] unto salvation ready to be revealed
[2:42] in the last time father we just ask you
[2:44] to come and
[2:45] lord speak through us tonight and father
[2:48] earth
[2:49] the laborers of the day the weak father
[2:51] sometimes we
[2:53] don't have the time that we would like
[2:55] to commit or should commit
[2:57] but father we truly commit all of this
[3:00] to you tonight
[3:01] that you would speak father according to
[3:03] thy will
[3:05] lord to the needs of the people lord
[3:08] touch each and every one i pray today
[3:10] in your precious name amen you may be
[3:13] seated
[3:16] you know as i was reading this scripture
[3:18] in first peter
[3:19] here i i was struck my brother and
[3:22] sister
[3:23] you know elect according to the
[3:24] foreknowledge of god and
[3:26] you know as we would look at this we
[3:28] never want to make justification for our
[3:30] weaknesses or shortcomings in the flesh
[3:33] but we know that god knows everything
[3:36] about
[3:36] each one of us it's not a surprise when
[3:40] we
[3:40] have a struggle over something it's not
[3:42] a surprise maybe
[3:44] when our feelings get hurt or or we feel
[3:46] like that we
[3:48] have a a not a friend on the earth i
[3:51] don't know if uh you would have um
[3:54] we we might post it right here on the
[3:56] church on
[3:57] uh sunday i'm still praying about that
[4:00] but uh
[4:01] brother george shared with us a little
[4:03] deal
[4:04] about reading the bible i don't know did
[4:06] any of you see that
[4:07] i think sister jerry posted that today
[4:09] on the on the church website
[4:12] website anyway now
[4:15] it's going to be one of them evening
[4:16] saints uh so you look at that
[4:19] and and what that little clip is about
[4:22] uh is what
[4:23] a reading your bible does to you and so
[4:26] we look at this and realize my brother
[4:28] and sister that
[4:30] the uh elect according to the
[4:31] foreknowledge of god
[4:33] god had to have something that would be
[4:35] the stimulus
[4:36] to sons and daughters of god in the day
[4:38] that we live in
[4:40] and as sister jerry shared that uh uh
[4:43] brother george having sent that
[4:45] uh my brother and sister you realize the
[4:47] stimulus that god
[4:49] uh has now it is important that we would
[4:51] make our claim and vocalize it that
[4:54] i am a son of god i am a daughter of god
[4:56] and
[4:57] i have received uh the word i have been
[5:00] filled with the holy ghost it's
[5:01] important for you
[5:03] to make those declarations but still as
[5:06] we go through life my brother and sister
[5:08] there has to be a stimulation that comes
[5:11] that stirs the heart every time that it
[5:14] comes to us and
[5:15] i thought that was lovely uh uh to to
[5:18] see that little bit of research
[5:20] that reading the bible has a stimulation
[5:24] it's not just uh something to talk about
[5:26] but the actual reading of the bible
[5:29] uh is a stimulation amen and so as we'll
[5:32] look at this we realize that god has
[5:34] come
[5:35] and so is he is stirring us by his word
[5:39] amen
[5:40] now the prophet of god i don't have
[5:42] quotes right here tonight to back this
[5:44] up but certainly
[5:46] uh we uh understand and know the message
[5:48] the prophet of god
[5:49] uh tells us that the preeminence of
[5:52] coming to church
[5:53] is not the singing amen it is not even
[5:57] our time of worship but it is the word
[6:00] because the word is what stimulates sons
[6:04] and daughters of god
[6:05] now singing is a wonderful thing i think
[6:07] it's good i think we should pour our
[6:09] heart out
[6:10] when we sing but my brother and sister
[6:12] there's a lot of people who sing
[6:14] who do not have the holy ghost amen but
[6:17] if you have the holy ghost
[6:19] you will sing amen you will praise god
[6:22] hallelujah
[6:23] and so as we'll look at this tonight i
[6:25] want you to see here
[6:27] now who are kept this is verse 5 who are
[6:30] kept by the power of god
[6:31] through faith into salvation ready to be
[6:34] revealed
[6:34] in the last time and as i was reading
[6:36] this my brother and sister
[6:38] i am not now trying to turn the
[6:40] scripture i'm just sharing
[6:42] inspiration that come to me and you look
[6:45] at this and see to an
[6:47] inheritance this is what he's brought to
[6:49] us my brother and sister
[6:50] an inheritance that's incorruptible
[6:53] hallelujah
[6:54] not going to fade away you're not going
[6:55] to go claim a promise of god
[6:57] and find that that promise has been
[6:59] eroded by
[7:00] time and is no longer valid amen and so
[7:03] it is undef uncorruptable and undefiled
[7:07] and it fadeth not away it's reserved in
[7:09] heaven for us so all we got to do
[7:11] as it were is ring up heaven and ask for
[7:14] that reservation
[7:16] amen and it is there now he's talking
[7:19] in heaven for you and unless my uh uh
[7:22] vast knowledge of the english language
[7:25] has diminished uh
[7:26] much more than it already is
[7:30] this who here is talking about you right
[7:33] who are kept by the power of god
[7:37] through faith amen nothing else
[7:40] right and how does faith come by
[7:43] hearing the word amen it doesn't say
[7:46] anything about
[7:47] singing it doesn't say anything about
[7:50] testimonies
[7:51] these are all important they're
[7:52] ingredients my brother and sister
[7:54] but it's faith and faith cometh by
[7:56] hearing the word
[7:58] so through faith unto salvation ready to
[8:01] be revealed in the last time
[8:03] now often times when we read this
[8:05] scripture and it would be in the proper
[8:07] context to realize
[8:08] that it's the revealing of the word in
[8:11] this hour amen the call
[8:13] in this late hour that called you and i
[8:16] a revelation or opening of the word that
[8:19] had been unveiled from man but my
[8:21] brother and sister i want if you can
[8:23] just step out in this little thought
[8:24] with me this evening
[8:26] i want you to understand that the uh
[8:28] solution
[8:29] as it were what is necessary for you as
[8:32] it were
[8:33] all the ingredients as it were were
[8:35] reserved in heaven for you
[8:37] to be revealed now we are in the last
[8:39] time amen
[8:41] so it's not my brother and sister about
[8:43] a message
[8:44] being revealed but this is actually
[8:46] about jesus christ who is
[8:49] already in you amen who has already made
[8:52] reservation
[8:53] for you this is about what he has
[8:55] deposited
[8:56] in your name being now revealed
[9:00] amen the ability to believe the word
[9:03] was already deposited in you amen the
[9:06] faith to act on that
[9:08] word already deposited in you right the
[9:11] prophet of god said everything you need
[9:13] to make a rapture
[9:14] is already in you
[9:18] amen it's not in the preacher the
[9:20] evangelist not in whatever
[9:22] it's in you amen so we're seeing now
[9:26] that this power of god through faith
[9:28] into salvation
[9:30] is ready to be revealed are you with me
[9:33] tonight
[9:34] amen it is being revealed we have seen
[9:37] it revealed
[9:38] but i believe there is so much more so i
[9:41] don't have the quote for you tonight
[9:42] but brother branham says that that there
[9:44] is much more than we
[9:46] see right now for us amen so what is it
[9:50] god's got it he's revealing it in the
[9:52] time
[9:53] and the season and as we move forward my
[9:56] brother and sister
[9:57] we see more revelation we see more of
[9:59] who we are
[10:00] we understand the plan better than ever
[10:03] before
[10:04] and you know it's sad i want to throw
[10:06] this in and i don't mean it negative
[10:07] but those who give gave up or quit many
[10:10] years
[10:11] gone by in the past they they're looking
[10:14] at you
[10:14] now they're looking at your life they're
[10:16] looking at what you uh
[10:18] confess what you believe they're looking
[10:21] at that and it is
[10:23] even more removed from them than it was
[10:26] before why
[10:27] because since the time that many of them
[10:29] walked away
[10:30] there's been much more revelation oh
[10:33] i've been told recently by ministers
[10:35] said well when the prophet passed from
[10:36] the scene
[10:37] there's no more revelation well my
[10:39] brother and sister that might be why
[10:41] those individuals
[10:42] are where they're at because you see
[10:45] this right here
[10:46] my brother and sister is revelation
[10:48] isn't that not what revealed means
[10:50] amen this is revelation that is going to
[10:54] be revealed so what is it
[10:55] god is peeling back as it were the
[10:58] layers of the onion which is
[11:00] you and what is on the inside of the
[11:02] inside of the inside
[11:05] is being revealed amen not something
[11:08] that was back when
[11:10] when we were comfortable with just god
[11:12] sent a prophet
[11:13] amen not back just to the days when
[11:15] someone got up and said well
[11:17] you know look at the third pull not in
[11:20] those my brother and sister that's all
[11:21] important but that's not the revelation
[11:25] that it's talking about here this is a
[11:27] revelation
[11:28] of christ in you amen so the layer being
[11:32] peeled back
[11:33] as time goes on amen i imagine all of
[11:36] you because you are believers and have
[11:38] been believers for a long time
[11:40] this journey is getting much easier as
[11:43] you go on
[11:48] to edge of sword isn't it because as you
[11:52] see more of who you
[11:53] are it is getting easier
[11:57] but as you get up tomorrow morning
[12:01] it's not getting easier it used to be
[12:05] that you could even go
[12:07] to a grocery store and just walk through
[12:10] a store
[12:11] you know i don't mean to taint your
[12:13] thinking tonight
[12:14] but the behavior of humanity now you
[12:17] would think when it got cold it would
[12:19] change their behaviors
[12:20] but no they go to the store in their
[12:23] shorts and go-go boots
[12:24] in january so it has to be an anointing
[12:28] because it can't be any sense
[12:31] amen so what is this this revelation
[12:34] in you is bringing to a place as the
[12:38] season and i know it's getting harder
[12:40] saints okay it's just a matter of figure
[12:41] of speech right
[12:42] as it gets harder right because the
[12:44] prophet of god showed us how as it would
[12:46] come down we're headed towards a
[12:47] complete apostasy
[12:49] complete darkness so for the son or
[12:52] daughter of god
[12:53] the outside world we're living in is
[12:55] getting more difficult to live in
[12:57] but you know i say thank you lord
[12:59] because that's what's going to cause you
[13:01] and i just sigh
[13:02] and cry that is what's going to cause
[13:04] you as we spoke the other day
[13:06] to turn up the prayer meter amen to turn
[13:09] it up
[13:09] because we are seeing the world falling
[13:12] apart and i say thank you lord
[13:14] because you see i'm not worried about
[13:16] what has happened he didn't say i'm
[13:18] going to keep
[13:18] the world he said he was going to keep
[13:21] you
[13:22] hallelujah aren't you glad tonight
[13:25] he's keeping that promise thank you lord
[13:28] amen so here we are established but i
[13:30] want to go back and just hit that see as
[13:32] people who have walked away they don't
[13:34] understand my brother and sister
[13:36] how you can just stand they say well we
[13:37] have this and we have a contradiction
[13:39] here
[13:39] we can't find nothing i just come across
[13:41] the deal the other day sometimes they
[13:42] stick
[13:43] and we can't find one shred of evidence
[13:45] well my brother and sister i i don't
[13:47] know
[13:48] that uh they uh jesus walked on water
[13:52] i have not won shredded evidence
[13:57] well hallelujah
[14:02] well we could use a lot of analogies on
[14:04] that i'll just shut that one off
[14:06] but my brother and sister it wouldn't be
[14:08] faith
[14:09] if we had evidence
[14:13] now i don't say that that we blindly
[14:14] walk but there comes a time and a place
[14:16] you get on an airplane you don't know my
[14:18] brother and sister that the wing ain't
[14:19] going to fall off of that airplane but
[14:20] you get on that plane by faith
[14:23] and if you get nervous about getting on
[14:24] the plane and the wing falling off
[14:26] remember
[14:26] you have greater odds according to the
[14:28] statistics
[14:29] of getting hit within six miles of your
[14:32] house
[14:32] in a car
[14:36] now i don't say these things to bring up
[14:38] a negative thing any of you flying
[14:42] no but my brother and sister we have to
[14:44] recognize
[14:45] that faith is a resident
[14:49] to a son or daughter of god it's not
[14:51] fleeting it doesn't come
[14:52] or go it is resident hallelujah
[14:56] are we good now let's go right here into
[14:59] ephesians 1 and 18
[15:01] 19 in the eyes of your understanding
[15:04] we're talking about potential tonight
[15:05] right
[15:06] and it being developed the eyes of your
[15:09] understanding being enlightened
[15:11] right so that line right there is
[15:13] talking of potential
[15:14] amen because you see every man or every
[15:17] woman that read their bible ephesians 1
[15:19] 18
[15:19] not every man who read that eyes were
[15:22] open
[15:24] so it is speaking of the potential
[15:27] that is in sons and daughters of god
[15:29] right
[15:30] so the eyes of your understanding being
[15:32] enlightened that ye may know
[15:34] what is the hope of his calling and what
[15:36] the riches of the glory of his
[15:38] inheritance in the
[15:40] saints every bit of verse 18 is speaking
[15:43] of potential
[15:45] amen verse 19 and what is the exceeding
[15:48] greatness of his power
[15:49] to us word who believe according to the
[15:52] working of his mighty power
[15:54] now my brother and sister you and i have
[15:56] believe it or not
[15:58] not even come into but a fraction of the
[16:00] power of almighty god
[16:02] he spoke heavens and earth now it might
[16:04] have been a thousand years ten thousand
[16:06] years it's all irrelevant whether you're
[16:08] a believer of the old earth and the new
[16:09] earth and they've got all kinds of
[16:11] subcategories that they put into time
[16:14] and
[16:14] they say well you know this can't be
[16:16] right because we have evidence of
[16:17] dinosaurs and
[16:18] we have evidence of this that and the
[16:20] other my brother and sister
[16:21] i'm just going to take what the word
[16:23] said and when i take this
[16:25] i'm reading this and i see a potential
[16:28] or a promise in there
[16:29] that says my eyes are going to be open
[16:31] amen so what am i looking for
[16:33] i'm looking for my eyes to be opened i'm
[16:36] not going to sit back and say well
[16:37] hallelujah
[16:38] god will reveal it to somebody look the
[16:40] prophet of god spoke many words that
[16:42] people
[16:43] still don't understand it takes eyes of
[16:46] understanding ears of understanding
[16:48] to understand what was already broken
[16:51] out of this scripture
[16:52] and laid on the table amen so there the
[16:55] potential of
[16:56] your understanding being enlightened
[16:58] amen that you have the potential to know
[17:01] the hope of his calling
[17:02] you have the potential to know the
[17:04] riches of his
[17:06] glory of the inheritance now my brother
[17:08] and sister
[17:09] an inheritance is not an inheritance
[17:11] unless it's been bequest
[17:15] it has to be designated to someone
[17:19] to actually be classified an inheritance
[17:23] you see if it's just left did you know i
[17:27] did a little studying on this
[17:28] did you know that there is a tremendous
[17:30] amount of money every year
[17:32] that goes into the state funds
[17:35] and depending on the situation into the
[17:37] federal funds
[17:38] because someone died with a tremendous
[17:40] amount of money and left it to no one
[17:43] and after it sets there and no one can
[17:45] make a legitimate claim
[17:47] then the state can step in put that
[17:50] money in account
[17:52] use that money as it were for uh uh
[17:55] we're gonna just use this term time and
[17:57] eternity until
[17:59] someone makes a claim at different
[18:01] states have different laws but if it
[18:03] passes for a certain amount of years
[18:05] unclaimed then the state has no
[18:07] obligation to ever give it up
[18:09] so you look at this my brother and
[18:11] sister for an inheritance to truly be an
[18:14] inheritance someone has to be named as
[18:17] the
[18:17] receiver of such amen aren't you glad i
[18:21] just read my name right in there
[18:22] hallelujah it's just plain to me as
[18:24] plain as day my name is right there
[18:27] hallelujah amen so we get to make that
[18:30] claim
[18:31] upon the word of god that there is a
[18:34] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[18:36] in wait not coming to
[18:42] in the saints you see god already made
[18:44] the investment in us
[18:46] hallelujah we'll get to kind of
[18:48] hopefully lord willing here but you see
[18:49] it's not this is not something to come
[18:52] this is something that's already here
[18:55] hallelujah
[18:57] oh many would contest that my brother
[18:59] and sister they believe if you talk
[19:01] about god being present with us that you
[19:03] are
[19:03] uh uh uh you know going off into a
[19:06] doctrine of parasia
[19:07] perugia however you want to pronounce
[19:09] that but my brother and sister we have

[19:46] read uh you know
[19:50] he he made a statement when it was all
[19:52] done turns out his family
[19:54] grandparents parents were extremely
[19:56] wealthy
[19:57] and in the end when they have said young
[20:00] man

[20:03] this is all yours
[20:04] right now at this moment has become
[20:06] yours and he said i would rather have
[20:09] them
[20:10] than this but do you realize saints when
[20:13] we receive this inheritance right here

[20:54] he can't build junk but we
[20:57] are his workmanship oh i'll tell you
[21:00] we shouldn't get a big head about it but
[21:02] we ought not walk around all mopey about
[21:04] what our life is
[21:06] amen whether we're short or tall skinny
[21:08] or chunky or whatever we might be
[21:11] super smart just average whatever we
[21:13] might be
[21:14] we are what god made us to be
[21:17] and what we ought not be looking as the
[21:19] outside of this flesh or the abilities
[21:21] of this
[21:22] or the thinking of the gray matter what
[21:24] we ought to be looking at is
[21:26] i am him amen i'm his workmanship
[21:30] he made me he poured a portion of
[21:33] himself
[21:34] out when he made me oh hallelujah
[21:38] thank you lord for we are his
[21:41] workmanship
[21:42] created did you catch now the little
[21:45] words here
[21:47] in scripture it's not my brother and
[21:50] sister
[21:50] all the big things it's the little ones
[21:52] we miss
[21:53] we were created not by him in him
[21:59] oh hallelujah created in christ jesus
[22:03] unto good works
[22:04] which god hath before ordained that we
[22:07] should walk
[22:08] in them oh look at this now what are we
[22:11] looking at
[22:12] uh incredible potential that god has
[22:15] laid in you and i
[22:17] then i i believe i'm just going to be
[22:18] bold tonight amen
[22:20] i'm older than i was on sunday so i'm
[22:22] just that much more bolder
[22:24] amen but look at this my brother and
[22:26] sister i don't believe we recognize
[22:28] the potential that god has placed in you
[22:32] and i
[22:33] i think we're catching a greater glimpse
[22:35] in a greater glimpse and a greater
[22:36] glimpse
[22:37] but my brother and sister there's so
[22:39] much more out here
[22:40] because you see as it is now i don't say
[22:43] this derogatory but as the prophet of
[22:45] god says you know what are we going to
[22:46] do we don't have faith enough for a
[22:48] toothache
[22:48] and it's going to take rapturing faith
[22:50] to get out of here
[22:52] you know what let's not get despondent
[22:53] let's not get discouraged
[22:55] let's say lord take me to rapturing
[22:57] faith amen that potential
[22:59] of protest uh possessing or expressing
[23:02] really is the word we should
[23:04] say that expressing of
[23:07] rapturing faith is in me amen i don't
[23:11] have to go out here and look at i don't
[23:12] need to go find some great evangelist in
[23:14] the message
[23:15] i don't need to go find the enlightened
[23:16] pastor or teacher or whatever and find
[23:18] it it's already
[23:20] rapturing faith is here let's let god
[23:22] peel the onion back
[23:24] let it peel it back lord peel it back
[23:26] because rapturing faith is in here
[23:28] and it will come because if he ordained
[23:31] us to this position
[23:33] then he let me be bold
[23:36] had to put rapturing faith in you
[23:39] had to he can't call you to this
[23:42] position
[23:43] and leave that ingredient
[23:46] out oh
[23:49] can someone give a real loud amen thank
[23:52] you lord it's in us saints
[23:54] i don't care what you felt like today or
[23:56] yesterday or
[23:57] or preacher monday or preacher wednesday
[24:00] amen
[24:01] none of that matters my brother and
[24:02] sister god was not
[24:04] negligent and left rapturing faith
[24:08] out of those he called to be his bride
[24:11] oh well let's not rest on our laurels
[24:14] we still have a work to do we still have
[24:17] a a
[24:18] life to live we have still an expression
[24:20] of god to bring
[24:21] forth but my brother and sister let the
[24:24] devil knock you down
[24:25] and push you around that oh my i have
[24:27] this and i have that and i can't this
[24:29] and i can't that
[24:30] it's in there lord reveal it
[24:33] hallelujah oh we ought to be praying for
[24:36] the revelation my brother wait the
[24:38] prophet told us to
[24:43] say minister that told me that no more
[24:45] revelation would come because the
[24:46] prophet of god was off the scene
[24:49] my brother and sister you want to talk
[24:51] about how deceptive things can be
[24:53] prophet's gone no more revelation
[24:56] prophet of god told me to pray for
[24:57] revelation
[24:58] i'm gonna say what the prophet of god
[25:00] said and i'm going to do what the
[25:02] prophet of god said
[25:03] and i'm going to just keep praying for
[25:05] revelation he didn't put on that pray
[25:07] for revelation until i'm off the scene
[25:10] now pray for revelation until something
[25:12] happens here something happens there
[25:14] he said pray for revelation amen and so
[25:17] that revealing that we just saw in this
[25:19] scripture
[25:20] when you pray for revelation you are
[25:22] praying for that to come to pass
[25:25] or praying for it as it were to continue
[25:28] to manifest
[25:29] in your life amen that's not praying for
[25:33] us to wake up in the morning and we've
[25:35] got a new deal that we all got to go up
[25:36] to table rock on a certain day and stand
[25:39] by the cross
[25:42] come on i had a brother share the
[25:43] testimony with me
[25:46] called to go to a certain hilltop a
[25:48] certain day and do that
[25:50] we'll get this when one of the families
[25:53] didn't show up and the sun rose and
[25:56] there was no rapture
[25:58] the preacher stood out and said now if
[26:01] anyone you want to be upset don't be
[26:02] upset at me
[26:03] it's this family who didn't come it's
[26:06] their fault
[26:08] because if they'd have been here the
[26:10] rapture would have took place
[26:12] pretty scriptural isn't it
[26:18] not in the bible i read amen
[26:22] well hallelujah so let's look at this
[26:25] and let's come with the expectation of
[26:28] the revelation the revealed
[26:31] amen that the word is talking about will
[26:33] come to pass in you and i
[26:35] amen because you see what he's done he
[26:37] has been molding us
[26:39] imagine now that we come in a time fiery
[26:42] trials now my opening scripture i didn't
[26:44] go on down further into those verses
[26:47] and it talks about how that the fiery
[26:49] trials coming
[26:50] the testing of our faith wait did you
[26:53] know this
[26:54] is not god punishing us this is not god
[26:58] uncaring this is god carving away
[27:01] everything that is hindering your
[27:04] potential
[27:06] oh hallelujah you know it reminds me of
[27:08] an athlete i've told the story here in
[27:10] the church i'll tell it briefly here
[27:12] tonight
[27:12] there was an athlete many years ago i
[27:14] forgotten his name now
[27:16] but he was well on his way to the
[27:18] olympics and a great
[27:20] runner and he uh tore i believe it was
[27:22] hamstring
[27:23] and uh so you know they said well you
[27:26] tore it so bad that you are
[27:27] you are um your running career is over
[27:31] and uh so he just he had a dream of of
[27:34] uh
[27:35] you know running in the olympics and he
[27:37] just was like that can't be
[27:38] i refuse to accept that and so as he
[27:41] healed up and all the physical therapy
[27:43] all the pain
[27:44] or everything associated with that he
[27:46] reached a place that he just couldn't
[27:48] quite qualify
[27:50] uh in in these great meets that were you
[27:52] know racing
[27:53] uh uh track meets that were coming and
[27:55] he couldn't quite qualify and
[27:57] and his coach told him he said um nope
[28:00] you you listen to the doctors you're
[28:02] done
[28:02] but this young man he he he just
[28:05] couldn't receive that so he went to
[28:06] another coach
[28:07] and um a a man that was renowned for his
[28:11] uh
[28:11] uh training of athletes and he went to
[28:14] him and the man said well i don't i
[28:16] really honestly
[28:17] i don't think you got it in you and
[28:20] uh this young man got upset and he said
[28:23] how can you judge me and he says well
[28:24] i've helped
[28:25] i've helped hundreds i've helped
[28:28] hundreds of
[28:29] young men and women make it to this
[28:33] and i just don't think you got it in it
[28:34] now when you read this story
[28:37] you have to catch the fact that this
[28:40] coach
[28:40] never once is talking about
[28:44] his injury
[28:47] oh come on saints i hope you're with me
[28:50] i've been so hurt
[28:52] i've been so hurt i've been hurt by
[28:53] ministry i've been hurt by this person
[28:55] i've been hurt by this i've been hurt by
[28:57] family
[28:58] the coach doesn't talk about injury he
[29:01] just tells him i don't think
[29:02] you've got it in you and the young man
[29:05] starting to say well how dare you say
[29:07] that
[29:07] and the coach said well if you want me
[29:11] to coach you you have to do what i tell
[29:13] you
[29:16] and he finally says yes i want to do
[29:18] this i'll do that
[29:19] so is there training the coach would
[29:21] tell him
[29:23] he said you're not you're not putting a
[29:25] hundred percent in it he'd tell him look
[29:27] i've been injured i'm
[29:28] he said look no you're not putting a
[29:31] hundred percent in
[29:33] and when he would run he'd tell him what
[29:35] you've got to do
[29:36] you're moving your shoulders and some of
[29:38] this i might not have it just right
[29:40] forgive me
[29:40] you're moving your shoulders but your
[29:42] shoulders are moving counter to your
[29:44] hips
[29:44] and you're actually hindering yourself
[29:49] and you're running in such a posture i
[29:52] don't remember if it's head forward or
[29:54] head back
[29:55] you're limiting yourself
[29:58] and the coach just keeps almost sounds
[30:00] like a pastor
[30:02] he just keeps picking away at him
[30:06] and one day when he is run and his legs
[30:09] cramped up
[30:10] and he he's there he just he just
[30:13] finally
[30:14] the coach says you got to give more and
[30:16] he's i got no more to give and the coach
[30:18] tears into him
[30:19] and finally the young man just throws
[30:20] down and says i quit
[30:23] and the coach says i knew
[30:26] i knew oh imagine imagine brother sean
[30:30] the man would come and stand right in
[30:32] your face i knew you were a quitter
[30:38] and he got so angry how
[30:41] dare you call me a quitter i am not a
[30:44] quitter
[30:48] he says really you're not a quitter
[30:52] you look like a quitter and i just saw
[30:55] you quit
[30:57] and he got up in an anger but for the
[31:01] sake tonight i want to call it righteous
[31:02] indignation
[31:07] devil you called me a quitter you know
[31:10] how many times
[31:12] oh we don't have to raise our hands how
[31:15] many times
[31:16] we've said i'm done
[31:20] oh come on come on and you you know
[31:23] i i want to be an example pastor's
[31:25] supposed to be an example
[31:26] hallelujah amen this is times this is
[31:30] not
[31:30] edition look but it don't matter because
[31:34] you see
[31:35] something down inside and he got this
[31:38] young man
[31:39] so riled up amen
[31:44] and then he says will you listen to me
[31:45] now will you listen to me now
[31:49] and he said i'll listen do you know that
[31:52] young man went on to the olympics
[31:54] i don't remember exactly how he placed
[31:56] now but he won medals
[31:57] he won awards because you see he
[32:00] couldn't run the race the way he
[32:02] thought he should run he had to listen
[32:05] to a coach and when i reference the
[32:07] coach to being the preacher
[32:09] well we know who our real coach is amen
[32:11] the lord jesus christ amen
[32:13] so we have to listen we can't run this
[32:15] race our way we can't come
[32:17] and say well i'm doing just fine running
[32:18] it my way amen you see we're his
[32:21] workmanship
[32:22] so if he says put your head back and put
[32:24] your chest out
[32:25] and lift a hand up and praise the lord
[32:28] amen don't think that sticking your head
[32:30] down and shuffling along
[32:31] all slumped down in the depression is
[32:33] going to be the same then it'll work the
[32:35] same put your chest back and say
[32:37] amen i might have made mistakes but i
[32:40] am a child of god hallelujah that's how
[32:43] we run the race
[32:45] amen not by acting like we're defeated
[32:49] my dad told me many years ago when i was
[32:51] just a boy he said son
[32:53] when someone looks you in the face and
[32:55] says they're humble
[32:57] they're not because humble doesn't have
[33:01] to tell
[33:03] you that they're humble amen
[33:07] faith doesn't have to walk around and
[33:10] say i
[33:10] am a man of great faith no faith
[33:14] moves mountains amen faith
[33:17] moves even the heart of god
[33:20] oh hallelujah now you look at this now
[33:23] let me go back here
[33:25] and uh remember where i'm at and what
[33:28] i'm doing here tonight
[33:30] but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes
[33:32] were
[33:33] far far off were made nigh by the blood
[33:36] boy that's powerful blood for he is our
[33:39] peace hath made both one
[33:40] and has broken down the middle wall of
[33:42] partition between us amen i preached
[33:44] this just on sunday
[33:45] but i just had to bring this in it's
[33:47] actually in the lower verse here
[33:49] having abolished in his flesh to enmity
[33:51] even the law of commandments contained
[33:53] in ordinances
[33:54] for to make in himself of twain one
[33:57] new man so making peace amen so there's
[34:00] no
[34:01] secondary no third no forth no way amen
[34:04] it's all god hallelujah that's what the
[34:07] prophet of god said it's all god amen
[34:10] uh you might reconcile
[34:14] both unto god in one body by the cross
[34:17] having slain the enmity thereby
[34:19] and came and preached peace to you which
[34:22] were afar off unto them that were nigh
[34:24] for through him we have both had for
[34:27] through him
[34:27] we both have access by one spirit and to
[34:31] the father
[34:34] now therefore ye are no more strangers
[34:36] and foreigners but fellow citizens with
[34:39] the saints in other words you're part of
[34:40] the body
[34:41] and of the household of god amen and are
[34:45] built upon the foundation of the
[34:47] apostles
[34:48] now i want you to think about this my
[34:50] brother and sister we're now building
[34:52] and the apostles god had to lay a
[34:54] foundation
[34:55] under the apostles this is not the
[34:57] apostles foundation
[34:59] this is god's foundation that he set the
[35:02] apostles on
[35:03] amen and now we're brought to set upon
[35:06] that same foundation and are built upon
[35:10] the foundation of the apostles
[35:12] and prophets jesus christ himself being
[35:14] the chief cornerstone
[35:16] in whom all the building fitly framed
[35:18] together growth into a holy temple in
[35:21] the lord
[35:21] in whom also ye are builded together for
[35:24] a
[35:25] habitation of god through the spirit
[35:28] now as well look at this a habitation my
[35:31] brother and sister
[35:32] is the act of living in a place a place
[35:35] where
[35:35] someone lives the act of inhabiting
[35:39] inhabiting it
[35:42] occupancy a dwelling place
[35:48] synonyms occupancy occupation possession
[35:51] residency now look at this my brother
[35:54] and sister
[35:54] in whom you're building together for a
[35:57] dwelling place
[36:00] of god see it's not just a casual pass
[36:05] by thing
[36:06] it's not like the coffee shop it's not
[36:08] like the cafe
[36:10] this is a place where god said i'm going
[36:11] to come down and the foundation's
[36:13] correct
[36:14] the atmosphere is correct the doctrine
[36:16] is correct and those people that want to
[36:18] say well you know what we'd rather have
[36:20] a good spirit in our church and not
[36:21] worry about the doctrine
[36:23] if you want i'll show you where the
[36:24] prophet of god says you have no doctrine
[36:26] you don't have any faith in god
[36:28] amen so you have to have a correct
[36:31] doctrine
[36:32] and people say well rather have the
[36:33] right spirit and the wrong doctrine i've
[36:35] heard that so many times i want to
[36:37] scream in fact
[36:38] while back you might you guys thought it
[36:40] was a jet and a sonic boom in the valley
[36:42] that was actually paul out there on the
[36:43] phone screaming
[36:45] amen because my brother and sister when
[36:47] people think that we
[36:48] need to make the decision well i would
[36:50] rather have the right spirit
[36:52] and not worry about my doctrine i'm
[36:54] telling you my brother and sister the
[36:55] bride
[36:56] has the right spirit and she has
[36:59] the right doctrine amen
[37:02] oh i'm not saying against what the
[37:04] prophet of god said we know what he said
[37:06] but he was talking to the public my
[37:09] brother and sister
[37:10] and when it comes to christ speaking to
[37:12] his bride
[37:13] he's not going to say well you know what
[37:15] now i'm going to use to use a radical
[37:16] example
[37:17] he's going to say you know what
[37:18] sweetheart bride of mine the bride of
[37:20] christ
[37:21] amen you are so loving you are so kind
[37:23] and you really don't look that bad in
[37:25] that miniskirt
[37:28] oh come on saints come on
[37:32] they may as well be saying that because
[37:35] doctrine
[37:36] well it leads to all kinds of things my
[37:38] brother and sister
[37:39] because a wrong doctrine will come in
[37:42] and lay the wrong
[37:43] foundation and if christ is resting on
[37:46] the foundation that was laid for the
[37:48] apostles
[37:49] actually preached out by the apostles
[37:51] for the bride of christ and we've got
[37:53] another foundation
[37:55] what kind of building are we going to
[37:57] have amen
[38:03] one of our landlords has remodeled their
[38:05] farmhouse
[38:07] they were showing me a few days ago
[38:10] how that they added the porch into the
[38:14] house
[38:15] many years ago probably 35 years ago
[38:18] they added the front porch into the
[38:19] house and make the bedrooms bigger
[38:22] they said they never gave it much
[38:24] thought years ago when they added the
[38:25] porch
[38:26] into the house but now they wanted to
[38:29] put down this
[38:30] hardwood floor but the porch
[38:34] goes like this
[38:37] and they never noticed
[38:43] i'd rather have the right spirit
[38:48] good you can be happy in that house but
[38:50] if you want to put hardwood on the floor
[38:51] you're going to have a hard time
[38:54] god's got a good foundation it's square
[38:57] it's level
[38:58] it's plumb amen it don't need an excuse
[39:02] hallelujah how did we get on that
[39:05] subject
[39:07] amen what are we we'll build it together
[39:09] for a habitation
[39:11] a living place of god we're not here
[39:15] just simply to press through life good
[39:17] days bad days
[39:19] struggles hope we make it
[39:22] oh my come on you see an empty house has
[39:26] potential
[39:28] but it can't say it's occupied that's
[39:30] right
[39:32] that's why the scripture says that when
[39:34] those spirits are cast out if that house
[39:36] is not
[39:37] filled then those spirits return and see
[39:40] that the house is empty go and get
[39:42] seven others like them because the house
[39:46] that's empty
[39:47] is a house that has potential but it is
[39:51] not
[39:51] what it was called to be
[39:57] reminds me some people one time i read
[39:58] this story
[40:00] on the internet so of course it was true
[40:06] but there was a house that was built in
[40:09] a subdivision
[40:10] i believe this is down in texas
[40:15] and someone spread a story about how
[40:17] that house was built over a grave or
[40:20] something like that and
[40:21] they spread this story with such
[40:23] conviction
[40:25] that the house did not sell and did not
[40:27] sell and did not sell and did not sell
[40:29] but enough conviction also no one would
[40:31] rent the house
[40:34] and it took someone from out of town who
[40:36] moved in
[40:38] and he come and they were driving around
[40:40] and they find this house
[40:41] the yard is kind of weedy house has
[40:43] obviously not been painted for a few
[40:45] years but yet it never been occupied
[40:48] and they asked a realtor and the realer
[40:50] just said you don't want to do that that
[40:52] house is haunted
[40:54] now these people were christians and
[40:56] they approached this and
[40:58] i i liked their approach and i i've
[41:00] thought about this more than once and
[41:01] i've encouraged an individual one time
[41:03] that was tormented in a house they were
[41:05] living in
[41:06] and these people were christians and
[41:08] they said so why is it haunted well
[41:10] when they were digging the foundation
[41:12] the crawl space they found a grave or
[41:14] whatever and
[41:14] and nobody's ever lived in the house and
[41:16] nobody will rent it it's just set this
[41:18] way for
[41:19] several years and the man said we'll
[41:21] take it because it was a bargain price
[41:23] and they said sir you're making a
[41:24] mistake and he said no we're not
[41:28] we're not making a mistake
[41:31] and the realtor was invited to these
[41:33] people's first
[41:35] night in their home they had a party
[41:36] that evening the realtor was invited
[41:39] nice nice people and uh
[41:42] about halfway through the party the
[41:45] the man and his wife and children they
[41:47] all stopped and were silent and said now
[41:49] we're going to commit this house
[41:53] and the realtor is a little
[41:54] uncomfortable like what are you doing oh
[41:56] we're just going to pray
[41:58] they just gathered around the house
[42:00] opened the bible
[42:02] read a scripture and bound every
[42:06] spirit and went right on and lived in
[42:10] the house
[42:11] now the realtor later come and says if
[42:13] you guys ever had any issues or anything
[42:15] like that he said
[42:16] no and there never will no because you
[42:19] see
[42:20] we bound it amen and we believe the
[42:22] scripture that whatever we have bound
[42:24] is bound amen my brother and sister we
[42:28] need a sure
[42:29] foundation we need to be able to say
[42:31] when the word says we
[42:32] bound that spirit it's bound we're not
[42:35] saying lord bind this spirit i mean like
[42:37] i hope you would bind this fear
[42:39] or maybe you could bind this spirit but
[42:42] you see my brother and sister the
[42:43] potential
[42:44] that resides in the bride of christ is
[42:47] not an ability that i have in me
[42:49] or an ability you have in you it is our
[42:52] ability to believe
[42:54] the word and let the word come out of
[42:58] us and the word says bind the spirit
[43:01] they believed it they bound the spirit
[43:03] and lived you might say happily ever
[43:05] after in the home
[43:06] and god prepared that house for them
[43:08] because they bought it for a fraction of
[43:10] the market
[43:10] amen and everybody was so afraid if
[43:13] they'd been a real christian in their
[43:14] neighborhood they'd went up there laid
[43:16] hands on that house and said we bind
[43:17] every devil and we've got a cheap house
[43:19] but it took someone from out of town
[43:21] that wasn't all caught up in the local
[43:24] church atmosphere
[43:29] oh my god yes sir
[43:32] well hallelujah we're fishing
[43:35] amen now look in identification
[43:38] i gotta hurry right along where does the
[43:40] time go saints
[43:42] i had a hired man today he was tired and
[43:44] he he told me he says
[43:46] paul he said i'm gonna go home and i
[43:47] said you can't go home it's too early he
[43:49] says no go look at the clock i turned it
[43:52] forward
[43:55] he said but don't worry i'll turn it
[43:56] back in the morning
[44:00] then see god come down and the character
[44:03] of god was
[44:04] christ he was the reflection he
[44:07] was god made visible
[44:11] amen amen notice god made visible
[44:15] in the beginning was god he wasn't even
[44:17] god then no god is an
[44:19] object of worship only thing he was was
[44:21] the eternal
[44:22] and in him was attributes and those
[44:25] attributes were thoughts and those
[44:26] thoughts
[44:27] was expressed to words and word was made
[44:30] manifest now why does it bother people
[44:33] when you start preaching about the word
[44:35] being made manifest my brother and
[44:37] sister
[44:37] i'll tell you why it bothers them
[44:39] because it does not fit in the
[44:41] intellectual conception of the message
[44:44] the intellectual conception of the
[44:46] message is the prophet said it i believe
[44:48] it but what do you believe
[44:51] because if the prophet said it he was
[44:53] speaking the word
[44:54] unless you're in a cult he was speaking
[44:58] the word
[44:59] and the word has to be manifested and
[45:04] the word has to come
[45:05] to fruition oh hallelujah
[45:09] so you know it's better just to put on
[45:11] the the suit and the tie
[45:13] right amen reminds me of a story i just
[45:15] read recently a man robbed a place
[45:17] all he did to get in the place to rob it
[45:19] was put on a tux
[45:20] and a tie and act like he was a waiter
[45:24] when the party was going on he just
[45:26] climbed right up the people's stairs and
[45:28] stole
[45:28] all their jewels walked right back down
[45:31] kept serving
[45:32] food to the people finally slipped out a
[45:34] side door and walked away
[45:39] my oh my
[45:44] go study
[45:48] we'll save that for another time
[45:53] it's already time to dismiss
[45:58] and in him was attributes and those
[45:59] attributes were thoughts and those
[46:01] thoughts were expressed to words and the
[46:02] word was made manifest what is it
[46:05] it's all god amen
[46:08] oh divide it up well it's a holy ghost
[46:10] it's christ it's this
[46:11] it's that come on let's get down to the
[46:13] fact it's all god
[46:15] becoming tangible and you
[46:19] are just a thought of god
[46:22] no you are a part
[46:26] hallelujah and jesus come to redeem
[46:28] those that was put on the lamb's book of
[46:30] life before the foundation of the world
[46:32] it was in god's thoughts and that's what
[46:34] he's come to redeem
[46:35] and them as soon as it strikes to them
[46:38] they see it oh it's not as soon as they
[46:42] reason it
[46:43] out and not as soon as they've studied
[46:45] it out not as soon as they've got quotes
[46:47] to back it up
[46:52] come on my brother and sister you know
[46:55] we i'm gonna
[46:56] i'm just gonna get rough for a moment we
[46:59] got people around the country
[47:01] that unless you can hand them a quote
[47:04] they won't believe it now i'm sorry my
[47:07] brother and sister the prophet of god
[47:08] did not preach the whole bible
[47:12] amen there's scriptures
[47:15] there's scriptures my brothers and
[47:16] sisters the prophet of god never touched
[47:19] so do we put them on the shelf because
[47:21] we don't have a quote to go with them
[47:23] no sir the word has continuity and
[47:25] revelation takes you to all of the word
[47:28] amen
[47:32] it was in god's thoughts and that's what
[47:33] you come to redeem and then as soon as
[47:35] it strikes to them they see it because
[47:37] the life
[47:38] is in there but if the life isn't in
[47:41] there
[47:42] then what can they do see they don't see
[47:46] it
[47:46] they'll never see it amen oh my this
[47:49] sees it takes it beyond
[47:50] now that's a little blunt but it takes
[47:52] it beyond my brother and sister i
[47:54] don't remember where the iq levels are
[47:56] but it takes it beyond whether your iq
[47:58] was 50
[47:59] or it was 200. i think 50 means that you
[48:02] probably are handicapped
[48:05] 200 means you're a genius but you see
[48:07] it's not it's not counting on that
[48:10] and it's not a matter of i can lift up
[48:12] 300 pounds
[48:13] or i can barely lift up 50. it doesn't
[48:15] matter
[48:17] and it doesn't matter if we're good
[48:18] looking do you know the only time that
[48:20] good looking matters
[48:24] is when you look in the mirror
[48:30] mirror mirror on the wall yeah
[48:35] yeah come on saints look let's have a
[48:38] little humor
[48:39] amen i won't go there i have
[48:44] actually a tremendously funny story but
[48:45] it's not appropriate so
[48:48] for this thought i mean but if the life
[48:52] isn't in there
[48:53] then what can they do see they don't see
[48:55] it they'll never see it see
[48:57] and the whole thing as jesus said at
[48:59] that day you'll know that i'm in the
[49:00] father the father and me
[49:02] i in you and you
[49:05] in me the whole thing is god
[49:10] becoming material
[49:14] wow look at this i am the potential
[49:18] you are the potential of
[49:21] god in the flesh oh hallelujah you ought
[49:24] to get somebody
[49:25] excited tonight amen it's not just well
[49:28] there's some spiritual people here some
[49:30] spiritual people there
[49:31] it's only for a prophet no my brother
[49:33] and sister this
[49:34] is for you and i amen
[49:37] we are in god and he is in us and if you
[49:40] can
[49:41] separate those then that person is not
[49:43] saved
[49:46] come on if you can separate them
[49:49] put god to the side and the individual
[49:51] to the side then that person is not
[49:53] saved
[49:54] because when they are saved the holy
[49:56] ghost comes down and they become
[49:59] even the very physical material of jesus
[50:03] christ
[50:03] on the earth oh that's what the word of
[50:06] god said that's what the prophet of god
[50:07] said
[50:08] amen the whole thing is god becoming
[50:10] material like a husband and a wife
[50:12] becoming one
[50:14] now look i'll tell you what i'm going to
[50:15] make an offer to the church if any of
[50:17] you
[50:17] sitting in the church here or that would
[50:19] hear this tape would say well me and my
[50:21] husband or me and my wife are not one
[50:24] then i'm more than willing to spend
[50:25] however many hours going through the
[50:27] scripture with you
[50:28] to show you've got a serious flaw in
[50:30] your marriage
[50:31] come on if you're living as it is two
[50:34] separate entities in the same
[50:36] house then you have a spiritual
[50:40] separation from god because he typed the
[50:44] church
[50:44] to a husband and a wife and you cannot
[50:47] be separated as husband and wife
[50:49] and say we are connected to god well
[50:52] that'll quiet a church down
[50:54] hallelujah come on if we're in a place
[50:57] where we think we're separated as
[50:58] husband and wife
[50:59] then we need to find an altar husband
[51:01] and wife both and we get down to that
[51:04] altar
[51:04] and we break through we'll get up and
[51:06] recognize that before the
[51:08] foundation of the world god knew that
[51:10] you would marry that individual
[51:12] and knew that it would be for your
[51:13] benefit even if you want to choke him
[51:15] over this upper table
[51:18] like husband and wife becoming one
[51:20] together god
[51:22] and his church becoming one oh
[51:25] hallelujah
[51:26] look at the potential saints look what
[51:29] we have hallelujah
[51:32] oh my now look i want to hurry along
[51:34] when it fell upon luther
[51:36] no no there's that bad m word then
[51:41] it manifested that promise of that hour
[51:43] when it fell upon wesley it manifested
[51:46] the promise of that hour
[51:48] when it falls in this day it manifests
[51:50] the promise of
[51:52] this hour when it fell on moses it
[51:55] manifested the promise of
[51:56] that hour fell on noah manifest the
[51:58] promise of that hour
[52:00] when it fell upon jesus it manifested
[52:02] the promise of that hour
[52:03] see it's the holy spirit coming down
[52:07] to quicken make alive those people
[52:11] that's for ordained
[52:13] of god to be in the rapture look
[52:16] that quickening is not just hallelujah
[52:22] no alive alive that means you get up in
[52:25] the morning and the same thing that made
[52:27] you excited tonight
[52:28] will make you excited in the morning
[52:30] we'll make you excited in the afternoon
[52:32] we'll make you excited when you're
[52:33] standing in a mud hole with mud up to
[52:35] your knees
[52:36] and you got problems and things have
[52:37] broken broken broke and this and that
[52:39] and whatever
[52:40] my brother and sister it'll still be the
[52:42] same thing you can stop and say today
[52:43] was a terrible day but
[52:44] thank you lord for saving my soul
[52:49] oh hallelujah
[52:52] now i hope i don't embarrass y'all okay
[52:54] because like i told you i'm getting
[52:55] older
[52:58] my filter broke and i just have to say
[53:01] it like i see it
[53:04] you see when it fell on jesus
[53:08] it manifests the promise of our holy
[53:10] spirit coming down to quicken to make
[53:11] alive
[53:12] those people amen isn't it strange god
[53:14] always puts those quantifiers in there
[53:16] so there's just those people who are
[53:18] those those people
[53:19] anybody know those people
[53:23] amen amen oh my
[53:28] that's for ordained of god to be in the
[53:30] rapture notice that is
[53:31] if he's a true eagle he'll under will
[53:34] understand the message of the
[53:35] hour if he's a true eagle
[53:39] amen you know south america
[53:42] they have we went to a youth deal
[53:46] what was that far down city we went and
[53:48] did
[53:50] and go and they've got what was that
[53:52] rock called
[53:54] eagle rock needles nasty eagle rock
[53:56] something like that
[53:58] and did you know in that area they have
[54:00] an eagle
[54:02] oh i hope you catch this they've got an
[54:04] eagle
[54:06] great big feet with claws great big
[54:09] wingspan
[54:13] and one of the brothers told me says
[54:14] brother paul if you see this eagle
[54:18] you won't recognize him i said why i
[54:21] think i know what an eagle looks like
[54:23] well they call him an eagle but he's
[54:25] really
[54:26] a buzzard
[54:33] wow now let's
[54:37] read this again so we can get this right
[54:41] that notice that is if he is
[54:46] a true ego
[54:52] he will understand the message of the
[54:53] hour if he's
[54:56] a true eagle not an eagle buzzard
[55:03] now the little eagle probably in the
[55:05] barnyard was eating all right
[55:06] but he knowed it wasn't just exactly
[55:08] right but when he heard the truth
[55:10] then he received this truth now in john
[55:12] 14 uh
[55:14] 89 john 5 24 rather jesus said speaking
[55:18] this way
[55:18] he that heareth my words and believeth
[55:22] on him that sent me
[55:23] half everlasting life and shall not come
[55:26] into the judgment
[55:27] but is past past from death and to life
[55:30] just think how simple that is
[55:34] come on saints are you with me just how

[56:37] believeth on him they send me half
[56:38] everlasting life and shall not come in
[56:40] the judgment
[56:41] but his past from death and to life just
[56:43] think how simple that is
[56:45] he that believeth now the correct way
[56:49] of saying that hmm
[56:52] amen he that understandeth
[56:56] it now look how that goes my brother and
[56:59] sister
[57:00] now are we turning it no i'm saying just

[57:31] believeth on him that sent me
[57:33] hath present tense eternal life
[57:36] shall not come into the judgment but has
[57:38] already passed from death

[58:15] it is it is
[58:20] the potential or the earnest of you
[58:24] being quickened from mortal
[58:26] to immortality oh my brother and sister
[58:30] look what god's doing
[58:31] he opened his word he's given it to us
[58:33] he's already poured the potential into
[58:36] us now we're seeing with eyes
[58:39] that are clear the potential
[58:42] of who we are

[1:00:32] and has come upon you it
[1:00:35] is the potential of your eternal
[1:00:37] inheritance that god
[1:00:39] thought of you and made for you
[1:00:44] before the foundation of the world that
[1:00:46] is
[1:00:47] your potential oh hallelujah what god
[1:00:51] put down
[1:00:51] you might say on the books is your
[1:00:54] potential not what you think

[1:01:01] down
[1:01:02] is your potential somebody say amen
[1:01:06] really loud
[1:01:07] hallelujah you see here's the problem we
[1:01:10] have now this is where we start to
[1:01:11] struggle

[1:01:19] this this and this

[1:01:28] acorn now but you have to wait till it
[1:01:30] grows up
[1:01:31] so do we when you receive the holy
[1:01:33] spirit of god it's god's potential
[1:01:35] waiting upon you
[1:01:36] that's already oh hallelujah can i be a
[1:01:41] pentecostal tonight

[1:01:50] down the streets of this nation
[1:01:52] it recognized me
[1:01:55] oh hallelujah he didn't pass me over and
[1:01:58] said whoa
[1:01:59] i lost one somewhere oh it
[1:02:02] recognized me hallelujah
[1:02:08] and you're sealed by the spirit of
[1:02:10] promise of god into the body of christ
[1:02:12] when god looked down at calvary and see
[1:02:14] jesus dying
[1:02:16] he not only he died for his bride
[1:02:19] the body which is the word church
[1:02:22] [Music]
[1:02:26] why do we take it back to the word
[1:02:27] [Music]
[1:02:28] because we're a word church
[1:02:31] amen hallelujah
[1:02:38] [Music]
[1:02:42] the church that believes the word of god
[1:02:44] for the age
[1:02:45] whether it's feet body head or whatever
[1:02:48] it is see
[1:02:49] it's christ it's christ was bleeding and
[1:02:52] dying and god
[1:02:53] looking upon him and saw his
[1:02:55] resurrection
[1:02:57] and the church was raised with him
[1:03:01] on easter hallelujah
[1:03:04] i'm not trying to make a doctrine nobody
[1:03:06] here there or yonder get upset
[1:03:08] and try and twist what i'm saying but
[1:03:10] sayings i'm already resurrected
[1:03:13] if the prophet of god said if you're in
[1:03:16] him now
[1:03:17] then you had to be in him then and if
[1:03:19] you're not in him now you wasn't
[1:03:22] in him then amen so what is it
[1:03:25] it's a finished work it's a finished
[1:03:28] work at calvary my brother and sister
[1:03:31] and here we are the word of god spoken
[1:03:34] by the words of a prophet
[1:03:35] telling that he already raised amen
[1:03:39] in the resurrection and the church
[1:03:41] raised with him
[1:03:43] hallelujah now if you're already raised
[1:03:46] up i want to ask you what are you
[1:03:47] letting something stop
[1:03:49] your potential god help us
[1:03:52] to reach out and take a holds of that
[1:03:55] i got a friend that's an electrician and
[1:03:58] he's been shocked by 110
[1:04:01] 220 and 440
[1:04:05] which wasn't his fault someone else
[1:04:07] shoved wire down a conduit and shoved it
[1:04:09] right into a live panel
[1:04:11] and the end of it was right there coiled
[1:04:13] around his feet
[1:04:15] lit him up put him in a hospital
[1:04:20] he's got quite a sense of humor my
[1:04:22] friend
[1:04:22] [Music]
[1:04:24] he said you want to know the secret of
[1:04:26] the difference
[1:04:28] of 110 220 and 440.
[1:04:34] he said really nothing they're all a
[1:04:37] shocking
[1:04:38] experience
[1:04:40] now my brother and sister i say that
[1:04:42] with a little humor tonight
[1:04:44] but if we'll just reach out and grasp
[1:04:47] the potential of what god has given to
[1:04:49] you and i
[1:04:50] as believers of his word you will find
[1:04:54] it will be a shocking experience
[1:04:58] and you'll never say oh i feel a little
[1:05:01] nervous and embarrassed you'll never do
[1:05:02] that
[1:05:03] because once you've come in his presence
[1:05:04] you're going to say i don't care what
[1:05:05] the whole world
[1:05:06] no no another rest this even matters
[1:05:08] when i see the whole plan of god and who
[1:05:10] i
[1:05:11] am and what he did from the very
[1:05:12] beginning and the fact that
[1:05:14] oh if i had just an example tonight hey
[1:05:16] you know he just took in his
[1:05:18] and said here here is this brother
[1:05:20] here's his sister and now i'm
[1:05:22] pouring in the potential what is that
[1:05:25] potential
[1:05:26] to be all that we needed to be to
[1:05:28] fulfill the word of god
[1:05:31] all that we needed to be to stand before
[1:05:33] the throne of almighty god one day

[1:05:37] marriage supper of the lamb
[1:05:39] reading about the millennium the prophet
[1:05:40] of god talking about no it's not going
[1:05:42] to be like this
[1:05:43] it's going to be all burnt over and all
[1:05:46] cleansed there won't be
[1:05:47] one thing left that's not of god
[1:05:51] oh hallelujah do you realize saints
