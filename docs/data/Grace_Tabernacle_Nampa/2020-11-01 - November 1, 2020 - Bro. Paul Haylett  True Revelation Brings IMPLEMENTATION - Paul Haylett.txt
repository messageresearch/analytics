manassa's surgery went very well we just want to pray that the recovery will be quick and we want to lift up sister sue this morning this move has put some added stress in her life but let's just pray lord just come and just just give her the strength that she needs and we don't want to forget grandma jerry if she's in the home and then that her light would be a shining light to those around her amen sister miriam's asked that we remember her as well as on tuesday she goes for colonoscopy just praying for a good report so let's just lift her up in prayer and sister olga asked remember a teacher at her school who has a coronavirus but also has asthma she's a little she's really worried so let's just pray for her and uh little ifa we want to remember her as on tuesday morning she has dental surgery so let's just lift these needs to our heavenly father you have a need this morning remember you're saved by grace amen he knows what you have need of he's our heavenly father amen so let's let's pray this morning but david if you'd come i just want to make a bit of an apology this morning to those that were here wednesday and i said some things that were seemingly a little bit jokey over the in the service and this is no place this pulpit is not a place for that the lord dealt with me about it concerning tim and i've talked to tim about that and we have an understanding but it's just that if you were offended if i offended anyone forgive me the lord dealt with me about that i want everything right absolutely and i think it just shows on this old outside man i think god just loves to show and test his children and shows grace what an opportunity to say thank god for grace as power heads our heavenly father i'm thankful that you knew us before the foundation of the world and could seal us in yourself for the work was finished before the world began we were in our savior tied there and rose victoriously over sin we're thankful for the seal that's been opened to show ownership lord that we are secure we are your children that lord you you open that up in the last hour lord to show us that we are eternally yours and father secured to our destination [Music] and it's a finished work and how we rejoice and give praise to you for this lord our heart rejoices that we're able to come here this morning by your mercy and by the strength of your holy spirit thank you for revelation thank you for revealing your word by your spirit as you said you would just as we have need of it we're so thankful for the truth lord for you should we would know you personally we'd know the truth and the truth would make us free we thank you for this now as we lift up these needs before you these requests it's been requested lord their parts didn't done and it's finished they've requested it showing faith in your word now we in part let life lord as you told us that we would to believers that lord you're working in and through your bride and so father we're thankful that we're come here in this earth for one purpose that jesus we believe we've come down where the word was in heaven [Music] lord to do the will of our father our husband now father we just bring these needs our sister marian's need need of that little ellie lord having that dental surgery the need of our brother sergey on the road lord the our thankfulness that you brought manasseh through that surgery we ask you to just bring a complete recovery to that knee and lord others that have been spoken needs that they're here lord i know unspoken i know of our brother paul spoken of unspoken requests and and different things that we have need of we are thankful and we have access to you by one spirit we have access to that place that we can call on you lord that we have absolute lord the confidence that we come before you at any time in your name and have access to the throne we're thankful that lord we have mercy we're so grateful for mercy now lord we just commit these needs if i've forgotten any lord you know about it you lay it on someone's heart out there that didn't and so father we just expect to receive from you we expect to receive through a man and father what you have us to receive and to know for you said my sheep hear my voice my sheep are able to receive my voice a stranger they're not going to follow and here's your prophecy only of the elect lord we're so thankful that positive token that identifies us in you how grateful for that token lord for it's written it's no longer i living but christ that worketh in me and i'm so thankful for that now lord have your way bless this offering as is taken as we ask these things in the holy name of our lord jesus christ giving thanks that we have received it and expect it to be manifested we give you praise amen amen oh god bless you once again good to have you here and those on the in online maybe just joined us god bless you good to have you and uh we don't want to forget this week with sister olga's birthday some of us got together last night just had a little dinner with her and wish her happy 60th birthday so god bless you sister oh god amen you're definitely you've definitely won our hearts so god bless you my sister jerry has a song versus why you come sister jerry [Music] so i slipped through [Music] i locked so much to see i saw my hero steven paul and timothy but before my breath could find the words i heard them speak to me are you she the bride of the lastest who stood the worst of times so many slipped away here's your crown take your place beside the christ is now your very own is this a special chosen one we see are you sure it was the worst of all the ages they continued to say [Music] how did you live a christian life in such a godless day question after question [Applause] my heroes lifted me [Music] then i heard a voice behind me whisper tenderly this is she the pride of the last days who stood the worst of times when so many slipped away take your place beside the throne i am now your very own this is the special chosen one we see this is shape these trials that you're facing may seem so big and tall and when we hear the master speak [Music] you are she the pride of the last days you've stood the worst of times when so many slipped away take your place beside the throne christ is now your very own you are the special chosen one we see you are she praise god as we get ready to turn the service to brother paul let's sing 1009 winds of faith [Music] you can take [Music] one by side one by faith [Music] take the word of god what you believe is what will be way to the winds of faith you can fly [Music] it's my praise set your ways to the winds of faith watch your needs [Music] my [Music] it will burn or you will fly [Music] in a higher place it's my grace to the winds of faith now watch the ego in the sky he does not struggle he [Music] the does that makes him rise it's already in the winds you can fly in a higher place [Music] do not struggle [Music] foreign [Music] is already in you amen we just need to learn to exercise that faith amen and so beautiful beautiful to be here today amen i trust that your last week has been good amen i uh i just want to say that god has been very gracious to me gave me two different opportunities this last week to witness a man named chris a lady named sarah just a time to open doors that you never imagined would be open to be able to step in with a boldness and there be a spirit there that the people just stop no argument no contesting just listening and you know our prayer is see i believe my brother and sister if we have the right attitude concerning the word we'll never go out now we know this message is life but we won't go out saying you have to come to my church i believe that's the wrong attitude myself i believe we point them to christ amen and he's the one that said i'll lead you and guide you to all truth so if we can get them to look to christ then god will place them positionally amen but if we're not careful we want to convert them or or get them to our way of thinking we want want you to come you need to be a part of my church let's get them to christ amen that will make all the difference amen so happy today you know i don't always i maybe should be more interactive forgive me saints but see our brother william if i understand correct he wasn't feeling well uh god's put him in the house of god this morning thank you lord sister sophie sister grace uh we're feeling well amen praise the lord god's gracious to us amen you know saints i i hope i i'm not distracting you by this but it was my prayer and little confidence that i had and i i think i shared this the other day this lord you'll you'll take us through our church will be spared coveted that was just where i stood our church will be spared coveted but god says i got a better plan i'll let covid come all the way through your church and i'll still spare you i'll still put my hand upon you i'll keep you hallelujah right you see as that song says he never said that we would never be hungry or cold or disappointed or any of those things as it is he said but i'll be right there with you oh hallelujah look saints well to thank the lord we see across the nations many people my brother and sister have lost their life many people have spent weeks and some even into months in the hospital because of those things and god comes right down in our midst amen said i i'm gonna i'm gonna let you oh i'm gonna get so sidetracked this morning i'm gonna let you go ahead and walk into that furnace but you don't fear because i've got a plan amen i have sealed you to the day of your redemption i've got a plan don't fear just trust me hallelujah don't you thank the lord for that this morning amen well speaking on our thoughts amen we want to speak on uh true revelation brings implement i struggle to say this word forgive me implementation hallelujah amen now that's in big letters my brother and sister because you study brother branham talks about true revelation he doesn't under those words have a great expanded explanation because we can simply stop and say true revelation and i think we comprehend what that is versus just any old revelation versus a revelation that's not true so true revelation brings implementation amen in other words if you really have a revelation it's going to bring some kind of action in our life hallelujah amen let's uh as we stand i just want to um announce that we are having communion and foot washing this coming sunday uh at 5 00 pm i didn't really look at what the date is on that um 8th on the 8th of november we are having communion and foot washing and i want to apologize that we have been so long without communion and foot washing i kept thinking well when we get the basement straightened up but we've had all kinds of distractions and all kinds of things come through and the basement's not finished but that's not going to keep us from stepping into what god asked us to do amen so the sisters will be upstairs discussing it with some of the brothers it doesn't matter if we get dusty we whatever we'll go right down and we'll have our foot washing in the basement just like always you see it wasn't about what we come to show our fine robes it wasn't our own righteousness we come to show off amen it's him it's always been him it will always be him amen sister jerry and i would just like to say to you thank you so much for your kind words your appreciation your gifts very humbling i have to say if you really knew me you probably wouldn't have said those words but it's by god's grace and only by his grace that we can be what we are this old nature i'm not talking to you but it might be people like you can be contentious and grouchy and argumentive and all these kind of things but you see god come down and says the real you oh let me explain to you the real you you see saints just let me express it this way we're on this side looking at the cross but did you know the real you is on this side looking back into what we call time and the real us is looking back and saying i see who i am i see what god called me for i see the provision that was made and i can fulfill that and then we bypassed our theophany and god set us right down here in time and we're here through many struggles toils and snares i have already come and all of them that are still coming because i'm not looking at it from my flesh man i'm looking at it from this side i look back in time and say there is nothing that will keep me from fulfilling the calling in my life can we just give the lord a hand clap lord thank you nothing nothing amen hallelujah once again thank you for your kind words and gifts amen um i we appreciate that from the depths of our heart i i'll pass on before i start crying um let's turn in our bibles to john first john 1 amen you know as i was asking the lord i just was a little inspiration come and i said lord where do i bring this from or how do i bring this and sometimes you have an idea you have a thought and quite honestly you don't even have a scripture for it and you just have to say lord now where do you want me to go where do you want to start and how would you like to bring this about amen and i feel like the lord led me to first john 1. in the beginning oh that's john 1 brothers first john first john brothers amen i might have wrote it down wrong will be just a second saints well i'll just read that which was from the beginning which we have heard can someone say amen which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life now i want you to realize in that verse my brother and sister and we'll tie it together a little later but in that verse we are not talking about what this great man experienced what that great man experienced we're talking about what we have experienced too many people friend and foe of the gospel is looking back well this is what this is that's good i love lady i was witnessing two yesterday said well what what what verses what chapter in the bible or whatever it means the most to you and and i gave her the most convoluted answer that you could ever ever get well i love john 1 in the beginning was the word but i said i love the corinthians and i love romans because the apostle paul showed our life and the behaviors and the struggle and all of these things the correction by the word and then i love the book of revelation because it shows us what the beginning was and it shows us what the end is i said so i can't just pick one spot but as you well know revelations 19 6 7 8 9 means a lot to me because it declares that his wife hath made herself ready and i'm identified in the rest of the bible as his wife and that's a confirmation that i'm getting ready amen i i i the lord was very present there and sister jerry and i this lovely opportunity and so she didn't catch the fact that my answer was so convoluted it really didn't pick out one single scripture because you see verse is connected to verse which is connected to verse which is connected to verse and somebody said it was chapter whatever but you see you go right from in here looking at first john you look right from verse one verse two you don't make separation and when you get to into what we call the chapter the thought the continuity carries right on i'm sorry there's just no book in the bible that overrules the other book every book that was necessary for a bride is connected right here in what we call the bible amen oh hallelujah let me get started which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it amen not just someone telling us about this but we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ and these things right unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another now remember church i made a statement here recently in a service that the whole unity movement that is around people saying well we just need to come together we just need to come together we have no agreement we don't have same doctrines but we want you know we got to have this love we got to have this unity i'll take you right here to this scripture we've got to be walking in the light before the unity can come and when we walk in that light we can have fellowship not only with him but with one another so if you are walking and there is what i would call difference not just different understanding but difference i want you to think about this scripture because we can't walk in the light and embrace something that's not in the light amen some people think i'm trying to separate us no saints i'm sorry i have no hidden agenda i have no secret meaning to my words but as i was witnessing to this man named chris a man that had been a faithful in church and believed in the lord when he was young look me in the face and says my wife doesn't even know this but i believe god failed me boy that's worrisome except for i actually rejoiced because you see that was more than these double doors being wide open i was like here we go buddy are you ready we can go back to talking about seed and fertilizer and whatever else or we can go here and he's like go ahead go you see my brother and sister if we're not walking in complete light spirits like there seems to be a conflict spirits come in that say well there's no unity we have unity we have unity i've been united to jesus christ through his word amen sister jerry and i talking a little bit now don't misunderstand us i love every one of you but how many of us if it wasn't for this word of god in this hour would be sitting here this morning fellowshipping together we wouldn't even know each other in most cases and if we did we'd have enough personality conflict now i'm just going to be real blunt okay brother trevor and i believe are absolutely in unity you should have seen us we looked like a couple big horn rams on top of the mountain butting heads i don't say that negative to him i don't say that negative myself but you know what happens god comes down and deals with brother trevor god comes down and deals with brother paul and we both recognize our shortcoming and then we look at each other and i saw a whole different man but it wasn't because brother trevor changed that i saw a whole different man it was because god dealt with me and changed me and through looking through the lens of the revealed word are you with me now you know i just used brother trevor for an example we're not throwing him under any kind of bus or making any kind of example but but you see i just know we have this open relationship amen we just know we've had our times that we have vehemently disagreed with each other but what it is is god dealing with both of us and it didn't come down brother trevor submitted to my idea and it wasn't paul submitting brother trevor's idea we both submitted to the word there's where unity comes in the body of believers when we all submit ourself to the word amen now where was i if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another do we catch that we're going to be walking in the light to have real true fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourself and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us heavenly father we just asked for your guiding hand today father you know my heart's cries i i have uh lord this morning just tried to find your mind completely lord eliminate ourselves from it lord you know what i have said would have asked father just ask you to move in the midst of us the midst of this body of believers those that might be listening father let us come in a complete honest submitted fellowship with you lord lord no isms that's right no ideologies no preconceived ideas but lord just submitted to your word we ask you now to guide us today in the name of jesus christ amen hallelujah you may be seated now saints i have decided that the preaching time clock doesn't start until you're seated i want to just revisit the scripture here for just a few minutes so if we will go back to uh first john 1 1. uh look at this now my brother and sister i believe is believers we sit here today uh now we we can't go by those who say that you're crazy uh you can't go by those that have a different ideology my brother and sister let them go let them travel their path as our brother george smith says and i don't say this to throw this back on brother george but as brother george says and i like the phrase he said let them run their race we will run our race and then we will meet at the finish line amen so i'm not allowing someone else to to control what god has revealed or uh uh you might say brought to me you see that which from the beginning which we have heard did we not hear it the message the word come to us which we have seen with our eyes and my brother and sister i tell you today if i would deny what i have seen amen in these few short years of my life i you could declare me a crazy man i have seen the supernatural i have seen god come down on the scene and change situations in such a fashion that no one present believer or not could deny that something supernatural had just happened in their midst amen and we have looked upon it and our hands have handled of the word of life amen so the life was manifested now as we look at this my brother and sister i want to just expand on this i have used this word manifest manifested manifestation uh you know to my amazement there's been times in my life in using that that people were upset and some people think if you just simply say well okay i believe the message of the hour that is sufficient i'm sorry my bible and the message that i believe says there is a time and a place that there will be a manifestation and so in that my brother and sister this is not simply something for us to talk about it is not simply something and i will use this phrase lip service several times in the service so please don't feel like i'm being rude but it is not something for us simply to have lip service i remember as a young man really honestly backslid i gave up on the lord you know kind of felt you might say that the lord had failed something was wrong when i was about 15 years old and uh you know my brother and sister you can learn to say the right things young people you can learn to say the right thing and act in the right way though that will not change what is down in your heart i would encourage you from the very depths of my heart to you that you would either decide it's real or it's a lie and move from there amen because you go along in the realm of hypocrisy and all you do is compromise your own character of who you are now having said that i will tell you that until you come to a place that you truly have been moved by god anointed in the spirit uh this is kind of a blunt phrase forgive me but don't knock it until you have honestly tried it amen too people look at the things of god they look at the word of god and they say well i don't know i don't know i don't know well i had the courage bold my brother and sister as the scripture says that i just in this last few days i just spoke it out now i'm not lifting up paul i'm lifting up a boldness that god would place upon us to step upon a step over all thresholds and say you know what this is a word they need to hear the word we're not lifting ourselves up look to me look to me look to me or look to my church we're saying look to jesus christ this is the truth that if you have not truly from the depths of your heart try jesus christ as a solution to your life don't knock it don't say it's a lie don't say it's nothing you seem nothing is more wasteful than the superficial right i want you to think on that the superficial i always joke you know i can't do it anymore because i'm driving a ford but i always used to you know just harass people that drove forwards on that you know what was it just superficial banter a waste of time no i'm not talking about us sitting around and fellowship and saying something we had a laugh i i i promised i wouldn't throw anybody under the bus but we spent a little bit of time there with the little party they had for sister olga uh one of the sisters made a comment that i'm still busting up over when i think about it hey man you know you look at that and you think yeah okay i'm not talking about seeing some humor i'm not talking about enjoying a good laugh in life but i mean when we go day after day after day living a superficial life come on i did it for over 20 years of my life lived a superficial life oh you'll find something to fill that up the devil's got all kinds of things to offer up to you but he says for the life was manifested and we have seen it now the word manifest is saying abel this is webster online able to be seen clearly shown or visible easy to understand or recognize readily perceivable by the senses and especially by the sense of sight now look at the scripture what does it do for the life was manifested and we have seen it right god didn't hide it god didn't say i'm going to put it off and i'm going to make it so difficult for people to recognize that i am present that very few would see it no god openly placed you and i in this world openly to display jesus christ amen and for all that truly are looking upon and looking for christ they recognize that my brother and sister they recognize that because you see it goes on to use the word obvious and a synonym of evident you see this is what god is doing the life has been made obvious the life has been made evident the life is readily perceived the life is easy to understand the life has been clearly shown and is visible hallelujah we're not in a basket somewhere we're not in a corner we're not removed from this world god put us here made it real to you and i that our life would make it real to those around us can someone say amen to that and i use that because it goes on and there's quite a lengthy uh deal and this is in contrast to something that is vague you see mother and sister i'm going to speak direct today i hope i don't offend no one but for us to take a position that we just say well praise the lord i'll be in the rapture because i believe god sent a prophet is so vague it is so vague the word of god gives very clear-cut instruction to you and i of what it will take to be an overcomer in this day and to stand before that throne are you she i had no idea my wife was singing that song this morning are you she see it is not a vague thing that defines who the bride of christ is god's word is clear but many stay i don't see it the way you see it well you don't have to see it the way i see it but you need to see it this way because if you don't see it this way you have completely missed it amen amen i'm not too harsh am i okay that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that he also may have fellowship with us my that sounds very narrow right we're going to declare these things to you that you can have fellowship with us but you see real true fellowship i want to come back drive this home truly our fellowship is with the father see the fellowship is not with grace tabernacle the fellowship is not with brother so-and-so the fellowship is with the father and his son jesus christ amen that's where it's all connected together my brother and sister now i'm not pushing back against anything no one please misunderstand when the lord led me to this and did i actually had been reading and putting things together before it dawned on me really what this was saying because it was actually just a portion of this we'll get to in a minute that that really rung true at first but you realize all this fellowship has to become and brought down through one channel amen amen amen hallelujah and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full now my brother and sister sometimes we preachers can get a little adamant let me tell you it's not from a control freak issue it is of a heart burden to see people catch a full revelation of jesus christ it is not us trying to make anyone feel as though they were of a lesser understanding or promote someone of greater understanding but truly that we could come to a plane that we recognize our relationship with jesus christ your relationship with christ does not include this or that or that it's you and christ it's not you and the pope you say well we're not catholics of course that isn't but some people have raised their own pope up we'll leave that alone this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness now my brother and sister i hope this morning as we go brothers to verse six i hope this morning you will catch this because i'm going to put this to you in this point at this point there is failure to implement the word so we can all say oh praise the lord the light has come the latter's come god sent a prophet laodicean age this last stage and we can all say amen to that but there now comes a time of separation because uh we'll read quotes here in a little bit but the prophet of god talking about revelation and how it is affected in our lives and what it brings about and my brother and sister we can all use the vocabulary of revelation but there is a vast difference of the implementation of what revelation is amen and so as we look at this we're coming now into the place where implementation has uh it's failed to take place and i hope you follow me this is a message we've heard of him and declaring to you that god is light and in him there's no darkness i should ask the brothers to hide like this it's highlighted in my notes if we say i want you to catch this now what is it you know i love you okay nobody feel like i'm rubbing on you if we say all through the word of god god has allowed or caused people to declare their position and we live in an age we live in a time that god will cause you to declare your position amen if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth no implementation amen but if we walk in the light see the words come the light has come we recognize the the light is here and i now have opportunity to walk in that light i must choose to walk in that light or not right now i'm talking saints not just whether god sent a prophet we are way beyond that amen this is the word being made manifest in you and i we'll have to choose when the word is open to us you know how it is sometimes we can go for years with a certain idea and one day god comes and corrects that idea we have to stop and say will i accept the correction or not it should be instinctive that we would say lord forgive me and we move right into that but it's not always so maybe it's something that's very deep affects your life and then you struggle with that do i do i do this do i do this not i oh my goodness what do i do but you see my brother and sister if we say we have the fellowship and we are in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light amen as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another you see it's all relevant whether we make the decision as the light is moving now the prophet of god said that god never stops opening his word god never stops revealing himself amen it won't do us any good i was saved 40 years ago brother paul i believe this message for 40 years are you 40 years ago are you in the light that is here present today you have to decide what you're going to do i believe god sends a prophet that's wonderful that is one of the key elements but have you believe the word that he opened to our generation and that's what makes the difference amen and no any critic that might be listening i'm not bashing brother branham i believe with all my heart you'd stand right here and say that's absolutely the truth i come i open the word according to that but the word is still being revealed to you and i oh no that's not a new message some people when you start talking about the word being revealed to you are like oh my i've had it spoke to me oh my you are saying there's something beyond brother branham no i'm telling you that when god opened the word to this laodicean church age we didn't have a clue all that was in the word and it's still being open to you and i we are still seeing more and more and more of who we are because many of us were in that position that we were in a cycle and we would come lord i love you and in your heart you're speaking from the heart lord i love you and i believe you but then we would fail and it puts us right back in the start of the cycle again and over time the word of god shows us that man becomes tired of the repetition of forgive me lord forgive me lord and in that then they either give up entirely or they move into a mode of well god knows i'm just a sinner the spirit in the world today my brother and sister denomination now i don't recommend you go and listen to a lot of this honestly i don't please don't but my brother and sister the spirit in the world today is a behavior that is unchecked a behavior that is unchanged and their excuse in the cycle is to say well god knows i'm broken but i know a god that fixes things i know a god that doesn't leave us broken i know a god that comes and takes all the broken pieces and puts them together and in that he anoints that to be a vessel of honor not some broken patch together vessel that's not good for holding much more than dirt he says i will make you perfect if i hadn't had that bout of vertigo this last wednesday and i'm lord willing i'll preach it this coming wednesday talking about perfection it was the lead up to this but i still felt led to preach this amen but my brother and sister you see god doesn't look at you as the broken god looks at you as the perfect god looks at you as the righteous god looks at you as the holy yes right hallelujah you know if you're on the internet very much and and i i'm not really in one sense but you look and and you know there's an advertisement out there i don't remember the name of the stuff but they've got a glue now kind of some hybrid epoxy that literally they can take and glue a steel bar to a brick and drive over it with a car and can't break it well praise the lord that's me no it's not god said he'd take you back to the original you're not a vessel that's got all these little lines that are glued together not a vessel that's got all these little pieces that little chip here and a little chip there that's what we see in the flesh but i want to see you as god sees you oh brother paul wait how do we how do we reconcile this i just told you i'm perfect i just told you you're perfect but the word says if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us the lack of acknowledgement that it's because he's perfect that we're perfect the lack of acknowledgement that because he's righteous we're righteous the lack of acknowledgement because he is holy we can be holy remember what i preached to you last sunday you see we we've like the like that that statue uh what was michelangelo moses he knocks that chunk off of that that chunk even though removed was always a part of that statue and we be taken off of christ as the prophet of god showed us we are a part of him amen so if we say i want you to catch this i hope you catch this today if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and those truths not ends look what the counter type is it's been implemented now if we confess our sin oh my god aren't you glad saints i tell you there's days that i'm just like oh paul and then i remind myself go back to the court where brother branham says that we backslide daily wait a prophet of god he wasn't speaking about you he included himself in there he didn't remove himself exclude himself i'm perfect you're not you know that's why oh i'm gonna get sidetracked here but that's why the prophet of god right on tape for critic friend or foe to hear he talks about how the telephone rings and he just tells his wife tell him i'm not here sounds perfect to me you know what the perfection was that he could not live without making that not in his anointing of almighty god coming down on a vessel not brushing it under a carpet well you know the reason i behaved oh lord help me now i feel a little spiritual vertigo here oh lord help us help me lord to no longer make an excuse for the reasons i have excuses well if you knew what i've been through i'm preaching to myself so nobody get offended well hallelujah i know i have problems too my goodness i have problems but i went under the blood and i came out the other side and one of those things that washed away from me was my excuses i don't need him any longer i've got the blood i've got him amen so i can confess my sin he's faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us you see it comes down my brother and sister simply the implementation of the word of god in our life it's here it's in the open it's not hidden all we have to do is say there's the word and that hurt oh my come on i'm just going to be blunt this morning we might come to a place we stop and say oh lord the lust of the flesh the pride of life all of these things oh god that's me i'm affected by them the winds of laodicea blow against me lord and they sway me but i can confess i can confess oh god forgive me forgive me of everything that's not pleasing to you forgive me lord and he's faithful and just to forgive us oh hallelujah does that make you happy amen you see we don't need to come to the place if we say that we have not sinned there's no need for us to come to this place and say i was unable to implement the word of god in my life all we have to do is simply submit to the word and say lord i believe hallelujah now the word implement is to begin to do to use something a plan to make something active or effective to carry out or accomplish to have a practical effect to ensure an actual fulfillment by concrete measures you know what concrete measures not theory it's what it says right in webster not theory something solid hallelujah well i'll tell you i i found no need real estate's getting really expensive but i don't need to build my house on sand i'll pay the price to find me a rock and build my house on that rock hallelujah you see but people don't want to pay prices we live in a world my brother and sister that people are not willing to pay the price amen now a true revelation brings about an implementation we hear the word something in us response what is it the prophet god showed us clearly through the ages that's the holy ghost in you my brother and sister you cannot respond to the word of god if god has not anointed you to respond to it amen so the holy ghost in you moves you to say that's nothing but the truth see we couldn't do that on our own saints we couldn't do that but it's the holy ghost in you now oh this always gets so complicated doesn't it how that we could not necessarily be right with the lord and the holy ghost anointing us to respond people struggle with that well wait uh that man's got problems what do you mean the holy ghost no the word says if he didn't call you you won't come amen now remember when the prophet of god that man come to him and said brother brown i've been seeking the holy ghost i went over here i've went over there i went here i went there and i i don't know i don't seem to find the holy ghost brother branham uh you know how do i get the holy ghost when did one know and and brother branham's talking to him there and he says now when you read that little pamphlet the day that you started seeking god you read that little pamphlet what happened he said i knew i knew i had to serve god i knew how to brother brown says that's when he came to you not the man that's in church without a single problem just his life is perfect don't get silent saints you ought to be rejoicing right now hallelujah just as i am without one please oh let's not let satan make this message complicated amen let's keep this my brother and sister because you see the holy ghost in you is what moves you to say that's nothing but the truth and i tell you an amen from the heart is very powerful it doesn't have to be amen from the lips right you know the scripture says that you know your your lips how does that go your lips you speak of me but your heart is far from me hey man you see my brother and sister the lips don't mean much amen we've seen this men pleasers give lip service amen i don't want to get any more sidetracked here now in revelation 3 17 very familiar scripture to us right commission of our age of the laodicean church age what's the first words right there if we say because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked now this is the holy ghost speaking through john to become the written word to our day he says i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire so there's the counsel that he's giving he says that thou mayest be rich which is the counter of what they say they say i'm rich already but his counselor says you got to buy gold of me that thou mayest be rich amen so there's something it must be followed it must be implemented we can't just get that religious spirit any old place we got to come to god and get what would be the real religion hallelujah and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed in the shame of thy nakedness see we counter this with being naked up here of what they're saying see they say one thing but the reality is amen but he's now the holy spirit god through john speaking and says look if you'll get this white raiment the thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thy eyes with i salve that thou mayest see he turns right around after getting that direction on how to deal with it not what you say not what i say not what they say but what was the counsel given to us and he comes right behind that and says as many as i love i rebuke and chase and be zealous therefore and repent why because he knew every one of us saints would be guilty of those verses of that position of what we have said but he had grace and he had mercy upon us i don't need to go around and declare well i'm righteous i'm holy i'm this i'm that my brother and sister i'll let the word i hope you're with me this morning i'll let the word that is in me do the speaking for me now god might use your voice might use my voice will use your life will use my life but the word that is in you will speak it cannot be held silent if we say amen now look at this oh i don't want you to get discouraged today saints look at this we have heard have we not gone back to first john there we have heard and we heeded the council amen that will be one of the things that separates this bride even from the church is that she's heeding the council she's listening he said i need to get my riches my gold my self-worth my value in this life from him i can't go out here and get it my accomplishment i can't get it out here in the life that i live i can't give it out here no matter how much i have seen i can't get it there now look at this when this little bride acted upon this council of uh uh uh uh of the word here amen as it was stirred you might say uh by this council there has to be a vindication now here again i don't mean to be offensive there's some people have different views on this that's fine and i'm not trying to pick on you or rebut anybody you you need to have it revealed to you by god and if i'm wrong i need god to reveal it to me amen can we agree on that amen but my brother and sister you see this word of god when it come forth it come forth in such a way and i believe god intended for it to be this way the word of god come forth the bible i'll start with it come forth in such a way that we can come up with ten thousand different religions that all say we believe the same bible amen some people nope that don't matter well i'm sorry it does matter amen god's not going to contradict himself and if he ever said something was important it remains important and so what happens is is when we have acted upon the council we'll find out that we were actually anointed and that anointing is revealed in revelations 19. amen so that anointing that has come down uh is uh now expressed you might say in revelations 19 so we've jumped a whole lot of things that have happened we've jumped over the vials we've jumped over the thunders we've jumped over all of these things and now we've come down to a place because this is coming right back into the intimacy of the bride of christ in the word for the hour and that word come and says a voice come out of the throne saying praise our god all ye is servants and all you that fear and both small and great and i heard is a great voice of a great multitude and a voice of many waters and a voice of mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent rainus amen now look at this verse seven i just love this verse i'm sorry i'm just in love with this verse because you see it is now a key stepping stone of the revelation of jesus christ in me i was not just hearing the word you were not just hearing the word but this little bride right here is glad she's not all pouty face amen she's rejoicing she's giving honor because she knows why she is who she is she's not there looking to calvary she's now by revelation looking at what her fulfillment is on this earth she's no longer saying whoa unto me why was i born in this day why do i look like i look why am i who i am she's looking back from the other side saying i was chosen oh hallelujah i was chosen of almighty god to be his representative this isn't an accident this is not by chance this is not the equivalent of a lottery ticket this is god in his return pre-determinant people get caught up there well that can't be because then it's it's all a waste of time because god already knew and guarded no no no free moral agency's still here i can walk right over here and i can choose to shake brother trevor's hand or i could choose to slap his face might not end well but i just want you to understand a radical or silly little thing like that we get to choose we get to choose to say amen are we gonna choose to think man i wish he'd shut up so we can go home come on we get to choose but he's telling us be glad and rejoice and give honor for the marriage of the lamb has come my brother and sister this word of god come and set the stage that it's not god plucking you and saying get ready buddy but something down inside of you says i believe that word that word was spoken he was speaking to me oh lord i want to be ready i want to fulfill this word i want that life to be my life i want to be bone of his bone i want to be flesh of his flesh spirit of his spirit hallelujah you see my brother and sister because the revelation of the word has come to you that is what is moving you to get ready it's no preacher it's no great evangelist none of them will ever move you trust me i know some of you folks couldn't move you with a 10-ton jack and a bulldozer but god can oh hallelujah don't get offended amen because i've got a quote for you if you are but look if i couldn't let your pastor move you i could come down here and push and kind of coerce and kind of beg and kind of whatever but just let the holy ghost come down because of who you are the holy ghost comes down and something in your heart goes oh lord that's right oh lord i want to be your word i want to be that life and what does she do she starts making herself ready you know how she makes herself ready come on now this might sound like a little loaded forgive me but when this simple preaching of the word comes and you recognize something in your life however small and you go lord forgive me deliver me from that lord see that's getting ready some people think getting ready is we've got a whole library of the message and we've got a whole nother library of the cross references of the message that show this and show that and tie this to this and puts this here and shows why their idea of the message their version of the message is correct but you see this real preparation comes through the simple preaching of the gospel that moves upon us now i might speak a little blood here maybe you've got a little problem lying the lord speaks to you and you say lord deliver me from that god comes on the scene satan's going to jump on that he's going to put you in and multiple things to try to get you back maybe the lust of the flesh now we all get spooked about that we all get freaked out that's a real spirit and it's a powerful spirit and you look at it as it was in the beginning so shall it be at the coming of the son of man let's not stick our head in the sand and not act like those spirits are not even going to come around us and afflict us come on saints amen and that's not just something stuck with man eve hadn't been attracted to that serpent and that's not too straight is it but you see it's by the preaching of the word amen now i'm not going to eliminate it see this is the problem we have on one side they want to eliminate ephesians 4 entirely and just go to the tapes but i tell you if you have balance in your life you recognize we need what's on those tapes the prophet of god said rapturing faith is on those tapes amen we need that the bible also gives us a ministry hallelujah so let's not let's not get selective here and throw one out throwing out because you might just throw out the very thing you need amen find balance in this but you see the word has come and what has it done she's recognized oh lord deliver me from this lord help me here lord i have a spirit of maybe bitterness i have a spirit of depression i have these things lord deliver me and sincerity from the heart but you know what it is most of the time saints i'm just going to speak blind on those besetting sins you might say we're so ashamed of them we would never let no one on earth know something like that bothered us we would never say church pray for me or pastor pray for me because my goodness we're just terrified at the idea somebody would know we were human and you people have androids for phones androids are hard to use they're hard to deal with i heard that they're unrepentant you carry one you should know it's nature then i'm just making light of that honey we're human why should we be ashamed that we're human little brian stand up and take your god-given right stand right up and stand on that why because as she makes herself ready she was granted this didn't just come automatic this wasn't a free gift do you catch that she was granted one was connected to the other one would not come to pass until the other one had come to pass interconnected and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for fine linen is the righteousness of saints let's take this back to revelations 3 right they're naked and he's telling him come to me so you won't be naked amen what is a part of this covering see we can get this and we can argue with the sequence that these things take place saints but i tell you what part of it is as this little bride starts to get ready she responding to the word one step at a time sometimes it's an instant metamorphosis go to church in a low slung blouse and a mini skirt god deal with the heart come back never dress that way ever again in their life but for some it took time maybe fashion was something they had a little passion and they oh you know but you see as they're making themselves ready i'll help you get this as god's taking one covering away another one is coming and covering this bride he didn't say now you instantaneous have to do this but you see she's making herself ready and as she's being undressed from ungodly she is being dressed by the godly oh my brother and sister god taking that away taking it from her oh my goodness oh my goodness now let us just go on let's go on right here i need to hurry along my goodness my reputation is going to kill me one of these days jesus christ the same yesterday and forever there's one thing to teach something there's another thing for god to confirm it and say it's the truth see saints that's what's important that you take it back to the word and we'll touch on that in just a minute get going paul it's one thing to say something it's another thing to do something it's not hearers it's doers show me your faith without your works and i'll show you my faith paul said by my works if you believe it you will and let me change this just for the sake of our deal today if you believe it you'll implement it amen it'll bring an action in your life that you'll say lord your word said now you know brother paul wasn't very polite about that but it's still fit and lord i'm not going to get offended because it was your word not paul if you believe it you'll act upon it that's it and then your faith becomes works and god can go with you then you see my brother and sister we don't want to just hear it whatever aspect of the word of god it is we don't want to just hear it we want to stop if it hurts you now i'm not going to ask you how many of them you know i did that the other day and then i kind of felt bad later because way too many of you raised a hand but the man behind this pulpit might say things that might hurt you say him in such a way that you feel offended or whatever but you see ultimately it's the christ in you the holy ghost in you that can sift through that and say he wasn't picking on me he wasn't picking on me i'm going to recognize that was god speaking to me that i would recognize i need to let that go and for everything god takes away from you he gives you something so god will never leave you bankrupt amen if you'll accept it but if you choose not to accept it you might find yourself feeling bankrupt hallelujah amen now we're going to go through some quotes here real quick if i can figure out what the definition of quick is amen church age ephesian church age they knew the righteous life that accompanied the bearing of that name for whosoever nameth the name of the lord let him depart from sin be holy ye that bear the vessels of the lord thou shalt not bear the name of the lord thy god in vain these ephesians were christians oh is there any christians here this morning hallelujah amen i don't want to be some you know kind of half-hearted i don't want to be some kind of lukewarm i want to be a real christian they bore a name and that name was christ who was the spirit of god within them which was one of the threefold names of their lord as for my name's sake hath labored and has not fainted these believers weren't laboring for come on saint i want to drive that home for you you are not laboring for no one else but for our lord jesus christ young people you're not laboring for mom and dad a husband you're not laboring for a wife wife you're not laboring for a husband amen brother's not laboring for sisters the word tells us to do all things as unto the lord amen hallelujah so if we can do that and say amen to it then when the word comes back to correct us we need to recognize it's not this one it's not that one it's not that it's not that it's god speaking to me [Applause] they weren't laboring for paul or for an organization they weren't committed to programs and institutions whereby they built up the holdings of value they worked for the lord they were his servants not pawns ooh now i'm telling you my brother and sister everybody's like old brother animal brother adam i'm telling you if brother brown did come back he'd rip the height off of us and they'd be a whole lot of people would say whoa mistake that's not my prophet he loves everybody that's right he loves everybody but he knows what the word of god is because as god's mouthpiece he says those i love those i love i buy nice gifts for and i compliment them and i tell them what wonderful people no no because i love you he says i chasten you because i want you to be what the word in you called you to be not just words don't pay play lip service to this message things if you believe it believe it hallelujah they didn't go to church on sunday and talk about that name and then forget about it the rest of the week they didn't give lip service to that name no sir it was their lives that were given they just took their life and said you know what lord here it is what do you want to do with me this lady i was witnessing to i i was talking to her about the fox book of martyrs and she goes oh i don't like books like that and i said you need to read it because it's a reminder to a christian of the courage that god can give to you and i we are not puppets we are not pawns we are not cowards we are stalwart soldiers of this cross hallelujah amen no sir it was our lives that were given all they did they did in that name and in that name they acted and if they could not act in that name then they refrained from acting now i'm going to be real blunt and bold this morning saints we need to apply that that little sentence is right there we need to not be going out and doing this and then oh lord forgive me many of the behaviors that we have oh i'm preaching to you paul amen many of these behaviors that we have many of these little petty things we have to deal with we knew that we shouldn't do that it's not why the devil tricked me no we gave ourself to it oh i know that might skin some of you and if i didn't get down to blood let me come and try and skin you again my brother and sister we need to cut out the nonsense we need to cut out the nonsense but if they couldn't act in that name then they refrained from acting that leave a lot of us silent and seated they were heavily placed christians by whose behavior was in the lord but that false vine group that wanted to defile that name hung like skulking wolves in the dark waiting to get in and tear down wow this last line is what the inspiration to me was but the saints stood the test hallelujah kept the word and the name hallelujah i don't care how many wolves you know i've kind of been on a terror forgive me just saints i i don't want to distract the church with the things that disturb me and whatever you just have to forgive me right because i i promise you i want to be the kind of pastor that lays down in the gate of the sheep fold i want to smell like the sheep and when it snows i don't care the snow get on me i want the sheep to be safe when the wolf is circling i don't want to come and say i'm afraid of the wolf i want god to anoint me to lay or stand in that gate and say i know a wolf when i see one and i might hit back on these things and i know it's disappointed some of you that i've hit on these things but my brother and sister if god lays on my heart to defend and to stand and to warn amen i have to do that i can't sit back and say well that's too bad the devil just drugged some of our young people out and killed them no sir no sir we'll fight him right now to the very last drop of strength that is within us and we'll identify it and we'll bear the burden but the saints stood the test and kept the word in the name this is after the wolf come in the dark trying to get in and tear it down the saints were still standing oh hallelujah that makes me excited we ain't gonna be out here saying it's too bad the church was decimated by a spirit no sir there's gonna be wolves there might be scars there might be a little blood shed there might be a little unhappiness go around but in the end the saints will still be standing hallelujah now i i don't mean to just take this humorous i want you to say lord reveal the depth of what brother paul's fixing to put on the screen to me okay can you say that amen i can't tell you how many times i've heard people say well that man tells it like it is he did but the problem was he added to it or took away from it he told it to you in a way that was appealing to you he told it to you in a way that you did not realize that he is a wolf and people find that offensive my phone has rang and whatever and people were offended my brother and sister i'm sorry when i see a wolf i don't care if he's wearing a suit and tie what we don't see here maybe if i was going to expand this until a complete uh thought concerning the church it might be a bigger picture and this guy might have a bible this guy might have a message book [Applause] but you see when it's just that one word off he might as well be saying i'm going to eat you and it's just a cartoon saints this cartoonist has some others that were quite interesting too but you see might tell it like it is we're all just sinners saved by grace aren't we glad god sent a prophet to this day hallelujah we have revelation that the world don't have we're standing upon the revealed word of god a wolf can say that okay i think i'm finally getting my axe ground down saints because you see i want to make it clear to you you that are here in grace and you that might be listening at some other time i want to make it clear to you the wolf doesn't have to be the one that comes in here and just openly twists this message comes in here and openly tries to get you to one side or the other this wolf can invite you to dinner come on do you get it this wolf will invite you to dinner only he didn't have anything other than you hallelujah and when it's all done all that you were will have been consumed by him oh you're still living you're still breathing you got a house a car a job a family but you've been consumed by that i'll tell you what i want you to be consumed by it's right here i want you to eat this and when it's bitter in your belly i want you to say thank you lord thank you lord that your word you love me so much you'd correct me hallelujah amen well praise the lord works his faith expressed you know there's some people that dates when the message is preached matters to them i find that rather amazing myself now i realize brother branham's uh revelation in the message as god was dealing with brother branham it had a subtle shift do you understand what i'm saying what it was in 1947 was not what it was in 1965 right god dealt with him amen what the what the horse riders were different things like that god god revealing or opening it to the prophet right so so i i just want you to understand that amen so there's some people though that are like well that was preached before the seals it doesn't matter okay well you know they don't get much later than this one right here so if we're playing trump cards amen it don't get much later than this right here like they did on the day of pentecost they laughed and said these men are full of new wine they know it was it was a great thing to those it was happening to yes sir excuse me for a moment great thing to those happening to it's a great thing to those i'm not saying it has to happen to everybody in this way but it's a great thing when god wakes you up in the middle of the night speaks to you it's a great thing when the word of god speaks to you it's a great thing when the message of god speaks to you it's a great thing when the holy ghost comes down and just lays on your heart to pray for someone and you find a days weeks or maybe months later that in that very time frame someone was going through a great trial it's a great thing to know that god said you're connected you're connected you're connected oh hallelujah it was a great thing to those it was happening to why it was god revealing himself to the individuals okay now we'll get this right down is there revelation outside of what god revealed to the prophet yes we can have an argument now can't we there's nothing outside what the prophet brought i want you to hold that this great debate it was god revealing himself to the individuals while others laughed these were rejoicing it was an in individual revelation which is faith faith that's revealed if it wasn't faith then it wouldn't even be there it was faith just seeds have to have the ground prepared first therefore all he foreknew he called all he called all he for knew he predestinated if you want to read that romans 8 28 34 and also ephesians 1 1 through 5 see all he foreknew he did call and only called he justified and all he justified he has already glorified there's nothing out of order amen we think there is but look in the scripture it's just hitting exactly the way god's word said it would we see the message is rejected today isn't that just what the scripture said they would do now i want to speak to that for a minute my brother and sister it is here in this way i have encountered this let's not hear say this is not an ideology my brother and sister people are like well uh we witnessed the message to this individual we spoke to these over here and they rejected it i believe the message and i would reject your version of it too that's kind of blunt isn't it and you know why because it doesn't line up with the word what i want to do saints and i encourage you to do is when you witness or you teach your children you put this bible right out there and say here is our foundation not what we think not what this man said not what that man said but right here children neighbor friend here it is hallelujah my paul you can sure dig a hole amen yes sir isn't that just what the scripture said they would do sure all these things are ordained of god oh it should make you walk happy that's a trouble with we today so much difference than the christians of old hmm oh my there's a difference when the real true revelation of jesus christ being emmanuel dwelled in the hearts of those men they were rugged people oh come on saints if we don't fit this right here then i ask you don't get offended change but today we're padded by the denominations in the message i mean i'm we're padded by the denominations with oh i tell you they ain't got no revelation i've run into in africa i've run into it in europe i've run it in south america and i've run into it in the state idaho they ain't gotten up the revelation you come over here you're depending on their revelation if their revelations isn't according to the word of god then it's wrong mine or anybody else's that's where the showdown comes the word of god tells which is right and wrong oh my my brother and sister it don't matter if they were with the prophet or best friends with everybody that was friends with the prophet my brother and sister a prophet of god says go back to that word hallelujah hallelujah i i hope you guys aren't aren't too tired or too hungry or too thirsty amen okay we now come to a conclusion such conclusion as we have already found in the word amen as much as we believe in trying to find the oldest and best manuscripts to get the best record of the word possible we will never get the true meaning of it by study or comparison of scriptures sincere as we may be now don't read any further saints you see the prophet of god if you'll study the message warns us of an intellectual spirit that will come into the church that intellectual spirit will believe because they can tie these things together but intellectualism will never give life to the word intellectualism will tell you the tolerances as i joke our brother doug baker's pastor and a church down there in phoenix and brother doug says you know and people are always using phrases like well you know that's not rocket science where brother doug was a rocket scientist and he says no this this word is rocket science see in a rocket when they make a missile i believe where he worked down there at one time i don't know they made the thor missile the tolerances are to the hundreds of thousands of an inch now let me entertain this thought in your mind he said if a man would add one word to or take one word away his name would be removed from the book and he would be cursed how tight pretty tight pretty tight he didn't say one big word he said one word you see oftentimes in our human vocabulary we use the word i think and we don't want to be too critical of each other it's a expression but remember that wolf we were talking to he thinks also i think you see we need to when we approach the word remove that i think that's right the word says it amen i don't necessarily understand it but lord i believe it then let that become life and then god will expand your understanding to all catch us to all that is necessary to make a rapture i don't need to know one more thing that's right than what it takes to make a rapture i don't need to be able to explain creation i don't need to explain whether there was a prior civilization we was having that lovely conversation the other day uh we don't know what was out there i don't need to explain that i don't need to know right where did the where did the you know the whatever you call an elephant that was froze in the ice where did he come from i don't need to know i don't need to know how this all works what i do know is my god is perfect that's what i need to know now see we can do study and comparison sincere as we may be i've dealt with people that you'd be talking about something in the message and they will throw 10 12 15 quotes at you that's why you're wrong but you see they missed a couple key components it's not about how you come about it's whether you believe it will come about i can't explain a body change but i'm going to take one and people will come and they might make a comment you see they don't see they don't understand and my brother and sister i'm sorry i'm not going to fight about it people they feel like they defeated you on the idea because you didn't push back but you see i'm not going to fight about it if you don't believe that god is in you i'm not going to fight with you but there is over 100 quotes the prophet says that god's in you just in case you need something to back up to that it will take listen it will take a revelation from god to bring it out that is exactly what paul said which things we also speak not in words which man's wisdom teaches but which the holy ghost teaches first corinthians 2 13 the true revelation is god interpreting his own word by vindicating what is promised now i'm telling you my brother and sister i read my bible it says there is a lamb's wife and she's making herself ready you know what vindicated that scripture you did you did you did you did you did you did you did you did amen you can look at that and say well okay that's to happen but if you don't believe it is happening in you it will pass right over you it will leave you sitting there questioning well how can this be and how can that be and someone else said this and someone else said that my brother and sister don't allow that to happen god's word says that you step and say lord i don't understand but i want to and i believe it amen and you will move forward because i'll tell you my brother and sister the prophet of god showed us quite clearly in the message in his word speaking but he backed it up in the bible that they would come in this intellectual age in an intellectual spirit and they would tie you in knots concerning the bible but the spirit of life which is the holy ghost is not in them they have an intellectual spirit and i'm telling you you can take the simplicity of this gospel and apply it to a drunk a drug addict a prostitute whatever you want to talk about and i'm not so much in the united states but in south america god has allowed me to deal with every one of those kind amen homosexuals we have seen it all i don't want to dwell on all that negative side of that and i have by god's grace seen delivering power come and take a young lady that had already moved in the direction of giving herself to men and figuring out i can make money doing this and god deliver her i'm banned in a homosexual relationship crying out to god brother paul will god forgive me and i speak in terms that i know not of and the man comes back and not only did god restore him to his marriage and to his children he restored him to the household of faith i have seen these things these are not fairy tales these are not all that happened to brother branham's time that happened in days gone by why my brother and sister because we come to the place this is what the word is teaching us this is john 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god this is god hallelujah we shouldn't have to be taught we should be believing we should be saying lord open my eyes then i can see and then let me take this word and apply it to my life there's the life changing we can talk about well i believe the message you don't go to church you don't pray you don't read your bible you don't witness you don't do none of these things and you say i believe i question that i'm sorry that's blunt but it's the truth you see my brother and sister it's not what man's wisdom teaches but what the holy ghost teaches see that true revelation is god interpreting his own word by vindicating what his promise now don't let anyone be misled by what i've said and think that i do not believe in the accuracy of the word as we now have it i believe the bible is accurate jesus completely authenticated the old testament when here on earth and it was compiled exactly as was our new testament make no mistake about it we have the infallible word of god today and no man dares take from it or add to it but we need the same spirit that gave it to teach it to us not an intellectual spirit not not an academic type approach to this message but let let's let's pray oh god help us saints let us pray that the holy ghost will come down in this church in our midst and teach us this word amen it's not enough to say i believe my the prophet showed us the devil believes but we need that same spirit that gave it to teach it to us oh how we need revelation by the spirit we don't need a new bible we don't need a new translation though some are very good i'm not against them but we need the revelation of the spirit and thank god we can have what we need for god wants to reveal his word to us by his spirit now look at this closing out the service i've been long enough forgive me may god begin by spirit to give us do you believe in the value of words i'm sorry i believe in the value of words may god begin by spirit to give us what is that word continuous yes that's right the word continuous also has a context of lasting never ending always present available by his spirit to give us a never-ending life-giving what's that word hallelujah oh where am i i'm so lost hallelujah i guess i quit preaching from my notes quite a while ago it's probably obvious i am lost oh there we are praise the lord i was lost but now i'm found amen to give us continuous unending life-giving and the word prevailing now has you know the english language has several definitions mostly for every word but one of those of the word prevailing is current may the lord give us an unending life-giving and current revelation you see we're not moving not one iota from the message the prophet brought us but we are led by the holy spirit to recognize that open word for november 1st 2020. i don't have to look to 1961 something i don't have to look back to to spurgeon and tozer and wesley and luther i don't have to look back there's an open word that's right here today god having opened that to us now our only duty saints that we have is to apply it all we have to do is implement the word that has been given to us oh if the church well now if nothing's changed please don't think i'm being facetious but these spirits are out there i've dealt with them they don't think one thing has changed since the prophet left the scene well i'll tell you why i'll argue with him i was about what would i bend december 61 december 65 four four years old my comprehension of the word of god at four years old was zero i'll tell you what's changed this book has been opened and i see myself in that book and there was a time i said i'm done with this and i ran and i ran and i went and i lived other places and i didn't live a horrible sinful life saints don't misunderstand god preserved me on that part and i ran and i ran around and god let me run so far that i got back and i was at the starting point hallelujah i say thank you lord amen but you see the revelation of the message now this will sound a little blunt i'm sorry but the revelation of the message in the late 70s and the early 80s was you will do this and you will do this and you will not do this and if you don't do what your pastor says and if you don't this and if you don't do this hmm some of us me as a teenager i thought i was in prison i wanted to go to the movie theater but i was going to hell if i went to the movie theater and that's probably correct but the problem was they made it a rule not a relationship and the message the word of god has went from rules of do and don't has went to the relationship where you say i want to please you lord amen the prophet said that those movie theaters had demons hanging everywhere lord i don't want to be around those demons that's right i don't want to do that i might accidentally drag one of those things to the house of god no i won't do that you see my brother and sister if the church could only get a fresh revelation my my brother and sister he says here that his spirit give us a continued life-giving and prevailing revelation he goes on to say if the church should only get a fresh revelation now did he mean that we're going to have something that surpasses the prophet to laodicea no sir but the word that is here before us now be opened once again come alive to us where our hearts burn within us amen not just a church experience not just if mama quits if daddy quits i guess i have to quit or vice versa my brother and sister but a real burning desire a living word manifested what is that this open word fresh revelation is creating a bride that is a living word manifested it's not just a bunch of people that say i believe the message we go to this convention tell everybody praise the lord brother so-and-so is my pastor i always found that offensive isn't that terrible but then the word said i need to be a rugged christian so i'm going to put all of those offenses behind me amen and i'm just going to stand on the word and say you know what it doesn't matter you guys don't know what the world's like that wasn't fair to say was it you guys don't know what it's like in the world of being around message ministers hmm how many people in your church brother well how big is your church brother well let's just say your four years bigger than our whole building we'll get that over with and praise the lord we'll settle another thing right here i'd rather have a hundred faithful than 500 that were well anyway no we live in that world those spirits don't go away saints what we want is we want a fresh revelation and that is not a new idea on the word but that is god coming to us his mercies new every morning oh sister emmy come before i just keep going on and on and on hallelujah look i didn't touch on a couple things so this might seem a little kilter to you but all the authority that the word has given to us declares that we are sons and daughters of god i have the authority to claim that amen the word says we're overcomers the word says we're part of the bride of christ the word says we are chosen amen this is not something saints to give lip service to this is not something i encourage you now i'm not condemning i'm not speaking down to any one of you but i'm encouraging i want you to see the picture of laodicea that would come to the place that we believe by just acknowledging that it's okay but there comes a time and a place we have to implement it we have to implement this word in our life i say this morning you need healing believe you're healed declare i'm healed amen you need a deliverance believe your deliver and step forward and say i'm delivered i don't care whether it's from something in your mind some affliction or whatever some addiction or whatever it might be stand up and say i am delivered no question mark no commas no dot dot dots no second guessing i'm delivered amen some would say well i need guidance in my life i don't even know what to do he says he's your counselor and guide believe him amen you say i need more of god i you just stand up and say i believe the holy ghost is here to lead me oh but it's so easy to go well if and i and that and and mama says this and daddy says this and our old pastor i love that one the church you left you're still quoting that pastor my old pastor says well sister jerry handed me a deal here a while back and i have to at church we have a terrible sense of humor a terrible sense of humor we were going to hang it on the board in the foyer there and it was talking about you came from there to hear but you want here to be like there but if you were there and liked it so much why are you here [Music] come on you want to walk through life quoting your old pastor why don't you go to church with your old pastor amen what i want to do is quote the word i want to quote this message i want to quote that there's life here amen it's current it's fresh we don't need lip service saints let's just drop all our excuses you know that's what excuses are their lip service the reason i can't is has nothing to do with it usually what we voice has nothing to do with it i'm not talking about that saying well i was in church on wednesday because i had vertigo i don't believe that's a lip service amen you know i would have walked into church i would like that you probably would have been entertained i'd walked in here [Music] imagine if i'd have preached i'd probably been falling down on the platform but you know what i'm talking about that real living word satan says well this is why it was the way you was raised that's why you're like you are my god's a deliverer i would do this and this because but this and this no you're giving lip service or god's greater than any kind of excuse our god's greater than laodicea our god has already vanquished every enemy our god has already declared he's the overcomer his word has already showed us where the devil's going my maybe we forgot to read the end of the book maybe we need to go into revelation read the end of the book remind ourselves that what god said and how he declared it would end up oh hallelujah we don't need lip service we need to believe hallelujah let's just stand worship the lord probably burnt up a good pot roast somewhere forgive me but you know some of you are the cause of this problem hallelujah i'm serious i'm serious some of you are the cause of this problem some of you need preached at oh i didn't say that did i some of you enjoy it [Music] oh come on saints word put it to work [Music] there's so many things i could add to this this morning oh my brother jason just come i want to sing that song i exulty that's what we need to do saints we need to be exalting him get out of your dumps get out of here woe is me oh wait just second some of you might say oh brother paul you no i was i was talking to me get out of that god's got something way more for you god's got an open word amen is there no balm in gilead take those things in your life and let the word implement it let the word change you and it will i don't care we start right here a little tightness on the end go all the way to the back row whoever it might be what we'd say the back row here i don't care who you are i don't care which circumstances i don't care what your age is if you will simply look to the word of god and say i believe that and lord let me live it that's a fresh revelation my brother and sister when you get up in the morning and you can live this word that is a revelation hallelujah above all all gone above all the earth thou art exalted far above all god we exaltly [Music] thee [Music] [Music] we [Music] [Music] let's take it to that level high exaltly just lift your hands if you would this morning [Music] [Music] oh [Music] i exalted i just feel led to clarify one thing before we move on my brother and sister i don't believe there's one word to be added or taken away from the message that brother branham was commissioned to bring you see when we talk about new revelation as sons and daughters of god that's the word being open to you amen you see there might be something that you have a great strength in your life and you have something that's a weakness we can stand solo and say praise the lord i understand this god dealt with me and this is good but you see god can come down and reveal the avenue to defeat that weakness it becomes revelation to you it becomes revelation some find it my brother and sister i'll just share this just real quick down in chile a family there husband and wife they wait on sister jerry and i hand in foot and i kind of you might say rebuke the brother i said brother that's fine we're we're healthy we can get up we can get our own drink we can you know get get more butter we can do whatever and i kid you not this is the truth he come up to me laid his hands on my shoulders and said you don't understand brother paul this is the ministry god gave me [Music] to humble myself to serve god's people and it struck me at first i thought he was just speaking kind words but then i realized he truly meant to humble himself and he looked me in the face and says please don't rob me of my blessing you see my brother and sister [Music] we often don't think that we need humbling but god knows how to humble us god humbled that brother and it became a commitment that him and his wife gave they said this is what we can do we're not preachers we're not this we're not that we don't sing we don't play instruments but we can serve and that become their identity they're known in the church for that right there and they do it sincerely not laboriously not as under obligation but i can serve i can serve and buy that god humbled this man and his wife from kind of a haughty spirit oh my brother and sister go ask him i might help you with your plane ticket but i won't buy it but you can go look them in the face and ask them what happened and then this they'll tell you we realized one day we're only as good as the spirit by which we serve god i want you to think about that in closing you're only as close to god as you are by the spirit by which you serve him oh my brother and sister god help us god help us okay i've been admonished so many times in the last few weeks to quit apologizing so i won't apologize for the time but praise the lord there is a fountain open in the house of david oh hallelujah oh if you need to go go saints i don't mean to hold anybody hallelujah but i'll tell you what my sundays are my sundays are about the only day that i just get a release myself i just get to throw myself into this you know hallelujah the rest of it seems like i'm sorry to admit this but the rest of life sometimes seems to be dominated by the need to earn a living to pay some bills to turn around and do it again and again and again god help us break the shackles of this earth oh you might still have a job and a mortgage and a car payment but you can break the shackle hallelujah all right we'll take you from the nation and bring you to your own land and i'll be sanctified in you before the eyes a new heart will i give you and place my spirit within i'll sprinkle clean water on you and save you from your sins there is who was are streams of [Music] grace [Music] and i will pour upon the house of my chosen one the spirit of grace and in that day what a that will be a fountain shall be opened up
