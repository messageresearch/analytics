[38:35] let's have a word of Prayer
[38:37] our precious Heavenly Father Our Father
[38:40] how grateful we are to Bow into your
[38:42] presence here this evening to know your
[38:45] present with us to not only feel it but
[38:48] feel it in our souls
[38:52] the presence of God Among Us
[38:55] I wonder Lord may you make every one of
[38:58] us much more aware of your presence
[39:02] Lord the world and the church and the
[39:06] church Among Us that believe the message
[39:07] I'm not speaking of bride I'm speaking
[39:10] of the church
[39:12] Lord is getting cold
[39:15] but I believe the bride is in a Revival
[39:19] and that Revival is the opening of the
[39:21] word and that opening of the word is
[39:23] Christ in US
[39:25] and it identifies Us in him and Lord we
[39:28] can't get enough of that
[39:30] it's in our hearts every day but yes the
[39:32] Satan is going to battle us
[39:36] and he's going to try to use the senses
[39:38] of our flesh these Gates of our spirit
[39:40] to try to war against us
[39:44] but I'm so glad Lord that he that is in
[39:46] US is greater than he that is in the
[39:48] world
[39:50] and so father we're not here by chance
[39:52] tonight
[39:53] you know what you lay to my heart here
[39:55] Lord and I've struggled all day knowing
[39:57] what to do and here just sitting in the
[40:00] office
[40:02] I brought three sermons with me Lord
[40:04] this day because I didn't know which one
[40:06] you wanted to take
[40:08] but I believe you are perfect in all
[40:10] your ways and you do things that are
[40:11] beyond our reasoning but we have a
[40:14] complete and perfect trust in thee
[40:17] it is sweet
[40:19] so sweet to trust in Jesus
[40:23] we're thankful for that father and we
[40:26] rejoice in your mercy we rejoice in the
[40:28] revealing of your word for we know the
[40:30] revealing and the hearing of the word is
[40:32] the evidence that we've passed from
[40:34] Death to life when this can be revealed
[40:36] in US Lord we have no fear no worry
[40:38] anymore because we know we're identified
[40:41] before the foundation of the world to be
[40:44] in you to be your thoughts that were
[40:46] real and substance
[40:48] and we're here in our day to express you
[40:51] and to manifest yourself
[40:53] because it is yourself
[40:56] and Lord we're here to manifest yourself
[40:59] and we're here to live your word and
[41:02] Lord we're here to to Lord bear your
[41:05] name
[41:06] you have a bride that's pregnanted with
[41:08] your life
[41:09] she's conceived by Your Word
[41:11] and Lord we have we're here to bring
[41:14] we're bringing forth an eternal life
[41:16] child
[41:18] and father we know that we will meet
[41:21] quickly with someday very soon
[41:24] we will meet together in the air and
[41:26] meet you
[41:28] and now Lord we are anticipating this
[41:31] evening's service believing that you
[41:33] know exactly you and I ask you to do
[41:36] laser surgery
[41:38] I'm asking you to do light surgery Lord
[41:43] just and pinpoint
[41:47] these things that should be in our
[41:48] hearts that we're giving away to that
[41:50] isn't pleasing to yourself
[41:52] for we know the thief is present
[41:56] we know that he has not come for any
[41:59] other purpose
[42:00] but to distract
[42:03] to whatever means he can and keep us
[42:05] away from
[42:07] putting our complete trust in your word
[42:09] through death the self
[42:11] and we just give you praise now that

[42:41] mouth when it's time to quit

[42:45] Lord we can't trust ourself we have no
[42:48] we have no ability Lord to even serve
[42:52] you I have no ability to preach your

[43:29] you for this
[43:31] we give thanks to you for this for that
[43:33] your love expressed to us
[43:36] how do we express it back by believing
[43:38] what you said
[43:39] and conducting ourself with joy amidst
[43:42] the trials that you and your wisdom has
[43:44] allowed to come to pass
[43:46] we give you thanks now for every one of
[43:48] these things and we just want to be
[43:50] drawn closer to you and the only way we
[43:52] know is faith comes by hearing the word
[43:55] in Jesus Christ's name we ask you to
[43:58] bless your word and bless it to
[44:00] individual hearts
[44:01] and reveal them to those that have ears
[44:04] to hear
[44:05] For Your Glory in Jesus name amen
[44:09] turn me to Saint John 10.
[44:14] no I believe we'll go a little
[44:15] differently here let's go to Joshua 1
[44:17] first Joshua chapter 1.
[44:29] and then I will come down to what I want
[44:31] to take as a read a text here and get my
[44:35] my title
[44:40] Joshua chapter 1 verse 8.
[44:49] this book I want to draw your attention
[44:52] to a book that's been opened in our day
[44:56] this book
[44:57] so what are you talking about Brother
[44:59] David I'm talking about the open book
[45:02] speaking to Joshua here he's going in to
[45:04] take the land this book of the law the
[45:06] word shall not depart out of thy mouth
[45:10] but thou shall meditate therein day and
[45:13] night
[45:14] that thou mayest observe to do according
[45:17] to all that is written therein
[45:20] for then thou shall make thy way
[45:22] prosperous and then thou shall have good
[45:25] success
[45:27] now he said I would that you'd be in
[45:29] health and prosper as your soul prospers
[45:31] is what prospers your soul prospers not
[45:34] as your money prospers
[45:36] your soul prospers
[45:39] all right I'd like to turn with me to
[45:41] Revelations 10.
[45:43] meditation is a great thing
[45:51] Revelations chapter 10
[45:56] and you this is a very strange way that
[45:59] I'm bringing this service tonight and
[46:00] this even this message but I feel very
[46:03] very led to do it Satan has battled me
[46:06] very hard and begin in coming to what I
[46:09] needed to know here tonight
[46:11] but God's always on time
[46:14] so I trust that you're you're willing to
[46:17] receive
[46:18] and I trust that you've been feeding
[46:20] because if you don't feed on the word
[46:22] this word this revelation of this word
[46:24] is going to go right over your heads
[46:28] amen but I'll tell you one thing the
[46:30] Holy Spirit loves to feed on the word
[46:36] all right Revelations 10 8 and the voice
[46:39] excuse me wait yeah 10 8. and the voice
[46:42] which I heard from Heaven spake unto me
[46:44] again and said go and take the little
[46:46] book
[46:48] which is open in the hand of the Angel
[46:51] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[46:54] Earth Seven Seals have been broke
[46:57] which is open and the book is open
[47:01] okay
[47:02] and names are written therein I won't go
[47:04] into all that because that's another
[47:05] service
[47:06] all right
[47:07] verse 9.
[47:09] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[47:12] him give me I wonder if we could ask
[47:18] the angel
[47:19] give it to me
[47:22] why because it was open
[47:24] for me
[47:27] amen said so I went unto the angel and
[47:31] said unto him give me the little book
[47:32] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[47:35] up
[47:36] look at that
[47:38] what are we doing with it
[47:41] take it and eat it up
[47:44] do you realize that this open book is a
[47:47] perfect interpretation of the word
[47:51] it's it's the seventh Angel's third pull
[47:55] and it's the seven angels message
[47:57] and the message will bring Rapture and
[48:00] Grace
[48:01] the message Rapture is found in this
[48:03] message that we claim to believe
[48:06] it's right here in this open book
[48:10] so why we ought to be is doing this
[48:12] meditating upon it it should be our
[48:15] Focus every day it should be our
[48:17] absolute every day it should be number
[48:18] one every day
[48:20] it shouldn't be that it should be the
[48:23] Little Wheel in the middle of the wheel
[48:25] said take it and eat it up
[48:29] and I took the little book or excuse me
[48:32] and it shall make thy belly bitter yeah
[48:34] it's not going to be easy
[48:36] your flesh man is not going to be easy
[48:38] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[48:41] honey
[48:41] and I took the little book out of the
[48:43] Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[48:45] my mouth sweet as honey as soon as I had
[48:47] eaten it my belly was bitter and he said
[48:49] unto me
[48:51] thou must prophesy who where where's the
[48:53] final voice
[48:55] it's a bride
[48:57] why is it the fight whose voice
[49:00] whose voice is it
[49:02] The bridegroom's Voice
[49:06] before many peoples and and that comes
[49:09] from a union with the bridegroom
[49:11] okay
[49:15] before many peoples and Nations and
[49:18] tongues and Kings so she's writing the
[49:21] trail again
[49:23] yeah
[49:25] okay amen yeah I do believe in a in a in
[49:28] a
[49:30] yeah
[49:31] sure do and it's happening
[49:35] it's never changed but this ministry
[49:37] this ministry will change our mortal
[49:39] bodies
[49:40] I don't say my Ministry but my Ministry
[49:43] if it isn't this ministry I've got the
[49:46] wrong Ministry
[49:48] I'm not feeding you on the word for the
[49:49] season
[49:51] amen but I've got if I don't do that
[49:54] then I need to be out of this pulpit
[49:56] all right so
[49:58] you may be seated
[50:01] I'd like you to turn with me to John 10
[50:03] 10.
[50:05] and we'll take my texts out of that
[50:08] John chapter 10.
[50:13] at this men of my heart this is actually
[50:15] the original thing that Lord laid in my
[50:16] heart and then I got a couple other
[50:18] things here I was going on and
[50:21] the Lord brought me right back around to
[50:23] it but he knows just exactly how much we
[50:25] need and how much I need to meditate on
[50:27] it and so it's been
[50:30] John 10 10.
[50:34] and let's not forget what we just read
[50:36] now meditate upon these things you know
[50:40] meditation brings him on the scene if we
[50:42] draw an eye to him he draws an eye to us
[50:45] two were walking on the road to Emmaus
[50:48] and they were thinking on him they were
[50:50] thinking on the events of the day they
[50:51] were thinking on on the on the death of
[50:54] their savior they were thinking on those
[50:56] things and also thinking upon things
[50:58] that others said he he's alive he's
[51:00] risen
[51:03] and while they were talking about him
[51:05] and thinking about him and he drew near
[51:10] amen Billy Brown said if we ought to be
[51:11] thinking on if we think on him more
[51:13] every day if we'd think upon him he'd
[51:15] say well Brother David I'm just too busy
[51:16] I've got other things to do maybe you're
[51:18] too busy
[51:20] but you can still redeem the time
[51:23] there's still time to redeem
[51:25] yeah I know we get busy
[51:27] but be careful in what you're busy in
[51:30] that's the focal point tonight is what
[51:33] are you busy in
[51:37] because
[51:38] it's good to be busy and
[51:41] things that are according to the word
[51:44] but if you're busy in things that aren't
[51:46] maybe that busyness has become an idol
[51:50] that you're placing before the one that
[51:52] ought to have first place in your life
[51:57] amen that's right he's not he's not a
[52:00] letter he's not a history he is a
[52:02] history he is a letter but he's a Living
[52:04] Word he's a Living spirit he's present
[52:07] today just like he was yesterday and
[52:09] he's in Bride form
[52:13] and if it hadn't to come into the bride
[52:14] form we would never have a complete
[52:17] revelation
[52:18] of the whole thing until he steps forth
[52:21] in Bride form and reveals himself
[52:23] through that
[52:25] so what men are people ought we to be in
[52:28] our in our desires and our motives and
[52:30] our objectives brother Brown said check
[52:32] your motives check your objectives of
[52:34] why you do certain things
[52:38] and so so he said John 10 10 says and he
[52:42] speak he said let me just start up a
[52:43] little a little bit here
[52:47] verse 9 I am the door by me if any man
[52:50] enter in he shall be saved and shall go
[52:53] in and out and find pasture who what's
[52:56] the door he's the door what is the door
[52:58] of the word
[53:00] the word for the season is the door
[53:03] all right so verse 10 the thief cometh
[53:07] not
[53:08] now this thief we're speaking about is
[53:10] Satan
[53:12] this thief
[53:13] cometh not
[53:15] but for now he's called The Thief Jesus
[53:18] was never a thief but he comes as a
[53:20] thief
[53:22] but he's not a thief
[53:24] but this is the thief we're talking
[53:26] about
[53:27] okay what does this thief do he doesn't
[53:29] come but for to steal
[53:32] and to kill if he comes and you're
[53:35] meeting him every single day
[53:40] yes you are on the battleground of your
[53:42] mind
[53:45] he's going to approach you he's allowed
[53:47] to do that
[53:48] amen
[53:50] and God has control of what he's allowed
[53:53] to do but God will use him to develop
[53:56] character in you and I believe part of
[53:59] that is this service tonight
[54:03] all right because God's coming along now
[54:05] and putting his finger on some things in
[54:08] my life your life hey I'm no different
[54:10] than you are I'm also a man
[54:14] mistakes failures we're not talking
[54:16] about how you fail we're talking about
[54:19] being aware of of what you're doing
[54:23] because everything you do and the things
[54:25] you say and you think upon create an
[54:27] atmosphere
[54:28] an atmosphere that either can come in
[54:30] and walk with you or pull away
[54:33] I'm not talking about I'm saving you or
[54:36] this I'm not talking about that at all
[54:38] I'm talking about having him with us
[54:41] fellowshipping he loves fellowship and
[54:44] he wants to fellowship with you but many
[54:46] times I included we put other things in
[54:49] front of him
[54:53] but he's a discerner
[54:57] and he discerns what's in front of him
[54:59] and makes you know it tells you about it
[55:01] now what are we going to do when he does
[55:03] that if well how much do we love him
[55:06] we'll believe him
[55:09] how do I prove I believe I'll reprove my
[55:12] love to him by conducting myself with
[55:14] joy amidst trials that he allows to come
[55:17] to pass but we love him therefore we'll
[55:20] serve him if we have if we serve him
[55:23] outside of any other means than love we
[55:25] are not serving him correctly
[55:29] if we come to church for any other
[55:31] reason but Divine love we're not coming
[55:33] to church for the right reasons
[55:35] I don't say stop coming to church just
[55:38] come to church and ask God to fill you
[55:40] come to church and let him
[55:42] let him fill you with the word receive
[55:44] his love
[55:46] because our motive is not serving a
[55:48] religion our motive is not a book of
[55:50] rules and regulations our motive and our
[55:53] objective in serving God Is A Love
[55:54] Affair it is a love affair with him
[55:58] all right so
[56:01] he said but the thief cometh not but for
[56:04] to steal
[56:05] to kill
[56:07] and to destroy
[56:10] what's he come for
[56:12] what's he what's he putting in front of
[56:14] you your mistakes and failures for
[56:16] trying to get you to yield to that
[56:17] instead of what the word said
[56:20] try to say you're in bonding instead of
[56:22] the word saying you're free
[56:25] right see on and on we could go the word
[56:27] is the absolute the word is the ultimate
[56:29] the word should have first place in
[56:31] everything we do everything we do
[56:33] everything we think
[56:35] you see I just can't think about it
[56:37] we'll quit trying and put it back in the
[56:39] Lord's hands if he's in you he'll tell
[56:41] you then yield yourself and commit
[56:43] yourself to him die to yourself
[56:46] and take up your cross and follow him
[56:48] he can't lead you away from the word
[56:51] he's going to lead you to the word
[56:55] amen but we're letting things get in the
[56:58] way
[56:59] and they're called distractions
[57:03] and he's a master in distracting you and
[57:07] I
[57:10] amen anybody ever had the Lord show you
[57:12] those things and begin to deal with you
[57:14] about those things
[57:18] pointing him out and saying you're
[57:20] you're giving your time over to this
[57:23] when you know you're starting to do it
[57:25] then catch it bring the thoughts under
[57:27] obedience to the word because at that
[57:29] moment you have a choice
[57:34] I said well Lord just take these things
[57:36] from me don't let me fall into this and
[57:38] you know what he said you have a choice
[57:41] and that just that's it Lord that's it
[57:44] then where's my choice coming from
[57:49] amen I want it to be the word I want it
[57:52] to be for my soul I want to live what I
[57:54] am in my soul
[57:58] that's what we should live and that's
[57:59] what the bride will live
[58:01] not by feelings not by senses but what's
[58:04] in their soul what is in their soul
[58:07] if you're born again it's the word
[58:08] living it's the real gift it's the seed
[58:11] of God quickened
[58:13] it's Christ in you
[58:16] and he will rule over you if you'll let
[58:18] him
[58:21] and I know the bride will that's why I
[58:23] can speak these things to people that
[58:25] want more of him
[58:27] called the bride and they want to know
[58:29] where they come short because they're
[58:31] they love their husband and they want to
[58:33] please him
[58:36] isn't that right yes okay now and he's
[58:41] the word so how do we please him without
[58:43] faith it's impossible to please him
[58:46] faith in what faith in the word faith is
[58:49] a part of the word faith comes from the
[58:51] word
[58:53] amen
[58:55] faith is based in the word if you have
[58:57] your faith based in something else it's
[58:59] the wrong faith
[59:01] but faith is in the word
[59:03] and it comes by hearing receiving the
[59:05] word
[59:06] all right now so the key doesn't come
[59:09] but for the steel to kill destroy but he
[59:12] said I am come
[59:14] how many believe he has come
[59:17] he comes every day he's coming in you
[59:20] hello
[59:21] where's this coming today
[59:25] in you
[59:26] right in you so it's not far away we
[59:29] have everything we need to have all the
[59:31] authority we need we have the word we
[59:33] need we have everything we need in you
[59:37] there's our North Star in me
[59:42] in you
[59:44] there's where there's where my absolute
[59:47] is there's there's the one I trust
[59:51] in me
[59:54] all right
[59:56] so I am come that they might have life
[59:58] the thief comes to kill destroy and
[1:00:00] steal he comes to steal life kill you
[1:00:03] take your life and destroy
[1:00:06] he'll do everything he can if he can
[1:00:08] destroy that word and you're that word
[1:00:12] but he can't kill the word but he's
[1:00:15] trying to stop you from manifesting the
[1:00:17] word because the manifestation of the
[1:00:19] word is what makes him upset
[1:00:25] but that's your calling that's your
[1:00:27] position is the manifestation of the
[1:00:30] word
[1:00:32] that's what you're called to do in this
[1:00:33] hour that's what you're here for
[1:00:37] as I said he should be the Little Wheel
[1:00:39] in the middle of the wheel everything we
[1:00:41] do ought to revolve around him not him
[1:00:44] revolve around my way myself my thought
[1:00:48] my ambition my my my eye if he ever
[1:00:52] comes in and comes and lives in you
[1:00:54] listen this is now his body
[1:00:58] that really changed my way of praying
[1:01:01] not too long ago instead of saying I
[1:01:03] will do I Lord no it's he in me it's
[1:01:07] just his body I dwell in him and he
[1:01:10] dwells in me
[1:01:11] I and him and he and me and now what the
[1:01:14] scripture said I in him
[1:01:16] that's my Dwelling Place
[1:01:18] and he comes and dwells in me that's
[1:01:20] perfect Oneness
[1:01:22] amen he comes and takes up the boat and
[1:01:24] a body that he's has Sanctified and
[1:01:26] comes and lives in it
[1:01:30] but you know what he's wanting he's
[1:01:32] wanting you to take the authority he's
[1:01:34] given you and make a choice to put him
[1:01:37] as a head over it
[1:01:38] that's what the wife does
[1:01:41] she gives her husband headship
[1:01:45] amen
[1:01:47] amen and she's happy to Delight in his
[1:01:50] word because his word is her
[1:01:54] keeping power her work his word is her
[1:01:56] absolute the ultimate the amen his word
[1:01:59] is life his word is Deliverance
[1:02:03] it's joy peace happiness down the line
[1:02:05] with healing
[1:02:07] strength
[1:02:09] everything I need every day is provided
[1:02:12] for me
[1:02:13] I just have to take it
[1:02:16] accept it
[1:02:18] all right
[1:02:20] but as I said the thief cometh
[1:02:23] that's my title The Thief coming
[1:02:26] daily
[1:02:28] the thief cometh
[1:02:30] and I'm speaking of distractions
[1:02:33] oh my we could go on and on daily about
[1:02:35] distractions couldn't we but I want to
[1:02:37] focus on a certain thing that I think is
[1:02:39] a real key distraction today and I'll
[1:02:42] bring you some quotes the prophet said
[1:02:44] here
[1:02:47] it's a simple message
[1:02:49] all right tonight's a simple message but
[1:02:53] it's the simple things that go
[1:02:54] underneath some and over others
[1:02:58] father I thank you that you've hid these
[1:03:00] things in the word but you've hidden
[1:03:01] from the wise and prudent
[1:03:04] you can't figure it out
[1:03:05] but it's laying right there but you
[1:03:08] can't know it until he comes in you to
[1:03:10] reveal it
[1:03:11] without him you never would know the
[1:03:13] word knowing meaning uh uh uh knowing is
[1:03:17] more than just head knowledge
[1:03:20] it's knowing
[1:03:22] as in a marriage knowing
[1:03:25] no one else knows him like you know him
[1:03:30] amen
[1:03:32] nobody can know him like the bride knows
[1:03:34] him
[1:03:37] intimately
[1:03:39] all right
[1:03:41] so I am come to give life
[1:03:44] Jesus said that they may have life and
[1:03:47] that they may not only have it but they
[1:03:49] have it more abundantly
[1:03:51] an abundance of life
[1:03:54] but what you got to do to receive it I
[1:03:56] mean get it receive it
[1:03:59] operate with it he's given it to you
[1:04:02] he's given it to you to live by man
[1:04:05] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:04:07] every word
[1:04:08] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[1:04:12] do you believe this message has come
[1:04:13] from the mouth of God sir it has brother
[1:04:16] Branham isn't God
[1:04:17] but it's come from the mouth of God the
[1:04:19] sword was placed into the the lamb step
[1:04:22] forth the lion in the form of that lamb
[1:04:25] step forth and placed that sword in the
[1:04:27] hands of the seventh angel to deliver
[1:04:29] the Lamb's message
[1:04:31] and claim his claiming of the Bride in
[1:04:35] this hour in this day all the bride he
[1:04:38] claims her he's redeemed her now he
[1:04:40] comes to claim her
[1:04:44] all right so
[1:04:46] but he has come to give life and that
[1:04:49] more abundantly Hebrews chapter 2.
[1:04:58] therefore we ought to verse one
[1:05:00] therefore we ought to give the more
[1:05:02] Earnest heed
[1:05:04] a brother sister
[1:05:06] this is the word of the Lord
[1:05:09] if you really believe that
[1:05:12] it would be your absolute we need to
[1:05:15] take it seriously do you realize what he
[1:05:18] has done for us and come down in our day
[1:05:20] and here in our presence today we do we
[1:05:23] really do we really know that
[1:05:27] and in communion with him
[1:05:29] like we should be
[1:05:31] see it's a revelation knowing he's here
[1:05:34] he's present he's in us he's with us
[1:05:36] he's walking with are you walking with
[1:05:38] God see
[1:05:42] then we want everything we do or think
[1:05:44] whatever we say Lord let it please you
[1:05:47] how do we please him faith in his word
[1:05:53] not whose Faith whose Faith his faith
[1:05:56] the believer is the faith of God
[1:05:59] that moves in you that substance
[1:06:02] all right his substance now but
[1:06:04] therefore we ought to give them more
[1:06:06] Earnest heed to the things which we have
[1:06:08] heard
[1:06:09] now this is things which we have heard
[1:06:13] you're sitting here tonight having heard
[1:06:14] many things
[1:06:16] having heard much on the word then we
[1:06:18] ought to give the more the more the more
[1:06:20] the more Ernest heed
[1:06:23] to the things which we have heard
[1:06:27] lest at any time
[1:06:30] we should let them slip
[1:06:35] then there's a possibility that they can
[1:06:37] slip
[1:06:39] because we got our Focus wrong we've got
[1:06:42] our attention in the wrong place we got
[1:06:43] our what Satan has used something to
[1:06:46] distract us and we're we're we're
[1:06:48] putting that before us taking time with
[1:06:51] that when the word is slipping the word
[1:06:54] that he's given us the Deliverance the
[1:06:56] Salvation the strength is slipping away
[1:07:00] the Rapture the going home do you
[1:07:03] realize how important this day is
[1:07:06] what if you're left here tomorrow
[1:07:09] and some of us sitting right here are
[1:07:11] gone
[1:07:13] what are you going to do you're left
[1:07:14] here for tribulation you don't want to
[1:07:16] be left here because that's a
[1:07:18] purification time
[1:07:20] and that purification won't come easy
[1:07:24] amen you've missed it
[1:07:26] that ought to be enough to take heed to
[1:07:29] what he said that ought to be enough
[1:07:30] right there say Lord don't let me miss
[1:07:32] it it ought to be a desperation and the
[1:07:34] reason there isn't the desperation there
[1:07:36] should be it's a lack of love for this
[1:07:38] word
[1:07:42] that's right
[1:07:44] it ought to be it ought to be our
[1:07:46] everyday
[1:07:48] Earnest number one desire I want to be I
[1:07:52] want more of you Lord Closer to You Lord
[1:08:00] so we should take heed lest at any time
[1:08:03] we let them slip for the word spoken by
[1:08:05] Angels Messengers
[1:08:07] was steadfast and every transgression
[1:08:11] and disobedience
[1:08:12] see that word of Messengers was God's
[1:08:15] word it was steadfast we had a messenger
[1:08:17] what are we doing with it
[1:08:19] are we adding our own ideas to it and
[1:08:22] say well I don't have to agree with it
[1:08:23] that way just like that I don't believe
[1:08:25] it just that way be careful because we
[1:08:28] have a perfect interpretation of the son
[1:08:30] of man himself has given us this message
[1:08:35] and one of the proofs of the indwelling
[1:08:37] spirit is taking heed to what the
[1:08:39] prophet said
[1:08:41] did you know that that's one of the
[1:08:43] proofs of having the indwelling of the
[1:08:45] Holy Spirit living in you is that you
[1:08:47] take heed will obey what the prophet
[1:08:48] says because the prophets had the
[1:08:51] interpretation of the word for their day
[1:08:55] amen
[1:08:58] all right so
[1:09:01] we need to be seeking God
[1:09:04] every day
[1:09:05] we ought to be we ought to be seeking
[1:09:07] him we ought to be drawing close to him
[1:09:10] every day
[1:09:13] you say well I can't do that I'll tell
[1:09:15] you yes you can you can have your
[1:09:16] meditation while you're at work you can
[1:09:18] still have your mind and focus upon the
[1:09:20] word and doing the work
[1:09:23] it's on your heart it's in your thoughts
[1:09:26] don't mean you have to sit down and just
[1:09:28] do this no you can worship him every
[1:09:30] single day
[1:09:31] and say Lord I give you every moment of
[1:09:34] my time and my life and when things
[1:09:36] arise here immediately you say that's
[1:09:38] not the word that's why because you're
[1:09:40] meditating your meditation of your soul
[1:09:43] is on him
[1:09:46] amen all right you can be I you can be
[1:09:50] thinking of something else and God will
[1:09:52] come right and quick and something to
[1:09:53] you ever had that happen thinking of
[1:09:55] doing something he may be barbering
[1:09:57] somewhere and doing something telling
[1:09:58] the guy is something Quicken to you your
[1:10:00] soul comes alive
[1:10:04] amen
[1:10:09] all right
[1:10:11] I can be preaching the word up here and
[1:10:12] something will strike me
[1:10:15] amen talking to somebody else expressing
[1:10:18] something and there it is alive the word
[1:10:23] not all of us had the same jobs and the
[1:10:25] same work and we got to go to work we go
[1:10:27] to jobs but be aware
[1:10:30] the enemy is going to do everything he
[1:10:32] can to distract you away from your
[1:10:34] meditation
[1:10:35] on Christ
[1:10:38] he's going to pull you aside he's going
[1:10:40] to bring something up in your reasoning
[1:10:41] something in your memory something in
[1:10:43] your imagination something where you
[1:10:45] know you fell yesterday when you did
[1:10:47] that and you did this and and then
[1:10:49] turned something around somebody said
[1:10:50] and
[1:10:52] how do we Conor that
[1:10:54] going back to the word
[1:10:57] he said how do I do that he'll bring it
[1:11:00] to your remembrance
[1:11:01] one of the keys of the of the indwelling
[1:11:03] of the Holy Spirit one of the evidence
[1:11:05] is that it he will bring these things
[1:11:07] that I've spoken to your remembrance
[1:11:10] and teach you things to come reveal them
[1:11:14] okay reveal the word now getting back to
[1:11:17] our thought here verse 2 for if the word
[1:11:20] spoken by Angels was steadfast
[1:11:23] and it was and every transgression and
[1:11:26] Disobedience received a just
[1:11:28] recompense of reward
[1:11:31] you remember
[1:11:33] if you sow the wrong seed you're going
[1:11:37] to reap the wrong one
[1:11:39] even though you're still a believer
[1:11:42] but the things you say and the things
[1:11:44] you do remember
[1:11:46] if they're not right and you're doing
[1:11:48] the wrong thing you will see they're
[1:11:50] just recompense
[1:11:52] of reward
[1:11:54] as a correction
[1:11:57] how many's been corrected before my yes
[1:12:00] God corrects us doesn't he that's his
[1:12:02] love for you
[1:12:04] every see that's what the Bible said he
[1:12:08] he that correcteth chastise us it's
[1:12:11] because he loves us
[1:12:13] what if he didn't do that and let you go
[1:12:15] on
[1:12:17] and then come at the end and say well
[1:12:19] see you did this and this and this but I
[1:12:20] didn't know it Lord
[1:12:24] okay
[1:12:27] so how shall we escape
[1:12:29] verse 3 if we neglect so great salvation
[1:12:33] which at the first began to be spoken by
[1:12:36] the Lord
[1:12:38] and was confirmed unto us by them that
[1:12:40] hurt him so we've seen the word spoken
[1:12:43] we've seen it confirmed
[1:12:46] amen
[1:12:51] God bear also bearing them Witness
[1:12:55] both with signs and wonders with divers
[1:12:57] Miracles and the gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:59] according to his own will
[1:13:02] amen all right
[1:13:09] I've got some things here I want to
[1:13:10] share maybe a couple of the scriptures
[1:13:12] here
[1:13:17] and I think I'll just take some of these
[1:13:18] quotes here first
[1:13:21] and I'm going to deal on a certain thing
[1:13:23] called
[1:13:25] and we would they and back then it was
[1:13:27] something the prophet called television
[1:13:30] but today
[1:13:32] it's in your hand
[1:13:36] it's on the end it's on the screen at
[1:13:39] home
[1:13:41] it's called internet
[1:13:43] the web
[1:13:47] ah now Brother David you're just
[1:13:49] nitpicking you can call it that if you
[1:13:51] want
[1:13:52] but I would take heed to it
[1:13:54] because Satan has fought tooth and nail
[1:13:56] about me saying this or somebody here
[1:13:58] someone maybe others myself God's dealt
[1:14:02] with me about this I wouldn't be
[1:14:03] bringing it to you
[1:14:07] but I think it's an issue and I think
[1:14:09] it's a great distraction
[1:14:12] and the Devil is a Master with using it
[1:14:14] and getting you to use it
[1:14:16] and it looks very innocent
[1:14:18] but it's taking your time that you could
[1:14:21] be spending with the word
[1:14:26] it's drawing your attention over on
[1:14:28] other things your thoughts your thoughts
[1:14:30] are drawn to another realm all right
[1:14:39] so we're going to speak of that Prophet
[1:14:40] said a lot about it believe it or not he
[1:14:42] he said he wasn't for it
[1:14:45] he said I'd never have one in my home
[1:14:47] what would he do with internet today
[1:14:50] he'd give the same morning he did about
[1:14:52] television
[1:14:54] he said it could have been used for a
[1:14:56] good thing but Satan got into it
[1:14:58] and Satan got into this
[1:15:01] now I'm not saying go out and trash your
[1:15:03] internet or thrash your computer that's
[1:15:05] not what I'm talking about I'm talking
[1:15:07] about distraction
[1:15:09] the thief cometh not but for to steal so
[1:15:12] when he comes he's stealing something
[1:15:13] from you to get your
[1:15:15] get your attention over here on
[1:15:17] something else
[1:15:21] he comes to steal he comes to
[1:15:25] he comes to destroy
[1:15:28] amen and to kill
[1:15:31] so is full intent
[1:15:34] is to keep you out of Truth
[1:15:38] to keep you away from the word keep you
[1:15:40] away from the truth if we didn't have
[1:15:43] the blood brother sister we're all
[1:15:44] finished
[1:15:47] that's the truth we've done we've done
[1:15:49] messed up already a long time ago
[1:15:52] is that right and we've rebelled many
[1:15:54] times and did it again and again and
[1:15:56] again
[1:15:57] until God stopped it one day and I speak
[1:16:00] of myself and said listen you have a
[1:16:02] choice and it hit me right between the
[1:16:04] eyes I said Lord that's right
[1:16:06] I'm asking you to take it from me and
[1:16:09] Lord saying but it's right in your hands
[1:16:11] to do it
[1:16:17] you have a choice
[1:16:20] and don't worry the devil's tried to
[1:16:22] come anywhere a little way he can by
[1:16:24] even by curiosity why that looks like an
[1:16:28] interesting thing and you open it up and
[1:16:30] it can be just simply on the news
[1:16:32] headlines on the front of your phone
[1:16:37] well what's wrong with a little bit of
[1:16:39] news nothing
[1:16:42] necessarily
[1:16:44] but when it becomes a distraction you
[1:16:46] move into it what do you see next thing
[1:16:48] well next thing the next thing and the
[1:16:50] next thing is a whole list of things you
[1:16:51] start going through it the next thing
[1:16:53] you know you're on it for an hour or two
[1:16:56] what happened
[1:16:58] because Satan opened up a little window
[1:17:00] here and you went to that
[1:17:02] amen
[1:17:05] see how subtle he can be you know he's
[1:17:07] subtle
[1:17:08] he's a lot wiser than you are in your
[1:17:10] mental thinking
[1:17:12] you can't outsmart him I can guarantee
[1:17:14] you it takes the Holy Ghost to correct
[1:17:17] and to hold steady and I said thank God
[1:17:21] for the redeeming power of the blood
[1:17:23] because we air every day we backslide
[1:17:27] every little day and I'm not doing that
[1:17:28] and you better not be trying to do it
[1:17:30] nor I intentionally
[1:17:32] say well it doesn't matter the Lord will
[1:17:34] be okay it'll be no listen you can do
[1:17:36] anything you want but there's one thing
[1:17:38] you don't want to do and that's to
[1:17:39] displease the Lord because he's given
[1:17:41] you himself and that's the word
[1:17:44] and if you're really a married woman to
[1:17:46] him
[1:17:47] you'll want to please him
[1:17:51] amen
[1:17:53] all right
[1:17:55] says it's easy for our old what what's
[1:17:58] happened to your church you've seen so
[1:18:00] much television I'm putting television I
[1:18:03] don't think there's too much on
[1:18:04] television anymore but television has
[1:18:06] become on the internet internet's
[1:18:07] Television Internet this internet that
[1:18:09] internet TV internet
[1:18:14] news
[1:18:17] well of course I want to find out what
[1:18:19] how Maui fared out you know and want to
[1:18:21] look at that and look at that next thing
[1:18:22] but you've gone through all these other
[1:18:24] things
[1:18:25] next thing is the video you got to watch
[1:18:27] and all in that Suite how that little
[1:18:28] baby jumps around does this and plays
[1:18:30] this and does that okay that's fine but
[1:18:33] what is it doing
[1:18:35] it's a distraction and especially when
[1:18:37] you've had your heart on the word and
[1:18:39] said no I'm gonna I want to read this
[1:18:41] scripture the Lord's laid some things on
[1:18:42] your heart and Satan immediately
[1:18:44] distracts you put your attention over on
[1:18:46] something else
[1:18:47] listen I know
[1:18:49] I was just a young man
[1:18:52] way back I wrote said in my Bible Lord
[1:18:54] and he showed me he showed me you're
[1:18:57] giving in to this
[1:19:00] I'm wanting you you put a message on
[1:19:02] your heart to read I put something to
[1:19:03] feed on here and immediately you've got
[1:19:05] something better to do Satan pointed you
[1:19:07] to something else and for me I was
[1:19:09] hunting I loved hunting and pointing to
[1:19:11] well remember I had outdoor life well I
[1:19:12] have to be all right if I just would
[1:19:14] read that receive what's happened
[1:19:16] distracted me
[1:19:20] and I'm caught up in that why because
[1:19:21] it's fleshly
[1:19:23] it's things that satisfy your flesh
[1:19:26] do you realize that this word doesn't
[1:19:28] satisfy your flesh it makes it bitter
[1:19:35] see what I'm saying but it also delivers
[1:19:37] your flesh
[1:19:39] but you're going to bear in it see so
[1:19:41] you say well feeding on the word just
[1:19:42] doesn't satisfy what does it satisfy I
[1:19:45] hope it's satisfying something and
[1:19:46] you're not doing it just because just
[1:19:48] because
[1:19:50] well I gotta read a scripture and I got
[1:19:52] to read just this and this and I would
[1:19:54] just do that and I've done my duty
[1:19:55] that's an attitude that's the attitude
[1:19:59] The Moldy the objective deep down of a
[1:20:02] lot of people
[1:20:03] instead of doing it to receive more and
[1:20:06] want to know more of him more about him
[1:20:07] to receive something from him you're
[1:20:09] doing it because well I've done my duty
[1:20:12] you'll never get anywhere with that
[1:20:14] you'll never get anywhere with works
[1:20:16] trying to satisfy the Lord through works
[1:20:19] it's a love affair
[1:20:23] I believe in good works but where's the
[1:20:25] motive of it where is it coming from
[1:20:28] okay
[1:20:33] it's the distraction of it I'm not
[1:20:35] saying you shouldn't read that something
[1:20:37] in the news but watch out because watch
[1:20:40] what God is doing what you're giving
[1:20:42] time for when you could have been giving
[1:20:44] it to something else and he's given you
[1:20:46] that time for him that thirst
[1:20:49] that you're trying to satisfy through
[1:20:51] other things
[1:20:53] all right
[1:20:55] what's happened to your church you've
[1:20:57] seen so much television so much things
[1:20:59] in the world it's easy for your old Adam
[1:21:01] nature to drift into that to act like
[1:21:03] the rest of them
[1:21:09] all right you want to know where that
[1:21:10] comes from message leadership
[1:21:14] leadership
[1:21:16] interesting
[1:21:18] Prophet would bring that under a message
[1:21:19] of leadership leadership of what eternal
[1:21:22] life
[1:21:23] Christ in you
[1:21:32] he said
[1:21:34] True predestinated Believers will stay
[1:21:36] with the word because they are part of
[1:21:38] that word o wandering Stars how long
[1:21:40] will you want Wonder
[1:21:43] you Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[1:21:45] Outsiders whatever you might be
[1:21:47] wandering stars from church to church
[1:21:49] from pillar to place and television to
[1:21:51] television world to world or Internet I
[1:21:54] said I'm going to make Television
[1:21:55] Internet
[1:21:56] so internet to internet
[1:21:58] he is longing for you he wants to
[1:22:01] transform you by the renewing of your
[1:22:03] mind he longs to have fellowship with
[1:22:05] you
[1:22:09] he said he wants to transform you by the
[1:22:12] renewing of your mind not to the church
[1:22:14] or to the denomination but to his word
[1:22:17] which you are part of if that desire is
[1:22:20] in you
[1:22:21] you are a part of if that desire is in
[1:22:24] you what are you Desiring
[1:22:29] you know what's in your soul by what you
[1:22:32] desire
[1:22:35] if you're Desiring him
[1:22:37] you're part of him
[1:22:39] well I made mistakes still a part of him
[1:22:42] all right
[1:22:44] I'm not just Christian de-christianizing
[1:22:46] you if I am I'm de-christianizing myself
[1:22:48] I'm not telling you because well if you
[1:22:51] do that you're just completely lost no
[1:22:52] we're talking about the subtleness of
[1:22:54] Satan and God's wanting you to know you
[1:22:56] can be free of it it's your choice
[1:23:01] you know when he's distracting you and
[1:23:03] it don't have to be this can be other
[1:23:04] things
[1:23:06] and I and I'm saying you the things we
[1:23:09] do and there's things there's a time and
[1:23:11] a place for everything okay there's a
[1:23:13] time but what are you seeing what are
[1:23:15] you watching what is it producing we're
[1:23:17] going to come to another scripture in in
[1:23:19] a moment here what Paul spoke of in
[1:23:21] Philippians
[1:23:23] what it does I'm trying to get to that
[1:23:25] and I will try to go along real quickly
[1:23:28] here I don't have my local watch up here
[1:23:32] all right it's dead well that's good
[1:23:35] all right
[1:23:40] I'm just going to bypass some of these
[1:23:42] there's lots of things
[1:23:44] foreign he said oh today we're getting
[1:23:47] so slothful the church is getting so
[1:23:49] worldly
[1:23:51] and he's preaching this on a message
[1:23:53] called the presence of God unrecognized
[1:23:56] that's what's happening
[1:23:58] and so indifferent and so their minds
[1:24:00] they're getting so worldly and so
[1:24:02] indifferent and their minds are muddled
[1:24:03] up with Television Internet we love
[1:24:06] Susie and some of these old things and
[1:24:08] staying home that shows where the
[1:24:10] people's hearts are and you can tell
[1:24:13] them these things are wrong and they
[1:24:14] think you're crazy what is it Lover's a
[1:24:17] pleasure more than lovers of God see
[1:24:19] oh the greatest pleasure watch what the
[1:24:21] prophet says the greatest pleasure I
[1:24:23] know of is to be is to be to pray until
[1:24:28] I realize that I'm in the presence of
[1:24:30] God and recognize it
[1:24:34] well I spend I spend this much time in
[1:24:38] prayer I don't care how much time you
[1:24:39] spend what happens
[1:24:43] how sincere are you when you go to
[1:24:45] prayer
[1:24:46] do you make God a messenger boy or do
[1:24:48] you pray to be lifted up to his presence
[1:24:52] amen come into His presence
[1:24:55] he said unrecognized I think we ought to
[1:24:58] be it ought to be the thrill of the
[1:24:59] church is the presence of the Holy
[1:25:01] Spirit seeing that God that made the
[1:25:02] promise standing among us feel his
[1:25:05] presence and see his word and see it
[1:25:07] Vindicated it ought to give Faith to
[1:25:09] make cripples walk blind seed death here
[1:25:11] dumb speak
[1:25:13] it ought to be the opening of the word
[1:25:16] and the word becoming more flesh all the
[1:25:18] time
[1:25:24] you're making those things that you see
[1:25:27] if whether you realize it or not on some
[1:25:29] of those things you see in the internet
[1:25:30] you're making that your example
[1:25:32] there's a great deception in these
[1:25:34] things brother Bram says it is
[1:25:37] he says
[1:25:40] he said the Pentecostals used not to go
[1:25:43] to them dirty filthy picture shows when
[1:25:45] they had such plays the devil put one on
[1:25:47] you and put the television or the
[1:25:49] internet in your house
[1:25:53] are you with me
[1:25:55] and don't tell me it's just not newscast
[1:25:57] I'm talking about
[1:25:59] because one thing leads to another the
[1:26:01] next thing you look at a movie
[1:26:02] well it's okay there's no dirty words
[1:26:04] but yeah but they were kissing and they
[1:26:06] were doing this we'd more is it
[1:26:08] motivated what's it pointing to yeah
[1:26:10] if you can't discern some of these
[1:26:12] Spirits then I say you need the
[1:26:13] discerner
[1:26:17] okay
[1:26:19] now I just leave it like that he put it
[1:26:21] right there he just put one over on you
[1:26:22] instead of going to it's okay
[1:26:26] you put that ahead of the word you put
[1:26:28] that ahead of you and then you presume
[1:26:30] you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:26:32] listen brother sister it's no time to
[1:26:33] presume you have the Holy Ghost
[1:26:36] we better know you have it
[1:26:39] God never intended you to pursue and
[1:26:41] hope I do
[1:26:46] amen you either have or you don't and
[1:26:49] you either know or you don't
[1:26:52] it's not presuming well I have good
[1:26:54] intentions brother Brown's a good
[1:26:56] intentions many have good intentions
[1:27:00] it's not good intentions
[1:27:06] what is this message doing for you
[1:27:07] what's it was it transforming you is it
[1:27:10] changing you
[1:27:13] what is it doing what do you see in your
[1:27:16] life what kind of fruit are you bearing
[1:27:20] is it more of him
[1:27:28] it's a great instrument of Hell brother
[1:27:30] Ram said these television and the it's a
[1:27:33] house Satan that great instrument of
[1:27:35] hell has come down amongst the people
[1:27:36] and deceived them into these things
[1:27:39] amen all right let's go on committing
[1:27:42] okay he said
[1:27:45] now watch it's not only distractions of
[1:27:47] those things it's the destruction of
[1:27:49] music oh they're such nice words
[1:27:52] yeah they're they're
[1:27:56] a little bit modern
[1:27:59] what do we call that modern music it's a
[1:28:01] different name
[1:28:02] temporary
[1:28:04] contemporary that's it yeah it should be
[1:28:07] temporary
[1:28:08] in your life but it's contemporary
[1:28:10] oh it sounds good got a nice beat
[1:28:13] but what is it satisfying your flesh or
[1:28:15] your soul
[1:28:19] nice words
[1:28:22] where where's the source coming from
[1:28:27] oh Satan can do those nice things in
[1:28:30] fact he knows how to he knows how to
[1:28:32] worship as far as we understand worship
[1:28:35] praises and everything and songs so
[1:28:37] beautiful a lot more than you ever
[1:28:39] thought of he was the chief leader of
[1:28:42] that in heaven
[1:28:44] he knows what it is
[1:28:46] be careful about that contemporary
[1:28:51] if it's not speaking and that's the
[1:28:53] problem it's catching a lot of attention
[1:28:56] especially young people
[1:28:58] pulling their hearts the wrong direction
[1:29:03] here's a man that's been in music I've
[1:29:05] been in music I've been in a lot of
[1:29:07] music through my life
[1:29:10] I know what it is brother sister I'm
[1:29:12] telling you be careful
[1:29:14] because it can be a deception it is a
[1:29:17] wrong spirit
[1:29:20] amen
[1:29:22] Satan knows how to put just certain
[1:29:24] words to it
[1:29:27] amen that's right
[1:29:29] all right
[1:29:32] that's why we need Godly music leaders
[1:29:36] why a church needs Godly music leaders
[1:29:38] that have discernment about that kind of
[1:29:41] music
[1:29:44] that's the truth
[1:29:45] amen
[1:29:47] all right
[1:29:49] you need a holy ghost one
[1:29:51] that's why deacons have to be holy ghost
[1:29:52] LED because they have to have
[1:29:54] discernment
[1:29:56] amen
[1:30:06] these movies and things
[1:30:09] he said when you watch that type of
[1:30:11] programs he and this is how I said it
[1:30:13] you and I know you shouldn't be going to
[1:30:15] dances I hope nobody is Boogie Woogie
[1:30:18] parties and watch old dirty television
[1:30:20] internet programs you are committing
[1:30:23] adultery with Christ on him as calling
[1:30:25] him your husband
[1:30:30] amen all right there will come a time in
[1:30:32] the name of the Lord that people will go
[1:30:34] completely insane
[1:30:36] this is on the knoweth that not message
[1:30:38] 65.
[1:30:40] there will come a time when people will
[1:30:42] go completely insane the Bible said so
[1:30:44] they'll scream and holler great hideous
[1:30:46] things in their imaginary mind notice
[1:30:48] the radios and things
[1:30:51] or television programs are producing it
[1:31:01] most of the news today is garbage
[1:31:06] I'm just going to be very Frank with you
[1:31:08] it's garbage
[1:31:09] who cares about whether the Bison did
[1:31:12] this to that one and this and and it's
[1:31:14] just constant everything
[1:31:21] amen I say let the Lord I say God give
[1:31:24] me understanding of what I need to hear
[1:31:27] otherwise let my head be out of it help
[1:31:29] me and he said you make the decision
[1:31:32] you have the discernment you make the
[1:31:34] decision
[1:31:36] I said Thank You Lord that's exactly
[1:31:38] right
[1:31:43] he said he said they're going to see
[1:31:45] things and we know they are and I'm not
[1:31:47] saying you guys people are watching that
[1:31:48] today but they are now watch what it's
[1:31:50] doing to their minds
[1:31:52] he said that's see they're seeing
[1:31:54] prehistoric creatures that's lived in
[1:31:56] the earth so many thousands and millions
[1:31:58] of years hatch and come forth he said
[1:32:00] that's just minor thing to what's going
[1:32:02] to happen
[1:32:05] when hell is open the Devil comes out
[1:32:07] with all his mysterious things see
[1:32:11] Harold hell has opened this widen's
[1:32:14] mouth you can see it everywhere you go
[1:32:18] they can't even make decisions they
[1:32:19] can't make why can't they it's Darkness
[1:32:21] gross Darkness to people they can't
[1:32:23] discern light from dark
[1:32:26] but you're not that way
[1:32:28] and God is concerned about the littlest
[1:32:30] things you say well they ought to be all
[1:32:32] these big things no just what about the
[1:32:34] little foxes
[1:32:36] what about the little foxes that spoil
[1:32:38] the vine and you're connected to the
[1:32:40] Vine
[1:32:42] what's the spoiling the vine connecting
[1:32:44] with the branch in your branch if it
[1:32:47] spoils Divine you're spoiled
[1:32:50] if he can reach into that vine and spoil
[1:32:52] it your connection with it guess what
[1:32:54] you'll wither
[1:32:56] that's right is that right okay all
[1:32:59] right now he said
[1:33:04] he said talk about telling people saying
[1:33:06] they're gospel singers he said I never
[1:33:08] saw a bunch of rookies like I saw on
[1:33:10] that close recording gospel singers
[1:33:13] it was discredited to Jesus Christ to
[1:33:15] see they were carrying on shaking
[1:33:17] themselves and listen I've seen enough
[1:33:19] shaking of people around in message
[1:33:21] churches that it makes me sick to my
[1:33:24] stomach almost
[1:33:28] and especially in the women
[1:33:32] amen that's the truth and they think
[1:33:34] that's a religious move no it's not a
[1:33:36] religious move
[1:33:37] most of them aren't dressed decent
[1:33:39] either
[1:33:40] what you would call holiness
[1:33:43] the Bible the Bible said that present
[1:33:46] your body a Living Sacrifice holy and
[1:33:49] acceptable unto God
[1:33:54] but of course without the Holy Ghost you
[1:33:56] wouldn't discern what was holy and
[1:33:57] acceptable anyway
[1:33:59] now I'm not talking about out here in
[1:34:01] the world they've got that I'm talking
[1:34:03] about in message churches the message
[1:34:05] Arena not here say here message Arena
[1:34:08] don't take your cues from that
[1:34:12] Amen Let the Holy Spirit come in it'll
[1:34:15] be holy
[1:34:16] you'll wanna you'll want to cover
[1:34:18] yourself
[1:34:24] all right
[1:34:26] the world will go completely totally
[1:34:28] insane it's not but just one degree from
[1:34:30] it now
[1:34:31] that's back in 65 where is it now in
[1:34:35] 2023 it's not one degree it's here
[1:34:40] what he said Has Come
[1:34:42] and it's only going to get worse and
[1:34:43] worse
[1:34:45] but thank God for the protection the
[1:34:46] guidance the strength I would say we
[1:34:48] better draw night to him we better let
[1:34:51] it be our meditation every day
[1:34:53] amen
[1:34:59] and don't try to just get under the wire
[1:35:01] on things and do things you know are
[1:35:02] wrong
[1:35:05] just kind of under the table type
[1:35:07] situations that's what the devil wants
[1:35:10] you to do well nothing wrong with that
[1:35:11] yeah but you know what a lie is 99 truth
[1:35:20] God doesn't say well I believe all of it
[1:35:22] but some of it I can get by with here
[1:35:24] no
[1:35:25] you want to believe all of it right
[1:35:30] Lord line me up with every bit of it
[1:35:33] all your will
[1:35:40] I'm going to have to bypass this safe
[1:35:42] time now
[1:36:09] brother Graham said that Arizona schools
[1:36:12] at that time was suffering from mental
[1:36:14] deficiency 68 of them was by looking at
[1:36:17] television
[1:36:18] he says how about that
[1:36:20] if that was 68 now what is it who wonder
[1:36:23] why we have such a mental deficiency
[1:36:24] among people
[1:36:27] it's because of what they're feeding on
[1:36:30] probably 99 of the time is what they're
[1:36:32] feeding on
[1:36:34] what if you started feeding on the word
[1:36:35] more
[1:36:36] what comes from that I am come to do
[1:36:39] what bring life and that more abundantly
[1:36:47] just stay with the word the word is the
[1:36:49] answer the word is your deciding factor
[1:36:53] we bring every thought let's go to
[1:36:55] Second Corinthians a minute I know you
[1:36:57] know these things but what did what did
[1:36:58] Paul say he said flee idolatry
[1:37:02] brother Trevor what time is it
[1:37:06] okay anybody know the time
[1:37:09] nine my goodness time to quit
[1:37:13] okay I'm gonna come down to a close here
[1:37:16] second Corinthians 10 5 you know that
[1:37:18] scripture but I'm going to read it
[1:37:20] anyway
[1:37:21] and we'll just I want you to bring every
[1:37:23] thought under obedience
[1:37:25] second Corinthians 10 5.
[1:37:32] casting down imaginations verse 5
[1:37:34] casting down imaginations and every High
[1:37:37] thing that exalteth itself against the
[1:37:39] knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:37:41] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[1:37:44] of Christ
[1:37:47] okay Philippians 4
[1:37:49] let's go to Philippians
[1:37:52] chapter 4.

[1:39:40] and if you don't you need to kick it out
[1:39:44] if you can't control it get rid of it
[1:39:47] amen

[1:45:27] probably dealt with some of us about it
[1:45:28] already

[1:46:32] they're not depending on Sensations and
[1:46:35] feelings I like to feel good but we're
[1:46:37] going to depend upon what he said
[1:46:40] amen

[1:46:52] different but Lord I believe it was

[1:46:57] steps of a good man are ordered of the
[1:46:58] Lord and all things work together for
[1:47:01] good to them that love him so father
[1:47:03] we'd love you we know that this isn't
[1:47:06] just something that's going to pass Lord
[1:47:09] your word will not return void to deal
[1:47:11] with every one of us individually
[1:47:14] over these things the enemy's trying to
[1:47:16] throw distractions and let us be careful

[1:47:21] scene pulling us to draw closer you're
[1:47:23] pulling us Satan going to have something
