situation it means [Music] and so we're looking there to be right in his eyes now let me hurry right along now look at this if i can just play this out if you would just be patient with me we see now what happened we see peter peter he's crying out to the lord you know lord if that be you bid me to come and jesus doesn't say now let me think about this for a while or see if this is that he just says come he bids peter to come and now look my brother and sister peter gets out of the boat now come on this boat didn't have a swim deck he stepped out of a fishing boat that was able to handle the storms the first step he should have just went under or at least that's what happens the last time i stepped out of a boat i went under immediately but what happens peter steps out of the boat brother trevor you imagine the shock it must have been to him that when his foot come down upon the water knee it didn't go to his thigh he was standing there the waves tossing around and he's standing on the water and another foot and another foot he moved off with confidence he started out he's looking at christ i just got saved and the lord's gonna just solve all my problems as a christian i got no more problems what happens is come on if this doesn't apply to your life i'll apologize but i don't believe there's a one here that we didn't walk for a season and then things started popping up in our lives little habits maybe come back up that we thought were gone because we're now a christian little things that would be there a little baggage that wave look at the size of that doctor bill look at the picture on that x-ray look at my situation he stepped out there do you realize at the moment you realize that the moment he was close to the boat he felt security if anything goes wrong i can always swim back to the boat but imagine if we can just picture this some people have in their mind he was two or three steps away from the boat no my brother and sister i believe that god has come and he's not here just to deliver us just because we're close he come to deliver us in every situation in every avenue and no matter our age or how many years we've been serving him and it was there that peter got out and you might say the cares of life got a hold of him and a circumstance my present circumstance he may be like some of you wait here i don't want you to be offended so i'm going to just come out here and sit down and i'll just say this some of you sitting in church tonight are thinking about tomorrow some of you in church tonight are thinking about well it might as well be yesterday it was earlier today but it's behind you many of you are thinking about what you should have said to your husband or your wife or your child or your parent sorry didn't mean to quiet you all down so much what happened peter's mind went from christ and went to his present circumstance and he didn't just i don't believe saints i feel strongly about this i have no way to prove this i don't believe that peter just took the next step and went under it started coming to his ankles into a calf to a knee to a thigh to a waste but in the beauty of this of what christ has done he didn't just go wow peter yes know what you do he says oh my i could just about get excited tonight amen we start to walk we don't do this you know what you know what happens come on saints i want you don't admit it to me i want you to admit it yourself how many of you have a safe place you have a safe place visiting minister comes and he preaches and you don't necessarily agree with him you don't go out on a limb and say you know what i'm just going to say i believe this the man of god i'm going to say amen to this no we we retreat back to the safe place say well i can just i can just think about tomorrow sometimes the safe places our own ideas i have a revelation i'm telling you if i literally if i could buy memory recounty all the times i've had people approach me and say well i i liked your preaching tonight brother paul i liked your preaching you know this a lot happens in south america or you know argentina and chile and i i liked your preaching tonight paul but this one little part right here that wasn't what we were taught well okay i'm not arrogant enough to declare you're wrong but i am bold enough to say i have i have what our lord jesus said and i have what a prophet said i'm not arrogant enough to tell you you're just flat wrong but i want to be confident this is something i'm going to put it this way i want to be confident enough to be able to say let's go back to the word and lord help me as we go back to the word to not bumble around because i'm nervous because of this and because of that but lord give me the right words and give me a courage bold to be able to speak the gospel of jesus christ with confidence amen so we start to walk we don't realize our safe place has to be left behind us so if you're tonight saints dwelling in a safe place i can't fully give myself to the lord because i gotta i gotta keep myself safe really i'm telling you it reminds me of a deal i've seen once the bodyguards there and and the the person that they're trying to harm is yelling at him why don't you go uh why don't you go get them or whatever and the bar matches i want to ask you if god said he'd be our provider would he not then match a provider he says i'm your healer would he not then match as a word use the word like profile match the profile of a healer of a deliverer of our savior of a bridegroom no my brother and sister we're not in a man-made message we're in a message that god's come down and he's proving to a people in this generation i match profile i match this word of what i said i would be and what i said i would do and if you will get out of the boat you'll get off of your own ideas of what it takes to make the rapture what it takes to deal with your situation and just keep your eyes on me because you see we live in laodicea a prophet said it'd be the most wicked age we have no clue we read the story some of them pretty scary but when you look today my brother and sister i was just talking with an individual it was a little graphic and i didn't mean to but it's true story
