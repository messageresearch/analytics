[40:40] amen how beautiful it is to be able to
[40:43] Worship the
[40:46] Lord we live in a day just as I was
[40:50] studying this last week we live in a day
[40:53] that so much prophecy coming to pass and
[40:57] yet people say was it prophecy yeah when
[41:00] the prophet of God said this is what it
[41:02] will be in that day that's prophecy but
[41:07] it's also the word the word showed us
[41:11] you know I I I I don't say this to be
[41:14] funny but I'm starting to have a little
[41:16] sympathy for those in Sodom because when
[41:19] you realize that this day will be like
[41:22] Sodom was
[41:24] Sodom was a wreck
[41:27] and you know the people we can have a
[41:30] very um hard
[41:34] opinion you know the the people but my
[41:37] brother and sister we're looking at a
[41:39] day now that people just don't even know
[41:41] what to believe you you visit with
[41:43] people and they say I I I think or I
[41:47] desire but there's nothing there to to
[41:49] move them forward nothing there for them
[41:51] to take a hold of and yet there's not a
[41:56] a real desire in them to pursue it you
[41:59] try to share truth and and they're
[42:01] afraid of being deceived so they won't
[42:03] they won't move so we are a blessed
[42:08] people much more than we we recognize
[42:11] amen obviously been announce the youth
[42:13] banquet please be praying amen I just
[42:16] believe it'll be a wonderful time for
[42:19] the young people to enjoy themselves to
[42:21] meet uh uh other young people and renew
[42:25] friendships and uh we just look at that
[42:28] and then brother rap will be speaking
[42:30] here at the church on Sunday uh and
[42:33] we're looking forward to that also I
[42:36] also have a little note here um uh
[42:39] personal note remember brother saleim uh
[42:42] he still does not have a job has went to
[42:46] interviews applied and uh he he
[42:49] certainly uh needs the Lord to come on
[42:51] this scene and and help him to find a
[42:54] job sister Wonder his natural sister um
[42:58] sister Wander is uh Desiring a job that
[43:01] would allow her to be in church um that
[43:04] wouldn't be such a difficult schedule
[43:06] for her life uh and um I I have to
[43:10] applaud her our sister because um
[43:13] sometimes you know she gets off work
[43:16] like last Sunday she got off work and
[43:19] has hardly any time to rest and then
[43:21] she's coming to church and we certainly
[43:25] uh would desire the Lord to bless her
[43:28] for for that effort so good to see each
[43:31] and every one of you amen uh you guys I
[43:35] miss you and uh Camden Logan uh I really
[43:40] miss you guys's faces and sister Sammy
[43:42] you have wonderful Sons uh and um uh we
[43:47] just say God bless you and it's good to
[43:49] see you here today and everyone of you
[43:52] amen let's just go right into the word
[43:54] of God I appreciate our our uh helpful
[43:57] hands today um you know uh for the music
[44:04] and uh for
[44:06] others uh sister Donna
[44:09] Conquering the young men in the basement
[44:13] uh just appreciate that to be able to
[44:16] cover that and and each one of you I
[44:19] feel very appreciative today God bless
[44:22] you amen I want to speak to you today on
[44:26] our vision of Victory and um when we
[44:30] look at this the reason that I settled
[44:32] on this title not only uh because it
[44:35] fits very much into the scripture but
[44:38] you know my brother and sister it what
[44:40] you what you think is going to happen uh
[44:45] will often times you say well I I don't
[44:48] I don't think I can I can do this uh can
[44:52] you really put 100% effort in something
[44:55] you don't think you can accomplish I
[44:59] would say in the human element you
[45:01] don't but yet if we would have a vision
[45:04] of
[45:05] Victory then we would look at this and
[45:07] we would say no matter what happens in
[45:10] the world
[45:11] today amen I I don't know how much you
[45:14] pay attention to news I I go online and
[45:18] I click on that and you know what you
[45:20] see in the news is what they want you to
[45:22] see in the news right the other side of
[45:25] the story doesn't often appear it's what
[45:27] they want you to see and yet my brother
[45:30] and sister there's profit and Chaos so
[45:33] they don't mind making the whole message
[45:35] a message of chaos but we are Sons and
[45:37] Daughters of God we have the word of God
[45:40] and the message that has come to us is
[45:43] not a message of chaos it is a message
[45:46] of Peace it is a message of redemption
[45:49] it's a message of God's promises coming
[45:52] to pass in our life and so we can look
[45:55] at the evening news as it were the
[45:57] morning news and we can choose to follow
[45:59] that or we can follow the good news and
[46:02] the good news is pointing to a positive
[46:05] outcome for you and I I'm not worried
[46:08] about financial crisis I'm not worried
[46:10] about Armageddon I'm not worried about
[46:12] the things that the prophet of God said
[46:14] that the bride of Christ would be
[46:16] redeemed before they took place and so
[46:19] I'm just going to believe that and and I
[46:21] I'll put this out my brother and sister
[46:24] no matter what we believe as Christians
[46:26] no matter the differing of our opinion
[46:29] if you're not fully committed you're not
[46:31] committed and so some people say well I
[46:34] I want to I want to uh keep ourselves
[46:36] protected I don't want to get too
[46:38] extreme I don't want to get too far out
[46:40] on the limb just in case I hear to
[46:42] cracking my brother and sister as we've
[46:45] been called by the word of God in this
[46:47] hour let's be committed amen let's turn
[46:50] in our Bibles amen sister Wonder
[46:53] wonderful to see you amen there coming
[46:57] in amen let's turn 1 Corinthians the
[47:00] 15th chapter and uh verse
[47:04] 51-58 and um as we'll talk on this our
[47:08] vision of Victory we'll realize that uh
[47:12] the word of God has so clearly stated uh
[47:15] our position for us and uh as we'll sit
[47:19] there if we choose not to to take our
[47:23] position who do we have to blame there's
[47:27] so many people today sorry to say this
[47:29] as it might sound negative but I don't
[47:31] mean it that way but my brother and
[47:33] sister so many people have turned and
[47:35] walked away from the message and as you
[47:38] interact with them you what they offer
[47:41] up as a reason my brother and sister is
[47:43] not really a reason it's an excuse and
[47:46] they were not committed they weren't
[47:49] willing to to take the final step they
[47:52] actually were anointed then without
[47:54] being committed you know let me put it
[47:57] this way when you are on the
[48:03] fence what influence is the greatest
[48:05] offense uh uh effect upon
[48:08] you there is a phrase that I come across
[48:11] here recently positive move positive
[48:15] news moves you an inch negative news
[48:19] moves you a mile and so it all depends
[48:23] see straddling the fence what will
[48:25] happen to us the influence that will
[48:26] come we will find that the negative
[48:29] Satan's there 24 hours a day anointing
[48:32] that you can't live it it's got
[48:34] something wrong this this this and this
[48:37] and you look at that and then the word
[48:39] of God comes and says I've got a proven
[48:41] track record from the foundation of the
[48:42] world I'm here to tell you just trust my
[48:45] word God gives us a few words Satan
[48:48] gives us thousands of words God offers
[48:53] believe it or not a little evidence
[48:57] Satan offers a lot now you say whatat do
[49:01] you mean offers a little
[49:03] evidence God is not going to pound
[49:09] you Satan
[49:11] does so God says just believe my word
[49:15] trust me Satan says I've got Rams of
[49:18] evidence why it can't be so my brother
[49:21] and sister we are subject that's
[49:25] why the television Vision the prophet
[49:27] God said could have been a great tool
[49:30] for the
[49:31] gospel but Satan got a holds of
[49:34] it and if you
[49:36] go I'm not encouraging to go by
[49:39] television so you can confirm this but
[49:42] if you go and what you see of the Gospel
[49:45] on television
[49:47] today it's not the gospel we were called
[49:50] to serve so even in the good news it's
[49:54] still bad news but we're here for the
[49:58] good news 1 Corinthians
[50:00] 15:51 behold I show you a mystery we
[50:05] shall not all sleep but we shall be
[50:07] shall all be changed in a moment in the
[50:11] twinkling of an eye at the last Trump
[50:13] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[50:16] shall be raised
[50:17] Incorruptible we shall be changed amen
[50:21] not we hope to be right we shall be
[50:25] changed for corruptible must put on
[50:28] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[50:31] immortality so when this corruptible
[50:34] shall have put on incorruption and this
[50:37] Mortal shall have put on immortality
[50:39] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[50:42] that is written death is swallowed up in
[50:45] Victory can we say amen and thank you
[50:48] Lord amen oh death where is thy sting oh
[50:51] grave where is thy Victory The Sting of
[50:54] death is sin and the strength of sin is
[50:57] the law but thanks be to God and I say
[51:00] that this morning thanks be to God which
[51:03] giveth us the victory through our Lord
[51:06] Jesus Christ therefore my beloved
[51:09] Brethren be you steadfast unmovable
[51:12] always abounding in the work of the Lord
[51:15] for as much as you know that your labor
[51:17] is not in vain in the Lord Heavenly
[51:21] Father we just ask you Lord each and
[51:23] every one those not here today Father uh
[51:26] those of circumstances father
[51:28] surrounding we ask you Lord to meet each
[51:31] and every one in their place father and
[51:33] speak to Hearts touch lives give Liberty
[51:37] father give peace and joy and happiness
[51:40] replace the anxieties and fears Lord
[51:43] with a comfort and a trust in your word
[51:46] Lord we believe in your word and we
[51:48] stand on your word today and ask you
[51:50] Lord now to come just reveal in US Lord
[51:53] a greater portion of you father we thank
[51:56] you for this opportunity today in the
[51:58] name of Jesus Christ amen you may be
[52:02] seated
[52:04] amen as we look at this scripture you
[52:06] know as you study that you you look and
[52:09] you realize just how pertinent it is to
[52:12] the day that we live in for the very
[52:15] Gospel of Jesus Christ is a mystery to
[52:17] many but my brother and sisters it says
[52:20] that you know we're not going to all
[52:22] sleep but uh shall be changed and we'll
[52:25] look at that and real realize that um
[52:28] the scripture saying that those that
[52:30] have passed on to the other side shall
[52:32] not hinder those of us that are still
[52:34] here in the midst of the battle and
[52:37] we'll look at this and as you read this
[52:39] we'll look and you know we start to
[52:41] realize you know oh my I haven't I'm not
[52:44] attaining I'm in the B midst of a battle
[52:46] I've made mistakes this last day week
[52:49] month year whatever it might be and and
[52:52] you know I just wonder about this but
[52:54] you know the word is so faithful and
[52:56] true God is not speaking to our present
[52:59] circumstance God is speaking to his word
[53:02] he's speaking the word to the word and
[53:05] if the word is in us then he's obviously
[53:07] speaking to us and my brother and sister
[53:09] we'll look at this and realize that in
[53:12] in the natural uh we would look at that
[53:15] and say well you know when one passes
[53:17] from this life uh and he was a Believer
[53:20] he is swallowed up in Victory but you
[53:22] know as we'll look a little deeper in
[53:24] the word of God we'll realize that death
[53:27] sometimes in the relevance of the
[53:28] scripture is our natural death to our s
[53:33] and it's there as we would just die to
[53:35] ourselves we would allow the word of God
[53:38] to live and it is there that Satan would
[53:41] desire to keep us in a spiritual grave
[53:44] here today but uh we have been called
[53:47] from that grave and and so death where
[53:49] is I sting oh grave where is thy Victory
[53:54] and we see my brother and sister that
[53:56] we've been given the victory from our
[53:58] Lord Jesus Christ and that is something
[54:01] that we should never let pass from our
[54:04] thinking NE never let it pass from our
[54:06] Consciousness that we have been given
[54:09] the victory through our Lord Jesus
[54:11] Christ I don't care how bad your day is
[54:14] I don't care what the troubles they are
[54:16] whether it's family whether it's work
[54:18] whether it's finances or whatever it
[54:20] might be none of that matters because
[54:23] Christ Jesus has given you the victory
[54:26] and as we stand here today the Paradox
[54:29] of having that Victory is is pretty
[54:32] strong I I believe you're you're very
[54:34] similar I know each and every one of you
[54:36] that uh we have our days that we feel
[54:39] like that we have failed the Lord we
[54:40] have failed our own testimony but we'll
[54:44] find that as we go through the service
[54:46] today that God is using that not to to
[54:51] uh have us come to a place that we waver
[54:54] of who I am and what I am and what I was
[54:57] called for but to realize that you and
[54:59] the flesh are enity to God that's simple
[55:04] we will face our our our challenges of
[55:07] life and realize that this flesh is
[55:10] literally an enemy of God and so it's
[55:14] there that God wants you and I to to be
[55:16] able to look beyond that and realize
[55:20] that it's the promise of the word that
[55:22] we have been given victory in not this
[55:25] flesh not coming to to be a as it were
[55:28] superch Christian but we're standing
[55:30] here today submitted to the word and the
[55:33] word is promised to take us through so
[55:35] if we can catch a real Revelation a real
[55:39] understanding of this scripture the
[55:41] mystery of it amen what it's bringing
[55:43] forth here is a vision of our future
[55:47] it's not talking about yesterday or or
[55:49] days gone by but it it's telling us what
[55:52] our future will be as Sons and Daughters
[55:55] of God and so if our future is according
[55:59] to this word here this mystery then my
[56:02] brother and sister we have our Victory
[56:04] today we're not looking for a victory
[56:06] somewhere down through the years some
[56:09] later time in our life maybe when we get
[56:11] older and it will be simpler but I'm
[56:14] here to tell you I'm getting older and
[56:15] it doesn't get any simpler amen battles
[56:18] are battles struggle is struggle and our
[56:21] challenges just change from one kind of
[56:23] a challenge to another kind of a
[56:25] challenge and so it's there that we must
[56:28] realize today that we have been called
[56:31] to have Victory today don't look for
[56:34] victory this evening or Victory tomorrow
[56:36] claim your Victory today because this is
[56:39] what God has declared to you and I and
[56:42] if you are willing to give Victory off
[56:44] till another day I just throw a little
[56:47] history out there in World War II there
[56:49] was a time in a place the soldiers were
[56:52] weary and they were there and and the
[56:54] generals decided that they were not
[56:56] going to press the battle any further
[56:59] that day and what they didn't know is
[57:01] they had come so close to defeating the
[57:04] enemy at that point it was just there
[57:07] that it was at the breaking point and
[57:09] the generals looked at their own men and
[57:11] said we're going to give them a break
[57:13] and what the break ended up being is the
[57:15] enemy over the night brought in more and
[57:17] more reinforcements over the night the
[57:20] enemy come and reinforce their position
[57:23] and in the morning the battle was much
[57:25] greater than it had been in the evening
[57:28] time and I say today press the battle
[57:31] don't sit and say Lord I'm looking to
[57:33] have Deliverance I'm looking to have
[57:35] something better tomorrow amen press the
[57:39] battle today because God has promised
[57:42] you Victory amen and it's there that we
[57:46] have to trust the Lord to know that
[57:48] remember the word says he will not try
[57:50] you greater than you can endure so you
[57:55] need to stand on the word today I need
[57:57] to stand on the word today and claim our
[58:01] Victory today now it's not just a
[58:03] partial victory that God's trying to
[58:05] give to you and I but he's given us a
[58:08] victory over everything you notice the
[58:10] scripture doesn't give an exclusion the
[58:12] scripture doesn't say well I'll give you
[58:14] victory over everything but your temper
[58:16] or I give you a victory over everything
[58:19] but your procrastination Lord help Paul
[58:21] on that one amen but it's there he's
[58:24] given us a victory over
[58:26] everything now you know sometimes my
[58:29] brother and sister as I already
[58:30] mentioned sometimes anything less than a
[58:33] full commitment is insufficient amen but
[58:37] here the words encouraging us to give a
[58:39] full commitment because our labor is not
[58:42] in vain have you ever have you ever had
[58:46] something that you labored to do a and
[58:49] you you couldn't complete it you
[58:51] couldn't finish it you couldn't do the
[58:54] scripture tells us that if you're going
[58:55] to build build a house count the cost
[58:58] first so that you don't get it partially
[59:00] completed and abandon it and there it is
[59:03] in our spiritual Walk we're building a
[59:05] house amen let's not come to a place
[59:08] that we just languish in in that uh that
[59:11] knowing that one of these days I'm going
[59:13] to be able to step back in and I'll
[59:16] finish this what'll happen is you'll
[59:17] have a lot of negligence that you'll
[59:20] have to repair before you'll actually be
[59:22] able to move forward make progress once
[59:25] again so as you're in the battle as
[59:27] you're there and God is helping you
[59:29] leading you guiding you amen trust him
[59:32] to give you the strength and the
[59:34] resource to finish the battle that
[59:36] you're in Amen in other words no
[59:39] compromise with the devil to come along
[59:41] and we'll overcome that later he wants
[59:44] you to overcome it now so make a full
[59:46] commitment that your labor would not be
[59:49] in vain now imagine that we today would
[59:52] sit here in the house of God how you
[59:55] would feel if if brother Paul just
[59:57] started preaching about being a partial
[1:00:00] Overcomer that let's just go ahead and
[1:00:02] and let's just leave a certain portion
[1:00:05] of our flesh our problems let's just
[1:00:07] leave them alone and and let's just take
[1:00:10] what we want uh you know we made it to
[1:00:12] church today that ought to satisfy the
[1:00:14] preacher you know we're just partial
[1:00:17] Overcomers you you would as
[1:00:20] Believers of the message of the hour you
[1:00:23] would say what's going on with Paul
[1:00:25] something's wrong long here that he's
[1:00:27] not telling us to press to the mark of
[1:00:29] the high calling just press to the mark
[1:00:31] that you feel like you can do you
[1:00:33] wouldn't like that you wouldn't accept
[1:00:35] that amen so let's not view ourselves
[1:00:38] today as partial Overcomers amen we are
[1:00:43] Overcomers in Jesus Christ amen amen so
[1:00:47] we look at this and realize that we can
[1:00:50] have a mental
[1:00:52] Paradox have any of you ever had a
[1:00:54] mental paradox
[1:00:58] yeah we as humans are such incredibly
[1:01:03] complex and mysterious
[1:01:05] people on one day we can be so
[1:01:09] confident and maybe before that 2 24
[1:01:12] hours is up we are mentally
[1:01:17] staggering unable to stand and say I I I
[1:01:21] believe that I'm a Believer I believe
[1:01:23] that I've called of God I believe I'm
[1:01:25] the Bride of of Jesus Christ because we
[1:01:27] come and face battles that we say I
[1:01:30] wasn't prepared for but it might not be
[1:01:33] that we weren't prepared for it it might
[1:01:35] be that we did not approach the battle
[1:01:38] correctly in fact uh without having so
[1:01:41] much time today several loose ends you
[1:01:44] might say of this but my brother and
[1:01:45] sister brother brandham shows us so
[1:01:47] clearly that every time we start to try
[1:01:50] to battle this battle in the flesh with
[1:01:53] our flesh we will find ourselves
[1:01:57] defeated we are not called to fight
[1:02:00] Satan with our flesh we were called to
[1:02:04] fight him with the word and so if we
[1:02:07] don't approach the battle correctly then
[1:02:10] we act
[1:02:11] shocked when we don't win the battle
[1:02:14] when we find ourselves uh uh buffeted
[1:02:16] and and beaten as it were and bloodied
[1:02:19] and we wonder why I I'm a Christian I
[1:02:21] wonder why this is and there's the
[1:02:24] mental Paradox is because we weren't
[1:02:26] called to battle it on our ability of
[1:02:29] what we know or what we can do but we
[1:02:31] were called to battle the battle by the
[1:02:34] word and when we take the word and place
[1:02:36] it before us as our banner and March
[1:02:39] into the battle with the banner of the
[1:02:41] word before us we find ourselves
[1:02:44] Victorious but the human element are
[1:02:46] there any humans here today I just went
[1:02:49] on a little deal that you know I was
[1:02:52] shocked I was entering a deal about some
[1:02:55] uh stuff concerning in the farm and a
[1:02:57] little box and I'm sure you all know
[1:02:58] what it is it pops up there and it wants
[1:03:00] to know if I'm a human or a
[1:03:04] bot and then it had all of these weird
[1:03:06] little things there and I'm looking at
[1:03:08] them going I don't have a clue which one
[1:03:09] of these I'm supposed they all look the
[1:03:11] same to me so take the mouse eeny meeny
[1:03:15] miny mo eeny meeny miny yeah
[1:03:18] anyway I just clicked on it and it said
[1:03:21] oh you're
[1:03:22] human okay how did it know maybe it was
[1:03:26] a hesitation I don't know but you know
[1:03:29] you look at that and and we come to the
[1:03:31] place my brother and sister that you
[1:03:33] don't have to you know show show that
[1:03:36] you're a bot or a human uh we are humans
[1:03:39] and we Face things as humans we think
[1:03:42] like humans we react like humans and we
[1:03:45] approach God like
[1:03:47] humans and we got to come and approach
[1:03:50] God from the context of what the prophet
[1:03:52] showed us that you're no longer just a
[1:03:55] human now if you take this at the
[1:03:57] surface you're going to be confused but
[1:03:59] we're not approaching this like a human
[1:04:01] my brother and sister we're not just
[1:04:03] humans we're Sons and Daughters of God
[1:04:05] and that's how we need to approach the
[1:04:07] word of God we need to approach the
[1:04:09] challenge of Life the battles that we
[1:04:11] Face the questions that need answers we
[1:04:13] need to face them and approach them as
[1:04:16] Sons and Daughters of God not as just
[1:04:19] some human but if we're living in the
[1:04:21] flesh Walking In the Flesh serving God
[1:04:24] In the Flesh
[1:04:26] and not in the word we are going to
[1:04:29] react In the Flesh that's why the
[1:04:32] prophet of God says we should pray over
[1:04:35] everything we should ask God's wisdom
[1:04:37] even in the simplest things of our life
[1:04:40] everything according to scripture says
[1:04:42] it should be Lord willing oh I say if we
[1:04:46] could come to the place in our life that
[1:04:48] we put the word to that high of place in
[1:04:51] our life that we would approach the word
[1:04:54] and say Lord willing and Lord thy will
[1:04:57] be done we would find a lot less
[1:04:59] questions a lot less things we have to
[1:05:01] back up on to to find the answer or to
[1:05:05] repair amen so we look at this see the
[1:05:08] flesh seems to be such a part of us the
[1:05:11] real truth is we are the
[1:05:16] word now I don't want to be too direct
[1:05:18] this morning but I want to tell you we
[1:05:21] got to quit reacting in the flesh and
[1:05:26] start reacting of who we really are and
[1:05:29] that is the word and when we do that
[1:05:32] we'll find it's a challenge trust me
[1:05:36] it's a challenge there's nothing easy
[1:05:39] about this
[1:05:43] amen but when we do
[1:05:46] this we'll find that everything else but
[1:05:49] the word gets left
[1:05:53] behind now my brother and sister this
[1:05:55] this might seem like a crazy analogy to
[1:05:58] you quite a few years ago now actually
[1:06:01] been a few
[1:06:02] decades some man had the brilliant idea
[1:06:06] down in California in the
[1:06:08] CTO to go mine what had been mined in
[1:06:12] the great Gold
[1:06:14] Rush now times had changed here's huge
[1:06:18] mounds of dirt out there and all of this
[1:06:21] landscape been
[1:06:23] rearranged and this man looked at that
[1:06:25] it's been that way for so long there's
[1:06:27] Big Trees growed up and everything and
[1:06:30] he looked at that soil and he thought
[1:06:32] times have
[1:06:33] changed there's there's what he called
[1:06:36] life that was what life was gold was his
[1:06:40] life he said there's got to be life in
[1:06:43] this he went out there and he bought up
[1:06:46] very quietly all kinds of mineral rights
[1:06:49] took modern-day equipment out there and
[1:06:52] started mining that and my brother and
[1:06:55] sister you talk about a modern
[1:06:59] motherload of all the gold and all the
[1:07:02] silver that had been passed over in days
[1:07:05] gone by now you say brother Paul where
[1:07:08] are you going here I tell
[1:07:11] you we have the greatest revelation of
[1:07:14] the word greater than ages gone by and
[1:07:18] we are sitting here today and it's time
[1:07:20] for us not to just sit back and say
[1:07:22] that's been preached or that's been this
[1:07:24] and that's been that and and even the
[1:07:27] Apostle Paul dealt with this and and
[1:07:29] they did this my brother and sister what
[1:07:31] God wants you and I to do is go back
[1:07:34] into the word because that's where life
[1:07:36] is at we don't want to stop and say h
[1:07:39] you know oh we're going to just go here
[1:07:42] otherwise let's go back and just be
[1:07:44] Lutheran let's just be methodists let's
[1:07:46] it's all been mined it's all been done
[1:07:49] it's all been revealed it's all been
[1:07:51] brought forth but that's not the case my
[1:07:53] brother and sister it's the word of God
[1:07:56] and regardless of who's touched it and
[1:07:58] preached it and tried to live it in the
[1:08:00] past this is the last and final age and
[1:08:03] the season has changed and the word has
[1:08:06] come for you and I to go back and mine
[1:08:08] the word of God again go back and mine
[1:08:11] our own lives again to see who we
[1:08:13] actually are and to see what God's
[1:08:16] blessings are for us and my brother and
[1:08:18] sister just to close out that little
[1:08:20] story they went back and and of course
[1:08:22] he had bought up a huge chunk of these
[1:08:25] mineral rights my brother and sister it
[1:08:27] turns out obviously gold and silver was
[1:08:30] worth way more money in in this time
[1:08:33] than then but there was Millions upon
[1:08:35] millions of dollars of gold and silver
[1:08:38] that they mined out of the what was
[1:08:40] throwed to the side years ago don't let
[1:08:44] someone throw the word to the side and
[1:08:47] then we ignore the word because that was
[1:08:50] there it was put there like that no my
[1:08:53] brother and sister God wants you and I
[1:08:54] to go back through through the word he
[1:08:56] wants us to find in the word our Victory
[1:09:00] today not looking for some new idea of
[1:09:02] our own but just to go back and dig
[1:09:05] through the resource of the word to come
[1:09:08] amen the just shall live by faith should
[1:09:10] actually mean more to you and I than it
[1:09:13] did to
[1:09:21] them now Apostle Paul we hold him
[1:09:24] foundational do we we not word of God
[1:09:27] says if anything was preached that he
[1:09:29] didn't preach let it be
[1:09:32] cursed so Paul is very pivotal pivotal
[1:09:36] in the word Romans 714-
[1:09:39] 2 for we know that the law is
[1:09:43] spiritual but I am
[1:09:46] carnal can anyone say Amen to
[1:09:50] that but I am carnal sold under sin for
[1:09:54] that which I do I allow not for what I
[1:09:57] would that I do not but what I hate that
[1:10:01] do I am I talking on familiar ground
[1:10:04] here if then I do that which I would not
[1:10:07] I consent unto the law that it is good
[1:10:10] now then it is no more I that do it but
[1:10:14] sin that dwelleth in me now let's just
[1:10:17] stop there for a minute my brother and
[1:10:19] sister if we are speaking from Paul's
[1:10:23] personal account not just just words not
[1:10:26] just
[1:10:27] preaching Paul is actually declaring
[1:10:30] from his mouth from his voice that he's
[1:10:34] coming to a place that he has a paradox
[1:10:36] in his life that that that I would not I
[1:10:41] do you know that means Paul's just like
[1:10:44] you and I
[1:10:46] yeah we don't like to admit that we're
[1:10:48] Believers we have the word of the hour
[1:10:50] we don't make mistakes we don't have
[1:10:52] fusses we don't this we don't that no
[1:10:54] the Apostle Paul's tell tell you the
[1:10:55] things that I would not I do them and
[1:10:59] the things that I should do I don't do
[1:11:01] them so where is this Paradox do it mean
[1:11:05] Paul was backslid when he wrote these
[1:11:06] words no he's facing the battle just
[1:11:10] like you and I face it he's facing the
[1:11:13] same kind of troubles the same kind of
[1:11:16] spirits the same kind of of demons that
[1:11:20] is assaulting him and he's telling you
[1:11:23] this is the human reaction
[1:11:29] I'm sure a lot of people thought Paul
[1:11:31] must have missed the boss on
[1:11:34] this but he goes on to say for I know
[1:11:37] that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth
[1:11:40] no good thing if there's no good thing
[1:11:43] in me then I should just quit serving
[1:11:44] God right no because God's not redeeming
[1:11:49] flesh God has redeemed Sons and
[1:11:52] Daughters of God which is a spirit man
[1:11:55] for I know that in me that is in my
[1:11:58] flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will
[1:12:00] is present with me but how to perform
[1:12:03] that which is good I find not for the
[1:12:06] good that I would I do not but the evil
[1:12:09] which I would not that I do now I do
[1:12:12] that I would not it is no more I that do
[1:12:15] it but sin that dwelleth in me I find
[1:12:18] then a law that when I do good evil is
[1:12:21] present with me for I Delight in the law
[1:12:24] of God after the external
[1:12:28] man no the inward
[1:12:31] man amen that's what brings us to the
[1:12:34] place that Paul is now going to declare
[1:12:37] and did through this scripture declare
[1:12:40] to you emphatically I Paul an apostle of
[1:12:44] Jesus Christ declare unto you he wasn't
[1:12:48] in the flesh any longer he was dwelling
[1:12:51] in the spirit realm of revelation of who
[1:12:54] he was in Jesus Christ and he's trying
[1:12:57] to pull you and I into that same
[1:13:00] position not to live and not think and
[1:13:03] to dwell in the flesh but come over here
[1:13:05] into the realm that we are as Sons and
[1:13:08] Daughters of God we have our place in
[1:13:11] the word we have what describes us how
[1:13:14] we were placed before the foundation of
[1:13:16] the world we have that but as long as
[1:13:18] we're still lingering in the
[1:13:20] Battleground the Borderland of the flesh
[1:13:23] coming into the spirit Satan's going to
[1:13:25] going to Buffet us you say brother Paul
[1:13:27] how do we get away from that well the
[1:13:30] only way we'll get away from that is to
[1:13:31] get into the word and when we get into
[1:13:34] the word my brother and sister we find
[1:13:35] Victory can someone agree with me this
[1:13:37] morning the more time we spend in the
[1:13:40] word the greater victory that we stand
[1:13:43] on today we get up in the morning and
[1:13:45] it's not a dismal uh uh thing it's not a
[1:13:48] discouraging thing because we're bent in
[1:13:51] the word and the word lingers as the
[1:13:53] Holy Spirit lingers with us the word
[1:13:56] lingers with us when we've been immersed
[1:13:58] in the word it just stays as a sweet
[1:14:01] odor of presence it stays there with us
[1:14:03] and you say I'm just having such an up
[1:14:06] and down battle I'm not judging you this
[1:14:08] morning I'm not speaking hard on you
[1:14:10] this morning but I want to ask you how
[1:14:13] much time are you in the word that will
[1:14:16] Define the up and down oscillation of
[1:14:18] your life the less that you are in the
[1:14:21] word the greater the oscillation of your
[1:14:24] life the highs and the lows but when you
[1:14:26] get in the word you will find that the
[1:14:28] word becomes your balance it becomes
[1:14:30] your
[1:14:32] stabilizer my brother and sister it's
[1:14:34] not the size of the ship you realize you
[1:14:37] can look this up if you would like
[1:14:40] cruise ships everybody's like they're so
[1:14:42] huge and that that makes them so stable
[1:14:44] my brother and sister a huge ship is no
[1:14:47] more stable than a smaller ship but they
[1:14:50] have stabilizers
[1:14:55] and you need a
[1:14:56] stabilizer on the sea of
[1:14:59] life you need to have that they have
[1:15:02] those great stabilizers that when
[1:15:04] they're cruising they put those out and
[1:15:07] then it creates a balance in the ship
[1:15:10] that it's not rocking how about you and
[1:15:12] I coming to the place in the word that
[1:15:14] we put a stabilizer out in our life put
[1:15:17] something out there that causes the
[1:15:19] oscillation of our life the up and down
[1:15:21] to be uh balanced and stabilized that
[1:15:24] we're no longer
[1:15:29] tossed H you guys are quiet this morning
[1:15:33] am I preaching too
[1:15:34] hard
[1:15:38] okay you see what we
[1:15:40] need is to come to a place the fruition
[1:15:44] of this
[1:15:45] scripture now if I would do that I would
[1:15:47] not as no more I that do it but sin that
[1:15:49] dwelleth in me if I find then a law that
[1:15:52] when I would do good evil is present
[1:15:54] with me and then here is a shift between
[1:15:57] verse 21 and verse 22 for I Delight in
[1:16:01] the law of God after the inward man see
[1:16:04] how it's talking about when I do this
[1:16:07] sin is present with me when I'm in this
[1:16:09] position this is the trouble but all of
[1:16:11] a sudden he comes and he's turning this
[1:16:14] for you and I to see that it's not I'm
[1:16:16] delighting in my sin I'm not delighting
[1:16:19] in my unbelief I'm not delighting in my
[1:16:21] circumstance I Delight in the inward man
[1:16:24] I'm delighting in the word that is in me
[1:16:28] not in me as a human not in me as my
[1:16:31] intrinsic value I'm delighting in the
[1:16:33] word that is in me but I see another law
[1:16:36] in my members Waring against the law of
[1:16:39] my mind and bringing me into captivity
[1:16:41] to the law of sin which is in my members
[1:16:44] my brother and sister known fact I
[1:16:47] believe you'll acknowledge it today the
[1:16:50] more you think about something the more
[1:16:53] inclined you are to do
[1:16:59] it now I don't do this I've embraced
[1:17:03] brother Ivan's
[1:17:05] Doctrine and uh everything I drive has
[1:17:10] had a dent in it
[1:17:12] before but you go down to a car
[1:17:16] dealer I've done this before because I
[1:17:19] was thinking about doing something and
[1:17:25] price of vehicles had declined
[1:17:27] considerably this is back a few years
[1:17:29] and I was thinking I wanted to buy a uh
[1:17:33] uh diesel pickup and I went to a
[1:17:37] dealer and uh what the dealer offered me
[1:17:42] was basically borderline on
[1:17:45] ridiculous here's a pickup this many
[1:17:47] miles this what it's worth you need to
[1:17:50] buy it today
[1:17:55] and sister Jerry and I had already made
[1:17:56] a commitment to each other we were not
[1:17:58] buying anything that day
[1:18:02] period that
[1:18:04] salesman just kept me going
[1:18:07] around and around this
[1:18:10] pickup talking about how wonderful it'd
[1:18:15] be to drive this
[1:18:17] pickup new tires new brakes perfect
[1:18:22] paint look how comfortable these leather
[1:18:25] seats would be everything about this
[1:18:27] truck is what you
[1:18:29] need and you know every time I walked
[1:18:33] around that pickup my resolve lowered
[1:18:36] and
[1:18:38] not and he kept me they know what
[1:18:41] they're doing if you've ever been
[1:18:43] cornered by one and walked out of there
[1:18:45] with the keys to something you had
[1:18:47] resolved not to own you'll know how good
[1:18:50] they are at their job and he just kept
[1:18:52] going around there and telling me and
[1:18:54] finally I just had to look at him I said
[1:18:56] sir you're pretty good at your job and
[1:18:58] he said yeah if it wasn't for the
[1:18:59] downturn in economy I wouldn't be
[1:19:02] desperate right now I made
[1:19:04] $250,000 last year selling cars and I
[1:19:07] made 50,000 in this whole year and this
[1:19:10] was in December he said I'm
[1:19:12] starving and that's why you are going to
[1:19:15] buy this pickup from
[1:19:17] me and it was at that point I looked him
[1:19:19] in the face and said but I made a
[1:19:21] commitment with my wife we weren't
[1:19:22] buying a pickup today so nice to meet
[1:19:25] you sir Christian denominational
[1:19:26] Christian man God bless you and I hope
[1:19:28] that you actually can in the next two
[1:19:30] weeks sell $100,000 worth of cars but my
[1:19:35] faith isn't real listed on lifted up on
[1:19:37] that you know the minute we got in our
[1:19:40] car and drove away that atmosphere that
[1:19:43] Spirit yeah
[1:19:45] amen I don't need to spend 50 Grand on a
[1:19:50] pickup yeah no more we talk about it
[1:19:55] that's the closer we're drawn to it now
[1:19:58] what manner of
[1:20:00] conversation now something the Lord's
[1:20:01] laid on my heart I don't want to go too
[1:20:03] far into it probably be speaking
[1:20:05] somewhat on this maybe in early services
[1:20:07] in South Africa but on the road to emus
[1:20:10] which is actually a type of the Journey
[1:20:12] of Our Lives my brother and sister when
[1:20:15] Jesus comes out and meets those men on
[1:20:17] the road to emus what does he say to
[1:20:20] them what what are you talking about
[1:20:24] what man of
[1:20:26] conversation are you in and are
[1:20:31] sad you know they had the option to have
[1:20:34] said you know what Jesus Christ come he
[1:20:36] spoke the word to us it's a Living Word
[1:20:39] we don't understand it but it'll come to
[1:20:41] pass because Jesus said it but my
[1:20:43] brother and sister they're there we
[1:20:45] thought it would be this and we thought
[1:20:46] it would be that we thought serving God
[1:20:48] would be easy we thought that when God
[1:20:50] would answer all of our prayers we
[1:20:53] thought God would do this and do this
[1:20:54] and do this and and it's just a
[1:20:57] bummer and we wonder why we're
[1:21:01] sad we wonder why we are sitting here
[1:21:04] today in the back of our minds with I
[1:21:07] don't know what to do about this I don't
[1:21:08] know what to do about this and I
[1:21:10] disagree with my wife or husband on this
[1:21:12] and and we have this problem we have
[1:21:14] that problem wonder why you're sad and
[1:21:16] we've got a word of God I hope you don't
[1:21:18] think I'm too blunt today we've got a
[1:21:20] word of God that's telling us today that
[1:21:23] we should look into to this mystery that
[1:21:26] says that we're not going to all pass
[1:21:28] we're going to some go right oh I'm just
[1:21:31] caught up here excuse me amen we're not
[1:21:35] going to be caught my brother and sister
[1:21:36] all going to a grave amen some are going
[1:21:39] to be alive and remain at the coming of
[1:21:41] the Lord and we should be looking at
[1:21:43] that instead of all these other things
[1:21:45] that leave us sad we're not looking at
[1:21:47] the things of the word that make us
[1:21:49] happy we're looking at the things of the
[1:21:51] flesh that are making us sad the things
[1:21:53] of this world that are finding us when
[1:21:55] the word of God is right there to loose
[1:21:58] us amen hopefully I'm not too too
[1:22:02] overbearing this
[1:22:04] morning but in verse 23 I see another me
[1:22:07] another law on my members Waring against
[1:22:10] the law of my
[1:22:12] mind now look at this the law of your
[1:22:15] mind you as Sons and Daughters of
[1:22:18] God your mind has been anointed by
[1:22:21] God to think about life life and Liberty
[1:22:27] to think about those things of the Holy
[1:22:31] Ghost right now you know I put it out to
[1:22:33] you if I was to approach each one of you
[1:22:36] directly we should be able to name way
[1:22:39] more than one or two of the things that
[1:22:41] God has done for us it shouldn't be what
[1:22:44] our problem
[1:22:46] is it shouldn't be that there you know
[1:22:49] can we handle this Saints Lord Jesus
[1:22:51] come down in our journey to emus and
[1:22:54] says you know what you guys are fools
[1:22:56] and slow of heart can you handle that if
[1:22:59] if if brother Paul come out well maybe
[1:23:01] he
[1:23:03] is and said you're fools and slow of
[1:23:07] heart slow to believe the
[1:23:10] word come on let's not be those people
[1:23:12] Saints don't don't view it as Paul
[1:23:15] sitting here standing here in in the in
[1:23:17] the pulpit and you're in the Pew I'm
[1:23:19] with you out there God help us to not be
[1:23:22] slow of heart and let all this other
[1:23:24] things come in of we thought he was here
[1:23:27] to deliver us we thought he was to
[1:23:29] conquer the Romans we thought it was
[1:23:31] this we thought it was that why don't we
[1:23:33] just take God at his word and let the
[1:23:36] word be what lifts us up and what guides
[1:23:39] us what gives us Direction what gives us
[1:23:44] Liberty amen verse 24 oh Wretched Man
[1:23:48] that I am who shall deliver me from the
[1:23:51] body of this death well we know who's
[1:23:53] going to deliver us I thank God through
[1:23:55] Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the
[1:23:57] mind I myself serve the law of God but
[1:24:00] with the flesh the law of sin and I
[1:24:02] believe every one of us would have to
[1:24:03] say Amen to that today that that's where
[1:24:07] we're at but that isn't where we're
[1:24:09] going to stay amen we already have the
[1:24:11] word here says that isn't where you're
[1:24:14] going to stay you're going to come to
[1:24:15] the place perfect in God's eyes being
[1:24:18] lifted up drawn up into Glory not going
[1:24:21] to be captured and dead in this flesh
[1:24:23] dead in sin and trespass dead in that
[1:24:26] realm my brother and sister but we've
[1:24:27] been given the law of Liberty amen now
[1:24:31] I'll tell you the Apostle Paul's gospel
[1:24:35] is not a gospel for the faint of
[1:24:38] heart it's not a gospel for people that
[1:24:40] are looking for something easy
[1:24:46] convenient it's so interesting how that
[1:24:49] we as humans approach things
[1:24:51] we some of you say I don't do that
[1:24:54] but I think we can apply this to 100% of
[1:24:58] humanity if there's a shortcut we'll
[1:25:01] take
[1:25:05] it
[1:25:07] yeah if there's a shortcut there we'll
[1:25:09] take
[1:25:13] it but Paul's gospel is not a gospel of
[1:25:17] shortcuts Paul's gospel is a gospel that
[1:25:21] is for
[1:25:22] warriors it is for people that will
[1:25:24] settle for nothing less than complete
[1:25:27] Victory and you don't have complete
[1:25:30] Victory by taking
[1:25:32] shortcuts amen you don't have complete
[1:25:34] Victory knowing that the only way you
[1:25:37] got Victory is because there was some
[1:25:39] secret Avenue for you to get there that
[1:25:42] you didn't have to face all of the
[1:25:44] battle my brother and sister I'm telling
[1:25:46] you the struggle is
[1:25:47] real Can someone say Amen to that but I
[1:25:51] want to also make this statement the
[1:25:53] victory is is real can we say Amen to
[1:25:56] that with Vigor amen the victory is real
[1:26:00] so why Focus or or just totally
[1:26:03] completely focus on the struggle when we
[1:26:06] are here and able to focus on the
[1:26:09] spiritual the Eternal the victory that
[1:26:12] the word has promised to us as Believers
[1:26:15] in this day let that be our Focus you
[1:26:18] know when you are more than a conqueror
[1:26:20] you don't need a
[1:26:22] shortcut amen God already given you
[1:26:25] everything to face every battle amen the
[1:26:27] goliaths of our life amen you know what
[1:26:30] happens we go and and we go to special
[1:26:33] meetings we're coming up on this youth
[1:26:34] banquet we go there and there's a
[1:26:36] certain anointing there's a certain
[1:26:38] something there people get excited about
[1:26:41] that they're like oh praise God we'll do
[1:26:43] this I spoke this on my very last
[1:26:45] service at the at the uh Newport youth
[1:26:48] uh uh basically two times a two Services
[1:26:51] uh two years ago my brother and sister
[1:26:54] sooner or later you're going to face
[1:26:56] your
[1:26:58] Goliath you want to face him prepared or
[1:27:01] unprepared you want to face him thinking
[1:27:03] God's going to give you a shortcut or
[1:27:06] God's going to give you the right stones
[1:27:08] to
[1:27:09] throw amen there comes a time that we as
[1:27:12] Believers should be
[1:27:14] stone-throwers amen not the way that it
[1:27:17] usually is
[1:27:19] represented but you see we can't sit
[1:27:22] there what would what bothered David
[1:27:25] they put Saul's armor on him and and he
[1:27:28] stood there and he knew now some people
[1:27:31] have it because Saul was such a big guy
[1:27:33] and David was this little Ruddy guy that
[1:27:36] David knew that that armor was not for
[1:27:39] him because it was just too big he's
[1:27:40] dragging it around but the reality of it
[1:27:43] was the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:27:45] moved upon David to know that was not
[1:27:49] how I'm going to defeat Goliath is not
[1:27:52] by wearing someone else's
[1:27:54] Revelation I'm going to go out here and
[1:27:57] be led of the Holy Ghost and he followed
[1:27:59] that leadership he was led of the Holy
[1:28:02] Ghost he went out there with the very
[1:28:04] Simplicity what did he
[1:28:06] have the word amen he didn't have a
[1:28:11] theology he had a word those five little
[1:28:15] Stones God revealed that's all he
[1:28:20] needed Jesus Christ and faith and that
[1:28:23] was all he he needed to go take the
[1:28:25] battle my brother and sister we're going
[1:28:27] to face our Goliath we might as well be
[1:28:30] prepared not prepared with man's idea
[1:28:33] putting on an armor of I know more
[1:28:35] quotes than you do putting on the armor
[1:28:38] of no more scriptures than you do my
[1:28:40] brother and sister those were not a
[1:28:42] prerequisite for David to defeat Goliath
[1:28:46] amen it influenced him it helped him get
[1:28:48] in his right position to know where he
[1:28:50] stood but that wasn't the answer and I
[1:28:52] want to say this again this gospel is
[1:28:55] for
[1:28:56] warriors amen and if we're going to be
[1:28:59] wimps about it sorry sorry to put it
[1:29:01] that
[1:29:02] strong if we're going to be wimps amen
[1:29:05] then you're going to
[1:29:06] settle for less than complete
[1:29:10] Victory but if you come and say I was
[1:29:13] called by God before the foundation of
[1:29:15] the world to stand here as a warrior for
[1:29:19] this gospel and there is no shortcut the
[1:29:23] word will provide in me everything I
[1:29:26] need to face every battle I must face
[1:29:29] and I believe that Lord and I confess
[1:29:31] that and my brother and sister you will
[1:29:33] find yourself not pleased not happy not
[1:29:36] satisfied not settling for anything less
[1:29:39] than a complete
[1:29:44] Victory
[1:29:47] my let's remember we focus on the
[1:29:50] spiritual that's
[1:29:52] Eternal and the battle
[1:29:54] of the flesh is
[1:29:58] temporal now let me just go into Victory
[1:30:01] Day
[1:30:02] here
[1:30:11] amen now I want to read from the book of
[1:30:13] Revelation of Jesus Christ 15th chapter
[1:30:16] I want to read a portion the first four
[1:30:18] verses of the 15th chapter of the Book
[1:30:20] of Revelation and I saw another sign in
[1:30:22] heaven a great marvelous seven angels
[1:30:25] having seven last plagues for in them is
[1:30:28] filled up with the wrath of God and I
[1:30:30] saw it as where a sea of glass mingled
[1:30:32] with fire and them that had gotten the
[1:30:35] victory over the
[1:30:38] Beast see multifaceted here this is not
[1:30:42] just oh praise God I believe the message
[1:30:44] I got saved I got baptized no it's
[1:30:46] multifaceted there's when you have a
[1:30:49] victory there's another Victory before
[1:30:51] you you have a victory there there's
[1:30:53] another Victory before you don't
[1:30:55] approach this hey I got baptized I
[1:30:57] believe this the word of God but my
[1:30:59] life's been a disaster ever since my
[1:31:01] brother and sister you're approaching it
[1:31:02] wrong and then you approach it wrong
[1:31:04] you'll get the wrong result and then
[1:31:07] you'll live a half Victorious if there's
[1:31:09] such thing you'll live this modeled
[1:31:12] thing of what the message is and what it
[1:31:14] is and then you raise your children in
[1:31:16] that same atmosphere and then your
[1:31:18] children raise their children in the
[1:31:20] same atmosphere and Satan sits back and
[1:31:22] says it worked
[1:31:25] as long as they were just satisfied to
[1:31:27] be there our daughters long hair
[1:31:30] dressing correctly our sons real men oh
[1:31:34] that's just fine we've got it that's
[1:31:36] what the message done for me that's not
[1:31:38] what the message was about it's not a
[1:31:40] dress code it's a life it's a
[1:31:44] relationship and when we get our
[1:31:46] children and we ourselves get in that
[1:31:48] relationship my brother and sister the
[1:31:50] word says nothing will stand before us
[1:31:54] that's where we want our children to be
[1:31:56] at not
[1:31:58] conformers we want them to be victorious
[1:32:01] in a relationship with Jesus
[1:32:05] Christ
[1:32:09] amen where was I I saw another sign
[1:32:11] Heaven great and marvelous seven angels
[1:32:13] having seven last plagues were in them
[1:32:15] filled up with the wrath of God and I
[1:32:17] saw it was a sea of glass mingled with
[1:32:19] fire and then that had gotten the
[1:32:20] victory over the Beast and over his
[1:32:24] image and over his Mark and over the
[1:32:28] number of his name and stood on the sea
[1:32:31] of glass having harps of God and they
[1:32:35] sang the song of Moses a servant of God
[1:32:38] and the song of the Lamb sing great and
[1:32:40] marvelous are thy Works Lord God
[1:32:42] Almighty just and true are thy ways Thou
[1:32:46] King of saints who shall not fear thee
[1:32:48] Oh Lord and glorify thy name for thou
[1:32:51] only Are Holy and All Nations shall come
[1:32:55] and worship before thee for thy
[1:32:57] judgments are made manifest and if the
[1:33:00] Lord will I would like to take a text
[1:33:02] from that these are back to the
[1:33:04] prophet's words to call it vday or
[1:33:06] Victory Day as we symbolize that a
[1:33:09] complete Victory amen let's have a vday
[1:33:13] church let's not have a partial Victory
[1:33:16] you know we don't we don't do this any
[1:33:19] longer we don't do this any longer let's
[1:33:21] get a complete Victory which going to
[1:33:23] require a complete commitment on our
[1:33:26] part amen we have to press into that
[1:33:29] these people that are in the chapter
[1:33:31] that we just read had just gotten the
[1:33:32] victory I think that the word Victory is
[1:33:35] a great word in the English language it
[1:33:37] means that you have you have defeated
[1:33:40] the enemy and you've overcome and you're
[1:33:43] a Victor holding
[1:33:46] Victory oh my my brother and sister not
[1:33:49] holding a partial Victory amen I I'm not
[1:33:52] going to preach on it here today it' be
[1:33:55] a distraction but my brother and sister
[1:33:57] a complete
[1:33:59] realization versus a partial
[1:34:02] realization a complete Victory compared
[1:34:05] to a partial Victory amen there's no
[1:34:09] place for us to
[1:34:10] stop I remember one time reading a book
[1:34:13] of history and this was a man's opinion
[1:34:16] this was after tracing his family
[1:34:18] ancestry I thought it was kind of funny
[1:34:19] maybe you will he said yeah you know all
[1:34:23] those people that that stayed in
[1:34:24] Colorado Nebraska and Kansas didn't have
[1:34:28] the courage to go to
[1:34:31] Oregon he didn't see it as they stopped
[1:34:33] because it was a good place he saw that
[1:34:35] they stopped short it it wasn't called
[1:34:37] and this went on to his deal there his
[1:34:39] his revision of History you might say he
[1:34:42] said they didn't call it the Nebraska
[1:34:45] Trail they didn't call it the Kansas
[1:34:48] Trail it was the Oregon Trail and they
[1:34:52] stopped short of the goal because they
[1:34:54] decided this journey was too long too
[1:34:57] hard too laborious my brother and sister
[1:35:00] I thought it was funny his family now
[1:35:02] you know owned a huge chunk of the state
[1:35:04] of Oregon because we didn't stop on the
[1:35:08] Oregon Trail in
[1:35:11] Kansas we stopped on the Oregon Trail in
[1:35:14] Oregon and I I just thought it was a
[1:35:16] funny way to put it but I think it's
[1:35:18] representative this morning we are not
[1:35:21] the bride of Christ stopping short of
[1:35:23] the Sea of Crystal amen we're not
[1:35:26] stopping here just to say oh my my
[1:35:28] lifelong Church experience has been
[1:35:31] glorious we're not stopping till we're
[1:35:34] standing on the sea of Crystal Before
[1:35:36] the Throne of God in the presence of God
[1:35:39] worshiping God
[1:35:40] Almighty amen nothing short of that is
[1:35:43] going to satisfy the real believer and I
[1:35:46] hope that isn't too cutting my brother
[1:35:47] and sister but if you set your sight too
[1:35:49] low I'm asking you this morning as your
[1:35:52] brother in Jesus Christ live lift your
[1:35:54] vision up amen our vision is to be
[1:35:58] Before the Throne of almighty God
[1:36:01] nowhere else are we going to be
[1:36:02] satisfied as a real believer till we are
[1:36:06] standing there in the presence of
[1:36:08] almighty God
[1:36:12] Amen you are a Victor holding Victory
[1:36:16] and we sing songs and cheer in a victory
[1:36:19] and here we find that there was
[1:36:21] something these people had come to this
[1:36:22] sea of glass mingled with fire and they
[1:36:25] had gotten the victory over the Beast
[1:36:27] over his image over the mark and the
[1:36:30] letter of his name all these things they
[1:36:33] had gotten the victory over them and
[1:36:35] were Victor standing on the other side
[1:36:38] on the sea of glass mingled with fire
[1:36:41] singing the songs of praise to almighty
[1:36:43] God and that's why I believe with all my
[1:36:46] heart amen that we as a song service
[1:36:48] today just need to sing from our heart
[1:36:51] amen this is our practice ground to
[1:36:54] stand before God on the sea of Crystal
[1:36:57] and to praise His name and sing songs of
[1:37:00] praise let's not be half-hearted singers
[1:37:03] we're not going to go there to learn how
[1:37:05] to sing this is where God wants you and
[1:37:07] I to learn how to give praise through
[1:37:09] song this is where God wants you and I
[1:37:11] to learn how to lift our hands amen
[1:37:14] learn how to really truly Praise Him
[1:37:16] from our hearts I'm not being too hard
[1:37:19] am I amen
[1:37:21] hallelujah but you see we got to have a
[1:37:23] a vision of that Victory before we'll
[1:37:25] ever have the victory
[1:37:28] amen I think that's something we ought
[1:37:30] to praise the Lord for to have the
[1:37:32] vision even just the vision of the
[1:37:34] victory should be something to praise
[1:37:36] him but to have the victory itself the
[1:37:38] Fulfillment of the spoken word in your
[1:37:40] life over us that ought to be something
[1:37:43] that just ought to boil over in our life
[1:37:45] that we just say I just can't hold
[1:37:47] myself
[1:37:48] amen you see it takes every part or
[1:37:51] component of the word to truly have
[1:37:53] victory Victory this is why we can't
[1:37:55] come along here and say well I believe
[1:37:57] the message but I disagree with the
[1:37:59] prophet on this
[1:38:02] really my brother and sister that's
[1:38:04] becoming much more prevalent the prophet
[1:38:06] himself
[1:38:07] says that they won't
[1:38:10] deny those things they don't believe it
[1:38:13] but they won't deny
[1:38:16] it for appearance sake
[1:38:24] I won't go too far into it
[1:38:28] but not that far in the
[1:38:33] past come
[1:38:35] across people that say they believe the
[1:38:39] message and argue with the
[1:38:42] pastor over the quotes believing the
[1:38:46] quote is
[1:38:51] wrong are we conceptional
[1:38:55] Believers in principle we
[1:38:59] believe no my brother and sister we were
[1:39:01] called to be
[1:39:03] Believers
[1:39:05] amen we're called to be
[1:39:07] Believers a little story from a ship
[1:39:10] that sank many years
[1:39:11] ago this man was actually being a
[1:39:14] gentleman willing to sacrifice his
[1:39:17] life and he stepped aside he was a
[1:39:20] wealthy man he stepped aside from
[1:39:22] getting in a Lifeboat the people on the
[1:39:24] ship are telling him sir you're
[1:39:26] important get in the Lifeboat he stepped
[1:39:28] aside and said ma'am bring your children
[1:39:31] bring all of this here uh come get in
[1:39:34] the boat and and he stepped aside and
[1:39:37] they kept telling him a steward kept
[1:39:38] telling him sir the ship is sinking
[1:39:40] you're going to lose your life but my
[1:39:42] brother and sister an arrogant man with
[1:39:45] self-importance come and as the boat was
[1:39:47] settling in the water and going he
[1:39:50] brought his whole family and pushed them
[1:39:52] into the boat and and they released the
[1:39:54] boat and it went out and the boat was so
[1:39:57] overloaded that water slopped in and
[1:39:59] every person that that went into that
[1:40:02] Lifeboat
[1:40:04] drowned and the man is still on this
[1:40:06] ship that is sinking settling and he
[1:40:08] thought to
[1:40:09] himself my what have I done to
[1:40:12] them but then realization hit
[1:40:16] him I didn't take their
[1:40:20] life someone who didn't value their life
[1:40:24] took their
[1:40:26] life and he stood at the rail until the
[1:40:30] sea overwhelmed him and his
[1:40:34] family and people criticized that and
[1:40:36] said well if he cared about his family
[1:40:39] he would have got in that
[1:40:42] Lifeboat but you see he actually cared
[1:40:45] about others more than he cared about
[1:40:47] his own
[1:40:48] family and
[1:40:50] ironically as the vorte of the ship
[1:40:53] going down in the water
[1:40:54] swirling it swept his wife and two of
[1:40:58] his
[1:40:59] children to an empty Lifeboat
[1:41:04] floating in the end his family was saved
[1:41:09] all but his youngest child because his
[1:41:12] youngest child was unable to
[1:41:14] swim but you see my brother and sister
[1:41:17] this gospel is not to shove you out of
[1:41:20] the way so that they can to put them
[1:41:23] come out of the way so that you can this
[1:41:26] gospel is here to give Victory to each
[1:41:30] and every one of us if we're willing to
[1:41:34] receive it if we're willing to take a
[1:41:36] hold of it
[1:41:39] amen and we come to this place we're
[1:41:42] called to praise
[1:41:44] him can I have just another minute or
[1:41:48] two amen let's go right over here I'll
[1:41:55] as I said a minute ago here it takes
[1:41:57] every component of the word for us to
[1:41:59] have
[1:42:00] Victory brother Brown speaks of this
[1:42:02] give you a little Head Start might might
[1:42:04] be something we preach on a little
[1:42:06] deeper here perfect
[1:42:09] realization contrasted with partial
[1:42:12] realization my brother and sister we
[1:42:14] want perfect
[1:42:16] realization we don't want to just be
[1:42:18] able to sit here today and I hope this
[1:42:20] doesn't offend anybody we're not called
[1:42:22] to sit here today and say God sent a
[1:42:23] prophet and that's as deep as our
[1:42:25] revelation of this word goes God did not
[1:42:28] send a prophet so we could say God sent
[1:42:30] a prophet that should be a stated fact
[1:42:33] that needs no reinforcement God said
[1:42:36] I'll send you Elijah the prophet and we
[1:42:38] don't have to dig up scriptures and
[1:42:40] quotations and this and that to defend
[1:42:43] God's sending a prophet that was God's
[1:42:45] word we should just believe it amen amen
[1:42:49] now in the message hear you himm
[1:42:54] when God gets ready to do something he
[1:42:56] always has a witness of it I'm so glad
[1:42:58] today that we can look around before the
[1:43:00] coming of the Lord and see the witnesses
[1:43:03] of his appearing seeing the signs in the
[1:43:06] Church of the near approaching of the
[1:43:08] Lord Jesus Christ seeing it word by word
[1:43:11] fulfilled Can someone say Amen to that
[1:43:13] we're not looking for some super sign
[1:43:15] out here we're not looking for some that
[1:43:17] we hang our hat on we're looking for the
[1:43:19] word of God coming in our life changing
[1:43:22] you and I bringing us into favor with
[1:43:25] our Lord Jesus Christ building faith in
[1:43:27] us giving us a a a spirit and a vision
[1:43:31] of Victory amen not to sit back and say
[1:43:34] well what it is my brother and sister
[1:43:36] it's amazing that the world today
[1:43:38] interprets the scripture that the
[1:43:40] Believers are going to go through
[1:43:42] Armageddon well I'm sorry my brother and
[1:43:45] sister but the prophet of God come in
[1:43:46] very simple terms and brought it down
[1:43:48] and said no Joseph's wife was in the
[1:43:52] house
[1:43:54] and the world's like no no no we're
[1:43:56] serving God today but we're going to
[1:43:58] prove that we really love him
[1:44:02] later really no wonder the church is
[1:44:05] loose because they don't even view right
[1:44:07] now as a time to prove where they stand
[1:44:09] but you see by the word of God we stand
[1:44:11] here today and now is our time to prove
[1:44:16] I know this is a little crash a little
[1:44:18] blunt a little
[1:44:19] straightforward but I like how a
[1:44:21] minister put it
[1:44:23] he said no man in his right mind would
[1:44:26] marry a girl who is
[1:44:29] Unfaithful expecting her to prove she's
[1:44:32] faithful after she's
[1:44:35] married is that a little straightforward
[1:44:38] yeah a little
[1:44:39] straightforward amen but the time you
[1:44:42] prove your faithful is now not after the
[1:44:45] marriage he okay sorry about that if it
[1:44:49] was a bit
[1:44:51] much see the sign and near approaching
[1:44:54] seeing it word by word fulfilled even
[1:44:56] the last sign that was to be given to
[1:44:58] the church before the appearing of the
[1:45:00] Lord Jesus it's working in the
[1:45:03] church can we say that St all right here
[1:45:06] I I'll just let me cover this up here so
[1:45:09] we don't have to have too high
[1:45:12] expectations he's proving it right
[1:45:17] now not
[1:45:19] later
[1:45:21] now the last saying remember he said as
[1:45:24] it was in the days of Sodom so shall it
[1:45:26] be at the coming of the son of man look
[1:45:27] what the Sinners was doing in Sodom look
[1:45:30] what the angel the Lord did when he come
[1:45:32] down to Bear record of it watch what the
[1:45:34] Three Angels did all three of them look
[1:45:36] at the world today in its sin look at
[1:45:39] the church today in its condition like
[1:45:42] lot look at the called out Church having
[1:45:44] a struggle like Abraham was the man or
[1:45:48] the woman today that tries to live for
[1:45:52] God
[1:45:54] let me stop don't read no
[1:45:56] more any of you guys
[1:45:59] struggles ever wonder why you have
[1:46:02] struggles it's right here here's an
[1:46:04] answer the man or the woman today that
[1:46:07] tries to live for God has a struggle to
[1:46:09] keep on going you have to press into the

[1:47:57] easy but you'll do it and you'll
[1:48:01] overcome and you'll have a testimony
[1:48:04] that you can stand Before the Throne on

[1:48:20] you live
[1:48:21] in that's incredible my brother and
[1:48:23] sister it's going to be
[1:48:26] incredible remember the story of the
[1:48:28] Roman soldiers in the Dark
[1:48:31] Ages I don't mean to be crash but it's
[1:48:33] just the reality of the story they were
[1:48:36] forcing these Christians men women
[1:48:39] children to take all their clothes off
[1:48:42] they're standing on the ice they made
[1:48:44] them take their clothes off and they
[1:48:46] drove them to the center of the
[1:48:48] lake and they're out there hypothermia
[1:48:51] setting in falling one by
[1:48:55] one but not
[1:48:57] recanting their belief in Jesus
[1:49:00] Christ and that Roman soldier he looked
[1:49:03] and something stirred so deep within his
[1:49:07] heart for
[1:49:08] anyone to go through that this has to be
[1:49:14] true and he went and he started taking
[1:49:17] off all of his coats and his armor cloak
[1:49:20] and all of these things and they said
[1:49:21] what is wrong
[1:49:23] and he told them I
[1:49:26] believe then his comrades had no problem
[1:49:29] driving him out on the ice that he could
[1:49:34] suffer with them so that he could
[1:49:38] reign with them let that be our
