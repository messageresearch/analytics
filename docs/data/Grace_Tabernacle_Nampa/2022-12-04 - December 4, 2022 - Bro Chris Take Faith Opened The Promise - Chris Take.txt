much amen it's good to be here this morning in the house of God good to be gathered to hear what God has to say amen you know the young class this morning I wanted to apologize to you guys I came down a little bit frustrated and I'm sorry about that um so I apologize for that um uh next weekend I'll be gone in Washington preaching for Brother John Andes I have a couple of services as well as a youth service so your prayers are coveted we drive out uh probably Thursday and come back Monday so there'll be no young adults class next week next Sunday um and I meant to tell well it came up my heart and Brother David asked what requests they were but I didn't say it and it came back on my heart again so um when we pray over the word this morning I just want to remember brother Adrian Stefan and Kalispell Montana um their work that they're trying to do up there that God would just lead them and guide them and give them the inspiration and the wisdom that they need to to do that amen thank you musicians it was beautiful today I enjoyed that song sir very much um it's uh the opener to the sermon and um I'll I'll uh I'll tell on myself for a minute here for the class this morning um I had no no notes I had nothing and so I asked the class and they didn't know that I said give me a subject and sister Alice I asked what we did last week and then I said give me a subject and she said faith and I just just talked about faith and and all that and we just unpacked that and the whole time I was like now what was I preaching this morning I couldn't remember my sermon this morning and so we talked about faith and we went over faith and how it's the key and never learned Revelation and then I sat down in the office and I opened my iPad and I was like oh yeah my title this morning is Faith open to the promise and I promise you when we taught class I did not remember that so even even myself as the minister can teach class and not understanding because the class almost every Sunday we have class the preacher preaches well we talked about in class so God did it again even though I'm one of the same so praise the Lord also glad most of you made it here safely um so why don't we stand this morning and we'll just uh open our Bibles up to Genesis chapter 16. and I have the whole chapter to read I don't know if we'll read the whole thing while we stand but um because we also have another another chapter in Genesis but Genesis chapter 16. really enjoyed Wednesday night the good teaching around white Throne judgment really enjoyed that amen why don't we why don't we just pray now while we're standing Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Lord you know it's been a bit chaos this morning and father even for myself and my family almost all week long God but from the very beginning within my heart I knew there was a purpose this morning Lord the devil only gets riled up when he knows he's about to get whooped down Lord but father God we know that even even in that it's only because you allow the chaos father so this morning we pray we would just fall right into your perfect hand of Grace Lord fall into your hand of Mercy Lord Jesus that you would use this father you love a broken and a contrite spirit you love a soft heart and sometimes you use the things of this world to bring us to a position where we're just ready to sit and have peace and ready to sit and listen and God may you just thank you for preparing the ground this morning I pray you'd minister to our hearts Lord Jesus father as we begin to look Lord into the scriptures this morning into the message I pray God that's something special within us we begin to open up Lord a part of us we never saw before Lord would be recognized and identified in your word Lord Jesus we love you Lord we thank you we just want to remember brother Adrian Stefan and his family up there in Kalispell Montana Lord continue to be their portion their inspiration their Direction this morning and throughout the days Lord we love you father we thank you for all you've done may you bless your word now in Jesus name we pray amen amen Genesis chapter 16 and we're going to start in verse 1. now Sarah Abraham Abram's wife bear him no children and she had and handmade an Egyptian whose name was Hagar and Sarah I said unto Abram behold now the Lord hath restrained me from bearing I pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that I may obtain children by her and Abram hearkens to the voice of Sarah and Sarah we may read it later on but the previous chapter is when God begins to work on Abram and give him his his his uh inspiration and his promise of a son God called Abram out and um when God called Abram out of jail he didn't say hey come out and I'm going to give you a son he just said come out that's right and Abram had faith and he walked out then God gave him this promise but directly after God gives him the promise what happens the Devil comes down to try to deter him from that promise so verse 3 and Sarah Abram's wife took Hagar who made the Egyptian after Abram had dwelled ten years in the land of Canaan so it's been 10 years since he departed and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife and he went in on sahagar and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her Mitch mistress was despised in her eyes so it was both sides of the fence here were causing this this dissension this this uh separation between this argument this tension between Hagar and Sarah it wasn't just Sarah I was both but why was this why was this tension caused why was this problem caused through unbelief amen that's why unbelief is sin exactly because the reason you have problems reason you have conflict in your life is because you allowed something to come in to break that Faith to cause that fear of the promise that God's given you in it whenever that comes in there this is what it causes but a righteous man steps or ordered of the Lord so you watch and you see how how how uh well let me read so you can be seated and Sarah I said unto Abraham by wrong be upon thee I have given my mate into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived I was despised In Her Eyes the Lord judged between me and thee but Abrams Abram said unto Sarah I Behold thy mate is in thy hand to do to her as it pleases thee and when Sarah dealt hardly with her she fled from her face let's pray or we already prayed may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word he'd be seated this morning we'll pick back up an inch verse seven here but what I was saying a minute ago is that what happened was uh unbelief came in and unbelief caused a problem and that but a righteous man's steps or ordered of the Lord so you'll watch and and if you go and you read the story of Ishmael you'll see that God actually protects Ishmael from Annihilation there was two times where an Ishmael should have passed away the first time in the womb the second time as a young boy but neither of them happened God protected because God was going to use Ishmael God is using Ishmael to form in Isaac to form an Abraham a stronghold of faith we would not be we would not have character unless we had conflict conflict and and these things bring us into a position where then now we have Victory there is no victory until there is conflict you cannot say oh I won the war unless first there was war right so the same thing happens so my title this morning is Faith open to the promise and my subtitle is not born a Slave you know I began to think about that that song and and uh you know I love that song no we are no longer slaves to fear and and we in our in our in in this world you know we were at one point slaves to sin and we no longer are slaves but if you really look deep within you you never were a Slave you were not born a Slave though the world said you were though the world though you were a slave to the desires of sin for a season you were not born a Slave so Genesis 16 here so verse 7 and the angel of the Lord found her so he finds Hagar by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way of sure you know God likes to do a lot of things by a well all through the scriptures there's been pivotal moments where God has done something by a well and that's just uh there's many things I'm sure we could take from that but God is our Everlasting well he ours Eternal well and from him Springs forward life so um he finds Hagar by the Fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way of sure and he said Hagar Sarah Sarah is made whence cometh came as thou and wither wilt thou go and she said I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai and the angel of the Lord said unto her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands and the angels of the Lord said unto her I will multiply thy seed exceedingly that it shall be numbered for multitude so he's giving her the same promise that he gave Abraham I will multiply that seed see the the the people can say oh you know well I'm gonna I people can say that that oh the blessings of God are on our church and we're just you know we're 400 500 800 strong not necessarily message churches but just churches in general well God just gave the same promise to the serpent seed that's right and the angel of the Lord said unto her behold thou art with child but do you know why he has that promise she gave him that promise because that's part of that seed came from Abraham that's right though he was not ishmael's was not the elect seed the seed still came from Abraham there were certain promises in God's word I want you to think about this and chew on this as we as we go this morning there's promises given in God words that God's word that even unelect can tap into and reap the blessings from there there I've heard stories uh this particular one was from Brother Jewel I think it was of of a bar owner who understood giving and tithing would bless his business and so he died then he gave of his offering and and uh or he or maybe he wasn't a borrow owner but he was he was an unbelievable unbelieving Heathen but he understood those two things and he gave and his business was blessed so just because I had a I had a conversation with a young man some time ago and and he he kind of asked the same thing well you know they the denomination uh they have these these Miracles and these things and these blessings well right here this that's where it is you can they can tap into that but that's where Today We Live that the we want to see what's the life being brought forth not what are the blessings not what are the Miracles but what's the life being brought forth amen so um verse 9 and uh Angel of the Lord said unto her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands and the okay excuse me I'm in verse 11 and the answer the Lord said be unto her behold thou art with child and shalt bear a son and shall call his name Ishmael because the Lord hath heard thy affliction and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren and she called the name of the Lord that speak unto her thou God the thou God seized me for she said have I have I also here looked after him that seeth me wherefore the well was called behold it is between kadish and Beret and Hagar bear Abram a son and Abram called his son's name which Hagar bear Ishmael and Abram was 86 years old when Hagar bear Ishmael to Abram Genesis chapter 21. verse 1. and the Lord visited Sarah notice the name change as he had said and the Lord said did unto Sarah as he had spoken for Sarah conceived and bear Abraham no longer Abram a son in his own age at the set time of which God had spoken to him and Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom Sarah said to excuse me was born unto him whom Sarah bear to him Isaac and Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old as God had commanded him and Abraham wasn't 100 years old when his son Isaac was born unto him and Sarah said God hath made me to laugh so that all that here will laugh with me and she said who would have said unto Abraham that Sarah should have given children suck for I have borne him a son in his old age and the child grew and was wean and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned and Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian now okay so here comes the promised son is is brought forth and we begin to see now the conflict conflict between Sarai and Hagar was resolved and now now we begin to see the conflict arise from those two seeds and Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian whom she had borne unto Abraham mocking mocking at him making fun of him oh we all go to church come on just come with come do this with me what's the big deal no I don't we can go to the same church we both go to Grace Tabernacle but I don't do those kind of things oh what are you come on I've had that happen message people laughing at me because I'm following and I don't say that in any kind of way like look at me but there's something in your life you just you can't deny it I wanted to I wanted to just go off with something always held me back and so it's the same thing so here we have Israel and uh Isaac and Ishmael wherefore she said unto Abraham cast out this bondsman and her son for the son of this Bond woman shall not be Heir with my son even with Isaac and the thing was very Grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son Abraham loved Ishmael he was his son we love the flesh you all prettied it up this morning you brought it to church but we are called every day to cast it out we are called every day to separate it to push it aside look this is Sarah the bride saying get rid of this this bonds woman get rid of this situation and God said unto Abraham let not be Grievous in thy sights now God comes and said Abraham what she's saying is is true let it not be Grievous in that side because of the land and because of thy Bond woman and all that Sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in Isaac shall thy seed be called and also of the son of the Bond woman will I make a nation because he is thy seed see right there and Abraham rose up early in the morning so God kept his promise even though Ishmael was not his elected seed what is our title this morning Faith opened the promise amen and Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread in a bottle of water and gave it unto Hagar putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba and the water was spent in the bottle and she cast the child under one of the shrubs and she went and sat her her down over against him a good way off as it were a bow shot for she said let me not see the death of the child and she sat over against him and lift up her voice and wept so 50 yards or so away with her back turned to him and God heard the voice of the lad and the angel of God Called to Hagar out of heaven and said unto her what alith thee Hagar fear not for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is our eyes lift up the lad and hold him in thine hand for I will make him a great nation and God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water another well and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink the latter rain right they all drink of the same water they all drink of the same rain but and they have the same thing Ishmael grew to be a stronger man Isaac grew to be a strong young man Isaac brought fourth seed Ishmael brought forth seed but what is the difference it's the life within them amen one was born of a bonds woman and one was born of a free woman and God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water okay and God was with the lad and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and became an Archer and he dwelt in the wilderness of Quran and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt now bear with me I just we just hit something in that verse and I want to check us something real quick here I guess Revelations yeah so the first seal there's a white horse rider that goes out and he has the bow so Ishmael here has a boat he's an Archer so people say oh that white horse rider with the bow you know that was Christ that was the Antichrist it was the impersonation so even Ishmael now an impersonation of the truth but there's something down inside Ishmael that doesn't identify with the word of God because he is a son of the bondsman who is your father you could have titled it that this we could have tiled this this morning that who is your father I don't care I don't care what you look like I don't care what you can do I Don't Care What miracles you can do I don't care what scriptures you can speak of who is your father I want to know who your father is that's why the Jews had such a stronghold on genealogies and who their father was why is it there why do you read there's some some scriptures in the chapter where it's it's 52 verses of genealogy God's testifying it matters who your father is the mothers were rarely ever mentioned in what they were there was a purpose you know with with uh the harlots in there in the genealogies there's a purpose for that but it was always the father why because that's what matters that's what matters that's the true seed of God so in this in the case of Abraham they both had the same father but where was that seed placed where was that seed put so with with it in the when you had Ishmael brought forth you had Abram and hagorn before the name change before the body changed before the Holy Spirit it was the right seed in the wrong womb in the wrong time so God bringing forth God God is bringing forth a bride out of the church so now then you had Sarah and Abraham so it was the right seed in the right room brought forth the promised son that's why the Bible says you know a seed was planted but it grew fast and it died and I thought I used to think well it was the seed what what's the problem well it's this right seed in the wrong right so the seed can be planted the seed was planted the seed from Abraham he was the father the correct father but it was planted in the wrong womb so the word of God has come forth the word of God Is Spoken but that's the Paradox of a Christian is that it doesn't matter and I was talking to the class this morning it's hard to to it's not hard to well it's hard to say in the human element and many people can get upset but guess what there is word for the elect amen not everybody is going to catch it I'm going to preach like everybody is seed I'm going to live my life like everybody I interact with is seed or potential to be to to come to church and begin to serve God as a seed that's how I'm going to live my life but the word says amen the word is for the elect of God why because that's how God decided it God is eternal and that's how he decided to do things so now the this morning we're talking about faith opened the promise and we have a quote here from the way of the way to have Fellowship but remember says there's only two faculties that govern a human and one of them is Faith which brings results and the other is fear which has no value in it at all faith is of god fear is of the devil fear Makes You Weary fear makes you wonder and if I was going to die in the morning what good would it do me to get all stewed up about it what if I was going to be electrocuted in the morning and my life had to end tomorrow morning what good would that do me to worry about it next quote here show us the father God doesn't have no use for a coward now brother Brown preaches they're pretty straight and taken out of context you can think well every time I had a little bit of fear or every time I was feeling like a coward well I must not be part of God that's not a context because what was Gideon doing behind he was hiding and the angel of the Lord said hello Mighty Man of Valor that's right see God sees your heart God sees your heart God doesn't have no use for a coward if you're afraid to trust him don't even make an effort until you're satisfied that he keeps his word and he keeps his promise I wonder how many would be upset if they thought those were my words until you're satisfied that he keeps his word and he keeps his promise then there's nothing going to stop you that's right but be sure you know where you're standing because you'll only make yourself worse then I noticed him I thought aren't you afraid of me there's he's talking about the eagle in the tree and he's out hunting I had my rifles sitting against the tree I said I can grab my rifle and shoot you or excuse me I think the the bird was on the ground I can't remember the story but he was close and and he just sat there and I noticed why uh so why is he not afraid and I noticed that he had his wings so he was saying that song Winds of Faith he kept feeling them seeing it the feathers was all in running order say it's yesterday morning did you feel to see if your wings are in working order did you make sure today to groom them you know a bird will groom his wings did you make sure to make sure your your wings and make sure that you make sure that you make sure your wings were set ready for flight or are they are they are they missing feathers because you haven't been taking care of them is your faith in faith weaked is the is your are your wings weak because you haven't taken proper care but though Eagle knew he began to feel his feathers and feel his wings he knew they were set they were ready you see we have a part to play we have the Winds of Faith As we sing the song the winds come God brings the wind but we've got to put the wings out we've got to spread our wings when God comes you say oh I need God to come I'm praying God to come on the scene you have you there's a promise in the word and I'm praying and I'm praying but have you set your wings are you ready for Faith to come open the promise to you are you ready for God to come until you are nothing will happen that's it but you need God you need God to get yourself into a position where you're ready to be lifted up to be lifted up away from the from this situation he feeling them see if the feathers were all in running order I thought that's it God has given him two Wings he's got confidence in him he knows that he could be in that Timber before I get my hand on that gun he's got perfect confidence in his god-given way of escape and if a eagle in God's Universe can have enough confidence in a god-given gift of his wings how much more ought we the children of God to have confidence in the Holy Spirit even though the doctor says you're going to die with cancer just as long as you can feel that power of God there let everything be a lie and God's word be truth say to God faith is the key that's it to open the promise open the promise open up Christ who is the promise it's Christ he's the promised son what happened Abraham had a name change why did Abraham have a name change because God identified his faith and when God identifies your faith he gives you a name change he get he he identifies you with who you really are Abram is not mentioned in the scripture in the in the New Testament Abram is not mentioned post-resurrection Abraham is mentioned Abram's sin of Ishmael is not mentioned necessarily post-resurrection Paul talks about the son of the Bond woman and those things but when it's when we talk about Abraham it says Abraham had faith in Hebrews chapter 11. Abraham had faith if you read Hebrews 11 and you read about all those people you say I can go in the Old Testament and I can show you their mistakes but what is the difference between Hebrews 11 and the Old Testament Resurrection happened in between Christ came Christ came and now those things that were once written are no more those things that God once remembered are no more because they were sins that had been washed away for good you see God has the same book written of you not their mistakes not your sins once forgiven once repented of your book is clean and your book reads as Hebrews 11 reads amen so in James chapter 2 verse 23 and the scripture was fulfilled with saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God if you if you go back and you excuse me I'm getting ahead of myself here praise the Lord so what happened with Abraham what happened with with Abram excuse me with the birth of Ishmael why why did this why was this brought forth why was this what caused all of this this this this these issues why did you know Abram was just given this promise in chapter 15 here we'll just read we'll read 1 through 6 15 1-6 and I apologize to the sound guys and our interpreter I didn't this came this scripture came to me right before I came up here and after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward Genesis 15 1. and Abram said Lord God what will thou give me seeing I go childless and assured of my house is This Ellie Eater of Damascus and Abram said behold to me thou Hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine Heir and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine hair but he that shall come forth out of thine own bow shall be thine air you see it wasn't really easy God identifies right here Eli Israel was not our promised son amen but the Brandon was not our promised son the message he brought forth is our promised son behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine Air verse 5 and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness this is Genesis 15. Genesis 16 is when Hagar excuse me Abram takes Hagar and brings forth Ishmael so what happened Abram knew had a promise already we already have a promise we have a promise that we are called to be Overcomers see what happened the other day when you fell what happened what happened the other day when you made a mistake you have the promise why are we not perfect we have the promise what happened was fear came in amen fear blocked the promise that's why the devil's his tool is fear fear will block the promise I want you to hold that there as a hopeless situation fear has blocked the promise but brother Brandon was in a position one time and I apologize again I didn't I got this quote because Brother David sang behind the veil this quote came to me brother random was laying in bed one day and he was he was feeling hopeless now the situation maybe is different than Abraham the situation is different than situations we have been in but the key is he was feeling a bit hopeless God promised God gave the promise it's there for you so what's getting in the way why are you not fear has blocked the promise there was a fear that brother had that he would pass be pass away and he would just be a cloud floating and he would be able to identify this other Cloud as being brother um Neville this fear so God comes along and and and this is in the rejected King and I raised up on my pillow and and as many of you have people have done it put my head upon the headboard of the bed and I don't usually like to read really long quotes but I want to read this story this morning the headboard of the bed and put my hands behind me and I was laying like there like this I haven't even have done that I've done that Lord I what's going on hopeless a moment of hopelessness and I said well I just wonder what it will be the other side I'm already 50 and I haven't done nothing yet if I could only do something to help the Lord nor would that leave us for I know I won't be mortal half of my time is gone at least or more than half if I live to be as old as my people still half my time is gone and I looked around and I was lying there fixing to get up it was about seven o'clock I said I I believe I'll go down to church this morning if I'm hoarse I'd like to hear but the Neville preach so I said are you awake honey and she was sleeping very soundly his wife now watch what he says I don't want you to miss this that's us I don't want you to miss this it has changed me amen amen I can't be the same brother Branham I was that's how important this is right here we're about to read and I looked and I heard something kept saying you're just starting press the battle just keep pressing I shook my head a minute and I thought well I probably just thinking like this you know my persons can get some imaginations and I said I just probably imagined it and it said press the battle keep going keep going I said maybe I said it I put my lips within my teeth he bit his lips and put my hand over my mouth and there it come again just keep pressing if you only knew what was at the end of the road and it seemed like I could hear Graham Snelling or somebody that sang that song like this they sing sit here anime all of you all I'm homesick and blue I want to see Jesus I would like to hear those sweet Harbor bells chime I would it would brighten my path it would vanish all fears Lord let me look past the curtain of time you've heard it saying here at the church and heard something say would you like to see just beyond the curtain and I said it would help me so much and I looked in just a moment one breath I had come into a little place that slanted I I looked back and there I was laying on the bed and I said this is a strange thing now I would not want you to repeat this this is before my church or my sheep that I'm pastoring whether it was I was in this body or out whether it was a translation it wasn't like any Vision I ever had I could talk I could look there and I could look here so you could see both places normally in a vision he was he was gone from the where his body was he was somewhere else but now he could see both places and when I hit that little place I'd never seen so many people come running screaming oh our precious brother and I looked and a young woman maybe in their early 20s 18 to 20 they were throwing their arms around me and screaming or our precious brother here come young men in the Brilliance of Young Manhood and their eyes glistening looking like stars on a darker night their teeth as white as Pearl and they were screaming and grabbing me and screaming oh our precious brother and I stopped and I looked and and I was young I looked back at my old body laying there with my hands behind my head and I said I don't understand this and these young women women throwing their arms around me now I do realize this is a mixed audience and I say this with the sweetness and with the mellowness of the spirit men cannot put your arm around women without a human sensation but it wasn't there there was no yesterday no tomorrow they didn't get tired I never seen such pretty women in all my life they had hair down to their waistline long skirts to their feet and they were just hugging me I wasn't it wasn't a hug like even my own sister sitting here there would hug me they were not kissing me and I was not kissing them it was something I have not got the vocabulary I haven't got the words to say perfection wouldn't touch it superb wouldn't even touch it nowhere it was something that I never you just have to be there you know there's a story there's stories sometimes you go oh well you just had to be there we'll never understand it we've just got to be there and it looked this way and that way and they were coming by the thousands and I said I don't understand this and here come hope that was my first wife she rung and never said my husband she said my precious brother when she hugged me there was another woman standing there that had hugged me and then hoped hug this woman and each one and I thought oh this has to be something different can't be there's something I thought oh would I ever want to go back to that old carcass again I looked around and I thought what is this and I looked real good and I said I can't understand this but hope seemed to be like a guest of honor she was no different but just like a guest of honor and I heard her voice and that spoke to me that was in the room and said this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can inter here without it what is perfect love Christ nothing can enter that place without Christ I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there was no jealousy there was no tiredness there was no death sickness could never end there amen mortality could never make you old they could not cry it was just one Joy oh my precious brother and they took me up and set me up on a great big high place and I thought I am not dreaming I'm looking back at my body laying down there on the bed he could still see his body he says I'm not dreaming in other words he's gone somewhere he stepped beyond the curtain of time [Music] and they set me up there and I said oh I shouldn't sit up here and here come women men and from both sides just in their Bloom of you screaming and one woman was standing there and she screamed oh my precious brother oh we are so happy to see you here I said I don't understand this and that voice that was speaking from above me said you know it is written in the Bible that the prophets were gathered with their people and I said I remember that in the scriptures said well this is when you will gather your people I said then they'll be real and I can feel them oh yes I said but there's Millions there's not that many branhams and the voice said they're not brenhams our name given to us is not for him our name given to us is Mrs Jesus Christ them is your converts that's the ones that you've led to the Lord and said some of them women there that you think is so beautiful were better than 90 years old when you led them to the Lord no wonder they're screaming our precious brother and they screamed all at once said if you hadn't have went we wouldn't be here and I looked around I thought well I don't get it I said oh here where is Jesus I want to see him so bad and they said now he is just a little higher right up that way he said someday he will come to you you were sent for a leader and God will come when he does he'll judge you according to what you taught them first whether they go in or not will go in according to your teaching and he's and I said oh I'm so glad did Paul does he have to stand like this does Peter have to stand like this yes I said then I preached every word that they preached I never divvied from it one side to the other were they baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I did too were they taught the baptism of the Holy Ghost I did too whatever they taught I did too and then people screamed and said we know that saints of God these are people this is not a dream this is not a vision brother Birmingham had he stood there those people saw him and he saw those people this is a place more real than what is we're looking at today and they said they testified that what he preached was what Paul preached that leaves no argument whatsoever about what the message taught because these people could not lie they could not lie they're in a place they could not lie and they testified they said we know that and we know that we're going with you someday back to Earth said Jesus will come and you'll be judged according to that word that you preached us and then if you are accepted at that time which you will be and said then you will be present present then you will present us to him as your trophies of your ministry said you will guide us to him and all together we'll go back to the Earth to live forever I said do I have to return back now the voice said yes but keep pressing on sometimes it feels that way Saints we have a good service we sit in the presence of God which is just the blessings everything do I have to walk out do I have to go back out there do I have to go face the sin and the Darkness of the world around us but God said just keep pressing on God took Abram out and he said Abram look to the Stars Abram had been journeying for 10 years without a word from the Lord and God comes and says Abram look to the Stars look to Heaven God this morning is giving you a chance saying look to heaven and keep pressing on keep pressing on how can you identify yourself with the promise through faith what casts out all unbelief faith faith can open the promise for you this morning faith can give you victory over fear Faith blocked the promise but amen Faith prevailed fear excuse me blocked the promise but Faith prevailed there is this is not the end of the story if you go and you read about kadish barnea that was not the end of the story the Israelites did eventually walk over Jordan because Faith prevailed in the scripture you'll read David Fell in adultery David Fell but Faith prevailed Abram fell and had Ishmael but Hebrews 11 says by faith Abraham Gideon was in weakness Gideon was in defeat but Hebrews 11 says faith prevailed your story is written a certain way and you remember it and you remember what you did and what you did wrong what you're doing wrong but faith has and will prevail faith has opened the promise and you were not born a Slave I looked and I could see the people just as far as I could see still coming wanting to hug me screaming our precious brother just in a voice said all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you God has given you here and I looked and here come my old dog come walking up here come my horse and laid his head upon my shoulder and nickered said all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you God has given them into your hand through your ministry not through your friendship he's passed away I was born years after he passed away but I am hearing his ministry amen which is the word that God sent to us and I felt myself move from that beautiful place and I looked around I said are you awake honey she was still asleep and I thought oh god oh help me God never let me compromise with one word let me say you write straight on that word and preach it I don't care what comes or goes or what anybody does how many Sauls sons of Kish rise how many this that or the other let me Lord press to that place so I say this with my Bible before me this morning amen so God took Abram out and he showed him the star and he said this is your promise a fear came in and fear blocked the promise but what brought the total Victory God recognized Abram's faith and gave him a name change he brought him out he gave him circumcision and he said um so directly after Ishmael chapter 17 and Abram was 90 years old and nine 99 years old and the Lord appeared to Abram said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect amen God has given us the same voice God has given us the same word excuse me the same word be thou perfect what's impossible it's impossible but what God says to do right that's a commandment so we have to be perfect well it's impossible there's no hope Abram probably thought it's impossible Lord I just failed or about Ishmael and now I got problems I got conflict perfect how am I going to be perfect see here how are we going to be perfect I know you know I know you know we'll just wait how are we going to be perfect there's fear in our lives that we I can't be perfect but God wasn't done talking you know sometimes God says something and we jump in and we interrupt if we would just be quiet and let him speak be perfect Abraham Abram excuse me and I will make my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him Abraham fell on his face why does it mention that because now Abram is a more humble man God will bring things into your life bring Ishmael and hagars into your life to bring you down to bring you humbled down to bring you on your face and so that when he speaks you fall on your face in in reverence in sincerity in humbleness and in full surrender and God lord goes on to say as for me behold my Covenant is with thee this is God's covenant nothing can break God's covenant nothing can break God's covenant he's given it to us Thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name any more be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee that's how Abraham could be perfect Abram can never be perfect Sarah I can never be perfect but Abraham and Sarah can you can never be perfect living under the conditions of a bonds woman amen God has given you the Commandment be thou perfect God has given you the Commandment forgive and it shall be forgiven you how can we do these things how can the world the world looks on it says how can you do this how can you say we must be perfect how can you have overcoming power how can you are get all this stuff the word is commanding you to do how can we do that faith and open the promise and God has given you this faith God recognizes the faith that he has given you you didn't come by that faith alone God gave Abraham that Faith because Abraham was God's elected scene that's right so God's given you the faith he gives you the very key you need to unlock everything he has for you amen that's right if you lock something up as a person you're in a deuce I don't know I can't think of an example but just it just blows my mind God gave you the thing you need to access him you didn't have to go get it no sir God gave it to you do you see how much he wants you to succeed do you see how much he how how excited he is to see you conquer this world you know why because he sees the end of the story right those Millions there amen he sees the end of the story Faith opened the promise fear blocked it but Faith opened it amen faith has opened the word to you faith is the key fear is not the end of the story praise the Lord I mentioned Cadence barnia in Numbers Chapter 13. service 30 . and Caleb Still the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we Ishmael versus Isaac and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched under the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eatest up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature it's impossible to serve God today the world will eat you up and spit you out it's impossible perfect you cannot be perfect it's impossible come as you are stay like you want yeah that's what they say but that's the voice of Ishmael that's the voice of Ishmael the voice of Isaac testifies with Caleb we are able to over comment and I said oh we saw giants the sons of anak which came of the Giants and we were in our own side as grass our own sight as grasshoppers okay for a minute here can I have the Liberty to take the Viewpoint of the Giant they just said in their own sights they were as grasshoppers they didn't ask the Giants what the Giants saw can I tell you something the Giants in your life the Giants in the world whatever you put you put the name on the Giant Goliath whatever the giant may be you say in your eyesight you're as a grasshopper do you know what the giant sees a bigger giant but he's not going to tell you that he doesn't want you to know that you're a bigger giant than he is but that's his Viewpoint the sons of anak looked upon the children of Israel they saw some grasshoppers but then they saw these two men Caleb and Joshua and they wondered why they were so much taller than the rest of them the devil looks on from his strongholds and he sees you not you but in who you are inside if the devil can identify us why can't we identify ourselves if the devil can look on and say I see a mighty man of Valor but I'm not going to tell him that I'm going to tell him he's not I'm gonna tell him he's defeated even because he's not you see the devil likes to preach the opposite whatever God's trying to tell you God's trying to tell you you are more than able to take the land God has given you a promise but the Devil comes with fear and says no no no you understand the Giants are taller and they're more sophisticated these sons of anak they have technology they can see they can understand all these things they they can break through they're they're smarter they've gone to you know they have all this stuff they figured it out um it's impossible for you to take the land so why don't you just go back in the desert because you can't do it you know what the Lord likes an Underdog Story so he sent that children of Israel back into the desert and those Devils thought we had the victory He sent Jesus into the ground and the devil says Ah we have the victory Victory but God loves to catch the Devil by surprise God loves to catch the Devil by surprise what is the best way to defeat your enemy catch him by surprise you catch him off guard you catch him by surprise so Senators will win the desert and walked but God was forming an army you know there's a scripture in the Bible where God says we're describes that God when the enemy comes in like a flood God raises up a standard do you know what the word standard in that context in that scripture means raises up an army go look it up standard means raises up an army so the enemy comes in like a flood what does God do he says Brother David here's a better sword here's the better Shield Sean go sharpen your sword your shoes are untied brother Tim take a moment your Shield's got a dent go I got an Armory we can get that fixed up for you go you're Titus your helmet it's got a crack from the last battle take it over to the army with brother Tim and get it fixed up God raises up an army you are that army that God has raised now the Devil comes in like a flood he says it's impossible for you to take the land but God says I will raise a standard you are that standard say to God this morning you are the standard you're the flag waving above the army that says we can make it you're the flag set on Bunker Hill that says we have the victory you this morning have the power of Christ in you to slay every giant of a neck every Giant in your life and you you can do it not your dad not your mom not me you amen right not all Christ is gonna fix it for me no God said I'm raising you up as a standard you will stand and you will testify it doesn't matter how dark the world is I have a people that can stand and fight the devil says well let me have my way with job God says go ahead what happened in job's life the enemy came in like a flood but God raised job up God didn't come and fix job's situation for him God raised job up right job was weak job was down his friends had tried to friends had tried to encourage and tell him he was a secret sinner and they speak and job argues and they go back and forth and there's this whole situation and then it says the joke the words of job were ended and Ellie who rose up to speak Ellie who in some context is Jehovah or something along those lines Ellie who speaks and he speaks in frustration and anger he says I was I am younger than you so I held my peace to make sure you all had a chance to speak he says but now let me speak on behalf of my God who are you job and who is God and he begins to speak and it begins to testify of the power of God job in a time of trouble Joe in a time of serious situation everything around him has fallen down and he's sitting on an ash sheep in serious trouble the enemy has come in like a flood God comes along and he says job what is it what are the words he used stand up God came along when the enemy was in a flood and he said to you the Samaria stand up he said to you stand up the situation that you are in God has given the word and says job good yourself like a man and stand up for I have something to say to you amen I don't know if he uses the word stand directly but in the context stand up what did he what did God just do God came and gave job the faith to fight against the flood of the enemy you see God gives you what you need to fight the battle that God knows you can overcome I've mentioned it through the sermon but we read the story of Abraham and Sarah and I and I mentioned Hebrews 11 but I want to read it Hebrews 11 8 by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker is gone through faith also Sarah herself receives strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past Aid because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore spraying there even of one of him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky and multitude and as a sand which is by the seashore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promise but having seen them afar off were persuaded of them and embrace them and confess that they were strangers and pilgrims on the Earth for they they that said such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is in Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God God is not ashamed to be identified with you right for he has prepared for you a city by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac that he had received the promises offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said then that in Isaac thy seed shall be called failed the second test Abraham conquered God puts Abraham through the same test again sacrifice your son but there's a difference between Abram and Abraham now watch what Abraham does he speaks the word Abram didn't speak the word to Sarah Abram didn't speak the word to Sarah he said sure I'll take Hagar Abraham said the boy and I shall go and we shall return Abraham said something God will provide a sacrifice Abraham had every intentions in his heart to strike Isaac through he he wasn't faking it you know you can fake it on the outside you can convince me but you can't fake it and convince God he sees your heart God knew Abraham's heart that's why God came and said Abraham don't kill Isaac because Abraham had every intentions of keeping God's word amen you're in a situation Isaac is on the altar before you God wants to see you keep his word jephthah mentioned in Hebrews 11. sacrificed his own daughter to keep the word what does that mean go sacrifice your kids no do not do that I will call the police on you but it means regardless of the situation keep God's word regardless of how hard it is keep God's word because when you do and when it drops into your heart when it drops into your heart and in your heart you have every intention and desire to keep God's word that's when God comes and gives you a lamb that's when God comes and gives you the victory because he wants to test your faith he loves to test your faith to identify why is he testing your faith because he said there's only one kind of people that can have this kind of faith and it's people who have me people who are identified what is the trying the trying of your faith and your Victory equals Christ in you amen Christ identified in you in closing John chapter 4. oh I guess I gave them the whole chapter but we won't need the whole chapter well you know what you go home and read John chapter 4. but in John chapter 4 we get the story of the woman at the well she was blocked by fear she had fear in her life fear was holding her bondage maybe there was a situation we don't know the back story because the backstory isn't always that important sometimes you don't need to know there is testimony but sometimes you don't need to know because God doesn't even remember it so she comes to the well at the time appointed for people like her and there's a man sitting there she thought okay another customer but this man was different God is Faith right so faith was sitting at the well if you haven't already you're going to go come to a place you're going to come to your well and Faith's going to be sitting there waiting for you see it's not up to you that's it it's not up to me God you didn't choose God God chose you it doesn't matter how dark situation doesn't matter anything you can she comes to the well and faith is sitting there waiting for her she begins to talk to Faith and Faith begins to what speak the word and faith says I have water where you'll never thirst again now watch her response man I'd love to have that I'd love to have that water how come she had the ability to do that with the Tim there was something inside of her there was something inside of her the day before if you saw her what would you think if you saw her how how would you view her would you call her a child of God would you call her sister if you had the ability to see inside of her you would that's right but we don't that person you saw yesterday maybe they're at their well today that person sitting in church this morning could be sitting at their well doesn't matter how pretty you look on the outside or how much you what you are on the outside inside your heart so she meets Faith at the well and Faith begins to tell her well you know what was what is faith revelation he begins to reveal to her who she is but he first has to address her sin there's no Victory till sin has been taken care of him first thing brother Bannon would do with the sinner well do you will you accept Christ then you would pray for them and God would heal them sin has to be taken care of so he identifies her sin he says no you've had five husbands and then what you're living with now is not your husband and she says this is true she admits fault she doesn't she admits fault and then God begins to say it begins to testify and she says you speak you speak you sound like the word amen Faith was speaking to see there was a deep calling to the Deep and there was a deep to respond faith begin to respond something in her heart was crying out do you know that was her worst day yet see how do you know that because that's how God works amen that was her worst day maybe that was the day she decided you know what I'm gonna go get my water I'm gonna go home and then I'm gonna go find somewhere to die that could have been that could have been her she could have been on her way to the well saying I'm gonna take my life today she could be on her way to the well saying you know what I give up this is it this is my life I guess I guess I'll just go on I guess I'll just live like this she gave up I have I have a sermon in my my archives titled give up the battle secret fighting she could try she quit trying to make herself better right and she just walked to the well do you realize her with her water pot walking through the streets at that time of day identified her as a prostitute everybody could see it everybody knew she walks to the well and because of who she is not who she's acting like not who you're acting like today but because of who you are Jesus of Nazareth they said but he was born in Bethlehem where were you born I'll tell you where you were born you were born in eternity actually you were all you always were and that seed inside of you is identifying this morning with faith at the well God says I will give you Everlasting water what opened the promise her faith opened the promise why because she was not born a slave that's right amen she was a child of Abraham she was a child of the free woman I don't know why I didn't think to write down that scripture where Paul talks about that but I didn't so you can find it later and read it that we are children of the free woman if the musicians want to come this morning and God has given us the ability why did I read that long quote God has given us the ability to do the same thing to look Beyond the Veil God brought him brother Branham here anointed him gave him that experience to testify to us that there is a place waiting for us a place that Place steadily replicate that P Ace but you can have that peace here today the world won't be like that but that peace can
