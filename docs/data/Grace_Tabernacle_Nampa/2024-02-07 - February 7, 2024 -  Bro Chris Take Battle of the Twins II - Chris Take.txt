Lord Give Me a Heart Like th amen that's my prayer this evening Lord Just Give Me a Heart Like thine amen amen want to share something with you before we go to prayer here this evening and listen to a the uncertain sound and this is this is nothing new to us but just a reminder sometimes you know it it I wasn't going to read read this tonight but then we we have many Alex and Alex says had Trevor cut his hair and whatever Trevor had he got so he they're both home sick this tonight and my wife and a couple of the kids are running high fevers so they're home and I don't know who else is sick but um this just struck me when I was listening to this earlier today and you know we've we've heard these things a lot of times but sometimes you know a remembrance bring it back to our memory brother brandom says in the uncertain sound he says reader Readers Digest picked it up and in America here they we got it rote out here and in reader digest where they had examined for Divine Healing and they took a brother that prayed for the sick he had a sick man and had him pray had him praying for the sick and then they put a piece of lead foil anyone knows lead foil reflects that Ray and he's talking about the X-ray or whatever there um he says lead foil reflects that Ray so they put that upon between the the man and the man that was praying for the brother on his hand and he laid it down like this and they shot the picture of X-ray and from the man's hand showed a visible reflection of a ray coming out of his hand going into the other man and he says God knows what he meant when he said they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen I love it when science proves God right all along you know people say oh you know I don't believe in healing anymore absolutely 100% 110% amen amen um prayer tonight want to remember brother Alex Trevor Kristen and Ellie were both uh running a pretty good fever there want to continue to hold the Dean Hart family up in prayer um Lord

online tonight Lord Jesus not feeling well in body May may you your presence be felt in their room Lord Jesus we ask that you just be with us may you rightly divide the word to us tonight and speak to us we ask we love you so very much Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen praise the Lord thank you and thank you for that last song I needed that confirmation amen it's good to see each one of you tonight good to be here amen if you have your Bibles and you want to stand with me we're going to turn over to Psalms 102 and um tonight I wanted to um take part two of Battle of the Twins and uh with the subtitle written for our sakes so Psalms 102 verse 16 when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in his glory he will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayer this shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord for he hath looked down from the height of his Sanctuary from Heaven did the Lord behold the Earth to hear the groaning of the prisoner to loose those that are appointed to death to to declare the name of the Lord in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem then this scripture from Romans 15 verse4 for whatsoever things were written the four time were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated tonight so I had some different thoughts kind of this way and that way and and uh I just can't get away from from this this um this channel because if you look down we have Cain and and Abel um we have Adam and the serpent we have Cain and Abel we have in heaven last time we spoke a battle of the of the twins we talked about the origin of sin and righteousness and so you brother says sin started in heaven so you had Lucifer and and and and and God Adam and the serpent Cain and Abel Abraham and lot Noah and the rest of the world Esau and Jacob Israel and Moab and so on and down through through the the scriptures down through history you have this battle of the Twins and and every day that we we live our lives we are in a battle because we have the spirit man that's been Sanctified and filled with the Holy Spirit and we have the Flesh and so I I I mentioned it maybe last time and and that we we we look at the Flesh and and many times we we talk about the Flesh and and we and we and we say hey we want to drop the Robes of Flesh and and that's our heart's desire and that is a pure desire and as long as we keep that in Balance we're good but if we start to look at it as though if I didn't have the flesh then I could if I didn't have the flesh then I wouldn't then we've gone a little bit too far and we've forgotten we've become the victim rather than the Victor right very cliche I know but if we if we keep the right balance in our minds that we need our flesh we need the opposition think about gravity right we need the pulling against gravity so we can stand upright there's got to be these forces that that come against each other think about magnets and how all of that work it's two oppos you got a opposite and a negative right those two go together husband and wife you know I was reading this thing the other day my wife sent me and um this man is a Christian he's a I don't know marriage counselor or something and he's he's basically making the point that you know compatible according to the world is way far off off of it he loves to to to hike and get outside and she can't stand leaving the house and and and back and forth It's because each side then has something to surrender to make the relationship work in harmony each side is balancing the other so you can't have the middle of the road unless you have the right ditch and the left ditch there there would be no Middle Road if there wasn't the far so you have this and and this is something that you know through history because all religions are just the perversion of the truth and this is something that even even um they have picked up on and and it's it's like I said before the flesh is chaos but the order of the spirit of God keeps the flesh controlled but it has to have opposition you need opposition in and so this in um Psalms here I just wanted to highlight this is this scripture this shall be written for the generations to come and so you know I I was thinking to to bring this scripture and to show you how how it ties in I was thinking about um you can do a lot of good thinking when you're running early morning I I took brother David's advice I brave the scary woods in the dark um great great thoughts and so I was thinking about you know the different in the scriptures how we had the principles of the Gospel right because in in in um in society we have all this stuff about be kind right and and it just doesn't come off right and and so I I thought a lot about that and put thought into that and we have the we have the fruits of the spirit right Temperance and and all of these things that's the one I only one I can remember right now for some reason um but and so God gives us principles in the scriptures and I I think I'm a little bit too analytical sometimes for my own good but why do we have stories why do we need stories in the Bible if the Bible is is the principles for us to live by why do we need stories you know this man went out and fought this battle and came back and and I saw I was I know crazy this is how my mind is going and and I and it was because God says look he says the stories of the men and women in the Bible they're for us they are the principles of the book lived out so God says here's the Ten Commandments and then he puts into the book the stories of the children of Israel and the terrible things they did and all the the Kings and and and all of the men down through history that are in the book CU there's lots of History that's not the book he puts those there to say here's the principles and this is how it looks when you live it because if we get to literal we become legalistic and if we get to loose we become liberal that's right so God says here's what it looks like you know we have we have Peter and everything that he did and and and David and what he did but God says this is what I'm talking about this is your example and then and then and so on from there so the words written are were were for us you know they they are not complete without us why because we needed them for the book to be written and then we needed the book to be reunited with Christ so it's this big loop right and the only the only way what's if you read about job what story is in is in the book you know hey job from the beginning of time God said look job's going to be in the book okay so the scribes said all right so God said okay what are we what are we going to do to get job in the book and God said hey satan what you have you been up to oh going here and hither to or here uh back and forth whatever he says and have you considered job he he puts a Target on job's back and and the story of Job for for for centuries has inspired men and women of Faith but what do we read about him him we only read his story when he faces opposition that's it once his life is back to normal there's no more about him in the book that's right this shall be written for the generation to come it was put in the book but he had to have opposition he it it was it was necessary for his development that's right you know a child they have to oppose gravity learn how to walk and they fall down and it's and it's you know I'm glad we can't remember that um and then they walk but then how do we grow we we we oppose bacteria bad bacteria we we oppose our immune system opposes sickness our our our our we you know whatever it would be we it's it's what keeps this thing moving in Harmony and if that's true in the natur natural and that is true in the spiritual the flesh is necessary for our Perfection that is why God had that's what that's because that's part of his Plan of Redemption that's why he had to let the Garden of Eden fall happen he needed his children to have an opposition to bring his plan to fruition we we are here for one purpose and that is to fight the battle to fight the battle of the twins to take the battles sorry sometimes there's notes in there and then they don't belong anymore you know this is this is a battle that we're in as I've said and we we face it every day okay and it and it's and it's completely necessary and it and we have to stop tripping up on our failures sometimes there are C in a battle sometimes there's casualties on the good gu side but that doesn't mean they lost look at how many men gave their lives on the beaches of Normandy and that was just one battle yet we beat Hitler we beat the Nazis so sometimes we get so focused on the fact that you know imagine two soldiers in in a in a Foxhole and they're fighting and this guy dies nothing he can do he's boom instantly taken out of the fight if if if I'm the soldier that survived if I go oh my goodness and I just spend the next few minutes lamenting over this man I will join him now that is not don't take that as from you to your brother right but that is you that is your that is you and yourself and and and when you there's a battle lost if you just focus on the Lost battle you're going to get hit again if you're in a fight you get hit the first thing you do is bring back up so you can see your opponent and when you're fighting this battle look it doesn't have to be you know it's just we're just human beings and we have to fight this our desires to get upset and all this kind of stuff and and when we face that we get angry we face it we keep on going we don't sit there and tear ourselves down then all we're doing is accomplish in the enemy's job for him but if we say look hey I needed that opposition I failed that time but next time I'm going to do this differently then we're on the journey to Perfection at Thy word Lord I believe the Apostle said that our trials are better than gold to us so we we are as gold tried in the fire right we we we love that we love that analogy and so there's no Gold without the the fires we there's you can't just well let's just read the quote think of that God might have let you get sick in order that you might be a testimony that he might heal you that you can stand on his word so it's your personal experiences okay so then when you when you reach the opposition you can say I know beyond any Shadow of Doubt oh my witness to me in Jerusalem Judea Samaria a witness is somebody who's really done something something been somewhere and seen something so it's necessary you say I want a testimony it's necessary for a testimony for there to be opposition that's right it's necessary that there is a battle fought because look you cannot have a battle that's right without I have it at the end of the slides we'll see it but you can't have a battle without opposition you can't have a battle without without a fight and you can't have Victory without a struggle amen and and and those victories you know character is a victory right the only way to move up in as a child of God the only way to to come higher in Christ is to face another opposition so we say oh if you're not in a trial you're in between you're coming out of one or you're going into one that's a good thing that's a good thing good men make good times good times make weak men weak men make bad times look at the world around us we're living it today why was it the Great Depression World Wars all of those and the men that came out of that were entrepreneurs were're strong we're we resilient we're you know got up and went to work anyways you know they're the they're the they're the generation that you know never missed the day of work in 25 years though they were sick this that the other now we're having a mentally tough day we get a whole week off I'm sorry it's never going going to be easy that's right it's not but if you can I think you get the point but I don't feel like you get the point so I'm going to just labor this more because if with if you can look at it and say okay I need that right why do we go lift weights what are we going to do if we could lift nothing we would just lift nothing and then have muscle but we go and we lift something we we we we we get resistance easy Brother David we get resistance right we we have to have that and as soon as it gets easy guess what you can Titus I don't know how much you can squat I don't know if you've squatted on a under a bar before but let's say you get up to 135 pounds which is two plates and you do that and that's all you do you'll be strong for 135 but unless you add more resistance you will not get stronger that's right so you see the the the the the the the uh secret ingredient to your success in your Christian Life is another opposition overcome amen another step and sometimes we we try to bring it and we say well I want to lift 450 PBS so then you know sorry I I work out so this is the analogies but you want to do deadlifts Cas to pull the bar off the ground right there's some weight on the bar Titus is like look I want to live 450 if he goes to the gym puts 450 on the bar starting right now and just tries every day to pull on that he can try and says you know I might not lift it today and try and try and try and he will never lift it because you have to be given a load you can handle that puts you right on the edge four to six reps right on the edge so it's hard it's really hard but it's not impossible as soon as you cross that threshold where it's too impossible you know what happens you get hurt and if you get hurt you're not going to lift anything cuz you're hurt so God knows exactly the right of amount of opposition to give you that is why the scripture says he will not tempt you above that which you can handle temptation is just the let's replace that word if I can have the Liberty to do so he will not give you a challenge you cannot handle that's right what a what a concept especially when you see it lived out in people like Corey tinboom and her family but God knew they could handle that and God knew they needed that because if I get Michael Michael can lift some heavy weights and I gave him my weights he'll get weak because he's a stronger man sometimes and not to say stronger in faith but sometimes the the way different people are you take you take a strong men they're strong men competitors they were actually born that way the average guy cannot just go and start competing in strong men competitions you're born that way you're you're big you're tall and your body just grows muscle you they have to have the big weights they can't have the little ones or they'll die they'll get weak and frail where if you try to tackle them you understand the analogy so God gives you what you need to take because it's the opposition that makes you stronger in your faith witnessed to me in Jerusalem okay been somewhere and seen something so you've gone there You' lived through that now you have a testimony our hope is in God if you would have lived in the days gone by when they crucified Jesus you'd say today I would have stood for him I'd have given my life for him you have more of an opportunity to do that now than you would have in them days stand now the opposition is greater today than it was then why is it Greater because we have the whole thing amen so now we're the strong men we have all of that we have we have the the all the whole package so if God said okay I'm going to give you the Temptations of age number four the fourth age you would never come to Perfection you're too strong for that you say what Martyrs dying lying yeah now it's all in the mind that's right how what's the what's the most what's some of the best torture tactics the mind that's right the devil knows because the devil anoints those people the devil knows if he can get in your mind he's got you he doesn't even have to lay a finger on your body that's right if he can if you were saying your head I'm defeated guess what you're defeated but God has given us the Perfection of his word the whole thing and he says look you're ready now it's opposition is greater day because it has to be not that it's like wow God oh my goodness the burden no it is completely and totally necessary because we are here preparing for a crossing over whether that comes through death or that that comes through the rapture we are preparing for a crossing over and we will come to that place when we are ready if a man if somebody wants to go compete in competition they have to train for that competition we cannot sit on the next to on the right hand of God in heaven as his bride until we have completed our training amen so then it's necessary for us to consume all of the nutrition we possibly can and and to take advantage of all the time that we can in the days that were given to train that's righten you see there's there's two definitions there's exercise and there's training exercise is when you just go for a walk and you know do that every day that's healthy it's good for your body that's just exercise but training is when you increase resistance over time and you have a goal you're working towards we're not here just to exercise denominations are full of people who are just exercising the good principles of the book we are here to train as Warriors of the faith we're not it's not a cliche and you know what motivation doesn't get you very far it's discipline and discipline is chastisement chastisement isn't because you're doing something wrong it's God training you it's God challenging you that's right because God has promised believer's position in Christ God has promised he would do it see and I believe him and so when opposition comes why it's not me to take care of it it's him to take care of it it's just me to go wherever he said go that's right he will take care of the opposition so now say brother Chris you've completely cont contradicted yourself because God takes care of the opposition here in lies the greatest struggle in in in fighting against the opposition that we are given we must give him complete control that's right and that's the hardest part right you have to trust the process you know many many people in the day and age we live in they have a goal they want to do something they want to climb to the top of Everest they have to trust the process if they don't trust the process surrender to the process and three months in they still can't they're still not where they want to be and they change it and they go over here and they go over here they will get nowhere they have to surrender Amen to the process amen sometimes we say hey I'm going to I'm going to do this we have a we have a train you know as Christians we have a training we're going to we we got we know what we have to do so we get up and we say we come to we come to a session of training and we say all right ah I don't know maybe this isn't working I got to change it we put our heads down we say no we just want to change it because it's hard but it's the right thing to do it's the right thing to do remember the analogy I gave o of of the man going to prayer and he brought along will his self-will you remember that I'll give it again so the other day I heard this from somebody else but the day I went to prayer and I looked at will my will and I said today is it's it's time for prayer are you ready to go and he said I am if you are says okay so we gathered the emotions and we went to prayer and the whole time I had to go get the emotions he was was off playing golf and this emotion was off plowing the field and I had to go catch this emotion cuz he was down at the gym and this emotion was over there with his nose in a fiction novel and it was a wreck and if you would asked me did I enjoy myself I would have had an answer honestly no but then it came again for time for prayer and I looked to will and I said will are you ready to go to prayer and he said I am if you are so we went to prayer dragging emotions along with us and it was a battle as ever before and if you would have asked me after the time of prayer if I had any fun or if I enjoyed it I would have had to answer honestly no but then it came time for a prayer again and I looked at will and will said I'm ready if you are and we drug emotions along and this went on for a couple of weeks and then one day I I looked to will and I said all right will it's time let's go and we went to drag emotions along again but before we could move from the room the emotions looked to one of the emotions looked to the others and said you know what he's going to take us anyways we might as well just go along so my emotions came along now they didn't really pay attention too well but it was a little bit better than the time before couple more weeks went by and I looked at will and I said will you ready to go to Prayer Will said I'm ready if you are and I went to prayer and something happened one of the Motions got a little excited and jumped up and said Hallelujah and the rest said amen and if you would asked me did I enjoy myself afterward I would have said yes I had the best prayer time of my life you see our emotions should be ruled by by us amen our emotions are always going to be there but we have to look will face to face and say are we going to do this and where do we get that strength he will take care of the opposition where do we get that strength to say I'm going to get out of bed and do what God has called me to do because he takes care of the opposition and we drag our emotions along whether they want to come or not we are in control and that only comes through discipline which is the chastisement of the the Lord because he loves you and me and he takes care of the opposition how so by training you by giving you what you need to overcome by feeding you to strengthen your faith but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him in Hebrews 12 5-11 I'm looking at this chapter this is Hebrews 12 but Hebrews 11 I'm looking at that chapter totally different now why are those men in that chapter all of them faced opposition that's why they're there that's what faith is Faith is the coming face to face with opposition and by surrendering our will our emotions to Christ we Find Faith which gives us the victory because faith is a victory and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him so chastening is training not just discipline it's training train up a child in the way he should go that does not just mean you you only talk to them and discipline them and train them when they're doing bad you encourage when they're doing good and you show them this is this is how you act and you and you talk to them you you you play offense you don't always play defense if all you do is play defense that's right you're just it's going to be it's not going to work out very well you're going to be lopsided so chastening is just training of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him see he separates the two for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth or he trth and he scourges every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening God dealth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are you bastards and not Sons so if there's no training right a neglected child receives no training so God isn't neglecting you and and this scripture comes about because I I don't want to focus on the rebuking part because sometimes we go through things and and if we're not careful the devil slips in in in his in his Sunday suit and he says uh you're doing something wrong so God's punishing you all the while God's just putting more plates on your bar making the lift harder amen and he loves you and he's just your trainer amen he's where the holy spirit is the inward teacher that's right or the trainer amen I know some people who who have you know trainers they those sometimes they hate their guts cuz they're putting more opposition to them right it's like that story for the Paul likes to share all the time about those Vietnam the platoon of Vietnam War uh soldiers they hat they couldn't stand that guy but because of the opposition he gave them they could go out in the jungle and it was easy so to speak right furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his Holiness see there's the formula right there for our Prophet for job's Prophet all hell broke loose because God said job needs this job needs to 800 lb CU that was a big trial imagine losing all of your kids and everything you own right but that's what job needed that was the opposition he needed to reach the level God wanted him to be at you know all we hear about is Enoch walked with God and he was not what kind of opposition did Enoch have to deal with to get to that position that's right why is Enoch in the book so we know for the generations to come we know and that is why they are not perfect without me and you because they are the reason for the book we are the ones who needed it and we complete the picture amen for they verely for okay now no chastening for the present seeth to be joyous of course it's terrible but science has proven over and over and over again when you do a really hard thing after after that it's better than if you before am it takes excuse me it takes immense suffering to enjoy peace that's right it takes hardship and and sweat and and and and pain to enjoy peace and then the next battle comes that's what it takes it's not joy in the moment but God but Christ who came down and endured the most endured what he endured on the cross why did he do it CU he looked and he could see and that's where people begin to find success in their training is they look and they they can suddenly the goal is before them it was always before them in in writing it was always before them in their in their plan but this time they catch a revelation of the goal and that keeps them training that keeps them getting up at 4 in the morning morning or or staying up late or or running in the rain or or or hurting in pain because they have a revelation of the goal and we as Sons and Daughters of God if we can catch what those in the book caught where they said this is what I must attain to this is when look at Paul the end of his life where were where was where was he you know by himself please bring my coat and my my Scrolls dying alone for what he attained the goal amen you see it's not who's there what's there because you know what people who and I've said this before with the popet I know people who Run 100 miles nobody who does it because they want to make somebody else impressed or because they want the money anybody who starts the race like that doesn't finish it it's only those who run it who say I must conquer this they're the ones who finish it's only those who start the race not for Dad not for Mom not for the church not because some Somebody's Watching only those who start the race because they see who God is they see who Christ is they see what he's done and they say I want to be there I want to attain the goal it's those who can face the opposition amen because it's a revelation right and that's the key but Grievious nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of righteousness oh I want to be righteous okay buckle on buckle on your armor you want be righteous you would to be a better man you want to be a better father Buckle in Hunker not hunker down but you know strap it in boy it yith peaceful fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby you see where I think Pentecost fell there it is when you're meeting really face to face with demon powers when you're meeting face to face with opposition there's where the testing time comes it Changs only its strongest at its weakest link that's right when you're face to face with opposition be sure that you know what you're talking about now you could get by with anything in America I went to a service here not long ago bear with me while I read this quotes a little bit lengthy but it makes the point perfectly where they was supposed to be practicing Divine Healing the fellow was jumping up and down screaming to the top of his voice kicking the pulpit as hard as he could saying God I demand you oh mercy I thought God be merciful to my brother he doesn't understand who are we to demand God to do anything he's already done it just believe him amen that's all see how did how did Brother Bram pray and I'm not making points anything else simply this point of how do was it God you this is your word this is your promise it's a faith you know there there's a there's a I can't remember the the culture I'm I'm going to butcher the name do I get it wrong but it's it's some kind of Eastern Europe northern eastern Europe kind of area these these people these men who who were known to be very strong and they lifted in silence they didn't even grunt they just lifted in silence they believed that a man should just take it and and lift it and didn't make a big deal about it they didn't shout they didn't crank music and they were known to be very strong so you know this is it you know this is what the word says so you just pray and you say God I believe it amen he had an old fellow in a sheet shaking him back and forth like this a man with a heart trouble I felt sorry for him now you can get excited right that happens but that's not what this guy's doing another man came up with rheumatism he shook that way and he hit him just as hard as he could with his hand and said I hate rheumatism that don't take Devil's Out the Devil don't care how much you hauler he's not hard of hearing but he certainly knows where Faith lays that's one thing that'll make him move right so this is this is it right here and know when it when it comes time did your did your training is your training where it needed to be then then you come to this PL place because you will and you do every day it might not be a demon of rheumatism or death or whatever but you come to face to face with these demons the desires of your flesh and it's and and it's the training that you have been the opposition that you have endured that trains you for the opposition your facing now which is going to train you for the next opposition that's right so if you fail this time don't worry get stronger there is no fight without opposition there is no Victory without the struggle amen you can't you you have to have the chaos of the world in order for you to be who you are destined to be for for who God has trained has has has what God's plan is for your life and that opposition comes in many different shapes and sizes and circumstances but it's tailor made to you it is your training program it's God's taken all the measurements of your body your muscle composition he's taken all those measurements and he says this is your plan for your life and when you step into it it's a challenge from day one but those who continually and consistently face the challenge you can be somebody who just faces The Challenge and faces the challenge you know and here and there and back and forth and you're not going to get anywhere like I said before but it's those who consistently face a challenge that increases the difficulty they are the ones that are going out and competing in the Olympics they are the ones who are reaching that point if they can do that in the natural spiritually what should we be coming to amen what should we need to embrace what's before us we need opposition it's not something we need to get rid of we need to embrace it we need to say opposition come here I need more faith you realize the world looks on us says that's ridiculous you want hardships in your life people ask why if God Loved You Then why is all this evil in the world this is why you need that opposition otherwise you'll be a weak Christian and if you avoid opposition and water on the gospel and you and you you don't say anything on the job you avoiding a chance to increase your faith God help us to embrace the opposition before us so that we can then receive a greater Faith because faith is what Revelation when we go through a battle when we Face a fight and we overcome that fight we are that that much stronger am and one day your soul this your spirit is going to get so perfect your body won't be able to hold you back that's what we're reaching forward to one day the coat won't fit anymore so you have to shed it for the new one that's the goal that's the pyramid that's the statue of a perfect man we need to outgrow this flesh but we need the flesh to outgrow cuz if we didn't have something to outgrow there would be no point amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord little short tonight but that's what you've laid on My Heart Lord it's easy to talk about it's a whole another ball game to put it into practice so Lord we ask you to please give us the strength give us the the discipline in our lives Lord Jesus to face the opposition and embrace it to embrace the the hardship embrace the trial embrace the weakness that we have to see your word overcome that embrace your word in a greater way to to see the weakness and to begin to go to the word to strengthen that to work against that to to oppose that to oppose the flesh to build our character for your kingdom Lord we we love you so much we know that that you you live this out perfectly your entire life on Earth 33 some years you refused to let go of the vision you had chances to marry and do all of these things but there was a goal there was a vision and you held to that Lord now we want to be Christlike in our behavior in our actions Lord help us father help us Lord Jesus to go to the book to go to the sermons of brother Brandon to go and feed on the message to to to make sure we get our
