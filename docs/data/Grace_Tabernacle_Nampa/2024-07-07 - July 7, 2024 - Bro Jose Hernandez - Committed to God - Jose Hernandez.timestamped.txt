[42:24] heart God bless you brother Isaac
[42:29] greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[42:32] Christ it's always a pleasure be here
[42:34] being
[42:35] here I
[42:37] was telling brother Paul back there that
[42:41] uh I I I just couldn't just pass
[42:46] through
[42:49] and I I I start feeling like this is my
[42:53] second home Church
[42:58] um I I
[43:01] uh we went to Colorado had a good time
[43:04] over
[43:05] there
[43:09] but part of my heart
[43:12] was in
[43:14] [Music]
[43:17] here and and
[43:19] [Music]
[43:21] trius
[43:23] we enjoy the word
[43:28] but you know what
[43:30] US is something is something else that
[43:33] you
[43:36] want
[43:40] and I just love you
[43:44] [Music]
[43:47] guys I I love
[43:50] the fact that
[43:53] I I can come here
[43:57] and and feel
[43:58] [Music]
[44:00] like I'm loved
[44:03] too and it's nothing special about
[44:07] me it's it's nothing special about you
[44:09] but the special is the love of Christ in
[44:13] [Music]
[44:15] us the love of
[44:18] [Music]
[44:20] Christ surpasses or
[44:24] oversees any wrongdoing
[44:28] right our brothers and
[44:33] sisters we
[44:36] have we have
[44:43] many in our life we have many ups and
[44:46] downs
[44:46] [Music]
[44:50] right but we don't we don't stay
[44:55] just think you know I'm messed up over
[45:00] here we just don't stay
[45:03] there and crying about the messed up we
[45:07] [Music]
[45:10] did we got
[45:13] up yeah we stay down on our
[45:18] knees saying Lord I'm I'm
[45:20] [Music]
[45:23] sorry I messed up here there and there
[45:26] [Music]
[45:30] but I don't want to do the same mistake
[45:32] [Music]
[45:36] again because we're crucifying Christ
[45:41] [Music]
[45:42] again if we continue continue doing the
[45:45] same thing over and
[45:48] over we just don't appreciate his
[45:53] sacrifice we don't appreciate that the
[45:56] fact that he came and die not only die
[45:58] but he
[46:02] suffered he suffered the moment he
[46:06] [Music]
[46:08] start he start doing
[46:10] his his
[46:13] work
[46:16] because nobody saw him with good eyes
[46:20] because he didn't came
[46:23] from from the
[46:25] temple he didn't have any
[46:29] [Music]
[46:34] degree but he did it for
[46:37] you and he saw he's saw
[46:41] all until 20124 that's right he saw us
[46:46] amen and he said I'm doing it for
[46:50] [Music]
[46:55] them I uh
[46:59] appreciate Brother Paul's confidence to
[47:02] allow me to stand behind this
[47:05] pulpit and I appreciate you for taking
[47:09] the time and coming this morning to hear
[47:12] from
[47:13] God
[47:15] cuz you're wasting your time to see what
[47:18] I can bring to
[47:21] you and I'm wasting your my time just
[47:24] trying to entertain you
[47:29] you know what sad thing is that the
[47:32] the a lot of churches are full because
[47:35] they like
[47:38] entertainment I heard someone say that
[47:41] if you're in a
[47:44] church that you like to hear just the
[47:47] good things that they
[47:50] say walk out of
[47:52] there because they're not preaching the
[47:55] Bible because the Bible Cuts
[47:58] us I mean we're we're human beings full
[48:00] of
[48:03] mistakes and and and the moment
[48:06] [Music]
[48:08] you take your sight out of the path of
[48:13] God you made a
[48:16] mistake when we're not when we're losing
[48:19] the
[48:20] focus and God's will for our
[48:25] life we made a mistake
[48:30] and then when the Bible comes and and
[48:32] it's telling us where
[48:34] we we're
[48:37] failing oh this flesh doesn't like
[48:41] that cuz this flesh
[48:44] enjoys the things of the world that's
[48:47] right you know last time I was here we
[48:50] spoke about the
[48:53] bread represents the flesh
[48:57] and that poor man the baker guy got
[49:02] hanged so we have to
[49:07] hang that's
[49:10] right this
[49:12] flesh so it can be turned
[49:14] [Music]
[49:16] apart so God can come and put the good
[49:19] pieces back together and put him to
[49:23] [Music]
[49:25] use it's always a pleasure traveling
[49:28] with my
[49:29] [Music]
[49:31] family I always say
[49:34] [Music]
[49:36] that I couldn't find a better
[49:42] wife she keep
[49:44] us keep up with me
[49:47] and the
[49:52] boys I think she slept like night like
[49:54] 1:00 in the morning just trying to get
[49:57] everything ready for us this
[49:59] [Music]
[50:05] morning there's so many things in
[50:08] [Music]
[50:12] life that you're not going to give
[50:15] enough thanks to God that he's given
[50:20] you even though we're full of
[50:24] mistakes sometimes we the
[50:27] we deserve
[50:29] less by your
[50:31] [Music]
[50:33] actions but you know what that's the
[50:36] beauty of loving
[50:39] [Music]
[50:44] father when he was on the
[50:46] cross you and I were on his
[50:50] mind and he thinks we deserve the
[50:54] best as a father
[50:57] I can ask you as a father do you don't
[51:00] you think your kids deserve the
[51:03] best they
[51:05] [Music]
[51:07] do but I sometimes I see that we take we
[51:12] take things for
[51:13] granted and we don't appreciate the
[51:17] sacrifice behind the gift that's
[51:22] right so I uh
[51:28] I don't know what you do but you made me
[51:29] cry every time I come
[51:31] [Music]
[51:34] here I believe is the love of
[51:37] [Music]
[51:39] God
[51:42] he's so
[51:45] [Music]
[51:50] marvelous I always try to try to find a
[51:53] good reason
[51:56] why we can quit serving God but there is
[51:59] no
[51:59] [Music]
[52:03] reason if you try hard to to get away
[52:07] from
[52:07] [Music]
[52:10] God God is going to let you
[52:15] go but you're you're going to have to
[52:18] live with the
[52:20] scars that you C yourself
[52:27] for the stubbornness not
[52:30] [Music]
[52:34] listening
[52:37] my thought this morning is
[52:42] committed to God
[52:46] [Music]
[52:49] Amen and the word
[52:55] commitment is this state or quality of
[52:59] being dedicated to c a
[53:01] [Music]
[53:03] cause or
[53:06] activity and the similar words to
[53:11] Commitment are
[53:14] dedication
[53:17] devotion Allegiance loyalty
[53:21] faithfulness fidelity
[53:27] if you can write those words
[53:29] down I'm trusting God that you
[53:33] can
[53:35] have the complete re Revelations
[53:38] Revelation from God to to this message
[53:41] if you please stand with
[53:47] me let's go to the book
[53:51] of

[56:08] father we praise your mighty
[56:11] name we thank you
[56:16] for the love that you
[56:20] can provide
[56:23] through your bride Lord
[56:26] thank you for the blessings that we
[56:30] receive I personally thank you
[56:33] Lord because you allow me to go traveled
[56:36] so many hours and come back
[56:39] lord and by your grace father we are
[56:42] here so we thank you and and and and and
[56:45] we ask you so you can come
[56:48] and reveal the word of God that we've
[56:50] been about to read father in the name of
[56:52] the Lord Jesus we ask you amen amen
[56:57] amen I
[57:06] uh honestly I don't know where to start
[57:08] I I've
[57:09] been I've been through so many
[57:12] scriptures and
[57:14] uh and all of them are
[57:19] just so
[57:21] good let's start reading verse 46 and he
[57:24] said unto them
[57:27] set your hearts unto The Words which I
[57:30] testify among you this
[57:33] day which ye shall command your children
[57:36] to observe to do all the words of this
[57:40] law
[57:41] amen
[57:43] for it is not a vain thing for you
[57:46] because it is your life
[57:49] am and through these things ye shall
[57:52] prolong your days in the land whether
[57:55] you go over yordan to possess
[57:59] it and
[58:01] then let's
[58:06] uh let's go
[58:08] to Psalms 37
[58:37] 375 excuse
[58:39] me it reads like this commit thy way
[58:44] unto the Lord trust also in
[58:47] him and he shall bring bring it to pass
[58:51] amen you may be seated
[58:58] this um scripture
[59:05] here
[59:07] I explain a little bit about the
[59:10] commitment
[59:13] so we we go to the the Bible every time
[59:17] we go to the
[59:18] Bible and and and read
[59:22] something
[59:23] uh we
[59:27] we're
[59:28] not required to learn by memory the
[59:31] whole
[59:33] Bible it's not a
[59:37] requirement
[59:39] because what is important is if you
[59:42] learn one or two words
[59:45] today let's just put those two words to
[59:50] work to be manifest through our
[59:54] life it is it says that
[59:58] uh if a
[1:00:01] person chew the food but don't swallow
[1:00:06] it spit it
[1:00:09] out eventually it's going to die of
[1:00:12] hunger so it's the same way with the
[1:00:14] word of God how many times we come to
[1:00:18] church and unfortunately there are many
[1:00:21] people that just become church goers
[1:00:25] yeah
[1:00:26] and in
[1:00:27] James the Book of James says we have to
[1:00:30] be
[1:00:31] doors not only just here and here amen
[1:00:35] because this is basically what people do
[1:00:38] they just go to church because they like
[1:00:40] to
[1:00:43] hear how beautiful the band
[1:00:46] plays and and and but we we don't pay
[1:00:50] attention that those words that the the
[1:00:52] the the the preacher are saying those
[1:00:56] words are
[1:00:57] food to our spirit and if we don't
[1:01:01] [Music]
[1:01:04] have
[1:01:05] the
[1:01:08] commitment right to make those words
[1:01:10] work in our
[1:01:12] life eventually you're going to die
[1:01:15] right because this the the word of God I
[1:01:18] mean it says here in
[1:01:20] in 47 for it is not a vain thing for you
[1:01:27] because it
[1:01:29] is your
[1:01:31] life so your life
[1:01:33] depends on this amen word right that's
[1:01:38] what what um God told
[1:01:43] Joshua don't let this book depart from
[1:01:46] you
[1:01:49] meditate day and night
[1:01:52] amen and and you know what Joshua had to
[1:01:56] commit himself to to God's
[1:02:00] Commandments to God's
[1:02:03] requirements and he did it now the
[1:02:07] question is everybody did it
[1:02:11] no but
[1:02:16] because somebody else didn't
[1:02:19] act upon those
[1:02:22] requirements we're not going to do it
[1:02:25] based on somebody else's actions
[1:02:28] right we're not here not even to imitate
[1:02:31] the pastor's actions that's
[1:02:36] right we are here to imitate Christ
[1:02:40] life amen Christ life has to be
[1:02:45] displayed in his body which is
[1:02:49] us now it's so hard to to imitate Christ
[1:02:54] life but we're not required to meet all
[1:02:57] the requirements but that Christ did it
[1:02:59] because he knows you and me we're not
[1:03:01] able to do
[1:03:04] it but when he sees you doing your
[1:03:08] 100% you think you're doing your
[1:03:11] 100% but we're not doing it 100% before
[1:03:15] the eyes of
[1:03:17] God he's there for us to complete what
[1:03:20] we're lacking of
[1:03:23] Amen because that's that's why he went
[1:03:26] to the
[1:03:27] Cross because he knew we you and I we
[1:03:30] couldn't meet those requirements that's
[1:03:33] right so he
[1:03:36] put his partial so so you and I can't
[1:03:42] have the same
[1:03:44] reward that's why he called
[1:03:47] once some people in the morning some in
[1:03:49] the noon and some of the evening but you
[1:03:53] know what the pay was the same
[1:03:57] so you you don't have you don't get to
[1:03:59] complain because you you've been working
[1:04:01] in God's
[1:04:05] Farm all your
[1:04:09] life does his his will he chose you
[1:04:13] because he saw in you a potential that
[1:04:16] you can be a
[1:04:17] help for
[1:04:20] others so we have to
[1:04:24] be grateful to to
[1:04:26] God because how many people because
[1:04:29] they've been called at the later
[1:04:31] time they've been bouncing their head so
[1:04:34] many
[1:04:35] times against the wall what what what
[1:04:38] can I
[1:04:39] do what I'm going through this well the
[1:04:42] light hasn't shine on them yet but
[1:04:45] that's where you and I we're here to
[1:04:48] help the people in need out
[1:04:50] there God called you to be a light for
[1:04:55] this
[1:04:57] Dying
[1:04:58] World and if we don't display the light
[1:05:01] that Jesus
[1:05:03] display we're missing
[1:05:05] something and I I was talking to someone
[1:05:08] the other day said
[1:05:09] uh I don't need to go to
[1:05:12] church yes but you need to have an
[1:05:17] experience with
[1:05:19] Christ because
[1:05:21] Daniel didn't need a temple to commit
[1:05:24] his life to God
[1:05:26] right but it was the circumstances that
[1:05:28] took him there but he was 100% committed
[1:05:32] to
[1:05:33] God and those people that they say oh I
[1:05:36] don't need it's just
[1:05:37] religion an excuse right because they're
[1:05:41] not committed either in church than I
[1:05:43] committed either in a house a
[1:05:46] home it's just a
[1:05:50] covering oh
[1:05:52] because brother so and so says just push
[1:05:57] play come on yeah
[1:06:01] right I mean you can push play Monday
[1:06:05] Tuesday Wednesday
[1:06:07] Thursday
[1:06:13] Saturday I heard a preacher a long time
[1:06:16] ago he said
[1:06:18] that I never understood
[1:06:22] but he said Sunday begins
[1:06:26] on Saturday around
[1:06:30] 6 and I I I never quite understood that
[1:06:34] part but the way I understand it now is
[1:06:37] that on
[1:06:40] Saturday around
[1:06:43] six you should start
[1:06:45] looking to have that connection with
[1:06:50] God you start just I mean we have things
[1:06:53] to do yes
[1:06:56] I I I I I I I tell my
[1:06:59] wife you should you should make a
[1:07:01] schedule so you
[1:07:03] can iron the the clothing for
[1:07:06] Sunday like
[1:07:10] Friday so you can
[1:07:13] have Saturday evening more
[1:07:17] relaxed and and when this this preacher
[1:07:21] was saying that like I said it's long
[1:07:22] time ago obviously it was a little
[1:07:26] L but uh I understand that you have to
[1:07:29] start getting in the same
[1:07:33] channel what God is going to bring on
[1:07:35] Sunday for
[1:07:39] me because if you're not in the same
[1:07:41] channel you're going to miss
[1:07:44] it you come to
[1:07:47] church expecting from
[1:07:50] God you you come to church expecting
[1:07:53] from
[1:07:56] The
[1:07:58] Fountain the Living
[1:08:01] Word but if we
[1:08:03] come worry
[1:08:06] about oh my boss is going to get mad at
[1:08:09] me because I forgot to do the things he
[1:08:11] told me to do on
[1:08:14] Friday
[1:08:18] or anything else right maybe the young
[1:08:22] people say I didn't did my homework
[1:08:26] I didn't do it I'm going to be in
[1:08:30] trouble no we have to start getting that
[1:08:34] connection I'm not saying you can do
[1:08:36] whatever you want from Monday through
[1:08:38] Friday
[1:08:41] but
[1:08:42] we commitment is
[1:08:45] that if you're committed with
[1:08:48] God everything that you do Apostle Paul
[1:08:51] says whatever you do do it in the name
[1:08:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:03] I
[1:09:07] uh I want
[1:09:10] to I want to go to
[1:09:13] James James 1
[1:09:28] James
[1:09:31] 1:22 but be ye doers of the word and not
[1:09:35] hearers only
[1:09:38] deceiving your own
[1:09:41] selves and then in Matthew
[1:09:43] 7:26 Jesus is telling about the person
[1:09:46] who built a
[1:09:47] house on a
[1:09:50] sand so the the storm came and then
[1:09:54] there that was not found for the
[1:09:57] house so is basically what we do when we
[1:09:59] come to church and and we don't be doors
[1:10:03] of the word of God everything is going
[1:10:07] to
[1:10:12] just it's going to be like the guy that
[1:10:14] was praying to an
[1:10:17] idol and he was asking something always
[1:10:21] asking something and then the the idol
[1:10:24] didn't never answer his pray
[1:10:26] prayer and he said oh I know why you
[1:10:28] don't answer uh don't answer me is
[1:10:30] because you can hear he doesn't have
[1:10:33] ears so he just drill a hole here and he
[1:10:36] came through
[1:10:37] here and then all he kept asking an
[1:10:41] asking the miracle and all of a sudden
[1:10:44] oh I know why it's because he comes from
[1:10:47] one ear he goes out to another
[1:10:50] one so we we don't want to be that kind
[1:10:53] of person
[1:10:55] because we we as as a parent we have to
[1:11:00] set a good example to our family and the
[1:11:04] kids have to be a good example
[1:11:06] for the kids they hang out at school so
[1:11:10] they can be an a good influence so they
[1:11:13] can they can prove to other kids that
[1:11:17] they don't believe in God that there is
[1:11:18] a living God because of their
[1:11:20] actions but if we don't get socked in
[1:11:23] into the word of God
[1:11:27] it's really easy that they can just move
[1:11:29] us from one place to
[1:11:33] another you know for how
[1:11:36] many many years we've been in church how
[1:11:40] many years you heard the word of
[1:11:45] God but it's is not it's it's not about
[1:11:48] time that's right is about when you make
[1:11:53] your
[1:11:54] decision and commit yourself to God now
[1:11:58] the commitment is not an easy thing to
[1:12:00] do that's right because commitment
[1:12:02] requires sacrifice that's
[1:12:07] right a good friend is going to make a
[1:12:11] sacrifice for his
[1:12:13] friend because he's committed his
[1:12:17] friendship so if he's if if if your
[1:12:19] friend is in trouble and you have the
[1:12:21] means to get him out of trouble
[1:12:25] even though you have to make a
[1:12:29] sacrifice you're GNA do it because
[1:12:32] you're committed to that
[1:12:35] friendship so James is saying
[1:12:39] that let's just stop
[1:12:42] being someone who's just here and here
[1:12:45] and here and
[1:12:47] here another words he wants to see the
[1:12:51] fruits he wants to see what is the word
[1:12:54] of God
[1:12:56] what kind of impact is the word of God
[1:12:58] is doing in your
[1:13:04] life like this this man in
[1:13:07] uh David
[1:13:10] was just thinking about the water of
[1:13:16] Bethlehem or if I can just have a
[1:13:20] drink you know what this man they
[1:13:23] weren't committed to the the
[1:13:26] king they didn't think about old but
[1:13:29] there's so many Philistines around it
[1:13:32] right there's so many
[1:13:36] enemies but uh a wish from the
[1:13:41] King for them because they were
[1:13:43] committed to him it was a command amen
[1:13:48] amen now just think about it just think
[1:13:51] about these actions that's it and this
[1:13:54] this man is just they were committed to
[1:13:56] another
[1:13:59] man thank God we don't have to get a
[1:14:01] sword and and a shield to go to go to go
[1:14:04] to war but we're we're we're fighting a
[1:14:08] spiritual war that's
[1:14:13] right my barber the other day she says
[1:14:15] uh she she's a
[1:14:18] Mormon she was telling me said you know
[1:14:20] what is this world is going so upside
[1:14:23] down that I mean even if uh somebody
[1:14:27] comes and and thre threatens me to kill
[1:14:30] me because my fate I will give it
[1:14:36] up I say yeah that sounds really
[1:14:40] good I mean saying is sounds really good
[1:14:43] right I said but what about they come
[1:14:45] and and tell you I'm going to kill your
[1:14:48] daughter if you don't deny your
[1:14:52] faith and she just turn on me and oh
[1:14:55] that's that's a different it's a
[1:14:57] different thing
[1:14:58] now because you know you you you can die
[1:15:01] You You Believe In Christ you you
[1:15:02] believe that if you die just you're
[1:15:05] doing me a
[1:15:08] favor but you
[1:15:10] can live with the pain that you saw your
[1:15:13] son or daughter
[1:15:16] die it's not easy it's a different
[1:15:21] story but you know what you can't
[1:15:25] complain about that because God did it
[1:15:28] he saw your son dying for you and
[1:15:33] me she couldn't answer
[1:15:35] that
[1:15:37] why I said have you heard the song I
[1:15:40] have decided to follow
[1:15:43] Jesus how many of here know the story
[1:15:45] behind
[1:15:49] that
[1:15:52] well that guy was committed
[1:15:55] to give up his life not only his life
[1:15:59] but he was committed to give up his
[1:16:01] son's life his wife's
[1:16:04] life and
[1:16:05] himself because of the love of Jesus
[1:16:09] Amen so he got the
[1:16:12] Revelation that he said I mean the guy
[1:16:16] was in
[1:16:19] India and and it was a
[1:16:22] village so a village
[1:16:25] normally is a poor people who live
[1:16:29] there and you know when you when you
[1:16:32] have
[1:16:35] needs when you have all the means to to
[1:16:38] have a a decent life you tend to to lean
[1:16:42] more on God on God's
[1:16:45] will but when you have
[1:16:48] everything I mean if you got sick oh I
[1:16:50] have insurance I'll go to see a doctor
[1:16:56] oh I I my AC run
[1:16:59] out oh I got the money in the bank I
[1:17:01] could just call the company replace
[1:17:06] it that's that's how difficult
[1:17:11] is for God to manifest in people who has
[1:17:17] everything because they don't know the
[1:17:19] need of God because every they think
[1:17:22] everything in their head is I can solve
[1:17:24] everything with money right right but
[1:17:28] the Bible says that everything
[1:17:29] everything here in this world is going
[1:17:31] to pass that's right heavens and earth
[1:17:33] will
[1:17:35] pass but you know what I
[1:17:39] experien even though I don't have
[1:17:41] money I experienced
[1:17:44] that the money has
[1:17:47] limitations science have limitations
[1:17:50] right that's right the only the only
[1:17:53] thing that
[1:17:55] doesn't have limitations is
[1:18:00] God and he's just right there for you
[1:18:04] Amen in time of
[1:18:06] need but you you have to go on your
[1:18:09] knees and say
[1:18:10] Lord I need
[1:18:21] you I'm going to
[1:18:27] share with you this it says how do you
[1:18:30] how do I
[1:18:32] explain to Abraham that is difficult for
[1:18:36] you to be faithful to God when he was
[1:18:39] asked to sacrifice his only
[1:18:43] son how do you explain to ananas Michel
[1:18:47] and Azariah that you cannot avoid being
[1:18:52] seduced by the things of the world
[1:18:56] when they prefer to be burned rather
[1:18:58] than worship
[1:19:01] idols how do you explain
[1:19:03] Daniel that it is difficult for you to
[1:19:06] have devotional devotional life because
[1:19:09] of laziness when he did not give up
[1:19:12] despite putting his life at risk
[1:19:14] becoming a lion's
[1:19:17] food you know we always have excuses we
[1:19:20] always have things to do in life and I
[1:19:23] mean my might be one of those guilty
[1:19:27] ones but is it requires a
[1:19:32] sacrifice and again and I'm sorry if I
[1:19:34] said it this too much or too often but
[1:19:37] this flesh has to be put at sacrifice
[1:19:42] amen because this flesh is the
[1:19:45] one given us a hard time that's right to
[1:19:49] get committed to
[1:19:51] God because the things you do as long as
[1:19:55] pleases this
[1:19:59] flesh it w be a
[1:20:01] problem but when you
[1:20:04] try to do things for
[1:20:08] God this flesh starts complaining that's
[1:20:12] right absolutely that's
[1:20:14] right and I can tell you something
[1:20:17] really
[1:20:18] simple we can go on our knees to pray
[1:20:21] because it hurts yeah oh I'm getting all
[1:20:27] I hardly get up
[1:20:31] after and and you you grabbed your Bible
[1:20:33] and
[1:20:38] started I mean you
[1:20:41] have so much
[1:20:46] sleep and if you go to bed to
[1:20:50] sleep you can
[1:20:53] sleep now tell me what it is what is
[1:20:57] causing
[1:20:58] that I mean it's the
[1:21:00] enemy he knows what wires to put
[1:21:05] together so you
[1:21:06] cannot get in connection with
[1:21:09] God if you have crosswires you're going
[1:21:12] to spark but that spark is going to
[1:21:14] cause to cut the
[1:21:17] power
[1:21:20] right so you don't you don't cross wires
[1:21:26] so the current goes that's right one way
[1:21:30] and comes
[1:21:31] back the other
[1:21:33] way so when you make a sacrifice for
[1:21:37] Christ it might hurt going this way but
[1:21:41] guess what yeah the blessings are coming
[1:21:45] that's
[1:21:46] right and when you receive the blessings
[1:21:49] what you
[1:21:50] do praise
[1:21:53] God it's the same thing when when when
[1:21:56] the rain comes to to a dry land and and
[1:21:58] and and the the wheat or whatever the
[1:22:04] corn that's what brother said
[1:22:07] that they just get up and say praise the
[1:22:10] Lord I got
[1:22:12] water but the weat
[1:22:16] too but at the end well brother Paul is
[1:22:20] a farmer he knows everything about
[1:22:22] that at the end he he doesn't doesn't
[1:22:24] care about the wheat he cares about the
[1:22:27] corn because he the good thing he's he
[1:22:30] going to make money he doesn't make
[1:22:32] money out of the
[1:22:35] Wheats so we we we we're we're in church
[1:22:39] to
[1:22:41] become the grain of weed that's
[1:22:46] right oh yeah it's
[1:22:48] beautiful but you know what even the
[1:22:50] grain of wheat is going to have to be
[1:22:52] that's right amen we don't like that
[1:22:57] either and even though we sing so many
[1:22:59] times to be like Jesus to be like Jesus
[1:23:03] well Jesus got
[1:23:07] bit we have to be willing to receive the
[1:23:10] beating that's
[1:23:13] right so the the good thing of us can
[1:23:16] come
[1:23:18] out I I I saw a reflection really I mean
[1:23:21] it's simple but you see the guitar right
[1:23:24] there
[1:23:26] it
[1:23:27] says the a Christian is like the strings
[1:23:31] of the
[1:23:33] guitar so and the
[1:23:36] head you have to be connected to the
[1:23:38] head that's right and you have to be
[1:23:40] connected to the B that's
[1:23:44] right and in order for the string to do
[1:23:49] a fine
[1:23:51] sound it has to be tense yeah that's
[1:23:53] right that's it
[1:23:57] but do you think that string is not
[1:23:59] suffering right there that's right
[1:24:02] that's it that's it it's in pain yes sir
[1:24:07] you you don't know but it's in
[1:24:10] pain and we don't like to be in pain
[1:24:12] that's it we like to be relaxed amen I
[1:24:15] might be preaching to myself this
[1:24:16] morning but it is the truth it is the
[1:24:20] truth that that that when when
[1:24:23] everything is easy
[1:24:25] yeah we enjoy it but you know what we
[1:24:30] lose
[1:24:33] interest as soon as as as soon as the
[1:24:36] the I mean very simple you give your
[1:24:39] gifts Christmas gift to the
[1:24:42] kids they're excited about unwrapping
[1:24:44] this those
[1:24:46] gifts and even if it's a 100,000 I mean
[1:24:51] a $100 or $1,000 gift they're going to
[1:24:54] be hi it only one night maybe next
[1:24:57] day 3 days later you're going to find
[1:25:00] him playing with sticks out there back
[1:25:02] in the
[1:25:04] backyard or going back to the old
[1:25:09] toys so the string in the
[1:25:13] guitar to do it to give out its best has
[1:25:18] to be real tense
[1:25:22] amen so the head is cry
[1:25:26] am and the
[1:25:29] base is the
[1:25:34] church so it has to be
[1:25:39] tense oh I don't want to go to church
[1:25:41] because there's so many Hypocrites there
[1:25:44] maybe one one of them is you have you
[1:25:47] thought about
[1:25:49] that because when you do
[1:25:52] this three fingers are pointed back to
[1:25:58] me
[1:26:01] is it's so easy to give
[1:26:05] up when the things get
[1:26:12] tense
[1:26:13] continues how do
[1:26:15] I explain to Isaiah that to live a
[1:26:20] Christian life is very hard
[1:26:24] when he died chopped in
[1:26:28] pieces how do you explain to Prophet
[1:26:30] Jeremiah that is difficult for you to
[1:26:32] get out of the pit of discouragement
[1:26:35] when he was put up to his net in mud
[1:26:38] blocked in his
[1:26:41] sister how do you explain John the
[1:26:44] Baptist that you are afraid of losing
[1:26:47] your job if you point out the
[1:26:50] irregularities you see when he lost his
[1:26:53] head
[1:26:55] for the
[1:26:58] truth how do you explain
[1:27:01] Steven that it is difficult to stand and
[1:27:04] firm in the faith when he was stuned to
[1:27:09] death how do you explain Peter that you
[1:27:12] feel like miserable traitor to the
[1:27:14] master when he stood up and G in
[1:27:17] evidence he died upside down on the
[1:27:23] cross how do you explain
[1:27:25] Paul that you cannot stand being mocked
[1:27:28] because of your faith when he was
[1:27:32] whipped and almost killed because of his
[1:27:37] faith how do you explain Jesus that is
[1:27:41] hard for you to
[1:27:43] forgive when he was in the cross he
[1:27:46] asked his father to forgive the
[1:27:51] one now is a Christian life easy
[1:27:56] no is a Christian Life requires a
[1:27:59] sacrifice
[1:28:01] yes but you're not the only one that's
[1:28:06] right I mean what is a sacrifice for you
[1:28:08] maybe is is not a sacrifice for the
[1:28:12] neighbor and his sacrifice is not your
[1:28:15] sacrifice because you know that you you
[1:28:18] overcame that situation by
[1:28:20] trusting your situation in God and and
[1:28:24] God give you the
[1:28:26] peace the Peace of Mind peace of your
[1:28:29] heart but there is always something in
[1:28:32] life as long as we stay in this stinking
[1:28:34] flesh that's
[1:28:38] right we're going to stink I'm
[1:28:42] sorry but we have to I mean the same way
[1:28:46] you you you have to maintenance in your
[1:28:50] body you stop doing maintenance in your
[1:28:52] body
[1:28:55] that's
[1:28:56] right you have to do maintenance in your
[1:28:59] spiritual body too right because the the
[1:29:02] moment we
[1:29:04] quit letting the the the water of the
[1:29:07] the war come through and it start
[1:29:09] washing us every day every
[1:29:12] day you stop doing
[1:29:17] that I mean simple as that right
[1:29:25] we don't we don't we don't
[1:29:31] have we don't we don't have to to work
[1:29:37] miracles every
[1:29:39] day we just have to display the love of
[1:29:42] Jesus that's right to
[1:29:48] someone bro Brian says I rather have a
[1:29:51] church Full Of Love Of Christ than full
[1:29:53] of gifts right
[1:29:57] amen and you know what because the gift
[1:29:59] can
[1:30:01] be copy that's right the enemy
[1:30:07] can can do the actions of speaking in
[1:30:12] tongues and things like
[1:30:14] that I was telling brother Paul that at
[1:30:17] one time in Colorado I went to a
[1:30:19] Pentecostal church and I invite people
[1:30:22] to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:24] and I and I say I I I I mean I haven't
[1:30:27] been in
[1:30:29] church uh for
[1:30:32] many I will say couple day years so I
[1:30:37] went to visit this church and then I
[1:30:40] went and they were just training them to
[1:30:43] to just how to twist the tongue and then
[1:30:46] and do this noise and and eventually
[1:30:48] it's going to come
[1:30:49] out I just walk out of
[1:30:52] there that's a big nice beautiful
[1:30:57] church but what good is in
[1:31:00] it
[1:31:04] vain yeah they're beautiful buildings
[1:31:06] but empty right there is no holy ghost
[1:31:09] in there right and here they are trying
[1:31:11] to teach gifts of the Holy Ghost the
[1:31:13] thing that they don't
[1:31:15] have right that's
[1:31:18] right I I'm not a Christian because of
[1:31:21] the gifts of the Holy Ghost right
[1:31:24] I'm not after that I just want I just
[1:31:27] want to
[1:31:28] be a
[1:31:31] billboard if someone sees me that I can
[1:31:35] reflect a little bit at least a little
[1:31:37] bit of Jesus
[1:31:40] Christ because the moment that you are
[1:31:44] willing to to commit and do the put this
[1:31:49] flesh to sacrifice for Christ
[1:31:52] amen you even know
[1:31:55] how you do it but you do things that you
[1:31:58] don't imagine that's it
[1:32:02] that's and you're going to be amazed of
[1:32:05] yourself because it's not you it's
[1:32:09] Christ in
[1:32:13] you imagine Paul going
[1:32:18] on to
[1:32:20] Damascus in his heart and in his mind
[1:32:24] was to kill and put in prison as many
[1:32:28] Christians as he
[1:32:30] can this is a
[1:32:34] man thinking his own
[1:32:37] way this is a man
[1:32:40] doing somebody else's
[1:32:44] Commandments but when he come and
[1:32:47] faces the
[1:32:50] word the very word
[1:32:55] and that light in form of
[1:32:57] light he became different
[1:33:01] man BR Brandon say
[1:33:04] that anyone who comes in contact with
[1:33:07] Jesus Christ he cannot be the same again
[1:33:13] right and if you think you have to come
[1:33:16] in contact with Jesus Christ and you
[1:33:18] cannot get rid of this get rid of
[1:33:21] that I'll suggest
[1:33:24] just to go
[1:33:27] back on your knees
[1:33:31] again
[1:33:33] because the only way we
[1:33:37] can
[1:33:41] achieve the goal is by Christ being in
[1:33:45] our lives that's exactly right that's
[1:33:47] the only way when Jesus comes and and
[1:33:50] leaves and
[1:33:52] Reigns in
[1:33:54] this Temple that's right because that's
[1:33:56] what we called to be a temple of the
[1:33:58] Holy Ghost that's
[1:34:00] right we are capable of doing things
[1:34:03] that we're not Unthinkable things that's
[1:34:07] right imagine walking
[1:34:10] Jesus going to to to see this
[1:34:16] uh person with
[1:34:19] Legion of demons
[1:34:24] people
[1:34:26] think that it was an easy task for Jesus
[1:34:30] because oh he was
[1:34:33] God but he said but brother Brown says
[1:34:37] that he was a human being as you and
[1:34:40] I but it was God at the same time that's
[1:34:43] right amen so he felt the pain that you
[1:34:47] feel right now amen because he was a
[1:34:49] human being that's right oh he cried on
[1:34:52] the T of Lazarus yes he cried because he
[1:34:56] was a human being but as a God he say
[1:34:59] just command Lazarus forward
[1:35:03] right that's the kind of
[1:35:05] life we have to
[1:35:08] display amen so when we when we required
[1:35:12] to pray for a sick
[1:35:13] person we didn't call Brother
[1:35:16] Paul he's not the only one with the
[1:35:19] authority to
[1:35:20] pray every single one of us but
[1:35:27] we need to live the kind of life that we
[1:35:32] ready for that because otherwise we can
[1:35:36] come up with those those guys that we're

[1:35:43] Jesus I know Paul
[1:35:46] yeah but who are you that's right so we
[1:35:50] don't Bluff we have to make sure we
[1:35:51] don't we're not bluffing amen because
[1:35:54] amen we have to act upon the
[1:36:01] scriptures but we have to make sure that
[1:36:04] we are living the type of life that the
[1:36:07] demon can come and challenge you and if
[1:36:11] he
[1:36:13] does you're ready for the
[1:36:22] fight why is Comm commment so
[1:36:27] important the Lord leads with unfailing
[1:36:31] love and faithfulness all who keep his
[1:36:34] command Covenant and obey his
[1:36:37] demands when you are committed to
[1:36:39] following God he will lead you to his
[1:36:42] will for your
[1:36:44] life the satisfying and fulfilling goal
[1:36:47] for which he has created you amen
[1:36:51] amen that's Psalms 25
[1:36:54] 510 in Psalms 3123 says for the Lord
[1:36:58] protects those who are loyal to him now
[1:37:01] the question is do you think it's worth
[1:37:04] to be loyal to God or not yes it is I
[1:37:06] mean he is the one who fights for you
[1:37:10] amen the enemy is going to rise up his
[1:37:13] army but you be loyal to God he's going
[1:37:16] to fight for you
[1:37:18] amen when you are committed to God he is
[1:37:22] committed to to watching you out for for
[1:37:25] you and caring for
[1:37:27] you Ruth 1:14 and again they wept
[1:37:32] together and Nora kissed her
[1:37:33] mother-in-law goodbye but
[1:37:36] Ruth clung tightly to
[1:37:38] Naomi commitment is the true Mark of
[1:37:42] friendship amen right I mean just think
[1:37:45] about
[1:37:47] Ruth what Naomi has to offer
[1:37:50] her she has nothing what old
[1:37:54] she had
[1:37:56] nothing she didn't even know if she was
[1:37:58] going to be able to to repossess the the
[1:38:02] the lands she lost when she
[1:38:07] left so Ruth was
[1:38:11] committed because of the
[1:38:13] rebolation that's it listen that's right
[1:38:17] because of her choice that's
[1:38:20] right God blessed her to become part of
[1:38:23] the lineage of Jesus Christ
[1:38:28] amen do you think she think about that
[1:38:32] no it's God's
[1:38:35] mercy God's grace that's right when
[1:38:39] you're loyal to
[1:38:41] God God is going to bless you
[1:38:45] amen he's going to give you more than
[1:38:47] you deserve that's right that's for sure
[1:38:49] I mean do you think she deserve to be
[1:38:51] part of the lineage of Jesus Christ
[1:38:53] being an idol I mean
[1:38:56] idolator she she came
[1:38:59] from a city that they just know about
[1:39:04] Idols but she said you know what uh
[1:39:08] Naomi I'll go with you no matter
[1:39:14] what and I believe and this is me and I
[1:39:18] believe what the moment she said your
[1:39:20] God will be my God yeah yeah that's
[1:39:24] settled amen that's right absolutely
[1:39:26] right because she commit to
[1:39:30] God she didn't commit to Naomi Naomi had
[1:39:34] nothing to offer her eveni said I mean
[1:39:38] do you expect me to have another
[1:39:41] children and and you're going to wait
[1:39:42] for them to gra up she didn't care about
[1:39:45] that amen
[1:39:54] 1 Corinthians 13:7 says love never gives
[1:39:59] up never loses Faith amen it's always
[1:40:04] hopeful and endures through every
[1:40:08] circumstance
[1:40:10] amen commitment is the evidence of
[1:40:14] love for one another
[1:40:19] amen what are the characteristics of a
[1:40:23] committed
[1:40:26] person Proverbs 11:3 says honesty guides
[1:40:30] good people a loyal person is
[1:40:34] trustworthy and thereof
[1:40:39] honest Chronicle 1 Chronicles 11:18 says
[1:40:42] so this the so the three men broke
[1:40:45] through the Philistines lines drew some
[1:40:47] water from the well by the gate in
[1:40:50] Bethlehem and brought it back to David
[1:40:53] a loyal person will make great personal
[1:40:57] sacrifices for friends amen it was a big
[1:41:00] sacrifice they risking their life just
[1:41:02] for a cup of water and what did David
[1:41:06] did poured out on you know why because
[1:41:10] David also was committed to a higher
[1:41:12] power God he says my life is not worthy
[1:41:16] to the the cause of this life so he
[1:41:19] didn't in sacrifice to God Amen
[1:41:23] he offered the sacrifice they did to
[1:41:32] God what does it mean to be committed to
[1:41:35] God Matthew
[1:41:37] 41920 Jesus called out the to them come
[1:41:40] follow me and I will show you how to
[1:41:43] fish for people and they left their Nets
[1:41:46] at once and follow him commitment to
[1:41:49] follow God requires decision of the Mind
[1:41:53] follow it by Act of
[1:41:57] will yes we can go to church every
[1:41:59] Sunday every Wednesday but if you're not
[1:42:01] committed to God doesn't do any good to
[1:42:04] you that's right that's right Psalms
[1:42:07] 37:5 commit everything you do to the
[1:42:11] Lord Proverbs 3:6 seek seek God's will
[1:42:16] in all you do that's right and he will
[1:42:18] show you which path to take commitment
[1:42:22] to the Lord manifest itself to obedient
[1:42:25] trust Amen in Luke
[1:42:28] 14:27 if you do not carry your own cross
[1:42:32] and follow me you cannot be my disciple
[1:42:35] that's right but don't begin until you
[1:42:39] come the
[1:42:42] cost you have to think okay this is
[1:42:45] going to be
[1:42:46] costly are you are you up for the
[1:42:48] challenge
[1:42:50] are commitment to God is costly because
[1:42:53] to follow him is to leave
[1:42:56] lesser but every attractive thing
[1:43:00] behind Daniel 3:17 says if we are thrown
[1:43:04] into the Blazing furnace the god whom we
[1:43:07] serve is able to save us but even if he
[1:43:11] doesn't we want to make it clear to
[1:43:13] you we will never bow to your
[1:43:18] Gods commitment
[1:43:20] is is being willing to to accept the
[1:43:24] something painful consequences of
[1:43:27] obedience to God when you are committed
[1:43:30] to God there will always be those
[1:43:32] committed to
[1:43:35] position and you will always stand for
[1:43:37] it this is this sense of spiritual
[1:43:40] warfare and any bottle there will be
[1:43:43] some
[1:43:44] wounds so as as soon as you're committed
[1:43:47] to God there is always somebody is
[1:43:50] committed to the opposite
[1:43:53] right so he's gonna give you a hard time
[1:43:56] yeah the the the the same way God is
[1:44:00] equipment equipping
[1:44:03] you the enem is equipping
[1:44:07] his that's right he's arming and you
[1:44:11] know what the
[1:44:14] the sometimes we think we know so much
[1:44:16] Bible and but the enemy knows more Bible
[1:44:20] than us yeah that's right
[1:44:25] so that's why James says here we have to
[1:44:28] be
[1:44:30] doors because knowing the
[1:44:33] Bible doesn't put you in a higher place
[1:44:35] that's right right that's right but when
[1:44:38] you become a
[1:44:41] doorer it puts you in a different
[1:44:44] position that's right it separates you
[1:44:46] from the
[1:44:49] crowd not because you you're more
[1:44:52] important no is because the life in
[1:44:54] Christ in you amen takes you to a place
[1:44:57] that's right amen
[1:44:59] where you cannot be
[1:45:01] touched By God's
[1:45:04] enemy unless God allows it amen that's
[1:45:07] exactly there is a little story that
[1:45:08] there
[1:45:10] were two
[1:45:12] friends one was a a Christian and the
[1:45:15] other one was a A marcker or
[1:45:19] unbeliever and they got to
[1:45:24] uh they want they made plans to go to
[1:45:27] hand
[1:45:29] Ducks
[1:45:32] so that
[1:45:34] morning the unbeliever showed up his
[1:45:37] friend's
[1:45:38] house and he picked up over the window
[1:45:41] and he saw him
[1:45:45] praying and when he saw him praying he
[1:45:47] start laughing within
[1:45:50] himself and he said when they went out
[1:45:53] and
[1:45:54] say see my life is easier than
[1:45:58] yours because this morning when I was
[1:46:01] coming in I saw I saw you praying and I
[1:46:04] heard you saying Lord please help
[1:46:08] me to get rid of this
[1:46:11] situation help me to conquer
[1:46:14] this problem that I'm
[1:46:17] in see the enemy doesn't bother me I
[1:46:22] don't have to pray pray God I don't have
[1:46:24] to pray any to any
[1:46:28] anyone and the Christian friend
[1:46:31] says okay when we go hunt
[1:46:36] Ducks you
[1:46:38] should you kill
[1:46:40] one and the other one is
[1:46:42] wounded which one are you going to go
[1:46:45] first the one is dead or the one is
[1:46:50] wounded he say well I'm going the one is
[1:46:54] wounded because the dead is already
[1:46:56] there I I have
[1:46:58] it well is the same
[1:47:01] thing when the de the devil has you he's
[1:47:06] not worried about
[1:47:07] you he's worried the about the one he
[1:47:11] doesn't have
[1:47:12] yet so we're in struggling yes like I
[1:47:17] say as long as we stay in this place
[1:47:19] we're going to have struggles in life
[1:47:20] amen
[1:47:23] but we're not we're not called to quit
[1:47:26] that's right right we are called because
[1:47:29] the Bible says we are more done a
[1:47:33] conqueror he said a sample of it he
[1:47:37] conquered
[1:47:39] death that's what that's why Paul he got
[1:47:42] the Revelation
[1:47:44] says I don't mind
[1:47:47] dying he got
[1:47:51] bit throwing in
[1:47:54] jail but he was committed to God Amen if
[1:47:58] they if they let me go praise God if
[1:48:00] they don't let me go praise
[1:48:02] God Amen if they kill me Hallelujah I'm
[1:48:06] going
[1:48:13] home Romans 121 says give your bodies to
[1:48:16] God commitment is more than intellectual
[1:48:19] agreement it involves sacrific I
[1:48:25] giving of the whole
[1:48:27] self not it's not just part of
[1:48:31] you all of you I think there is a song
[1:48:35] is he wants all of
[1:48:38] you but we don't want to give up all of
[1:48:42] us because there is always something
[1:48:44] that is really hard for us to get rid of
[1:48:49] it oh but I enjoy so much this watch out
[1:48:54] amen if you enjoy one thing of this
[1:48:56] world it's
[1:48:59] danger because that
[1:49:03] is in between you that's it and God Amen
[1:49:08] that's it that's and everything that is
[1:49:10] between you and God becomes an idol
[1:49:13] that's it that's
[1:49:17] right I think I'm going to stop right
[1:49:19] here brother Paul
[1:49:28] I if it's okay I would like to ask
[1:49:33] brother Jonathan to come and he has a a
[1:49:36] song to to
[1:49:40] play and um see
[1:49:46] when when when you see things like
[1:49:50] this young people doing things for
[1:49:55] God I mean it gives you
[1:49:58] Joy does but but just looking up looking
[1:50:04] down and looking
[1:50:06] back and I say what did I
[1:50:09] do I I did nothing other than I
[1:50:14] just giving back to
[1:50:17] God and eventually they're going to have
[1:50:19] to make a decision that's right because
[1:50:21] it's between God I'm him that's right
[1:50:24] right my role here is to in intr
[1:50:28] introduce them to Amen to God Amen give
[1:50:31] him instructions about
[1:50:34] God and
[1:50:37] they they're going to have to make their
[1:50:39] own decision that's
[1:50:41] right the same way I did my own
[1:50:46] decision the same way you you make your
[1:50:51] decision every every single one of us we
[1:50:54] have to have our own experience that's
[1:50:56] ex
[1:50:57] right because we cannot live by the
[1:51:00] experience of the
[1:51:01] pastor we cannot live by the experience
[1:51:04] of our parents that's
[1:51:07] right some of us maybe don't have
[1:51:09] Christian
[1:51:12] parents but you know what when you give
[1:51:15] your heart to God I mean we is dreaded
[1:51:18] if you're loyal to God he's going to be
[1:51:20] fighting for you oh the enemy is never
[1:51:23] going to give up that's
