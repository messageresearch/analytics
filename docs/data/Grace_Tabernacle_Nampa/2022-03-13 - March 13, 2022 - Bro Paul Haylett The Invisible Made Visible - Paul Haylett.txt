this morning amen hallelujah my god is tremendous you know [Music] sometimes you just struggle to say brother so-and-so said but i'm telling you we were there in orlando brother barry was preaching to us on the sunday morning following the marriage seminar and he was telling us we need to stop and look up and see how great our god is we get so caught up we get so busy we got so concerned and we fail to stop and see how great our god is and i say lord help us to take that time to look to you and see how supernatural how incredible how beautiful how powerful and how compassionate you are oh hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord amen well just have a few things that i want to share with you before we start first off i want to welcome the tea catch family and the grant families amen uh just a lovely time of fellowship uh forgot how fun these people were amen but um we've been reminded and we're really happy to have you here with us amen i want to give you greetings had specific instruction from brother berry coffee brother danny stevens brother stacy goodbread to send greetings to you and just some great things come out of that we went to a marriage seminar was encouraged to to hear these things the encouragement uh the reminder that god is the one who established the institution of marriage and that's why satan is fighting so hard against it and so just remember whatever troubles come our way remember this was god's ordained plan and god's in charge and if we will just stay on the word of god just uh you know continue to remind ourselves and look up and see how great is our god it was just a lovely time amen and so um we want to also uh just mention here um to remember the ukraine and and those that are laboring on their behalf um you know saints it's uh sometimes uh we we see things take place we see uh actions taken there's there's uh food and clothing and shelter arranged and it's removed from us and we kind of tend to forget there's someone who's laboring at that someone who carries a burden and you know my brother and sister it is the grace of god as we look at these things to realize that that god had a plan and you know we are here and maybe our struggle might be in the greatest battle ever fought and and we're struggling with something in our life and we don't see buildings blowing up and craters in the street but satan would desire to you know blow up and crater our thoughts and our confidence and who we are and and uh you know it's there that god's preparing us right because remember that uh power without character is satanic and we are on the very cusp saints of the releasing of the greatest power ever and uh when i say that that power actually has already been released and we are seeing the manifestation of that and what is coming forth and uh brother uh isaac will you put that photo up just want you to see this is just a small representation of those you are praying for huddled in a basement with cannon firing rockets explosions and all kinds of things taking place around them and i just wanted you to look this morning and just realize that it's not just an inanimate prayer request that we're praying for out here of of just something but real believers and i believe i can say with a hundred percent that if that was us in the basement they would be praying for us and so just be faithful i i pray just to lift these saints there's many many other photos that brother berry is being very faithful to gather together and disperse and so uh we want to we have given an offering uh here just a few days a week or so ago from the church and just in communication with brother berry he's not so listening fun so i don't want anybody to get the idea that brother berry is running around trying to collect money but in in talking with him just a couple days ago uh we're going to make another offering as we put it in terms i believe it was brother barry that actually brought it up in this fashion in the beginning but it's good to have a pipeline but if there's nothing in it then there's nothing to be received and so we're going to be sending another offering in um probably a couple weeks or a little bit shy of that and it's been mentioned to me hey i didn't know what can i do so i want to put it this way um just put it in the offering or whatever mark it specifically for the ukraine and we will we will pass this on amen and uh but let me put it this way also if i i don't have to put my foot in my mouth i'm giving away as it were your money and this is what we as believers freely give into the body of christ into the church not to now god's blessed us we're finishing up our basement here and we're blessed in that fashion but the prophet speaks many times that god did not give these blessings to us to build great big churches fine robes and big houses and cars but to do the work of the body of christ and so i i just encourage you if you have something that's been laid upon your heart you want to give just just go ahead and mark that and put it in the offering or give it to brother ivan or brother isaac and we will make sure that that money uh makes it to the ukraine already lovely reports uh coming back of the needs that have been met you know uh god is you ever had god just answer a need just so specific you knew it was no man no person no whatever figured this out and we're hearing those kind of reports out of the ukraine of needs very specifically money coming on time and brothers going into the stores and literally able to buy all that they needed and then maybe thinking well we should maybe get a little more of this going back and the store is completely empty nothing there now you know the lord knew what time that those funds needed to arrive in their hands to be able to go and and satisfy those needs and so um we just want to remember them so uh brother abel is going to um be coming it's interesting how it is time you know it's been a while since brother abel sister hattie come to visit us and people are like i don't remember them well whether you remember brother abel or not you're going to be blessed and uh this coming sunday and we're going to have a fellowship to follow we should be hearing a whoo-hoo out of somebody amen in the basement amen so just uh looking forward to that and so i don't know you know i'll leave this to to you know i hear this phrase often said my people will contact your people so sister jerry is my people and um sisters you are your husband's people and so if you would all coordinate with one another uh on the food and then we also definitely want to stress uh coordination on the desert amen so i have something that is very very dear to my heart this morning to share with you and it makes my heart exceedingly glad to see god moving in our midst to see the blessings that god has poured out upon us and our sister daniela is going to be baptized after the service this morning and i just say thank you lord may the power of god continue to move in our youth amen just my time flies my niece baptized what a privilege for brother chris to baptize his daughter uh how how special uh elena just um you know having a desire in the heart we're seeing this where it's not a little fad or a fashion like oh look i ought to do this but it is a continual voice coming back to the parents saying i want to do this and that just stirs my heart it's not oh they did it i'll do it also but something that's been ongoing over a course of time the mention you know dad mom i want to get baptized and and that's what we love to see and we don't want this just to be an event as it is but we want it to be a marker a milestone in their life that if the lord tarries years that they can look back and say you know what there was my anchor post it was jesus christ and and so i'm very very happy to announce that so just ask you all not to run off uh after church and uh we'll all meet down in the basement and we're going to have a baptism thank you lord and then maybe you want to take a moment to look around and and see the fellowship hall there amen before i start into my thought amen so this is my starting point let's push play amen i just want to just felt very led to share this with you saints with all the things that's happening in the world today we look around china is making its threats uh we're gonna we're gonna take over taiwan and if you mess with us you'll regret it we see what's happening with russia we see what's happening all over these little signs of the times that are there and uh you know i just want to re reiterate to you this morning do not be afraid of the nations you see that's what satan wants us to do now the prophet of god pointed these things out the word of god he he brought it out right god interprets his own word but it got brought out and we look at the signs that it's there but don't be afraid of the nations because my brother and sister a lukewarm spirit is much more dangerous than the nations so let's not get distracted with what's going on in the world around us because that's not our issue right the scripture says that if they kill our flesh no big deal the first death but the second death the spiritual death is the one we should be concerned with so while you look at the news however you look at the news i encourage you just to be focused on the fact god made a promise he cannot fail and we are standing on that promise today by the word of god now you know we can go brother chris posted a lovely quote there to uh a lovely posting to the church whatsapp and you look at these things my brother and sister the encouragement we look at this if god ordained you and i we can't miss it if god ordained a loved one husband wife children distant relatives they cannot miss it so what we want to do is walk and live in the perfect will of god that we could have the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man which that scripture includes our sisters the fervent effectual prayer not the prayer of desperation not the prayer of the forlorn or discouraged but the fervent effectual prayer that is a prayer the prophet of god says that has no hindrances coming to the throne of god my those are the prayers that make a difference the lord help us amen let's just stand as we go to the word this morning thank you brother jason sister emmy brother sean i appreciate that amen i want to speak to you once again you know sometimes it it seems maybe hard for everybody to make the connection of the two sides of obedience but it makes sense to me so at the moment that's all that mattered to me but uh you know we look at this and the reason i have and as i explained to you before the two sides of obedience is because we will either align ourselves with the word of god or we'll align ourselves with the spirit of disobedience and so as we come into this realm of obedience to the word then we would find ourselves looking at the word now you don't have to raise the hand you can say men if you feel like it but it's not always easy saying amen to the word of god there's things in our life we come face to face with and we say oh my but what we don't want and we'll touch on this in a little bit we don't want to ever let that become a seed of doubt a seed of fear or a seed that we become resistant to the word now we're not talking about man's ideas we're talking the word and so as we come in that my brother and sister there's always these two sides a decision that we must make i want to title this thought today the invisible made visible and i take this from a quote and we shall share that in just a few minutes amen we'll go into the word of god john the 13th chapter this morning amen starting with the 12th verse and we'll see that this is part of the scripture that we take a communion time and we'll kind of move beyond that and expand you might say the thought because we often just stop right there in the reading of the word amen so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to you now saints i want to take this for just a moment outside of the context of communion know ye what i have done to you yeah you've taken me out of the pit you've taken me from the briar patch you've taken me from despair you've taken me and you set me up in heavenly places oh today we should know what god has done for us we don't need little weak need limp handed oh yeah god save me no what did he save you from oh what did he do to us saints oh how beautiful i say thank you lord you call me master and lord and you say well for so i am if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet for i have given you an example that you should do as i have done to you verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them amen heavenly father we ask you to come this morning speak to our hearts lord and we just open our hearts today lord we come hungry we come thirsty we come desiring father reassurance of your word father a greater opening or revelation of you father just asking lord to see you more clearly ask you to speak to every need today father we as a needy people continually face changing circumstances and lord we don't just need one answer father and we need you to be with us each and every day lord to speak to us and we ask your blessings upon the saints lord the bride of christ around the world father specifically today lord the saints in the ukraine lord we love you and adore you we ask this in your precious name amen you may be seated and you know we look at these things as it is pertaining to communion and you know i i thank the lord for that because uh i know for myself that communion is a time that i just have a i don't know a great bubbling a great something pushing up in my soul just to think back as a as a man and the shortcomings that i would have as a man and what the grace of god has done for me and communion is you know very very special to me now i want to go on into these other verses now he says here i speak not of you all so as he's speaking the word he's declaring that this doesn't apply to each and every one when we when we talk about the hypocrite and we talk about the idolater these words don't apply to everyone that's hearing them and so he says i speak not of you all i know in whom i know whom i have chosen but the scripture may be fulfilled and so it's there is he speaking these words out you know i remember as i was working my way back to the lord many years ago and it's to me is more of a paradox as i get older and what god has called me to do i i look how faithful the lord was that here i i was a young man drifted away from the principles of the gospel and yet i could look and see that uh when when i first started coming back to the lord and they would talk about the hypocrite i felt crushed i was like that's me but as time went on and the word was washing me when it talked about the hypocrite there was something that come alive and i realized some of my behaviors are hypocritical but i am not the hypocrite because god was revealing or opening his word for us to see then it's not this flesh that is going to judge us but it's in the spirit or the heart of man and so it's in that realm that we come and as we start to see the word open up and be revealed or revelated to us we start to realize that as satan wars against the flesh god is redeeming the soul and so there is the conflict of man right there that's why we have this great battle my brother and sister not to downplay it this morning but the greatest battle ever fought will not be armageddon it will not be you know on the plains of uh europe or on the plains of america the greatest battle as the prophet of god said will be fought right here and so it's there that satan in this battlefield is trying to brand you with certain titles or certain things that would brand you to a place that you would say you know in this position i cannot reach out and claim this promise of god because i'm not worthy but god said you know what i have made you worthy and so it's there that i am not talking to you when i speak these words of judgment because by revelation you will judge yourself that's the thing i find so beautiful my brother and sister we don't have to hammer away at the church judge yourself judge yourself judge yourself because the holy ghost will come down and stir our heart and soul and we will find ourselves compelled to judge ourselves oh thank you lord amen so it's there he sees i speak not of you all i know whom i'm chosen can we say this morning thank you lord that we know who he has chosen also he has shared that revelation with us amen that the scripture may be fulfilled and that's something that we must never forget we can look around now it's a bad habit and lord help me i'm getting better at this habit but i have a habit of sometimes looking back saying well you know if i had stepped right instead of left if i had not bought that or done this if i had not done any of you ever do that yeah you know in some terms they call it buyer's remorse and other terms they call it second guessing however it would be but you see my brother and sister the word of god has come and has made its declaration and god will move you i almost included it this morning a lovely quote about brother branham speaking about john i should include it because i'm going to speak it now and just butcher it but uh how that john raised up in in this position of god and then he comes back down now god used him for this incredible ministry and then he comes back down and brother brown uses this word he laid aside those great big wings and he finds himself in prison sending a a servant or a brother out are you the one now jesus doesn't rebuke it and say oh he he lost it he says no this in this quote he puts it this way you just sit here in this meeting you see the supernatural then you take the testimony back to him and he'll know amen look what god's done for us my brother sister how many times have we come to a place in our life that we are like well am i part of the bride is this right i have a friend or a family member that's quit and they're telling me this is this is this is that and that's there and you're deceived and oh what do i do but then god comes and he puts someone back in our life maybe it's a sermon that's preached maybe it's a friend with encouragement or a scripture that is read whatever it might be and it reminds us and we can go then and pick those wings back up and go up into heavenly places oh satan would desire to keep us grounded amen you know there's more when brother branham shares these little stories people are like oh okay that was a cute little story well i'll tell you what my brother and sister i would definitely was an eagle in a chicken yard amen and i heard a call i know what that is it's not just a little story and i thank the lord now this might seem silly to you but i thank the lord because he didn't say now when that eaglet heard that cry he jumped in the heavens and flew off no sir he gave me hope because all i could do is make it to the top of the post but from the top of the post i had broken the bonds of gravity in the chicken yard and then it was there i realized i actually can these are here for purpose they're they're not now let me put it back in the human realm they're not to be put in our pocket they're not to be like uh yeah oh somebody praise the lord amen no sir these were given to us set free for a reason that we could lift our wings as it were praise the lord now look how it is he that eateth bread with me half lifted up his heel against me now brother branham says the apostles had no idea what jesus was talking about something was taking place in their midst and they were not revelated to understand it at that time amen now i tell you before it come that when it is come to pass you may believe that i am he verily verily i say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me he that receiveth me receiveth him that send me low i tell you what you talk about a strong bond god has given us by saying amen to the word and being able to believe when jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit and testified and said verily verily i say to you that one of you shall betray me now my brother and sister this i believe would have come as a shock to the apostles they would have been sitting there and saying whoa what what what are you talking about betrayal you're what are you talking about because my brother and sister we'll touch on that in a minute you see there had been an atmosphere that had been around them and you know we all kind of tend to scrutinize one another don't we that's why god doesn't want a spirit of criticism or judgmental spirit in the church because you know my flaws and i know yours and sometimes i know yours because something just reveals it i don't have a clue you're not going to find brother paul peeking in your family room window but god wants these things to be dealt with in the body right he doesn't want us to become liberal christians that hey you know we we've been predestinated so therefore we god will give us a pass on this my brother and sister our god's a holy god he's a righteous god he wants us to line up with his word his word is that perfect example as it would be a young man is saying you know if i ever get married this is the kind of wife i would like to have and it's vice versa for young ladies you know my brother and sister it's only out of desperation we would settle for something less than what god ordained for us and so the bride of christ is not going to come to a place that we settle for something because we decide the word is unattainable the word is attainable oh and we'll get into that i'm getting excited excuse me here if i bounce around a little this morning he said now the disciples looked on one another is it you you you who is it well i hope if we ever come face to face with that which we actually do that we'll go find the mirror of the word and not say is it you but say lord is it i am amen they looked on one another doubting look at this saints do you see this doubting of whom he spake in other words they had such a feeling of confidence in their midst that when they looked around they said it wouldn't be him it wouldn't be him it wouldn't be him with him and they actually were doubting the very words of our lord jesus christ because they couldn't imagine anyone would quit the message after 10 15 20 30 40 years you said who no way no way i just heard him preach such a powerful sermon just a month or two ago i doubt that can be true now there was leaning on jesus bosom one of his disciples whom jesus loved simon peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake he then lying on jesus breath saith unto him lord who is it jesus answered and said he it is to whom i shall give soup and when i have dipped it and when he had dipped the salt he gave it to judas iscariot the son of simon now i want to i want you to catch this i hope you catch this this morning this powerful moment of time that just a few minutes ago no one would have believed that judas would have betrayed jesus but in this powerful moment of time that it is when he dipped the sap he gave it to judas iscariot the son of simon and after the sop satan entered into him but i'm here to put it in this context to you this morning my brother and sister satan knows well and good that he cannot come up against a son or daughter of god and overpower them there has to be as it were a season of preparation there has to be a tilling of the soil of the soul to make it able to receive we see how god worked in our life sometimes he has to almost grind us stubborn ones amen somebody will say amen to that grind us down and that is the preparation of the field and others it's just a stirring in the soul and we see but god said i'm not going to judge you by how much grinding i had to do i'm not going to judge you by these other factors i'm going to judge you because my word predestinated it's you and i will do whatever it takes for you to come he gave it to judas this carried the son of simon after the satan entered into him then said jesus unto him that thou doest do it quickly now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him see they are still in a condition of you might say a a a uh oh wow the word just escaped me they're naive they're naive i had another kind of sophisticated sounding word but it got away from me but uh they're they're in this this state you know they're kind of like looking through a fog they're like what what is he talking about i can't see what he's what he's talking about because they still really don't catch the fact that in that moment now god could have initiated this moment my brother and sister any way please but that's the way he pleased and god could initiate my brother and sister any way he pleased in this generation but it is the way he pleased men come and say we don't need this and we don't need this and this is off base and these people that believe the message of william branham i'm sorry i don't know anyone personally who believes the message of william branham but i do know a lot of people who believe the message of jesus christ amen because it was never brother branham's message in the beginning amen that's just what the word says saints never was his message in the beginning and it will never be as it were his message now is he responsible for the correct delivery of it just the same as the ministry in this church or any ministry is responsible for the correct delivery of it but it's not our message it's god's message it's always been his message and will always be his message amen so as we look at this we see now my brother and sister is this comes to pass we see how that the scripture must come now to interact as it is that uh satan entered into him i should have just put this on the screen because there's quite a bit of reading but i think you'll find this is a novel fact here now incarnate is having a human body invested with bodily and especially human nature and form now see how god is coming down my brother and sister not only god but the devil he didn't just come to uh uh enter into and turn it into something ugly you know we live in the world they make all these creepy movies and they got all kinds of monsters on the earth but i'm sorry satan's much more subtle than that he entered in can you say amen he entered in he didn't turn into some kind of monster it was still judas it was still judas that everybody knew and everybody had prayed for and everybody had lived with and everybody had went and held special meetings and preached with him and saw a powerful ministry and this is why they were shook up because they said how could this be how could he be the betrayer i heard him preach this over here and people come to the altar and i've seen this and i've seen this but you see my brother and sister god knew that there was coming a season and in that it brother branham shows us very clearly how it was there that this ministry was imparted from jesus christ himself to judas that's right so he wasn't even in a way what you'd call an imposter it was a real deal until he got to a certain place and at a certain place in time certain things happened invested with bottling especially human nature and form made manifest or comprehensible let's go on now some of you will actually understand what the dictionary is talking about here amen you know adjectives transitive verbs an english teacher high school she says paul i'm going to pass you i said thank you very much mrs gurkey she said well don't thank me so much is i just don't want to have to deal with you again so you know adjectives diagram of sentence all this kind of stuff i thought yep the prophet god said that they'd hide it from the wise and the prudent and i believe this kind of stuff is what he was talking about but you look at that now let's come down here all joking aside into incarnate used as a transitive verb and look at this to make incarnate as or to give bodily form and substance to and this is webster not only online is it but the lovely gift i was given of those big huge dictionaries get this even webster believes in the devil even webster believes in serpent seed to give bodily form and substance to incarnates the devil as a serpent wow hallelujah all the religious people say that's other nonsense and here's webster saying yep nope the devil went down right into a serpent i wonder if the theologians they probably use the new online american version hallelujah now look what happened here saints judas opened the door to those spirits there come a time in judas's life now we know that the word must be fulfilled but there come a time in judas's life that he had come to a point that he started to hedge and pull back and it was there that he was like well i don't know about this and i'm not sure about this and i just don't see how this could be and the door is now being opened up one was just a simply unlocking another's a turning of the knob another's a nudge here and the door is being opened up for this time and so just as this scripture declared about judas my brother and sister i want to i want you to catch this tie to the opening up amen about how we receive and what we receive the opening up right just as the scripture declared a judas amen the scripture declares a rahab the scripture declares an esther this scripture declares a bride in this day that will be true to her vow oh just as said judas is there allowing the door to be opened up to those spirits there is a bride on the earth today that is allowing the door to be opened up to the holy ghost to come in and though it seems impossible it seems too hard that that spirit upon us and we are there you know when brother branham said a real believer will say amen to every word of god he wasn't just talking about form and formality amen amen amen i don't know what he's talking about not sure i believe what he talked about amen i fulfilled that no my brother and sister down in the heart and soul of the real believer there's something compelling them to say it's hard lord but i say amen to the word i claim this word for my hour and in that place my brother and sister the door is opened to spirits every one of us has been possessed by one amen and unfortunately sometimes we see in life people that we thought had one end up having another you see this brine because as the scripture declared there the scripture must be fulfilled there must be a bride aren't you glad aren't you glad it's not even up to me it's not even up to you there's something inside there's been times saints i have preached and repented in the pulpit and you probably didn't even know why because as we're preaching a thought the word strikes my heart and says i'm talking to you paul you think i'm talking to them but i'm talking to you and there it is by the word of god god compelling us see now in the seven church ages here we'll look here now brother branham lays this out very clearly let me show you what i've been trying to teach all along about the two vines which come from the two different spirits take the example of jesus and judas this time jesus was the son of god judas was the son of perdition god entered into jesus satan entered into judas jesus had a full holy ghost ministry for how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him acts 10 38 it says for he judas was numbered with us and obtained part of this ministry so he wasn't there my brother and sister as a total imposter you see there was a time in judas's ministry that judas would have said i believe every drop of this but something entered in so subtle i'll use a little farming analogy if you don't mind giant amaranth which is a plant that looks like pigweed and most of you probably don't know what pigweed looks like but giant amarath will produce 140 one plant 140 000 viable seeds and when introduced into a field in four years will completely take that field over you follow me introduced and within a period of time has completely taken it over so we see how that satan he's not going to come as a frontal attack to you because you're going to back up and say hey no i'm not doing that but he comes so subtle he comes and slips his way in and start planting his seeds and as more time is given to him the more seeds he will plant which means saints i'll just put it in common terms the more you're going to have to do to get that out of your life that's why the word of god the prophet the word of god anointed the prophet to preach to us repent every single day weed the garden every single day therefore you don't have to fight and say well it's impossible now but you can just stand and say by god's grace i'm here today amen he went doing good he was numbered with us and obtained obtained part of this ministry acts 1 17 matthew 10 1 and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits now you didn't see jesus say now i'm going to give power to unclean spirits but i know that judas is going to betray me so i'll limit his no sir he had this full authority of the word up to this time but it shows you that a man even under full authority now i'll put at this blunt i made the comment earlier you can have men preaching sermons that bring people to the altars to a true repentance and they themselves can go no further it's kind of scary it's actually very scary to see how this works he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out in the hello manner of sickness and all manner of disease that spirit that was in judas went right along through the ministry of jesus they both come to the cross jesus was hanged upon a cross gladly giving his life for sinners and commended his spirit to god his spirit went to god then was poured out into the church at pentecost but judas hanged himself and his spirit went back to satan but after pentecost that same spirit that was in judas came back to the false vine imagine my brother and sister that spirit is here today now we're not going to run around the world to people we would disagree or we'd feel it might apply and say you've got a spirit of judas on you these things have to be manifested the word of god says let it be manifested we're not here to judge it and cut it short amen we're here to let the word of god be manifested amen so you look at this uh come back to the false vine grows right along with the true vine but notice judah's spirit never got to pentecost now i want you to catch these things and never went up to receive the holy spirit sometimes starting with our children i want them to catch this we sit back and act like if god wants me to have it he'll give it to me god wants me to have a family he'll give it to me god and in one sense that's right that do you see we have to play our part we have to put our effort in judas never sought the holy ghost brother brown never once brings up that he sought it and never found it he never sought it he had a form of godliness but denied the full power thereof of the holy ghost and so it's in that realm he never actually comes and when it come into the crux of the whole moment my brother and sister there was a void there and that void would be full and uh would be filled and so uh it's there so what's brother brahms say here never went up to receive the holy spirit it could not but what did jesus spirit go for it went for the bag of gold how it love money it still loves money if it goes about in the name of jesus doing mighty things and holding great meetings it still makes more of money and buildings in education everything with a material concept just watch that spirit that is upon them and don't be fooled jesus so he said that spirits here today let's look out here amen some of these ministries that are around the world you know got three litter jets working on number four because none of the rest were the best and they believe that prosperity is godliness judas went about as one of the twelve and he did miracles too i want you to catch this line but he did not have the spirit of god as his own amen he had a religious spirit he had a spirit if you don't mind me i don't mean to be rude but he had a spirit that could literally say hey god has sent a prophet in this generation that's exactly right but you see that acknowledgment is not the holy ghost let's not offer up an alternative to the baptism of the holy ghost it is not something we recite it's a life so he says right there he did not have the spirit of god now he recognized the spirit of god he knew what the moving of the spirit of god can you say amen we know when god comes down and moves in our midst saints we are not oblivious we know when the presence of god is in this building amen and so he knew that side of it but he didn't know it as his own it was though he was there and he would be able to say something special something supernatural is happening right now but it isn't my brother and sister that it's happening it needs to be happening to us not even to us in us amen he says in that way right now in this synagogue of satan right he was not a true child of god oh let me get back i lost my place he did not ha he did have a ministry he never got to pentecost as he was not true seed he was not a true child of god no sir and it is that way right now in the synagogue of satan don't be fooled you won't be fooled if you are the very elect jesus said you can someone say amen you would not be fooled amen don't go around saying oh my i've gotta just i've gotta guard myself look there's a spirit in the land saying well you know we just got to be careful because we don't want anyone else contaminating this message and so we've got to guard this message i'm sorry that's what the holy ghost is for this true bride of christ filled with the holy ghost you can listen to any kind of preacher amen i preached in churches they believed the thunders and god was there south america and we're talking die hard thunder people and i don't take one drop of credit for this but i do know sister jerry and i was there die hard thunder people and when i first come to the pope say a few words have you guys ever been around thunders churches they jump up out of their chair and the whole church runs up in front of the pulpit and they're up here it's like and they're all like he's not shouting over us no i'm not going to that's not the message of the hour but when we were done preaching there because of the power of god the pastor himself come back to the minister that was kind of brought us there in a few short weeks after that time he called him up and said i've been wrong i've been wrong god forgive me now this is a true repentance he went to every single church and ministry and whatever that he had shunned through the years and repented in their pulpits before them in public you know what caused him to realize he was wrong special ministry no preaching of the word and there was a seed down inside of him but you realize as much as having their pastor say i've been teaching you wrong for nine years there are many of them split the church many of them said we like we like believing that our dancing our shouting our screaming is the evidence of the holy ghost we like that you see actually how shallow that is because anybody can jump and shout and scream anybody can rush from the back to the pulpit and jump up and down for 45 minutes anybody can do that but it takes a real life yeah i know it just went through my sister jerry's mind she's like my husband's lost it because i was standing on the chairs in the front row of the church preaching to them but you know what i got in the spirit of the moment amen but you see jesus said you wouldn't be fooled so no amount of jumping shouting emotions none of that is going to take a true believer and draw them away oh some of us could use a little bit more some of us could actually you know have a little inspiration in church amen hallelujah now look at this i i lord forgive me for that i shouldn't say that we are all individuals and as god moves upon you amen i don't mean to say that it's just as the brother told me once he goes you know brother paul he said i found myself preaching about you know get your hands lifted up i want to hear a loud shout i want to hear an amen and he said i just realized you know that just helped me as an old man get excited about preaching but it didn't change the condition of the church and so he himself was like yeah they're saying amen preach it but it didn't change the church and finally he just let the people settle back down to where they was at and amen just preach something that would change the church hallelujah oh my you see we look at this my brother and sister and we realize how beautiful jesus said you wouldn't be fooled now that's something you know i i was not that long ago told by somebody that that was arrogant for me to preach from this pulpit that there was no way on earth we could be fooled they were like you know you can be deceived you can be deceived and i said no that's that's not right that's not what the word said the word said the devil's going to try and and through his vessels of men or ministry is going to try to deceive but it's not possible now if my god said it's not possible i'm not going to sit around fretting that it might happen amen and when he said all things are possible talking about the gospel and i'm going to sit here and say i have full confidence if i have a need you have a need god needs to speak it's going to happen amen i don't have to worry about is there going to be a church in nampa idaho on midland boulevard that's going to have the holy ghost the word says it's going to happen and i believe it's gonna happen amen we don't have to manufacture that we don't have to try to bring that about we don't have to do some kind of special thing now look it does seem striking to see a spirit become incarnate in one who was so close to the truth i want you to think about this so close to the truth walked with him supped with him heard him share the gospel it just it just strikes it but but you see god through these words was not only fulfilling the scripture of that day he was preparing us for our day he was preparing us for the time that we live in that we're not going to look and judge everything because this person's close to this person this person's best friends with this they've traveled they've been all around the world my brother and sister we have one relationship that matters and that is the relationship with our lord jesus christ and when we have that relationship satan can pry i just was in a business the other day as i'm walking up to open the door i looked at their door and almost from top to bottom you can tell somebody has put a crowbar on the door of this business and tried to pry it open they have ripped the metal separated the face of the metal all up and down the jamb and i made a comment and they said yeah they tried but they couldn't do it now don't think that when the word declared that you would not be deceived don't think the devil's not going to try he's going to pry on the door to your spirit he's going to pry on the door of your family he's going to beat on it he's going to try everything he can do but the word said he couldn't do it hallelujah so we sit back and say well why am i having this trial why is this happening the lord said yeah he said the devil wouldn't get the door open it didn't say he wouldn't try hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now look here so the spirit become incarnate and one that was so close but you see now i'm going to take this back prophet of god said the true believer will say amen to every word of god now some of us are quiet worshipers i say this in all seriousness may never hear a vocal above the rest of the congregation amen but down in the heart down in the heart they're saying that's the word thank you lord for the word i love the word you see what happens is we as humans we have certain things that we put in place and we judge this you know as we build our own little hierarchy we build our own little castle now let's see i'm pretty sure i'm more spiritual than sister sue definitely more spiritual than this family of that family and the prophet come with these simple words that we should put more weight to and he said you'll be surprised is there and you'll be surprised who is not there you know that should be enough right there to cause us to back up and say lord i think i'm just going to look in the mirror of the word and worry about this guy right here because after all of my conclusions a prophet just said i'll probably get it wrong anyhow so i think i'll just work on being a good christian be the best i can be and you know what it says there that prayers covers a multitude of sins and lord i know that i probably have not repented over some things i thought did so lord i'm going to pray for the saints and lift them up and i'm not doing this mechanically but lord i believe it and i just know that in my life i need you to cover everything and suddenly the whole church you heard that deal about the sister decided that she'd just start praying the thing and she got down every day faithfully heard the evangelists say you know you need to be praying every day she took that to heart she liked the evangelist she prayed every day and after a week didn't seem like much happened couple weeks about a month she started looking out there and going well praise the lord god's working on sister so-and-so oh and our pastor he's preaching much deeper now without realizing the one god was working on was her now my brother and sister there's the choice we have to make to let the invisible become visible will not be us waiting it out it will be us acting on the word of god the invisible my brother and sister the word of god shows us will remain invisible to most of the earth but that we can sit here today and say thank you lord not from arrogance not from pride not from intellectual concepts but from something deep within the soul we can say thank you lord it is visible now amen now look i i just bring this out of the fourth seal it's just a reference here don't have a quote amen and uh brother branham says here now that uh he's done it again and she won't do it he's talking about the church paragraph 258 in the fourth seal amen 630321. he said now her rejection away makes her or her rejection makes a perfect way for satan to come into her and be incarnate that's right incarnate himself right in here in her because she rejected the word see there's that opening right there that comes we pull back from the word it leaves an opening for satan to step in and once he gets the foothold my brother and sister without a divine intervention from the holy spirit she is now speaking of the church consumed by that spirit amen now i had quite a few quotes please forgive me here this morning amen no i shouldn't say that this is a word amen this is the message jesus did the works of his father because the father was in him that is why the works was done because that the father was in the sun do you believe that now i want you to really focus on this because to me this is just powerful amen do you believe that that in him he was the incarnate god now we know this from john 1 right the word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us it shouldn't be i hope you know i've been on my heart we might just go back and preach godhead again my brother sister because just running many people and they have misconceptions misunderstandings about the godhead and where they fit in it they might recognize that the word was made flesh and dwelt among us but they don't recognize what that really means to them amen and if we don't recognize what it really means to us then we miss the whole crux of the point amen so do you believe that that in him he was the incarnate god do you believe that i do believe that that god the father which is the father of jesus christ the great spirit dwelt in the fullness of his power in jesus christ which was the tabernacle of god made flesh and dwelt on earth representing the word jesus was the word can we say amen the bible said so saint john first chapter and the word was invisible you see there's much more than in the beginning was the word and the fact that the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the invisible god is now made visible that's right amen my oh my oh my saints hallelujah oh i could go off on a tangent here but let me let me just stay and the word was invisible now listen close the word was invisible until it was made flesh and then the word become visible and through his sacrificial death at calvary his resurrection positionally that's right amen that's right amen you know some of them brothers brother andrew man i tell you what it's like lord if i ever was going to dance in church because i'd dance like brother andrew but i can't his resurrection positionally placed his church in that realm amen amen amen absolutely oh that was for jesus christ that was for brother branham no it was for us hallelujah amen look at this my brother and sister how precious this is the word was invisible until god manifested it through you and brought it alive and we who were dead in sin and trespassed have walked in the light now and we recognize in that light i am a peace a portion a dna a son a daughter of almighty god i'm not just a christian trying to live a life i am a part of him oh and when we become a part of him we don't have to worry about making a rapture when he calls his word home he calls his body home we are part of that body oh hallelujah amen forgive me for yelling i just i couldn't yell this morning sister jerry was still sleeping amen hallelujah he positionally placed his church that's you and i the same invisible god could come into the individual now if brother branham had limited that to jesus christ he'd have said so if he had limited to the prophets he would have said so but he gave that promise to you when i to take a hold of that and say i might not feel like it yesterday i might not have felt like it before this day is over i might not feel like it but one thing i know that the word has been made visible in my life oh hallelujah amen that same invisible god coming to the individual and make the word visible now i don't want to be a downer what is that debbie downer i don't want to be debbie downer for you he coming to the individual i can tell you we won't even ask sister jerry her opinion on it but i can tell you this flesh doesn't always look like the word made manifest but by supernatural authority the word i hope you're with me now the word look look at all these comics and all this garbage they got people who look through walls and they do this and you know all of a sudden they rip their coat off or whatever and their superman spider-man this man or that man and whatever you realize all that is just an impersonation of the word of god amen that when you get beyond the outer layer oh there's somebody powerful in there there's somebody supernatural in there there's somebody that is almighty god incarnated it so once again it is not my brother and sister this flesh you notice i said those words on purpose it's the soul it's not this flesh this flesh is not the incarnate of god but it's this soul that is the incarnate of god it is his soul that is all-powerful and cannot be deceived it is his soul that can claim healing and claim lost loved ones and claim the holy ghost whoa hallelujah look he's saying oh brother paul that's nice that's nice you're preaching good brother paul that's good amen could come into the individual and make the word visible look what brother brown says right here i wish my church could get that do you realize how blessed we are oh come on i don't mean to be controversial and i'm telling you right now if i had a choice to be sitting in the tabernacle in the 60s or be right here right now i have no doubt what i would choose no doubt what i would choose because you see that seed that was planted through that ministry had to come to fruition hallelujah we saw the seed and the glory of the seed that was planted but i love oh i love the harvest and we are the matured word coming into the harvest oh yes if you could see friends the invisible god made visible i tell you what you pray for me i'll pray for you i want to be so prayed through so prayed up that when i look at you all i see is christ and you say well you know if you guys will straighten up if you guys will live a higher life if you guys will do this if you guys will do that no it's up to me because if i am prayed up if i'm filled with the holy ghost your faults your flaws your shortcoming will disappear because i will see the invisible made visible in my midst too many times we're looking for someone else to raise to a standard but it's usually our standard amen it's usually what we think they ought to be are we doing okay okay praise the lord because i i wasn't going to preach very long i was going to be noon today and the clocks i don't know if it's magnetic force or something the clocks are messed up now look at this brother branham speaking on this the invisible god made invisible and now we're going to just come right along and look in the comforter there it is how long is he going to abide forever then what is the word of god that's it amen look at the world we have today neurotics everywhere people concerned uh nervous got problems marriages childre children raring all these things are just all in turmoil and it's like people are like oh i can't find any peace there's no peace in our home well let's just go to the prophet and see what the prophet of god said was where we find comfort let's see what the prophet of god said or what our comfort is today it's when we receive the baptism of the holy ghost amen you see we can't give as humans uh you can't give comfort to someone else in the sense the prophet is talking here we can comfort one another loss of a loved one loss of parent et cetera et cetera and you look at that and we can give comfort that is actually just filial comfort but that felio comfort has a season has an expiration date sister jerry and i doing a little grocery shopping yesterday and uh while we are not trying to turn into preppers or anything like that we have got tired of kind of living you know day to day so to speak grocery shopping and we're kind of filling up the pantry and we have a little space now that we didn't used to have and you know it's good right if the power goes out i mean if the power goes out we all have to rush to brother jason's sister emmy's house eat the ice cream before it melts but that won't do us very long beyond that so what do we have for comfort there now we've been looking my brother and sister that's storing our little pantry out in the garage those have been their little pantry looks like such a jerry come across a novel idea we ought to look at how long this is going to be before it expires oh look at this here this would be great if the power went out oh three months from now it's considered no good you know they even put expiration dates on canned food oh this is only good for six months let's look here forever what the prophet of god said now he put an expiration date on god didn't he some of you are shaking your head no but actually he did it's very much marked this is good forever he marked it for us saints he put an expiration date on the word of god good forever amen so if we receive the baptism of the holy ghost the power of god living in us then we have something that has no expiration date amen and that with the word of the living god we stand that word is made flesh and dwelt among us now that same word that was made flesh and dwelt among us has become our flesh look at this my brother and sister i can stand this morning and tell you in portion let's get this correct let's not lose our balance here in portion i am the incarnate god living here now amen we're not going to come and have some prophecy of this prophecy of that and we're infallible none of that nonsense we keep our balance but recognize that we have become the incarnate god in flesh in this generation the life of christ lived out hallelujah you know there's people around this beautiful message that would argue the socks off of you until you showed them this quote amen that's right i'm sorry they don't see it that way they still see us as sinners saved by grace oh wait some of you looked at me like that's what we are but you understand that god took us a step further that's right we recognize who we where we come from i am the son of david and geraldine haley take my ancestry going right on back my brother and sister i can focus on that i can focus on the mistakes i made or i can focus on the word that said before the foundation of the world before the foundation of the world paul i put you in this position put your name in there amen before the foundation of the world right amen that same word was made flesh that same word dwells in the church and you have to take this in context because the church is you amen don't think about four walls a roof therefore if we don't compromise that word we stay right with it if we don't compromise it that same word living in you will produce the same thing that it did when it was made flesh because your flesh holds it is that beautiful i hope it's encouraging to you amen we see the clear picture of where judas was at but satan deceived him because actually the very thing you can find this in the message i don't have it right here to give you but the very thing brother branham said now eve was looking how does that go jerry eve was looking for something more or new new and satan made sure she found it i'm not looking for something new i'm looking for what i was already promised to be what you were already promised to be we're not looking for something different amen satan won't deceive you and get you to run out after something because you recognize who you are in jesus christ amen and when we realize my brother and sister that god made us the bride of christ in such a fashion that this word living in us has to we couldn't i don't mean to change the prophet's words but we could change that and not be out of contact it has to hallelujah it has to produce the same thing it not it might or it could it's a remote possibility but the word said it has to produce this same thing you did when it was made flesh because your flesh in the flesh you could let me just speak to the carnal man for a moment in your flesh you could come to the place you'd be anointed to say if god's in me where is he at come on you know how it is driving to church out of the blue i'll just use sister jerry and i this may or may not represent a true story driving to church wife you remember 11 days 3 hours 46 seconds ago you said this i did you did honey we're on the way to church i don't care i just remembered i don't mind and then it just these imaginary people temperature in the car [Music] get to church walk inside meet the deacon at the door god bless you that couldn't possibly be the word made flesh could it but i'm here to tell you it is the devil anointing doing his very best because he says man if i don't do this now they'll get in the house of god and their soul will just get a little more liberated than it was yesterday and i'm already afraid of them so what does he do he anoints flesh leave the flesh at the door so to speak come in because we're hungering we're thirsting after righteousness because it's the soul god's feeding not the flesh amen the invisible has been made visible amen hallelujah hallelujah look my brother and sister the word's not getting any weaker the word is getting more powerful and if you think about this oh some people would almost call it blasphemy but if you think about how powerful the word was when the prophet was standing on the word of god think about how powerful the maturity of the word is this bride coming into her rightful position is not going to set back as a weakling she's not going to sit back as woe unto me now we do that don't we not you but people like you they do that but let's break that let's break that because the word is becoming more powerful what it is my brother and sister as you get our sister is a doctor she knows about these things you get a little infection it doesn't just you do nothing about it it doesn't just stay in your finger no sir it spreads it works its way right up through the system and oh i hope you catch this analogy it works it's all the way up to the heart well praise the lord the lord has come and he has infected you with his word and it has worked its way through us worked its way through our temper tantrums it's worked its way through every aspect of our life and it come down here now into the resting place of the heart of the soul and now we are there in satan saying you're not a believer you're not this you're not that and you can say yes i know i am because i have been there this is my testimony this is my experience sister amy would you come please musicians hallelujah amen this word is not getting weaker saints and neither shall the bride because she is the word made flesh in this generation hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh thank you lord um thank you lord where would we be saints where would we be if it wasn't for god's grace in this generation amen well we'd have a lot of options you know might have been catholic might have been mormon might have been nazarene might have been methodist so that was a journey our parents and grandparents etc took throw in bible missionary from my grandma [Music] but god said you know what i'm leading you you my chosen amen i won't go back and take you back to that verse right but he said i know who i've chosen amen so he says you know what i don't care what the roots of the family are i've chose you and i brought you into this state of holy matrimony my brother and sister this closing remark people are looking for a marriage ceremony [Music] now this is you know complicated for some folks but you see the scripture shows us so clearly the vow is where the obligation lies [Music] it's not the tuxedo the nice dress well-decorated church it's in the bow do you realize saints the marriage is already taking place there's a people in the land today that are making the vow i will serve you lord i will love you wherever thou goest i will go your people that little bride of christ will be my people my heart rejoices when i think about that brothers and sisters that i get to claim oh i know some of you might be sad or a little alarmed at this but i get to claim you as my family i get to claim you of that royal dna you know it's interesting what dna does [Music] i don't know if i trust this stuff in the natural the dna in the natural says that back in my family's bloodline [Music] is rosa parks the lady who sit on the bus and caused a disturbance and sister jerry blamed it and said that's why your family acts like they do but you see that dna doesn't matter to me because i can track a dna that has been made visible to me i can see who i am in jesus christ that is what matters to me hallelujah oh your family from here and your families from there and your family this and your family that none of that matters i know who my family is i know in whom i have believed hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah satan help me brother jay satan like a roaring lion amen i think that's greater is he that's in yeah amen let's just stand worship the lord for a minute or two before we go watch a glorious event in our sister daniela's life amen our sister donna making that commitment unrelenting to speak to her dad i want to be baptized that's what we like to see that never give up approach amen [Music] the bible tells me souls [Music] god has given us today his overcoming power greater is he that is in me the greater is he that is in me greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world on the day of pentecost a rushing fighting wind blew into the upper room and baptized all [Music] i'm so glad i've got it too i'm gonna let the whole world know oh greater is he that is in me the greater is he that is [Music] and i'm so glad i've got it too i'm gonna let the whole world know oh greater is he that is in me greater is he that is in me greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world hallelujah i just want to reiterate to you i skipped over a couple things but i just want to reiterate [Music] the word incarnate is just as valuable to a believer as it was destructive to the unbelief hallelujah don't let the devil say well well i don't know about this you see my brother and sister unless the very life and spirit of christ comes down and dwells inside here we're just another denomination but when that power comes down and dwells inside of here we become that living word hallelujah predestinated for this generation now remember the prophet messenger come aren't we glad but do you realize oh my there are several quotes they fit together hand in glove but do you realize by the prophet's own words he said there'll come a day that i'll be gone from the scene that'll hand this off hallelujah saints think about it and there was a bride waiting there just as it would be like the relay racer we're waiting there oh here comes the word thank you lord the life of the word and it's handed to us and we run our race and if the lord tarries we'll hand it off and even if he doesn't we have the privilege to hand it to friends loved ones sons daughters husbands wives look how beautiful this that the word would remain visible this is a whole other portion brother david brought chris you don't get a tie and tear into this okay i have staked this i don't know about that but my brother and sister this visible word has to remain visible to the next generation you see if we fail we fall down we come short if we don't feel worthy i want you to think about all the things that satan tells you if we listen to him then this will not be carried to another generation if we become a denomination the living word will not be made visible to another generation you see how important it is that you and i look at the word recognize the word claim the word and proclaim the word because then our children will actually say i think i'm going to get baptized i think i'm going to serve the lord now why are you going to do this i've heard this many times because i see christ in my mother and my father i see christ in my grandmother my grandfather i see christ in those in our church i see christ in the pulpit what if they saw something different satan would be right there to say say it's just an age old thing you don't have to do this but the word has been made visible and i say thank you thank you lord hallelujah hallelujah i get excited saints amen hallelujah there's power power wonder working power amen there is [Music] in the precious how would you be free from the burden of sin there's power in the blood [Music] there's wonderful power in the blood [Music] is [Music] blood of the lamb oh would you be free from your passion and pride there's power in the blood [Music] yes there is [Music] hallelujah [Music] stains are lost in its life-giving [Music] of the land yes would you do service for jesus [Music] [Music] there is [Music] can we just give a little handclap of praise to the lord amen we are witnesses of the power of the blood and i say thank you lord thank you lord hallelujah amen let's all just dismiss go downstairs and look forward to this wonderful moment amen as i said start a service so happy to see god steering our young people god bless you saints [Music] so [Music] supposed [Music] you
