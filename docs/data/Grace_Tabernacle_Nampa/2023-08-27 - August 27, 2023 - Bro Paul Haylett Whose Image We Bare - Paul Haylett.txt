hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen if you would be seated for just a moment just have a couple things I don't like to break the continuity of things but we do have a few things to to share I forgot to mention to brother Isaac that brother Stan and sister Merlene will be leaving this next week to the Philippines and they definitely desire your prayers amen we also want to remember brother Chris uh is in Alaska I think for a week or so be there in Anchorage and also out in the village I believe it's just chac but until you've been to chac you can't even understand what it means when somebody says I've been to chac amen I tell you it it's just you know kind of third world country in America and um you know uh certainly the Saints God's doing a wonderful work there and so we want to remember them also uh we want to greet Uncle Allen and Aunt Ruth H that's how my grandchildren identify them God bless you brother Allan sister Ruth we're happy to see you here as you come to visit family amen brother ole sister Elena amen God bless you you have way too many kids for my memory to name them but I say God bless you to each one of you children amen don't look at me like I've got something out of my ear amen come on Amen so glad to have you guys come and visit family amen and uh uh brother Paul I was missing you and your family and happy to see you here and uh God bless you and uh I always want to call him Junior but PJ amen God bless you my brother there we got our thumbs up amen I tell you my brother and sister um I just uh happy to see them now um Sunday school and young adults will start this next Sunday now my memory when I wrote this down just failed me what time did we start Sunday school and young adults 9:45 9:45 okay so that way did y all hear sister Jerry no that's good because sometimes I you know people are like you didn't say anything and I'm telling you I check up on you I go back and I listen to the service and I'm like right there it is I said it so anyway 9:45 this next Sunday uh those of you young people parents let's just do our best amen just to get get this started off right and and U uh we want to uh brother Chris is going to be gone quite a bit in the next while but uh if you young people don't mind um maybe the pastor will do its best to preach young adults you know I was one once it was quite a ways back but I I still have those memories of that so uh we want to do that and also next Sunday we'll be a little bit busy because we are going to um share the ballots to reaffirm uh we're not voting as it were for offices but we're just giving the church the opportunity to cast a vote either for or against amen and um you know uh what we want what we're really doing brother Ivan and I have had this conversation and and it is what we want is to make sure that you as a church have your voice amen we don't want to just assume that we know everything that should be good for you but you as a church so we'll reaffirm those and I want to because I don't know how it will be for people it's not going to be a vote that is counted and answered right at that moment uh so uh if um you're not here for whatever reason uh you still have your vote amen so even if it comes together um and uh I say this jokingly please don't misunderstand me if you're going to kick me out just give me at least 30 days amen so you have 30 days to count the vote so and anyway amen and next Sunday we've got a little bit out of um timing but next Sunday we will have communion and foot washing at 5:00 p.m. so kind of just a a busy schedule amen let's just stand as we'll go into the word today thank you brother Isaac brother Alex a amen and we'll we'll look at this um in the word today and I want to speak to you uh from uh the The Book of Mark the 12th chap: 13-17 on the subject of whose image do we bear amen and we will find as we look at this that uh every one of us Bears an image of some uh sort as some form you know I always found it interesting I don't say this derogatory but just very interesting to me that uh you will have grown men who in the midst of you might say identity crisis they'll go out and buy a jersey of a of a professional sports person and and um they wear that Jersey as though that somehow by wearing that Jersey they're identified with that individual and um it's there that you see the image and um I happen to have some friends that are my age that have all kinds of jerseys from all kinds of different teams and and one week they're a chief and the next week they're an Indian and uh so what you realize is in the natural there's an identity crisis they they don't really know what they are and their identity is what they put on and you might think that brother Paul is rambling but I I believe before the service is over you will catch the foundation that I'm trying to lay for you and so we want to be very cognizant of the image that we bear amen we can bear an image of indifference and some people just would think that's just the kind of person they are but my brother sister for us to Bear an image of indifference there has to be an influence of indifference somewhere and so as it is brother Isaac shared that about uh just a few people on fire for God versus all kinds of revivals now when you see somebody on fire for God and it shows my brother and sister there's been something that has been put that has influenced that image in their life that they could step out you say well I'm a quiet person my brother and sister we are not talking about our persons we're talking about the presence of Jesus Christ and so it's not just who we are in this flesh but it's who we are in Christ and so sometimes we have to just break down the barriers and Step Beyond the image that is trying to be placed upon you and we'll look at that my brother and sister in the day that we're living in amen Mark the 12th chapter verses 13-1 17 and they sent unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the herodians to catch him in his words and when they were come they say unto him Master we know that thou art true and carest for no man for thou regardest not the person of men but teachest the way of God in truth is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not not shall we give or shall we not give but he knowing their hypocrisy so in spite of all their cleverness they come to Jesus and their hypocrisy is plain said unto them why tempt ye me bring me a penny that I may see it and they brought it and he saith unto them who's is is this image and this subscription and they said unto him Caesars and Jesus answered and said unto them render to Caesar the things that are Caesars and to God the things that are gods and they Marvel at the word that's right right do you mind that I just changed that it because he was the word so they were marveling at a man that they still didn't believe cuz if they believed he was the Christ Christ they would had a different attitude they're looking at just a man amen now let me read that correctly Jesus answered and said unto them render to Caesar the things that are Caesars and to God the things that are gods and they marveled at him Heavenly Father we ask you to bless this time this morning as we come together as Sons and Daughters of God just Desiring father to be be pulled Closer to You Lord to magnetized by the word of God father and we just ask you to come and deal kindly with each and every heart Lord every need that is in this body father Lord there are no visitors here today are we are one family of God and Father we ask you now to speak and set everything aside bind every contrary Spirit every distraction in the name of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah God bless you you may be seated as we look at this my brother and sister we'll just take a glimpse at verse 13 they sent unto him certain of the Pharisees and herodians to catch him in his words and they were faultfinders is all they were they actually had come into this church service just simply to find something they could criticize and I'm telling you this morning not that I believe there's any critics here but I'm telling you you can't go anywhere even amongst the very body of the Bride of Jesus Christ and you look and if you want to you will find something to criticize amen and that's the beauty of it because you see God is not making us perfect in our words in our intelligence and in our appearance and all of these things he making us perfect in the maturity of the word in our life amen because I tell you what you know uh I say this I'm not tossing j under the B but you know she she now usually if she's not going to be here which isn't often but you know she like lays out my clothes because one time quite a few years ago she went out of town and you know she must have watched the service online or something and she's like I can't believe you wore that with that and so you know my brother and sisters some of us just don't have any more sense well that's what they call it fashion sense but I'll tell you what we do have we have another sense that this world doesn't have and we recognize the clothing of the word of God how that God has come to wrap his word around you and I to bring us into a fellowship that the world says it's not necessary that the word says oh the God doesn't care about that anymore but God's revealed to this bride what God does care about and is clothing her with the word and it's not mismatched it's not out of place it's not not color blinding and whatever it might be my brother and sister it is the word of God it is the life that is in the word coming and matching the need that is in you and I can someone say thank you Lord amen because without that need we would just wander around and we'll touch on this so let me just move on Amen but they were there to to uh catch him in his words they were not trying to catch him amen they weren't trying to catch him a as the son of God as the Redeemer my brother and sister they were just trying to catch him in his words they were hoping that he would trap himself you know they were actually afraid of all of those around them because God had been dealing with these people and speaking in such a fashion so they have to be clever my brother and sister the day it comes that we have now somebody I had somebody tell me one time well brother Paul you maybe are just a little too transparent a little too this well I'll tell you what would you rather I be too transparent or would you rather I'd be a little clever I think I'll stick with transparent because I want to I just want to I just want it to be Christ amen I don't want it to be Paul I don't want it to be me thinking of a way to present it in such a fashion that people for years to come would say oh wasn't that such a lovely statement that's not what I care about my brother and sister I care about that we are clothed upon with the word of God with the very Life of Christ that not be what we are clothed upon amen and so it is here that we look this while they're trying to catch him in his words amen not trying to be caught of him amen we want to be caught of him amen if we'll turn in Philippians the thir chapter I want to just plow on this morning I realized as I was studying and finishing up my thought this morning that that I just have way too much here amen and anybody come to the grace smorgus board this this morning amen let's just keep going back to the table eat as much much as you want but don't push your table your chair back and leave okay just sit back and enjoy yourself now in Philippians uh the third chapter uh 11th verse we'll see uh here it is now if by any means I might attain into the resurrection of the Dead you know if we're going to attain my brother and sister that is interchangeable with achieve so if we're going to to uh come we we by any means I might achieve now when we say this we have to take it in the context of the word that was being brought because remember crawling in through the window is not achieving amen so we can't say well I made it into the marriage Feast because you see they will recognize that you have the dirt and the cobwebs of the window upon you and not the correct robe amen cuz you can't pass through the door God didn't just forget once you have come baptized with the Holy Ghost amen come into His his presence God does not forget to clothe you in righteousness amen you can't say but I've done all this people are today my brother and sister people look you in the face and say I have the Holy Ghost and you would look at that and I'm not judging by a man but you would say you know what something's missing and you hate to say this and it's a preacher's complex I think isn't it Brother David that we just kind of tend to look at things and say that doesn't line up with the word and if it doesn't line up with the word I'm sorry I don't really care or can't relate to what you're saying so if someone says I have the Holy Ghost they'd fight a buz saw you stop and say is that true now I'm not talking about us fighting the Flesh and sometimes the flesh getting carried away okay anybody know what I'm talking about there yeah yeah thank you for those that are H us this morning amen but look at this my brother and I'm not talking about that but I'm talking about a regular display of nature that it's easier to be mad than it is to be compassionate this is what I'm talking about God help us amen so you look at this and realize see that to be clothed on with the robe as we come into His presence correctly is a lifechanging experience amen it is obvious it becomes evident Something's Happened to this man or woman this boy or this girl amen but anyone can say I've been there millions can say I've been to the water and I've been baptized but it was not a lifechanging experience I hope I'm not going to preach too hard this morning amen but look at that they didn't come to be caught of him they come to catch him and that's not how it works amen so by any means I might attain it to the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either were already perfect these are pretty strong words when you break it down I wish we had time this morning maybe I should just scrunch this back and and just break this down but you see he's acknowledged that I know what I need and I know what God's offering but I don't always act on it I don't always have it on display I don't always move forward in that and so here is a great messenger preacher to the age saying I'm I'm not perfect I'm glad I got a prophet when I was struggling at a point in my life had a prophet that stood in the Pulpit one day and said there I was under all this pressure from the IRS and all of this stuff and the lawyers and this and that and the phone rings and the wife answers and says it's a lawyer he gets up out of a chair goes over walks out the door tell them I'm not here well come on Saints if his foot was over the threshold it's defendable but intent it was a lie how many times have we done that we have used the absolute harmonics of the fact to say yes there was more of me out the door than there was there I'm not home and defend it or how about when God can we get personal this morning I don't need your shoe size I'm not talking that personal but get personal how many times has God dealt with you and I and said you know what what you did there wasn't quite right you ought to apologize yes sir and if we would get up out of our chair right then and there either go to a telephone or go in person and brother Trevor I'd done you wrong and brother Trevor would be anointed and say brother Paul I didn't take it that way all is well but you know what I do I sit over here and I I justify it well really brother Trevor deserved that he deserved it me to try and tear his head off he deserved at me to this and this and this and this and a day goes by and a week goes by and a month goes by six months go by and the case doesn't get weaker it gets stronger that's why I I I had a a situation where somebody was saying why not talking about the church here but why do we take communion so often so you have to come face to face with yourself oh you thought it was just to satisfy the ordinance of the word no God knows you that's right God knows that sometimes he's going to twist your arm and bring you to a place I can't take communion without repenting oh I'm glad to see you guys are human like me that that's reassuring amen cuz it'd be terrible if I said that and realized I was the only one here that had that now look what God's doing here he's dealing with him now he says you know I don't count myself to uh count not myself to have apprehended but this thing one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth into those things that are before I press amen I don't casually stroll I don't just hope I make it I press to the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus so we're seeing here these uh Pharisees and herodians and all these critics they they're coming to trap Jesus what they don't realize is he knew their very thought and the intent of their heart as they stood there and he realized their heart is here as a Critic that's it they're not here to dig deeper in the word of God they're not here to to take a portion my brother and sister I tell you I have sat down at a table many times in foreign countries and looked at the food and I say this jokingly but somewhat serious and looked at the food and prayed literally Lord you send me here Lord please take me home and I ate it anyway and I can tell you my brother and sister God's faithful now if we are here in leod deia and God sent you and I here and we are living in a world that's got all kinds of things to satisfy the appetite my brother and sister God knows what you need to go back home he's not sent you here to fail to fall falter to be weak and tossed around he sent you here to be Victorious and strong and to be able to eat the meat of the word and to Rise Up from that and when Leo deia throws something before you I was just doing some studying in this another subject I'll probably come to it in another sermon but the prophet of God talking about as it was with Samson my brother and sister God looks at you and I and all he's looking for from you and I is for us to rise up in the moment of our weakness and say Lord just one more time Lord forgive me just one more time come upon me and we say well that sounds hypocritical no it isn't if it comes from the heart when it comes out of the heart God looks down says that's my son that's my daughter they're heart they may have fallen they may have struggled they may have got something on the h their garment but they're coming back and asking Lord forgive me I wasn't who I am it's not who I want to be nor will it be who I am when I finish amen so yeah we're not perfect but there's something in the heart that keeps pressing on oh we won't get that personal but I'll tell you my brother and sister when the prophet of God said we backslide daily he was preaching at me come on yeah come on he was preaching to me no I didn't rob a bank no I didn't go out and kill somebody I thought about it but you understand what I'm saying it's little things sometimes that God just deals with us why because he's bringing us into maturity Perfection amen he isn't taking it and putting us in some kind of machine that just smashes the draw out of us my brother and sister what is he doing he's rolling us I hope you follow this he's rolling us over and pounding on us rolling us over and pounding on us I tell you it'd almost be better if he just had a machine that just squish it all out at once but that's not how it works God is pounding the dross out of you and I can someone say thank you Lord amen I tell you I don't like being pounded on but I don't like the draw either in fact I dislike the draw more than I dislike the pounding and that's what keeps us coming back back to the word amen now let me get moving along here now I want you just to catch sometimes how these little things hidden in the word Little Gems that are hidden in the word that come in such a fashion worded in such a fashion like let me put it this way the devil being so subtle would come because he can't prove that your name's not in the book so he just accuses you of not living the life of someone whose name would be in the book he's got no access to the book Saints so what does he do he just comes and accuses you ah you can't be the bride you can't be the bride do this you that you did oh yeah yeah yeah yeah you can't be so he makes these accusations that causes us wait it's not even the devil my brother and sister he's just hovering like the little bird over our head trying to build the nest it's us I hope this doesn't offend you that are too lazy to knock the nest off that's right wow and some of you thought it was just somebody's little feathery hat they were to church no sorry that was a devil trying to build a nest and whisper in their ear that you couldn't possibly be the bride of Christ You couldn't possibly be you see my brother and sister what God wants us to do is get enough unction I tell you what sister ulie I'm throwing you under the bus I don't know if it even has new melin tires on it or not sorry about this sister Julia she's like what did I do ah maybe I should sa this for after the vote no you know Jerry made some comment sister y about the trampoline being broken sister Yuli is like well you know why not and why don't you just go start fixing it so next thing I know the piece of the trampoline the wind blew our trampoline against the building and twisted it and so next thing I know the piece is out of the box and um the piece is no longer even in the garage the Box no longer exists and I look out and the piece is leaning against the trampoline and the Springs are taken off of the trampoline and I'm like okay I take the hint actually what I'm doing sister ulia is very backhanded saying thank you you know something I put put off for several weeks right now took sister Jerry and I a whole and 10 minutes to fix now I've left that you're probably wondering where I'm going I've left the thinking of repairing the trampoline on the back of my mind for weeks but I didn't have enough unction to do anything about it and now I'm throwing sister Yulia back under the bus until someone else says why doesn't your husband fix this and I found myself shamed disgraced blemished but being truthful recognize yes why now I'm not saying sister ulia is a woman preacher but sometimes we need someone to speak words that move us into action forgive me sister J we need someone now was some great orator come and walk through our backyard they have said one your grass is about a foot tall I thought I saw Bingle tiger your trampoline broken what's going on here well I tell you when the spirit of do the right thing get up and do it got on me we not only fixed a trampoline yesterday we mowed a lawn we weigh eated it cut out weeds we did all this stuff and you think brother Paul this is just a weird story you're bringing out I'm telling you that when God starts to work on you he doesn't just pick the least he starts in and he starts putting this in order and this in order and this in order and this in order and I want to say this morning Lord come and put me in order Lord come and deal with my life and Lord let me take the little things I've left undone that have been on my mind you realize if it's on your mind it's robbing your peace from you if you don't deal with it or the prophet says it more strongly if you know to do it and don't do it it's iniquity and we can carry iniquity with us so easily we get used to it we just get to the idea that we think everybody's walking around with a little iniquity and and it's just normal my brother and sister it might be normal for Leo to see you but it's not normal for the bride of Christ she's got the word what she needs is some function amen just a few people with a fire of God not 40 revivals just a few people that will say I'm going to read my Bible I'm going to pray I'm going to go to church hungry I'm going to take the word of God I'm going to pray for this brother pray for this sister I'm going to apply the word and come to work to church as a mighty warrior not as a beaten down person that don't even know if he's a son or daughter of God Amen you want a Victorious Church let's take and kick out the iniquity let's kick out those things that are binding and holding us back let's do what we know we should do Hallelujah now look at this they come verse 14 we'll go back and visit it here and they come and they say unto him Master they were lying right he was not their Master but they were telling the truth because he's the master of all we know that thou art true we can say Amen but the next part is very cleverly put and car us for no man I say that is not true my brother and sister he cares for mankind more than mankind cares for himself but they're presenting it because he didn't recognize their flowing gowns and their position and all of their little kind of like the military you know those guys at that time had certain little things that they wore and it showed their position their Rank and the prophet of God said that that nickan Spirit of denominationalism is when you place one man above another so here were these nicians coming because they had their position and it was definitely higher than that position or that position and they come to Jesus and they call him Master but they look down their nose at him he was not their Master they were their own master or Satan was amen and carest for no man for thou regardest not the person of men that was true but teach us the way of God in truth that's true amen so look how they're doing that they're using the words of flattery trying to get him built up do they want to build him up to keep him lifted up no my brother and sister they weren't lifting up amen our lord Jesus they were lifting him up so when they knocked him down he had farther to fall that they could make it do but I tell you my brother and sister I don't say this just because I'm a pastor but I say this that every one of us should be this way there is no greater care for Humanity than the care for the soul amen amen there's nothing that we can say I I would do so much for you brother I would do so much for you young people so much for you sister then do something that builds their soul up amen don't don't just you know like the parents you know I tell you it's a true story I went to school with a kid that his parents man back you know we're talking way back in the 70s you guys remember them days they give this kid 50 bucks a week for an allowance man he walked around the the school like he was goldplated cuz my my parents gave me an allowance I think it was like five bucks a year my dad used to say you live in this household you're part of this household you work for this household and I thought that was normal but it's there my brother and sister when this kid went to college he never had to work never had to do nothing daddy daddy sent a check to the college daddy paid for food dadd he paid for a car he got out of college and he got married really nice girl girl with a lot of character he was so pampered that when he decided he'd rather just sit home and mess around he just push his wife go get a better job go get a better job just bring me the money a better job you know his parents ruined him and because of that behavior his life ended quite short kids I just want you to know my son called me the other day and he told me when I was growing up interesting way to hear a conversation when I was growing up my dad treated me like I was a machine and just told me I don't care what you think go out there and do it I'm thinking wow where's this going and I just called today dad you called to say thank you if God pampered you and I what kind of Christian would we be we wouldn't be that's actually in name only right a Chino that's a Christian in name only amen so you know when you fight for it do you know when my parents sorry to go into this but I want to make a point when I was a young man my dad said you know so and so was in town the other night said they saw you peeling the tires off your pickup yeah it's true dad he's like I'm sure glad you have to pay for all of that yeah I've been having so much fun if none of you ever been no I better not do that some of your kids would back on track I just want you to realize I could found different way to express that you see God cares for the soul more than he cares for anything thing so they're saying you don't you don't regard man or Humanity you don't regard nothing but he regarded the soul amen I'm sorry I got sidetracked there amen so that you see what it is that what is true care of the Soul can I make you eat it can I make you read it can I make you pray over it no I can't I'm not nickan and we're not just followers we're Christians so brother David's job my job brother Chris is not here but our job amen when we study the resume of the ages here in the next few weeks you'll see right in the resume of the ages that brother brandham indicts them Ministry for taking the Sheep into a pasture that there is no food in is that care for the soul see I might not have the best words I might not lay it out so well might not have flowing things to put to you but I tell you what I want to do I want to take you into a pasture that the grass is above your head that everything you need to be healthy is right there and if it does that the word says that he says I'm a good minister of the gospel and I want to be a good minister of the Gospel so they were looking for great flowing words and they were looking for all these outward signs just as it is today a nice house a nice car oh our church and we're blessed my brother and sister they're going straight too and it's there that they don't even recognize it because their wallet's full but God says what it is is when I take my sheep into Shady Green Pastures amen and they can lay down by the streams of flowing water and they can be comfortable there no stress and strain of am I deceived is this truth is this this is a wolf coming is a Kyo coming is a bear coming they can lay down why because the word is what is surrounding them not the preacher not the the church not mankind not man's thoughts but it's a presence of God himself and they were there strange enough to be able to say we know you don't care for man see how far they missed the mark see how far that they were off they were the ones offering all of the embellishment and all of the stuff and all of position and they accused Jesus of the one that didn't care clever old devil isn't he mhm amen so they're asking a simple thing do we give or don't give and Jesus answers the question to them and he says you know uh whose image or superscription that's upon this and they s un him Caesars and he says render to Caesar the things that are Caesars I know message men that do everything they can Shifty Shady everything not to pay a tax yes sir I'd like you to reconcile this you see we're not here to defraud the government Jesus said you give to Caesar what is Caesars but you make sure you give to God that's right what is God's and when we catch that Revelation my brother and sister I tell you I'm a businessman I'm not overly proud to make a boast of that but I'll tell you if you will follow the word you will have more money than you would if you try to work it under the table I'll tell you I've been on both sides of this equation I I can speak from truth and I can give you just the exact right down to the uh asphalt of how it works my brother and sister but you start to follow what you should do and obey the word of God and give to Caesars what is Caesars and God will fill up those Pockets that had holes in them he'll sew them up and he'll fill them up amen but as long as we're going on our own reasoning we're going in our own little idea if they don't know what they don't know won't audit me God's the one that's the auditor you ought to be concerned about not the Internal Revenue Service which there's no service attached to the internal Revenue amen it's a the internal revenue takers yeah cuz we don't need their service but let me put it this way if you've ever been in a situation you're pretty happy the fire department comes aren't you you're pretty happy that the wheels don't get tore off of your car like the potholes they have in Arkansas yeah I've seen them swallow trucks hey happy there's a price that comes with that some of you aren't liking this Brothers list start an internal investigation we could act like the LDS and ask you to all submit your tax returns I tell you what you talk about devoted I don't know why I'm off track you talk about devoted they submit their tax returns and pay what the church tells them they ought to pay and they're just thrilled to be part of that you get around the message and you mention tithe or offering or whatever and people get all weird and if you're going to preach that we're not going to church here H that's kind of weird isn't it okay praise the Lord somebody start praying he'll move on so in 2 Corinthians 3:1 Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves or need we as some others Epistles of commendation to you and letters of recommendation from you ye are our epistle written in our hearts and known or read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart now as we look at this scripture my brother and sister we'll re recognize this that in giving we have to come to a place that we actually submit what God has done and we are now confessing that he has written on us can we can we just maybe be bold enough to lift a hand and say he wrote on me amen he wrote on me amen I I didn't read it somewhere he wrote it see it's one thing to know that it was said it's another to know it was said to you amen and when he makes it real to you so here we are as Sons and Daughters of God we're not taking as it were the church's opinion or man's opinion but God has written on the fleshly tables of our hearts now my brother and sister what is written there I want to tie this back with this inscription on the penny here's a picture of Caesar and he's telling them you give to Caesar what is Caesars now here is you and I in this 2023 as Sons and Daughters of God with something that has been superimposed and written inscripted upon you and I and what is that well I'll tell you what my brother and sister you can go around in the world as I started this off you can see the guy that's sports-minded everything about the decor of his life is something about sports and you can see the man who is all about business everything that he does is all about I got a new idea to make more money and you go over here and you got somebody that's into music and everything in his line might be good music but it's about music and you go over here it's all about this and it's all about that well where is the Christian in this whole equation there should be something that is marking the Christian that when the world looks at him they can say I see the uh the spirit of Le oysa imposed upon this one I see this spirit imposed upon this one I see this period imposed upon this one and who are these people they're different there's something about them that has been marked upon them that shows that they are and as that sister was there in a store I think we shared that story she's in a store and some woman walks up to her and says you know you don't have to live this life God doesn't require this all of these things you don't have to submit yourself to that and still be a Christian and God give that sister the right words and she says how do you know I'm a Christian because of the inscription that's that was upon her now this other person this other individual is opposed to that imagine my brother and sister whose face is on $100 bill any of you seen one of those lately is it Ben Franklin what if you is to stand day and say I refuse to touch any money that's got Ben Franklin's picture on it why I don't like Ben I'd be right behind you saying I love Ben now I'm not talking about that kind of love but if I got a choice between a five and 100 you follow me now my brother and sister the world's got a choice but they're finding it easier to have Caesar's picture than Christ they're seeking out Caesar's picture not Christ and Paul declaring I Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ you know what it is to be a prisoner you have given up all control of your own life and that's why they don't like him that's why they don't want Jesus Christ inscripted on them it's because they want to have their own life they just give me your name just give me your name see the superscription is something written or engraved on the surface of outside or above something else an inscription an address well you know what I'm glad my brother and sister that this subscription amen has been imposed upon me because you know what I'm I'm I I I say this to myself but I say it to you do you know I'm walking around with an address on me you're walking around with an address on you amen and it's marked in the very Behavior it's marked in such a fashion you know you you sometimes we get the neighbor mail amen you know the mail lady might you know just be grabbing letters and there's one there and ends up in our mailbox now my brother and sister we don't have to do anything I don't have to lick another stamp and put it on there I don't have to do anything we just put it back in the mailbox and it gets delivered to who it belongs to I don't have to go around this world and tell everybody I'm a Christian I'm a Christian I'm a Christian the address is written on me had a visitor in our farm shop that would have been Friday start to use some language and a minute it come out of out of their mouth they turned and looked at me and said I'm so sorry why because they're reading a different address than theirs they're reading a different writing and they recognize this is different this is different it doesn't make us weird it makes us his because we've been marked with an address that's sending us where we were called to go hallelujah amen I can see I might have to chop listen to because we're just not making much progress here and it's my fault amen so in 2 Corinthians the 3rd chapter: 1-5 uh we we don't want to commend ourselves or as some ACC commendations my brother and sister you see it's as much as we declared the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but the spirit of the living good not on the table of stone but in the fleshly table of the heart and this is God working on you and I and as we go down we won't read it all you can see it right there uh not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God so my brother and sister we are not sufficient to write on our own heart God God didn't say now you just write on your heart how you feel my brother and sister this whole feeling thing that has taken over the world has destroyed more people more marriages more families more children because we're into such a I feel well I'll tell you what my brother and sister I've had people come to me after a preaching of a service right here in this church and meet me at the back of the church and I read scripture and I read quotes and the quotes wasn't a singular quote it was quotes that are through the message and they look at me in the face and say I feel and I'm sorry this sounds rude maybe I didn't approach it right but the minute they said I feel I just dismissed whatever their argument was cuz I'm not really caring I love each and every one of you and I think you know that I fail if you don't but I'm not really caring about your feelings come on Amen come on when did our Fe that's right I know this sounds harsh oh I just felt the presence of God in the service today and they go right out exactly like they walked in that's right and the prophet of God taught us the word teaches us that you cannot walk out the same as you walked in you will either be better or you will be worse and yet they say I felt the presence of God well you might have but that's all you did is felt it it never it never got a hold of you you might have got a hold of it but it never got a hold of you well this ain't at all what I thought I was preaching to you Saints praise the Lord now this will throw some of you for a loop but just please hang on I want to put it in such a fashion that you don't misunderstand me say it in this way Paul that you might say that there's two tables in every person this is not two Soul Doctrine this is not the duplicity of souls T but you see we're looking here at the flesh man that's right and we're looking at the Spirit man right and the scripture teaches us that they're Waring that's right hey how many of you guys met the black dog this last week yes sir yeah you might put it this way he howled outside my window this week but you know who else I met this week yes sir the white dog amen and the white dog come as it were figuratively here laid down at my feet laid his head on my lap wrapped his tail around my ankle and loved me now one that's howling and one that's loving that might describe human nature isn't it and we can be that same way within about five minutes reminds me of a little Story Once little boy is with his dad going up town and they went to stores and whatever in the car and they're driving home the little boy says Dad can I ask you a question sure son why are you nice to everyone but us pretty blunt but see there's the warfare that's right there's the Warfare going on might not even realize that that that's the image that's projected so there's these two tables in every person and the flesh amen impressed upon by the natural and what I'm saying is this flesh and not all negative but say that your your dad was a handyman or a mechanic or a plumber or whatever now if that child pays attention he'll know how to wire a house he'll know how to fix the plumbing he'll know how to tune up a car and this is all just pressed upon him now it isn't necessarily that it would be son you have to learn this but he learned it because it was there and he was part of what was happening and it was in that that he started to see you know what oh that's how you change oil my goodness my brother and sister there was a a man in Colorado here a while back almost when the weather was still bad almost got run over by a semi on the highway because he got a flat tire stopped right in the middle of the road dug all of his suitcases out of the trunk and was trying to find the spare tire because he knew it had to be there he was 47 years old his daddy obviously did not teach him much of anything but another one would say common sense says get off the road and common sense says if the tire is not under the car it's in the car how did they learn that it was written on the table Able by natural life statistically Saints those families that are raised up in an atmosphere of Christ have more children who go on to raise their family in the atmosphere of Christ those that raise them up in the atmosphere of the horse trck or the ball field or the bar scene it produces everything they laid upon that heart but Les we get worried about this you will see that when Christ comes and he starts writing on the table of the heart amen everything that Daddy wrote on there everything that Mama wrote on there everything that LE oaia wrote on there gets wrote over and it breaks a cycle I got a good friend in South Africa lovely brother only one in his family that's a Believer well his wife and children but only one rest of his family and he said brother Paul I sometimes don't understand and I said all I know brother is whatever had been written on there was written over by something else and that's what matters because God writing on the fleshly table of the heart the word of the the hour of predestination of the Holy Ghost Revelation riding over it riding over it until it's no longer there now look my brother and sister see we can't ride on our own Hearts amen but look at this now the shared wisdom of man I'm very thankful for that my daddy taught me how to do a lot of things I can I can Plum a house I can wire a house I can roof a house I can frame a house my concrete work leaves a little bit to be desired but I'm thankful for my daddy but what I'm thankful most is when my dad heard the message that my dad said son this is the way you ought to go right here this is what you need to learn this is what you need to focus on this is what you need to make a priority and all the rest of that my brother and sister I'm thankful for but I'm thankful for Godly Parents more than I'm thankful for anything else in this world and I'm thankful that there was men in my life that would look me in the face and say Paul you can do better than you're doing rise up a little higher come up a little higher you see my brother and sister this is what God is do he's changing the image of what has been imposed upon us he's changing that image so that we bear another image oh you people say it's a message it's a message well I'm not going to argue with you but I'll tell you the message is Jesus Christ what's been imposed upon us now is Jesus Christ himself and that is why when you walk out and you walk down the road and you think man where did that thought come I'm talking positive where did that thought come from God dealing with you oh I'm thinking about this brother or this sister God dealing with you why are you thinking about them to raise them on your thoughts and dismiss them or maybe God wants you to stop and pray for them or maybe even stop and knock on their door God wants you to be part of his program because he's taking this word and pressing it as His Image oh my brother and sister I'm not expressing it as well as I'd like to this morning but I'm telling you God will superimpose every natural thing that was imposed on you and everything that's outside of the word imposed on you and he will come and impose his word and press it into you that you then bear the mark as that Penny had Caesar on it may the Bride of Jesus Christ have nothing other than Jesus Christ amen may they look at us and see not some kind of offshoot or some kind of this let them see Christ let them see the word living in this day now whether they choose to embrace that or not is up to them that's right I'm going to cut out a whole bunch of this if you don't mind amen you see whatever has been written in 2 Corinthians 3:7 17 and 18 He says now the Lord is that Spirit where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty we ought to be having Liberty in the house of God Amen we ought to be able to walk in here and take every issue in your life and set it down and say that's not who I am I'm a Son of God and walk right in and rejoice lift our voices to praise him and thank him because I tell you whatever has been imposed upon the flesh might stay upon the flesh yeah right yeah it might be met a brother one time he's blind preached at their church he come up to me he says brother Paul why was I born blind and it just come out of me I didn't have time to think about it because God Saves blind people and you're living proof he starts weeping that's right God God wasn't punishing me sir God's using me for an example that blind people can receive the word of God receive the Holy Ghost and serve him oh I tell you what that brother Chile down there that brother changed his whole attitude he went around forever and ever amen that's that little boy that was in St Carlos baroi amen was becoming increasingly angry at God he wasn't blind I'm sorry deaf he was deaf Lord just brought my memory back he was deaf CU he had a little friend that come up when he come up there for prayer come up to talk to me his little friend bold just come right up there too he said I'm his voice yeah that's it yeah and I'm telling you God bless him he's sitting right there with hands moving so fast I'm like this looks like and then little boy starts weeping just breaking down it's like yes God Saves deaf people too may we see who we are Saints what the world has imposed we're tall we're short we're big and little we're all these things none of that matters but what what's been written on the table of this heart is nothing short of Christ himself that's it that's right and he came to you and I and wrote his story on our life amen amen he didn't write it on everybody's life see what those people what all of them missed was the fact they should have been coming and saying there's something we see that was not written on our life and we need that we need that I need that written on my life that's the true approach to God not to come and say I'm going to criticize I'm going to find fault but to come and say what did you have I need and I want Hallelujah because you see when they stamp Caesar on that Penny it didn't look like Herod and we can't stand here today and say oh I've been marked by Christ but I look like the world yeah that's it amen and whatever's been stamped upon us will be evident amen will be evident Lord stamp me stamp me with your Holy Spirit you know this message I'm closing this message didn't come to give us something to argue about is't that amazing you can get people in a circle and before long if there's dissenting voices they'll be no no I'm right you're wrong I tell you my brother and sister this message come to draw you and I out that's right of our little houses of our little groups that we would lay in the presence of the sun right you see the wheat doesn't get ripe by saying I'm wheat that's right exactly right and I'm of this variety and you're of that variety we can't Fellowship no wheat comes to maturity amen by not saying you're not of us but by laying itself Amen in the presence of the Sun and it's there in the presence of the sun because you see makes sense right when all the wheat goes to the elevator it just all goes into one big pile and it doesn't hit and all all slide down together in the greenery some goes here and some goes there that's right amen so wherever I might be Lord let my light shine that's right let Christ that's been pressed pressed into me no matter where I'm at that's it that's it you know you see I'm sorry to go negative but I want to make this point you have message Believers get together where are you from well I belong to brother so and so's Church oh I belong to so and so's Church well I want us to change our vocabulary that's right I belong to Jesus Christ I live amen amen amen I don't know are you guys living in Louisiana yes I live in Louisiana I live in Washington I live in Idaho whatever it might be it's irrelevant if the image that's been pressed into US is Jesus Christ it's not a matter of where this is It's where God chose to place you and he placed you there because there's someone that needs to recognize that there is a life living in the presence of the son that reflects Jesus Christ hallelujah oh my I don't want to sound like I'm getting jaded but I'm telling you my brother and sister I'm just slowly getting very tired of people using all of these descriptive adjectives of describing who and what and where they are my Bible tells me I'm the bride of Christ and it doesn't say I'm the bride of Christ of here or the bride of Christ of there but I am the bride of Christ amen and I want to reflect and I want you to reflect the image of the word that God is pressing into his bride in this hour that we could then walk out and people wouldn't have to say now what religion are you they would be able to say I I I see you're a Christian I tell you many years ago when I was just struggling as a young man just really working toward is giving my heart back to the Lord I I I you know I had I had my work truck I had all kinds of music you know and when you're gone you don't see anybody you even know for all day kind of thing you know it's like safe to listen to whatever you want kids don't listen to me if I ever find out you got music that won't be I'll steal the wheels off your car did I say that out loud I'm working in a house one day another guy working another contractor working on the house I wasn't feeling like a Christian still had my faal St my failures I was well I I'll just be real blunt to you right at that stage of my life I was still learning when I hit my thumb with a hammer to say ouch didn't need all the other adjectives ouch is sufficient to describe what is happening to you you and I was learning to say ouch this man comes up to me brother Trevor and he goes I can tell you're a Christian I remember the day like it was yesterday I was down on my hands and knees doing baseboard in a closet and I looked up at him and I said I'm trying and I didn't even know this man at the time later got to be good friends with him his name was Larry he just come out there got down like this right here looking me in the face and said you either you are or you aren't there's no such thing as trying and I am just like yes sir I'm not trying that's right I am I am today my testimony is I am a Son of God cuz when I look in the mirror of the word I see what has been imprinted upon me is not Le oia it's not this out here it is Christ himself amen oh hallelujah hallelujah that's right oh my what time is it somebody 12:20 we have time to read a quote don't we yeah Hallelujah I really love this quote amen but you know the Heathen they prostrate themselves before an idol an imaginary God and in an imaginary way they believe that imaginary God speaks back to them that's heathenism that's romanism that's right they bow before all kind of saints and everything else they have Saint Cecilia a house God and so many different things like that they bow to that and actually believe that in an imaginary way what a type it is of the true Living God but when we not in an imaginary way that's it but prostrate ourselves before a living God a living virtue a living knowledge a living patience a living godliness a living power coming from a living God makes a living man a Living Image in the stature of God Amen I should have just read this quote dismissed earlier shouldn't I what's he doing the same things that Jesus did walking the same way he walked doing the same things he did because it's not imaginary thing there's a reality that proves amen see what I mean see how these virtues these building materials type in with the church Messengers with the church ages now one of these days we're going to take each one of these words and study them out and show that it proves it it Go all goes together sure see oh my how wonderful that is see to see it what it does now what is the house that God dwells in not a building with a great big Bell on top of it or a high steeple see but a body amen thou Hast prepared me that's right amen oh thank you Lord thank you Lord amen amen a body it didn't say only the body of the prophets only the body of these only the body of those but a body oh Hallelujah is there any bodies here today hallelujah amen oh a body that God can dwell in God can walk in God can see in God can talk in God can work in amen living instrumentality of God God walking on two feet am amen comma in you Lord Glory the footsteps of the righteous ordered of God God walking in you oh I'll tell you my brother and sister that's so real to me there's been times that I thought Lord how can I even overcome in this world right here feels like I just got got so much pressure got so many things Lord how can I and then this voice will come let go and let God have his wonderful way let go and let God have his way that's right and then you stop right there then it's not some deep spiritual thing but it's so deep that sometimes we miss it just to let God have his way why because if old Caesar saw that coin he'd say that coin exists because of me and when Christ looks at you that's it he says they exist that's right because of me that's right amen oh can we just stand and thank the Lord for that Hallelujah I exist because of my Lord Jesus Christ amen I thank you Lord I Thank you for the word father that you would come and you have superimposed your life upon our carnal life you have come and pressed yourself into US my brother and sister I'm telling you the image of Caesar didn't wipe off because it was in their purse it was imprinted so deep that it endured all kinds of struggle all kinds of daily wear and tear and the life and the nature of Christ is imprinted in you and I so deep
