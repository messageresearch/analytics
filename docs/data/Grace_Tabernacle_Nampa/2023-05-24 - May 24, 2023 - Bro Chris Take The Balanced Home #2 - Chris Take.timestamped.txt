[35:22] Jesus Christ's name amen
[35:25] amen's good to see each one of you
[35:27] tonight you can have your seats just for
[35:28] a minute
[35:34] hang on a second there Gideon
[35:37] oh you're good sorry thank you musicians
[35:45] I just wanted to read a couple of things
[35:47] here
[35:55] that doesn't work okay that's fine
[35:58] don't look
[36:00] so I wanted to read a couple things just
[36:02] in case
[36:04] there's uh any kind of disagreement with
[36:08] this with this type of preaching with
[36:10] this type of teaching tonight
[36:12] in Titus Paul Paul is is speaking to
[36:15] Titus
[36:16] and much like Timothy Paul's not
[36:18] addressing a church he's addressing a
[36:20] worker of the Gospel
[36:22] and he tells science he says speak thou
[36:24] the things which become sound Doctrine
[36:28] but there's a quote brother Branham and
[36:30] he says he says a long time ago when I
[36:32] was pastoring here we used to have just
[36:34] young men's classes and I'd speak to the
[36:37] young women on Sunday afternoon about
[36:39] sex and things then the next Sunday
[36:41] afternoon speak to the young men and try
[36:44] to get those things curved out so not
[36:46] every time it would have been hell that
[36:48] when brother Benham spoke
[36:50] was it you know
[36:53] fiery and deep things of the of the
[36:56] seals or whatever it would be sometimes
[36:58] what has to be ministered and what God
[37:00] lays on the heart is sound Doctrine just
[37:04] things that we go through every day
[37:05] where we're living every day of our life
[37:07] so
[37:10] back up
[37:11] tonight we're going to speak on the
[37:14] balanced home part two if you want to
[37:16] stand with me
[37:18] we'll turn to Ephesians chapter 5.
[37:21] verse 22.
[37:37] Ephesians 5 verse 22.
[37:41] reads as this wives submit yourselves
[37:43] unto your own husbands as unto the Lord
[37:46] for the husband is the head of the wife
[37:49] even as Christ is the head of the church
[37:51] and he is the savior of the body
[37:54] therefore as the church is subject unto
[37:57] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[37:59] husbands in everything husbands love
[38:02] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[38:04] church and gave himself for it that he
[38:07] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[38:09] washing of Water by the word
[38:12] that he might present it to himself a
[38:15] glorious church not having spot or
[38:17] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[38:19] should be holy and without blemish
[38:21] so ought men to love their wives as
[38:24] their own bodies
[38:25] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[38:28] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[38:30] but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as
[38:34] the Lord the church for we are members
[38:36] of his body of his flesh and of his
[38:38] bones for this cause shall a man leave
[38:40] his father and mother and shall be
[38:42] joined unto his wife and they too shall
[38:45] be one flesh there this is a great
[38:48] mystery but I speak concerning Christ
[38:50] and the church nevertheless let every
[38:53] one of you in particular so love his
[38:55] wife even as himself and the husband see
[38:58] that excuse me and the wife see that she
[39:01] reverence her husband
[39:03] children obey your parents in the Lord
[39:05] for this is right honor thy father and
[39:07] mother which is the first commandment
[39:09] with promise that it may be well with
[39:11] thee and thou mayest live long on the
[39:14] earth and your fathers provoke not your
[39:16] children to wrath but bring them up in
[39:18] the nurture and admonition of the Lord
[39:21] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[39:23] word you can be seated tonight
[39:25] so
[39:27] Ephesians
[39:28] parallels Joshua how many of you know
[39:30] that
[39:31] okay so if Joshua what was what was the
[39:35] Book of Joshua
[39:37] the Book of Joshua was putting Israel in
[39:41] their position
[39:42] okay
[39:43] and we we talked about last time for
[39:45] those of you who wrote here last
[39:47] Wednesday
[39:48] um we spoke the balanced home part one
[39:50] and because we kind of tried to talk
[39:52] about the man's position but
[39:54] unfortunately it's um
[39:56] kind of bled into other areas and I
[39:59] decided if you've noticed that I'm not
[40:01] going with subtitles
[40:03] I'm going to go with just the title
[40:04] because that gives me room to allow the
[40:06] Holy Spirit to speak because I try too
[40:08] hard to confine things into boxes so
[40:11] Joshua parallels Ephesians so Joshua was
[40:14] all about putting Israel in their
[40:16] position now there's one thing about
[40:19] your position when you hold your
[40:20] position you find strength in that
[40:22] position okay because God has a position
[40:25] for all of us to be in
[40:31] did you know the world has a position
[40:34] they want you to be in
[40:37] today and this is just very uh prevalent
[40:40] for me today because today at work we
[40:43] had what we have once a quarter called
[40:44] illuminate and it's just uh like a they
[40:48] got a bunch of speakers who talk
[40:50] and because the company I work for
[40:53] because their motto is inclusivity and a
[40:56] brighter future for all that's our motto
[40:59] inclusion privilege race all that is
[41:03] very Forefront
[41:05] and and I haven't I don't have an answer
[41:07] but God began to deal with my heart what
[41:09] is our answer to the topic of inclusion
[41:12] because when you hear them preach their
[41:15] gospel because it's their gospel when
[41:17] you hear them preach it it's pretty
[41:20] convincing it sounds good right be nice
[41:22] be kind be good to others but there's an
[41:26] underlying current that indicates
[41:30] now it's obvious for me as a minister
[41:32] but my thought process was on the
[41:33] younger generation or those doesn't have
[41:36] to be younger generation those who
[41:38] are oblivious
[41:40] who because when you when you when you
[41:42] have a social media feed or any other
[41:45] source to the outs to the world and you
[41:48] read that stuff every day whether it be
[41:50] a magazine subscription whatever it
[41:52] would be
[41:53] when you read that stuff you are reading
[41:55] the message of the world
[41:57] so if you're not it so the Baseline
[41:59] that's out there that Baseline is being
[42:02] fed to us
[42:04] and I have witnessed in message culture
[42:07] a deterioration
[42:10] of the Baseline Christ has set for us
[42:13] and we have adopted the Baseline of the
[42:15] world
[42:19] just get on Facebook
[42:22] during election
[42:26] and you will see what I'm talking about
[42:28] and that's just politics I'm not talking
[42:30] about modesty and everything else so we
[42:34] want to be in our position when it comes
[42:36] to to the word of God
[42:38] and that's hard to do sometimes because
[42:40] everything else is fighting against that
[42:41] so we have to be careful because we need
[42:43] the spirit of Christ
[42:45] the Holy Spirit through his word to show
[42:48] us the error
[42:50] by showing us the truth does that make
[42:53] sense
[42:54] so
[42:56] Joshua put the Israel in their position
[42:58] in that book the same thing happens it
[43:01] happens in Ephesians Paul the first
[43:03] church is Messenger now as the first
[43:06] churches messenger he has to set
[43:08] everything in order
[43:10] we have no Baseline until Paul begins to
[43:13] speak
[43:14] God used him he was the messenger in
[43:18] whatever A.D he was a messenger
[43:21] we have no problem reading about his
[43:23] words
[43:24] in the Bible
[43:25] but God bought another messenger at the
[43:28] end of the team time to do the same
[43:30] thing Paul did to bring back what Paul
[43:32] brought and to close it up because
[43:34] through history we forgot all about it
[43:37] okay so Paul his job was to set in order
[43:40] what was to come because
[43:44] nobody knew
[43:46] because look at what when it was left in
[43:48] their hands look what they were doing
[43:49] all you Gentiles you need to be
[43:51] circumcised
[43:54] Paul had to come and speak to her and
[43:55] say hey that's not what the angel of the
[43:57] Lord told me right so Paul had said this
[43:59] notice so what Paul does in Ephesians
[44:01] chapter 5 right here
[44:03] now
[44:06] I believe in exposing spirits
[44:08] through the love and the compassion of
[44:10] Christ and when I read verse 22 most
[44:13] places I can feel the static electricity
[44:16] increase in the building
[44:19] listen all I did was read you a
[44:21] scripture from the Bible
[44:23] oh we love Psalms 23 but don't touch
[44:26] Ephesians 5.
[44:28] when did we decide to split the Bible up
[44:31] when did we decide to say this is good
[44:33] and this is bad
[44:34] and it's because in mets's culture
[44:38] people went too far
[44:41] but that's people are you following a
[44:44] man I'm not
[44:47] I'm not if a man tells me something
[44:48] contrary to the Bible I don't receive it
[44:51] okay so Paul he lays out
[44:57] it's okay it's it's Wednesday night you
[44:59] all can go home and sleep this one off
[45:01] Paul lays out from top to bottom the
[45:05] structure of the family
[45:07] okay right here this is it you you ever
[45:10] wonder what's a family supposed to be
[45:12] like
[45:12] go back to Ephesians 5 22.
[45:15] I know we read it last time but I'm
[45:17] reading it again
[45:19] wives submit tears husbands reverence
[45:22] them respect them husbands love your
[45:24] wives as Christ loved the church
[45:26] why did christ love the church why did
[45:29] the Christ redeem the church that he
[45:31] might present it to himself
[45:35] so you got your eye you got your
[45:38] thoughts on what you want a wife to be
[45:41] and you marry her
[45:43] and then you have a few kids
[45:45] and you have a few years passed
[45:49] present to yourself the wife you want in
[45:53] the wife you have
[45:55] Christ redeemed you do you know do you
[45:58] know why your old man has to die
[46:01] your flesh has to die because that's
[46:03] your first husband and scripturally
[46:05] Christ can never accept you
[46:09] until their first husband passes away
[46:12] because that's scripture so Christ is
[46:14] not an idolater or an adulterer so he's
[46:16] not going to receive you that means one
[46:19] little ounce in your flesh one little
[46:21] thing that's an idea you have that's not
[46:23] according to the word of God I'm not
[46:24] talking about mistakes or or doubts or
[46:27] things you don't have figured out yet
[46:28] I'm talking about that talking a willing
[46:30] a willingness
[46:32] of disobedience
[46:35] Okay so
[46:37] you want to be in your position you
[46:40] can't get into your position until
[46:41] you're married to Christ and you cannot
[46:43] marry Christ
[46:45] you cannot marry Christ until your first
[46:48] husband is dead which is your flesh
[46:50] that's why you have to die to yourself
[46:52] every day of your life and there is an
[46:55] initial
[46:56] an initial crucifixion of the flesh when
[46:59] you get the new birth because you're
[47:01] born again now you're freshly unmarried
[47:04] and your husband has died okay so now
[47:07] you can marry Christ so Christ redeemed
[47:11] him redeemed redeemed us has brought and
[47:13] brought you back to himself because he
[47:15] knew exactly what he wanted
[47:19] so you husbands love your wives as
[47:23] Christ loved the church to present
[47:25] your bride to yourself how you want her
[47:32] and that means total surrender
[47:35] Christ
[47:36] okay
[47:37] children obey your parents fathers don't
[47:40] provoke your children
[47:42] many times incorrection we cross the
[47:45] line and we provoke rebellious behavior
[47:48] in our children
[47:49] because we aren't conducting ourselves
[47:52] properly
[47:55] we're not to control our children
[48:00] you control your child when they're 18
[48:02] they're gone
[48:05] and that's personal experience I know
[48:07] I'm young baby face take right that was
[48:10] my nickname in Journeyman School
[48:13] okay but I saw it because I grew up with
[48:16] those kids who were controlled reading
[48:19] their Bible was a chore they had to
[48:21] complete in the morning and check off
[48:23] the list
[48:24] guess what as soon as it was up to them
[48:26] to come to church they were gone
[48:30] now the same thing in in in in in
[48:32] Behavior with your children
[48:34] if you force your children now I'm not
[48:36] talking about discipline and correction
[48:38] is not control
[48:41] it's kind of manipulation if you think
[48:43] about it but so is preaching yeah
[48:46] yeah it's a little bit of manipulation
[48:51] lost some of you there
[48:54] quick where's the pastor
[48:56] Okay so
[48:58] well you know what let's just move on if
[49:00] there was a thought hanging there I
[49:01] apologize but I'm gonna move on Titus
[49:03] Chapter 2 Verse 1. turn with me please
[49:13] now we read verse one already touch on
[49:15] it again
[49:17] now you have to remember when Paul when
[49:19] he writes to Titus and he writes to
[49:21] Timothy
[49:23] he's instructing these young men
[49:27] whatever the young man I don't know if
[49:28] Titus was young he's instructing them in
[49:30] the way of the Gospel so these books are
[49:32] a little bit different looking than say
[49:34] Ephesians or Corinthians where he's
[49:36] speaking to a church
[49:38] so he's telling Timothy he's giving
[49:40] Timothy Specific Instructions
[49:42] he's giving Titus Specific Instructions
[49:45] based on the word
[49:47] on how
[49:49] he they should speak so you want to know
[49:51] you want some fundamental principles to
[49:54] conduct your family with
[49:56] right here
[49:58] but speak thou the things which become
[50:00] sound Doctrine
[50:02] that the Aged men be sober grave
[50:05] temperate sound in faith in charity and
[50:07] patience in other words teach this to
[50:09] your church Titus
[50:11] teach this to your church
[50:14] to the people you speak to teach this
[50:16] teach the men to be sober the age meant
[50:18] to be sober grave temperate sound and
[50:21] faith in charity in patience
[50:25] the number one thing lacking in men is
[50:27] patience
[50:29] and we snap
[50:31] and as soon as you snap you're not
[50:33] disciplining and correcting in love
[50:34] anymore you're controlling and you're
[50:36] dominating your family and you're going
[50:37] to drive the split of rebellion into the
[50:39] heart of your children which is as the
[50:42] sin of Witchcraft okay
[50:44] so you say oh you know people kids grow
[50:47] up and and they grow up with a message
[50:48] and they do all this crazy stuff and
[50:50] then parents say yeah well I don't know
[50:52] what happened well it was your fault
[50:55] you drove them to that behavior
[50:59] I don't want to do that to my kids and
[51:02] sometimes I do but I'm quick to say a
[51:05] little hug pull in close I'm sorry I
[51:08] shouldn't have spoke to you that way the
[51:10] fundamentals I was addressing still have
[51:13] to be addressed
[51:15] but I did it wrong okay
[51:20] the aged women likewise that they'd be
[51:22] in Behavior as becometh Holiness not
[51:25] false accusers not given too much wine
[51:27] teachers of good things
[51:30] most of this is pretty self-explanatory
[51:32] I would hope that they may teach the
[51:35] young women to be sober now now now this
[51:38] is aged women now it doesn't say you
[51:42] know
[51:46] there's nothing wrong with making this
[51:47] your verse
[51:49] it's not a bad thing if you're an aged
[51:51] woman sister
[51:53] but this is your calling because because
[51:55] as as as as Elders we're going to use
[51:58] the word elders elders in the gospel as
[52:00] men and women we have a calling to
[52:03] Mentor
[52:05] the young ones coming up
[52:09] so what what do you want
[52:12] what do you want to be your mentorship
[52:15] what do you want it to be
[52:18] I believe we would all say according to
[52:20] the word of God
[52:22] but here's the problem
[52:24] because the voice of the world on these
[52:27] topics
[52:28] is so strong
[52:31] we miss the mark sometimes because we
[52:34] just assume that's how it is does that
[52:37] does that kind of make sense
[52:38] we've been hearing this message of of
[52:40] child raising and and families we've
[52:43] been hearing it more from the world than
[52:45] we have from the church
[52:50] and 80 of the families that I come into
[52:53] contact with do not have a structure
[52:56] that lines up with the scriptures
[52:58] you say but they got Revelations and
[53:01] they go to church that's fine
[53:03] that's good
[53:04] and God will lead them
[53:06] to the truth but we're never going to
[53:08] get out of here until we get the
[53:09] balanced home because the balanced home
[53:12] is us in our positions
[53:22] okay
[53:27] so what are you gonna do what are you
[53:29] going to teach is it mentories if you're
[53:32] a mentor no mentors mentors mentories
[53:34] for your mentoring
[53:36] mentors okay
[53:39] to Mentor the young women the sisters
[53:42] who are mentors to the young women this
[53:43] is what you want to teach them
[53:45] to be sober that doesn't mean not drunk
[53:49] okay
[53:51] we need to be way past that
[53:54] okay
[54:01] one second here I have sober right here
[54:18] okay never mind I don't have sober right
[54:19] there okay so to be sober in other words
[54:22] grave reverent that kind of thing
[54:25] not sad
[54:27] no not sad
[54:29] grave doesn't mean no man
[54:32] man we're sad grave is to be reverent
[54:36] it's the to you know you don't want to
[54:38] be gaudy there's no one could do do we
[54:40] still know what that word means got here
[54:42] we've forgotten in culture today okay
[54:44] flamboyant you don't want to be
[54:46] flamboyant you're not a
[54:51] laughs
[54:53] you're not a streetwalker
[54:55] do you know you can have the spirit of
[54:57] the street of a streetwalker and be
[54:58] dressed modestly
[55:01] your dress your clothes don't say
[55:02] nothing about you but you can wear
[55:03] modest clothes
[55:05] anyways
[55:06] so
[55:09] don't be flirt in other words so be
[55:11] sober to to love their husbands
[55:15] or their husbands to be
[55:17] so so to love their husbands those that
[55:20] sentence there wow is that a big
[55:22] responsibility
[55:25] to teach the young women to love their
[55:27] husbands that is a very big
[55:29] responsibility because guess what news
[55:33] flash love doesn't just happen
[55:36] Love Takes work
[55:40] because to truly love
[55:42] you have to give up a part of yourself
[55:48] so we would teach them to love their
[55:50] husbands to love their children that
[55:54] that natural desire in a girl to mother
[55:56] should be nurtured
[56:00] you know so that's why the favorite job
[56:02] of a teenage girl is to babysit that's
[56:05] perfect nurture that don't start mowing
[56:08] lawns
[56:09] nurture your siblings
[56:13] don't start going and looking for a job
[56:15] when you're a teenager young ladies your
[56:18] your focus your calling in life is to
[56:21] prepare yourself for marriage
[56:25] because let me tell you this
[56:28] the world you see this is what's
[56:30] happened years have gone by and now it's
[56:33] so so normal
[56:36] in the world for girls to have a career
[56:40] it's so so normal
[56:42] right Mom working in the home worth
[56:45] three generations in
[56:47] there's no scripture that says
[56:49] definitive definitively like it does
[56:53] about modesty that a woman shouldn't
[56:55] have a career now we preach to the whole
[56:58] okay
[57:00] but each one has their each there's
[57:02] details that God works out but your
[57:03] focus I'm talking about in high school
[57:05] your focus remember I'm I'm I'm young
[57:09] but my dad talked all the time about
[57:10] when he was young you know it's what
[57:12] Dad's doing when I was a kid right
[57:14] um they used to have home home economics
[57:17] or whatever they call it in school homec
[57:19] right and way back way back when when
[57:21] before my dad was even in school they
[57:24] the the girls that was their class what
[57:26] sewing look when you get married if you
[57:28] don't know how to sew cook clean you
[57:31] have failed
[57:33] because that is your calling
[57:36] it shouldn't be like well you know I'm
[57:38] just not a cooking type I'm sorry are
[57:41] you a man
[57:44] can be chefs huh that's fine right
[57:48] but a woman is a caretaker of whom that
[57:50] is her calling
[57:52] and when you find that calling you find
[57:55] that position you find a balanced home
[57:58] and God loves
[58:01] a balance
[58:03] God loves a balance
[58:06] so you might hit 25 young ladies you
[58:11] might hit 25 be single still
[58:14] then hey maybe you want to look for a
[58:16] job now that's a detail and a Nuance you
[58:18] got to work out with God
[58:20] but your focus as you grow up should be
[58:23] all of those things to prepare yourself
[58:26] because we have no problem talking to
[58:29] young men about you know and especially
[58:31] especially
[58:37] sisters
[58:39] a mad boy better have a job
[58:41] and you're not learning to sow
[58:46] praise God
[58:49] I mean it's not my words
[58:52] it's a scriptures
[58:54] it's a scriptures and the man
[58:58] wants to marry a girl that will cherish
[59:00] him and take care of his home
[59:05] okay
[59:12] I heard uh
[59:16] Eagle Christian churches hiring a new
[59:17] Pat a new minister so
[59:19] if this is my last one
[59:25] to be discreet just keepers at home
[59:28] right that's what we're mentoring them
[59:31] that's what that's what you're growing
[59:33] up and that's your focus that's what
[59:34] your focus should be
[59:36] and as as fathers Lord help us
[59:41] to not get caught in the world's
[59:43] definition
[59:45] of a young woman
[59:50] I'm going to
[59:52] by God's grace if the Lord should tarry
[59:54] my desire let me put this way my desire
[59:57] is that my daughters
[59:59] would grow up
[1:00:01] having everything taken care of now they
[1:00:03] they I want them to play their part in
[1:00:05] the home and do all the things they will
[1:00:07] do but
[1:00:09] they if they need a car or they need
[1:00:11] different things I'm not gonna make them
[1:00:13] go get a job to pay for it that's what
[1:00:15] my young men will do
[1:00:16] my sons you get a job and pay for your
[1:00:19] car I mean maybe maybe that'll pay half
[1:00:21] or match or whatever it would be
[1:00:23] but when at the altar I wanted to be one
[1:00:26] a transition
[1:00:28] I want her to transition from taking
[1:00:30] care of my home
[1:00:32] and following me to taking care of his
[1:00:35] home and following him I want the
[1:00:38] transition to be so smooth
[1:00:40] all that changes is she's now in a
[1:00:42] relationship with the man she's married
[1:00:44] and she's in a different home but I want
[1:00:46] her to do the same things
[1:00:48] now he'll have a little bit of flair you
[1:00:50] know he might like burnt toast right
[1:00:53] okay so she but she she understands
[1:00:58] we wouldn't have half the problems we
[1:01:00] have if we had balanced homes
[1:01:03] we got distracted
[1:01:06] we got caught up in in in in in in in
[1:01:09] Malachi four five and six it was all
[1:01:12] about brother Branham and all about that
[1:01:14] and then we forgot about raising our
[1:01:16] kids
[1:01:19] nothing against anybody but there is a
[1:01:22] generational Gap
[1:01:24] and now we're reaping that problems
[1:01:27] today
[1:01:28] with divorce in the message
[1:01:31] you know what brother Branham said that
[1:01:33] was now he was talking to Pentecostals
[1:01:35] and he was talking to the world but it's
[1:01:36] the same thing that is this the
[1:01:38] principle is still true today parent
[1:01:40] delinquents
[1:01:48] now we talked about last time how how
[1:01:50] the best example for a bride for a wife
[1:01:53] the best example
[1:01:56] is the Lamb's wife so in case you
[1:01:59] weren't familiar with the scripture and
[1:02:01] there came unto me one of the Seven
[1:02:02] Angels which had the seven vials full
[1:02:03] the seven last plagues and talked with
[1:02:05] me saying come hither I will show Thee
[1:02:07] the bride the Lamb's wife
[1:02:10] in other words she was of a she was of a
[1:02:14] position where God was ready to show her
[1:02:17] off
[1:02:24] now first Timothy 5 14 I will therefore
[1:02:27] that the younger women marry
[1:02:31] bear children
[1:02:32] brother Branham constantly in this in
[1:02:35] the message he talks about how women
[1:02:37] have decided kids aren't for them
[1:02:41] and so they get they get pets
[1:02:46] you have to understand as a as a
[1:02:48] minister I have to be so careful
[1:02:52] that I keep my opinions out
[1:02:54] okay
[1:02:56] so I'm leaning into Gods the whole way
[1:02:59] through this series
[1:03:01] I need I need him because
[1:03:03] if I don't come across in love true love
[1:03:07] which True Love sometimes is corrective
[1:03:11] if I don't allow God to just use my body
[1:03:13] use my mouth to speak to you
[1:03:16] I'm just gonna do the same thing you
[1:03:18] would do to your children if you're
[1:03:19] controlling to them I'm going to read
[1:03:21] rebellion in your hearts
[1:03:24] so brother man says over and over again
[1:03:25] in the message you know
[1:03:28] women should should have children
[1:03:30] this is a scripture from the Bible
[1:03:34] now if for some reason you can't have
[1:03:37] children
[1:03:38] then this is a promise to you
[1:03:42] this is a promise if you're you're
[1:03:45] looking you know young ladies growing up
[1:03:47] or whoever position you might be in life
[1:03:49] and you desire a spouse a mate a husband
[1:03:51] this is a promise
[1:03:54] if we're not careful we look at this
[1:03:57] scriptures like this a little bit too on
[1:03:59] the negative side then this is this is
[1:04:01] the very heart of God
[1:04:03] this is the very deepest
[1:04:06] spot of him because look what he did so
[1:04:09] he could have a bride
[1:04:11] look what he did
[1:04:13] he died he suffered
[1:04:17] and and men brothers and sisters
[1:04:22] when you don't hold your position in the
[1:04:24] home you know what you're doing to the
[1:04:25] crucifixion of Christ you are spitting
[1:04:28] on it
[1:04:31] we have no problems with accepting the
[1:04:34] seals are opened and we'll go home and
[1:04:36] yell at our wives
[1:04:39] don't let that doctrine of the
[1:04:42] scriptures anything I like I said I use
[1:04:45] the seals because that's like the
[1:04:47] Pinnacle right whatever it's
[1:04:49] it is because that's Christ revealed to
[1:04:51] us and then we can get married to God
[1:04:53] Christ and then
[1:04:54] we're getting out of here at some point
[1:05:02] we'll get excited about about about
[1:05:04] preaching against against sin and we'll
[1:05:07] get excited about altar calls
[1:05:11] let me get it from the altar let me go
[1:05:13] home
[1:05:15] and what are we doing
[1:05:18] bear children guide the house
[1:05:23] guide the house
[1:05:28] and then this is cinches it right here
[1:05:31] give none occasion to the adversary to
[1:05:34] speak reproachfully
[1:05:36] do you know why the Bible says abstain
[1:05:39] from the very appearance of evil
[1:05:42] it's so you give no one room to point
[1:05:44] fingers and say I thought you were a
[1:05:46] Christian
[1:05:47] because they will do it and then what is
[1:05:49] your answer going to be
[1:05:52] or the Devil comes in and he and he he
[1:05:55] gets in as you're trying to pray and he
[1:05:56] begins to bring these things up as
[1:05:58] you're trying to pray then you have no
[1:05:59] freedom in prayer
[1:06:02] I know of an individual who for years
[1:06:04] has denied scripture in the Bible
[1:06:09] and you see that individual struggle
[1:06:12] with patience aggression because there's
[1:06:15] something eating at them on the inside
[1:06:19] I myself walk through that for space of
[1:06:21] time that thing you knew you know you
[1:06:24] have to make it right but you don't do
[1:06:26] it and it eats you up inside you're
[1:06:29] aggressive you're rude
[1:06:32] those aren't fruits of the spirit
[1:06:35] but as soon as you walk according to the
[1:06:39] scripture you find all of these things
[1:06:40] fall in line into your home you find
[1:06:43] peace in your house you never knew
[1:06:45] existed
[1:06:46] suddenly the the chill you know children
[1:06:48] will act up when there's unrest
[1:06:52] say man goodness why is that why are
[1:06:54] they such a bad attitude because they're
[1:06:56] nervous
[1:06:57] because you're always upset or you're
[1:07:00] too rough or or there's tension in the
[1:07:02] home
[1:07:02] that'll make your kids throw rocks
[1:07:05] through windows
[1:07:07] and do things you're just like what were
[1:07:09] you thinking
[1:07:10] well
[1:07:12] it's your fault
[1:07:18] today to be able to actually have one of
[1:07:21] the talks actually enjoy it and then
[1:07:23] glean good things from it and it was by
[1:07:25] who I've mentioned over the public
[1:07:27] before Jocko willing uh seven uh Seven
[1:07:30] Seals
[1:07:32] a Navy SEAL
[1:07:34] um and
[1:07:38] I forgot what I was going to say
[1:07:40] oh
[1:07:41] his Fame really started when he wrote
[1:07:43] the book extreme ownership
[1:07:45] and it's all for leaders
[1:07:49] and that is that you are the ultimate
[1:07:52] responsible one for everything that
[1:07:55] happens in your home
[1:07:59] okay
[1:08:01] in this quote here from the serpent seed
[1:08:03] it won't and a woman is just a part of a
[1:08:05] man a byproduct a woman was not in the
[1:08:08] original creation
[1:08:10] God had done
[1:08:12] quit creating for years and years and
[1:08:15] years until he made the woman out of a
[1:08:18] rib out of his side
[1:08:21] the reason
[1:08:23] the reason
[1:08:25] in culture today
[1:08:28] women fight so hard to compete with men
[1:08:33] is because in doing so they're directly
[1:08:36] denying scripture
[1:08:39] you wanna know what the devil's up to
[1:08:41] look at the opposite of scripture
[1:08:43] read a scripture what's the opposite of
[1:08:45] that the devil's gonna be right in there
[1:08:49] listen there was no woman
[1:08:52] without man
[1:08:54] boy that statement right there would get
[1:08:56] me fired tomorrow
[1:09:00] but that's the truth
[1:09:03] and that doesn't that that's not to say
[1:09:07] well
[1:09:08] anyways
[1:09:09] Adam had done named all creation
[1:09:11] everything else but he wasn't nothing
[1:09:13] for himself now see
[1:09:15] so he made him a help mate took a rib
[1:09:17] from his side closed up the gash and
[1:09:20] made a help mate to him and man in his
[1:09:22] Spirit was both man and woman now you
[1:09:25] can go read this directly in the
[1:09:27] scriptures in Genesis it says that
[1:09:30] God had Adam name the animals
[1:09:33] Adam named the animals and it says Adam
[1:09:36] was still alone so then God caused a
[1:09:39] degree date
[1:09:41] great sleep to come upon him and then he
[1:09:43] performed this surgery so this isn't uh
[1:09:46] brother branham's words this is straight
[1:09:48] from the scripture so you don't have
[1:09:49] woman without man
[1:09:52] you can't
[1:09:55] now the thing is though Adam was all
[1:09:58] alone
[1:09:59] Adam couldn't be his best without the
[1:10:01] woman
[1:10:03] you see see how this works if you take
[1:10:06] things like this you say Well Woman
[1:10:13] you mean nothing without me
[1:10:15] right I mean you see young guys take
[1:10:18] this this this ideology and you're like
[1:10:20] bro you're gonna be 35 before you ever
[1:10:22] find a wife
[1:10:24] because they think they're God's gift to
[1:10:25] mankind
[1:10:31] now I want to look at something here
[1:10:32] because the thing about it is is what I
[1:10:35] what I love to do
[1:10:37] what any one of us should love to do is
[1:10:39] go right back to the word
[1:10:41] right back to the word like I said
[1:10:44] there's ideas there's voices in the
[1:10:45] world today there's voices there's
[1:10:47] message culture
[1:10:49] there's voices in message culture
[1:10:51] there's preachers
[1:10:54] who preach
[1:10:56] Who Don't Preach it right
[1:10:58] who you know there's those of us who
[1:11:01] just live whatever we want and go to
[1:11:02] church and we're just message culture
[1:11:06] but the word of God never fails
[1:11:10] and if if it's truly the word of God
[1:11:19] the devil will never challenge it
[1:11:20] directly
[1:11:22] he's too scared to
[1:11:23] because if he does challenge the word of
[1:11:27] God directly he will expose himself and
[1:11:30] the worst thing that the devil wants is
[1:11:32] to expose himself
[1:11:34] he wants people to think they're they're
[1:11:36] good with God
[1:11:38] without knowing they're following the
[1:11:40] devil
[1:11:44] so
[1:11:46] um
[1:11:47] in the godhead
[1:11:49] we have this uh controversial uh subject
[1:11:54] the trinity
[1:11:56] father son Holy Spirit
[1:12:00] and
[1:12:02] which one to take a minute to look at
[1:12:04] this because if you take the scriptures
[1:12:06] and and you can take anything in the
[1:12:08] scriptures and you can use it
[1:12:12] and God can show you through it
[1:12:15] how to find your balance in the home
[1:12:18] because it's God's word
[1:12:21] so how does God take care of his family
[1:12:25] perfect example of how to take care of
[1:12:27] yours right because we want to model Our
[1:12:29] Lives after Christ
[1:12:32] so
[1:12:35] why the Trinity why did that Doctrine
[1:12:39] come up
[1:12:41] because with the doctrine of the Trinity
[1:12:44] you're remove Christ
[1:12:47] as your headship
[1:12:51] that's why it started way back in the
[1:12:54] first stage
[1:12:55] you remove Christ as your headship
[1:12:59] brother Branham is not my headship
[1:13:02] Christ
[1:13:04] is my headship
[1:13:06] for the BAM disagrees with the word I
[1:13:09] disagree with brother Brown
[1:13:14] and any errors that he made in this in
[1:13:16] the message that were disagreeable with
[1:13:18] the word for example that love is the
[1:13:21] type of the Holy Spirit God allowed him
[1:13:23] to correct him but look at how
[1:13:25] controversial the ministry of Jesus was
[1:13:28] to the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[1:13:31] the Pharisees and the Sadducees were the
[1:13:33] message of
[1:13:35] the first stage or whatever not the
[1:13:37] first stage before first stage the
[1:13:39] message the the the the the Christian
[1:13:41] world the message
[1:13:43] excuse me Christian world is the
[1:13:45] Pharisees in the statutes
[1:13:47] you see it's so easy for us to read in
[1:13:49] the Bible and accept it because it's the
[1:13:51] Bible
[1:13:54] but the Bible prophesies and speaks of
[1:13:56] things outside of its book
[1:13:59] but never contradicts with this book
[1:14:03] so and I also haven't found anything
[1:14:06] that gives me the freedom and the
[1:14:08] Liberty in my life
[1:14:10] so the Trinity what that was free I
[1:14:13] don't know where that came from so the
[1:14:15] trinity
[1:14:16] if you if you follow this you deny
[1:14:18] Christ at your headship I mean who are
[1:14:20] you supposed to follow
[1:14:22] the father or the son or is it the Holy
[1:14:25] Spirit you know I worked a job one time
[1:14:27] with my I worked we're building an
[1:14:28] addition on my on my dad's house I was
[1:14:31] like 1450 and I had my my grandpa Papa
[1:14:34] Tom and I had my dad
[1:14:35] and they were both in charge and I will
[1:14:38] go on an errand for him
[1:14:40] her papa and Dad would say what are you
[1:14:42] doing go over there and do this I'm like
[1:14:43] well just go there so I go to that and
[1:14:46] then he my grandpa's downstairs like
[1:14:48] what are you doing I told you to do this
[1:14:49] who do you want me to leave who do you
[1:14:51] want me to follow who's in charge okay
[1:14:53] okay here's uh you work with Papa I'll
[1:14:56] work with this guy over here
[1:14:58] right I needed one head
[1:15:00] if you follow the Trinity you got three
[1:15:02] guess what you can pick and choose
[1:15:04] how are you feeling today are you
[1:15:05] feeling Holy Spirit are you feeling
[1:15:07] father
[1:15:09] are you feeling the Sun what are you
[1:15:10] what are you feeling today right as soon
[1:15:12] as one offends you you jump to the other
[1:15:14] one there's no there's no headship
[1:15:18] there is though because if you're not
[1:15:20] under the headship of Christ you're in
[1:15:22] the headship of the devil
[1:15:24] plain and simple
[1:15:27] okay so that's why I brought in the
[1:15:29] Trinity and why it's so important why
[1:15:32] why it's such a a big deal
[1:15:34] because if you're if you follow after
[1:15:37] the Trinity if you follow after father's
[1:15:39] Unholy spirit
[1:15:41] I mean this is Elementary folks
[1:15:44] okay but you fall after that you're
[1:15:46] gonna miss in a mile high because you
[1:15:48] don't have Christ as your headship
[1:15:51] book he says now I am not trying to
[1:15:54] build a Doctrine Upon A Dream nor am I
[1:15:56] trying to vindicate any adoption I stand
[1:15:58] for by a dream
[1:16:00] Oneness of the godhead is all the way
[1:16:02] from Genesis 1 verse 1 to Revelations 22
[1:16:06] verse 21.
[1:16:08] I love that quote right there just
[1:16:11] okay but the people have been blinded by
[1:16:14] an unscriptual dogma of a trinity and
[1:16:18] that Dogma is so universally accepted
[1:16:19] that they tried to see a one God person
[1:16:23] is all but impossible if people can't
[1:16:26] see the truth of the godhead
[1:16:28] but fight it they can't ever see the
[1:16:31] rest of the truth because the Revelation
[1:16:33] is Jesus Christ in his church and his
[1:16:36] works in the midst of the church for The
[1:16:38] Seven Ages did you get that
[1:16:40] now I am sure you understand
[1:16:43] in other words
[1:16:44] it's a big deal
[1:16:48] and you the the the the the the the the
[1:16:54] Direction I want to take with that
[1:16:56] is that if you don't have one headship
[1:17:00] you're going to be all confused
[1:17:03] the devil loves to knock headship
[1:17:07] because as soon as he knocks scriptural
[1:17:09] headshot he's in control
[1:17:13] now
[1:17:14] we're going to read a story
[1:17:17] about a man who got out of headship
[1:17:20] but I wanted to I wanted to to point
[1:17:22] this out
[1:17:23] tonight humility unlocks true submission
[1:17:29] obedience
[1:17:31] surrender
[1:17:32] meekness
[1:17:34] go get your thesaurus when you get home
[1:17:37] yes sir whatever
[1:17:39] submission is interchangeable with
[1:17:41] obedience surrender meekness oh we all
[1:17:45] want to be meek
[1:17:47] but don't tell me what to do
[1:17:55] it's not me it's the word of God so take
[1:17:57] it up with Christ
[1:17:58] sorry first Samuel 15 verse 17 to 26.
[1:18:02] in Samuel segment that was little in
[1:18:04] thine own sight Samuel's speaking to
[1:18:06] Saul okay Saul went to fight the
[1:18:08] amalekites and didn't do what God told
[1:18:11] him to do obedience now
[1:18:13] okay he didn't obey God God said go
[1:18:17] kill the amalekites every single one
[1:18:21] don't leave one don't even leave a
[1:18:22] little baby don't even leave an old
[1:18:24] mother no thing no nobody left Left
[1:18:27] Alive and kill all the livestock
[1:18:34] now
[1:18:40] total surrender you could take that
[1:18:43] total surrender
[1:18:44] doing exactly what God wants you to do
[1:18:46] no matter what
[1:18:54] Lord help us
[1:18:57] when that was little and thine own size
[1:18:58] in other words Saul when you were humble
[1:19:01] whilst thou not made the head of the
[1:19:03] tribes of Israel and the Lord Anointed
[1:19:05] The King over Israel
[1:19:08] so
[1:19:10] God gave this position because you had
[1:19:12] humility
[1:19:14] and now you're in that position and
[1:19:16] you're just doing whatever you want
[1:19:18] you were humble you were Meek you were
[1:19:20] sweet to your husband and he married you
[1:19:24] that's why people like to get married in
[1:19:25] the world
[1:19:26] because marriage naturally brings a
[1:19:29] progression of husbands the boss even in
[1:19:32] the world I when I was going to
[1:19:33] journeyman Carpenters school there was a
[1:19:36] girl there that went with us
[1:19:38] and um
[1:19:41] she she was uh she had this boyfriend
[1:19:44] because it's like it's like a three-year
[1:19:46] school you go like six weeks every year
[1:19:48] so we you know be about a week about a
[1:19:50] year to eight months to a year in
[1:19:51] between we see see each other
[1:19:53] and she has his boyfriend for a long
[1:19:55] quite a few years and she gets married
[1:19:57] and she's so excited she's writing her
[1:19:59] last name literally on all of her books
[1:20:00] and everything and I thought it was
[1:20:02] hilarious because that's not the kind of
[1:20:04] girl you thought she would be and um and
[1:20:06] then the next session rolls around and
[1:20:09] she's she starts complaining to me and
[1:20:12] the guys at lunch one day and she's like
[1:20:14] yeah he wants me to do the laundry and
[1:20:16] like take care of the cook and
[1:20:18] everything and I have to understand she
[1:20:20] was working full-time he was working
[1:20:21] full-time she's construction I mean
[1:20:23] she's
[1:20:24] she's her she's one of those right you
[1:20:25] know that Galick got her flexing her
[1:20:28] muscles that was her right
[1:20:30] and now they're now Christians to the
[1:20:32] least bit
[1:20:33] and as soon as they get married
[1:20:36] that desire for that position just
[1:20:39] naturally comes out in him
[1:20:41] and her
[1:20:42] but she's like I got work and I got all
[1:20:44] these things to do and and you know we
[1:20:46] gotta pay our bills and she looks at me
[1:20:48] because this is the funny thing even
[1:20:49] though I was baby take and I was one of
[1:20:51] the youngest guys in class they knew I
[1:20:53] had I had a reputation to be to be a
[1:20:55] Christian and then God just does that
[1:20:57] that's not me that God just does that
[1:20:59] and so she looks at me for five she says
[1:21:01] what should I do
[1:21:03] and I had a brilliant moment I said get
[1:21:05] a smaller house
[1:21:09] foreign
[1:21:12] but that's now that's this the world
[1:21:15] that's just what happens but you see
[1:21:18] here's the funny thing
[1:21:20] here's a funny thing about this this
[1:21:22] whole Dynamics
[1:21:23] is as soon as uh worldly couple so
[1:21:27] people like you
[1:21:29] but worldly whatever
[1:21:31] couples
[1:21:32] maybe not you but people like you
[1:21:36] um
[1:21:41] as soon as she gets the job
[1:21:44] all of the excuses for not keeping up on
[1:21:47] the house tours are valid
[1:21:49] but hey man how come you haven't mowed
[1:21:52] the lawn yet
[1:21:55] it switches
[1:21:59] all that is is evidence that as a man
[1:22:01] working a full-time job you gotta have a
[1:22:04] help mate
[1:22:05] there's so much to do I had a long
[1:22:07] weekend you know I worked every day in
[1:22:09] my long weekend taking care of things at
[1:22:11] the house and different things
[1:22:14] anyway I'm gonna leave that there
[1:22:17] so Samuel's talking to Saul and the Lord
[1:22:20] sent me on a journey and said go and
[1:22:21] utterly destroy the Sinners the
[1:22:23] amalekites and fight against them until
[1:22:25] they be consumed
[1:22:27] wherefore wherefore then did is thou not
[1:22:30] obey the voice of the Lord but let us
[1:22:32] fly upon the spoil and that is evil in
[1:22:34] the sight of the Lord
[1:22:39] sometimes God calls us to do things
[1:22:42] and we think man
[1:22:44] say for example give money away or give
[1:22:47] give a gift think man I could really use
[1:22:49] this for myself
[1:22:55] so you give a but God's telling you to
[1:22:58] do it
[1:22:59] anytime God leads you to do something do
[1:23:03] it as fast as possible
[1:23:05] so Saul's looking at all this spoil
[1:23:07] thinking man what could we do with this
[1:23:11] I bet you anything if Saul would have
[1:23:13] well Samuel tells him Saul if you would
[1:23:15] have listened God would have sealed Your
[1:23:17] Kingdom right then and there in other
[1:23:20] words the tithes and the offerings would
[1:23:22] have been flowing in after this battle
[1:23:25] but Saul took matters into his own hands
[1:23:28] you want your sisters you want your home
[1:23:30] balanced
[1:23:32] you want your husband to be a certain
[1:23:34] way don't take matters into your own
[1:23:36] hands kill the amalekites
[1:23:40] and leave nothing breathing
[1:23:43] in other words destroy
[1:23:45] the sin destroy the enemy in your life
[1:23:49] and begin to exuberant
[1:23:51] exuberantly
[1:23:53] follow God and you will see the effect
[1:23:57] it has to have an effect
[1:24:00] it has to it's scriptural
[1:24:03] on your family
[1:24:05] and Saul said to unto Samuel yah I have
[1:24:09] obeyed the voice of the Lord and have
[1:24:10] gone the way which the Lord sent me and
[1:24:12] have brought a gag the king of amalek
[1:24:13] and have utterly destroyed the
[1:24:15] amalekites you see Saul reasoned in his
[1:24:19] head that agag was different than the
[1:24:22] amalekites
[1:24:24] we've reasoned away in message culture
[1:24:27] we've reasoned away
[1:24:30] dispositions
[1:24:33] because here's a problem
[1:24:36] when the message culture first started
[1:24:38] to come around
[1:24:41] look men were like you get in subjection
[1:24:44] now woman so we course correct it and we
[1:24:47] went way over there
[1:24:49] so now you see Holmes and she's in she's
[1:24:52] the boss
[1:24:54] they go to church they believe the same
[1:24:56] thing you do
[1:24:57] maybe it's even you
[1:25:01] and we've gone so far the other way
[1:25:03] she's the boss
[1:25:07] you'll never have peace in your home
[1:25:09] you might have you might appease her
[1:25:13] but you won't have peace
[1:25:16] in the home
[1:25:18] sometimes peace in the home comes
[1:25:20] through
[1:25:21] great trial
[1:25:23] because as soon as you decide like I
[1:25:26] said last week I hope you've started to
[1:25:28] implement
[1:25:29] as soon as you decide to change things
[1:25:31] in your home you have to need to be
[1:25:32] changed
[1:25:35] guess what all hell is going to break
[1:25:38] loose
[1:25:39] it's easy to give in to the adversary
[1:25:42] but easy has a cost
[1:25:48] I've obeyed Laura Samuel I just kept the
[1:25:51] king but the people
[1:25:53] the people look it says this is even in
[1:25:56] the secular world this right here is the
[1:25:59] first indication of weak leadership
[1:26:02] when a leader on your team begins to say
[1:26:04] well hey my team
[1:26:08] you're in charge you're the boss
[1:26:14] the people took up the spoil sheep and
[1:26:16] oxen the chief of the things which
[1:26:18] should have been utterly destroyed to
[1:26:19] sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in
[1:26:21] gilgal if this excuse won't work for
[1:26:24] Saul it won't work for you husband if
[1:26:26] you let your wife rule the house
[1:26:30] now there's a proper way to restore
[1:26:33] positions in the home there's a proper
[1:26:36] way to do it with love
[1:26:39] and prayer
[1:26:41] and holding the Bible between you
[1:26:45] if you're going to have a a moment of
[1:26:47] intense Fellowship
[1:26:48] each of you grab a hold of the Bible for
[1:26:51] hands
[1:26:57] if this wouldn't work for Saul it won't
[1:26:59] work for you you get to the white Throne
[1:27:00] judgment
[1:27:01] okay forget the white throwing judgment
[1:27:04] you face God in prayer and something
[1:27:06] comes after you say well look that's not
[1:27:08] my fault my kids are misbehaving
[1:27:12] it didn't work for Saul
[1:27:19] don't shoot the TV with the shotgun
[1:27:22] please
[1:27:23] that's control
[1:27:25] and we thought that was funny right I
[1:27:27] say we I was I was like five years old
[1:27:29] when this stuff was coming out in the
[1:27:31] message maybe even not even born yet oh
[1:27:33] yeah you know
[1:27:35] like what
[1:27:37] what good did that do anybody we took
[1:27:41] the TV out and we shot it with the
[1:27:43] shotgun so you took your you know I I I
[1:27:45] grew up with kids and and and I and I I
[1:27:48] wish I would have handled myself
[1:27:49] differently but there's two different
[1:27:50] occasions where I found
[1:27:53] enemy Contraband and my friends
[1:27:56] cars or bedrooms
[1:27:59] and like an idiot show their parents
[1:28:01] should let's let them deal with that
[1:28:03] and the response both parents responded
[1:28:06] the same way and neither of their
[1:28:08] children serve God their response was
[1:28:09] what is this trash throw it out the
[1:28:12] window crush it up in Anger what is that
[1:28:15] is that what God did when you had sin he
[1:28:17] grabbed you said what's your problem and
[1:28:19] crushed you
[1:28:20] no he he went out and died for you
[1:28:27] he went out and died for you and then he
[1:28:30] wooed you while you're sinning
[1:28:33] doing all the things denying him he went
[1:28:36] out he died for you he said this is the
[1:28:37] way to get them and then he wooed you
[1:28:40] come on
[1:28:41] come here
[1:28:43] he wooed you know he if you heard I got
[1:28:46] you your Pepsi here got you little
[1:28:48] flowers he ruled you little things here
[1:28:51] and there to indicate
[1:28:55] God was here or in it wow that just made
[1:28:58] me feel good and then as you go you find
[1:29:01] out it's connected to him
[1:29:03] he didn't take your rocking your own
[1:29:05] music and break it in your face
[1:29:09] he led you until you were so convicted
[1:29:12] in your heart you
[1:29:14] burned it or threw it away
[1:29:17] or you took those magazines or you took
[1:29:19] those websites off your thing your phone
[1:29:21] or whatever it is
[1:29:22] and Samuel said hath the Lord has great
[1:29:25] Delight in burnt offerings and
[1:29:27] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[1:29:30] the Lord behold to obey is better than
[1:29:32] sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of
[1:29:35] rams
[1:29:39] obedience we just had that slide up
[1:29:42] there
[1:29:43] we just had that slide up there that
[1:29:45] showed obedience is the same as
[1:29:46] submission
[1:29:48] humility but Saul lost his humility and
[1:29:51] he lost his position
[1:29:55] that that
[1:29:57] Navy SEAL I was mentioning earlier
[1:30:00] he said the Navy has spent billions of
[1:30:03] dollars to try to figure out how to to
[1:30:06] determine somebody's gonna make a good
[1:30:08] seal
[1:30:11] and they just they hardly ever get it
[1:30:13] right
[1:30:13] people go to that to the boot camp and
[1:30:16] they fail thousands of them fail
[1:30:20] to make it through and then they get
[1:30:22] some out the other side who are
[1:30:23] worthless
[1:30:25] he said but
[1:30:27] so they don't have programs but then the
[1:30:29] individuals like himself who was a
[1:30:30] trainer uh
[1:30:32] trainer for a while
[1:30:34] whatever coach we're gonna call it
[1:30:36] he says I can spot a man that's going to
[1:30:39] be a good seal
[1:30:41] and is the number one characteristics
[1:30:43] they all share he said is humility
[1:30:47] and I thought my goodness what a lesson
[1:30:49] that could be for us in the house of God
[1:30:52] when we hold positions maybe it's song
[1:30:54] leader maybe it's a musician maybe it's
[1:30:56] in the sound booth if you don't hold
[1:30:59] humility
[1:31:00] you create awkward situations
[1:31:03] when someone has to come and ask you to
[1:31:05] do something a little bit different
[1:31:08] the same thing in the home
[1:31:10] without humility
[1:31:12] brother your wife comes and tells you
[1:31:17] in and now she's in her position she's
[1:31:19] in love
[1:31:22] you have to receive that
[1:31:24] I've had to I've had to sit there and go
[1:31:29] pray and pray and pray and pray and pray
[1:31:31] because I know she's right but I'm too
[1:31:33] upset
[1:31:35] and I have to pray and pray and then
[1:31:40] before sometimes I'm not done being mad
[1:31:42] and I say you're right I'm sorry and
[1:31:45] then I'm not mad anymore
[1:31:47] sometimes you have to take that step
[1:31:49] humility that's what God wants you know
[1:31:52] I can point to you
[1:31:54] the same thing
[1:31:56] so be a good soldier a good assistant in
[1:31:59] the house of God whether whatever
[1:32:00] position that might be is when someone
[1:32:03] is has humility and I can come to them
[1:32:05] and I can talk to them and I can ask
[1:32:07] them
[1:32:08] and I have to be humble in my position
[1:32:11] too
[1:32:13] so that I can be get feedback
[1:32:17] or I can be told you should probably do
[1:32:19] this a little bit differently you should
[1:32:20] think about doing it this way here is
[1:32:22] what it says in the message here's what
[1:32:24] it says in the word
[1:32:25] if I'm humble then I find growth in the
[1:32:29] word of God as soon as you lose your
[1:32:31] humility you Flatline as a Christian
[1:32:34] and you will you might gain knowledge of
[1:32:37] this of the message you might gave
[1:32:39] knowledge of the Bible but you'll go
[1:32:41] Flatline all it can be years
[1:32:44] and your Flatline oh you might you might
[1:32:47] be in the message for 40 years and you
[1:32:49] might have your children all raised up
[1:32:50] but you back here when you were 25 you
[1:32:53] flatlined
[1:32:54] because you lost your humility because
[1:32:56] you thought you had arrived
[1:32:59] and now God hadn't been able to do
[1:33:01] nothing with you
[1:33:02] guess what you're going to have to be
[1:33:04] stripped all the way back
[1:33:07] to this point
[1:33:08] wouldn't you rather correct it as soon
[1:33:10] as possible
[1:33:12] I would
[1:33:14] by God's grace
[1:33:15] behold to obey that's why a revelation
[1:33:18] of Grace is so important because it
[1:33:20] keeps you humble
[1:33:22] to hearken than the fat of ram so
[1:33:24] obedience for Rebellion is as the sin of
[1:33:28] Witchcraft and stubbornness is as
[1:33:30] iniquity and idolatry
[1:33:34] so when you control your children
[1:33:36] there's no balance in the home first of
[1:33:38] all y'all want okay this is a this is
[1:33:41] indicated of a raised hand if you don't
[1:33:42] raise your hand I'm going to assume you
[1:33:44] disagree with me do you want peace in
[1:33:46] your home
[1:33:47] oh come on
[1:33:54] we're gonna have a hand raising exercise
[1:33:56] next time
[1:34:00] I can preach the word to you but you
[1:34:02] have to confess the word in your life
[1:34:05] you can't say it now in front of the
[1:34:07] church go home and say in front of the
[1:34:08] mirror God I want peace in my home
[1:34:12] though I was I've been really thinking
[1:34:14] about this concept that the word is here
[1:34:16] but guess what it does no good
[1:34:19] unless it's spoken it's creative power
[1:34:22] comes from it's being spoken that's why
[1:34:25] God how to create us that's what God had
[1:34:27] to speak God couldn't just write the
[1:34:29] Bible and set it there on his coffee
[1:34:31] table he had to speak let there be light
[1:34:34] oh he had the thoughts he had the
[1:34:36] thought of you he had all of that word
[1:34:38] in within him but he had to speak it to
[1:34:41] put it into action
[1:34:43] just start walking around your house
[1:34:44] let's say for example that that there's
[1:34:47] there's a contention in your home
[1:34:50] and you just you know maybe you need to
[1:34:53] wait when nobody's there because look be
[1:34:55] wise as serpents and homelessness doves
[1:34:57] if your husband's not in his position
[1:34:59] don't go walking by him reading husbands
[1:35:01] love your wives
[1:35:03] you might be reading the Bible but
[1:35:05] you're just causing contention
[1:35:08] husband's the same thing don't be
[1:35:10] whipping out Ephesians five you're just
[1:35:13] taking the word of God and I'm sorry
[1:35:14] you're disrespecting it
[1:35:16] when no one's home okay
[1:35:20] walk through the house and just read
[1:35:25] you know whatever it is
[1:35:29] looking for that blessed hope and the
[1:35:30] Glorious appearing of the great God and
[1:35:33] our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself
[1:35:35] for us right I mean I don't know
[1:35:37] whatever the scripture is you need to
[1:35:38] apply to your home
[1:35:39] the word
[1:35:41] the reason it's a it has its effective
[1:35:43] because you read it now when you read it
[1:35:46] it's being spoken right whether it's
[1:35:48] okay you're consuming it you're hearing
[1:35:51] it
[1:35:52] okay
[1:35:53] is speaking the word of God puts it into
[1:35:55] action so
[1:35:58] because thou Hast rejected the word of
[1:36:01] the Lord he hath also rejected thee from
[1:36:03] being King now once you're sealed and
[1:36:06] you're got the Holy Ghost got the new
[1:36:09] birth
[1:36:10] you're a son of God
[1:36:13] you can't nothing can change that
[1:36:16] but if you want to be king of your home
[1:36:20] you have to accept the word of God
[1:36:23] and until you start to accept and apply
[1:36:25] that word to your home I'm sorry you're
[1:36:28] not the king of the home
[1:36:32] Brothers you want that position in your
[1:36:34] home you want to be the king
[1:36:35] start applying the word to your life
[1:36:38] and to your home
[1:36:42] devotions
[1:36:45] lovingly talking to your wife about
[1:36:47] things
[1:36:51] you want to be king of your home
[1:36:53] don't do it solved it
[1:36:56] Follow The Obedience to the word of God
[1:36:58] be in submission which goes directly
[1:37:00] back to the scripture where it says the
[1:37:02] man submits to Christ
[1:37:05] right Ephesians 5.
[1:37:08] okay so Saul said unto Samuel I have
[1:37:10] sinned for I have transgressed the
[1:37:12] command of the Lord oh I'm sorry but it
[1:37:14] was too late
[1:37:16] don't let it be too late like I said you
[1:37:18] sealed
[1:37:19] the Holy Ghost maybe but
[1:37:21] you don't want to you don't want it to
[1:37:23] be too late for your family
[1:37:27] until they're all broken apart
[1:37:29] and you're sorry I know Brothers good
[1:37:32] men
[1:37:33] good men
[1:37:35] in well-aged
[1:37:37] humble servants of God who didn't
[1:37:41] keep the balance in their home
[1:37:45] and yeah they're serving God yes they've
[1:37:47] repented but they've left in their wake
[1:37:49] of family
[1:37:50] who is messed up
[1:37:54] I don't want that to be the testimony of
[1:37:56] the Saints of Grace Tabernacle
[1:37:59] let's apply the word in our lives
[1:38:01] let's apply this to our homes let's get
[1:38:03] balanced home so that when people come
[1:38:07] we have
[1:38:09] we have or we have the right
[1:38:11] representation of God of Christ in our
[1:38:13] church and in our families
[1:38:15] because smart people
[1:38:18] don't just look at how you are in church
[1:38:19] smart people watch you at home
[1:38:23] and they say oh
[1:38:26] he won't you don't want them to you
[1:38:27] don't want reproach brought upon you
[1:38:29] want them to say wow
[1:38:30] that's a family that serves God
[1:38:41] and thy words because I feared the
[1:38:43] people and obeyed their voice the Bible
[1:38:45] never says the people didn't speak
[1:38:48] to Saul
[1:38:52] so we can just ex we just say well we'll
[1:38:54] just we always say well people should
[1:38:56] have shouldn't have you know made that
[1:38:58] excuse but have we stopped to realize
[1:39:00] that maybe the people were complaining
[1:39:02] sometimes your family complains
[1:39:04] sometimes your wife complains but you
[1:39:06] have to stay in love and compassion
[1:39:08] honey we are applying the word to our
[1:39:11] home in love and compassion
[1:39:14] don't throw the high heels out the front
[1:39:15] door
[1:39:16] in love and compassion I'm controlling
[1:39:19] Don't force them to do anything in love
[1:39:22] and compassion lead them to truth
[1:39:26] by following it yourself
[1:39:30] okay
[1:39:32] now therefore I pray thee pardon my sin
[1:39:34] and turn again with me that I may
[1:39:36] Worship the Lord
[1:39:38] Samuel said unto Saul I will not return
[1:39:40] with thee for thou Hast rejected the
[1:39:42] word of the Lord and the Lord hath
[1:39:43] rejected thee from being King over
[1:39:46] Israel
[1:39:53] Saul had a choice
[1:39:56] we all have a choice
[1:40:01] a couple of things first God doesn't
[1:40:03] want robots
[1:40:05] second
[1:40:09] God's going to tell you
[1:40:11] you had a choice
[1:40:15] you had a choice
[1:40:18] how did how do you serve God you want
[1:40:20] God to how
[1:40:21] ever this applies to everybody
[1:40:23] this is tonight how do you want God to
[1:40:26] treat you
[1:40:30] well that's how you should treat others
[1:40:33] Sunday school the Golden Rule
[1:40:37] but then we got out of the Sunday school
[1:40:39] and
[1:40:40] we got hip and we got a job and
[1:40:44] we got cool
[1:40:48] we got good at volleyball good Spike
[1:40:51] to go to the camp show up to the girls
[1:40:53] flirt
[1:40:56] what's the point if you're if the word's
[1:40:59] not going to be applied in your life
[1:41:00] what's the point
[1:41:04] we want God's word applied in our lives
[1:41:07] and that means facing our Humanity
[1:41:11] and looking in the mirror can I tell you
[1:41:13] something can I be very vulnerable and
[1:41:15] transparent with you
[1:41:17] since I started to study this over a
[1:41:20] week ago we have had some turmoil
[1:41:26] because God wants me to live it
[1:41:32] so when I say all this I speak
[1:41:35] I speak from experience knowing it's
[1:41:38] hard
[1:41:39] you know the culture today and you read
[1:41:42] it and you might disagree with it but
[1:41:44] you still internalize it and it's a
[1:41:46] message you hear over and over and over
[1:41:47] and over and over and over and over
[1:41:49] again
[1:41:50] mama just needs more coffee
[1:41:53] right
[1:41:54] if you're worldly they say wine okay you
[1:41:57] all have seen it because I know y'all
[1:41:59] are online you've seen it mama just
[1:42:02] needs another cup of coffee it's been a
[1:42:03] hard day you know adulting is hard okay
[1:42:06] when was it not
[1:42:09] right when was it not
[1:42:14] when I'm tired and I'm worn out and it
[1:42:16] my family's saying hey are we gonna do
[1:42:17] devotions now
[1:42:19] what do I say oh no no I suck it up
[1:42:21] excuse me that was a bad word to use
[1:42:24] I pull myself up on my bootstraps and I
[1:42:27] deal with it
[1:42:29] I'm not perfect there are some days
[1:42:30] where I don't
[1:42:34] I put myself by bootstraps I you have to
[1:42:36] deal with it life is strenuous
[1:42:40] the culture if you want to know the
[1:42:42] opposite
[1:42:44] if you want to know what God wants do
[1:42:45] the opposite of mainstream whenever I
[1:42:49] see stuff go mainstream that seems good
[1:42:52] at first and when it gets popular I get
[1:42:55] concerned
[1:42:57] because I'm thinking what am I missing
[1:42:59] here because it doesn't get popular
[1:43:02] it doesn't get popular unless the
[1:43:04] devil's in favor of it
[1:43:07] it'll never your video I'm sorry your
[1:43:10] video of you playing you know burn burn
[1:43:13] Holy Spirit on the fiddle and never
[1:43:15] gonna go viral
[1:43:19] do you see we we had the privilege
[1:43:22] privilege I don't know if privilege is
[1:43:23] the right word but we had the privilege
[1:43:24] of of being introduced not physically
[1:43:28] but introduced to this influencer who
[1:43:30] was a young Christian Mom married to her
[1:43:33] husband and her testimony at the
[1:43:35] beginning of this was good and she had
[1:43:37] good advice on how to take care of your
[1:43:39] home and and how to be you know
[1:43:41] minimalize all of the junk and different
[1:43:43] things and so Christian was following
[1:43:44] her daughter of course it changed our
[1:43:46] household it was amazing but we had the
[1:43:49] privilege of
[1:43:50] privilege is not the right word it's
[1:43:52] because it's sad of sitting in the seat
[1:43:54] and watching her progress
[1:43:58] as she started to get more and more
[1:44:00] popular and more influenced
[1:44:02] she started to drift from those values
[1:44:04] it was a lot more about you know what
[1:44:06] she started to do
[1:44:08] go off on weekends by herself because
[1:44:11] she needed a break
[1:44:15] so you know what if you're not careful
[1:44:17] you followed her at the beginning as a
[1:44:19] woman you get to you say yeah hubby I
[1:44:22] need to bring why do you need a break
[1:44:23] from your husband
[1:44:25] now I understand and once in a while you
[1:44:27] know the guys got to go hang out with
[1:44:29] Banya or whatever sisters got to go have
[1:44:31] their fellowship and whatever they do or
[1:44:34] whatever okay yeah moments where that's
[1:44:36] fine it's refreshing right
[1:44:39] because you just well I'm not going to
[1:44:41] go into that because I don't know how to
[1:44:42] get out of it so
[1:44:44] but you're talking about I needed a
[1:44:46] weekend away from the fact
[1:44:48] sister your job is to take care of your
[1:44:50] kids in your household yeah be just
[1:44:52] dumping it on your husband
[1:44:54] if you have to dump the household on
[1:44:56] your husband consistently there's
[1:44:58] something wrong
[1:45:00] you're doing something wrong
[1:45:06] so anyways we got to watch and now she's
[1:45:08] left her husband oh we're still okay
[1:45:11] it's this new topic I wish my wife was
[1:45:12] here because I can't remember the word
[1:45:15] I think it's called unmarried they don't
[1:45:17] say divorced anymore they're unmarried
[1:45:21] uncoupling people don't get divorced
[1:45:24] they uncouple
[1:45:27] foreign
[1:45:30] s were we were you know we were we we
[1:45:32] sat in bed together watched a movie and
[1:45:34] ate popcorn we were sad we were
[1:45:36] uncoupling
[1:45:39] and you laugh and you shake your head
[1:45:41] but young girls in the message are
[1:45:43] reading that stuff
[1:45:45] we already did the social media thing
[1:45:46] I'm not gonna do it tonight but you're
[1:45:48] you're feeding on that stuff and to you
[1:45:51] if you haven't been one if you haven't
[1:45:53] been I'll use her an example because
[1:45:55] it's also the same I I think I made it
[1:45:57] nobody it's also the same progression
[1:46:00] but if you just read that stuff
[1:46:02] now slowly the devil begins to turn you
[1:46:08] until you're walking through life as a
[1:46:09] woman saying
[1:46:12] I need a break take the kids now
[1:46:15] there's balance in everything
[1:46:19] but when it's habitual
[1:46:22] something's wrong what why because you
[1:46:23] read it on social media now you may not
[1:46:26] agree with that but you're feeding on
[1:46:28] that so you have to feed on the word of
[1:46:30] God to bring you back into balance okay
[1:46:31] let's let's move on
[1:46:32] so
[1:46:34] there's a
[1:46:35] Brothers good advice read the song with
[1:46:38] Solomon
[1:46:39] just get over yourself and read that
[1:46:42] book
[1:46:44] so Jesus what he knocks on our door
[1:46:48] right
[1:46:49] he knocks on your heart hey
[1:46:52] let me in he finds you he knocks on your
[1:46:56] door
[1:46:57] but you have to open it
[1:46:59] now in the Song of Solomon or song of
[1:47:01] songs that some places call it chapter
[1:47:03] five says I sleep but my heart waketh
[1:47:06] this is the voice of the Bride
[1:47:07] it is the voice of my beloved that
[1:47:09] knocketh
[1:47:10] beloved saying open to me my sister my
[1:47:14] love my Dove my undefiled for my head is
[1:47:16] filled with Dew and my locks with the
[1:47:18] drops of the night I have put off my
[1:47:20] coat how should I put okay so she gets
[1:47:23] she gets all ready for bed she gets in
[1:47:25] bed she's already washed brushed her
[1:47:26] teeth taking care of everything she's
[1:47:27] laying down she's all cozied in her
[1:47:29] covers and now he comes knocking
[1:47:33] and she says well I put off my coat how
[1:47:36] shall I put it on and I I've already
[1:47:38] washed my feet and if I get out of bed I
[1:47:40] have to wash them again and I have to do
[1:47:41] all this stuff it's too much work
[1:47:43] so she puts it off and she pushes pushes
[1:47:45] it off and then she gets up and she runs
[1:47:47] to the door to open it and she and she's
[1:47:50] dripping with myrrh and all these things
[1:47:51] so she's ready to welcome him and and
[1:47:53] she opens the door open to my beloved
[1:47:55] but my beloved head withdrawn himself
[1:47:57] and was gone
[1:47:58] my soul failed when he spake I sought
[1:48:00] him but I could not find him I called
[1:48:03] him but he gave no answer
[1:48:06] he didn't come when he called for her
[1:48:09] so he moved on now she goes and she
[1:48:13] searches and she gets in trouble for
[1:48:14] being whatever down the work down the
[1:48:17] line and she finds him again but
[1:48:20] he knocked
[1:48:22] now
[1:48:23] here's I I just pray that God would just
[1:48:26] tie this beautifully together
[1:48:28] because it's it's very difficult to make
[1:48:31] the transition of Your Leader as a man
[1:48:33] your wife is a follower and when you're
[1:48:37] in your position she's in her position
[1:48:39] but she has a part to play
[1:48:41] that connection there is something that
[1:48:44] I want to to nail down and then we'll
[1:48:46] close
[1:48:47] and that's true Christ can knock but you
[1:48:50] are the only one that can open the door
[1:48:53] you can say come in Christ I welcome you
[1:48:55] still he can't get in
[1:48:58] until you unlock the door
[1:49:02] then you you can come in
[1:49:05] so Christ comes to the door and he
[1:49:07] knocks but you have to get up and let
[1:49:11] him in you get to say come in Christ I
[1:49:12] welcome you no you have to go and open
[1:49:14] the door
[1:49:15] he's talking about that painting where
[1:49:17] there's no handle on the outside you
[1:49:19] have to go open the door
[1:49:20] you want balancing your home sisters
[1:49:23] your husband begins to knock
[1:49:26] you have to give him his head
[1:49:29] when you said I do at the altar you laid
[1:49:32] no we don't do the veil on the shoulder
[1:49:34] anymore but symbolically you gave in
[1:49:38] to his headship
[1:49:40] what's the devil going to do with the
[1:49:41] rest of your life fight that so you have
[1:49:44] to constantly give your head give him
[1:49:48] your will give him
[1:49:50] your desires give him your heart
[1:49:54] yes he has to be a leader and he be in
[1:49:56] his position
[1:49:57] but you we have a part to play Christ is
[1:50:00] always in his position
[1:50:03] we're the ones who sometimes get out of
[1:50:05] that
[1:50:06] correct
[1:50:07] so sometimes
[1:50:09] things happen in life and we move
[1:50:13] he's so the man has the whole
[1:50:15] disposition but you have to give him
[1:50:17] that gift of headship
[1:50:21] now in closing here
[1:50:25] now to all that's let's get away from
[1:50:27] this interbreeding let's get back to the
[1:50:29] real original Fruit let's go back to the
[1:50:31] place where God made us as Sons and
[1:50:33] Daughters of God to depend on what God
[1:50:35] Said and don't take the woman's word of
[1:50:37] hybriding see how the natural and the
[1:50:40] spiritual is typed you see my vision
[1:50:41] wrote out here of what it was how the
[1:50:43] woman would be given a right to vote
[1:50:45] what has ruined this nation now listen
[1:50:47] not you Christian women women is the
[1:50:50] backbone of Any Nation now watch this
[1:50:52] you break motherhood you broke the
[1:50:55] nation to begin with
[1:50:57] you deny motherhood
[1:51:00] as your calling
[1:51:03] you're breaking the backbone of your
[1:51:05] home
[1:51:08] it has through the history what is
[1:51:10] American women used to be we went over
[1:51:12] to Paris to get Fashions now Paris comes
[1:51:14] over here to get fashion for their
[1:51:16] vulgar dirty way of living come to us to
[1:51:18] get fashioned what's happened the devil
[1:51:20] has stripped our women they take their
[1:51:21] clothes off each year they're taking a
[1:51:23] little more off now you won't do this
[1:51:27] you won't do this but you'll deny the
[1:51:29] position God has for you in the word and
[1:51:32] you take bits of your word clothing and
[1:51:34] you throw it to the side
[1:51:36] I say well I don't wear bikinis
[1:51:38] but you won't be in your position
[1:51:41] you're doing the same thing
[1:51:43] you're doing the same thing
[1:51:46] they cut off their hair which God says
[1:51:48] it's wrong where these little old
[1:51:49] clothes that the Bible said is an
[1:51:51] Abomination for God for a man to put on
[1:51:53] the Garment that protect a woman to put
[1:51:54] undergarment that pertains to a man and
[1:51:56] now you can't tell whether they're men
[1:51:58] this was 1960.
[1:52:00] now you can't tell whether men are women
[1:52:02] that's even worse today
[1:52:04] even worse today especially in the
[1:52:07] virtual world I'm actually thankful
[1:52:11] for people who use pronouns on their
[1:52:13] profiles because I can't tell and I have
[1:52:15] to message them and address them and I
[1:52:17] can't tell what they are so I have to
[1:52:19] say
[1:52:19] their name instead of Sir or ma'am
[1:52:22] because I can't tell
[1:52:24] it's an Abomination for God for a woman
[1:52:26] to put on okay smoking cigarettes hybrid
[1:52:28] is Right hybrid they don't even know
[1:52:30] whether they're man or woman that's
[1:52:31] right you can hardly tell what sex they
[1:52:33] belong to by looking at them and
[1:52:34] listening to them that's true friend now
[1:52:36] that's the extreme case and you say oh
[1:52:38] well I don't do that
[1:52:40] but as soon as you start to operate in
[1:52:42] the role of your husband or husband you
[1:52:44] start to operate in the role of your
[1:52:46] wife
[1:52:48] you're hybriding
[1:52:50] you're out of your position
[1:52:57] and by the position you hold
[1:52:59] are you the man or the woman
[1:53:02] now if we shipped away everything I just
[1:53:03] had a you know black outline a stick
[1:53:06] figure
[1:53:07] and the actions I want you to do this I
[1:53:09] want you to look internally into your
[1:53:11] family and ask you if you stripped every
[1:53:13] individual down to just just to draw a
[1:53:15] stick figure no indications of gender
[1:53:18] and you mapped out their positions what
[1:53:21] their roles are day to day
[1:53:23] who would you say was the man and who
[1:53:26] would you say was the woman
[1:53:29] you see we get all self-righteous and we
[1:53:31] say oh we don't do that bless God
[1:53:34] but at home we're not in our positions
[1:53:37] you know this is so so important and the
[1:53:40] biggest keys to that the biggest keys to
[1:53:43] restoring this balance in your home
[1:53:46] Saints
[1:53:47] it's forgiveness
[1:53:48] and humility
[1:53:53] this is our calling
[1:53:55] and I heard another voice from Heaven
[1:53:56] saying come out of her my people she be
[1:53:58] not partakers of her sins that you
[1:54:00] receive not of her plagues
[1:54:02] that same Spirit now this is Babylon and
[1:54:06] the harlots and the mother of the
[1:54:07] harlots right that's denominations and
[1:54:08] all of that but this same calling
[1:54:11] applies to message and people in message
[1:54:14] culture because God's going to pull a
[1:54:16] bride from the church why do you think
[1:54:18] we have message believers who are
[1:54:20] following Brother random as he's gone
[1:54:22] and they might as well be cults why do
[1:54:24] we have that
[1:54:25] because the message culture the message
[1:54:28] this what we've what we have created it
[1:54:31] to being that's not God that's the
[1:54:33] church
[1:54:34] the bride comes from the church so guess
[1:54:38] what you start to apply these principles
[1:54:39] in the description about a family even
[1:54:41] in message culture you'll start to be a
[1:54:44] bit of an odd duck
[1:54:50] God begins to deal with your heart young
[1:54:52] man young woman you go out to camps or
[1:54:55] you go other places to be with youth
[1:54:57] guess what there's some activities
[1:55:00] you're going to have to begin to not
[1:55:01] partake in
[1:55:04] because God has called you to a higher
[1:55:06] standard
[1:55:09] modesty is more than a dress
[1:55:13] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[1:55:16] God now this is just in closing this is
[1:55:18] just a scripture to remind us what all
[1:55:20] this is about
[1:55:21] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[1:55:23] God and it is profitable for Doctrine
[1:55:25] for reproof for correction for
[1:55:27] instruction in rights instruction
[1:55:30] did anybody shout tonight
[1:55:33] is anybody ready to run to the altar
[1:55:35] tonight
[1:55:36] it was instruction
[1:55:38] it was biblical instruction
[1:55:41] and that is exactly what Paul is telling
[1:55:44] Timothy here sometimes
[1:55:47] correction reproof and instruction in
[1:55:50] righteousness
[1:55:52] musician's gonna come tonight anything
[1:55:56] that is God's word is righteousness
[1:55:59] that the man of God which applies to you
[1:56:02] sisters as well that the man of God may
[1:56:04] be perfect
[1:56:06] thoroughly furnished unto all good works
[1:56:10] there's nothing left out when you say
[1:56:14] all good works
[1:56:16] and the only all who is good but God
[1:56:20] right how that how that scripture goes
[1:56:25] [Music]
[1:56:30] Sparrow heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[1:56:34] forgive me for keeping everyone a little
[1:56:36] bit long tonight Lord
[1:56:39] just felt that that attention was still
[1:56:41] there Lord I thank you for that Lord
[1:56:43] Jesus I know these things aren't easy to
[1:56:46] hear they're not easy for me to hear
[1:56:49] sometimes
[1:56:50] over the last few days we've had to to
[1:56:53] live this and it wasn't easy and we'll
[1:56:56] have to live it again tomorrow and the
[1:56:57] next day and the day after that and down
[1:57:00] the line we'll have to course correct
[1:57:01] again and come back to this come back to
[1:57:04] this word and begin to apply it to our
[1:57:06] lives
[1:57:07] but Lord
[1:57:09] my calling is to speak the word in love
[1:57:13] and compassion
[1:57:15] of course as anointed as directed by
[1:57:17] your spirit
[1:57:20] we answer to you God each one of us has
[1:57:23] to answer to you and we don't say that
[1:57:26] to put fear but May there just be a love
[1:57:28] and a desire and a Hearts to realize if
[1:57:30] we are an error we say oh god I didn't
[1:57:33] even know it forgive me
[1:57:35] show me because we love you Lord
[1:57:37] we love you we want to honor you even
[1:57:40] even if it means getting up and and
[1:57:44] making breakfast or even if it means
[1:57:47] rubbing her feet or sitting up with her
[1:57:50] late at night because she's struggling
[1:57:52] holding her close even though we're
[1:57:54] tired
[1:57:55] help us to be willing to make that
[1:57:57] sacrifice because we love you and we
[1:58:00] love each other
[1:58:03] Lord I realize as time goes on
[1:58:07] [Music]
[1:58:08] this subject is just going to get harder
[1:58:10] and harder
[1:58:12] for your your Saints to deal with may
[1:58:16] you give us strength father as the world
[1:58:18] at this point in time
[1:58:20] the prophet saw utter Darkness
[1:58:23] complete darkness he put a little sliver
[1:58:25] of light just to represent that there
[1:58:26] were Believers still today but it was
[1:58:28] complete darkness and oh God
[1:58:30] [Music]
[1:58:32] you've given me a front row seat in the
[1:58:34] career that you've blessed me with to
[1:58:35] see that darkness and
[1:58:39] some days it's crippling
[1:58:42] more to see just how far Humanity has
[1:58:44] fallen but God
[1:58:49] there's a
[1:58:51] there's a butt there's a junction
[1:58:53] where you say I have called a bride
[1:58:56] arise and shine or that light has come
[1:59:00] may we not just apply that father to a
[1:59:03] Victorious Christian Life and and how
[1:59:05] were the bride may we apply that to our
[1:59:07] families Lord and encourage us to have
