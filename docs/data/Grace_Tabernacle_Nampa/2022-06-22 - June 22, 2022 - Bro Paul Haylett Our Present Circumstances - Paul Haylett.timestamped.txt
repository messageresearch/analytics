[25:07] things to come to pass
[25:08] you know

[25:20] i'm glad tonight
[25:22] that we know
[25:23] our purpose
[25:25] i'm glad tonight that we can stand here
[25:28] and say it i know god placed me here on
[25:31] the earth today for a particular purpose

[25:53] thought i should i should well
[25:56] wonderful glad to have you here with us
[25:58] tonight god bless you
[26:00] amen well i want to a couple of things
[26:03] that
[26:05] kind of glossed over there one of them
[26:08] let's remember to pray for little
[26:12] diana did i say that right yeah diana
[26:16] uh she is i don't know if i understand
[26:18] correctly she's a little colic baby i
[26:21] was talking to brother vasily and he's
[26:23] like oh brother paul all the time
[26:28] and i was like we're gonna pray for this
[26:30] little baby amen that just whatever
[26:33] would be afflicting her will just be
[26:35] bound by the word of god amen and i i
[26:39] tried to encourage him as only men could
[26:41] and i said oh don't worry about it
[26:42] she'll outgrow it someday
[26:45] and uh so but we want it to we want the
[26:48] lord to just touch it and then we want
[26:50] to remember brother manasseh i'm not
[26:52] sure what all's happening in his life
[26:54] but anyway we just want to remember him
[26:57] amen i want to speak to you tonight
[27:01] uh on our present circumstances
[27:05] um this is kind of uh definitely a kind
[27:07] of a two two-part thing we're going to
[27:10] kind of speak on part of this as as
[27:12] something referring to and i pray that
[27:14] you take it as encouragement uh to look
[27:18] at our circumstances but we're going to
[27:20] touch on it and then on the second part
[27:23] we will actually move into a realm
[27:26] of where we are as sons and daughters of
[27:28] god and our present circumstance amen
[27:31] i'm glad amen not to sound you know uh
[27:37] you know like we're boasting but i'm
[27:39] glad
[27:40] that god has given us an opportunity to
[27:42] look beyond the circumstance we are
[27:45] facing day by day and look into the
[27:48] circumstance as it were now i'm using
[27:50] that word just a little bit liberal but
[27:52] b be patient or kind to me and and we
[27:55] are
[27:56] not called to look in the circumstance
[27:59] of today
[28:00] in other words if the wheel falls off
[28:02] the wagon that's not what your life is
[28:05] and so we are called as sons and
[28:07] daughters of god let's look into what
[28:10] god has made for us what he has given us
[28:13] as we have this lovely testimony i still
[28:15] have the lovely card that you sent me
[28:18] and
[28:19] i was marveling today as i was changing
[28:22] water and i i just find this so so
[28:24] incredible i was marveling we pray for
[28:26] your baby
[28:28] covet comes i haven't talked to you
[28:30] since
[28:32] but praise the lord we'll have an
[28:34] opportunity to talk
[28:36] so we look at our circumstance now what
[28:38] is our circumstance my circumstances god
[28:40] is present with me
[28:42] my circumstance is not a one of of life
[28:45] is falling apart life is failing uh but
[28:48] mine is one that i see god coming on the
[28:51] scene day after day stirring our lives
[28:54] answering prayers giving encouragement
[28:57] and look increasingly saints the
[28:59] scripture shows us how in the latter
[29:01] times that it would just be chaos on the
[29:03] earth and i think we must be getting
[29:05] close because chaos just rains
[29:07] everywhere but uh we're we're not going
[29:09] to focus on that we're not going to
[29:11] focus on the condition of this world
[29:14] amen uh
[29:15] not what the nations are doing in other
[29:17] words we get all caught up a war here
[29:20] and something there uh we're not going
[29:22] to be focused on what other churches are
[29:25] are doing uh we want to just uh
[29:28] focus on the things that god has for us
[29:31] and so let's just stand as we'd go into
[29:33] uh our bibles and uh we'll just
[29:37] go to ephesians the fifth chapter and
[29:39] the sixth verse
[29:40] and uh want to just draw a thought out
[29:42] of that this evening
[29:44] and um in this uh we know that the word
[29:48] of god is good for doctrine it's good
[29:50] for correction it's good for edification
[29:52] it's good for everything we need amen
[29:55] so ephesians 5 6 let no man deceive you
[29:59] with vain words
[30:00] now
[30:01] we live in a day i hope you don't mind
[30:03] if i just kind of make a couple points
[30:05] here we live in a day
[30:07] that people
[30:08] want to hear
[30:10] the good things
[30:11] correction is not in the house of god
[30:14] right the scripture says there come a
[30:15] day they wouldn't receive correction in
[30:18] the house of god
[30:19] so what people want to hear is words of
[30:21] encouragement how god wants to make you
[30:23] rich the house the pool the bentley
[30:26] but you see that's not what god called
[30:28] christians for god called christians to
[30:30] live the very life and nature of jesus
[30:33] christ in a world that is increasingly
[30:36] dark
[30:36] and so there's what the secret is he
[30:39] didn't come to say i'm going to make you
[30:40] rich he come to say i will save you from
[30:43] your sins amen
[30:45] so it says here for because of these
[30:47] things cometh the wrath of god upon
[30:49] children of disobedience
[30:52] be not ye therefore partakers with them
[30:54] for ye were sometimes darkness
[30:58] oh
[30:59] aren't you glad
[31:01] he doesn't just leave it there he says
[31:02] but now ye are light in the lord
[31:05] walk
[31:06] as children of light so he gives us a
[31:09] very clear directive
[31:11] for the fruit of the spirit is in all
[31:14] goodness and righteousness and truth
[31:17] proving what is acceptable unto the lord
[31:20] have no fellowship with the unfruitful
[31:22] works of darkness but rather reprove
[31:25] them
[31:26] now some people say well i i just really
[31:28] wasn't i'm not the kind of person i
[31:30] couldn't you know reprove somebody that
[31:31] was doing something wrong just live the
[31:33] life of jesus christ in front of them
[31:36] we're not here to go march up in
[31:38] people's face and condemn them we're
[31:40] here to live the life where people would
[31:43] come to a place and say there's
[31:44] something different about you and i'd
[31:47] like to know what it is and more than
[31:49] just know what it is would like to have
[31:51] it
[31:51] amen
[31:53] for it is shame even to speak of those
[31:56] things which are done of them in secret
[31:59] but all things that are reproved are
[32:00] made manifest by the light or whatsoever
[32:03] doth make manifest is light
[32:06] wherefore he saith awake thou that
[32:10] sleepest and arise from the dead and
[32:12] christ shall give thee light see then
[32:16] that ye walk circumspectly not as fools
[32:19] but as wise i probably didn't pronounce
[32:21] that quite correct
[32:23] and redeeming the time because the days
[32:25] are evil wherefore be not unwise but
[32:30] understanding what the will of the lord
[32:32] is
[32:33] let's just
[32:34] pray amen
[32:37] heavenly father
[32:38] lord i just tonight
[32:40] my heart is filled with joy father
[32:43] lord did you see right here witness of
[32:45] your
[32:47] answering of prayer
[32:49] lord jesus right in our midst and
[32:52] lord we said today
[32:55] lord
[32:56] recipients
[32:59] oh lord recipients
[33:02] of the greatest gift that's been given
[33:04] to mankind
[33:07] your life your presence your holy spirit
[33:11] poured into us
[33:14] lord never could we prove ourselves
[33:15] worthy but lord you chose to make us
[33:17] worthy and
[33:19] my heart is rejoicing tonight
[33:21] just ask you to bless your word father
[33:24] let us speak
[33:25] lord in such a fashion that bring glory
[33:27] and honor to you tonight i pray
[33:30] amen
[33:31] amen you may be seated saints
[33:36] amen yeah i know we had quite a few on
[33:38] the list of those that are not with us
[33:41] tonight but
[33:42] the lord be with them wherever they may
[33:44] be
[33:46] today
[33:47] amen
[33:48] i want to draw um from
[33:51] these thoughts here verses
[33:54] um
[33:54] 15
[33:56] see then that you walk circumspectly not
[33:59] as fools but as wise and so as we just
[34:03] touch on that we want to take the
[34:05] definition of the word circumspect
[34:07] it is thinking carefully about possible
[34:09] risks before doing or saying something
[34:12] careful to consider all circumstances
[34:15] and possible consequences now i want to
[34:18] stop right here in that definition right
[34:21] here we're going to take kind of uh oh i
[34:23] hope you don't think it's negative
[34:24] tonight but we're going to take the the
[34:26] opposite side of what we want to
[34:28] conclude with maybe next wednesday and
[34:31] look at this my brother and sister but i
[34:33] want you to consider the consequences
[34:36] of an active prayer life
[34:39] consider the consequences of faith in
[34:41] jesus christ consider the com
[34:44] consequences of trusting him with your
[34:47] life you see there's more than one side
[34:49] we say well we want you to realize now
[34:52] if you make a foolish decision there's
[34:54] consequences i think every parent has
[34:56] told their uh you know coming of age
[34:59] children look there's consequences of
[35:00] your decisions you know think about them
[35:03] carefully act before you do think before
[35:06] you speak and so we look at that but i
[35:08] just want to bring out that little point
[35:10] right there see then you walk uh
[35:13] circumspectly amen examining look at
[35:16] this what is this my life that i'm
[35:18] giving not as fools but as wise and and
[35:21] you see this it is to consider all
[35:24] circumstance possible consequences
[35:26] prudent
[35:28] it is
[35:29] cautious
[35:31] now as we look at this scripture here
[35:33] tonight uh you know how i am saints i i
[35:37] believe that uh as we consider all the
[35:40] circumstance around us uh we we look at
[35:43] that and and we look at the consequences
[35:46] but i i say and have held this my whole
[35:49] life uh you know live life to the
[35:52] fullest
[35:53] and you know people might say oh okay
[35:55] where are you going with this i've
[35:57] decided you know i've said that for a
[35:59] lot of years live life to the fullest
[36:01] but maybe paul needs to add on to the
[36:03] end of that a little caveat would be
[36:06] live life to the fullest in christ
[36:10] not not just in the cares and the
[36:12] pleasures of life to live life to the
[36:15] fullest you know that we got to go we
[36:17] got to always be doing something fun we
[36:19] ought to know there comes a time that we
[36:21] got to realize that what we really were
[36:24] called to do was to live our life the
[36:26] fullest in christ so you know you might
[36:28] tie that with the thought of every
[36:30] promise in the book is mine so will we
[36:33] choose to leave some of these promises
[36:36] on the table because they don't fit or
[36:38] lifestyle they don't fit what we wanted
[36:41] to do and i say let's not do that let's
[36:44] live uh life to the fullest in christ
[36:47] you know what that means though now
[36:49] forgive me i hope this doesn't offend
[36:50] anybody you can own a motorcycle and a
[36:53] camp trailer in a boat
[36:56] in christ
[37:00] you can play now it's not my sport but
[37:03] you can play golf if you want to
[37:06] you can do a lot of things
[37:10] in christ
[37:12] you see people get the idea and it's
[37:14] something very much being peddled to to
[37:16] the younger generation that if you're
[37:19] going to serve god you've got to give up
[37:20] all of this almost like you're being put
[37:23] in prison
[37:24] and you see i think that's just a lie of
[37:26] the devil that he's trying to get people
[37:28] and the idea that serving god is like
[37:30] going to prison but my brother and
[37:32] sister it's actually when you come into
[37:35] christ that you get out of prison and so
[37:37] by god's grace you know we get to come
[37:40] but you see every day my brother and
[37:42] sister
[37:43] as a christian we consider the
[37:45] circumstances around us you know there's
[37:48] times i was just talking with a brother
[37:50] a few days ago
[37:52] and uh he had made a couple statements
[37:54] and stuff on the telephone to me and uh
[37:58] you know i was like ah it's sad to hear
[38:00] this brother say these things but yet
[38:03] the next day he calls me up and says
[38:05] please forgive me for speaking these
[38:07] negative things you see along the way he
[38:10] told me he said when i got down to do my
[38:12] devotions and to pray last night my
[38:15] conscience said you know what you you
[38:16] were you were wrong in what you were
[38:18] saying you you didn't um you didn't
[38:21] really need to say those things and you
[38:24] see sometimes before we speak
[38:27] uh we need to consider this circumstance
[38:29] is this the right place and the right
[38:31] time the right people
[38:33] and you know the consequences i i know
[38:35] some of this will be a little silly
[38:36] tonight but just if you'd bear with me
[38:38] the consequences are if you go out and
[38:40] get in your car without looking behind
[38:42] you
[38:44] when you back up it's a choice
[38:48] and there's a consequence
[38:50] you're on the stop sign as it were
[38:52] there's a consequence and there's lots
[38:54] of signs you know i just want to bring
[38:57] this out i hope you see the humor but
[38:58] the point also so the other night
[39:01] saturday night brother andrew come
[39:03] downstairs uh we had a guest speaker
[39:05] this weekend and and uh we were filling
[39:07] the baptismal for uh uh uh vanessa and
[39:12] um you know a little voice spoke to me
[39:14] uh you you put something here to keep
[39:17] the hose that's filling the baptismal
[39:19] from moving but i ignored that voice and
[39:22] i got brother andrew up here and got him
[39:24] situated in the office and i went back
[39:26] downstairs and somehow i don't know how
[39:29] this happened the hose ended up and you
[39:31] know what it's like when you're looking
[39:32] there and there's a hose pointing up in
[39:34] the air in the middle of the basement
[39:36] floor
[39:37] and so the consequence for me and the
[39:40] point i want to make is there was a
[39:42] voice spoke to me do something about
[39:44] this
[39:45] but i ignored that voice and i'm here to
[39:48] tell you there will be no man that will
[39:50] commit a sin that will not have a voice
[39:53] speak to him in his life don't go there
[39:56] don't do this but we're not talking
[39:58] about voices in the mind we're talking
[40:00] about voices in the soul that speaks to
[40:02] the soul of men it is there my brother
[40:05] and sister that god is coming and he's
[40:07] dealing with us wanting us to live life
[40:10] he's wanting us to go and to do and and
[40:13] to be that but what he really wants the
[40:15] most is for us to listen to the voice
[40:17] so if we listen to the voice you know
[40:19] there's a lot of things that we can be
[40:21] blessed and kept from by listening to
[40:23] the voice and so you know many years ago
[40:27] i believe that was in uh freddie chile
[40:30] that the lord laid on my heart to preach
[40:33] to the young people on the topic of
[40:35] making conscious decisions
[40:37] and uh by god's grace that that has been
[40:41] a very beautiful thought to carry
[40:43] through the years and once again i want
[40:45] to just touch on that you see while
[40:47] we're living life to the fullest and we
[40:50] are living in our present circumstance
[40:53] it is something that is very real for us
[40:56] you don't even have to be a christian to
[40:58] apply this principle but to make a
[41:00] conscious decision you know sometimes we
[41:02] go to church young people i hope you
[41:04] catch this we go to church because mom
[41:06] and dad go to church but we got to come
[41:08] to a place in our life we go to church
[41:10] because we have a relationship with
[41:12] jesus christ and so if we just have a
[41:15] relationship that is tagged on to mom
[41:17] and dad there'll come a day that we are
[41:19] mature
[41:20] uh or theoretically or i guess we would
[41:23] go out and no longer mom and dad will be
[41:26] there as it would censor our decision so
[41:29] we need to learn as children as young
[41:31] people as adults to make a conscious
[41:34] decision what is going to be the result
[41:37] of this decision
[41:39] reminds me of a testimony of a man i
[41:42] consider him a friend and he told me he
[41:44] says paul he said you know i'm so
[41:47] thankful that the lord hid what my life
[41:49] would be after i got saved from me
[41:53] because if before i got saved he had
[41:56] showed me all that i would go to through
[41:58] as a christian he said i'm not sure i
[42:01] could have made that commitment but i
[42:03] didn't know that and i just made a
[42:05] conscious decision i'm going to serve
[42:07] the lord and he gave up his drugs and
[42:09] his alcohol and all of his different
[42:11] things and then as the test and the
[42:13] trial of life come along he was sharing
[42:16] how god would been so faithful to him
[42:19] that he would come face to face with his
[42:21] situations and in that by god's grace he
[42:25] would always choose i'm going to serve
[42:27] god
[42:28] there was reasons it wasn't as though
[42:31] his life had no reason to quit there
[42:33] were reasons to quit there were
[42:35] disappointments there were challenges
[42:37] there was health issues there was
[42:38] marriage issues there was children
[42:40] issues all kinds of things were given to
[42:43] come to a place given up i could just
[42:46] quit but something in him always chose i
[42:49] said i would serve you lord i will serve
[42:51] you it was a conscious decision he made
[42:54] not an emotional one not an educated one
[42:57] not something of reasoning or feelings
[42:59] but it was there that he just made a
[43:01] conscious decision lord i'm going to
[43:04] serve you
[43:05] now in proverbs 16 17
[43:08] it's a little hard maybe to read but
[43:10] the highway of the upright is to depart
[43:14] from evil he that keepeth his way
[43:16] preserveth his soul
[43:18] and so it's there in a conscious
[43:20] decision one would come to the place now
[43:23] life is reckoned as a highway and you
[43:26] know let's face it my brother and sister
[43:28] you go out here to the freeway tonight
[43:31] and you've got a choice you can go to
[43:32] caldwell or you can go to meridian and
[43:35] uh those decisions are revocable at some
[43:38] other point in time isn't always nice
[43:40] just to get on the freeway the direction
[43:42] you're going
[43:43] and um so i could tell you a kind of a
[43:45] humorous story about a uh a pair of
[43:48] truck drivers team driving and they
[43:50] pulled into um
[43:52] a truck stop at night and and it was
[43:55] time to switch drivers so they fueled
[43:57] and the one had been asleep in the bunk
[43:59] when they pulled into the truck stop and
[44:01] uh you know they fueled up washed the
[44:04] windows got a little bite to eat and
[44:06] they changed the other guy was tired he
[44:08] climbed in the bunk this guy gets in the
[44:09] truck does his little inspection clicks
[44:12] the seat belt pulls out on the highway
[44:14] goes down the on-ramp
[44:18] only he didn't know that the on-ramp
[44:20] until they're going along and about two
[44:22] hours later the other guy
[44:24] pulls the curtain back and looks up
[44:26] where are we sees a sign and goes
[44:29] oh no stop
[44:31] we're going the wrong direction
[44:34] you see the conscious decision
[44:37] sometimes is very unconscious
[44:41] he didn't get on a highway got on the
[44:43] freeway but he wasn't going the right
[44:45] direction and sometimes we think that
[44:48] that everything's okay you know uh it's
[44:52] there that god has chosen now i think
[44:54] this is so beautifully because when you
[44:56] look at the word just as we experienced
[44:58] this weekend was that not good
[45:00] amen that was just really really good so
[45:03] you see our way of who we are right the
[45:06] result of our conscious decision is
[45:09] expressed in the revealed word of god
[45:12] we're not going to go out here and take
[45:14] some kind of a
[45:15] socialist or some kind of that wasn't
[45:18] really the word i was meaning but you
[45:20] know theoretical or whatever taken
[45:22] somebody's explaining that we don't know
[45:24] if there's god well i'm sorry i know
[45:26] tonight there is a god i know that we
[45:29] have a prayer answering god a god that
[45:31] gives answers not only in the natural
[45:34] for healing or whatever it might be but
[45:36] a god that answers the questions of the
[45:38] bible for us and gives us a revelation
[45:42] as it were which is a revealed word
[45:45] brought out that we can see what it is
[45:47] and by that it changes our life but we
[45:50] have to make that conscious decision you
[45:52] see people can live good lives
[45:55] that's the problem i want to sound like
[45:57] i'm down on any religion tonight but
[45:59] people live good lives churches preach
[46:01] and tell people live good lives be
[46:04] charitable help that is all well and
[46:06] good you can live a good life and raise
[46:08] good kids and feel like this is a sign
[46:11] that you're in god's pleasure but the
[46:13] word of god says you're in god's
[46:15] pleasure when you're obedient to his
[46:17] word
[46:18] that's where god finds pleasure enoch
[46:20] did not find pleasure
[46:22] and pleasing in the eyes of god because
[46:25] enoch was the nicest man in the
[46:27] neighborhood enoch found a pleasure and
[46:30] was pleasing to god because he lived
[46:32] god's word day by day and did not as it
[46:35] were bring a reproach upon the gospel
[46:38] but just lived it out and he didn't have
[46:40] to manufacture that isn't that the
[46:41] neatest part don't have to manufacture
[46:44] it you get in the bible you pray you ask
[46:47] god to move you and in that realm right
[46:49] there god starts to work does anybody
[46:51] know what i'm talking about god starts
[46:53] to work and all of a sudden little
[46:55] things start changing in our life and
[46:57] where maybe we once had a fear it's gone
[47:00] we had a frustration it's gone and god
[47:02] starts to answer prayer and people say
[47:04] what's going on with you well you know
[47:06] it's kind of like the little room you go
[47:08] in there you come out what happened i
[47:10] don't know something changed in my life
[47:12] we cannot explain what god is doing in
[47:15] our life other than the fact that the
[47:17] things that used to be a deterrent a
[47:19] hindrance a mard or life are
[47:22] disappearing they're going away and the
[47:24] power of god starts to reign and when
[47:26] you ever have and i know you have pray
[47:28] to prayer and watch god almost instantly
[47:32] answer that prayer now let's not get an
[47:35] expectation that god's always obligated
[47:37] to instantly answer a prayer but it's
[47:40] there that when god speaks to you in
[47:42] these situations you know that you
[47:45] actually have a god's ear if you would
[47:48] put it that way you know god is is
[47:50] listening and cares about your situation
[47:52] and so it's there that it's not uh uh uh
[47:56] as though because we're good people now
[47:58] i just want to ask you i'm trying to
[48:00] break this habit but you know how many
[48:02] of us have ever when something went
[48:03] wrong decided god was mad at us
[48:09] i talked to a man one day told me i've
[48:11] been in church in years
[48:13] and he i said well
[48:15] why why would you just up and quit
[48:17] church he said because we had a need in
[48:18] our family and i prayed and god never
[48:20] answered it
[48:23] so he really didn't have a trust in god
[48:24] right he was expecting god
[48:27] to do what he wanted
[48:29] when he wanted it
[48:31] that's not really a trust right
[48:33] no more than giving your kids everything
[48:35] they ask for in life is a sign of love
[48:39] and i asked him i said have you ever
[48:41] thought that it was actually for your
[48:42] benefit that god did not
[48:45] answer your prayer
[48:46] and he basically said that's beside the
[48:48] point
[48:50] he wasn't willing see he thought god
[48:52] should just answer his prayer when he
[48:53] asked it now i want to just throw this
[48:55] out here if if you don't mind you see
[48:58] it's god's pleasure uh is in the
[49:01] expression of his word that's where
[49:03] god's pleasure is
[49:05] so when we are living to the very best
[49:08] of our ability right we're not talking
[49:10] about some legalist thing just toe the
[49:12] mark toe the mark to the mark but when
[49:13] we're living the word to the best of our
[49:15] abilities and we are there and we
[49:19] are living that out in other words if it
[49:21] tells you you know what you've got a
[49:23] temper in your family you need
[49:25] deliverance from that you claim that
[49:26] deliverance god comes gets rid of that
[49:28] and that becomes starts to become an
[49:31] expression of god's word in you and you
[49:34] have certain little issues or
[49:36] things as it is thorns in the flesh and
[49:38] god deals with that that's an expression
[49:40] of god in you and so as we'll see that
[49:44] now as a
[49:45] good times and blue skies are not a sign
[49:48] of god's pleasure and dark skies are not
[49:50] a sign of his displeasure but the
[49:53] pleasure that god has in you and i is
[49:56] when he sees us living his word
[50:00] my isn't that i'll bring this down those
[50:02] of you not a parent won't understand
[50:03] this but there's nothing makes a parent
[50:05] happier than when you teach your
[50:08] children to do a certain thing and then
[50:11] unbidden
[50:13] you look in their life and see them
[50:14] performing that
[50:16] now we can use a very simple example you
[50:18] teach your little one clean your room
[50:21] put your laundry in the basket
[50:23] and now if you have to go in there every
[50:25] day and boy i sure hope i'm not hitting
[50:26] on some of these kids
[50:28] but if you go in there every day and you
[50:30] have to nag your child
[50:32] to do that it brings a displeasure
[50:36] but if you go and look in their room
[50:39] and they have
[50:40] put their books away their toys away
[50:42] their clothes away
[50:44] parents does that not bring just a
[50:45] little warmth in your in your breast it
[50:47] just you know like yes my children are
[50:50] listening and so those of you don't do
[50:52] that start and so
[50:55] you look at this and some feel
[50:58] that uh you know if they're living under
[51:00] a sign of god's pleasure they have
[51:01] nothing to worry about but god wants to
[51:04] see his word manifested in you and i he
[51:06] wants to see us living out the word it's
[51:10] much more than don't lie cheat or steal
[51:14] it's to live out
[51:16] the very nature of christ
[51:19] through the word through you there's
[51:22] where it comes down
[51:23] that's that's where you can be kind to
[51:26] people who revile you that's where you
[51:28] can you can do good
[51:30] when evil is present
[51:32] and you can pray for those who revile
[51:35] you you know that's actually a lot
[51:37] harder than we think to come when
[51:39] someone is just almost evil to you to
[51:41] then lift them up in prayer and make it
[51:44] a priority to lift them up in prayer and
[51:47] remember them and say lord please change
[51:49] their life do something for them so it's
[51:53] uh this bible aren't you glad it's not a
[51:55] dead letter
[51:56] i am glad tonight this bible is not a
[51:59] dead letter there is not one word that
[52:01] pertains to a christian there's a lot of
[52:02] words in the bible that we're not called
[52:04] to fulfill
[52:06] you know that we're not called to go and
[52:08] join with the devil in the pit
[52:11] we're not called to lie cheat steal all
[52:13] these other things we're not called to
[52:14] be filled with these spirits of torment
[52:16] and anxieties and fears so there's a lot
[52:19] of things in the word of god we're not
[52:20] called to but for us to be able to
[52:22] fulfill
[52:24] every word of god that's been promised
[52:26] to us is going to take more than you
[52:28] have in you it's going to take more than
[52:30] your ability or your intellect it's
[52:33] going to take god coming down and moving
[52:36] in your life changing you and propelling
[52:39] you along
[52:40] reminds me when my son well actually
[52:42] probably all of my children but when my
[52:44] son was little and he'd say daddy i want
[52:46] to go with you to check water but you
[52:48] know you'd get out there and and it's
[52:50] just a child he didn't want to follow
[52:52] dad down the field he wanted to lead dad
[52:54] down the field and you know he'd get
[52:57] there and get a hold of a siphon tube
[52:59] and he would be trying to set that
[53:00] siphon tube and if i had waited my
[53:03] brother and sister till he figured it
[53:05] out we would have been there still well
[53:08] maybe not now but anyway you know and so
[53:10] what do you do you have to then come and
[53:13] you have to take your child in your arms
[53:16] and you have to go through all the
[53:18] motions with him telling him what to do
[53:21] will not be sufficient to teach him you
[53:24] have to go through the motions with him
[53:27] and i hope you catch where i'm at
[53:29] tonight god is going through the motions
[53:31] of living a holy and righteous life with
[53:34] us he didn't just say here's the book
[53:36] read it go live it he is here present
[53:40] with us each and every day in every can
[53:44] we say every
[53:46] every circumstance and he's right there
[53:49] with his arms around us showing us
[53:52] teaching us and and caring for us i
[53:55] couldn't tell you just to finish that
[53:57] little analogy i can't tell you how many
[53:59] times through those particular years
[54:02] that i had to reach out and grab my son
[54:04] by the back of his shirt to keep him
[54:06] from falling in the ditch and i'll tell
[54:08] you what i have felt the hand of god in
[54:10] my life keep me from falling so many
[54:13] times and that i couldn't even recount
[54:16] them to you because he cares and he's
[54:19] there and he says paul or whoever it
[54:21] might be i'm gonna show you what it's
[54:23] like to be a real christian i'm gonna
[54:25] show you what it's like to know my
[54:27] presence and and know what my desires
[54:30] are i'm gonna show you i'm not just
[54:31] giving you a book to read
[54:34] can someone say amen
[54:35] hallelujah see not a dead letter but a
[54:38] living word
[54:39] amen you see regardless
[54:43] as the scripture says regardless of our
[54:45] situation saints the keeping of the
[54:47] things of god is the preservation of our
[54:50] soul
[54:51] there's no other refuge we have we don't
[54:54] have a refuge in religion
[54:56] my brother and sister that's a problem
[54:58] the world has today they say religion
[55:00] fails you and i have to agree with them
[55:03] because if we recount and just go to
[55:06] back to the place that we start in
[55:08] religion we can be good whatever church
[55:10] you want to talk about but that will not
[55:13] change you
[55:15] my
[55:16] now so we want to preserve our soul do
[55:18] we not that's why we that's why we serve
[55:20] god that's why we come to church that's
[55:22] why we fellowship in the groups that we
[55:24] fellowship in is because we're desiring
[55:26] this preservation or eternal life of our
[55:29] soul now we know scripturally that if
[55:32] another branch is ever put out
[55:35] then it will be another book of acts
[55:39] it is not going to be another creed
[55:42] another dogma it's going to be another
[55:44] book of acts and so as we look through
[55:46] the scripture and we see what is
[55:48] manifested in the book of acts now my
[55:50] brother and sister as we were here this
[55:52] lovely time with brother andrew we look
[55:54] at this my brother and sister we say
[55:56] well praise the lord just paul paul's
[55:58] back in the pulpit
[56:00] paul's not andrew
[56:02] no andrew would already pass the 10 000
[56:04] words by now
[56:06] but
[56:07] my brother and sister the same god that
[56:09] was in the upper room is in this room
[56:11] and we just have to choose whether we're
[56:13] going to let the god that's in the upper
[56:14] room be in this room and do something in
[56:16] our life if we were in the upper room
[56:18] would we have chosen to completely die
[56:20] to ourselves and surrender and let god
[56:23] take control of us that we no longer had
[56:25] any shame
[56:27] any confusion
[56:29] any reservation
[56:30] those are the things we struggle with is
[56:33] it not
[56:34] how many times have we in our life come
[56:37] face to face with an opportunity to
[56:39] testify jesus christ and we tell
[56:41] ourselves that's not really the time
[56:42] that's not the place
[56:45] well i don't know where it is i mean you
[56:47] know i read a story here some time back
[56:49] where a man standing next to another man
[56:51] in a subway station asking
[56:53] are you a christian
[56:55] and the man says well
[56:57] i was when i was younger
[56:59] and the man says well how much older you
[57:01] have to be
[57:04] and he led the man right there knelt
[57:06] down in a subway station on the floor
[57:07] and people walking around and calling
[57:09] names catcalls jeers
[57:12] but he didn't care that's right he
[57:14] didn't care because there was something
[57:16] that compelled the man to ask the man
[57:19] are you a christian
[57:20] oh i can't do that's not the time to
[57:22] play subway station 30 seconds to talk
[57:24] to the men
[57:26] hey there'll be another train
[57:28] you'll make it home
[57:30] but you see oftentimes we give ourselves
[57:32] the reason why we can't
[57:35] not the time not the place
[57:37] let's not let that happen you realize
[57:40] satan
[57:41] now that doesn't mean we go on the
[57:42] subway station and you know ease them up
[57:45] to the edge of the tracks and
[57:47] you know hang them out over there you're
[57:48] going to be a christian or not
[57:50] that's not what it's about it's living
[57:52] the life and there was sincerity when
[57:54] the man said are you a christian he said
[57:56] i was when i was younger or whatever i
[57:58] said why how old do you have to do to to
[58:00] come back
[58:01] you see he never condemned the man he
[58:03] give opportunity and that's what we want
[58:06] to do that's what god's callings give
[58:07] opportunity and i think it's so
[58:09] interesting tonight you know
[58:12] in in times past as it is on a ditch
[58:14] bank we had opportunity
[58:16] our sister you know walking
[58:18] having a baby she's exercising a lovely
[58:21] time something i hold very precious in
[58:24] my life to see there that we have a time
[58:26] and stand on a ditch bank and talk about
[58:28] the things of god and how faithful god
[58:31] is and that he's made promises and we
[58:33] see an evidence i hope you don't mind me
[58:35] using this tonight but we see an
[58:37] evidence of god eavesdropping if you
[58:39] want to say on a conversation and we're
[58:42] testifying we believe god is a healer we
[58:44] believe he's a provider and we believe
[58:46] he believes in life and so we're
[58:48] claiming it amen it's not that we just
[58:51] say well whatever they say or what
[58:53] someone says or what it might ever be i
[58:55] believe a god who is a changer amen he's
[58:59] changed my place in life he's changed my
[59:01] position in life he changed my mind he
[59:04] changed my heart and i believe my god
[59:06] can change amen anything
[59:10] hallelujah
[59:11] oh but you see my brother and sister the
[59:14] bible saying another branch would be
[59:16] another book of acts but we have to
[59:18] become a part of the expression of the
[59:21] book of acts we can't sit back and say
[59:23] well praise the lord god's going to come
[59:25] down fill people with the holy ghost in
[59:27] the latter days and they're going to
[59:29] live for the lord and they're going to
[59:30] be witnesses praise the lord that's for
[59:32] them
[59:34] no it's for me
[59:35] it's for you
[59:37] i'm claiming my place in the expression
[59:39] of the book of acts because i am oh
[59:42] hallelujah can we say tonight i am one
[59:45] of them i am not just a person going to
[59:48] church i am one of them i'm a part of
[59:51] the economy of god in other words god
[59:53] made this circumstance fit we think oh
[59:56] i'm going through life and and my job is
[59:59] difficult this is difficult uh you know
[1:00:01] that's difficult you realize that god
[1:00:03] has specifically designed every
[1:00:06] circumstance of your life to bring a
[1:00:08] particular outcome in your life you say
[1:00:11] oh but i have had sickness i've had this
[1:00:14] troubles i've had that my brother and
[1:00:16] sister the word of god says that the
[1:00:18] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:00:20] of the lord and we can't take any other
[1:00:23] position or we're denying the word of
[1:00:25] god now if god said i want you to go
[1:00:27] down this path in life and it's not an
[1:00:29] easy path it's a hard path it'll be a
[1:00:32] challenge to your faith my brother and
[1:00:34] sister we ought to look up and say lord
[1:00:36] you put enough faith in me for it to be
[1:00:39] challenged it is not a pushover i don't
[1:00:42] need you to sugarcoat it as a song i i
[1:00:44] thought that was wonderful we sang that
[1:00:46] song and i don't need it sugar coated i
[1:00:49] don't need someone to
[1:00:51] and i have something profound for you
[1:00:53] tonight
[1:00:54] god is love
[1:00:57] no i want a god i already know i already
[1:00:59] know his love i want a god to come on
[1:01:01] the scene and he loves me enough he says
[1:01:03] and if i love y'all chasing you
[1:01:05] well well i didn't i didn't ask for that
[1:01:07] i was asking for
[1:01:09] the blessings
[1:01:11] well i would say that being chastened by
[1:01:13] god is a blessing amen
[1:01:15] you know if we're headed the wrong
[1:01:16] direction want somebody to say you're
[1:01:18] going the wrong direction come back
[1:01:20] amen but you see not our good deeds it's
[1:01:24] a word
[1:01:25] being expressed
[1:01:27] this bible is a living bible saints
[1:01:30] amen
[1:01:31] now i want to go right here
[1:01:33] in the
[1:01:34] chapter 5
[1:01:37] church age
[1:01:39] when any man turns from the word of god
[1:01:41] and joins a church
[1:01:43] now see to our visitor this is totally
[1:01:45] contrary to the business plan of every
[1:01:47] church
[1:01:48] on the face of the earth join our church
[1:01:50] join our church there's one church to
[1:01:52] join and that's the church of our lord
[1:01:54] jesus christ that body amen it is not
[1:01:57] something that we get special benefits
[1:01:59] and preferred parking
[1:02:01] oh come on i'm not kidding with you
[1:02:03] there's churches that if you meet
[1:02:05] certain criteria you can be eligible for
[1:02:08] preferred parking so you don't have to
[1:02:10] park way out there on the horizon on
[1:02:12] sunday you can park right by the door
[1:02:15] find that in the bible for me
[1:02:19] sounds hard don't it
[1:02:20] when any man turns to the word of god
[1:02:22] and joins a church instead of receiving
[1:02:24] the holy spirit that man dies dead
[1:02:27] that is what he is don't join a church
[1:02:29] don't get into organization and get
[1:02:31] taken up with creeds tradition anything
[1:02:33] that takes the place of the word and the
[1:02:36] spirit or you're dead it's all over
[1:02:38] you're dead
[1:02:39] reminds me
[1:02:41] it's an interesting story and i very
[1:02:43] much applaud them that um this took
[1:02:45] place
[1:02:46] i believe it was kansas
[1:02:48] on a sunday morning the lady was oh my
[1:02:52] paul recollect
[1:02:54] i believe the lady was
[1:02:56] 82 or 3 years old
[1:03:00] and she got an award from the church big
[1:03:03] plaque
[1:03:04] what not
[1:03:06] uh she hadn't missed a service in that
[1:03:08] church in 75 years
[1:03:15] y'all looking at me like so what
[1:03:21] hope you don't think i'm rude
[1:03:24] do you think that guaranteed her eternal
[1:03:26] life
[1:03:30] i think it's wonderful she didn't miss a
[1:03:31] service in all those years
[1:03:34] she their family moved to that church
[1:03:36] and she grew up she was a part of all
[1:03:38] the sunday school
[1:03:40] summer
[1:03:41] uh bible school and she got married in
[1:03:43] that church raised her children in that
[1:03:45] church buried her husband in that church
[1:03:49] but none of that makes any difference
[1:03:51] that plaque
[1:03:52] that plaque won't make any difference
[1:03:55] we've got to get something more out of
[1:03:57] church
[1:03:58] than on a word for attendance that's
[1:04:01] right
[1:04:02] it's all over your dead eternally
[1:04:03] separated from god that's what happened
[1:04:05] in every age sense god delivers the
[1:04:07] people that come out by the blood
[1:04:09] sanctified by the word walk through the
[1:04:12] waters of baptism get filled with the
[1:04:14] spirit but after a while the first love
[1:04:16] cools off that's what the scripture
[1:04:18] speaks of my brother and sister through
[1:04:20] all of those ages
[1:04:22] you'll see the same thing being repeated
[1:04:25] in the book of revelations 2 3 you'll
[1:04:28] see that every time they're coming to a
[1:04:30] place and then they start to cool off
[1:04:32] the first love cools off someone gets
[1:04:34] the idea that they ought to organize in
[1:04:37] order to preserve themselves
[1:04:42] well there's a way to be preserved
[1:04:46] but it's not by
[1:04:47] organizing and then telling everybody
[1:04:49] this is who we are
[1:04:51] right
[1:04:53] you see my brother and sister it's in
[1:04:55] the living word
[1:04:57] is the preservation
[1:04:59] it's in the living word that's burning
[1:05:01] within our soul that's changing our life
[1:05:04] day by day is where the preservation is
[1:05:06] at it is not in our attendance or such
[1:05:10] but you see whenever in the book of
[1:05:12] revelation speaking of this and the
[1:05:14] cooling off that is taking place the
[1:05:17] scripture says i would that you would be
[1:05:19] hot or cold because you're lukewarm i'll
[1:05:23] spew you out of my mouth and so god have
[1:05:26] more respect for someone who is
[1:05:28] completely cold like i don't know i
[1:05:30] don't believe there is a god then he
[1:05:32] will have for someone who is a lukewarm
[1:05:34] christian just going to church just
[1:05:36] going through the motions and so it's
[1:05:38] there that god makes it very clear to us
[1:05:40] get on fire get hot let it be real to
[1:05:43] you let it change your life give god
[1:05:45] permission to change your life
[1:05:49] not god's not going to come in right
[1:05:51] he's a gentleman he's not going to come
[1:05:52] in and force his way into your life
[1:05:54] we've got to open the door open the
[1:05:56] windows as it were say lord here take me
[1:05:58] i belong to you
[1:06:02] so they got to organize it to preserve
[1:06:04] it and they make a name for themselves
[1:06:06] and they organize themselves right back
[1:06:08] into the second generation sometimes
[1:06:10] even before then and they're no longer
[1:06:13] have the spirit of god just a form of
[1:06:16] worship they're dead
[1:06:18] they have high
[1:06:20] red eyes themselves with creed and form
[1:06:23] and there's no life in them now i don't
[1:06:25] mean to point at our little visitor uh
[1:06:27] uh um uh
[1:06:29] shy
[1:06:31] but shai is kind of interesting those of
[1:06:33] you met shai you'll know she's not shy
[1:06:36] and um
[1:06:37] but but it was interesting when shai
[1:06:39] first visited a couple sundays ago
[1:06:42] that she come and she says
[1:06:45] i've visited almost every church in the
[1:06:47] city of nampa and some of them the
[1:06:50] lights it was dark and they were in
[1:06:51] there and all things happening she said
[1:06:53] i didn't even stay five minutes because
[1:06:55] that's not church
[1:06:56] now this is not coming from us this is
[1:06:58] coming from i don't know
[1:07:00] i'll get myself in trouble here older
[1:07:04] that's the answer that's the way to
[1:07:05] describe it from an older lady
[1:07:09] that's not church
[1:07:11] she said i visited a church down the
[1:07:13] road here the music was so loud she said
[1:07:16] you know
[1:07:17] jokingly i'm almost a little deaf but it
[1:07:20] was too loud for me
[1:07:22] and i left there and i went over here
[1:07:24] and i went down here and i went over
[1:07:26] here and i'm because i'm looking for
[1:07:28] something where i feel the presence of
[1:07:30] god now it might sound like we're
[1:07:32] boasting my brother and sister and i
[1:07:34] don't mean it that way but when you have
[1:07:36] people looking for the presence of god
[1:07:38] and they're discerning the spirit around
[1:07:40] them and saying this is not the presence
[1:07:43] of god but it's got the name of a church
[1:07:45] over the door did that make any
[1:07:46] difference
[1:07:47] it don't make any difference
[1:07:50] the presence of god goes where he is
[1:07:53] welcomed and his word is open to be
[1:07:57] manifested in the people he's not
[1:07:59] looking for just being called god
[1:08:02] he's not looking for just something of
[1:08:04] that nature because it's there that god
[1:08:08] is looking for the life that he has
[1:08:10] placed in you to be manifested and where
[1:08:13] he is invited he comes and makes himself
[1:08:16] known people say we invited god to
[1:08:18] church but they have all of their
[1:08:20] different things that won't fit within
[1:08:22] the confines of the word of god you sure
[1:08:24] picked a knight to come to church
[1:08:28] they don't fit within the confines of
[1:08:30] this word and they want to call it
[1:08:31] religion and they want to say we're a
[1:08:33] church of of god not meaning the
[1:08:35] denomination but
[1:08:37] we're a church but it don't fit
[1:08:40] it won't fit you can't bend it you can't
[1:08:42] twist it you can't smash it to fit in
[1:08:44] there and yet they make that claim and
[1:08:46] my brother and sister i'm not being
[1:08:47] credit critical i'm telling you this is
[1:08:50] what the bible says this is what the
[1:08:52] word says and so it's there that we want
[1:08:55] to come and we don't want to have just a
[1:08:58] form of worship right the scripture says
[1:09:00] that they would be cold and formal
[1:09:02] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:09:05] power
[1:09:06] you know where the power comes
[1:09:08] oh certainly if we're going to sound
[1:09:09] important it's got to come from the
[1:09:11] preacher at the pulpit
[1:09:12] absolutely not the power comes through
[1:09:14] the life of the people of the
[1:09:16] congregation living out the life of
[1:09:18] jesus christ and coming with their lives
[1:09:20] washed by the water of the word desiring
[1:09:22] more of god
[1:09:24] not just a couple minutes to let us go
[1:09:26] but they want more of god i want to be
[1:09:28] more like god and so there what is it
[1:09:31] i'm crying out you could put it in these
[1:09:32] words counter type to this i want to
[1:09:34] have life in me
[1:09:37] lord i want to have life in me if i need
[1:09:39] to pray for my baby i want my god to
[1:09:41] hear my prayer i don't want to have to
[1:09:44] repent and recount all the things i've
[1:09:46] done wrong forever and ever before i can
[1:09:48] pray i know i want to live a life that
[1:09:51] if i have a need right now to call on
[1:09:54] the lord that he'd say that's my child
[1:09:56] that's my daughter that's my son amen
[1:09:59] that's one of mine right there amen i
[1:10:01] hope you don't mind me being so bold
[1:10:03] today
[1:10:04] amen now look at this what's happening
[1:10:07] is in this realm there is things that
[1:10:10] god has given to us
[1:10:13] to preserve us
[1:10:15] in our present circumstance
[1:10:20] god has not just left us here
[1:10:24] you know years ago
[1:10:27] been brought back to our memory today we
[1:10:28] had some visitors pass through town and
[1:10:31] and years ago you know jerry and i was
[1:10:33] in africa
[1:10:35] and uh
[1:10:37] i don't know what paul was thinking
[1:10:39] sometimes paul doesn't think
[1:10:41] that's a secret
[1:10:43] um
[1:10:44] but we had seen all these
[1:10:46] were those baboons that were in the
[1:10:48] trees when i climbed out of the rig
[1:10:53] i was like i want to get over here and
[1:10:54] take a picture of that big old dude
[1:10:55] here's this big male baboon up in the
[1:10:57] tree
[1:10:58] and i'm like i want to take a picture of
[1:11:00] him i opened the door and i stepped out
[1:11:01] brother gideon was our guide
[1:11:04] he's like paul get back in here
[1:11:08] like a good boy i'm back in the car
[1:11:10] what something out there
[1:11:12] what you don't realize is that baboon
[1:11:14] can cover
[1:11:15] that 50 yards between you and that tree
[1:11:19] before you could have turned around to
[1:11:21] even climb in this vehicle
[1:11:24] and then he wanted to make it real i
[1:11:26] hope this isn't too strong for anyone
[1:11:27] and he says it's only been a month or
[1:11:29] two ago that one of those ripped a man's
[1:11:30] face off
[1:11:32] i'm like lock the door
[1:11:39] that's the world we live in saints
[1:11:42] how do we preserve ourselves
[1:11:45] we get back in the word
[1:11:47] we stay in the word
[1:11:49] we don't get out we don't even give the
[1:11:51] devil an opportunity
[1:11:53] remember the story of the little girl
[1:11:54] used to be the dancer
[1:11:56] then she's walking stops at the door
[1:12:00] now she gave her heart to the lord
[1:12:02] and she meant it
[1:12:05] do you get that she meant it she wasn't
[1:12:08] playing games she meant it
[1:12:10] but she stopped outside the door
[1:12:14] and the music and all of the activity
[1:12:18] drew her back to a time
[1:12:20] that she knew wasn't good for her
[1:12:23] she knew it was death but she stayed
[1:12:25] there long enough
[1:12:27] when she come to her senses she's in the
[1:12:29] arms of some boy dancing in the floor
[1:12:32] and she comes back and says you know
[1:12:34] what i've sinned away my day of grace
[1:12:37] but she just needed someone to remind
[1:12:39] her no you haven't
[1:12:41] but let this be a lesson
[1:12:43] we can't go and flirt
[1:12:45] with the devil
[1:12:47] and not expect to get bit we can't
[1:12:50] expect to get off scot-free so what do
[1:12:53] we do we have to stop look at our
[1:12:55] circumstance my brother and sister we
[1:12:57] live in a world there's all kinds of
[1:12:59] temptations and the cell phone and all
[1:13:01] of this stuff has just made it that much
[1:13:03] worse
[1:13:04] and so it's there but we have to stop
[1:13:06] and look at that and say you know what
[1:13:08] the devil might you know offer something
[1:13:10] kind of beautiful you've got to stop and
[1:13:12] say if i do this what is
[1:13:15] the consequence
[1:13:18] now if we walk into sin
[1:13:20] there's a consequence
[1:13:22] and if you walk in to the grace of god
[1:13:25] there's a consequence
[1:13:27] we just have to stop and decide which
[1:13:29] one of these consequences
[1:13:32] that we want to face that we want to
[1:13:34] live in
[1:13:35] and i'm telling you saints and i'm not
[1:13:36] proud of this and i hope you guys don't
[1:13:38] throw me out on my ear or at least don't
[1:13:40] throw me out on my head i don't know
[1:13:43] i've made
[1:13:45] decisions
[1:13:48] and when the consequence comes
[1:13:51] i cried out to god oh forgive me forgive
[1:13:53] me
[1:13:55] but you realize we come to this place
[1:13:58] if we'll just stay in the spirit right
[1:14:01] live in the spirit live under the
[1:14:02] anointing under the influence and stop
[1:14:06] nothing has to happen that sudden
[1:14:09] what is the consequence
[1:14:11] what is the consequence of this over
[1:14:13] here
[1:14:15] i just read a heartbreaking story a few
[1:14:17] days ago
[1:14:18] a young man fentanyl is invading our
[1:14:21] nation
[1:14:22] and this young man had never done drugs
[1:14:24] in his life
[1:14:26] let a friend talk him into taking some
[1:14:28] fentanyl
[1:14:30] one time
[1:14:32] he's dead
[1:14:35] the kid who introduced it to him had
[1:14:37] been on it for two years
[1:14:41] but one time
[1:14:43] peter just stopped and said what is it
[1:14:46] i'm young
[1:14:48] and he he was quite a handsome young man
[1:14:50] i'm young i'm handsome i'm athletic
[1:14:53] i have good parents i if you look at
[1:14:56] what does drugs have to offer
[1:14:59] what is sin out here what does the world
[1:15:01] have to offer
[1:15:02] when christ said i died for you and i
[1:15:04] give everything you need to come and
[1:15:06] live in my presence see how slippery
[1:15:08] satan is so he comes and he offers us
[1:15:10] and we start to do this and start to do
[1:15:12] this and i find it so remarkable because
[1:15:15] i know grown men who slip into these
[1:15:17] patterns it's not just a child's thing
[1:15:19] grown men
[1:15:22] i mean i i'll just be kind of blunt
[1:15:25] i know of a man who recently just threw
[1:15:27] his marriage away
[1:15:30] for someone that wasn't half the lady
[1:15:32] his wife was
[1:15:35] never thought the consequence
[1:15:39] they towed us down the reservoir when
[1:15:41] our outboard motor
[1:15:43] blew up
[1:15:45] i was kind of shocked i'm like
[1:15:46] i know you
[1:15:49] but you see my brother and sister
[1:15:51] stop that's all i my whole theme tonight
[1:15:54] stop
[1:15:57] look around you
[1:15:58] circumspect
[1:16:02] what am i doing
[1:16:04] and what will it bring to me
[1:16:07] if i have devotions
[1:16:09] and read the bible and pray with my
[1:16:10] family
[1:16:13] what's it going to do for me
[1:16:16] if we play video games
[1:16:18] until we're exhausted and go to bed and
[1:16:20] that's the culture we introduce to our
[1:16:21] family
[1:16:22] what is the consequence of that right
[1:16:25] we just measure these things and and and
[1:16:28] since you know me i'm not trying to
[1:16:29] force no idea on no one but just measure
[1:16:32] every part of our life and hold it up
[1:16:34] circumspectly what will happen amen when
[1:16:38] i do this
[1:16:40] one thing i know in case somebody can
[1:16:41] enlighten me i have not found a negative
[1:16:44] consequence yet
[1:16:46] for putting god first
[1:16:48] isn't that amazing that you can do
[1:16:50] something like that devotions prayer
[1:16:53] with your family read the bible and uh
[1:16:56] you know do that and there's not one
[1:16:59] negative
[1:17:00] consequence
[1:17:01] in closing
[1:17:02] i just want to share something that uh i
[1:17:04] i have for years come across
[1:17:08] and and to i say this in in a realm of
[1:17:10] to each his own ev everyone can do what
[1:17:13] you want but you know you toss the
[1:17:15] television out and a guy a friend of
[1:17:17] mine the other day is like uh um
[1:17:20] well did you watch this and i was like
[1:17:22] no
[1:17:23] he goes well they're going to redo that
[1:17:25] here in a week it's going to be on hbo
[1:17:28] or something and you can catch it then
[1:17:30] and i said yeah i probably won't he goes
[1:17:32] are you not interested i said no i don't
[1:17:34] have a television
[1:17:41] he's like are you serious
[1:17:44] he goes why not
[1:17:47] and i said well for one i prefer to read
[1:17:50] and two i'm not hungry enough yet to go
[1:17:52] climb in the dumpster to find a
[1:17:54] cheeseburger
[1:17:58] and he says well you're sure right about
[1:17:59] that you have to go through a lot of
[1:18:02] garbage to find something good to watch
[1:18:05] anyway i couldn't help it he's good
[1:18:06] enough friend
[1:18:08] david i walked over to close to him
[1:18:11] and i'm like
[1:18:15] he's like what are you doing and i said
[1:18:16] well obviously you've been in the
[1:18:17] dumpster i just wanted to see what you
[1:18:19] smelled like
[1:18:22] but what is the consequence
[1:18:25] look at our nation i don't mean to go
[1:18:26] into the political whatever here but
[1:18:28] look at our nation they wonder what's
[1:18:29] going wrong
[1:18:30] we've been feeding our kids out of the
[1:18:32] dumpster
[1:18:33] and we didn't look at the consequence of
[1:18:35] feeding our children from the dumpster
[1:18:38] let's look at every decision saints as
[1:18:40] we close just look at what we're doing
[1:18:42] in our life
[1:18:44] you know i have to admit
[1:18:46] uh brother andrew's ministry touched me
[1:18:48] so much in a certain aspect of my life
[1:18:51] the other day it motivated me to do
[1:18:53] something
[1:18:54] and i look at that and sometimes when
[1:18:57] you go to do these things they're not
[1:18:59] easy to do but i with this thought in
[1:19:01] mind i looked at that and i thought you
[1:19:03] know if i do this is this good for me or
[1:19:06] bad for me well it was hands down it's
[1:19:08] good for me
[1:19:09] it's good for me i'm gonna step forward
[1:19:12] i'm gonna find the courage to do what i
[1:19:13] need to do because it's going to bring a
[1:19:16] positive result in my life and my
[1:19:20] relationship with my wife
[1:19:22] and it's going to bring me forward make
[1:19:24] me a better man so therefore i had to
[1:19:26] gather up a little courage
[1:19:29] and i had to go take care of a couple
[1:19:30] little things that needed to be took
[1:19:32] care of and in the end such relief
[1:19:35] such relief and i know i've done the
[1:19:37] right thing
[1:19:38] oh we'll just stop right here i just um
[1:19:42] just want to do this because there's
[1:19:43] quite a bit there's quite a bit more and
[1:19:45] it's kind of all tied together and we'll
[1:19:47] have ample opportunity i just want to
[1:19:49] bring forth um
[1:19:52] one
[1:19:53] one little scripture let's go to psalms
[1:19:55] 27
[1:19:56] and um
[1:19:58] you know i love
[1:20:00] this it's such a beautiful scripture
[1:20:04] a psalm of david the lord is my light
[1:20:08] and my salvation
[1:20:10] whom shall i fear
[1:20:12] the lord is the strength of my life
[1:20:15] of whom shall i be afraid isn't that
[1:20:18] lovely to be able to make a declaration
[1:20:20] like that
[1:20:22] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[1:20:24] foes come upon me to eat up my flesh
[1:20:28] they stumbled and fell
[1:20:30] now did david cause them
[1:20:34] to stumble and fall
[1:20:37] i'm not going to play trickery with you
[1:20:39] but yes he did
[1:20:41] and just be patient with me
[1:20:44] you know why
[1:20:45] it was david
[1:20:47] because if david had not allowed the
[1:20:50] lord to be the light
[1:20:51] had not allowed the lord to be his
[1:20:53] salvation
[1:20:55] if david had thought he could operate in
[1:20:57] his own strength if david had taken
[1:21:01] these positions
[1:21:02] he would never been able to make this
[1:21:05] declaration
[1:21:07] now come back that i've kind of put that
[1:21:09] before you
[1:21:11] no man can do this of his own
[1:21:14] no man has ever overcome on his own no
[1:21:17] man has has brought god on the scene
[1:21:20] right
[1:21:21] god called us
[1:21:24] god's the one who saved us that god is
[1:21:26] the one who's provided for us he is our
[1:21:28] sword our shield our buckler so i hope
[1:21:30] you caught what i was saying but you see
[1:21:32] it took david being submitted to god to
[1:21:35] bring that to pass
[1:21:38] if he had come as arrogant and
[1:21:40] rebellious he would have never found
[1:21:43] that favor in the eyes of god but
[1:21:45] because he did come in the way that
[1:21:48] pleased god
[1:21:50] when the need come in his life when his
[1:21:52] enemies my enemies and my foes come upon
[1:21:55] me to eat up my flesh
[1:21:57] they stumbled and fell and though a host
[1:22:00] shouldn't camp against me my heart shall
[1:22:03] not fear the war should rise against me
[1:22:06] that's the world we live in saints come
[1:22:08] on
[1:22:08] come on we live in a world where
[1:22:10] everything is just glorified perversion
[1:22:13] is glorified where evil is raised up and
[1:22:17] good is cast down that's the day we live
[1:22:20] in
[1:22:23] so there's the host what is it the devil
[1:22:25] camping against them my heart shall not
[1:22:28] fear the war should rise against me and
[1:22:30] this will i be confident one thing have
[1:22:32] i desired of the lord now you can take
[1:22:36] this any way you want but david did not
[1:22:39] keep that desire silent
[1:22:43] people say well i just i don't i'm not
[1:22:45] comfortable
[1:22:46] get it out
[1:22:48] make sure the lord knows what your
[1:22:49] desire is well he knows my mind and
[1:22:51] heart he wants to hear it off of your
[1:22:54] lips
[1:22:55] he wants your praise he wants your glory
[1:22:58] he wants you to lift it up he wants to
[1:23:00] hear your prayer even if it's a prayer
[1:23:02] of travail he wants to hear your prayer
[1:23:07] one thing that i desired of the lord
[1:23:09] that i will seek after that i may dwell
[1:23:11] in the house of the lord all the days of
[1:23:14] my life to behold the beauty of the lord
[1:23:16] and to inquire in his temple
[1:23:19] i want to ask you
[1:23:21] what is the consequence
[1:23:23] of this right here
[1:23:25] is there a negative consequence
[1:23:28] someone who doesn't desire god would say
[1:23:30] well i can't do this and i can't do that
[1:23:33] i can't do that
[1:23:34] well i'm sorry i mean
[1:23:37] it's fine i mean i can introduce you to
[1:23:39] tens of thousands of people that somehow
[1:23:41] have survived
[1:23:43] without that
[1:23:45] survived
[1:23:47] without going
[1:23:48] to the the flesh pots and the hell holes
[1:23:52] as they describe them they survived
[1:23:54] without that isn't that amazing
[1:23:56] they're not necessary for life
[1:23:59] and god has come and given us this
[1:24:01] opportunity to stop
[1:24:03] and take everything in our life and hold
[1:24:06] it up and say lord
[1:24:07] what is the consequence
[1:24:09] of this decision
[1:24:11] if i decide to serve you lord
[1:24:14] what would be the consequence of that
[1:24:16] lord if i don't serve you what is the
[1:24:18] consequence well i can show you
[1:24:20] what god said the consequence was for
[1:24:23] both of those
[1:24:24] tonight saints
[1:24:26] says jamie would you come
[1:24:28] tonight
[1:24:30] my whole thought tonight i just want to
[1:24:32] encourage you stop
[1:24:34] amen
[1:24:35] and look at the consequences

[1:24:40] but as a wise man
[1:24:48] hallelujah
[1:24:56] if you don't mind just a tad bit of
[1:24:58] humor i
[1:24:59] reading the scripture of redeeming the
[1:25:01] time
[1:25:02] and i'm redeeming about
[1:25:05] 10 minutes

[1:25:32] stand up and say look saints
[1:25:35] if you don't think this isn't getting
[1:25:37] crazy
[1:25:40] you don't think this is getting out of
[1:25:42] line
[1:25:43] you just look when it comes to all this
[1:25:46] alternative lifestyle stuff
[1:25:49] and lower courts
[1:25:51] saying the schools can do this the
[1:25:53] schools can teach this it takes people
[1:25:56] suing them and dragging them to the
[1:25:58] higher courts to finally overcome a
[1:26:01] school district a man was just telling
[1:26:03] me here a couple days ago of a school
[1:26:04] district back east that took their
[1:26:06] children to a drag queen show

[1:26:17] know they need to know that god is real
[1:26:19] they need to have jesus christ in their
[1:26:21] life
[1:26:23] but you see that's the world we live in
[1:26:24] so parents
