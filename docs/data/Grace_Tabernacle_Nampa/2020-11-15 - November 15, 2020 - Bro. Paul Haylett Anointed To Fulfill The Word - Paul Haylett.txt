listen to our hearts how do you explain how do you describe the love that goes from east to west runs as deep as it is wi you know all our Ro Lord you know all our fear when words can not express the love we feel but we long for you to hear so listen to our hearts and hear our spirit sing the song of Praise that CL from those you have redeemed and we will use the words we know to tell you one and awesome God you are words are not enough tell you of our love just listen to our heart your words could fall like gra from these lips of mine and if I had a thousand years I would still run out of time when you listen to my heart oh every beat will say oh thank you for the life yes thank you for the truth Lord thank you for the way so listen to our heart hear our spirit sing the song of Praise And War those you have [Music] redeemed and we will use the words we know to tell you what and awesome God you are wor on not enough to tell you of our love just listen to what our heart oh listen to our hearts hear our Spirits [Music] sing song of Praise that FL those you have redeemed and we will use the words we know to tell you what an awesome God you are WS are not enough to tell you of our lovee listen to our Hallelujah aren't you glad the Lord can just listen to your heart amen sometimes we as humans get so concerned that we say everything just right I can remember many years ago we were at visiting a church in the message and they asked me to come up and pray and I got up there and it was like I forgot English I forgot my brain shut off and I remember I I prayed and I went back to my seat and I was like oh my that couldn't even have made sense I just literally sat there for a portion of the service and thought Lord got up there and I just sounded like I won't use that word in the church I think you can imagine but you know after the service had an individual come up to me and say your prayer was exactly what was on my heart you see God's perfect we don't have to we don't have to try to get everything worded did just right amen like the little girl she just recited the alphabet when her parents asked her to pray and they said what are you doing honey she says well I don't know how to put the right words together but I thought if I just spoke the alphabet that God could put it together for me you know I just um uh we didn't um get this in the request there and instead of interrupting we want to remember our sister Miriam she's lost her mother and I can only imagine my mother's just down the street here and I can't go see her uh or haven't been in the past we'll try to the next few days um I guess they'll let us in I can't imagine being halfway around the world and losing someone you love I know there are those here that have experienced that and in the past and so we just want to remember our sister Miriam uh and uh just uh God would bring comfort and peace to their family uh that's just something we we want to remember and uh before maybe this isn't the right time forgive me but I just want to put this out um to those that are going to come to um our house this Thanksgiving uh with sister Jerry just like I would ask also if you could maybe just share with us um right your name on there how many you're going to come and what you plan to bring and so we just don't have chaos um so just a little reminder um you know Saints sometimes we um we hear prayer requests and we say okay we'll we'll pray for that we'll do that but I just ask if uh you would just sometimes we need a reminder if the brothers could put that first picture up on the screen uh this is uh message Church in Honduras and um this is after the water had already gone down enough that they could get to the church to take a picture not far from this church is Little Country Church that is no longer even in existence it's gone and Believers homes that were close to that church just simply swept away and so we see here that this is just a real thing and and this is actually from the previous storm and they have been hit again and uh so when you pray don't just give a momentary Lord help them in their need amen so if we would go to the next one this has come from our brother R Sorano this is in a suburb of Manila uh brother R shared a photo the other day out the front door of his house and the water was already over the wheels of the vehicles and then the water Rose another 3 or 4T and uh completely inundated the ground floor of their house uh this water here is uh 10 ft deep and uh there are believers who live in these communities so just remember Saints uh when we lift our prayers before the Lord that these are real needs these are not just momentary remembrances but these are real needs that we need to lift before the Lord and while I don't have uh any photo support of this uh I was just had the privilege to have a nice lengthy conversation with brother George a few days ago he sent his greetings to the church says God bless you Saints and uh just uh sharing uh needs in Venezuela uh it is every day I've shared this with you before but I want to drive this home to you the things they passed over in the garbage yesterday they're eating today inflation has has doubled the price of everything in the last 30 days so what you could buy with $1 us uh 30 days ago it takes $20 considering the fact that they have no money to start with this is a drastic thing so I just ask you to also lift up uh the Believers in Venezuela uh the people are fleeing the country in such a mass amount that uh Brazil uh uh Colombia uh uh the other bordering countries right there are actually now mobilizing their military to try and push the people back because now what's happening is every border city is inated with hundreds if not thousands of people they have no home they have no money they're sleeping on the streets they're begging and uh so we're seeing I don't mean to be political but we're seeing the aftermath of what the people in this country are voting for so it shows you how deceiving this spirit that is now coming into America is amen and uh so you know whenever and whenever we come face to face with with Satan and his lies uh I want you just to remember these natural reminders Satan has never brought life that's right he is always brought death our Lord Jesus Christ is identified scripturally as light Satan and his minions are identified as darkness and we can see it manifested in the world we live in amen so you see this so I just ask you please remember each and every one uh in these needs amen and uh you know lest we would get consumed by a spirit of fear uh we'll speak this morning uh a little topic on anointed to fulfill the word of God Amen you see everyone on the Earth today is Anointed my oh my it's good to see our brother manasse with us amen he uh uh has had knee surgery and is recovering but here he is in the house of God with us today amen not his normal Speedy self but um he is here and we're happy let's stand and go into the word of God thank you I really enjoyed this special I can tell you from my side of the aisle that this has been something that sister Jerry has uh had a real heart's desire to sing uh and uh I believe they they did a a wonderful job amen not talking about Talent see that's the thing Saints is let's never get off on the wrong track that it's about they hit every note correctly the spacing the timing everything was perfect but it's from the heart amen Lord listen to our hearts amen hallelujah well I want to speak to you this morning on redemption's manifestation uh anointed to F fill the word now Saints I know and I just want to remind you you know the little chart we put on this screen the other day we're not off of that we're still headed down that but you know um I just want to touch on these things then we're going to go over and touch on the other side of it and then before we leave that level we'll go back to this side of it because we want the reminder my brother and sister we don't want to stick our head in the Sands that we're all believers we're Christians we're the bride everything's hunky dory uh the wheels fall off the wagon once in a while but the God who created it in the beginning will put it all back in its proper place before it's finished amen you know just as a reminder my my father-in-law was at our house last night uh brother Kevin Littleton and I don't know if you'll ever listen to this or somebody to listen to it and I don't mind but I'm telling you he had a a a joy he had a a brightness to him a Clarity to him and uh we talked about the good things of the Lord Lord and uh so you know what if we get caught in the middle ground we can't see the end so we got to remember God said this is finished so God's on the Finish Line looking back at us and he's telling you're going to make it you're going to make it problem is is we're the one that looks at every obstacle we're look at them you remember a little story maybe you wouldn't but just a few years ago there was a man who just a normal man uh wanted to run the Boston Marathon and uh he trained for for the longest time running running running running running now you people who like to run uh personally I think since they invented the motor there's not much need to run but um those of you like to run would understand this man and he wanted to run this and so it comes his season his time to run the Boston Marathon and um you know is he's he's I don't remember the exact details but he's ran a long ways he's run I think uh over the 20 mile Mark and uh he had a blister and it burst he has blood coming out of his tennis shoes and his mind has reached the point get this now his mind has reached the point that he says I can't do this and he was telling himself how sad you know he's running along here or shuffling along how sad this is that I it's a heart's desire and I tried so hard and I'm not going to do it I'm not going to finish this oh this is why Saints I've been telling you lift one another up in prayer stand with one another a total stranger comes out of the sidelines throws an arm around this man's shoulder and starts telling him you can do it you can do it you are so close you can finish and you know they had already rolled up the banner they were putting everything away and carting it away when this man crossed the Finish Line amen there was no people there with news cameras and all of this stuff but he went away from there with joy in his heart amen right I finished amen amen oh Hallelujah and you know what he you know what he got out of this he got a friend that lived right there this man that was a spectator looked out there and something in his heart says you need to encourage him and he went out there and went the last distance of that race hallelujah amen look at this my brother and sister Hallelujah I don't want to get sidetracked today amen anointed to fulfill the word let's turn to Second Kings the 7th chapter quite a lengthy scripture reading so we'll read to a portion of it and uh be seated then Elisha said hear ye the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord those are powerful words my brother and sister so but we know right now this is not Elisha speaking tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekele and two measures of barley for a shekele in the gate of Samaria then a Lord this is a man of authority then a lord on Whose hand the king leaned in other words the king sought advice from this man this is not a physical leaning this is a man that the king sought advice from answered the man of God and said behold if the Lord capital L would make Windows in heaven might this thing be in other words he's mocking right questioning and he said behold Thou shalt see it with thine eyes but Thou shalt not eat thereof and now seemingly a totally disconnected event and there are four leprous men at the entering in of the gate and they said one to another why sit we here until we die if we say we will enter into the city then the fam is in the city and we shall die there and if we sit still here we die also now therefore come and let us fall unto the host of the syrians and if they save us alive we shall live and if they shall kill us we shall but die you talk about a serious position they come in because you see we like to live but they' recognized oh we'll we'll try to focus on this a little they recognized right what have we got to lose I want to just interject this to people who haven't completely sold out to God I want to ask you what's holding you back what do you have to lose because if you sit even here in the house of God and do nothing you'll die and if you go out there you will die that's amen what have you got to lose that's right and they rose up in the Twilight to go into the camp of the syrians and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria behold there was no man there for the Lord oh don't you love this it wasn't some leper my brother and sister it wasn't these people in a desate say it was the Lord had made the host of the syrians to hear a noise of Chariots and the noise of horses even the noise of a great host and they said one to another Lo the king of Israel have hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to come upon us Heavenly Father we just ask for your guidance today your anointing father let us preach the word let it be pleasing to you and beneficial to the Body of Christ we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Hallelujah and I guess we want to remember you know sometimes we just kind of Overlook things but to me each and every one of us presence is very precious or uh brother vasile sister Toma not here today our brother Ivan sister Nadia off celebrating an anniversary uh so that's a very very special thing amen we'll just go on and read a little more here wherefore they arose and fled now what happened was they heard something they didn't hallucinate it my brother and sister they heard something and wherefore they arose and fled in the Twilight and left their tents and their horses and their asses even the camp as it was and fled for their life and when these lepers come to the uttermost part of the camp they went into one tent and did eat and drink and carried then silver and gold and rment and went out and hid it and came again and entered into another tent and carried then also and went and hid it then they said one to another we do not well amen now I'm not going to bring this up again maybe a different service or something but I don't want to get sidetracked today I want you to understand that when you come to the word of God that hunger that was down in your soul the word was the only thing that would satisfied and when God gives that to you and he has given you a whole different countenance he's provid Ed your every need he's done your present and your future and he has even given you uh uh those things and you went and hid it in your heart now you did not do well if you just sat there without ever sharing that that's it if you sat there on that with those things and you've held it only to yourself you are right here in the scripture and you would have to look at yourself in the mirror and say we do not well to be reive such a incredible gift amen such a blessing when we were destined to die and go to hell and God said you know what here I I've already made the provision for you it's not anything you did it wasn't your ability it wasn't the word you spoke or the actions you took but I've made the way for you it's time for you now to share that amen and uh so they said to one another we do not well this day is a day of Good Tidings and we hold our peace if we har till the morning light some Mischief will come upon us now therefore come that we may go and tell the king's household so they came and called into the Porter of the city they told him saying we come to the camp of the syrians and behold there was no man there neither voice of man but horses tied and asses tied and Tents as they were and he called the porters and they told it to the King's house within and the King arose in the night and said unto his servants I will now show you that the syrians have done to us they know that we be hungry therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field saying when they come out of the city we shall catch them alive and get into the city oh my my brother and sister you look at that and realize how it is now look we can sit on that and we can hunker down and we can what I would call take this safe route that's it now sometimes in human uh reflection the safe route means do nothing that's right but if you've ever been hungry amen you've been hungry and something's been offered to you you can't get the idea out of your mind that there is something there to satisfy your hunger amen hallelujah for wherever the crumbs are the Eagles will be gathered no no no where the carus is hallelujah God didn't just offer you some crumbs from a table oh when you think about that my brother and sister how precious that is amen and one of his servants answered and said let some take now I laughed when I was reading this just felt like the Lord opened this to me it' be we we would need somebody to go out to the camp of the syrians and check out this rumor and so brother Trevor you're going to go just in case ass syrians are hiding out there in the grass brother Trevor you're going to be the one to go check I'm too important hallelujah oh my brother and sister amen that's not what the word meant when it said to prefer your brother Hallelujah let some take I pray thee five of the horses that remain they got down pretty skinny right there my brother in Samaria that was left in the city behold they are uh are as well as the multitude of Israel that are left in it behold I say they are even as the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed and let Ascend and see they took therefore two Chariot horses and the King sent after the host of the syrians saying go and see and they went after them into Jordan and lo all the way was full of garments and vessels which the syrians had Cast Away in their haste and The Messengers returned and told the king and the people went out and spoiled the tents of the syrians so a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekele and two measures of barley for a shekele according to the word of the Lord and the King appointed the Lord on Whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate and the people troed upon him in the gate and he died as the man of God had said who spake when the king came down to him and it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king saying two measures of barley for a shekele and a measure of fine flower for a shekele shall be tomorrow about this time in the gates of Samaria and the Lord answered the man see he's just bringing back a reminder and the Lord answered the man of God and said now behold if the Lord should make Windows in heaven might such a thing be and he said behold Thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shall not eat thereof and so it fell out unto him what this so it fell out unto him what was this the prophecy oh I hope you see this saint the prophecy the prophesied that the wheat and The Barley would be sold and it would be available able in such abundance it also fell out to this man according to the prophecy his portion that's right oh hallelujah amen for the people Tred upon him in the gate and he died Lord we ask your blessings upon the word today amen now I just trust this morning that uh as the Lord laid this upon my heart I could express it to you amen you know as we look at these scripture it seems as though the word words of the Prophet Elijah were irrational as it were to the people at that time they had been under a great Siege they had been uh uh cooped up locked within the walls of the city you have to be very careful when the enemy is at the gate to to to leave the gate unlocked that they just have free entrance right the prophet of God told us that if we uh wanted to uh not be affected I'm just paraphrasing this didn't want to be affected uh by the spirits and the things of this world to stay on under the blood so my brother and sister you stay inside the Gate of the blood and keep that latch then Satan has he can't actually he can't get to you amen uh it's when we open the gate and step out beyond the blood that Satan does that now I'll tell you my brother and sister that's a hard one to swallow sometimes because we actually say well you know each and every day there's this something happens and that just shows you the human element and how that by our nature we consistently want to do what we want to do so we have what we would call Life habits and we can justify them amen I don't go to church because the preacher just preaches the same thing over and over again I just kind of got bored with that well maybe you need to hear that same thing over again to remind you that you need to stay under the blood amen because our human nature tends to say okay okay and we go out and do what we want to do anyhow amen now look at this these these words of the Prophet Elisha just seemed irrational they'd been under siege the city Been Under Siege been under attack they had been facing an uncertain future now I want you to think when you go back and study history and try it to this scripture they had been eating their animals history has a very graphic account that they had resorted to even eating their dead children this is a desperate time this is not just hey we missed a meal this is coming down to the time as the scripture says they had a little handful of horses left facing an uncertain time things look very Bleak for the future sound familiar y Hallelujah we might not be starving physically today but the scripture said there would come a time that the people would be spiritually malnutritioned amen come a time that the word of God the presence of God would be absent from amongst them and I can assure you my brother and sister that when the spirit of God is absent from Humanity Humanity Resorts back to a beast nature it's that simple all of these things that are happening are starting to sound familiar now we must remember speaking of Elisha here but it it applies otherwise we must remember that any real servant of God it's not the man speaking it's God speaking amen and it's interesting because it seems hard for people to remember that sometimes they they they feel like you know uh we live in a day that that uh you know uh times of change we're a more of a cultured civilized kind of people uh you know the preacher doesn't need to PR preach so hard we we understand this and my brother and sister you see what happens when that Spirit comes the prophet of God said the problems that we have now prophecy would show us scripturally that that it is bigger than this but the prophet was making a point and he said the problem we have is weak pulpits you see what invaded the church started at the pulpit and if you don't think so just go read the words of these men of old quotations that are recorded for posterity when more than a hundred years ago a quotation was made they'll come a time that the people think they can come to Christ without changing it's fulfilled right before our eyes we live in a day it's identified my I said I said I'm a Christian where was the change I won't go into quoting many other things but I on occasion look into the words of toer and Spurgeon Wigglesworth some of those things you see the prophet of God as I kind of alluded to this last Sunday the prophet of God said they were men of God some of them even Pro taught the Trinity but brother Brandon was showing us how how in the season that they were in that's all God required out of them and that's all they knew but he didn't repudiate them as as false doctors uh of the Gospel he didn't uh repudiate them or whatever that was the light that was shining in that hour now I'm going to say a statement here I hope it doesn't offend anybody but my brother and sister if you're looking back to 1965 and and saying well this was this and this we've moved on time it's it's 2020 moving to 2021 the light amen is the same gospel but God is moving forward this bride is coming into a maturity amen we don't want to say being a bride typed as female we want to be a little girl my brother and sister it's only in a messed up culture that you send a little girl to be married amen amen no man brother Donnie Reagan drove that home many years ago no man in his right mind wants a little baby girl for a wife he wants a mature uh uh fool come to the fullness of who they are he wants one that knows what she was called for and more than willing to be a part of that amen so we're not looking for some little immature bride here amen so as we look at this we'll see that as time goes on my brother and sister you just look around the world we live in as time time goes on that doubters are very quick to speak and are much more vocal than Sons and Daughters of God oh yeah that's right they don't care where they're at what the circumstances is whether it's correct polite is what I mean to say or whether they're rude they have no problem you're wrong many times not even going back to the word of God God to see simply that's what's in them you're wrong I'm right you see how vocal that is but you see just because they are loud and they are quick does not make them right now let's just look at verse two if uh brother Alex will take us back there we'll look at verse two real quick here amen and um when we look at this he said then the then a lord on Whose hand the king leaned answered a man of God and said behold now now I don't remember all these little phrases of what it was you know we have all these breakdowns of of sentences remember that from school you had to take this sentence and you know they had all this line and a little line went up and it went off and another one went up off of that and and yes diagramming there there we go some of you actually remember amen uh so you know we we can diagram everything and try to figure out what should be there or we could take Paul's method of English and that is it said what it said amen so here's a man obviously learned I don't think he had a hick standing there giving him advice in in in his uh throne room if the Lord not when if the Lord would make Windows in heaven might this thing be see he's questioning even if God opened up the Heavens how could wheat and barley how could this come to pass I don't believe it now you see my brother and sister as a counselor to the king his words would have influence I want to ask you this morning who is your counselor right that's right can I rub it till you raw every one of you has a counselor amen every one of you have someone who exerts some form of influence over your life now I want to know is that advice bringing you to the place that you could look at thus sayith the Lord and say I believe it or does it bring a doubt that's it that's it does it bring you with a hesitance H once again who is your counselor might this thing be and he said hm no problem I got a response for you buddy you know that's how God works that's right amen God doesn't argue with you he just tells you how it is behold Thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shall not eat thereof see how quickly my brother and sister you got to remember Elisha is in the midst of the royalty of Samaria these are professing believers that's right and yet doubt could be spoke openly and given a measure amen come on now we should treat each other politely yes sir but my brother and sister we're also here to walk to the Finish Line together that man that was walking or started out running in that race down to a shuffle I hope you catch this when that man come out of the crowd that man later made a statement he said I I don't know why I did it I just felt to do this he comes out he puts his arm around this man starts supporting him and he starts speaking to him you can do it don't give up don't give up you can do it keep going you know you know what would have happened my brother and sister if that Runner that man would have turned and said you're a liar I don't believe a word you're telling me I can't do it what would the result be come on we don't have to be Geniuses to figure this out amen it was because he believed this man who was a complete stranger to him and that man says you can do it you can do it you can do it now how much more my brother and sister should we be able to believe when God sends those in our midst that believe the word stand on the word got a testimony in the word and they're telling you you can do it keep going keep pressing to the mark of the high calling you can do it oh if a man that knows a stranger could believe the words then how much more we as Sons and Daughters of God Brothers and Sisters in Christ should be able to take those words and say I believe it amen that's right right am but wait our pastor I know him I've seen his hindermost Parts sorry you got that close to me but if you're looking at Paul's speaking you might as well get up and walk out of here today because it won't do you a drop of good but if you recognize that God could use vessels that's right to speak speak to you just as a man from a crowd could come out feeling led to encourage someone that's right Hallelujah now this is not some Foundation that we're all just broken and you know just forgive me as I rob a bank and do this that and the other no no I'm talking about people that want to live the word I'm talking about people that care people that that lift these things before the Lord and ask God to open it to them amen hallelujah amen you see how that the negative was able to be expressed but the word of God said God always corrects the air so he was not going to leave those words that were spoken unresponded that's right H that's right my goodness you see Elisha prophesied that it would come to the place for the wheat and the bar I say wheat and barley it's flour they make flour out of wheat excuse me as a farmer I don't think about flow I think about what it took to make the flower see sure as that was prophecy the continuation of the prophecy declared you'll see it but never get to experience I want you to come down Saints look this morning a little direct to you but I want you to come down and realize there'll be many people around this message that will see this word as they were singing We Shall do Miracles I tell you people say well where is it where is it I'm sorry you can't see it it was prophesied that would we do greater things than this and it is coming to pass but some cannot see it amen that's right does that mean we're special Hallelujah I'm so special no it's God's grace God's grace come down but see the prophecy of the word says that these things will happen but there'll be those that eyes cannot see and ears cannot hear do you understand right here is a perfect example of that that man saw how that the flour and The Barley was worth and he saw this great thing come to pass but there he is by the very people that were delivered right became his judgment cuz they trampled him right in the gate now tell me my brother and sister as we move into our thought now tell me that God did not orchestrate the king appointing him the master of the gate otherwise he'd have been in the crowd running out the gate but he's appointed the master of the gate right what was it just in case the enemy come he was responsible for the gate to get closed and locked but that become his death now let's look at this I need to move on today hallelujah amen do you realize my brother and sister doubters never obtain the promise amen yeah that's right but let's go to our real Focus this morning amen let's just go as it were and touch on those scriptures in verse three if you would brother Alex bring that it is up there okay excuse me now look at this my brother and sister our real Focus this morning is actually going to be upon these four lepers now we understand that leprosy was a disease that caused the people to be an outcast they were not allowed to live live in their own home amongst their own family amongst the neighborhood but they were then put outside of the city whether it was a walled City or just a city they were they were put out and you know not very much of a bright future for someone with Leprosy and imagine now as you would be in life and you have leprosy and it's started now to literally eat your fingers and your hands and your toes and uh a nose and ears you're marked you're marked by leprosy big sores the uh beginning of it is sores appearing on the body uh left unchecked now in modern times we have ways to deal with that and and uh but my brother and sister even in modern times the after effect of leprosy still leaves its Mark upon the people amen so you look at this he's here's these four men and they are outside of the city and they're at the gate and uh they are lepers they they have no way my brother and sister to just move into the city move into back into their normal life and they are there and now this this assault or siege that is upon Samaria uh has had an effect upon them they can't go as we see in the scripture they can't go in they can't go out they're just trapped there and they're starving just like everyone else so now my brother and sister sometimes uh you know as brother Brown really preached this drove it home to us we need to cast down our reasonings but we need a balance to that amen you can't just do that because the scripture says come let us reason together so you it is as though you cannot come and Ponder and discuss the things of the word but it's when we start to rely on what we think amen that we have a council amen we have a group of people who now run the message or run our church or run the denomination and and whatever they say contrary to the word of God or not we follow that you see my brother and sister that's not how God works the prophet of God says look God has never come down to a council he's never come down to a group he always comes down to individual ual amen and so they are there and they are reasoning together if I could just put that to you this morning and they're looking at their options and I I I just love how this is I I would actually have liked to have met these men because they had very good deductive reasoning amen might have been a simple equation they're dealing with but they're like you know what hey we go in there we just starve to death with them and we stay right where we're at and we just starve to death on the the other side of the gate from them so what do we got to lose if we go down here to these syrians and and and they're here this big vast Army and and they they got Siege on this city you know it wasn't some couple little tents out here with a couple centries this is a vast Army that is there uh laying Siege and and you know I I just love their reasoning amen they're just like you know what we go there we die we stay here we die and so what we're going to do is we're going to just go down here and if they would be one of compassion in these syrians they would say these poor guys they're no threat to us we'll throw them some scraps and they're like let's go down there and if we live we live but what's the worst thing they can do to us we die reminds me of a story I read once I don't remember now what country was but these people were making a threat to a missionary they're like we're going to kill you other people down slobbering sobbing spare our life spare our life they come to this one man and they're like we're going to kill you praise the Lord what do you mean praise the lord well I've spent my whole life trying to get to heaven maybe God sent you to help me get there sooner than I thought they're like what is wrong with you but do you see the difference in the nature the reaction something that had happened this man knew where his real life was he knew they did not control his life he didn't need to beg them cuz you know what he was doing he'd be begging the devil to spare his life and the devil is not the one who gives you life it's God that controls life Hallelujah another story that goes with that where they put the gun against the man's head and pulled the trigger and then it it doesn't go off and he pulls a trigger again it doesn't go off pulls the trigger again it doesn't go off dumps the shells out and every one of those shells had an indentation on the primer and then they even caught a revelation you're not supposed to die come on my brother and sister you know what I'm going to just go down here amongst the syrians which was their enemy and we're going to go and if they have compassion we'll live and if they don't hey what's going to happen we're going to die but we was going to die anyhow so no problem here I love their deductive reasoning oh God give us the courage if it had ever come to that in this country that we would stand there look at it and say thank you God ordained you to promote me to glory amen hallelujah so as they do that they come down now into to the host of the syrians and and um you know what they were following without realizing my brother and sister I I want you to catch this now because we're we're talking about being anointed to f fulfill the word of God is is these four lepers in their reasoning we go there we die we stay here we die let's go down and see if we can find compassion amongst the syrians what they didn't realize is God was anointing them amen in their in their flesh all they were thinking is we are emaciated we are starving to death and and what is the worst thing they can do put us out of our misery what they didn't realize is the anointing of almighty God had come down upon them and as they are reasoning this out it made their decision of such Stark Clarity that they didn't say we'll think about it or we might try and survive another day they the reasoning became so Crystal Clear to them they turn and start going to the syrians camp and little did they know at the time that they were fulfilling a prophecy oh I hope you catch this Saints we look at this oh why did I go here I made a decision and and it turned out to be a bad decision and it took me around over here and it brought me here and I went this way and I went that way and then we'll say well maybe I was just in God's permissive will or maybe it was God's anointing on your life that you needed to sit in a job in a machine or in a warehouse and look somebody in the face and say you know there was a time I serve God and and I slid away from him and I've not been happy since and something strike you and say that's it I was happy when I served the Lord and cause that man to pull back and look around himself and say you know what I've got to do if I stay here I will die in this position if I go back over here where I was as a borderline believer I will die there I need to get back to Christ I need to get back to the word hallelujah I was just reading I I was going to make a sermon out of it but I'm going to share it with you the prophet of God I I it's more than one place amen but the prophet of God says there now you know it is a son of man right we know that to be the prophet right amen introducing us to the son of man we understand that's Jesus Christ but the prophet goes on to say the son of man is the word that's right oh what was it my brother and sister you see not that you got to find a man somewhere standing in the shadows even though we sing the songs and talk about those things when the the son of man made the introduction to bring us back into the word you get fully in the word are you with me fully in the word and you have come in the presence of Jesus Christ people are like I'd like to see the Lord get in the word Christ has manifested in his word and he doesn't want to just stay in the word he wants to get into you that the word might live through you oh Hallelujah is it all right to be excited this morning hallelujah amen amen they were being led they were being influenced of the Lord to fulfill this prophecy but look at this in fulfilling this prophecy the word they found life for themselves amen that's right that's right I've heard people people I know I know them fairly well breaks your heart actually since I come to the message just been turmoil well Hallelujah whether you serve God or you don't Life's a battle I'm sorry people are out here what are they turning into alcoholics often times to drown their disappointment of the expectations they had of their own life that never come to pass so they start drowning that and Destroy whatever relationships they had I tell you my brother and sister I'd rather live in a mud hut I I apologize to the Lord I apologize this church I fight with the nature that Paul has to push as it were to gain ground to be successful to to acquire I have to fight against that some might have to fight against Pride or whatever it might beely whatever has driven me since I was a young boy to just press and press and press had a man some time back look at me I I made a I hope you see the humor in this I made a little vow to myself that I wasn't throwing this one pair of work boots away until this year was completely done the toes are wore out they're cracked out the sides I don't dare walk in deep anything because it'll be inside the boots and and the other day here while back I had that pair of boots on and I was wearing a pair of of uh uh Dicky work pants that uh uh are older than some of our children here and they're completely wore out in the front and I said I ain't throwing them away until this year is done and uh this guy looked at me and he just smiled shook his head he says my Paul he said you look like the poorest person I know I don't really care what my looks are you see that's not it my brother and sister I'm not we're not here to impress each other right I look the most believer like in our whole church what does that mean what does it it means nothing you see it's not that we look like the believer but are we a Believer that's the difference it's not how well we talk the talk is how well we can walk that walk right and it's not like we walk the walk by some training to impress everyone that's you know cuz the man just pardon me we're a little off our notes but I tell you uh you you you don't want to be that man you know but brother Trevor he's my friend so he's good here and close brother Trevor says something my first instinct is I'll tear his throat out but because I've been trained so well I'm just like God bless you brother Trevor but you see inside that's it my mind's eye has his jugular in my hand and then I'm standing on him telling him I'm better than you oh my brother and sister it better be real inside of us that someone insults you and your prayer from your heart is God help my brother amen that's right cuz you see talking about the deceiver it says that inside they are ravening wolves oh don't go running around looking for something with a long nose and big teeth and pointy ears and beady eyes cuz the ravenous wolf is hiding on the inside that's right oh Goden oh God help us don't let it be a surface conversion hallelujah oh my amen you see so it is for the day that we live in my brother and sister if I could express this it is in the word coming to pass that you and I find life for ourself amen it is not oh I I know some folks think I'm really hard on the message and that I might be headed out you know because I have some friends that quit now I don't want to go back there or whatever but I had people even without talking to me brother Jason sister Emy know what I'm talking about I preached a sermon up in Canada one time about fables there were some that went out from church that day and said he's following the rest of them he'll leave the message what they didn't catch was the season for us believing stories and when I say this I'm not discounting the stories but placing the story as a Foundation of your salvation I'm not for us looking back and saying look what God did for the prophet praise the Lord I'm saved what is it we got to have Brother David a new birth I don't care my brother and sister how well you know the birth dates of the prophet and his wife and children and when this happened here and when he visited here and when this and that and whatever those dates mean nothing my brother and sister that's us borderlining on believing fables we're believing that because somehow we memorized all this stuff that we've got the blood of Jesus Christ covering no my brother and sister it's a new birth that covers Us and if you can't remember your own mama's birthday or your own birthday it won't matter if you got the Holy Ghost right and I don't say that to be critical but I'm telling you it's coming to A Time my brother and sister that we got to realize that it is in the coming of the P coming to pass of the word of God in you and I that it'll be there as we have handled the scripture says as we have handled the word of life amen that's right that's what makes the difference anything else come on Amen reminds me of a time I wasn't there but I know men that were there and a man got up to give a testimony in church and he said I had a dream he had a dream I had a dream that I was there in heaven and I was walking along and I saw this and I did this and I spoke to you and I I spoke to you wait you skipped over me what you know what people gobbled it up that's right all of a sudden people people were like well we were part of this dream but did you know that on full an analyzation of the dream there was not one bit of spiritual significance that's it it was though oh my this is going to be difficult for me to use for an analogy but it was me and my four and no more that's scriptural isn't it no you see it's the word that's sharper than the two-edged sword it's what does the Discerning the separating that's not how I feel that's right that's right not how I feel now I actually realized I left part of it and you might realize that I left part of that dream out because it's so blunt that I'm not sure some of you could handle it and I do not like the smell of burning hair so um some things are just so blunt well maybe you guys can handle it can you handle it yes and he saw himself there in heaven as companion with another man's wife come on I don't care about your dream that's right I don't care about your dream what did the word say that's it you know what it tells you he'd been coveting In the Flesh natural exactly right and he was wishing it was so Amen on the other side God help us amen God help us amen see my brother and sister in the word coming to pass we find life for oursel and you realize the prophet of God's own words this is not Paul's words these are a prophet of God's words we cannot live in the light of another age amen we can't live under old Mana no now I know people around the message and I'm sorry for being blunt but I know people around the message that are are are so caught up that it has to be back it has to be back go back look back look back what about the fresh Mana where the prophet of God made the Declaration let this be a fresh Revelation to you today amen amen this is the word being open day by day is it a new gospel a new message a different gospel or message no it isn't but it's the gospel that was sent to you and I opened made fresh every day Hallelujah you know the wonders of sourdough it's really interesting sister Kristen take shared with my wife uh uh some sourdough I've never really been around sourdough you know it's kind of just uh you hear the phrase you know uh uh crusy sourdough pancakes but you just pour it out of a bag and put water and maybe an egg and hey you got sourdough no it's not the real thing we now have the real thing foaming up on our countertop it looks weird it looks grungy it looks like we're supposed to eat this thing it tastes so good that's right that's right you see it's not always what is beautiful sometimes this gospel is messy that's it it's not how big a church look what the prophet he preached about these big churches and look what's happening even in the message big fine multi-million dollar I'm not speaking down on that I'm not criticizing no one but we're not exempt my brother and sister so as you look at this I'm getting sidetracked Hallelujah you see we can't live in the light of another age in the old Mana you see because we're living in an open book that's right and the open book is bringing more word of fresh Revelation and when I mean fresh Revelation that means it's not old stuff but it's made new to you and I every day Hallelujah I don't remember the message book I was reading just the other day and as I was reading it I I've I've been in three or four this uh three this last short period of time but I was reading it I I I thought my this was preached in 1963 it could have been preached 2020 maybe September or October that's how fresh it was you see it wasn't an old Revelation it was fresh because everything that was spoke right there was relevant right here today and especially relevant in my life and part of that was the prophet of God talking about God loves you so much he'll spank you amen and it's hard to say Thank You Lord when you've been spanked but in the end the result is beautiful Hallelujah you see this open book is the word for our day amen see my brother and sister what was happening now if you was one of these lepers or even those inside the gates of Samaria uh how much good would it do you to live on the memory of a past meal lepers hanging outside the gate right there just hoping somebody will feel bad accidentally throw something out or I remember Thanksgiving 2019 my wife cooked a 21 lb prime rib it was so good it was so good I remember I went back for seconds and thirds and I also remember when I looked back again my son-in-law was eating the last piece and I was like that's not fair and about that time your stomach would growl and you'd be caught in a hunger Pang that would pull you down that memory did not do one thing for for you the prophet of God talks about coming to a man who is cold and weary and giving him a painted fire yeah that's it and telling him be warmed and go your way it won't do that person one bit of good oh but when you have a prophecy that's right when you have the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord I have no idea how God will bring it to pass I have no way that this could come there's just seems like no single way but something down in your heart and soul reaches out and says I didn't say it the king didn't say it and the King's helper didn't know what he was talking about but it's there but you see God took the lepers a step further they didn't even know I don't know the scripture doesn't show us but for sake today I'm going to tell you they didn't even know of the prophecy that's right they were just LED that's right I'm going down here to this Camp I'm going to go down here because I either get to live or die at that camp it won't be drawn out no more hunger pains oh Hallelujah now look at this Revelations 22:17 amen amen I don't remember if I put that I guess I did amen now look my brother and sister the promise of Prophecy I want you to read this scripture right here and realize that 2217 is a fulfillment of the promise of Prophecy amen because you see it's not just a spirit any longer but there's a bride who is fed on the body word of God which is the Gospel of Jesus Christ and she's fed on that until it has become so real to her she doesn't have to look back to another year she doesn't have to look back 15 20 30 40 years I'm just talking about life they don't have to look back on the time I was on fire for God they're on fire for God right now amen they don't have to look back and dream of a different day when all was so good my children were little and they just did everything I want to do well get your children under the blood of Jesus Christ pray for them like they were dying because they areen and when you catch that you'll be one with the spirit and the spirit and the bride say come and let him did anybody hear anybody hear this gospel we're not just sloping along here and him that H and who's thirsty that's it amen there's a difference who's thirsty and whosoever will so you didn't even have to hear so to speak you didn't have to be a thirst so to speak amen but you have a will to serve God you have a will to fulfill the word of God that means my brother and sister can I interpret it the Paul way here amen you might not be the most spiritual person and you might not be able to go 5 years from now and remember brother so and so preached on this and this and you might not be able to do all of these kind of things quote scripture quote quotes off the top of your head but something down inside of you something that God placed in there wants to serve God so it's so strong and you might some people say you know he's almost illiterate he's almost this he's almost that he's almost oh pardon me for using that but he's almost a but something down on the inside that's it oh there's no IQ chart to get into heaven Hallelujah and something down in the side that's so strong Lord I want to serve you amen it says let him take of the Water of Life freely what happens when he takes that starts saying come that's it come right them little lepers they were down there imagine brother Trevor prime rib everything you desire amen they're there they're eating they're drinking and they're out here nobody will find this big mound of sand where I pile this big chunk of gold and they're just doing it and something come upon them we're not doing right we need to share this what was it anointed to fulfill the prophecy amen oh aren't you glad today we've been anointed Saints we're not just some religious people we've been anointed of almighty God to fulfill the prophecy oh hallelujah hallelujah I'm trying to prune this down a little bit I don't know who steals the time from me Hallelujah and brother Alex says hey there ain't much on this page well I tell you sometimes you don't need much on this amen but I want you to see this now these poor lepers these poor sorry lepers walking down to the Syrian Camp you know there had been a couple doubts and fears in it they're humans just like us if they decide to kill us will it hurt well those hunger pains I had last night hurt yeah maybe it won't matter but it ain't what oh come on Saints that's it it ain't what oh wait I had a teacher used to beat me with a ruler ain't ain't a word Paul I think it is now though right it's accepted now go ahead okay back then they had the privileged to beat you with a ruler and I loved it because she struggled ain't ain't a word yes it is I just used it and you did too but they're coming down there what's going to happen what's G to happen and it ain't what you think about your walk that's right come on think about it Saints any believers here today anybody God's changed your life Hallelujah and you can look so critically at your own life you can stand in the mirror and say I'm such a failure I'm such a failure but I want you to understand it's not what your want walk is it's what God's doing in your walk and he took the Walk of those lepers and he magnified that walk and all the syrians saw was a mass Army a great host of people a sound of Chariots amen the sound of foot soldiers the sound of a battle coming and oh Hallelujah all those syrians could think of there's a greater host that is out there and it's something that God by the word now look we're not manifesting this Physical Realm in that sense but by the word God said greater is he that is in you than he that is in this world and as a son or daughter of God from our youth our little children right up to the oldest of us as we are walking our walk as Believers God is magnifying that and shaking their very Foundation of Hell amen hallelujah it's not what you think about your foot steps it's what God did in you is going to shake the very Foundation of Hell Hallelujah that the devil don't know what to do with you amen the prayers of a son or daughter of God on their knees amen has the devil trembling oh Hallelujah excuse me I'm excited this morning amen I have to admit this it was a little bit humorous I was all wound up in the office and brother Jason opened the door and stepped in I was a little embarrassed cuz I was about in the motion of excuse me brother Jason but this just resonates in my soul cuz I could sit here this morning and you could sit here this morning and tell me I failed here and I drugged my feet here and I even fell down here and I went over this way here and I went back over that way here and God says I don't care I'm the one that's magnifying your walk it is not you or otherwise we would find those people that have never had a struggle in their whole life they've never had a problem in their whole life they've never lied they've never stole they've never done on of that I don't know who they are but anyway you know they'd be the ones that go in the Rapture not you I scratched the piano oh my well we'll just call it a battle Mark you see my brother and sister if it was about your walk the devil and the Syrian Army would be sitting on the sidelines right poor miserable leper Bob do we kill him or give them a little food I don't know they look like they need put out of their misery yeah but we got plenty of food yeah but still they're lepers got no reason to preserve their life they're not worthy of the Gospel can I finish Hallelujah you see now I only bring this in my brother and sister I didn't even put it on the screen I am doing the very thing I don't like people to do I'm kind of cherry picking out of a quote the prophet of God said in the greatest battle ever fought go look it up paragraph 194 read before it read after it I'm not trying to change the point of view at anything these words just struck me if these Angel Spirits are anointed to bring you the word right to cause you to believe the word think about this that's exactly right the Holy Ghost God moving in his midst your midst I mean coming down Hallelujah causing you amen cause amen see God doesn't put chains on you and drag you but that anointing that was right there on those lepers they didn't realize it was causing them we can't go there we can't stay here what we need to go go here and what was it it was God himself anointing them the Holy Ghost the spirit influencing them to go down here amen because you know what they could have done they could have said you know what I think I'll do let's just go over there still a couple leaves on that bush over there and let's just eat sticks no no in their mind it was like there's either deliverance from this life or a good meal right down here right did you catch that amen we get both amen we get deliverance from life and a good meal amen but God anointed see to bring that those angels to bring the word the Holy Ghost to bring the word to you to cause you that is exactly to believe thank you Lord amen thank you Lord you believe in causeing effect it's a somewhat scientific idea but causeing effect amen it's very true very true I did that to some young people in in in Chile you know I I I had forgot my wallet or anyway I don't remember all the circumstance right the second but anyway you know I stood in front of these young people in a youth meeting with a handful of cash and I said who wants this and you know all these kids raised their hand see I will never be able to do this with you guys CU you'll Stampede me and and uh do it but but you know I held that cash up who wants this hands went up everywhere yes we want the free cash American dollars worth quite a bit in chil we want it we want it but nobody got got out of their chair and I asked him again does anybody want this hands all go up again there was a young boy would have been to my right about four rows back in the chairs he steps up he starts to go and then he second guesses himself and he gets stopped and he looks at me then he looked over at sister Jerry and sister Jerry's like go go the Lord you can do it brother you could hear him grinding the gears trying to get it in gear in the meantime a young man that was just sitting right he caught the revelation of it this is for real this is for Real boom he's out of that chair bam he's got a holds of it then he stands and looks at me like really yeah yeah yes yes and he goes and he sits down I tell you I don't mean just to keep your time for humor but he sits down and his buddy besides him elbows him how much all that was delivered to the Saints that's how much yeah amen that's right not some little portion here but you know it's humorous in the natural side this young man soon as the service we had a tremendous Revival many young people gave their hearts to the Lord after after even after we come home uh from South America we were getting emails and and uh whatnot a pastor's granddaughter full-blown Rebellion she was telling them I'll just run away another young man that literally living in the family right in the household and and his parents trying to get him steered in the right way and he'd stand right in front of his mother and break the dishes and if you touch me the police will take you away smash smash smash God deliver them these are testimony Saints amen young people and the next time we go to went to Chile young people coming up and saying thank you for preaching the truth I received the Holy Ghost there amen what is it my brother and sister you see it's about the word being loosed and it's there that God will not take you to take it away from you but he took you and just as he took those lepers to the camp of the syrians and they got to feed stop and say well I I don't what are we going to do now no I've got a feast I've got everything I need it's right here in front of me and I even get to put a little of it for the future hallelujah amen if these Angel Spirits are anointed to bring you the word to cause you to believe the word amen I tell you what Lord let that anointing rub off on us amen amen don't let us just say well praise the lord we made it to the word I want to believe the word amen hallelujah oh Hallelujah you know I'll tell you what they went up there and we'll just go real quick here uh what did you believe they were having amen you go forward they get to go up knock on the gates of the city look there ain't nobody out here there's all kinds of food food for an army this world my brother and sister I believe this I it's not Prosperity Gospel so don't get misunderstood but I believe Leo deia was meant to provide for this bride sure amen everything you need I'm talking in the natural is right out here and whole corporations will be blessed because they support you that's exactly right absolutely I can share testimony I I'll just give the brief of it of brother back East amen he he'd been there a long time and and uh the management kind of changed from the the father to the son of this business and uh so then they the son was decidedly not a Christian and this brother would take time off he'd ask for a Friday they'd be driving to special meetings and the son was like you know what I I I'm I'm done with this you need to conform this is in the ages the time you know that that you know kind of unemployment was up and there's more people out there than there is jobs and the sun was like no more of that and he come along and and of course you you know the system well I've got personal leave day I'm taking a personal leave day so we can leave on Friday Drive these meetings comes back from that and the guy says I don't know I've left it up to our attorney to figure out the explanation but you're fired you're done you're out of here I ain't putting up with people like you you religious Freaks and from that day right there it was not three years that business was bankrupt absolutely right did the brother go around and crawl about it no but the man one day runs into the father in a store and he says I want to apologize it was my error also because I let my son do that and it was one of the worst decisions we ever made cuz I didn't recognize till later God was blessing us yeah that's right right that might be a little narrow cross- section to judge that off but I'll tell you my brother and sister God promised he would provide for you amen amen hallelujah let me go back catch a little of this and we'll close sister Emmy why don't you just come to the piano that'll help me amen you see my brother and sister you're little old Christian walk that you sometimes question on you see it's a walk by faith not by sight amen amen don't be trying to look at what you're doing when God anoints you to step and to move and to do that just follow it amen amen just keep doing this but you see what happens is we can't force this to happen amen no more than we can change the course that's right I don't care if this election was stolen that's it I don't care if it was complete corruption that that took this if God allows it to stand then that's what it was meant to be and if it was corrupt that's only because the prophet of God said in Abraham Lincoln and a George Washington on every corner can't change the direction of this country come on let's just take all the quotes amen there's some interesting things just watched a video here the other day somebody mapping it all out about Camala Harris and Biden and where they're at in Scripture it was interesting my brother and sister but that's not what I'm counting on amen I'm counting on the word that wasn't speaking about Camala Harris and Joe Biden I'm counting on the word that was speaking about you and I that's the word that matters amen cuz we've already identified the devil in scripture but we don't go around focusing all our time on the devil amen it's time to focus on the word and the promise of the prophecy amen cuz we're anointed to fulfill the prophecy concerning the bride not the prophecy concerning the the devil out here amen so let's focus on the right thing Hallelujah Romans 8:14 says for as many as are led by the spirit of God come on not the spirit of Le oia not the spirit of some political oriented PR message preacher my brother and sister those that are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God it'll take a son to follow the spirit for you have not received the spirit of bondage again now I I'm moving in a little political vein here and forgive me but my brother and sister there's people around the message that are practically crying in their lunch over the fact that Joe Biden and CA Harris got elected right crying in their lunch what are we going to do I tell you if you're a real bride of Christ you're going to look at Revelations 1967 89 and you're going to say I'm going to be ready I don't care who controls the Senate and the house and how corrupt the courts are and what is happening in this world whether they strike down Obamacare whether they take abortion off the table none of that matters I will be ready for the coming of my Lord that's the Fulfillment of Prophecy for the bride of Christ it is not that we go out and do that we'll have our day my brother and sister I don't want to sound like I'm gloating but there's going to be the day that we walk out on the ashes yes right that's exactly oh Hallelujah not that we're going to be happy H I just stepped on Joe Biden huh that's right no because you were ordained anointed to fulfill this prophecy that's right Hallelujah for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for we have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption amen what do we do we don't look to the old we look to the new for the spirit itself beareth witness within our spirit that we are the children of God [Music] hallelujah you know what happens Saints sometimes God brings things out good things of God and people have been so steeped in Traditions [Music] ideologies under [Music] leaderships they'd reject the good things of God thinking somehow they're being trapped I encourage you if you have even one iota of question about whether you can be deceived or not I encourage you to go dig in the message cuz you will find in the message big bold letters the prophet of God saying you cannot be deceived don't let that Spirit of bondage it might have passed through our church yeah I'm speaking blunt I hope that don't offend anybody I'm going to keep going my brother and sister until that spirit is completely dead and I have a marker Stone on it and I'm not going to write rest in peace either no my brother and sister the prophet of God said in bold letters in the church age book and many other service you cannot be deceived if you come to God and you are ordained to go to God there is nothing will keep you from coming into his presence don't let those question marks that the devil's shelling out sorry Satan you were talking to the guy at the gate you weren't talking to me cuz God didn't need to open Windows in heaven to pour out to fulfill the prophecy because he had already made the way possible before the foundation of the world he don't have to do some Supernatural miraculous thing to catch my attention and keep my attention what he got was that seed now my brother and sister a brother I know preached a lovely service here recently and I listened to a portion of it he said my brother and sister it ain't out here in this world and you might think well okay you know the seed can only do as good as the soil it's in well this is true but this brother made the point he said the potential the scripture does not say the potential is in the world of leoda and it's not the potential of the soil the potential is in the seed that's it cuz it don't matter how good a soil you God if the seed has no potential but the word was planted as a seed oh the soil does matter my brother and sister but it's not whether you were in America in Le oysa people are like oh we've been told this before and I find it humorous a little frustrating at the time but humorous now looking back people are like oh we feel so sorry for you message people in America say what yeah yeah it's a great evil the prophet of God said there was no hope for you you got a quote that he's There's Hope for the people in Uruguay Paraguay here away there way anywhere away no sir the potential is in the seed that's it and the seed according to prophecy amen is in you and me that's it oh can we just stand and praise the Lord today huj Hallelujah didn't even get to my quotes oh my goodness oh Hallelujah can I just read the quote please Hallelujah this is getting terrible i've got such a bad habit you guys got to quit you know what I'm going to I'm going to take another approach if you guys would all just start frowning and sleeping I'd quit please don't please don't let's put that quote up brother Alex and I promise your Saints we'll be done [Music] Abraham saw it see he did not look to any of the misunderstandings of the promise that's right you know the disbelieve the sign website has all kinds of things well this hasn't happened and this hasn't happened and this this wasn't the way he said it would be huh he didn't look at any of the [Music] misunderstandings amen and I've said it before I'll say it again of course right now every one of us knows exactly what the Lord did in the Congo today [Music] every one of us knows what God did in Chile today Russia Today and you know what yeah right here today God intended it to be that way God comes right down my brother and sister look wherever each and every one of you are from whether it's a different country or a different state or whatever a man I want you to just hold this in your heart today God come right down and many times he's bringing the word to pass right in the nucleus of a little group of people because that's what they need to be lifted up out of their circumstance strengthened if we only knew some days I wished I did honestly if we only knew how many healings yeah took place in the body of Christ every single day right we would be astounded now I'm going to give a little dig on you can I dig on you a little bit God doesn't things in our lives does he not and often times we don't even share it somebody say amen I think every one of you'd have to admit God's done something for you and and you knew God did something for you but nobody else knows now now I say that for the point God promised he would move in the midst of his people he's moving he's moving don't let the naysayers don't let the misunderstandings of the promise what if he had looked and said here I'm 75 years old and such and such a voice spoke to me and said I have a baby by my wife and she's 65 years old about 15 20 years past menopause what would he have done huh but I love that word but everything in front of it negated but what did he do he never paid PA any attention to what the Natural Things was oh I'm telling you Saints we can get so caught up in the Natural Things amen he looked at what God said it becom such a reality to him till he didn't see nothing else but what God Said right he left his home he separated himself from all unbelief anything that would try to pull him away he separated himself so he could walk alone now this is interesting cuz as the scripture talks about Abraham walking alone he had a whole group of people with him he had a wife he had servants amen this is even after lot was gone right so when God's talking about walking alone my brother and sister we don't need to move Grace Tabernacle up to to the Wilderness Area amen we got to push out any voices any voices any doubters right separate himself from all unbelief anything that would try to pull him away separate himself so he could walk alone that's what every genuine believer has to do separate yourself from these doubters and unbelievers and walk with Christ it's life to you and Abraham did such a thing and 25 years later we find him still believing the same promise why he had focused his mind to the will of God by the word of God and believed it if we can focus oursel to the plan of God to what God wants for us and what God promised us and let everything else alone no matter how long it is just keep believing right that's it Hallelujah that's right y as we'll close out here I just have to go back as the scripture went back that vocal outer of the word didn't get one drop of that flower that's right didn't drop of that barley in that day they drank wine as we might drink water he didn't get one drop why because he doubted amen but I want you to understand the deeper context of this amen every one of us faces doubts amen come on let's be honest don't let the devil anoint you to speak them he could have sat there right there by the king and thought in his heart Lord how could this and God would have brought it to pass right before his eyes and then he would understand God didn't need to open the windows of Heaven he commission the Syrian Army to bring it to them oh Saints amen don't let the devil anoint you to start speaking the ill my marriage is messed up my children are messed up I don't even know if I have the Holy Ghost I don't know if the message is true I don't know if I like our pastor I don't know this and I don't know that and I wonder about this and I wonder about that why don't we be men and women enough to be like Abraham and just say Lord your word says it my it wasn't the pastor my brother and sister amen as I told you that day I want to drive this home to you I won't keep you from the Rapture and I can't put you in it some people are like oh no no the pastor deceive the people no I'm telling you I believe the prophet of God when he said you cannot be deceived so the Holy Ghost will come down and deal with your heart and say is that on the word or not and I trust my God so much if he says that's not the word then I say okay that's not the word I'm not going to go reason with it and find an explanation for it amen hallelujah oh I got to stop got to stop got to stop did you hear it Paul somebody tell brother Paul you got to stop well I tell you what I close with this this something the Lord laid on my heart right there in the office I just want to say thank you Lord amen thank you Lord amen something Hallelujah has been deposited that's in the bride of Christ amen giving her everything she she needs to fulfill the word of God and I just want to say thank you Lord thank you thank you Lord hallelujah you see we've been called to fulfill all righteousness and we're going to do it that's right Hallelujah abely let go and let God have his wonderful way Hallelujah isn't that beautiful Saints I really thought
