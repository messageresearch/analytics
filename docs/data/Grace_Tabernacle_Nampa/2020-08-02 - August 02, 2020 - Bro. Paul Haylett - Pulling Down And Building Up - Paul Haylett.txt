please come and take control i feel the pull seeing that course again as the ball comes i feel [Music] [Laughter] and i know his fear it's moving me to give my own he speaks to me oh and i agreed [Music] lord please come and take control [Music] we say amen to that this morning hallelujah good to be in the house of the lord today amen you know we just first off i want to just start off with a thank you to our sister sarah she's playing for us in this time of need even though her wrist or hand arm there still bothers her i say thank you sister sarah and god bless you for that amen what a real blessing real warriors my brother and sister always stand up when there's a need right amen we just are thankful to the lord for that now i would just like to start um in this thought today we have an announcement once again for youth service this friday evening at 7 p.m at brother chris and sister kristen's house and uh it's for mature 12 year olds and up and uh any parents that would like to help with a snack that would be appreciated i i would just appreciate as your pastor that um we don't put a limitation to young people right so if you're 25 call yourself young come um and parents please bring your children and if you need to carpool you need to help somebody give them a ride something because we we just i feel like this will be a very important thing our young people are growing up there is influences in this world and you might just brush them off and say this is not really that big of an influence but my brother and sister satan starts now i've often used the analogy of a weed the time that a farmer should kill the weed is not even at the point that he sees it but at the point he knows it exists and so we as christians should not say well when our children are caught up in this spirit of the age then we'll definitely pray through because the lord told us you know through the message to claim them now we claim them when they're right here and then we do everything that we can do amen to bring them up in the fear and ammunition of the lord we don't wait until it's a problem and then say oh church you know pray for my child but we want to and so i just encourage for those who are not here today please encourage them their children qualify that mature 12 year old and up we need to look at this and so they can objectively understand the influence of the day that we're living in in fact i so much so want to do this that i just want to share this quote to you amen can we pop that up brothers amen now this right here my brother and sister is a i think a very powerful quote uh the sermon without money or without christ did you know my brother and sister those parents this is this is the world of psychology and parent training and and these things it's prevalent in the world today they're starting to be a rebound of recognizing that uh whether you believe in a god or not you need to get your children on the right track in the beginning it's interesting to read this because they start citing all of these things that you're like yep that's the bible that's the bible that's the bible but they try to leave the bible out of it amen so they don't want to go there maybe they're leaving it out not to offend but my brother and sister you got two choices in this life you'll either be offending by the gospel or offended by the gospel amen there's no place and you think that's just message no my brother and sister you go back through history and you'll go back in ministers preaching the gospel 100 200 300 years ago said if this gospel is not offensive to the carnal man then you are not preaching the gospel oh boy hallelujah there are enticements for the young people the modern dances and the rock and roll parties and the music that they have that goes with it and it's all enticing for entertainment now my brother and sister we're not here to glorify these things but i'll tell you having been a teenager once i know it's hard for you young people to understand that but brother david and i were youngsters at one time brother tim amen youngsters brother trevor is on the cusp amen but we were youngsters at one time and and the spirit of rock and roll uh i can i personally tell you the spirit of rock and roll it has teeth it's like a bear trap amen because once it's bit you you don't just tell it to go away you have to pry it open and remove it from your life it's got teeth i don't care how good a home a child has been brought up in and how it's been taught to do right if that child hasn't accepted the experience of the new birth rock and roll music catches his attention just as quick as he hears it amen amen because in him is born in him by nature a carnal spirit and the power of the devil is so great today that till it catches that spirit of that little one now saints you know i guess as i've said before and maybe i'll just leave it at this the older i get the bolder i get because i am not really concerned with what people are thinking about me except please don't hurt my feelings amen but you see i'm fighting i'm fighting for you now i don't say that to be glorified but i'm telling you i've come to the place i realized this is who i am and what i was called for amen we're not going to just play patty cakes we're not going to sugarcoat this message we're going to tell the truth we're going to put it out blunt and if that offends you my brother and sister that means i'm doing my job amen praise the lord this friday evening 7 00 pm at brother chris sister kristen's house let's stand as we go into the word of god thank you sister sarah hallelujah nothing like being put on the spot i called her then i text her you need to do this can you do this amen here she is like a champ just coming without any preparation hallelujah i'd like us to go right into ephesians the first chapter verse 13 through 23 amen as we would look just to lay down the basis of our thought today we are going to speak to you on redemptions manifestation once again but the pulling down and the building up amen now you realize my brother and sister everything that is pulled down must be built up satan would break down the word of god in the church in the family so he could build up something of his own god will tear down the spirit of laodicea in the church so he can build the church back up in the word amen you cannot say well i'm going to leave this monument in my life and i'll just add god to the monument it won't work you have to tear down those things to be built up in the word of god amen hallelujah i feel wound up already in whom he also trusted after he heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed you were still that holy spirit of promise amen my brother and sister not a promise of a promise but the promise has been sealed in us which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory wherefore i also i heard of your faith in the lord jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding amen not what the prophet of god saw not what the evangelist saw not what the pastor saw what god revealed to you hallelujah everything they have done was to set the stage for you to see amen that the eyes of your understanding be enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word you know if you take that phrase and you break it down the exceeding greatness of his power to us word you know what that says that means it was focused his great power amen was focused not just broadcast thrown out there but it was sent to us word and in other words god had a destination for the revelation of the word in this day amen he didn't just go scattered anywhere and said somebody will find this but it was a laser that brought the revelation right down to you and i oh hallelujah amen now people take john 3 16 my brother and sister and they say but whoa brother paul you would be wrong because god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son for everybody that's right but god knew not everybody was interested amen there was just an auction the other day amen they sold i forget what the car was old studebaker edsel or something like that a car from way back when but you look at that auction you know and there was only just a few people bidding on it the whole world could have tried to get that edsel or whatever it was i think it was an edsel the whole world could have tried to get it but only a few people wanted it now that might be a poor analogy but i hope you catch it this gospel was given to anyone who would want it but only a few do wow so he said it's available to you if you want it thank you lord hallelujah boy i'll get myself so distracted today this is scary according what is the exceeding greatnesses to us according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly place now we know my brother and sister that this right here is not a seat that is on the right hand of the throne but this is the authority and power of god amen far above oh here's that word i've just been caught on brother sergey you have caused me a lot of study grief i say that in humor unless it would misunderstand because this word is everywhere far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come he hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things oh my goodness amen to the called out that's right brother trevor head over all things to the church which this church which is his body oh hallelujah oh my brother and sister if god put such such a craving in a young boy he'd eat the pedal off a bicycle because he needed sulfur how much more so than the body of christ would be craving christ himself oh hallelujah it's like i don't need church i need god amen i don't need religion i need god amen i don't need some kind of big thing here i need god oh my which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all oh hallelujah thank you lord jesus for your word for father coming the word and by your grace and mercy the word is becoming us lord we can see the evidence of it lord to those who don't understand it that don't have a revelation of it lord they might say well what what are you doing what are you claiming what i'm claiming is my promise lord jesus christ lord we ask for you to speak today lord whatever the needs are of every one of these believers father may you come and satisfy it today in the name of jesus christ amen may be seated now to those of you that will catch this i will just state it up front so it will be obvious as i was trying to close out last sunday's service i originally started the service with uh i thought a very small plate but i stacked it kind of high and i i rushed my way through this thought that i want to touch on here for a moment today and i just felt like the lord wanted me to come back and kind of fill that out not just leave that hanging move on uh you know natural typing the spiritual and we'll get into that in a little bit i have a confession you know that is pretty obvious to those of you who know me and um i'm not much on all the birth signs i'm not much on all the books that talk about if you were born in the second cuffs of the third this of the whatever of the moon that was whatever that you'll act like this and this but sometimes it's really scary accurate amen it's sometimes really scary you know and sister jerry i'm not throwing her under the bus nobody misunderstand but you know she'd be kind of like take one of them little books that she'd found somewhere and she's like look look i want you to read this she does she doesn't even lord it over me she says i want you to read it for yourself ah let's see sagittariuses born under the blah blah sign are great at starting projects and very terrible about finishing them what are you trying to say sister jerry oh my brother and sister so here i want to just kind of work towards finishing you know and not not leave things hanging amen hallelujah but you look at this my brother and sister and realize that as we come down into to the position that god has called us to it says in verse 21 just to recount it to you from this scripture uh amen that it was there that far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also not which is to come have put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church amen we don't need a man leadership we need a man in an office of leadership but he is simply as it were to be carrying the banner of the word amen when we start to have to create our own ideas and we have to start as it were splicing ideas my brother and sister we have stepped beyond amen him being the headship over the church so as you look at this today we realize once again just to bring these to your thoughts the definition short online webster definition of all is the whole or entire quantity so he's far above all principalities he's not just a little bit it says he's far above that amen and power and might and dominion now the word dominion has several aspects to it but i believe the proper uh one to uh express to you today uh would be dominion equals control so he's far above all the principality power and might and control amen god's above all control and every name that is named not only in this world but also that which is to come and so we look at this and realize that god has already he has already possessed every bit of authority my brother and sister that is necessary for you and i the prophet of god breaks it down in our terms and says that that very high price that was paid he chose to pay that for you and i and uh you know when you think about it we'll get into some quotes here and you'll see where i'm kind of trying i believe to try this together the price is very high my brother and sister because it doesn't matter whether we are simply an angry person with bitterness uh that and we would call that sin or you are the backbiter we would call that sin or you are the man filled with lust and we call that sin a man that is an adulterer we call that sin the man who is a liar we call that sin you see there is no degree of sin and so the price is a very high price even for as it were the littlest against the most major amen and so often times in our human element we would like to say well you know that brother that got out of prison back there in the carolinas and now serving the lord you know that uh the word says that a murderer can't go to heaven but my brother and sister i'd like you to go this morning and i'd like you to go and ask god yeah you know a freedom of information act and ask god to see the records on that brother and you will not find a single reference to him being a murderer in god's records amen now if it can go to that degree right there my brother and sister we'll come right down and the little things of our life now i know it's not you but it's people like you that have little nagging things that follow you in your life and you struggle with them it's called human nature it's called yourself and you fight with that and sometimes you think that uh these things just kind of overrule you you say well i can't really you know i should have brought this deal i i keep looking at it at home and it says you know you should go to church if and boy does it name a pretty extensive list of things that uh we would all go oh my goodness that's terrible but it's telling you it don't matter what you've done go to church amen because it's the washing of the water of the word it takes this away from you it is not self-loathing it is not self-pity it is nothing else of that degree that will take that from you but it is the washing of the water of the word hallelujah that is what cleanses us amen and so you know sometimes we'll look at ourself and we will feel pretty down on yourself now nobody get offended this morning i'm not preaching to you i'm preaching to them other people hallelujah you sometimes we come to a place that we think well you know i i i just i'm just not good enough i i just i make mistakes or whatever and you know you think that maybe this is possibly your issue alone you'll be sitting in church you'll be sitting in the home in the car whatever it might be and you might think well you know oh my i just don't have very much self-esteem as a christian now this morning my brother and sister except for someone behind you might actually see you and the others might catch a reflection off a window i might ask you to lift a hand if possibly sometimes you have self-esteem issues as a believer sometimes you don't feel worthy amen well i'll tell you what i'm not going to go there because i don't want none of you to be staring in the piano seeing if you can see the reflection but i'll lift my hand right in obviously there's times i have self-esteem issues as a believer there's times i think lord why would it be me why not someone who was a true warrior why me well you think this is your issue alone imagine the other day over in a little place i was having a meeting over there in topeka kansas and there was a boy a young preacher one of my first sponsors brother roy sitting here remembers the place and this and this great place there there was this minister had gone under a rule for a place in the side wall mashed him beneath that the little fellow was going to die his liver was bursted his spleen was knocked out of place tons fell on him and i said at the breakfast talking to the wife and i said wife you know if jesus was here you know what he'd do i said when he sponsored me talking about this little preacher when he sponsored me and now when brother brown says it i'm not trying to speculate or do but i believe this is the little minister's words that the prophet's speaking are you following me continuity when he sponsored me i believe that word he was sponsor christmas now if saying you believe the word would mean in this case he was sponsoring christ what would it mean my brother and sister that you and i people would say well i support or i don't support grace tabernacle well that's good you do whatever you want to do but you're not supporting paul amen when you say amen to the word you're supporting or sponsoring jesus christ amen so it's not so much that you don't like the way i pronounce the word or you think that i see it a little different than you forget about that stuff and sponsor christ say amen to the word and if you disagree with me go ahead and speak the words to yourself or even and say you know what i don't necessarily understand what paul said lord but i believe your word and i'll say amen to your word amen why the prophet told us you can't do anything else say amen to the word remember when people ask well what do we do brother brandon we go back to our churches and go he you know what that must have just baffled people the prophet of god didn't say oh no no don't you dare you got holy ghost now you've heard the word of truth you don't dare go back to your denomination no what did he do he said you go back there and you support that you say amen to the word of god why because he knew they wouldn't be able to stay well brother brandon we don't have a church to go to what do i do you go down to a good full gospel church that preaches that jesus is divine and get what you can get well my brother and sister regardless of all the doctrines and this and that and the other amen if it's the word we can say amen to the word but the prophet of god i believe also here i'm speculating let those that would say that i'm speculating i believe the prophet of god knew that people who didn't have a church would be moved enough by the holy ghost to find a church oh and i have to throw in at least one negative comment or i haven't done my job the prophet of god said will come to a day they won't walk across the street or drive across town to go to church amen well those two weren't said right together so we can't put them together you got no right well i'm sorry there's continuity there and then one will decide i'm going to do whatever i've got to do to be in the house of god with saints of like precious faith the other one's going to say well no that isn't i just can't do that okay no problem no problem i'm not here to judge it it's just pretty obvious you know sister jerry made me these cookies i probably shouldn't admit this but she made me these cookies yesterday that i'm not sure if they were supposed to be healthy or unhealthy but they sure tasted good amen and uh you know i took a bite out of them and the very first cookie i ate and i took a nibble of the chocolate chip and i believe it was a real one it wasn't just looks it tasted good and it melted in my mouth i was hooked but my brother and sister you see the scripture talking about tasting the good things of the gospel you tell me that you ever take a bite out of this that you're gonna go that tastes good no sir this right here melts in your mouth oh does it get bitter in our belly yes it does because the word comes along and says you know what you're not living right you're not doing this right you need to stop and repent over these things but you know what they overcoming i'm justifying eating more than one cookie here in case you don't know this amen the reminder of what is is brought back that you remember how sweet it was in your mouth and the bitterness of the belly fades away you know why that's how a a a sister a mother can have more than one child i've obviously never had a baby thank you lord uh but i've been there through the birth of three of them and uh if it was left as marred into the memory of that moment no woman would ever have more than one child but you see god has a way of bringing the sweetness of the baby that causes the mother to forget what it felt like to birth the child and so the birthing of the word in you and i brings about sometimes bitterness in our belly and it brings about things in our life that we have to struggle with but when we remember how beautiful the word and how it tasted and what effect it actually brought overall in our life you know as a mother would cuddle that baby and that baby turns into a cute little guy and grows up to be a rebellious two three-year-old you go through the cycle again why did i have another baby but then another sweetness comes along that child and it just keeps producing and bringing back until when a mother is old according to the word of god they look back and the blessing of their age is their children oh god we thank you lord oh that the blessing of the age is this worth word being birthed in you and i amen that we can be old we can be aged that we can be living as it were seeing the end of our natural life and we say i'm so thankful that this word was birthed in me hallelujah you see not our issue alone my brother and sister amen the little fella he was under a sidewall mashed him down beneath that the little fella was going to die his liver was bursted his spleen was knocked out of place tons fell on him i sat at the breakfast talking to the wife i said wife you know if jesus was here you know what he'd do i said when he sponsored me i believe that word he was sponsoring christ and i said that's a trick of the devil if jesus was here he'd go lay his holy hands upon him that boy would get well i don't care if his liver is bursted he would get well oh hallelujah amen he would get well because jesus would walk in here knowing exactly who he was oh come on saints i want you to catch this today jesus would walk in knowing exactly who he was he knowed his calling the scriptures was right vindicating in him that he knowed who he was not not no shadow of a doubt oh hallelujah now look my brother and sister the word says that the prophet for this age would be the first fruits of this age and if the prophet of god would know who he was without a doubt and that he had no fear and he had the word amen then the bride that come under that wave she will know who she is and she will not have a doubt she will not have a fear but she'll have a confidence hallelujah so we walk around with i don't know i don't know come on i'm not going to say you don't have it my brother and sister but i'm telling you the devil's trying to steal a portion from you you've got to come to the place where you say well brother paul my life sometimes the ups and downs and the sideways and my failure if i was to stand in front of my wife and children and say i am eva unequivocally a son of god called to fulfill the word they say daddy you you got mad yesterday and daddy you this and daddy you that i tell you my brother and sister there's going to come a day mom dad children that you're going to have to step beyond what you think you are and what the world says you are and what the devil says you are and you're going to haft up and say i know who i am i don't care what my condition is i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i am the word made flesh in this day oh hallelujah anything short of that the devil's pickpocketed you now i'll tell you my brother and sister i know a brother hey man i know a brother is in mexico city many years ago and he's on the subway and some guy is standing beside him and he keeps pushing his knee into the side of his leg until it hurts and he's like why is this guy doing this why is this guy doing this when he got off the subway he put his hand down there realized his wallet was gone it had nothing to do with the knee in the leg causing pain it was all about the distraction of stealing what was important and that's what satan's doing you say oh my brother brother paul you don't understand the pain our family is going through the circumstance i'm going through you don't understand what's going on me my brother and sister stop it's not about that pain that you're going through satan's doing that so he can steal from you but brother paul you don't understand no tell me i'm not without pain i'm not without memories that leave scars but i tell you i also have a revelation that anything that happens on this earth god allowed it to happen i'm not going to look at it i'm going to make sure as it were my hand is in my pocket on my wallet so that the distraction doesn't give opportunity to steal it from me hallelujah yeah see brother branham puts it right here that's a trick of the devil hallelujah he noticed calling the scriptures is right vindicating in him that he know who he was not a shadow of a doubt he'd lay his hands upon him and say son be well and walk out of there and i said there isn't enough devils in hell to kill that boy i said he would well but i said you see honey he was jesus the holy hands of god [Music] now the naysayers that want to say i'm picking on brother branham why don't you just shut off your internet right now because we're not here to be bound by those things amen left alone that would become an excuse for brother branham are you with me left alone he would say well that happened could happen because it was jesus in this ironic that the natural break of this quote fits perfect with our thought because we could stop right there and not go on with the rest of the quote it's broke off hallelujah but let's go on to the next portion of the quote amen said i'm a sinner now he's justifying why he wouldn't be able to go down there and lay hands on him come on i'm a sinner i was born sexual birth my father and mother were both sinners and i'm just a now i know none of you have ever talked like this to yourself hopefully at least not this morning i'm just a no-good nothing and i said but you know what the lord would give me a vision i hope you guys see the progression of what's happening here he's lifted up that if jesus was here he'd walk right in lay hands on him that boy would get right up out of that bed now he's coming in this place but the reason now that it wouldn't be is because i was just born in sin amen my sexual birth i couldn't do but you know what if the lord would give me a vision and send me down there then that would be different i said i'd go down there and lay my hands on him he'd come out of that bed if he gave me a vision oh here it is i got a vision hey man how many times remember those stories one that's stuck in my head brother branham goes to the house to pray for the baby god gives him the vision and in the vision everything had to be in a certain place and so as it comes the baby's there the mother's there brother branham's chomping at the bit to pray and he starts to go and he starts to realize well mother-in-law's got to be here so now he's just kind of visiting socializing as it were no doubt praying is he standing there where's the mother-in-law she's got to be in the picture amen the mother-in-law comes in the house he gets ready to go again remembers now in the vision that the hat had to be in a certain place and it's now sitting on the chair he can't go pick the hat up and put it there and he couldn't call up the mother-in-law and say you got to show up over here god's got to let this work has to come about it has to be brought about and so the prophet of god shows that and then when the mother-in-law talks her daughter in the kitchen and then she's there and everything comes in she comes in the living room amen and then they're going to be seated and she picks up the hat amen not the prophet of god making it happen not you and i making it happen but god promised it god gives it he'll make it happen so the lady picks up the hat steps over a couple steps puts the hat up where it was in the vision and at that moment the supernatural comes right down in that house brother branham prays for that baby and that baby is healed oh hallelujah now look if the lord would give me a vision right if brother branham would see exactly what it would be he would know who was in the room he would know every circumstances he would know the words that would be spoken if he gave me a a vision amen yeah you guys are reading ahead stop it me a vision and send me down there then that would be different i said i'd go down lay my hands on him and he'd come out of that bed if he gave me a vision hmm you know we don't believe this message by intellect we don't believe it by knowledge right i can go here and show you this scripture this scripture this scripture here's the conclusion my brother and sister all that does is give you an intellectual conception of god not one drop of power but we ought to be thinking yes sir brother branham didn't preach the intellectual mind's filter he preached the thinking man's filter amen we don't have to stop thinking when we come into the message then i got to thinking after all if it was the vision what was it it was the same dirty hands on him now tell me how many times that you have come in a circumstance to pray for someone and satan threw a veil of condemnation up in front of you who do you think you are to pray for this person um yeah it was the same dirty hands on him aha same man praying for him same dirty hands oh further thinking and i begin to think i am his representative then god doesn't see me right man someone needs prayer i don't care if you get screamed to the top of your lung and pound it on the hood of your car you'll stop and say it doesn't take away the fact god's word is true i am a son of god lord forgive me for this but lord we need you to come on this scene we need your lord to go right to india touch our sister vivi we need your lord to touch whoever is in the realm of our influence it don't matter how strong or weak you think you are this is the word of god i'm his representative then god doesn't see me now we're not talking about people that are living horrible lives saints i'm talking about the bride of jesus christ that's living their very best day in and day out serving the lord amen i'm not talking about the willful sinner the man who has turned away from the word of god and denied it i'm not talking about them i'm talking about you saints sons and daughters of god has got a hearts cry lord i want to serve you lord i want to be faithful to you lord i want your word to come alive in me amen i'm his representative then god doesn't see me the blood of that righteous one lays up upon the altar it makes intercessions for me oh look amen look my brother and sister look where we're at do you see now what the prophets just do you see what's in front of you amen we started off talking about a man who was crushed and this conversation has now shifted and it's about brother branham amen but it's not about brother branham it's about you amen it that's right are you with me amen this this conversation this is why i wanted you to see this that's why i kind of deviated from the whole thought i wanted to bring this morning because i wanted you to see this that what satan wants you to do is look at that and you him you say well say the devil did this stop me from being able to pray no he didn't you stopped you you stopped you amen because you chose to believe what the devil said about you over what the word of god said about you you made the choice the devil never stopped you amen god doesn't see me that blood of the righteous one lays upon the altar makes intercessions for me he is my sufficiency he is my prayer he is my life i said the only thing that would make me put my hands on him with faith because i had faith in the vision oh look at this now i need a supernatural event to take place so i'd be able to pray for someone oh but look how god breaks that veil he's tearing this idea down oh hallelujah because i had faith in the vision without the vision the same faith would do the same thing oh vision or not i have a promise i've got the word i've got jesus christ himself he's on the scene amen i don't need a supernatural event whether i can pray or ask for or lift a brother or sister up i don't need that i have a promise and his promises are immutable oh hallelujah now without the vision the same faith would do the same thing so i can reckon myself nothing but reckon him my all and all hallelujah he is my life he is my commissioner yes sir no denomination sent me he sent me hallelujah i go in his name i'll lay hands upon him hallelujah you see what happened brother branham preached himself right into walking down the street right walked down there laid hands on that boy and that night he was in the meeting solid well amen my brother and sister you it's not about how you felt about today or yesterday or last week or last month or last year it's about what god said about you just follow the word look i have faith i love the lord he's my all in all i'm able to step beyond my circumstance and lift my hand or lay my hands wives mothers let your hand on your babies you don't have to worry about whether you're worthy or not god said you were righteous god said you were holy god said you were full of the holy spirit you take that word and say you know what i'm not feeling overly spiritual right now amen amen you know i was one time had the privilege of traveling with brother jewell a little bit i think i've shared a little bit we we preached at a church i preached in the morning it actually was supposed to be the opposite brother jewell was supposed to preach the morning i was supposed to preach the evening the church we were preaching at the pastor had never met me but brother jewel told him he says no brother i feel led let brother paul preach in the morning the brother said okay it's on you brother jewel well that got brother jewel nervous my brother and sister that evening i won't go into it you know the problem is is people think when the pastor preacher evangelist talks about these things if people aren't spiritual they don't discern it they think the man's talking about himself but the truth of it is you ought to know this guy i've insulted you i've told you stupid jokes that nobody got i've said your food was okay that offended half the sisters all god needs is someone willing that's if god was looking for the perfect man to carry the word the word would still be on the throne because there's no perfect man that's right but i tell you saints where's there in that service and i got to see in the morning what i preached and i just when we went to lunch i felt so bad i felt like i just butchered it like i wandered over here and wandered over there just like i'm doing right now in the evening service a brother said can i have a moment he stood up in the church and he spoke out some words and he said as they was preaching this morning this and this was said the lord spoke to me he no more than sat down another individual said can i speak and they started speaking and they sat down another individual stood up and said can i have a moment they sat down another individual stood up and said can i have a moment i thought wow lord wow lord something so disjointed that evening brother jewel preaches power of god moved down through the church people started coming up front brother joel said brother paul come we were praying for people saints they weren't just coming up there saying i i have a little sin in my life i need god to take it away let me tell you it singed my eyebrows some of the things they confessed the front of the church graphic we prayed i felt disconnected i felt literally it'd be like i was praying for sister nadia but i'd stand here and be like i'm putting my hand i felt disconnected i made a comment to brother jewel and brother jewell says well paul i felt the same way he said i felt like it was all happening under distance and brother jewel calls me one day and says brother paul you remember this situation yeah it's a complete deliverance brother paul you remember this it was a complete healing brother paul you remember this here with this teenager god delivered that boy amen hallelujah but i felt disconnected so it therefore couldn't have been effective no it's not about how we feel it's not about how we feel it's us saying lord i want to sponsor your holy spirit moving in the church today i'm going to say amen to your word and i'm going to say this is the truth i believe this lord i want to be a sponsor today of you feeling welcome in our midst did you feel did you feel come on saints we can preach the gospel and not feel anything but that doesn't take the power of the gospel away amen fact half the time feel sorry go ahead feel sorry for the preacher half time he goes home and goes honey did i even make sense today you know my wife holds a lot of sway over me saints we'd be driving home and i'd say honey did i make sense if she said no i didn't have a clue what you were talking about i'm just be oh can we tell the truth we tell the truth amen but you know what happens and just an example now okay so don't don't get mother trevor call me up and say brother paul i was reading this i was thinking this i was praying about this and god answered that this morning it has happened before hallelujah oh well no it couldn't have brother trevor because i didn't feel like it did [Laughter] yeah amen what's happening here we just got to see the prophet of god go from this boy needs prayer that if god would do it we know what would happen if god would give me a vision we would know what would happen if god no way i am his representative can somebody lift a hand this morning and say i'm his representative amen hallelujah then god doesn't even see you and your feelings amen all he sees is his word and his promise hallelujah so just be faithful to his word and his promise and step forward claim it hallelujah because you see now i wasn't you know bashing on brother branham right there my brother and sister but i just want you to see that brother brown was a man just like you and i was anointed with almighty god to fulfill an office amen to do the work of the lord but so are you praise the lord hallelujah amen so you ought to walk out today yeah can i be can i act like i'm bossy for a moment amen you need to walk out today and make your claim on the promise of god now i don't care how you feel about it this morning or whether you really totally i don't know brother paul be in the dark a couple times just walk out of here if you get nothing else walk out of here and make your claim on the promise of god lord i believe every word that's in your bible amen make a claim he's the provider of all my needs hallelujah hey could we say that together amen he's a provider of all my needs not some of my needs all of my needs hallelujah hallelujah now i want you to just watch this i hope you catch this the paradox of our position a lot of poor people on earth today right amen be some even in our midst right here might be having financial struggles a lot of poor people on the earth they're so poor that all they have in this life is money [Music] are you with me did you catch it they are so poor all they have is money they have wealth they have the finery but they are poor because they don't have christ amen oh take this whole world and give me jesus amen hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah now in the sermon proving his word brother branham says this here my mail has shown is so much different than just letting them try to test their own faith now as i tell you every time i'm not trying to present an idea you say brother paul why do you keep bringing that up lately because i was accused of it and i'm going to shove this right back down the devil's throat i'm not trying to pull a quote out and make something out of it if you've got time i'll read the whole sermon of every one of these quotes that we're going to do if you've got the time hallelujah but some of us you know would say well brother paul okay so you know what you have the opportunity you have the message if you don't come this church will provide it to you amen you have the opportunity to go back and find the full context of it hallelujah my mail has showed that it's it's so much different than just letting them try test their own faith because jesus said they lay hands upon them they lay hands upon them and they shall recover now get what he said he didn't say they'd jump up and run up and down the floor they could do that but he said they shall recover is that what he said that's what he said that's what i believe he is here now the one who said the word is here to make it soul amen amen that's what he said hallelujah yeah we need to go further i've got more quote than they've got he is here now the one that said the word is here to make it soul amen we're just aligned short there it's all right saints proving his word go home read it amen so the point the reason i even put this in my brother and sister the prophet of god is declaring if dates matter to you it's strange to me that people put such an emphasis on dates amen but if the dates matter to you it's april 26 1965 amen it's right there it's closing down god knew he was taking his prophet home on a certain date he knew as he was filling out amen you might say uh bulking up would be a term that they use they write author writes a book the editor would send it back and say you know books that are only 200 pages don't sell well you need to have 300 plus pages so that people feel like they're really getting something so go bulk your book up well do you know god broke the book up he broke the book up hallelujah come on he could have brought it narrowed down so close to say look i claimed you you believe i will take you home and you'll live with me for eternity the end [Music] he broke the book up stories all kinds of stories of harlots drawn into the lineage of christ he brought stories of lepers who had inspiration and revelation to turn back and say oh i've got to go show myself to the priest but that's not the priest i need to show it to he's back here the book is booked up that you and i could see every single thing we would encounter in this life we would see it right here in the book and we could go and praise the lord i'm not the only one that has this trouble amen now pardon me i don't mean to say the book is just filled no every bit of this is a gold nugget every bit of this is the absolute truth of god amen this is jesus christ revealed on the written page hallelujah i hope you understand what i was saying are we okay okay hallelujah no my brother and sister you look at this now realize what god is doing he's coming here even in the title of the sermon proving his word hallelujah now look we've got to come to a place saints we can move beyond our feeling of i'm just no good imagine if the prophet never moved beyond that point what would we have for a message he'd be like paul i preached something i feel like it's a little hard and scraping a few elbows and knuckles here and then i apologize for it imagine if the prophet come like paul here does preached hard and at the end of his sermon i'm so sorry i said those hard things if you don't like it you don't have to do it i really didn't mean that you have to stick solely to the bible you can have other revelations from other teachings after all gandhi is a good guy no sir did he apologize in a sense yeah he said i i was so harsh but it needed to be said amen praise the lord amen hey he also said this one i love this one if i don't say it correct forgive me he also said some words that were like this the bride cannot be offended by the word that's right amen so what are the people that are all offended amen oh brother brown did you have to put that so hard he didn't say anything first did he he just said the bride can't be offended he never even said anything about the rest of them i didn't hear an apology from him afterwards either and they were offended yeah and it's happening in this day right here hallelujah see we'll go into second corinthians here what time is it oh my i should be able to get the rest of this in two minutes now i paul beseech thee beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ that's it paul was down there down there with the romans ripping their hide off and he's talking to the corinthians and says i beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ yes the same lord jesus that went down through the temple and whipped on your distant distant relative and the family's been offended ever since yes i have to mind my manners this morning praise the lord who in presence and base among you i i can i have a moment of liberty when you look at this my brother and sister he says in your presence and base among you but being absent and bold toward you as i was finishing up my thoughts this morning this struck me i thought you know this is this is the truth you see you can have ministry that come down and controls controls controls you should do this your family should do this is this this this this this right under your presence but look what paul did paul was based among them god bless you brother you bought a house god bless your family you got a car god bless you you got a job over here god bless you man but when he was away from them so it was no longer a personal thing direct right he preached the gospel without measure if it tore your head off i'm sorry if it laid you low i'm sorry but you see he didn't come in and dominate them he let the word come back that's how it's supposed to be my brother and sister the word coming back now look i'm going to be blunt this morning there's things that i see right here in this church i don't like oh is that are we all okay with that but you know what i'm going to do right i'm going to pray for you i'm going to preach what god laid on my heart and if the word won't change you nothing will amen did you know that clay can be molded into anything left into the in the rain will return back to what it was but when clay that has been molded meets fire it can never return back to its original state and the problem is we got so many people then been molded into message believers but they've never met the fire that's right amen oh because if they ever met the fire they couldn't go back out and become a good pentecostal a good baptist a good methodist a good lutheran they couldn't do it but without meeting the fire they can go right back yeah well i don't really like telling these stories but i'll tell you i know of cases of men their testimony used to be you know what yeah when the lord found me i was on a bar spool got where they're at today right back to the bar stool because they never met the fire amen saints i don't want this church to be molding good message believers i want you to be molded by the word of god and i want you to meet the author of that word and be fired that you never change from what god molded you into hallelujah that i may not be bold when i'm present with that confidence wherewith i think to be bold against some which think of us as we walked according to the flesh i'll tell you what i i got no one else i can't drag anyone else here for an example but i've had people say well you know what that was you just picking on people in the church when you said that i had no idea that you had that problem sister amen oh ouch how dare you offend me but honestly i can say from an open heart had no idea look brother david preached closing of a service part of end of a service he preached on dominating female spirits a lot of you went home no problem some blew up spent the next week looking for all the pieces of their brain because they blew up now my brother and sister if you don't have a dominating female spirit because that's not just stuck to our sisters right i don't know where i'm going with this how about we just how about we just keep going down that road did you know it's not just sisters we all saw a sister's suit just it's only here it's only here here here here here no sir it can be a man that's exactly right it can be a church that's exactly right it can be the ministry that's exactly right right amen and you know what if the preacher stands up here and says all you thieves you need to repent i don't have to blow up i'm not a thief you liars are going to hell i don't have to get upset if i ever tell something that would qualify as a lie i'm unaware of it and i'll repent of it but you see i don't have to blow up i just say lord forgive me but when you run into the devil head on that devil says i'm not about to give in i always remember this story as seven sons of siva amen they went in there they're going to fix this problem then demon says jesus i know paul i know but who are you hallelujah amen but look at this we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh why should my flesh war in a spiritual amen something's wrong something's wrong for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but my god to the pulling down of strongholds you know what god help us now i'll probably be tested on this because the devil he doesn't like it but if the devil's got a stronghold he doesn't want the word to come that's it and start tearing it down now who should i use for an example any volunteers use for an example come on come on some of you smile and those of you breathe so everybody who breathes is an example my brother and sister i don't care who you are today including myself we've got a little something in our life we guard that's it we've got a little stronghold that we are guarding you say well brother paul i just it's the little thing that i'm you know taking what the prophet said what the word said and i'm keeping that covered that's good why don't you let the word come and tear it down why don't you just say you know what lord i'm i'm tired i i i know when the devil's here come on saints when the devil's here i need to cover that with the word to protect myself but we're not dealing with the devil this morning it's a holy ghost that's coming and says look i want to come into your stronghold and i want to tear it down and we're still covering it come on open it up my brother and sister let the holy ghost come in and tear down that stronghold the only way you'll find deliverance the only way you can move forward is to let the work of god come and tear that stronghold down oh hallelujah for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal amen and so you know when the preacher he might come and hit something that hit you right between the eyes don't sit there and say he's picking on me stop and say why would he say that does my pastor come and dominate my life is he telling us what to do is he trying to turn us from the word no no no no man now the word says you should say lord tear it down let it be tore out of my life lord and fill it with your grace and your mercy hallelujah because you see if we're fighting a carnal warfare here saints we're going nowhere we just got religion hallelujah because you see how it's going to come i won't name everybody we'll start on the front row this carnal warfare we're going to start fighting with sisters brother trevor and sister kerry and brother mason sister susan brothers david sister diane it's gonna just come down to this fight about you said i like and i don't and this and that and then this will turn into chaos and pretty soon there'll be a real estate sign out here that's right so if we can get any farther than seeing the preacher as some uninspired carnal man i'm not here to defend the preacher i'm telling you about tearing down strongholds if you can't see the preacher any more than a carnal self-centered man who's picking on you your stronghold will now get fortified but if you can look and say i came to church because i wanted god to deal with me i came today because i wanted to hear from the lord i want to be filled with the holy ghost i want to be a liberty then you can come and say okay the word says oh that our warfare is not carnal but it's mighty to god to the pulling of the stronghold in brother tim's life brother william's life my life my life there's nobody else in this building this morning might seem weird but i'm preaching to myself amen there's nobody else in this building can you take that position amen lord if there be a stronghold and casting down imaginations you know imaginations i'm going to speak bold here i hope i don't offend no one but imaginations can come right into this pornographic world we live in a man they can censor this and censor that and they can't get the trash out it it's a stronghold right satan's guarding that but we can come right down my brother sister and the imagination might be i'm offended i s and they must have said this that's it where's your patience according to the word for your brother and sister that sure seemed like they kind of insulted me now if i was brave enough i'd ask you how many of you i've insulted through the years but i'm not that brave but the imaginations can also come right down into the little things that's exactly right well i don't really feel like that word is for me you're imagining that god's not dealing with you god's moving right up the aisles of the church moving right down trying to deal with it he's not dealing with me he's going to be it's got to be for brother william all this is just for brother exactly william not for me it's a vain imagination this word is for everyone amen you see everything that it exalted itself against the knowledge of god hallelujah so why don't we take the other side and let it bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ why because see i want to go in the rapture with you when we get on the other side i know i've said this before saints and pardon me for just going on but you see i believe when we get on the other side god allows those who fellowship together amen to rub shoulders when we get in heaven now i don't have no scriptural basis for that i just kind of my own personal feel warm well hallelujah if not why don't you guys just go find a better pastor a better church a bigger place more talent but you're here because god put you here had nothing to do with men god did not do that we're not out proselyting people except for maybe what sister olga has done [Laughter] i love you sister olga i love you so much okay can i finish should i finish now brother brahm's talking here and speak to the rock he's talking about israel coming out of egypt about moses the sign all of these things there go look it up they didn't go very far until they got into some trouble every time when you start to make a march for god look out you're headed for trouble the devil's going to uh uh stay i think that's just a hair big on the page brother let me uh the devil's going to lay right along the path there to get every foot in he can get in he will trip you upset you do everything mean he's the devil oh i just love to pour the scripture on him don't you yes sir say it is written in the word of the lord that's right god said so oh i like paragraph 29 the devil hates me and i know he hates you too amen he's my friend praise the lord glad you're listening amen and he's my enemy but as long as god's my friend i don't have no fear of him i just drive him right on back take the word of god and move him right on back out of his out of his out of the place that he thinks he's a holding he hasn't got no strongholds hallelujah come on saints did you read that do we believe the word that a prophet said the only stronghold that the devil has in our life today is the one we give him permission otherwise he don't even have a stronghold he's got no position but you know what we do i just ain't no good the devil says thank you that's it my we could go a thousand places from here but we ain't got time oh place he thinks he's he's got no strong holes he's absolutely legally defeated in every place the devil hasn't got one legal right at all nowhere oh hallelujah he's just the devil hallelujah you know we have all these stink bugs coming around our our place i don't ask a single one of them permission to stomp on them well hallelujah is just a devil why don't you take this word sorry i'm going to sound a little crass here why don't you go ahead and take this word and just beat him to death amen amen that's what god's given us the word for right not to come and tell the devil now according to the marker oh here's here's the corner of your property satan and uh oh here's the other pen okay now oh wait you're my neighbor you mean i gotta look at you every day i gotta deal with you every day hmm that's right brother david it's closer to that devil i've got right here in the word of god it says i belong to jesus christ now sorry if he holds the title deed to me you once had the opportunity to claim that title deal as a near kinsman but you knew the resurrection life lived in jesus christ and you once lived in resurrection life but you're not sure where you stand now and he says no deal because it'll probably mar my inheritance because when i'm dead i'll probably just still be dead i have no confidence that i have life so therefore you're on your own praise the lord jesus said no problem i'll take my shoe off i'll take it according to the word and i will cast it at the gate post in front of the foreign twenty elders oh i know that's not scriptural but you take it right back you'll find it fit amen take that shoe and cast it right there to the four and twenty elders and what were they doing they were at the throne hallelujah hallelujah my little daughter amen my son amen they recognized who they were amen amen praise the lord oh sister sarah will you come unless the lord comes and then we certainly don't need more preaching otherwise we just got we got like my goodness and i i'm telling you what's happening saint i say this a little bit in humor but i say it i i just keep shrinking the plate honestly i do but the problem is is i i've now

[Music] hallelujah saints well i tell you what my brother and sister the devil hates you he hates me but we've got the word the prophet says right here take the word and move him right back out of his out of the place that he thinks he's holding amen there's such power the devil hasn't got one regal legal right at all nowhere he's just a devil and a password that's all you know what prophet means by password right there just any other word just any other word devil satan lucifer no more value than any other word nothing to be exalted like the name of jesus nothing to be left up and praised and worshiped like the name of jesus amen it's just another word now i'll tell you we'll we'll pick up the rest of this because it's building to something but saints will go on amen oh let me finish this

shadow oh hallelujah oh hallelujah we never even made it down to the good part oh well lord willing you know if the rapture comes we won't be looking for part praise the lord but i'll tell you my brother and sister just to give you an idea where we want to go this coming sunday what we're seeing taking place right here in this world everybody's like uh antifa and tafa however they pronounce that oh what are they doing what are they doing do you know the prophet of god go look it up he doesn't say it a whole lot of times but he said the natural always he didn't say sometimes the natural always types the spiritual you don't see groups of young men regardless of color in the park trying to build a statue against the law what you see is them trying to tear down [Music] that's natural [Music] hallelujah we're over here in the and god's not antifa he's the holy ghost coming in spirit moving into flesh god in flesh that's what the word says and you know what he's doing he's coming into my life he's coming into your life and everything that hinders you he's tearing it down we'll no longer be able to take those things that were a statue a pillar in our life well when i was this age i did this and it found me ever since crashing down but what about this that i did paul the holy spirit's there as it were with the sledgehammer this will no longer control your life the natural saints and the spiritual on the same track they're getting ready oh i'm gonna give it away but i just have to a little bit next sunday sunday after sunday after that [Music] you see what's happening we'll go into ephesians second chapter talking about the middle wall of partition the scriptures talking about tearing down that wall between you and christ but you understand the spiritual they're tearing down let me just give you a little foretaste to this we're over here seeing these things tore down in our life and christ ring in we don't have a big ugly broken uphole in our life the grace and mercy of god comes in and smooths that right out hallelujah now look what's happening god's working tearing down according to the word the middle wall of partition between him and us someone say amen thank you lord now look what's happening here somebody's over here tearing down the wall that keeps the antichrist at bay they're tearing down the wall that's going to bring hell on earth you see the two types amen oh thank you lord you're breaking down that middle wall of partition the holy ghost is affecting me like it's never affected me before i'm filled with god amen i can't even hardly even think a bad thought but i'm like lord forgive me amen much less live a life that's out there amen and what's happening is this partition's being broken down to pull you and i into the presence of god and this partition we are seeing the physical evidence being broken down to turn hell on earth oh my brother and sister thank you lord that there is a direct and clear delineation between oh hallelujah between them and us amen between the holy ghost the spirit of the antichrist it's obvious oh it might deceive us go study your message the prophet of god said if you were ever in christ you are in him now if you were never in him you will never be in him liberty to worship i have liberty to serve him i've got liberty to trust him like never before hallelujah i don't need to be afraid i need to be convinced and concerned and then act upon it where's the oil where's the oil young people oh people where's the oil it's right here flowing this morning god's right here in our present don't let it pass us by amen that song past me not a gentle savior it ought to be our rally cry whatever every day of our life lord don't pass me by don't let some kind of spirit of laodicea stay on me lord come down and correct me correct me lord let your holy spirit move me out of my place oh hallelujah oh but he's got no legal right to any man that will acc the promise of jesus christ the devil that's bothering you is whipped amen yes sir he's whipped in sickness whipped in disappointments oh come on how many of us face disappointments oh my brother and sister they don't matter what your status is or your age in life we face disappointments and people we've got a society they speak very roughly of this younger generation i understand where they're coming for but i don't think it's a good thing to speak that way but my brother and sister you'd be able to say i want it i want it now natural typing the spiritual right i want that big house i want my beemer i hate beamers give me a chevy anybody that owns you i'm not picking on you [Music] see here it is i'm offending people people want what they want i got to have this got to have this got to have this you see what the answer type of that is prophet of god said he's here i want him right now i don't want him tomorrow i don't want him next year i want him right now amen there's two spirits in the framework of the church and they're both saying i want it right now amen i want the god to move in my life right now hallelujah or we can be under that influence of the antichrist and be so poor that all we have is money um hallelujah [Music] i checked my retirement account a few days ago [Music] i was disappointed it's the same position it was in several years ago it's empty but i have another retirement account it's not online although you can find it online amen i don't pay brokerage fees but i paid a price that's when i died amen and it's all mine and it says in the fine print that it won't corrupt it won't corrode and they can't steal it hallelujah thank you lord hallelujah thank you lord well before i decide to preach the second half of this we'll just go ahead and stop here hallelujah open the eyes of my heart though open the eyes of my heart i want to see you oh i want to see you [Music] open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to see you [Music] i want to see

strength [Music] in christ alone [Music] the power [Music] let it be saved [Applause] my source of strength my source is christ alone the name of the lord is a strong tower hallelujah but my brother and sister we have a promise of the word now i made a comment earlier about you know just your children and those things i believe in that but don't just throw that out there as some kind of catch-all like well we just live any away and god said that he'd just take care of that god wants to see you care amen the prophet god preached right on that subject he cares do you care hallelujah he cares and if you don't care you're not going to see much happen hallelujah let's care okay amen so yeah i'm not even bashful my own son might listen to this sermon man he might hear me say these words might not i don't care i'm dragging my son in hallelujah amen i'm not going to sit back and just say well you know whatever it will be that's a child god give us that's that's the very fruit of my wife's womb amen that was a very promise it was dedicated and given to the lord when he was a baby and i'm going to stand on that i'm not going to say well my circumstance says that our children are not going to serve god well good you just gave in to the devil because the prophet of god said he don't have title nothing nothing did you get that nothing amen he thinks he owns it but he doesn't even have possession of it oh hallelujah so you just keep claiming a husband a wife children parents whatever it might be you just keep claiming and furthermore if you've got a promise of god you've got something that's on your heart hear me now you got something on your heart and you're asking god and your motive is right and your objective is right then you quit saying oh god if you could do this and you start lifting up a voice that says thank you lord thank you lord amen i want to have a baby lord thank you for the baby you're going to give me i've got disease and i need heal from this lord thank you for the deliverance of this healing of this disease lord i need a job thank you lord for that job oh i need some marriage counseling thank you you're the great counselor amen whatever it might be my brother and sister don't sit back and say well what if why don't you have courage enough to believe every single promise and hold on to that promise and say that's my promise satan give it back hallelujah produce the paperwork he can't hallelujah well the name of the lord is [Music] the name of the lord is [Music] [Music] and they all say [Music] oh blessed be the name of the lord

and i am safe the name of my lord is [Music] and i [Applause] oh blessed be the name of my lord o blessed be the name of my lord oh blessed be the name of the lord most high it's our lord jesus christ hallelujah oh blessed be the name of my lord [Music] oh blessed be the name of my tongue blessed be the name of my lord hallelujah can we give the lord a little praise this morning [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah you know i just got to say this you'll never meet a man or a woman that gives god full liberty [Music] that can say god tore me down but he never built me up i tell you what happens when you see people that are saying well the lord you know i've become a christian just messed up my life reminds me of the little guys you know i think it's interesting saints i'm going to use little declan little samuel as an example nobody's going to have to teach them to put their arms around those little building blocks and say they're mine it comes natural you'll see over there now unfortunately for my grandson i want you to have sympathy for my grandson because you look at little samuel brother samuel he's going to grow up to be a bulldozer [Music] he's on the floor there one day little declan there was a little toy there and declan had it first i only threw that in there for humor's sake little samuel come over there and he was looking at declan holding on to this and something said i want that and he just coming saying we looked down and little samuels on top of declan pulling this toy away from him [Music] now you say brother paul why do you bring that out well i thought it was humorous because i love both of them little guys but you see god tears you down and you say mine he can't build you up [Music] you got to say lord you tore me down for a reason it was something not quite lined up maybe in our own eye we can't even see it god said no it's got to go away you got to go back down to the foundation if you hold on to that [Music] now figuratively saints altar right here maybe you might need to not be figurative maybe need to actually literally do it you got something in your life you've been holding on to you won't let go of it you're afraid to let go of it there's nothing wrong with that i'm not i'm not condemning you for that i've been there before afraid to let go [Music] afraid as the song says let go and let god have his wonderful way don't be ashamed that you're afraid of it but i'm telling you the word says you've got to bring that thing to an altar about to let that thing down and then you to stand up and say thank you for setting me free and you watch god start putting your life back together and you will find you have strength where you didn't you'll have peace where you didn't have peace amen you'll be able to praise when you couldn't praise amen revelation of the word where it was closed to you you've got to let go hallelujah i love you saints i love you saints i stand i stand in all of you god bless you today saints amen just pray god just touch your hearts strengthen you lead you and guide you if i spoke out burn in this flesh if i was rude or something forgive me but all i want to do is stir up your pure minds hallelujah that you'll recognize who you are in jesus christ and that that satan's been trying to tell you he's just a liar that's it he's just a liar hallelujah it's just that password he's just said we give way too much reverence to the devil we give way way too much reverence to the devil god help us to recognize that he's just a password amen hallelujah i stand i stand in all of you just worship the lord i stand i stand and [Music] all praise is to i stand in all of you [Music] i stand and i stand in all of you i stand i stand in all of [Music] your [Music] all praises do i stand in all of you god bless you saints now don't forget if you got something you need to be rid of lay it on the altar don't take it home with you today lay it on the altar be done with it hallelujah there's deliverance you know i'd go as far as to say because i know a church where the visiting minister spoke very strongly to him commanded him you might think this is weird there's nothing weird about the gospel you might think this is different visiting minister commanded them to walk out of their pew and walk around the front and whatever was on their heart a burden the last 30 days he said i want you to lay it on the altar and i want you to walk right out as you leave the church now i seem different my brother and sister but you know what happened going on the next week or two or three there was all kinds of miracles and deliverances happened in their church now i'm not going to tell you to do that but you certainly have the option take whatever it is it's when holding you back put it on the altar leave it behind hallelujah oh can we give the lord a handclap of praise thank you lord thank you lord hallelujah as you're dismissed listening that song i stand i stand [Music] holy god to whom all praise it is too i stand in one [Music] i stand i stand [Music] i said [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you
