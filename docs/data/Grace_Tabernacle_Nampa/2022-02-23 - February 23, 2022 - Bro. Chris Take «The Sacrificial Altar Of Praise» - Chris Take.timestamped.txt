[30:51] we read this last time and tonight we're

[30:55] altars
[30:57] we felt led to read the scripture again
[30:59] because we again bring our text from
[31:00] here so uh chapter two verse one first
[31:03] peter wherefore laying aside all malice
[31:05] and all guile and hypocrisies and envies
[31:07] and all evil speakings as newborn babes
[31:09] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[31:12] ye may grow thereby if so be ye have
[31:15] tasted that the lord is gracious to whom
[31:18] coming is unto a living stone
[31:21] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[31:23] god and precious
[31:25] he also as lively stones
[31:28] are built up a spiritual house
[31:30] and holy priesthood
[31:32] to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[31:35] acceptable to god by jesus christ
[31:38] wherefore also i it is contained in the
[31:41] scripture behold i lay in zion a chief
[31:43] cornerstone effect precious and he that
[31:46] believeth on him shall not be confounded
[31:48] unto you therefore which believe he is
[31:50] precious but unto them which be
[31:51] disobedient the stone which the builders
[31:53] disallowed the same is made the head of
[31:56] the corner and the stone of stumbling
[31:58] and the rock of offense
[32:01] even to them which be which stumble at
[32:03] the word being disobedient or until also
[32:05] they were appointed but you are a chosen
[32:08] generation
[32:09] a royal priesthood
[32:11] and holy nation a peculiar people that
[32:12] ye should show forth the praises of him
[32:14] who had called you out of darkness into
[32:17] his marvelous light may the lord add
[32:19] that blessing to the reading of his word
[32:21] may be seated tonight
[32:22] so our title uh this is the two altars
[32:26] part two and our title tonight is the
[32:28] sacrificial altar of praise
[32:31] now
[32:32] we in verse five we read that that uh we
[32:34] are lively stones last time we talked
[32:36] about building the altar of lively
[32:38] stones um and we're in holy priesthood
[32:42] to offer up spiritual sacrifices verse
[32:44] nine we're a chosen generation and a
[32:47] royal priesthood
[32:49] exodus chapter 30 verse 1.
[32:52] i have a few scriptures here to open
[32:54] with i didn't want to keep you standing
[32:57] so
[32:58] we have a few more here to read though
[32:59] exodus chapter 30
[33:05] verse one
[33:13] now
[33:14] god is giving moses instructions on how
[33:17] to build the altar of incense
[33:19] and thou shalt make an altar to burn
[33:20] incense upon of and wood shalt thou
[33:23] make it and cubit shall be the length
[33:25] thereof and a cubit the breath thereof
[33:26] four square shall it be two cubits shall
[33:29] be the height thereof the horns thereof
[33:31] shall be of the same and thou shalt
[33:32] overlay it with pure gold the top
[33:34] thereof and the sides that round about
[33:37] and the horns thereof and thou shalt
[33:38] make unto it a crown of gold round about
[33:41] and two golden rings shalt thou make to
[33:43] it under the crown of it by the two
[33:45] corners thereof upon the two sides of it
[33:47] shalt thou make it and they shall be for
[33:49] places for the staves to bear it with
[33:51] all thou shalt make the staves of
[33:53] shedding wood and overlay them with gold
[33:55] and thou shalt put it before the veil
[33:57] that is by the ark of the testimony
[33:59] before the mercy seat that is over the
[34:01] testimony where i will meet with thee so
[34:03] it was the last altar before crossing
[34:05] into the holiest of holies
[34:07] right in front of that curt the veil and
[34:09] aaron shall burn there on sweet incense
[34:10] every morning when he dressed at the
[34:12] lamps he shall burn incense upon it and
[34:14] when there is light at the lamps at even
[34:16] he shall burn incense upon it so morning
[34:18] and night a perpetual incense before the
[34:21] lord throughout your generations
[34:24] he shall offer no strange incense
[34:26] thereon nor burnt sacrifice nor meat
[34:28] offering neither shall you pour drink
[34:31] offering thereon and aaron shall make an
[34:34] atonement upon the horns of it once in a
[34:36] year with the blood of the sin offering
[34:38] of atonements once in the year shall he
[34:40] make atonement upon it throughout your
[34:42] generations it is most holy unto the
[34:44] lord so once a year when aaron would go
[34:48] to make the um sacrifice as the high
[34:51] priest and bring that blood into the
[34:53] holiest of holies as an atonement for
[34:55] the sins of the people he should was
[34:57] also told to apply that same blood to
[35:00] the altar of incense
[35:03] and that incense was to be kept burning
[35:05] and there's even other scriptures where
[35:07] it says the the people shouldn't mimic
[35:09] this incense because the lord lays it
[35:11] out
[35:13] what ingredients to use for that incense
[35:16] and um he says the people shouldn't take
[35:18] it therefore and make it their own thing
[35:20] to make them smell good because that
[35:22] would be in mockery of what god has said
[35:24] as holy so
[35:26] um this incense was was called to to be
[35:30] burning both day and night
[35:32] psalms
[35:33] 141 verse 2.
[35:46] psalms
[35:47] 14
[35:48] 1 verse 2.
[35:55] let my prayer be set before thee as
[35:57] incense and the lifting up of my hands
[36:00] as the evening sacrifice
[36:02] revelations 5 verse 8 and we'll seal the
[36:05] deal
[36:06] um
[36:07] on the what this incense is spiritually
[36:10] today revelation chapter 5 verse 8.
[36:17] and when he had taken the book the four
[36:19] beasts and four and 20 elders fell down
[36:21] before the lamb having every one of them
[36:22] harps and golden vials full of odors
[36:25] which are the prayers of the saints
[36:28] but the brown says in the fifth seal
[36:29] 1963. now the instance was the odors
[36:32] odorous stuff that they burnt which the
[36:34] bible said was the prayers of the saints
[36:37] if there isn't no sacrifice now watch he
[36:39] said so he says this this incense this
[36:41] burning incidence is the prayers of the
[36:42] saints what does paul say uh
[36:46] pray for be continually in prayer pray
[36:49] and cease not something along those
[36:50] lines basically the summary
[36:52] be in prayer continually
[36:54] so this is the prayer of the saints
[36:56] morning and night and he says now he
[36:58] says if there is isn't no sacrifice on
[37:00] the altar then the prayers cannot be
[37:04] received
[37:05] it's only by the blood on the
[37:07] sacrificial altar that lets the prayers
[37:10] go through to god
[37:12] in the seven church ages 1950 or he's 54
[37:15] he says has made us priests did you ever
[37:17] know what a priest is what his office is
[37:19] a priest is to make sacrifice to make
[37:22] intercession over in hebrews it said
[37:24] that we the church is the royal
[37:26] priesthood he says hebrews he means
[37:28] first peter
[37:30] a royal priesthood a holy nation a
[37:31] peculiar people see a holy nation
[37:33] peculiar people royal priesthood
[37:35] offering here it is now offering
[37:38] spiritual sacrifices every man and woman
[37:41] that comes to to god enters into the
[37:44] veil so now
[37:46] we have we have this position and and i
[37:49] wanted to lay this out and then
[37:51] and then call to remember it's the first
[37:52] song i placed you high above as a high
[37:54] priest
[37:55] then he's saying then jason's saying
[37:57] cast all my cares and he has forgiven me
[38:00] and i thought that was just
[38:02] beautiful
[38:03] um
[38:05] so
[38:06] so god christ is the high priest of our
[38:08] profession and we are a royal
[38:11] priesthood we are called to be kings and
[38:14] priests of the most high god and so now
[38:18] christ is our high priest who's made
[38:20] continual intercessions and but that one
[38:23] sacrifice he made has covered us for
[38:26] good
[38:27] by his blood so his blood is continually
[38:29] upon that but we have a position we have
[38:32] to play so the beautiful tabernacle in
[38:34] the wilderness was set forth you can
[38:36] read it in exodus and and then the um i
[38:39] think exodus covers how it was built and
[38:41] starts to be put into use in numbers and
[38:44] leviticus you start to see this
[38:47] this uh portrayal this type come forth
[38:51] and now that that tabernacle as glorious
[38:54] and beautiful as it was with the gold
[38:56] and and the in the the fine incense and
[38:58] and all this all these things didn't do
[39:01] no good sitting there
[39:04] aaron and the in his sons and the
[39:07] levites had to put it to use
[39:10] there was no saving power
[39:12] in those altars unless
[39:15] aaron took a a bullock or a lamb or
[39:19] whatever the sacrifice was and slayed it
[39:21] upon the altar and burned it with fire
[39:23] and then went on to do the rest of the
[39:25] things it did them no good just sitting
[39:27] there
[39:28] and it takes faith and revelation to do
[39:32] so
[39:34] aaron had you say well it was easy aaron
[39:36] just had to walk up and but it wasn't
[39:38] especially after his two sons got slain
[39:41] right it was a serious deal
[39:43] and so it wasn't just aaron had to have
[39:46] faith
[39:47] that what he was doing
[39:49] was going that god was going to answer
[39:51] to that otherwise he would be like
[39:53] what's the point
[39:55] why do this the levites had to have a
[39:57] revelation so we as
[40:00] priests
[40:01] have to have a revelation that if we go
[40:04] and we sacrifice
[40:06] we offer our spiritual sacrifice that
[40:08] god is going to answer in kaa in turn as
[40:11] our high priest without that revelation
[40:14] without that faith you're never going to
[40:15] take those steps forward
[40:18] to offer a sacrifice and remember a
[40:20] title tonight is the sacrificial altar
[40:23] of praise and so sometimes when we say
[40:25] praise and worship we automatically
[40:27] think of singing and clapping and
[40:28] raising our hands but that's for me
[40:31] that's the just the tip of the iceberg
[40:33] praise and worship comes when we offer
[40:36] our self as a sacrifice
[40:38] isaac was a type of christ abraham and
[40:41] we talked about this last time abraham
[40:43] offered isaac
[40:44] on the altar isaac was the type of
[40:46] christ not and you know he carried the
[40:48] wood jesus carried the cross
[40:50] up to the to the sacrifice and and and
[40:52] god provided the lamb where christ was
[40:55] our provided lamb but in doing so god
[40:58] even in that christ even in that gave us
[41:01] a a a a type or um an example that we
[41:06] ourselves should lay down upon the altar
[41:09] that we have built of lively stones that
[41:12] we have built not by stone tune with
[41:15] tools that would pollute it but built of
[41:17] natural live stones on revelation see
[41:21] revelation gives you the faith to build
[41:23] this altar
[41:25] or faith gives you the revelation right
[41:27] they go hand in hand
[41:29] give do you have this altar but now
[41:31] unless you put that altar to use
[41:35] it does you no good
[41:37] but it takes faith abraham had to have
[41:40] faith when he built that altar that god
[41:42] was going to provide a lamb in order for
[41:45] him to surrender isaac upon it you say
[41:48] well he didn't kill isaac
[41:50] he didn't kill him
[41:52] in the in a physical act but in his mind
[41:55] he was doing it in his heart he was
[41:57] doing it
[41:59] and so we have to lay ourselves down as
[42:01] a sacrifice and in in so doing we bring
[42:05] our lord praise and worship
[42:08] praise and worship so remember that the
[42:11] altar does no good unless you put it to
[42:14] use elijah built that altar uh you know
[42:18] he took the 12 stones and we repaired
[42:21] the altar of the lord justification then
[42:23] he bathed it in water three times
[42:25] sanctification but it takes the holy
[42:27] spirit the fire from god upon that altar
[42:31] but first elijah had to ask for it
[42:33] elijah had to do something to put that
[42:36] altar to use if he would have turned and
[42:38] walked away nothing would have happened
[42:40] so we read here in exodus about the
[42:43] altar of incense and instances is uh the
[42:45] prayers of type of the prayers of the
[42:47] saints going up burning every morning
[42:50] and evening and then we should be in
[42:51] prayer continually
[42:53] as as christians as followers of christ
[42:56] and and these these prayers going up
[42:58] mingled with this incense and i don't
[43:00] know if we
[43:01] read that scripture i had so many
[43:03] scriptures not all of them i put in um
[43:06] the sermon but
[43:07] it's
[43:09] it's in revelations
[43:11] um
[43:16] is it chapter eight
[43:19] it is chapter eight
[43:21] i think
[43:23] okay chapter eight verse three thank you
[43:25] brother david and that um and another
[43:27] angel came revelation chapter eight
[43:28] verse three another angel came and stood
[43:30] at the altar having a golden censer and
[43:32] there was given unto him much incense
[43:34] that he should offer it with prayers of
[43:36] all saints upon the golden altar
[43:38] which which was before the throne i
[43:40] can't believe i forgot to put this one
[43:41] in and the smoke of the incense which
[43:44] came with the prayers of the saints
[43:45] ascended up before god out of the angels
[43:48] hands so this this incense mingles with
[43:51] the prayers of the saints and is a sweet
[43:54] odor to
[43:55] in the savior's uh for the savior
[43:58] um so
[44:00] praise the lord
[44:02] my spot back here so this is what this
[44:04] this instance is does not i kind of want
[44:06] to bring a couple of things and then
[44:07] we'll we'll we'll move forward with this
[44:09] numbers chapter 16. we pick up the story
[44:12] of korra and and um
[44:16] well we're a little bit past the story
[44:18] of coracore and and those people that
[44:20] some of those levites that he got
[44:22] together
[44:23] had already been swallowed up and now
[44:27] um numbers chapter 16
[44:30] now the word of the lord comes and and
[44:33] the lord says moses separates yourself
[44:36] i'm going to start over it's just going
[44:38] to be you pretty much 16 verse 44.
[44:44] and the lord's speaking to moses saying
[44:46] get you up from among this congregation
[44:47] then i may consume them as in a moment
[44:50] and they fell upon their faces now i
[44:52] want to i want to show you the grace of
[44:54] god and how much he appreciates that
[44:59] altar of incense and those prayers going
[45:01] up and these we have two examples here
[45:03] first with this one gets you from among
[45:05] the congregation that i may consume them
[45:07] as a in a moment and they fell upon
[45:09] their faces so the people must have
[45:11] heard and moses said unto aaron take a
[45:13] censer so moses is like aaron quick grab
[45:15] a sensor put fire on it from the altar
[45:18] go quickly into the congregation and
[45:20] make an atonement for them
[45:22] for there is a wrath god out from the
[45:23] lord the plague has begun
[45:26] so moses catches what what god's doing
[45:28] and brother bannon preaches about this
[45:30] and standing in the gap
[45:31] and aaron took as moses commanded and
[45:33] ran into the midst of the congregation
[45:35] and behold the plague was begun among
[45:37] the people and he put on incense and
[45:38] made an atonement for the people and he
[45:41] stood between the dead and the living
[45:43] and the plague was stayed now they that
[45:45] died in the plague were 14 700 besides
[45:47] him that died upon the matter of korra
[45:50] so you're looking at upwards of 15 000
[45:54] people
[45:55] in one day and aaron returned to moses
[45:57] under the alt under the door of the
[45:58] tabernacle of the congregation and the
[46:00] plague was stayed so that aaron the
[46:03] moses says the word of the prophet says
[46:05] aaron grab the the coal from the altar
[46:09] this is the altar that they sacrificed
[46:12] for the atonement grab that fire
[46:14] why couldn't have aaron grabbed the
[46:15] closest cook fire
[46:19] because it's not the fire god
[46:20] it's not the sanctified fire see you
[46:22] can't just grab any old fire you want
[46:24] it's got to be the fire off of the altar
[46:26] the altar that is your atonement it's
[46:28] got to be the fire of god
[46:31] so aaron grabs the fire from the altar
[46:34] lights the incense and begins to burn
[46:36] the incidents as an atonement and it
[46:38] goes up as a sweet smelling savor
[46:41] and god stops the plague the the wrath
[46:44] of god of the lord is turned aside
[46:46] it was an atonement um and and it says
[46:49] between stood between the dead and the
[46:51] living can we just testify tonight that
[46:54] our prayers are going up to stand
[46:55] between the dead and the living for our
[46:57] sister laura amen we're believing that
[46:59] god will come and answer the prayer and
[47:01] in any situation that you go through
[47:04] your prayers stand between the dead and
[47:06] the living amen so um praise the lord
[47:09] brother branham says in standing in the
[47:11] gap 1963.
[47:13] i try to condense this quote down just
[47:15] bear with me here of this time we're
[47:17] speaking of or reading of course we all
[47:19] under all understand that it was when
[47:21] dathan and core had decided that they
[47:23] would interfere with the commission that
[47:25] god had given to moses they decided
[47:27] moses's altar was too rough looking and
[47:30] they wanted to hew some stones out
[47:33] saying you ought to let the whole
[47:35] congregation do such and such they're
[47:37] all holy and god had commanded moses see
[47:40] that brother branham had the same issue
[47:42] when he was in south africa and he was
[47:44] trying to say we need to go back to i
[47:46] think it was durbin we need to go back
[47:48] and have meetings there and they stood
[47:49] against him like korra and nathan and
[47:52] and he ended up paying for it so it's
[47:55] the will of god
[47:57] using the man moses and these these
[48:00] brothers here started to talk among
[48:02] themselves about what they disagreed
[48:04] with in the man
[48:06] they started to look upon the man
[48:08] and when they got their eyes off god and
[48:10] on the man they said this guy has this
[48:13] he takes too much upon himself
[48:16] and moses responds in like terms and he
[48:20] says you levites take too much upon
[48:22] yourself
[48:23] and and then god he they get the incense
[48:26] together on the golden spoons and god
[48:28] swallows them up but he said the man
[48:30] goes on to say they're all holy and god
[48:32] had commanded moses to lead the people
[48:34] to the promised land and they said you
[48:36] take it upon yourself to do too much you
[48:38] try to make yourself the only one in the
[48:40] bunch that that's got any say so and
[48:43] this displeased god so much until he
[48:45] told moses separate yourself from among
[48:47] them i'll just kill the whole bunch and
[48:49] start a new generation with you
[48:52] now this was god's word this was the
[48:55] saith the lord
[48:57] kill the whole bunch and start a new
[48:58] generation with you and moses fell in
[49:00] the presence of god and said he'd have
[49:02] to come over him
[49:04] now today if god was going to
[49:06] i thought this was funny liquidate the
[49:08] people there was a time that when god
[49:10] had gotten tired of fooling with our sin
[49:12] we constantly going wrong who would
[49:14] stand like moses today for the people
[49:17] where would we find a person that would
[49:18] stand or could stand that god would
[49:20] accept like he did moses and moses's own
[49:23] life on
[49:24] earth meant so much to god
[49:26] till he stayed the wrath of god and god
[49:28] would not cross over moses that always
[49:31] was a puzzle to me till one day in
[49:33] revelation of the scripture there came
[49:35] this thought to me that you see moses in
[49:37] that act was every way substituting he
[49:40] was a type of jesus christ
[49:43] so now you have you have jesus christ
[49:46] standing in the gap
[49:47] and the incense upon the altar
[49:50] and it is with this
[49:52] it was it was it was with this prayer
[49:54] with this incense moses standing in the
[49:56] gap
[49:57] that the wrath of god was stayed that
[49:59] was does say the lord i'm going to kill
[50:00] the people moses separate yourself but
[50:02] that word was turned when moses stood in
[50:05] the gap and aaron took the incense into
[50:07] the tabernacle
[50:10] and as with all things in this
[50:12] tabernacle both under the law under the
[50:15] law and spiritually
[50:17] fire is needed for everything
[50:20] you cannot sacrifice without fire you
[50:22] can't light the candlestick without fire
[50:25] you can't bake the show bread without
[50:27] fire you can't burn the incense without
[50:29] fire you can't go into the holiest of
[50:31] holies without the blood from the
[50:33] sacrifice you used with fire so it's all
[50:36] based upon fire to burn sacrifice fire
[50:38] to burn incense it's all the fire of god
[50:41] a type of the holy spirit you have to
[50:44] have the holy spirit to access any of
[50:46] this
[50:47] brother brown says in the prayer line he
[50:48] says god will you accept christ as
[50:50] you're saving right now god will heal
[50:51] you
[50:53] right you have to accept christ you have
[50:55] to have get the holy spirit
[50:57] so another example here in in and uh
[51:01] did i put the scripture in
[51:04] okay i'll skip i'll go forward then
[51:06] we're going to jump back second kings
[51:07] chapter 20
[51:09] i wasn't entirely sure how to put
[51:11] this these notes in order
[51:15] but we'll just the lord's gonna order it
[51:17] on the fly
[51:18] second kings chapter 20.
[51:22] remember the sweet odor the incense of
[51:24] prayer
[51:25] the sac the the altar of sacrificial
[51:28] praise
[51:29] ex
[51:30] second kings chapter 20.
[51:36] 1 and in those days was hezekiah sick
[51:38] unto death and the prophet isaiah the
[51:40] son of amos came to him and said unto
[51:42] him thus saith the lord set thine house
[51:44] in order for thou shalt die and not live
[51:46] then he turned his face to the wall and
[51:48] prayed unto the lord saying i beseech
[51:50] thee o lord
[51:53] remember now how i have walked before
[51:55] thee in truth and with a perfect heart
[51:57] and have done that which is good in thy
[51:59] sight and hezekiah wept sore and it came
[52:01] to pass after isaiah was gone out of the
[52:03] middle court at the word of the lord
[52:06] god out into the middle court the word
[52:08] of the lord came to him saying turn
[52:09] again and tell hezekiah the captain my
[52:11] people thus saith the lord the god of
[52:13] david thy father i have heard thy prayer
[52:15] i have seen thy tears behold i will heal
[52:17] thee on the third day thou shalt go up
[52:19] unto the house of the lord and i will
[52:21] add unto thy days 15 years and i will
[52:23] deliver thee and this city out of the
[52:25] hand of the king of assyria and i will
[52:27] defend this city for mine own sake
[52:29] for my servant david's sig if you go and
[52:31] read the story of hezekiah his his
[52:34] reign was plagued with problems he had
[52:37] to give he was given all the gold off
[52:38] the temple to the kings so he just had
[52:41] trouble after trouble of trouble so god
[52:42] says hey i'm going to defend this city
[52:45] for my own sake for for the king for my
[52:47] servant david's sake and deliver you out
[52:49] of the hand of the king of assyria and
[52:52] isaiah said take a lump of figs
[52:56] and they took it and laid it on the boil
[52:58] and he recovered and hezekiah said unto
[52:59] isaiah what shall be the sign that the
[53:01] lord will heal me and that i shall go up
[53:03] into the house of the lord
[53:06] the third day so then isaiah gives him a
[53:07] sign and moving time back so
[53:10] here we have hezekiah given the word of
[53:13] the lord and israel in the church 1953
[53:15] brother says look at old isaiah it goes
[53:17] up and tells the prophet hezekiah set
[53:19] your house in order you're going to die
[53:21] thus saith the lord what an
[53:23] embarrassment it was in a couple hours
[53:25] to turn back again the holy spirit met
[53:27] him because hezekiah turned his face to
[53:29] the wall and wept bitterly and said lord
[53:32] i beseech you to consider me i've walked
[53:34] before you with a perfect heart and
[53:36] tears run down his cheeks his cheek and
[53:39] god had already sealed his dune but
[53:41] prayer changed things
[53:45] hezekiah ran to the altar of incense
[53:48] and began to offer an atonement
[53:51] for the what the word of the lord given
[53:53] saying lord i have served you i have
[53:56] done walked before you please spare my
[53:59] life and though thus saith the lord the
[54:01] word was changed because of the sweet
[54:04] incense that hezekiah all offered upon
[54:07] the altar
[54:08] in his prayers prayer changes things
[54:11] amen hezekiah's prayer prayers were a
[54:14] sweet incense upon his altar now there's
[54:17] a thing
[54:19] there's the paradox of being a serving
[54:21] god and that is that in our weakness
[54:24] god strength is made known
[54:28] they that wait upon the lord shall renew
[54:30] their strength it's it's it's it's
[54:33] opposite of what the world says
[54:36] the world says be strong be for yourself
[54:38] don't depend on anybody do it yourself
[54:40] but god says fully depend upon me in
[54:43] your weakness
[54:45] i am made strong he calls the weak and
[54:48] the disabled to fulfill his will what
[54:52] happens is when we get to a place where
[54:54] we think we're strong
[54:58] second chronicles 26 16
[55:02] but when he was strong his heart was
[55:04] lifted up to his destruction for he
[55:05] transgressed against the lord his god
[55:07] and went into the temple of the lord to
[55:09] burn incense upon the altar of incense
[55:12] uzziah
[55:14] uzziah became started at 16 years old
[55:16] became a mighty king with great
[55:18] inventions that nobody else had
[55:21] and he got lifted up
[55:23] until he was strong
[55:26] and he said you know what i'm going to
[55:27] go and i'm going to burn incense
[55:30] and azariah the high priest which means
[55:32] jehovah has helped
[55:34] stands in the way with 250 but when it
[55:37] says mighty men levites
[55:40] stands in them and says don't do it
[55:43] jehovah helped right there jehovah
[55:46] stopped him but azerite in his pride see
[55:50] when we get strong we get proud
[55:53] and we get lifted up and then god can't
[55:56] use us
[55:58] and while he's standing there in his
[55:59] rage leprosy eats he gets eaten up with
[56:03] leprosy and he's a leper for the rest of
[56:04] his life but a side note a fascinating
[56:08] and just powerful testimony his son
[56:11] begins to reign at a young age as well
[56:13] uzziah in his leper state in his
[56:16] condition i believe had still had the
[56:19] ability to i'm sure he talked with his
[56:21] son his son grew up to be a mighty man
[56:23] of valor and run his run the kingdom
[56:26] exactly how god would have liked it and
[56:29] his heart was towards the lord so even
[56:30] though his dad was in
[56:33] transgression and all these things
[56:34] happened to him from that came a king
[56:36] whose heart was tied into christ so
[56:39] uzziah's own strength brought his
[56:42] destruction
[56:43] it is in our strength we find defeat
[56:48] but in the power of christ
[56:51] excuse me but the power of christ is
[56:53] made perfect by our weakness
[56:56] so in our own strength we find
[56:57] destruction but in the strength of the
[56:59] lord we find victory
[57:02] amen what is what follows surrender we
[57:04] said last time victory victory always
[57:07] follows surrender in other words get
[57:09] weak
[57:10] get weak lay yourself down he say you
[57:13] say
[57:14] spiritually speaking there's a
[57:16] there's a battle coming there's a battle
[57:18] coming all right let's go
[57:20] that's right
[57:22] that's exactly right that's what you
[57:23] have to do
[57:26] you just got to lay down
[57:28] i preached a message one time
[57:30] giving up the battle
[57:33] he said hold on a second let's back up
[57:35] you see sometimes
[57:36] i mean anyways praise the lord you gotta
[57:38] just be weak so god can use you because
[57:40] then he comes along you're laying there
[57:42] you've laid down to fight the battle
[57:45] you say okay lord then he comes along
[57:46] and he picks you up
[57:48] and he draws your sword
[57:50] and he begins to fight
[57:52] amen fully and totally surrendered to
[57:54] christ is where we find complete victory
[57:58] amen so uzi got caught up in his own
[58:00] strength
[58:02] but if he
[58:03] would have remembered you know um
[58:07] nebuchadnezzar
[58:08] got lifted up in his own strength
[58:10] and god humbled him
[58:13] ii corinthians 12 9 and he said unto me
[58:15] my grace is sufficient for thee for my
[58:18] strength is made perfect in weakness
[58:20] most gladly therefore will i rather
[58:22] glory in my infirmities that the power
[58:24] of christ may rest upon me in other
[58:27] words be excited about your weakness
[58:31] thank the lord for your weakness because
[58:34] that's where the power of christ
[58:36] will find its glory amen to rest upon
[58:40] you our weakness upon the altar we
[58:42] sacrifice the sacrificial altar of
[58:44] praise we lay our weaknesses upon this
[58:47] altar to bring on the strength of the
[58:49] lord you're lacking joy in your life
[58:51] guess what joy is found in the strength
[58:53] of the lord the joy of excuse me the joy
[58:55] of the lord is our strength
[58:57] you don't have joy in your life because
[58:59] you're trying to do it
[59:04] our strength up
[59:06] yes i just i'm just recapping my notes
[59:08] our strength upon the altar brings
[59:09] destruction but his strength amen brings
[59:11] victory
[59:14] now you say
[59:15] uh the two walters that that's that's
[59:17] that's the what we're talking about so
[59:19] we have the we
[59:21] bringing out those prayers of the
[59:22] incense and and uh uh the prayers is the
[59:24] is the incense upon the altar and i was
[59:26] torn between what to title this
[59:28] um
[59:29] but the lord just i just was praying and
[59:31] the lord just brought inspiration and
[59:33] tied this all together as only he can do
[59:35] so if you go in the scripture and you
[59:37] read through hebrews and
[59:39] you read about uh where well in well
[59:42] pretty much the book of hebrews right
[59:44] paul is laying out the the
[59:46] uh the order of the law versus the order
[59:48] of grace
[59:50] um and so we have we have the altars
[59:54] underneath the order of aaron
[59:57] we have the altered sacrificial altar we
[59:59] have the altar of incense and all of
[1:00:01] these things that's
[1:00:03] so the altar of incense is what we're
[1:00:04] going to take that's
[1:00:05] we have the altar underneath the law and
[1:00:07] we have the altar underneath the order
[1:00:09] of melchizedek
[1:00:11] the order alters under the order of the
[1:00:13] law with aaron as high priest and the
[1:00:14] altars under the order of the word of
[1:00:17] the oath or melchizedek with christ as
[1:00:20] the high priest psalms 110 verse 4 the
[1:00:22] lord hath sworn and will not repent thou
[1:00:25] art a priest forever after the order of
[1:00:28] melchizedek hebrews chapter 7
[1:00:36] hebrews chapter 7
[1:00:39] verse 17.
[1:00:47] for he testifieth thou art a priest
[1:00:49] forever after the order of melchizedek
[1:00:52] for there is verily a disannuling of the
[1:00:55] commandment going before
[1:00:59] for the weakness and unprofitableness
[1:01:01] thereof for the law made nothing perfect
[1:01:04] so here's where we're bringing this
[1:01:05] parallels but the bringing in of a
[1:01:07] better hope
[1:01:09] did by the which we draw nigh unto god
[1:01:12] and in as much as not without an oath he
[1:01:15] was made priest
[1:01:16] for those priests were made without an
[1:01:19] oath
[1:01:20] but this with an oath by him that sent
[1:01:22] unto him the lord's swear and will not
[1:01:24] repent thou art a priest forever after
[1:01:27] the order of melchizedek by so much was
[1:01:29] jesus made a surety of a better
[1:01:32] testament
[1:01:37] and they truly were many priests because
[1:01:40] they were not suffered to continue by
[1:01:42] reason of death so there was there was
[1:01:44] high priest after high priest priest
[1:01:46] after priest because of death but this
[1:01:48] man because he continued with ever
[1:01:51] eternally half an unchangeable
[1:01:54] priesthood our god cannot and will not
[1:01:58] change he is jesus christ the same
[1:02:00] yesterday today and forever so there you
[1:02:02] know in in the programming world we have
[1:02:04] something that's called a hook
[1:02:06] if there's a process that happens we can
[1:02:08] hook into that process and trigger other
[1:02:11] things based on what happens there
[1:02:13] it's an anchor
[1:02:15] this this scripture here is is our
[1:02:17] anchor that he is the unchangeable
[1:02:19] priesthood so therefore
[1:02:21] tying that with jesus christ is saying
[1:02:24] yesterday today and forever if he did in
[1:02:26] the tabernacle in the wilderness it's
[1:02:28] gonna happen the same today in your life
[1:02:31] if you alter your prayers upon the altar
[1:02:34] of incense you will get an answer from
[1:02:36] god
[1:02:37] no question to ask because if he did it
[1:02:39] then he has to do it today
[1:02:42] amen praise the lord an unchangeable
[1:02:44] priesthood wherefore he is able also to
[1:02:47] save them to the uttermost that come
[1:02:49] unto god by him
[1:02:51] seeing he ever liveth to make
[1:02:53] intercession for them i mean what
[1:02:56] brother had that vision he steps behind
[1:02:58] the door after seeing the police officer
[1:03:00] and that woman
[1:03:01] and he says why don't you burn them all
[1:03:02] and he and he's he's pushed into a
[1:03:05] vision and he sees the earth covered
[1:03:07] with blood
[1:03:08] and his sins along with everyone else is
[1:03:10] going up and hitting the blood christ
[1:03:13] making intercessions for the saints
[1:03:17] without our high priest we have
[1:03:20] you see we now under the dispensation of
[1:03:23] grace can go into the holiest of holies
[1:03:25] with christ to receive the seed of
[1:03:28] christ
[1:03:29] but without
[1:03:31] without the high priest
[1:03:33] you can't
[1:03:35] you need that blood you need that
[1:03:37] atonement but see he did it one time and
[1:03:39] that covers it for good for such an high
[1:03:42] priest became us who is holy harmless
[1:03:45] undefiled no wonder the high priests
[1:03:48] were so outraged with jesus
[1:03:52] because he became as one of the people
[1:03:56] what what do you what what where is how
[1:03:58] do i say this
[1:04:01] where do you start to see the people
[1:04:02] fail
[1:04:04] when the priests the pastors the
[1:04:06] preachers
[1:04:07] begin to lift themselves up
[1:04:09] into a position they don't belong
[1:04:12] when it should be this then that's
[1:04:14] because the sin the focus goes off of
[1:04:16] christ
[1:04:17] and everybody is still responsible for
[1:04:19] their own souls but that's where people
[1:04:21] get stumbled
[1:04:23] so it's when we we take it and you say
[1:04:25] oh well i'm going to be the high priest
[1:04:29] once again what's going to what's going
[1:04:30] to follow that
[1:04:32] sin
[1:04:33] uzziah did it
[1:04:35] he picked up all the the incense to do
[1:04:38] as the priest the high priest and he was
[1:04:40] covered in leprosy sin what happens when
[1:04:43] people take god's word in their own hand
[1:04:45] to bring their own interpretation sin is
[1:04:47] going to follow that
[1:04:51] for such a high priest become us who was
[1:04:53] holy harmless undefiled separate from
[1:04:56] sinners and made higher than the heavens
[1:04:58] who needeth not daily as those high
[1:05:01] priests to offer of sacrifice
[1:05:03] first for his own sins and then for the
[1:05:05] peoples for this he did once when he
[1:05:07] offered up himself
[1:05:10] for the law maketh men i love the
[1:05:12] scripture for the law maketh men high
[1:05:14] priests which have infirmity
[1:05:20] the law maketh men high priests we're
[1:05:22] not called to be high priests kings and
[1:05:24] priests but not high priest that's
[1:05:27] christ's position
[1:05:29] the law maketh men high priests
[1:05:32] now today
[1:05:34] under under grace
[1:05:36] to to go under law is to go under man
[1:05:41] because what what whenever god steps and
[1:05:44] i'm getting into part three whenever god
[1:05:46] steps out is is forced out what follows
[1:05:50] let's just for example say use a pastor
[1:05:53] what follows control
[1:05:55] law
[1:05:56] can do no good
[1:05:59] what how does paul say with the law
[1:06:00] there is sin
[1:06:02] but with grit you don't understand what
[1:06:03] i'm saying i can't remember the
[1:06:04] scripture so when god when god is pushed
[1:06:07] out but how does god get pushed out when
[1:06:09] there are holy ghost-filled people
[1:06:12] something doesn't line up with the word
[1:06:14] so then god is pushed out and now you
[1:06:16] have control and me and my wife were
[1:06:19] talking about this situation that we
[1:06:21] know of an interesting thing is that a
[1:06:23] lot of the the women in the church have
[1:06:25] a dominating spirit
[1:06:27] and i said what happened the the pastor
[1:06:30] stepped out of the
[1:06:32] word of god into a control
[1:06:35] even though as a man underneath
[1:06:38] the dominating female spirit now that
[1:06:40] control transfers into even though it's
[1:06:42] preached against into the women in the
[1:06:44] church and they begin to have that
[1:06:46] dominating spirit brother barum says
[1:06:48] look at the women in the church
[1:06:51] that's hard and gun barrel straight but
[1:06:54] that's the word of god
[1:06:56] so that's what happens when it's the law
[1:06:58] because these men have infirmity
[1:07:00] remember if we can say look
[1:07:03] you guys know me well enough to know i'm
[1:07:05] a man and i have infirmity but i don't
[1:07:08] try to
[1:07:09] we say we put that in under god's grace
[1:07:12] and we say lord you have control you use
[1:07:14] this man for your your bidding
[1:07:16] um but the word of the oath
[1:07:19] i i like that the word of the oath which
[1:07:22] was that and that what he's saying is
[1:07:24] he's bringing up psalms 110 verse 4 the
[1:07:27] lord hath sworn and will not repent
[1:07:29] that's the word of the oath
[1:07:32] which was since the law maketh the son
[1:07:36] who is consecrated forever more
[1:07:39] which was so in other words
[1:07:41] the word of the oath was already in
[1:07:43] place when they had the law
[1:07:46] underneath david david says in psalms
[1:07:47] 110 verse 4 under inspiration of the
[1:07:50] holy spirit he says the lord hath sworn
[1:07:53] speaking of christ to come
[1:07:55] and will not repent that thou art a
[1:07:57] priest forever after the order of
[1:07:58] melchizedek what is melchizedek no
[1:08:00] father no mother no beginning no ending
[1:08:02] of days amen it's it's that eternal uh
[1:08:06] that eternal lineage from that
[1:08:08] priesthood in other words the priesthood
[1:08:10] of eternal the eternal priesthood where
[1:08:12] we are now a part of that you have
[1:08:15] eternal life as being part of this this
[1:08:17] royal priesthood
[1:08:19] amen
[1:08:23] that promise
[1:08:25] was already in place
[1:08:27] when israel was under the law
[1:08:31] praise the lord but that oath
[1:08:33] maketh the son the capital s
[1:08:36] who is consecrated forevermore amen
[1:08:39] praise the lord perfected perfected
[1:08:42] forevermore and you being part of the
[1:08:44] priesthood in him are now perfected
[1:08:47] forevermore brother branham says you
[1:08:48] have to be perfect
[1:08:50] to enter the kingdom of god
[1:08:52] because your perfection is found in
[1:08:54] christ amen back back to foundation the
[1:08:57] statue of a perfect man
[1:08:59] amen we're building up with lively
[1:09:01] stones into the statue of the perfect
[1:09:04] man the stature of christ so that when
[1:09:05] he comes what is he coming for an
[1:09:08] overcoming bride and the only way you
[1:09:10] can be an overcoming bride is if your
[1:09:13] life is built upon this altar amen
[1:09:16] underneath the order of melchizedek
[1:09:18] praise so this tabernacle and now
[1:09:20] spiritual tabernacle today
[1:09:22] brandon had the vision of the tent and
[1:09:24] i'll meet you in there
[1:09:26] amen you go in there go into there and
[1:09:28] put those altars to use and god will
[1:09:31] give you his seed and make you mrs jesus
[1:09:35] christ
[1:09:36] amen praise the lord
[1:09:38] you see we are the most blessed people
[1:09:42] of the ages because we today have the
[1:09:44] whole thing we have christ as our high
[1:09:47] priest and our husband you got a request
[1:09:50] is it hard
[1:09:52] sisters is it hard to make your request
[1:09:53] of your wife if excuse me your husband
[1:09:56] if he's a good man is it hard to make
[1:09:57] your request of him
[1:09:59] you just give him that little smile and
[1:10:01] you know next thing you know
[1:10:06] we don't have to he's our high priest
[1:10:07] but he's approachable
[1:10:09] as our husband
[1:10:11] he's making intercessions for the saints
[1:10:13] and he is our husband amen
[1:10:16] praise the lord so we have been made
[1:10:18] kings and priests and that's revelations
[1:10:20] you can turn after one turn there if you
[1:10:21] want revelations chapter one verse five
[1:10:24] to six
[1:10:26] oh i i put it in my sermon and from
[1:10:28] jesus christ who is the faithful witness
[1:10:30] and the first begotten of the dead and
[1:10:32] the prince of the kings of the earth
[1:10:34] unto him that loved us and washed us
[1:10:36] from our sins and his own blood and hath
[1:10:39] made us kings and priests unto god and
[1:10:42] his father to him be glory and dominion
[1:10:44] forever and ever
[1:10:47] saints of god that's how john
[1:10:50] christ
[1:10:51] opens the book of revelation
[1:10:54] you are kings and priests
[1:10:56] that is the introduction to the book of
[1:10:58] revelation
[1:10:59] what does the devil hate so much
[1:11:01] revelation how do you how do you become
[1:11:04] a king and a priest by revelation
[1:11:08] how do you become how do you get
[1:11:11] praise the lord
[1:11:12] because as a kingdom priest now you're
[1:11:14] you're you're you're using the
[1:11:15] sacrificial altar of praise
[1:11:18] it takes revelation to worship god amen
[1:11:22] what what you see you go to any
[1:11:24] denominational church you want i mean
[1:11:25] you find the holiest you want they're
[1:11:27] worshiping
[1:11:28] but they're not worshiping god
[1:11:31] there's no revelation
[1:11:33] revelation is what brings true worship
[1:11:37] let the worshipers arise right
[1:11:42] father i see that you were drawing he's
[1:11:45] drawn a light in the sand saints of god
[1:11:48] amen we want to be standing on the right
[1:11:50] side of that faith is the substance 1951
[1:11:52] but the battle says our bodies are
[1:11:54] groaning and you ever find those quotes
[1:11:58] brother or pastor and brother david
[1:12:00] probably can testify where it's just
[1:12:02] brother bottom has stutters and things
[1:12:04] but you find these quotes sometimes that
[1:12:06] are just smooth and just packed
[1:12:11] and this is one of those quotes our
[1:12:13] bodies are groaning and we have an
[1:12:15] inheritance and we're children now heirs
[1:12:17] of the kingdom oh my kings and priests
[1:12:20] unto god offering spiritual sacrifices
[1:12:22] what does a priest do make a sacrifice
[1:12:25] what is a
[1:12:26] spiritual sacrifice that's what these
[1:12:28] sons and daughters do which are kings
[1:12:30] and priests yet not in full possession
[1:12:33] but they're making sacrifices offering
[1:12:36] to god spiritual sacrifices the fruits
[1:12:39] of our lips giving praise to him fruits
[1:12:42] of our lips you say brother branham i
[1:12:43] just don't feel like praising him
[1:12:46] he said you've got to bring every sermon
[1:12:48] down to where the rubber meets the road
[1:12:53] i don't feel like praising him
[1:12:56] that's the time to make the sacrifice
[1:12:58] you see saying to god
[1:13:00] everybody can do it when it's sunshine
[1:13:02] and roses but everybody can do it when
[1:13:04] it's snowfall and ice
[1:13:08] sacrifice he says that's the time to
[1:13:10] make the sacrifice praise him anyhow
[1:13:14] there's that song for the jeremy shriner
[1:13:16] sings it the best i think well i just i
[1:13:19] don't want to disregard anybody who's
[1:13:20] saying that i appreciate hearing him
[1:13:22] sing that song i'll praise you in the
[1:13:24] storm
[1:13:25] i'll praise you in the storm amen that
[1:13:28] is
[1:13:29] oh that saints i'll forget i was
[1:13:31] listening to a tape or talking to
[1:13:32] somebody but that's the crazy thing
[1:13:35] about being a christian
[1:13:37] is when you do stuff like that praise
[1:13:39] him in the storm people look at you like
[1:13:41] you lost your mind
[1:13:43] you say you're right i have
[1:13:46] i gave it up for a higher calling
[1:13:48] the mind of christ
[1:13:50] amen kings and priests sons and
[1:13:52] daughters offering spiritual sacrifice
[1:13:54] you see the priests the
[1:13:57] every day
[1:13:59] morning and night the incense had to be
[1:14:01] burned
[1:14:02] there was no days off
[1:14:05] sense of god we don't get a day off
[1:14:07] we do not get a day off that's why
[1:14:10] that's why when you start doing it by
[1:14:11] your own strength you're going to fall
[1:14:13] on your face because you'll never find
[1:14:16] the strength of the lord when you're
[1:14:17] using your strength to carry on because
[1:14:20] it is a
[1:14:21] battle
[1:14:23] we are in a battle
[1:14:26] and and if you try to do it on your own
[1:14:30] for example skip devotions
[1:14:34] amen you're not going to make it through
[1:14:36] praise him anyhow kings and priests sons
[1:14:39] and daughters offering spiritual
[1:14:40] sacrifice the fruits of our lips giving
[1:14:42] praise unto his name amen
[1:14:46] amen praise the lord
[1:14:49] your kings and priests call to sacrifice
[1:14:53] to give praise and worship
[1:14:56] the the the levites were continually in
[1:14:59] the house of god offering praise and
[1:15:02] worship he said well we only come to
[1:15:04] church twice a week
[1:15:08] can we go back to second peter
[1:15:11] a spiritual house built unto the lord
[1:15:14] you are now the house of god
[1:15:17] and if you're not going every morning
[1:15:19] and every night continually offering
[1:15:22] praise and worship in your tabernacle a
[1:15:25] tabernacle given for what god to dwell
[1:15:28] in
[1:15:30] for god to dwell in in the darkness he
[1:15:33] gives you light by the pillar of fire
[1:15:35] when things are light and going good he
[1:15:37] gives you
[1:15:38] this pillar of smoke to follow god
[1:15:42] leading his church amen the bride coming
[1:15:45] of christ brother branham says
[1:15:48] go look up that quote but when you look
[1:15:49] at the quote listen to brother benjamin
[1:15:51] say because a comment was put in there
[1:15:53] that doesn't belong
[1:15:54] the bride coming of christ that's where
[1:15:56] we are today saints of god how is that
[1:15:59] how is that possible because we are now
[1:16:02] under the order of melchizedek not the
[1:16:04] order of the law there's two altars the
[1:16:06] author of instance under the law the
[1:16:09] altar of instance under grace the order
[1:16:11] of melchizedek what does the what does
[1:16:14] the does the altar of the law
[1:16:16] over here bring you eternal life
[1:16:19] no
[1:16:20] not at all
[1:16:21] it's a shadow you see if you focus on
[1:16:24] the shadow of a chicken you're gonna eat
[1:16:25] anything
[1:16:29] you're gonna get nothing
[1:16:32] you look at the shadow of an eagle
[1:16:33] passing around wow look at that shadow
[1:16:35] now everyone looks up
[1:16:37] to see where it came from the shadow of
[1:16:40] things to come a better testament
[1:16:43] a better testament
[1:16:46] that just ruffled the feathers of the
[1:16:48] priests
[1:16:49] you don't need us anymore
[1:16:52] uh so they were saying when jesus was
[1:16:54] there
[1:16:55] they knew right because they had turned
[1:16:57] into a man-made thing
[1:16:59] but under the order of mckellar the
[1:17:01] order of melchizedek you're called to
[1:17:04] put to use the sacrificial altar of
[1:17:07] praise
[1:17:08] it is your commandment
[1:17:11] it is the saith the lord
[1:17:13] you are
[1:17:14] called to
[1:17:16] continually bring
[1:17:18] to the altar
[1:17:20] a sacrificed life
[1:17:23] because guess what the shadow
[1:17:25] of the things that come christ is our
[1:17:28] atonement and he's the he was the
[1:17:29] eternal sacrifice but you still have to
[1:17:32] continually sacrifice the flesh
[1:17:37] do any of you have the theophany yet
[1:17:40] something you like to think you do the
[1:17:41] way you dress up
[1:17:47] nothing wrong with looking nice
[1:17:52] you don't
[1:17:56] until you do every day you got to take
[1:17:59] this
[1:18:03] lord
[1:18:05] burn it
[1:18:09] but what what what did the priests take
[1:18:10] from the burnt they put that that hook
[1:18:13] in there and they pulled out
[1:18:15] see where where do you get your
[1:18:16] sustenance
[1:18:17] when you lay your flesh
[1:18:20] down on the altar
[1:18:21] then you can get fed
[1:18:23] but while you're keeping that flesh in
[1:18:24] the way you're reading this book like a
[1:18:27] newspaper
[1:18:28] you want this book maybe you haven't
[1:18:30] caught what it is we talk about what it
[1:18:33] is we preach about maybe there's a
[1:18:34] confusion you want this book what does
[1:18:37] what does john say the book of
[1:18:38] revelations the book that opens with you
[1:18:40] are kings and priests he says
[1:18:42] john is told eat the book
[1:18:45] eat the book you have to partake of the
[1:18:47] book of life amen last time we talked
[1:18:50] about how jacob rolled the stone off of
[1:18:53] the well for rachel his future bride and
[1:18:56] then jesus met the woman at the well and
[1:18:58] he spiritually rolled the stone away
[1:19:01] at jacob's well for her to receive the
[1:19:03] living waters and then every day you
[1:19:05] have to say because you're not strong
[1:19:07] enough you don't have the ability to
[1:19:08] move that stone
[1:19:10] sometimes things in life cause that
[1:19:12] stone to move back over the well of
[1:19:15] living water and we have to say lord my
[1:19:17] flesh got in the way and the lid shut
[1:19:20] can you please push it back that stone
[1:19:22] and bring forth amen the living water
[1:19:25] the la the of the ever living
[1:19:28] everlasting water the water of life amen
[1:19:31] which is himself you see he will come in
[1:19:33] your time of need and open himself up to
[1:19:37] you because the living water opens the
[1:19:40] lid to the living water
[1:19:42] because it's all things in christ sense
[1:19:45] of god what god wants us to do is he
[1:19:47] wants us with all his heart to be that
[1:19:50] bride that is overcoming but we cannot
[1:19:53] do it unless we lay ourselves down on
[1:19:56] the sacrificial altar of praise and when
[1:19:59] you do so amen you take that blood
[1:20:02] that blood from that altar and it
[1:20:04] sprinkles upon the altar of incense and
[1:20:06] god takes that those prayers as an
[1:20:08] atonement
[1:20:10] amen for your victory when you fully
[1:20:13] surrender and lay yourself that's when
[1:20:15] you find victory amen you can also go
[1:20:19] and stand in the gap for your loved ones
[1:20:21] with those prayers
[1:20:24] or there's a need our sister laura
[1:20:26] whatever it is
[1:20:27] you stand in the gap with those
[1:20:29] intercept with those prayers that go up
[1:20:30] as a sweet incense
[1:20:33] praise the lord musicians want to come
[1:20:36] we'll close here
[1:20:38] i mean that sweet incense before the
[1:20:41] lord
[1:20:42] in other words
[1:20:43] you put a nice you put a nice
[1:20:45] handle on or something that instance to
[1:20:47] fill the house
[1:20:48] it smells so good
[1:20:51] just brings a nice that's how your
[1:20:53] prayers are to god
[1:20:55] they're that same effect you know maybe
[1:20:57] the wife cooked with garlic and onions
[1:20:59] and the house just stinks
[1:21:01] put on a candle right sometimes our
[1:21:03] house starts to stink
[1:21:05] what what what does brother brandon say
[1:21:07] you could never pray too much
[1:21:10] and that instance was a continual
[1:21:13] burning through generations
[1:21:15] so you could never pray too much in
[1:21:17] other words you can never get yourself
[1:21:19] smelling too good
[1:21:21] in the presence of god
[1:21:23] because he loves to
[1:21:25] in your house that's what i was saying
[1:21:27] your house starts to stink your
[1:21:28] spiritual house starts to stink it's
[1:21:30] time to get down and do some praying to
[1:21:32] burn some incense upon that altar
[1:21:34] amen that god
[1:21:36] can then come
[1:21:38] amen praise the lord's power heads
[1:21:40] heavenly father lord jesus we thank you
[1:21:43] for your word tonight lord

[1:21:51] your word doesn't lie that our prayers
[1:21:52] even now as we're speaking are going up
[1:21:54] as a sweet incense
[1:21:57] mingling with that smoke off the altar
[1:22:01] oh god
[1:22:03] forgive us lord jesus if there's
[1:22:04] anything hindering that lord
[1:22:07] father sometimes our altars get a little
