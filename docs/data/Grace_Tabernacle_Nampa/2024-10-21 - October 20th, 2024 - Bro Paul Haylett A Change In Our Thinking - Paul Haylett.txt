love him amen we have a number of prayer requests this morning I wanted to just share something I read recently with you this morning before we go to prayer it's from um deep call to the Deep 53 1104 says many in here believe in Divine Healing let's see your hand well that's very proof there's a fountain open somewhere the Deep calling to the deep and God tonight I've believed it all my life I believed it All My Life by God's grace he's helped me to confirm it and tonight I'm still searching wires pay attention to what he says here I found two wires that'll bring the visible power of God for Divine Healing into the individual he says that's two things I find one of them is love and the other is Faith and they're sweethearts and when God and when love gets married to Faith love always accompanies faith when you love God enough to know that he can't lie to you and I'm going to add in here he can't fail you when he says you love God enough to know that he can't lie to you it'll create faith in there that'll make you believe his word and every word he has said is positive truth and you accept it with an unadulterated faith and won't say no it'll produce just exactly what he said he would do the Deep calling to the Deep forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities and health all thy disease amen do you love him this morning do you believe him this morning when we quit looking at what we understand and what we see and we put the we put the word of God in front of us and we look through the filter of the word of God we're going to see things I believe it this morning amen I want to remember our sister Sue in prayer this morning she's asking for prayer she's in quite a bit of pray pain and for our brother Dan as well for healing um they're also asking that we pray for a friend of Caitlyn's mother or Caitlyn's friend's mother who has leukemia and is waiting for bone marrow Don owner her name is Tammy Lynn amen always want to throw in

for me let's just stand and sing that little portion of the chorus again let that be our prayer for the service today Lord I want what you want and when you think about that and you would just put together the list of what God wants for you my brother and sister you'll realize he's got every need in your life covered amen there's not one detail that has been forgotten overlooked left out everything is covered amen sickness in health amen richer poor times of stress and Times of ease he has covered it in your darkest hour in your Brightest Day he's there amen oh I want what you want for [Music] me dear Lord whatever wherever it may be cuz I know I have a knowledge amen you know what's best for Lord and I want what you want for me I want what you want for me can we say amen hallelujah hallelujah amen just a couple little things before we go forward our sister Rachel um I find this humorous I know probably warped but she's as made a vow she's as good as God a husband and it's already his fault amen you got to love it anyway brother Alex forgot to post a deal of the invitation of their wedding on the board and sister Rachel has asked that you all would be patient they do have a little website thing but there's I I don't know if I understood correctly a glitch or two so just let y'all know you're invited amen so I I know it's a long ways up there and I know that they as a couple would appreciate each and every one of you that are able to come uh show support uh for their wedding uh and U I I I think it's wonderful I um my I'll get sidetracked here but I've known sister Rachel since when she was a little girl and then a gap of time and she's grown into a wonderful wonderful young lady uh daughter of God and Alex uh since brother Alex since moving out here few years ago uh you know is just uh uh proven over and over again in conversation and word and deed that uh he loves the Lord and uh it's just a beautiful thing to see them coming together and uh so wonderful amen once again you're all invited amen uh I just want you to know that sister Jerry and I will be gone I I put it this way in kind of humor but um I I've owed a couple Brothers uh uh visits to their church for a long time and uh so November 6th sister Jerry and I are are flying into Canada we'll have two different sets of meetings in Saskatoon Saskatchewan in Edmonton Alberta and uh we'll be home about the 19th so uh just trying to pay some debts and these debts come up before me because I tried to get both of these brothers to come and preach for us and they refused and said no you owe us we don't owe you and uh so um I'm trying to pay that debt so that then we can get them to come and Minister for us so in case you wonder what those are those are brother Dwayne fair and um brother Eugene Brawn so uh just really want to pay the debts so we can receive the blessings amen I also want to um I don't know there was a little complic ations about sending some of it but um just want you to know that you as a church have committed $5,000 part of it's already gone so would be already in work and they put some kind of limitation on the sending so uh not all of it I don't know if it is all sent or not so uh to uh Word of Life brother Donnie Reagan's church has become a very focal point uh with many of the churches in that area actually send their contributions to the relief to to brother Donnie there's Brothers there that have just stepped to the Forefront uh and uh putting a a full effort into this work and uh uh brother Dar award being one of the key elements of that just going tirelessly uh to to support the people and uh if you have had the opportunity to see any of the video clip of uh them uh with with families with individuals uh you'll see the the evidence of the appreciation of what they're doing uh grown men you know us men we're Macho we don't cry in public right uh but see grown men break down and cry see families that um literally were to their last bit of food water Etc and many times they've had to Resort uh to uh actually carrying you know waiting through the stream because bridges are gone and doing this and so uh we sent um uh an offering or in the process of $5,000 uh to support that so uh I know that um as it is you're giving to this assembly that God will give blessings back to you for this labors amen uh and then we have on the left hand side of the church let's see one two two three rows up someone that um has been missing from our ranks and we've been missing her let's give a welcome home to Sister Sophie [Applause] amen amen we love you and appreciate you sister Sophie let's turn in our Bibles I want to preach to you this morning and as I told Brother Isaac in the back room thank you musicians appreciate the music uh in the back room I I pray this comes out there was so many ways that seem like the branches to this thought and and uh I've strugg struggled for several days now of what way to go and so in my Meandering please um uh hold on tight so we we don't lose you in our thought 1 Timothy 4 1-7 I want to speak to you on a title of a change in our thinking and uh my brother brother and sister this is not I want to clarify right off the bat this is not a change in the word this is not a change or or a new uh Revelation or a new uh uh uh you know thought it's not about God's thought it's about our thinking and so we we appreciate the fact that God is so patient and so kind uh can you agree with that that God is patient and kind and and when our thinking and our thoughts have moved away from or meandered away from what God is thinking he is so wonderful to come as a guide would and and gather us up and say you know there's a branch in the trail here and it seems as though you were going a certain direction and I would like you to go this direction and and God is faithful I remember many years ago in Chile at a youth uh camp that uh they had a big hike and and uh it it uh is actually got a little humor to Sister Jerry and I because um uh there was many sisters older sisters definitely uh not in good shape to go hiking in the mountains and then all the young people left bag after bag full of water bottles and food and this and that for these sisters to carry and uh so sister Jerry and I was like you know some of these sisters aren't going to make it and we want them to make it and the only way we're going to help them to make it I hope you catch the spiritual context here is to lighten their load now the prophet of God told us that we lighten the load of our brother and sister by lifting them up before the throne and we want you to make it so we don't call it obligation we call it opportunity and so we're there and sister Jerry and I we hung back with these older sisters few older brothers I remember one old sister there and when I say old I'm I'm guessing probably coming close to 70 years old and uh she went on a hike in flipflops now I know some of you teenagers would do that but you shouldn't do that when you're older and uh so as we're going along this one sister would make it about a 100 yards sit down 100 yards sit down and uh finally we just started collecting up their stuff and and took their burden and started carrying it and you know when you've got a whole bunch of bags full of water bottles it actually it becomes a burden but we had this is my humorous moment a brother come back down the trail and he said brother Paul is are you and sister Jerry all right now here are sisters we've now collected up about eight sisters that are are just walking a little ways and resting and and uh the brother comes brother Paul are you and sister Jerry okay and we're like yes we're fine and then one of the brothers had a radio and it crackled it was a pastor you guys get down there now and make sure that brother Paul and sister Jerry are are not overburdened here and not whatever you know about making the TR The Climb it's Steep and we we don't want them to yeah check on brother Paul and sister Jerry here you're a deacon right yes sir take it and and that's you know how we as the body of Believers need to be we need to come and say I care about your burden and I I want you to make it I don't want you to be uh uh worn out and and uh you know not not be able to press to the mark of the High Calling 1 Timothy 41-7 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter time some shall depart from the faith giving heeds to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies and hypocrisy having their conscience Sears with a hot iron forbidding to marry commanding to abstain from Meats which God hath created to be received with Thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth and this scripture right there verse three is why I do not promote being a vegetarian it's right there in the word what can I say for every creature of God is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with Thanksgiving for it is Sanctified by the word of God and prayer if thou put brethren in remembrance of these things Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ nourished up in words of faith and of good Doctrine whereinto thou Hast attained but refuse profane and old wives fables and exercise thyself rather into godliness Heavenly Father we thank you for your word lead us guide us strengthen us today I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated I want to revisit this just a moment just to kind of interject a little bit of thought now I'm not saying that these are absolutes but just thoughts that as we're studying and praying over these things that have come and we see in verse one in the latter time some shall depart from the faith and my brother and sister not every one of these that departs from the faith is someone who goes off into some kind of Doctrine and and says that's false and I won't have anything to do with it sometimes the doctrine of Satan is just simply to bring people to a place you might say of extreme spiritual fatigue they come to a place that they look at that and they start to question does God really care and and their prayers that they pray sometimes seem as though there's no answer and it's in that realm right there that they start to look at that and as Satan is Whispering to them they come to a place that they realize that that they just don't have the faith to take a Holtz of the word like they should and in that it starts to work upon them and they give up but my brother and sister I would say today it takes more faith to believe Satan lies than it does to believe the word of God an entirely different Faith but still it takes more faith to believe that there was a man I I'm sorry I don't remember his name to to give proper credit to his quotation but he said you know it takes more faith to believe in The Big Bang Theory than it takes to believe in God the Creator amen cuz why haven't we had in the pot holes on the Prairies whether it be in the dtas into Canada why have we not had another spark on methane gas of rotting Cales that creates a whole nether creation coming forth my brother and sister it'll never happen they can't make it happen because it never happened in the beginning and so Satan comes and will give even the most ridiculous explanations of how things came to be and there are those that believe it but no son or daughter of God could ever believe that it was that amen we serve a God who said I'm going to make you unique amen I'm going to create you in the very image now my brother and sister sometimes you get a lot of young ladies together I I think as young men we kind of tend uh uh you know to to accept the fact that we just look like we look I mean this is who I am but you get young ladies together and and if they're not car ful they they get into that whole Spirit of comparison and they are saying well you know um she's a little prettier than I am she's this or she's got more beautiful hair or or whatever it is a little more uh fashion sense and dresses so good my brother and sister H that is a lie of the devil because sisters if God wanted you to look like six so and so they would all look the same but God didn't he said I've got a bouquet here and I created you to be you and I've made it for you in your body natural to become who you're supposed to be in your body spiritual amen it's not about the flesh my goodness I hope this don't sound too crass but at the funeral for brother Bob I'm looking at that one picture and and uh Brother David I I hope this doesn't sound weird but I'm looking at that one picture and I thought sister Joanne was absolutely beautiful in the prime of her life she was just a beautiful woman woman a beautiful sister amen I'm looking at that but you know my brother and sister we would hold on to that to the best of our ability When God says I want you to age gracefully in my word amen it's not about trying to stay some young thing and do the Botox and to do the this and dress like a child amen I tell you what now forgive me for saying it this strongly but I'll just get it out there there's nothing more disgusting than a mother trying to look like her daughter that's right amen you know when they start dressing acting walking talking be bopping like them amen there's something wrong amen God created us to age gracefully and the only true way to age gracefully is in the word of God Amen so we'll see this you know see what happens my brother and sisters sometimes the conscience being seared is simply the rejection of the word that they know is there they can't bring themselves to live what they know amen we could also call that iniquity but my brother and sister iniquity has a context that one knows it's right and let me put it my way doesn't have the willpower but when you come to a place that you will not receive the word that's right you end up with a conscience seared let me skip down to the verses that I really wanted to pull out of this context today if thou put the brethren in Remembering these things this is to you preachers here you put them in remembrance of these things Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ you see it's not how we articulate our words or whether we have dark wavy hair uh oh I'm sorry brother Chris I didn't mean that pointed at you uh you know you know brother Brown talks about that they choose the preacher that was just so so refined see none of that my brother and sister is what makes them a good Minister it's getting in the word studying the word eating the book and bringing the book to the people that the people would then have the same opportunity to have the same blessings and same Revelation coming from the word amen so to come and be uh in remembrance make us a good minister of Jesus Christ nourished up in the words of faith and good Doctrine where thou Hast attained but refuse now this scripture I I preached on this I won't name the church I preached on this quite a few years ago and I I I preached a sermon on old wives tales fables and um there was a lot of things going on in the message at that time and next thing I knew there was a rumor that I was quitting because I had called the mess message a fable but they totally missed the point my brother and sister if we're looking back bear with me look at this meeting here people healed people delivered look back at that look back here and no present tense expression of the Holy Spirit moving today you've turned that into a fable it's a story CU talking about that won't bring that to pass but that same God that was in those meetings in those days in us will produce exactly the same word which means you and I would be able to stand according to the word and say I am a son I am a daughter of God I count myself and am counted as a saint amen present tense word alive in the people today now now my brother and sister we all do it we look back on Good Times I just recounted a time on a mountain amen what was the name of that mountain eagle something I believe it was Eagle's View you could stand on the peak of that mountain which isn't really a mountain in our terms but and at that point on clear days you could see the Pacific and you could see the Atlantic so actually it was a pretty big mountain and it was eagles's view I believe is what they called that incredible place I can relive that my brother and sister I can relive of the young people that were in absolute utter rebellion and their parents not knowing what to do and when they go to correct their children their children would wave a finger in their face and say you touch me and I'll turn you into authorities and have parents come as we're going into that camp and say please pray for our son another family please pray for our daughter my brother and sister I tell you what if we are not living in the right place we will have a feeling I cannot do anything about this situation but when we're in the word like we're supposed to be in the word and we're believing and we're confessing the word we can look that brother and sister those families in the face and say God's going to do something God's going to change this situation and to see a Harden young man already bitterness etching him and to see him in an altar breaking down crying out to God to see a pastor's granddaughter who has already come to the place I'll dress like I want I think she was 15 years old I'll dress like I want I'll hang out with who I want to I'll listen to the music I want to and you can't do one thing about it and see that little girl in an altar crying out to God a life completely changed enough that it totally changed her whole friendship structure in school in the neighborhood my that's incredible but you see we won't do that by looking back we'll do that by looking in the word that's opened right here today the word that's alive in our presence today amen that has promised us a future but we can't just look to the Future you see we want to be good Ministers of the Gospel sometimes you have to put yourself on a limb you got to go where you're not comfortable to preach what God calls you to preach yeah I don't imagine that Elijah was so comfortable telling Ahab he had a devil on him but he did it anyhow now exercise thyself ra rather into godliness now my online dictionary doesn't really list the word godliness as a direct or complete word it takes Godly and adds to it and other forms as it says and godliness is a noun now I don't know one way or another about that my brother and sister because that part of English is kind of like saying I need to identify every piece of wood in my house I know them as studs and rafters and floor joist and trusses not whether it's himl white pine yellow pine Tamarac all I care about it's a board and it fits but see we get so caught up and I hope this doesn't offend anyone today we get so caught up in living the message that sometimes knowing this and knowing that do you believe this oh what group do you hang out with where's your pastor what's your affiliation do you believe the seals are open or not we get so caught up in all of this stuff that there's very little emphasis placed on godliness that's right it doesn't say become the consumate message politician to have some kind of social presence to be recognized have authority you have authority when you preach the word of God that's what the scripture says amen so it's there believing in God the importance of having a moral life well that's good I shared with you the other day my farmer friend he believes in God and married to the same woman I think about 40 years I can assure you that but my friend Paul is a moral man does he know Jesus Christ that's what matters now listen to this full definition is divine Pious devout I want to ask you does that really make you Godly you see this was man's understanding that I hope you catch this here this was man's understanding of what being Godly was but I'm here I'm going to get a little ahead of myself sorry but I want to get it in context amen that's their idea of what being Godly is but my brother and sister God came along and changed our thinking changed it from uh just being Pious you know to being faithful in church or being a part of this God said no it's more than that there's something deeper and he changed our thinking and we sit here today and have starting to have let me put it that way we're starting to have an understanding of what godliness is my brother and sister to be like Jesus amen not a song out here what would and whatever they had about be like Jesus my brother and sister the real thing amen the one you don't have to quote in public the one you don't have to tell them you're a Christian that your life speaks so loud that they look at you and know you're a different individual they know you're a different nature and come from a different father doesn't mean they'll like it but they'll recognize it amen hallelujah what we want to do is Christians is focus on the right things amen there'll be no plaques I'm sorry to tell you the grace Tabernacle they'll be no plaques of your years of faithful attendance that has nothing to do with it maybe for work or school or whatever it might be vacation family time whatever it is that you miss church your salvation amen your godliness did not decline it's not so wishy-washy and temporal that it's like a graph of like you don't you guys love it you go out buy something with your credit card and well this is at least the way our credit card company is our credit score goes was up and down so fast can't hardly even keep track of it Capital One send you a deal your your credit score today creditwise today well actually I'm quite upset because sister Jerry has way better credit than I do but she's spending the money that holds my credit down such nonsense there's no such thing for for the Christian went on vacation wasn't at church for 2 weeks with a suggestion on how you can build it back up come on see how the thinking of man has crept into the the the scripture crept into a spiritual life and so it's there my brother and sister let's focus on the right things the focus is not perfect attendance at church the focus is not how many scriptures you can quote the focus is not how many quotes you can quote it's not who you know cuz come on we're all doing pretty good we know brother George has not one thing to do with our Salvation not one thing of overcoming power in our life my brother and sister has nothing to do with that the only thing that matters is do we know Jesus Christ and when we know Jesus Christ he comes along and he will keep us to the place of what I would describe to you earlier as spiritual fatigue that's the place where job got and he didn't know if God really cared God help us cry out for help to the Lord before you let yourself come to a place that you don't know if God cares or not that's nothing but a lie from the devil trying to keep you from coming to Victory amen and victory is not a goal it's a life that's right now it might seem odd to pull this thought from these scriptures but if you'll bear with me I hope it'll make sense to you today in all my Years Around the message from just a child it's really interesting I've heard the same quotes used to defend opposing ideas now those quotes my brother and sister are right for one you might say and wrong for the other maybe it's wrong for both maybe even a remote possibility it's right for both but you see what happens these things that uh the prophet spoke and they're preached and they affect your understanding this is why we're not supposed to deviate from the word of God what's preached and what you hear affects your understanding and when something is preached to an extent that it is ingrained in you right that's what they do they start you off in kindergarten with two little rubber ducks and they're teaching you math and you have one rubber duck plus one little rubber duck and it starts working that way and it builds right up until we get all the stuff that those of you are smart enough to understand it to they I don't know is there something Beyond trigonometry or whatever that stuff is amen you know I I use that stuff every day yeah every day I might not know I'm using it and I know why I'm using it but I am using it you know that's kind of like the word of God in our life there's not every reation of the scripture that you understand there's not everything that's there that you can just say praise God I know what was happening right there but something in you because you are a Christian and the word has come to you you are living it the Devil comes and you don't have to stop and search out a scripture the Devil comes to bother you and you just speak it amen you don't know where the power come from well you do actually but not in the overall context right you in the overall context you know but not in the specific but you know that when you pray in jesus' name things change amen that's trigonometry in the spiritual world you might not explain every one of those little things but you know that when you approach God in the right fashion things change and many times let's face it doesn't matter brother Chris Brother David myself you preach things at the level of your understanding so one brother might preach on faith and literally by God's grace he has Faith lay hands on people and they're healed another brother preaches on faith and don't misunderstand I'm not demeaning this he is preaching in the realm of building to a faith that they're called to come to are you with me do you understand that so there's these levels that are there and that might even Define the very life of the minister that's preaching it I tell you this in humor brother juel if you ever listen to this but there was a a a a sister had come up for prayer now my brothers and sister ISS we need to recognize if people speak things and say it's thus sayith the Lord it better happen this is not a dartboard guessing game it better happen and I'm not touting brother juel I just know for the fact uh of these circumstances this sister coming to prayer line brother juwel was there under the anointing he said the words just burst forth out of him a year from now Sister you will have a baby boy and one year later she has a baby boy and then a little time went and she desired to have another child and could not and she come back for prayer and and brother juel laid hands on her praying in some meetings they specifically come to where he was at he laid hands on it and a year later that sister had another baby was it three children sister Jerry do you remember anyway at one point in time uh the sister comes up and talking to brother juwel and her husband comes and puts himself almost in the way and says don't you talk to my wife my brother sister sometimes God is just placing a man a vessel a tool in the right place let me tell you the rest of this story because it is funny then brother juel says sister Jerry come here let me lay hands on you brother juwel get away from her we are too old to be having children but look at this my brother and sister but there'll be another man that will approach the same situation and say sister we're going to be in prayer for you every single day till God gives you a child whole different approach same God so sometimes you know ministers preach what they understand they preach at the level and you know sometimes things are preached that aren't just really totally lined up you might say with the word and it's not intentional these are not deceivers these are not men who are coming as ravening wolves these are men that are preaching what's been preached to them and when what was preached to them didn't quite line up with the word it doesn't immediately God doesn't come and just let a bolt of lightning and and that's false and do sometimes he allows that to go for a season because he's actually training us and bringing us to a place my brother and sister that we can come and understand that God has more now I just want to ask you a question this morning does God have more for us amen so let's not put limitations out here like we got all the truth right now and and we're just going to do our group and those we associate no my brother and sister every one of us God has more for us and sometimes we don't even recognize what the more might be or how it might be manifested in our life because God is there and he's moving us along because you see if God dumped the fullness of Jesus Christ in us we'd Short Circuit the wires would melt and we would be nothing more have you guys ever seen copper wire explode it's pretty cool science class experiments like that if you have a radical teacher that locks the door you can take copper wire you can put it in the right substance helps create the atmosphere and you can do that literally you can watch copper wire vaporize and not even break the beaker that is containing the gas of the environment pretty incredible you look at these things my brother and sister if the fullness of Christ was dumped in US ah brother Vapor's here with us this morning because we couldn't handle it but you see God is raising us up into Heavenly places and there's Seasons that we just go along at a level and that's because what God has next for us we have to be prepared for my so the teaching places the wrong idea in people's minds and they can go for years with certain ideas in their minds now I'm going to be a little blunt and put this out my brother and sister but um people can have the scripture says Christ in you the hope of glory right is that what the scripture says yes but then you take the words God in you and they can't accept them yeah you see that's because someone has put a teaching in place that separated Christ and God that's right put a barrier in the godhead and they're looking at that saying no no it's Christ in you not God in you now those that have Revelation understanding of the word would look at that and go Wow Come on how'd you miss that but you see teaching has placed a barrier for them to receive that that's real life example that's not theoretical preaching right there so uh things are preached people understand them they hear them and the wrong understanding of the word is placed in people's minds you see we have to be careful my brother and sister we didn't we're not here on the Earth today to look like a Christian that's right we're not here to act like a Christian but we're here to be a Christian we're here to be the word and people will say but how can I be the word feeble ow me full of mistakes I don't know how we can be the word my brother and sister but my God said you are the word and all that was in Christ was poured into the church and we sit here today not with a little portion but actually a giant portion my brother and sister sister but we have to understand that God put a limitation as it were on what we are or what we will be because he knows who we are and so as we look at this we recognize I actually have the authority you know people stumble over this to create a world and go live on it but God knew our humanness so he put a limitation on that he said that you were a supernatural being but my brother and sister most of the time we get up in the morning and we think about yesterday what we said what we did and there's nothing Supernatural feeling about it but what does the word say right the word says we're Supernatural amen but let's understand this all this that we would see the feebleness of humanity and misunderstandings of the word now I'm not doing this for to do but you can just do it in your heart but how many of us have heard the preaching of the word and realized that our thoughts concerning certain subjects of scripture were just way off base so you see the season come that God said I'm going to reveal this to you he didn't say when they reach 40 years of service that's right I shared this with the young adults today for them to be examples to us Elders don't got to be 25 40 50 70 my brother and sister I have seen brothers that were quite aged smash their fingers and curse age is not the solution and I know a brother lives back East he boastfully shares this not boastfully that's not boldly boldly shares this driving down the highway one day and a car something cut him off he's getting a little steamed up said his little little girl said Daddy what sweetie the Holy Ghost doesn't act like that he said I lost all that steam really quick out of the mouth of babes that's right amen see there's got to come A change in our thinking my brother and sister there's no seniority look if it took brother Bob till he was a hundred years old to come to maturity he would live to be a hundred years old amen and if his testimony needed to be here on the earth and a hundred years old he would still be here today but God has a time your work is finished you are mature in Christ you have come to the fullness and just because somebody dies in their 40s doesn't mean that you know uh they had a greater Revelation than someone that takes 100 but understand my brother and sister but look at this John 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come my brother and sister this is the Holy Spirit the spirit of Truth working in you and I coming to a stage that every false Doctrine every false idea everything Satan's trying to plant in your life they'll come a day by the moving of the holy spirit that God will root that out and correct that put it in its correct place and in that will come a change of our thinking God's word didn't change it's a change of our thinking amen so you look at this understand spiritual insight Revelation is a simple word to use spiritual Insight my brother and sister whether you have a partial understanding partial Revelation often times a godhead falls into the realm for people coming to it of partial Revelation they start to understand they stumble a little bit because they were taught from a child Matthew 28:19 is the absolute unreplicated in the word in their context but it's the word acts 238 well just like they thought in that day these modern-day theologians they actually have the same Dee rooted idea that those were a bunch of wild people that were there that that was nonsense that was not the Fulfillment of the word even though God replicated it in scripture again and again and again so partial then we come to full understanding full Revelation my brother and sister here again this might sound a little strange to you I always appreciated how brother Donnie put this forth he said you know if a brother calls up and says you know what I I I want to come talk to you I'm getting married and my my uh fiance and I would like to come talk to you brother Donnie and you know the Man shows up at the office and walks in with a 12-year-old girl brother Donnie says I'm going to send the little girl home to her mama and him and I are going to have a talk you see my brother and sister God's not taking a bride that is immature he's not going to take a bride that don't have an understanding who she is and what she has committed herself to so the word has to come bring a maturity and in that maturity I I bring this point up and and I hope this isn't too much for anybody but I'm telling you the difference of the thinking and emotion of a 12-year-old girl and a 20-year-old girl is so radically it's though they weren't even the same being and you take that same spiritual growth it is so radical it's as though we're not even the same being that's right but whether Revelation is partial or full it has to align with all the word of God we cannot inject even one bit of air or our own thinking that's right I think this the conclusion is very obvious it must be this no it must be the word amen there's no room in there for our speculation there's no room for our assumption there's no room for for our conjecture it must be the word amen that's why I'm not boasting on myself but that's why I do my very best to preach what I term as a defensible message that if someone says but what you said about that that it's right here it's right here it's right here it's right here because otherwise our human thinking can take us down an Avenue that seems so close so appropriate that we're sure it's truth but it's just that one little Iota so spiritual Insight Revelation my brother and sister has to align with the word and one of those things it will do do you know that real true Revel will always bring us to a place of more of him and less of us a real Revelation is not I it's him am now it wasn't so from the beginning we'll put this up there please follow me just church denomination doesn't satisfy me someone say Amen to that if the scripture says one thing and the church teaches another that don't work if Jesus Christ lived in the apostles and done the signs that he was here on Earth it'll do it again if we'll get zeroed in this is not I believe a message this is I know my Creator I know my savior I know who he is not I heard our church had a Revival that's wonderful F did you that's it people go to church for years Revival after Revival never have a Revival themselves then that Revival is null and void the Revival should be there for you and you don't need a billboard collection of people fill the church careful with special speakers to have a Revival in fact most people I tell you most people are actually afraid of revivals because in a Revival you don't dictate what happens a real Revival I'm talking about you and your heart and soul and mind having a Revival you can't dictate that that's God's work and I hope I don't offend anyone but most of us are too held in and God's still prying our old habits thoughts Deeds words complexes out of us oh don't don't be offended I I I heard the same words H what we need is a Revival we got to get zeroed I don't care what the church says uh it'll group this or that oh Father Son Holy Ghost and all the other kinds of stuff and all these Creeds and all these things one way or another it's all right it ain't all right with me if the apostles hit the dot we can hit the dot too Can someone say Amen to that if we'll get zeroed in with God's word let our experience zero with his word let me read that again let our experience zero with his word they did it and if they did it why can't we do it if we'll zero in it'll do the same thing oh my my brother and sister but can you explain this can you explain that have you had this do you dream dreams do you write songs none of that matters my brother and sister if we're not zeroed in we got to get to the point that we become the word and the word becomes us amen cuz you can have all kinds of anointings and gifts and not hit the mark amen amen sister Jerry and I know a lady her husband argue up a storm with me over over the word of God said we are wrong said we're deceived said all these things and I'll say this boastfully I'm just telling you this man had an utter convincing argument and he believed his argument and not long after that occasion he left his wife for another woman now my brother and sister if the word produces that behavior his word produces that behavior I want to have a word that is a sin killing quenching amen cleansing Hallelujah grandma with the Brillo my brother and sister it hurts but you had clean elbows amen I want the word to be such I don't need to have a convincing argument I want God to give me a life that would convince hallelujah amen are we okay amen I don't know what time it is we still got just a minute or two okay this is going to be a little psychological Babel right my name's not Kamala but it might come out like a word salad our response to a statement is often influenced by our experience or lack of experience in the subject related let's just have two men talking about the Holy Ghost one has experience and one doesn't use the exact same words entirely different results can I just put it bluntly you can quote the message all you want we've got to have the goods to back it up but let me quantify that the prophet of God said if you have something that's been in your life and and you're there you want free of that you've went through the prayer line you've been prayed for whether the symptom changes or not you need to walk out and say I've been set free I'm delivered the same thing with healing you can have a disease or a condition and you get prayed for you claim that and let's make it easy to identify you've got a hip problem and so you walk funny and you're there and you're prayed for in the line and they in the name of Jesus Christ you've already healed and they walk out of the line and they still have a problem do we tell them not to worship God and claim their healing it's not what the prophet taught us Prophet said you leave from there I'm healed amen might not be one evidence anywhere around you that you have been healed but there certainly won't be any evidence if you don't claim your healing amen and so you do that Paul Ryan perfect example amen the the barber giving him a shave the barber is mocking him my brother and sister you guys do understand that from the story The Barber is not there going oh praise God the bar oh man you say you have what did he do yep God healed me and his eyes came open no more selling pencils for him amen my brother and sister what it took your confession sometimes it takes our own confession that there'll be something a besetting sin an issue in your life that you're troubling over and you need to stand up and say you know what God's already delivered me from this the symptom every symptom might still be there in your face but you have to step into the promise of God you got to step into your healing you got to step into your deliverance you need to step into Revelation amen amen oh you say step into Revelation yes the prophet of God said pray for Revelation that's stepping into it you're claiming that Revelation there's something there you you got for me Lord and I'm claiming it right now even though I don't even know what it is that's right my help us Lord amen sometimes we don't even know what God's got for us but you ought to be claiming it amen amen a little introspection here to zero in I wonder what does that mean to you prophet of God was talking about zeroing in I'll just be honest with you I hav't 100 years now but I had Old Faithful old cheap rifle and uh 300 Win Mag thing kicked like a mule I'd go shoot the target first shot usually was okay second was a little better after that I would Flinch like you can't believe cuz it was like being hit with a sledgehammer but you know in all the years I hunted with that rifle I only missed a little handful of shots oh you guys want to know this one off I have to share this I was at a place like job where I wondered Lord do you even hear me and went antalope hunting and I ended up seeing this this anvelope one hanging into my garage and realized once I started going up that way that the little Ravine that was there ran out turned into flat ground I got down on my belly I wanted this Antelope so bad I crawled through the little desert cactus till my forearms and my stomach was just filled full of quills and I got to the place that I may as well stood up and ran at the anvelope there wasn't a deal figured out the range about 500 yards and I did everything I thought I knew how to do and I pulled the trigger and here's Mr Antelope standing there looking at me like who are you fooling and Ed his feet and four feet in front boom my bullet hits Mr antalope runs this huge circle I thought he ran off the mountain he ran over the edge of the mountain I think he was leaving and the Lord said go back but that anvelope ran down there and all of a sudden he appears again runs back within a few feet I'm talking few feet of where he stood before my little brain started doing some calculus trigonometry let's see that was 4 feet low and 4 feet in front of him boom knocked him down now my brother and sister I had prayed a prayer that probably I shouldn't admit I prayed could you guess what that was Lord if you'll just let me kill this analou I'll never doubt you again that's not a very spiritual prayer for a Christian but God took it anyway how else would you have something I know one thing a bullet hit four feet in front of me I ain't sto until I'm off the mountain but my brother and sister you see God knows and so it comes to a time and a place that God is proving to you and I in the day that we live in he wants us to zero in and I say God will do anything to get you there you understand what I'm talking about scripturally God's Own word he won't cross his own word he won't take you out of his word but here God will do anything to zero you in he'll let you be sick he'll let you be tired he'll let you be discouraged he'll let you be broke he'll do anything to get you to come to the place you zero in on the word amen amen you see what's important to you is important to God Amen why otherwise how could God give this I'll be done in just a minute how could God say ask anything in my name come on the world asks and they get their Bentleys and they're Maseratis and they get that and they say see God's with us but he knew the bride of Christ would not ask a Miss amen more of you Lord amen less of me Lord more of you and he will honor that my brother and sister oh it's not about our wealth about our Fame about whatever it is he will honor your prayer less of me Lord and more of you and he'll answer that every single time okay are you guys okay for a few more minutes I I'm going to throw a a curveball I used to be able to throw one let's see if I can throw it today so in the last little bit I've come across several deals some ministers speaking about this and different things and we'll look at a time this is not a political rally but we're going to talk politics for a minute okay we're coming to a time we have a woman who's the vice president trying to be the president and there are those that are saying yep she's the Fulfillment of Prophecy trying to figure out who would agree she's a fulfillment of Prophecy of that woman that will come now in the later seean Church age but there'll be a powerful woman look at the year 1960 powerful woman now remember this is on tape to a powerful woman great woman shall eat either be president or be a woman representing the Catholic Church which I think it is we'll take over here someday and she'll rule this country this nation is a woman's nation and so you look at this my brother and sister and we'll look back I should have just went ahead and included it but I was afraid I'd be too long and I'm too long anyway so I might as well just made it longer but he even says in in another place vice president so we're looking at this and some people are here today to say this is the Fulfillment there here it all is this is what's going to happen Cala is going to win got to fulfill this scripture but my brother and sister we have to have our thinking aligned with God's thinking we've got to come to the place that we're not thinking our thought we are thinking and speaking God's thoughts amen and I only cherry-picked just a little bit knowing that if I got full-blown into this you got that think it was a political rally but we do now brother Brown also said as I said vice president so she's already fulfilled that so if some are worried about that it's already fulfilled now we come down here once more I got some other notes between these but I think they're a little bit redundant so I'll skip over them uh in the sermon once more now notice now what Delilah did to Samson when she kept wooing him oh you're a great man you are powerful but don't deceive me tell me wherein lith your strength and she loved him and she made love to him until finally he gave in and what did they do the first thing she did she had his secret taken from him well that's the same thing that happened and you readers and Bible students and I see a council the wooing that's right the wooing the wooing you realize how powerful we can be joined together the old path of Pentecost wanted to stay with the word and they adopted some Pagan ideas through Constantine and them and and brought as Ahab married Jezebel and brought in idolatry into Israel so did the church marry into romanism and bring in idolatry right straight back in the church again so here we have a church that the power of God is moving they don't want to be left out isolated because you have to understand if you study the full history that many of those church leaders who said we will never never never Embrace that somehow had an accident fell down the stairs in their own house ran over by their own Chariot many things what do you do you eliminate opposition or add a word right right and another word that's right and another word until the word is so watered down they think they're believing truth right back in the straight in the church again now you've got a little bunch of harlots on the same principles and now look what's taking place mother is wooing and again she's going to shave all your rights away from you God help that we'll never give it up it's this word or death now that's pretty strong words right there my brother and sister but old Patrick Henry when it came to a country said Give me liberty or give me death and was willing to stand behind that just for The Birth of a Nation right how about for the Salvation of souls the Council of churches putting themselves together uniting in Fellowship around Rome exactly what the Bible said it would do yeah the Holy Spirit came one in uh 1933 Holy Spirit came one morning and told me seven things that would take place before this nation was destroyed one of them is that it's on an old paper here at the church many's looked at it uh how that we would go to war with Hitler and they how Germany would fortify and build the maano or the sigree line I believe it was 11 years before it's ever thought of and how that automobiles would constant constantly shape like eggs certainly is today and how that they would permit women to vote and in doing so they would elect the wrong president and this would be a woman stand up that would govern the United States not actually a woman but a church yes sir you see you can go back and find where it's talked about but he comes right here and says well it's not actually a woman if Kamala gets elected don't look at Kamala look for who's behind her it comes down to it what are you worried about if there's a bride in this last day don't look at the bride look who's behind her amen amen cuz you and I are not going to make a Rapture on our own Saints but Christ in you the hope of glory you are going to be victorious Overcomer and make a Rapture amen see it's not us it's him that's it hope you don't mind I say this you know it's got to be somebody behind her if you've listened to any of her talking yeah education yeah well we need to like yeah send um uh kids um they need School uh they they should they should be in school higher education yes yes they they should finish high school I'm just like oh mercy then I go my future is not in her hands that's right right thank you Lord cuz if it was my brother and sister we'd be in trouble but our future is in the hands of the king God Almighty the one who created heaven and earth amen made you and I individuals so unique that the world could identify you amen when I say that I'm talking about DNA and Etc so unique and God made us so unique he said I oh you brother tver Cox yes here you are right here in the palm of my hand praise the Lord yeah so unique he can identify us hallelujah my dad was a dairyman I don't know I think about the most he ever milked was about 90 cows back in that day was pretty good size knew every one of those cows by name my oh my and that was just a man almighty God thank you Lord yep not actually a woman but a church and I'm not saying this derogatory but there's still people that don't understand that it's not the woman that's right they're still looking still concerned oh she's the Fulfillment of Prophecy now she might be a tool that's God's using but it had nothing to do with what is taking place you know you guys have been to a puppet show before right that's what our Nations become a puppet show okay well I probably covered most of this well enough let me just close with this scripture 1 Corinthians 2 chapter but if say is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him you realize all that's prepared for you oh my but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God now my brother and sister when we look at that verse right there if we do not know the things that have been freely given to us we need to reorder our life we need to restructure Our lives our family our household our priori ities if we don't know because right here it tells us we will know and so we ought to get very serious and get in there and know what is been given to us hallelujah all the nonsense knock it out of it brother Lonnie Jenkins knocked it out of me years ago when I answered some questions I said something about hoping to be in the Rapture or something like that and he just set me down in a chair and just give me the what for there's no such thing is hope when it comes to making a Rapture you are called to it you need to know that you're part of it and you need to let it show in your life that you know it's a part of you hallelujah amen not hope a certainty because it says you will know that's have that certainty I'm going to make it and then ask the lord lord if there's something in my life that it isn't lining up Let the spirit of Truth come and correct me bring me to that right place am [Music] Hallelujah which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth we need a teacher all right Saints we need to be need to be taught and it's good that men ministers have a gift of of calling of being teachers but what we need more than the man with the calling of being a teacher is the holy SP Spirit teaching us hallelujah amen that'll teach young and old amen but what the Holy Spirit teaches Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned that's right I'm sorry but knowing Greek Hebrew aramic none of that will matter don't want to get sidetracked here but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ okay one last very brief quote here and I'm done okay not even an amen Christ revealed in his own word I believe it it needs no interpreter for the Bible said that God does his own interpreting of the Bible it is of no private interpretation said Peter all right and all the scripture is divinely given divinely set in order and the whole thing is the Rev ation of Jesus Christ can you imagine someone would come in the presence of God and wouldn't be able to explain the seals I can I met a few Brothers I won't say where don't want to be derogatory for a part of the world they wouldn't be able to put it to words and I've known those that were given a book and didn't even read English and by God's Divine pleasure they read the book eskimo brother in the hospital a heart attack and Anchorage they flew him from the village he was from he's in the hospital wakes up in the middle of the night and it's like it's playing on a screen in front of him and he's reading it he got out of bed got dressed went to a nephew's house borrowed a snowmobile rode hundreds literally hundreds of miles across the tundra that God built in GPS that he gave them shows
