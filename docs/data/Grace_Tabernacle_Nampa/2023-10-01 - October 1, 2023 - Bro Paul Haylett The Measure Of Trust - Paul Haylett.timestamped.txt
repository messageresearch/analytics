[37:52] this morning he he sent me a message and
[37:55] we message back and forth and bring
[37:57] greetings to you from Brother Andrew
[37:59] amen I want to speak to you this morning
[38:02] on the measure of trust we've been
[38:05] looking at all these different measures
[38:07] that God has given to us yes thank you
[38:10] musicians a lovely song service today
[38:13] amen God's given us many many majors my
[38:16] brother and sister and the beauty of it
[38:18] is is God knows exactly how much we
[38:24] now we can sit here and say if I just
[38:27] had and I know this sometimes sounds
[38:29] redundant but I believe God lays it on
[38:31] her heart because it's still necessary
[38:33] to be heard we say if I had more faith
[38:36] I'm sorry God has given you the measure
[38:38] of faith oh you know I I seem to fall
[38:42] down and make mistakes God's given you a
[38:45] measure of Grace
[38:46] and when we totally bomb it
[38:49] he's given us a measure of Mercy
[38:52] that is sufficient
[38:55] my brother and sister we wouldn't call
[38:57] ourselves Christians if we didn't think
[38:59] that the blood of Jesus Christ is
[39:01] sufficient
[39:02] amen that should in itself give us
[39:05] enough confidence
[39:07] to just press forward and to take the
[39:10] promises of God I have an interesting
[39:13] way I want to preach to you today very
[39:15] very lengthy 22 verses Isaac 36 1-22 and
[39:20] we're only drawing a principle out of
[39:22] this story it's not really so much about
[39:26] this story as it is that we recognize
[39:29] the Satan has always used the same
[39:32] tactics he modifies it the age but he is
[39:37] not coming up with a whole new story
[39:39] because you see what worked in the first
[39:41] church age for the devil worked in the
[39:44] second and worked in the third the
[39:45] fourth the fifth the sixth and now we're
[39:48] coming to a showdown
[39:49] you ever really thought about what a
[39:51] showdown is
[39:52] it is the grand finale
[39:55] there will not be a showdown Beyond this
[39:59] my brother and sister the grand finale
[40:01] now we realize when we go in the
[40:04] Millennium and then Satan is loosed
[40:07] again
[40:08] that there's going to be chaos
[40:11] pardon me for speaking this way but it
[40:13] will be hell on Earth
[40:14] a great chaos will come upon the Earth
[40:17] at that time and my brother and sister
[40:19] my heart aches for everyone who has been
[40:22] uh lackadaisical has been uh calloused
[40:26] has been uh non-committed to be in that
[40:30] day to have to face that chaos
[40:35] you know I I read a lovely little bit of
[40:38] history of a family that did tremendous
[40:41] amount of work they went as spies and
[40:43] Couriers to to help in World War II a
[40:46] family of Jewish descent
[40:48] and um they were living in Austria
[40:52] and one day the grandfather says we
[40:54] should leave
[40:56] and they said why life is still good
[40:58] it's not us they're after
[41:04] and the Grandfather said we should leave
[41:08] and it's a story about how this family
[41:10] and the persecution they suffered and to
[41:13] his dying breath the Grandfather said we
[41:15] should have listened to God's voice and
[41:18] left I'm I'm leaving
[41:22] Hallelujah I'm leaving
[41:24] he's called us to leave he's asked us to
[41:27] get ready to leave he's asked us to
[41:29] unpack and then repack amen and I want
[41:32] to listen to that voice because I don't
[41:34] want to be as it were living in the
[41:36] ghetto of laodicea saying I wished I
[41:39] would have listened
[41:41] hmm Isaiah 36 and 1 we'll read a few
[41:45] portions of scripture and then we'll be
[41:46] seated
[41:48] now it came to pass in the 14th year of
[41:51] King Hezekiah
[41:53] and somebody who has good English and
[41:56] Annunciation can go ahead and just speak
[41:58] out if you please
[42:00] uh I I don't even I honestly I don't
[42:03] even know if I attempt to read these
[42:05] because you know when we went to Israel
[42:07] there were certain things that I thought
[42:09] oh this is this is the name of this and
[42:12] then somebody local or the guide would
[42:14] say now we're in the blah blah and I'm
[42:16] like that's not what that says but he's
[42:18] local
[42:21] you take it like
[42:23] Colorado
[42:27] Salida the town of Salida south of
[42:30] Denver
[42:31] is it Salida
[42:34] Salida
[42:36] if you're from Idaho it's Salida
[42:42] so Lord help us
[42:45] Lord help us so I'm going to totally
[42:47] mispronounce these but I've asked for
[42:49] grace and mercy already okay
[42:52] now came to pass in the 14th year of
[42:55] King Hezekiah The Sinner here of king of
[42:58] Assyria came up against all the defense
[43:01] cities of Judah and took them in other
[43:05] words their defense was not sufficient
[43:08] my
[43:09] I'm defending myself praise God I'm
[43:13] sorry
[43:13] our defenses are not sufficient
[43:19] and the king of Assyria sent RAB shika
[43:23] to lock ish to Jerusalem and to King
[43:27] Hezekiah with a great Army and he stood
[43:30] by the conduit of the upper pool in the
[43:33] highway of the Fuller's field
[43:35] then came forth unto him elikum he'll
[43:39] tie his son which is over the house and
[43:42] shebna the Scribe and joa asked for his
[43:46] son the recorder and Reb Sheikh if I
[43:49] don't pronounce them the same each time
[43:51] you'll understand how I'm struggling
[43:53] said unto them say ye now to Hezekiah
[43:56] thus saith the great king the king of
[43:59] Assyria what confidence is this wherein
[44:03] thou trust us and I'm telling you my
[44:05] brother and sister the devil today is
[44:07] going to come to you and say
[44:11] you are trusting in what is this that
[44:15] you are putting your confidence in you
[44:18] are facing the same trial today that you
[44:20] faced last week last month last year
[44:22] what do you have your confidence in
[44:26] well I'll tell you my brother and sister
[44:28] the time comes that God says you know
[44:30] what you've stood you believed you stood
[44:32] solid you didn't turn and run you didn't
[44:34] doubt
[44:36] and today is the day
[44:38] I want to be standing there on the day
[44:41] that God says and today is the day
[44:44] amen I don't want to have quit yesterday
[44:46] I don't want to have quit this morning
[44:49] I'm going to be standing there even if
[44:52] this flesh is still
[44:56] and it will be
[44:57] our greatest in
[45:06] I say us now
[45:08] but they are but vain words I have
[45:10] counsel and strength for war now on whom
[45:14] Dost thou trust that thou rebellist
[45:17] against me Heavenly Father we ask for
[45:20] your blessings Lord lead us and guide us
[45:22] I pray in your precious name amen
[45:26] you may be seated Saints you know how
[45:28] isn't The Devil
[45:30] and the devil said that to you you know
[45:32] why do you try
[45:34] why do you keep pushing back why do you
[45:37] think that you can stand in this day and
[45:40] you can be an overcoming Christian in
[45:43] this day when you have failed so many
[45:46] times my brother and sister we stand
[45:49] today and believe that we are the
[45:51] Overcomers and declare that not because
[45:53] we are self-set it but Christ in US made
[45:56] the Declaration that we're the Overcomer
[45:58] of the age and so as we stand here the
[46:01] devil certainly is going to come and ask
[46:03] you why why do you even try why don't
[46:05] you just give in why don't you just be
[46:07] like everyone else because I am not you
[46:10] are not like everyone else amen and we
[46:13] recognize that what God has done and
[46:16] given to you and I while our flesh fails
[46:19] us but it's the promise of God that we
[46:22] live in and live for amen it is not
[46:25] going to be that we'll stand on the
[46:27] streets of glory and be able to say you
[46:30] know I was a really special guy I did
[46:32] this and I did that the only thing we'll
[46:34] be able to say is I just surrendered I
[46:38] just went and gave myself to the Lord
[46:39] and said whatever Lord you desire to use
[46:42] me for if I am as the prophet showed us
[46:45] if I'm going to be the janitor I want to
[46:48] be a good janitor if I'm going to be he
[46:51] said if you're going to be a bum never
[46:53] work a day in your life amen I'm telling
[46:57] you my brother and sister most of us we
[46:59] broke that way when we were children
[47:01] amen God don't want bums amen God
[47:04] doesn't want a bunch of people that are
[47:05] just lazy it's there that we realize
[47:08] that God has come and we have something
[47:11] in us that clearly identifies us as
[47:15] different
[47:17] as children as young people we strive
[47:19] and try so hard to fit in
[47:24] and God says I don't want you to fit in
[47:27] I want you to stand out amen because
[47:30] when you stand out then the light is
[47:32] shining when you stand out the gospel is
[47:35] alive in your community
[47:37] amen
[47:39] Hallelujah
[47:43] Lo thou trust us in the staff of this
[47:46] broken Reed on Egypt
[47:49] whereon if a man lean it will go into
[47:52] his hand and Pierce it so is Pharaoh
[47:55] king of Egypt to all that trust in him
[47:58] that's one portion I can say Amen you
[48:00] start trusting Pharaoh my brother and
[48:02] sister and he's going to pierce you and
[48:05] he's going to bring grief to you he's
[48:07] going to do all of these things but God
[48:09] used Pharaoh amen and if there's a
[48:12] pharaoh in your world today don't sit
[48:15] there and curse that but you sit back
[48:17] and say God did you place this Pharaoh
[48:21] in my life for a purpose and God does
[48:24] knew nothing my brother and sister for
[48:26] vanity does nothing in vain he is there
[48:30] whatever it is you say but man this guy
[48:32] my boss persecutes me well fulfill the
[48:35] scripture and say thank you sir you're
[48:37] fulfilling the word of God Amen he might
[48:41] persecute you worse for it but I'll tell
[48:43] you somebody's going to fulfill that
[48:45] word and we can't have everybody
[48:47] pampering us amen not everybody can just
[48:50] make us the star employee or the star
[48:52] personality someone's going to persecute
[48:55] you and I'll tell you what God will do
[48:57] he will use the common every day to
[49:00] cause you and I to get desperate to get
[49:03] out of here but not to get out of here
[49:05] for getting out of here's sake but to
[49:07] get out of their presence into his
[49:10] presence amen that's what it's all about
[49:12] not just a oh Lord give me a better life
[49:15] amen oh I'll tell you I want a better
[49:17] life because I have eternal life I know
[49:19] I have better life and I want to go
[49:21] right back to the source of eternal life
[49:23] because that's where we came from amen
[49:26] and so it's there oh my brother and
[49:29] sister I tell you God is good to us but
[49:32] if thou say to me we trust in the Lord
[49:35] our God
[49:36] is it not he whose high places and whose
[49:40] altar Hezekiah has taken away now let me
[49:43] just throw a little history in here
[49:45] remember before God comes and shows
[49:47] great Mercy on Hezekiah that Hezekiah
[49:50] had got lifting up he he had come to a
[49:53] place as a king that he'd made so many
[49:55] good Investments he had made so many
[49:58] good decisions he had he had fulfilled
[50:02] you might say in the natural many many
[50:04] good things and had come to a place that
[50:07] he himself in the mirror had looked and
[50:10] thought you know what I'm a great king
[50:12] and God said you know what I know your
[50:14] heart deep down Hezekiah even more so
[50:17] which is an interesting thing of the
[50:19] world we live in today my brother and
[50:21] sister that people are saying well we
[50:23] believe God meant this people who don't
[50:25] know their own mind are saying this is
[50:28] what God meant no my brother and sister
[50:30] what we do is sit back and say Lord let
[50:33] us have your mind so I can understand
[50:35] Lord not explain you not not counsel you
[50:39] but I could understand what it is that
[50:42] you want from me Lord because I will be
[50:44] what you want me to be Lord because I
[50:46] will surrender to that
[50:53] we trust in the Lord our God is it not
[50:56] he
[50:57] now my brother and sister
[50:59] they're almost being mocked here
[51:03] but if thou say to me we trust in the
[51:06] Lord our God is it not he whose high
[51:10] places whose altars Hezekiah has taken
[51:12] away and said to Judah and to Jerusalem
[51:15] ye shall worship before this worship
[51:17] before this altar
[51:19] now some of this my brother and sister
[51:21] we have to remember that Through the
[51:23] Ages God has always brought a judgment
[51:24] back into Israel when they would start
[51:26] to allow the the worship in the Groves
[51:30] and start to have the things taken as it
[51:34] were now my brother and sister anytime
[51:37] leadership starts to remove all the
[51:40] vessels now catch this it's more of a a
[51:42] parable in a sense but anytime
[51:44] leadership started to remove the vessels
[51:47] from the house of God and put them in
[51:50] storage
[51:52] we got a little storage room right here
[51:53] you know we're going to just start
[51:55] taking the things of God we're going to
[51:57] start taking the hard line of the
[51:59] message and we're gonna not get We're
[52:02] Not Gonna Get rid of it nobody's going
[52:03] to be able to come into Grace and say
[52:05] you guys have got rid of the hard line
[52:07] of the message but what we're storing it
[52:10] here out of sight out of mind
[52:17] God said no I want the vessels of the
[52:19] temple to be in the temple and I want
[52:21] the vessels of the temple to be used as
[52:23] I ordain them to be used I want the word
[52:26] to do the words work I don't need man to
[52:30] replace the words work with their work I
[52:34] want my word to do the work
[52:37] amen and when we allow the word of God
[52:39] to come into the temple and do its work
[52:42] then the temple is Holy
[52:45] the temple is a dwelling place to
[52:47] Almighty
[52:49] and so you know people didn't like that
[52:51] but while Hezekiah being lifted up
[52:54] didn't mean he was a complete departure
[52:56] from the things of God and and that's
[52:58] one of the things that we find confusing
[53:00] and I don't want to get into all kinds
[53:03] of political direction today but my
[53:05] brother and sister you look around the
[53:07] message and you'll say oh this brother
[53:09] quit and that brother quit they in many
[53:12] cases for years still fulfilled the work
[53:16] of God and their own heart was not in it
[53:20] you see God doesn't want us just to
[53:23] fulfill it as a wrote as a letter to do
[53:26] it and check it off but God wants a
[53:28] heart amen he wants a heart that says
[53:31] Lord if you want worship Lord I Will
[53:34] Worship You from the hearts not just uh
[53:37] when the song leader says let's worship
[53:39] god oh yes we're supposed to do that but
[53:42] let it be from My Heart Lord
[53:45] Hallelujah and that's why I just go back
[53:48] and like I said I don't want to delve
[53:49] into that I'm going to go back my
[53:51] brother and sister that's how you see
[53:53] churches that were on fire cooling off
[53:58] tapering away until they're able to tell
[54:02] you their long tradition of being
[54:04] message Believers I don't care about
[54:07] yesterday
[54:08] I don't care about what God did
[54:10] yesterday you're going to say what
[54:11] brother Paul well just follow me I don't
[54:14] care what he did my God's present here
[54:17] today he's alive today he's a Healer
[54:19] today he's a deliverer today he's the
[54:22] word today
[54:25] we don't have to look backwards
[54:27] he's present
[54:31] Hallelujah
[54:34] I hope you don't mind me being excited
[54:36] today
[54:40] whose altars hezekiah's taken away and
[54:42] said to Jude in Jerusalem he shall
[54:44] worship before this altar now therefore
[54:47] give pledges I pray thee to my master
[54:50] the king of Assyria and I will give thee
[54:52] 2 000 horses if thou be able on thine
[54:55] part to set Riders upon them well I'll
[54:58] tell you what my brother and sister if
[54:59] the devil's going to give you a gift
[55:01] he'll give you someone to drive that
[55:02] gift
[55:03] yeah I'm telling you what when the devil
[55:06] decides he's going to give you a lot of
[55:08] money he'll give you a lot of money if
[55:10] he's going to give you Authority he'll
[55:12] give you a lot of authority all the
[55:14] little features you can do that the
[55:16] devil's generous
[55:18] because he don't care whether you
[55:19] deserve it or not
[55:22] because he's never done it for your
[55:24] benefit he's done it for his own
[55:30] my
[55:32] right right
[55:36] you know there's a
[55:39] man that
[55:41] was in Mexico and now in glory
[55:47] worked for the cartels
[55:50] probably made them billions of dollars
[55:56] but what we would seemingly think is
[55:58] impossible that a man in that condition
[56:01] it's maybe a tad bit of speculation to
[56:04] say that he's even responsible for
[56:05] people losing their lives
[56:08] certainly responsible for people losing
[56:10] their lives from overdose and their
[56:12] lives wasted from drugs
[56:15] comes in contact
[56:18] with the Sun
[56:26] and it's there influencing him day after
[56:28] day words that he can't get out of his
[56:31] mind
[56:34] and even as they baptized him
[56:39] his cry was
[56:41] Lord fill me with the Holy Ghost
[56:43] my days
[56:45] are not long
[56:47] less than a week he's dead
[56:50] all the years of faithful service to the
[56:54] king of Assyria
[56:56] didn't earn him one drop of Grace
[57:01] but here are you with me
[57:03] but here's a thief on the cross
[57:06] who just gives acknowledgment to our
[57:08] Lord Jesus Christ
[57:10] and he says this day you know we can
[57:13] theologically argue well Jesus didn't go
[57:16] to paragraph Paradise so how could he be
[57:18] that day with Paradise my brother and
[57:20] sister our Lord Jesus Christ God however
[57:22] you want to turn it is all-encompassing
[57:25] he's everything he's Heaven he's Earth
[57:27] he's everything and he says this day
[57:30] you'll be with me in Paradise with
[57:32] speaking to the soul of a man who had
[57:35] nothing
[57:36] to claim
[57:38] and yet was given Grace
[57:40] see the nature of man
[57:43] and the nature of God
[57:46] one says if you're not sold out to me
[57:49] I'll kill you another one says if you're
[57:52] not sold out to me
[57:54] I'll give you Grace
[57:56] till you realize how desperately you
[57:59] need me amen
[58:03] as we look at this
[58:09] how then will thou turn away
[58:12] the face of one captain of the least of
[58:14] my master servants and put thy Trust on
[58:17] Egypt for chariots and for Horsemen and
[58:20] am I now come up without the Lord
[58:22] against this land to destroy it the Lord
[58:25] said unto me now look at this my brother
[58:27] and sister this is how clever the devil
[58:29] is that we'd often times look at this
[58:32] and say you know what
[58:34] um you know they got no Authority you
[58:37] realize that God gave the devil
[58:39] permission right
[58:44] right and that would discourage some
[58:45] people and say why would God do that
[58:47] well God knew what was in you
[58:49] right
[58:50] I'll tell you what aren't you glad
[58:52] you're a chip off the old block
[58:54] aren't you glad that the very nature of
[58:56] God has been deposited in you you say
[58:59] but if I have the nature of God where's
[59:01] it at well let it out let it out you
[59:03] know if you got the door nailed shut
[59:05] it's not going to come out but if you'll
[59:07] ever have courage enough enough trust in
[59:10] God to start pulling the nails out of
[59:12] the door you will see God do great
[59:14] things in your life and those around you
[59:17] but you know we're kind of afraid I
[59:19] think I think some of the brothers are
[59:21] right we're actually afraid to really
[59:23] see God move in an upper room type
[59:26] experience we're afraid to actually lose
[59:29] control of our self and our emotion
[59:32] because well we don't want to be
[59:34] embarrassed or it might not be the right
[59:36] thing we'll take it through the word
[59:38] first and it will be the right thing
[59:40] amen because if it don't go through the
[59:42] filter it won't reach you and so
[59:44] therefore you can live all that God
[59:46] allows through the filter to reach you
[59:48] you can live that will you live that do
[59:52] you want to live that I say Lord I Want
[59:55] To Live every bit of your word that has
[59:57] come to me I want to live that
[1:00:00] amen I don't want to be over here
[1:00:02] filtering what God's already filtered
[1:00:04] well I don't know about this and I don't
[1:00:06] know about that run it through the
[1:00:08] filter let the filter do its work let
[1:00:12] the Life of Christ in you do its work
[1:00:16] then you don't have to be a skeptic to
[1:00:18] everyone that shares anything to you
[1:00:22] you know it either is the word or it
[1:00:25] isn't but I'll tell you you know I'll
[1:00:28] take you back to a little practical
[1:00:29] natural thing you know oh hey this motor
[1:00:33] has quit why did it quit it's starved
[1:00:35] for fuel the fuel filter's plugged
[1:00:39] let's just eliminate the filter
[1:00:41] and that eliminates the problem
[1:00:45] said no mechanic ever
[1:00:51] because whatever plugged the filter
[1:00:53] is going to plug the carburetor or the
[1:00:56] injection pump
[1:00:58] so we've got some that said you know
[1:01:00] what the preacher he's clogging up my
[1:01:03] filter I'm going to eliminate them
[1:01:05] and then they wonder my brother and
[1:01:07] sister how it is they went from a
[1:01:09] fervent burning desire to a fanatic
[1:01:14] oh I'm sorry that was a little straight
[1:01:16] isn't it because that's what's happening
[1:01:19] they're moving from being on fire
[1:01:20] turning into fanatics
[1:01:22] amen and it's entirely different a
[1:01:25] fanatic doesn't have to be on fire a
[1:01:27] fanatic is just simply a fanatic
[1:01:29] amen has to have no uh or a rhyme no
[1:01:33] reason no Foundation it is as they
[1:01:37] declare it to be
[1:01:39] so we want to be on fire but we don't
[1:01:41] want to be fanatics
[1:01:45] Hallelujah this rate will be here
[1:01:47] tomorrow
[1:01:49] so let me go right on down through here
[1:01:52] and bounce a few of these instead of
[1:01:54] reading every bit of it so he says you
[1:01:56] know what it's the Lord that said to me
[1:01:58] go up against this land destroy it and
[1:02:00] like I said God gives permission amen he
[1:02:02] he opened the Hedge he let the devil in
[1:02:05] to job but he wasn't the least bit you
[1:02:07] didn't see God creeping around the edge
[1:02:09] of the head job you could do it
[1:02:11] job you can do it in fact God almost
[1:02:15] looked to callous
[1:02:19] look at old job down there
[1:02:21] scraping them boils with a pot shard
[1:02:26] that's my son
[1:02:30] you're not treating him like a son
[1:02:32] yes I am because the word says that
[1:02:35] Jesus learned
[1:02:37] by the adversity the trials the tests
[1:02:42] anybody got your exemption card today
[1:02:47] Hallelujah you can print almost anything
[1:02:49] off the internet maybe you can find an
[1:02:51] exemption card but you won't find it in
[1:02:52] the word
[1:02:54] amen we're going to be tested the word's
[1:02:57] going to prove Who We Are
[1:02:59] so just because it looks like God's
[1:03:01] allowing this to happen in your life is
[1:03:03] not God forsaking you it's God proving
[1:03:06] you it's God saying I'm going to take
[1:03:08] the layer of your personality I'm going
[1:03:10] to take the layers of your understanding
[1:03:13] I'm going to take the layers of your
[1:03:15] stubborn spirit and I'm going to scrape
[1:03:17] them away with the pot Shard of the word
[1:03:20] until we get down to living flesh
[1:03:24] and I want to be living flesh for God I
[1:03:27] don't want to be Scar Tissue I don't
[1:03:29] want to be some callous my brother and
[1:03:31] sister I want to be living flesh
[1:03:34] Hallelujah
[1:03:36] and so it's there what happened we
[1:03:38] jumped down in the scripture a little
[1:03:39] bit he said you know hey uh let me speak
[1:03:42] to them in another language and not the
[1:03:45] language of the Jews in other words we
[1:03:47] want another language and let me tell
[1:03:49] you my brother and sister there's
[1:03:50] another language has invaded our world
[1:03:53] and is speaking to people and they're
[1:03:55] hearing another language it's not God's
[1:03:58] voice they're hearing it's another voice
[1:04:00] another language that is being there
[1:04:03] speaking to them wooing them in a
[1:04:06] language of laodicea and laodicea has
[1:04:09] invaded the church laodicea has its
[1:04:12] voice in the church my brother and
[1:04:14] sister I'm telling you God help us go
[1:04:16] back to the original voice go back to
[1:04:19] the original word we don't need an
[1:04:21] interpretation of what God meant we need
[1:04:23] to hear that voice
[1:04:25] and when we hear that voice we'll know
[1:04:27] it's his voice because something inside
[1:04:29] of us says that's my father speaking
[1:04:34] and I want to be I'll tell you my
[1:04:36] brother and sister I want to be one God
[1:04:39] help me I want to become one that when
[1:04:42] God speaks I stop and say Lord if you
[1:04:46] said stop I stop and if you say left I'm
[1:04:49] left you say right I'm right but well
[1:04:52] what do we do we're kind of like a truck
[1:04:54] with bad breaks we just roll on and on
[1:04:57] and on until we come to a stop
[1:05:04] now what was you saying to me
[1:05:12] I don't want to get caught up but I got
[1:05:14] I got so many little real life things
[1:05:16] that go with this
[1:05:18] Hallelujah
[1:05:22] verse 13 he tells them
[1:05:24] cries with a loud voice the Jewish
[1:05:26] language it says
[1:05:29] hear ye the words of the great king
[1:05:32] of Assyria
[1:05:35] thus saith the king oh my we got the
[1:05:38] saith here
[1:05:40] thus saith the king let not Hezekiah
[1:05:44] deceive you
[1:05:46] for he shall not be able to deliver you
[1:05:49] and I'll read that verse right there and
[1:05:51] I'm saying praise the Lord that's right
[1:05:53] there is no way on hezekiah's part he
[1:05:57] can deliver these people Hezekiah is not
[1:06:01] able to deliver them but I want you to
[1:06:04] understand this and I'm not defending
[1:06:06] the preacher it's God who put that in
[1:06:08] place not me there's times I think Lord
[1:06:10] why did you put me there I'm not
[1:06:13] comfortable here I can't do this Lord
[1:06:15] but I'm telling you what happens is the
[1:06:17] devil starts with removing certain
[1:06:20] voices from our life
[1:06:24] young people please listen to me for a
[1:06:27] moment
[1:06:28] when voices come that tell you
[1:06:31] everything that is around you everything
[1:06:34] that God has nurtured in you is a lie
[1:06:37] it's not the truth come with us you can
[1:06:39] live free you need to stop because
[1:06:42] there's never a time you're drawn to
[1:06:44] hear unless they can cut you off from
[1:06:47] there and so as they cut you off they
[1:06:50] can move you into their world and here
[1:06:52] is a voice saying don't trust Hezekiah
[1:06:55] he can't deliver you there should have
[1:06:57] been someone with enough courage in the
[1:06:59] church to have said that's the truth
[1:07:01] preacher you can't deliver me oh but
[1:07:05] neither let Hezekiah make you trust in
[1:07:08] the Lord
[1:07:09] see where they were heading it wasn't
[1:07:11] about whether you could trust Hezekiah
[1:07:13] or not when they got past Hezekiah they
[1:07:16] went right to the Lord and said you
[1:07:18] can't trust him either
[1:07:24] wow
[1:07:28] saying the Lord will certainly Deliver
[1:07:31] Us
[1:07:32] no my brother and sister the devil don't
[1:07:34] want you to believe you can be delivered
[1:07:36] the devil wants you to think that this
[1:07:38] bondage he's got you wind is permanent
[1:07:41] it's what you deserve and we're right
[1:07:43] here under anointings we're right here
[1:07:46] under influence saying that's the truth
[1:07:48] that's what I deserve
[1:07:50] if we're here about deserve let's go
[1:07:52] home my brother and sister let's just go
[1:07:55] home because there's not one thing we
[1:07:57] deserve
[1:07:59] if we got what we deserve the prophet of
[1:08:01] God even said that if I got what I
[1:08:03] deserve he'd send me to hell but I would
[1:08:05] serve him anyhow
[1:08:07] amen it's not going to be about what I
[1:08:10] deserve it's about what God has decided
[1:08:12] of who you are and what we are and why
[1:08:15] he has called us is God who said I
[1:08:18] didn't ask if you were capable I didn't
[1:08:20] ask if you deserved it I gave it to you
[1:08:23] as a gift
[1:08:25] a gift of life
[1:08:28] amen something he poured out upon us
[1:08:32] oh my
[1:08:34] so here he is now he starts to bring up
[1:08:37] some of these gods that they've allowed
[1:08:39] you know Israel was just horrible you
[1:08:42] see evidence when you go tour Israel you
[1:08:44] see evidence here a guide if he knows
[1:08:46] his history will point out well this
[1:08:48] used to be this kind of pagan thing in
[1:08:50] the woods and that pile of stones over
[1:08:52] there was this over here and my brother
[1:08:55] and sister it wasn't like you know uh
[1:08:58] I'm telling you what you know you go
[1:09:02] down to Georgia
[1:09:05] Bible Belt
[1:09:07] and the devil's just as thick in Georgia
[1:09:10] as he is anywhere else on the face of
[1:09:13] the Earth it's the Bible Belt well maybe
[1:09:17] the devil went to church
[1:09:20] did you guys see that little statement
[1:09:22] thing uh you know
[1:09:26] the devil's a believer
[1:09:28] but he's not a Christian
[1:09:34] come on
[1:09:37] beliefs
[1:09:38] when God speaks he believes
[1:09:40] just go study through the scripture I
[1:09:42] went through the Old Testament just
[1:09:44] looking at some things and you'll see my
[1:09:46] brother and sister that the being cast
[1:09:48] out many times they started to say hey
[1:09:51] don't don't do this let us we'll leave
[1:09:53] voluntarily and what did Jesus say to
[1:09:56] them coming out of the Old Testament the
[1:09:58] principles coming into the New Testament
[1:10:00] in the Old Testament they got away with
[1:10:02] these things in a sense you would say
[1:10:03] comes to the New Testament now and Jesus
[1:10:06] says be silent
[1:10:10] you don't even get a voice what's
[1:10:12] happening to you demon you are cast out
[1:10:15] you are bound
[1:10:17] oh come on I'm sorry but my brother and
[1:10:19] sister it's about time we quit coming to
[1:10:23] the point we're gonna have a truce with
[1:10:25] the devil we're going to try and build
[1:10:26] our own wall around the devil's wall
[1:10:29] it's about time we just simply kick him
[1:10:31] out
[1:10:32] tell him to shut up and leave
[1:10:34] amen
[1:10:36] amen and so what happens they start to
[1:10:39] kind of through their words mocking and
[1:10:41] then you know they held their peace they
[1:10:43] didn't even answer going into verse 21
[1:10:45] because the Commandment given to them
[1:10:47] was answer him not
[1:10:50] you know sometimes my brother and sister
[1:10:52] we've been given the answer to the
[1:10:53] devil's question
[1:10:55] but we don't even have to speak it
[1:10:57] how about we just live it
[1:10:59] how about we just get up and let our
[1:11:01] answer be our life
[1:11:04] instead of trying to explain to each and
[1:11:05] every one
[1:11:06] oh my brother and sister
[1:11:09] now I've went so long to get to this
[1:11:12] point have my sermon I I've taken the
[1:11:14] time more than half oh my I'm shocked
[1:11:17] but I want you to just draw out of this
[1:11:21] and look at this we're besieged in this
[1:11:22] land that we call America United States
[1:11:26] there is evil on every hand
[1:11:28] a lot of drama taking place
[1:11:30] we got men in high places my brother and
[1:11:33] sister can't even balance a budget can't
[1:11:35] even run a country and you recognize
[1:11:37] that some of these men many of these men
[1:11:40] were successful and still are successful
[1:11:43] businessmen that can run multi-million
[1:11:46] or billion dollar companies can't manage
[1:11:48] our government why in their business
[1:11:50] they were just maybe Blessed from their
[1:11:52] business ability but now they've stepped
[1:11:54] into a role that God said I've cursed
[1:11:58] and they can't get it right they can't
[1:12:00] make the right decision because now
[1:12:01] they're pushing against the will of God
[1:12:03] and they will never overcome the will of
[1:12:06] God and we look and say what's wrong
[1:12:09] with these people my brother and sister
[1:12:11] it's really not what's wrong with them
[1:12:12] they are nothing but Tools in God's hand
[1:12:16] amen and so God moves him and uses them
[1:12:20] in a fashion that he desires
[1:12:23] I had a conversation with a brother here
[1:12:25] recently and he was going on will the
[1:12:27] government plan this thing brother Paul
[1:12:28] and they're doing this this way and
[1:12:30] they're doing them bringing this around
[1:12:31] here and I I'm sorry you know we're on
[1:12:34] the telephone I'm glad he couldn't see
[1:12:35] me because I was kind of like yeah okay
[1:12:40] but let me tell you something I'm
[1:12:41] excited about
[1:12:42] the word is opening
[1:12:44] life is coming down the sun is rising
[1:12:48] and shining on the wheat and bringing
[1:12:51] her to maturity and she is changing in
[1:12:54] the presence of the sun that's what I
[1:12:57] get excited about what some lion
[1:12:59] cheating heathens doing now I don't care
[1:13:02] about that he's doing what God called
[1:13:04] him to do but I know what God called you
[1:13:07] and I to do and that is to soak up the
[1:13:09] sun amen draw in the presence of
[1:13:12] almighty God pull it in and let it bring
[1:13:15] life to you
[1:13:17] oh hallelujah amen a lot of drama taking
[1:13:21] place but I want to ask you is that
[1:13:23] drama part of your story
[1:13:26] known sir
[1:13:28] no sir it's in the start part of a big
[1:13:30] picture
[1:13:31] but in your story
[1:13:34] standing in the presence of almighty God
[1:13:39] in my wedding gown
[1:13:41] wrapped in the word
[1:13:44] moved by the word
[1:13:46] wooed by the word
[1:13:50] that's my story that should be your
[1:13:52] story
[1:13:53] amen because I'll tell you what your
[1:13:56] story is God's story
[1:13:58] as the bride of Christ Our Story my
[1:14:00] brother and sister is God's story we
[1:14:02] don't have a separate story I need an
[1:14:04] identity I want my identity to be in
[1:14:06] Christ amen I'll tell you it's certainly
[1:14:09] not a laodicean story
[1:14:11] I'm just going to be lukewarm and
[1:14:13] fulfill that part of the story sorry I
[1:14:15] don't want to belong in that story I
[1:14:17] want to belong in a story where somebody
[1:14:19] says wow I got to do something I'm on
[1:14:22] fire
[1:14:23] Hallelujah you know what happens when
[1:14:25] people get on fire everybody else runs
[1:14:27] gets a bucket of water
[1:14:29] throws it on him we can't have you on
[1:14:31] fire
[1:14:32] somehow that might hurt you
[1:14:34] well maybe what we ought to do
[1:14:36] now I'll save this with
[1:14:38] proper etiquette whatever
[1:14:40] uh maybe we should just be
[1:14:43] hugging each other so to speak
[1:14:44] spiritually let's put it that way until
[1:14:46] we're all on fire
[1:14:49] instead of running around with a fire
[1:14:50] hose in the church you know putting out
[1:14:53] the fire maybe we should let God's fire
[1:14:55] now I'm not talking about crazy
[1:14:57] theatrics my brother and sister watch
[1:14:59] the video sometime back that somebody
[1:15:01] you know ended the wonder of the world
[1:15:03] we live in nobody could have filmed this
[1:15:04] years ago but now everybody's got a
[1:15:06] phone there's probably ten thousand
[1:15:07] versions out there some guy running down
[1:15:09] the backs of the pews I wonder if they
[1:15:11] were bolted down
[1:15:13] or maybe he's truly anointed he'd become
[1:15:15] weightless
[1:15:19] well he had to have had the Holy Ghost
[1:15:21] to done that
[1:15:23] or worked in the circus for a season
[1:15:27] my brother and sister I had a
[1:15:28] conversation with a man yesterday
[1:15:31] called me up
[1:15:33] started off strange I won't give all the
[1:15:35] details
[1:15:36] Anyway said he had a need your church I
[1:15:40] need money
[1:15:41] okay that's straightforward enough
[1:15:43] what's your situation I got injured I've
[1:15:46] lost my job well he lost his job a long
[1:15:48] time ago I said well you know there's
[1:15:50] workman's comp
[1:15:52] uh there's unemployment there's all this
[1:15:55] stuff oh but the Lord led me and now I
[1:15:57] get goosebumps every time the Holy
[1:15:59] Spirit meets it I meet somebody and I
[1:16:00] get goosebumps I know that's God and I
[1:16:03] says well how do you know that a priest
[1:16:05] told me so
[1:16:09] now I'm not mocking this man I he was
[1:16:12] absolute sincere
[1:16:14] a priest told me that's what the
[1:16:15] evidence of the Holy Spirit was when I
[1:16:18] get these Goosebumps and I've been
[1:16:19] getting more and more and more of them
[1:16:24] I said have you ever run that through
[1:16:25] the word huh
[1:16:28] said no that's how you know if that's
[1:16:30] true
[1:16:31] you run it through the word
[1:16:33] have you taken it back to the word what
[1:16:36] does the word say Amen well let me tell
[1:16:38] you about this guy I met at a gas
[1:16:39] station
[1:16:41] no no no here draw you back
[1:16:45] that guy at the gas station got nothing
[1:16:46] to do with our conversation
[1:16:49] I said now our church is willing to help
[1:16:51] you you come to church today
[1:16:54] I don't think it's wrong to put a caveat
[1:16:56] on it is it Saints
[1:16:58] you come to church today and if you can
[1:17:00] endure preaching today and still be here
[1:17:02] when it's over we'll help you
[1:17:05] but he wasn't interested
[1:17:07] he was looking for a handout
[1:17:10] so he could drive around and share his
[1:17:12] version
[1:17:14] of what the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:15] was
[1:17:17] my brother and sister
[1:17:19] it's interesting world we live in
[1:17:22] now look at this I've got to hurry along
[1:17:23] here somebody say brother Paul hurry
[1:17:26] amen
[1:17:28] see now look we you know this is
[1:17:32] depending on the verbiage how you do it
[1:17:34] but uh we all look in the word of God in
[1:17:36] the Haven of Rest right do you realize
[1:17:38] my brother and sister we have a natural
[1:17:40] Haven of Rest amen and God called it for
[1:17:43] our homes right you just go back and and
[1:17:45] look what how brother Branham lays this
[1:17:47] out he lays the groundwork that with a
[1:17:49] token applied on her home that it
[1:17:51] becomes our Haven of Rest in the natural
[1:17:54] our security that we can move into and
[1:17:57] with the blood on our home on our lives
[1:18:00] then Satan cannot get under the blood
[1:18:03] right he can't come into the blood our
[1:18:06] home natural becomes a Haven of Rest to
[1:18:08] us but that's not sufficient we have to
[1:18:11] have a spiritual Haven that we can
[1:18:14] Retreat into as it were in the time of
[1:18:17] great trial we can come and as it was
[1:18:19] the scriptures talking about the eagle
[1:18:21] in the wilderness we have a refuge in
[1:18:24] the wilderness of laodicea that we can
[1:18:27] go into and that becomes a Haven of Rest
[1:18:29] for you and I and the onslaught as the
[1:18:32] prophet of God taught us it's uh this
[1:18:34] age you know the greatest mind battle my
[1:18:37] brother and sister if you don't have a
[1:18:39] Haven to retreat to in the onslaught of
[1:18:43] the devil in this day it will cause you
[1:18:46] to go crazy
[1:18:47] and I'm sorry to put it that blunt but
[1:18:50] it's the truth if we're gonna go into
[1:18:51] the Haven of laodicea then it will take
[1:18:54] us to the alleys and highways and byways
[1:18:57] and it will turn us into junk but God
[1:19:00] has a refuge for us amen now this is
[1:19:03] going to be another part of another
[1:19:04] sermon but I felt led to include this my
[1:19:07] brother and sister Satan knows you're in
[1:19:09] the land he can read the word of God
[1:19:11] just as well as anyone can read the word
[1:19:14] of God just as it was in the days of
[1:19:16] Herod and they knew that there was a
[1:19:19] Christ child in the land and herod's
[1:19:22] solution was to go and just start
[1:19:25] killing the children that's what we're
[1:19:27] going to do we're gonna kill the
[1:19:29] children and surely we'll get this
[1:19:31] Christ child if we can kill enough
[1:19:33] children and I'm telling you this world
[1:19:36] you look out here I'm going to be bold
[1:19:38] this morning we have a flaunting of
[1:19:41] young women as prostitutes do they
[1:19:44] arrest them and prosecute the people
[1:19:45] doing that no they have whole fashion
[1:19:49] line for them
[1:19:50] they have a whole out that for them what
[1:19:53] is that the devil says if I can kill the
[1:19:57] children maybe I could kill the last
[1:20:00] anointed ordained seed of God if I can
[1:20:04] catch him I could kill that and bind the
[1:20:07] whole program of God but what he doesn't
[1:20:10] know is there is a refuge there is a
[1:20:14] refuge and in the time of adversity he
[1:20:18] raises up a wall and protects you and I
[1:20:22] it's not a refuge of the mountain it's
[1:20:24] not Refuge of the desert it's a refuge
[1:20:27] of the Holy Ghost In You and I and
[1:20:31] people say I'm concerned about whether
[1:20:33] we can be deceived get the Holy Ghost
[1:20:35] you can't be deceived
[1:20:38] oh my brothers and sister
[1:20:41] you see what it is
[1:20:43] he knows on one side a direct assault
[1:20:46] against you and he's doing his best to
[1:20:49] come and antagonistic and send Spirits
[1:20:52] against you but it's there my brother
[1:20:54] and sister a direct assault of the word
[1:20:58] that's in you
[1:21:00] prophet of God when they said Oh Brother
[1:21:02] Brahma these thoughts he says just don't
[1:21:05] let the bird build the nest
[1:21:08] right right I don't even feel like I
[1:21:10] have the Holy Ghost brother Brown I have
[1:21:11] these
[1:21:12] knock the nest off
[1:21:15] knock the nest off replace it replace it
[1:21:18] with something else
[1:21:21] the word
[1:21:23] what a lovely replacement
[1:21:25] it's free it's everywhere
[1:21:27] yeah my you can't exhaust it you can't
[1:21:30] run out
[1:21:31] wow
[1:21:34] you see Satan knows there's a bride in
[1:21:36] the land you say well that's obvious
[1:21:37] that's obvious brother Paul no it's
[1:21:40] really not
[1:21:41] because you realize
[1:21:43] what we sometimes get callous enough
[1:21:46] that we don't even acknowledge the fact
[1:21:49] that some things we say and do
[1:21:51] aren't pleasing to God right
[1:21:53] if I could put it this simple it just
[1:21:56] that's right right over our head
[1:22:00] now I say that not condemning
[1:22:04] but when the devil sees
[1:22:07] that
[1:22:10] knowing how holy God is how pure God is
[1:22:16] and they just did this and said that and
[1:22:19] thought that
[1:22:21] they might not be the bride
[1:22:24] you see it's not so cut and dried to the
[1:22:26] devil either
[1:22:28] he's looking and saying they're making
[1:22:30] mistakes
[1:22:31] a righteous God of judgment
[1:22:34] you see the devil doesn't know what
[1:22:36] Grace is
[1:22:39] because he never repented
[1:22:42] and to know Grace
[1:22:45] you have to repent
[1:22:49] repentance is the key that unlocks Grace
[1:22:52] in our life
[1:22:55] Satan does not know Grace
[1:22:59] and so he's just decided I'll just kill
[1:23:02] a whole society
[1:23:03] around the whole world every nation
[1:23:05] every Kindred tongue because he read the
[1:23:06] book and said God's going to pull him
[1:23:08] out of every nation Kindred tongue I'll
[1:23:10] just kill him slaughter them wholesale
[1:23:12] but spirits of lust and pride and envy
[1:23:15] and alcohol and drugs and all the minor
[1:23:17] things that go with all of that and I'll
[1:23:19] just kill him wholesale because I've got
[1:23:22] to get the last one
[1:23:24] I've got to get the anointed one
[1:23:27] my brother and sister you realize if
[1:23:29] you're in Christ you're the anointed one
[1:23:30] right amen anointed to receive the word
[1:23:33] anointed to live the word you say oh
[1:23:35] you're replacing him no I'm not we're
[1:23:37] taking that anointing we're anointed to
[1:23:39] fulfill that position so we're the
[1:23:41] anointed one for the position that God
[1:23:43] called us to and my brother and sister
[1:23:45] the devil wants to kill you so you can't
[1:23:47] fulfill that position
[1:23:49] amen
[1:23:53] I think you guys did agree with me this
[1:23:54] morning
[1:23:55] the undermining of man's confidence in
[1:23:57] God
[1:23:58] is incredible
[1:24:03] talking to an individual here just very
[1:24:05] recently
[1:24:06] I just kind of put it out not flippantly
[1:24:08] but I just kind of put it out
[1:24:10] he said well you know this and this
[1:24:12] happened Paul and and uh I said wow
[1:24:16] and I made a comment to him and he says
[1:24:18] well
[1:24:19] you know
[1:24:22] I used to go to church and pray
[1:24:25] maybe it's good getting old
[1:24:28] and bold
[1:24:30] or I don't care
[1:24:32] you know I'm going to tell on you young
[1:24:34] people now the young adults I'm like now
[1:24:36] if I get boring and stuff you guys have
[1:24:38] to tell me and they all just
[1:24:41] and I thought I think they're telling me
[1:24:43] something

[1:24:49] I just told her I said
[1:24:52] why'd you stop

[1:26:26] do you guys remember here and his name
[1:26:28] is now I knew I should have wrote it
[1:26:30] down his name slipped my mind but there
[1:26:32] was a man who come to uh Kenneth
[1:26:34] Copeland and all the Pentecostals from
[1:26:36] the pope carrying a message to him I I
[1:26:40] can see his face but I cannot remember
[1:26:42] his name and he made some really bold
[1:26:45] statements that this this is God this is
[1:26:49] the voice of Elijah to this day and he
[1:26:53] dies in an accident on a motorcycle in
[1:26:55] England
[1:26:56] and then behind that rise is another
[1:26:59] great man not nearly as published or
[1:27:01] whatever as he was that was going around
[1:27:04] telling everybody that if you don't
[1:27:06] believe this you've been anointed by the
[1:27:08] spirit of the Holy Ghost and he dies in
[1:27:10] a car wreck Our God will not be mocked
[1:27:15] amen their voice my brother and sister
[1:27:17] is a great voice the World Hears that
[1:27:20] voice while they're over here demeaning
[1:27:23] One Voice they're promoting another
[1:27:25] voice and it's a great voice and they
[1:27:28] speak so well of that voice and it's
[1:27:31] there this God of this evil age is how
[1:27:33] the prophet said he said I'm the you

[1:28:16] thus saith the king of Assyria make an
[1:28:19] agreement with me by a present
[1:28:24] and come out
[1:28:26] to me
[1:28:28] well I'll tell you what the devil's
[1:28:29] doing my brother and sister in Romans 12
[1:28:31] 1-2 it says I beseech you therefore
[1:28:33] Brethren by the mercies of God that ye
[1:28:36] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[1:28:39] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[1:28:43] reasonable service and be not conformed
[1:28:46] to this world but be you transformed by
[1:28:49] the renewing of your mind that ye may
[1:28:51] prove what is not good and acceptable
[1:28:54] and perfect will of God I'm here to tell
[1:28:57] you there's only one thing on this Earth
[1:28:58] that's of value God's blessed sister
[1:29:01] Jerry and I with a little land amen
[1:29:03] we've worked hard we we're we're we're
[1:29:05] working towards that I guess it's just
[1:29:08] you know the farmer mentality you need
[1:29:10] dirt you're going to be a farmer you
[1:29:12] need dirt and that's well but I'm
[1:29:14] telling you my brother and sister
[1:29:15] there's nothing on this Earth that has
[1:29:17] the value of your soul that's right
[1:29:19] nothing no amount of land no amount of
[1:29:22] gold no amount of anything Fine Jewelry
[1:29:25] art whatever nothing matters the devil
[1:29:28] knows what is the intrinsic value and he
[1:29:31] says if I can get you to just come
[1:29:33] present yourself to me yeah I'll come I
[1:29:37] will accept you have you noticed the
[1:29:39] devil never rejects anyone
[1:29:43] my if the devil had a baseball team
[1:29:48] so what is it he's not looking at the
[1:29:50] flesh
[1:29:52] no looking at the flesh my brother and
[1:29:54] sister he's looking at this Soul he
[1:29:56] wants that soul I want that soul
[1:30:00] but God said come
[1:30:01] you present yourselves a Living
[1:30:03] Sacrifice I don't even want to kill you
[1:30:04] I want you living
[1:30:06] hallelujah amen but looks subtility
[1:30:10] Satan just comes I'm trying to jump over
[1:30:13] stuff sorry uh what's he doing
[1:30:16] he undermines our trust
[1:30:19] when you look at someone and you God
[1:30:21] allows you to bring conversation around
[1:30:23] in a certain fashion
[1:30:25] and finally you know you just realize
[1:30:27] what's happening and and you make a
[1:30:29] statement that can be just left alone
[1:30:31] taken either way whatever and then the
[1:30:34] person just opens up and says yeah
[1:30:37] you're right now I didn't say they had
[1:30:39] been angry at God
[1:30:40] but God discerned that and God opened
[1:30:43] that little deal now you're right I've
[1:30:46] been angry at God since I was a young
[1:30:48] woman
[1:30:50] why
[1:30:52] well when they tell you why
[1:30:55] you feel a little bit uh
[1:30:58] I think I almost need to sit down
[1:31:01] this is horrific
[1:31:05] and if God was a loving God why do you
[1:31:07] allow that to happen to me
[1:31:11] well I'll tell you there'll be a young
[1:31:12] lady sorry to be this bold there'll be a
[1:31:15] young lady in glory
[1:31:16] will have the exact same thing happen to
[1:31:19] her
[1:31:20] that will be standing at their pure and
[1:31:22] white Washed by the blood of the Lamb
[1:31:26] my brother and sister you see
[1:31:28] we
[1:31:30] have to recognize how special the gift
[1:31:33] God has given us
[1:31:36] this is not just I grew up in church or
[1:31:38] I I got saved my brother and sister this
[1:31:41] is an outpouring of the spirit of the
[1:31:44] very life of God out poured into you and
[1:31:48] I that nothing Satan can do can rob the
[1:31:51] life if so Satan would go over and shut
[1:31:53] the switch of eternal life off
[1:31:56] but he can't
[1:31:58] he can't amen oh outright anger you know
[1:32:02] thinking about this outright anger of
[1:32:04] unanswered prayers
[1:32:06] why did we lose this child why did this
[1:32:09] happen over here what was that
[1:32:11] unanswered prayers and outright anger to
[1:32:14] God
[1:32:16] not
[1:32:17] God's in control
[1:32:19] God's perfect will
[1:32:21] it is I wanted what I wanted and God
[1:32:25] didn't give it to me
[1:32:35] let me skip over some more
[1:32:44] I'm just going to go ahead and say this
[1:32:46] I almost skipped over
[1:32:49] sometime back in a conversation
[1:32:53] individual made a statement
[1:32:58] if the Lord does not come quickly
[1:33:00] no one will be saved
[1:33:07] in one context it the scriptural
[1:33:12] but they want
[1:33:13] in a scriptural context
[1:33:17] they're looking at their own life
[1:33:19] they're looking at the lives of those
[1:33:21] around them
[1:33:22] and they're seeing
[1:33:24] the cooling down
[1:33:26] they're seeing the falling away
[1:33:29] and my brother and sister I really
[1:33:31] didn't make much comment to this
[1:33:32] individual because I I didn't want to
[1:33:34] hurt any feelings and I just was a
[1:33:36] little stunned amen but you know what
[1:33:39] comes to me is what does the word say
[1:33:41] let that become something can we can we
[1:33:44] do that in our life can we just start
[1:33:46] making sure that we when we are angry or
[1:33:49] we disagree or I don't see it that way
[1:33:51] that we go to the word and let the word
[1:33:53] speak first and then if we feel like
[1:33:56] it's wrong come civilly and say I
[1:33:58] disagree with you and this is why but
[1:34:01] see people don't even go to the word
[1:34:03] they just don't like it
[1:34:06] I don't like that
[1:34:11] Philippians 1 6.
[1:34:13] being confident
[1:34:15] of this very thing
[1:34:18] do we have any confidence today
[1:34:20] be confident this very thing that he
[1:34:23] which hath begun a good work in you will
[1:34:27] perform it when till next week until you
[1:34:31] get too tired to press on until the
[1:34:33] devil gets too strong no sir until the
[1:34:36] day of Jesus Christ
[1:34:39] my brother and sister I'm not worried
[1:34:41] about what's going on out here the
[1:34:43] world's getting Wicked and people are
[1:34:45] getting worldly but that's not my story
[1:34:48] my story is gonna be Lord I'm gonna be
[1:34:52] here and I'm gonna serve you by your
[1:34:55] grace and mercy I'm going to press into
[1:34:57] this battle
[1:34:59] Lord I might not be able to do it myself
[1:35:01] but you promised that you and me I can
[1:35:04] do it and I believe this now my brother
[1:35:07] and sister I'm going to go into a little
[1:35:09] different avenue here but if we my
[1:35:12] brother and sister don't believe what
[1:35:13] God Said
[1:35:15] it can only be because we didn't trust
[1:35:19] him
[1:35:19] because you have to trust him
[1:35:22] to believe him
[1:35:25] I'm reminded the little story where the
[1:35:27] dad tells his son they're out mowing the
[1:35:30] lawn and he's going along there and he
[1:35:32] tells his son he says you know when we
[1:35:34] get all done with his son I'll buy you
[1:35:35] an ice cream
[1:35:37] it takes a little longer you know big
[1:35:39] yard trim and everything and
[1:35:42] they've eaten supper and
[1:35:44] the dad appears in his
[1:35:46] sweats or gemmas or whatever you want to
[1:35:49] call them and his son comes over to him
[1:35:50] goes dad
[1:35:52] I need to talk to you and he says what
[1:35:54] is it son
[1:35:56] the promise
[1:35:59] dad being I think a real honest dad
[1:36:03] he wasn't lying to his son
[1:36:06] but what happened he's tired
[1:36:08] it's like promise
[1:36:10] yeah Dad ah
[1:36:12] son
[1:36:13] when we're done with this
[1:36:15] we'll go get ice cream
[1:36:20] and the dad gets up out of his chair
[1:36:22] gets dressed
[1:36:24] puts his son in the pickup
[1:36:27] drives into town
[1:36:28] buys him an ice cream because he had a
[1:36:31] revelation
[1:36:32] if he can't trust me now he won't trust
[1:36:36] me later

[1:37:39] God he's changing time amen the very
[1:37:42] measure of time he's changing for your
[1:37:45] sake
[1:37:47] Hallelujah
[1:37:48] Hallelujah sorry I'm preaching so
[1:37:50] vigorous and so long here but I tell you
[1:37:52] I stored it up all week

[1:37:56] doesn't just leave you sitting around
[1:37:58] amen now look at this for it says here
[1:38:01] in verse 28 for wheresoever the carcass
[1:38:04] says there will the Eagles be gathered
[1:38:06] together amen look this is the opening
[1:38:09] of the seals my brother and sister the
[1:38:11] revealing the putting on display to take
[1:38:13] you where the carcass is and people I've
[1:38:17] had this throat at me at before I'm
[1:38:19] sorry to say I had no answer for it they
[1:38:21] said are you trying to tell me that God
[1:38:24] there's more God here today than there
[1:38:26] was when my parents uh you know were
[1:38:29] that you know this person was older like
[1:38:31] probably
[1:38:32] 70ish I would say sorry brother David
[1:38:36] um
[1:38:37] so their parents were back aways right
[1:38:39] and they said you're saying we got more
[1:38:41] now this profit and whatever got more
[1:38:44] now than my parents had and I really
[1:38:46] didn't know how to answer that but I'm
[1:38:48] telling you my brother and sister I got
[1:38:50] a very simplistic answer for you now the
[1:38:52] seal is open it's off the book the page
[1:38:55] is revealed and only add another time in
[1:38:59] history has God given rapturing faith
[1:39:02] and now he's given it to a whole body
[1:39:05] it's not just an isolated case it's two
[1:39:08] in a whole body I say we got more now
[1:39:11] than they've ever had Through the Ages
[1:39:14] got more now of God Amen on display and
[1:39:18] reveal than has ever been placed on the
[1:39:21] Earth
[1:39:22] oh Hallelujah because now he's took a
[1:39:26] bride right into a Wilderness to the
[1:39:28] carcass and lets her feed freely on the
[1:39:31] carcass and rapturing Faith coming out
[1:39:33] of that word is coming and building up
[1:39:36] in her
[1:39:38] Hallelujah
[1:39:45] Christ himself
[1:39:47] said I want to be on display I think
[1:39:49] I'll come and walk in the streets of
[1:39:50] Nampa Meridian Boise
[1:39:53] Caldwell
[1:39:54] and I'm going to do it
[1:39:56] so openly
[1:39:58] they can't see me that's
[1:40:02] wow
[1:40:03] there it is
[1:40:08] oh my
[1:40:10] God
[1:40:12] look
[1:40:16] this is the fullness
[1:40:19] of the manifestation of rapturing faith
[1:40:22] the line upon line
[1:40:24] of constant building up
[1:40:27] amen now you young people you don't
[1:40:29] probably take vitamins
[1:40:31] but I've always been resistant to
[1:40:34] vitamins
[1:40:35] I don't like vitamins my wife
[1:40:37] has to always tell me did you take your
[1:40:39] vitamins
[1:40:41] and
[1:40:42] I open up my sacked lunch during the day
[1:40:44] and there's vitamins
[1:40:49] but you know when I take vitamins
[1:40:51] my body says
[1:40:53] good
[1:40:55] good
[1:40:57] I'm just wondering why can't I just take
[1:40:59] a giant syringe full of vitamin D
[1:41:04] and just get all the vitamin D I need
[1:41:08] because I can't handle it
[1:41:12] has nothing to do with the vitamin D
[1:41:15] it has to do with me that's right I'm
[1:41:18] God is giving us a little bit more every
[1:41:24] single let me open this seal for you
[1:41:29] let me let you see just who you are
[1:41:39] and I start to look at that and the
[1:41:42] little neurons in my brain starts
[1:41:44] popping and I come to the realization I
[1:41:47] have no clue who Christ is in me
[1:41:51] oh can you follow that no clue my
[1:41:54] brother and sister he in me is so much
[1:41:58] greater than I can even comprehend I
[1:42:02] look at this and see a feeble man and
[1:42:05] God looks and says I see myself and I'm
[1:42:08] still struggling with myself to see
[1:42:12] myself and God says look just look at a
[1:42:16] little glimpse of me right here in you a
[1:42:18] little glimpse of me right here in you
[1:42:20] now take another bite
[1:42:23] brother I'm talking about the apple tree
[1:42:25] he says that little tree don't need to
[1:42:27] do nothing but drink and push out drink
[1:42:30] and push out but if it isn't drinking
[1:42:34] if it isn't drinking it's not pushing
[1:42:37] Hallelujah
[1:42:41] for homework Proverbs 3 1-6 amen tells
[1:42:46] us Deltas take verse five and we'll move
[1:42:48] on trust in the Lord with all thy heart
[1:42:51] and lean not unto thy own understanding
[1:42:54] you see my brother and sister if we
[1:42:56] can't trust him we won't believe him
[1:42:58] that's it it's not cut and dried if we
[1:43:00] don't believe God's our healer and we
[1:43:03] don't trust him to heal us we'll never
[1:43:05] fully act upon that
[1:43:07] amen Deliverance got an issue in your
[1:43:10] life you need deliverance from if you
[1:43:12] don't actually believe God will can and
[1:43:14] will deliver you from that and trust him
[1:43:16] for that never happen that's
[1:43:20] it and I'll back that up with a quote
[1:43:21] right here
[1:43:23] right here Brothers if you put that up
[1:43:24] on the screen we'll we'll be done here
[1:43:27] it's only a lengthy quote shouldn't be
[1:43:29] more than 30 minutes
[1:43:36] okay now so you'll understand
[1:43:39] we're talking about this as I have heard
[1:43:41] but now I see 1965 11 27 65. my brother
[1:43:45] and sister this is at the end of brother
[1:43:46] Brown's Ministry
[1:43:48] brother Brian's laying foundational
[1:43:50] things for us to come and dig up now
[1:43:54] yeah
[1:43:54] to dig up now
[1:43:58] not to sit and wait for him to be
[1:43:59] delivered for us
[1:44:01] but Lord give me a spiritual pick and
[1:44:03] shovel
[1:44:04] to dig into the word and see what it is
[1:44:07] now look at this brother Brown was
[1:44:08] talking about these brothers
[1:44:10] that uh the the oil wells you guys know
[1:44:13] the story about the whole Wells
[1:44:15] so well they wouldn't listen to it then
[1:44:18] first before we left that night the
[1:44:20] place where we were having lunch the
[1:44:21] Holy Spirit showed me a great crack in
[1:44:24] the earth that and in that was full of
[1:44:26] oil and these overflows in kentuckies
[1:44:29] was just little beds of oil they were
[1:44:31] pumping from but this come from the
[1:44:33] mainstream and I said brother Demas it's
[1:44:36] there so they went searching for said go
[1:44:39] down and tell us where the oil well is I
[1:44:41] want you to catch this right here oh no
[1:44:44] no no no no we don't use the gift of God
[1:44:47] for commercial
[1:44:49] amen oh let me throw another deal we're
[1:44:52] not going to use the gift of God to
[1:44:54] build a big church we're not going to
[1:44:56] use the gift of God to have hundreds or
[1:44:59] thou members my brother and sister will
[1:45:01] use the gift of God to get a body that
[1:45:04] is on the carcass eating ready for the
[1:45:07] Rapture that's what the word is for get
[1:45:10] you and not ready for a rapture
[1:45:20] no no he he could tell me where it was
[1:45:24] at but I I don't have any need of it
[1:45:26] he's talking about the Lord he could
[1:45:28] tell me where it was at but I don't have
[1:45:29] any need of it I wouldn't even have
[1:45:31] faith enough to ask him
[1:45:33] this is a prophet of God
[1:45:35] I wouldn't even have enough Faith to ask
[1:45:38] him where's the oil he saw the vision of
[1:45:40] it though
[1:45:41] he had enough confidence in God
[1:45:43] revealing a vision to him to recognize
[1:45:45] there's a spot down there that has oil
[1:45:48] beyond measure
[1:45:49] the prophet of God wasn't doubting it
[1:45:53] but he says he didn't have enough Faith
[1:45:54] to ask for it
[1:45:57] see if I had need of it
[1:46:00] I believe if I'd ask him he'd tell me
[1:46:02] but first you see your motives and
[1:46:03] objective has to be right you have to
[1:46:06] have reasons for this God don't give you
[1:46:09] those things just because you ask and
[1:46:12] you cannot ask in faith unless there's a
[1:46:15] real objective to that to be in the will
[1:46:19] of God now I hope some of you don't
[1:46:21] stumble over this or maybe you've read a
[1:46:24] little bit ahead here naughty naughty
[1:46:26] amen
[1:46:29] see if you want to be well do you what
[1:46:31] do you want to be well for if you want
[1:46:33] to be healed what's the reason you want
[1:46:35] to be healed what are you telling God
[1:46:38] what do you want to do with your life
[1:46:41] when you get healed see there's got to
[1:46:44] be
[1:46:47] hmm
[1:46:49] you've got to have a motive and
[1:46:51] objective they have to be right
[1:46:52] according to the will of God and that's
[1:46:54] when the faith is revealed to you and by
[1:46:57] God his Sovereign Grace places that
[1:46:59] faith in there then it's over see now
[1:47:02] see amen now to make that word true when
[1:47:07] the Brethren got down there they got one
[1:47:09] fellow went over and bought a bunch of
[1:47:10] stuff so Lisa's cheated the other one
[1:47:12] this way and I said see it won't work
[1:47:14] now just to make the prophecy sure
[1:47:17] within a hundred yards of where these
[1:47:21] men were digging their will some man
[1:47:23] struck the big gusher and it's there
[1:47:25] 1100 barrels of oil in a half a day or
[1:47:28] something or other like that still
[1:47:30] putting it out right in the mainstream
[1:47:32] but just make the prophecy the word had
[1:47:35] been said it was there it was there the
[1:47:38] rest of them nearly is all dried out
[1:47:40] everywhere through Kentucky little ponds
[1:47:43] they pumped them a little while they go
[1:47:44] it's only the Overflow from this see but
[1:47:47] because of selfishness other God among
[1:47:50] it the objectives were wrong
[1:47:52] signing up a bunch of stuff it would be
[1:47:54] this way and when they promised they
[1:47:56] would do it for the kingdom
[1:47:58] of God
[1:48:00] now can I just draw this back
[1:48:04] Lord I want you to heal me
[1:48:07] so I can go work harder
[1:48:09] make more money
[1:48:12] do this do that
[1:48:19] but if you had a real need
[1:48:22] and you were going to do something for
[1:48:23] God
[1:48:25] the prophet's telling us
[1:48:28] God's Gonna recognize that
[1:48:33] right I won't even acknowledge that I
[1:48:34] have a problem that has to do with my
[1:48:36] blood and my sugar
[1:48:38] amen
[1:48:39] I asked the Lord to heal me
[1:48:41] but I'll tell you Saints
[1:48:44] between cauliflower beet juice
[1:48:48] you guys ever take beet juice
[1:48:50] amen I would rather eat dirt in a field
[1:48:53] than take breaches
[1:48:58] but I feel better
[1:49:00] I actually have half of mine now
[1:49:05] I want God to heal me
[1:49:07] why do I want God to heal me
[1:49:11] it's been my prayer
[1:49:14] Lord I want to preach this gospel to my
[1:49:17] dying breath that's right
[1:49:19] amen does that mean God's obligated to
[1:49:21] heal me
[1:49:22] no
[1:49:24] but I'll still claim it amen I still
[1:49:27] believe it
[1:49:28] amen
[1:49:30] Hallelujah I don't want it to be selfish
[1:49:33] see selfish and what's gone amongst it
[1:49:35] and the objectives were wrong they were
[1:49:37] doing all this stuff no selfish thing
[1:49:39] will work your motives and objectives
[1:49:41] has to be exactly perfectly right then
[1:49:43] you have faith to ask if your hearts
[1:49:45] condemn us not then we have confidence
[1:49:47] see we got to have confidence I want
[1:49:50] this to be honor and glory of God then
[1:49:53] faith has a channel to move into and if
[1:49:57] it doesn't then you've got mental
[1:49:59] intellectual faith not genuine faith
[1:50:01] amen my brother and sister Lord help us
[1:50:04] amen help us my brother and sister that
[1:50:07] we could come amen let's go to the next
[1:50:10] is that wasn't all of it was it yeah
[1:50:13] okay that intellectual faith will get
[1:50:15] you nowhere
[1:50:16] might get you emotional but it won't get
[1:50:19] you the healing you're looking for so
[1:50:21] job checking himself with the genuine
[1:50:23] faith that God had given to him that he
[1:50:26] was just see I love how God led the
[1:50:29] prophet to bring this through of these
[1:50:31] men whose motive and objective and they
[1:50:33] didn't get this now
[1:50:35] real cut and dried
[1:50:37] if they had actually believed what the
[1:50:40] prophet of God spoke to them
[1:50:42] and trusted him
[1:50:45] see there's a lot more to the story I I
[1:50:47] had to just grab that piece
[1:50:50] if they'd actually believed what the
[1:50:53] prophet spoke to them
[1:50:57] they'd have went
[1:50:58] and following the leadership of the Holy
[1:51:00] Ghost
[1:51:02] walked out there
[1:51:03] so to speak
[1:51:09] but intellectual Revelation right
[1:51:13] right of the will of God
[1:51:17] well I have no problem if God blesses
[1:51:19] brother Chris and brother David's
[1:51:21] Ministry I just want mine to be better
[1:51:26] really what's your motive yeah
[1:51:30] the word says one plants
[1:51:33] another Waters
[1:51:34] and another dose the Harvest
[1:51:37] reminds me of a man once he repented of
[1:51:40] these words
[1:51:41] but he said I was so just Minister said
[1:51:43] I was so disappointed
[1:51:45] my child went to Louisiana
[1:51:48] I've been working with my child for so
[1:51:51] long went to Louisiana to camp meeting
[1:51:53] got baptized down there as our own
[1:51:56] father or Minister I didn't even get a
[1:51:58] baptize my own daughter
[1:52:02] really
[1:52:07] you planted
[1:52:09] you cultivated you did all of this
[1:52:13] and in the moment the spirits struck
[1:52:16] she responds should have been on the
[1:52:19] other end hallelujah praise God praise
[1:52:22] God hallelujah It produced a seed
[1:52:27] we have wrong motives
[1:52:35] oh my
[1:52:37] God yeah
[1:52:39] I gotta hurry
[1:52:41] Sister Sarah you'll help come on
[1:52:44] hey man I'll start looking over there
[1:52:46] with you playing and I'll feel guilty
[1:52:48] and I'll stop
[1:52:50] what's the reason reason you want to be
[1:52:53] healed that's the reason you can't get
[1:52:54] Faith in a sea because you haven't made
[1:52:56] this thing to God sincerely from your
[1:52:57] heart like Hezekiah did God give God the
[1:53:02] reason he wanted his King said his
[1:53:04] kingdom in order and that's part of the
[1:53:06] reason I brought this quote or how it
[1:53:07] tied in you see my brother and sister in
[1:53:10] all the things that what Hezekiah faced
[1:53:13] all the king of Assyria and all these
[1:53:15] negative people and all these come give
[1:53:17] yourself to us we'll bless you do all of
[1:53:20] these things it all comes back and God
[1:53:22] honored and made this come to pass
[1:53:24] because Hezekiah himself a king who had
[1:53:27] lost his way
[1:53:29] had something in his heart a sword
[1:53:32] please
[1:53:33] I see my error
[1:53:35] I need to set my kingdom in order
[1:53:41] oh God help us
[1:53:43] I want to set my kingdom in order
[1:53:45] want everything in my life I want
[1:53:47] everything in my family I want to set it
[1:53:49] in order
[1:53:51] my brother and sister God's a gracious
[1:53:53] God
[1:53:55] don't look
[1:53:56] I preached to you on the measure of time
[1:53:58] the other day this in a way is an
[1:54:00] extension of that don't look at it I've
[1:54:01] got time
[1:54:03] look at your heart's desire it's your
[1:54:05] desire just to have Time and Time and
[1:54:07] Time and Time God give me way more time
[1:54:09] I do whatever I want at the last moment
[1:54:11] I'll get my life right know my brother
[1:54:13] and sister take the time God has given
[1:54:15] us
[1:54:16] and in this time
[1:54:18] let God do the work he desires let God
[1:54:21] move upon us and change our lives and
[1:54:24] change the situations around us amen but
[1:54:28] he tells him right there God sent his
[1:54:30] Prophet back and told him he'd be healed
[1:54:32] see but you have to have those things
[1:54:34] made right first so then as soon as you
[1:54:37] get those places and know it's been
[1:54:39] revealed to you by the word of God by
[1:54:41] Revelation by the word that God what God
[1:54:43] requires you to do then you have faith
[1:54:46] genuine Faith oh my brother and sister I
[1:54:50] don't know what's in your life I don't
[1:54:51] know why God lays things on our lives in
[1:54:53] this maybe he's just preaching to me and
[1:54:55] I tell you
[1:54:57] let's get our Kingdoms in order
[1:54:59] amen let's take this measure that God
[1:55:04] has given to us and apply it today don't
[1:55:08] leave the balm of Gilead on this shelf
[1:55:10] and say well someday take that balm and
[1:55:13] Rob yourself in that balm of Gilead and
[1:55:17] say Lord give me the grace and the
[1:55:19] courage to make Kingdom in order today
[1:55:23] oh sometimes it's facing hard things
[1:55:28] sometimes it's facing hard things
[1:55:31] my brother and sister I don't mean to
[1:55:33] put my own family in the spotlight but
[1:55:36] years ago a little bit of estranged
[1:55:38] things that attitude a spirit between me
[1:55:41] and my children
[1:55:42] and as the minister as a pastor and and
[1:55:46] things of life I was just like why can't
[1:55:48] my children just love me
[1:55:51] and I started praying and it's like Lord
[1:55:53] I've done my best why not Lord
[1:55:56] I'm not saying they didn't love me and I
[1:55:58] don't want to sound like that they were
[1:55:59] callous
[1:56:00] [Music]
[1:56:01] and the Lord revealed to me one day and
[1:56:03] said you
[1:56:05] need to go to them and ask forgiveness
[1:56:11] and you know I was like Lord what do I
[1:56:12] need to ask forgiveness for
[1:56:15] well I'll tell you what if you ask God a
[1:56:17] question like that
[1:56:19] you know it's all under the blood and I
[1:56:22] believe it's under the blood but but God
[1:56:24] has a book
[1:56:26] God's got a memory and he started just
[1:56:28] like there was this and there was this
[1:56:31] and there was this and there's this and
[1:56:32] this
[1:56:33] and by God's grace church I hope you
[1:56:37] catch what I'm saying
[1:56:38] it was so hard for me
[1:56:42] to approach my children individually
[1:56:46] say I've done you wrong
[1:56:48] forgive me
[1:56:51] it was so hard
[1:56:54] and when it was finished
[1:56:56] there was such Liberty
[1:57:00] you see God's Not Gonna God's Not Gonna
[1:57:03] just gloss over it and move on
[1:57:07] he wants you and I
[1:57:09] to take the prophet's words
[1:57:12] and press into this
[1:57:14] Hallelujah we love the Lord today
[1:57:17] I've kept you a little long
[1:57:20] amen
[1:57:21] Hallelujah
[1:57:26] you see Trust
[1:57:28] and faith
[1:57:30] are interconnected
[1:57:34] and I'll say this once again if they had
[1:57:36] believed the prophet
[1:57:38] if they had to rest trusted the prophet
[1:57:40] they would have believed the prophet
[1:57:43] amen I think it's the same today
[1:57:47] only there it's not really about
[1:57:50] brother William Branham
[1:57:53] these people don't actually believe God
[1:57:56] they don't trust God
[1:57:58] Lord help us to trust you

[2:09:24] assignment
[2:09:27] in a quiet time
[2:09:28] not when the family not in the kids
[2:09:30] tearing up the toys and the families all
[2:09:32] noise
[2:09:36] let's stop and ask the Lord from the
[2:09:39] depths of our heart
[2:09:41] Lord reveal to me what it is is
[2:09:43] hindering me
[2:09:45] it doesn't have to be sin
[2:09:48] it doesn't have to be something wrong in
[2:09:50] your life
[2:09:53] just a little something
[2:09:57] you know sometimes now I don't mean to
[2:10:00] go into a whole deal here
[2:10:02] sometimes a piece of Machinery won't
[2:10:04] work quite right
[2:10:05] [Music]
[2:10:07] just because a part of it has a little
[2:10:09] too much friction
[2:10:11] God wants Liberty in this church
[2:10:14] God wants Liberty in these lives
[2:10:17] would you do that with me
[2:10:19] would we just take time and say Lord
[2:10:21] whatever it is that's slowing me down
[2:10:24] hindering holding back a little complex
[2:10:27] a little something maybe reminds me I'm
[2:10:30] sorry to go into this but just shares
[2:10:32] reminds me of a situation that I was
[2:10:34] part of God using
[2:10:38] something a father
[2:10:39] [Music]
[2:10:44] said to a daughter
[2:10:47] when she was about 10 going on 11 years
[2:10:50] old
[2:10:52] and it cut that little girl so deep
[2:10:54] at 40 years old
[2:10:59] she said brother Paul this is in South
[2:11:02] America it's not here
[2:11:04] why can't I find joy in my selfish
[2:11:10] and God was kind enough
[2:11:13] in her prayer and her cry
[2:11:16] Lord why
[2:11:18] good
[2:11:20] her father was passed
[2:11:24] and she said Lord forgive me
[2:11:27] for I've held that against my father to
[2:11:29] say
[2:11:32] little girl
[2:11:34] you're so ugly I don't know if anyone
[2:11:37] will ever want to marry you
[2:11:41] maybe the dad was in humor
[2:11:43] but it cut to the heart of this child
[2:11:48] and laughter is something missing and
[2:11:53] there she was a wife and a mother
[2:11:56] and Satan's still binding that to her
[2:11:59] spirit
[2:12:03] don't have to dig you don't have to get
[2:12:05] a jackhammer and pound on yourself to
[2:12:07] find the sound
[2:12:08] just a simple Lord
[2:12:12] what's hindering
[2:12:15] what's Hendrick
