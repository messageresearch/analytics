it is our Lord Jesus Christ amen everything else will fail around us but he can never fail amen amen uh just uh you know I keep going I always put brother Dace down to pray for him and the situations but we also want to remember his family amen his mother his wife and daughter and uh just lift them up before the Lord also amen I bring you greetings tonight from brother Dwayne and sister Connie fa uh they are pressing the battle and uh just uh you know through the the good times the bad times all of these times just preaching the gospel Desiring just to lead the body of Believers there and uh draw them close to the Lord amen and we just thank the Lord for that um brother Andrew Boy Scout shared today that um they had a a relative there that young man that took his life and uh we just want to um remember them in prayer just lift them up uh the heartache that would be for the family uh must be tremendous and uh so let's just remember Brother David do you remember that young man's name no I don't yes yes a cousin so so anyway I I've I've forgotten the name I feel bad for that but just remember that family you know the Lord um just works in unique ways and sometimes it takes things like that to get attention let's turn in our Bibles this evening God bless you thank you all beautiful music song service and uh this special my uh I'm feeling a strong urge to throw sister Donna under a bus but um anyway it was thank you that was wonderful and you know the the song is just uh Lively and it really just in I don't know that it's there's a little bit of child let me put it this way there's a little bit of child in every one of us and and You Know It just strikes a a chord in the heart of a child you know that song you got to sing it with exuberance and uh that's wonderful and I say thank you very very much um blesses my heart amen I want to speak to you this evening uh on just a simple title of my mountain and so as we'll look at this we'll see uh just I want to make several uh connections through the scripture concerning the mountain when you look at the topic itself it's an incredibly large topic to to uh tie in all the aspects of of uh how God works and where he chooses to to meet amen he'll meet us anywhere but you know you can look through the scripture and you would almost be able to say in a sense that God's chosen place of meeting is a mountain amen now we're not a Doctrine but it it It just fits very much turn in your bibles if you would we'll start off with Psalm 30: 1-2 which is what was part of uh the original connection of this thought uh was David here in the 30th chapter and uh starting with verse one I will extol thee Oh Lord for thou Hast Lifted Me Up Can someone say amen and Hast not made my foes to Rejoice over me oh Lord my God I Cried unto thee and thou Hast healed me now my brother and sister this word healed doesn't just cover a physical Affliction that's right amen I'll tell you what my brother and sister as we see with the 10 lepers I want the Lord to make us completely whole amen not just asking for something in the Physical Realm but heal us Lord amen amen oh Lord thou Hast brought up my soul from the grave and thou Hast kept me alive that I should not go down to the pit sing unto the Lord oh ye Saints of his and give thanks at the remembrance of his Holiness for his anger endureth but a moment in his favor is lying weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning I say Amen thank you Lord and in my Prosperity I said I shall never be moved now here again I don't want to get distracted tonight but Prosperity is a multifaceted word also because we can be poor in the things of this world and be the most prosperous and blessed people on the face of the Earth amen you know wealth good times are no sign of God's favor his keeping power the word is a sign of his favor amen we thank you Lord for that in my Prosperity I said I shall never be moved Lord by thy favor thou Hast made my Mountain to stand strong thou didst hide thy face and I was troubled I cried to thee Oh Lord Lord and unto the Lord I made supplication which is a form of prayer what profit is there in my blood when I go down to the pit shall the dust praise thee shall it declare thy truth meaning this is what we're here for amen are you with me Saints that's right amen we're here amen not that the Rocks would cry out not that the dust would praise him that that's what we're called to do amen [Music] hallelujah here oh Lord and have mercy upon me be thou my helper thou Hast turned uh for me my mourning into dancing thou Hast put off my sackcloth and gted me with gladness to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not be silent oh Lord my God I will give thanks unto thee forever amen amen we're going to take the word forever as it is here again various definitions of that for eternity we're going to be giving praise to the King of Kings for eternity does that make you happy it really stir my heart today amen Heavenly Father we just ask you Lord come be with us tonight speak to our hearts those who are unable to be here father thinking Lord of those that are sick not feeling well Lord we would just ask you to come touch them in body Lord for I know their desires was to be in the house of God tonight so we ask you give strength to them in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Saints amen as I read these verses it resonates with me because you see where our strength comes from when we look at that where does our strength come from the word is very clear that our strength comes from the Lord it is not you know uh uh definitely no uh uh point to those who exer size are physically fit uh but the natural strength you just uh let that wne for a little bit and and we just seem to go right back where we were and it is the same in our spiritual walk if we do not continue as brother brandham spoke about flexing those Faith muscles if we do not Flex those Faith muscles they will wither and so it is by God's grace that we uh this is a hard one sometimes uh to to really kind of wrap our thoughts around but that's why God allows these things little things to come in our lives amen that we would be continually flexing our faith muscle in other words if we could say Okay praise God I am in Rapture condition and I don't need to do anything until he comes we would find ourselves very weak but by these trials of the day amen the trials that seem to just appear from nowhere uh that we continually Flex our faith muscle and that gives us strength to stand in the uh the trials of the day amen so every good gift we know comes from the Lord and our strength comes from him amen and uh you know we can be void of a natural understanding now uh let me flesh this thought out we can be void of a natural understanding and oftentimes my brother and sister what I'm thinking or trying to say is that we have decisions to make and we don't know what decision to make we don't know where to go to go right or to go left and so we are void of natural understanding of a circumstance we know that we must deal with we must have an answer for and it is there that God has come when we are often times void of an answer God comes and he has the answer for us you might find it in scripture you might find it in the prophet in the message you might find it just in your prayer time but you see God knows and he has the answer for us even when we don't have an answer so we're LED of the lord we could call that revelation we could call that revelation we can say you know what scripturally here in a spiritual realm you know Revelation comes but Revelation comes over in simple things my brother and sister where God comes to deal with us and you know it is uh when we would come into places to apply Revelation into natural everyday life uh we could be in a position that we make a decision and it's not till later we realize how anointed by the influence of the Holy Spirit to make that decision when we come and find ourselves in the quandry we don't know right or left but when the Holy Spirit comes down and moves upon us to move in a certain direction to give an answer of yes or no or forward or or stop or whatever it might be and we realize then it was actually the Holy Spirit coming right down maybe in the car maybe in the house maybe in the Council of Brothers whatever it is and the Holy Spirit comes and we don't even recognize that he's moving us in a certain direction but he said I will lead you amen we just need to come into every situation and say you know what he said in this situation he maybe didn't name it specifically but he said he would lead us and guide us and Truth my brother and sister is sometimes revealed in just the correct answer the correct decision truth being revealed and so we are under the influence of the Holy Spirit each and every day should be all day of every day amen and that we would be under that leadership of the Holy Spirit and uh we just sometimes need to just let go and say Lord just just influence my decision I just need you to I just need you to to show me you see sometimes God does not answer in direct answers sometimes he takes us to a scripture sometimes he takes us to a time of prayer sometimes he simply gives us that gentle loving nudge to cause us to go in a certain way now in verse seven as it is we'll look at this uh and look how it is spoken Lord by thy favor thou Hast made my Mountain to stand strong you know sometimes as Satan would come in try to Buffet us to change our mind to change a decision but you know our Mountain can stand strong in this day amen thou didst hide thy face see whenever God is absent from us whether we haven't been in the right atmosphere we're not responding correctly uh we as sons and daughters of God we sense that also we know when when that leadership that presence is not with us and it should trouble us if we're walking without the leadership of the Holy Spirit and it doesn't trouble us my brother and sister we need to stop and rethink our position can someone say Amen to that amen and so I want to jump tonight into the book of Hebrews the 11th chapter just finding in my studies quite a few connections back and forth and Hebrews 11 and33 is talking about the Believers the Overcomers the Saints who through faith subdued kingdoms rot righteousness obtained promises now my brother and sister every word in this scripture that pertains to the bride of Christ is a promise to you we should look to obtain those promises if it says we're healed we need to pray and approach god with confidence have our position marked that he is my healer if we need direction wisdom knowledge Revelation he you know all of these things we need to claim that you got to step into the scripture take a hold to that promise because you see my brother and sister God never failed from a promise he made us but many times we see those promises not being fulfilled and it is because we have to take a hold of the promise because we're a part of the promise amen so God doesn't say well they've got no faith I guess I'll just discount that and go on and do it no God will bring you and I to a place that our faith is built up but if you want a prayer answered start with the basics amen my brother and sister we don't have to have a complicated now Lord I need to be able to explain all of this and that and you know I remember one time a person asking individual asking for Revelation to understand the tent Vision but their life was in chaos so don't go trying to understand tent Vision to be able to explain it start with the basics Lord let me help put my house in order Lord help me be a person that would read my Bible and pray let me love my brothers and sisters and lift them up start with Basics because you see if we don't have basics in place God's not going to teach us algebra amen so as you look at this so it's here that that it stopped the mouth of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword and out of weakness were made strong waxed violent uh VI violent waxed violent in fight Valiant in fight and turned to flight the army of the aliens so it was in this position of weakness that God chose to record this in Hebrews 11 telling you this is part of the recipe that made these saints that are listed in this scripture made them who they were is because in their weakness God was able to be made strong amen not one of those in Hebrews 11 come forth as a great Giant in the sense that we think of giants they came forth they were living their life every single day they got up in the morning they went to work you might say Amen they dealt with issues in the family they dealt with finances they dealt with health they dealt with in-laws they dealt with everything just like we did amen but in their weakness because it was submitted to God they found strength amen now as I said this might be a fairly short service today I shouldn't say things like that Amen brother Ivan told me the other day about I don't remember how he worded that but if if you say it or something it doesn't happen so this is going to be a really long service amen but uh I I just want to tie these ends uh concerning a mountain together here now let's look here in Genesis 19 uh it is there that we'll see this story of Sodom we'll see that here is lot and his family uh we have Angels dealing with them and it is there that we'll look at the scripture really careful uh to just catch this uh We've preached it before it might be you know uh old news but amen and while he lingered talking about lot while he lingered the men laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the Lord being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him without the city now this might here right here might be classified as a miracle here here is a Angels this is a a god coming down and moving where they could not move themselves have you ever been in that position where you knew you needed to go you knew what you needed to do but you couldn't find self doing that it was something that was an unction that was lacking and God comes and moves us and then afterwards we realize exactly what happened God was gracious to us amen and so uh the being merciful unto him they brought him forth set him without the city and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that he said Escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain Escape in my own notes I I capitalized this I made this bold escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed so the Refuge here is being given to lot that your Refuge is the mountain now I want to preface this beforehand just studying recently we won't go into all the quotes tonight but the the prophet of God uh putting forth this that the reason that people struggle and don't receive the blessing or answer to prayer that they should is because they are afraid of the presence of the Holy Spirit they find themselves checked they they find themselves pulling back brother brandham speaking quite harshly to brandom Tabernacle that they had pulled back from the moving of the Holy Spirit now that's pretty strong words my brother and sister to speak that out but sometimes strong words are necessary so it tells them here Escape for your life for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain so he makes clear the statement that you stay away neither stay thou in all the plane very clear amen no reason to stumble over those words words just like many words my brother and sister if we're not careful we stumble over when the word itself has showed us clearly how to not stumble at those words amen very very difficult uh quite a few examples I could go in but I'm a little afraid of getting sidetracked tonight and so it's there he tells them now uh neither stay thee in all the plain escape to the mountain very clear words if you're in the plain and not the mountain you're going to be consumed I think it'd be safe to say if we would be a little bit of Liberty if you don't stay in this you're going to be consumed you know God's warning to us take the book eat it amen amen also tells us we must live by every word so if we're living on less than every word we're not on the mountain right we're in the plane and so you can go on and I hope that you follow my thought there you see God's very specific God didn't say come as you are and leave as you are God didn't say you know on your way through to do this or do that you know stop and worship me for a minute very specific amen and lot said to him now see this is where trouble starts right here in verse 18 and lot says unto them oh not so my Lord you see what you preached on marriage and divorce what you preached on the opening of the seals what you preached on baptism what you preached not so there might be more Lots in the land than we give credit for they're talking to God's servants which is God's voice yeah and telling them not so oh Lord don't let us ever come to that position never never Lord no matter how much grief it would bring in our spirit or physically in that element don't say no to God he knows what's best for us and he wants what's best for us oh not so my Lord behold now thy servant hath found Grace in thy sight now I want you you I want to this what I really want to kind of ponder today what what tonight what what it is see is is the Angels amen God draws him out of Sodom draws him out of this wicked place and now lot is telling the Lord how he wants to receive the Holy Ghost how he wants all of these Revelations what I'd really like is for for you Lord to let me be a Christian on my terms in my thoughts my understanding let me let me serve you in the way I think it would be best for me to serve you do any of you trust yourself to make a statement like that I I don't even trust myself to make a statement like that because my thinking is flawed anden that's scary you guys will be voting on a new pastor our Pastor said his thinking is flawed well you're humans also and our thinking is flawed amen and so and we come to the point we start telling God how we want to serve him and what we find to be an acceptable thing and the direction that we want to go so this is how Lord you need to do it for me now they can all follow and be lined up with the word but I need a special exemption I don't ever want to be foolish enough I don't even want to use the word bravery there it just simply falls into foolishness to talk to God like that Lord let me be changed to match this word that's what matters there's there's the whole answer for us to start in the beginning what it would be when God was dealing with lot if what lot would have just said yes Lord less words than he gives to him if he would have just said yes Lord yay and amen to the word and lot would have just allowed the Holy Spirit to lead you know what would have happened the Mountain's hard can someone say Amen to that it's not easy to get to the top of the mountain whether you're just enjoying a hike you're hunting or whatever you might do in the natural and this mountain my brother and sister it would have been hard to got to the top but that wasn't really what bothered lot because lot knew the fire was on the mountain and he did not want to to go face that and he actually speaks L some evil now it comes in the scripture and says when we would say that good is evil and evil is good take this back that lot actually was afraid to go to the mountain L something would befall him now I want to say to you and say to myself if God has called you there God ask you to go to the mountain would God not make your way on the mountain safe and secure and blessed for us to walk in the path that he has called for us amen but if we interject any other thoughts any other ideas any other perceived things go study the message you'll find brother brandom laying it to brandham Tabernacle how that they have pulled back from the presence of God he doesn't spare anything he lays it right to them because you see Satan wants us to be afraid to face the word but we want to face the word we should we long to face the word because there's our Redemption my brother and sister there there is our judgment you know what we we would look and and This Ti into a lot of other things so let me be brief but you look at this my brother and sister and it's really hard when you have a carnal thought to calling judgment upon yourself right would you want to call judgment on yourself people would say no but the truth of it is communion being one example we are calling judgment on ourselves saying Lord I want to judge myself lest I would be judged less I would be found wanting I'd rather face it tonight my brother and sister than in his presence I would rather face it that there's shortcomings in my life today than I would to stand in his presence and and find myself short of that and so you look at this and and he says you know Behold thy servant found Grace in thy sight and thou Hast magnified thy mercy which thou Hast showed unto me by Saving in saving my life and I cannot escape to the mountain I cannot the very place he should have run the very Avenue I find it profound myself because God had given him Grace and given him Mercy that he recognized he felt there was his license to say I have a better plan Lord that's not what God intended God intended for him amen I'm glad of Grace I I need it I need Grace every single day day of my life I need it in abundance I'm glad that his grace is inexhaustible and it's sufficient because otherwise we'd be done and just the heartbeat but it doesn't Grace does not give us license to say no to the word I had a brother asked me one time he said brother Paul can you describe Grace to me and I said brother I'm not sure this is a good answer but this is how I see grace that when I have done all that I can do my very best ability and have still failed Grace is what catches me when I'm falling it's not when I don't do anything Grace is not there for us that're too lazy uh resistant to doing the right thing that's not what Grace is for amen that's when God will take as it were uh spare the r spoil the child amen spare the word spoil the saint amen so the word's got to come for you and I and it will come I say that positively it will come to put us in our correct position but just as it would be the rod it's not going to feel good so it's better to say Lord I need Grace but I'm going to do what you asked me I'm going to walk in the word I'm going to walk in the light you know what that path up the mountain must have been like all of us have hiked it's never a straight road the hike up the mountain in the presence of the Fire on the Mountain leads us here leads us there through some brush through the water up the Steep Parts the parts where we're on our hands and knees but ever moving to the fire ever moving to the presence of the Holy Spirit if it was easy everyone would do it I want to applaud you for your tenacity but mostly say thank you Lord for your grace that you have put in us an attraction to the fire amen so it's there he says you've magnified your mercy you've showed me uh uh unto me saving my life and I cannot escape to the mountain l e some evil uh take me and I I die he had quite a revelation didn't you of what God was doing God's just said you go to the mountain that's where I'll save you and he's saying if I go to the mountain I'll die now let's turn this spiritual if we could for a minute Lord I want to go to the mountain and I want to die I want to die Lord because when when I come in presence of that fire amen it's a purifying fire refining fire I want to be dead when I come in the presence of that fire Hallelujah that's right amen his mercies are new every morning but so is our determination to be humans is refreshed every morning amen personality is refreshed every morning attitude refreshed every morning everything that we would describe in the human element is also refreshed every morning and it has to die to come in the presence of that fire and so he comes he says now Lord verse 20 I've got a I've got an alternative you know the prophet when he preached the message he preached it too hard he hates women sisters do you feel hated there's no no yes answers please no you see the reason they rebelled against that is they chose the alternative not the word and they said you're judging me well if you had judged yourself you wouldn't even feel like you were being judged so without a judgment imagine if I had a whiteboard here we would be drawing this simple thing here's here's Sodom here's the trail and here's the why you know when I was a kid my mother said I drove her nuts because everything we did I said why why why any of you have children like that why oh we have grandchildren like that yes and they're not here to defend themselves but but you see every path has a why why did he not go to the mountain that's what God told him to do why did he come with an alternative of let me go to a city in the valley because if I can say this kind but straight everything he was used to the atmosphere of Sodom was not to be be found on the mountain that's right it was to be found in the city every atmosphere whether we're message claim the message or whether we're just denominationally minded amen we will be drawn to the atmosphere that makes us comfortable Lord May the fire come Amen Let us be comfortable in the presence of the Holy Spirit be comfortable in God's word coming down and touching right down where we live let us be comfortable when he takes a hold of us and draws us out of sin and draws us out of the state of unbelief and draws us into his presence and then says look I need you to go to the mountain let us be comfortable this is what you want for me Lord this is what I will do he said look now there's a city and I hope you don't mind me putting just a slight bit of a a a leaning to this behold now this city is near to flee unto and it's a little sin it's just a little place of unbelief now I'm not judging no one no one misunderstand this I think we're probably all been guilty at some point it's a really good movie it only has a little bit of cursing it's a good movie but it only has a little bit of nudity it's only a small City let me let me be a Christian over here Lord let me be a Christian in in just these small things we can ignore them my brother and sister you can't go to Costco Walmart or anything anymore amen we might be living on the outskirts of Sodom it it's terrible it's terrible amen so you know he says let me go it's a little one let me escape thither is it not a little one and my soul shall live he had a different view of what living than God did he had a different view of what life and Liberty was compared to what God had God said you're going to find life on the mountain lot says look if I can just go over to the city this is where I'll find life and I hope I hope I'm making sense tonight amen so lot was being offered a way of Escape but he literally said I'm afraid of your plan for my life I'm literally afraid Lord that you might turn me in into an extreme Christian but God said get out of the plane go to the mountain wasn't that pretty clear in scripture yeah get out of the plane but I want to not only go to the plane I want to go to a city in the plane so he called it God's grace to be able to go his own Direction I I I want to just maybe drive this home again thank you Lord for your grace it is sufficient amen but Lord never let my thinking come to the place that I think your grace will let me do whatever my flesh wants to do calling God's Grace to do his own thing now let's look where his plan got him and we won't get into all the details here but um the city however small was the wrong place to willingly Embrace those things that would breed unbelief into our life it's a wrong place right I don't care how big the church is I don't care how prosperous the city is I don't care about any of these things if it brings unbelief in our life we made the wrong decision at the why if God be gracious enough we can go back to the why and go but look what happened he goes down to the city and I like I said I don't really want to uh dwell on this we know what happened he got down in the city realized that he was out of God's will makes a decision and he finally goes to the mountain but he only goes halfway up the mountain this might sound a little harsh and I don't mean it that way but my brother and sister being a halfway message believer is going to leave us in a cave with all kinds of chaos and that chaos will come back to haunt us down the road you look at that realize for for the sake of the service young people Etc we won't really go into that uh but um so it goes back to the mountain but he's only got a halfway experience never made it up to the fire he only made it to a cave part way up the mountain and in his mind called this God's mercy and Grace I'm not a real believer but I don't drink and smoke and dance anymore that's only halfway there I don't know if it'd really be half but you follow me so so we see what happened here with lot uh when he had a misconception of the placing of the mountain in his life now I think we all would relate to this that that we talk about things good and bad blessings and whatever you know we're in a mountain praise the Lord I was on top of the mountain praising God and now I don't know what happened in a few weeks I'm down in a valley and let's just take that and bring that thought or that that idea back over into this my brother and sister spiritually you and I were called to live on the mountain but God said I've got a mold character in you so I'm going to take you down in a valley every once in a while and in that Valley you're going to come and I don't know you know it isn't like you just walk down the valley take care of business and just somehow end up back on the mountain my brother and sister easy to get in the valley hard to get on the mountain but God said I'm going to mold your character part of it is and I'll say this just for myself so it won't be out of line you know sometimes we let ourselves just coast and when you Coast you go down and you come to a place and you wake up one day and realize I don't want to be here this is not where I belong it's hot down here it's dirty it's dusty I hope you can spiritually apply those it's not where I belong I want to go back to the mountains is there anyone here that doesn't like the mountains no there's something inherent in us that wants to be on the mountain amen I think the scripture even talks about living in a valley the prophet talks about living in a valley and eating eggs I live in a valley and I love eggs what am I going to do I'm going to take the spiritual application the prophet was talking about but you see my brother and sister how we can so easily get in the valley but it's work to get on the mountain and stay on the mountain now imagine where now we know God's word's got to be fulfilled but imagine where things would be if lot had went to the mountain if lot had spoke to his wife spoke to his daughters and said we need to obey the Angels they're from God and they would have said we know they're from God but we must obey some people think that teaching our children or or teaching uh the the strength of the word is some form of abuse I tell you what abuse is and pardon me dear sisters abuse is when we let our daughters go out there and be ravaged by Satan abuse is when we turn our sons over and let the world out there amen sometimes the the daughters are the ravaging amen and some sons are there just being ravaged by the devil my brother and sister that's abuse amen teaching the truth laying the word out doing our V to align it and put it in the proper concept is not abuse but the world has now said it's abuse and back I believe the state of Pennsylvania uh said forcing your kid to go to to church is child abuse I'm not sure I got that state right but back and and it's like child abuse okay I mean the same as um church kids which one or church see how twisted the world is this a concept that we see was manifested all the way back with lot Moab my brother and sister was a basis I hope you follow me was a basis or Foundation of a form of child child abuse even when it turned out the daughters were the abusers but because the daughters didn't know the word of God didn't know the presence of God didn't know the atmosphere it was all void from them I believe they were raised in church religious but the abuse took place when they weren't brought in the presence of God right when the daughters wouldn't have looked on the mountain and said Daddy I recognize that that's the Holy Spirit when they become afraid of it when they become afraid of the moving of the holy spirit in our midst rather would like a lullabi a pat on the back a star a prize a field trip and none of those are wrong but it is if they don't recognize the fire if they can't see the fire parents were guilty of abuse that could sure be misconstrued couldn't it my oh my now I want to hurry up and kind of close up here Joshua 14 6-13 now here we are starting this you know the story they've come they're all there in place and they come unto Joshua gilgal and Caleb the son uh is there and um he says you know remember this thing that the Lord spoke to me I had a promise do we have a promise amen we need to remember the promise my brother and sister this is part of coming into the presence of God reminds us of our promise and and and you know I I really I really like Caleb I'm looking forward to the day I meet him you know because he says I was 40 years old when I was with Moses and I went and spied out the land and I saw that it was flowing with milk and honey and I saw it was everything that the word had promised everything God had promised I saw that that was true and you know he's a little rough we wouldn't like it today many many churches wouldn't like it if they had a Caleb standing in their midst and and basically telling them your hearts melted but I was there in the presence of God and saw it was the truth and your hearts have melted people be don't judge me don't judge us don't judge us we're Christians we go to church we know Jesus Christ is real that makes us Christians you want to check it out just go around and ask people their definition of being a Christian they believe Jesus is real no relationship no life just real so you know he says I wholly followed the Lord that's verse eight the Lord my God and in that time Moses tells him verse 9 uh surely the land which thy feet have trotten shall be thine inheritance amen and thine children forever because thou Hast holy followed the Lord my God what a difference my brother and sister from lot amen here's a promise that the land you have walked on and claimed as a a a Son of God as a husband as a father the land you've walked on will be a promise unto your children was there anything like that with lot He Walked on a lot of land but he never walked on it correctly and so now here's the promise that is given to him and he's standing there coming back speaking it to man and to God and to saying you promise everything I walked on the prophet of God comes and reiterates to us lays it out to you footsteps our possession oh Lord help us to walk on the word Walk In The Word and let that be our possession so that the promise to our children is released and when that's released amen it's no longer Mom and Dad causing the children to come to church a man causing his wife or a wife causing the husband it's no longer that that it's taking place in that realm it is a burning desire in their own life in their own soul I I have a promise and I'm going to see that promise come to pass I want to see it in my mama I want to see it in my daddy I want to see it in my brother I want to see it in my sister I want to see it in myself because this is my promise and so this is where we see now that Caleb is moving forward I want to just move through this here and uh it comes to a place my brother and sister and he says you know what I'm coming and this is the word verse 10 you know he says this and behold the Lord hath kept me alive see parallels with lot lot's talking about the Lord giving Mercy to him to keep him alive but look what it produced but here's Caleb with a real revelation of the word for his hour standing there and saying you know what he's what's kept me alive thank you Lord now I'm not looking for Mercy I'm not looking for Grace to go live this message the way I want to live it I am going to stay and with this word you promised us what's he doing he's calling God you might say in a sense if I have the right words to an account you promised I believe the promise I've applied the promise and now I want to see the manifestation of This Promise amen we actually don't know where he's standing at this point so many feet above sea level was it flat was it in a valley was it on a plateau we don't know these things but you'll find here that it's kind of given in the word and especially when you go to Israel this becomes very real to you because of where it is at what the promise is and where it's placed it starts to speak to your heart and you realize praise God Amen now I want to be Saints I want to be verse 11 I want that to be my testimony I want it to be your testimony I want you to be able to stand up with a boldness amen we you know the problem we have is people often times are just bold about the wrong reasons amen just I I don't watch it I don't know much about it I used to follow when I was young but you know I just know for this is how the world Works people are bold enough there's snowflakes falling I think this was a historical Green Bay Packers picture snowflakes are falling and there's snow collecting on the football field and some guy's got his shirt off and he's painted himself in a giant Green Bay Packers emblem on his body and his body is blue and he's shaking CU it's so cold but he's into this I'm not poking anybody don't misunderstand me the prophet of God said their amen sound like a sick sheep should I dismiss now because you're quiet doesn't mean you're a sick sheep it's a lack of sincerity it's what makes it sound like a sick Sheep amen it could be true might not be I'm not sure I don't remember ever reading that in the message I know a brother's this bold he did this I'm not this bold a brother said well You Preach Today on this I don't believe I ever read that in the message and the brother looked him in the face and says I doubt you ever even read the message ouch I think he was correct though one the man never tested it verse 11 as yet I am as strong this day as I was yesterday amen if you don't mind me putting that that way I I'm just as strong in the word today as I was yesterday I'm not slowly declining from spiritual starvation I'm in the word I'm eating I'm just as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in amen I want to be that kind of man I want to be that kind of believer to be able to stand up not with a boasting Spirit be able to say you know what in all the ups and downs of life I'm standing right here in 2024 and when God give me the Holy Spirit I'm just as strong right now as I was then amen and I am ready for war Satan I don't like it when I have to fight you but I'm prepared I've got the word I've put on all the breastplate and all of those things and I'm standing here prepared to do battle you can't have my wife you can't have my husband you can't have my children you can't have my parents amen I I I just would share this some of you have seen it many of you wouldn't have but I got a lovely testimony out of Belgium amen some young girls probably would shock most of us to see how they appeared when they came to to the conference but they were very little when their parents left the message and something in them on their own unction now had relatives they had relatives that were still around the message on their own unction we want to go to this conference they come a little shocking maybe to look at at first but I tell you what they already have put their word in I want to be baptized these two sisters and almost sounds like Rebellion they're forcing their parents to take them to church come on don't tell me this word isn't alive and well in this day don't tell me the promise is not there for the believer to take a hold self young or old to take a hold of and say I'm just as strong now as I was then amen I believe that'll be these young ladies testimony in the future I'm just as strong as when God spoke to me at this certain time and place and I'm going to stand that strong and I want my parents to stand that strong sir and I thought I was going to be short service just as strong as the day that Moses as my strength was and even my strength is now amen verse 12 I spoke all these words all these contract to bring it down to a place my brother and sister David said the Lord made his Mountain strong sturdy unmovable man after God's Own Heart but we have a contrast in there prophet of God said that lot was a righteous man and you look in the scripture and you'll see that Samson appears in Hebrews 11 I wouldn't choose Samson to be a peer for our young people but in the end he conquered more than he had in all the rest of his life God's ways are higher than our ways amen amen we would just read the scripture and think man Samson was a wreck and I guess that was the end of it but no God knew God had a plan but now look at this we're coming back around and looking at a Caleb amen where did Caleb travel through the Wilderness of sin 2024 what are you traveling through a Wilderness of sin and Caleb come out of that and all of the things that Caleb stood you know Caleb went and helped every brother every family get established didn't even have his own promise in his hand as it were but he's out establishing establishing establishing establishing let me help your family help me help you brother let me help you sister Widow whatever it might be let me help you young people and finally comes to a day and every everything's coming together and he says you know what if then I I like this right in here you know I'm as strong this day as I was and that day Moses sent me and my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain because here's where the promise is give it to me did it change anything my brother and sister nope wherever the Lord spoke it he knew it was true you heard us in that day how the anakims were there and that the cities were great and fence and so be the Lord will be with me then shall I be able to drive them out as the Lord said so his Mountain wasn't a freebie his Mountain had some struggles I want to ask you is your Mountain got some struggles in it amen are you going to overcome are you going to claim that mountain it's your Mountain it's the promised word of the hour our Mountain to stand on the word of God to claim the promise but it's not only sister Jerry and I was talking about this a little bit and I I haven't really researched it probably shouldn't say anything but my brother and sister you know uh the seventh seal is a an open Revelation right but it's only open if you have stepped into it you stand on the outside and look at the seventh seals being open no wonder people can debate or not they've never went in so Joshua said I'm just as strong to go out as I was to go in I was just as strong to leave the world as I was to go into Christ amen fight this my brother and sister and see everything is fenced and the Lord will be with me then I should be able to drive everything out and Joshua blessed him and gave unto Caleb the son of Jeff Hein what's it look like in Hein is it a valley well there is a valley of Hein but the point that was historically recorded is calum's position his place is on the mountain Saints this is our recorded place on the mountain do we have a moment just to read one little quote uh 1962 10 and 13 of 62 the influence of another now brother bram's coming up to a prayer here and he says now with our heads bowed and our heart hearts uh bowed to in his holy reverence I wonder if there'd be some in here tonight that would have a request that they is burning on their heart and I think we could tonight Saints maybe maybe you could just go follow this do you have something a request that's burning on your heart they might just raise up their hand before God God and say in your prayer Lord Jesus I have needs I've got my hand up Lord Jesus I have needs speak to me tonight amen heal me give me my financial needs what was he doing he he's actually my brother and sister maybe I'm assuming he's actually speaking to a need without Discerning it openly like calling them out when he says give them healing give them financial needs I don't think those were random words he threw out I believe it discerned the hearts and the needs of those Believers at that time or whatever it is he supplies all our need God bless you about 90% of this congregation I didn't realize it was on the screen sorry 90% now we either have to believe that those people were as genuine as we are see there the naysayers are going yeah those people are just ignorant I believe they were just as sincere and just as in tune as we are and you got 90% of a church raising hands I have something burning on my heart I have something I have need of and I I just it this caught me as I was looking at this the two things that he he speaks out healing no doubt physically spiritually financially speaking to the needs of the people musicians had just come I say tonight I would just like to encourage us to take a moment just lift our hands say Lord you know what my need is amen I Need A Closer Walk with You Lord I need a a deeper consecration in my life I need healing in my body I maybe you got some doubt you got some fear you got some things where Satan's just stirring things up in your life and and it's all cloudy but you have this need you need this leadership from the Lord I say we just lift our hands and we just claim that Lord I have these needs and father I just give them to you father I'm on my Mountain I'm in the word Lord I might need your grace but it's not because I don't want to live it I need your grace father because I'm trying and sometimes I make mistakes but father I know that you gave me this promise you gave me promise Lord my own life my wife my children this body of Believers you gave us the promise of your word and you your promise we're just coming tonight to just ask you Lord to deal kindly with us Lord we're searching for answers father help us to find the answers Lord if we are not inspired we don't feel the answers Lord father just give us the correct nudge father just lead us to the truth for the needs that we have the things father sometimes we don't even realize how important they are to our life or we don't sense the urgency but we ask you father come nudge us father if that's what it takes lead us Lord whisper to our hearts and souls pull us into your presence father Lord we're here

tonight with my hands Lord Just Lead Me Lord Just Lead Me Lord to walk to walk right into my promise father it's right here in this Wilderness of sin but father you took my brother Caleb right through it he seen the unbelief Lord no doubt as the scripture says kades Baria when they turned down the word he wept but father father we see here in this scripture that Lord even though he was weeping there he had come to the day to declare I'm just as strong now as when Moses asked me to go out and manifest the word and bring the evidence of the Holy Spirit back to the people I'm just as strong now Lord when you ask me to cross over and come and bring some evidence back to the people Lord I am just as strong today Lord as the day you called me to live this message I'm just as strong today Lord as when you called me as a Son of God and Lord I'm going to be bold to declare it let that be our prayer let that be our declaration we're not ashamed we're not afraid we're not weaklings we're
