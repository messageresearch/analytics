family of our brother charlie sister rachel we say oh how sad it is taken so young do you know over in glory they're saying wow you know what we're so glad you're going to spend this time with us that you're not caught up in that time down there and uh we're happy to have you with us and we're over here saying oh we're sad they're gone but my brother and sister they by god's grace god knew exactly when where how why the time condition all that mattered was their maturity in the word of god that their souls were settled amen and god said come home amen hallelujah i'm looking for that day everybody's like oh it'd be so sad they died young oh no they graduated early amen hallelujah hallelujah greetings to our brother sergey sister luba brother sergey would you like to come greet the people no okay okay amen well we want to uh just had a lovely conversation with brother george yesterday he sends his greetings and a big bless you and just discussing some things which when they come to maturity we'll definitely share with the church so i gave uh our greetings back to him for you uh sister marin brother joshua welcome home amen glad to have you back now i'm kind of out of the loop so i really you know can't answer this um so much i'm i'm saying that no news is good news for sister thomas i don't know if i even can say the baby's name correct deanna i got close didn't i come on somebody say good job amen amen so anyway we just pray god's blessings for them i just wait to hold that little girl claim her as our own amen and we want to remember our brother sergey out on the road we'll be home in a day or two or three whatever the timing would be so we want to remember him and we want to always and i know you do we always want to keep brother prashant sister concha in our prayers amen we love them so much and we miss them and so just lift them up i'm brother david wonderful to hear our brother wayne uh and uh just to see god come on the scene see the devil would put us in the emergency room god took us out amen the devil would say i want you to accept this and god's there saying i want you and as as brother david was praying i just felt led i i was brother david i i think it was that same spirit just that connection i was praying for ephah but something come upon me it's like i'm not just praying for ifa to be healed pancreas listen pancreas listen you were meant to provide all the necessary for life in this child and now you listen to the word of god you're healed pancreas amen hallelujah [Applause] people say we don't believe in healing then we don't believe in the word of god if we don't believe in that amen so let's just uh this morning if we would let's just stand i want to speak to you once again uh just a continuation of our position of strength and our title today or thought would be to be found worthy amen um and that is my brother and sister you know we can preach on enoch and we have many times but the key is not just to say wow you know enoch walked with god and was pleasing i want you not literally but i want you to white out enoch put your name in there that our heart's desire would be that we would walk with god and we would live pleasing not live you see the scripture doesn't say he lived religious that's right he lived pleasing amen quite a difference because we can be religious without being pleasing but if you are pleasing then god will put the right spirit on you to live amen hallelujah to be found worthy is our hearts desire today amen let's turn in esther the third chapter and today i want to just kind of uh uh i'm going to take a thought and i'm going to as it were stretch it out saint so i i hope today that your mind's uh your approach to the word of god would be i guess you would say elastic uh because sometimes we have these things hidden in the word of god there's types there's shadows there's things that are interconnected because he's the same yesterday today and forever so whatever pattern he used in the beginning we can anchor our soul on that same pattern today knowing that if god healed then he heals now if he delivered then he delivers now if he's saved then he saves now if he gave eternal life then he gives eternal life now amen and if he says i love you to them he says i love you to you amen after these things did king a hazaris promote haman the son of a matthew the agtite and advanced him and set his seed above all the princes that were with him now expand your thinking my brother and sister some things took place before the earth would be as we know it now some things took place in heaven some things were fulfilled or magnified and set his seat above all the princes that were with him and all the king's servants that were in the king's gate bowed and reverenced haman for the king had so commanded concerning him but mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence then the king's servants which were in the king's gate said to mordecai why transgressors thou the king's commandment now came to pass when they spoke daily unto him and he hearkened not unto them that they told haman to see whether mordecai's matters would stand for he had told them that he was a jew and when haman saw that mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence then was haman full of wrath and he thought scorn to lay hands on mordecai alone for they had showed him the people of mordecai wherefore haman sought to destroy all the jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of hazras even the people of mordecai now in this interesting saints if i could interject this you have one son or daughter of god stand up and say you know what it's been revealed to me of the word devil i'm done with you pushing back you know the devil doesn't just come to that man or woman's house he gets angry at the whole body of believers because you see he's afraid that the revelation of deliverance would come to the whole body and when the revelation of deliverance comes to the whole body satan's got trouble on his hands now if one's got a victory over here and everybody else is sitting there under the cloud woe unto me then satan says that's fine because after a while the people will view that one as a fanatic they'll view that one as being a little far out on the limb because the rest of us have no joy no victory no answered prayer but amen one of the most contagious things i was just texting with brother greg alford he gives greetings to you also he was like brother paul we're doing well here we have overcome we've had coven even though we're double vaccinated but all is well amen now you see my brother and sister we look at these things of the world and the world says this is what you've got to conform to hallelujah i hope you understand this this morning you rebels but you see we're not rebelling against god we're rebelling against lucifer and his kingdom aren't you glad this morning you have a reason to say i'm a rebel amen because you are not going to conform to the things of this earth and that's another sermon part six seven eight nine brother david you would understand that anyway look destroy all the jews throughout the whole kingdom of a hazardous even the people of mordecai in the first month that is the month of nisin in the 12th year of king hazaras they cast per that is the lot before haman from day to day and from month to month to the 12th month that is the month of adar haman said unto king hazarath there is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of that kingdom and their laws are diverse from all people neither do they keep the king's laws therefore it is not for the king's prophet to suffer them if it please the king let it be written that they may be destroyed and i will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have charge of the business to bring it into the king's treasures and the king took his ring from his hand and gave it unto haman the son of hamadath the agtite the jews enemy and the king said unto haman the silver has given thee the people also to do with them as it seemeth good to thee heavenly father we just ask for your blessings today lord if you would just break open the word of life to us let it become so real to us father we walk out of here lord just shouting victory today not walk out of here saying that touched me or that was a good thought but lord let it move right down into the depths of the souls of your people that lord they can rise up and say i have victory oh in the day that i'm lit the day i was called the hour my circumstance i have victory lord that is our heart's desire lord bless your people bless the word today in the name of jesus christ amen and amen you may be seated amen god bless our visitors amen um look my brother and sister i hope today you can just kind of follow along a kind of a broad stretch i tried to break this down smaller and i found myself trying to as it were if i would put it in this example to explain the workings of the adam when i myself don't always understand what the working is amen so we'll just take this and i believe i'm preaching to real christians to bible readers bible believers and so as we'll look at this today you're going to have to just stretch out pull some of these things in and you know i find it relevant because you know while sometimes the preacher he doesn't have a clue what it is but god has already anointed many of you to read scripture read quotes study these things and it's there that the preacher because of his position is trying to fill in every little hole for you when you were there saying i just read that i just woke up to that i was just singing that this is real to me amen and so you know we know our god is an awesome god amen and he has a mighty work that he is performing in his people and it's in that work my brother and sister that that uh we find that we are all joined together oh how many times that we might just look i have friends in different parts of the world and maybe you just look into their world and i'm always amazed that uh we look into what friends are doing happening in the church you know in europe or somewhere else and find out wow this is stunning they're preaching on the same thoughts they're preaching on the same things there's no collusion here there is no memo that's been sent out in the month of june preach on this it's the holy ghost moving upon his people because you see my brother and sister this bride is not going to have a rapture for these over here and then rapture for those over there this bride will be ready for the rapture amen she's ready for the calling away she's she's not just piecemealed together but she is the complete revelation of jesus christ amen if we go to the second chapter of esther i i want to use this as a footnote and by god's grace we'll be able to tie this all back together but as king uh as and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight now look at this my brother and sister no other woman why woman represents what church no other one found favor like esther did found favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of vashti and i i include that today because as it is in the title here we're seeing today to be found worthy or to find favor my brother and sister is so important we are not here just to be religious as it were to receive an attendance award of not missing a service in 50 years i just read a little article i'm not making fun of this i actually think it is very incredible and very commendable that a church back east i believe is in pennsylvania gave an award to a couple there uh they'd been married 50 years and had not missed a church service in 50 years they obviously didn't travel but you look at that and realize what what a commendation for for their devotion but my brother and sister 50 years without revelation uh 50 years without the holy ghost none of that would matter so we pray that these people actually had obtained that position of finding favor before god and not just an award because it was their life it was their social it was all that was encompassing to them and so we look at that my brother and sister and realize that we could live to be a hundred but if we do that without having god in our life in the control tower then we have we have not really accomplished anything great so as we'll look at this and see that the king loved esther above all the churches he loved the bride above all the other brides the other potential brides and she you see it doesn't say that her and 50 other girls found grace in favor it was she that found favor in his sight amen and i've preached on that and we're going to move on but i just want to reiterate this my brother and sister that's how she came boldly to the throne is she had caught a revelation that she had found favor see if we never come to the place that we have confidence to come before god to boldly approach the throne and ask him then we will spend our life begging god god's not looking for beggars he's looking for a wife that's got such complete confidence in him that she can say you know what my husband is the king of kings he is the lord of lords he's a ruler of all the creator of all and i have been given a decree to come boldly to the throne and to come boldly means you come with confidence now we'll lap into this by god's grace but remember the word says that if you have no condemnation then you have confidence in god yes sir i want to lay this little foundation just as a reminder god has never condemned people say i feel so condemned when i go to church something's wrong either you're misunderstanding it been taught wrong or maybe by god's grace today i can lay that foundation out for you you might understand but you see god never condemns god convicts that's right and conviction is what brings us to repentance and repentance is what brings us to spiritual growth see we can never skip over the repentance and expect oh i've got revelation not if you don't have repentance you don't have revelation you have an intellectual understanding but you don't have true revelation because true revelation means that there is nothing between you and god god can communicate or speak to you clearly amen so we look at this and realize that now out of esther the second chapter we see this great event laying this and here again let me be redundant that she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins now we understand in life and in the word of god that at any one time multiple stories are taking place so it's not uh ever we read the book of esther and we can transplant esther right to the 21st century and overlay that and while you say well it doesn't fit perfect my brother and sister god is not here to come and satisfy your view god's here to reveal his word and reveal the life that was behind the word to make it real to you now we might use a word of concepts and say well the concept is now my brother and sister god does not deal in concepts in the definition that the world has today but the whole concept of the word of god is that it was the same from the very beginning of time and will be the same exact word amen god didn't say now it will be this until culture comes it will be this until you are woken well no maybe it will be till you're woken hallelujah it's when we wake up and realize who we are in jesus christ but not to this woke thing that's going on right now not to this that's all caught up in this and caught up god didn't say i'll be the same until we come to that day he said i will be the same from the beginning i am the alpha and i am the omega you can count on me you can count on me if i ever was a savior i'm a savior now if i was ever a provider i'm a provider now if i was ever a healer i'm a healer now now look my brother and sister the reason we must anchor that is because in the world today people are preaching that god is conscious of culture no i'm sorry whether you're talking about africa you're talking about europe you're talking about all of the different countries and cultures my brother and sister it's the same god amen he doesn't have a culture for this place and a culture for that place he's got a culture among his people that they hold the word up in reverence and the word becomes their anchor it becomes their guiding light it becomes everything to them it is no longer i am of this or i am of that we use these terms sometimes and i can't use it anymore because we did ancestry.com and found out i'm point like 003 german i used to blame it on the german in me but they're so little german and then it turns out they weren't even real germans they moved there from somewhere else so i can't come and say well it's because i did then i struggle to serve god i struggle to serve god because i have not made up my mind and my heart to give myself completely to him and the moment i give myself completely to him the culture of my irish temper and of my german stubbornness and all of this and all that it all fades away and i say i'm a new creature in christ jesus today all things have passed away and i no longer have an excuse i want to stand saint as much as we are in the flesh and as much as we are human i want to stand i am not of this world i'm not of an attitude i'm not of a spirit i'm of christ hallelujah just a temporary time on this earth then i get a walk through this and in that time i get to decide how committed i am how devoted i am what is my priority i get to decide that isn't it awesome some people are kind of scared well i wish god would just make the decision for me well i'm telling you i actually love free moral agency i'm in church today i'm excited i got up early this morning and i looked at the word of god and i was able to say lord let this live today let this be real today let this speak to somebody's heart today and i got to make that decision nobody wrong my phone this morning and said get out of bed go get in the word of god write these things down no something in my heart says i want to come and i want to bring something that would bless you and i tell you it's so much beyond the human element so much beyond the human element saints oh he's such a great preacher no he serves a great god and that great god said i'm going to use that manner that woman to do my work and it's no longer a one-man ministry this is a body ministry a bride coming in maturity to be able to say lord i want to please you i'm not pleasing the bishop i'm not pre uh pleasing the pastor or the board or the committee i'm not pre pleasing the group of people i'm pleasing god oh hallelujah now look at this my brother and sister any one time multiple stories taking place at just a simple example as this world is slipping off into the abyss let me just share with you over my just like always that's why i can't even tell jokes i'm just i always forget that one little key ingredient that makes a difference just over in england a school has now decided that girls cannot wear dresses to school because they're going to embrace the gender oh this is why i forgot something about the gender ed they're embracing it so everyone in the school now boys and girls has to wear trousers but you can wear shorts but they're getting rid their excuse was we're getting rid of the skirts because the girls were wearing above their knee but they can wear shorts that are above the knee it's not about the knee being exposed it's about that conniving slippery haman i mean the devil trying to come and set the stage where some family would be like well you know we want our daughter to dress right but the school says and then they introduce them into a culture that was not meant for a godly little girl and then the parents come along years later and say well we didn't have any idea that would cause that when we recognize the devil and his work then god brings and i'm way ahead of myself but god gives discernment to the body of christ the devil is exposed to a real christian amen when you realize that no matter what agenda they use they are going to one term and that is satan made a promise that he would get you away from the word of god from the principles of the word of god and so he just works on that and he works on that and he works on that amen we might come back and revisit that because it's a little out of line but you look at this well look at this the multiple story going on the world's slipping into the abyss but the bride of christ is putting on her royal garments amen esther did not come into the king dressed like a shag i'm sorry that's street language i shouldn't use it forgive me but when you see people in ripped jeans tank tops look like hobos going into the house of god to come before the king drafts like a hobo because maybe my king likes the latest fashions no i'm sorry kings don't like fashion kings like reverence they like uh you know respect they like honor and as the rules have been set and they're there just think about it in the natural this is how you go we wouldn't my goodness my brother and sister do you know even in this modern day if you went to the white house even as a war hero or some great uh philanthropist or something uh they're not going to let you in there looking like a hobo because you're disrespecting the office and so you look at this and see now in the world we're living how it is that they are so demeaning god in every fashion that he's become commoner not royalty saints he's become commoner but the bride of christ putting on her royal garments right she's clothed in the word of the hour she's not coming with some age-old religion and i'm not speaking against any church but my brother and sister when you see in the world today religion after religion church after church saying well you know what to reach the culture i mean reach the people we need to embrace the culture so they'll feel comfortable in our midst well my goodness here is a nice big hundred car train going to hell let's all get on it but here's what's interesting every woman had the same exact options esther did that's right see people say you guys think you're something special you guys think you're this you know those are all the signs of a cult well no i'm well okay saints i have something to break to you today i've been kind of nervous about putting this out but um paul haylett belongs to a colt now colt published a book and said you'll follow the rules that's right now if this would qualify me to be in a cult then i will stand up and proudly say i am in a cult but you see my brother and sister if we and i've shared this with you before if we got realistic to the modern church they would come and say we don't believe this and rip the page out and they could turn the bible into a pocket bible because there wouldn't be very many pages left in it and it would easily fit in their pocket and that is what's happening in the world today my brother and sister they say they testify of christ but really if you ask them they'll tell you we are of this church and we are of that church and we believe this and we believe that and you'll see i'm going to come back and hit this i hope i don't offend anybody but you'll see my brother and sister one by one every major religion on the face of the earth is embracing the spirit of laodicea and they are going against the word of god and they claim they're doing it for the people well what are they wanting to do with the people what are they wanting to do for the people where are they wanting to send the people i can tell you from an honest open heart and you know me i want to see you in the rapture i want to walk with you on those streets of gold i want to stand in the throne of almighty god and worship him and be able to look over and say god bless you brother sergey god bless you brother jason god bless you brother scott and be able to say that to every one of you we're not here to build a church we're not here to build some earthly kingdom we're not here to be in the fashion of religion brother brown said that religion was big business and if you don't think so you know stephen fertig 18 million dollar house every pastor hear me well church every pastor ought to have an 18 million dollar house really really i mean seriously as long as they're still missionaries in the jungles in the deserts the highways the byways an 18 million dollar house my goodness they ought to be charged with embezzlement from the kingdom of god amen so every woman every church has had the same options that esther did and some you know thought that the king would like the latest passions and those kind of thoughts going on we won't visit every one of those amen but i'm telling you in the day that we live in because the word of god promised it for no other reason alone but the word of god this bible promised that there would be a church there would be a people here a bride that says i want to be clothed in the word of god i want to be clothed in that i want the word wrapped around me and if the word comes and speaks to me not condemnation but conviction of the heart and i can look at that and say i'm not doing it correctly lord forgive me aren't you glad for that kind of spirit to be able just to have the lord move upon you and you can say lord forgive me i don't want to be contrary to your word i want to line up amen but you see my brother and sister while all of this is going on there is accuser that has access to the king oh we have types in the bible think of job the accuser mordecai has access to the king just like esther does the bride of christ a real christian the day we live in has been given the decree to come boldly to the throne of god but did you know that god left the door open for satan to come because he is the accuser of the brethren he's not standing outside a door in the dark making his accusation he has been given the opportunity to come right oh hang on right to the same throne room that you boldly come to god left the door open for the devil to come into that same throne room and make the accusation oh now you say but why would god do that well i'll tell you why my brother and sister in just a few minutes if i don't get sidetracked but you see this accuser has access to the king right we can take verse eight there and haman said unto king hauser there's a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among all the people of laodicea can i have that liberty this morning spread all across the world in the age of laodicea all in the provinces of your kingdom what is this this is the devil coming telling there's some people and you know what he always mingles the truth well let me reverse that he always mingles some lie in the truth because look at this let me let me expound on this before we hurry on certain people scattered abroad dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom their laws are diverse from the whole rest of this world this world is not my home i'm just passing through america my treasures are not in this world right here no years ago somebody kind of i won't go into the story but kind of made a little accusation with paul your benefit on being a pastor of a church it's about the money at that time i had an opportunity to have picked up another farm and and i looked at this and i'm thinking okay if i rent this other farm here big farm and because the guy rented at that time still renting it it would have been long term i wouldn't have known that at the time but and i remember i turned it down because i thought lord i can't pastor a church and do all of this god was teaching me that you know you can't serve two masters and it's hard sometimes even in the little world i live in right now out here as a farmer that is sometimes hard you've seen it this spring the weather has made it very difficult for me and i'm not happy about that saints i'm not like whoa praise god i don't have to preach i'm not happy about that but to have somebody say well it's about the money and i remember i told them i was a little frustrated i probably was a little forceful the wife says i do that once in a while i was like if it was about the money i'd go out here and i would farm more land because it doesn't talk back so you see we have to choose what world are we off what what what is it that we want to be identified as so we're the certain people but this world's not our home we're not of its culture my brother and sister i i look at things you know study things and look at what's going on around us and and i'm like you know um uh well let me just put it this way i've seen a bumper sticker once this says nobody puts a bumper sticker on a maserati yeah and it was a car that had about 40 bumper stickers on the back of it it was like i don't know if you drive one forgive me but i think it was like some little fiat something sprite definitely wasn't a fiat pepsi or something it was a fiat sprite um so you see we're not of its culture it's like why what are what are people doing christians putting religious tattoos on their bodies the word of god says not to mark yourself but i'm doing this for the glory of god somebody's fooling you because that's contrary to the word and if it's contrary to the word then god won't bless it regardless of your intention amen amen we're not of its nature my brother and sister you go out here and there's people i know hey paul you know of course you would never do something like this but a bunch of us guys are going to go you know celebrate the end of the harvest well i'm celebrating the end of the harvest yes hallelujah it's good it's an end time and we're celebrating the harvest i think i'll go down to church with some sons and daughters of god and i'll lift my hands and celebrate this great harvest that god is performing i'm not going down to some nightclub and and drink free liquor and blah blah blah no that's not a celebration of this kind of people that haman didn't like amen now look at this my brother and sister first peter amen let's move forward here and catch first peter now first peter 2 and 8 a stone of stumbling in a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word why are they stumbling at the word because there's something in them that doesn't want to obey the word not a man in a pulpit not a church with a name the word of god you're legalists i don't know if i'm legalist or not but i do know when the word says don't do it he means don't do it and when he says do this he means do it excuse me for getting excited i'm sorry i've had this all bottled up all week and now it's coming out hallelujah being disobedient wherein to also ouch this always hurts they were appointed amen but somebody ought to rejoice here in verse nine but ye meaning you and i here are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation oh this is the peculiar people that haman was talking about this is a peculiar people that don't follow the rules of this world these are people that have another that they're following that you should show forth the praises of him and called you out of darkness into his marvelous light now i don't mean trying to break these habits of getting too personal with you but who could lift a hand and say thank you lord for the marvelous life thank you lord that the light is shining down the word of god is opened up and i don't mind being you know i've told you this before and i'm not trying to point it to me but just to make the point i know how some of my farmer neighbor friends think so i just turned the i just turned i countered it on them so something will be done and they'll be like what are you doing this weekend paul i'm going to church hmm yeah i know you guys think i'm a religious freak but then again setting well i hope you guys don't mind i get pretty blunt with these guys sitting there in your little shorts by your poo with that body and getting drunk doesn't sound so cool either you think i'm a freak i think you're a freak i think you want to sit in front of all of your friends wives with that body and a little set of shorts half drunk that takes something special i'm not that special come on saints i i say that a little bit i don't i don't mean it mocking but i say that a little bit facetious but you see they think we're insane come on when has it ever been appealing my brother and sister to look at that but they're under an anointing that they go out in public and it's there that they dress and act in that fashion and they say we're normal i have to disagree politely and sometimes as i just shared with you some of my friends not so politely but you see my brother and sister it's there that when we recognize we're a chosen generation we are a royal priesthood this is your ancestry amen this is the religious as it were the christians ancestry.com amen take me back i was chosen it takes me back and shows me i come from a royal priesthood i come out of a holy nation i come out of a peculiar people not common not the run of the mill not that just whatever's cast everywhere living every old way and doing every old thing i come from a peculiar people but that don't mean i'm weird unless of course the devil or haman says i am and then it must be fact if he says it is it must be fact if he says that i'm not good enough to be a son of god or a daughter of god it must be fact if he says that i'll never make it it must be fact if he says i can't be healed it must be fact come on saints you see what the devil's doing amen to peculiar people why so we could show forth the praises of him now if we can't get the praises out then something is not working if we can't come forth with praises from our lips from our soul my brother and sister then satan's got something nipped in your life i'll give you an idea how the power of life is i don't know what to do about it either i got to talk to a friend that does this kind of stuff there's a tree in our backyard it's been there for i wouldn't know how long long time those who had been the house big tree do you know those tree roots go underneath our foundation go all the way across our crawl space and are now trying to come up in that little courtyard area that we haven't put a deck or patio in yet looking for life nothing's going to stop it and that route is just going along there and it's looking for life you know it didn't try and grow in the crawl space never put off one single sprout in the crawl space but when it went under the foundation on the other side of our house and came up said there's light here there's light here and in a dark age in a dark experience a lifetime of darkness it finally found light and it sprouted and it appeared and come up hallelujah aren't you glad some of us went through the crawl space for a long time it looked like we belonged there but god said you just keep going you just keep searching you just keep doing it and i'll lead you to the light i want to know why didn't it turn right why didn't it turn left why did it go the direction it went i'm talking about it went straight across the crawl space something in it said there's light over there there's life over there you wonder if we're not a chosen people or not my brother and sister otherwise we'd be just sorry i don't mean to do it in such a fashion so direct but otherwise we would just be another woman chasing drunk that's right but god said there's lie just keep going there's light hallelujah so the accuser has the access and what's he accusing you of one and some place in our life every one of us experiences you're not worthy come on can we be bold today has anybody ever experienced that i'm not worthy god wouldn't have chose me i i couldn't possibly be do you know what's happening saint did you know that when the devil comes and he makes these accusations it's not about how smart you are the devil don't condemn you iq is not high enough uh it's you're too tall or you're too short it's where you live i'm telling you i say our our brothers and sisters are not here this morning or sister sophie and sister grace are but i've had people tell me well you know those christians in africa don't have the revelation that we do and what rock did you crawl out from under every nation kindred and tongue especially the state of idaho no nonsense saints that's right god's people were created equal in his sight amen they are not a lesser they are not a greater they are sons and daughters of god and god made us equipped for certain callings for certain things and you might find one from here that's a little smarter person a little more determined over here a little of this or a little of that but he's given there you tom otherwise we'd say all people pray equally so what's the accuser he's telling you you're not worthy but did you know what he learned a long time ago when he comes to condemn you to accuse you he doesn't come with the satanic handbook it exists that's right he comes tell me if i'm not telling you the truth he comes with this right here and makes his accusations this is where he takes his foundation from you can't be you because you are here you don't this right here see you missed it you're not good enough you're not this you're not that oh we make mistakes come on let's let's be let's be real we make mistakes but satan comes and he says look i have the word of god and you made that mistake and i'm judging you from the word of god that you made a mistake oh isn't this clever of the devil amen but remember it was god that left the door open for that so if god didn't want you to have to face to face with the word now look my brother and sister the difference that is we say well i blame the devil he's just beating me down no my brother and sister i'm sorry the devil's not beating you down it's when you choose that's it come on when you choose condemnation over conviction it's when you come to the place that you say god doesn't love me or that preacher is hard on me i don't like his preaching because he's kind of loud this morning come on choose choose you know the old phrase i heard it a lot growing up if the few fits wear it if the shoe doesn't fit then say devil you're out of luck but you know there's been a time or two in my life you might seem this is a paradox that the devil trying to condemn me actually brought to light something in my own life so look at this now the devil thinks he's free thinks he's a free moral agent but god is putting the harness on the devil sometimes amen he allows those i know brothers that have went well i don't even really like to share it uh but i know brothers that their life would be just um my how do i say this politely utter wrecks will be a very simple utter wrecks have done things in their life they're ashamed that the world might find out and grew up in christian homes they're preachers children spent all the days of their life from first to 18 going to church turn and go out a different avenue and as time went on you think oh my the devil's got control of them but you realize it's god that has the bit in the devil's mouth and god just lets the devil go here and lets the devil go there and let him wreak havoc in their life because god said i will bring them back amen they're mine and i will harness the devil to take them down a road that causes them to say i can't go any further and the devil's there take your life become a drunk in an alley do this and do that and in that moment of despair god raises something up inside of them and they say i remember a time before i gave my life to this before i let the devil lead me then i had a peace in my soul i remember a time at 16 years old that i love the lord and i'm telling you i could name their names right now and you could go verify it but it wouldn't be fair to them my brother and sister 41 years old sitting on a bar stool and some guy that he works with saying god's not even real these fools that believe there is and the guy stands up in the bar room and turns to him and says you're a liar i know god is real with a beer in his hand what was it god harnessed the devil brought it for that man to make a statement but there had to be a seed down inside there and that man put that beer down and walked out of there and then from that day on his friend said he's losing his mind he's losing his mind he he used to do this and he used to do this he used to do that and he'd do none of this now and now he's really quiet he's really morose he's he's just not what is going on until one day he couldn't do it any longer amen oh did i fail to mention that he was gay to add one more layer of the impossibility that people would bring the story is much longer but my sheep hear my voice and the master started calling and the sheep started responding you know it's a marvelous thing those people that are around livestock them dumbo goats them dumble sheep dumbo cows them dumbo horses them dumbo burrows dumbo pigs are more spiritual than a lot of people yeah i won't go there get sidetracked sister jerry had a boar one time you know oh let's skip it let's just skip it but satan's learned that he haman learned he can use the king's word against the king's people see so it is what is he doing satan's condemnation is to point out your shortfall to the words of the king you'll never you'll never live up to this you'll never rise up here you'll never do this amen but we see as well we see night and day saints come on saying see uh you ever do that do you ever wake up at 2 a.m i just had that happen here a few days ago wake up at 2 a.m in the morning and you're there and it's like why did i wake up i don't know why i woke up roll over in bed because i've learned this works you don't need to go to a doctor and get some drugs to go to sleep you need to roll over in bed put your face in the mattress and start praying and the devil will knock you out that's right and if he doesn't knock you out then you'll be able to start at one end of this valley to the other and from side to side from those pews to this pew to that until you went through it and you'll have this glorious opportunity to pray for everybody in the body of christ yeah you might get up the next day and you'll be tired and you'll yawn and you'll struggle through the whole day and you say oh that was terrible i slept bad but i prayed good thank you lord amen because the devil amen is going to accuse night and day amen he's ever unrelenting his brother david nash shared that right it's no longer a musket shooting the fiery dart it's a machine gun and he's pounding away amen we see his false accusations now i can't remember exactly how that deal is but you know fear is false however that goes okay false evidence appearing real i couldn't get the evidence part false evidence appearing real do you realize saints oh i hope i'm not keeping you too long when the devil starts to tell you that you can't and you won't and you're unworthy and all of this that is false evidence amen and i i'll kind of parry this down a little bit i can prove to you it's false evidence because before all these things come out before haman the devil got brave enough to make his accusations public god had already brought down and the king had already looked at esther and found her worthy oh it wasn't after these things come you're a jew my my queen my wife is a jew no sir the king had already deemed her worthy of his love worthy of the title worthy of the position worthy of the benefits that came with that before the devil could ever stand up and say hey she's connected to these people that are the rebels in your kingdom never had a chance amen god cut the time short on haman hallelujah amen but look at this so this false evidence appearing real now you know i know you know this but just to bring this in your mind in a way do you realize satan knows that every one of his converts is going to hell satan doesn't have a paradise satan's got nothing in colorado a few years ago very interesting story by god's grace and mercy sister jerry and i own a couple little pieces of dirt and so things in real estate kind of interest me and this case come up made it all the way to the colorado supreme court so here is a big house sitting on a lot and here is a big house sitting a lot but this lot is steep and the man wanted to build a shop in the back of this lot so he approaches his neighbor and he says my property's too steep if i built a shop up here could i drive up the edge of your property to get to my shop fred's my neighbor we barbecue together our kids go to school together we attend the same church we believe god is real i hope you follow me because the devil believes god is real you better know when he got slapped right out of heaven to the earth he knew god was real you know how time just goes by you know how the devil put that one little thing i'm not even going to presume to dig in your lives deep enough to tell you what it is although i believe god would reveal what it is and you've let the devil trespass in your life for how many years go ahead answer that to yourself how many years has the devil been a trespasser finally one day this man says hey my son's getting married i think i'm going to build a house on this lot tells a neighbor you won't be able to drive up there any longer we're going to build a house there and the neighbor said no you're not and he said what do you mean you're not building a house on that property and he said how are you going to stop me i'll show you how i'm going to stop you this neighbor here took that neighbor to court and because for seven years he had had complete access the man was clever he didn't drive up the edge of the property over time he moved the driveway into the middle of the property and in court someone helped me i can't remember what that term is huh well yeah they have yeah you're right we'll just use squadron's rights because i can't think of anyway in court the judge says now how long has this man been driving on this over seven years he catches spiritual side things he has rights now the devil comes and accuses you he's not going to come and say excuse me you push back and say no no no you have no right to my life no no i've been trespassing in your life for more than seven years i have rights that's why saints the scripture says when one would reject the devil and clean up the house if you don't fill it up he'll not only come and look in the window he'll go get seven more and move in and you'll be in worse shape than you was in the beginning so my brother and sister i want to make this point to you when the devil's coming to condemn you you have to put up the no tressing passing sign right then no give him time no i know i'll overcome this no i'm i'm working on it though pastor i'm working on it no drive the post in the middle of the driveway that the devil's using and put the no trespassing sign on it and say you're not welcome here because you realize saints the longer he trespasses the harder it will be to get rid of him anyway the courts realized there was a certain portion of deceit in the neighbors deal so the court did not award him get this please take this in your spiritual cap the court did not award him because this driveway was at the halfway mark of the property the court says there's a certain amount of deceit here so we'll only award him one-third of the property yeah you know what one-third of the property is one third of the property is that people will have a form of godliness they'll have a form my brother and sister just a form i was not called to just have form i was called to have liberty in jesus christ i was called to be able to walk as it were the term a freeborn son or daughter of god amen so satan knows satan knows amen that all his converts will be judged by the word of god so he knows that you're going to so he puts out a convincing argument that you'll decide you actually cannot live up to this my brother and sister i'm speaking strongly i'm sorry to our visitor this morning i'm speaking strongly but my brother and sister when you can go to church live any equine to life call yourself a christian you don't have god you have a form of amen amen and the devil know let them be just as religious as they can be but they won't read this serious enough to change their life and they'll look and they'll go to church and the preacher says man i feel condemned by the word and i'm uncomfortable being condemned by the word so i'm just going to water it down so it doesn't even condemn me the preacher but i'll tell you first and foremost not to put preachers in some elevated place but the word of god and the way god works it ought to move the preacher because if it won't move the preacher saints it won't move you if it won't cause the preacher to repent and live godly it won't cause you to repent and live godly and that's why god said i want my pulpit to be clean i want the people to look up and say you know what i'm going to stand on the pure word of god and preacher we're going to hold you accountable to stand on the pure word of god but we start watering it down because the preacher doesn't want to feel condemned either paul you don't have a right to preach like that no i do because i've walked down that road and i had to decide as i was preaching to you you wouldn't even have a clue how many times i'm preaching to you in a voice say listen listen paul and when i listened i wouldn't even tell you the times that it's almost just stop and walk away because it's like oh god i'm trying to get these people to live up to a standard and you just condemned me no no convicted the accuser says you're condemned but my god says i signed your pardon you may be condemned but i signed your pardon so what's the key that's left i have to reach out and take the pardon you have to reach out and take that and say you know what satan you're an accuser but you don't have the evidence convict me because my bible says that a son or daughter of god filled with the holy ghost cannot commit sin so therefore you have an empty lie of your condemnation and i'm going to stand on the word that i can't even commit sin because i will be quick as the holy spirit moves to put it back under the blood oh aren't you glad hallelujah you imagine if we were dragging all our baggage you imagine we'd need a church twice as big for the amount of people here today if we had excuse me i need this row for my baggage oh man we would have one of the biggest churches in nampa just for our little group because all of our baggage can i go on a little bit further amen now look here i love this oh my see who he's addressing not a bunch of babies to people that set in heavenly places and been blessed you see people have a hard time understanding that my brother and sister i've dealt with a lot of people and they're like i just don't see how see how see it like you see it have you ever been here no you know when the screen on your computer just goes through your picture album puts it up there i could talk about chile i could talk about different places south africa i could talk about all this kind of stuff just like you can talk about your places but you can never make it real enough to meet the person who's actually been there heavenly places some people are like well we had a really good service here a few weeks ago and brother andrew is coming next week and i expect it to be good um no they won't understand what it is to live in heavenly places but come on saints let's rise up to heavenly places don't listen don't question don't criticize don't look down on that don't say well they're just that's their little piper no come up into heavenly places amen that people have said in heavenly places and ben bless now he said you know something you've been taught you're saved and i want to tell you what it's all about oh i like that don't you i want to put your feet up in the heavens a little while instead of being so earthbound said now i want to tell you why i want to give you a little a little boost a little revival a little stimulation amen i like this stimulation kind of builds you up especially when you know where you can say it's thus saith the lord now look some people get all nervous about these things like let's saith the lord but i'll tell you what this bible means to me when i read that i am a chosen generation amen i take that as thus saith the lord this is not something god's going to come back and say no i decided not enough people or too many people signed up i'm done with that no sir this is us saith the lord it'll happen it'll happen amen oh hallelujah kind of build you up especially when you can say it's lust saith the lord now i want to speak to you said you that sits in heavenly places in christ jesus been blessed together with all spiritual blessings amen i don't know how much reading you do saints and i'm not saying this or criticized but i'm telling you it's a sign of the times i read every article i can find that talks about conditions of churches in this day you'd be surprised how much reading that is do you realize what they're saying common theme creeping into the religious world the bible is not meaning in um oh my the word just slipped off me bible's not literal it's a theoretical teaching it's coming out do you know that one of the parts of the southern baptist conference that broke away or just gave up is what they did they just literally gave up and now they kind of tore down anything that resembled any form of holiness and just said wow whatever you know you know what it's crept in when one well-known preacher said now look god created us all equal and this certain lady i'm not going to name her name she is anointed of god to preach and they brought her into the church oh she's anointed all right fiery got a mind that would make mine look like it mine's a cheap rubbermaid garbage can but they forgot what the word said they didn't care any longer my i tell you what we're not against our sisters in fact we ought to be treating them like queens which means paul needs to treat his better they're not to be stepped on they're not a doormat they're not second class but the word said right the words it's not that we are demeaning or looking down but the word said and you see little things like that starting to creep in and they say it doesn't matter she's more gifted than all of us men put together says the bible if they're really gifted ignore this what is the devil doing his anointing and then when it comes to judgment the devil's not going to say hey she did all this great stuff that's what they'll be saying they'll stand before god did we not we cast out demons and we did mighty works in thy name the devil's going to stand there in the judgment and say hey you broke this and this is what you're going to get judged with and people are going to say no no we follow that and he's going to say no but remember the devil did you guys ever do this i remember doing a little bit as kids you know where you get the light just right and you can we used to have a little it's almost like a comic book i remember it well you know hold your fingers it's like oh that's a rooster yeah secondhand light presented in such a fashion looks like a real thing but it's not amen such sorry i where did i go where was i going with that said together been blessed together with all spiritual blessings the gift of god manifesting divine healing prophecies everything going forth now you're growing up people i want to talk to you amen i'm addressing this to you now watch according amen now here it is i hope i'm going to let it soak in right real good because it'll do good maybe go plumbing to the bones according if he has chosen us in him who did i heard it and i come no no no you never he has chosen he past tense has chosen us the church esther the bride are you with me amen has chosen us the church in him how long ago last week no before the foundation paul last week or when you held the revival no before the foundation of the world now you can write on the cloud see he done what he chose us in him christ before the foundation of the world amen and long before haman got his decree to the king the king had already deemed esther the bride worthy to be loved and adored and to give his name to her oh the devil's making his accusation but i want you to remember god chose you gave a seal of approval amen to you before the foundation of the world he rolled up seven seals and he sealed them with the king signet and said inside here you will find redemption not in grace tabernacle not in the church down the street or the church down the street but in him oh hallelujah that's where the real seal was placed on it my brother and sister is when he placed a seal upon his own word and said i decree and signify and seal that these are my words oh hallelujah i could get off in a here as it were my brother and sister people caught up they read the bible what about the thunders i'll tell you what the thunders are god's voice to you amen it's not a man's voice it's not this church's voice it's god's voice to you and he sealed as it were his voice with his own seal and said those are my true words you live by them and you will find life hallelujah oh hallelujah is it okay to get excited in church hey look you know sometimes you guys just maybe don't realize who paul is sometimes a wife she's like hey try this you know that's right this breaks that breaks there's stress everywhere oh i don't want to go into that i don't want to go into that but sometimes the old outward man just looks like he's been beat up but the inner man the inner man's rejoicing thank you lord for your word thank you for life i need to hurry i need to hurry my time flies i wish we had a little time to go to job 7 37 and see where he said where was you when i laid the foundations of the world before i lay the foundation of the world declaring to be where they're fastened at or where was you when the morning star sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy telling to job buckle up yourself like a man i want to speak to you come on church it's time that we not offensively as humans but it's time for us to buckle up like a man and let god speak amen not to just have a little uh i felt good going to church today we should feel good to go to church but we should walk out saying thank you lord my soul is a little closer amen my soul has been it's been re uh oh i don't know i'll find different words that might kind of shock some of you to make that correlation do you need shocked any of you need revived yes sir every day we have way too much of this courtship thing in our mind about god oh here let me open the door for you well i was praying and god opened the door he's such a gentleman he loves me really what's that got to do with anything i'm telling you i've prayed and god's opened so many doors for me that had nothing to do with my spiritual position had all to do with natural things is that a sign god loves me no sign at all but i tell you people have this idea well god just loves me because he did this god gave me flowers i woke up in the morning to a beautiful sunrise that's all well and good hang on to your sports shoes cow i've got a god upper visitor doesn't get offended with this i got a god that seduced me my y'all some of you you ought to thank me your ear hairs have just singed no sir are you with me i got a god that come and said i'm going to be so intimate to you i'm going to take it beyond you going to church and you put a name on the page and that you read your bible and that you pray i'm going to take it as it were into that other room and i'm going to become so real to you that when they come and say oh god's not real you'd be able to say no that's not right they say god's not a healer you can say no you don't know him then and they come and say well it's this and it's that and you say no and they say well how would you know because i've been in the bedroom with him i have an intimate relationship with jesus christ i have that personal side it's not a church relationship it's not of this relationship it's my relationship and he has come and become so real to me amen so please understand i hope that's not offensive to anyone the way i brought them out but people want to be wooed oh lord how about for three or four years you'll buy me flowers and chocolates and give me the nicer things of life and then i'll know that you love me buckle up yourself like a man i want to speak to you paul says he chose us in him the church before the foundation of the world now watch we should be holy not our own holiness our sisters wear dresses does that make us holy i've shared with you about kerry our college school mate in business class at jerry and i i was sure that carrie she had long hair beautiful hair yeah she always wore a dress carrie gary are you pentecostal apostolic paul i'm a hippie now if a hippie can have a conviction to look like that how much more sons and daughters of god could have some convictions amen unfortunately her husband her significant other had here almost as beautiful as hers but that's irregardless amen now watch we should be holy not our own holiness well you say do you believe in holiness brother branham sure not mine his my holiness nothing he is perfect oh now let me hurry along here bye uh so i i'm not going to preach this quote here to you this was from last week you can go home you can read it but see he's given this beautiful compliment on how that these believers are winning the battle through the name and faith of jesus christ right in the camp of the leaders of darkness now you look out here saints and to anyone that think i was throwing stones down on any other church i'm not but you see the direction that's going there's a church that's not three quarters of a mile from here rad but ran an ad about suggestions to make us more relevant in the community going to all the nations and do what preach the gospel there's our relevance there's our relevance now i think it's commendable that they have the resources to provide free daycare and they have the resources to provide food bank and and uh cook meals and do these things i think that's commendable but what was our commission our commission was to go and preach the gospel you want to be life-changing share the gospel amen so here it is so a tremendous commendation mighty men of david invaded the camp of the enemy bring david thirst quenching water so these giants of faith invaded the realm of satan's earthly storm that's all saints we have invaded the stronghold of satan's earthly amen so here i just want to make reference we'll move on real quick here uh this right here is when they brought a woman before jesus that had been caught in the very act now it doesn't get any more blunt come on saints i'm not trying to be crafts i'm not trying to be crude but i'm telling you when they said caught in the very act there wasn't a rumor that something happened in that house over there this is a fact it was right there red-handed right before them they had the evidence no shadow of a doubt and so they bring it because their real motive now for doing this otherwise they'd just drug her out and of course you notice they don't say anything about the man they were going to let the man go the woman now got put on the hook and cast out his bait to find something against jesus and so they come and they ask him he lifted himself up and said to them real simple their point was here she is here she is we caught her in the very act and i mean literally i got my polaroid i'm sorry i'm being this blind i got my polo right here's the evidence jesus doesn't look at her and go oh you wretched woman why because there was some seed that was chosen before foundation of the world somehow we think the bible just means it's for our day no my brother and sister all through the ages all through the ages there was a seed that had been chosen before the foundation of the world they could not fail they could not fall they could not be abandoned they could not oh and so what's jesus do he says unto them hey how about you guys that are without sin i mean after all your religious leaders you're the preacher the bishop head deacons you're this you're that presbyters whatever you want to call it jesus knew how to do it he just says hey he is without sin then he cast the first stone right now reason i included this is this what satan's done he's got ample evidence saints in satan's book of life he's got ample evidence to lay this out see what you did remember this remember that unfortunately while we throw it under the blood it goes in the sea of god's forgetfulness god doesn't even remember it uh our minds just grind crying right when i was 18 i did this and when i would say this and i did this right and the devil's got his own version the devil's book of life is what i would call it here it's recorded you did this but you see if you take that as the evidence right there then we're guilty see haman said there's these people that won't even follow your laws come on in this spiritual type are you with me today he was talking about us we can't even follow the law but by god's grace there was a decree that said i'll put forth a decree you defend yourself i'm not going to defend myself i'm going to let the word defend me amen so he stoops down and he starts writing on the ground and i'm telling you saints i've always wondered what did he write there is your curiosity ever took you there what did it what did he write there i mean could he possibly i don't know i'm just surmising okay don't take this literal but you know those men standing there in positions and maybe it was a name bethany and this man right here goes oh bethany how did he know i was having an affair with my secretary and another name amy and another one and one by one you notice what the scripture says from the oldest those in positions of authority elders example starts just working his way down through it i really would honestly like to know exactly what was wrong but i'll tell you what i do know it was personal god is not a god of the of the vague god is not a god of the presume god is a certain god they heard it being convicted by their own conscience right you notice convicted not condemned they oh i hope you catch the saints they were given the opportunity right then to repent condemnation drives away but conviction gives opportunity for repentance and jesus being jesus says i'm going to give you the opportunity they could have fallen oh my brother and sister i hope this is real right there in that moment they're gonna fall out on their knees and said i'll forgive me but instead instead they're like i'm gonna lose my position in the church i'm gonna lose my wife and my children's respect and i'm gonna i'm just gonna walk away i'm gonna act like this never happened i'm gonna act like god never moved through our church i'm gonna act like god never met me in the car on a lonely highway i'm gonna act like god never did these things but you see i just it struck my heart being convicted amen the door is now open for repentance jesus left alone and the woman standing in the midst and when jesus lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those nine accusers saints i want to ask you this morning or put it to you this way if we'll move out of this earthly realm i'm worried about this and i have problems with that and these people are trying to do this to me and that's over there and they don't like me and move out of that move up into heavenly places and you know what living in heavenly places will do for us we'll be able to stand and look around and say where is my accuser amen where is my accuser all i see is the blood of jesus christ i see heavenly places i'm living in the realm with my lord jesus i'm not living down here in the trash and the streets as it were oh my brother and sister i believe there's no greater contrast if i could just share this with you real quick but you go and we we drive down the road and we see mcdonald's sack just throw it out and we see beer balls throw it out right you all seen it but you'll go and you'll see some shift of a culture and countries like chile you'll drive down the road and they'll be trash from the end of this pew to the height of that ceiling thrown up against the walls down the street and maybe i'll just throw this in for some shock factor young girls as young as some of our little sisters here standing on the street and you can guess what their purpose is why because someone listened to the accuser someone took condemnation and did not take conviction and therefore had no repentance and satan multiplies that to generation to generation we ought to be saying thank you lord thank you lord for what you have done in our lives amen we can raise godly children we can see our children grow up to be godly mothers and moving on through the generations as the lord tarries we'll die looking back in our family tree and say thank you lord that we were in that generation you chose we were the chosen people hallelujah see look at this now no man lord jesus said under neither do i that's it what was he doing oh you say you're reading too much into it paul no sir he was cutting condemnation out of her life pulling that out and i believe by revelation because he came to her he didn't call her a wretched woman he didn't he didn't go there but he says over here huh they're convicted and you're not condemned no hallelujah can somebody say thank you lord hallelujah hallelujah oh look my brother and sister amen this bride of this age already found favor with god hallelujah let me just keep going on here real quick uh sister ruth would you just come i've got to call this quit amen revelations 12 8 amen and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world now when you look at that my brother and sister i want you to understand now it says with deceiveth the whole world you realize the scripture says that lest time be shortened there would be no flesh saved this is how per uh persuasive satan is and how weak the human or how frail the human flesh is we rely on our flesh we'll fall satan knows it's only a matter of time he just keeps grinding he keeps grinding i wish i could remember where i found that but brother brown made a statement he says you know the fiery darts he says uh that's why you have to get into an atmosphere so that those darts never get to you amen come on saints can we man up and just hear it straight it's time for us to quit oh i'm preaching to paul in case anybody's wondering i'm preaching to paul oh just this fiery dart oh i'm so low i'm so low i'm not even a christian i'm so low all right come on you got to get out of that because you're this up and you're this down and you're this way and you're that way and god doesn't love me and god loves me so much god doesn't love me god loves me so much come on let's man up and let's get in a position where we have an atmosphere which is the blood of jesus christ and that fiery dart never even gets to you amen hallelujah but look at this now see the whole world is casting the earth and his angels cast out with him now you can look at this and you can say oh my goodness this is terrible for us it's cast into the earth and our loud voice saying where in heaven now it's come salvation you see this whole message this gospel this word of god to you and i was never an earthly gospel it's always been a heavenly gospel so if we live down here and we're burrowing through the trash of laodicea and we're wondering if god really loves us or not life is such a struggle and i don't even know if i'm a christian it's time for you to climb up out of the trash get out of the gutter but god's not going to make you do that you can choose to live in the gutter but god wants you to get up and when you get out of there and you start cutting away the things of this world you start doing this what do you do you rise up in to heavenly places and then you start hearing voices in heaven people are like oh they hear voices that's just too weird no get out of the gutter come on to the naysayer that thinks that some christian stands up and says and god spoke to me oh that's just so what no get out of the gutter i'm not going to come down there so you can maybe somehow see that something's different you get out of the gutter and get up in heavenly places because that's where god's speaking god's not speaking in the gutter as it were my brother and sister he goes to the gutter he redeems out of the gutter he doesn't leave him in the gutter well you know god loves me and if he wanted me out of here he'd take me out of here get out of there come on man up get out of there get up into heavenly places now has come salvation i say amen and strength and i say amen and the kingdom of our god which i'm a part of i say amen and the power of his christ which is in me i say amen for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accuse them before our god day and night amen i just sometimes i can't sleep my mind torments me cast him out amen oh no as long as you're in the oh i hope i don't offend anybody as long as you're in the victim mentality you won't do nothing but complain get up out of that gutter that's right man up stand up and say before the foundation of the world i was in the mind of god i'm written on his hand and i was part of his creation i'm the chosen of people and i refuse satan to give you trespass for your little driveway into my life i'm going to drive the post right now right here right now you can't drive here any longer oh let me finish the story about the driveway the man that was trying to steal the land tells the judge over on this part over here it's too steep and the wintertime i can't make it up the hill don't you just understand we live in laodicea we can dance and drink and smoke and watch all this whatever because we can't live it we can't get to where we want to be so give us permission to live where we can live no sir no sir kick the devil out of there i don't care if the devil starves to death i don't care if the devil finds himself wait he is going to find himself in a pit oh my goodness i can see some of these modern day christians oh devil we're so sorry we were friends for 60 years and it hurts my feelings you're in the pit no sir i'm gonna look at him and say this little man deceived the nations this little man is what i struggled so hard to defeat but i tell you what happened i tell you what happened i got into the word of god and i started looking and i started taking the blood amen and i started speaking that's right what whose testimony well jesus overcome them jesus overcome them jesus overcome them no sir you overcome he overcome them that you could overcome him amen i gotta close okay oh my i asked permission can i take one more quote i promise not to go much further than that lovely service here i suggest that you go listen to it read it you might ask that question has anybody ever asked that question lord how can i overcome i keep seems like i've failed lord how can i overcome the third great assault i like mysteries i present this as a mystery you go find out what the other two great assaults were solve the mystery find out what they are the third great assault satan offered to forfeit this kingdom this is powerful saints satan offered to forfeit this kingdom to him right when he when he was offering after jesus come from the wilderness he did satan said see these kingdoms of the world these are mine i deal with them whatever i want to i'll forfeit them to you and that's the scripture says i'll give this to you i'll give you all of this i'll give it to you see how slippery the devil is i do with them whatever i want to i'll forfeit them to you but remember he was trying to get him to forfeit without the cross give him the whole world the song says take this whole world but give me jesus amen though a man have all wealth and fame i think that's niv man have all wealth and fame but without the person of christ you are nothing forfeited without the cross if he did we'd be lost he could have took the kingdom but he must follow he must come back he was tempted to do it now remember the scripture says tempted of some things no scripture says he was tempted of all things so when you see this knowing what was going to come there was something inside of him was like take the easy way out that was the flesh speaking now if jesus christ could look at his flesh and deny it can't we can't we come to a place that we look at our flesh and say this is not good for me it's not good for me reminds me of brother donnie reagan one time pretty hard words but he's like you people that think you can take that bag of chips in that case of pepsi and sit down in front of your favorite movie and say lord bless this to my body or fooling yourself you are which we you are what you eat [Music] he could have took the kingdom must follow come back he was tempted to do it now death is a hard thing he was tempted to take his liberty and be the king of the earth without the cross but if he did his subjects would have died satan would have gladly made that proposition with him but he said get behind me satan he didn't do it he come and suffered and took the hard rugged round he took the route of persecution he took the route of death hallelujah and we this morning willing to do take that same route that he's taken are we willing to die are we willing to give ourselves up to god forfeit all the world and the things to serve for him see now he failed to do it willingly to forfeit it satan was to him but he didn't do it though jesus was tempted he overcame for us he endured all temptations for me and for you see he could have took it right then but what he did he took the other route for so that we could come be with him and if he paid such a price as that then how little would we be not to take it amen wow to me that was powerful this this was a little off route of what we were thinking today saints but just to look at this my brother and sister he declared us worthy enough he could have just said why should i suffer for them they're all guilty of my word anyhow every one of them think about it on the earth and that day right then my brother's sister everyone on the earth in that day right there was guilty of the word of god in their own merit and flesh would be found guilty but he looked down to the end and said my word says my word says my word says it is written it is written it is written there will be this one there will be that one your family your family your family your family he's like they'll be there they'll believe my word they'll act on my word and they will raise up in that last day as shining as the stars of the heavens giving glory and praise to me oh i'm glad he looked beyond the present circumstance i'm glad he looked beyond that i'm glad he remembered that he had written my name in the palm of his hand he had written my name in that book in his own precious blood and i remember that and said this is what this is what this is what i come for and yet because he took on that vessel of flesh you imagine if it was just as it would be could be and it can't but it would be that god had come down himself the beauty of it changed he took on flesh that your flesh could look at his flesh and say i believe i'm understanding what he felt i believe i understand the sacrifice i believe because i know how i feel every time i want to turn and run brother jason kind of jokingly in the office says about well it's good to have you back and i said yeah jay i don't know sister jerry and i had to pick up we had a credit card we had a bunch of cash we're already on the road i thought about just driving those few extra miles to arizona but you see we can't turn and run we can't turn and run we can't take the easy route we were predestinated to stand as soldiers of the cross to live a life right in satan's throne room and i'm telling you my brother and sister i can name this and i don't want to depress you some of you're looking at me all depressed here i can see it you're about ready to cry maybe you're hungry [Music] drag queens gender dysphoria [Music] insanity we got to take away your guns well why don't they work at getting rid of the devil i'm not talking about politics here sister jerry and i a few years ago in australia i asked one of the brothers there he's kind of anti-gun he was appalled that i had an innumerable amount of guns why do you have those they took our guns away it picked my interest so i'd ask another brother that seemed to be more understanding they took away your guns what happened to your crime oh death by hammer went up 300 percent death by screwdriver went up 250 percent death by strangulation went up so many percent why they didn't get rid of the accuser they're trying to eliminate this and eliminate this and eliminate this saints don't don't let that happen i'm done don't let that happen if i if i you know it'd be like going home today and saying okay to be a better christian i'm going to give up coffee some of you wouldn't make it through the day and it'd either be a hammer a screwdriver or a rope that you would use on someone else no no that's not the problem the problem is the accuser has been allowed to run rampant and he has robbed their sanity he has robbed everything from them and they are bankrupt and they don't know they're so in a delusion they said in this day a strong delusion would come upon the people they're in so delusion we'll take this away and that'll solve it it don't take this away and it'll no no and they're just going and that's why my brother and sister now forgive me but that's why they look silly as they do i was going to use a different stronger word but that's why they look as silly as they do we think what's wrong with this government what's wrong with all of this stuff because they're trying to take carnal things to solve a spiritual problem and it won't work and that's why i felt so strongly on my heart today and i have kept you and i'm not going to apologize it's time for us to make sure the accuser is out of our marriage the accuser is out of our child rearing the accuser is out of our prayer life he's out of our bible reading he's out of our fellowship he's out of our house and when the accuser gets out of your house peace moves in but as long as the accuser has reign then we'll be this is your fault and this is your fault and this is your because we take on the spirit of the accuser and we start to accuse those around us that we love and pretty soon we accuse god and say well god failed me how often do you hear that i've talked to many a young person that has come and by god's grace has come in chile it seemed like there was a season that that was very strong that young men especially there in chile were saying i don't even think there is a god i i don't even see that there's a god but god rich in mercy can someone say that you're rich in mercy come down into that nation come down amongst those young people and bound the accuser and today they have raised up and have beautiful families serving god why because they took it serious and bound the accuser and said i don't care where i've been i don't care what i've done i have been set free and i'm a new creature in christ jesus it's time for us to man up man up and kick that accuser out of our life and out of our church and out of our homes hallelujah let's stand and just worship the lord i'm sorry if i kind of yelled and got a little excited today hallelujah but you know what the accuser's done he can't take it away from you but he can sure cause you to forfeit it convince you to the point you're not worthy to handle it not worthy to receive the benefits of it that's not what my bible says my bible says that this was the free will gift of god to you and i hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah open my eyes brother jay come and help me hallelujah oh hallelujah oh my i don't mean to make light saints but i left the other half of the sermon at home on the desk amen i tell you what i'm just so sick and tired of the devil do you ever have a friend like that now if they're in here in the church today just don't shake your head just stand real calm and look straight ahead but you ever had a friend that just constantly had to give you your opinion well you're you're not successful because of this you didn't do this you're there you're that you know what the devil is i mean i'll use brother david as the example here that the devil's just going to be there all the time looking over consider turn left [Music] slow down speed up [Music] wouldn't that be wild just to do this or do that run over that stop sign that'd be fun [Music] as one brother put it one time he says the devil's the one that caused you to rob the bank and then he went and was the one who called 9-1-1 yeah that's the accuser time time saints to kick the accuser to the curb let him go live in that gutter he thought he created for you let him live there hallelujah let's just worship the lord just a little open the eyes of my [Music] i want [Music] open the eyes upon us i pray lord let us break free i want to see you i want one to live [Music] as we sing holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy [Music] holy holy holy i want to see you let's sing the first verse again open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart now emphasize this i

to go and the man says no i stop right where i'm at and i kick them out of my car saints i want to just encourage you today if the accuser if the accuser has been unruly unruly and won't follow as it were the rules he won't do that don't don't take him home with you dan discuss it with him just stop your car right here right now can we do that can we just stop our car right here this morning and

testament church the word promised there ever was another book of acts it wouldn't be a new book that's right it would be a continuation of the original book of acts god doesn't have any other plan and i say today amen oh can we be bold i remember when i used to would have been just too subdued to even to say this in public i am the new book of acts you are the continuation of the book of acts the same holy ghost that came down in that upper room is coming down in this room and coming into the very temple of the holy ghost which is you hallelujah as i look out across the land see god's my

could preach it to you right now amen brother david don't you say no amens hallelujah now look saints brother andrew is going to be coming this coming weekend friday evening seven o'clock just like it was a youth meeting everyone's invited but brother andrew is going to speak focus towards the young people and i look forward to that because strangely enough in my ideas he's a young person that's scary he's fixing to have a child not him his wife but uh anyway a young man grew up in the message faced the struggles of growing up in church growing up in all of the thing and being a smart young man all these different factors there i believe he has something really good for our young people friday evening seven and then saturday some people say it's too early to be at six o'clock but if you're here at seven and go home at 11 you'll be too tired on sunday to shout lift your hands so six o'clock saturday evening sunday 10 30 regular service with fellowship afterwards okay i just want

so many nuggets you know they say that the preacher often times preaches what's happening in his own life so if it seemed today that i might have been a little rough a little pointed just remember there's three back at me the accuser he don't care how much victory you've had how many prayers have been answered what you've overcome he's still going to show up as it is the cat on the screen door and he's still going to be there because while you were called to do as it were your job he was called to do his job he's pretty faithful at his job but we have overcome by the blood of the lamb and by your testimony of the word of god amen we love you god bless you today amen right [Music] you
