[31:18] [music] the great I am
[31:23] a risen
[31:26] lamb
[31:29] my comforter
[31:33] and
[31:34] King,
[31:36] can we just live a little praise to the
[31:38] Lord this morning? Oh, how we love you,
[31:41] Lord. How gracious you are to us, Lord.
[31:45] Your loving kindness. Oh my. Praise the
[31:48] Lord. Hallelujah.
[31:50] Hallelujah.
[31:52] Amen.
[31:54] Yes. So
[31:56] the uprising in Tanzania, the saints
[31:58] there are sharing that it's just
[32:00] &gt;&gt; [music]
[32:00] &gt;&gt; um so much violence that they can barely
[32:03] even go out in the streets. But yet, you
[32:06] know, the pull of being in the house of
[32:09] God has caused many of the believers to
[32:11] venture out today [music] and to be in
[32:13] the house of God. So let's let's
[32:16] remember them. Amen. And uh as been
[32:20] announced, communion this afternoon at
[32:22] 5. Brother Rich uh sends his warmest
[32:26] greetings from him [music] and his
[32:27] family and the saints in Monmouth just
[32:29] to greet each and every one of you and
[32:32] uh had a wonderful conversation with
[32:34] brother Dwayne Fair [music] and uh he
[32:37] sends greetings from Saskatoon,
[32:38] Saskatchewan.
[32:40] And uh as hard as I I could [music] to
[32:43] to convince him he had to come here. for
[32:47] everything I offered, he seemed to have
[32:48] a something that well, not now.
[32:52] Not now. And I couldn't really push back
[32:56] too hard because I've used that so many
[32:58] times. Not now. But just remember the
[33:02] saints in Monmouth, remember the saints
[33:03] in Saskatoon. and uh just had I don't
[33:07] want to speak out of turn but just had
[33:09] some lovely conversations with uh I
[33:12] don't know depending on how you know
[33:13] them as brother Junior, brother Eagle
[33:18] and uh uh brother Job both of them
[33:21] feeling very much God dealing with them
[33:24] and [snorts] uh they've started a Bible
[33:26] study [music] and uh more and more
[33:28] people are coming. They've got some
[33:30] young people that are are just friends
[33:32] [music] that are coming in and uh
[33:35] interacting with them and uh so we just
[33:39] want to lift them up in prayer. [music]
[33:41] Amen. That uh you know God put something
[33:44] burning in the heart of the youth. Amen.
[33:46] Remember it was the youth that crossed
[33:49] over and possessed the land. Amen. So we
[33:51] want to remember them in prayer. [music]
[33:54] And uh Sister Jerry and I will be
[33:57] leaving in uh a little less than two
[34:00] weeks [music] to go to the Netherlands
[34:02] and to Belgium for meetings there. So we
[34:06] just desire your [music] your prayers.
[34:08] Amen. God bless you, brother. Good to
[34:11] have you with us. Amen. [music] And u
[34:14] each and everyone. There's some young
[34:15] men here that I I you know I had I
[34:18] hadn't seen them in so long. I just was
[34:19] like, who are they? Oh, sorry about
[34:22] that. [music] It's so good to see you
[34:24] guys. Amen. Brother Daniel, God bless
[34:27] you. And [snorts] uh each and every one
[34:28] of you. Uh [music] just happy to see you
[34:31] today. Uh brother Manasse, Sister Katie,
[34:34] good to see you. Amen. [music] Before we
[34:37] go to the word, just turn one another
[34:39] and greet each other. Sister Carrie, I I
[34:41] was one of those uh that was like
[34:43] starting to miss you. Amen. Yeah. I was
[34:47] just like thinking, I'll see her soon.
[34:49] I'll see her soon. God bless you. Amen.
[34:53] Praise the Lord. Yeah. Amen. Now,
[34:59] this is very special to me this morning,
[35:01] saints, because uh what the Lord laid on
[35:03] brother Isaac's heart to sing fits so
[35:06] perfectly with [snorts] what um I'm
[35:09] going to speak today. And the title of
[35:12] my sermon today,
[35:14] if thou canst believe.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Only believe. Amen. And here we
[35:20] are. If thou canst believe. Amen. We
[35:23] want to take this out of Mark the 9th
[35:26] chapter. We are all very familiar with
[35:29] this scripture. Mark 9:16-
[35:32] 24. Uh and uh you know it is there that
[35:37] um I I trust this morning you will
[35:40] understand the way that I desire to
[35:43] bring this to you. uh is that we must
[35:47] sometimes come to the reality that each
[35:49] and every one of us has a circumstance
[35:52] something that arises in our life that
[35:55] just buffets us. We we just feel like we
[35:58] have just been rocked onto our heels and
[36:01] and u it it is not uh well I'll wait
[36:04] I'll just preach the sermon to you
[36:06] instead of preaching it twice. Amen.
[36:08] Amen. Mark 9:16.
[36:11] And he asks the scribes, "What question
[36:14] ye of them?" So when they come back off
[36:16] the mountain, just give context to it.
[36:19] Uh they they see the scribes questioning
[36:22] or contesting with the disciples. And
[36:25] Jesus said, "Ask the scribes, what
[36:27] question ye with them?" And I love how
[36:31] this that God did not let this turn into
[36:33] some theological
[36:35] debate.
[36:37] But one steps out of the crowd. And one
[36:39] of the multitude answered, said, Master,
[36:41] I have brought unto thee my son, which
[36:44] hath a dumb spirit, and wheresoever he
[36:48] taketh him, he teareth him, and he
[36:50] foamth, and nashethth with his teeth,
[36:52] and pineth away, which means to become
[36:55] rigid or or or stiff. And I spake to thy
[36:58] disciples, and that they should cast him
[37:01] out, and they could not. He answered him
[37:04] and said, "Oh faithless generation, how
[37:08] long shall I be with you? How long shall
[37:10] I suffer you? Bring him unto me." And
[37:14] they brought him unto him. And when he
[37:16] saw him, straight away the spirit tear
[37:19] him. Now, isn't this the truth, my
[37:21] brother and sister? Every time God comes
[37:24] and and I just want to speak in a broad
[37:26] context here. Every time God comes and
[37:28] starts to deal with us, the devil shows
[37:30] up and tries to tear up the situation.
[37:33] He does not want you and I to ever get
[37:36] stabilized that this is the word. This
[37:39] is the truth and and we're going to hold
[37:41] on to this and this. No, he always comes
[37:44] throw something out there and it's
[37:46] there. Now, I tell you, this is a lousy
[37:48] analogy, but I thought it was
[37:50] interesting that recently in a police
[37:52] chase, the the police trying to stop
[37:54] this car. And [snorts] uh so they don't
[37:56] want to get run over on the freeway. So,
[37:58] as cars are passing by, they throw the
[38:01] spikes out there for the to try and get
[38:03] that car. They miss that car, but the
[38:05] other seven or eight cars that were
[38:07] going down the freeway innocently all
[38:09] now have flat tires. Now, that's the
[38:11] devil. He is constantly throwing things
[38:14] out in our way, trying to flatten our
[38:16] tires to stop our progress. Amen. So,
[38:20] here's what happened as Jesus starts to
[38:22] deal with this. [snorts] Amen. He throws
[38:25] a fit on this young man to break up the
[38:29] moving of the spirit. Amen. So there
[38:31] away, and they brought him unto him, and
[38:34] when he saw him, straight away the
[38:35] spirit tear him, and he fell to the
[38:37] ground, and wallowed foaming. And he
[38:40] asked [snorts] his father, "How long is
[38:42] it ago since he came upon him?" And he
[38:45] said, "Of a child, and often times has
[38:48] cast him into the fire and into the
[38:50] waters to destroy him. But if thou can't
[38:52] do anything, have compassion on us and
[38:55] help us." Jesus saith unto him, "If thou
[38:59] canst believe,"
[39:01] &gt;&gt; can we say amen to that?
[39:03] &gt;&gt; If thou canst believe, all things are
[39:06] possible to him that believeth. And
[39:09] straightway the father of the child
[39:10] cried out and said with tears, "Oh my,
[39:14] this moves me, saints,"Lord,
[39:17] I believe,
[39:19] &gt;&gt; but help
[39:21] &gt;&gt; my unbelief."
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, we ask for your blessings
[39:25] upon the reading of the word. Lord, this
[39:28] time, this thought that you have laid
[39:29] upon my heart, Lord, help me to express
[39:31] it. Touch the saints, bless the saints
[39:34] today, Lord, lead us and guide us. We
[39:36] ask in your precious name. Amen. You may
[39:39] be seated. Amen. Though, as we look at
[39:42] this story, it is with much interest
[39:46] that I see this this story, how that it
[39:50] comes to pass and how that uh God coming
[39:53] here knowing exactly what this situation
[39:56] is. And you know what caught me? I'll
[39:59] just give a moment of explanation. Uh I
[40:02] was reading a scripture the other day
[40:05] and I was found it remarkable uh of how
[40:08] many scriptures there are. Something
[40:10] like for over 1,400 times in the
[40:13] scripture the word if is used. Now, not
[40:16] all in the same context, but would you
[40:19] look at that, my brother and sister? The
[40:21] word if signifies a condition in a
[40:24] sentence, often linking a human action
[40:30] or state to a divine promise. So, we see
[40:34] all through the scriptures if if if and
[40:39] behind that is if you can believe, amen,
[40:42] all things are possible. If you can take
[40:44] these things and and look, I encourage
[40:47] you, go look it up. It's a very
[40:48] interesting study, when you realize that
[40:52] this is in a context that God is then
[40:54] saying, if you will stand for the word,
[40:57] I'll bless you, Israel. If you'll be
[41:00] faithful to me, I'll bless you as a
[41:02] nation. Now, not all those were
[41:04] believers in there, but because Israel
[41:06] stood for the word, he blessed the
[41:07] nation. And you see we stand here today
[41:10] and we'll look at this and I I just want
[41:13] you to see the condition in your own
[41:15] life that if we will believe if we will
[41:18] stand on the word if we can uh be remain
[41:21] hot. Now look at this. Oh I didn't see
[41:23] brother Gideon and sister Lily. God
[41:25] bless you. Trust that sister Lily's
[41:27] feeling better. Been praying for you.
[41:29] Amen. But look at this how that this is
[41:32] taking place because God is puts many
[41:36] promises in a conditional basis. And so
[41:38] when we enter into the promise and we we
[41:42] act upon that God comes. Now I I think
[41:45] it's so powerful how that he said if
[41:49] thou can't believe.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now my brother and sister, we're
[41:53] preaching to believers today. We're
[41:56] preaching to the bride of Jesus Christ
[41:57] today. God placed something in you. Not
[42:00] not of your own mind, not of your own
[42:02] will, not of your own nobility, but he
[42:04] placed something in you that you can
[42:07] believe. Amen. And so, it's not a matter
[42:09] of if we can, but it's us getting all of
[42:12] the distraction out of our life, getting
[42:15] all of the litter, the clutter, all of
[42:17] the noise, and just simply come to the
[42:20] place we believe. Amen. There's so much
[42:22] distraction in the day that we live in,
[42:24] my brother and sister. It is a time that
[42:27] we live. They did some recent studies.
[42:29] Uh when I say recent, that's within, you
[42:32] know, a reasonable time. I don't
[42:33] remember the date, but here is here is a
[42:36] uh they did these studies and and young
[42:38] people uh have such a tremendous amount
[42:42] of time and they kind of lump things
[42:44] together how they're caught up in
[42:46] electronics. So whether it's television,
[42:48] their phones, and whatever. And so
[42:50] what's happening is they're they're
[42:53] pulling them from a reality to something
[42:56] that's there. You know, I always thought
[42:57] it was interesting many many years ago
[43:00] when the soap opera first appeared on
[43:02] television. They actually come to the
[43:04] conclusion that people were addicted to
[43:06] them. Amen. And I knew people grown men
[43:09] that actually would leave the farmwork
[43:12] for an hour to go watch as the world
[43:14] turns.
[43:16] Well, all you got to do is get up in the
[43:17] morning when the sun is rising, walk out
[43:20] your door and look around you, and you
[43:22] will see the world turning. Amen. But if
[43:25] you don't see God in the world turning,
[43:27] then you're seeing a soap opera. And
[43:30] Satan would desire for us to live in a
[43:33] sort of a fantasy realm of what it is.
[43:35] And the fantasy realm come down into the
[43:38] church and left people where they could
[43:41] claim to be a Christian. They could
[43:43] stand on these things. They can quote
[43:45] scripture, but my brother and sister,
[43:46] they're literally living in a fantasy
[43:49] world. And even in this stage right now,
[43:51] people are starting to discover that uh
[43:54] there's there's a dysfunction or
[43:56] disconnect that many people are adopting
[43:58] the name Christian but not changing
[44:01] their lifestyle. Now my brother and
[44:02] sister, we cannot be a Christian without
[44:05] our lifestyle changing. If there is no
[44:08] change in our life, Amen. We have not
[44:11] had a true experience. Amen. You can
[44:15] have a form of godliness, but deny the
[44:17] power thereof, but we're here for the
[44:19] power of God to move in our life. Can we
[44:21] say amen to that? We want the power of
[44:24] God to change us. Now, change can be
[44:27] painful. Amen. Change can be disruptive.
[44:30] P, you know, there's a pain that comes
[44:32] when your life cycle as it is is changed
[44:36] around you and you must adapt to that.
[44:38] Amen. I heard one time a man made a
[44:41] quotation. He says, "Oh, being a
[44:43] Christian is like going to prison."
[44:44] Well, I'll tell you what. The Apostle
[44:46] Paul went to prison and was still a
[44:48] Christian. Amen. He didn't feel bound
[44:50] when he was in there. God used that time
[44:52] to speak to him. And so, if people have
[44:55] the idea that being a Christian is like
[44:57] going to prison, my brother and sister,
[44:59] they'll never go.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; They'll never be a part of that.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; So, you look at this. Amen. I say the
[45:07] same action is required today as Jesus
[45:10] spoke to this father about his
[45:13] situation. Amen. He says if thou can't
[45:16] believe that is the same thing is
[45:19] required today. We cannot sit here now
[45:22] if you don't mind me speaking a little
[45:23] direct this morning. You can quote the
[45:25] prophet all you want. You can just talk
[45:28] about how the message is so important to
[45:31] you. But if it doesn't have any effect,
[45:34] then we are just simply quoting. And
[45:36] anyone can say they are anything. Look
[45:39] at it today, my brother and sister. The
[45:41] boys are saying they're girls and the
[45:42] girls are saying the boys and schools
[45:44] are changing and literally creating
[45:47] rooms so kids can say that they are an
[45:49] animal. My brother and sister, well,
[45:51] that's a nature that is uh coming down
[45:54] upon the people that an anointing is
[45:56] coming there and they're going back to
[45:58] that old beast nature. And you're just
[46:00] seeing the little surface of it when a
[46:01] kid says he's an animal. Amen. That's
[46:04] just Satan just presenting a picture
[46:06] that's just there and it's so cute. Oh,
[46:09] my child thinks she's a cat. Oh, my kid
[46:12] thinks he's a dog. Oh, my kid thinks
[46:14] he's a horse. My brother and sister,
[46:16] it's a changing of a nature. It's a
[46:18] changing of an attitude, a spirit that's
[46:21] coming in. And that's just opening a
[46:23] door. Amen. Look how many times the
[46:25] prophet of God talks about how Satan
[46:28] likes to just open a door. And it may be
[46:30] years before he actually comes and
[46:32] anoints that, but he's got the door
[46:34] open. My brother and sister, you might
[46:36] as well leave your house unlocked and
[46:38] put a sign on the street. Please rob me.
[46:40] Amen. But that's what Satan's doing.
[46:42] When he can come, when he desires, he
[46:44] will come at the most inopportune time
[46:47] for your life.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; But the door is open.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; He's got access. And who gave it to him?
[46:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Do we know who gave him the access?
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not serving God because of my
[47:03] pastor today. Your pastor didn't give
[47:05] access for the Satan to torment you.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; You had to unlock that door.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And vice versa. Amen. pastors that
[47:12] say, "I'm going to quit the message
[47:14] because of the people." My brother and
[47:16] sister, they've left a door open
[47:17] somewhere because the people will never
[47:20] push or draw or interfere in the life of
[47:23] a real believer. People can't do that.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; When the Holy Ghost guarding the door,
[47:28] people and spirits cannot get past that
[47:31] to cause that disruption. So, what
[47:33] happens is if we're not careful, we are
[47:35] just like this man here. And we come to
[47:37] a place that we know it's the truth. But
[47:40] you see, I I hope this isn't too big a
[47:43] step, but this is here because I'm
[47:46] bringing it down. I'm not preaching a
[47:47] historical message this morning. I'm
[47:49] preaching to saints as sons and
[47:50] daughters of God here this morning. So,
[47:53] don't let this be too big a step for
[47:54] you. But you know what? We need to come
[47:57] and we need to to
[48:00] admit, we need to come to a place that
[48:03] we would admit that at times it's hard
[48:06] to believe. Amen.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Now, if it seems like I'm backing up
[48:11] from what we believe, no, don't
[48:13] misunderstand me. It's not that it's
[48:16] hard to believe the Bible.
[48:18] It's not hard to believe the message,
[48:21] &gt;&gt; although some struggle with these
[48:23] things, but of little things.
[48:27] Why would God let this circumstance come
[48:29] into my life? Why would I be facing this
[48:32] challenge at this time?
[48:35] Why would God allow this? if God really
[48:37] loved me. And I used to think this was a
[48:40] young people's thing that they would
[48:42] come in a point in their life, you know,
[48:44] they're they're they're starting to
[48:45] establish themselves and and they're
[48:47] starting to, you know, kind of set their
[48:49] own boundaries and and be like, well, if
[48:51] God really loved me, but my brother and
[48:53] sister, we're starting to encounter
[48:54] people 40, 50, 60 years old that have
[48:58] not come to this solid conclusion of who
[49:00] they are in Jesus Christ. and they're
[49:02] wavering, being pushed around by spirits
[49:05] of the day and and the distractions of
[49:07] the day. And you know, I've spoke on
[49:09] this before. It's not always a blessing
[49:12] when God gives you a promotion. It's not
[49:14] always a blessing when you meet a new
[49:16] friend that just seems to click with
[49:18] you. It's not always a blessing when we
[49:20] come into these circumstances. We have
[49:22] to be here to judge the circumstance by
[49:26] the word. [snorts]
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I tell you, there's many a
[49:29] friend that has led a young man or young
[49:32] woman astray because they thought they
[49:34] were so and they convinced them. I could
[49:36] name names and you would recognize some
[49:38] of them. Amen. But my brother and
[49:40] sister, it's not about the individual,
[49:42] but it's about a spirit of the age and
[49:44] how it would come. So there's times that
[49:46] we just find. Let's be honest with
[49:48] ourselves. There's times it's hard to
[49:50] believe where we're at. One of the young
[49:52] young people's challenge of this day is
[49:55] that they can recognize that they are
[49:57] sons and daughters of God.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; There's there's a challenge because the
[50:01] world's so beautiful out here. There is
[50:03] so much that's being offered and it
[50:05] comes so easy and it seems so free. But
[50:08] my brother and sister, the real truth of
[50:10] it is there behind the scene that you
[50:12] don't see is a spiritual warfare for
[50:15] your soul. Amen. Satan wants to. And
[50:18] that's why the scripture says, "Train up
[50:20] a child." No, that's not training them
[50:22] to quote scripture and quote quotes and
[50:24] dress just right, but train them up in
[50:27] the realm that they know that God is God
[50:30] and they are sons and daughters of God.
[50:33] And in that being established in a young
[50:35] age, they will be able to hold on to
[50:37] that as they progress in their life.
[50:40] Now, that doesn't mean that sitting in
[50:42] the house of God in the in the pew will
[50:45] not [snorts] come a time that they won't
[50:47] have questions and they won't be shaken
[50:49] to their very roots of of what is going
[50:51] on in their life. But my brother and
[50:53] sister, sometimes circumstance, anybody
[50:56] ever run into a circumstance that really
[50:58] shook you.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll lift my hand for you. You all
[51:01] are just kind of tame this morning.
[51:03] Amen. Amen. Every one of you will face a
[51:06] circumstance because the word says you
[51:08] should rejoice when you come into fiery
[51:11] trials. Amen. When you come into that,
[51:13] so there's not going to be a time that
[51:14] you get to pass through without facing a
[51:17] fiery trial or a proving ground. But God
[51:20] bringing you to this place that he says,
[51:22] you know what? No matter what the
[51:24] circumstance,
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter what the circumstance,
[51:28] &gt;&gt; that's right,
[51:30] &gt;&gt; you're going to still believe.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; That's what God is doing. That's right.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; But we have to understand this human
[51:36] element. And I hope you're following me
[51:38] this morning. In this human element, we
[51:41] have times that we struggle with certain
[51:44] things in our life. Maybe it's a little
[51:46] habit. Maybe it's a little just a little
[51:48] seemingly almost nothing circumstance,
[51:50] but yet it has an influence. Little
[51:53] things, circumstances.
[51:56] I say this morning, the Lord just really
[51:58] dealt with me as I was studying this
[52:00] out. Amen. I think it's time to be
[52:03] loosed of the things which hinder us and
[52:05] a time for us to stand up and declare,
[52:08] "Lord, I believe.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Help my unbelief."
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever would come that would be
[52:14] my distraction, be my thing. But help
[52:16] me, Lord, cuz I do believe this word. I
[52:19] believe you're a risen savior. I believe
[52:21] you are the lamb of God. I believe all
[52:24] of these things. I believe your word is
[52:26] coming to pass. But there's times that I
[52:28] get in the way and Satan bombards me and
[52:30] I leave the door open just enough.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; See, the disciples had just been up.
[52:39] If you don't mind, I just feel a little
[52:41] dry here. If you don't mind me,
[52:49] excuse me. The disciples have just seen
[52:53] a supernatural event take place. They've
[52:55] been up on the mountain. They've watched
[52:56] Jesus and they've got to see Elijah and
[52:59] Moses and the whole conversation. Their
[53:01] conclusion is we need to build three
[53:02] temples. Amen. But my brother and
[53:05] sister, it's there that as this
[53:08] supernatural event takes place, just
[53:10] like I've already shared with you, as
[53:12] they come down the mountain, the scribes
[53:14] are there to argue the scripture with
[53:16] him. And so this supernatural event,
[53:19] which they did not totally understand,
[53:21] is now diverted away. And now they're in
[53:24] an argument. Is the message true or not?
[53:26] Amen. That's what that's what the
[53:28] argument of our day is. Right? There's a
[53:30] lot of voices out there that says it's
[53:32] not even true. It's false. It's empty.
[53:34] Well, I'm here to stand. Amen. At 63
[53:37] years old and God dealing with me my
[53:39] whole life, even when I wasn't serving
[53:41] him, I can stand here and I don't know
[53:43] that I really qualify in your mind as a
[53:45] witness. But I can witness, my brother
[53:47] and sister, that God has been faithful
[53:50] to me all the days of my life. Even when
[53:53] I didn't serve him, even when I was
[53:55] distracted, even when these things come,
[53:58] he's healed my body. He's delivered me
[54:00] from my circumstances. He's kept me from
[54:02] the threshold of death.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll tell you what, my brothers and
[54:06] sisters, you don't really know who I am.
[54:08] I'm sorry to tell you that here was a
[54:10] young man that got so wild in his
[54:12] teenage years. We used to take me and
[54:14] several several guys, some had pickups,
[54:17] some had sports cars and what and we
[54:19] used to see how fast we could drive up
[54:20] the road to Bogus Basin. And there was a
[54:23] time in my life because I was going to
[54:25] catch the car in front of me that I
[54:27] rounded a corner there and lost traction
[54:29] and went all the way over to the edge
[54:32] where the rear tires were over the edge
[54:35] spinning gravel and then I'm on the road
[54:38] again. Now, there's people died on that
[54:41] curve, my brother and sister. This is
[54:43] not just some random thing. There's no
[54:44] guard rail and it's not a random thing.
[54:47] And it got a hold of me for a little
[54:49] bit.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; But I didn't really give God liberty to
[54:53] do that. But I'll tell you what it did
[54:55] do. It anchored itself in the back of my
[54:58] mind in my life that I probably should
[55:00] be dead.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; But by the grace of God.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you come down the road and
[55:07] there's times that pass by and days that
[55:10] pass by, weeks, months, years, and you
[55:12] come, but God anchored that to show me
[55:15] that I should be dead, but he lives in
[55:19] me and he wasn't finished with the work.
[55:22] Now my brother and sister, that kind of
[55:24] thing is very personal. It might not
[55:25] affect you like it affects me, but I
[55:27] tell you, I get emotional thinking about
[55:29] it even to this day to know that I come
[55:32] within that whisker of death. And it is
[55:35] a long ways. I could drive you right up
[55:36] and show you the corner. It's a very,
[55:38] very long ways down to the bottom of
[55:41] that ravine. And it's there that God
[55:44] come and he said, "I'm not going to let
[55:45] you even wreck. I'm going to save you
[55:47] before your life crashes."
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Can someone relate to that?
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; So,
[55:56] we're moving along here and the
[55:58] disciples have seen this supernatural
[56:00] event and out of the crowd, we're not
[56:02] going to even deal with the argument.
[56:03] We're dealing with life here, not those
[56:05] naysayers that are coming and saying,
[56:08] you know, the message is not true. We
[56:10] have this discrepancy. We have that
[56:11] discrepancy. Well, let me just throw one
[56:13] last little thing out. I believe every
[56:15] human and especially everyone right
[56:17] here, but everyone around it, if we
[56:19] followed you every day and recorded your
[56:22] public words, we would find discrepancy.
[56:25] [snorts] But those that are perfect,
[56:27] Amen, they want to be the critic. Well,
[56:30] they're perfect in their own mind. But
[56:32] you see, God has allowed our human
[56:36] element
[56:37] &gt;&gt; to still be here.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses was without a doubt God's
[56:43] prophet. Had a human element. And we
[56:45] come right down through the ages. I can
[56:47] assure you, the Apostle Paul, Amen, as
[56:50] God's apostle establishing the word had
[56:52] a human element that if you wanted to be
[56:55] critical, you would find it. But you
[56:57] see, God's not dealing on the human
[56:59] side. So, I don't know why I'm saying
[57:01] this, but I just want to assert this.
[57:03] You can look at Brother Brandham's life
[57:05] and you can find things wrong with him.
[57:08] But my brother and sister, the God who
[57:10] is speaking through him has no fault, no
[57:13] failure, no shortcoming. So, we're not
[57:16] looking at the man, we're looking at the
[57:18] God. Amen. And so, as we look at the
[57:20] God, I want to ask you, has God ever
[57:22] failed you?
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Can God fail you? [snorts]
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Absolutely not.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it's there. You see, the
[57:30] distraction is to get your eyes to the
[57:32] man. Now, let me just continue this
[57:34] thought for just a moment. We can sit
[57:36] right here in church. Amen. And we can
[57:38] look around us and and I hope this
[57:41] spirit isn't here, but we can look
[57:42] around us and we can find fault.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; With those in the church,
[57:48] &gt;&gt; somebody [snorts] ought to be able to
[57:49] lift a hand and say, "Amen." Yes, we can
[57:51] find fault. We'll start with you,
[57:53] Brother Paul.
[57:56] But from the oldest to the youngest, we
[57:58] can find that fault. And if we're
[58:00] looking for the fault, we'll find the
[58:02] fault. If you're looking for sons and
[58:04] daughters of God filled with the Holy
[58:06] Ghost, you are going to see sons and
[58:08] daughters of God filled with the Holy
[58:10] Ghost. Amen. And if you look for the
[58:12] word fulfilled, you will see the word
[58:14] fulfilled. If you're looking for lives
[58:16] that are changed, you will see lives
[58:18] being changed. If you're looking for the
[58:20] right thing, you will find it. But if
[58:22] you're looking to the negative, you will
[58:24] find it.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; So it really doesn't come down to who's
[58:27] this and who's that and who did what.
[58:30] It's coming down to what you choose to
[58:32] focus on.
[58:36] [snorts]
[58:38] &gt;&gt; This man brings his son and the truth is
[58:41] uh he's vexed with the devil.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; But don't I love this. Do you see Jesus
[58:48] rebuke the man? Now, see, this is why I
[58:51] brought up how you view it.
[58:54] If thou can't believe,
[58:56] &gt;&gt; some would take it as a rebuke.
[58:59] He called me a buzzard.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. He called me an eagle.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. It all depends on who you take it.
[59:06] It says, "If thou can't believe,
[59:08] &gt;&gt; implying that he's not believing, but in
[59:11] such a way, the man receives that it
[59:14] discerns his heart."
[59:17] Let me say he's sitting here this
[59:18] morning.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; He's sitting here this morning. Don't
[59:21] look it as some historical thing. He's
[59:24] sitting here this morning.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Lord Jesus coming down
[59:29] discerning the heart. Now, this father
[59:32] receives this. He doesn't say, "Well, if
[59:34] he's going to look at me like an
[59:35] unbeliever, I'm out of here." No, he
[59:37] looks at that and says, "I am a
[59:39] believer.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; I believe."
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, help my unbelief. Amen.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Because every one of us is impacted by
[59:47] the spirits of the age.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; It's there. It's real. Now look, my
[59:53] brother and sister is the father. No
[59:57] doubt
[59:58] as Jesus is discerning this spirit, his
[1:00:02] his inner spirit. No doubt he's
[1:00:05] discouraged from years. His son from a
[1:00:08] child has been afflicted with this with
[1:00:11] this affliction. And no doubt he he's a
[1:00:15] little discouraged about that, you know,
[1:00:17] wondering is God really a healer. Amen.
[1:00:20] But Jesus doesn't rebuke him. Aren't you
[1:00:23] glad? Amen. I preach this about being
[1:00:27] built up. This is what God's doing. He's
[1:00:29] starting on a foundation. He's building
[1:00:31] us up. My brother and sister, when we
[1:00:33] make a mistake, Amen. God might tell you
[1:00:36] to to, you know, take a sawsaw and start
[1:00:39] cutting the studs out because you didn't
[1:00:41] frame them in the right pattern. They
[1:00:43] need to be different. He might cause you
[1:00:45] to have to go backwards in your life for
[1:00:47] a little bit so you can deal with issues
[1:00:49] that you skipped over because they were
[1:00:51] painful.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; But God will take you back to that place
[1:00:55] and he will build you back up. So here
[1:00:57] is this here is this father, amen, in
[1:01:00] this discouragement. And so Jesus
[1:01:03] doesn't rebuke him, but what he does do
[1:01:06] is he starts removing the barriers in
[1:01:09] this father's life. So there's a little
[1:01:12] hesitancy in his life about his son's
[1:01:14] healing.
[1:01:16] This is a little question mark in his
[1:01:19] life.
[1:01:21] Why, Lord? Come on, saints. You know
[1:01:24] what I'm talking about.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Why, Lord?
[1:01:29] Why are my children not serving God?
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Why is a husband or a wife or someone
[1:01:34] very dear to us? Why why are they not
[1:01:37] overcoming?
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Why, Lord? But you see what Jesus does
[1:01:42] is he doesn't come and rebuke him. He
[1:01:45] starts to remove the barrier.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Now, feel free to speak out if you'd
[1:01:52] like to. What was the moment
[1:01:55] of him removing that barrier in his
[1:01:58] life? Was it the fact that he was in the
[1:02:00] presence of Jesus Christ?
[1:02:04] Many people were in his presence,
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; That didn't remove the barrier.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Just like Acts 2:38,
[1:02:14] what starts it? Our confession,
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; repent. The father then says,"Lord, I
[1:02:21] believe." So he's declaring his heart,
[1:02:24] "I believe."
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; And then his confession is, "Lord, help
[1:02:30] my unbelief."
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; So the man lost all of his pious
[1:02:36] approach,
[1:02:38] all of his sanctimonious,
[1:02:40] righteous, self-righteousness, and he
[1:02:42] just admits right out in public. That's
[1:02:44] not a private conversation. and admits
[1:02:46] in public, Lord, help my unbelief. Amen.
[1:02:50] Who would like to be that person this
[1:02:52] morning? Father, Lord, I am a believer.
[1:02:55] I believe this word, but Lord, help my
[1:02:59] unbelief.
[1:03:01] Help me what hinders me from moving
[1:03:03] forward. Help me to deal with the
[1:03:06] things, Father, that seem to so easily
[1:03:08] beset me. Amen. Help me with this
[1:03:11] things, Father. little to besetting sin.
[1:03:14] A little attitude, a little spirit, a
[1:03:16] little bit of pride, a little bit of
[1:03:17] whatever it might be. Maybe a little
[1:03:19] resentment from something that happened
[1:03:22] years ago.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; See, the devil's here even in the
[1:03:35] microphone today.
[1:03:38] So, what does he do instead? He removes
[1:03:40] the barrier by the word.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; He doesn't remove it by chastising him.
[1:03:46] He gives him the word. And because he
[1:03:49] had a seed in him, he recognized the
[1:03:52] truth of the word and received it on
[1:03:55] good ground. He took that word and took
[1:03:58] it in and said, "Lord, I I believe, but
[1:04:01] I recognize there's things in my life
[1:04:04] that I'm not holding to." Amen. If I can
[1:04:07] be so blunt this morning. Our Lord Jesus
[1:04:10] Christ said in Mark that he healed you.
[1:04:13] Amen. What is it Satan coming to do? We
[1:04:16] get prayed for. We come, oh man, I
[1:04:18] thought I was healed. But my brother and
[1:04:20] sister, just as the story goes, that man
[1:04:22] comes back to brother Brandham and he
[1:04:24] says, you know, brother Brandham, you
[1:04:26] said I was healed. Brother Brandham
[1:04:27] doesn't coddle him. He says, you said
[1:04:30] you believed.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what is hindering you? Because
[1:04:34] the symptom didn't disappear according
[1:04:37] to your plan. your agenda, your desire,
[1:04:41] but God says, "I healed you. Now, it's
[1:04:43] up to you to believe you're healed in
[1:04:46] the name of Jesus Christ." Amen. And
[1:04:48] many things that we want out of our
[1:04:50] lives. Amen. We could go through it.
[1:04:52] I'll just throw a blanket out there.
[1:04:53] Don't take it personal. The lust of the
[1:04:56] flesh, the pride of life, all of these
[1:04:58] things. And if we don't deal with them,
[1:05:01] you can hear all the word that you can
[1:05:03] hear. You can hear the word seven days a
[1:05:06] week constantly. And if those things are
[1:05:08] still there, that is unbelief manifested
[1:05:11] to hinder you. God, help us.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; God, help us to acknowledge, I believe,
[1:05:16] Lord, help my unbelief. Help me deal
[1:05:20] with what is hindering my life.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; So Jesus just starts removing barrier.
[1:05:28] We see the father's response. Amen.
[1:05:30] [snorts]
[1:05:31] The word reached the right place in his
[1:05:33] life. It touched him in the right place.
[1:05:36] And he right there in public just says,
[1:05:38] "Lord, help my unbelief. I I'm an
[1:05:41] unbeliever." Isn't this the paradox,
[1:05:43] right? Amen. A little bit of the
[1:05:46] foundation of a two soul doctrine, you
[1:05:48] know? [snorts] Oh, when I would do good,
[1:05:49] that's when I'm in the Lord. But I'm
[1:05:50] over here in the flesh and my flesh gets
[1:05:52] to do this. Well, I'll tell you what,
[1:05:54] the flesh will obey the truth that's in
[1:05:57] you.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to make an excuse. I
[1:06:01] I I wrote a note this morning connected
[1:06:03] to this and I don't know when it'll
[1:06:05] happen, but you know what? Time to set
[1:06:07] aside our excuses.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; You give an excuse for why you behave or
[1:06:12] why this affected you or why what's
[1:06:14] going on. It's time for us to set aside
[1:06:18] our excuses. We have a pure word in this
[1:06:20] hour. We got a word that delivers. We
[1:06:22] got a word that heals. We got a word
[1:06:24] that sets people free. Amen. We don't
[1:06:27] need an excuse. We need the word. and
[1:06:29] give liberty to the word to change our
[1:06:31] lives.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; So the word reaches the right place.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; And his first declaration is I love the
[1:06:38] order of this. God sets things in order.
[1:06:40] He doesn't say, "Well, I'm a believer,
[1:06:42] but I'm believing."
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; No, he says, "I am a believer."
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; I am a believer. That's the first place
[1:06:50] in my life. I am a believer.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; I'm not focusing on my unbelief. Oh, I
[1:06:55] might have sinned. I might have done
[1:06:57] something, you know. I might have
[1:06:58] yesterday or the day before or a week
[1:07:00] before done something that would not be
[1:07:02] pleasing in the eyes of the Lord. But
[1:07:04] that's not the first and foremost
[1:07:06] thought on his mind. What's on his mind
[1:07:08] is I'm a believer.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; But I have some unbelief still residing
[1:07:15] in me.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Cleanse me, oh Lord,
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; and I will be clean.
[1:07:25] Wash me and I will
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; be washed.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; You see my brother and sister,
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; what's the first and foremost in your
[1:07:35] vocabulary?
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah, don't be reading my notes.
[1:07:49] [snorts] I'm just kidding, Brother
[1:07:50] David. Yeah.
[1:07:53] So the word loosing
[1:07:55] the barriers,
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; I could have took your comment and put
[1:07:59] it right there, brother David. In fact,
[1:08:01] I have a gap right there in my notes.
[1:08:03] [snorts] You see, it's the word that
[1:08:05] loosed the barriers. It wasn't the fact
[1:08:08] Oh, I hope you get this. This will toss
[1:08:10] some of you. Wasn't the fact that Jesus
[1:08:13] said it.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; It was the fact that it was the father
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; that said it.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. that I hope that didn't
[1:08:22] toss any of you.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus was the father made flesh.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; But he stood there
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; also as a man.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; And that's the side I brought right
[1:08:36] there. See? So you could say, well,
[1:08:38] brother Brandham said this. How many
[1:08:40] people did brother Brandham talk to that
[1:08:42] went right out in their life, never
[1:08:44] changed, never got better?
[1:08:50] You know, my brother and sister, well,
[1:08:52] he prayed for me and I didn't feel a
[1:08:54] thing.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; The word never said feel it.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; No, I didn't.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; The word says believe it.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the word also says that your
[1:09:02] body will obey your confession.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; So, there's a sign that you actually
[1:09:08] believe. You start to confess and it
[1:09:11] starts to come out of your mouth. Amen.
[1:09:14] I'm healed. People might say, "You're
[1:09:15] sicker than you ever was." Why are you
[1:09:18] saying you're healed? I'm saying I'm
[1:09:20] healed because this says I'm healed. And
[1:09:23] this is the Lord Jesus Christ in print.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; So therefore, I am healed.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. The body, it might be the body. It
[1:09:32] might have its issues, but the soul says
[1:09:34] amen to every word of God.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now look at this here in the
[1:09:40] sermon inspiration. Amen. I think we
[1:09:42] have this. Yes. [snorts]
[1:09:44] So there you are. You have to cross
[1:09:46] through every barrier and burn every
[1:09:49] fence behind you to get to Christ.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Can we erase the word every and that
[1:09:57] still mean the same thing?
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Every means absolute.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Every. Yeah.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; So, we can't be partway there and say,
[1:10:12] "Well, I I I I
[1:10:14] went to church.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; I believe Jesus Christ is the son of
[1:10:19] God." No. Every word. You need every
[1:10:22] word.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; And the word will go through every
[1:10:27] barrier and will burn every fence. No
[1:10:30] matter what the world says, what the
[1:10:31] church says, what the people says, it's
[1:10:33] what Jesus said that counts. Amen.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; I stand here this morning, my brother
[1:10:38] and sister, more than one ailment in
[1:10:40] this whole body.
[1:10:42] And yet, I believe I'm healed in the
[1:10:45] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; It is my daily confession. I do not like
[1:10:50] to even talk about it because what this
[1:10:52] body testifies and what my soul
[1:10:55] testifies have a conflict.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm going to stand with what
[1:11:00] God laid in my heart. Amen. what he said
[1:11:02] by the word. I'm going to stand on that
[1:11:04] that I am healed in the name of Jesus
[1:11:06] Christ.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you, you know, we become so
[1:11:10] dependent on things around us. Amen.
[1:11:13] That uh they become almost like a
[1:11:15] crutch.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, I went to church and the
[1:11:18] pastor preached on healing, but my
[1:11:20] doctor says,
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; "Well, as long as your doctor is Dr.
[1:11:24] Jesus, amen, that'll be okay. But
[1:11:27] otherwise, you ought to just cut off
[1:11:29] that conversation and say, "The word
[1:11:31] says, "I'm healed."
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So there [snorts] you are. You got
[1:11:36] to cross through every barrier and burn
[1:11:38] every fence behind you to get to Christ.
[1:11:40] [snorts] Now, sometimes the barriers are
[1:11:42] big.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; How many of you have ever looked at your
[1:11:45] life and said, "My problems are so
[1:11:47] little."
[1:11:50] Everyone's problem is big to them.
[1:11:53] Everyone's problem is is an issue to
[1:11:56] them.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:01] And sometimes the barriers are so small
[1:12:03] you have glossed over that.
[1:12:09] But I tell you those little issues have
[1:12:12] the strangest ability to come to the
[1:12:15] surface at just a certain time.
[1:12:21] What didn't bother you, so to speak,
[1:12:22] last month, 6 months ago, will be
[1:12:25] tormenting you today.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; What do you think's behind pushing that?
[1:12:31] Something that was insignificant has now
[1:12:33] become insurmountable.
[1:12:35] Amen. My brother and sister, that is not
[1:12:38] the Holy Spirit.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's Satan pushing the button to
[1:12:42] cause a disruption, to cause people to
[1:12:45] get unfocused, unhinged or where God's
[1:12:48] trying to take them and turn our
[1:12:50] attention.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; I come across this many years ago in in
[1:12:57] my trucking days, people [clears throat]
[1:12:59] in an accident
[1:13:02] and you witness it, you feel obligated
[1:13:04] to stop.
[1:13:06] And their reasoning to the patrolman of
[1:13:11] how they tailed the car in front of them
[1:13:13] is that they were looking at the car
[1:13:15] that had tail ended the car beside them.
[1:13:20] That had nothing to do with them. If
[1:13:22] they'd have kept their eyes on what was
[1:13:24] in front of them, they would have said,
[1:13:26] "Oh my, those people just had an
[1:13:28] accident." And they would have went on.
[1:13:30] but instead they were looking at what
[1:13:32] was going on around them and totally
[1:13:35] totally missed it and now they're in
[1:13:38] their own circumstance. My brother and
[1:13:40] sister, poor analogy, but I think you
[1:13:41] get it. Amen. We're not called to look
[1:13:44] at what's going on, Mr. Trump.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let's sit down for a moment.
[1:13:48] Amen. Do we got 30, 45 minutes or 30 or
[1:13:51] 45 days?
[1:13:55] All I know is according to the word in
[1:13:58] the end time
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; there'll be wars and rumors of wars.
[1:14:01] There'll be all these circumstances the
[1:14:03] scripture has declared the prophet
[1:14:05] brought clarity into these things. I
[1:14:07] don't need to drill down on that. What I
[1:14:09] need to do is keep watching what is in
[1:14:11] front of me. I need to keep walking
[1:14:14] looking at Christ uh moving forward. I
[1:14:17] need to just uh come and make my calling
[1:14:19] and election sure. Amen. make sure I was
[1:14:22] just I I'll just be boastful. This will
[1:14:24] sound bad, but I was just in the back
[1:14:26] room praying before we come out today.
[1:14:29] Lord, let our young people especially,
[1:14:31] but every one of you, let you be
[1:14:33] searching for oil. Not for wealth, not
[1:14:36] for fame, not for this or for that, but
[1:14:38] be searching for oil. Because in the
[1:14:41] moment that we hear those words, the
[1:14:43] bridegroom cometh, my brother and
[1:14:45] sister, when you don't have oil in your
[1:14:47] lamp, you are going to suffer the
[1:14:49] greatest pain, physical, mental,
[1:14:52] emotional, spiritual, that you could
[1:14:54] ever suffer in your life. So don't look
[1:14:57] to the right, don't look to the left.
[1:14:59] Amen. Look to the one that has redeemed
[1:15:01] you, that has called you and put oil in
[1:15:04] that lamp. All the rest of this is
[1:15:06] Satan's distraction in your life. You
[1:15:08] say, but this is very important. They
[1:15:10] insulted me. They this and this did this
[1:15:12] and that happened there. My brother and
[1:15:14] sister, I want you to understand. I say
[1:15:16] this with absolute uh uh just um
[1:15:19] anchored solid into this. Amen. That's
[1:15:22] nothing but the devil.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; They said what they said to you. They
[1:15:27] did what they did to you. The
[1:15:29] circumstance was such recognize that's
[1:15:32] just distraction. That has nothing to do
[1:15:35] with you. Amen. You are a son. You are a
[1:15:38] daughter of God. And God's calling you
[1:15:40] to have oil in your lamp. Make sure you
[1:15:43] got oil in your lamp. Don't worry about
[1:15:45] what everybody else's lamp looks like.
[1:15:47] Look at your lamp. Amen. And when you
[1:15:50] look at your lamp, we'll start to get
[1:15:51] concerned when it starts to get low.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; We'll start looking back in the word and
[1:15:56] start getting sincere and focused. Amen.
[1:15:59] But sometimes the barriers are so small.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; I'll be transparent.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[1:16:08] You can use it against me later in the
[1:16:10] court of law.
[1:16:13] When I was just a kid, didn't know any
[1:16:15] better.
[1:16:17] [clears throat] My older brother
[1:16:19] out out in the edge of Oregon where the
[1:16:21] family owns a farm,
[1:16:23] the little store there,
[1:16:26] the man there, my older brother wasn't
[1:16:28] that much older than me. And uh I was 10
[1:16:32] I think about at that time. So he was
[1:16:34] 12, 13 years old, 14 years old.
[1:16:39] the man selling cigarettes to my
[1:16:41] brother.
[1:16:43] And one day I happened to be there and I
[1:16:48] saw what was going on.
[1:16:50] I went and told my grandmother.
[1:16:54] The next time I walked in that store,
[1:16:55] that man practically pinned me against
[1:16:57] the wall and told me, "You've got
[1:16:59] diarrhea for a mouth."
[1:17:03] [clears throat]
[1:17:04] Glad some of you saw humor in that. At
[1:17:07] that age, I found no humor at all in
[1:17:09] that. And I remember that that hurt. It
[1:17:12] cut me right to the bone.
[1:17:17] But you see
[1:17:19] his insult
[1:17:21] by God's grace. I remember as a young
[1:17:23] kid, the church had a visiting minister
[1:17:26] and he says
[1:17:28] took the word, you know, kind of brought
[1:17:31] it around in such a way. Out of the
[1:17:33] mouth of many devils
[1:17:36] will a witness be brought.
[1:17:39] And I thought, oh, that's right. The
[1:17:44] devil's got his own witnesses.
[1:17:48] And I remember the next time I went in
[1:17:50] that store after that took place, I
[1:17:51] looked at that man and even as a kid, I
[1:17:54] thought,
[1:17:56] I need to feel sorry for you. You're a
[1:17:59] devil. That gave me a lot of
[1:18:01] satisfaction as a kid. You know, I'm not
[1:18:03] talking to a clerk in a store or owner
[1:18:05] of a store. I'm That's a devil. Changed
[1:18:08] my whole outlook.
[1:18:10] Amen. Of course, the devil's going to
[1:18:12] say to every man, woman, boy, girl,
[1:18:14] young teenager, whatever, that you you
[1:18:17] have a problem. It's you. It's all about
[1:18:20] you. It's not about me trying to kill
[1:18:22] the life and influence the life of
[1:18:24] children. It's you that's the problem.
[1:18:27] I'm right. You're wrong. Amen. But when
[1:18:30] you recognize that's just a witness of
[1:18:32] the devil,
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; that's Satan speaking,
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; you know what happens then?
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Get thee behind me, Satan.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Get thee behind me. What you have to say
[1:18:45] has nothing to do with me.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; We're in like two different worlds.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; You're in your world, cursed. Oh, I know
[1:18:55] this sounds just real
[1:18:58] boastful,
[1:19:00] but I think you'll agree we're in our
[1:19:02] world. That's right.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Blessed.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; So, I don't care what Satan's got to
[1:19:08] say.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Might call this some old-fashioned
[1:19:11] religion, too rigid, to this, to that.
[1:19:14] My brother and sister, everything I
[1:19:16] believe, and I don't say this boastful,
[1:19:17] I say it as a fact. Everything I believe
[1:19:19] is anchored right here.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't have an opinion out here
[1:19:24] that fits this or fits that. My opinion
[1:19:27] is right here [snorts]
[1:19:28] on the pages of this book. But not just
[1:19:30] on the pages cuz the Bible's everywhere.
[1:19:32] It's by revelation to be read between
[1:19:35] the lines to see who we are today. Amen.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Because this word was meant to bring you
[1:19:42] to a state that you believe.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; That's all it's here for. Not to have
[1:19:46] church, not to have religion, not to
[1:19:48] have some pompus, but to believe the
[1:19:50] word is coming to make you and I
[1:19:52] believe.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now look, doesn't matter how
[1:19:55] small the barrier is, a barrier is still
[1:19:59] a barrier.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; What's the definition of a barrier?
[1:20:04] Webster in the simplistic form is an
[1:20:07] obstacle.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you today,
[1:20:12] do you have obstacles
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; in your life? Amen.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; I think every one of us, if we'd be
[1:20:18] honest, would lift a hand and say,
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; "I have obstacles.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; I've got things I have to overcome."
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; I've got challenges that I can't seem to
[1:20:28] overcome.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; But the word says,
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; "That's right.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; You're an overcomer."
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; So, if you believe the word, you'll look
[1:20:35] at that obstacle and say, "Okay, I might
[1:20:37] not overcome you today, but tomorrow,
[1:20:39] watch out."
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now in the hidden life with
[1:20:43] Christ,
[1:20:49] [snorts]
[1:20:50] you know the best thing is to live a
[1:20:52] sermon instead of preach one.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; You know that.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Your written epistles. Now, Brother
[1:20:57] Brandon was just randomly speaking to
[1:21:00] people here.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; no more random than I'm just speaking to
[1:21:07] people.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; God knew every one of you would be here
[1:21:10] today. And there was a purpose behind
[1:21:12] it. We can say, "Well, that old
[1:21:14] slobbering preacher, you know, that old
[1:21:15] guy just mispronounces his word, slurs
[1:21:18] them." No, no, no. You got to look a
[1:21:20] little deeper than that. God knew you
[1:21:22] would be here and what God laid on my
[1:21:25] heart. Amen. I had a whole different
[1:21:27] topic I was going to preach, believe it
[1:21:28] or not. Amen. And then I just couldn't
[1:21:30] get away from this one. And here we go.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; But my brother and sister, God's that
[1:21:35] perfect.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, he's not God.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, brother Isaac shared a little
[1:21:42] article with me, you know, that there
[1:21:44] science is thinking that u and brother
[1:21:47] Isaac might have to correct my my memory
[1:21:50] on this. Science is thinking there's
[1:21:52] coming a day they're going to have to
[1:21:53] correct their atomic clock because time
[1:21:56] has changed and and time has changed 1
[1:22:00] billionth or something of a second.
[1:22:06] You think science can even figure out
[1:22:09] what 1 1 billionth of a second is?
[1:22:12] But you got to understand, let me insert
[1:22:14] this. Pause.
[1:22:17] Satan's whole goal,
[1:22:20] he doesn't care about what topic you're
[1:22:22] talking about. His whole goal is to get
[1:22:25] you to question the validity of what God
[1:22:29] said.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; His whole thing that he's working
[1:22:34] towards. It don't matter whether you're
[1:22:36] Catholic, a Methodist, Baptist,
[1:22:38] whatever. Going right down the line. It
[1:22:40] don't matter. You can be an atheist.
[1:22:42] He's still working on them to put it to
[1:22:44] a place where God is discounted. He's
[1:22:48] put to the side because we've saw a
[1:22:50] flaw. Well, my brother and sister, the
[1:22:53] word of God, which I happen to believe,
[1:22:54] and I know that you happen to believe,
[1:22:56] says he's perfect.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; So, what's Satan doing? He's working his
[1:23:00] way into society, into people. That it's
[1:23:03] there. Now, I know I've spoken over the
[1:23:06] pulpit. I've spoke it to you. But I want
[1:23:07] you to understand this this morning. Tie
[1:23:09] this in. These boys wanting to be girls
[1:23:12] and these girls wanting to be boys.
[1:23:15] You say it's science.
[1:23:18] No. Do you understand the whole
[1:23:21] undermining of this is they're trying to
[1:23:24] say God made a mistake.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; There's where it's at. That's what the
[1:23:31] whole underpine. God should have made me
[1:23:33] a boy. God should have made me a girl.
[1:23:35] God should have this. God should have
[1:23:36] that. He made a mistake. No, my brothers
[1:23:39] and sister, has nothing to do with
[1:23:41] gender dysphoria. It has nothing to do
[1:23:43] with these things over here. It's all
[1:23:44] about Satan's agenda to get people to
[1:23:47] believe that God cannot be trusted. God
[1:23:50] cannot be counted on. That God can make
[1:23:53] a mistake.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; And if you're going to sit there and
[1:23:56] say, "If he can make a mistake, then
[1:23:58] maybe when he said I was saved, that was
[1:24:00] a mistake. Amen.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Maybe when he said he could forgive my
[1:24:04] sins, that was a mistake. It's a
[1:24:06] neverending thing that just goes on,
[1:24:08] just rolls right on and like a snowball
[1:24:11] on the mountain just gets bigger and
[1:24:12] bigger and bigger. And the end result of
[1:24:14] it is those young people come to the
[1:24:16] place that say there isn't even a God.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; It's no longer whether they can trust
[1:24:20] him or not. It brings them to a place
[1:24:22] they deny he even exists.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; There's Satan's goal.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; But he uses these other things.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Where was I?
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; You know, the best thing is to live a
[1:24:34] sermon instead of preach one. You know
[1:24:36] that your written epistles,
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; but you can't do it in yourself. Can we
[1:24:41] say amen to that?
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; You can impersonate it for a little
[1:24:45] while, but your sins will find you out.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; You better just consecrate yourself to
[1:24:51] God and get on the inside. Shut the
[1:24:54] doors behind you. Burn every barrier
[1:24:56] that is behind you, every bridge, and
[1:24:59] launch out. Launch out. Amen. I know
[1:25:01] it's the truth. I know it will work. If
[1:25:03] it hadn't been for that, I don't know
[1:25:05] what would have become of me. That's
[1:25:08] right. But it ain't the people you have.
[1:25:12] My
[1:25:14] But it ain't the people you that look at
[1:25:17] them. It's Christ.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, my brother and sister, no
[1:25:21] matter what, Satan exposes a flaw in
[1:25:23] somebody.
[1:25:25] I brought that out earlier for this
[1:25:28] reason. You can look at me,
[1:25:31] you can find plenty of flaws.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; In fact, I've just quit trying to even
[1:25:36] hide them. That's
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; It don't It don't work.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; it don't work.
[1:25:46] When you look at me,
[1:25:49] our pastor
[1:25:51] has problems. It won't be long you're
[1:25:53] gone.
[1:25:57] But when you're walking out, please stop
[1:25:58] and look in the glass in the back.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; And look at the image
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; and tell me that person is perfect.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; But when you look at me through the lens
[1:26:09] of the word,
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; you're going to see blood covering me.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; That's right. And when I look at you
[1:26:14] through the lens of the word, I see
[1:26:16] blood covering you.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we stand together then
[1:26:21] with the blood covering us, we can have
[1:26:23] fellowship because our fellowship is not
[1:26:25] in humanity. It's in God. It's in the
[1:26:28] word. It's in this resurrected life of a
[1:26:31] revealed word in this hour. There's
[1:26:33] where our fellowship is at. Amen. Better
[1:26:36] consecrate yourself to God and get on
[1:26:38] the inside. Shut the doors behind you.
[1:26:40] Burn every barrier there is behind you,
[1:26:42] every bridge, and launch out. I know
[1:26:44] it's the truth. I know it'll work.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we believe this is truth at
[1:26:49] all, my brother and sister, the message
[1:26:51] of the hour, you've got a witness right
[1:26:53] here that's just as sure witness as you
[1:26:55] and I are to each other. And he's
[1:26:57] telling you, I know it works. And I
[1:27:00] stand here this morning behind this
[1:27:02] pulpit, this sacred desk, and I'll tell
[1:27:04] you, I know this works.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not guessing. I'm not throwing
[1:27:09] darts at a board to see what it is.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Now look at look at this. Such an action
[1:27:17] to come. God speaks to a man. If thou
[1:27:19] canst believe, his faith rose right up
[1:27:23] to that. Wait, no. He's confessing that
[1:27:26] he unbelieves. No, you missed the point.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; His faith rose right up. His fa faith
[1:27:32] expressed or exposed that he had certain
[1:27:35] little flaws,
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; but he believed so much he pushed past
[1:27:40] the barrier of the flaw.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Admitted, I have unbelief
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; and went and took a halt of the promise.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what the saints will
[1:27:51] do. Once behind the veil, my brother and
[1:27:53] sister, you can't even recognize your
[1:27:55] old life because your old life has been
[1:27:58] removed from you. you're not a sinner.
[1:28:01] We say the phrase, "I'm a sinner saved
[1:28:03] by grace." But the real truth of it is
[1:28:05] when a a believer, son or daughter of
[1:28:07] God, gets behind the veil, you can never
[1:28:10] look back at your old life with the same
[1:28:12] eyes because it has been washed and you
[1:28:15] don't really see it. You say, "I was a
[1:28:17] drunkard. I was this. I committed
[1:28:18] adultery. I blah blah blah. My brother
[1:28:20] and sister, it's not the same. It's a
[1:28:22] whole different concept, a whole
[1:28:24] different thing bringing forth because
[1:28:26] you realize the old me is dead and that
[1:28:30] really never was me. This is me.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; This is me under the blood of Jesus
[1:28:35] Christ. This is me wrapped in the word.
[1:28:37] This is me robed in righteousness. This
[1:28:40] is me. Uh, amen. Perfect in his sight.
[1:28:44] Amen. This is me. That was not me. Amen.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; But Satan wants to always remind you
[1:28:51] about what you were.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; And he never talks about what you are.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; He wants to leave it past tense.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Because the minute you start talking
[1:29:02] about what you are,
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; He loses you.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; What do you mean I'm redeemed?
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; You were a drunk. No, I'm You told me
[1:29:11] I'm redeemed. No, Satan will never go
[1:29:12] there.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; He'll never go there. Not with full
[1:29:16] revelation. Amen. [snorts] Let me move
[1:29:19] on. I don't know who stole the time, but
[1:29:21] somebody did.
[1:29:23] See, when you step across that line,
[1:29:27] as that father did,
[1:29:30] believe it or not, it was entirely his
[1:29:32] reaction to the word that delivered his
[1:29:35] child.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Okay, family, this might be a little bit
[1:29:39] this might be a little bit in your face.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; We got children.
[1:29:44] [snorts] We got sons, daughters,
[1:29:45] husbands, wives not serving God.
[1:29:49] We're waiting for God to move.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; What if God's waiting for you to move?
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; What if God's waiting for you to stand
[1:29:59] up and say, "Lord, I believe."
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Help my unbelief.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Help me burn the bridges that would stop
[1:30:07] me from being able to claim deliverance.
[1:30:10] Amen. Salvation. Amen. for my children,
[1:30:13] husband or wife, whatever it is, good
[1:30:15] friend. You see, sometimes God's waiting
[1:30:17] on us.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; We sit back and say, "Well, I'm just
[1:30:20] waiting on the Lord to answer the
[1:30:21] prayer, and God's waiting for you to get
[1:30:23] off the couch."
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And do something.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:30:30] [snorts]
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 12.
[1:30:37] Did I pass up
[1:30:40] just a second here?
[1:30:42] No, no. Looking at the unseen. I'm
[1:30:45] sorry.
[1:30:47] [snorts]
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; If there ever was a time that the church
[1:30:53] needs to step across that line which
[1:30:55] separates you between faith and
[1:30:57] unbelief, by sight, and looking at the
[1:31:01] unseen by faith, it's now. Now look, my
[1:31:04] brothers and sisters, this is preached
[1:31:05] in 58.
[1:31:08] And of course, we see times have got so
[1:31:10] much better.
[1:31:13] No sir, you look back in 58
[1:31:16] and I' I've done this. You go back and
[1:31:20] look at the the recorded history and uh
[1:31:24] a woman walk into a church
[1:31:28] in britches
[1:31:31] and they would have said, "What's wrong
[1:31:32] with you?"
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; When women would have cut their hair,
[1:31:38] they'd have said, "What's wrong with
[1:31:39] you?" when men would behave what is
[1:31:43] common place now
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; they have said what's wrong with you
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; but it's declined to a place there's no
[1:31:53] respect anywhere
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; now I know that kind might be straight
[1:31:59] it might be blunt but I'm telling you
[1:32:01] this is backed up by the word it's not a
[1:32:03] man's opinion and we'll look at this and
[1:32:06] this oh you might say well that's just a
[1:32:07] message perspective well it's strange
[1:32:09] that These people that deal in the realm
[1:32:12] of human behavior seem to have focused
[1:32:14] on that. They don't believe the message.
[1:32:16] I'm sorry to tell you, but they have
[1:32:18] focused that they have seen the decline
[1:32:20] and they've seen the rise. Oh my
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; my. Can Can I just be blunt with you
[1:32:24] what I've read, studied, they saw the
[1:32:27] rise of single mothers. They saw the
[1:32:31] rise of children out of wedlock. Yeah.
[1:32:34] same thing, but just I thought the
[1:32:37] official term children out of wedlock of
[1:32:40] people just living together,
[1:32:43] the rise of parents abandoning their
[1:32:47] children, abortion,
[1:32:49] all of these things, my brother and
[1:32:51] sister. Amen. What did the prophet tell
[1:32:53] us? Somebody, somebody spit it out for
[1:32:55] me. When did the prophet of God say that
[1:32:57] if they don't accept Jesus Christ by
[1:33:00] this time?
[1:33:03] 56.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; I I challenge you.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Go to Google, research it. 1956, the
[1:33:12] numbers turn up and go, and everything
[1:33:15] gets worse and worse and worse. The
[1:33:18] numbers start rising. You say, "That was
[1:33:19] just William Brandham's words, my
[1:33:21] brother and sister. That was God
[1:33:23] speaking a warning to America, and they
[1:33:25] didn't listen, and they rejected Christ.
[1:33:28] And the facts, the statistics prove it."
[1:33:31] Oh, that well that's your opinion. No.
[1:33:33] Well, like I said, these scientist guys,
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; I don't think they all believe the
[1:33:38] message. I don't think they're just
[1:33:39] quoting the prophet because they feel
[1:33:41] obligated to. They're studying all of
[1:33:44] this behavior.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; And they're seeing the result of this
[1:33:49] behavior. Now, if Brother Brandham had
[1:33:52] come in 1992 and said, "Well, because of
[1:33:54] this," we could look at it and say, "Oh,
[1:33:56] he just Googled that and figured out."
[1:33:58] No. No. He spoke it before it happened.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; And so what was he doing? He was
[1:34:07] mouththing
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; what God told him to say.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; And it was a warning to you and I.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Now let me put it in this fashion. We
[1:34:18] have a warning in the word that says
[1:34:20] when you hear, "Behold, the bridegroom
[1:34:22] cometh,
[1:34:24] go ye out to meet him." The word already
[1:34:27] warned us. There'll be a group of people
[1:34:29] that will say, "Oh, give me of your oil.
[1:34:32] I don't have any for myself. I I want I
[1:34:35] want you to have compassion on me and
[1:34:38] and give me some oil."
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; But there's no secondhand Holy Ghost.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; There's no secondhand relationship with
[1:34:49] the Lord.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's got to be a firsthand
[1:34:53] experience.
[1:34:55] Amen. If it's secondhand, my brother and
[1:34:57] sister, it's more than likely just
[1:34:59] religion.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; If you be this, you'll be saved.
[1:35:04] And
[1:35:06] I'm probably a little cynical. Forgive
[1:35:09] me. Works the same thing in the message.
[1:35:13] You can't sit here and say, "I believe
[1:35:15] God sent a prophet." That's not a vessel
[1:35:19] filled with oil.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; A parrot.
[1:35:23] Is this okay? Am I too blunt?
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; You guys will all forgive me someday.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; You could teach a parrot to say, "God
[1:35:31] sent a prophet."
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; We don't need a church with parrots. We
[1:35:36] need a church with people filled with a
[1:35:37] revelation of Jesus Christ present in
[1:35:40] our life. It's real and it's on fire and
[1:35:43] it's producing a result. Amen. That we
[1:35:45] could stand here today and it would be
[1:35:47] to a place if thou can't believe and we
[1:35:50] could be able I believe we will come to
[1:35:52] that place. He'll say, "If thou can't
[1:35:54] believe," and all we will say is, "I
[1:35:57] believe."
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; We won't be looking back saying, "Help
[1:36:00] my unbelief." Because that's what God's
[1:36:02] working through us today to push the
[1:36:04] unbelief, to push that to a spiritual
[1:36:07] maturity where we come up. And it don't
[1:36:09] matter what we're facing. The word is
[1:36:11] preeminent. The word is first. The life
[1:36:13] of Christ is living in us. And that's
[1:36:16] all we see. That's all we want. That's
[1:36:19] all we're seeking for. And that's all we
[1:36:21] will be filled with.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Otherwise, my brother and sister,
[1:36:25] we'll be just another church. We'll just
[1:36:27] be another denomination. We'll just be
[1:36:29] another group out here. But the prophet
[1:36:30] of God told us this message will never
[1:36:33] denominate. And people say, "But but it
[1:36:35] is already this is going on." Ah, he was
[1:36:37] talking about the message. He wasn't
[1:36:39] talking about people around the message.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; He was talking about the message. Amen.
[1:36:44] Who's the message here today?
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are the message here
[1:36:48] today. We are the life of Christ being
[1:36:50] lived out today. The truth made flesh.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's who we are. Oh, do you
[1:36:56] think you're super spiritual? No. You
[1:36:58] just have to ask Sister Jerry. She'll
[1:37:00] tell you that yesterday I got all
[1:37:02] impatient with her. I mean, I wasn't
[1:37:04] asking much just to have her climb a
[1:37:06] 20ft step uh extension ladder up into
[1:37:09] the gable and hold on to a board. You
[1:37:12] know, I wasn't asking much. Come on, get
[1:37:14] up the ladder. Hurry up. We ain't got
[1:37:16] all day.
[1:37:17] Yeah. I know. I'm sorry. That's me. I'm
[1:37:19] not proud of that. But I'll tell you,
[1:37:21] that's not really me.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; I'm not here alone, am I?
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:37:31] [snorts]
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you say, what you've
[1:37:35] done, though your sins be a scarlet. You
[1:37:37] once passed through that line of barrier
[1:37:40] of the devil trying to torment you.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Anybody here know this same devil? Yeah.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Saying you can't do it. You can't
[1:37:51] do it. And what are you going to say as
[1:37:53] a bride of Jesus Christ? I can do it.
[1:37:57] For Jesus said, whosoever will, let him
[1:38:00] come and drink of the waters of the
[1:38:02] fountain of life freely.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Leave it behind.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Well, I've got a little more stuff here,
[1:38:11] but I just want you to know, let me move
[1:38:12] ahead here. Time for us to let the word
[1:38:16] move us.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Across that line.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews 12.
[1:38:23] As we look at this, [snorts] wherefore,
[1:38:25] seeing that we are also compassed with
[1:38:27] so great a cloud of witnesses, let us
[1:38:29] lay aside every weight and sin that so
[1:38:32] doth easily beset us, and let us run
[1:38:35] with patience the race that is set
[1:38:36] before us,
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; looking unto Jesus,
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; not into CNN.
[1:38:43] That's right.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Not in Donald the last Trump.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; No, that's right.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Come on, saints.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Our trust is in Jesus Christ.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Not in a man in a white house. Not in a
[1:38:54] man that's a whatever you call it,
[1:38:56] premiere of a country or this or that of
[1:38:58] the country. But we're looking to Jesus
[1:39:00] Christ,
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; the author. Amen. He wrote it, my
[1:39:04] brother and sister, before the
[1:39:06] foundation of the world. And he's the
[1:39:08] finisher of our faith. Amen. And so all
[1:39:11] these years have went by, time rolling
[1:39:14] on, and he come down and says, "Now it's
[1:39:17] time in this age to finish it."
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; And he is finishing it. And you are the
[1:39:23] product of which he is finishing.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Who for the joy that was set before him
[1:39:30] endured the cross, despises shame, and
[1:39:33] sat down in the right hand of the throne
[1:39:35] of God. For consider him that endureth
[1:39:39] such contradiction. Can I can I just
[1:39:42] focus for a moment on this? Endureth
[1:39:44] such contradiction of sinners against
[1:39:46] himself, lest you be wearied and faint
[1:39:48] in your minds.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; You know what that contradiction is?
[1:39:54] Every time we step outside of the word,
[1:39:59] we became a contradiction
[1:40:03] to our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:40:06] Satan wants to bring it down. It's not a
[1:40:10] big deal.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Simple analogy. Many years ago when I
[1:40:15] was in the trucking business,
[1:40:18] there was a company. I wasn't there when
[1:40:19] this happened, but it come down
[1:40:21] firsthand to us. [snorts] There's a
[1:40:23] company that'd been habit before. And
[1:40:25] I'd been there and loaded before and
[1:40:27] they would get upset with you when they
[1:40:29] had the load, very tall load, and you
[1:40:32] would stop right there and throw a strap
[1:40:33] over it and they'd tell you, "Ain't got
[1:40:34] time for you to do that here. Move." And
[1:40:38] it wasn't until one of those loads one
[1:40:41] day tipped over and crushed a man
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; right there and killed him.
[1:40:47] And then it becomes such a contradiction
[1:40:49] because they went so far the other way
[1:40:53] trying to deal with this lawsuits and
[1:40:56] all of this. Isn't that human behavior?
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; But look what it is. We can ignore it
[1:41:04] till it kills us,
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Or we can stop and say, "Lord,
[1:41:11] I believe.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Help my unbelief. Yeah,
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, I I am a believer.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; I want to stand on your word today.
[1:41:21] [snorts]
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Now, saints, I'm not trying to make an
[1:41:22] altar call. I'm just not very good at
[1:41:24] that. But I tell you,
[1:41:28] times unbelief pops up in our life that
[1:41:30] makes us a contradiction.
[1:41:34] and condemnation
[1:41:37] will cause you to become weary and faint
[1:41:40] in your mind.
[1:41:42] Recognizing you should do different and
[1:41:45] not doing it will bring you to a state
[1:41:47] where you never have rest. You never
[1:41:50] find peace in Jesus Christ.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; A little straight this morning. Forgive
[1:41:55] me if it is too straight. But I'm
[1:41:57] telling you, I think it's time
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; for us to come to the place
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; that we would say, Lord, I want to put
[1:42:04] this behind me.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be a contradiction to
[1:42:08] your word.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; I want to be your word unreservedly. I
[1:42:14] want to join that great host of
[1:42:17] witnesses.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes when we read this
[1:42:20] scripture, we're thinking back. Maybe
[1:42:22] maybe your own mind would say, "Oh,
[1:42:25] we're compassed with so great a cloud of
[1:42:27] witnesses and we're looking back to
[1:42:28] Abraham and we're looking all the way
[1:42:30] back." What about
[1:42:33] yesterday?
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; We had witnesses in our midst
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; a great cloud.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; People just like you overcoming
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; in this day that would be able to stand
[1:42:45] and say, "You know what?
[1:42:48] Mark 16 in action." You know, Brother
[1:42:50] Brown focused on that quite a bit.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Saints, I'm going to tell you, if we
[1:42:56] wouldn't be looking backwards, we would
[1:42:58] see much more of Mark 16 taking place.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; We wouldn't have contradiction in our
[1:43:04] life. I'm healed. I just don't feel like
[1:43:07] it. I just don't see it. I just don't.
[1:43:09] No, we would come and say, you know
[1:43:11] what? I don't care what happened.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; I'm healed in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:43:16] I don't care what happened. I'm
[1:43:18] delivered in the name of Jesus Christ. I
[1:43:21] don't care what Satan says. I've got the
[1:43:23] Holy Ghost. I've met all the
[1:43:25] requirements and he promised to give me
[1:43:27] the Holy Ghost. I've got the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:30] Where is it at? It's growing in me being
[1:43:33] built up. It's coming forth as a life
[1:43:36] that is a testimony not to us
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; but to him.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister, would you come? Musicians.
[1:43:44] Amen. Hallelujah. Sorry, I've [snorts]
[1:43:47] kept you just a little bit long here.
[1:43:51] We'll be going on a trip. Brother David
[1:43:53] will cut his services short to make up
[1:43:55] for this. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:44:00] Amen.
[1:44:02] Let's sing that song, The Other Only
[1:44:04] Believe.
[1:44:05] When Brother Isaac announced that, I
[1:44:08] thought, "Oh my, praise God." But then I
[1:44:10] realized I was talking about the other
[1:44:12] Only Believe. Amen. Let's just stand.
[1:44:14] Worship the Lord for a few minutes
[1:44:16] before we go. Hallelujah.
[1:44:19] [snorts]
[1:44:28] Come help me, brother Isaac. Where are
[1:44:30] you?
[1:44:34] Fear not,
[1:44:36] little [music]
[1:44:37] flaw.
[1:44:39] From the cross to the throne,
[1:44:44] from life
[1:44:47] into death. Oh,
[1:44:51] William for his own.
[1:44:55] All power
[1:44:58] on earth.
[1:45:00] All power [singing]

[1:46:00] only

[1:46:06] Fear not
[1:46:09] little flaw.
[1:46:12] Ye goeth
[1:46:15] ahead. [singing]
[1:46:18] Your sheepers
[1:46:21] selected
[1:46:23] the path you must tread
[1:46:29] the [singing] waters
[1:46:31] of my
[1:46:34] heen [music and singing]
[1:46:37] for you.

[1:46:48] money.

[1:47:21] Lord,
[1:47:24] I believe.
[1:47:28] All things are possible [music]
[1:47:34] only.
[1:47:39] Fear not
[1:47:42] [singing] little flock,
[1:47:45] whatever [music]
[1:47:47] your [singing] lock.
[1:47:50] He enters
[1:47:53] all [music and singing] rooms.
[1:47:56] adors
[1:47:57] being [music] shut.
[1:48:01] He never
[1:48:03] forsakes. [music]
[1:48:06] He never [singing]
[1:48:09] is gone.
[1:48:11] [music] So count on his presence
[1:48:17] [music]
[1:48:17] in darkness [singing]
[1:48:20] and all.
[1:48:23] She only

[1:48:48] Lord,

[1:48:54] Lord, [singing]
[1:48:56] I believe
[1:49:01] all things [singing]
[1:49:02] are possible. [music]
[1:49:06] Lord, [singing]
[1:49:08] I believe.
[1:49:12] Amen.
[1:49:14] Amen. I said in my heart that little
[1:49:15] [music] chorus, there's a fountain open
[1:49:17] in the house of David.
[1:49:19] Amen.
