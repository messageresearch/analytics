[42:43] amen to just be able to serve the Lord
[42:47] in spirit and in truth
[42:49] amen you know we look into world and you
[42:53] know it's pretty interesting when you
[42:54] look around you see all the things that
[42:57] are symptomatic the warning sounds Amen
[43:02] that the end is near are sounding all
[43:04] around us and people sometimes just
[43:07] struggle you know we get so caught up in
[43:09] life get so caught up in every little
[43:11] circumstance around us that we miss the
[43:14] warning sounds Amen we missed the sign
[43:17] as it were amen
[43:19] well we certainly want to you know some
[43:22] time to get overconfident you think you
[43:24] remember things
[43:24] I believe it's ken and Terry happy to
[43:28] have you here you are well loved by your
[43:32] family here and so that's good to see
[43:35] you and each and every one and kind of
[43:38] happy to be able to read this little
[43:40] note our sister Sharon says I think the
[43:43] Almighty God for allowing me to graduate
[43:46] college I'm very grateful thankful for
[43:48] his mercy upon my life and also please
[43:51] remember in your prayer my fiance's visa
[43:54] documents amen
[43:55] so we definitely want to remember that
[43:57] our sister Sharon just reaching some
[44:01] milestones in your life and god bless
[44:03] you we just get to see God working amen
[44:06] and you know we should never some people
[44:09] say well we don't like to look backwards
[44:11] well that's right we're not frogs we're
[44:12] not looking back but we don't want to
[44:15] forget where we came from amen and in
[44:18] these natural blessings that God has
[44:20] given us he just keeps lifting us up he
[44:23] keeps pouring his blessings out and I
[44:25] say thank you Lord that we can look you
[44:28] know as as as it were you know the
[44:30] little story about I thank the Lord huh
[44:32] not what I should be but I like to
[44:35] condense it down
[44:36] not what I used to be amen and we see
[44:40] God working in our lives and so I say
[44:42] god bless you to each and every one this
[44:44] morning amen
[44:45] I would like to speak to you on
[44:48] redemptions manifestation once again and
[44:51] being drawn into his presence I believe
[44:55] as this song or brother Chris just
[44:57] shared with us is a as I'm singing that
[45:00] there and yes yeah where I'm going
[45:05] what's happening I'm being drawn is it
[45:08] something I've done something you've
[45:10] done you see there's no good thing in us
[45:12] we cannot bring ourselves into his
[45:15] presence but being drawn into his
[45:18] presence we know there's a power in the
[45:20] word that has been manifested into the
[45:24] people now it's interesting the world we
[45:26] live in Saints uh some people say well
[45:29] you know people around the message they
[45:31] think there's something special well I
[45:33] want to put it this way I don't care
[45:34] where you are from and what your life is
[45:38] where you go to church if you claim the
[45:40] name of being a Christian and you don't
[45:43] think you're something special you've
[45:45] missed a revelation there's there's just
[45:48] something a special about being called
[45:51] of God empowered by His Word to live the
[45:54] word amen and watch it come to pass in
[45:57] your life in a husband a wife children
[45:59] grandchildren my brother and sister we
[46:02] ought to not be ashamed to lift up our
[46:04] hand and say I am something special
[46:06] Amen I was created in His image amen
[46:10] I've got his nature the very life is in
[46:13] me hallelujah amen
[46:15] that should be enough for us to stand up
[46:17] and say I'm special amen well speaking
[46:21] on being drawn into his presence this
[46:23] morning why don't we just stand this
[46:25] will go into the Word of God had
[46:27] something else I wanted to share and I
[46:29] I've got to get and remember because
[46:33] I've forgotten already but you know how
[46:36] how beautiful is to be a part of the
[46:38] body of Christ amen
[46:41] John the twelfth chapter we'll start
[46:45] verse 20 amen
[46:49] we'll take our our thoughts out of this
[46:53] scripture today and just hope that
[46:56] you'll be able to find the continuity of
[46:58] our thought you know sometimes is you
[47:01] just go through your week you know you
[47:06] just maybe write a little note down
[47:08] something inspires you and you add
[47:12] something to it you had something to it
[47:14] sometimes it never makes it anywhere but
[47:17] from my little notepad it turns out you
[47:20] realize it's just an inspiration for
[47:21] yourself and I pray that each and every
[47:24] one of you as you go through your your
[47:26] weeks your days or weeks or months your
[47:28] years I pray that you find inspiration
[47:30] if we if we are living off of a dead
[47:33] letter my brother and sister there is no
[47:36] inspiration but if you are living off
[47:38] the living word there is inspiration in
[47:42] that word amen Hallet dictum you know I
[47:46] just remember one time you know many
[47:48] years ago one and only time we ever went
[47:50] down visited brother branham's den
[47:52] brother George Smith shared with us some
[47:55] of brother Browns notes and you know he
[47:58] noted which sermons were which and my
[48:01] brother and sister sometimes all there
[48:03] was was a scripture written on a page
[48:05] there was nothing else and we listened
[48:07] to those very same sermons and are
[48:10] inspired and it's almost like you could
[48:12] say that was preached for today and the
[48:15] inspiration see the Word was alive it
[48:18] was inspiring and that inspiration that
[48:21] was in there didn't need pages and pages
[48:23] and pages and notes it didn't need an
[48:25] encyclopedia because it had Revelation
[48:27] behind it
[48:28] amen and the revelations what opened the
[48:31] word and made it life and that same
[48:33] revelation of Jesus Christ is opening
[48:35] the word today and making it alive to
[48:38] you and I Amen so we should have
[48:40] inspiration in our lives
[48:42] hallelujah amen and there were certain
[48:46] Greeks among them that come up to
[48:48] worship at the feast and the same came
[48:50] therefore to Philip which was of the
[48:53] theta of Galilee I always get a moment
[48:56] if for the rest of my life going to have
[48:58] some humor over that Amen which us which
[49:01] is of b'seder of Galilee desiring
[49:03] sir we would see Jesus Philip cometh and
[49:08] telleth Andrew and again Andrew and
[49:10] Philip telleth Jesus and jesus answered
[49:12] them saying um that the Son of Man be
[49:16] glorified verily verily I say unto you
[49:19] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[49:21] ground and die it abideth alone but if
[49:25] it die it bringeth forth much fruit he
[49:29] that loveth his life shall lose it and
[49:32] he that hateth his life in this world
[49:35] shall keep it in to life eternal If any
[49:39] man serve me let him follow me and where
[49:41] I am there shall also my servant be If
[49:44] any man serve me him will my father
[49:48] honour now is my soul troubled and what
[49:51] shall I say father save me from this
[49:54] hour but for this cause come I unto this
[49:57] hour and father glorify thy name
[50:01] then come there a voice from heaven
[50:03] saying I have both glorified it and will
[50:06] glorify it again the people therefore
[50:10] that stood by and heard it said that it
[50:13] funded others said an angel spake to him
[50:16] jesus answered and said this voice I
[50:19] love this verse right here this voice
[50:23] came not because of me but for your
[50:26] sakes now is a judgment of this world
[50:29] now shall the Prince of this world be
[50:33] cast out and if I and I if I be lifted
[50:37] up from the earth will draw all men unto
[50:40] me this he said signifying what death he
[50:44] should die the people answered him we
[50:47] have heard out of the law that Christ
[50:49] abideth for ever and how say us now the
[50:52] Son of Man must be lifted up and who is
[50:55] this son of man then jesus said unto
[50:59] them yet a little while is the light
[51:01] with you walk while you have the light
[51:04] lest darkness come upon you for he that
[51:07] walketh in darkness knoweth not whither
[51:10] he goeth while you have light believe in
[51:14] the life that ye may be chill
[51:17] of the light these things spake Jesus
[51:20] and departed and did hide himself from
[51:23] them
[51:24] no those last four words five words
[51:28] right there have a greater significance
[51:30] than we would just give to them with a
[51:33] casual reading my brother and sister
[51:36] Christ is standing right here according
[51:38] to the Word of God and yet to the eyes
[51:41] that are blinded
[51:43] he is completely hid but two eyes that
[51:46] have been opened he is so real so
[51:49] present so powerful that it is a
[51:53] life-changing event amen
[51:56] not just going to church not just being
[51:58] at church not belonging to a church but
[52:01] standing in the very presence of God and
[52:04] did you know that if you only feel the
[52:07] presence of God when you come to church
[52:09] something's missing this is where we as
[52:13] Saints of like precious faith gathered
[52:17] together to have our bonfire amen I say
[52:21] that as a bonfire because you brought
[52:23] your liquefier I brought my liquor fire
[52:25] and then you times that lick a fire by
[52:28] however many are present and you have a
[52:30] bonfire amen Heavenly Father we love you
[52:34] today and father we come before you and
[52:37] ask for your guiding hand of mercy upon
[52:39] us today Lord you know the needs that
[52:43] each and every one of us bear Lord you
[52:46] know the disappointments and the
[52:47] struggles the father I know such an
[52:51] awesome God I know a God who loves us in
[52:55] a measure so far beyond we can
[52:57] comprehend as humans then I would pray
[53:01] today Lord don't let our human
[53:02] comprehension of your love restrict us
[53:05] Lord let us step beyond the veil into
[53:08] your presence let the very life of the
[53:11] word be open to us manifested in us Lord
[53:15] that it would give us the strength to
[53:17] stand up Oh father as they say it
[53:19] doesn't matter Lord many places these
[53:21] kind of words come from oh I just
[53:24] reading Lord where they're talking about
[53:26] how in this advanced military training
[53:29] to be rangers and seals
[53:31] and these kind of things often time or
[53:34] it's not the fear of the job to come but
[53:38] it is the endurance to survive what
[53:41] they're facing at the moment that
[53:44] separates them Oh God
[53:46] we ask you today Lord give us strength
[53:48] for every challenge that we face if we
[53:52] have fallen down lord give us the
[53:54] strength to stand up again Lord if we
[53:58] feast faced confusion father let us have
[54:01] the faith to cry out for the peace and
[54:05] the confirmation of our minds Lord
[54:07] Father stir our hearts today we pray in
[54:10] the name of Jesus Christ amen
[54:14] you may be seated Alleluia
[54:16] I had about a half a dozen titles that
[54:29] seemed to kind of come to me on this and
[54:31] I settled on this one because I believe
[54:35] I'll be able to get part two three four
[54:37] and five out of it but you know a
[54:41] thankful for the Word of God as we have
[54:43] spoken several times recently my brother
[54:46] and sister redemptions going to have a
[54:48] manifestation you know if you go to the
[54:51] pawnshop and you pay the price to redeem
[54:54] something and then you turn around and
[54:56] walk out of the pawnshop without that
[54:58] that would be deemed you will be doomed
[55:02] as it were to go back and pay the price
[55:04] again so when you have has been paid for
[55:08] which our Lord Jesus paid for amen to
[55:11] get it in proper context take what is
[55:15] yours take what has been given to you
[55:18] amen
[55:19] now as we look at this I want to touch
[55:21] just a little bit on the scriptures but
[55:22] not a lot before we move on today amen
[55:25] so as we look at this I as I read verse
[55:28] 2 you know the same came there to Philip
[55:31] which is the best Ceyda of Galilee
[55:32] desiring him saying sir we would see
[55:35] Jesus and you know my brother and sister
[55:38] I believe that each and every one of us
[55:40] that should be our heart's desire you
[55:43] know we look in the world
[55:44] day and you know I have quite a
[55:45] cross-section of friends in my life men
[55:48] that I respect very much everything from
[55:50] men who don't even really believe that
[55:53] there is a god that's just kind of all
[55:55] been ordained and we just do what we do
[55:57] and it gets settled up at the end two
[56:00] men that believe that God is real but
[56:02] really don't do much about it and it's
[56:05] hard to kind of contain in mind that you
[56:08] believe that God is real but yet you
[56:10] would ignore what God is doing but still
[56:12] it is you might say a paradox that is
[56:15] there and and then I have friends that
[56:18] are a new name it Methodists Baptists
[56:21] Mormon that are just devout and faithful
[56:25] to a high degree and each one of those
[56:28] would express to you that they would
[56:30] desire to see Jesus and I believe here
[56:33] today each one of us would would say
[56:36] that is our goal otherwise we would not
[56:38] be here and when I think of this or read
[56:41] this scripture I think about the little
[56:43] story about the little boy wanting to
[56:45] see God and talking to mom and then dad
[56:48] and then to the youth leader in the
[56:50] pastor and finally ending up out on the
[56:52] river with the old man and this little
[56:55] boy just just believed there was
[56:57] something inside of this young man that
[56:59] believed it you know he wanted to see
[57:02] God he wanted to to see that and you
[57:05] know finally everybody says well you
[57:07] know quote scripture doe no man can see
[57:09] God but my brother and sister what was
[57:11] in this young boy was not maybe being
[57:14] expressed or received in his expression
[57:17] to the parents and ministry etc in the
[57:20] way the little boy needed to be
[57:22] satisfied they were telling him you know
[57:25] maybe biblical answers maybe correct
[57:27] answer in one sense but it took an old
[57:29] man who sat there on a River watched the
[57:32] Sun Rise watch the Sun fall many things
[57:35] of beauty and you know an old man that
[57:38] would look at him and tell him young man
[57:40] and here's gone every day I see him I
[57:43] see him when the Sun rises I see him
[57:45] when it falls I see all of these saying
[57:47] you know my brother and sister we don't
[57:49] want to come to a place that we find
[57:52] ourselves what I would call landlocked
[57:54] and that that we have such a con
[57:58] chin of what God is doing or how God is
[58:00] going to do it that we quit looking for
[58:03] Jesus Christ because he said he would be
[58:06] with us even in us to the end and so we
[58:09] shouldn't have to look if we're living a
[58:10] life that we should in the sense of
[58:13] reading our Bible and praying we
[58:14] shouldn't have to look any farther than
[58:16] what God is doing in our own life to see
[58:19] Jesus Christ amen and so if you don't
[58:22] see him I pray you find the mirror of
[58:24] the word go start searching it out
[58:26] because you were created in His image
[58:29] and we should come to the place this is
[58:31] not something boastful we're not taking
[58:34] a position higher than someone else but
[58:36] we should be able as it were to stand in
[58:38] the mirror and look in that mirror and
[58:40] say I see Jesus Christ because he
[58:42] promised that he would be in me amen and
[58:45] so it when we come with a confidence to
[58:48] take all that God has promised to us it
[58:50] will stir us to move on and like this
[58:53] little boy we will not be satisfied with
[58:55] the church experience but it will be
[58:57] something much deeper than that and
[58:59] you'll find my brother and sister I
[59:01] don't say this judgmental even though it
[59:02] might sound like it you cannot take the
[59:05] advice or you cannot take the words of
[59:07] an individual because you might ask one
[59:09] individual well what about what is he
[59:11] doing in this day if that person does
[59:14] not believe God's doing anything you
[59:16] walk away with that impression put down
[59:20] into your mind then you will go on
[59:22] through life thinking God's not doing
[59:24] anything if you think you meet someone
[59:26] and you ask that same question to them
[59:28] and they say well gods and his church
[59:30] just go to church you'll find God well
[59:32] my brother and sister then people go to
[59:34] church and they think that's where they
[59:36] will find God but when you find someone
[59:38] that is got a Holy Ghost fire burning
[59:41] inside of them and they will tell you
[59:43] everywhere I turn I cannot pick up my
[59:46] Bible but what I see Jesus Christ I see
[59:49] the Sun Rise I see Jesus Christ I see
[59:52] your sunset I see Jesus Christ I see
[59:54] clouds on the horizon I see Jesus Christ
[59:56] and I see the Sun rising through the
[59:59] clouds I had all my brother and sister
[1:00:01] how beautiful it is you know on the way
[1:00:03] to church this morning we drove through
[1:00:05] by that little church oh I don't
[1:00:07] remember the name of it but it's the one
[1:00:08] that's way out in the country on the
[1:00:10] south side the road there
[1:00:11] fortune and the folks were coming up to
[1:00:13] the door and I imagine it was probably
[1:00:15] the deacon they always get the bad rap
[1:00:16] so we'll just leave that rap on the D
[1:00:18] amen and he's standing at the door and
[1:00:21] he's taking their temperature and I
[1:00:23] thought well you know it is something of
[1:00:25] the time we should be uh you know doing
[1:00:28] that but I wonder if they really truly
[1:00:30] had had a really Holy Ghost Pentecostal
[1:00:33] type experience lately it would be quite
[1:00:36] the opposite because you see as it is
[1:00:38] right now they're holding that little
[1:00:40] deal up to take the temperature and it
[1:00:41] be like whoa your temperatures raised a
[1:00:44] little bit you can't come to church but
[1:00:46] what if we had a real Holy Ghost type
[1:00:47] Pentecostal type experience and it would
[1:00:50] be like oh we your temperature is high
[1:00:53] enough you need to go back out and pray
[1:00:56] some more oh come on Saints we are not
[1:00:59] come to church chilled out Amen there's
[1:01:02] no place to be chilled out we should be
[1:01:04] pressing into the presence of Almighty
[1:01:06] God we should be on fire and you know
[1:01:09] I'm not saying this that I think it's an
[1:01:12] open compass imagine what I bind the
[1:01:15] spirit of the coronavirus I bind the
[1:01:18] spirit of the wickedness of this world I
[1:01:20] pray it over this church Lord bind it
[1:01:23] amen I believe God he said whatever you
[1:01:26] bind on earth will be bound in heaven
[1:01:27] whatever you loose on earth will be
[1:01:29] loosed in heaven you say well I don't
[1:01:31] think it applies to that well I don't
[1:01:32] think God's gonna hold it against me for
[1:01:34] applying it to that hallelujah amen we
[1:01:38] don't have to claim every sickness the
[1:01:39] flus going around I think I've got the
[1:01:41] flu how about you just say you know what
[1:01:43] the flu is going around and I reject it
[1:01:45] in the name of Jesus Christ amen because
[1:01:47] by here strap I'm already healed so all
[1:01:50] I'm doing is not being crazy I'm just
[1:01:52] accepting or claiming what he's already
[1:01:54] done for me amen hallelujah actually
[1:02:00] it's kind of fun being a little bit
[1:02:01] crazy the world around us don't know
[1:02:05] what to do with you these people go to
[1:02:08] church and actually enjoy themselves
[1:02:09] these people go to church and walk out
[1:02:12] beaming what's wrong with them yeah
[1:02:17] praise the Lord I'm glad I got something
[1:02:19] wrong with me hallelujah now what it
[1:02:23] just bounce a few of these scriptures
[1:02:24] that just
[1:02:25] kind of touched me as I was studying
[1:02:26] them and verse 24 says verily verily i
[1:02:29] send to you except a corn of wheat fall
[1:02:32] into the ground and die it abideth alone
[1:02:34] but if it die it bringeth forth much
[1:02:37] fruit now my brother and sister every
[1:02:40] son or daughter of God that has been
[1:02:42] birthed in Jesus Christ is the fruit
[1:02:45] amen so we are the fruit of Christ
[1:02:48] laying down his life for us
[1:02:50] now we'll do just an extension of that
[1:02:54] by jumping to verse 27 and he says now
[1:02:59] is my soul trouble what shall I say my
[1:03:04] brother and sister you see the human
[1:03:06] side of Jesus Christ because God put him
[1:03:08] in that human body and then the human
[1:03:10] side of him knew that there was pain and
[1:03:12] suffering coming he knew that this was
[1:03:14] not going to be a comfortable thing and
[1:03:17] so there it is in his own expression
[1:03:19] right in the word he says now is my soul
[1:03:22] troubled what shall I say father save me
[1:03:26] from this hour now my brother and sister
[1:03:30] that would be the result or the effect
[1:03:33] that many of us would have we we face
[1:03:35] hard trials we face times in our life
[1:03:37] sometimes these trials go on for decades
[1:03:39] they don't just come and blow away like
[1:03:41] the clouds in in an evening they they
[1:03:43] stay with us and sometimes people get
[1:03:46] weary they get wore out from all of the
[1:03:49] travail in the struggle of life but
[1:03:51] Jesus is there and he's saying you know
[1:03:53] I am troubled and what shall I say
[1:03:55] father save me from this hour but look
[1:03:58] he said but for this cause come I unto
[1:04:01] this hour he recognized the calling on
[1:04:04] his life was not just to come to the
[1:04:07] threshold or the gate and you know I'm
[1:04:10] gonna just use this phrase pardon me if
[1:04:12] it sounds offensive but he didn't come
[1:04:14] to that point just to chicken out and
[1:04:16] nor are we called to come to that point
[1:04:18] and chicken out amen you know the
[1:04:21] pressure of my friends the pressure of
[1:04:22] spool of work of this a neighbor of
[1:04:25] family whatever it is causing us to
[1:04:27] chicken out my brother and sister if
[1:04:29] anything have you ever had a real
[1:04:30] experience you know all of the things
[1:04:33] around us in this struggle should cause
[1:04:35] us to be stronger not weaker amen
[1:04:38] because if we're weaker
[1:04:39] relying on herself and not upon Jesus
[1:04:41] Christ so when we are birthed in Christ
[1:04:44] my brother and sister we become that
[1:04:45] very fruit and he says Lord save me from
[1:04:49] this hour but don't you love how buddy
[1:04:51] is it negates everything right in front
[1:04:54] of him so while he expressed this Lord
[1:04:56] saved me from this hour but let's take
[1:04:59] that off the screen amen
[1:05:01] it was for this hour amen the claws come
[1:05:04] I understand sister we live in don't
[1:05:10] look out here and say well it's so hard
[1:05:11] to raise a family
[1:05:12] the schools are are just sinking quickly
[1:05:15] and the public is sinking quickly all of
[1:05:18] this is just going downhill rejoice
[1:05:21] rejoice this is our our Amen not to turn
[1:05:25] and walk away because it's too hard but
[1:05:27] turn and face it turn and say Lord no
[1:05:31] this is the hour a man I don't know
[1:05:33] would you humor me this morning maybe
[1:05:34] lift a hand and say Lord this is my hour
[1:05:37] amen this is the hour for me to shine
[1:05:40] and let the life of Jesus Christ be
[1:05:42] expressed in me hallelujah I want to
[1:05:45] jump down to verse 30 real quick Amen
[1:05:48] Jesus answers and says that this voice
[1:05:50] came not because of me but for your sake
[1:05:53] amen I want to take that right back to
[1:05:56] Malachi 4:5 people have twisted that up
[1:05:58] turned that into a knot in such a
[1:06:00] fashion my brother and sister no wonder
[1:06:02] it confuses people but if you stop and
[1:06:04] you look at it just real careful he said
[1:06:06] behold I send you hallelujah Jesus says
[1:06:11] this voice was not for me but it was for
[1:06:13] you Malachi 4:5 says this voice that is
[1:06:17] coming this Elijah that is coming is for
[1:06:19] you amen
[1:06:20] people got it twisted and they want to
[1:06:22] put the Prophet as it were out front
[1:06:24] that this is the whole purpose of the
[1:06:26] message but my brother and sister
[1:06:28] Malachi 4:5 was a prophet of God claimed
[1:06:30] as Commission is that the word would
[1:06:33] come to us so God knew we needed a
[1:06:35] corrected word a restored word a word
[1:06:37] that would get us into a rapture a word
[1:06:40] that would release the faith that is
[1:06:41] already in us and he says I'm gonna come
[1:06:43] down and in a supernatural fashion not a
[1:06:46] theologian not an intellectual not
[1:06:48] somebody that's going to take you back
[1:06:49] to the root word of the root
[1:06:50] the root word in Hebrew that somebody
[1:06:52] that's gonna make that word alive to you
[1:06:54] hey man you can have all kinds of it's
[1:06:57] psycho PDS and this kind of book and
[1:06:59] that kind of book my brother and sister
[1:07:00] you can have a room full of Thea sources
[1:07:03] and references written by all kinds of
[1:07:05] people but my brother and sister the
[1:07:07] word has not come alive in you and I it
[1:07:10] will just be words on that page and it's
[1:07:13] not about what the words are on the page
[1:07:15] it's about the life that is in it go
[1:07:17] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:07:19] what was that the life of Jesus Christ
[1:07:21] hallelujah amen because without that
[1:07:24] life we got nothing
[1:07:27] hallelujah Oh amen there's a voice to us
[1:07:32] in our hour oh my brother and sister we
[1:07:35] got to listen to that voice
[1:07:39] verse 32 before we go on into our
[1:07:42] thoughts and I if I be lifted up from
[1:07:46] the earth will draw all men unto me
[1:07:49] hallelujah I want to just take out of
[1:07:53] this little thought I actually have
[1:07:55] several quotes bring them to you today
[1:07:58] because I believe that the content of
[1:08:00] them in the context that they're brought
[1:08:02] in is just as good I could explain all
[1:08:05] this in my own words God be near tonight
[1:08:11] this part of a prayer
[1:08:12] oh great angel coming down from God as a
[1:08:15] messenger come near tonight speak to the
[1:08:17] people and may your power move the
[1:08:21] people you see brother Branham didn't
[1:08:24] stand there and say now this power that
[1:08:26] I have or this than I am
[1:08:27] he clearly pointed us back to one power
[1:08:30] that housed the ability to move the
[1:08:32] people and so as it's there he says may
[1:08:35] your power move the people may the Holy
[1:08:38] Spirit speak into every heart and may
[1:08:41] there not be a feeble person among us
[1:08:42] when we leave tonight granted Almighty
[1:08:45] God so I just bring that as a reference
[1:08:47] my brother sister that it would come and
[1:08:49] there would be a power to move the
[1:08:52] people now I believe we could lift a
[1:08:54] hand and say I've experienced that power
[1:08:56] amen
[1:08:56] move me from where I was people would
[1:08:59] say well you know maybe it wasn't a bad
[1:09:01] person in the beginning there it wasn't
[1:09:03] a whole lot of moving to do
[1:09:04] my brother and sister there certainly is
[1:09:06] a whole lot of moving to go because you
[1:09:08] know what we we just don't we don't have
[1:09:10] what it takes it's not within us we
[1:09:12] don't have the ability I think mother
[1:09:14] but.maybe said that as in his prayer
[1:09:16] there Lord we have this ability we can
[1:09:18] bring ourselves to live a life that
[1:09:22] would be pleasing to God I'm sorry just
[1:09:24] not in US but that doesn't mean we'll
[1:09:26] touch on it in a minute that does not
[1:09:27] mean that we have a does not does not we
[1:09:32] don't have a part
[1:09:33] amen you see we can't just sit back and
[1:09:37] say well if God placed the seed in my
[1:09:39] life before the foundation in the world
[1:09:41] then I was on that Lamb's Book of Life
[1:09:42] God will just take care of it look just
[1:09:44] somehow happened my brother and sister
[1:09:45] it might happen right after you've been
[1:09:47] drugged through your fiftieth novel now
[1:09:49] if you like not holes then you just keep
[1:09:50] hanging on to your ideology and you just
[1:09:53] go for the ride and then later on you'll
[1:09:55] say man I'm so beat up well just
[1:09:56] remember it was your own fault because
[1:09:58] you said that you just wouldn't go that
[1:09:59] way and God said yes you will amen but
[1:10:02] look at this speaking this morning on
[1:10:04] being drawn into his presence right so
[1:10:07] as it is there's nothing in us as it is
[1:10:08] and others that would cause us to serve
[1:10:10] the Lord to paraphrase the scripture
[1:10:12] kind of bring it all together we were
[1:10:14] born in sin can we say amen to that
[1:10:16] amen we were shaped in iniquity amen
[1:10:18] hallelujah well I'll tell you what my
[1:10:20] brother and sister you don't have to
[1:10:22] teach a child to lie in fact you don't
[1:10:26] have to teach an adult to lie there's
[1:10:29] just something in the nature that will
[1:10:31] sometimes you know especially when we
[1:10:33] don't want to embarrass ourselves we can
[1:10:37] craft this sentence come on you know
[1:10:39] what I'm talking about
[1:10:40] we can craft the sentence in such a way
[1:10:44] who broke this all I know is somebody
[1:10:48] did we know good and well we broke it
[1:10:55] but we no want to embarrass ourselves
[1:10:58] you know Jerry and I flew to Denver the
[1:11:00] other day had to take care of a little
[1:11:02] business we're sitting in the airport in
[1:11:06] a little restaurant I guess you would
[1:11:08] call it or whatever they said well
[1:11:10] because the social distancing we only
[1:11:12] have half our tables do you mind sitting
[1:11:13] at this little narrow bar and I liked it
[1:11:16] because it's looking out for the
[1:11:17] way over the airport and I'm sitting
[1:11:19] there and and so the lady brought straws
[1:11:22] and she is um down there and you know it
[1:11:27] I thought well maybe I'll use this straw
[1:11:29] I went to reach for the straw and I
[1:11:32] knocked my glass of water over and we
[1:11:35] know that the carpenter who built those
[1:11:36] counters didn't build it good because it
[1:11:38] ran that way and you know it's funny
[1:11:46] because the words that come out of my
[1:11:48] mouth was Wow I wanted a straw on the
[1:11:49] glass got in the way but if we set that
[1:11:54] glass there and watched it for days
[1:11:56] weeks or months it would never move but
[1:12:00] you see it's in the human element that
[1:12:02] we would kind of phrase it in a way
[1:12:04] trying to not be embarrassed because
[1:12:05] everybody around us every table and
[1:12:08] people down the counter in both
[1:12:09] directions are all looking well he's not
[1:12:14] a child it's in US my brother and sister
[1:12:20] to cover our tracks is it not born in
[1:12:27] sin shaped in iniquity come into the
[1:12:29] world speaking lies cysts the nature of
[1:12:32] humanity and we could dwell on that and
[1:12:35] talk about how bad we were and how
[1:12:37] desperately we needed a savior which is
[1:12:39] all true it did not but my brother and
[1:12:42] sister I think there's something even
[1:12:43] greater to talk about than that
[1:12:45] that there is an anointing that comes
[1:12:47] upon us to put into action the very word
[1:12:50] of God for our hour amen it's not about
[1:12:52] what I was but it's what God said I
[1:12:54] would be and so I don't look back to
[1:12:56] what I was but I look at to the
[1:12:58] anointing of God that is upon my life
[1:13:00] upon your life that is causing me to
[1:13:03] change amen empowering me to take step
[1:13:06] after step two moves it doing its
[1:13:08] drawing us I tell you there's been times
[1:13:11] in my life I've quit I wouldn't say I
[1:13:13] quit serving God but I certainly quit
[1:13:15] being a pastor quit being a minister so
[1:13:18] many times it would embarrass me in your
[1:13:19] presence if I told you that it was
[1:13:21] literally in the dozens and dozens but
[1:13:23] you don't know that amen so you look at
[1:13:25] that and realize my brother and sister
[1:13:27] there is an anointing that comes upon
[1:13:30] man or a woman a child a teenager
[1:13:32] whatever in the day that we're living
[1:13:34] that Satan would offer such a beautiful
[1:13:36] picture and he might lose you forever
[1:13:42] you'll itself to Satan's picture of who
[1:13:46] you are
[1:13:47] amen the word has come and the word has
[1:13:49] painted a picture that shows you that
[1:13:51] you are a son you are sure of God and
[1:13:54] this anointing which we know is the Holy
[1:13:56] Ghost put into action the word and it
[1:13:59] changes our lives right Amen this
[1:14:01] anointing right have you ever studied
[1:14:03] the the theorem of cause and effect Amen
[1:14:06] it's very interesting because it applies
[1:14:08] in so many portions in our life Amen now
[1:14:12] my brother and sister there always has I
[1:14:14] preached this down in Phoenix sometime
[1:14:15] back there has to be an action for there
[1:14:18] to be a reaction Amen if there was no
[1:14:21] sin in the world and then there would be
[1:14:23] no action to cause us to see and if
[1:14:25] there was no sin there but if the Holy
[1:14:27] Ghost was not here there could be no
[1:14:29] action to cause you to be subjected or
[1:14:32] submitted to the Holy Ghost
[1:14:34] so we real there is the spirits in the
[1:14:36] framework of the third because sin is
[1:14:39] ever-present amen Satan is here
[1:14:42] he has a great realm of influence and it
[1:14:46] is quite easy to serve the devil but my
[1:14:49] brother and sister I'll tell you this
[1:14:50] you will have to walk over every promise
[1:14:53] of God to get into hell amen so it's
[1:14:56] there as God is working amen his word is
[1:14:59] here and the anointing comes and it
[1:15:01] causes a cause and effect and it
[1:15:04] sometimes takes quite a while now you
[1:15:06] can take a medicine maybe you have a
[1:15:08] little something an infection and you
[1:15:11] know the doctor puts you on an
[1:15:12] antibiotic or you go on something that's
[1:15:14] natural and you're taking that you can't
[1:15:17] get up the next morning and say well my
[1:15:19] infection or my issue is gone it's got a
[1:15:22] SoCo I hope you catch this this morning
[1:15:24] it's got to soak down into every cell in
[1:15:28] your body a man that medication as it
[1:15:31] were has to reach every portion of your
[1:15:34] body it can't just go to your hand it
[1:15:36] can't just go to your foot it can't just
[1:15:39] go to your heart it's got to in
[1:15:41] permeate every portion of your body and
[1:15:44] my brother and sister I don't want just
[1:15:45] the Holy Ghost on the outside I don't
[1:15:48] want the Holy Ghost on Sunday or
[1:15:49] Wednesday
[1:15:50] I want the Holy Ghost to change me I've
[1:15:52] got an infection and it's called
[1:15:53] unbelief and that unbelief if I feed it
[1:15:56] will foster and grow but if I will allow
[1:15:59] the Holy Ghost to work its way right
[1:16:01] down into every portion of my body I
[1:16:04] will wake up one morning and it is an
[1:16:06] absolute that you cannot convince me any
[1:16:08] different I am a son of God and I will
[1:16:11] be an overcomer in the day that I live
[1:16:13] in why because it has reached every
[1:16:16] portion every fiber of my being is now
[1:16:19] given over to Jesus Christ amen without
[1:16:22] that my brother and sister will still
[1:16:24] have doubts and we'll still have fears
[1:16:25] and we will be bound by the things of
[1:16:27] this life amen so it's there I want to
[1:16:30] take this calls in effect for just a
[1:16:32] moment to bring this in this realm right
[1:16:34] here you see my brother and sister this
[1:16:35] anointing that comes upon mankind it
[1:16:38] will come in such a and oftentimes we
[1:16:40] don't even recognize we're anointed and
[1:16:42] in that I will say that sometimes you
[1:16:44] will find people they will treat people
[1:16:46] they love they won't treat them very
[1:16:48] well and over time when they get
[1:16:50] delivered from that they'll look back
[1:16:52] and say how did I ever do that
[1:16:53] I know people in that condition how did
[1:16:56] I ever treat my wife or my children like
[1:16:58] that my brother and sister there's a
[1:16:59] brother back east it's a long story but
[1:17:02] uh you know the brother when he got
[1:17:04] delivered one day God just come down
[1:17:06] supernaturally delivered from that and
[1:17:08] the very first thing that he realized
[1:17:09] this I've done my wife and my children
[1:17:11] such a great harm in such a disrespect
[1:17:14] and the very first thing even before he
[1:17:16] actually you might say went back to
[1:17:17] church and got everything right he went
[1:17:19] to knelt down got on his knees before
[1:17:21] his wife and said I I don't know how or
[1:17:24] why I done this but I have done you so
[1:17:26] wrong please forgive me but see he was
[1:17:30] under an influence and he did he didn't
[1:17:31] even realize that anointing was causing
[1:17:33] him a man who felt justified so my
[1:17:36] brother and sister calls in effect comes
[1:17:38] and an anointing would come and I'd
[1:17:40] leave this analogy or example before we
[1:17:43] move on why is it that some are anointed
[1:17:46] to curse and take the name of our Lord
[1:17:48] Jesus Christ in vain people who looked
[1:17:53] you in the eye and say I am
[1:17:55] and use the name of Jesus Christ in vain
[1:17:59] there's got to be an anointing there got
[1:18:03] to be something that's that's causing
[1:18:04] them where they can't see I mean it's
[1:18:06] right in Scripture all they got to do is
[1:18:07] read their Bible but that anointing
[1:18:10] that's on them it's just another word my
[1:18:12] brother and sister never let us bring
[1:18:14] that as just another word amen while
[1:18:16] others are anointed to lift up the name
[1:18:18] of Jesus Christ and to praise Him and
[1:18:20] just sell their life out to him this my
[1:18:22] brother and sister the two spirits in
[1:18:24] the framework of the church amen
[1:18:26] one being drawn to step over the word in
[1:18:29] this direction one being drawn to step
[1:18:31] over the word in this direction you say
[1:18:33] well brother Paul you use the phrase
[1:18:34] step over the word that's right my
[1:18:36] brother and sister you'll either stay
[1:18:37] way away from the veil stepping into the
[1:18:39] things of this world or you will step
[1:18:41] beyond the veil amen so you've got a
[1:18:43] step beyond that divide one side or the
[1:18:45] other no such thing as the middle road
[1:18:47] amen hallelujah amen John John James 4:7
[1:18:53] amen
[1:18:54] says submit yourselves therefore to God
[1:18:57] I think that's one of the problems we
[1:18:58] have we believe God we testify about God
[1:19:02] we won't submit to him amen we don't
[1:19:05] really want to control our life we just
[1:19:06] want him to bless it come on I don't
[1:19:11] want to speak harshly to you this
[1:19:12] morning but look if you if you find
[1:19:14] yourself not obedient to the word but
[1:19:16] asking God for blessings you need to
[1:19:18] stop and figure out where you were at
[1:19:19] amen because we are called to submit
[1:19:22] ourselves therefore to God resist the
[1:19:24] devil and he will flee from you you
[1:19:27] realize that as a simplest recipe that
[1:19:29] was ever given but it's a hard one to
[1:19:31] fulfill amen the devil he comes and he
[1:19:35] talks and he's such a sweetheart you
[1:19:40] know one thing I learned I hope you see
[1:19:43] the humor in this
[1:19:44] sister Jerry and I being in the South
[1:19:46] years ago and you know maybe somebody
[1:19:50] would say something about that guy I
[1:19:52] remember I remember the first time I
[1:19:54] heard this you know there's like well
[1:19:56] that man acts like a fool
[1:20:00] bless his heart
[1:20:03] I thought that's a strange saying but I
[1:20:08] heard it a lot down there in the South
[1:20:10] yeah
[1:20:12] guys a real jerk bless his heart she's
[1:20:16] lazier than a slug bless her heart
[1:20:19] finally I was like ask one friends of
[1:20:23] ours I said yes so what's the deal this
[1:20:24] bless your heart well that's when you
[1:20:28] know you shouldn't have said what you
[1:20:29] said but you kind of just cover it up a
[1:20:32] little bit I don't want to hear any
[1:20:38] bless your hearts around here
[1:20:39] I want to hear God bless you I want to
[1:20:43] hear you I love you in the Lord but
[1:20:45] let's just let's not let that bless your
[1:20:46] heart thing creep into the church right
[1:20:48] amen another brother called it
[1:20:53] respectable slander yeah the Michell
[1:20:59] ourselves therefore to God resist the
[1:21:01] devil he will flee from you draw nigh to
[1:21:04] God see this is what I said earlier here
[1:21:07] there has to be an action on our part we
[1:21:09] can't just sit back and say God's going
[1:21:11] to take care of all this but right here
[1:21:12] it's telling us you draw nigh to God in
[1:21:16] other words you got to pick up from
[1:21:17] wherever you're sitting and you've got
[1:21:19] to move a little bit now you say brother
[1:21:20] Paul I've had some difficulties and I
[1:21:22] some things and I just don't know that I
[1:21:25] can just completely just go well look
[1:21:27] just move an inch if that's all you can
[1:21:30] move move an inch I heard a brother one
[1:21:32] time you said look you people you won't
[1:21:34] hardly you want God to do something for
[1:21:35] you you won't do nothing for God why
[1:21:37] don't you at least list a finger amen if
[1:21:39] those if the preacher is preaching
[1:21:40] everybody's lifting their hands but you
[1:21:42] don't feel like lifting your hand at
[1:21:44] least lift a finger draw nigh to God and
[1:21:51] He will draw nigh to you see that's all
[1:21:53] it takes for us to do just start drawing
[1:21:55] nigh to him cleanse your hands you
[1:21:57] sinners purify your hearts you
[1:21:59] double-minded amen you know what we can
[1:22:02] look at this and say well praise the
[1:22:03] Lord that's for all those unbelievers
[1:22:05] out there but remember brothers sister
[1:22:07] it's easy for us all we got to do is let
[1:22:10] one little thing creep back into our
[1:22:12] life amen
[1:22:15] one
[1:22:16] thing come on just be an attitude come
[1:22:22] on our attitudes we love them we love
[1:22:24] them more than we love our cellphones
[1:22:27] come on you might have forgot your phone
[1:22:30] at home you might left it in the car but
[1:22:33] you didn't leave your attitude at home
[1:22:34] you didn't leave it in the car we take
[1:22:37] our attitude everywhere we go we love
[1:22:39] our attitude what if it's our attitude
[1:22:44] that is the very thing that's holding us
[1:22:45] back what if we would stop and say Lord
[1:22:49] thy will be done if we could come to
[1:22:52] that place we can literally lift our
[1:22:54] heart our hand just a finger and say
[1:22:57] Lord thy will be done you know as I've
[1:23:03] said to you church many many times if we
[1:23:06] believe we're the only ones we've got
[1:23:08] the only revelation we've got the only
[1:23:10] move of God if we've got that my brother
[1:23:12] and sister that's the wrong attitude we
[1:23:15] are sinners saved by grace and we should
[1:23:18] by the Word of God be able to look out
[1:23:21] and realize that we are here to shine
[1:23:24] our light and it's not our light it's
[1:23:27] the light as the scripture there I was
[1:23:29] going to expound on that a little bit
[1:23:30] ago that light is not us right we are
[1:23:33] the moon he is the Sun we are reflecting
[1:23:36] that light if we're reflecting anything
[1:23:38] less than the pure light that means that
[1:23:40] we're not standing in the presence of
[1:23:42] pure light don't stand up and say we're
[1:23:46] the only ones that got it look do I feel
[1:23:49] like I want to clarify that do I feel
[1:23:51] like that God's blessed us more than
[1:23:52] than what the denominational movements
[1:23:54] are now yes I do brother and sister
[1:23:57] because like I already told you I have
[1:23:58] many friends of the denominations and I
[1:24:00] see what they do and I see how they
[1:24:03] behave and I see their business
[1:24:04] practices and their family practices and
[1:24:07] the kind of Friday night family movies
[1:24:09] they watch and the music that they
[1:24:11] listen to I believe God's done something
[1:24:13] for us but if we have the truth and an
[1:24:16] arrogant spirit we're going to be just
[1:24:19] as bad off as anyone else amen you got
[1:24:22] to be say I I believe I got the truth

[1:26:12] this I'm talking to him talking about
[1:26:13] the Prophet I'm strong Bela well he said
[1:26:15] this over here and he could have used
[1:26:16] the name of Jesus Christ but he said God
[1:26:21] fine
[1:26:25] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:26:29] word was with Jesus Christ technically
[1:26:33] it was but that's not what the word says
[1:26:40] but then it turns on tells us that all
[1:26:42] things were made for and by him meaning
[1:26:47] who Jesus Christ come on let's not get
[1:26:52] let's not get so critical that we cannot
[1:26:55] catch what God's really doing Oh
[1:26:57] are you afraid to make that kind of
[1:26:59] statement no sir he promised it it's his
[1:27:01] promise no matter anything contrary to
[1:27:03] it I say it's a lie God said so that
[1:27:05] settles it it's a gift and he by
[1:27:07] yielding and he yourself to the Spirit
[1:27:11] of God God is the same Jesus is the same
[1:27:13] he works the same he lives the same he
[1:27:16] acts the same he acts in you as he would
[1:27:18] if he was here on earth I'll get that he
[1:27:21] acts in you as he would if he was right
[1:27:24] here this morning hallelujah well Jesus
[1:27:28] Christ walked into our church this
[1:27:29] morning and we all had to throw this
[1:27:31] away and throw that and hot under the
[1:27:34] blanket and I ran back out to the car
[1:27:36] and no shouldn't be that way
[1:27:39] Amen we should be living life that he's
[1:27:42] standing here because he is he acts in
[1:27:53] you as would if his here on earth and
[1:27:55] what did he say ye are the vine is that
[1:27:58] right no now stop yeah
[1:28:11] I want to take it with humour Saints you
[1:28:14] know I sometimes do that to you guys you
[1:28:16] know just throw that but look ease is
[1:28:18] that right I imagine there's a little
[1:28:20] Paul's in there I just wanted to see if
[1:28:22] I could catch you audition or what
[1:28:26] branches I am the vine hallelujah good
[1:28:34] it sank you've read the trevor thank you
[1:28:37] if he if he wasn't already my ally he
[1:28:40] certainly was on that one there Alleluia
[1:28:43] but you see we're not going to be
[1:28:45] condemned because we do that because the
[1:28:47] thing is is we relate to that scripture
[1:28:49] and we know we're a part of that but we
[1:28:51] got to get everything in its proper
[1:28:52] order and the prophets trying to put it
[1:28:54] in the right order amen you know C's
[1:28:56] shows you a little sense of humor right
[1:28:58] here amen but he wasn't being critical
[1:29:01] he just was got a sense of humor
[1:29:03] and my the day we lose our sense of
[1:29:06] humor the day we've lost our zest for
[1:29:08] life yeah you're what branches I am the
[1:29:13] vine but now the vine doesn't bear fruit
[1:29:16] does it Oh see how beautiful this is or
[1:29:19] what God's doing my brother and sister
[1:29:22] he is flowing through you and I God
[1:29:24] could have said nope I'm gonna be the
[1:29:26] life the root and bring it all up bear
[1:29:29] the fruit myself and I don't need any
[1:29:31] other fruit but he said what I want to
[1:29:33] do is I want to live through you I want
[1:29:36] my life to come so powerful through you
[1:29:39] that when people would look at you they
[1:29:41] would say I believe I have met Jesus
[1:29:43] Christ why because it would be his
[1:29:46] nature his life coming forth in us not
[1:29:50] some cold formal you know well I tell
[1:29:52] you I grew up in a church I grew up in a
[1:29:55] church my brother and sister and it
[1:29:57] fostered a great hate in I'm sorry to
[1:29:59] use that word but that's how I feel
[1:30:01] about it because there was so many
[1:30:03] brother deals and it was though he who
[1:30:06] is the most clever come out on top come
[1:30:11] on and I've said it before I'll say it
[1:30:14] again if brother deals ever invade this
[1:30:16] church I will call it right from the
[1:30:18] pulpit you'll either accept that or kick
[1:30:20] me out because I won't be silent because
[1:30:23] you can't brother
[1:30:24] deal a brother and say you've got the
[1:30:26] Holy Ghost and the love of Christ and
[1:30:28] his nature and his life in you
[1:30:31] in fact it ought to be the opposite a
[1:30:33] brother and you might disagree you want
[1:30:35] to say here brother take a greater
[1:30:37] portion nah hmm excuse me while I repent
[1:30:43] from this attitude but my brother and
[1:30:46] sister you see if he is the vine and we
[1:30:50] are the branch we have to produce what
[1:30:55] is in the vine ah we can't come and say
[1:30:58] well I believe in the vine I believe in
[1:31:00] the vine and I'm gonna produce what I
[1:31:02] want to produce no you're tapped into
[1:31:05] something else besides the love and the
[1:31:08] life of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah the
[1:31:12] branch now look me are the branches now
[1:31:14] I want to draw off of this here I
[1:31:16] actually was going to separate this in
[1:31:18] the into difference messenger sermons
[1:31:20] man I just couldn't amen
[1:31:23] the branch is energized praise the Lord
[1:31:36] I'm in church on Sunday again hope the
[1:31:40] preacher don't preach too long
[1:31:43] I'm not brave enough to shake the keys
[1:31:46] sigh or put my coat on but man I would
[1:31:51] so like to be but down to burger Danny
[1:31:53] the big double whopper Oh am I being
[1:31:59] blunt I mean to be because you're not
[1:32:04] offending the preacher you're not
[1:32:06] offending the church you're offending
[1:32:07] God and the word said that the branch is
[1:32:13] energized and whatever energy that the
[1:32:17] vine pours into the branch the branch
[1:32:20] has to then let it out my brother and
[1:32:25] sister you know we farm right out there
[1:32:27] by around a bunch of grapes amen
[1:32:30] I learned a lot of lessons out there my
[1:32:31] friend one time told me I asked him a
[1:32:34] question I said so so a what about the
[1:32:36] little foxes and he said well we don't
[1:32:38] have to
[1:32:38] Fox is here but we have little coyotes
[1:32:40] and I said so you know we're eating the
[1:32:42] grapes is that an issue he said no what
[1:32:44] it is is actually when it's dry out now
[1:32:46] this brought revelation of the scripture
[1:32:47] to me he said when it's dry out they
[1:32:50] smell the water as it is in the grape
[1:32:55] and they start chewing around the base
[1:32:59] of the plant trying to get to the water
[1:33:01] and they gird the plant and it dies this
[1:33:05] scripture says the little fox spoils the
[1:33:08] vine what do they do they gird it till
[1:33:13] there's no life left in the church no
[1:33:15] life forget the church no life left in
[1:33:17] us we're just good message we're good
[1:33:22] message and we go to church and we can
[1:33:26] say look the supernatural happened over
[1:33:27] there and look the supernatural happened
[1:33:29] over there and the supernatural went on
[1:33:30] over here where's the supernatural in
[1:33:32] you are we girded my friend Dale I said
[1:33:40] well what do you do in a plants been
[1:33:41] girded he said we rip it out of the
[1:33:42] ground
[1:33:43] it'll never produce he said but there is
[1:33:46] one hope for it if it's got good roots
[1:33:48] with no with no rot we'll sawed it off
[1:33:51] and graft in another branch Oh
[1:33:56] hallelujah I don't want to get
[1:33:58] sidetracked here this morning oh my we
[1:34:04] bring forth his life he energizes us we
[1:34:07] bring forth his life as he brings it
[1:34:09] through us whether it's the preaching of
[1:34:12] the gospel by lip or by it's seeing a
[1:34:13] vision by eye or whether whatever it is
[1:34:16] laying hands on the sick whatever it is
[1:34:17] it's Christ working through the branches
[1:34:19] of his church every office literally
[1:34:23] electrified by his presence hallelujah
[1:34:27] now we got some company today and I
[1:34:30] don't want to get too carried away so
[1:34:32] anyway but look my brother and sister we
[1:34:34] ought to be an electrified church well
[1:34:37] we ought not be some just dead letter
[1:34:39] people that we believe a message and
[1:34:40] God's going to come back and take us in
[1:34:42] a rapture and all these other poor sorry
[1:34:44] folks I tell you what my brother and
[1:34:46] sister if you're in that position then

[1:35:13] thank you for all being part of my story
[1:35:17] today you see I don't have an attitude

[1:35:36] was born a hail it Lord help me look
[1:35:49] under attitude in the dictionary and
[1:35:51] it'll probably have a family picture but
[1:35:59] you know what God does starts to pruning
[1:36:04] pretty soon you realize you're not quite
[1:36:06] as important or quite as smart or quite
[1:36:08] as whatever is you thought you were and
[1:36:10] you realize after a while Lord you know
[1:36:14] what if it wasn't for you Lord I'd
[1:36:16] probably be or whatever out here I'd be
[1:36:20] just like them Lord if it wasn't for you

[1:37:27] say right here and if I and I if I be

[1:37:36] the drawings taking place amen now look
[1:37:40] death burial resurrection of our Lord
[1:37:41] Jesus Christ is a fulfillment of
[1:37:43] prophecy now his promise to us is he
[1:37:46] would draw us to him my brother and

[1:43:37] family I'm talking about the influences
[1:43:39] and where in my life when I was young he

[1:43:43] right back here and said here's my word
[1:43:45] stay with my word it's the road map
[1:43:48] there's no shortcut your name on a book
[1:43:52] nowhere it don't mean no more than you
[1:43:54] can write but whenever that seed of life
[1:43:58] was magnetized by the Word of God it
[1:44:01] will draw you through denomination it
[1:44:03] draws you through the thick it draws you
[1:44:05] through the thin draws you through the
[1:44:07] mud it draws you through the water of
[1:44:09] separation it just keeps it on you the
[1:44:11] word says you might have to forsake
[1:44:13] mother and father and sister and brother
[1:44:16] and houses and lands did it right that
[1:44:20] so it would return void no sir somewhere
[1:44:25] along the line there's been saints that
[1:44:26] had forsake their families forsake every
[1:44:30] possession they ever had and you say how
[1:44:32] could they do that because they were
[1:44:34] magnetized and something just kept
[1:44:37] pulling down they couldn't stop how did
[1:44:42] they do that I don't know other than a
[1:44:45] great magnet was pulling them
[1:44:48] hallelujah you know it's interesting you
[1:44:52] went to a power of a magnet now I don't
[1:44:54] remember if if I get this wrong correct
[1:44:56] me OK
[1:44:57] but I believe it's a cat-scan that if
[1:45:00] you have metal in your body it will heat
[1:45:04] it up to where you feel like you are
[1:45:05] cooking and it will do its best to pull
[1:45:08] it right up into your body because it's
[1:45:10] a giant magnet going around and around
[1:45:13] your body now just think of the power of
[1:45:16] that I knew a man once he actually older
[1:45:20] man he has quite an extensive array of
[1:45:22] tattoos and I'm not speaking against the
[1:45:25] tattoos I'm just making a point they
[1:45:27] were back in some day when there was
[1:45:29] something in the ink and so he was
[1:45:33] getting a cat scan and uh they put him
[1:45:37] in there and there tell him surly as
[1:45:39] still as you can blah blah only take a
[1:45:40] minute
[1:45:41] they fired that thing he said it made
[1:45:43] one revolution and he couldn't help
[1:45:45] himself he screamed so loud they heard
[1:45:48] him in the hallways and they stopped it
[1:45:52] and they said sir it's your arm isn't it
[1:45:56] he said oh he said it felt like it was a
[1:45:59] thousand prickles of heat and it felt
[1:46:02] like my skin was being pulled
[1:46:08] now if man's invention will do that to
[1:46:12] the human body what will be the Creator
[1:46:15] when he starts to pull on the heart of a
[1:46:18] son or daughter of God well he couldn't
[1:46:21] be me I'm in this terrible condition I'm
[1:46:24] in this terrible situation it couldn't
[1:46:25] be me Oh you just watch it starts
[1:46:29] pulling and it keeps right on pulling
[1:46:31] and it might take years to pull you from
[1:46:34] that mud hole but it'll pull you right
[1:46:36] out of that mud hole can we say thank
[1:46:38] you lord
[1:46:39] Alleluia oh my can I have just another
[1:46:42] minute or two
[1:46:43] amen it'll go right in here just want to
[1:46:46] expound this a little bit be a little
[1:46:47] bit redundant sometimes it's good be
[1:46:49] redundant amen you know sometimes I mean
[1:46:52] I have employees you know and you'll
[1:46:54] tell them and something you just realize
[1:46:57] they didn't catch it and you feel
[1:46:58] awkward right because you just can't
[1:47:00] spend ten minutes explaining and
[1:47:02] you know it's gonna take another ten
[1:47:03] minutes to explain it but you feel
[1:47:05] compelled to explain it again and some
[1:47:08] employees will say I got it I got it and
[1:47:10] then they go out mess it up others will
[1:47:13] say to themselves if he wants to pay me
[1:47:18] for listening to him explain it again I
[1:47:20] mean no problem redundancy is a bad
[1:47:26] thing and a good thing hallelujah there
[1:47:30] is a great magnet sitting in the sky
[1:47:32] that God one day will touch his fingers
[1:47:34] to no man knows the time he's coming not
[1:47:37] even the angels of heaven don't know God
[1:47:40] alone knows but there has been some
[1:47:42] trimmings that's come off of the Bible
[1:47:44] Bible Christians believers for this hour
[1:47:47] and one of them might have been an axle
[1:47:50] you got a for real careful to catch what
[1:47:52] prophets say he's talking about this
[1:47:54] same time that he spent in the foundry
[1:47:56] right one of them might have been an
[1:48:01] axle back in another day this might have
[1:48:04] been some other part it's going on to
[1:48:06] make the great big regime of God but
[1:48:10] it'll be molded into the pot of God's
[1:48:12] great Coppola and poured out again into
[1:48:15] the image of God are you with him in
[1:48:19] other words you're saying it didn't
[1:48:21] matter what you was before you're just
[1:48:23] an axle you were just something trimmed
[1:48:26] off here you were just some here but
[1:48:29] when you're put back through the word
[1:48:30] and you get poured out and you come out
[1:48:34] in the image of God and those who are
[1:48:36] magnetized to it will be taken up Oh how
[1:48:39] - what a privilege it is to know that
[1:48:41] there's something in the resurrection
[1:48:43] that's pertaining to us now notice
[1:48:47] recognize the call of God's word which
[1:48:49] he is a part of and it's an eagle - an
[1:48:52] eagle now if that mother would have
[1:48:53] screamed like a buzzard
[1:49:01] I look some fairly strong things in the
[1:49:04] last few weeks Saints when one screams
[1:49:08] like a buzzard what are you going to
[1:49:11] attract I'm not talking about people no
[1:49:17] don't misunderstand me talk about
[1:49:19] spirits you got sons and daughters of
[1:49:24] God they cannot respond to anything that
[1:49:27] is not the Word of God God put it in us
[1:49:32] we have to respond to it
[1:49:34] I heard the cry of an evil I'm an evil
[1:49:37] huh you know you're an eagle I
[1:49:39] understood how do you know you're a son
[1:49:42] or daughter of God
[1:49:43] because the word is coming real to you
[1:49:46] the word is manifesting itself in you
[1:49:49] and you realize the only way I could
[1:49:52] respond to this is I am a daughter of
[1:49:55] God I am a son of God that's why it
[1:49:59] makes sense Oh hallelujah yeah I might
[1:50:08] have been an axle I don't even really
[1:50:10] care I could have been a rusty pull
[1:50:12] brakes you when I've been melted down
[1:50:15] remoulded poured out again and now I get
[1:50:18] to come forth in the image of Jesus
[1:50:20] Christ hallelujah Oh hallelujah amen
[1:50:25] amen
[1:50:26] eagle to an eagle now if that mother
[1:50:27] would have screamed like a buzzard he
[1:50:29] didn't never knowed it
[1:50:30] he's just been as oh this see this is
[1:50:33] really pointed actually you know people
[1:50:34] don't like pointed remarks my brother
[1:50:36] and sister but I'm not saying the
[1:50:37] pointed remark so that's my excuse hey
[1:50:40] man hey what the mothers screamed like a
[1:50:43] buzzard he never knowed it
[1:50:44] he didn't bend just as well off in the
[1:50:47] barnyard see if you start responding to
[1:50:50] the Buzzard
[1:50:51] you might as well just stay in the
[1:50:53] barnyard don't go out here and tell
[1:50:56] these people if you don't believe this
[1:50:58] you're this and you're that my brother
[1:50:59] and sister come on come on God's warning
[1:51:03] control amen but it was the scream of an
[1:51:07] eagle there was something inside that
[1:51:09] little fellow that he knowed he was an
[1:51:11] eagle Oh hallelujah
[1:51:14] hallelujah and the same thing is with
[1:51:16] every true believer when the preaching
[1:51:18] of God's Word come forth and is
[1:51:20] indicated and prove that it's God's Word
[1:51:22] for this hour then there's something
[1:51:23] within the believer can someone say amen
[1:51:26] to that I don't care how loyal his
[1:51:28] father was to a church how loyal his
[1:51:31] mother was or his grandparents or if
[1:51:33] that church is teaching contrary to this
[1:51:35] hour of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:51:37] message there's something in him that
[1:51:39] screams out look let's get this right
[1:51:42] what is he saying this is a relationship
[1:51:44] between you and Almighty God it's not a
[1:51:48] relationship between you and a prophet
[1:51:50] and you and a pastor you and of this and
[1:51:53] a you and of that it's between you and
[1:51:56] God hallelujah we got to cut to the
[1:52:01] chase of all this well if you don't go
[1:52:03] to this church and you don't do this and
[1:52:05] you don't believe that and you don't do
[1:52:06] this my brother and sister if you are
[1:52:08] called of God you respond to that Paul
[1:52:11] the Eagle scream and the Eagles cry back
[1:52:14] and you that he said I'll lead you and
[1:52:16] guide you to alter oh you know what I
[1:52:18] don't I don't mean to belabor this but
[1:52:20] it just keeps coming up someone might
[1:52:22] say well you've got way too much
[1:52:24] confidence in that tell me how we can
[1:52:28] have too much confidence in God he said
[1:52:30] I will lead you I will guide you this
[1:52:34] work I began in you I will finish it
[1:52:38] they don't get any more confidence than
[1:52:41] that my brother and sister they don't
[1:52:43] get to a place that you've got anything
[1:52:45] else an anchor to but the Word of God
[1:52:48] and the cry that you have heard
[1:52:51] hallelujah does that mean we can go off
[1:52:54] the word I heard the cry I heard the cry
[1:52:56] now now I'm this and I'm that all bow
[1:52:59] down and worship me they'd have to put a
[1:53:02] new door in the side of this building
[1:53:03] because you'd be out of here so quick
[1:53:05] and it should be rightly so or maybe I'd
[1:53:08] be the one that created the new doors
[1:53:10] you threw me out know if they don't line
[1:53:15] up with the word Saints if you can't
[1:53:19] take it back to the Bible then it didn't
[1:53:22] come from God
[1:53:31] the chicken oh let me find myself I'm
[1:53:36] lost there's something in him that
[1:53:38] screams out he'll leave the barnyard
[1:53:40] he's got to do it the chicken might have
[1:53:42] been alright one day but this is Eagle
[1:53:44] our see it's a difference there's
[1:53:46] something he must leave the old coop and
[1:53:48] fly away into the blue then this earthly
[1:53:50] body is quickened and brought by the
[1:53:51] quickening spirit to the obedience of
[1:53:53] God's Word my brother and sister I'll
[1:53:56] just put it this way I've said it before
[1:53:57] I'll just share it again this is my
[1:54:01] understanding okay I'm not trying to say
[1:54:02] it's a revelation I'm gonna say to have
[1:54:04] some great understanding but you know it
[1:54:06] was brought up to you one time brother
[1:54:08] Paul how was it when brother Branham had
[1:54:10] these meetings power of God come
[1:54:13] discernment of the Spirit healings took
[1:54:15] place sometimes thousands of witnesses
[1:54:19] to these men brother Brown turns around
[1:54:22] and tells him now go back to your church
[1:54:25] be faithful at your post of duty had a
[1:54:30] brother asked me one time younger
[1:54:31] brother he's Paul how could how did why
[1:54:35] did brother Brown do that how could he
[1:54:37] do that cuz you see this eagle it's not
[1:54:43] gonna stay in that barn you're right you
[1:54:47] don't need to proselyte in fact I tell
[1:54:50] you my brother and sister I look to the
[1:54:52] lowest degree of proselyte yes I'm
[1:54:55] talking about in its true form I'm not
[1:54:58] talking about a friend or family member
[1:54:59] encouraging somebody to come worship
[1:55:01] with us I'm talking about proselyting
[1:55:05] how can their prophet knew the minute
[1:55:10] these people that had heard the cry went
[1:55:13] and set back down and their church said
[1:55:16] the days of miracles are past just sign
[1:55:19] your name on the book be faithful come
[1:55:21] give a little money to our charity come
[1:55:24] to this event that event look my family
[1:55:28] was Methodist for quite long time I'm
[1:55:32] not so old or young however you look at
[1:55:35] it to not remember what
[1:55:36] like to be a Methodist we went to church
[1:55:39] and they cared about us children's much
[1:55:42] they let us go running up and down the
[1:55:45] back halls of the church where no one
[1:55:46] could hear us young people I love you so
[1:55:51] much I'm gonna preach and make you
[1:55:54] endure hearing me talk about Jesus
[1:55:56] Christ because I love you so much a good
[1:56:06] friend of Mines wife had cancer she was
[1:56:09] dying the doctor said there's absolutely
[1:56:11] not one hope he asked everybody he
[1:56:15] didn't care what church he went to he
[1:56:18] picked up his Bible one day and God took
[1:56:21] him right to that scripture and he said
[1:56:25] this is real God's a healer he didn't go
[1:56:28] around say now are you Episcopalian
[1:56:30] that's what he was are you piss Kop
[1:56:32] alien do you believe in this no he
[1:56:35] didn't everybody that stopped moving for
[1:56:38] a moment pray for my wife pray for my
[1:56:40] wife pray for my wife pray for my wife
[1:56:43] now I'll sound judgmental here I hope
[1:56:46] this won't offend Owen but he went to a
[1:56:49] church they stopped halfway through and
[1:56:51] half the church went out on the back
[1:56:53] portico smoked a cigarette because they
[1:56:56] couldn't make it for a flower cigarette
[1:56:59] and included the preacher now you wonder
[1:57:04] how things get confusing he had
[1:57:07] everybody that he ever met in his life
[1:57:09] all the wave from the hardware store to
[1:57:12] the lumber store to the Builder that we
[1:57:14] worked for to everybody pray for my wife
[1:57:17] and one day his wife got so sick and she
[1:57:20] literally was telling him honey come
[1:57:22] give me a kiss and a hug it's over and
[1:57:27] he thought it can't be
[1:57:28] I believe that Scripture
[1:57:33] she lives through the night the next day
[1:57:37] she got up and said honey would I'm
[1:57:39] dying anyhow what's it matter about
[1:57:41] diets and all this stuff I like some
[1:57:44] toast with butter and jam on it and he
[1:57:47] was like whatever you want honey could I
[1:57:50] have a cup of coffee also the Prophet
[1:57:54] God talks about these same Saints people
[1:57:57] criticize the Prophet for talking the
[1:57:58] way he does but if they'll open their
[1:58:00] eyes and their ears wander through this
[1:58:02] world you'll find out that God is doing
[1:58:04] the very things the Prophet talked about
[1:58:06] right out here and I don't always have
[1:58:09] the name message attached to it because
[1:58:11] if you have faith in God come on is this
[1:58:16] too one message for us his wife is alive
[1:58:20] today as far as I know now you tell him
[1:58:25] that living the way he lives is not
[1:58:27] right and I have this friend my friend's
[1:58:33] name was Larry Larry you can't lie
[1:58:34] you're gonna be a Christian you can't
[1:58:37] tell lies God healed my wife Larry you
[1:58:41] can't steal God healed my wife don't
[1:58:46] tell me God won't he healed my wife you
[1:58:49] see where that became a bridge in his
[1:58:51] life but it won't line up with the word
[1:58:55] of God but now not sound bad
[1:58:59] last time I saw Larry he ran up to me
[1:59:02] threw his arms around me lifted me off
[1:59:04] the ground well it's so good to see you

[2:15:31] thing that I forgot I just now
[2:15:33] remembered it meant to announce this at
[2:15:35] the start of the service I have my own
[2:15:39] way of designating stuff so if you be
[2:15:41] kind and not laugh at me brother Sergei
[2:15:45] senior is you Leah's father brother
[2:15:50] Sergei jr. is her husband and that's how
[2:15:55] I operate my little world to keep them
[2:15:57] but I was talking with sister yulia's
[2:15:59] dad brother Sergei soon senior and he's
[2:16:04] sharing with me
[2:16:04] that believers in the rural parts Russia
[2:16:09] Ukraine some of those other countries I
[2:16:11] always slips my mind those other ones
[2:16:14] I'm forgive me they're having a just a
[2:16:17] terrible time Saints brother Sergei was
[2:16:20] sharing with me of a brother calling not
[2:16:22] even able to completely recount the
[2:16:25] situation's they're dealing with before
[2:16:27] he broke down we need to lift them up
[2:16:30] diligently in our prayers
[2:16:33] amen we're going to do more than just
[2:16:35] lift him up in prayers we have already
[2:16:38] financially helped them we don't say
[2:16:41] anything like that to boast but just
[2:16:44] simply the burden is great and now this
[2:16:46] might come out awkward to forgive me but
[2:16:50] we have the representation of that part
[2:16:53] of the world right here in our midst
[2:16:54] amen we have families that that these
[2:16:58] people are not unknown to them they are
[2:17:00] not just casual someone there it's real
[2:17:04] and we also are getting feedback from
[2:17:07] believers that we are very personally
[2:17:09] almost as close as family to us in South
[2:17:12] America that in their little towns
[2:17:14] almost every bit of work has ceased and
[2:17:18] there is nothing for them to do you
[2:17:21] can't beg a job we need to lift them up
[2:17:25] we need to be praying for them and we
[2:17:29] will be I will be working with the
[2:17:31] brothers and we'll be working to find a
[2:17:34] solution you might say in the financial
[2:17:36] sign to help some of these believers but
[2:17:40] the money is good money's good I have on
[2:17:44] my phone if you don't mind me just
[2:17:46] sharing this brother Sergei Senior
[2:17:49] Center brother Sergei jr. my precious
[2:17:52] brother videos I have on my phone of
[2:17:56] believers saying thank you it stirs your
[2:18:01] heart whether Sergei says brother Paul
[2:18:03] you don't need to know Russia to
[2:18:05] understand how appreciative they are and
[2:18:07] they are speaking and I don't understand
[2:18:10] one single word they're saying but you
[2:18:13] can see the sincerity let's be faithful
[2:18:16] Saints just as we can look across the
[2:18:19] aisle or down the Pew or front to back
[2:18:20] here and say you know what I'm praying
[2:18:22] for my brother and praying for my sister
[2:18:24] don't forget another part of the body of
[2:18:26] believers is outside of our state
[2:18:28] outside of our nation outside of our
[2:18:30] continent okay let's be faithful to lift
[2:18:35] them up before the Lord hallelujah god
