[51:16] sister we can look back in history and
[51:18] say well our lord is resurrected that's
[51:21] beautiful that's wonderful but we have
[51:23] to have him
[51:24] resurrected and you and i
[51:26] he needs to be living
[51:28] in our heart today it's just not a form
[51:31] of religion my brother and sister we
[51:33] don't have a tradition that god sent a
[51:35] prophet we have a living through the
[51:37] years
[51:38] uh saints i have you know oftentimes to
[51:40] kind of joke about
[51:42] unspoken prayer requests but you know
[51:44] sometimes
[51:48] pardon me
[51:49] sometimes there's things that are just
[51:51] so delicate
[51:52] things that are so personal to
[51:54] individuals that that we we don't want
[51:56] to speak them out but we covet your
[51:59] prayers concerning these things and
[52:01] uh many of these prayer requests of as
[52:05] they have been conveyed
[52:07] uh or are you might say
[52:09] kind of serious situations things that
[52:11] influence lives and change directions of
[52:14] lives and so just ask you to lift those
[52:17] up in prayer amen i want to speak to you
[52:19] this morning
[52:20] on the words as a title in whom i am
[52:24] well pleased as we'll take this from the
[52:26] book of matthew
[52:28] and uh
[52:29] it is their brother and sister that how
[52:32] beautiful these words were when they
[52:34] were spoken and i say thank you to the
[52:36] musicians the song service
[52:38] i especially was blessed by the specials
[52:41] amen how beautiful
[52:43] amen and we look at this my brother and
[52:46] sister and what's as i said most
[52:48] important is the resurrection is alive
[52:50] and you and i
[52:51] and this morning i'm not going to preach
[52:53] as it were on the resurrection our lord
[52:56] jesus amen he did exactly according to
[52:59] the word of god but there was a reason
[53:02] he did that it wasn't just that he would
[53:04] go and die and be resurrected but my
[53:06] brother and sister there was a people as
[53:09] we will uh with the lord helping us
[53:12] we'll touch on this morning just a
[53:14] reminder to stir up our pure minds
[53:17] to recognize who we are
[53:19] and where we fit in the body of christ
[53:22] amen the world you know i find it
[53:24] interesting and i say this a little bit
[53:26] joking
[53:27] you know you'll see a young man
[53:29] you know and he's wearing a jersey
[53:31] that's just way too big and it's got
[53:33] somebody else's name on the back it's
[53:35] got the number of a famous player and
[53:37] it's got you know somebody else's name
[53:39] on the back and and they paid a lot of
[53:41] money sometimes you know in the hundreds
[53:43] of dollars for these jerseys and
[53:45] and
[53:47] they're never going to be that
[53:48] individual
[53:50] they're never going to possess the
[53:52] ability of that individual
[53:55] it really is an identity crisis
[53:59] their identity is not in themselves
[54:02] it's in another individual
[54:04] but the word come in our hour my brother
[54:06] and sister not for us to walk around
[54:08] with someone else's name
[54:11] but to walk identified in jesus christ
[54:14] and when we walk identified in jesus
[54:16] christ we get to express as it were the
[54:19] personality that god placed in us in
[54:21] other words we don't have to conform and
[54:24] and if you know some of you are serious
[54:26] some of you are looking at me very
[54:27] serious so i'm assuming that at least 75
[54:29] percent of you are very serious people
[54:33] but you're not
[54:35] some of you are very happy some are very
[54:37] funny very articulate
[54:41] and we get to serve god with all our
[54:43] heart mind body and soul
[54:45] and be that individual that god made you
[54:49] amen not conforming to this world but
[54:52] just conforming as it were to the gospel
[54:55] of jesus christ and i i'm happy because
[54:58] you see i don't want to be you
[55:01] and i can assure you you don't want to
[55:04] be men because i am
[55:07] old
[55:08] overweight and going bald
[55:10] you don't want to be me
[55:14] but in that other context if you catch
[55:16] what i'm saying you want to be me
[55:18] and i want to be you
[55:20] because we are the family the
[55:24] body of jesus christ manifest on the
[55:27] earth today isn't that beautiful
[55:30] hallelujah i get to be a part of
[55:31] something a part of the team but i still
[55:34] get to be me
[55:35] amen hallelujah let's turn matthew the
[55:38] third chapter verse 13 through 17.
[55:41] amen
[55:42] ask the lord's blessings on the service
[55:44] today
[55:48] then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan
[55:50] unto john to be baptized of him
[55:54] but john forbade him
[55:57] now we see this same attribute showed up
[56:00] in peter right jesus said you you need
[56:03] to
[56:04] wash my feet and i'll wash your feet and
[56:06] peter's like no no no we can't go there
[56:09] because you see they were looking in the
[56:11] human element
[56:12] and here is john now looking
[56:15] because he's been given identification
[56:17] by the holy spirit of what to look for
[56:19] and he's now saw the sign and he's
[56:22] saying oh my this is him and no i i
[56:25] can't i need baptized of you
[56:28] john forbade him saying i have need to
[56:30] be baptized of thee and cometh thou to
[56:33] me
[56:34] and jesus answering said unto him
[56:37] suffer it to be so now now this word
[56:40] suffer in this context would tolerate it
[56:43] or allow this to happen
[56:48] for thus it becometh us to fulfill all
[56:50] righteousness then he suffered him and
[56:53] jesus when he was baptized went up
[56:55] straightway out of the water and lo
[56:58] the heavens were parted or opened unto
[57:01] him and he saw the spirit of god
[57:03] descending like a dove and lighting upon
[57:06] him and lo a voice from heaven saying
[57:09] this is my beloved son
[57:11] in whom i am well pleased amen heavenly
[57:15] father we thank you for the opportunity
[57:17] to come together
[57:18] lord just open your word to our hearts
[57:20] today i pray in your name amen
[57:23] you may be seated saints
[57:26] i would like to now just go
[57:28] a few verses further in matthew to the
[57:31] 12th chapter
[57:32] and starting with the 17th verse
[57:36] another
[57:38] you might say scriptural
[57:41] indicator
[57:43] of the season
[57:45] and that it was the correct time and the
[57:47] correct ones that were fulfilling the
[57:49] word of god
[57:51] matthew 12 17 that it might be fulfilled
[57:54] which was spoken by isaiah's the prophet
[57:56] so this is prophecy coming to pass
[57:59] behold my servant
[58:01] whom i have chosen my beloved in whom my
[58:05] soul is well pleased
[58:08] i will put my spirit upon him and he
[58:10] shall show judgment to the gentiles
[58:13] he shall not strive nor cry neither
[58:16] shall any man hear his voice in the
[58:18] streets a bruised reed
[58:20] shall he not break a smoking flock shall
[58:23] he not quench till he send forth
[58:25] judgment into victory
[58:28] and in his name shall the gentiles trust
[58:32] you see the first portion of these
[58:33] verses could be identified as it were
[58:36] with john
[58:37] but my brother and sister it was not in
[58:40] john's name that we trust it was in the
[58:42] name of the lord jesus christ and so we
[58:45] look at this scripture and we see that
[58:47] it's going to come a time my brother and
[58:49] sister that he's going to bring forth
[58:51] judgment into victory and you'd say well
[58:54] we're looking for that day i'm here to
[58:56] tell you my brother and sister that day
[58:57] has already been fulfilled in your life
[59:00] when you yourself were able to look into
[59:02] the mirror of god's word and judge
[59:05] yourself and say i need something more
[59:07] than i've got in my life and it come and
[59:10] a life-changing event amen the baptism
[59:13] of the holy ghost coming upon you
[59:15] brought you into victory now my brother
[59:18] and sister i i don't want to speak how
[59:19] to turn to anyone or offend anyone today
[59:22] but let's not be mistaken that just
[59:24] believing god sent a prophet is the
[59:26] victory that this scripture is speaking
[59:28] about this is a personal manifestation
[59:31] of jesus christ in your life this is you
[59:35] having victory in the world that we live
[59:38] in today and you we often times that say
[59:41] well we need to pray for our young
[59:42] people my brother and sister we need to
[59:45] pray for our young people there's a lot
[59:47] of spirits out there but we need to be
[59:49] praying for everyone because those
[59:51] spirits don't have an age where they cut
[59:53] off their influence there's people that
[59:55] are young and old that are being
[59:57] influenced by the spirit of this day
[59:59] that we live in and so it's there i pray
[1:00:02] each one of us would be brave enough to
[1:00:04] look into the mirror of the word and say
[1:00:06] you know what lord i want to be judged i
[1:00:09] want to judge myself because i want to
[1:00:11] move from judgment into victory
[1:00:14] but too many people my brother and
[1:00:16] sister as the scripture said if your
[1:00:17] heart condemns you not then you have
[1:00:19] confidence in god too many people come
[1:00:22] to church too often living their life
[1:00:24] under a cloud of condemnation i'm not
[1:00:27] worthy lord i did this and i thought
[1:00:29] that and this and have my brother and
[1:00:31] sister it's time do the judgment and
[1:00:33] come into the victory where you can then
[1:00:36] with confidence come before the throne
[1:00:38] of almighty god and claim that promise
[1:00:40] amen to be able as it were just to come
[1:00:43] there without saying oh i'm not worthy
[1:00:45] i'm not worthy but to come and say you
[1:00:47] know what this is what the word
[1:00:49] foreordained before the foundation of
[1:00:52] the world a position that literally has
[1:00:54] my name on it
[1:00:56] now imagine some people think this is
[1:00:58] far-fetched but i'm sorry some of us
[1:01:00] need just an encouragement and and uh
[1:01:03] you know for years i have just taken it
[1:01:05] this position i believe there's a spot
[1:01:08] before the throne on the sea of crystal
[1:01:10] that literally
[1:01:11] has my name on it
[1:01:13] this is not figurative i have taken this
[1:01:16] you might say brother paul really
[1:01:17] where's the foundation of that well i'll
[1:01:19] tell you i'm going to be there my name
[1:01:21] is in his book and you say amen to that
[1:01:24] and so if he ordained you before the
[1:01:27] foundation of the world to receive the
[1:01:30] word and be filled with the holy ghost
[1:01:32] then i personally take it a step further
[1:01:34] that he ordained a place on the sea of
[1:01:36] crystal before the throne for you
[1:01:39] this is not going to be a um what what
[1:01:42] is that a red light or whatever it is
[1:01:45] that walmart kmart used to do you know
[1:01:47] where where you'd be in this store
[1:01:51] blue light okay amen
[1:01:54] you know i've been one time there
[1:01:56] i actually witnessed this and you're
[1:01:58] walking through the store i was going to
[1:01:59] the sporting goods department just so
[1:02:01] you'll know
[1:02:02] and um
[1:02:04] over here is a you know light starts
[1:02:06] flashing this was in the old k mark
[1:02:08] and the light starts flashing and my it
[1:02:11] looked like a riot people are just
[1:02:15] and they're over fighting over stuff and
[1:02:17] finally one lady and another and both
[1:02:18] had a look at it and the other one's
[1:02:20] like i don't even know why i'm fighting
[1:02:22] you for this
[1:02:27] there's an anointing
[1:02:29] oh let that anointing my brother and
[1:02:31] sister magnified by the word by the holy
[1:02:33] spirit come down on you and i that we
[1:02:35] would look at the word and say that is
[1:02:37] mine
[1:02:38] that is mine i won't stop until i have
[1:02:40] possessed this
[1:02:42] amen and as we move forward amen we'll
[1:02:45] look at these and see how god is so
[1:02:47] great
[1:02:48] now as we come here this might be
[1:02:50] fulfilled which was spoken by isaiah the
[1:02:52] prophet saying behold my servant whom i
[1:02:55] have chosen my beloved
[1:02:58] so this is god making identity in jesus
[1:03:02] christ now we know by the word my
[1:03:04] brother and sister that this is god in
[1:03:07] flesh but what god is saying when he
[1:03:09] makes this declaration that i have
[1:03:12] confidence and have placed a perfect
[1:03:15] witness before the people this is not a
[1:03:19] substitute this is perfection
[1:03:22] amen
[1:03:24] my son whom i'm well pleased yes
[1:03:27] he
[1:03:28] in the flesh is a perfect
[1:03:30] representation of
[1:03:32] me
[1:03:34] can we grasp that people can get
[1:03:36] confused in the godhead pretty easy my
[1:03:38] brother and sister but it was
[1:03:41] god
[1:03:42] in flesh
[1:03:44] wasn't a second part not a third part
[1:03:46] not another party it was god himself
[1:03:49] and so he says as my beloved whom my
[1:03:51] soul is well pleased i will put my
[1:03:53] spirit upon him
[1:03:55] now look my brother and sister i want
[1:03:57] you to understand that in this by
[1:04:00] putting his spirit upon him you see now
[1:04:03] that this is the perfect attribute of
[1:04:06] the nature
[1:04:08] of god amen
[1:04:10] perfect
[1:04:12] you see my brother and sister in the
[1:04:14] world we live in you can even buy a
[1:04:16] first uh production of something
[1:04:20] but nothing ever is a perfect
[1:04:22] representation
[1:04:24] right in the world of mass production
[1:04:28] you've got a machine that's making this
[1:04:31] but yet
[1:04:32] not one
[1:04:33] will be a perfect replica
[1:04:36] of the original
[1:04:39] but god was giving the endorsement that
[1:04:41] this is a perfect replica of my spirit
[1:04:45] this is me
[1:04:48] in the flesh
[1:04:49] this is not just a representation of me
[1:04:52] in the flesh this is me in the flesh
[1:04:56] amen so he's there he's he's going to
[1:04:58] show judgment to the gentiles but look
[1:05:01] how this is i just want you to catch
[1:05:03] this for a second
[1:05:07] he's not going to strive
[1:05:16] he's not going to beg
[1:05:19] he's not going to try and convince her
[1:05:22] corner
[1:05:23] because he had a perfect understanding
[1:05:26] of the seed
[1:05:35] oh i have called amen
[1:05:39] shall come
[1:05:43] young people old people you might be
[1:05:46] staggering i was visiting with the
[1:05:48] brothers last night about all in all out
[1:05:50] right the scripture says i would that
[1:05:52] you would be hot or cold
[1:05:55] because if you're lukewarm i'll spew you
[1:05:57] out of my mouth
[1:05:58] let's forget about this i'm going to try
[1:06:00] and let's be all in her all out and if i
[1:06:02] could strive with you this morning i say
[1:06:05] be all in
[1:06:06] because you see being all out doesn't
[1:06:08] lead to the result we really desire but
[1:06:10] we're all in it is a difficult fight but
[1:06:13] you know when we make our mind up that
[1:06:14] we're going to finish reminds me of one
[1:06:17] of the marathons back east there was a
[1:06:19] man there from one of the african
[1:06:21] countries and and uh something had
[1:06:23] happened he sprained his ankle or
[1:06:25] something and he's within sight of the
[1:06:27] finish line
[1:06:29] and uh he basically the pain is so great
[1:06:32] and he says i can't finish
[1:06:34] he told himself there's no way i can
[1:06:36] finish i can see i can see the finish
[1:06:38] line but there's no way i can finish and
[1:06:41] so the man is there stopped and there's
[1:06:43] pictures of him i believe you can still
[1:06:44] find them and it shows him there all
[1:06:47] hunched over leaned over and he's there
[1:06:50] and something must have sparked in his
[1:06:52] soul and he gets down on his hands and
[1:06:54] knees and starts crawling towards the
[1:06:56] finish line
[1:06:58] and someone come from the sideline and
[1:06:59] raised him back up and helped him cover
[1:07:02] that distance and then because people
[1:07:04] are so petty my brother and sister
[1:07:06] people say we want to all go to heaven
[1:07:08] but i want you to go my way
[1:07:11] and they tried to disqualify him there
[1:07:13] were those that were saying he broke the
[1:07:15] rules he had outside help he's
[1:07:16] disqualified but when it come down to
[1:07:18] the end of the day he was not the winner
[1:07:21] he was not going by this to be on the
[1:07:23] podium he was a man who had a heart to
[1:07:26] finish the race and it was there that
[1:07:28] ultimately they said for humanitarian
[1:07:30] reasons we need to honor this man's
[1:07:33] heart and he received that medal that
[1:07:35] they get for finishing the marathon and
[1:07:37] so it is my brother and sister that
[1:07:39] satan in this day will do everything
[1:07:42] within his ability to get you sidelined
[1:07:45] that you don't look at the finish line
[1:07:47] and you don't see the value of the
[1:07:49] finish line but i pray that it be so
[1:07:52] determined in your heart that if you
[1:07:54] have to get down and crawl that you will
[1:07:56] not stop until you finish this race and
[1:07:59] give your heart as it were completely to
[1:08:01] the lord jesus christ amen so it's there
[1:08:04] he's not going to strive nor cry neither
[1:08:07] shall any man hear his voice in the
[1:08:09] street a bruised reed shall he not break
[1:08:11] a smoking flax shall he not quench till
[1:08:13] he send forth judgment
[1:08:16] my brother and sister i believe this
[1:08:18] morning we look at this we have the
[1:08:20] answer for judgment
[1:08:22] we should not be sitting here this
[1:08:24] morning with a heart that is condemned
[1:08:27] we have the answer for judgment
[1:08:30] amen we are not sitting here hoping that
[1:08:33] god will find us worthy and i i hope i
[1:08:35] can make this point to you today because
[1:08:38] along this line is where we're thinking
[1:08:40] it is not for us to say well lord if i
[1:08:43] can finish this race lord if i can be
[1:08:45] pleasing i've heard people my brother
[1:08:47] and sister so concerned and i'm not
[1:08:49] speaking ill of them but so concerned
[1:08:51] that i would be deceived but the word of
[1:08:53] god says that this work was finished
[1:08:55] before the foundation of the world we
[1:08:57] are not here to worry about some wolf
[1:09:00] coming from the wilderness to deceive us
[1:09:03] it is actually revelation within our
[1:09:05] heart and soul it tells us i have
[1:09:07] already received of the lord
[1:09:10] i have already received there is nothing
[1:09:13] going to change my destiny people like
[1:09:16] what but we can be lost we can turn back
[1:09:18] that's right we'll touch on judas in a
[1:09:20] minute my brother and sister you can
[1:09:22] walk you can do all of these things but
[1:09:24] i'm telling you if you could ask judas
[1:09:26] today judas would have told you the
[1:09:27] problem i had didn't start on that day
[1:09:30] it started many years previous to that
[1:09:33] it started with other circumstances it
[1:09:35] started because of the lack of
[1:09:37] revelation but you see judas never
[1:09:40] sought
[1:09:41] catch this
[1:09:44] judas never sought
[1:09:46] all truth
[1:09:49] judas sought judas's revelation
[1:09:52] of who jesus christ was
[1:09:55] he never stopped and said lord reveal to
[1:09:58] me the whole purpose of the plan of god
[1:10:01] judas was there because he thought jesus
[1:10:04] christ as the messiah would deliver
[1:10:07] israel from rome
[1:10:09] that was his whole motivation
[1:10:11] plus he had a money issue
[1:10:16] amazing isn't it
[1:10:17] prophet of god said men go
[1:10:20] spirits don't go
[1:10:22] and the world of religion we live in now
[1:10:24] a money issue
[1:10:26] amen they're believing that deliverance
[1:10:28] is to be delivered from poverty and
[1:10:30] delivered from this and delivered from
[1:10:32] that totally misconstruing the word of
[1:10:34] god
[1:10:35] amen but it's here i want to just catch
[1:10:38] this real quick before we go on
[1:10:40] and he in his name shall the gentiles
[1:10:43] trust so we're seeing this prophecy of
[1:10:46] the word coming forth speaking that
[1:10:48] there will come a day that the gentiles
[1:10:50] you and i are going to so absolutely
[1:10:52] trust in jesus christ we'll actually
[1:10:55] forsake our own thinking amen we'll
[1:10:57] forsake our own reasoning now i'm going
[1:11:00] to ask you just if you would if you want
[1:11:02] to participate have you ever had to
[1:11:04] fight your own reasoning between the
[1:11:07] word and your thoughts
[1:11:10] amen it's absolutely i don't believe
[1:11:12] there'll be a one of us that will apart
[1:11:13] from this life that haven't went through
[1:11:15] the battle of fighting between what the
[1:11:17] word said and what our thoughts are and
[1:11:19] you can see my brother and sister
[1:11:21] because we've all done it you can see
[1:11:23] what happens in our life when we fall to
[1:11:25] the reasoning of our own thoughts when
[1:11:27] we we move away from the word and say
[1:11:29] but but that didn't really cover my
[1:11:31] circumstance because i had this and this
[1:11:35] no i'm sorry the word is
[1:11:36] all-encompassing
[1:11:38] when the word says to forsake your own
[1:11:40] thoughts
[1:11:42] it means forsake your own thoughts
[1:11:44] it doesn't mean forsake them except for
[1:11:47] and then you have
[1:11:48] subpart 235 g
[1:11:52] which was the world's been cruel to me
[1:11:54] and so therefore i have a substitute
[1:11:58] no
[1:11:59] no
[1:11:59] the word is the word
[1:12:01] and the word says here then in his name
[1:12:04] shall the gentiles trust so my brother
[1:12:06] and sister you realize this and i hope i
[1:12:08] don't come too strong this morning but
[1:12:09] you realize that god's going to let you
[1:12:11] fall on your face until you learn to
[1:12:12] trust him
[1:12:14] oh we're not talking i'm not talking to
[1:12:16] unbelievers this morning i'm not talking
[1:12:18] to people that are like well i don't
[1:12:19] know if i can go any further let me tell
[1:12:21] you the pow how strong the power of god
[1:12:23] is there was some of you i'm kind of
[1:12:25] plagiarizing this from another brother
[1:12:27] but it struck my heart some of you were
[1:12:29] ready to quit two or three years ago
[1:12:30] when this whole pandemic thing started
[1:12:33] oh i just can't serve the lord if this
[1:12:35] life is so hard and i'm so beaten down
[1:12:37] defeated and we've went through a whole
[1:12:39] pandemic and all kinds of craziness and
[1:12:42] sickness and you're still here
[1:12:46] don't tell me god doesn't come on the
[1:12:47] scene and deal with you amen he's not
[1:12:50] here to see you defeated he's here to
[1:12:51] see you victorious
[1:12:53] amen so as the word is there he says
[1:12:55] just trust me just trust me amen i i'm
[1:12:59] not going to go into the details brother
[1:13:01] sergey has shared this and such a
[1:13:03] beautiful thing but you know here's
[1:13:05] these young men well maybe some of them
[1:13:07] aren't necessarily young young in your
[1:13:09] sense but you know they're in drafting
[1:13:11] age there in the donbass or the nest
[1:13:14] region and you know they don't even dare
[1:13:16] leave their house because the russian
[1:13:18] army is going to grab them and turn them
[1:13:20] into a soldier and god gives a word to
[1:13:23] the pastor and the pastor doesn't he
[1:13:25] doesn't just instantly have an answer
[1:13:27] but then one day god comes and manifests
[1:13:30] this and my brother my sister
[1:13:32] delivers through a way that we would
[1:13:34] think that that doesn't seem right but
[1:13:36] delivers these brothers out of the hand
[1:13:39] of the devourer and gives them liberty
[1:13:42] and you see it's absolutely prophetic
[1:13:44] you see it's absolutely the word of the
[1:13:46] lord and i'm telling you just as
[1:13:48] supernatural as that is it loses a
[1:13:50] little bit of his emphasis because i'm
[1:13:52] not giving you the whole story but my
[1:13:54] brother and sister are just as sure as
[1:13:56] god delivered those men out of the hands
[1:13:59] of the russian army and deliver them
[1:14:01] into freedom is the spirit of god the
[1:14:04] spirit of christ here this morning to
[1:14:06] deliver you out of the hands of the
[1:14:08] enemy and deliver you into liberty
[1:14:11] you say but brother paul you don't
[1:14:13] understand my circumstance you're right
[1:14:15] i don't but my god does
[1:14:17] you shouldn't be looking to the pastor
[1:14:19] or something the minister for the answer
[1:14:21] anyway you should be looking to the lord
[1:14:24] but have confidence have faith in god
[1:14:26] god can fill you up with the holy ghost
[1:14:28] god can make you powerful he can make
[1:14:30] you invisi hallelujah
[1:14:33] and i didn't mean to exclude brother
[1:14:35] vasily
[1:14:36] the father meant a lot to me
[1:14:39] many years when i first started
[1:14:41] pastoring and stuff it was a great
[1:14:42] encouragement to me
[1:14:45] amen
[1:14:46] a man i miss very much
[1:14:49] amen so look
[1:14:53] this prophetic insight to the
[1:14:55] revealing
[1:14:57] see this is a
[1:14:59] revealing
[1:15:02] but it's also an establishment of the
[1:15:05] word in our day amen
[1:15:07] prophet brother brown didn't come just
[1:15:08] to put the word in order and reveal
[1:15:11] these hidden mysteries
[1:15:13] are you with me
[1:15:15] because he could have just went through
[1:15:16] the bible and said here this means this
[1:15:18] this means this that meant this and just
[1:15:20] disappear what he did is he come to
[1:15:22] establish it he come to give it roots in
[1:15:26] our lives roots in our churches and our
[1:15:28] families to give it roots to establish
[1:15:31] that in us and so it was not just hey we
[1:15:33] have a message and and we don't know
[1:15:35] much about it and we're waiting to see
[1:15:37] if it really is going to come to pass no
[1:15:39] my brother and sister as we spoke many
[1:15:40] times and recently you are the
[1:15:42] vindication of a prophetic message of
[1:15:44] this hour if it had not proved it had
[1:15:47] not uh uh uh
[1:15:50] become what he said it would
[1:15:53] and not manifested itself
[1:15:56] we'd say well well that's
[1:15:58] that's it's it's means nothing
[1:16:01] but wait we can look at his life he
[1:16:03] discerned the thoughts and the intents
[1:16:05] the healing
[1:16:07] all of these things there's the
[1:16:08] vindication i'm here to tell you you're
[1:16:10] the vindication
[1:16:12] you are the word in this hour coming to
[1:16:14] pass that is declaring the word that he
[1:16:16] spoke back there was true and it was
[1:16:18] powerful and the power of the word has
[1:16:20] been unleashed and is producing the very
[1:16:23] bride that he spoke and prophesied of is
[1:16:26] being produced today my brother and
[1:16:28] sister it is the truth amen people
[1:16:31] struggle on that well no we're not that
[1:16:33] important oh yes you are
[1:16:35] oh yes you are the prophet come to claim
[1:16:37] a bride he didn't come just to preach
[1:16:39] about a bride he come to claim a bride
[1:16:41] and his word that he pro the ministry of
[1:16:44] the hour has produced this it's not him
[1:16:47] not brother branham but it is christ
[1:16:49] through the word has produced this bride
[1:16:52] and i am so glad that it has
[1:16:54] amen because i consider myself to be
[1:16:56] part of that many membered body of
[1:16:59] believers
[1:17:00] now the word of god my brother and
[1:17:03] sister
[1:17:06] has to come the plan of god was to bring
[1:17:09] us to trust and rest in him
[1:17:12] now go look it up if you would study it
[1:17:15] not right now put your phone down
[1:17:20] go look what the prophet of god said
[1:17:21] about rest
[1:17:23] go in your bible
[1:17:25] you can study that several places
[1:17:27] hebrews is where we're going to go in
[1:17:28] just a minute hebrews 4 and 1.
[1:17:31] you see without entering to the rest my
[1:17:32] brother and sister we've accomplished
[1:17:34] nothing that's exactly right
[1:17:36] now some people they struggle with that
[1:17:37] idea but seriously we can sit here and
[1:17:40] without entering into that rest we have
[1:17:43] not accomplished anything we have become
[1:17:45] faithful churchgoers
[1:17:47] so there's something more than just
[1:17:49] saying well we here heard this we
[1:17:51] believe this you have to come into the
[1:17:52] rest we'll go into hebrews 4 and talk
[1:17:54] about it
[1:17:55] let us therefore fear in other words
[1:17:57] have a reverence last a promise being
[1:18:00] left left us of entering into his rest
[1:18:03] yes that's right
[1:18:07] i shared this kind of jokingly the other
[1:18:08] day visiting with a man and
[1:18:12] conversation took a turn and i started
[1:18:14] sharing a little bit with him and he
[1:18:15] says wow you're excited about that and
[1:18:17] it sounds like you go to church all the
[1:18:18] time you must be a catholic
[1:18:24] no
[1:18:25] i'm not
[1:18:26] i'm just a bible believing christian
[1:18:30] me too
[1:18:31] i haven't been to church in a while but
[1:18:32] we're going on easter
[1:18:35] okay i like your intensity
[1:18:37] i i love the fervents that you have in
[1:18:40] approaching this
[1:18:42] no my brother and sister
[1:18:44] he said not to forsake the assembling of
[1:18:46] ourselves together
[1:18:47] that's almost as much i would put it in
[1:18:49] context as anything else in scripture
[1:18:52] it's not like option b or option c
[1:18:58] now let us therefore fear lest a promise
[1:19:00] being left
[1:19:03] that's kind of like
[1:19:07] an inheritance
[1:19:11] here's
[1:19:13] this promise i've left you
[1:19:16] now it's going to be up to you what you
[1:19:17] do with this promise you can put value
[1:19:19] on this promise you can set it on the
[1:19:21] shelf
[1:19:25] of entering into his rest any of you
[1:19:28] should seem to come short of it
[1:19:31] now i i think you're a little subdued
[1:19:33] this morning and i'm a little excited so
[1:19:35] i don't want to be over exuberant but
[1:19:36] you know sometimes i think saints that
[1:19:39] we just come to church and we do it
[1:19:40] because we do it and it's not because we
[1:19:43] were on fire sunday morning
[1:19:45] we weren't just wound up to go to the
[1:19:47] house of god to preach and pray and yeah
[1:19:50] you preach too you know that you're
[1:19:51] preaching to me right now
[1:19:53] yeah
[1:19:55] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[1:19:58] well as unto them but the word preached
[1:20:00] did not profit them not being mixed with
[1:20:02] faith so did you i i don't want anybody
[1:20:05] on the spot but i'm just going to preach
[1:20:06] what the lord laid my heart amen didn't
[1:20:09] any of you bring your faith this morning
[1:20:11] amen did you put the effort to mixing it
[1:20:14] now amen it can't just leave it setting
[1:20:16] you need to mix it right but the word
[1:20:19] did not profit them not being mixed with
[1:20:22] faith so you got to take the word and
[1:20:24] you got to mix faith and mix them
[1:20:25] together and then come into the house of
[1:20:27] god amen with them that heard it for we
[1:20:30] which have believed
[1:20:32] any believers here this morning
[1:20:34] even if you don't feel like it i
[1:20:36] encourage you to lift your hand up for
[1:20:37] the future
[1:20:39] hallelujah amen for we which believe do
[1:20:42] enter into rest as he said as i have
[1:20:44] sworn in my wrath if they should enter
[1:20:46] into my rest although the works
[1:20:49] oh my
[1:20:52] oh my did you catch that
[1:20:54] i've been trying so hard to serve god
[1:20:58] i've been i've been just struggling come
[1:21:00] on can we be of courage today and
[1:21:02] somebody say amen i've been struggling
[1:21:05] and i've been just trying to i've been
[1:21:07] trying to believe and i've been trying
[1:21:08] to serve god
[1:21:12] it was finished before the foundation of
[1:21:13] the world amen
[1:21:15] what the real question today is
[1:21:18] or the real issue
[1:21:20] is trust
[1:21:23] the work is done
[1:21:26] that's all finished it's time saints for
[1:21:29] us to get a revelation of what it is to
[1:21:30] actually trust god young people old
[1:21:32] people every kind of people it's a
[1:21:34] revelation to trust god you got to come
[1:21:36] to a place that you say you know even if
[1:21:38] the wheels are falling off the wagon
[1:21:41] god's got a better wagon for me or a
[1:21:43] better horse for me or something better
[1:21:46] for me because he said i'll not leave
[1:21:48] you nor forsake you so you have to worry
[1:21:50] about god abandoning you
[1:21:53] and i'll put it this way if we can't
[1:21:54] trust one word of god then let's not
[1:21:56] bother
[1:21:57] trusting any of it
[1:21:59] but most of us have an inherent faith
[1:22:02] that we trust god as god
[1:22:04] but not enough to trust god
[1:22:06] completely
[1:22:13] [Music]
[1:22:15] so the works were finished from the
[1:22:16] foundation of the world
[1:22:18] for he spake in a certain place of the
[1:22:20] seventh day on this wise and god did
[1:22:22] rest on the seventh day from all his
[1:22:23] works
[1:22:24] and in this place again if they shall
[1:22:26] enter into my rest seeing therefore
[1:22:28] remaineth that some must enter therein
[1:22:32] oh my brother and sister i'm some of the
[1:22:35] sum
[1:22:36] i'm part of that psalm that's going to
[1:22:38] believe this and trust it and enter in
[1:22:41] with it come on it's time to get it out
[1:22:43] of your mouth you know it's time to
[1:22:45] start confessing i'm going to be one of
[1:22:47] them amen but i have this problem you
[1:22:50] know i used to go to used to go to
[1:22:52] church with my wife on sundays
[1:22:57] right after i'd stayed out until about
[1:22:58] one in the morning shooting pool
[1:23:00] with my friends
[1:23:02] sounds like a good combination for a
[1:23:04] believer doesn't it
[1:23:08] it's a funny story actually
[1:23:11] i come home about one o'clock in the
[1:23:13] morning one night
[1:23:16] my wife had a friend a visitor that was
[1:23:18] staying with us and
[1:23:20] you know
[1:23:21] you know the all the tricks of the trade
[1:23:23] you know you
[1:23:24] idle the car way down shut the
[1:23:26] headlights off before you get in the
[1:23:27] driveway so don't flash in any windows
[1:23:31] turn the key in the lock real slow
[1:23:36] tiptoe in
[1:23:40] and here's this little five foot nothing
[1:23:42] girl with her finger in my face saying
[1:23:45] you are son of god what are you doing
[1:23:48] out of this time of night you should be
[1:23:50] home praying
[1:23:52] and i was like get out of my face
[1:23:55] did you know what the problem was
[1:23:57] i couldn't get her face out of my face
[1:24:00] and day after day
[1:24:03] and i would find myself down in the wee
[1:24:05] hours of the night shooting pool i
[1:24:06] didn't drink i didn't smoke i wasn't
[1:24:08] chasing anybody
[1:24:10] it was just a bad habit i had
[1:24:12] and i'd be shooting pool
[1:24:14] and that little five foot nothing girl's
[1:24:16] face was in my face
[1:24:18] do you think god ordained that or not
[1:24:23] she preached the sermon that the
[1:24:24] preachers couldn't get through to me
[1:24:26] but she did
[1:24:32] you see god will do whatever it takes
[1:24:33] saints
[1:24:35] because you see
[1:24:37] i thought
[1:24:39] i was relaxing
[1:24:43] i thought
[1:24:44] i was enjoying life
[1:24:48] why because i didn't know what rest was
[1:24:50] amen
[1:24:51] i didn't know that the only rest that
[1:24:53] there would be for my soul would be in
[1:24:55] jesus christ entirely not in church not
[1:24:58] a saying i believe this message none of
[1:25:01] that it had to be my rest had to be in
[1:25:04] jesus christ for this man right here to
[1:25:07] ever find rest
[1:25:11] that story is much deeper than it is but
[1:25:13] this probably not the time nor the place
[1:25:15] god another place said if they shall
[1:25:17] enter into my resting therefore it
[1:25:18] remaineth that some must enter therein
[1:25:21] and they to whom it was first preached
[1:25:23] entered not in because of unbelief you
[1:25:26] see it don't matter about who heard it
[1:25:28] first my brother and sister it's who
[1:25:30] acts on it
[1:25:32] amen there's no seniority in this gospel
[1:25:35] you believe it today
[1:25:37] amen it don't matter if it's your first
[1:25:39] day
[1:25:40] or it doesn't matter if you believed it
[1:25:42] for 80 90 100 years whatever it might
[1:25:44] have been amen now look here
[1:25:47] he says and again he limited a certain
[1:25:49] day saying in david today after so long
[1:25:51] a time as it said today if you will hear
[1:25:54] his voice and harden not your hearts
[1:25:57] for if jesus had given them rest they
[1:26:00] then would he not afterward have spoken
[1:26:02] of another day so the people themselves
[1:26:05] my brother and sister
[1:26:08] oh my am i am i preaching too personal
[1:26:09] this morning good i can step another
[1:26:11] step closer to you can't i
[1:26:15] do you realize according to the
[1:26:16] scripture that every time you sit in the
[1:26:18] house of god hear the word of god
[1:26:21] lay it down and walk out without acting
[1:26:22] on it there's a hardening taking place
[1:26:25] in the heart
[1:26:27] that the next time you hear it has less
[1:26:30] effect
[1:26:31] than it did the last time
[1:26:34] that's why the prophet of god told us to
[1:26:35] repent every single day because that
[1:26:38] repenting is a softening of the heart of
[1:26:40] the spirit so that our heart does not
[1:26:42] become look israel
[1:26:45] they heard the word preached
[1:26:48] and they had a word that had promised to
[1:26:50] liver them into the promised land and
[1:26:53] they come down to kadesh barnea
[1:26:58] and they just couldn't even say amen to
[1:26:59] the word of god
[1:27:01] they'd been given a promise you know
[1:27:02] what happened they'd heard it so much
[1:27:05] but actually didn't believe it could
[1:27:07] take place
[1:27:11] oh my
[1:27:14] oh my saints
[1:27:16] don't sit here this morning i pray
[1:27:18] with something in your heart say me be
[1:27:20] victorious in jesus christ me being an
[1:27:23] overcomer me being shouting in victory
[1:27:25] the devil being afraid of me i just
[1:27:27] don't see how that can take place don't
[1:27:28] do that
[1:27:29] don't do don't let satan harden your
[1:27:32] heart to faith in the word
[1:27:34] because the word will deliver you but if
[1:27:37] you've hardened your heart to that the
[1:27:40] supernatural will take place
[1:27:43] and you'll miss it
[1:27:45] come on
[1:27:47] look i'm not preaching anybody i'm just
[1:27:50] preaching
[1:27:51] easter
[1:27:54] i'm preaching a resurrection my brother
[1:27:56] and sister because i'm speaking oh if i
[1:27:58] could just lay this out to you i
[1:28:00] preached it way better in the middle of
[1:28:02] the night
[1:28:03] amen but look what it is my brother and
[1:28:05] sister the resurrection life is already
[1:28:07] in you i can't place it in you this
[1:28:09] message doesn't place it in you if
[1:28:11] christ placed it in you before the
[1:28:13] foundation of the world and this word
[1:28:16] that we're hearing now is bringing this
[1:28:18] word up before you to bring resurrection
[1:28:22] life into your life that you would
[1:28:25] understand god intended for you young
[1:28:27] sisters old sisters young men old men
[1:28:30] intended for you to be able to take the
[1:28:33] word and to apply the word to your life
[1:28:36] and those around you without
[1:28:38] condemnation without weakness without
[1:28:40] fear amen this is a resurrected word
[1:28:44] this is what the apostle paul was
[1:28:46] preaching he didn't preach some water
[1:28:48] down just believe that jesus christ come
[1:28:50] he was there my brother and sister with
[1:28:52] force
[1:28:53] i've often said i think we would all
[1:28:55] probably just get a little scared if the
[1:28:57] apostle paul actually god brought him
[1:28:58] right here and put him in our pulpit
[1:29:00] he'd tear the height off of us and we're
[1:29:02] like oh i thought the preacher preached
[1:29:04] too hard well i just skinned your elbows
[1:29:06] he'd tear it off of you
[1:29:09] but he'd tell you the truth and the seed
[1:29:11] in you couldn't say no to the truth
[1:29:14] because the seed has already been
[1:29:17] anointed by the word
[1:29:19] in other words that germ of life
[1:29:21] had to be in the seed in the beginning
[1:29:23] people get the idea that we've come down
[1:29:25] in laodicea and god's going around
[1:29:27] putting a seed here and a seed there no
[1:29:30] no i'm sorry that seed's always been in
[1:29:32] you
[1:29:33] that seed that life has already been in
[1:29:36] you
[1:29:37] hallelujah
[1:29:39] amen
[1:29:40] so we want to labor therefore to enter
[1:29:42] lest any man fall after the same example
[1:29:44] of unbelief see nothing's changed for
[1:29:47] the word of god is quick and powerful
[1:29:49] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:29:50] piercing even to the dividing of sunder
[1:29:52] of soul and spirit and of the joints and
[1:29:54] the marrow and is a discerner in the
[1:29:56] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:29:59] have you ever had this happen to you
[1:30:02] where you literally
[1:30:05] were sitting in church
[1:30:08] and a thought come to your mind
[1:30:11] and then the preacher spoke it right
[1:30:20] wow
[1:30:23] that's
[1:30:25] really strange
[1:30:28] that's just spooky
[1:30:31] that makes me nervous
[1:30:34] no sir that's the holy ghost
[1:30:37] passing right through your presence
[1:30:40] coming right here to whoever was
[1:30:42] ministering
[1:30:43] and he's saying oh i just had a good
[1:30:45] thought and then he speaks it and you're
[1:30:46] like i had it before you
[1:30:51] why it's because
[1:30:52] the same holy spirit that discerns the
[1:30:55] thoughts and intents
[1:30:57] of the heart
[1:30:58] is also anointing
[1:31:00] that same heart
[1:31:02] with the word
[1:31:05] that you're already prepared to receive
[1:31:08] what has been spoken to you
[1:31:10] don't you love that
[1:31:12] amen you know saints
[1:31:14] out there the weather isn't funny
[1:31:17] farmers are never happy just a week ago
[1:31:19] i was complaining and asking you to pray
[1:31:21] we have no water no rain dry dirt we
[1:31:23] can't plant our crops in dry dirt what
[1:31:25] are we going to do now it's too wet
[1:31:31] but it doesn't matter because as the
[1:31:32] spirit falls you say well praise the
[1:31:34] lord the
[1:31:36] brother paul preached on this and this
[1:31:37] and it really wasn't relevant to me
[1:31:39] it will
[1:31:40] just give it time
[1:31:42] the soil we've got it already all
[1:31:44] prepared when the day comes here in a
[1:31:46] few days right here just a couple more
[1:31:48] days we'll be out there planting away
[1:31:50] like crazy men
[1:31:51] but the seed is the bed is already
[1:31:54] prepared
[1:31:56] and the preaching of words sometimes god
[1:31:58] will preach to you what your
[1:31:59] circumstance will be
[1:32:01] next week or
[1:32:03] next month
[1:32:05] that's why the song i love that cast all
[1:32:06] your cares
[1:32:08] i don't know what i'm going to do this
[1:32:09] thing and this thing is in my family in
[1:32:11] our household we have trouble what am i
[1:32:13] going to do what am i going to do sit
[1:32:15] down and hear the word
[1:32:17] and the word will give you the answer to
[1:32:19] the problem even if the problem isn't
[1:32:21] manifested yet
[1:32:23] because that's how god works he's going
[1:32:26] to make it so real to you
[1:32:28] amen
[1:32:30] now as he brings us to this place that
[1:32:32] we can trust him
[1:32:34] it it works my brother and sister in
[1:32:36] such a fashion
[1:32:38] that we now no matter what happens are
[1:32:41] able
[1:32:42] to just say the lord's in control
[1:32:45] the lord's in control i i just believe
[1:32:48] the lord's in control
[1:32:50] amen
[1:32:56] i have to skip over a couple thoughts
[1:32:57] here amen maybe a little too personal
[1:32:59] this morning
[1:33:01] brother bryan says here what was the
[1:33:02] holy ghost given for and i recommend
[1:33:04] that you go read this or listen to this
[1:33:06] it's very good
[1:33:07] last night we were speaking what it was
[1:33:10] what was the holy spirit and we found it
[1:33:12] to be just about everything that god
[1:33:14] promised to us amen all these promises
[1:33:17] that are down through the bible my
[1:33:19] brother and sister it's all right there
[1:33:22] in the holy spirit
[1:33:23] you say but i read this and i don't know
[1:33:25] that i understand it or whether i
[1:33:27] qualify for that or whether that applies
[1:33:28] to me don't worry about that get the
[1:33:30] holy ghost
[1:33:32] just get closer to god just get to that
[1:33:34] personal element and god will reveal to
[1:33:37] you and open to you every promise he's
[1:33:39] given to you
[1:33:41] there's a young man that i used to
[1:33:42] really really really like i haven't
[1:33:44] talked to him in years
[1:33:46] he's left the message
[1:33:48] some of the last conversation i had with
[1:33:50] him
[1:33:51] was
[1:33:52] these things that brother branham spoke
[1:33:53] about they haven't come to pass
[1:33:58] says who
[1:34:02] and if you can discern it like that tell
[1:34:03] me what just happened in africa
[1:34:07] tell me what happened to the believers
[1:34:09] in the mountains of central america and
[1:34:10] south america tell me what's happening
[1:34:12] in europe tell me my brother and sister
[1:34:15] brother sergey
[1:34:16] and sister yulia uh you know different
[1:34:18] conversations but it's interesting
[1:34:20] because they were very parallel and and
[1:34:22] sister yulia i don't mean to embarrass
[1:34:24] her but she put it to me like this
[1:34:26] brother paul you don't know what it
[1:34:29] feels like
[1:34:31] and we don't sense
[1:34:34] but i have felt the bite of the devil
[1:34:36] i know what that feels like
[1:34:38] hey man i don't know what it's like to
[1:34:40] live in a country that that things are
[1:34:42] in turmoil all the time but i know it's
[1:34:45] like to live in this tabernacle right
[1:34:48] here that is in turmoil all the time
[1:34:51] i know what it's like to live in a life
[1:34:53] that my spiritual realm is topsy-turvy
[1:34:57] always being turned why because i was
[1:34:59] not in rest
[1:35:01] i had not found my proper place in
[1:35:03] christ amen what was that we found it to
[1:35:05] be just everything that god promised to
[1:35:07] us aha in it we found just what god's
[1:35:10] church would need
[1:35:12] amen
[1:35:13] we just found it to be a seal
[1:35:17] hallelujah
[1:35:19] i'm glad that seventh seal is the
[1:35:20] prophet of god brought such simple
[1:35:22] clarity
[1:35:24] it is the plan of redemption coming to
[1:35:26] pass thank you lord the plan of
[1:35:29] redemption is coming to pass can someone
[1:35:32] lift a hand and say thank you lord amen
[1:35:34] we're not hoping that it will come to
[1:35:36] pass and we're not looking to a far
[1:35:38] future it is right here the supernatural
[1:35:41] right in our midst this morning saints
[1:35:44] it's alive and well he has risen
[1:35:47] hallelujah
[1:35:48] amen we found it to be a seal
[1:35:51] a comforter
[1:35:53] a the rest and the joy and the peace and
[1:35:56] the resurrection
[1:35:59] you know that's why i'm preaching what
[1:36:00] i'm preaching this morning i'm going to
[1:36:01] blame it on this quote of the prophet
[1:36:04] because you see
[1:36:05] this right here
[1:36:07] is the resurrection
[1:36:09] we're looking for a resurrection and
[1:36:10] we're looking back to jesus resurrection
[1:36:13] i want to know where's your resurrection
[1:36:15] where is the time when christ rose up in
[1:36:18] you and had preeminence and you had such
[1:36:20] confidence in him that you said satan
[1:36:23] get behind me and you believed it
[1:36:26] and you acted on it and he responded to
[1:36:29] that
[1:36:30] oh hallelujah my brother and sister
[1:36:33] and all that god promised to his church
[1:36:36] lays within the holy spirit
[1:36:41] now i don't mean to be caustic or
[1:36:42] abrasive this morning but people are
[1:36:44] over here oh no no the answers lies in
[1:36:47] my doctrine
[1:36:49] the answer lies in our church the answer
[1:36:52] lies in this ministry over here
[1:36:56] are we message believers
[1:36:58] amen do we believe god sent a prophet in
[1:37:00] our day and that word was a word
[1:37:03] sufficient for our day and he says right
[1:37:05] here that our answer my brother and
[1:37:07] sister is in the holy ghost
[1:37:10] it is not in theology it's not in our
[1:37:13] intellectual approach it is in the holy
[1:37:16] ghost we want to have the promise of
[1:37:18] this word get the holy ghost
[1:37:20] amen give god preeminence in our lives
[1:37:23] trust him
[1:37:25] trust him saints
[1:37:27] hallelujah sorry i'm excited
[1:37:29] hallelujah
[1:37:31] hallelujah
[1:37:32] now look i wanted to just jump here
[1:37:35] amen now you know you know if i keep you
[1:37:37] all late i'm going to blame it on you
[1:37:38] because y'all sang songs and did all
[1:37:40] this stuff right
[1:37:43] john 14
[1:37:44] 12.
[1:37:45] verily verily i say to you he that
[1:37:47] believeth on me
[1:37:49] the works that i do he shall talk about
[1:37:54] did i misread that
[1:37:57] okay let me go back and read it again
[1:37:59] verily verily i send you he that
[1:38:01] believeth on me the works that i do
[1:38:03] shall he do also
[1:38:06] and greater works than these shall he do
[1:38:09] because i go into my father
[1:38:11] and whatsoever the pastor asked
[1:38:15] oh sorry i just keep deviating off of
[1:38:17] this
[1:38:19] whatsoever
[1:38:20] ye
[1:38:22] shall ask in my name
[1:38:24] that will i do
[1:38:26] that the father may be glorified in the
[1:38:28] son and if she's asked anything in my
[1:38:30] name i will do it if you love me keep my
[1:38:33] commandments this right here my brother
[1:38:35] and sister is a key and we won't have
[1:38:37] time this morning to totally flesh out
[1:38:39] this key but you see we can't live an
[1:38:41] ungodly life and expect god to unlock
[1:38:44] the promise
[1:38:45] it don't work
[1:38:47] god does have a little bit of a works
[1:38:49] that we need to do
[1:38:51] and i will pray that i hope that thing
[1:38:53] does not bust
[1:38:55] as our plane bounced up and uh the
[1:38:58] beverage cart went flying here and
[1:39:01] flying there and banging off everything
[1:39:03] and the plane jerking this way and
[1:39:04] jerking that way and she's over there
[1:39:07] and i thought you know my heart i'm not
[1:39:08] making light of this my heart actually
[1:39:10] aged for this lady because as she's
[1:39:12] repeating the rosary she is talking to
[1:39:15] an entity outside
[1:39:18] of god
[1:39:21] man-made tradition
[1:39:26] imagine having the revelation
[1:39:28] to say lord
[1:39:31] i mean when this happens happens fast
[1:39:33] you know you guys know what i'm talking
[1:39:34] about i mean it's just this is scary
[1:39:36] it's scary
[1:39:37] when you're looking at the earth out
[1:39:38] your window and then you're looking back
[1:39:40] up at the sky out your window and then
[1:39:42] it's pointed down and it's pointed up
[1:39:44] it's like lord i just commit my life in
[1:39:46] your hands
[1:39:47] you see there's no more that you need to
[1:39:49] do
[1:39:51] well i hope there's not i hope that we
[1:39:54] have dealt with
[1:39:56] all of our baggage
[1:39:58] that you're not the one on the plane
[1:40:00] going lord forgive me of this and
[1:40:01] forgive me of this and forgive me this
[1:40:02] and
[1:40:05] see that's god wants you to have that
[1:40:07] kind of trust in him
[1:40:11] in an amazing
[1:40:13] have you ever well it might have
[1:40:15] happened have you ever seen a child
[1:40:16] takes a cookie out of a cookie jar
[1:40:19] and then walks in in front of mom
[1:40:23] mama took a cookie
[1:40:26] it's against the nature
[1:40:29] the child takes the cookie
[1:40:31] suddenly he's got to find a place to
[1:40:33] hide
[1:40:35] why did adam not run through the garden
[1:40:37] saying lord i've sinned lord where are
[1:40:40] you where are you i've sinned where are
[1:40:42] you lord
[1:40:44] because the nature
[1:40:45] is to hide it
[1:40:48] and nature is to believe that god can't
[1:40:50] see it and therefore we're all right
[1:40:53] but you see if we
[1:40:55] love him we'll keep his commandments he
[1:40:57] didn't say you'll never sin
[1:40:59] didn't say you'll never fall down make a
[1:41:02] mistake
[1:41:03] he said you'd keep your
[1:41:05] commandments
[1:41:06] and included in the commandments is how
[1:41:08] we deal with our shortcomings
[1:41:11] amazing a god who loved us so much he
[1:41:13] made a path away for us even in our
[1:41:16] shortcomings i'll pray the father he
[1:41:18] shall give you another comforter might
[1:41:19] abide with you forever even the spirit
[1:41:21] of truth whom the world cannot receive
[1:41:23] because it seeth him not neither knows
[1:41:25] him but ye know him for he dwelleth with
[1:41:28] you and shall be
[1:41:30] in you
[1:41:31] now i'm not going to go off into this
[1:41:33] but
[1:41:35] do you know that judas asked jesus
[1:41:38] how will you reveal yourself to us
[1:41:42] and the world
[1:41:43] not see you
[1:41:46] it's right there
[1:41:49] amen
[1:41:50] not jesus on the outside
[1:41:53] come on saints
[1:41:54] we can do our hair and our clothes and
[1:41:57] our whatevers and everything
[1:41:59] it's christ on the inside
[1:42:02] and you see
[1:42:03] oh this could get long and technical
[1:42:06] the prophet of god's vision
[1:42:08] of the tent
[1:42:10] the little room
[1:42:12] now many people are waiting for that to
[1:42:13] be manifested but i'm here to tell you
[1:42:15] my brother and sister it's already been
[1:42:17] manifested
[1:42:19] god already dealing oh i don't mean to
[1:42:21] embarrass anybody but my sister here i
[1:42:23] don't know her heart i don't know her
[1:42:25] thoughts but she's already been there
[1:42:27] she knows that god knows her amen you
[1:42:30] brother god knows you you know god knows
[1:42:32] you and when we have entered into that
[1:42:35] place not public not in that
[1:42:37] proclamation i am now a christian i've
[1:42:39] got the holy ghost but that secret place
[1:42:41] and god deals with you and the things
[1:42:44] that you have and the the troubles you
[1:42:46] might call it of life
[1:42:48] people will be like i i just struggle to
[1:42:50] serve the lord i've dealt with these
[1:42:52] things saints i've got a complex and it
[1:42:54] hinders me hold that complex in that
[1:42:57] room
[1:42:58] leave it there
[1:42:59] walk out delivered
[1:43:01] people said brother branham himself said
[1:43:03] i don't know if that's a real thing
[1:43:05] that's going to take place or that was
[1:43:07] in the spiritual i i i don't have this
[1:43:09] question
[1:43:10] but you see my brother and sister it
[1:43:12] never came to pass in the natural
[1:43:15] and we can see the type perfectly in the
[1:43:18] spiritual
[1:43:19] what is it you're going to walk in that
[1:43:21] room which is your spiritual
[1:43:23] position with christ
[1:43:25] and you're going to trust him so much
[1:43:27] the supernatural is going to come in
[1:43:29] your life
[1:43:30] prophet of god told us that if the
[1:43:31] supernatural is not happening there's a
[1:43:33] reason
[1:43:35] hmm that's right i'm going to blame the
[1:43:37] church and blame the message i'm going
[1:43:39] to blame the preacher
[1:43:41] blame yourself
[1:43:43] blame yourself
[1:43:45] amen because this is the promise of the
[1:43:46] word
[1:43:47] he said because it seeth not neither
[1:43:49] knoweth him but ye know him
[1:43:52] come on personal
[1:43:54] personal personal relationship
[1:43:57] amen hallelujah
[1:44:00] you know judas never got that answer
[1:44:02] saints
[1:44:03] he never got that answer he thought do
[1:44:05] you know that judas actually thought by
[1:44:07] his behavior that he was not going to
[1:44:10] kill the messiah he actually thought by
[1:44:12] his behavior he was going to force jesus
[1:44:14] to step out
[1:44:17] but you see what he did is he missed
[1:44:18] that the word for the hour had already
[1:44:21] been preached
[1:44:23] and he missed it
[1:44:25] oh lord help us
[1:44:27] come on saints
[1:44:29] amen
[1:44:30] now look are we all right
[1:44:33] amen i think that's most the food's in
[1:44:35] crock pots i don't smell any smoke so
[1:44:37] we're going to be fine
[1:44:38] hallelujah let's move us forward
[1:44:40] brothers to the law of grace
[1:44:42] amen i want to just keep going here i've
[1:44:44] got so many things to do
[1:44:46] amen
[1:44:49] now notice
[1:44:50] i just feel good is it okay to feel good
[1:44:52] as a preacher
[1:44:54] okay good good
[1:44:56] he was a rose of sharon
[1:44:58] he was offered to god as a
[1:45:00] sweet-smelling savor and this and then
[1:45:02] when we become unbearable before god
[1:45:08] i don't
[1:45:10] i don't want to preach at you but people
[1:45:11] like you kinda so i'll just take it on
[1:45:13] myself do you know there was a time that
[1:45:15] i was unbearable to god
[1:45:17] okay i'm i'm sorry i just can't
[1:45:19] sugarcoat this
[1:45:21] if
[1:45:22] if you haven't dealt with your carnal
[1:45:24] life you are unbearable to god
[1:45:27] yeah the scripture says it's actually a
[1:45:29] stink that comes up before him i i
[1:45:31] didn't really want to say that because
[1:45:32] that just seems so hard
[1:45:35] especially those of you that you know
[1:45:36] put your deodorant
[1:45:39] all this stuff staying no i smell good
[1:45:42] well see
[1:45:43] sometimes in the spirit we think we
[1:45:44] smell good that's right
[1:45:46] but we don't
[1:45:48] we can't smell our own stench
[1:45:52] hopefully that's not too strong is it
[1:45:56] amen
[1:45:57] he was offered a sweet smelling savor
[1:46:00] and when we become unbearable before god
[1:46:02] and so excuse the expression so stinky
[1:46:05] you see that our sins and things are so
[1:46:07] bad and so foul that we become to
[1:46:09] calvary and where a lily or any flower
[1:46:12] before perfume can be made you take a
[1:46:14] flower it's beautiful a big morning lily
[1:46:18] or a rose the rose of sharon is a
[1:46:20] beautiful flower while it's living it's
[1:46:23] beautiful but get the odor out of that
[1:46:26] to get a perfume it has to be crushed
[1:46:28] and they crush it and squeeze the
[1:46:30] perfume out of it you see christ when he
[1:46:34] was here on earth amen brother mason
[1:46:36] move that forward please
[1:46:40] you see christ when he was here on earth
[1:46:43] he was beautiful he healed the sick he
[1:46:45] raised the dead his life was never
[1:46:48] compared he was beautiful but to make
[1:46:51] you like he
[1:46:52] was see god was in the process of making
[1:46:56] you can you grasp this saint this is not
[1:46:58] just a bunch of little people here
[1:47:00] trying to serve god god made you
[1:47:07] excuse me if i get excited
[1:47:09] but to make you like he was when god
[1:47:11] looked down he said this is my beloved
[1:47:13] son in whom i'm well pleased
[1:47:16] your sacrifices become stink under my
[1:47:18] nose but this is who
[1:47:21] i am well pleased
[1:47:23] he was putting the difference between
[1:47:27] a life here
[1:47:28] and a life here
[1:47:30] because you see he had to give us
[1:47:32] something we could look to
[1:47:39] yeah well i'll get sidetracked but
[1:47:41] excuse me
[1:47:43] do you know
[1:47:45] that less than one percent of children
[1:47:48] will ever make a living playing sports
[1:47:52] but a hundred percent of us will stand
[1:47:54] before god
[1:47:58] you see we have to get things in the
[1:47:59] right context
[1:48:01] i've got to make a living i've got to
[1:48:03] this i've got a that i've got this great
[1:48:05] thing i'm going to accomplish
[1:48:08] just rest assured you will stand before
[1:48:10] god amen
[1:48:12] whether you are
[1:48:13] rich
[1:48:14] or poor
[1:48:17] the flesh likes the word rich though
[1:48:19] doesn't it
[1:48:23] your sacrifices
[1:48:28] lord don't let me be harsh
[1:48:32] we think so much of our sacrifice
[1:48:36] i did this
[1:48:38] now i don't want anybody to be offended
[1:48:39] i'm just going to name off all of these
[1:48:41] things and please don't no one be
[1:48:43] offended

[1:48:46] do it i played the piano when no one
[1:48:49] would do it i did this when no one would
[1:48:52] do it
[1:48:54] i have done this
[1:49:01] i preached
[1:49:02] when nobody even cared to come to church
[1:49:05] whoa is me
[1:49:11] that's not the sacrifice god's looking
[1:49:13] for
[1:49:15] god's looking for this right here to get
[1:49:17] on the altar and die right there
[1:49:20] and you know that life on the altar that
[1:49:22] has died will never stink
[1:49:25] it will never take on corruption
[1:49:30] become a stink of my nose but this is
[1:49:31] who i'm well pleased now he was
[1:49:34] well pleased and to make us well pleased
[1:49:37] to god
[1:49:39] you guys catch that that's it you guys

[1:49:53] my god has already made me well pleased
[1:49:57] to my god he's already made you well
[1:50:00] pleased now it's just time for us to
[1:50:02] submit to the word and let it be
[1:50:04] fulfilled and else because it is already
[1:50:07] a finished work from the foundation of
[1:50:09] the world

[1:50:26] and to make us well pleased to god he
[1:50:28] had to become crushed on calvary
[1:50:32] and the sin of this world had to squeeze
[1:50:34] out the life out of him and he died
[1:50:36] bearing the sins of the world that we
[1:50:38] might be anointed with the rose of
[1:50:40] sharon he was the lily of the valley he
[1:50:42] was wounded for our transgression a
[1:50:44] sweet smelling savor

[1:51:40] all excited but you know by monday of
[1:51:42] the following week we're right back in
[1:51:44] our same old rock amen i'm looking for a
[1:51:47] delivering supernatural power that
[1:51:49] breaks every bondage breaks every yoke
[1:51:52] of bondage that would hold the son or
[1:51:55] daughter of god young people don't look
[1:51:57] to the world out here it's just an ever
[1:52:00] increasing yoke of bondage look to
[1:52:03] christ and let him break that bondage
[1:52:05] and finally know what life and freedom
[1:52:07] and liberty is
[1:52:09] hallelujah
[1:52:11] hallelujah
[1:52:12] you know
[1:52:14] us old people have a hard time preaching
[1:52:15] to young people because you see i want
[1:52:17] to go out there and sit down with you
[1:52:19] just like i'm you but you look at me
[1:52:20] just like i am and you say i have no
[1:52:22] connection but i want to tell you that
[1:52:24] sin is sin and it might not be what it
[1:52:26] was in my day is what it is in this day
[1:52:29] but it was still the sin of my day and i
[1:52:31] still had to fight with that and i found
[1:52:35] a little late i shared last night with
[1:52:36] the brothers a little bit i found it a
[1:52:38] little late in life and i regret that i
[1:52:41] would love to reclaim those 21 years of
[1:52:43] my life that i threw away but i can't
[1:52:47] but i could plead with you
[1:52:49] i could as it were beg you
[1:52:52] give god a chance first
[1:52:54] don't give the world a chance first and
[1:52:56] have to come back give god a chance
[1:52:58] first
[1:53:00] we serve a supernatural god he'll bind
[1:53:03] the wounds
[1:53:04] amen he'll wipe away the teeth marks of
[1:53:06] the wolf
[1:53:08] but why
[1:53:10] when we can go to him first
[1:53:12] amen when we can go because you see the
[1:53:14] seed that was planted before the
[1:53:16] foundation of the world is in you
[1:53:19] period
[1:53:20] and i'm here to tell you whether you
[1:53:21] come hard or whether you come easy
[1:53:23] you'll come
[1:53:24] amen and it's not a threat that's a
[1:53:26] promise and it's a glorious promise it's
[1:53:29] a beautiful promise how can you say that
[1:53:31] brother paul because the resurrection
[1:53:33] took place
[1:53:35] and he promised it would take place in
[1:53:36] you
[1:53:37] and it would take place in me and i'm
[1:53:40] here to witness
[1:53:41] it has
[1:53:43] it has
[1:53:44] oh thank you thank you lord
[1:53:47] now i hope this is not too direct i
[1:53:49] don't mean it that way i love
[1:53:51] you amen
[1:53:55] amen
[1:53:56] god's purpose and send the holy spirit
[1:53:58] now and mark that down john 14 the
[1:53:59] beginning of the 14th verse and reading
[1:54:01] through the chapter for the basis god's
[1:54:03] purpose that we find here and sending
[1:54:05] the holy spirit was one purpose that god
[1:54:08] himself might dwell in his church
[1:54:11] and continue his plans through the
[1:54:13] church
[1:54:14] now who's the church
[1:54:17] we are it's not this brick out here it's
[1:54:19] not these shingles
[1:54:20] not that sign out there
[1:54:22] you are the church
[1:54:25] might dwell in his church and continue
[1:54:27] his plans through oh come on
[1:54:30] come on he wants to continue his plans
[1:54:32] through you
[1:54:34] through you through you through you
[1:54:36] he don't want it to be some great
[1:54:37] preacher that he uses them men
[1:54:40] but he wants it to be you he wants his
[1:54:42] plan to come to life and be fulfilled
[1:54:44] and walk on the earth today just as
[1:54:46] jesus walked in that day he wants you to
[1:54:48] do that he wants it to be alive in you
[1:54:59] continuous plans through the church that
[1:55:01] god was in christ
[1:55:03] i hope you catch all this
[1:55:05] that god was in christ
[1:55:07] continuing his plans through christ out
[1:55:10] of christ
[1:55:11] into the church
[1:55:14] continues work through the church
[1:55:17] now we know
[1:55:18] what the holy spirit is we found out
[1:55:20] last night that it's god amen
[1:55:26] now when we think of god the father as
[1:55:28] jesus spoke of here his father god the
[1:55:30] son as jesus god the holy spirit as what
[1:55:33] we call it today now that does not mean
[1:55:36] that there is three individual distinct
[1:55:38] gods it means that there is one god in
[1:55:40] three offices
[1:55:41] amen now look at this may we say it like
[1:55:44] this all that god was that's right he
[1:55:47] poured into christ
[1:55:51] now there's some people who'd be like
[1:55:53] that's right we put our three glasses
[1:55:54] out here and we take this and we pour it
[1:55:56] from here to here to here no that's not
[1:55:58] right
[1:56:00] all
[1:56:01] that was in god he poured in to christ
[1:56:06] all that was in christ he poured in to
[1:56:09] the church amen
[1:56:12] amen
[1:56:15] well praise god
[1:56:16] that can't be right because we do not
[1:56:18] have the same power as god
[1:56:21] amen
[1:56:22] i'll tell you how it is amen you've got
[1:56:24] every ingredient amen
[1:56:27] that god placed in his word
[1:56:29] has been poured into you every
[1:56:30] ingredient
[1:56:32] you need faith
[1:56:34] lift a hand in a heart and say lord i
[1:56:36] need more faith
[1:56:38] you need some peace
[1:56:40] lift a hand in the heart and say lord i
[1:56:42] need peace
[1:56:44] lord i need deliverance i need provision
[1:56:47] my brother and sister it's all right
[1:56:49] there that was in god god himself has
[1:56:51] been poured into you and if we are here
[1:56:54] oh oh help me help me lord and we are
[1:56:58] here my brother and sister and we say
[1:56:59] but i don't see god working in my life
[1:57:02] get the distractions out
[1:57:04] get the things out my brother and sister
[1:57:06] do you realize we call it so cool that
[1:57:08] we want the next model
[1:57:11] oh look at this phone
[1:57:14] it'll just do everything
[1:57:19] yeah
[1:57:20] it can
[1:57:22] but it started by stealing
[1:57:24] your time
[1:57:28] it's a thief
[1:57:30] and if you start looking at your phone
[1:57:32] like it's a thief you'll look at it
[1:57:33] differently
[1:57:34] i'm so blessed the lord allowed me to
[1:57:37] get an iphone 94a
[1:57:40] i mean i only had to mortgage the house
[1:57:43] but it is so special to me
[1:57:46] it does everything it does quantum
[1:57:48] physics
[1:57:49] although i don't even know how to open
[1:57:51] the app
[1:57:56] but i've got facebook and foot book and
[1:57:58] back book and i've got every kind of
[1:58:00] book
[1:58:02] and i spend hours
[1:58:04] oh
[1:58:07] oh look at their clothes look at their
[1:58:09] shoes oh
[1:58:10] look at their house oh look at their
[1:58:13] vacation
[1:58:14] oh look at there this and oh look at
[1:58:16] there that
[1:58:18] huh
[1:58:20] dave ramsey's daughter
[1:58:22] wrote a book
[1:58:24] you can find it online
[1:58:27] love your life
[1:58:29] not
[1:58:32] theirs i think that ought to be a
[1:58:34] spiritual book instead of a financial
[1:58:36] book
[1:58:38] how about we come to a place that we're
[1:58:40] so in love with god we look at this and
[1:58:41] say thank you lord for the life
[1:58:43] thank you lord for what you've gave me
[1:58:46] lord you resurrected yourself in me and
[1:58:49] you're alive and i see you every day i
[1:58:51] love this life you give me lord
[1:58:55] but instead the devil's got us so
[1:58:57] distracted we want better shoes better
[1:58:59] clothes better cars better house better
[1:59:01] job more money
[1:59:02] but that won't satisfy the soul say
[1:59:05] it won't do one thing to put you in a
[1:59:07] position where one day you would face
[1:59:09] christ you know i want to face christ
[1:59:12] on his side
[1:59:15] hallelujah
[1:59:16] you know i've always had kind of a
[1:59:17] judgmental spirit
[1:59:24] because you see
[1:59:26] god's raising this bride up
[1:59:28] to judge the world amen
[1:59:31] amen
[1:59:33] and you know where judgmental spirit
[1:59:35] first comes into your life at
[1:59:38] you
[1:59:39] judging yourself
[1:59:42] amen
[1:59:43] and by the maturity of the word
[1:59:45] it brings you to a place the scripture
[1:59:47] says that you would judge all things
[1:59:50] usually when you use the word judgmental
[1:59:52] spirit people are like
[1:59:54] the pastor
[1:59:55] i knew he was judging me
[1:59:59] maybe that was your own conscience
[2:00:03] i know that's how it works with me
[2:00:05] yeah no i'm serious i said in church
[2:00:07] it's terrible you know brother jason
[2:00:10] shared that the other day and i was i
[2:00:11] was
[2:00:12] it did my heart good
[2:00:14] amen i'll tell you i was sitting in
[2:00:16] church just the other day and brother
[2:00:17] chris was judging me amen
[2:00:20] i mean it was terrible i was just like i
[2:00:22] should get up and walk out of here
[2:00:24] and it wasn't but just a little bit
[2:00:25] before that brother david in church was
[2:00:27] judging me
[2:00:28] and i thought i just i don't have to put
[2:00:30] up with this
[2:00:34] except for i had to admit before i got
[2:00:35] up out of the chair that what they were
[2:00:37] saying was true
[2:00:40] and then my next step is lord forgive me
[2:00:45] come on
[2:00:46] forgive me for my foolish way of
[2:00:48] presenting it but
[2:00:50] all that christ was important to the
[2:00:51] church not into one individual but into
[2:00:54] the entire body
[2:00:56] there where we come together in unity we
[2:00:58] have power all that god was was in
[2:01:01] christ and all that christ was is in
[2:01:03] look how brother branham changes this
[2:01:05] now it's no longer the context of the
[2:01:07] church but he brought it down and
[2:01:08] personalized it and said all that it is
[2:01:11] is in you
[2:01:12] can i point my finger at you is that
[2:01:14] okay nobody will be offended if i point
[2:01:16] my finger at you today all that was in
[2:01:18] christ has been poured into you
[2:01:21] don't sit here and say well i just i
[2:01:24] just feel attracted to the world turn
[2:01:26] around look at christ
[2:01:29] look at christ the world's beautiful my
[2:01:31] brother and sister it is
[2:01:33] it is come on i know some people
[2:01:36] probably wouldn't think i should say
[2:01:37] things like this but look i'm driving
[2:01:39] down the road a house out in our
[2:01:40] neighborhood first off it's like how can
[2:01:42] they sell a house like that for a
[2:01:43] million dollars
[2:01:44] who can afford that the house sells we
[2:01:47] drive by there's a twin engine
[2:01:49] 26-foot bench in the driveway most of
[2:01:52] you won't know what that even means
[2:01:56] it is the most gorgeous jet boat you
[2:01:58] have ever seen in your life
[2:02:08] brother david wants an airplane oh no
[2:02:10] the debate has started
[2:02:12] oh my
[2:02:16] sister some of you might be saying i
[2:02:17] want a shoe collection
[2:02:20] amelda marcos is my hero
[2:02:24] most of you won't even know what that is
[2:02:28] but you see
[2:02:30] that's not where we placed our value
[2:02:34] we placed our value in this word
[2:02:37] and this word come alive in us and you
[2:02:40] know what i'm not afraid to stand before
[2:02:42] you and boast
[2:02:44] that god has given us power
[2:02:47] i have power
[2:02:49] now is it the power i have in me no it's
[2:02:51] the power i have in christ
[2:02:53] when i am in my correct position in
[2:02:55] christ i can speak to the devil and i
[2:02:58] can bind him i don't have to beat oh my
[2:03:00] brother and sister you see this and some
[2:03:02] of you most of you young people won't
[2:03:04] even come from this but my mama at times
[2:03:06] drugged me to every kind of church
[2:03:07] meeting there was and they would be the
[2:03:09] preachers and you wouldn't want that
[2:03:10] preacher to pray over you because you
[2:03:12] would have been standing there in front
[2:03:13] of the church and they'd have been
[2:03:14] hitting you on the back as hard as they
[2:03:16] can oh devil come out of this woman come
[2:03:18] out of this woman deliver her deliver
[2:03:20] heart
[2:03:24] and they walk back to their pew

[2:03:28] devil's left
[2:03:30] no she's just been beat up
[2:03:33] she's been mugged in church

[2:03:37] there i'm not going to do but i'm
[2:03:39] telling you and you can say him into
[2:03:40] this because you should have this and do
[2:03:42] have this in your life that satan will
[2:03:44] come down and he will come and start to
[2:03:46] assault you and you we've got a choice
[2:03:48] we can close the gates to the city or we
[2:03:50] can let the enemy pour in and hope we
[2:03:51] can deal with him
[2:03:53] no sir we can bind that
[2:03:55] in the name of jesus christ
[2:03:58] now is that you binding it no it's jesus
[2:04:00] christ binding it but you've got to have
[2:04:03] confidence in who you are to step into
[2:04:06] that position and say satan i bind you
[2:04:11] because if you waver
[2:04:14] if you waver
[2:04:16] the devil
[2:04:19] i was talking i hope you don't mind i
[2:04:20] was talking to ezra
[2:04:22] an eagle last night
[2:04:25] it would apply to all you young people
[2:04:28] our visitors which aren't really
[2:04:29] visitors we're going to claim you as
[2:04:30] family so
[2:04:32] sorry your family is dysfunctional
[2:04:37] but it's your family
[2:04:40] don't look brother moses your kids were
[2:04:41] nodding their heads
[2:04:45] but you see
[2:04:48] when we step into that right position
[2:04:50] amen
[2:04:53] it's not us
[2:04:55] it's not us
[2:04:58] it has nothing to do with us
[2:05:02] young people
[2:05:04] if you can just catch a glimpse
[2:05:06] of what god desires to do in your life
[2:05:10] you will look out
[2:05:12] at the devil
[2:05:14] and the spirits of this age
[2:05:17] and you'll say you know i don't know how
[2:05:18] it is in your world around the farm
[2:05:21] would be like oh no
[2:05:24] another piece of junk made in china
[2:05:30] how about we get to the place young
[2:05:32] people i encourage you
[2:05:34] trust me if you would
[2:05:36] start exercising the authority god has
[2:05:38] given you
[2:05:40] start looking at that and go huh
[2:05:43] it's just another piece of junk from the
[2:05:44] devil
[2:05:47] not even worth what it's going to cost
[2:05:49] me
[2:05:50] not even worth what i'd have to pay for
[2:05:52] that
[2:05:56] oh hallelujah
[2:05:58] because you see all that god was was in
[2:06:00] christ and all that christ was
[2:06:02] is in you
[2:06:05] okay i've kept you all long enough
[2:06:08] now look at this oh man i've got so much
[2:06:10] good stuff here
[2:06:12] oh
[2:06:15] let me just jump forward realize now as
[2:06:17] i touched on a few minutes ago you see
[2:06:19] all that christ poured into us
[2:06:21] is in measure
[2:06:24] is in major my brother and sister we
[2:06:26] have the authority to take the word of
[2:06:28] god
[2:06:29] now see what happened the seven sons of
[2:06:31] siva
[2:06:33] had an understanding of how the process
[2:06:35] worked
[2:06:36] but they lacked
[2:06:38] the spirit of god
[2:06:41] so they saw we can go in there and tell
[2:06:43] these demons to depart but let me tell
[2:06:45] you those demons
[2:06:48] i was talking let me go back to where i
[2:06:49] was talking these young men
[2:06:52] young people you've got a sincerity
[2:06:53] meter
[2:06:57] if we say serve god and then we go out
[2:06:59] and act like the devil you're not going
[2:07:00] to be deceived
[2:07:04] but i want to put this in on behalf of
[2:07:06] all parents
[2:07:09] don't take the troubles and tribulations
[2:07:12] that you see in mom and dad
[2:07:14] is a sign that god's not present
[2:07:17] the devil would like nothing more than
[2:07:19] to destroy a family because when he
[2:07:21] destroys the family he's destroyed the
[2:07:23] children with it
[2:07:25] and the devil will come but be honest
[2:07:28] and take this sincerity meter and apply
[2:07:30] it to life
[2:07:31] and you'll recognize literally there's
[2:07:33] nothing out there
[2:07:37] because you see the devil imitated it
[2:07:40] right and all that was in god was poured
[2:07:43] into christ and all that was in christ
[2:07:45] was poured into the church and then
[2:07:46] brother branham rewords that all that
[2:07:48] was in christ is in you
[2:07:50] what's the opposite of that can somebody
[2:07:52] tell me
[2:07:54] all that was in satan
[2:07:58] he poured into van halen
[2:08:01] and he poured into journey
[2:08:03] and he poured into zz top
[2:08:06] and he poured into this and he poured
[2:08:08] into that and he poured into lampoon and
[2:08:11] i'm out of touch you know
[2:08:13] some of you say i don't know what you're
[2:08:15] talking about well those were the demons
[2:08:16] that were present in my day
[2:08:19] and they're gone
[2:08:21] but their spirit never left
[2:08:23] and so all that is out there is what
[2:08:26] satan poured himself into and he's just
[2:08:29] waiting for his opportunity to pour that
[2:08:32] into you amen
[2:08:34] oh my goodness my goodness and i didn't
[2:08:37] even intend to preach to you young
[2:08:38] people today
[2:08:40] oh wait i was preaching to myself excuse
[2:08:43] me
[2:08:44] the very spirit of nature see the same
[2:08:46] ingredient the very spirit of nature of
[2:08:48] christ in you now look at this i want to
[2:08:51] make a point to you and we'll be quick
[2:08:52] here
[2:08:54] you realize all that christ
[2:08:57] poured into the church into you
[2:09:01] has left you
[2:09:02] now with this very nature of god
[2:09:08] the very life of christ
[2:09:10] is now
[2:09:11] rising up amen
[2:09:16] i hope some young people would grasp
[2:09:18] this just not us old-timers
[2:09:20] it's rising up in you and it's coming
[2:09:22] forth so this very nature of god is
[2:09:25] rising up
[2:09:26] and it's rising up in you
[2:09:28] and because god made this before the
[2:09:30] foundation of the world do we got that
[2:09:31] point over good didn't we amen before
[2:09:34] the foundation of the world god laid
[2:09:35] this in here and so now it's coming down
[2:09:38] and it's been revealed in jesus christ
[2:09:40] and jesus christ poured it into the
[2:09:42] church and it's now being revealed in
[2:09:44] you and it's going to be the thing the
[2:09:46] world we live in today so many have so
[2:09:48] much fear they're like well i just want
[2:09:50] to i just want to be found worthy of god
[2:09:52] i just want to be found that he would
[2:09:54] say well done my good and faithful
[2:09:55] servant i i i'm afraid of this i've had
[2:09:58] a voice to me saints this is not just a
[2:10:00] preacher's thoughts these are life
[2:10:02] thoughts and people are like what is it
[2:10:03] but i want to tell you my brother and
[2:10:05] sister
[2:10:06] rejoice
[2:10:07] let's lift a hand and rejoice
[2:10:10] because all that was in god was in
[2:10:14] christ
[2:10:15] and god looked down at christ and said
[2:10:18] this is my beloved son
[2:10:20] in whom i'm well pleased
[2:10:22] do you realize that life is in you
[2:10:26] that life is in you it's no longer for
[2:10:28] you to be afraid of whether god's going
[2:10:31] to be pleased with you you have that
[2:10:33] very word in you and he's looking down
[2:10:36] on that very word and his words to you
[2:10:39] is well done my good and faithful
[2:10:40] servant enter ye into the joy of the
[2:10:43] lord amen we're living in a day it's no
[2:10:46] longer a time to be afraid of what's
[2:10:48] going to happen in our life i don't want
[2:10:50] to become a holy roller don't then just
[2:10:52] become a child of god just come to
[2:10:54] handle the word of god trust god believe
[2:10:57] god and when you see that you'll see
[2:10:59] that he will just as it was with abraham
[2:11:02] i'll count it to you for righteousness
[2:11:05] he'll pour it out to you and say here it
[2:11:07] is here's my life
[2:11:08] but do you see my brother and sister no

[2:11:22] of life it's already done

[2:11:26] the whole key now is just trust him let
[2:11:28] what he's already poured into you come
[2:11:30] to life
[2:11:32] let it be manifest and as it grows in
[2:11:34] you amen i'll tell you what
[2:11:37] as a young man
[2:11:40] as a young man you wouldn't have caught
[2:11:42] me saying amen to the word of god for
[2:11:44] love nor money
[2:11:46] because
[2:11:48] cool hip kids like me just don't do that
[2:11:52] i'm not referencing you guys
[2:11:55] but there come a day
[2:11:57] that something was so real to me
[2:12:00] it just came out
[2:12:02] that's the truth
[2:12:03] that's the truth amen that's the truth i
[2:12:06] believe that
[2:12:08] and it become real by experience
[2:12:12] i don't want to give you text

[2:12:22] of the resurrection

[2:12:44] wheelbarrow
[2:12:46] a backpack or something but you see the
[2:12:48] grace of god wants you to see

[2:13:07] manifestation of what took place before
[2:13:09] the foundation of the world
[2:13:11] and god wanted to make it so real to you
[2:13:13] human
[2:13:16] that you can say i see it
