made a special thing as it were and offered it just in a certain fashion but he sent his word amen it was already in you and I from the very Foundation before the foundation of the world it was in US Amen to be able to receive him to be able to say Amen to the word and to come forth and manifest it today certainly we have something to thank the Lord Millions upon Millions actually billions of people and he chose us oh thank you Lord Jesus thank you [Music] what a privilege Saints to be here today Resurrection Sunday you know the world today will have events I received a postcard inviting us to spend Easter with a certain church here in the city they were having a catered picnic you could capture a bunny you could look for Easter eggs [Music] you found Christ [Music] I didn't need a bunny I didn't need an Easter egg but I needed Christ I needed him aren't you glad today Hallelujah halleluia I'd like to speak to you this morning on a supernatural expression amen I say Happy Easter to each one of you and it's good to be in the house of the Lord today amen isn't it good to be a part of the Resurrection not just talk about a resurrection but to be part of the Resurrection amen many will talk of a Rapture but to be part of a rapture young people I'm sorry we didn't have Clarity I stood in the basement and waited for the young adults and realized that maybe you didn't realize that there was young adults today but it's good to be here let's turn in our Bibles to Hebrews the first chapter and just trust today you know I'm just going to get it out of the way instead of throwing it in uh just little things that have happened parts of conversations part of today's song service parts of the prayer over the needs of the day a fellowship we were invited to on Friday things that were spoken my brother and sister every one of these has just been speaking to me and I I have to hold myself back to stop from explaining you don't realize what you're saying but they do realize amen because it's alive it's well it's real but this thought has been with me now for several weeks and just coming up to a point and uh you know the inspiration that the Lord gives you a man it it has uh many elements it's not just one inspiration uh that that hits you but there's many elements that that touch you and then move you a few steps forward and move you a few steps forward and even as we were uh sitting in the services Brother David ministered a couple Sundays ago I had to whip out a paper and and I had to write you might say it was clarification of my own thoughts or God's thoughts I I was like oh that that fits right here amen and so you just have to thank God that he said now it's time to just expand this I'm going to open this up a little bit make it a bigger thought and I'll just uh also place this that our sister April and sharing Fellowship some things that she had observed witnessed experienced in in turkey and uh she connected scripture with her experience there and it was all like a dude sister a April to just say hey that's part of Sunday but it's God's grace amen that the mind of Christ now my brother and sister the mind of Christ is not isolated in Nampa Idaho the mind of Christ is touching a bride all over this world Amen that we could if God would allow us pick up and go right to Europe and go right to Africa go right to Asia or Australia or wherever it would be and the bride is of one mind and I thank God that it's of one mind because it was left to the mind of man we would be scattered all over the horizon amen Hebrews the first chapter verses one through three amen we're going to lay a foundation today of um a supernatural expression now we're drawing some of this from things that the prophet of God said and when we look in the word my brother and sister we we find that there are times that the scripture doesn't say it the way we say it but it is saying exactly the same thing we are saying amen it doesn't connect the words I use it as my own personal term as verbiage we can often times if we're not careful be saying the same thing and disagreeing because it's different verbiage amen somebody views a certain word in a certain way we don't view that word the same way but we look today and realize that my brother and sister Easter the resurrection is a supernatural expression of God himself amen it is not just a day now man chose to put a day to a calendar and declare this is the time we're going to sell great Easter I don't think God cared so much about the date on the calendar as the event taking place in our lives amen and when the event is taking place then God says you know what if you can't celebrate Easter on the day then it is fine as long as the Resurrection Life is manifested In You amen Hallelujah God who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets now if God was to carry on another generation as it were or another time which we see scripturally that's not so but certainly my brother and sister the word that God has spoken Our Generation would be encapsulated and in the first verse there won't be another church age but it might be that some of us will go to the Grave before the coming of the Lord and they'll still be men and women young people that will be able to look at this and say you know what God spoke to our fathers by the prophets amen aren't you glad we can have that testimony today half in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he hath made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins and sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high Heavenly Father we just ask you Lord come move in our midst today Lord truly we recognize the Word is Alive and Well coming to pass in each portion father each day in the lives of your children we ask for your guiding hand today be with the bride of Christ around the world Lord many needs still thinking father of our sister Kathy Lord in recovery having lost her husband brother Gideon father and then into this accident father she certainly needs your tender arms around her father speak to the bride there's many needs Lord Every Nation every Kindred every tongue father there are needs and we just ask you father Reach Out And Touch be the balm of Gilead to them today we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Saints if you would turn as we're going to just lay a little foundation with some scripture here if you turn to Malachi 4. now my brother and sister we tend to look at Malachi 4 in a context of God sending a prophet but I would like for you today we will read uh all of Malachi 4 but I want you to make a connection here today in the overall sense of what God is declaring through the prophet Malachi he said behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven in all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you amen before even the word is spoken of a prophet in a generation God is speaking directly to a bride of Christ but unto you that fear my name now my brother and sister this is not the fear that as it would cause a man to physically shake or or tremble in that sense but this is the fear of the reverence of almighty God and that reverence my brother and sister is such a controlling factor and people say I don't like control well you're either in control or you're out of control and I'm not out of control I'm fully under the control of the word for my day amen God speaking to me to bring me to the place to bring you to the place to fulfill your calling amen God doesn't just say well someday it might work or this will happen or I'll have to do this to him or that to him God's doing that work right now through the word amen in the word is what's taking us into our prayer correct place but I'm unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you know I want to just make a moment and connect with the word arise as we have used that in some thoughts in these previous Services my brother and sister there's a time God doesn't want us to talk about the word of the hour God doesn't want us to just acknowledge the word of God he wants us to arise and let the word come living in you and I to stand up to receive that my brother and sister if you take a common graduation as it is uh I think our sister Alice is going to be graduating here I'm not sure the date but in a short while my brother and sister they want those young people to be there during the ceremony all that's taking place then they have them come and arise to receive the congratulation the acknowledgment and the diploma of the accomplished punishment of the labor it is not some casual stay where you are do what you are we're here just thrown on leave them in a pile find your own but there's something even in the natural of the acknowledgment that you have accomplished and God wants you and I as Sons and Daughters of God predestination we can go into that but predestination set the pattern of our life it's set the Fulfillment of our life but God wants you and I to arise and come and receive what he has for us to be able to say thank you for the acknowledgment Lord that you brought me to this place and I could I could uh oh how am I trying to say this that I could come and and not boastfully not proudly but yet be able to say by the grace of God I have passed the test amen I have run the course and I am receiving my reward and God's wanting the bride to rise up and take a halt of that not to to come you know sometimes Saints we are often and I know that that there's a balance to this but we come and we say well you know I and then we back up and say well I mean it's not I but it's Christ in me that's good but there is a point in time that we need to say I am living the word amen because the word said he's in you amen so we don't have to clarify every single time and day of our life he's in me he's in me he's in me only reason I can live is because he's in me my brother and sister he said I'm in you and I believe him amen so I can speak and say God has allowed me to live this life and be able to speak with confidence I'm living this life amen but the devil he comes now I'm not talking about you looking at your natural life I'm telling you every one of us makes mistakes everyone's struggle we'll deal with that in just a minute but my brother and sister to realize what has happened needs to come alive in you and I and when it comes alive in you and I we don't have to be asked to arise there's something in us that wants to stand up and say thank you Lord I've got the life in me I've got the authority of the word in me there's something is stirring Within Me oh Hallelujah oh son of righteousness arrives with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall you realize not everyone wants to be a calf of the stall that's why some people my brother and sister say I feel of being a Christian or being the message I feel very boxed in I feel very constrained I I want to go I want my freedom I want my freedom but what they don't realize is just outside the walls of the stall of the word is ravening wolves hot Winds of judgment everything that they don't want but think they do isn't that what Satan does he makes people believe that's the life now I'm going to sound judgmental by my brother and sister and I don't mean to be but in the last few weeks I've met some very nice people men and women and and they're they very much Express that they feel free but you look at this they're constrained sounds judgmental to say they're constrained that they're constrained by something we don't call normal and neither does the word you say well Paul you're being judgmental judge me then for being judgmental but what about the word what about the word people look you in the face and say oh praise God I've been delivered they still dance they still drink they still swear they still dress terribly you see how there's a constraining there but they don't want to be in the stall I want to serve God like I want to serve God I don't even want to serve God like God wants me to serve him I want to serve him like I want to serve him that's my definition of Liberty when I get to do what I want to do but the calf of the stall my brother and sister this is why I'm making emphasis the calf of the stall doesn't eat unless he's fed he doesn't drink unless it's given he doesn't get to go live out there in the brambles and be Tangled in the wire of the fences of laodicea he doesn't get any of that because he's in the stall and it's all provided for him and I'm happy to say today that I am counting on Jehovah Jireh amen I'm counting on his provision in my life I'm counting on it I am nothing without him and it's in that realm right there I realize no wonder the world thinks we're so strange because we have become the most dependent people on the face of the Earth in a world that says we'll be counting or dependent on no one we want to be our own man well I don't want to be my own man I want to be Christ man amen I want to be his I want his Mark of Honor upon me I don't want to be identified of my own way my own thought my own deed but him amen oh Hallelujah oh my for the sake of time a second verse really was my emphasis there you look at that my brother and sister now we also just to touch upon this Malachi 4 5 once again I've said it many times I believe that very firmly and last there would be anyone anywhere either hear or hear this would think that I am shortstepping the prophet but you know having failed English in in school and being passed on because the teacher didn't want to see my face anymore I don't count a lot of credit to my own ability to understand English but I do understand what becomes the subject of the sentence and we read Malachi 4 5 as though the prophet is the subject of the sentence but if it was a live conversation we would realize that God was speaking to you and I amen behold I send you the conversation was not with the prophet it was with you and I but we needed a profit my brother and sister for a restoration we could have said oh I've got the word I've got the word but it took the prophet's words it took him bringing it down in our day in the correct fashion to put it into a place that we oh aren't you glad today that our hearts have been turned back amen we're not sitting here today without fulfillment of Malachi 4 5 and it took a prophet to do it but I'm here to lift my hands this morning and say thank you Lord you were speaking to me today you were speaking to me Lord you knew what I would need and there was a resurrection oh catch this now there was a resurrection of the word we're not going back to undo or redo 2 000 plus years ago but there was a resurrection took place in you and I an individual Resurrection it was a coming to life my brother and sister coming from Death coming back into life and that life was a predestinated life and God could have looked down through the pages of time took the calendar and went down there and centuries went by and he marked an x on the calendar and said this is their Resurrection because I've already claimed them I'm bringing them back to life I'm bringing them back and oh I'll get carried away I wasn't going to preach all of this because it's too much but my brother and sister when you look in the word how it is and how God has laid this all out there's time and there's place and there's circumstance that we as humans say is life but to God none of that existed and we were in him from the beginning and we were always in him but he said there comes a day that the seed of life has to Spring to life and I'm going to sign Shine the sun on the seed in that day and he marks the X on there Hallelujah I'm so glad God found me he always knew where I was at amen he wasn't wandering around where are you Paul where are you Paul where are you Paul but he said here it is the day and if I could naturally type this coming into a season we're starting to be planting crops and I'm telling you my brother and sister people will say they'll call me up hey Paul I drove by in that corn field that you've got down over Yonder I see all your corn come to life it's there no my brother and sister it's showing now come on be with me it's showing now but when that germ come and it's something swelled up inside that seed and that little tail stuck out which becomes the shoot and that little tail come out of there which becomes the root my brother and sister that's when it come to life oh right here my brother and sister we are the manifestation of a resurrection but the life has come long before amen the life was not just today the life was not just yesterday the life was not just when you come to the message the life is in you oh Hallelujah oh my behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the Great and Dreadful day of the Lord now there is so much interpretation of what Malachi 4 really means they want to attribute that to John and others but my brother and sister as brother Brandon makes very clear amen there's never been a fire judgment so everything leading up to Malachi everything following in the New Testament after Malachi if it was for that day it's long overdue that's right for our day it's right on time aren't you glad God opened your eyes yeah otherwise we'd still be out in the dark out there telling you believe me because I have a DD whatever and a PhD and a whatever else my brother and sister it just amazes me I was watching a little deal the other day and uh they're they're interviewing this this uh this man he actually is a pastor of a church but he has all kinds of other things he does and and uh as they introduce him they don't even mention his name sitting there at a table and this is Doctor and they go through all this whole list amen this is not our sister April this is Doctor and now I don't know what we do we put MD and DD and Double D and triple this that D and what no sir this was my sister April yeah but they put so much emphasis on the schooling and the prophet I didn't bring quotes on this because we know it but there's so much repetitive as it were redundant of these quotes but the prophet of God says those things are not what gives Revelation to the word doctor of divinity means nothing in fact the word said I'm going to hide it from those guys amen I'm going to reveal it to babes any babes here today thank you Lord to Humble ourselves to be a babe in Christ amen and so it's there as it is that it touches and we see how that God is doing and I just feel very strongly to touch on this you need your heart turned come on my brother and sister do we need our hearts turned amen this is what we need to have our hearts turn now I'm going to speak a little strongly if you don't mind today we still have things that crop up in our lives amen you know I've had fields that I have grown what I would call almost a perfect crop without a weed Anywhere But Where does the seed come from of the weed that grows in the following year there's something in humanity that we constantly need a respiration a heart turning back we constantly need to be bathed in the word of God it's not hey I got baptized I repented it's finished my brother and sister are continual work amen but God says you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna restore your heart back and when I restore your heart back I'll make your flesh follow your heart and when he turns our heart to the word then we are constantly going and saying that's the old man that's not who I am that's not me Satan Satan you're a liar this is me here in the word that's who I am I might not look like it right now I might not have acted like it yesterday but I know by Revelation who I am and my heart has been given to you Lord oh the devil's there look I got a I gotta lean against you yeah well I'm sorry your lien has been paid off amen and you cannot recover a lien that has been satisfied oh Hallelujah that's why the resurrection's so beautiful my brother and sister he looked down did a title search before I even existed on the earth he did a title search and said this will come against him and this will come against him and this will come against him but I'm gonna write to check today and I'm gonna pay that in advance Hallelujah but that doesn't cause the devil to say we have a lien we have a lien we have a lien that's why you don't borrow money from same day Title Loan Sharks that's right because if you can't prove You Paid It Off they still pursue the debt oh very common practice maybe not in Idaho we're a little conservative here there are some states that the loan shark companies turn around and file papers against people that maybe wadded up their receipt of their payment and threw it in the trash right in front of them they go in put a little check by their name and serve papers on them in court and say you still owe us and they say no I paid you where's your proof we won't go into that it's very interesting you ever choose to just research something for I don't know it's probably a waste of time but it has a very strong spiritual application some states allow even in the time of dispute up to 67 percent interest I'm going to take you another angle right here when people don't have enough revelation of who they are in Jesus Christ and Satan comes and says this debt is against you and if you don't have a revelation to be able to say I have the proof that debt is paid I have Christ in me amen this debt is paid and if you can't pay that even in the time of your arguing and imagine I just want to put in this context that Satan would then buy his uh own methods his slippery Behavior would be able and consume 67 percent of your time 67 percent of your life condemnation fear anxieties depressions and everything that goes with that consuming your life because you don't have a revelation to be able to stand up and say the debt is paid and I am free and the word says He Who is free is free indeed and Satan get out of here I'm free the debt is paid oh Hallelujah all people say well of course we believe in Calvary you realize Calvary my brother and sister was an Earthly expression of something else that took place oh now look at this amen this is Supernatural it really is and it's a key element to the coming of the Lord it has to take place before the coming of the Lord amen now look what it says it's going to turn the hearts doesn't say it's turning any churches or religions so if we're just in church or we just have a religion do you realize you can be a one-man denomination my oh my God when you have a conversation with someone and they make a statement and you say well where did the prophet say that well he doesn't but that's how I believe it I tell you what you do in a case like that flee yeah run away from that because that's nothing more than a one member denomination now let's go to John 1 1 for a moment now I have verses 1 through 14 but I want to just come we know this scripture and the whole thing is relevant but for the sake of time we want to just move down very quickly in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God that's a very strong Foundation right it's anchored we don't have any room to look one way or the other decide something different amen so it says the same was the beginning with God now as we jump down through here this is a little bit sister April where we were thinking of as you were speaking the other day sharing your your experience Amen in him was life and the life was the light of men you see we can produce no light for anyone unless that life is in US amen and so this is why now this is a little strong but this is why the denomination produces denomination because he's not in there to produce the life that is the light but they are just replicating the plan just like when you receive a postcard we could have according to this postcard guaranteed triple the people here this Easter morning they're not worried about life they're not worried about light they're counting numbers my brother and sister I would rather be fulfilling the scripture where two or three are gathered in his name I would rather fulfill that scripture than pack this building out amen because otherwise all we are is just churches or religion and he never said one single thing my brother and sister about turning the church's heart back or the religions back or whatever it is he was talking a very personal can we say Amen very personal conversation there's a preacher on the internet made these statements here recently come to our church we're not here to judge anyone and neither is God that's right he obviously has a different Bible than we have right he obviously serves a different God my Bible shows that my God is a jealous God he doesn't want me out here with a laodicea and girlfriend her boyfriends speak in the church the bride as a in feminine doesn't want us to have a laodicea and boyfriend and think we can come and receive benefits from our Lord he's a jealous God but you see the very nature of what it is there's Hearts being turned back my brother and sister they're being turned back to that original nice sea and seed that was planted they're turning back to that whole thing amen no longer is there really what you would call a Protestant Reform Revival kind of like brother Paul I can now lift my hand I don't feel so out of place I can lift my hand I drink coffee now yeah y'all should be really happy Brother Paul's grown up but if you watched brother Paul making coffee you would say I was a backslider and we can make all the Motions of serving God but it is so diluted down with this and a little of that and just a couple drops of sweetener amen and a little bit of chocolate it's not coffee in my book amen we're talking about denominations it's not coffee unless it has chocolate in it according to me now use that silly analogy to show that when we come to the place that we've got to add a little bit of man into the message to make it palatable then count me out I want the word as a prophet brought it because I have a written promise that will turn my heart back and I want my heart turned back amen I want my heart before the Lord amen hallelujah now as we look at this we'll look at that in in John 1 also moving forward here not moving very fast but we are moving amen now in John 1 we just see how this describes what the word is and who the word is and how it's coming to us and I want to focus right here uh the witness as it is in these verses 6 7 8 right in that realm and a man sent from God whose name was John amen so God chose the man the name well we know our names mean something amen the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light wait it sure sounds like that it was there that because of him and him being a witness that it would cause men to believe and then the word turns around and clarifies and says you know what he's not the light apply that coming forward amen there was a man named William that came in our generation my brother and sister and he come to be a witness a record of the light but in the end we have to just put it back in the context amen that it was not he was not the light but he was the witness of the light are you with me amen so but he was sent to Bear witness of that light that was a True Light which lightened every man that cometh in the world but he was in the world and the world was made by him speaking of our Lord Jesus and the world knew him not and he came into his own in his own received him not but in verse 12 as many the go to verse 12 brother Gideon but as many as received him he gave them and let's just break this up and I forget what they call that restructure you know when they did the whole things and we did the lines and whatever else amen as many as received him so let's put receive first there has to be for any action for the rest of this to mean anything there had to be the action of receiving but we know we can't receive Christ without him calling us first look how this ties together so knitted together oh but as many as received him so those receiving were given power to just become anything no sir sons of God and of course we know that's masculine and feminine even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God I'll tell you my brother and sister I'm glad of my parents that God gave me on this Earth but I'm here to tell you I have a greater identity with my Lord Jesus Christ amen I'm of his Heritage I know brother Chris had been speaking to the young adults about DNA I was going to speak on DNA from a little angle this morning but you look at this my brother and sister I know how to trace my DNA back I'm not tracing it back to some Catholic Church where my daddy come from I'm not tracing it back to some Mormon church where my mama come from I'm not tracing it back to Nazarene and methodists that they come through the route I'm not tracing it back to the church that was in Greenleaf years ago and the one in Middle 10 years ago and the one in Star years ago and the several that have been strung around Nampa through the years I don't trace my DNA back there my DNA goes all the way back Amen in fact one of the first expressions of my DNA was on Calvary that was an expression oh yeah the word says that we were in him in Calvary and to be in him we had to be his seed I hope I'm making sense amen I'm I'm really packing a lot of stuff in here because there's just too much amen now let's look at this drawing this out of what the prophet of God said the word is a supernatural expression of God himself in other words Saints if we can't find God here you're going to have a hard time finding him just like the prophet of God said you should be able to pick up your Bible and find yourself that's right that's right yeah yeah did a little of that DNA stuff it's almost scary amen always thought I was a German I blamed a lot of my attitude Through The Years on a German but I don't know those people from Norway Scandinavians they must have attitudes also are you all Scandinavians are you all Germans no you're humans were we tracing our DNA back you know that's one of the great arguments there is in the world today I won't go there I won't go there so the words the supernatural expression of God himself amen and that expression is actually revealed in you and I not expression when we get down to this we say well I don't feel like I could really be the expression of God well my brother and sister I can't find a single scripture that defines the value of your feelings amen but we are the expression manifested now let's go right here and who is this Melchizedek amen now notice his attribute then that attribute was first God the thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed and then when he expressed secondarily he became then the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us Saint John the first chapter first verse notice in the beginning but before the Eternal notice in the beginning was the word and when time began it was word but before it was word it was an attribute of thought and then it was expressed in the beginning was the expression the word amen now if the word is in you and I can someone say Amen this morning the word is in you and I then if the word is in you and I then we are this Revelation expressed amen and the word is Supernatural so I can say today I have you have the supernatural expressed in you now if we have Supernatural DNA in us a supernatural expression of almighty God in us then I lift a hand today and say Lord help us to express not the carnal laodicea not the religious laodicea not the church order as it were of Denham denominational uh Express but to express the supernatural expression of the word in this hour oh brother Paul that sounds sophisticated no it isn't you're living it you're living it God come down and said I'm going to let you be an expression of the Supernatural and we're living oh I'll tell you what my brother and sister if we just saw the demons that hate you they hate you with a passion and want to destroy you and if you saw them with your natural eye you would tremble in your flesh but God has given you an ability by the word to be able to look and say I recognize what the spirits are I recognize there's influence I feel the pressure anybody ever feel the pressure I feel the pressure the demon that you feel the pressure from would terrify you if you saw what it looked like and if you saw its heart and soul but we're in the stall amen how can someone say praise it amen we're in the stall that demon can't get into the stall because that was reserved for the righteous amen that was reserved for the holy and it's not that the demon can just get in because it's Christ himself who's bringing the word to you it's Christ himself who is watering and feeding you it is not the spirit of laodicea it's not the Demons of this Darkness but it's God himself bringing that amen oh aren't you glad what is the stall it's the word amen there that draws the four walls of the Tabernacle around you and I the four walls of God's dwelling place as surrounding us and Satan can't get in there and if you will just watch and we'll see more of this for the word says that as the latter times would come that God would start to call out all of these spirits that are there trying to deceive the bride he'll call them out in the church they'll be here Saints don't you think they won't be here but God will start calling them out and he's not calling him out to shame them he's calling it out that you and I will recognize what is influencing our life amen all let's go to do this let's go to do that I want you to stop don't judge the individual but why does that Spirit want you to go to some of these places why does that Spirit want you to accept that music why does that Spirit want you to accept a certain style of clothing judge it judge it my brother and sister we stay in the stall under the word amen we don't realize how blessed we are to be protected by the word of God in this hour oh Hallelujah amen where am I Hallelujah but before it was word it was an attribute of thought then it was expressed and in the beginning was the expression see that expression now my brother and sister I've said this many times and I guess I'll just say it again amen I believe and I put that in that fashion so that way you can just toss it out if you don't like it but I believe that it was not spirits that were discerned and cast out I don't believe that it was the healing lines I don't believe it was a lot of the stuff that people look at and say that's the Vindication of brother branham's Ministry I tell you what I believe it is and I take this out of the word my heart your heart the bride of Christ in 2023. has been and is continuing to be turned back to him there's the Vindication my brother and sister there's men out here that live all kinds of horrible lives and discern people there's people out here that lay hands on people and they're healed and evidence clearly shows that they're not even living the word so we can't go to all these things people say well our young people are speaking in tongues I have no criticism of that but that doesn't prove a single thing because there's people out there just as brother Branham was at Mishawaka there's people out there that all kinds of Supernatural and spirituals things that they speak and they're living corrupt lives so those things don't matter but when the heart Can someone say Amen when the heart is turned back to Christ amen the heart is what is moving out day by day by day by day into his presence there's vindication there's proof that Something's Happened in laodicea amen hallelujah thank you Lord oh is it okay to be excited about the word I'm going to tell you this message is not about the flesh come on if it was about to flash then we would all now pardon me sisters I'm only making a point but you sisters would all wear a dress that drug in the dirt and we would have a book this thick telling you how to live that's when it comes to the flesh but I tell you what we have we do have a book that thick but it wasn't published by us it was given to us amen as a gift from almighty God and in that book we read it now I'm just going to use myself and brother Trevor for an example we read the book and my brother and sister brother Trevor and I we don't interpret the book exactly the same that should be a problem shouldn't it but what's in the book is bringing the same results in brother Trevor as it's bringing in me if I make emphasis on the the and he makes emphasis on another word but we're both have given our heart God says yes I'll give you an example I don't know if maybe maybe this would come to pass today I don't know my wife makes a pretty mean apple pie Sister Sarah makes a pretty mean apple pie they're completely different but they're exactly the same that gets you guys attention that just made my stomach growl you see it was a different taste and somebody'd say I like the taste of sister Sarah's it's different than Jerry's does and some say I like sister Jerry's if somebody says anybody want a piece of apple pie I'm not going to turn down sister Sarah's pie hey you better believe I'm not well actually I I would have to say this stage of my life I would now I don't want to terrify anybody here but I want to ask you to keep praying for brother Paul sister April will get terrified and some of you will get terrified but in the last few months here I have dropped my blood sugar over a hundred points and it's still high But I'm Healed and I've caught a revelation I complain Lord have mercy on me I complain I tell everybody the wife's got me on Sawdust and cardboard and the cardboard has too much carbs so she's starting to limit that you see what God's doing my brother and sister he's bringing us all not by our understanding but by our hearts and he's the one who created the heart he's the one that Anointed The Heart he's the one that's drawing the heart and he's pulling this bride into one atmosphere and that atmosphere is not an atmosphere of creating the best place possible on the Earth today but that atmosphere is a spirit that says Lord my heart longs to get out of here my heart longs to be in your presence Lord my heart longs it becomes our language my brother and sister not just because I don't like the politics I don't like the economy my heart thank you oh you see this message not about the flesh but our flesh will know and let me say it this way our flesh does know the message of the hour amen we didn't just take it internal and say well praise God I believe it down inside and the flesh it's just the flesh it don't matter you know my brother and sister that was a foundation of the two Soul Doctrine I was where people were like well they can't they didn't have enough heart they didn't have enough courage to subject themselves to the word and actually change so they just said well you got to understand now that the inside of me my heart my soul believes all of the word and my flesh that's a whole different story I'm telling you my brother and sister this flesh will know the message this flash will know Christ amen otherwise I'm telling you the two Soul doctrines pretty one pretty easy to live until some Midnight Hour that's right if you should find you're in prison it won't get you out that's right amen but if we're not careful we'll actually join so Doctrine without realizing we're joining it because we'll make excuses for our flesh when the word said that it would restore our heart back amen our flesh shall know the spirit won't it come on our flesh is going to know the spirit of God Amen amen if we don't know the spirit of God something's missing from our experience and it will know truth Hallelujah and our soul will know Christ the word amen amen otherwise we have not any Redemption we can talk about the resurrection but if we don't know Christ then Resurrection is nothing but vocabulary and anyone you know I've read enough science stuff I don't like being around brother Trevor though because I think I know something about aerodynamics or something and brother Trevor's like well no brother Paul it's like this and the x times the Y and the D and blah blah blah blah and I'm like okay I'll tell you what that is I got a revelation brother Trevor when there's enough power pushing the plane down the runway it flies I understand aerodynamics but you see my brother and sister brother Trevor and I we've jumped on airplanes and we've flown and my seat arrived there also even though I couldn't explain how something that weighs a few hundred thousand pounds can go through the atmosphere look how beautiful God is my I can see the floor opening up brother Trevor and ball going out and Landon who knows where and what happened to him he couldn't explain it he didn't explain it but when I get in the heart of that plane and I get in the heart of Christ and Christ gets in my heart Hallelujah I've got a one-way ticket out of here I don't have to worry about being left behind and I don't have to explain it oh Hallelujah when I'm on the airplane and the flaps go out and it says we're Landing in Orlando in 10 minutes amen I don't have to say how did this do it and when I'm standing and you're standing Before the Throne of almighty God we're not going to have to say ah what it is people say well are we going to this and that I don't think your mind is going to be thinking carnal when you get there it's not going to be about all the battles I face we're going to be looking on his glory and we're going to be saying Thank You Lord thank you Lord it was worth it all how beautiful amen so what happens amen our soul knows Christ the word and how this is coming to us my brother and sister it's coming in spirit and in truth you can have I've heard people say well you know now if we have the right spirit will lead us to the right doctor and I tell you what I know some really nice people and they've been I'm not judging them but they've been in their Doctrine for 40 years and entrenched where they become angry if you speak to them in any other fashion and their defense when you say but this is what the Bible says and this is what the prophet said you've got to have a revelation I do yeah it's right here in the word and it's right here in the message and I've got a revelation God meant it that's about all the revelations sometimes we have to have I'm telling you you talk to people that knew those people in Kentucky and down through that country and I've had the privilege of visiting with some of them in the areas of Kentucky and I'm telling you they're talking about how that those people and brother Branham references to them amen they're talking about how they had first and second grade educations and they could not hardly and explain anything to you but when they met Christ that word was so real to them because it wasn't coming from here it was coming from here and the word in the heart will produce amen oh Hallelujah let me get on track here see what it is my brother and sister would come to a time that Christ has unveiled himself do we believe that amen the seventh seal people want to make the seven seal is a great mystery because they can't believe it could be so simple as Christ unveiled to you and I but when Christ unveiled himself and opened up that seventh seal which was he himself he opened that up he said you know I'm going to unveil myself to a Brine and we'll look at this even in the Realms of the message there's people say well we have this quote we have that quote I'm going to tell you I don't need quotes I've got experience I met him myself he spoke to me he changed my heart I don't need to read a bunch of quotes to try to prove that Christ unveiled himself in this hour to a bride this is not an arranged marriage my brother and sister well it is but not arranged as in you don't know your bridegroom before you marry him I read a very haunting story here sometime back of a young girl way too young to be married way too young never met the man the man shelled out the equivalent of a hundred thousand dollars for her and what went with that everything about the story cause your heart to break truly this is an arranged marriage but how how glorious amen I'll get to know my bridegroom amen right now I'll get to know his kindness his love for me I get to know everything is hearts desire for me I'd never looked at that my mind is like this is not an arranged marriage but amen I was in him before the foundation of the world amen I've been with him all the days of my life amen but the beauty of it is is I get to know him and he has the expression back to me that I know he knows me oh Hallelujah amen an unveiled Christ leads to an unveiled relationship amen I'm telling you we talk about it we hear it sometimes I think we get so redundant about it we really forget the depth of it my brother and sister to realize at a time if you went behind the veil you would die they would drag you out even the priests as good a life as they lived in the presentation that they lived amen if they didn't go in there clean they drug them out with a rope amen death behind the veil but now we recognize by the word that it's death if we don't go behind the veil because now I just want to say this in very careful words but we know that in the marriage it takes place behind the veil it doesn't take place in the church it doesn't take place in the reception hall it doesn't take place anywhere else it takes place behind the veil amen and God is calm and that's why the prophet of God intent Vision says this won't be a public display any longer this is not a casual marriage of the terms of the world but this is a marriage of a bride and a bridegroom and it is a private thing it's a secret thing and a unfolding oh my brother and sister sister Jerry and I just joking about this the other day once again I looked at her and I said would you marry me again and she said at about five years and I would think about it oh my brother and sister I'm like really and she's like well you have to admit you wasn't grown up yet listen I'll go there I was talking about you marrying me not about my maturity but you realize I like how brother Donnie Reagan put it one time really straightforward he says you know if I have a brother call me up and say brother Paul I mean brother Donnie brother Donnie I I've um I found her I found her I want we want to come in for some marriage counseling brother they're always like okay how about coming this time and blah blah and when they come in here okay here comes this brother and he's got a little little 12 year old girl by the hand and walking in there for some marriage counseling no man in his right mind what's an immature Pride no man in his right mind wants some circumstance like that I just want to keep this very above board brother Donnie the god behold brother Donnie I'm so in love with her brother Donnie would be like little girl you stay here you go repent pray through right because the whole motive and Christ doesn't want an immature bride either he wants one that can come and live the life and provide be the expression of who he is amen he's not looking for a bride oh I just love the Lord He blesses me all the time and when the money Runs Out mostly they run out too Hallelujah amen I hope this doesn't sound controversial to you today do you know Jesus didn't have to go to Calvary find me one word in the Bible that declares Jesus had to go to Calvary you realize he could have just spoke the word but he so knew what the world would turn to he so knew what we would face you know some of us not very good with electronics things like that do you know if tomorrow you called me up and said brother Paul I bought a piece of ground and I want you to build me a house you know I can build your house from the ground up yeah but because I am not a contractor if you ever flipped a light on and it flickered and the bulb went out you'd be convinced your house was going to burn down but I can do it I can do it Jesus said I could lay it all out all I have to do is speak the word it's done they're redeemed but did you know we as humans designed by God need examples that's why the scripture says that our Elder sisters should be Godly examples to the younger it says that God doesn't want to put a novice in charge of the church that he could lead it correctly because he's got experience to be example and we have a lot of examples concerning the word that fashion so what did Jesus do he said you know what I'm not going to just speak the word because then the people would be like well okay I guess the word is just spoken I don't have to invest nothing I don't have to do nothing what God Said is I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna come down here and I'm gonna make these people come to realization what it cost to redeem them I want them to understand the sacrifice that took place I want them to see the whole picture and he was bruised we could take our little pin out today and scratch it not for the world's iniquity Saints for Paul's iniquity he wanted us to realize that how powerful to see the image visually because we obviously can't see it physically see the image as it is how great the price was paid and then when my flesh doesn't obey my heart I can realize the bruises the cuts the piercings the stripes were my fault but then by compassion by grace mercy refreshed every morning I can realize I did that to him but I didn't he actually chose chose to do that for us so he goes to Calvary he goes to the tomb rises from the tomb and we look at this in the context that we do and and it just being fresh to me when we've just been there and and you look and and it's you just realize you know what Golgotha it says it was cruel mockings do you know that cruel mocking sauce place the cross beside the highway and let everyone who is coming who is coming for the feasts coming for this to look up and say this is the man who thought he was our Messiah but look what this is blind to this day eyes opened this day how beautiful it is my brother and sister that he come to make it real to you and I not words on a page not a story that was told but real amen real to you and I that in an age that comes and wants to turn Christianity into almost like a folk thing oh yeah I just said Jesus died for us my brother and sister there is a bride out here that says I know what my husband paid for me I know the price he paid to make me oh Hallelujah and let that let that reel in our hearts and souls amen because one word would have changed everything but he said I'm going to show you I want to show you what it is that I have done I want to show you what the value of the blood is amen amen he was Resurrection Life you realize he could have just showed the Rev Resurrection to you and I my brother and sister but he said they need a lesson they need to see this firsthand and I'm going to take this back to building the house some of you would say I wouldn't even know what to do to build a house but you can be showed you can be shown that's probably the right English word showed works it's a past test of the shown in the double past tense you don't know that English did you right God's going to show us I don't need you to be saved when I come to save you I need you to be lost when I come to save you I don't need you to have your own works when I come to save you I want you to have no works that you can boast of of yourself and then I will give you the works of an eternal being amen of a resurrection life and I'm going to show because you see my brother and sister we stand here we sit here today we are the resurrection I'm Not Looking Back to Calvary hey man I'm looking right here the Resurrection Life that is in you and I today is what is taking you and I to the Rapture now I've been really long and the food's probably burning so we're going to just move right along here amen what you see we were talking earlier about John being a witness amen well look at this my brother and sister John 1 8 was not the light but he was sent to Bear witness of the light and we have been brought here in this context to Bear witness of the light thank you Lord Can someone say thank you Lord amen and the world's thoughts don't matter now I read this at church the other day but I'll just very quickly read it to you because it's time for us to quit caring what the world thinks about us people are like well you know if I tell them that that we believe a message of William Branham they're going to walk away well my brother and sister if they're going to walk away from the word they'll walk away from anything there ain't nothing you're going to do sugar sugar coat this message uh hide it Veil it do everything you want now I'm not talking about giving them that old-fashioned out of the mid 70s word test if you don't believe this then you are a child of the devil well you already got them all wound up before they even know what it is you believe and then you can't wonder why they think you're crazy but how about we live a life a Godly life one where the neighbor says you know what uh the family not feeling well would you pray for him I certainly will next morning they catch you at the mailbox praise God you know we've been sick for two days and I know that you said you'd pray and I know you prayed and boy before the we went to bed last night we felt better God hears you I'm talking about real things amen now look at this what will the Joneses think if I'm crying and speaking in tongue well they think if I'm re-baptized what a nonsense are you married to the Joneses are you married to the church or are you married to Christ the word amen Lord help us amen we're not married to this world Amen now I just got an example and then we'll be done here very quickly look how it is with Esther the queen just Dive Right In there real quick Esther the queen my brother and sister she invited the king to sup with her come on are you with it now she's eat at the king's table many times amen but there come a time in her need that she didn't wait until the king he might this month you got to remember how it worked he might this month invite me and then I could talk to him no what did she do I have a need I I have a desire I'm going to invite him to come and sup with me can you say Amen it's time my brother and sister to make the invitation amen not tomorrow not next week right now amen make the invitation and invite him to come amen I'll guarantee he'll show up Hallelujah now look at this we'll take this out of the sermon I know amen foreign oh blessed be the name of the Lord I'm so glad that I'm part of Easter Can someone say Amen that I'm part of that resurrection and we are part of it this morning because in US dwells that Resurrection life amen if we needed any more convincing to verify you know what we're looking at is that's the way the prophet of God says that Resurrection Life dwells in US amen that is the partaker that brought Easter I know my redeemer uh what do you know I'm not guessing at it we got too much guessing today I know amen he's talking about job here I know my redeemer liveth yes sir now what was he if he lived he was a redeemer to job my personal My Redeemer liveth can you say that with me this morning my redeemer liveth Hallelujah I'm not guessing at it I know I'm not gonna guess come on Saints I know right amen hallelujah amen sister Ruth will you come now brother brand I'm hearing the message Witnesses I come across this and studying for this sermon and I just had to I just had to share it tied in the very end here if you go and you read or go back into this message you're talking about brother Branham was visiting a steel mill and uh at the end of the shift the whistle goes off and Men started sweeping out from underneath the equipment machinery things that they operated and there was a track that come or went down through that aisle and just then out come a great big magnet and went down and it was hanging about that high over those shavings we don't know how high but you know it was hanging over those shavings and they just jumped right up against the shape as they went over to a Coppola where there was demagnetized and they was dropped into Coppola again to be melted and made over and he said you see how we do it I said praise the Lord say what's the matter with you brother he said I said
