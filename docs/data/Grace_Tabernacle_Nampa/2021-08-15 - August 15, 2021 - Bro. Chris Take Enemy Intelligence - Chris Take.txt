bless you amen why don't we turn to isaiah chapter 59. uh isaiah chapter 59 and we're going to read verse 19 familiar portion of scripture but that does not take from its importance so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him amen let's power heads gracious heavenly father lord jesus we have one desire this morning and that's that you would speak to our hearts lord jesus father we're so thankful lord to know you we're so thankful that your word has given us the power that we need lord jesus to stand upon father and to stand up and take the victory lord and father when the enemy would come in like a flood lord jesus you raise up a standard father we just thank you for that this morning we ask that you would speak to our hearts lord may i not get in the way father but may lord jesus just yield my vessel to your hand that you would speak to us this morning father we pray that you would touch the hearts of your people lord father that there would be a greater encouraging lord and inspiration in our hearts this morning we ask we love you lord and thank you in jesus name we pray amen you may be seated this morning so my title this morning is enemy intelligence and uh take the subject when the giant speaks and christ answers back so we just read here in uh isaiah 59 19 that the giant spoke but christ answered back he raised up a standard and that standard was already set in place in preparation for the flood increasing amen that it wasn't the flood increasing and then our lord scrambling to get the standard prepared it was already up and waiting for that flood from the enemy and um you know when the military the military will go and they'll seek out intelligence uh on the enemy to give themselves the upper hand they have spies and a lot of different things that they do and there's many great stories you can read of of men and women men and soldiers in the army who have done great heroic things to receive that intelligence but it's that intelligence that they received of the enemy that gives them the upper hand and so this morning we're going to let the enemy testify for us today so joshua chapter two we'll turn over there if you will with me joshua chapter two verse one and joshua the son of nun sent out of shedding two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even jericho and they went and came into an harlot's house named rahab and lodged there and it was told the king of jericho saying behold there came men in hither tonight of the children of israel to search out the country and the king of jericho sent unto rahab saying bring forth the men that are come to thee which are entered into thine house for they become to search out all the country and the women took the two men and hid them and said thus there came men unto me but i wish not whence they were and it came to pass about the time of the shedding of the gate when it was dark that the men went out whether the men went i woke not perhap pursue after them quickly for ye shall overtake them but she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof and the men pursued after them the way to jordan unto the forge and as soon as they were they which pursued after them were gone out they shut the gate and before they were laid down she came up under them upon the roof and said under the men so they're about to receive some enemy intelligence she says unto the men i know that the lord hath given you the land and that your terror has fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you when you came out of egypt see the enemy takes notes of your testimony as the bible says you we shall overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the work of our testimony so it is your testimony of what god has done that sets all hell to trembling because they're hearing that god is working through you and so the rahab and those people of the jer of jericho and the armies of jericho had heard what god was doing they'd heard the testimonies of the power that god was working through the israelites the victory that god was working through them and if this this victory this testimony had traveled before them and i thank god this morning that our testimony of what god has done in our lives and what god has done for his children for the bride of christ down to the ages is traveling before us amen before you even come to the battle guess what you already have the victory before israel ever came to the river jordan they already had the victory over jericho yet they did not have that revelation 40 years prior to that when those first spies went the first spies went across to receive enemy enemy intelligence to understand the enemy to understand what the battle was set before them but instead of coming back with a revelation of the victory they came back in defeat saying there's no way we can overcome them the purpose of sending a spy is not to come back and tell us we can't fight it's not to come back and tell us you can't do it is to collect the information we need to fight amen and that's where they failed and so now we have the two spies going across the river jordan to to uh this 40 years later for for the battle this time around and they receive the good news of the testimony the enemy is testifying for their victory amen and i don't know about you but that makes me feel like doing some shouting this morning to hear the enemy testify of my victory but see what does the devil do what is he he is a liar so why are we listening to him right why do we care what he has to say about us he's a liar he does not speak truth if he spake truth he could not be the devil well he does speak truth i take that back he does speak truth when when he um sorry he he can't speak the truth but he twists it to his own purpose but the bible testifies of who we are do we want to accept what the devil testifies of what we should be or what he thinks we should be or what he says we are when it's not the truth where the word of god testifies of who we are and that's where we find our victory when you listen to the devil and then you you lose the victory the devil came to jesus in the wilderness when he was fasting and spoke truth he quoted the scriptures can you not speak to these stones and make bread out of them but he was twisting that truth to bring defeat in jesus because if jesus would have done that and accepted that and then we would not have that sacrifice upon the cross remember god turned that down amen just a little bit of truth eve had just a little bit of truth that she twisted and then there was the fall in the garden of eden so the devil's motives are always contrary to your victory amen and so here we have here we have the the enemy testifying of of the israelites victory before they ever fought about the battle before they were ever set about and began to to march around the walls like the word was given to them to do they already had the victory but see the devil knows you already have the victory but he wants to convince you otherwise he wants to convince you that he wants to tell you that you are not victorious that you will fall in battle and you know what when you listen to him what happens you fall in battle remember but christ has won the ultimate victory the war we fall down but we get back up sometimes sometimes we fall down but we always get back up by god's grace in our life and so here you have um um the the devil testifying to these two spies verse 10 for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you when you came out of egypt and what she did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side of jordan saihan and og whom he utterly destroyed and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the lord your god he is god in heaven above and in earth beneath now therefore i pray you swear unto me by the lord since i have showed you kindness that ye will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token i guess i went a little on one verse too far there but the spies were sent in to take a look and what they received from the enemy was the testimony of their victory but yet still the men of jericho the soldiers jericho stood upon the walls mocking the israelites as they marched around they were doing what god called them to do to find the victory but um the devil was still trying to convince them that they were going to lose and so the same thing amen goes for us praise the lord another man in the bible by the name of gideon was called to fight the enemy now gideon if you go read the story was hiding from the enemy how many have you ever hid from the enemy no do we have some truth speakers here this morning okay i'll be honest for you i have and we all have at some point hid from the enemy but see that's only because gideon was listening to the enemy he was listening to the enemy's testimony of who he was but the angel came down to gideon and said and found gideon hiding behind the hey gideon hey buddy hey come here a mighty man of valor hiding behind the rock would you call a man hiding from the enemy a mighty man a dollar we wouldn't we would say that man needs to be needs to get some some courage in his in him but see god could see what the outward could not what god could see past the outside into the heart and he had called gideon and see the only thing that gideon was lacking was the revelation of who he was that's the only thing that separates you from victory in your life is the revelation of who you are in christ brother maryland said if the bride of christ could recognize the two spirits operating in the framework of the church she would be an invincible army in other words if she could discern between what the devil's testimony and christ's testimony because the bible says if if if it were possible they would be so close to the seated very elect but it's not possible so you need revelation to understand the word of god for your day and for your victory it's one of the same thing you cannot separate your life as a christian from victory amen it's the same thing because when we cross over jordan into the other side when we rapture out of here one day that is our final victory amen so gideon now he he has an understanding he thinks he has a revelation but it's a man made revelation that i'm a coward do you find victory in a man-made organization do you find victory in denominations you do not find victory anywhere christ is not and then christ is outside of the church knocking on the door to get in because they have rejected him in this age but the true believer of christ following the word of god and the message for the hour will will receive the revelation for victory because christ is in her midst amen so now gideon has come to a crucial point in his life and you will come to that point in your life and you will and you have and you will again where god comes around and says hey look he doesn't he didn't forsake gideon gideon was listening to the wrong voice but christ did not forsake him the giant was speaking to gideon but christ answered back so you never have to fear you never have to fear the devil or fear even when you feel in feel yourself in weakness you do not have to fear because god will answer back god will stand and testify for you and will give you the revelation you need will give you the enemy intelligence you need to find victory in your situation when the giant speaks christ answers back so gideon the angel finds him and get he begins to tell gideon you're a mighty man of hour i have called you to fight against the enemy god has called every single one of us to fight against the enemy and gideon says well you know let me do a fleece and and you know if it's wet and the ground is dry then we're good you know well hold on a second let's do it one more time if the ground is wet and the fleece is dry then i'll i'll accept it right and god was patient god was patient see sometimes i think we fail because we preach a god who is standing over us with the rod to beat us down when we make one little mistake but that's not the god i serve the god i serve is standing there saying you can make it you can do it i believe in you the rest of the world wants to tell you who you are or who you aren't and bring you down and tell you you're doing it wrong and make fun and do this but god is there standing by your side to guide you and lead you that's why even in the little things you know i was looking at a truck the other day with my father-in-law brother scott and uh you know i mean i'm not a mechanic i know little things i can look for i've bought a few cars but um i can't tell everything even a good mechanic can't find everything wrong with the car so i just prayed lord open my eyes to anything that would not be good to make this purchase see god can guide us why don't we worry about it you have an interview or you have a problem you're trying to to do at work you say lord show me give me the answer you know lead me through this and just have faith and god does it every single time he looks you you don't have to doubt or fear anything even the little things we say we talk about doubt and fear we think about going out and fighting goliath but it could be the little things like you know looking at a truck so gideon takes the word of the lord and he says all right i'll go get an army so he goes out and he gets an army gets all the fighting men of israel to come out and stand with him and now now he begins to get confidence because there's a lot of guys a lot of good fighting guys you know kind of when the church is full or not people have greater confidence or not and uh but see that's what man looks like looks at see we'll get down to david here shortly but you see samuel went to anoint the next king of israel and he looked to the biggest and strongest man of the son of jesse but god said look i don't look on that i look on the inside you know you can be the biggest strongest toughest i mean you can know you could be the highest ranking brazilian jiu jitsu warrior in the world you can pull pull 550 600 pounds off the floor you can press 300 pounds but one day your body will die and rot in the ground and that doesn't mean you're going to live forever you have strong men who die at 45 and they are fit and healthy there is nothing that can hold you or give you ultimate victory except for christ that one was free i don't know where that came from but um you still got to be healthy right anyways everything in balance don't go out and just eat mcdonald's every day because you're going to die anyways and you know praise the lord alrighty so now getting has a big army before him he's ready to go fight but see god's like now hang on a second tell everybody who's afraid to go home all right gideon probably kind of like okay i'll do that but you know maybe 10 people will go away all right anybody of you men right who who who who which man in here in this church today wants to admit to their brothers to their fellow men that they're afraid of something right now when there's a group of guys nobody's afraid of anything right but i've i'd have to look to the scripture to remember but a whole bunch of them left they walked away so wow he's kind of wondering okay you know but he's doing the math in his head right the man math in his head and he's like yeah with this many people you know this many many nights it can kind of balance this out maybe sort of um well i think we're going to be okay again he says hey and the lord says hang on a second get in there's still too many guys okay all right lord so take him down to the river and have him drink some some some get a drink from the water 300 men are left after all that they say you see some people they don't understand god in that and we don't understand god completely god does not do things the way we think they should be done sometimes to them you would think oh you know if if this is churches of god it'll grow it'll get big there'll be all kinds of people you know it'll be the size of joel osteen but that's not how god works he say oh if god's gonna fight an army you know he has the power to go pick every man and make them all come and fight but god doesn't do that because god knows the heart and he knows what needs to be done and you have to you still have a choice he can't he just forced us all to serve him what would be the point of grace so now gideon has 300 men and um he is going to go fight these midianites now you have to understand something about the midianites they were there taking israel's food every harvest because of israel's sin israel had turned their back on god but if there's one thing i know of my god he's gracious they begin to cry out and say lord we've done wrong we're in this position because of self-inflicted trouble but we cannot do it see god will bring trials and things into your life because get brought upon by self-inflicted trouble you you will have trouble in your life that is self-afflicted that's what i'm trying to say but when you realize that that's the reason you don't have to go fight the battle yourself you turn to god see the other day i was thinking upon these things and then some the difference between a believer and someone that's not serving god is a believer has accepted god's grace for their life some people think they're too bad to accept god or or or they want to do it themselves but the bible says the basis of sin is unbelief if you can accept god's grace you have unbelief that god's grace is powerful enough for you you have unbelief that god's grace cannot change you that god's grace is not for you but when you have faith in god's grace and accept it for your life that is what makes you a that's what brings you into fellowship and god testifies of that giving you the holy ghost but here's the catch here's the paradox of predestination you cannot accept god's grace excuse me god's grace you can't accept god's grace for your life unless god's grace is for your life that's the paradox of christ but they accepted god's grace for their life and god called gideon and gideon went in the darkness of night and he tore down the islands first thing you got to do when you realize that you're underneath self-inflicted trouble go tear those islands down go do your repenting go make things right go go do what you need to do to set it in order because guess what you're about to fight submittings but not on your own not on your own even though they were in that position because of their neglect their iniquity their sins god still fought their battle for them and god called a man to take it down and god has a there is a god called man there is jesus you are a god called man and he has called you to take down the millions in your family in your life but he's going to give you what you need to do it but the member says and if god be with us then where is all the miracles in 1961 and how that they had done the israelites the philistines the midianites the amorites and all the different ones had come in like locusts and just eat up what they had and take it out and go on but did you notice they could not do that until israel first fell away from god the devil can't set a foot on you to hurt you until first you get away from god excuse me you must first remember that check when anything happens see if you are in the faith or not see that if you're right up to the place with god then remember the devil can do you no harm you're in christ see you check first hand come to a trial you check your life by the way it says now that check just simply means is there anything you need to do if there's not guess what the outcome is still the same victory as long as you have faith and you trust in god to come on the scene and as a gideon was called he was in the will of god and he was chosen to fight but he was still afraid because remember our title is enemy intelligence the giant said to speak and christ is answering back gideon already had the victory did you know that before he didn't even even had his men picked out for the battle he already had the victory before the midianites even came that year gideon already had the victory when gideon was hiding behind the whale or the rock or whatever it was he already had the victory when you're hiding in defeat you already have the victory so let me tell you a little bit about we're going to go to the other side of the line and collect a little bit of intelligence to give you the faith you need to fight so god says take your servant judges seven verse nine you're gonna pull that up take your servant and go down to the camp of the midians and it came to pass that same night that the lord said unto him arise and get thee down unto the host for i have delivered it into thine hand see god never came along until getting what he was doing wrong he never came along and said kidding why are you hiding stop hiding come on man knock it off he came along and all he told gideon was you had the victory the victory is yours i've given them into your hand you already have he just kept testifying to gideon building him up preparing him for the victory so god sends him down he says take your servant fira verse 11 and thou shalt hear what they say and afterward shall thine hand be strengthened to go down unto the host then when he down with fury his servant unto the outside of the arm to men that were in the host and the midianites and the amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude and their camels were without number as the sand by the seaside for multitude it's a pretty big host of the enemy and when gideon was come behold there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow so gideon sneaks in right he's collecting some enemy intelligence he sneaks in alongside a tent god laid him for the right tent to begin with see god is taking gideon down to encourage him even though god already knows the battle is is gideon see god cares enough to come along and encourage you in the fight he sends gideon down and he says no not that ten gideon this one over here just okay now put your ear to the door and listen god could have just told him but god wanted to get in to hear the enemy testify of his victory so gideon puts his ear to the tent a man says hey i had a dream of a dream and lo a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of midian and came unto a tent and smoted that it fell and overturned it that the tit lay along in other words flat in the tent and his fellow engineer said whoa man that's that's giddy that there's nothing else beside that's not that that that that says nothing else say the sword of gideon the son of joash a man of israel see the devil knows your name and he knows you have the victory a man of israel into his hand hath god deliver bidian and all the hosts so now hearing this boosted gideon's faith gideon stands up slips away from camp you see the battle was already won for christ was on gideon's side but he needed a revelation of that revelation is your weapon to fight the enemy revelation is the holding power against the devil revelation is the standard that christ has raised up for the flood we're the the church age that we are in is the stand the word of god given for your excuse me the word of god given for your hour is the standard to hold up against the flood of the enemy and the revelation of that is what gives you victory over the enemy judges 17 verse 15 i didn't give it to them but and it was so when gideon heard the telling of the dream and the interpretation thereof that he worshipped and returned into the host of israel and said arise for the lord had to delay it into your hand the host of midian now gideon goes back and gideon starts to speak the word of god see now nobody could come and tell him your army is too small nobody nobody can come and tell gideon you're not strong enough to fight the enemy nobody could come and tell gideon god didn't pick you god didn't choose you because now gideon had a revelation of his victory hasn't even fought the battle yet but gideon knew he's sometimes in a in a in a fight you know like a boxing match or a wrestling match if the other two the one that knows he's gonna win and the one that doubts it the one who knows usually wins it gives you the upper hand you can both be in the same for the physical condition but as science has proven and uh endurance sports have proven it's all in your head it's whatever you think you can do it you can do it the big difference i think between running three miles and five miles is your head the pain is kind of the same it's all in your head if you have to tell yourself you can do it you have to believe in your head and just keep on pushing forward now the same thing transfers into the spiritual god gives you revelation in your heart for the victory you will have the victory nothing can stop you nothing can turn you aside praise the lord so gideon went down with his men and they fought against the midians and scared the daylights out of the midianites and they all took tail and ram and god slew them but see gideon wasn't surprised he knew he had the victory already there was a problem by the name of elisha second kings six verse eight oh i'm sorry i gave them my notes a little bit too early second king chapter six if you want to turn there you can i'm gonna jump there real quick and just read that for sake of time second because you know our pastor and brother david has been borrowing my time for the last couple of weeks so i ain't got much left second kings chapter seven verse three and there were four left oh chapter six verse eight then the king of syria warned against israel and took counsel with his servants saying in such a such a place shall be my camp and the man of god sent unto the king of israel saying and beware that thou pass not such a place for that the syrians are come down they don't have intelligence that good even today our military and the king of israel sent to as soon as the king spoke it in his secret chambers elisha was already listening and the king of israel sent to the place which the man of god told him and warned him of and saved himself there not once or twice so it happened several times therefore the heart of the king of syria was sore troubled for this thing and he called this servants and said to them all right who's the spy who is the one that's betraying us to the israel and one of the servants speaks up says oh my king listen he's like elisha the prophet that is in israel telleth the king of israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed chamber so elisha was receiving uh i write the words of my head um instant i guess enemy intelligence live it was live he was tapped in he was receiving live intelligence of the enemy and the king of israel was using that intelligence to fight against the enemy he was using down intelligence to escape ambush what was that word that was the word from the lord to elisha to the king of israel see god gives you the word so that you won't step in the minds and the ambushes of the enemy so not only does god come along and fight for you when you put yourself in trouble but god comes along and prevents you from stepping in to that trouble we just heard it the other day you know you're gonna go somewhere and you you get held up by you know at the house or something and then there's an accident or or or maybe there was going to be one but you weren't there so there was no accident simple things that god does like like that and then spiritually god keeps you from you know hearing something you shouldn't or or um you know being in hearing something you shouldn't i'm going to leave it at that god keeps you from that stuff an ambush of the enemy because you have the upper hand you had the enemy intelligence you already know okay we can go into this you already know the end of the story right we have the victory praise the lord amen did y'all bring your brains with you this morning or your vocal cords nah just kidding i'm teasing so elisha knew what was going on and that king of syria didn't know what to do but it gave israel the upper hand and in second kings chapter seven we can read about a few uh there was a few lepers four lepers and uh so after this uh the king of syria comes and takes siege of israel and um they're they resorted to eating their own children things are really really bad and so there's these four leopards sitting out front of the gates and i started in uh verse three here and there were four lepers men at the entering in of the gate and they said one to another why sit we here until we die if we say we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city and we shall die there and if we sit still here we die also now therefore come and let us fall into the host of the syrians if they save us alive we shall live and if they kill us we shall but die now so you all want you to come to a place where you're just ready to surrender completely you know you realize you realize you can do nothing but just well you know if like the queen esther if i perish i perish you realize you know i you surrender to god and then god can bring you victory because when you're not surrendered to god you're just getting in the way so these are here are these lepers they're like we're going to die either way so let's go to the syrians and they rose up in the twilight to go into the camp of the syrians and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of syria behold there was no man there for the lord had made the host of the syrians to hear a noise of chariots and the noise of horses even the noise of a great host and they said one to another lo the king of israel hath hired against us the king of the hittites and the king of the egyptians to come upon us wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight and left their tents and their horses and their asses even the camp as it was and fled for their life and when these lepers came to the utmost part of the camp they went into one tent and did eat and drink and carry then silver and gold and raiment and went and hid it and came again and entered into another tent and carried then also and went and hid it then they said one to another we do not well this day so then they take tidings of of this the syrians being fled back to the city and everyone goes out and um but actually her in verse uh um 10. so they came and called into the port of the sea so they go back to the city and they told them saying we come to the camp of the syrians and behold there was no man there neither voice of men but horses tied and assessed and the tents as they were and he called the porters and they told it to the king's house within and the king arose in the night and said unto his servants i will now show you what the syrians have done to us they know that we be hungry and therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field saying when they come out of the city we shall catch them alive and get into the city so the king hears this and he says well you know it's just some lepers what do they know something god brings his word through the most unexpected sources amen there is a man by the name of balaam who got word from the lord from a donkey because god wants to test your faith and say oh you know what what does that person know or what do they know or so the king so the king won't accept it because he's too busy living in fear and all the while they're sitting there in their bondage underneath a siege it was a false siege there was no enemy sometimes we keep ourselves trapped even when there is no enemy because of our fear to step beyond in towards the enemy sometimes god says look you need to take a step of faith step forward into battle and as soon as you do the waters part before you but you have to take that state so that that step forward here are all these people in israel starving to death at this and at this point in time before the lepers go there's no enemy it was already defeated and re and run in fear all the while you were in your sin in the world you were free all the while you were in your sickness you were healed because god did it before the foundation of the world you just had to come to a place where you caught a revelation of that and we're able to accept it why do we doubt why do we worry about what we face in life and the situations we face if we can only realize that the victory was ours in other words it already happened it's not that battle i i have to go i'm gonna fight this battle no you the battle was already fought before you even came to face it that i'm bringing you this morning enemy intelligence guess what they're scared of you even when the weakest christian gets down on their knees all hell trembles so what do we fear when the giant speaks christ answers back and he uses you to do it praise the lord so they were already free and didn't know it until the king was willing to step past in faith and it wasn't even the king one of his servants said come on just let us take five of the horses that are left and go check and they go and check and everything's there all the food so not only did they have victory and they were no longer in bondage god provided what they needed to feed themselves and to bring their city back into working order now you know can you talk about giants without bringing up david and goliath david had no fear of this giant named goliath for he knew he could defeat him so now we're going to come up because and look at an example where a son of god knew he had the victory before he walks up and that's what god's calling us to be he wants us to stand in confidence that's not arrogance when you stand in confidence and you know god's going to do what he says he's going to do that is confidence in christ that is confidence in the seed that he has placed inside your heart to fight against the wiles of the devil david comes into the camp and he hears the philistine mocking the children of israel and saying you know come on send out your champion to fight against me and his knee-jerk response is who's going to fight him everyone else's knee-jerk response was run and hide but see david knew because david had already been through the battle of gideon when he slew the lion and the bear that tried to take his sheep he'd already been and see god brings us through those battles like gideon to prepare us for the next one and he's he's rooting for you that the lord is saying i know you can do it son and for the next time you come up to the battle things of god remember what you heard this morning and stand in confidence like david and says i'll go fight him the lord had already given him the enemy's intelligence david already had it he already had the little you know it's not telegrams anymore but the the cryptic message the encrypted message he already decoded it before he ever showed up at the camp of israel there's again anybody who defies the arms of the living god is doomed to defeat that was the word of god when david come david didn't know goliath was there david had no idea but when david came and he heard the goliath goliath speaking against god's word he said he's already lost amen the giant goliath was okay so david already had the intelligence now here's the thing and and that was always going to be my subtitle but the giant goliath was not what he seemed the devil's a liar right so he comes at you with a giant in your life guess what that giant is not what he wants to tell you it is he wants to tell you that giant's too big for you to fight he wants to tell you you cannot defeat that giant he wants to tell you you've already lost but guess what that giant is not what it seems goliath stood there expecting david to come at him with sword and a shield because that was the custom that was the the tradition of the saints of god the denominational world religion of organized religion has a traditional way of fighting the enemy but whenever you say this is how god fights the enemy you miss it when god turns the corner that's the word but ram says down through the ages you know the luther and wesley and these those church ages they had the lutherans and the methodists they built a wall on their organization and on their doctrine and said this is it and god turned the corner into the age of wesley the methodists built their wall and then god turned the corner into the laodicean churches or the and then they had pentecost in the baptism of the holy ghost so this is how you fight the enemy you know the first church of saul this is how you fight the enemy so he tries to put this stuff on david but see david was a god-called man man's tradition and organizations don't fit on a god called man because you can't fight the present enemy using those things the enemy that david was facing could not be fought traditionally god was thinking outside the box so here is goliath i wonder did anybody in the camp of israel think they ought to try a sling no it's it's a goliath he has a shield and a spear and a sword so we got to fight him with a shield and a spear and a sword it's just it's just how you that's how you know that was the traditions of the day a champion comes out and says you know send your champion they fought in hand-to-hand combat but david steps out there with a sling and people probably like oh goodness what is in his what kind of ideas does he have here but see christ always goes against the traditions of men don't get stuck in tradition there's things that are tradition that are fine but don't get so steep in it when god moves dynamically you miss it amen praise the lord don't get so steeped and you know this is the song that we do this on that you miss when god's spirit moves to the congregation and he inspires you to worship but they're a little bit differently than what you're normal don't be so quick to judge someone who dances down the aisle because that's not the way it should be right that's oh that's pentecostalism god can move you to dance that's free i that's not in my notes god has moved me to dance and it wasn't on my own i don't feel that's embarrassing right but god moved upon me and sometimes that happens i'm gone and if we're too caught up in you know order or we're too caught up in every time the preacher says something we clap till we can't hear them right both sides of the equation god wants us to find a balance and be willing to be led of the spirit that's all i'm trying to say praise the lord so um here's a gl goliath was expecting david to come out with him you see the enemy doesn't know everything you know even the third full brother brother man talks about the third poll it's a secret thing the devil is trying to figure it out but he can't and it's a spoken word so saul tried to dress david out in armor and try to address david in a man in their man revelation but david shrugged that off for the giant he had he wanted he had to go fight the giant with christ's revelation and that was a sling and five stones and david brought that giant down see but david already knew before he even came to the camp of israel he already knew that victory was his he didn't know goliath was going to be there but you know hey if there's a bear or there's a lion or something else comes at my sheep i i'm going to be able to take care of it because god has given me the ability to do so see david wasn't trusting himself if david had trusted in himself he would have dressed in armor and this award and all that golf can give you victories but don't let those victories go to your head then you think oh then i got this because as soon as you think you can do it you're gonna fall flat on your face and get drugged through the mud so what's the point what's the point this morning what you know we share these stories and we've and we've talked about that it's just it's a simple fact that i've already stated that you already have the victory when the giant stands to speak christ answers back whatever you've got you're dealing with whatever you're going through whatever position you are in life it doesn't matter what it is you already have the victory and we sing that song before i before we started this morning he's got it all in control we've seen that let's believe that um amen the devil is afraid of you regardless of what he says he's a big old bluff he's a lying without teeth but the minor says in 1955 jesus christ is saying mistake today and forever well the scripture i believe someplace says that the devils tremble when the weakest of saints goes to their knees what a power and a privilege has been given to the church of the living god when you fall to your knees in prayer even the devils tremble to the weakest of them think of it see you can't go out and fight any old way you have to fight according to god's word gideon if gideon would have taken see gideon won the battle with 300 men so you think man would say oh if he had three times that he would have done the same thing the answer is no if gideon would have went to fight the midianites with the original 3000 or whatever it was he would have lost god's ways are not always saints of god that's what he calls us the faith you know you can't argue revelation you can argue faith someone has to accept it you can get all the scriptures together and things and you can prove your point perfectly to someone who has a revelation that has faith but someone who doesn't just won't accept it you can show them the scriptures in the bible you know where it says a woman shouldn't wear that which potatoes through a man or show them in the bible where it says do women shouldn't cut their hair and all these things and they can read that verbatim and not catch it because it takes revelation in your heart and that revelation is only given by christ praise the lord so the devil is afraid of you while you're standing there in doubt you've already won because of who you are you're a son and a daughter of god start testifying on such revelation says he overcame we they overcame him who's they you the blood of christ overcame who the beast the devil satan the enemy the midianites goliath whatever name you want to put to it overcame them by the blood of the lamb you can't do it without christ you cannot do without christ and the word of their testimony in other words whether you feel it inside what maybe you're gideon in the beginning on the inside let the outside testify of gideon at the end same man different revelation he was accepting the wrong doctrine he was accepting the wrong intelligence but god came along and said hey just so you know the enemy is telling you you're worthless and you're defeated but the enemy actually scared of you and that's what we're telling you this morning the devil is scared of you so yes like gideon the enemy is already afraid of you and knows you'll win like david stand upon the revelation of how christ wants you to fight the enemy like elisha with the syrians listen to the word of the lord just to stay out of ambushes to dodge ambushes like israel with jericho take the word the enemy trembles because of you the bible tells you that's why we read this every day this when you get up and you have devotions or or whatever part of the day you do devotions or you listen to a tape and you feed on the word and you come to church guess what you're doing you're putting your ear to the tent for the midianites and you're hearing the testimony of your victory before you ever go to battle god's telling you hey you have the victory so many times i think uh we live in defeat we we we stay in bondage to thing just like the israel when they were in bondage just the syrians who weren't there we keep ourselves in bonners because of our fear and we accept the lie the devil is whispering in our in our ear and say no you weren't actually delivered no god didn't actually deliver you of smoking and drinking and all these things because you you you just did it you know an early christian or whatever coming into christ or or say you know you know you're praying for more patience and you just lost your temper see see god didn't deliver you that temper you just lost it but god already did you just have to accept it in faith many times we keep ourselves in bondage because we're too afraid to accept god's victory for our life but god is testifying this morning to you stand in confidence and victory because it is already yours amen he's got it all in control amen it's already done sing that song praise the lord accept the word of the lord to fight the enemy not very long this morning but uh hey that's all right just since uh alex you want to come up here praise the lord so next time saints of god you're faced with an adversity you're faced with a giant maybe wait a moment let christ answer back for you don't step in the way and try to deal with it you know let god answer back for you there was a time when the um the king of israel his name escapes the great battle and the word came be still don't go out to fight it for i have i am going to fight it for you it's in second chronicles or first chronicles and they don't even go fight the battle god defeats them just like that just like the the syrians facing israel god
