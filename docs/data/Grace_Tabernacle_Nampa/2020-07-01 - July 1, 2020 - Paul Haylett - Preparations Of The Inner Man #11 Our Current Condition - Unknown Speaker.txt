on me [Music] aha [Music] now there is love Oh brain is [Music] haha now there is the when darkness is for now crazy this is it for ha hallelujah I believe we can say Amen this evening he is in the house hallelujah not only in this house as it were this building tonight but in the hearts of sons and daughters of God amen what a privilege my brother and sister you know the prophet of God and these are not his direct words but the prophet of God said God could have chose to dwell anywhere but he chose to dwell in us amen in that beautiful and yet we can still find God in nature we can find him in all of creation but the preeminent place he chose to dwell in was you and I oh my look how beautiful amen you go hike on the mountaintop you look in the canyon the waterfall the breeze is whistling through the pines and we say man this is the most beautiful place and that's nothing compared to the beauty of Christ in you and I hallelujah good to be here tonight I'm just thinking as we was having our prayer requests and and those things just thinking about our brother push aunt sister concha just to continue to lift them up in prayer Amen sister Concha there with her mother sister Vimy and you know Saints we don't we don't always understand and we don't always know the circumstances but I'll just say this from my heart that in the time that sister conscious mother sister V me was here with us never once did I see her hesitate to say amen to the word amen we don't know the effects and so therefore I say that to claim this that I claim her in my prayers as my sister V me Amen not just sister are conscious mother but I claim her as a sister in Christ amen and so we just want to be faithful to lift them up also in all things and we just have so many needs you know I think if we would all just be honest somebody say if you have a need it take the whole service for us to get through all the needs that we have sometimes we just kind of hold them in and that's fine but we just lift those things to the Lord and and just trust him that he would speak to us in and the tie the season amen yeah I kind of feel bad you know brother Manasseh was texted me the other day and I'm just terrible I'm working and my phone is like where is it's on the dash of the pickup it's in the seat of the tractor it's here and there but a man just actually enjoyed that brother Manasseh if you can deal with inattentive Paul here you just keep on texting me amen hallelujah good to see our brother Sergei here tonight I was just telling brother Jason well he's probably out on the road somewhere Lord be with him and walking to church and here he is so we're happy let's just stand I want to speak to you this evening once again on the preparations of the inner man and I want to kind of title this I had several different ways to title this but I brought this out in this way our current condition and so we'll just look at this tonight and not really thinking about making a greater portion of it but knowing that when we start to preach the Word of God that there's no end to it right it's so interconnected we can just go on we can have part 10,000 amen amen god bless you sister sue I missed you amen Galatians the 2nd chapter verses 19 and 20 and we'll just look at those real quick amen for I through the law am dead to the law that I might live unto God see we have to choose whether we're gonna live by the law or we're gonna be dead to the law now remember the prophet of God said that he divorced you from your first husband Amen it's always a ticklish subject right if people don't understand that to realize that we have already been divorced from sin amen from bondage and brought into the Liberty which is in Jesus Christ I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God now let me just interject this if you don't mind the life I now live in the flesh I live by the confidence the trust that I have in the Son of God can't live in any other way it written on the page even if your name was printed there you would still have to believe and have confidence the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me Heavenly Father we come tonight just ask you Lord to open this to us make it so real Lord we walk out of here tonight our hearts on fire rejoicing knowing who we are and what you have done for us and father knowing that there is a purpose for everything in our life every trial every struggle every sunny day every dark day everything father is for a purpose and we come Lord knowing that the Holy Ghost moving in our mist washing us by the water of the word father is to keep us into a position father to not let us falter not let us fail but holding us right where you desire for us to be day by day we say thank you Lord we give praise and glory and honor to you today Lord we'd sing songs of praise but Lord let our worship come from the depths of our hearts Lord as we lift you up as our Redeemer our savior our bridegroom oh how we love you today Lord we come Lord tonight just to worship Lord and receive from your word in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated you know as I was looking at this there's kind of you might say brought on by a quote and we'll get to it in just a little bit but as we would look at this my brother and sister we would realize that we have to constantly monitor our condition amen you know it's not something that kind of of the old phraseology of once saved always saved now you know that's interesting because the very depth or foundation of a statement like that is absolutely accurate amen the real Bride of Christ before the foundation of the world she's not coming here placed in Laodicea and gonna just fail one day and God turned his back on her amen that's not possible for the word of God teaches different and God is immutable and so we know that he has declared and we believe that so as we look at this we realize that it is a challenge it is the struggle of the Christian now if I use a phrase I don't mean it to be offensive but I'm speaking to the real Christian or the real believer tonight Amen because we can start talking to the unbeliever we have to put all kinds of quantifiers on it we have to put a little sugar here and there we've got to kind of make it appealing but my brother and sister the prophet of God told us that a real Christian the real believer is rugged in fact the real believer is such a believer that you cannot offend them so we realized at the time that we become offended that Satan has actually set a trap for us and injected a little bit of his poison where we become offended over the Word of God or maybe they'll phrase that it was brought in and so we look at that and realize by the grace of God that we have everything that we need tonight my brother and sister and for the days that are coming to be a rugged Christian not a hot house not a hybrid not just a flower that withers when the Sun comes up and things get hotter I didn't include it tonight but the prophet of God said you know sometimes he's talking about Shadrach Meshach and Abednego when the devil turns the heat up amen what happened with Shadrach and meshach they said you know what we're no matter what we'll seal our testimony with our life amen nothing that you can threaten nothing can do can get us to turn our back so when Satan turns the heat up Amen brother branham goes on to say then God turns up the faith in the belly amen so thank you Lord that for every challenge we will face every struggle that we will come to don't get in despair don't say oh how am I going to come out of this okay just believe that God is there and as Satan turns up the heat and gods over here turning up the faith hallelujah all thank you Lord amen so just when we think we can't go any further amen we get up and go further hallelujah first Corinthians amen just want to take quiet it's quite a lengthy reading here and we'll kind of go through it quickly I hope amen but by the grace of God I am what I am now you know that can be taken so many ways right we can use that as an excuse you know the old phrase now if any of your Irish forgive me but you know that used to be you know the Irishman would say well you know I've got a temper you know I'm Irish well hallelujah God broke the cycle and you're no longer Irish your sons and daughters of God amen the family of God whether we proven I trust that it was a linear enough it was clear clarified enough that we realized that the DNA that is in us now not this natural DNA but this natural DNA my brother and sister will live so many years and pass away and you know maybe have children to pass that DNA on but then again you realize all of us are hybrid so in the natural there's no pure DNA you can marry just as Irish as you want to marry Irish or just as much Dutch or whatever it might be but still we as humans are hybrid people a mother and a father right influence from both sides coming in but you see the DNA in us as sons and daughters of God is just as pure as a day that God said let there be light amen there is no pattern no shifting no uh-oh what's the word I'm trying to think of know of turning no shadow of turning amen God just held that just is true so we're just as much sons and daughters of God today as there ever has been through all the generations going right back into creation mence oh hey men by the grace of God I am what I am hallelujah I'm not Irish I'm not Dutch I'm not German had a lot of fun with brother Karl you know brother Karl's just as German his timin can get amen and we got a fair chunk of German in us and I looked him in the face and he's got a great sense of humor I said well praise the Lord brother Karl whatever there is in life I'm not as German as you are hey man and he's like I know brother Paul I know but I can't get rid of it amen oh my by the grace of God I am what I am and His grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain fare hallelujah but I laboured more abundantly than they all sounds like a boast or doesn't he yet not i but the grace of God which was with me oh my if anybody ever comes along and says why you sure sound like your kind of spiritual or you kind of think you're this and ya know hey look you misunderstood it's not me but it's the grace of God that was placed in me amen but it wasn't my brother sister anything that you and I have done but it was God's grace that DePaul's it come right down and in the time when our human element fails that grace of God kicks in it lifts us right up puts us right in the position that we were called to live in hey men now therefore whether were I or they so we preach and so ye believed now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that here is no resurrection of the dead but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is Christ not risen right so you got to come along and decide he's he's arisen or he's not hallelujah amen oh wow and if Christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain you see no way to take a halfway a position on this you know kind of like the guy you know he's there at the Boden and he don't know where they're getting the boat or stay on the dock so he decided to put a foot on the dock and a foot on the boat and it's pretty humorous because you can't do that my brother and sister the dog which I will type as Christ was in movable but the boat under the slightest influence decided it was leaving amen so we can't straddle this there's no there's no straddling the fence as it were amen and then our preaching is vain your faith is also vain yay and we are found false witness of God because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not for if the dead rise not then is not Christ raised pretty blunt isn't it gets right down puts it right to the road hey man you're either gonna believe that Christ is risen or you have been living a life in vain now if Christ is risen and I believe we testified tonight of that if Christ is risen then we have nothing to worry about amen because he has settled all at capri he said it is finished and so when he declared it is finished my brother and sister he doesn't write a sequel to that he doesn't change the ending of this story I don't know if you've ever been there I've read books before and it's pretty funny because they get to chapter whatever it is the very ending of the book and then they have a page that allows you to choose which ending you want have you ever read a book like that I read one one time it was kind of a mystery thriller you know and if you want the hero to come out you know smelling like a rose move to page so-and-so if you want the hero to be shot but live through it go to page so-and-so you know how they can just give the alternate ending of what you would please well my brother and sister God didn't come along and say you know what if you want it to be this way go to this portion you want it this way to be this portion he clearly identified that the end would be connected directly with the beginning with no alternatives all praise the Lord amen and if Christ be not raised your faith is in vain ye are yet in your sins then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished let's see this doesn't fit with Hebrews 11 hey men Hebrews 11 lays the platform that they without us amen are not made perfect so it is declared in the very beginning when they come to the position to step from mortal life into immortality that God had already placed it that you and I had to come as conquerors you and I had to come as the overcomer of this day you and I had to be able to say Amen for this word and manifest this word out because they without us see it's not that they died in vain my brother and sister there's a bride on the earth today she's a believer of the word she's manifesting this word the very life of Christ is becoming her life has become her life and she is standing not of her own accord not of her own ability not of her own thinking or her own desire but she's standing there because God ordained it to be such oh hallelujah we ought to have so much confidence in God we just steamroll the devil every single day hallelujah is a sorry devil this is your alternative to the end of the book but I've already read the into the book and it don't match your end of the book and I'm gonna stand with God's into the book hey man says I'm an eternal being created formed filled in the image of God hallelujah so the devil he's trying to write he wants to be an author hey man he's got a lot of people publishing for him but there's some people that are right here on the earth right talking about the second book of Acts is to be written my brother and sister God's not going to pin it with ink and paper he's writing it on the fleshly tables of our heart in this day the manifested word for the hour doesn't need to go back on a page it's already on the page it's being now written in the hearts of sons and daughters of God and they are bringing that word to life oh my brother and sister if it stays on the written page it's a dead letter you can say well Christ is risen I have scripture for it he's going to come fill us with the Holy Ghost I've got scripture for it he's gonna come and take a rapture he's my healer he's a provider but if it don't come off the page it's of no value to you and I and that's why God chosen this our not to put it back on a page again he said I'm gonna let some people live this out Oh hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord amen because I know that those have fallen asleep in Christ are not perished in this life only we have hope in Christ now catch this how many times we can read over things and I'm not saying you don't haven't seen this but I just want to make emphasis if in this life we could put a pause in there in this day right here what is it July 1 2020 in this life right here if that is all we have only have hope in Christ not a manifestation of him not the real goodness we only have a hope then we are men most miserable but I tell you I got more than just a hope I've got to see God I've got the privilege amen and I think you'll say amen to this I've had the privilege to see God manifest himself in every bit of his word I've got to see it come forth I've got to see him come and manifest it come and manifest it come and manifest it oh my brother and sister not just a hope but a reality amen realities reality hallelujah but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the Dead amen for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order Christ the firstfruits afterward they that are Christ's at his coming then cut the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom of God even the father when he I'll shut down all rule and all authority and all power for a must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet oh my brother sister that is a finished work right there every last enemy every last tempter amen now the prophet of God talking about demons amen I've been studying demonology and brother Branham talking about demons and he says look many of you I'm paraphrasing if many of you misunderstand demons are just as real as Angels don't get an idea that they're just some little fluttering thing out here there just is real as angels now my brother and sister when I kind of harp and gripe and two away at certain things it's because they're just as real as angels that means if one come in and set down on the Pew and decided he would just sit here and wait till the next church service or the next month or the next year my brother and sister unless the power of God comes and moves him out of here he'll just sit here and he'll wait for the season when someone comes in under distress and opened up in their spirit and then they'll attack amen you know what the solution to that is kick ease hide out get the presence of God in the church and in our life so strong that demons can't stay there there's the answer come on but we're not going to do that by coddling it now I don't want to offend you Satan come on that's what's happened in a lot of our churches we're afraid to offend the devil oh now somebody will say now brother Paul's calling them people are devil no I'm not no my brother and sister I'm not calling anybody a devil but the devil don't care he simply don't care my Paul I knows Cephas I know who are you it's not going to be by our power not going to be bar might but by the Holy Ghost in our midst with us hold that for another day Paul amen he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death now look somebody couldn't say brother Paul you're taking this out of context but my brother and sister I want to just tie this together tonight as we move forward Paul said I die daily so you will find now I hope you stick with me here you will find the culmination of God in this man or woman the son or daughter of God the culmination of God in them the Holy Ghost filling them is that they are willing to put themselves to death they are willing to come to a death and in some cases we know in the Dark Ages and even in the days that we live in right now it is a physical death that can be a type two but my brother and sister the culmination for a son or daughter of God is to come to the place that they are willing to die daily a man willing to crucify this flesh every single day amen not like well you know I'll just hold on to an attitude or spirit or whatever it will be for a season but to recognize that the enemy is what we are fighting against and if I need to vanquish my enemy it might be as simple as Lord forgive me Lord I allow this atmosphere this to be put in a certain way I allowed certain things I raised my voice I was angry I was this or I was loud and Lord forgive me amen the word says don't let the Sun go down on your wrath Amen whether it be family whether it be anyone around you the church whatever it might be my brother and sister I hope you're with me now and understand then I'm not trying to take this out of context I'm not trying to hack up the Word of God but I'm telling you my brother and sister one of the last things that we as message believers and I put that in a very broad spectrum it's going to do is conquer the last aspect or auspice of Satan's influence in our life it might be ever so little might just be a sliver reading a story real live history a historical deal of Vietnam you know and and this man was they were in a fight and and this man ultimately they went to get him up to move on I and he was dead a little sliver had passed through the back of his underneath the back of his helmet into his brain it was there hid in the hair nobody could even see that just the most minut sliver I'll tell you that's all Satan needs to do sometimes is just get a sliver into us we're guarding against great big things and we're looking in this and we've throat all the literature and all the movies and all this and all of that and all the clothes and this and this and this and we throwed it out and then Satan would come in with just a sliver for you I've put all things under his feet but when he say if all things are put under him it's almost a hair too big on the screen or am i at 27 yeah it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto Him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all amen else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all why are they then baptized for the dead and why stand we in jeopardy every hour I protest by your rejoicing that I have in Christ Jesus our Lord I die daily he's making the declaration that all of this is irrelevant if this don't come out to pass if he isn't risen if all of this is here then we are in jeopardy but he says what he says without saying it right between the lines is then I believe in this so much that I dry jaylee i crucify myself because I believe this word I believe this life I believe what God has done and I'm willing to die or crucify myself daily because I believe this otherwise we would come to the place we'd say well I don't know maybe so maybe not you know it'll be fine I'll just kind of live this way or that way and in the end if it looks like I'm wrong I'll shift over no my brother and sister when passo Paul believed this word he believed it so much he crucified himself he died daily and a given example he come forth because he knew this was a truth well he had a backside of the desert experience and I pray God would be so kind to give you an eye a backside of the desert experience to bring us to the place that through fiery trials if necessary we could come to the place that we are absolutely convinced that there is not one doubt not one thing that would hinder us but when the devil would come and miss whisper in that midnight hour we could say you know what sorry Satan you know you might be here to condemn me but what you're condemning me under is already under the blood what you're condemning me of is already settled it's already finished I don't know what you're talking about hallelujah because the word has already come amen now he says here I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord I die daily Oh hallelujah what a position he took if after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at ephesus what advantage at me if the dead rise not he just laid it on the line all the sacrifice I've made as a minister of this gospel if this is not going to come to pass then I have labored in vain did he stop laboring no he knew it wasn't in vain he knew he was going to push push right to the reward hallelujah I think we got something in common Amen I think we've got the word for the hour we've got the same anointing Amen the same God same Holy Ghost coming down what they're doing is speaking in very plain words Paul didn't mince any words he said if this is verse then we've just wasted our time but it's not that it is this here and it is not in vain it is a life I was called to and I will live it hallelujah aren't you glad we can say the same thing today Oh hallelujah Amen because it's not in vain my brother and sister amen be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners well my brother and sister the prophet of God talked about this and I'll just draw it out in a slight parallel he said you know don't you say that you're not a good Christian don't you say that you're sick and all these things he said you're talking the devil's language amen so when we start going off into these round if I'm not this and I'm not that you're talking to Devils language I think it qualify as in evil communication Amen we're telling God we're telling the world we're telling our family whoever it might be around us that we just don't think that God's work is gonna hurt my oh my well the Devils say you're crazy brother Branham says you know they call us the Holy Roller he says I went and looked and studied and went through all of this stuff and through all these records and there's no church registered nowhere that's called Holy Roller he said that's a name the devil put on it that's a name the devil used to try to scare you away from it amen oh my brother and sister well you know people get all weirded out well they're kind of getting you know those folks over there kind of getting loose in the joints you know and getting kind of noisy and kind of jumping up out of their seat once in a while and they're doing all this stuff I don't know what's going on with them well I'll tell you don't worry about it because there's no holy rollers here hey man that's just the Holy Ghost coming through scripture said he has been set free it's gonna set on his hands and never worship God oh no he's been set free is free indeed hallelujah well praise the Lord I want to let the world know I've been set free amen awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of God I speak this to your shame but some man will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come now fool not which thou sowest is not quickened except it died now I want you to think about this if the word that has been quickened to you and I is held in such a fashion that we are unwilling now I'm not talking about you having to come to an altar and have a big old session of crying and sobbing and all this stuff but my brother and sister if we're not going to allow that that God has placed in us Amen this very it's black this is a paradox its life but we've got to take the seed that has been sown and we got to come to the stage or the place it dies and when it dies it completely takes self to the grave it can't take portion of us it can't be a suggestion that in a certain time maybe will will will you know adhere to that or move with that my brother and sister it has to die for the seed to live now you know I'll put a natural parallel to that sometimes you know you get into farm country especially where there's no irrigation they rely on the rain and you can plant a wheat crop in the late late fall early winter and that crop germinate sand and it's coming up and you look out and say I've got a beautiful field of grain here but if it is dry or even freeze dried that little seedling will run out of moisture and what went under the snow which I'm going to put us under a trial Amen under a great blanket or depression it can go into that looking so good but when it the trial is over when all of that is gone you've got dead wheat and people say well we've got a problem well you do have a problem but many times all it is is the lack of moisture hey man it didn't get routed down hey man it needed a little more time to get rooted down in the soil it was trying to live just on the surface God sent a prophet we got to get deeper than God sent a prophet because when the trial comes and the moisture amen the scripture talks about the Holy Ghost being the water to our soul when the moisture goes away through the trial and temptation we can find ourselves drying up and literally blowing away but my brother and sister when it comes to the place that we realize I've got to die but in dying amen the scene has already actually sprung forth life before it actually completely dies so we go down into the grave and we commit ourselves to God and we are under that influence of the Holy Ghost that died to our self but remember this seed of life is already outside of there springing to life oh the Holy Ghost moving on you and I bringing something out in us and people say well what is what's happening with them there sir changed a lot there sir this there sure that my brother and sister don't worry about it we just died that's all but there's a seed of life there's something that's already sprung up don't worry about us we're not climbing in a hole like a hermit and gonna live out our life like some kind of a vagabond or something when that seed of life springs forth there's no contention oh I hope you're with me there's nothing for the seed of life to fight will there's no dead self that is not quite dead to contest with up there's nothing there competing with our life or our attraction our commitment of who we are that's dead and we've been raised up a new creature in Christ Jesus Oh hallelujah my hope you don't mind me being excited tonight hallelujah this has just find a been real to me here recently amen hallelujah now I want to look at adoption but a real spirit-filled Church full of the power of God let's hope we can say Amen right that's us sitting together in heavenly places offering spiritual sacrifices praises of God the Holy Spirit moving among them discerning SiC and calling out the things that's among them that's wrong straightened out and making it flat and level now look at this people have a problem with this my brother and sister people have a real problem with this they say well that's not that's that's rude that's rude you call those things out that's rude to speak so forcefully that's rude to to speak the Word of God yet someone might say all that would be this or that situation and you have no right you didn't call it whatever you want my brother and sister but the prophet of God says right here that this is what a Holy Ghost filled Church will do it will call sin out amen it will flatten those things hallelujah now should it be done in a rude fashion in a way that would humiliate him and and be down on people no but my brother and sister let's call let's call it like it is amen let's not water this down let's not put sugar on top of this so we can all go home going over as a sweet service tonight because why always in the presence of God is that bloody sacrifice amen now remember we went through it this morning you wasn't saved by the blood you okay let me just you wasn't saved by the blood you're kept saved by the blood you were saved by grace through faith believing God knocked at your heart because he predestinated you you looked up and believed it accepted it see here's the thing my brother and sister when we look at predestination we cannot throw a free moral agency out the window when we look at at predestination there's decisions that will be made and we will go four years of our life and we will fight and we will struggle and then when we come because we are sons and daughters of God God allows the stage to be set that you yourself will make the decision God does not come get you in a headlock doesn't force you to come to an altar he doesn't force you to commit your life to Him ask for forgiveness my brother's sister God doesn't work that way amen so you look at this and realize now that you're saved by grace through faith God knocks at your heart because he predestinated you you looked up and believed it accepted it now the blood makes an atonement for your sins remember I said God does not condemn a sinner for sinning he's a sinner to begin with he condemns a Christian for sinning and then because he has condemned him Christ took our condemnation so there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit hallelujah aren't you glad that we can tell Satan take a walk take a walk buddy amen we're not sitting here on her own we didn't just come we're not identified oh I'm a Christian because I go to grace Tamra Nicole I'm a Christian because I believe God sent a prophet I'm a Christian because Christ is in me hallelujah amen and if you do anything wrong it isn't willfully you don't sin willfully a man that sins willfully goes out and willful sins never come into that body yet but a man that's once in there he's dead and his life is hid in God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost and the devil can't even find him he's so far back in there he'll have to come out of there before the devil can ever get him and the problem is is we do come out there's the real problem is we do come out and we struggle sometimes and we have problems and we say Lord but I believe your word and forgive me Lord the lust of the flesh and the pride of life heady highminded all of these Adam Lord what's going on because we came out Amen what we're being taught by the word and the conditions that we're in is not to come out no matter how attractive or whatever the bait that Satan uses God's training us you say well couldn't you just put that down in our heart so strong we never would know because then that would take free moral agency away so he allows you the free moral agency and if I can just pick this I'm not preaching to anybody Amen except maybe me hallelujah but you know what happens is as we get over here and there's things in life maybe it's something we actually like to do in the flesh a certain activity a certain thing and we come out my brother and sister and we think well I'll be okay but then we come and Satan gets all over you and he gets in a wrestle and you know what what they say never wrestle with a pig you both get dirty and he enjoyed it that's what it's like wrestling with the devil you both are dirty and he enjoyed it but what happens to a son or daughter of God they come and they realize I've been wrestling with the devil Lord forgive me and they come back in and this grace my brother and sister that we were saved by it washes you right back up again and God don't say well just five more marks and you're out oh no he put right in his word how many times a day he spent he times a day that's what we forgive one another now if God expected us to forgive one another at that level would God not stand on his own word concerning you and I so I'm not condoning that we go out here and keep track but I'm telling you God's grace is sufficient hey man hey man you don't still sin willfully hey men but a man that's in there he's dead in his life is hidden God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost and the devil can't even find him somebody ought to say amen to that he's so far back in there he'll have to come out of there before the devil can even get him for you are dead I like this there's a little bit what motivated this whole service tonight tell a dead man he's a hypocrite and see what happens kick him in the side and say you old hypocrite you he'll not say a word and that's right he'll just lay there and a man that's dead in Christ you call him a hypocrite call him anything you want to he'll never rise up about it if anything he'll slip off somewhere and pray for you that's right but Oh some of them's very much alive that's when I think about we're supposed to bury dead people and then that's dead in Christ we bury them in water and sometimes we buried too many people that's alive too much malice and strife and there's too much in the church but we can't separate that but God does he knows his people he knows his sheep he knows every voice he knows his children he knows who he can call out he knows who he's predestinated he knows who he's given these things to what he's making himself known through oh my how he God can put confidence in his children on what to do knowing what they'll do exactly oh my brother and sister sometimes these things come out straight maybe they come out a little blunt I'm sorry but this is the Word of God hey man this is the day that we live in and the problem is is when you got people somebody said well I did that because they pushed my button well you push the button on a dead man he won't respond hey men they couldn't call you a deceiver they can call you you know false my brother and sister and I'm not asking for sympathy but I'm telling you this is real to me because in the last year year and a part I've been called a deceiver I've been called a liar I've been called false but my brother and sister I go home I cry and I pray and I don't respond and I'm not boasting about that but there's just something that's been in me just leave it alone it's not your battle it's the Lord's battle stand still and let God take care of his hey man you say Oh brother Paul we feel sorry for you don't don't my brother and sister because you see just like you I've got to have my character molded that there life that little bit of life that would Rebell in me the little bit that would want to speak back the little bit that would like to take as it were the message and say well I can prove to you you're wrong but a voice says let it go pray pray let it go now you might say well brother Paul you preached about it that's right I have an obligation to you Saints amen if the spirits sitting on the pew and I will not say there's a spirit here we need to deal with then the day will come that that spirit will blindside you and you'll say what happened what happened and it won't be your fault it'll be my fault I have no plans on standing before God guilty of not in their spirits here and we need to deal with them but people say well it seems like he's sure attacking them those are point statements well my brother and sister we're not going to draw out a great fesus trying to show the devil he's wrong in nice polite politically correct words amen if the spirits here as long and I don't say this is a fence please don't take that way but as long as I'm pastor I'm gonna call the spirit out and you say well brother Paul you didn't used to be we're that way well forgive me but I'm coming that way now I'm gonna stand on it and if it's the right thing I'm gonna say it if it offends somebody I'm sorry but I'm not gonna be politically correct when it comes to these spirits hallelujah amen so they can call you an old hypocrite they can call you a deceiver they can call you whatever they want to call you my brother sister we need to be protein God in such a fashion Lord I want to die I want to die today I want to die tomorrow and I died every day after that that when the voice of leaf would come and speak that I can say oh god help them we're not gonna rise up and call them names not gonna come and downgrade them my words or deep door text or letter or whatever it might be I'm gonna say lord help them I want to see soul save my brother and sister there's no room in this word to come to the place to say I'm right hmm that's pride that's self rising up I'm right huh you might be right but your spirits wrong and if your spirits wrong you're wrong amen god help us come on Saints the Apostle Paul I want you to just catch this when he said I die daily I doubt if we understand the battle this is a man that set out to kill the Christian that's not a faint of heart man that's not a man that's timid that's not a man that's easily deterred this is a man that had a mission and he was going to fulfill that mission this is what God called me to do and God struck him down and he went to the backside of a desert and there he realized how wrong he was and my brother and sister you can say well he just he just struggled with that because he had killed them Christians my brother and sister I struggled with a lot more than just the fact he killed Christians hey amen he struggled under the burden of the word because you see that day wasn't any different than this day oh we think who were so enlightened yeah go ahead build you a pyramid come on how many of us I'm not speaking down but I just want to make this point how many of us has God called the backside of the desert we've got to see the supernatural of God moving right in the midst and coming back with an open book of Revelation you see my brother and sister don't sit here and let's get a big head about how Revelator we are hey man we got a lot of Revelation hey man don't take from that God's given us a great revelation of his word it's been open to us but my brother and sister you see he knows hey man he knows who's his sheep he knows every voice he knows his children he knows who he can pull out hallelujah he knows and we all have the confidence in God to know amen that we were called out hallelujah I hope I didn't tear that up too bad made sense there's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in the same room with Christ Jesus right who are them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh she flits flesh is dead now can we move forward just a simple fact that flesh is dead now amen now you might go out and tomorrow struggle with the flesh but just to remind yourself the flesh is dead hallelujah I don't care devil what you're trying to resurrect in this flesh the flesh is dead hallelujah amen for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do is that it was weak through the flesh amen the law my brother and sister that many examples a prophet preaches amen the man would go he'd offer his offering and a year later he'd be back offering an offering again for the exact same sin and he never overcome it he just shed blood to cover it but we're not talking about that see the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free amen not covering it again with the blood amen over and over again but free of the law of sin and death for what the law couldn't do that it was weak through this flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh come on my brother and sister imagine how hard it was for those people they looked at Jesus Christ and they saw a man I could be mistaken but I believe in one place brother Branham said that God allowed Jesus his life to be such that it caused them to question is he or isn't he so Jesus in that position didn't walk around as an angelic being his feet a foot off the ground going through he made decisions he said things that they would look at and say is he or isn't he I don't know oh my there's a lot of people even today I don't believe it's here in our church I pray that God it isn't but there's people today that are still struggling with it is it or isn't it is this message truth or is it not well if the message is words on a page then you can struggle all you want but if you'll ever catch a revelation that this message is Jesus Christ amen you won't ever have to stop and say well is it or isn't it because if you've met Christ you will know it amen there won't be a question nobody will talk you out of it but if they can talk you into it they can talk you out of it amen but if the Holy Ghost ever comes and touches you you won't be able to be talked out of it amen oh happy where my hat amen the law could not do that is weak through the flesh God sending his own son the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit you know these scriptures take on a new life when you realize this is a dead man preaching this this is a dead man my brother and sister that's standing here opening this word to us it was not a preacher saying I hope so or it might be this is a man that's saying I know for a fact Amen when this happened in you you'll know it amen for they they're after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the Spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God and then how you ever got in the carnal mind now look we live in a rat element like that my brother and sister that will go well you know if I take this job ah how's this benefit I take this job it has this benefit oh but this job's got both benefits but wait this job wants to own you so it's not a benefit we're always dealing in the flesh but there's a difference when you mind that's all you're doing is minding I got to get ahead a bigger house better car nicer vacation better clothes minding constantly tending hallelujah for the sake of time oh maybe catch that thought later for to be carnally minded his death be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is empty against God for is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they are in the flesh cannot please God don't you love verse 9 but you're not in the flesh come on Saints you're not in the flesh amen but in the spirit if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you Oh hallelujah for the Spirit of God to dwell in you the spirit of man must be dead God doesn't cohabitate God wants preeminence he wants to Dominion in other words he moves in he wants the whole house you know ha I just I see this you know all the time something I would have never dreamed about when I was a young man moved out of home and was bouncing around the world you know people will will put on Craigslist or in the paper on the radio I've got a three-bedroom house I don't need someone to share the rent and they let total strangers move right in and start sharing their house Wow it just wouldn't work for me it just would not work they'd be up in the middle of the night doing whatever they want and I'd be in there like what are you doing well we ought to be that suspicious of the devil God's not going to cohabitate with the devil speech amen oh so then that are in the flesh cannot please God but you're not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he's none of his Maya that was pretty blunt wasn't it he's not it's not gonna play a game there and amen well praise the Lord I might need to I don't know how it is I just constantly run out of time it's just it's just tough see Paul speaking I'm just gonna make reference instead of reading all this Paul speaking he makes this declaration I die daily he was laying a foundation he was communicating to a Saints that this is the position that put Paul where he was at is that each and every day Paul had to come and submit himself to God not once or twice a week not just when things were a little out of kilter and we want God to hear us but as a matter of course he come and surrendered or submitted himself every single day well brother Paul I pray well that's good I pray and and this will be something a Saints don't worry about it I'm preaching to myself - we all pray but did we submit huge difference we can pray we can read our Bible but if we leave out the ingredient of submitting then we've simply just become a traditional and we have some tradition that we follow well we've been taught we've been taught we've been taught the Prophet said we've been taught my brother and sister you've got to get to the place that in that you come and say Lord thy will be done there is the ingredient amen there's the ingredient that submission that must come amen now look we jump down here in Romans 8 and we look at this in verse 11 just going quickly amen but if the spirit of him that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal body by his spirit that dwelleth in you so this is the man my brother and sister that has come to the place he has died and God moved in God's got the house he's got the kitchen he's got the master-bedroom he's got the garage he's got the family room he's got it all so if that spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up from the Christ will also what will he do will quicken Hill bring to life he'll be assumption a stirring a raising up and energizing Oh hallelujah I also study this scripture and kind of the reason it was on my heart is I might still get to it but my brother and sister I kind of already blew it when I the other day but my brothers and sister we're not here just to be Christians we walk in there dragging our feet well I made it to church it's Wednesday night July 1st come on God energized us that would be my prayer God energize us amen I come to the house of God tonight not just to preach to you Saints but to get energized hallelujah I didn't come just to be the guy up here that gets to do all the talking you know people are like well you're up there you get to do all talking we don't get a respond well hallelujah I'm sorry I'm sorry we'll give you next Wednesday hey I know a brother one time if I can just deviate for just a second or no brother one time there's young man in his church and he said to home pastor said I just know I'm called to preach okay okay just keep praying month or two went by pastor I just know I'm called to preach said okay just keep praying after about six or eight months or something I don't remember the exact deal now anyways young man comes to the pastor and he says oh brother say I pastor I just know God has called me he said well that's good how about you know like three weeks away that Wednesday night you you preach oh thank you pastor not Wednesday night come this is their testimony this is their story that young man got up there and he was like well I had a thought but I can't remember what it was closed this Bible of a went and sat down come to the pastor a week later and he said that tore me up so bad pastor I went home and I asked the Lord Lord what what did I just do what did I just what and he said the Lord turned me to a scripture and clearly and told me I had a minister in the church he said but pastor I misunderstood my ministry is to whatever is necessary to be done in the church he become the groundskeeper he become a youth leader he became a lot of things but you see he mistook what his calling was but one thing I can tell you we won't mistake about our calling we were all called to be sons and daughters of God we're all called to have a ministry to Minister the gospel of Jesus Christ through our life and no greater way to minister the gospel of Jesus Christ through our life is to be dead to our flesh and when people would look at you and say well I don't think you this and you say well praise the Lord god bless you otherwise go look it up maybe you already have I knew things like that might be crazy but I'll have a word pop in my head and I can't get it out and I'll go back to the message and I did this the other day I looked up buzz saw go look at it man brother branham talks about buzz saw pretty regular yeah got a temper like a buzz saw got all kinds of things like a buzz saw my brother and sister if our flesh is dead there's no buzzsaw in us amen we are not going to respond like an angry Irishman forgive me all you believers that are Irish amen but my brother and sister you see it'll quicken our mortal body by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after flesh for if you live after the flesh you shall die but that other death is what he's talking about but if he through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body you shall live for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father amen now one thing I'll say my brother and sister now forgive me for bringing it out like this but we're gonna come down and find out one day under the spirit of adoption that God did not adopt us as Irishmen and he did not adopt us as Germans amen unless I would you know balance it all out in the church he didn't adopt us as Russians or Ukrainians or or French or whatever else it is well sure Scandinavian or whatever my brother and sister he never adopted us that way he adopted us under spiritual DNA this is my son this is my daughter well hallelujah well I tell you what if we're gonna act like our father my brother and sister we'll have to do most of us a lot of dyin to ourselves hallelujah now what I need to finish this okay we're just right there within a few quotes in time evangelist now today we say a good church member shakes hands with a pastor puts his name from the Methodist Baptist Baptist Methodist so forth lives a pretty good life now we missionaries we see those heathens live life that these Americans so-called Christians can't compare with by no mean whoa now that's an indictment right there see so if it's a good life all that counts then you're saved the same as the rest of them by an idol their morals would smother us smother over until we wouldn't have a chance to stand in their presence that's right and their acts but that's not it jesus said you must be born again in order to be born again it's letting yourself low it's letting yourself not him forcing you it's letting yourself go and die and the Spirit of Christ come into you well pastor I didn't like what you preached I disagree fine deikun Gilliam won't work will it will be visiting the deacon in the penitentiary entirely different death hallelujah entirely different death oh it's letting yourself go and die and the Spirit of Christ come into you then you're no more yours it's Christ in you see the Holy Spirit Paul said I die daily yet I live not i but Christ liveth in me see Christ o my brother and sister we gotta get right back down to the basics get down to the bare bones the prophet of God was pointing us to Christ no other platform no other approach Christ and if I told you I love this my brother and sister I love this and if I told you the spirit of John Dillinger was in me I'd have guns here and be an outlaw because that would be his spirit in me oh I'll tell you I wonder sometimes my brother and sister when you encounter people that are like that buzzsaw they are so adamant you're wrong you're deceived you're this you're that I wonder just what spirit they're manifesting hey man they could stood before Jesus and said you're Beelzebub did Jesus get angry at them and say oh yeah now people would say well he did speak back that's right that's right he identified it what did he do he come right in the church and I bear with me he come right in the church and he had not identified the spirit and he said oh now I'm not pointing at anybody so nobody misunderstand ya ever your father the devil whoa that smoked them they got so angry how dare ya we'll have you to know our fathers are all dead in the wilderness so you didn't like it because you see they weren't dead yet because if they were dead they would have looked and the scripture says that that oh let me get these worse they just slipped right on my brain how's that go brother David the works that I do yeah you know so if my work so my my brain dis literally flatlined right there maybe it's time to close but Jesus told him he said you know look my life my testimony well will testify of this and if it doesn't yes there is you don't believe me believe the works that I do I just it was on my mind didn't just fled yeah so see my brother and sister there it was he didn't have to call him names in that interesting when a spirit will come on where someone will literally retaliate in their disagreement with you and they have to do that by demeaning you something wrong there somebody's not dead look at this I love it spirit of Don John Dillinger was in me and of guns here be an outlaw because that would be his spirit in me and if I told you this and if I told is the spirit of an artist you'd expect me to paint the picture of an artist if I tell you I am a Christian and the Spirit of Christ is in me or you then we do the works of Christ Jesus said in Saint John he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also he said there are these signs have followed them that relief now through the age there has been a time that these signs has not followed believers that's right the Prophet spoke VII spoke about over in Zechariah said there would be come a time there would not be called day or night but in the evening time it shall be light Oh hallelujah I think will disclose there I still got a little bit more but praise the Lord hallelujah oh oh this is a short quote short quote I I plead I plead something it's a short quote but when Christ comes in you've created an altar on your heart and your sins are taken daily the great st. Pauli said I die daily nevertheless I live but not me live Christ liveth in me there's the inner veil Oh hallelujah we talked about getting behind the veil prophet of God teaches us he said look you can't just come up to the veil you can't walk up to the veil you can't afraid to go through the veil you've got to get on the other side of the veil my brother and sister and there it is when we come to the place that we can say with an open honest heart it's not me that's living but its Christ II in me amen we've stepped beyond the veil not words amen anybody can say the words but when it comes from the very depth of the heart Oh Lord it's not me I can acknowledge today Saints it's not me but it's Christ living in me otherwise I would be a complete failure but thank you lord and lord I want to stay dead I don't want to have to say well you know 15 years 20 years ago 25 years ago 30 years ago I died but today I'll rip your head off something wrong maybe that little sliver made it underneath the helmet of salvation and struck them in the brain and they think just because they can quote the message quote the Bible because they can say the right words that they've got it but oh to God that the sliver of God's Word would strike us in the heart that we could die that he could live sister Emmy will you come Oh hallelujah oh love the Lord tonight Saints isn't he good his word is beautiful now forgive me first kind of chopping this up but I tell you I just get excited my brother and sister when I look through the word here's daily living amen this is daily living then this might not be real super super deep but I tell you you've got to get deeper than you think to live it amen this is no surface relationship with Christ otherwise this old flesh tells us what to do and to say and they looked at me this way and they did this and they did that and I'm justified my brother and sister you're only justified in Jesus and nothing of this world right here will ever justify any behavior on our part but let us just die daily amen now kind of skipped over it so I'll just interject this maybe you'll just go on your own homework look this up for the prophet of God talking about checkups amen to do a check-up well I tell you my brother and sister where do we stand tonight what is our current condition maybe it would do us good you say brother Paul I believe I'm doing good well you know what you can check the dipstick on the car on Wednesday and family's gonna take a trip on Saturday if you're a responsible car owner you'll still pull the dipstick on Saturday morning you do do that don't you oh my bad example uh-uh my you guys pull your dipstick once a week once a month once a year I'm getting no response out of you oh my oh my we made a preach a little message sermon come on I know what the title of the next will be when's the last time you lifted your hood hallelujah oh my brother and sister what do we do as sons and daughters of God we go back before the Lord and we do a checkup everything's fine not fine according to Paul but fine according to the word Oh Lord let me check myself day by day by day hallelujah Oh hallelujah hallelujah my oh my listing that little song I just kind of come to me as I was finishing up my notes the more that I surrender amen it worked Saints I know that for a fact the more that I surrender all the more he
