the car I started to think you know we're up on the mountain I climbed mountains you know when I lived up in Washington for years did mountaineering and backpacking and those things when you're sitting up on top of a mountain a lot of times you look back down at the way you came up look at that path that route that plan that you had when you're down in the valley sometimes maybe you don't understand that plan but when you get up there and you can look back down on it [Music] just struck me you know sometimes when when that storm pushes us off the mountain pushes us back down to the valley sometimes we kind of forget that route it's easy to get lost in that storm you know maybe the fog whatever never forget that path I had a Bible here I'd hold it up that path that gets you back to the top of that mountain never forget that and one other thing that I thought about was back when I did that you know sometimes you'd do part of your hike at night maybe early morning the dark hours and you can only see as far as that headlamp as far as that goes and sometimes you don't know what's five feet past that could be at you know a thousand foot cliff it could be a lot of different things but the scary thing is sometimes in the day it's worse when you're up on that Glacier and it's white and that fog sets in never let that confusion get to you stick to the path if you stick to the path you'll always find your way back to the top amen amen life is easy [Music] when you're up on the mountain and you've got peace of mind like you've never known [Music] but then things change you're down in the valleys don't lose because you're never alone with a god of the mountain it's still God in the valley and things go wrong [Music] he'll make them right all right and the god of the good time is still God in the bad time the god of the day is still God in the night [Music] talk of faith when we're upon the mountains all come so easy when life's at its best foreign [Music] for the god of the mountain he's still God in the valley when things go wrong he will make them right look out of the good time is still God in the bad time the god of the day is still God in the night bye amen amen glory to God I didn't know what songs to sing this morning when I woke up Christian asked me last night lead songs today and um this song just came in my heart and I've got a handful of

get out your feet sweet Spirits sweep over my soul hey man aren't you glad you can sing that from your heart amen yours a lot of things that man desires and asks for but I think the greatest and most noble thing that we can ask for is more of our Lord Jesus Christ have him sweep over our life be under the shadow of his wing I just uh for just a second here this evening I want to just bring a tad bit to you and you know something uh sometimes you know we struggle with how to express things and a lot of times we don't speak things out because we're kind of nervous about the reaction and um I think that we ought to get over that we're brothers and sisters in Christ we're the family of God and there's nothing that we're shaming there's nothing that we're putting down in fact we just do our very best by God's grace to lift up and we uh visited Sister Miriam uh there in Meridian a week ago a week and a day ago and um our dear sister was in a very dark place just a very difficult place and um you've been praying for her and we've been praying for her and sister Jerry and I went last night and it was our sister Miriam that was sitting there we walked in the door to the visiting room and she was so happy she just just was bubbling and just over and over saying oh I'm so happy to see you tonight and let's continue to pray they have evaluation you know sometimes and this is the part I maybe struggle to say sometimes we we have faith we believe one thing that Sister Mary kept speaking over and over my God's in control he's in control he's in control but we just want to encourage our sister you know sometimes our bodies get a little out of balance and little things happen and I think they would describe this chemical but uh anyway let's just be praying for our sister that God would just completely touch her because my brothers and sisters those valleys can be pretty deep sometimes they don't look like a valley they look like a canyon and canyons are very closed in feel very confining but by God's grace she should come home tomorrow and I know her children she shared her children are like Mom when are you coming home so let's just lift her up in prayer keep lifting her up that this will just all settle out very well for her amen this afternoon sister Sue calling sharing with us at the VA they put him in brother Dan and I see you and the VA decided that this was beyond um for whatever reason we don't know those details but they sent brother Dan to Saint Alphonsus and um it was there that uh the words that they used as they they might have to uh how did they word that Jerry uh anyway when you interpret that it means they oh they were going to mechanically remove this that was the term in other words surgery and they did do that the lovely thing is is um you know kind of different to see how things work out um sister April it's on shift in the hospital and I told sister Jerry I says now if you and I walk up to the ICU and they're going to go bye sister April she just pushes the button and walks on in so she was able to go sent me a lovely picture of her and sister Sue she gave a hug prayed with her and so the Lord works in mysterious ways so just a real encouragement and then uh sister April also you know she has to be careful not to abuse that position but she's also able to inquire and brother Dan's out of surgery and the doctors believe all is well so we thank the Lord for that so he still has you know issues of blood thinners and different things that they have to do so just remember brother Dan for this back surgery just had now this issue and certainly our wonderful sister Sue remember her in prayer just keep lifting her up Sister April tried to convince her to just spend the night with her but she has a dog and needs her attention you know sister Sue I don't have to explain it so she had to go take care of the dog and uh those of you know Sister Rebecca page Peterson Paige I know Sister Sarah has been very good friends with her through the years uh sister Rebecca has had some struggles in life when we were there in Phoenix I was very encouraged as we walked out of the sanctuary to see her there in the foyer having watched the service been right there on the screen and because of our connection through the years I made a little comment to brother Ron how it made my heart so happy to see her and he was sharing with me how God's been willing her back the devil that Sly old Trickster but he is no match when our Lord starts wooing a son or daughter of God back and so definitely lift sister Rebecca up in prayer uh I want to speak to you tonight everything in its correct place and uh you know we just thank God thank you um and Amen brother Alex playing the piano brother Isaac song leading just appreciate that you know the Lord's blessed us I was just sitting down counting my blessings the other day and that didn't look like a rosary bead and uh but I was just counting our blessings and you know we have so much talent in our church my the Lord is just peeling the layers of the onion off and the talent is just coming out and I say thank you Lord and last but not least before we go into the service I am happy to see you home lots of emphasis on home but brother Sergey just shared their Hickory Bible Tabernacle um some of the details of Ukraine and those things so if you find a moment you can go back I believe last Wednesday I thought brother Sergey just did a a lovely job and it's a difficult it's actually a difficult thing to approach because uh there's there is just such a multitude of influences and different things involved that it'd be really hard to set in front of a group of people and just explain it and brother Sergey I thought you did a wonderful job um and uh we appreciate that let's just stand as we go into the word tonight um uh turn in our Bibles to Luke 19 and 29 we'll read to the 40th verse and um I hope I believe it will but sometimes you just have doubts when you have you know Giant Steps between thoughts and I just pray that the Lord just uh just leads his dear children along tonight amen Luke 19 and 29 and it came to pass when he was come nigh to bethesia and bethenia at the mount called the Mount of Olives and we were just there a few days ago bye a lot of days ago time is flying so fast called the Mount of Olives and he sent two of his disciples saying go ye into the village over against you and the witch at your entering ye shall find occult tide whereon yet never man sat now all the Cults I've ever been around in my life that a man never sat on were dangerous to get on amen so I just want to plant that little thought to you that um well God's got everything in its correct place did you find a cold tide where on yet never man sat loose him and bring him hither and if any man asks you why do you lose him thus shall ye say unto him because the Lord hath need of him and they were sent went their way and found even as he had said unto them now is that any Marvel to us that it would be just exactly what our lord Jesus said any Marvel and as they were losing the cult the owners thereof said unto them why Lucy the cult and they said the Lord hath need of him and they brought him to Jesus and they cast their garments upon the cult and they set Jesus there on and as he went they spread their clothes in the way and when he was come nigh even now at The Descent of the Mount of Olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest and some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him Master rebuke thy disciples and he answered and said unto them I tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out Heavenly Father we ask for your blessing upon the service this evening thankful father to have a part of the body return back to us father just ask you Lord Jesus to just touch us tonight in your precious name amen you may be seated that was one thing I wanted to mention to you that about brought me to tears was to have our sister Miriam sitting there and and we are telling her that our desire to come and do and she said it was so happy because you are the only family I have and that is really what we want the atmosphere that we live in and we project as as a body of Believers to to not just be individuals just brushing by but to literally have a desire or feeling for family amen now as we look at this tonight I just want to Dive Right In and we look here and as Jesus is speaking to them and they come and they're there at the Mount of Olives and at the time of Jesus's time I did a little reading on this and the whole Mount was there covered with olives we had been up at the top of that um I guess you'd call it Hill it didn't qualify as a mountain but you're up there and um the guides had and brother George had arranged photographer uh there I think the man frequents that area of a lot and and uh quite a good photographer I mean a guy jumped up on a rail hanging onto a light pole leaning out just the right picture but then as we went down we visited a few little sites there was uh I don't remember what the name of that uh building and stuff was that we were there and went on down and here we come to uh the area that is reported as it were to be the Mount of Olives the place where this took place and you look at this and now it's just like seems like what's happening in the world just a lot of houses and twisty windy streets there a lot of traffic a lot of noise but you know if you can just stop and in your mind realize that how accurate things are really doesn't matter because our Salvation is not based upon that mount but we can go there and it makes it real to you as we sit in this Garden of olive trees and we're standing there enjoying a little talk that brother George shared and and uh the guide a few words and and you're there and you're just thinking how it must have been for our lord Jesus to have a little sanctuary as it was a little place that he like to come and maybe sit there in the shade maybe rest and but yet there is a supernatural that has taken place on this Mount and as we look at that my brother and sister the Supernatural That's taken place on the mount didn't stop when Jesus left not Supernatural was there it's in the natural it's in the spiritual it's in the types of the word that is presented to us and we can see what God is doing and how that he brings things about now let's just tie this together here is a village Jesus says you go over here to this village now there's very much a chance that Jesus had walked through that Village and that in a way is irrelevant because the fact is that he knew my discernment he knew my divine revelation that there was a cult and where it was tied and so as he's speaking to the disciples he's sending them on what seems to be a very simple little trip but my brother and sister was actually a divine revelation of God that was starting to be unfolded at this point in time and so he tells them you know what you go to the village and as you walk in the village there will be the cold but this is a part that strikes me and he is there and now this my brother and sister I hope you catch and can bring right back into today because when Jesus is sending them now on this little Mission if you would call that the cult is there and when they ask you he could have said not when but when you understand what I'm saying almost one is like if they ask you give them this answer but he's there giving them projecting to them they're going to ask you why are you losing the cold and I'm giving you the words to say and it strikes me how that our Lord Jesus Christ put in the word and told us not to even think about our answer now the reason my brother and sister we don't need to think about the answer because he has already given us the answer to the devil's question amen we have already been given it's been deposited down on the fleshly table of our heart and if we will just calm ourselves from the circumstance of life and just let that still Small Voice it will tell us what to speak I know many times I've got myself in conversations I remember one time witnessing to a lady and and as it come out in the way that I explain things of the godhead she got very angry and I wasn't following it and then she says well you're saying the Trinity is wrong and my grandparents have believed the Trinity my great-grandparents and my parents now and I do and you're saying we are all lost I say your faults and I was like oh my what if I got myself into Lord what do I do what do I do but you know I said the truth I maybe didn't say it in wisdom but God gives us wisdom we listen to that voice it's the voice of wisdom we can walk away and say maybe I should have said it different but later you'll realize you know what that comes from my heart I wasn't thinking about what I was saying that just came from my heart and we have the answer to the devil's question and so as those men are saying you imagine what it would be like some guy walks up he's untying your cult uh what are you doing well the Lord needs him you don't hear any question there was no argument they didn't call the police there wasn't no rancus about this there was something anointed about this situation that it was there that the words that Jesus had spoke had already provided the way and already provided the necessary ingredients and had put everything in that situation in its correct place and so as it is that they are there they're speaking and my brother and sister you know it's amazing as you look at the word that God even needed for this time for scripture to be fulfilled he needed some Pharisees so God includes some Pharisees into the equation there had to be some negative in that equation we say well we could do without the negative but I'm telling you tonight my brother and sister gone has placed negative in your life because you need that it so put us in our correct position sometimes it's dealing with our attitude sometimes in our position sometimes to shake us a little bit so Our Roots will go deeper and so we actually need Pharisees in this day and God put Pharisees into that that they would be there and say hey can't you shut these guys up but I'm here to tell you today my brother and sister there's nothing going to shut up the Bride of Jesus Christ amen the devil would like to silence her you make too much noise you're too Pro you're boastful you're arrogant these are all words that have been thrown out to silence the bride of Christ but my brother and sister we will not be silent we might fall down and have struggles in life our own self where we say oh Lord why did I do that or why did I say that or whatever it might be but my brother and sister the word has anointed you to have the answer oh thank you Lord and so we see how that God's word is perfectly orchestrated God put those Pharisees allowed them to be there give them a boldness to speak against Jesus oh they weren't speaking against Jesus they were talking about the disciples but if the disciples were just in the street screaming hollering whooping a good time you know they didn't have soccer back then I don't guess but you know if it was just a bunch of guys in the street going our team won yes yes yeah they never said a word but because these men were glorifying Jesus Christ we must silence them is that not the same Spirit of the day we live in my I mean you know I just saw a little video this this parent is in a in a school board meeting and and uh he says well I I have my deal but I want to deviate for just a second he said uh you know it's in your school Charter to um say the Lord's prayer before you start your school board meetings and um so you either need to start doing that or you need to uh take it out of the charter and if you take it out of the charter you'll all get kicked out what a challenge and they told him your time's wasting you need to get on blah blah blah and he says no you can't you can't make me and here's the rules you see they want to silence that voice they don't want that voice praising God they don't want that voice bringing a judgment and confrontation to them because down in their conscious they know they're wrong and so this is here where where the Pharisees are just trying so much to just silence it and as you see my brother and sister uh the beauty of God's word and if we sometimes in our struggles and troubles that we have if we will just stop and realize how perfectly orchestrated God's word is we are seeing the very signs that the word has said and the prophet lays it all out it seems I believe to the real believer it seems very simple and the world stumbled over it my brother and sister and such uh uh uh convoluted answers and contradictory answers and you know my the other day this guy you know I just was looking at a deal and this guy he had all of this stuff laid out it was actually a brochure a man gave us in a grocery store you remember the man Jerry and so I thought I'm just going to follow through this man's little guideline and he's got it my brother and sister if any of you got the covet vaccine you now have the Antichrist living in you see no real correlation to a spiritual platform just man's ideas that if you do this and if you do that and and if you allow them to take your money away from you that says in God you trust and give you a piece of plastic that's an antichrist Spirit now this might all well fit in I'm not going to argue with the man but it's not the Antichrist but look how the Antichrist has so veiled itself behind layers of the veil in this realm that they can't see the Antichrist Spirit come right in and goes to church with them they are looking to the outside it's a government it's this nation it's this person it's that event but my brother and sister they don't realize the Antichrist spirit is sitting right in church with them amen now I'll tell you what I want to do I want Grace Tabernacle to be so on fire for God that if the Antichrist spirit's sitting here in church he's sweating I don't want to be comfortable I want him to be sitting here going oh my I hope they get this service over soon I can't handle much more of this amen and I do believe God would allow us to bring the fire of the Holy Ghost down in this building and touch our lives that we would be so under the influence of the Holy Ghost that the devil would look at that and decide he'd rather try to Rob Fort Knox than try to get into your heart amen Hallelujah so brother Branham I want to take a little step here brother Branham shares with us story about how he had went to pray for a baby and he's there and as everything is coming to pass he's in the house ready to pray for the baby the vision comes before his eyes again and realizes either the mother mother-in-law I guess either way I'm right because it was Mother and one and mother-in-law to the other but anyway the the Mother-in-law I believe it is um anybody remember the story well enough was it mother-in-law Grand okay and then brother the vision passes before brother Brian May realize she's not there and then when she does come he wants to move the Hat wants to move the Hat but the vision passes before him again and he realizes I can't move the Hat so as you look at that you see now brother Branham was so under the leadership of the Holy Spirit now look at this look how much God wanted that Vision to come to pass there was no like well it'll be a test for for William Branham he might fail it God wanted that Vision to that healing to come to pass so much that he keeps bringing this and brother is reminded now and he wants to move the hat but realizes I can't do this and I want to say Amen my brother and sister I can't do this but God has a perfect position for every one of us a time and a season and everything is in place just like the cult had to be in the village just like they had to come and sing Hosanna to the king amen and I'll tell you let me throw this in because I'll just skip over it my brother and sister if we'll read that scripture and read it from the heart we'll realize that's a commission for you and I to be lifting praise to God Amen we I don't want no Rock doing my I worshiping for me I don't want or anything else I was called you was called to worship God hallelujah and the devil would try to bring us to a place that we could have this and we're struggling with this and struggling with that and things happen but my brother and sister be on that there should be nothing to stop us from saying I don't care if everything is falling apart I'm a daughter of God I'm a Son of God I've got children that want to serve God I got parents that serve God I'm going to lift my hands and say thank you Lord Hallelujah so brother Brian I'm sharing how he went to pray for it and as it is everything had to be in the right spot everyone had to be in the right spot and the prophet amen this Vision was not my brother's sister vague this PR this Vision was very specific and I want to just take this if you can follow me today my brother and sister God's got a vision for the bride of Christ and it's very very specific it's not for us to take what we want and leave out what doesn't fit but we ought to be looking at this Vision in print form and saying Lord I want to be in exactly the right spot in exactly the right place at the right time Hallelujah excuse me if I get a little excited I was supposed to be working today and I was reading amen imagine God cared so much it comes down that simple even a hat now how much more for us the bride of Christ with an open book exactly right what should I do in this situation it's right here in the book in The Vision what should I do what should I do what should I do it's right here in the vision amen now this is not to say that we had the revelation of it until it was revealed to us but God ordained that in the right place at the right time amen the vision would open before us now my brother and sister it's very interesting when we think about this something we all know but just to bring out tonight that God and so precise in his in his ways and his Works my brother and sister that each one of us at the right time comes to the opening of the same Veil but our Veil same Veil in other words no one can claim private interpretation or Revelation But ultimately we've every one of us come to that opening of the veil at a different time but it was our correct place to receive the opening of The Veil imagine we take we take the children and tell them now you've got to understand this you've got to understand this what we do is make a bunch of nervous wrecks out of a bunch of children because if they didn't understand it they would be thinking ah there's something wrong with but my brother and sister the day will be and I confess this as a positive testimony the day will be that the veil will completely roll back amen children being baptized children understanding who they are as Jesus Christ there's an opening of the veil but one day God will completely roll the veil back and the word will become so alive to them that everywhere they look is the prophet of God said everywhere sunrise sunset everything in the word and in life will be Jesus Christ amen because it has to be in its correct place and so as a prophet of God is is doing this when everything was in its correct place it loosed a supernatural event now that wasn't a supernatural event that lightning flashed across the city and people talked about I saw a constellation and I saw this or that but I'm telling you my brother and sister every time God comes down in our midst is a supernatural event and people will be saying the critics will say but where is God moving my brother and sister I believe I can raise my hand for you tonight we know God is moving it is not a question mark we have answered prayers we have healings we have deliverances we have things that have been given Revelation and so we are not sitting here saying where is it at where's it at because we can stand and say I'm a testimony I'm a testimony of where it's at Hallelujah and so they've come together in the Supernatural power is released and a baby is healed and lives are influenced lives are changed amen now you see as we go back into the scripture you know it's there that we see in this whole picture at least I hope you see it the way I see it but I have something special but it's there what we're seeing my brother and sister is the Angel of the Lord is Walking with the disciples going right up there and I I make this comment about the cult and been unridden but you don't have to worry about it because when Jesus sends you Can someone say Lord send me amen father it is I amen when Jesus sends you and he has given you a clear commission not something outside the word not some man's opinion not your opinion but when Jesus sends you my brother and sister you should not have a doubt that God is going to bring that to pass you don't have to go up there with a snaffle bit and they'll have to go up there with some Buckaroo saddle to deal with this cold my brother and sister they walked up they unloosed it and they took it down there they laid a garment over it and they helped Jesus get up on top of it my brother and sister that animal we're going to use this animal for the example that animal was under the same anointing of the Holy Ghost then God would lay on the heart and life of a son or daughter of God in other words that little cult had to obey the word amen hmm imagine that let's bring this in our modern day my brother and sister they were to Bull in a pasture now I'm not counterdicting what the prophet of God said but I want you to follow this there's a bull in a pasture and the prophet of God would have the same had the same instinct or we have the same Instinct he would be we'd be like where is the gun the prophet of God talks about perfect love I'd like to just bring this in another way my brother and sister that bull was anointed by the Holy Ghost that bull could no more have hurt the prophet then the word of God could fail and God give that as an example for you and I oh I hope nobody thinks I'm being negative here but it wasn't as much about just brother Branham as it was that he as a teacher was giving us a lesson of what perfect love will do in our life oh don't don't question that that it never worked for me I'd have to run not if you were under that anointing that's right God called you to be one to stand there you'd be anointed to stand and the bull would be walking away saying I don't know why I like that guy so much I really wanted to chase him down and kick him around a little bit but I just feel so so warm towards him oh yeah bulls have thoughts yeah so you see my brother and sister what is happening is we're seeing the word anointing the circumstance to come to pass that everything will be in its correct place I want to bring this out if I could when they went to go into the village Jesus give them as a word command he told them go ye to the Village that's against us here the next Village go in the village there's a cult untie the cult tell them it's for the Lord bring the cold back nowhere in that I hope you see this fine line nowhere in that did he tell them to make it happen they were following directions that's all they were doing they had no command to make a demand no command to wrestle a cult and bring it back unwilling so they literally were just following Jesus command any down to it didn't need to take away from it and I hope you really catch this they didn't have to make it happen all they had to do is follow directions why is that so hard for us I I say that with a bit of humor Saints why is that so hard for us just to follow directions but on one side over here can't do it I need a shortcut over here it's like I can't do it until I can do it perfectly he said just go in the village he didn't say now stomp on the outskirts and pray till you got the Holy Ghost stop on the outskirts and pray until you feel Worthy or powerful enough they told him just go amen and they're going to ask you and here's your answer you know I I'll preach to Paul for a minute I attend my wife just pulls her hair out you wouldn't notice it so maybe it's just theoretically but I tend to be a guy that I want to explain things to people and we'll be doing something and I'm explaining to him and Jerry's like care no you don't understand it's not about them it's not about you I feel the need to explain it God said the prophet elaborates on it you can't explain this gospel you cannot explain this word oftentimes we want to explain it so bad we make the mess it wasn't god making the mess we made the mess because we want the people that have the call to understand the reason we're taking they're told is because Jesus is down here on Mount of Olives and we have to take this call to him and if you understood that he was the Messiah and there's a no the Lord have need of it amen who's the Lord they might not even really understood but they were anointed amen I want you to understand my brother and sister when God anoints you and I to live this gospel amen he didn't tell us to go what is that Saint Francis or whatever that is that says uh you know you go testify of Jesus Christ speak if you have to amen you know you look at that my brother and sister now let me just move on so we don't take too much time I just want to put it this way Jesus said it was amen amen amen the word had prepared them with the word so all they had to do is speak what the word said speak amen amen amen go and you will see amen the cult is where it's supposed to be you know I mean imagine my brother and sister I still it strikes me make more than you I don't know but I tell you what my brother and sister when somebody gives you the answer before the questions ever asked you ought to stop and think about it amen and long before the devil ever asked the question of why you think you are amen God already had given us the answer we don't need to listen to The Devil's argument we need to give Jesus his answer the word has already given the answer amen now Isaiah 45 says look unto me and be saved in all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none else now I'd like to ask you tonight what is your alternative there is no alternative look unto me be saved I'm God there's none else sorry if this was a white board we would just take all other options that's it only one option left can we honestly say isn't that where God's bringing us there's no option people say well you know if it doesn't work out be a Christian I can always go where aware that we had God erased it we got nowhere else to go where could I go for ye alone have the words of eternal life amen see how God's setting the stage why it's not that he's trying to force us my brother and sister he's actually bringing us to the correct position now you know I'm gonna put a few things off so I hope this doesn't doesn't um leave a gap too much but I I want to just bring this point out so here's Jesus standing in the midst of the olive trees on the Mount of olive and and as I said we have stood in that little Grove it's a beautiful type my brother and sister because you see oil is representative of Israel and as it is there that the word was in their midst and they couldn't see him so he's right there in their midst and very few people recognized him and now we realize that the olive oil is a representation of the Holy Ghost and the anointed word is in the midst of the church today and very few recognize him so I hope you catch that parallel there he's standing right there in the midst on the Mount of Olives in the midst of Israel and they can't see him and now he's standing here in the midst of the church and they can't see him and the Very type and Shadow of the anointing amen because the olive tree has a direct relationship to the olive oil amen so one must be there for the other to exist and it's there that we realize that God in the midst of the church my brother and sister was the very thing that they claim they say oh we have this we have this but yet the prophet of God are reading it today prophet of God says here is the real type and that is he was standing on the outside knocking trying to get in and they were like I don't know who that is out there we have everything we need but the word said that they were blind wretched naked and declared with confidence I have need of nothing see how that spirit's working and the age it's come right back my brother and sister we are coming right back as though it was a a oh what do they call that I can't remember you know where where the past comes alive again but it's there deja vu deja vu is what I was thinking it's like a deja vu in a sense that this is happening again and the Messiah is standing in the midst of the people and they can't recognize him you notice the Pharisees didn't call him Messiah but they recognized him for his authority and called him master but the Pharisees called many mastery now this comes out and brings out a type that the prophet of God I don't want to go into the whole thing I'll get sidetracked but the prophet of God has brought it down my brother and sister in the day we live in well actually it's all down through time many lords but only one Lord amen many can say these words be recognized by these words but that doesn't make it so that's right now let's just skip over a few things here in 59 brother Brandon preaches where has thy strength gone Samson said oh my Israel when they got settled down when they was on the move all right it was all right as long as they were moving but when they got to Palestine and got settled down then they begin to act or want to act like the Philistines and the Gentile World they wanted a king and when they accepted Saul as their King they denied God as their King now my brother and sister uh you have to read between the lines a little bit forgive me but brother Branham goes skirts right down the edge of this without directly saying it as far as I know and that is when one took the leadership of denomination they made that King over their Kingdom this is what our church says not what God Said what our church says and we see how even in the day I won't go into it because sometimes this these things just seem to take a negative connotation but my brother and sister that spirit is Alive and Well in the land and people will take positions that no this is what said and this is how it's going to be now they're not seeking the leadership of the Holy Spirit right they're not asking the Holy Spirit to come down and lead them and guide them but they're actually taking a position I respect this person they're smarter than I more Revelation than I they have an office higher than I and they said and we follow but my brother and sister the word give us one to follow and it's Lord Jesus Christ amen dominion over our soul does not belong to man but it belongs to our Lord Jesus Christ so they wanted a king and when they accepted Saul as their King they denied God as their King and when man sets the word of God to the side to accept a rulership of a king in their life they are rejecting Jesus Christ amen rejecting God and when we accept denominational barriers and handshakes and classical things instead of the Holy Ghost well then we're denying God is our King I'm telling you I'm not here tonight to deny God as my king he is inequivocally my king amen the King of Kings not just a king but the king of kings and let there be nothing I say this just from my heart not even as a preacher not even a pastor not even in one just from My Heart Lord do not allow anything to rise to the throne in my life that would cause me to look away from you let it crumble before it ever gets to me Lord let it be if it would be business or prosperities or whatever it might be Lord let it crumble before it would destroy me and I would reject you as my king amen amen amen it finally LED them to an aham to a total backsliding they failed to recognize the real King when he come and that's the thing the churches has done today they've accepted all this other philosophy and doctorate and psychology and all these different things instead of receiving the Holy Ghost my oh my is that not powerful now the king is in the midst of the church I hope you're following me amen the king is in the midst of the church and get this it isn't that they just outright rejected it they don't even know it right right how could we have a king sit in our midst and not even know it but we can go right back in this thought that we are on right here and see Jesus right there and going right through Jerusalem going right through Bethlehem going right through Nazareth going right through all of these places and very few recognize that the king of kings was there in their midst oh my you know the word repeats itself amen the kings in the midst of the church and they don't know it they rejected it just exactly the way they rejected Jesus there so is the church rejecting him today why because they accepted an Earthly King amen my oh my what a position my brother and sister hmm had a thought there I was going to share maybe I wasn't supposed to so as we look at this my brother and sister we'll see how God is moving and I Marvel this will sound like brother Paul has no Revelation and has digressed hope you don't mind but I stop and I Marvel at all the nonsensical foolish ridiculous things I've done in my life give all of us a moment to ponder that and I'm going to put it in a little different way if you follow me God didn't care that you watch Jesus go by on the cult he didn't care that you had no reaction because there had to come a time and in that time amen you could not reject him even if your flesh wait our flesh did not want to we couldn't reject him it didn't matter that there was a Pharisee saying hey silence them this is not even truth we have the truth we've always had the truth silence them they don't matter who says now no no see how history repeats itself Saints but we're in the day that God by his mercy and his grace says up I'm not you I I need you I've got a time I've got a place and the correct place it's going to happen now that might be over simplistic of explaining I guess but my brother and sister I I'm so thoroughly believe the words of the prophet that when he says if you were in him then you will be in him now and if you weren't in him then you won't be in him now and then I asked the question what do we have to worry about that's right what do we have to worry about amen my brother and sister God has already put us in the correct place oh I tell you that makes my heart stir I just think Lord thank you oh and the devil reminds me of the foolish things but I just look back and say you know what Lord thank you for forgiving me not begging for forgiveness Saints understand not begging for forgiveness stand in that position and say thank you Lord for forgiving me because he's dealing from the position of a finished work so when we say Lord forgive me he's saying what are you talking about I like that now that's no license to behave in your way but the devil's a slippery old character amen now I want to just hurry right along here this quote right here the super sign amen this is a super quote that talks about a super sign amen but look at this he didn't come in the Polish of the world the way they expected him to come but what did he say a virgin shall conceive amen that was a sign that was a super sign a virgin shall conceive amen a super a super sign not a natural sign but a super sign a Virgil virgin conceiving see a supernatural sign Supernatural you think brother Brown was trying to convey to the people something Supernatural is taking place oh my amen never did before but she shall conceive what was it to be his name Shall be Called Emmanuel how will it be God and man will become one now my brother and sister if God started off on the plan for him and us to become one I tell you what it makes me nervous when people say we are not one I I'm I've gone over some of my nervousness because maybe they're not in those certain place yet and they will but for me I believe for you we sit here today a clear recognition that God's full intent for this hour for this message to come and the unfolding of the word and the Revelation the veil being broke to step in there and realize that there is nothing separating us from God now the veil is it rained the veil is gone and so God is there face to face and we have become my brother and sister as the scripture says we don't know what we'll be I'm paraphrasing this ah we don't know what it will be when we see him but we do know we shall be as he is oh you look at that we don't have to question what's it going to be like over there we're going to be little Gods amen and we're going to be worshiping Our God our Father oh I'll tell you what I get excited about that amen that God and man are one the super sign was that first man that God could come into all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into you um don't be thinking about a building with a with a bell tower and whatever else you are his church you are his dwelling place and he poured it amen now do you understand I wish I had a something I could pour it into I'm telling you my brother and sister when you get to the point that you have tipped it far enough you can't retrieve it he poured it into the church he didn't say now I'm going to have to take the church and pour it back into myself because the church is not going to be able to do this the church won't be able to handle this Revelation or I poured out more than it appears that they can hold no sir God committed himself do you do you follow me God committed himself and he poured it into the church he poured it into you he wasn't looking to see whether it would fit in your life or not because he knew it would he didn't have to say I'm going to see if this will work he knew it would work oh my God Amen I hope I'm not getting too excited tonight amen God the world could only see that God Manor won the super sign was that first man that God could come into all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church super sign God and man together that was to be the Super sign of the last day when the entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the last days what was he doing he broke open the book he broke open the book Amen brother Trevor sister carry you right here but he started pouring it in and he didn't have to say I hope it will work I I hope it will fit I hope it will no he knew when this book was open when the seals was broke and he started pouring the word into a bride in this hour he knew that the bride could handle contain whole and be revealed in that word he didn't have to sit back and Hope amen yes entire Bible was to be fulfilled what does the word say at the sounding of The Voice seventh angel messenger amen the mystery of God see this is where I I don't understand where people struggle over this the mystery of God might be could have been should have been maybe have to abbreviate it you know when a author writes a book this is the world that it is now they figured out people so much I don't know what your favorite kind of book is it were if you were reading something but certain kinds of books need to be a certain length and they literally a man writes a story a woman writes a story and they say that's a good story but it's too long or it's too short so they figure out if you've ever read a book that just has a bunch of mindless details and she looks so pretty in that dress the blue shoelaces who cares about what color shoelaces she's wearing you know what that's called filler they're filling up the story but God's got another kind of filler it's called the Holy Ghost and it's not a story it's a life it's a reality and he's pouring it into you and I not needless details see that's what the modern church is trying to do say some of these details are needless but God says I'm going to pour the whole book Into You amen and what I'm going to do is put you in the correct place because in the correct place you'll be able to receive everything out of the book you won't come to a place and say well praise the Lord I'm full enough I'm pretty sure I can make the Rapture on this um no no he puts us in the correct place that we're like Lord whatever you have for me whatever I need Lord you just pour it out father I'm here to receive it I'm here to live it I want it to be amen amen oh get lost here okay a super sign a virgin shall conceive and this conception when it's brought forth will be God manifest In the Flesh a super sign they still won't believe it maybe some of those same Pharisees that were there asking Jesus Master tell them to be quiet maybe they were there for some of these other Miracles other Supernatural they still wouldn't believe it remember that man that challenged brother Branham to hurt that little girl so we can see you heal her see the spirit my it's like what do you think what do you mean hurt a little girl you have some kind of spirit forget about this man here what about the spirit that's on you wow but see the religious worlds like C wouldn't accept the challenge hmm no it's not how God works they don't believe it but it was anyhow still a super sign not a super sign they've got a Superman today now I want to just throw this out to you as a sideline here I've got to hurry it's already nine super sign they got a Superman today remember when Trump got elected a wave across America are Superman well he must have flew through the flame somewhere because his cape is singed and it doesn't look so super right now but I can give you this assurance God ordained a man named Donald Trump to be a president of the United States of America and no signs in any conflict but every world leader that's there and everyone with a yay and a nay and whatever they have is ordained to be in that correct place right now amen I read a little deal the other day somebody said well all they got to do is go assassinate Mr Putin my brother and sister the word of God give you an example going backwards the word of God is so powerful in protecting the prophecy that many a memoir was written about men who night and day dreamed and and strenuously pursued and the mental battle they faced of assassinating Hitler but never did it and it shows right there that people go into carnal mindsets and they think oh we have the answer we'll stop violence with more violence but the prophecy says not prophecy written on the page see God Denver gave the answer to all of our problems to the prophet we get to live it out because why sometimes the stress and strain is what it's going to take to put us in the correct place can somebody lift a hand and say thank you Lord I want to be in the correct place I want whatever happens in my life to place me right in that place Lord you want me to be not how I feel but what you want not my will Lord but thine be done amen amen let me just finish this uh but the church has got a super sign God back in the oh nope here I am moving here just a second um notice super sign they've got a Superman today they've got fictions of Superman all these other kinds of super things but the church hey he's talking to us the church has got a super sign God back in the church manifested in human flesh oh I'll tell you my brother and sister that is a super sign that we can sit here tonight with an absolute confidence knowing this is not a pipe dream this is not something we fell into or got convinced of but it really is God writing on the table of our heart tonight amen we don't have to look in the past somewhere but tonight God is riding on the tables of our hearts amen and he is writing this story that we are going to fulfill or are fulfilling right now he's writing this story and it puts you and I right in the correct place you know there was those books was written about the Left Behind series I never ever read them but I've read excerpts and stuff from it now my brother and sister a book to become such a bestseller of two-thirds of Christendom that thought they were saved left behind I'd like to talk about the other group I'd like to talk to the ones that the only book they would know would be the book that said I called you before the foundation of the world I have finished this work and I will finish the work I began in you and the words go on and on and on that's the book I want to talk about not the book that talks about being left behind and I as a circle back to finish this amen you come to the place my brother and sister as God is manifesting his word and the book said write the word who was speaking in the very beginning the word and the word says I've called you and I know I know what I have started I know what I called you to do and nowhere in there does he pin failure nowhere there's not a single place that he comes and says you my beloved will fail he's sure super sign notice the Eternal sign amen and unfailing amen sign amen we just have to follow the sign we don't need to question how the sign works or why it would be where it's at or what it's going to do or how it did what it did we just have to follow amen that unfailing sign I love it it'll never fail man the word and man become one I think I'm going to take this home with me amen when God's word and man become one as Saint John first chapter says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's amen a super sign Hallelujah I'm just going to ask you tonight is there any of you ever witnessed a super sign I'm telling you what I thank you Lord to be a witness of the super sign if that's super was the Super sign of that day when that same spirit that was on Jesus Christ comes into his church to manifest the written word for today that is still the super sign amen Amen brother Alex would you come Hallelujah my I tell you you know when you study when you study these things you just get so excited you just you know it's like you you just your spirit just starts just bubbling up and it's like oh my Lord look at this I want to put it this way if you don't mind I am a super sign the only super part is a part of my Lord Jesus Christ and me but yet get this our correct place was to be the Temple of the Holy Ghost that was our correct place I did not read anywhere it says now after you can explain after you can now get this this is kind of a crude way I'm putting it not after the place you come you can regurgitate it that's right after the place that you're good enough you can live it no it comes after the place we let him live it through us that's when we get to our correct place hallelujah thank you for being patient tonight amen sometimes you just get so excited just gotta

I'll add a big house and a nice Garden this is all in the kingdoms all inclusive spout him but look what he did he says nope nope the word says the word says now I want to just close this and I won't preach no more when he made that deposit in you what ability did that give you just as we go through a song book or our Bible or whatever the word deposited in US leaves us in a place we could see
