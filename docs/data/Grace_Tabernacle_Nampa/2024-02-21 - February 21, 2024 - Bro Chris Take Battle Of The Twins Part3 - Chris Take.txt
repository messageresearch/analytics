part of the layoffs uh she's been with the company I'm with now for over a decade and she was just another number on a chart somewhere so she has a a family and she's also not a citizen so she goes back once once a year to India so I don't know how this is going to affect them and visas and everything so you know I told her we I'd keep her in her prayers and it's interesting company I work for is very liberal we stream so I won't say who but and uh it's funny no matter who you tell I'm praying for you they always receive it with gladness everybody knows at the end of the day amen if you have your Bibles tonight musicians thank you brother Paul let's turn to Revelations chapter 19 I wanted uh to continue on this thought of the battle of the Twins and um Sunday as I was sitting there in the back the thought came on to my heart and very strongly it's been it's how it how it how a thought comes to me anyways um it's always there it's always God but it was almost like God said in an audible voice so I have expectations tonight that the Lord's going to minister to to us and you know the devil's fought tooth and nail but I find when the devil is most nervous God speaks the most direct to us so Revelations Chapter 19 Verse 6 and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of Mighty thunderings saying Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready thank you and to her was granted that she should be a raid in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints Genesis chapter 4 from Genesis Revelations hopefully we won't be long tonight Genesis 4:3 and in the process process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord and Abel also brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord excuse me and Abel he also brought of the first things of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and and to his offering he had no respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell the Amplified says he was very annoyed had a look of annoyance on his face amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we ask that you just come and speak to our hearts tonight Lord these words on the page mean nothing unless your life is behind them so Lord I I don't want my opinions behind them my own personal thoughts I want your presence your anointing your inspiration to be everything that backs up the words to be said tonight Lord we it's not me here Lord you have something to say every every time we come to church you have something specific to say to us Lord and we want to be attentive to that Lord we want to pay attention to that Lord Jesus for your words are live and if we can hang on to those words we can find ourselves growing in the life of Growing With The Life of Christ so I pray you just minister to our hearts tonight bless those that couldn't be here with us tonight may be with him we ask we love you Lord and thank you in Jesus name we pray amen you may have your seats tonight so my thought like I said I wanted to continue on the battle of the Twins and um I wanted to take the thought of the two altars now when when I begin to uh think about this um I think more along the lines of the altars you know Cain and Abel had the altars but I I I I realize that there's there's uh there's the an altar holds more layers than just the sacrifice of an animal or sacrifice in our hearts the altar is the place you get married and uh so I'd like to take kind of that angle tonight but the Lord help us as we kind of lay out a foundation here so in Hebrews 11:4 we read that by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh so Abel had something Cain didn't have they both had the the altar they both had a sacrifice but Abel had the right sacrifice because Abel had something Cain didn't have and Cain couldn't get though he was given the opportunity he couldn't get it so same altar different sacrifice uh and this is from the Amplified version 1 John 3:12 and not be like Cain who was of the evil one and murdered his brother Abel and why did he murder him because Cain's Deeds were evil and his brothers were righteous so last time we spoke we talked about we kept with the same thought the battle of the Twins and we talked about how we need opposition and and the flesh is the evil twin right and the righteousness of the Holy spirit is able within us or set because we don't want it dying right and we need it we need that opposition for us to grow in character of Christ because without it without a sickness there's no healer without there's no need of a Healer without a loss there's no need of Saving right so we need this opposition it's what gives us the strength so the flesh is actually our Ally in a way because it's it's the battle with that is what increases our faith and so here we have we have the Canan Abel controversy the can and Abel you know hit the front news Cain's murdered his brother Abel right this this moment in time boils down to two things Cain's Deeds were evil and Abel's were righteous so at the Bare Bones it's Evil versus righteousness and this idea this subject carried through the scripture there's many many examples of this battle of the Twins and this quote here in questions and answers on Hebrews part three he says now watch Cain's children were always and before the anti the lovian destruction they were the smart people footnote I I edit the quotes so they're readable so if you can't find them because I edited it you just come to me and we'll set it straight they were the smart people the scientists the educ Educators and very religious but was The Condemned bunch I I don't change the quote though take out the stutters and very religious but was The Condemned Bunch see now watch they were just like their father Cain Cain he was a religious man he built a beautiful Altar and made a beautiful church and tried to make it look prettier than that little mission that Seth had down there did you know that he decorated the altar with flowers and fixed it beautiful and made it pretty and made a great big swell church because he thought that he could find favor with God by doing so so he he had the right desires he had the right desires but he executed it incorrectly and Abel went over same same message went over and got a little lamb and started pulling it over to the Altar and laid it on a rock and killed it and now if God being just if all he required was worship Cain worshiped god with just as much sincerity as Abel did right both of them were sincere both of them was trying to find Grace With God they were neither one of them infidels they were both absolutely Believers in Jehovah now there that gives us something to think of so right down to the end of it TW we have these twins even from birth they were SE and and Cain had everything that Abel had but the secret ingredient right and so if we could break down what happened there um there at when Cain had his Cain enable we have this showdown here uh first of all they both built an altar okay the altar wasn't the problem the sacrifice was the problem so they both had an altar they both had a sacrifice they both went through the the same general motions right Cain didn't murder a watermelon um but he still went through the same motions of gathering the fruits and the vegetables or however that he did it and he laid that out there and and he was giving the fruits of his labor and Abel was giving the fruits of his labor because Abel was a Shepherd so there was a sacrifice given one was accepted one was rejected oh I am sorry that is terribly small um one was accepted one was rejected and and then and then there was this dialogue with God now we we we we only read of the dialogue that Cain had but Abel had dialogue with God Abel had a relationship with God he had communion with God so there was this ongoing uh communication between him and God because he knew what God expected in the sacrifice then we have Evil versus righteousness so we have the two right now we have we see the manifestation in Cain up to that point we don't know if Cain ever manifested evil in that way he could have been act in the same way as Abel but then it came down to this point and and uh how many how many times did they sacrifice if you read scriptures as it is it seems like this is the first time so who knows the history here but we still have this this this moment where evil is vers versus righteousness because Cain's Deeds were evil and Abel's were righteous right we read that in the scriptures and then judgment was delivered Cain in this story Cain murders Abel and um then there was judgment passed to him from God and and Cain said says this judgment is is too much for me to handle so God puts a mark upon him a mark is given to him but then Cain goes off and and now we have down through history we have the war and then Cain mixed right with uh the the the sons of God saw the daughters of men but in that moment God God righteousness was resurrected so Abel dies and his blood cries from the ground Cain is judged he's marked at cuz he says hey it's too much for me to bear and God says I'll mark you anybody who kills Cain will be cursed and so but then the story doesn't stop there Seth Seth is righteousness resurrected he is the next son right Seth is born and from then then we have you know the lineages on down and if you read it backwards which was the son of Seth which was the son of Adam which was the son God so righteousness was resurrected so if you break this this this this battle here that down and and this is what you get a nice bullet pointed list and we all love bullet points right and um this same pattern uh manifests itself in our own lives manifests itself in the battle that we face in in the in the the battles between evil and righteousness the battles between the Twins down through through history and so you know you have to have the right sacrifice so now let's let's step from there there we've laid out the the situation between the two altars because that's what we're talking about and and and now we've abstracted this this pattern of of laid out here and so let's take that and now let's step into that if we can tonight so you must have the right sacrifice and in the marriage of the Lamb brother bam says Jesus's bride is not a dirty bride he wouldn't have a dirty bride a woman come up to get married she looked like she come out of the pig pin out there a man that's got any dignity about him wouldn't marry her he'd make her clean herself up and when the Church of Christ comes up to get married thinks she's going in the bride with all the world tagging on to her Christ's bride won't be like that no sir neither is the Church of Christ of the Lord Jesus Christ that church is not a ragged church either which with worn out Rags of denominations she don't have to be a member of some great denomination she has to be Blood Washed Blood Bought not saying we belong to the biggest church the biggest organization or this that or without spot or wrinkle by the blood of her Savior Jesus Christ so now how does this quote fit in okay so so Cain and and Abel both had altars they both built altars but it was it was Abel's sacrifice so now in in in in in the Christian walk we come to an altar we must lay our lives down we must submit our our will we must we must surrender to Christ who is there asking will you come will you come and be one with me and there's a process up to that point but when it comes time for for the ceremony to take place and you are sacrificing your own will to Christ you must be the proper sacrifice so if you come straight out of the world and you keep the world on you you keep the dirtiness of the world on you you come to the altar God will not accept your sacrif sacrifice he won't accept people say I've tried and and God just won't do anything but there the sacrifice they're presenting is not the right sacrifice it'll be the same flesh you'll see the same person the same color eyes the same color hair but the time when God receives them they are in a position and they are ready to be sacrificed you know the the if you look at at the at the pattern of the Tabernacle in the wilderness and uh the temple worship ship the sacrifice had to be clean and had to be certain you know with the the right lamb and everything and and even Christ himself had to be prepared and be the right sacrifice on the cross so when it comes down to the point where God is is here to accept you as part of himself so that the two become one you must be the right sacrifice that is why you must be justified and Sanctified so that you're in the Bri position you know that young lady that the the the the rich man from the from the East comes out West and he finds her why did why a whole year she had to have time to prepare herself go he chose her he saw the potential that she had as a wife God saw the potential while we were yet sinners Christ died for us so while you were filthy while you were dirty God saw in you a bride but you still had to be washed he looked at Cain he said Cain I'll accept your sacrifice if you do what able did if you come the right way I will accept your sacrifice why is that in the scriptures God knew Cain wouldn't accept it we know Cain wouldn't accept it so why did God put that there because that is the point you have the choice you have the potential but you must come to that position where you surrender where you are a proper sacrifice for the ceremony of being married to to Christ so there's a lot of time there's a lot of things that have to be done and many times we we meet people who are in this point in this journey and we can understand why they're acting the way they're acting and it's simply because they're in that they're in that stage they're transitioning from sanctification to receiving Christ as their husband they're they're they're in the church they're Christians they're I don't know why we're going this direction they're Believers they're serving God they have the potential to be accepted as Christ's beloved before the foundation of the world he saw them as his beloved but in that position they're not a they're not a pure sacrifice just yet right in Matthew 22:8 turn there with me if you will Matthew 22 so this is the parable of the wedding feast made a marriage for his son now can we all agree that we on this side of Glory must receive the seed of Christ therefore we are married to Christ so the marriage of the Lamb has happened right y amen where does that put this Parable then this Parable doesn't happen in glory no nobody is going to appear in glory without the right garment on right this is happening right now the Kingdom of Heaven let's go back up to verse two the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King which made a marriage for his son and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come again he sent forth other servants telling tell them which are bidden behold I have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready right first pull second pull come into and all things are already come unto the marriage but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servants and intreated them spitefully and slew them when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their City then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy go you therefore into the highways and as many as you shall find bid to the marriage so these are the the the people who are not so clean these are the people who are spending their times in the pig pins so in order for them to come to this marriage something has to happen and when the king came in to see the guest he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garbage so this man at at the the altar if you will but his sacrifice is wrong his sacrifice is dirty dirty his sacrifice isn't clean he's not in the right position and he says unto him friend how camest thou in thither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless then said the king to the servants bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer Darkness there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen so I can't begin to say I understand everything about this Parable but let's let's just pull out an important piece here in the wedding supper but said says and the King's son the bridegroom stood at the door to receive the invitations and each one that come with an invitation the bridegroom received the invitation and the father had given the invitation no man can come to me except right come to the father said come by me he came and handed it to the bridegroom the bridegroom in return put a robe on everyone that come in as identification as a proper sacrifice oh my put a robe on everyone that's good or bad rich or poor all looked alike now this this robe is none other than the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the robe he says in a type the robe that Elijah which was the old Prophet a type of Christ Elisha that followed him succeeded him was the type of the church for Elijah done four I believe out might have been eight or eight four or eight I don't know for sure now outstanding Miracles and Elisha the church asked for a double portion of his Spirit a double portion and he said keep your eyes towards heaven then and if you see me when I go up you will have it and as Elijah was caught up in a whirlwind a cloud of fire and was received out of the sight of Elisha Elijah threw back his robe and Elisha put it on and walked down to the Jordan and struck it said where is the god of Elijah and done twice as many miracles as Elijah did Jesus told the church these things that I do shall you also and More Than This a double portion of this and they went out to the day of Pentecost scared powerless helpless and waited after the Ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ and he threw back sent down from heaven the very same power the very same robe that he wore come back and fell on the church the Holy Ghost the robe now we read it we read a scripture in Revelations that said that that and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints you know our righteousness is but filthy rags but is through him and the resurrection right the resurrection of what the the flesh has tried to the the the the curse of the serpent has tried to ruin God has resurrected that within us through the faith in him right amen so now so you you can't you can't you Justified he Sanctified and maybe I might contradicted myself but we're going to patch that up right here in order to even be there to be in that ceremony you must have the Rob on so sanctification is not enough you must come and be the right and the only way you can be the proper sacrifice for the ceremony is to be filled with the holy spirit because now you are a righteous you are a clean vessel that God can can can can bring into him you see it's it it's you must go further in with God you you you can't just stop you the Holy Ghost and all of that that's the bottom of the pyramid we've got to step further into Christ so now God has provided an altar right God's chosen place of worship he says there we have it then this is it alone I need to slow down it is for him alone God's chosen place of worship so God God chose to meet man was not in a church not in a denomination not in a Creed but in Christ right right so so Cain you know he had the Altar and he had the sacrifice but he he missed Christ so you say say well it's in the church well that's not good enough God's not in if you will right he's not in a church in a building God is with his people yeah that's right and and and when you know I was telling my wife this the short time that I've been alive I started to learn not to to uh stress too much about people's current position right because I like to say God works in years you know many many examples where God worked in years in the scriptures not days he does do that but the average and you see people and and and it's it's us it's our flesh we get upset because we see the potential that they have and we look at their lives and we say they are ruining the they're ruining it but God you know I I said I was talking to her my wife and I said you know this certain person you maybe they maybe they get together with this guy and uh they start going to a Baptist Church and their lives changed I by God's grace I would encourage that because they're that's the place they're going to start and when more truth is revealed to them they'll step further forward and when more truth is revealed to them they'll step further forward till they step out of that place into God's provided place of worship so truth it's like you know you it's like you leave a little crumb right you I don't know what do you what what are you trying to get to follow you maybe a dog maybe it you know you don't want a bear to follow you but you leave food scraps along the trail you will have a bear following you but God God drops these nuggets of Truth and so what I'm what I'm trying to get across is is there's we it's a journey and and and there's so many different places along that path even for myself even for each of you and and and if and if we're not careful we we we look and you know we've heard our pastor say we're all looking at the same horse and we look and we say well there's no way they're they're way off they they they they've missed it but but they're holding truth they're holding on to truth and there's there's a progression there's a journey to the Altar and and then when you get to the altar I mean there's a lot of married folks in here it is not all cherry blossoms and chocolates when you're married because I'm getting ahead of myself but you submit your will to Christ and he you become married to Christ you submit yourself guess what you have to do every single day submit your will to Christ so you you you become in this position of where you're a sacrifice ready and then and then God takes you and he accepts you he accepts your sacrifice now there's communion now there's dialogue with God but then every day what what is happening to the bride here on Earth right now when you come to church when you read your Bible when you listen to the sermons you are being judged by the word judgment just like judgment was delivered to Cain in a negative fashion he missed it you didn't miss it but God is judging you every day he say you know what you shouldn't have done that you should have do this you know to do this you need to start doing it the word of God is is judging you and it it's this it's this relationship that that you're married to Christ but you don't always act like it you know you married to your husband but you don't always do what pleases him vice versa but see because when you have you have this battle between evil and righteousness because the marriage is consummated you're part of Christ and and and and um but the flesh still Wars against that Union the the the the evil of the flesh the Fallen nature of man Wars against the righteousness it's it's Cain attacking Abel but through Christ through the very relationship that the evil is fighting against this this twin this battle of the twins right there as you lay the flesh down by surrendering to your husband your relationship with him Str strengthens you get stronger and stronger sorry I I dreamed this years ago just hit me you you you have this relationship with God and and and and I just feel like I can't get it out every time I preach on this it you you you married to God you have a relationship and it's the thing that fights that relationship that strengthens that relationship when you overcome it and how do you overcome it by getting strength from him so the very thing that's it's like you know I was talking to my wife about a situation and I thought I said you know what as an example a very dark example if someone's hooked on drugs what's the one thing they're going to fight the hardest for the drugs but it's the number one thing that's ruining their life so if you take the drugs you don't like them you don't love them you hate them so many times God is trying to take the thing and we're grabbing on to it and we're saying no don't take this from me I have to have this and it's that war and then we give it up finally by God's grace we give it up and by by giving that up and surrendering that all of a sudden again we look to Christ and we say wow you always know what's best for me wow you were right and every time maybe I say this a bit tongue and cheek every time husband is right the wife has a new look of respect on her face this man really knows what he's talking about the husband says yes and as soon as he says yes he steps in a a mess but you see but God doesn't step in the mess because he's perfect so we look to him and we say wow now the next time we face that again we are stronger in that position and the only reason we're stronger is because there is an opposition not to respe last time but in God's that's why God's provided place of worship is in Christ you see that's the only place that God will meet a man he can worship God is in Christ that's the only place no matter if you're Methodist Baptist Catholic Pro Protestant whatever you might be there's only one place that you can correctly worship God that's in Christ Romans 8:1 said there is there therefore now no cond Nation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit he says that's the gospel amen that's the gospel you see it it's praise the Lord so righteousness resurrected you know before I go into this we there was the example of of of Cain right judgment delivered and and I said God judges Us by his word every single day well well there was another step in there and that was the mark given to Cain but we also received the mark it may seem a little bit weird to take such a dark example and Shine the Light of the positive but you see it's this twin it's this battle between evil and righteousness these twins where as long as you step into Christ it looks similar but it's hits the mark perfectly because it's what God wants because the devil cannot create he can only pervert so you are marked I'm marked we're marked by the ring the promise of holy wedlock with Christ we're marked there's a difference about you people notice that difference because the spiritual realm is a lot more real than people give credit to so people know you're marked by what because you've been with God you've been with Christ you are married to him and you're marked and through this Union there is a right the righteousness through this Union with Christ righteousness is resurrected just how Seth was the righteousness resurrected there's a righteousness resurrected in each one of us Isaiah 64:6 but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags we all do Fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away out of control chaos drifting but you know there's only two masters God or evil or righteousness so you're not actually just drifting you're being pulled you're being influenced and all that that brings is the end of that is is death right separation from from Christ forever hell is not Eternal but you're eternally separated from Christ and our righteousness you know we we have nothing we we we we must you know we we we must put on the robe that he has given to us if we would just stop trying to fix ourselves right and just start putting the word on what a difference that would make you know I I we talked some time ago about about Sin and how how uh sin is I can't remember exactly how it was put but basically to fight against sin is is is to fight a losing battle did you know that to fight against the Devil is a losing battle if you look at it that way where you're going to go and you're going to fight the devil right how do you fight the devil you turned to Christ you see I've been there saints of God I've been there we we we are there constantly right we say well I'm going to defeat this problem when all we need to do is go to Christ go to prayer commit it to his hands and then spend more time with him you don't even have to be thinking about your problem you don't even have to be reading about your problem but as you go to him as you spend time with him as you have communion with him because he is your husband he should be the center of your life all of a sudden it becomes easier to say no it becomes easier to turn from your habits the things that are are are coming against you because as the as the Life of Christ is is is how does how do you how do we say this a as you see more of the word you realize oh I don't need to hold on to this anymore anymore this is a lot better it can only hold one at a time he can only hold one at a time you know it's like the monkey reaches into the the Trap and he and he grabs a hold of the treat and he can't get his hand out unless he lets go of it so the very thing we we are trapping ourselves because we're refusing to let refusing to let go of something say say wellow you know this person or this problem no you need to just let go of that problem you know that the day and age we live in everybody's complaining about their parents and what their parents did to them and how they abused them and and and all of this stuff and there is valid cases of abuse I'm not discrediting that but most of this stuff you hear it's like no your parents need to just whoop you more or or or make you listen to the rules or make you do the dishes that's your problem but it's you know brother brother Ben mcaffrey he's the one who told me this and kind of Set Me Free a little bit he said he said no matter how well you do Chris your kids are going to need counseling because of you when they get older it's just a fact of life okay that makes you feel a little better but so people are complaining about that it's and you know maybe there's some there are some valid situations where things didn't go super great we've all been there but for me for each one of us if there is problems it it with your parents this is very specific we're going to we're going to ride the wave as brother Ron Peterson said but he said Chris ride the wave it is you are no you are not responsible for what they're doing now right but you are responsible if you refuse to let go you have to forgive them I mean they can still be a mess I know of situations where the this the the child you know by God's grace has let go has just love overflowing but his parent is is still a mess but that you can't be responsible for that and if you hold on to that you you are just as bad and that's where the rubber meets the road and it gets hot where the rubber meets the road it burns a little bit and if we can just let go we we by letting go you will not change them by letting go you will not spark an apology from them by letting go you will allow God to then begin to use you you will find yourself in a new position in Christ you will find yourself with freedom you know this is this is actually science if there's a offense in someone's life say they're four years old and now they're a grown man and they have issues this is science if they can go back and visit that moment in their life and make restitutions with themselves with God preferably that will be buried and they will begin to change now I believe that it's God always pychology whatever science whatever it's God always so you go you go back to that offense whatever it is and you say God I'm putting this into your hands because it's it's inhibiting me from being the father from being the mother from being for being the daughter from being the son that I could be because I won't let go and so I'm trapped and bitterness will drive the Holy Spirit right out of your life but you know what whenever you see something prevalent in the world popular in the secular world there's a there's there's a there's a type in the in the spiritually spiritually with the with the bride of Christ as a whole with individuals as a whole and the answer that they have is not necessarily the right answer and many times I think that's where people fall into the Trap you know we've talked about social media before and we can talk about pornography and all that kind of stuff but I believe a greater trap is when when when parents are feeding on social media and the idea of child raising that come from the world come from the descendants of hippies who haven't been saved by God right my aunt is and Jerry sits here descendant of hippies but by the grace of God so that's where I think people fall into a trap as they read in there's a cute little picture of a little boy with PB&J all over his face and and the caption is let him be free and live life to the the fullest no get a napkin and wipe their face off that's not how adults run around so don't let your kid run around like that we're training kids to be good adults so if you won't allow yourself to do it or your spouse to do it right okay there's age appropriate things but I think we fall into the Trap of consuming too much of the world right so then now we can take that example from there and bring that back into where we are talking about tonight where if we spend to much time not with our lover with our husband you know if the husband and wife get really busy and they drift apart and they pass like two ships in the night the devil begins to work little things come up but then there's no communion so those little things turn into big things and suddenly divorce is the only answer no no no no it started all the way back there when you decided to stop talking to each other give or take by circumstance see the devil isn't the devil isn't ready hiding behind the corner to jump out and say Boo gotcha no he shows up and he slips a no under your door or he or he he or he you know drops a a bag of goodies on the porch That's How The Devil Works he's sneaky he he he put a little bit of crumb there and he'll take the crumb and he'll drop another little crumb there and you'll take that crumb and next thing you know you're you know step into my parlor said the spider to the fly right next thing you know you're all tangled up in the web the web of Temptation second Corinthians 5:21 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him Abel was killed which was a type of death burial and resurrection of Christ Seth took his place so righteousness resurrected in this quote here marriage of the land and I'm winding down I know it hasn't been long but but you see first decision decisions made next engagement then promise and then the ceremony interesting about this quote I I uh the search engine I was using I would search different things and no matter what search this quote would pop up so it wasn't until before service I was like oh I need this quote so the Lord was like hint hint hint so that's what so pay attention and that's when the bride takes the bridegroom's name she is no more than of her own name she takes the bridegroom's name you see how important it is you take the H the name of your husband and the the reason the world says no I'll keep my name it's in direct opposition of the will of God she is is no more than of her own name she takes the bridegroom's name and then when the church has the ceremony you know you you can you can not have anything in the world but no matter what the world takes from you you always have your name yeah you can lose your face you can lose your arms your legs but you always have your name that's the one thing God asks for he says give me your name he asks you for the one thing that that no one has to surrender it can never be taken from you and he asks you will you give it to me right that's good you're sacrificing your name and you know what your name is it is your identity that's why it's so important what you name your children but it's your identity your name is your identity so you you have this name and you come to the altar you come to the Altar and and and you and there's Christ and there's the marriage certificate and he says look you've done everything you you sacrificed to be here you you you've cleaned yourself up you you followed my word now I'm going to ask for the ultimate will you surrender the very last thing you have a hold of and take my name instead that's good and it's that's the hardest part and I really believe this saints of God I really believe this whichever Church wherever you go wherever Church you go to there are people who are standing right there they got the robe on they're standing right there and God's saying just give me your name and they just can't bring themselves to do it yet so they do things that just don't make sense and we want to just cast them off into the outer Darkness but they're standing there all Jesus is Christ is saying is just hand me your name he will not take it you must pass it you must give it up and that's where I think because PE SS of God we have you got to give up every last bit I've seen individuals who have come and done so much to be at that point and then they say it just won't work and I say this because I struggled with that for years because I saw the effort they put in I saw the dedication they put in and then they turned away and now they're worse off than they ever were they say it just wouldn't work it's because they wouldn't I'm not saying they had the Holy Spirit but they wouldn't surrender that last thing and guess what I don't know what that last thing is each one of us we don't know what that last thing is because it's that deep dark thing inside of us nobody knows about and God's saying please just give it up just let go of that one last little thing because it has to be what does brother B say constantly all the word all the word but by God's grace he gives us the strength to do so she is no more than of her own name she takes the bridegroom's name and then when the church has the ceremony makes their promises then she takes the bridegroom's name then she's no longer a church of the world she's the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I don't mean that by name I mean that by birth by Nature by the power of God you see to receive his name is the completion of the New Birth by the power of God by the revealed truth of God in the heart she becomes a Christian Church the great Universal Apostolic Christian Church she becomes a part of Christ when she does that Christ injects into her his own Spirit his own life and the Bible said to Adam and Eve there you're no longer Twain but one do you see why a person in this position cannot be shaken they no longer have an identity to go back to SS of God I no longer have an identity to go back to that name doesn't exist if you want to go back to your own old name you got to go get an right it doesn't even exist it's gone there's nothing to go that's why oh God help me that's why it's so hard because you're burning the last Bridge there is no turning back there's always a way out girlfriend boyfriend there's always a way out until you take his name then that's it there's no way out they are one Christ and when the woman Church okay they are no longer two they are one Christ in you amen that's it his life has been brought into you then you become the bride or Mrs Jesus Christ you see I was praying as I was studying this because I feel too often I think it's just a I think it's just the the lot of a preacher that I don't bring it out good enough God has invited you to something we can't even put into words God has extended to us an invitation God has allowed us maybe maybe we already done it we've already signed away the name the position we hold as his wife what an honor what a privilege and we let life trickle in and we become apathetic God is God Is Standing There the creator of the heavens and the Earth and breathe Stars forgive me for getting poetic but and he's standing there and he's your one and only only we just had Valentine's Day right empty promises from people who can't keep it because they don't have God in their life but God's Eternal promises never fade away and when he says will you be mine I'll be yours that is for eternity and he's standing there and and every day we have the opportunity to to lean ourselves into his bosom as he wraps his arms around us and he reminds us this is what it's all about Lord help us to take it a little bit more serious help us to not to become legalistic but just come to a place where we realize we realize what who we are we are Mrs Jesus Christ say it in your head say it to yourself quietly I am Mr Jesus Christ whether you are there now or you have the potential to be there you have the choice all you have to do is give it up the last and that fight to the very end doesn't go away you will fight after the ceremony after the wedding and the guests have gone home and you go back to work and you're still married but now the devil begins to attack even harder because he says ha I'll break this Union but there's something special about being married to Christ yeah I don't even have to say it let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I Feel It In My Heart Lord I feel it deep in my being Lord Jesus this idea this this this relationship and and the Perfection the Perfection of this position is made more perfect by the opposition by the battle between our flesh and the righteousness of Christ and as we as we surrender to you we just fall more in love with you a as we as we give up more of our pride and our indifferences and and our attitudes and our own desires and we surrender them to you no matter how hard they be we we surrender them to you and and we look and we see oh wow God you had such a much better plan than I could have ever imagined father it brings me right back in my mind to that moment in the Garden of Gethsemane when you said but not my will but thy will be done why because you saw the joy that was set before you you you saw what would happen you would be able to stand at the altar and receive us so that you took the pain and that is the Crux of our relationship with you if we can just surrender what we think is so important to hold on to God if we can just let that go you have an abundance waiting for us [Music] God help us help us Lord Jesus help me [Music] Lord the word is being spoken and preached tonight and it's even speaking to my heart I just hold on to too many things [Music] Lord I wrap them up real carefully and I put them in a box and I keep them as my
