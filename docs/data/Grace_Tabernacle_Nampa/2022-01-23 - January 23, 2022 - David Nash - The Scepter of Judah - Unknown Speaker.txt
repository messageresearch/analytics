ready to turn the service to our pastor this thing number 973 little is much when god is in it in the harvest field now ripen there's a work for all to do park the voice of god is calling to the heart is calling you little is much when god is in it labor not for wealth or fame there's a crown and you can win it if you go in jesus name does the place you're called to labor seem so small and little known it is great if god is in it and he'll not forget his own little is much when god is in it labor not for wealth or fame there's a crown and you can win it if you go in jesus name when the conflict here is ended and our race on earth is run he will say if we be faithful welcome home my child well done little is much when god is in it labor not for wealth or fame there's a crown and you can win it if you go in jesus name when we enter heaven's portals and our savior's face we see heirs of life will be forgotten we'll be happy glad and free little is much when god is in it lame burn not for wealth or fame there's a crown and you can win if you go jesus name we say amen to that amen little as much when god is in it how often we see situations in our life and we are there and i think about this my brother and sister bring the very type of the meal and the oil to our day satan would try to create a famine starve the bride of christ where she starts to look somewhere else is there a great big mound as it were but they're sufficient for every day amen we don't just say well praise the lord we're overcomers i got more faith in anything i no sir we get up every day and we say thank you lord you have brought me through this day you have given me the strength and revelation for this day and the scripture tells us don't worry about tomorrow may never come and uh we'll talk about mistakes here in just a few minutes so we don't want to look back and say oh my what what have i done what have i done i was just reading today in fact at lunch time i sorry i can't tell you exactly what sermon i can't remember the sermon but brother branham was talking about uh david and he said you know david was such a perfect man before god there was only one thing that god held against him only one thing would we look at that and say david must have only made one mistake in his life no sir god was not happy that in david's desire for besheba they would have her husband killed that's the one thing that god held against david every other mistake he ever made in his life god never even held it never even commented to that isn't that amazing that gives me hope hallelujah amen praise the lord well let's just stand and uh i just want to um go into you know i uh i seem like it's been forever since i preached to you and did we enjoy brother jose i i just i really enjoyed it amen amen who can lift a hand tonight and say i am a work in progress thank you lord amen because if the judgment as it were come with the setting of the son we would be in trouble but the lord continually come his mercies are new every morning and i say thank you brother sergey good to see you home off the road amen um i want to speak to you this morning on we are witnesses and what will the witnesses say now my brother and sister the witnesses out here can be for you or against you i'm really not so concerned about what they will say against me what i'm concerned about is what they'll say for me because you see if the critic is the only one that's correct we're in trouble if all there is is testimony of failure and that's why i brought up david if if there was just we can go through the bible and some people get a conclusion uh my david you know god honored that and solomon and all this but what a horrible thing he did and forget all the things that god did through david use david 4 and what he expressed so if it's all about the critics we're in trouble what i'm desiring today is to know what will be said in my defense hallelujah let's turn in joshua 24. now saints um my very first witness uh that i spoke to you on part one i guess we would call it was also out of joshua 24. and as i felt led to revisit this i had something that leaped out at me and and uh i i found it kind of marvelous in a way and uh to to catch this and how it spoke to my heart and i'm not gonna try tonight to uh make all kinds of spiritual connections to say oh this must mean this and this must mean this and this must mean this but i will express to you tonight as i read this that there are many scriptures that support ideas and and things that were there and i'm just going to put them out and you ponder them and you apply how you feel to apply i just want to take a moment to express how it spoke to my heart amen joshua 24 21 and the people said unto joshua nay but we will serve the lord and joshua said unto the people ye are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the lord to serve him and they said we are witnesses are we witnesses tonight now therefore put away said he the strange gods which are among you and incline your heart unto the lord god of israel and the people said unto joshua the lord our god we will serve and his voice will we obey so joshua made a covenant with the people that day and set them a statute and an ordinance in shell and joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of god and took a great stone and set it up there under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the lord now my brother and sister we stopped right there as it is on the page right here we stopped right there we'd say that's interesting he took a a rock and he put it there under the oak next door to the sanctuary but now as we step into verse 27 look at this and joshua said unto all the people behold this stone shall be a witness unto us for it hath heard all the words of the lord which he spake unto us and it shall be therefore a witness unto you lest ye deny your god so joshua let the people depart every man unto his inheritance heavenly father we just ask for your blessings tonight lord be with the saints the prayer request lord with each and every one our children father as we look in the world today father we just see all these staggering statistics father of what is happening to our society but father there is an inheritance and joshua released the people and let them go into their inheritance father tonight i pray lord we'll catch the revelation of what our inheritance is not only in the word of god but also in the family father we ask you to bless this evening this time together in your name amen you may be seated now i don't want to have a negative vein to follow tonight but it strikes me that through the years my brother and sister how many people we have fellowshipped with we have traveled in this journey with that said we would serve the lord but yet they're not serving him today and so we realized to say this just in the framework of conversation or something to speak out to feel like we belong have you ever done that i i know there was a time in my life that there'd be times i disagreed with things but yet i i felt compelled to just kind of go along with it but you know coming maybe for me i won't speak for you but i pray that this isn't for our young people to have to wait till they're old people to uh uh become more settled in what they stand for but you know come to a time that's like no sorry i don't agree with you now if people get offended over that my brother and sister there's not much you can do for them but the truth is the truth will offend the unbeliever so many people are offended at the very gospel they say they believe you'll have people my brother and sister that go to church and they say praise the lord i believe the bible and then go right out and live absolutely contrary to it we realize that this is more of an intellectual type understanding of the word of god that they grasp the concept well you know i listen to brother chris talk about writing code and i listen to brother alex talking about programming all these things and and uh brother isaac talking about what he does and and you know and i i intellectually grasp that i just hope your life never depends on me applying it because you see i can grasp what these things are but i could not come to the first base of applying it and i think sometimes this is what happens in the churches people grasp the concept but we're going to get from concept to the actual application because an app my brother and sister i say this kind of humorous because i tried to use an app the other day it was like for this and this apply this uh use this app and and uh so i click on the thing and it does its whole thing and says um this app is under construction so i've thinking about what brother jose said i'm under construction i won't be upset with them but don't tell me to use something that's not usable and i want this gospel of jesus christ as we are here as brothers and sisters together in fellowship and we are hearing the word preached and we are preaching the word that we would have something that is applicable that we can take and put to work tonight we don't have to wait for something else to happen to complete this but the word would be usable as it were tonight amen so we look here in and it just strikes me a verse 26 uh well let's go back to 25 joshua made a covenant with the people that day now my brother and sister for a covenant to be made in its right context those who disagreed should have raised their voice and said i disagree with this so when they stood there and allowed the covenant to be applied they themselves by by willingly or unwillingly place themselves now under this covenant that joshua has made with the people and this covenant my brother and sister was god speaking this is not joshua we don't have a thus saith joshua as it were but this covenant was them agreeing with the word of god that we will serve god amen because you can agree with your church and then when your church flies to the south if you want to understand what that is just go check out what's happening in the southern baptist conference they are falling apart blowing apart at the seams because they've now come to a place in life that collectively they don't all agree with each other and so it's tearing apart what was built all these years and there's people standing up great men in their churches saying well really the baptist conference was nothing more than a collective missionary effort or a collective educational effort is that what church is missionary and education you see something got skewered along the way and now they're not agreeing and they have some rightful reasons to not agree but you know it's there that that it's being fractured but when this covenant my brother and sister i hope you catch my point when this covenant is not between you and grace tabernacle not between you and the message of brother branham but this covenant is between you and jesus christ there's nothing there to break there's nothing to disagree with there's nothing to say it's changed direction but we can hold to that word and know that that word is faithful and true now joshua wrote these words in the book of the law so this was not just something that somebody come along and said i don't remember it being that way have you ever seen that a disagreement maybe now don't feel sorry for me because i don't mean it this way but i'm trying to break my habit of using you for the example but i remember one time a man a man that i felt very close to a good portion of my life and he come to me and he said i'm angry at you and i said okay i'm sorry what why and he says well in church on sunday you said this this this and this i i just like if i said that i was actually denying everything i believe i had to be kind of strong i guess i said i know what i said i don't know what you heard because i am not if i'm going to deny you know saints i've said this before if we're not going to serve god we're not going to stand with the message with our whole heart mind body and soul let's all buy a boat and go boating let's go buy a snowmobile and go snowmobiling let's go let's go do this or let's go do that because that's all it will net us is the equivalent and so you see it comes to a place in a time that sometimes the words need to be recorded sometimes it's got to be anchored in stone that when they come and and we have you know uh those that would would speak against the things of god uh to be able to point back and say does not the word say if you study your bible you'll see jesus said that he didn't come and say now this is what i think and this is what i he said is it not written so god anchored that down so that anyone could go and reference back to what god said and therefore let it be written and so it's there that joshua takes this great stone and he picks this up my brother and sister now when they say great stone we don't know exactly in my mind it would have to be a stone obviously uh that joshua was capable of picking up but maybe a a more distinct or identifiable stone than just any old stone scattered around and he takes this particular stone and i personally just looking at the word of god like this believe that stone was ordained to be the stone that joshua chose and he takes his stone and he carries it over and he puts it next to this ochre under this oak that's right there by the tabernacle and he tells them now that this stone shall be a witness unto us now my brother and sister whoever thought that a stone would be able to speak or be a witness to us but we look at this for it hath heard this is what was so profound to me that joshua which we know is the type of jesus christ is there telling you this stone has heard the word of the lord or words of the lord which he spake unto us and it shall therefore a witness be a witness to unto us amen lest you deny your god so joshua identifies now i have to tell you my brother and sister i think back through the scripture the stone cornerstone that they rejected there's a stone amen there was a stone that gideon was hiding with and that fire come down to in his time and all through scripture we find remember brother david nash preached here oh i don't know a year or two ago about the stones in the stream of history there and how that those stones was there and and placed there and were an identification a mark a statue a memorial amen and so we see these references of stone and we know that our lord jesus christ is that very stone that very rock that we are anchored to it wasn't peter it's not that we go back but it was a revelation of who jesus christ and so we look at all these and that's why i say i put this out for you to think on not to create a doctrine not to cry to bring something to stir things up but to remember my brother and sister joshua was bringing them not a old dead volcanic or whatever he was bringing them a living stone one that could testify hallelujah now imagine now imagine you guys might jump as much as sister jerry did tonight when brother alex jumped out of the closet and scared the fire out of her amen but it was it was a beautiful sight to see but uh imagine you're next to a stoner starts to speak to you there's gideon he's cowering he's hiding he's using that stone saints as a camouflage against the enemy coming to steal revelation from him and how shocked he must have been when voices started to come started to deal with him now this stone is now a witness now we could go back into more the reality that most of us as minds would grasp it would be that we're walking in the path of life because we're going to the tabernacle we're going and we would look over and we would see that and say i made a covenant a reminder a visual reminder we'd say well that was our voice coming my brother and sister yes god used that rock to speak to many a believer that was getting bogged down in the cares of life and the struggles and maybe the naysayer and they started saying well really i mean it seems like you know this one here kind of quit serving the lord and just turned himself into a seven a day a week working machine and his family's got a new house a new car a new boat they're going on a cruise maybe that's really where it's at in life i'll pay my tithe and he's walking he's down to the tabernacle and he looks over and he sees that stone and he remembers wait i didn't make a covenant with as it were tabernacle a building i didn't make a covenant with joshua i made a covenant with jehovah something stir in his heart and he said and i am not going to break that covenant and so it was their memorial a witness speaking to him but i tell you my brother and sister that there is a living word in the day that we live in right now and god is here as a covenant with you and i and he has set as it were memorials before us that when we come face to face with these things they remind us of who we are we can stand and some people don't understand but the truth behind it you can look out and see the man that you can recognize the symptoms of his physical body that he's addicted to something like meth and we could come and recognize except for the grace of god there go i and you say but you're looking at that guy no we're not we're just recognizing if it wasn't for the lord we would be in the alley we would be the drunk on this stool we would be the away and god sets those as memorials reminders to you and i we made a covenant to serve the lord hallelujah now he says you know this stone is going to be a witness unto it for it hath heard now how could this stone have heard but you have to understand joshua i think by revelation was looking all down through the scripture behind and forward recognizing the significance of this stone and what it would mean that it was not a dead stone the cornerstone my brother and sister that they rejected was not a dead stone it was a living stone and the tabernacle as it were without that stone became a dead building full of creeds and traditions and all of these things and our lives without that cornerstone become dead to creed and tradition and personal desire lust of the flesh pride of life and we look at that and see and he says you know what so it's going to be a witness to us then remind us don't deny you're gone and now joshua comes right there and then he says you know what hey go back to your inheritance now my brother and sister do we have a hundred percent compliance as it were if you could follow that phrase i believe there was some of those walked away from there and went right back to their life that's what joshua thought i really didn't like the way joshua tried to put he tried to put the the whole thing on us but i'm a jew i'm a message believer i don't agree with joshua i believe god sent a prophet but you see that wasn't the point they had a covenant in the wrong place they were looking to the wrong thing to them the stone was never alive the stone could never have really truly heard the stone could never truly have spoken therefore it's not a witness to me it's a witness to joshua and all of you and they went on in their life now my brother and sister it didn't take away their heritage i hope you catch this did not take away their heritage and it might not even have removed them from worshiping in the tabernacle now i don't mean that too to refer to any modern day i'm talking about this here in the scripture so you see this this stone that was there now does the scripture not tell us that nature itself will be a witness either for or against us amen and so this stone being set in their way right god puts a word but brother branham says that you have to walk all over the word of god to get to hell you're going to have to crawl over it to get to hell so here is a stone that is set in their way that in their daily life they keep coming in contact and they remember the words this is a memorial this is a witness this has heard the word i heard and this rock can speak and so it remind them now another thing that touches me and this is just something that struck me as i was looking at this thought the scripture says that in that day my brother and sister when man has rejected the word of god when man has moved away from that and is no longer doesn't even believe there is a god and it is comings down into this absolute day of dismal darkness and mankind reaching the end the scripture says the rocks in the mountains will cry out what cry will this stone have you made a covenant to serve me you made the declaration that you would follow me you see i believe we have a type right here in scripture the rocks in the mountains my brother and sister are not going to be a random oh i hope you follow me i hope you don't think i fell off the cliff tonight but it's not going to just be a random rock as it were that's in the mountain crying out but these are the rocks that have heard the majesty and heard the voice and seen the power of almighty god and those will be the rocks that are crying out not some dead inert volcanic uh uh you know uh oh what is the word spewed out of the ground and solidified and it's just some but this will be the same rocks i believe with all my heart saints the same rocks that will cry in the mountain will be the rocks that have heard sorry to pick on you sister sarah i'm trying to break the habit but maybe while you guys have stood on top of a rock somewhere in the mountain saying how great thou art those rocks have heard the praise of god those times those seasons those places have heard it and they have become tests of testimonies they have come with a with a testimony of of the power of almighty god and and that he's true and it's real and they know where they come from now in proverbs the 12th chapter 15th verse the way of a fool is right in his own eyes that he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise and so we see as a time taking back to joshua here those that kept looking to that rock and reminding themselves by looking at the rock you might call it a visual cue and they're saying i made a covenant did they all live perfect come on saints you know you're completely interchangeable with them you realize that it was just that god chose to place you in this day see god had could have come easily chose you to be in that day and them to be here don't ask them because they'll trade you right that's what the word of god chose us this is the greatest day greatest revelation the greatest display of power of almighty god of the ages and it's here now and they longed to see this day is what the word says so don't go making no deal i'll trade you places thinking it'll be simpler god called you to this right here and and he made you able to see that the rock of the covenant is still in place today in our presence this rock that we call the word of god is still living and it's still speaking it's still testifying it's still the evidence that a covenant is in place and people will mock that and say oh you guys place so much on revelation you play so much revelation this and revelation that i've had it spoke in my face my brother and sister wave your hands in your face revelation well that's fine but i got a revelation that the rock of my covenant has never faltered and will never fail and it will keep me lined up with the word because it is my continual reminder of who i am and why god placed me in this age he didn't place me in this age for an easy way out amen we heard brother chris preach easy has a cost we don't want easy we want right we want revelation we want the life of the word not to be able to pack the book and quote the quote my brother and sister i want the life contained in that book hallelujah you look at that we want to hearken into counsel that's why i chose that scripture to place that in there that we want to be those kind of people that will hearken unto counsel and let me just put it in this type i know you'll follow me if that rock is telling me you've been getting a little cold if that rock was just telling me you're letting things in your home that shouldn't be there i don't want to say ah it's just a rock i want to say that rock was there as a witness as a testimony to me of my covenant with jesus christ amen do you follow me hallelujah now proverbs 21 2. is this scripture correct yeah i say this part of the foundation my own daddy taught me as a young man and he says son everybody says there's two sides to every story but he said realize there's three sides your side their side and the absolute truth you know you've seen it people would be maybe telling the truth i was jealous i was envious i got angry hold that brother he's just talking down on himself he was probably telling the truth but see we're so conditioned to present our best side and to look good and you know human nature i don't know maybe by the time we're in our mid teens we start to get this idea and any of you young people that are kind of in that age are coming that age that want to say man you're certainly welcome but we get this idea i am right and mom and dad oh no let's not be prejudiced there we'll start with dad dad's wrong i'm right mom's wrong i'm right sister's wrong i'm right brother's wrong i'm right brother paul is wrong i'm right now what happens when that goes unchecked unbridled growth of an ego of an opinion of a spirit of rebellion unbridled they grow into a young person that everything they do even if it's completely against the word of god is justified i'm sorry none of you young people thought about saying amen i saw it just come so close on your lips every way of a man is right in his own eyes but the lord bypassed your eyes and went down and started looking at that heart and said oh there's another kind of stone here that we have to deal with and not all of it is the cornerstone and this stone and that stone some of it's just an old stony heart but isn't beautiful how the lord loves us so much he comes and he tenderizes that heart softens it up soaks it in the word answers prayers speaks to us in the midnight hour until we know lord you're right and i was wrong and i want to walk in the way of the word i don't want to walk in my own opinion amen but you see we've become a witness in and of ourselves my brother and sister you'll see that some you know i'm sorry just thinking about my daddy today and uh we're going through a lot of stuff with the estate and got to go to court and all these kind of things and and i remember my daddy one time making a statement to me there'd been a certain minister come and visited our church and it just so happened that minister over and over and over again told you i told the church just over and over and over again i'm just a humble servant of god you crossed him he cut you up with a buzz saw but he said that over and over again i'm just a humble and my daddy said son i want you to understand something people that have to tell you they're humble usually aren't oh lord i was like growing up i'm like that's out of my vocabulary but it's the truth is it not because humility is something that comes on display when we don't even think about oh i'll be humble right now i could just slap their head off but i'll be humble we can laugh about it can't we but you see those spirits work in that fashion and you know what happens oh what is that um the law of attraction that kind of spirit attracts more people and tell the whole group of them i mean we're right aren't we brother trevor oh absolutely you and i i mean we are right and anybody who don't agree with us has got a problem yeah that's just that plain and simple and what do they do they and i i know that it's open you know then brother david comes along and yep then brother sean and you know but sergey and it just goes until pretty soon we got a group of these people going around the church or whatever our doctrine is right i know there's 10 scriptures that prove it wrong but we are right and it grows from there and you know god's only got one option at that stage saints if there's a real son or daughter of god involved with that god has to come the one option he has to come and crush it and then everybody's like what happened we had such a lovely church and things were so good and then it got ripped apart at this no it didn't get ripped apart they blamed the devil i've told you before sometimes the devil's setting out on the step crying because he's getting blamed for something that he didn't even do because we set the stage and god says you know what i've got a son i've got a daughter or maybe more than one in there and i've got to crush this so that spirit doesn't take over the whole church and destroy their souls and so our our lives become a witness of who we are and and uh my brother and sister let me just skip over some stuff so i'm not too late tonight i'll tell you tonight i'm a witness you're a witness tonight we're witnesses of the open book amen we're witnesses that the word of god has come in our hour and been revealed and it's a living word it's a powerful word it's not a word that's just laying down and being just trampled my brother and sister this is a power this is a word that satan respects he respects nothing else on earth but he respects this word because he know he's loosed or bound by the word that's what we are that's the kind of witness we're called to be what is it because we've got the rock amen we've got rock of revelation in you and i and when we meet peter someday my brother and sister he's not going to say well praise the lord i was able to share that revelation with you guys he's going to come and say isn't that so beautiful that revelation of the word that revelation of jesus christ the power of the word unfolding oh you experienced it laodicea you saw it when the book was open oh praise god isn't this so marvelous and we'll be there amen brother peter the power of revelation it is so incredible it delivered us out of the very jaws of satan he's not going to come and lord it over you and neither will we lord it over them but we will all rejoice of the revelation of the opening of the book and not only that the book was opened but that we by god's grace were able to take it and eat it do you know the book is not consumed my brother and sister not completely consumed it's already hit your belly this scripture says it was bitter in our belly now you tell me tonight why is it that you keep eating come on give me an answer to somebody why did we keep eating when it was in our belly bitter and we struggled oh lord why oh why give me another bite oh it hurts so bad my life is being oh give me another bite why my brother and sister because the power of the open book is greater than the power of laodicea and there's something in you that desired that hallelujah now there's scriptural references of the eyes of the lord and i give it to you as a homework assignment tonight because i i'm already slower than i thought i would be but the eyes of the lord go through the scripture you see many references of the eyes of the lord and now when the lord is looking on us my brother and sister this scripture tells us also and this is just a side note i chose not to include but the scripture tells us that god's been patient with the unbeliever and if he be patient with the unbeliever how much more he'd be patient with you and i oh think of the grace of god poured on out on us that this this patience this grace is being just poured out on us and i'm telling you my brother and sister that in that day we will be spoken of like david amen perfect hard to fathom isn't it i'm going to read you a quote in a minute that makes it really hard to fathom we sometimes would wonder why lord why me usually you know what you guys would probably be kind of like me but different because you're you and i'm me and i'm human and i think you're all human my god looks at us so much different we look at ourselves and the day that we look at ourself the lowest is usually right after we have failed you see satan has more motive my brother and sister than just causing you to fail as in you'll be lost do you realize if satan stood right here he could explain predestination to you to a degree that we in the human element could not even explain it you follow me he knows the word but if he can get you to not take the word if he can get you to pull back from the word he doesn't have to rebuke the word or deny the word he's just got to get you to not take the word and he's there and he gets anointing on you i'm not worthy and we pull back a little bit you know brother branham summed it up very very good i'm sure the theologians are not too impressed with this i'm sure the theologians would look at that and say well that's that's just hillbilly stuff right there but i'm telling you the prophet of god summed this equation up so perfectly when he said boo devil and the devil backs up and you step forward boo devil what is it he wasn't talking about casper type stuff come on saints after all casper was a friendly ghost he's not talking casper stuff saints he's talking about the very principle that when you will open your mouth and rebuke the devil the devil will back up because he respects the word he knows the authority of the word and and so it's there that satan tries to get us to willingly back up willingly pull back amen now possessing the gate of the enemy after trial you know what this means you got to possess the gate of your enemy in what might possibly be one of your weaker moments doesn't say uh possessing the gate of the enemy after great conquering warfare it's after trial you still have to possess him then saints can someone please say amen amen you have to possess the gate of the enemy no matter what the day and life has handed you okay there was a great evangelist about 75 years ago i just can't think of his name i think it was arthur mccoy he had crossed the land and one night he had a dream now remember saints this is just a dream now let me let me stop here if you go and look this up you'll find brother branham uses this with different references in different kind of slightly different contexts and and you'll find it but we're not trying to make this as it is some kind of a hard and fast thing but the principle of it to to lay down as it were a memorial for us to understand what the prophet of god was speaking and how it applied to us and he had crossed the land and one night he had a dream that he had went on to glory and he said he went up to the gate and said they wouldn't let him in and said he said i'm author arthur mccoy from the united states i'm an evangelist so the gatekeeper went in now this was a dream went in and said i i can't find your name at all you imagine what that would feel like imagine saints after living your whole life you're standing there at the symbolic gate of heaven and there's like i will look we'll look you up under reverend nothing there uh we'll look you up under brother nothing there arthur art any nicknames sorry we can't find you you know how crushed you would be i can't find your name at all he said well i was an evangelist he said sir i well there's a chance there's something wrong no sir i have the book here i can't find your name at all he said well well can i do anything about it he said you might appeal your case to the white throne judgment god help i believe this is brother branham sediment right here go and help i don't want to be there see we have this opportunity to settle all of this we don't have to have a white throne judgment in our future concerning ourselves god might ask you to sit there as a judge at the white throne that you might as it were judge those who did wrong to you as it were or did that now this begs to bring out this thing that has become almost like a doctrine i've had men say well i was working on remodeling these people's house and the man's wife come out and handed me a glass of water we're going to see her there i can't contest that i don't know but if you're a ranked center it's going to take more than a glass of water to get you into heaven there's got to be something in the heart and this thing oh my tone it all down here it's starting to take root well they held the door for me when my arms were full they did this they did that my brother and sister they've got it to where any old scoundrel that was polite is going to be in glory now i don't want to make light of this i don't make fun of this but my brother and sister there comes a point that it all has to line up in the word of god otherwise we could just almost set the stage you know oh could you give me a glass of water oh they gave me a glass of water they'll be there come on saints i know these are not comfortable topics sometimes to deal with but look how the devil is twisting this and the reason he's twisting this is because the standard then can be lowered as long as there's some good deed to the bride associated don't let the devil fool you with that well i can can i do anything about it you might appeal your case so i thrown judgment god help i don't want to be there he said well well if that's my only hope i guess i'll just appeal my case then and he said he thought he went uh went away away and just and as he began he said it was darkness and got lighter and lighter said it seemed like there was no certain place this light stopped but he was right in the center of it and said it said who who approaches my throne of judgment and he said i'm arthur mccoy i'm an evangelist sent many souls to the kingdom scary for the preacher isn't it because that might very well have been a credible legitimate statement i've sent many souls to the king but can't find his own name in the book of life oh god help us god help us was your name not found upon the book he said no then you've appealed to my court yes sir you shall receive justice i shall judge you by my laws arthur mccoy did you ever tell a lie he said i thought it was pretty good man till i stood in that light oh god i pray that light comes through our church comes through our lives that we don't just fool ourselves thinking everything is good lord let that light which is our lord jesus christ come through i thought i was a pretty good man until i stood in that light he said but in the presence of that light i was a sinner we'll all be that you might feel secure now but wait till you come there oh man how do you think it feels here when he's anointing how little you can feel what will it be at the white throne judgment said did you ever tell a lie he said i thought i had been truthful but some little things that i thought was little white lies then become big and dark there yes sir i've told the lie did you ever steal he said i thought i had been honest about it never stole but he said in the presence of that light i realized there was some deals i'd pulled that wasn't just right yes sir i've stole he said my judgment and he was just about ready to hear his sentence depart into everlasting fire which prepared for the devil and his angels and said every bone was coming apart and i heard the sweetest voice i ever heard in my life and when i turned to look i saw the sweetest face i ever saw sweeter than a mother's face sweeter voice than my mother ever called me so i looked around and i heard a voice and father that is true he did tell lies and he wasn't just honest but down on earth he stood for me now i stand in his place and you will find various uh context of this through the message where brother brown is speaking along this line i'm telling you my brother and sister we many times judge our position in jesus christ about good days and bad days and all of these other worldly influences right here but i want to say tonight and i don't want this to sound judgmental but in the presence of that light every one of us will realize we are a sinner oh but we have the opportunity praise the lord to have one that will come and stand in our defense hallelujah will be that witness coming and standing in our defense in that day we will hear we're not here to lower the standard because he'll speak for us we're here to live every word to the best of our ability but we have to come to the place that we recognize we rely on his grace amen that our very best that we know how to do and physically and mentally and spiritually can accomplish is nothing in the presence of that light but i tell you my brother and sister we can stand today as a witness of our lord jesus christ how do you do that brother paul i want to do that live your life according to the word amen we can do it we don't have to be some super you know almost like televangelist be the one on the corner expounding everything in such a perfect context but what we got to do is stand as it were on the corner and people say something's different about this person something is happened to them i knew them years ago and they are not the same person i have been around them and something is changing what is going on with them it is jesus christ i've got saved you've become a fanatical that might be your description but to me it's called redeemed might be fanatical to you but to me it's redeemed amen and that life-changing word that comes my brother and sister is the very thing now we believe according to what the prophet preached to us you get everything under the blood here we won't be standing in a white throne judgment to be judged right scripture says some men sins go before them and some men's sins follow make sure your sins go before you amen the prophet of god i should have included this we would have had a moment here prophet of god declaring to us that what we got to do is make sure because how does that go lord help me grasp it prophet of god talking about how the devil can't get to you you just stay underneath the blood and if you are underneath the blood and the devil comes into you he would then be your brother because he can't get in there as the devil sorry i kind of butchered that quote my mind is racing all the things i left out tonight i wish i could retrieve them off my desk and preach them to you right now but hallelujah the clock ticks on but look at this my brother and sister it is there i want to make this emphasis brother brown i'm speaking this little story as you would it's true it's true he told lies it's true maybe he stole something do you know that many corporations saints have went to these tests personality tests and um good very very good uh candidates what we would consider good honest workers and they're going through this personality test and they come to this part have you ever stole from your company and good honest personality they checked no do you realize your resume just landed in the trash because in their mind if you went in the bathroom and stopped and chatted with charlie you just stole company time if you ever accidentally walked out of the office with a company ink pen in your pocket you're a thief now until the secret of that the revelation of that come out many good people flunked because they were like oh i'm not a thief are you catching my correlation i'm trying to see we don't realize it's it's not like well you know i'll just lie it's no do you know that technically this will really hurt some of us do you know technically exaggeration is a lie god forgive me god forgive me my own wife and i don't say this in humor my own wife is like honey you said it was 50 it was 20. okay i'm sorry so maybe this would be the night i need to stand up and say you know there's been times saints i probably lied to you i remember the story this way you brothers know what i'm talking about the wife is like no no you've got this story here from over here you put it over here and then you added this to that story kind of like i would add cooking oil and then you and they unravel it all for you and i'm not speaking ill of my wife i'm just talking about humanity and you unravel it all and you remember oh yeah i had the first half of this event in 2010 attached to the last half of this event that happened in 2016 and ended up with an event in 2021 or 2 that never really happened now i know it's not you people but it's people like you that have done that maybe men are more prone i don't know some of your sisters look very smug but i'm trying to make that point to realize how easily saints that line is right there that unintentionally we waver over these things and we by exaggeration or whatever else it might be paint a picture that's not perfectly true and we would go on in someone to say are you an honest man paul and i would say i'm an honest man but if i stood saints in that light this light oh lord let this light be strong enough let this light be powerful enough lord to come down in our midst for us to be able to stop and say lord there as it were is a little something on the hem of my garment and lord i don't want nothing on the hem of my garment i don't want that spot i don't want the lint i don't want this i say this in humor there's been a time or two through the years my wife i said oh my i was almost embarrassed for you in church today and i'm like oh why well you had a feather this is true you had a feather from like a feather comforter or something you know and it was stuck to my collar right here and it's sticking out and you know she's looking at it thinking everybody's gonna think i'm a terrible wife but to her defense she drove to church so the caller was out the passenger window oh that's not manly let me take that back but i just want you to see saints how easy it is for us for satan just to kind of open the door and just let it lay out that we would come a little anointing here a little hubris here and suddenly we stepped over the line we don't think about it we walk on in life we go on lord let the light saints that's why i'm preaching this tonight i just want to encourage you find a time and a place and ask the lord to magnify the light in our lives magnify it in such a fashion lord that people would say man those people of grace tabernacle are going nuts over there they're all standing in the mirror of the word over and over and over again and and they're looking and they're looking and they're looking at the hymn of their garment and they're they're doing all this and and why why are they so because you see we don't want to be this man we want to be that that comes to the presence of god stands there in the throne of almighty god to worship him and we have every opportunity god is not playing this as some kind of lottery or roulette type of a thing where you may or may not but by the word we conceal oh pardon me for using this term but we can seal the deal amen it can be done because we can stand and turn on the light because god has given us my brother and sister that opportunity to stand and walk in the light amen hallelujah i got other scripture but i think i even wrote down on the note i gave brother alex that i think we'll just save that for another service amen sister ruth would you come brother sean hallelujah saints i hope we've made sense tonight amen i want you to be able to see how slippery satan is and how us being humans can let certain things in our life just glide and it wasn't until he stood in that light that he realized i'm evangelist i sent many souls to the kingdom but i'm a liar and a thief oh lord let me stand in the light let me stand in the light of your word brother paul lafontaine i don't remember what the title of that is sister jerry um just said here watch this for uh uh uh of three three four minutes is all it was that i watched right there but he's kind of made a little thing i just thought it was good you might remember the name of that sermon it was this last sunday sermon and he's talking about how it is that you go through security in an airport and they check you the machine the wand whatever it is and you're going through there and he was acting you know i think that was his sons that he had up there and he's one of them's a policeman and and the other one you know and he comes up there and it's like baby baby steps back and he pulled a little something out of his pocket brother paul wanting to make this a point to them he says oh this right here was a little bit of doubt you see it can't make it into the kingdom and he backed up and he went through again baby baby this was a little bit of fear and there's a little here and several of those things and he says you know we could go on and on and on with this my brother and sister let's get in the light let it shine on us so bright that it won't come that doubt keep us from the kingdom fear keep us from the kingdom loss of the flesh pride of life all of these and keep us from the kingdom let us walk through the detector of the word let's not say hey look let's turn the detector down because the beeping bothers me i'm offended by the beeping let's keep it turned up and let's step into that light of the word let it shine on us and let it just examine us from head to toe that nothing nothing would come that day because you see my brother and sister the same light that was in that dream shining on him right there is the same light that's shining on you and i right now it's a matter of whether we will stand and let it examine us or not oh i pray that we just stop we just stop and examine our life and just say lord lord i pray because i want my sins to go before me i don't want them to follow me hallelujah i want them to go under the blood amen i want them to stay there hallelujah let's just stand and worship the lord for just just a a few short minutes and just on my heart tonight this song my hope is in the lord amen it's certainly nowhere else saints i'll tell you what the world's just trying to trying to get us did you guys see that now they're they're saying that maybe possibly you'll need a fifth coveted shot [Music] wow one was gonna save us and a paper mask [Music] now it's two and two mass you see the insanity where they headed but we as sons and daughters of god my hope my protections in the blood of jesus christ amen not the fear of this world amen yeah there might be reason we certainly don't look now and absolutely don't look down on anybody that got to covet shot that's not the point the point is pointing to the spirit out here that would control people's lives where the holy ghost should be doing the controlling should be the control tower fear fear i was talking to a farmer friend of mine today an individual in a pickup going 65 miles an hour tail ended his wife she was parked waiting to turn across traffic hit her and drove her over in the other lane in a car going 55 miles an hour head on [Music] and they want to say it's her fault that's the kind of fear the world has he says now she won't even hardly get in the car and drive she gets in the car by herself and anxiety rises up and she spends all her time looking at the mirrors and they live right off of highway 95 out of parma right there their driveway the road going to their houses right there no way to get around it and i thought it was interesting thinking about these thoughts he said my wife is so controlled by fear now she won't even drive to the grocery store because of fear her anxiety rises up my brother and sister look around us look around us what's happening in the church in the church nominal out here they're either so caught up in the spirit of rock and roll and and these worldly things or they've got everybody going to hell [Music] where's our hope it's in

quote's been read so many times looking at the unseen when a man once catches that vision of the invisible god and know that he's always present there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes his actions and in the time of distress and trouble it'll make him look upward above the things that's happening around him because he's looking at the unseen yet by promise oh my brother and sister i love that quote right there because once we catch the vision of the invisible god who's present with us we're stabilized it's not i'm almost stabilized or i hope to be stabilized but we will be stabilized oh hallelujah is that something to get excited about amen amen amen okay just one more amen can i just have a few more minutes [Music] come on yeah [Music] what a lovely name
