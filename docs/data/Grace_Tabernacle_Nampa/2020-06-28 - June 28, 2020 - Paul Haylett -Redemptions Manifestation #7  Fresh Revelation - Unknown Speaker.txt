you're here already we'll save that for after give him on yellow [Music] couple I see All Saints greeting some Oregon from our congregation to you praise the Lord the song that I guess brother Jason put me on the spot he says really have a special tomorrow and I gotta know I'm on vacation actually it's too much pressure he says what do you think I go through when I go to Oregon so I said I can't let him come to Oregon and say that he's under pressure he cannot sing so I chose the song follow me and there's two lines out of the songs that spoke to me sometime back and it's if just a cup of water I've placed it in your hand then it's all adjust a cup of water it's all that I demand I want you to encourage every one of you to just give your best and what Jesus gives you is what you can give and it's not anymore you don't have to give more it's just that and I just want to ask you to keep that in mind that the Lord may bless you I've traveled down a lonely road and no one seems to care the burden of my way reback had bowed me to despair by off the plate to Jesus our folks were treating me and when I heard him say so Ted [Music] [Applause] my neighbor also weary upon that Capri broke that cross became so heavy I fell beneath alone be faithful weary Bella where the morning I can see dust if your cross and follow close to me I worked so hard for Jesus I often instance a I've sacrificed a lot of things to walk the narrow way my kpop fame and fortune I'm worth the lot to me and made I heard him say so tenderly I left a throne of glory and counted it back loss my hands were nailing anger upon that cruel cross but now we'll make the journey with your hands safe in mine so lift your cross and follow me [Applause] [Music] Jesus if I die upon a foreign field Sunday would be no more than love of the man no less could I repay no greater love has poured a man that for a friend to die these are the words he gently said if just a cup of water I placed within your hand then just a cup of water is all that I demand but if my fatally being by glory I can see I'll take my cross and follow close to being will be the last part if just a cup of water I placed within your head then just a cup of water is all all that I need mint but if by death to living they can like glory see I'll take my cross and follow close to be and that's so true it's just a cup of water as simple as that a man well thank you brother Karl I appreciate you singing a man let's see let's do sing that fill my cup Lord I lift it up and then we have the gospel kids and our kids gonna sing a song well my I love oh my this thirsting of my soul bread of heaven [Music] here's my car fill it up [Music] I mean I dress that's your prayer this morning man as we get the kids to come it's funny they all

he's not in his head and I'm not in my head this is good amen look I was gonna make a point with brother Alex would not come up here oh my can you believe this but look I can still make the very point I was gonna make look what God's doing he's placing very very solid young men in our midst hallelujah so I look around I see each one of a brother Manasseh I should have you come up here amen but he's got the same look brother Alex but look at this got what God's doing is we're no longer a Church of old people come on can somebody say thank you lord look it hasn't been too many years ago just right over there and up by the post office you look out and it was just old people hallelujah well not always sister Gabrielle is not an old person but anyway I just was wanting to make a point today how thankful we are what God's doing he's putting young men on our mitts young men that will worship the Lord young men that are faithful amen and that applies to you sisters - amen god bless you brother amen brother Alex next time buddy Amen let's give a welcome to Alex he's and then you know and I first met brother Alex I don't know roughly about three years ago I just felt a real pinch kindred spirit there it is with him and brother Alex's just made a decision sometime back we haven't really spoke to vocal about it but he just prayed about it and just felt like that he wanted to be out west here with us in this area I think it helps that he's got a lovely sister some family connection there but anyway we're just thankful to have your brother Alex the Lord giving you traveling mercies and have you here today amen brother Carl sister Chrissy amen good to have you guys here even though you're just passing by but to include us and we're happy to have you here today pray God gives you a lovely vacation amen I want to speak to you this morning once again on redemptions manifestation Thank You musicians we just realized these little things that are coming forth now the prophet of God shows us that the Seventh Seal was a plan of redemption right that was the manifestation of redemption it was not just hey I'm gonna do something but he said I'm gonna bring in evidence that this is happening I'm gonna bring forth an evidence that Redemption has come to my people and that my people have been truly set free and so we look at this I want to speak to you this morning fresh revelation and that would be kind of a something that can be taken several different ways it just would be up to the person who is hearing it in what way they want to take it I would like for you to turn to first Corinthians a second chapter and we'll start with the first verse today just want to dig in it's lovely did you enjoy the specials now my brother and sister I think now I won't go into it and take the time to explain everything but see I think every one of those special was anointed because just things I'm seeing things I'm looking into things that dealing with you might say in my own life and and with phone calls etc that you just realized God is mindful and sometimes he comes down and he just speaks a little word to you to remind you I know who you are and I know what your situation is and I hear your cry and I am answering your prayer and truly the hearts desire of every son and daughter of God is we talk about it in this fashion we say well I want to make a rapture but really the underlying effect of making the rapture my brother and sister is not just to make a rapture that's like going to an event you might say but truly it is our hearts desire being drawn into the presence of Almighty God God set forth the avenue we'll travel that Avenue and walk faithfully in that and to his presence and I'm thankful that through the singing of song through praise and worship it encourages the soul to to give us a clear vision of what it is you know sometimes brother Brown talks about that the old eagle I can get a little clouded over but what we want is for the word to come amen now look when you think about that thought when that eagle I got clouded over there was something anointed the eagle and when that when that old beat got to the overgrown he had a choice he had a choice to make and that would be that he could go to that place in the mountains and he could sit there until he died and there was evidence amongst the bones and feathers that there were other eagles who did not overcome that trial of their life but the real believer amen was anointed and other believers stood with them they didn't say oh look at that their eyes filmed over their beak is overgrown no for know what did they do they took and they carried the very meat of the word and reminded them your sons your daughters and they laid it down in front of them Oh can't you see I'm going through a trial leave me alone no I'm sorry not gonna happen we're Eagles for Eagles we're going to carry the word to you and we're going to lay it right down in front of you and then you have to decide whether you're going to pick it up or not and if you pick it up it gives strength in that body and now this might sound a little coarse to some people but my brother and sister if you love the taste of blood now if you understand what I'm saying is if you cannot live without the bloody word of god if you love the taste of blood when that Eagle took a bite of that morsel laid in front of them it reminded them of a better day gone by and a promise for a brighter future and then the eagle finds a rock Oh aren't you glad we got a rock Eagle finds a rock and starts beating his head upon the rock and then that all overgrown trial of life weary in well-doing those struggles of yesterday start chipping away and pretty soon it breaks loose and that eagle has a revival and recognizes that now I hope you can take this now there is almost an unlimited amount of time I can live they can't really document the age on eagles but they have eagles they believe lived a hundred and fifty years there was an eagle that was a broken swing many years ago they believed was alive this has been back quite a few years I was a young man but scientists believe that Eagle may well been alive at the signing of the Declaration of Independence but I got a promise as an eagle I don't have a time line I'm eternal I'm eternal hallelujah but I won't make it there if I don't beat my beak on the rock and get back to eating the fresh Word of God again amen it's all about the fresh word my brother and sister the eagle is not a buzzard even though some were in science someone you know called him a eagle Buzzard there's some king of the buzzards it's an eagle Buzzard down South America I thought no that's oxime or eagle is not a buzzard and a buzzard is not an eagle hallelujah first Corinthians the second chapter and I brethren when I come to you come not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech you know I'm just gonna have to say this I probably shouldn't but my brother and sister I have a hard time relating to the minister to the preacher to the individual that never had a trial never struggle this always been the overcomer has always had the revelation has always been this and you poor folks now I'm sorry I day to him I don't believe them I'd rather let you know that I strut like you strong that I am weak I tremble I have fear I've had my doubts but by God's grace amen by God's grace we rise above that not because we sit in a church with some awesome awesome super possum preacher but we serve an awesome God hallelujah and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men now remember we went through this the other day faith would equate confidence trust amen so your trust should not stand in the wisdom of men amen but in the power of God howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to nought but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit oh my real motivation to actually get into the Spirit of God amen because we pray for revelation if I can imply this to you this morning we pray for revelation and what does God do he doesn't go over here and just start opening a book or pages to us God takes us over here and causes us to get into the spirit he brings us to a place in our life that we get in the spirit why because God is bound you might say by his own word amen he cannot say one thing and do another and so for yet he has to be obedient that you might say to his own word and he's come here and told us now he hath revealed them unto us these mysteries right he's revealed them to us by his spirit so you've got to get in this spirit he doesn't say go to seminary become an intellectual learn Hebrew learn Greek he said get into the spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of God for what man knows the things of a man save the spirit of Man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is of God that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God I want to drive that scripture home now we have received not the spirit of the world now my brother and sister if we're talking Christians the spirit of the world might not be worldly us but the spirit of the world the intellectualism it can be that knowledge is power now I believe knowledge is power my brother and sister you you need to know what you're doing you know even driving a car you know you need to know what you're doing else you're gonna crash so having knowledge on how to drive the car is power but my brother and sister a Christian is not relying on the wisdom of men as the scripture has said it's not relying on what the world says would be the evidence of the Holy Ghost it's not relying on what the church says you must do if you're going to make it in a rapture because we have all kinds of sayings in the churches of what it takes to serve God some say it's as simple as picking up your BIC and signing your name well hallelujah it don't get any simpler than that go ahead sign your name if you want but we're gonna look for something greater hmm my I feel like preaching I think that's what I supposed to be here doing this more is it yes freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto Him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man now some people would say that and say well praise the Lord nobody's going to judge me note my brother and sister it's telling us here that our judge is not man but it's acknowledged that it is gone Alleluia we will be judged amen there'll be no man passed from this life from this earth that is not judged it just won't be man that judges the Bride of Christ amen for who knoweth the mind of God that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ Heavenly Father we thank you today for your grace your mercy your guiding hand Lord we thank you even though sometimes father it's hard to see it we even thank you today for the trial so we thank you for the times Lord that we feel as it is put down distressed overburdened father but Lord to see the Sun rising in the morning father to see you coming on the scene fresh again for us today Lord how it moves our hearts moves our souls Lord to know that we stand here today father by your mercy and by your grace but also by your spoken word father that said that be the overcomer of the day now Lord we believe that and Lord we want our lives to reflect that in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Saints hallelujah amen can somebody say praise the Lord hallelujah amen you know as Paul was speaking to the Corinthians I always marvel at this scripture that he says I came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God see he never tried to take a superior approach to the people Paul as we can look through this scripture he come and you know declared that he would be all things to all people and in that my brother and sister that doesn't mean he went out and behaved like them and what he could speak in intellectual fashion if necessary always reminds me of our brother Mike stroke off his book you know and I I just found that we were cleaning out a bookcase and brother Mark I mean and I was cleaning out a bookcase and and there's my bookmark just about halfway through the book and that's how far I made it because I got tired of looking through the dictionary while I was reading his book because he uses words I've never even heard of but you see he wasn't speaking it to the common man or believer he actually wrote the book or the intent of the intellectual to be able to read that and in their realm where their mind went where they dwell it would be a perfect understanding and he read it wrote that I mean that they might read it and and not have an excuse or not be able to look down and say well it's the ignorant and the unlearned that serve God my brother and sister the Apostle Paul was very smart man we can see as it was through history and he could have base himself and speak to the uneducated he could speak to the working man the middle class he could speak to the educated the priest whoever it might be and so he was able to come in such a fashion that God anointed him to be able to reach out and to to speak in that realm and so we look today that the Word of God my brother and sisters some people would take it they think if someone's really smart you know those that are above average intelligence that you know hey the scripture says they're going to have a hard time making it my brother and sister that is not what the scripture was meaning it is those people who have come and believed by theirs pure intellect that they're above things amen so you can have a very high IQ and have as it were a simple faith in Jesus Christ and be blessed by the Word of God amen so you know he says I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified now I'm not interpreting nobody misunderstand me I'm not interpreting what this is saying this is a thought that come to me and I thought you know I determined not to know anything and you know my brother and sister as a pastor as a minister I talked to some too much sometimes but the older I get the more I like to just sit and listen I like to just try to understand where it's coming where it's coming from and you know it's one thing to preach to a church you know you know if you knew that this family is having a problem and you know I'm not talking about preaching at them I'm talking about preaching to them and you know a family's having a problem and you want to buy you know this burning desire in your heart you want to help them and so by God's grace you are able to preach to them in such a way that they might realize we have a situation and that is the solution but my brother and sister while that is wonderful right we can look out that's a pastor's job right that's a ministry's job is to look out amongst the church amongst the saints and to deal with the issues that are there now some people would say well we don't like that because it feels like we're being preached to well you wouldn't have liked any one of God's messengers through the ages because they would preach to you Amen people want some ambiguous kind of message that they can digest in a very simple format and move on and we'll you know read dr. Dobson to answer our questions no my brother's sister that's what the preaching of the word is for is to answer our questions amen so it's one thing for the pastor of the minister to speak in a fashion like that to something that might be a little obvious or people might say well you know he's preaching out about that but he knows all about that well my brother and sister I found nowhere in the word that says you can't preach about it because you know about it amen but I'll tell you how much more it is Saints when God would anoint a minister and he's reaching totally as it were blind to what is happening in the world around him how much more so when the word comes to you and I and deals with things in our lives that no one knows about but you and Almighty God now how much greater the Holy Spirit moving in our myths discerning the spirits is earning the situation and saying I'm going to answer your prayer I'm going to answer your need your cry but you know if we're not careful the devil will come in and people get an idea he's preaching at me well my brother and sister if he was preaching at you you know sometimes I just I don't like this and I'm just venting for a moment okay turn the fans on get all the exhaust out of here I'm venting why is it that people think the preacher has always got some kind of a axe to grind with the people anointing of the devil amen any other suggestions amen I think we'll stick with that one right there because it's spot on my brother and sister why do people think hmm that was pointed at me well there must be something there or else you would say I don't know who he's preaching to but God help them so the very fact that people rise up and push back the preachers preaching at me shows there something there that needs dealt with but it's easier to say well he's a mean vindictive man well hallelujah my how much more to preach on the things and let it be led of the Holy Ghost not the word how preeminence in us that the word would we say lord please hear my I answer my prayer Lord and then he answers it and we're like mad at somebody come on why don't we say you know what Lord you know the old phrase if the shoe fits Lord let where it if I need to pray more Lord let me pray more if I need to repent let me repent Lord if I need to whatever it might be Lord just let me do it hey man nothing to be ashamed of look sister Jerry not to put her on the spot but she pointed out to me the other day and a certain tape brother branham's talking and brother branham calls out and says yeah brother so-and-so you know he committed adultery oh my we did that in our churches this day and age people would they would boycott the church they would have a adulterers lives matter' a meeting in the parking lot and they would boycott the church because how dare they say my name over pulpit but my brother and sister you come to the place where the Holy Spirit is moving and God is earning hearts and that man was like praise the Lord he wasn't yeah I would alter and now I'm ashamed he said I was an adulterer and now I'm free hallelujah see a whole difference of the moving of the Holy Spirit amen and what it's doing in men's lives no we don't make a habit of calling adulterers out over the pulpit but my brother and sister if God did instead of rebelling against that let your heart be broken down and say Lord he really wasn't talking to me because I've already repented amen hallelujah it might be anything you might be a thief or a liar or whatever he's not talking to me I've already repented amen hallelujah amen you know going down to verse five it says that your faith your trust your confidence Amen that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God now my brother and sister just as many men get lifted up on a pedestal Amen this is this is something that God will not allow this many men get lifted up on the pedestal and we start heading towards idolatry God will let them fall off the pedestal to get our eyes off of the man and get them back on God so you know what you don't want to see somebody a pastor and minister evangelist etc you don't want to see them fall off the pedestal don't lift them up there amen respect them the scripture says we're not respect as a person respect them as your brother your sister whatever it might be Ron's sister being lifted up but amen but you respect them for who they are sons and daughters of God amen give as it were respect or reverence to them but my brother and sister they're still just your brother amen so we don't need to be lifting them up let's look let the wisdom of God amen the power of God be what we lift up hallelujah now look God calls it you know men to offices in the ministry and etc of the church my brother and sister you know the coffin of God brought very good clarity in my opinion when he said if you have a problem you know this is me interpreting it so don't struggle you have a problem with that brother and you can't respect him there might be an issue you can't respect him at least respect the office that's how much value God put on the office so you struggle with a man at least respect to the office but when you come to the place that they disrespect the man in the office you realize they don't even respect the office I got to get on to my thought here we'll be here all day and some of you will then have an axe to grind oh my hallelujah amen now look I want to go right in here lay out my thought today help me Lord and how many tonight how many people have sold out their birthright to the things of the world and got away from God oh we got to be careful about that my brother and sister we're not talking about bad people we're talking about people that Satan has twisted circumstance twisted things and maybe in their life and their past in the church their relationship to the church to ministry amen and so they get it was kind of caught in a situation and they got away from God amen stay with the word that's the reason coming into a meeting talking about taking or talking about taking one I got a thumb down here Lord help me I'm just so wound up my help me Lord got away from God stay with the word that's the reason coming into a meeting talking about taking one another spirit coming into a meeting we like to stay right with the word stay with the word so that the spirit of the word will be on the people not the spirit of some fantastic or some minister or something that we have to answer for that in the day of judgment amen now this my brother and sister you look and there's several quotes where brother Branham talks about this he's talking about how if we're not careful that the people would come in and they might take on the spirit of their pastor and not the Holy Spirit or take on the spirit of another person without taking on the Spirit Holy Spirit so you look at that and we realize that we as humans are very subjective I'll put myself to this you know my wife she mocks me unmercifully we go to Australia in a couple days of being in Australia and she's like oh and where was you born at well I don't know mate it's just something that happened to me I go to the South she even she mocks me maybe I am throwing her under the bus maybe she'll repent from that behavior but we go to the south and next thing I know I'm saying y'all and she just can't help herself she's like oh where y'all from you know my brother and sister it's easy I recognize this it's easy sometimes to take on this spirit now look if you got a pastor that's mean and vindictive and you got this and he's brup tanned rude my brother and sister you getting it's like that and you'll find the people treat each other that very same way amen so you find that somewhere you have a church they the pastor he doesn't want to hurt anybody's feelings no where no how no time and pretty soon the church just lets anything go because well you know we just don't want to hurt their feelings that might be the Bride of Christ my brother and sister what we need to do is like the prophet of God said is stay with the word amen and the reason they're coming into a meeting talking about taking one another spirit coming into meeting we like to stay right with the words right with the words so that the spirit of the word will be on the people amen let me tell you you don't want to catch my spirit hey man you you know you don't want to think like I think I think some crazy thoughts sometimes I think things you know like Oh Lord if I was young again I would do this and this and then I remember I was young and I did that and that's why I have bad knees and ankles and elbows so you don't want to have that kind of we don't want to be the risk-taker oh well we'll just stand on this doctrine and well if it's not right we'll just take our chances no my brother and sister we're not gonna be the risk taker I want something solid reminds me many years ago a man come to me and he says hey brother Paul I've done an investment and he said you know this investment you'd be able to take that and brother Paul you just borrow a seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars on the farm and invested in this deal it'll bring this return it'll bring you back this many thousands dollars a month and you can make of the payment on the seven hundred and fifty thousand with this portion and it leaves you this portion to to live on and be free to be a pastor and never work again and I looked at that and I thought my if that is so good if this thing is so good oh it sounds so good my brother and sister I can borrow that money and literally have thousands every month to live on and looking at what sister Jerry and I live on I thought my three-times our life three times our life every month enough just a few months it's what we make in a whole year that's good but something in the back of my mind said now if this is so good why are they coming to the little people there's people out here that literally have millions they don't need to borrow against their farm they don't need to take a chance they don't need a rip they got millions sitting in the bank why aren't they getting 30% interest back on their money why are they coming to people like me amen I'll tell you I wasn't no but I'm not interested well it's sad because the man I guess we could call him a brother he told me I was foolish and that I was making one of the biggest mistakes in my life and when it made the front page news across the United States as one of the biggest Ponzi schemes that ever had come to the United States I thought that's interesting you see there is no free lunch you want to be an overcoming Christian have to pray you have to read your Bible you have to all well know the prophet of God tells us you shouldn't have someone telling you what to do that's not a relationship with the Lord if the pastor says now don't you go to the theater don't you drink don't you watch these filthy movies don't you listen to that music my brother's sister that's not the leadership for the Holy Ghost you need to get to a place that there's something inside of you that says praise the Lord I don't want to feed on that that's not me anyhow they created all of that nonsense for someone else amen so you don't need the pastor every Sunday to tell you not to do those things but now that I mentioned it we all not be doing those things hallelujah so people sell out their birth rights right and he's saying you know we're talking about getting one another spirit if we stay with the word so that the spirit of the word will be on the people not the spirit of something fantastic now brothers sisters I've been in services that we're speaking in tongues have to admit when it first started caught me a little off guard but then as my mind process this we're allowed to do that right we don't have to throw our brain in the trash when we become a believer I stop that's according to the word it didn't disrupt the BRIT to the preaching of the word it's on the word it's there it's correct and I just settled down and said Lord praise the Lord you hear and the words that were spoken in the interpretation or according to the word oh it didn't change one single thing in my life I still have to go live the word I can't say I've seen this I've been there I experienced it oh no my brother's sister we still got to live the word amen so we're not just gonna rely on some fantastic right I've told you many times here in the church that little girls aren't being healed amen not just healed as in the pain going away but literally the bones going right back into the place they're supposed to be so that the arm was like it was supposed to be I've witnessed through that I couldn't stand before you and Almighty God now i that saw her arm before i saw her arm after that little girl is not even serving god today now will she I believe she will but you see my brother and sister the supernatural come down and touched that little girl but that was not enough to keep her serving God amen it takes more than just coming in contact with what you might call the fantastic amen it takes something fantastic happening deep down in the soul amen when that happens hallelujah a no matter well or all hell assail you you'll keep serving God now this little girl she's a sweet little girl I pray for her amen I believe that God honored and healed her and he didn't just waste that effort and then she'll be back but my brother and sister in the day that we live in young people in the day that we live in discuss mama and daddy are good believers just because you went to a good church and you was raised up right that ain't going to be no kind of anchor for you you've got to get your own anchor a man you've never seen someone out on the river fishing drive over to another boat and say can I borrow your anchor you got to have your own anchor amen now look so not some fantastic or of some Minister that's one of the biggest things we have today I'm going to just labor on this for a minute amen that's the biggest thing we have today people are all identified I go to so and so's church well I'll tell you what my brother and sister sometimes it's just part of our vocabulary so I'm not judging you for that I'm gonna call you out on that as it were but there are those that are down in their heart is if you don't go to our church you are going to hell well my brother and sister that's going to be really hard when we have a universal gospel going into all the world and bring them back to your hometown no go you in all the world and preach the gospel the life of Jesus Christ let them see the life amen then let them colonize or whatever you want to call it their own community by sharing the gospel hallelujah amen now as we look at this I want to just go back into the scripture if we could brother Ivan sister Vika amen I'm proud of sister Vika she's getting pretty good at this amen now look at this which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual you see my brother and sister we can we can get into man's wisdom I've shared this many times I'll just bump on it real quick here now you know to set there and have someone tell you well brother Paul we can't fully understand what was spoke right here unless we know the Hebrew and I'm doing a home study Hebrew course and I thought I might as well just quit because I can't even hardly do English and I tried to learn Spanish and did I'm just a terrible job on that and moving on to Hebrew I'm out of luck but my brother and sister you see it's not by man's wisdom I would rather have God speak to me then learn 10 languages amen I would rather have God speaking through me through the foolishness of preaching than me sitting home in my dark little office trying to figure out which Greek or Hebrew or Arabic word meant what amen because I'll just give you a hint there's many of them are so close to each other but different and here we are all the way down through history now reading this and saying one scholar says it's Arabic another one says it's Greek another one says it's Hebrew but the words are also close my we're not going to make it into rapture until we can resurrect these guys and ask them which one they were using no let the Spirit of God speak amen speak Lord receive not the things of the spirit for they are foolishness unto them neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned so all of this my brother and sister cannot be brought about in a natural element it must come with the Holy Ghost teaching us comparing the spiritual with the spiritual amen that's why we cannot put the Bible to the side and say well we have a message my brother and sister we have the Bible for a purpose but God made it an anchor post forest he himself declared it was his absolute if it's good enough for him amen it'll be good enough for you and I hallelujah look at this for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ that's pretty bold words the Apostle Paul is speaking they're really bold words he's telling look we don't have to have this over here amen we're not going to come to a place we can tell God I tell you I say this partly in humor but partly in a way it amazes me and you know sometimes I do listen to other things and and this man one day was making the excellent point and I was enjoying what he had to say til he got to this spot where he said well what God really meant was I was like oh well I think what God really meant was what he said I think that applied to the prophets message my oh my the reminder once speak on fresh revelation amen God who is rich in mercy we'll go through here here we go if a man comes out with an odd peculiar ministry that's found in the Bible to be the truth let's just stop right there none of you read ahead you're cheating you might find the ministry that what he's saying he has a unique way of bringing it he has a different approach to it and that's all good if it's found in the Bible but he says and that man stays right in the same old denominational doctrine forget it you can't go right down into the deep things of God and just say well that's good look at this revelation but we're gonna just stay as we are our families you know for six generations have been Methodists or Baptists or whatever you know my family we're such a Heinen's 59 is that all right to say Heinz 57 okay I'll reduce it a little bit we got Baptists we got Methodists we've got Catholics we've got Mormons I think we even have a seventh-day Adventist hid in there somewhere my mix that all together what do you got one man told me and he was trying to be humorous because he comes from a very similar background he said well I tell you throw our family together and they get to arguing about that and he says they all because they're family and they love each other they come to conclusion and that is we go on Wednesday to visit he said we go on Saturday to go to church and we worship on Sunday what is it convoluted convoluted but you see if a man comes out and comes out with something that is truth but he stay right in his old denominational doctor and forget it nothing to it God don't do it like that that thing that's rotten manna that's got termites in it or wiggle tails or whatever you want to call it from 4050 years ago now come on Saints this can't apply to you and I this is not oh look at them poor denominational people amen whatever you want to call it 40 50 years ago still trying to eat that old manner that fell way back years ago and the children of Israel in their journey knew manna fell every night that's right you couldn't keep it over you we don't live over the same thing age gone by we're eating new man a fresh man out of heaven in our journey as we go on hallelujah now look some people say well there's brother Paul bashing on the Prophet and the message again no you're actually so so totally a hundred and eighty degrees off because my brother and sister this is a living message it didn't stop in 1965 when brother Branham preached his last sermon it did not stop when there so-and-so passed away or brother so-and-so over here but this word is living it is new manna every single night Amen it falls and God comes fresh on these people and it will be there people say well we gotta have this and we gonna have that look stop what is the word say what is a prophet of God say no manna and you can't keep it over it gets wiggle tails hallelujah we can stop and look I'm gonna be direct this morning I hope I don't offend the one but we can look and say look what God did with brother Branham right here look what was happening right there you looking back my brother and sister you guaranteed to crash the prophet of God even gave an analogy as it were to that and you don't look in the rearview mirror you're gonna you gotta be looking forward what does that mean they very that come down revealed the word to a prophet that broke open the whole Bible made it a new book my brother and sister is the same God that's here in Grace Tabernacle this morning opening the Bible making it a new book this morning a man not when you got saved it's not just a new book from that moment it's a new book here this morning Amen that you and I could look in the word and we can say praise the Lord I see what the Prophet was talking about right here it's coming to pass not around the world somewhere it's coming to pass right here in my hometown it might even be coming pass on the positive note right here in our church but it takes a living God to make it come my brother and sister just cuz it was spoke years ago unless God backed it up it would never come to pass but it is it is coming to pass hallelujah oh so people sometimes my brother and sister they say you're so caught up Oh what about this this is lovely this lovely well you know what when the prophet of God I want to go right back to this prophet of God talking about that eagle it goes there they're up there on the mountain amen if no other eagle ever comes now I'm talking about some unity we have all kinds of unity I heard a guy the other day saying well there's gonna come a day here when we're gonna have unity in the message all the way around the world no we're not no we're not I'm sorry unity in the bride yes but not just in the message it's always been that way every move every move of God's always had that the prophet of God said there's three kinds of believers it's a make believe we're gonna start uniting and saying well hallelujah I got a die to myself I've got to get filled with the Holy Ghost I got to get in the word fill my lamp know my brother and sister and make believer can't go there the unbelievers not going to go there but these are still identified as message now this might be a little directed it is forgive me but look my brother and sister we got to focus on what is uh what it is what is the word for you and I okay now this will be even more offensive and I hope it isn't but if you're an unbeliever don't don't don't act like you're a believer acknowledge I don't believe this and we respect you for that amen I got friends and I've witnessed - and they've got me Paul I don't know what you believe but I just can't believe that our church we're Lutheran's nobody ever taught us that okay I respect that he never brought it up again I've never brought it up again he's still my friend but you see my brother and sister we have a responsibility to realize that if the man is here we've got to eat it you can't say well you know that was Old Testament stuff the manna no no fresh manna man is coming out of heaven right right today amen the word is coming down today hallelujah hallelujah see I'm not talking about a new revelation there's people get all bent out of shape when you start talking about things like this you know a fresh revelation Oh what are you doing new you know no we're not talking about adding to the word my brother and sister Amen I'm not talking about taking away from the word I'm talking us right realizing that we are led by the Spirit of God to have the mind of Christ and in that the Bible became a new book this is not cliches this is the truth there's a truth though Bible becomes a new book if you read the Bible and put it down and got no inspiration from it you need to stop go back and pray and read that scripture again in fact you know that's one of the things I've voiced it to you through the years I've never been all excited about these read the Bible in a year now brother and sister because you see these people they pick up their Bible amen and I applaud them they're picking up their Bible and they're reading it but they pick up their Bible and this is the way those things work I've got I'm over here and do two romani I've got to read 23 verses and then I've got to go over here into Isaiah and I have to read 12 verses today then I've got to go over here into the book of Acts and read 22 in a year later what did you get out of the Bible come on Saints I tell you just read that same two three four five scriptures fifty times if you've got to read it for it to speak to you and when it speaks to you you'll never forget it but if it never speaks to you it's just like reading a book Alleluia I'm sorry this sounds a little mocking and I don't mean it to but we might as well just start to read the Encyclopedia in a year and I knew a kid in high school that did that he was really smart not only I'll tell you how smart he was he tell you in the prett Anika on page 774 oh yeah what did I say well it has this subject this subject this subject this subject and then he would just do and I thought he's just fooling us I'll go into the library I get the Britannica out turn seven seven four and there it is halfway down the page great awesome but he couldn't tie his shoes he walked down the hallway in high school with his shoelaces dragging behind him all the time one day I was sitting there joking with him he was a friend of mine joking with him I said who taught you to tie your shoelaces and he said my little brother that explains who taught his little brother well whatever it was it wouldn't wouldn't sustain it didn't work my brother and sister what we need is to catch the real revelation we need to catch this revelation that there is manna falling today it's fresh it's not old blue you know does that mean catch a spirit here does that mean we are putting the message behind us no it doesn't it's the message unfolding to us it's the message not just words on a tape letters on a page it is a living word of God coming alive in you and I hallelujah there's where the difference is amen moving beyond brother branham well you know that can always be a little bit of a controversial statement also because the Prophet himself said I must decrease that he might increase and so that means that somewhere along the line he's going to stop being the preeminent thought that we have and our Prima thought is Jesus Christ rising up before the people amen oh this getting deep water brother Paul that's good I brought my life jacket and my waders amen because my brother and sister it all depends on what you think the message is some people think that it is just words printed on the page and voice on a tape that we listen to of a man speaking named William Branham but I'm sorry when I was young man not even fully serving the Lord kind of just doing what I wanted I thought that understanding that the message was Jesus Christ amen now God has always used man down through the age he's used them for his purpose as his mouthpiece as his labour sister Jerry and I was driving down the road discussing you know how is it you know here is brother branham sitting in a service young man young woman making love to each other kissing and smacking and cuddling and whatever and God dealing with him that whatever he spoke my brother and sister would be what happened to those and sister Jerry brought this up because we just been studying coming across these things and and you know my brother and sister met redemption amen what is Redemption Amen well repentance is Redemption it is in repentance that we find Redemption and so here is this young couple doing what they're doing and I believe with all my heart call me silly if you want to I believe with all my heart that if brother Branham had said let the judgment of God fall on them they'd had died right there amen they might have thrown a whole terror into that church but I tell you what it would also done it would have scared a lot of people away that just needed to know a little love of Jesus Christ so what does he do I forgive them amen what does God do he comes he corrects that they stop what they're doing because the Spirit of God move now you compare that to Elijah and they're calling him some old bald-headed prophet I imagine some of those words were probably just pretty strong and does he do he calls those she bears out and it kills all them boys my brother and sister well you say well I guess brother Brown would have had you know every bit of right as he lie she did but what was the gift for what was the season it was not a season of judgment it was a season of restoration now if that young couple didn't Nate never came to the Lord that's a possibility but I'll tell you what would happen someone have been in there that needed to know the love of God and they realized you know what those kids deserved whatever would have come on their but Lord so would I oh can we say that this morning but so bad I whatever would come upon me Lord no I don't want to I don't want to jump to my brother I don't want to judge my sister Lord because either judgment would come on me none are perfect but him hallelujah oh but look at this not a revelation to add or take away but we must be led by the spirit to under and what has even been given to us you see it's energized my brother and sister it's energized into the inner man it's not an outward thing if it's just on our flesh on the outside then the season will come that the anointing will leave the flesh and the flesh will go back where the flesh came from but my brother and sister when it's energized on the inside the Holy Spirit moving down deep into the soul amen it energizes that inner man and he has a fresh understanding and it comes right from the throne of God comes right from the throne of God and comes to him or her young or all but you see some don't be as possible they say well the prophets off the scene there's no relation coming from the throne well my brother and sister I'm telling you you're wrong not here to argue about it or whatever but I'm telling you you're wrong because there's inspiration coming from the throne of God there's revelation coming from the throne of God every single day to those that are seeking it now if you don't believe it's for you then it's not for you amen I just come across the other day wished I could tell you the service but brother Branham was praying and this lady comes up in the prayer line and she's needing healing and brother Branham says you need faith now what would you rather have would you rather have healing or faith see we have proof right on the tape you can track it all down a woman come in the prayer line got prayed for a guy healed went home never desired one more thing she went right back to her own life only now she's healed but I'll tell you what faith will do faith will bring you to a place for healing of your body but faith will also bring you into a place that you crave a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ oh give me faith hallelujah Patrick hippy said give me liberty or give me death I say my brother and sister Lord give us faith or just take us from the earth now because with faith we cannot accomplish anything hallelujah amen proverbs - one through eleven amen I love this scripture it's just beautiful my son if thou wilt receive my words ya see we got to receive the word otherwise it's all for naught and hide my Commandments with thee so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom and apply that heart to understanding yay if thou criest after knowledge and lift us up thy voice for understanding now look at verse 4 well III cried I've signed and cried for the abominations of City Lord forgive all these heathens was that really a sigh and a cry my brother and sister too many of us cry after a knowledge we cry for understanding but if somebody told you there was a hole in the ground on the mountain with silver in it you'd put more effort climbing the mountain and then you would the knowledge of God that's kind of straight I'm sorry to put it that way but then again I'm not sometimes we just need to face it you see if that was Cephas her talking about knowledge and understanding if thou seekest her as silver and searches for her as for hid treasures you know reminds me one time off the coast of Florida this man did research I don't want to exaggerate but I do believe it was something like 16 or 17 years a Spanish galleon that had left Mexico or down in that area was sailing it sailed off the tip of Florida they're going back to Europe the stories through the piers were that that ship was laden with gold and silver and the stories never change didn't matter whether you're talking native people families that somehow had some relative or something associated and through the years and this became a lore but this this man he's I don't know his name I don't remember it but we probably could find it because he's a known treasure hunter in that part of the world and he studied the stories and the accounts that came from various places and he decided I believe there's merit to this story now we're talking a long long time like a long long time like 350 years or something don't take my math I just realized my math is bad so as he do he spends 17 16 17 years and it keeps getting these hits on the area off of Florida there but it's one of those things that when one of those big storms wouldn't come it would shift the seafloor move sand and he would the hits that he would find before that he couldn't detect them any longer and then seasons go by and he would be out there again and he would detect and then he couldn't he could find it and he couldn't find it and he could find it but it was in like 300 foot of water just a little bit too deep to freedive took a little more equipment a little more effort but over the years he become so convinced that there was a ship there so they get the equipment they get all the stuff together and he dives a lot of currents down there was really really dangerous dive and he's going over the seafloor and his little detector thing he has keeps going off but he can't see anything and then the storms would come and he'd have to quit and he come back again in a year and then a particularly bad storm had passed through and something in his instinct told him now's the time the oceans been stirred up go and he tells his one friend he says you know much money as this cost this might be the last time I can afford to do this it just too expensive costing hundreds of thousands of dollars for all this support and he goes down to the bottom and he's walking along the bottom with his helmet on and his air hose and all this stuff and he looks down and there is a solid gold face and he picks it up he looks at it and says where there is I believe this was his words where there is one blessing there's always another and he got down and started digging and he found gold coins he found whatever he ended up splitting it I don't remember what the deal was his share of it when it was all done was millions of dollars if thou seekest her as silver and searches for her as for hid treasures well I went to church on Sunday I didn't like what the preacher was preaching on I'm done how deep you digging if that's all the deeper you go you're not gonna find knowledge or understanding you got to get past the preachers sorry church you got to get past Paul you got to get past Grace Tabernacle you got to get past all these things you can't take on the spirit of anything else around here you got to get on the spirit of Christ amen for the Lord giveth oh now shall understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God for the Lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly he keepeth the passive judgment and preserveth the way of his Saints then shall understand righteousness and judgment and equity yay every good path when wisdom in earth into thine heart and knowledge is pleasant into thine sole discretion shall preserve the understanding shall keep thee Oh hallelujah how about this is just the revelation of Jesus Christ amen can we take that right now this morning do we are we students enough of the message to take the revelation of Jesus Christ and apply it right into these scripture and right here you're not going to just run out and find the revelation of Jesus Christ you're gonna have to as a son or daughter of God you're gonna have to constantly be as it were in pursuit of it you're gonna have to constantly be saying Lord I want to see more of you I want to understand more of I want your mind or push my mind out and fill it with your mind because without that kind of hunger without kind of desire we will become traditional we will be less grace tabernacle is a message church we believe all of the message brother branham blah blah and blah blah blah and blah blah blah my brother and sister that won't be good enough hey man that won't be good enough knowing that there's a prophet on this scene amen won't get you in a rapture knowing Jesus Christ will get you in a rapture hallelujah because it's that wisdom it's that knowledge it's that understanding and when the world tries to baffle you with all of its we have proof here we have proof there my brother and sister I tell you the proof I have it's right down inside here it's not external you can knock down every Church in the Middle East as Isis and all that was doing believing they were accomplishing something destroying church after church after church thinking we're wiping them off the face of the earth they're not wiping the Bride of Christ off the face of the earth amen there's nothing out here knock down every Church take away everything because the knowledge and the wisdom and the virtue and the righteousness of Almighty God is not external its internal and it's right down in the soul and they gonna lock you in the jail and you can have a revival Amen do we don't have scripture for that amen they can try and shut you up throw you in the burning oil and you can step right out of there and say praise the Lord amen because we're not living in this flesh we're not living in some old dead message of a day gone by but we've got a fresh revelation and it came this morning and it's coming even more this morning because God is present on the scene hallelujah oh I love that scripture amen now I got a hurry along here now if Jesus Christ is the vine in his life now remember the vine does not bear fruit the branch bears fruit but it's energized come on Saints not just a little bit of SAP trickling oh come on we got way too many people like that yeah ah oh oh I'll leave that rest I'll just leave that rest well then if the life of Christ being us it'll bring his spirit and his work right it's got to because it's the vine of God so what we're looking for is not just a little bit of a something trickling up and down you know something getting pushed out of the branch into us you know being kind of forced on is my brother and sister I'll tell you what I like I like it when I come to church and there's something me in me that is just so excited amen so excited to be in the house of God now you say brother Paul you didn't look excited no this old flesh is getting kind of wore out I'm sorry you know it's just walking down a ditch Bank a couple days ago change in siphon tubes I had already you know yeah you know those of you not familiar with he walk along there one way or Direction just set there and change these tubes set them you know and now I took a step what happened I'm glad I was by myself I looked really silly I was out there finally I don't snicker finally I did what I should have did the very first thing I said lord I need you to help me I stood up said another 100 some siphon tubes him walked off and worked the rest of day but I'll tell you where this flesh is that this flesh is getting wore out hallelujah the Lord tarries I hope you guys are all very very sympathetic to Pastor for life because I'm going to need it is this work stuff is getting to be too much look you know what happens Saints come on I hope you have a sense of humor no no I wasn't trying to peddle something on you like okay now I just need you guys to send me four thousand three hundred sixty two dollars and sixteen cents every month no no no no I have a sense of humor now let's go back to the vineyard here we got the branch and the vine my brother and sister you know what they do even in modern day vineyard we got a lot of them out there we'll reform every spring they'll be just hundreds of guys walking up now hundreds of folks walking up and down the field they got all these little nippers you don't need big me first because you're not chopping off big branches you're chopping off the vine and all of that stuff I mean you would think they've gone crazy right they want they want that stuff for grapes to grow on it and they're walking along there one on each side this roast it's just a litter of trash behind them what are they doing those little branches all drew grapes last year what are you guys doing but you know what what's happening right now st. all that growth is coming out and it's all coming where is it the life was never in that it was down in the fine it was down in the root it wasn't up here in the stock Amen now look what we're looking at now is this word coming back to a people amen so the old brittle branch cannot bring forth fruit right the Master Gardener he cuts away I think that's dead so if you walk out a church sometimes you feel like somebody's been cutting on you oh the pastor made a couple cutting statements well stop and say thank you lord I didn't need that amen so the vine puts out a new branch and it bears the fruit of the vine now lamentations 3 in 22 oh my where my at hear the lamentations 322 on their brother Ivan anyway it's all right lamentations 322 through 26 it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his Compassion's fail not but they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness the Lord is my portion saith my soul therefore will I hope in him the Lord is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that seeketh him it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord Amen I love this scripture is good it is only of the Lord's mercy Saints we're not already consumed hey man I go back to and I've just put a broad a broad scheme here Buster's of the flesh pride of life heady highminded liars thieves adulterers fornicators you just go down through the list my brother and sister and you look at that and realize if it was not without God's grace we would already be consumed but his compassion amen that mercy that's falling every morning is falling on you and I now it's there that compassion my brother and sister is bringing grace to us but that same compassion is bringing his life his word everything this comes down to feed us because that manner that come my brother and sister now brother branham I might skip over this because a it's a long quote but brother Brown was talking about how a little boy you know was asking his mama he says mama now did Jesus did God have great big ovens up there in heaven making all that manner no I doesn't need to he's a creator a man as it was with the five thousand just tear a chunk off my brother and sister he didn't tear that loaf down to where he was down there picking at the crumbs if we could just catch the vision of God the Creator in our mists and he's breaking off a piece of bread and right there before their eyes it's coming right back breaking it off it's coming right back breaking it off it's coming right back hallelujah break the tail off of that fish it's got another tail hallelujah God did that what was he doing he was showing us the creative value that he placed in the Bride of Christ I put my word in you oh I hope you with me I put my word in you and my word will not diminish it will not fade away it cannot fail because I'm the creator that created the word in the beginning and I put it in you so no matter how strenuous your life is no matter the troubles and travail you go through amen my brother and sister no matter the word is there and is always there it is sufficient amen can we trust him hallelujah let it fall every morning what is this this is a fresh revelation coming down on the Bride of Christ to wake up and say I'm an overcomer today hallelujah I've got to Christ in me I've got the word in me amen another day yesterday might have been terrible I'll tell you what I think I think the Bride of Christ must be the world's greatest optimist though all hail or sell you in the world's falling down yesterday we get up in the morning praise the Lord I'm an overcomer today God's mercy is upon me his blessings are on me well you know what about your business its failing what about this over here and what about that over there what about this circumstance well I'm sorry but that was yesterday you're crazy yeah I am praise the Lord hallelujah oh my well we're not gonna make it there hallelujah this boat hasn't got enough gas in it let's go back brother Ivan - then Jesus come and called Oh hallelujah now you know whatever Church soon is going to have to belong that World Council of Churches and when you do you'll forfeit your van Jellicle rights when you do that and if you don't then you can't be a denomination no more if you want to know about the groundwork of this Saints I'll just give you a quick lesson on this right now under the Internal Revenue Code in the United States a church is sovereign and requires no permission for the government we do not have to tell them what we've done where we've done it or how we've done it but Satan being so clever he come along and they wrote a code called 501c3 and then they come as it were to the churches and said we'll allow you to put your name on billboards in the course the internet didn't exist when this is written but you know the internet and everywhere else if you'll just sign up and be a 501c3 and they said you mean we can we can then go to corporations you see we as a church cannot solicit but now as a 501 C 3 you can solicit we could go to corporations and say now we're a little Church over here but we're doing this work and this is happening here and this here what would you give us and they'll write big checks it happened Saints but did you know that by signing up to be a 501c3 they limited your voice and they do it anyhow because the church is more worried about getting their hands on something else and so we can't talk about politics or what's wrong with our government we cannot talk about social issues lest we be censored we cannot even as it were ask someone to not inhabit or Church you violated all the rules well I will put in perspective if you had somebody decided they wanted to come and be a belly dancer in our four year every Sunday morning and we're 501c3 we couldn't ask them to leave because they're expressing their religion and the majority of churches in the United States have signed up for that well praise the Lord and when you do you'll forfeit your evangelical rights see many of them have already joined and don't even know it they won't stand on the Word of God less they'll lose status unless they'll find themselves in a repercussion because every denomination has come into it you read of it it's just the same as I have it's a darkest hour the little church ever had everything has went out for Pentecost awake yourself up and right in the darkest of hour then here comes Jesus along to vindicate he is with you he is here see the darkest of our I heard a little story just take a minute to tell her the woman was called a County come to look at her cuz she was poverty-stricken she had a son and he'd went to India some time ago and he a very nice friend a fine boy and so the woman just got so without food and everything until the county had to come and investigate for County food for her and when they was there the man said well don't you have any loved ones to help you she said oh I have a son said what does he do oh he's an electrical engineer in India well who is he working for United States government why don't he help you said well well he doesn't help me but well well so why don't you ask him instead of calling the county she said well he's such a sweet boy he writes me such sweet letters and he said I you know I love him but I can't tell him I'm gonna need like this I said he writes you letters and you hear from him and everything yes and he still won't help you said no but he sends me some of the prettiest pictures you ever seen in my life so the man said let me see some of the pictures she said all right sir I've got them right here in the Bible and she opened them up and began to bring them out you know what they was money orders from India with pitchers they all got pictures you see money orders she had thousands of dollars but just didn't know what she was worth it was all hid in the Bible now that's a sweet little story my brother and sister I've heard people criticize that well I don't even think that's true it's just made up well I don't care if it's made up if it was made up and you don't get the point come on listen don't worry about whether it's made up or not don't you get the point hallelujah some people are so caught up just being a critic they can't even get the point but look at this my brother and sister he said it was real I'll just I'm going to believe it and I get the point it's all here right here in the Bible amen we don't need somebody come and kind of give some other interpretation out here we don't need some guy to stand on the mountain and say I've got an answer and we don't need to be mr. Santiago down there and in Central America that's got all these thousands of people following him he uses the message as the bait to get him in and turns him into workers on his farms lovely if we're gonna do that I've got an opening for all of you tomorrow since Saints nonsense we're not here for this we're here to get people to Jesus Christ amen but the problem we have is we see a lot of pretty pictures but we don't see the value that's a good story that's a good analogy that's a good dispel my brother's sister there's value here and it's in our Bible hey man he says now look at this I just don't know what she think I thought the pictures see money orders she had thousands of dollars just didn't know what she was worth it was all hid in the Bible I wonder tonight if Jesus wouldn't reveal to us what's hid in this Bible for us we're rich in His grace in his mercy and I wonder if he would come and call for us hallelujah look Saints I know I say this I applied to myself I'm not being down on you but I'm starting to come to conclusion we don't have a clue what God has given I'm sorry sounds like I think you're not spiritual I don't mean it that way I think it is so far above and beyond what we comprehend that we can't comprehend it God help us open up our Bible Lord and let us see what we're worth how do though your sister and me would you come amen oh I'll tell you my brother and sister I've taken quite a bit of time can I just can I just draw a look one more here amen second one hundred can I say I lied to you and I need to the Shekinah glory manifests him it brings forth the word of promise right out to you that's the reason that he had to veil Moses face because in him was the word he veiled Jesus as a humble little man to keep them from seeing Jehovah he veils himself today in earthen vessels with the Chicana the outside looks like a bunch of holy rollers old badger skins but the inside hides the Shekinah glory listen I like this right here and it ripens the shewbread that we can feast on and drive across the country for hundreds of miles see it's a believers food it's only for the believer now you know what the critics would say see he's saying it's only for message believers you just said believer it's up to us whether we narrow that down I'd say our four know more but there's quite a bit more than four of us so we'll just have to say it's only for grace tabernacle and no one else that won't fly either well look the western United States is a much nicer place than the eastern United States so maybe it's only for us in the West that won't fly either maybe it's only for the believer which is just exactly what he said it's for the believer remember the shoe bed was only for believer only see shoe bed scene notice what it does the Shekinah glory over the shewbread kept it from spoiling remember the mana that came from heaven it stayed on this kind of glory from one generation to another outside it got wiggle tails overnight contaminated is that right outside of the Chicano glory the days of miracles past see it's all fanaticism but inside look they got some sunflower seed they've also got some wheat seed I'll just tell you because this come up in one of my farm magazines here recently and they got some sunflower seed out of a garner in Egypt that was put in there in the days of Joseph 4000 years nearly ago Joseph put them in the garner they planted them they lived why they had life Alleluia they just did that out of Egypt there they found some other tunnels and stuff and in there they found actually quite a quite a little supply of wheat and they took that and took some of that wheat and this is what's funny because it drives you a good point home they took some of that wheat seed and they planted it and now they're trying to gene trace it right that's modern times they're trying to drink gene trace it because without it being hybrid it out produced the wheat that they were comparing it to well hallelujah I'm just going to call it quits here we'll just have to finish this another day look you can hybrid this message all you want but it's not going to out produce that original seed we can build it bigger better finer fancier whatever it is people are like well this church has this many people in it that church has that many people in it and I've been church services my brother and sister where there was just a bear half a dozen people and the power of God come down and shake the building so we can shake the building with our voices because we sing so loud or we can shake building with the power of the Chicana glory but a hybrid message will never outshine the original see hallelujah Oh hallelujah well forgive me we'll come back to this we'll come back to this and another service because this just goes this goes on quite a ways there's just a lot here hallelujah hallelujah well this is the evening time it's later than you the bride is briefing to me things already the bridegroom [Music] [Applause] this is he it's later than you think is free [Music] to me Oh things are [Music] my crew my team laughs and ears [Music] Amen could we say amen to that hallelujah amen I tell you I just love I just love this word I tell you I just so want to finish this this evening or this morning here I just can't hardly help myself but look my brother and sister hey I just want to draw this one part out of its also also other service unveiling of God the shewbread seed the word that were to live on in this day by these promises the Shekinah glory ripens that shewbread brings it to pass makes it bread to the believer it's laid in the pages of the Bible year after year the word for this age you see got some other things here where brother brems talking about that but you see it's been here all the time nobody's come and took a razor and slit the pages and did an insert it was here all the time you know that's what the prophet of God when he's talking about the opening of the seventh seal he said now somebody said well now you know that must have given you much more brother branham you saw more you this and he said no no you see that be adding or taking away from he said I thought maybe it was on the back but that wouldn't be right either he said had to be written in the word and it was there all the time Oh hallelujah aren't you glad well I want to just close this out this way we'll sing a song or two he was here all the time the freshness of Revelation was right here all the time and when the glory of God come down on the Chicana glory come down on the shewbread my brother and sister the priest went in there according to the time and the season they didn't lift the lid off and go Oh gross there's flies and there's wiggle tails and there's some kind of this and that the presence of God is the best preservative that's ever been given to mankind he said I will keep you a man I will keep you I will be in you I will lead you I will guide you from the beginning to the end you talk about a preservative now if you don't think so you can climb in the car with me and I'll take you down to the CD or side of Nampa [Music] that's where Satan wants us to be God said I'll
