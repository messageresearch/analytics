some point he's going to be coming into Florida so you know however it may be there it is is it it is chaos so just pray that God be with him and lead him and guide him I want to remember Sister Andrea and sister Elizabeth sister Erica and sister Zara as well uh the Saints in Ukraine and the Russian conflict so going on we still want to pray that God would be their portion and be their protection we want to remember Brother Willie and White Horse Yukon um I think he had his surgery okay they moved this surgery out to the sixth okay her that God would guide the hand of the surgeon

be his healer and the Saints in Florida amen they're all there dealing with it um and the people there in general uh sister Joel and his brother-in-law Thiago for salvation and complete recovery and uh sister akonsha has an unspoken prayer request so quite a few needs here this morning and I I have an unspoken prayer request as well sometimes there's requests that you would like to to say them but um in respect you just keep them to yourself so please just remember it important and unspoken prayer request Amen Brother David would you come this morning and take these requests and these needs [Music] heard them [Music] I was laid in your heart to pray for May you pray for that particular person amen let's bow our heads in prayer our heavenly father we come before the King of Kings the Lord of lords our rest our perfect satisfaction our peace Lord let us daily let that not just be a song a tempo but may we deny ourself daily take up our cross and follow you Lord we know that we cannot do that except you dwell in US Lord because you're the energy of the branch without you we can do nothing even in this moment of prayer for these requests we come on the basis of your promise we come on the basis of your word alone you said make your requests known among the saints as we bring these things before you in every unspoken request may as they've been spoken whether it's healing traveling mercies those in chaos in Florida Trouble losing homes Lord we pray for those we pray for those in Ukraine your mercy be upon them the Believers Lord you said you would never leave us nor forsake us you said I'll be with you because I'm even in you I'll be in you therefore I'm with you God I pray that your Divine Purpose and plan be done in every one of these requests continue to bless now yes in your presence may you open your word and bring your word forth as it has pleased you and will please you to bring it may you reveal it to our hearts as we need revelation because without it Lord we cannot please you now father we ask these things in thy name and for thy Glory bless the offering as is taken as it's given and Lord May everything we do even to the appointed time of communion this night may we take this in remembrance of what you have given and done for us personally identifying ourselves by taking that that we are a part of your life living your life here by your power we ask this For Your Glory now in the name of Jesus Christ we believe that what we've asked for we now believe is set forth in a word in faith and it must come to pass we expect this for your glory amen

uh I give myself away I give myself to you however [Music] you know he was praying I was thinking of one thing kind of maybe selfishly in reference to my unspoken request but just one thing God spoke to my heart is that my God fights for me no matter what it is our God fights for us whether he gives us the strength to say a word he gives the inspiration to say a word he anoints our prayers he directs us to a scripture it's still Our God fights for us amen here I am here I am Lord my life is in your hands Lord I'm long [Music] [Applause] [Music] in me I give myself away I give myself away

ever seen that song peace of God as we turn the service over to our pastor this morning peace of God cover me [Music] let's worship him this morning Saints you know he's whether you may feel him may not feel him yet but his presence is here because he promised he would be here Amen in your hardest desire pray Lord help me step into the Heavenly places we get Earthly bound but let's step into the Heavenly places this morning oh peace of God [Music] over me peace of God cover me through the storm cover me peace [Music] peace of God cover me through the storm cover me when you I am safe it's only in you I'm secured is only in you I find peace so cover me cover me cover me when I am hurting cover me when I'm not strong cover me when I'm going through the storm cover me when it all seems hopeless cover me with my faith is gone let the peace that passes all I understand [Music] cover me cover me [Music] peace of God cover me through the storm cover me peace of God cover me [Music]

faith is gone let the peace that passes all I understand foreign [Music] faith is gone [Music] for me hey man aren't you glad that precious blood of our Lord Jesus is here to cover us today amen it's not something we have to beg for it's something we have to yield to and there's a difference some people are crying out oh Lord I need you I need you I need peace I need your presence I need this the truth of it is it's something we have to yield to and when we yield to that he's already promised and said I'll be there with you I've never forsaken you I've never left you alone I've always been there but what we got to do and it was mentioned this morning we got to just break this Earthbound feeling because you see otherwise we can look at that maybe you got a mortgage or you've got a car that's not working right you've got this problem and a child maybe that's discouraged and you start to look at that and you just forget all the promise EarthBound Earthbound we are not Johnny Crow amen the chain has been broken we've been set free been given the opportunity to fly in the heavenlies amen Hallelujah this morning we just want to just start off my uh just reminding I thought it was interesting with Adam Sister Sarah are home from hunting and others I've heard the Call of the Wild and they are gone to the mountains and so we're thankful for those that are back and just remember those that are hunting or at communions already been announced I want to preach on the thought or idea this morning of absolute faith in the word now I think it's interesting this last song cover me when my faith is gone but you realize my brother and sister there's no conflict in these statements to say that we have an absolute faith in the word because when we look into the human element we think we have no faith but I'm telling you I think you'll say Amen to this this morning when you get right down in the midst of your battle and your struggle and your discouragement and you hear a song you hear the word preached you read the word and something inside of you says huh devil I don't know why I was just listening to you but I do have faith I am a son or daughter of God and the devil says whoa that's not how the dialogue's supposed to go but remember this is the guy that was given his position by God he did not inherit this position he got to serve in that position at God's Liberty and then God says you know what you proved you can't be trusted did you just catch that it's been proved he can't be trusted and he got kicked out now I hope just hold that little thought in the back corner of your mind because you see today by God's grace we'll just touch on this in such a way to see how slippery the devil is because he's come and asserted even so far God said I'll let you make a claim on this Earth is it being your Earth I'll let you make a claim that this is all yours but God's going to come one day and once again remind the devil Mr Lucifer the guy in The Tuxedo you know devils are kind of grungy evil spirits are kind of grungy but Mr Lucifer used to walk freely into the courts of God walked freely in God's presence and was expelled forever man kicked out I'm gonna get ahead of myself but I want to just make this point right now go study the message you'll see where brother branham's talking about how that they chip away the diamonds found in the Kimberly mine he specifically says and they chip that away but they don't take those chips and throw them away they actually use them for other purposes and then he proceeds to say just as it was on the statue of Moses and being struck did you know that could never be duplicated you could take a statue like that carved out of stone and strike it a thousand times and never produce the exact chip that came off of that as it was in that time and the prophet proceeds to say and we were as a chip taken from our savior amen unique and useful and every bit as much God Amen as the original oh come on let that soak in every bit as much God as the original I was reading a deal here recently and they were saying you know the problem I wasn't talking about the message but they said the problem with these people is they think there is gods and I thought they're closer to the truth than you'll ever know because you see we come from him and we go back to him God didn't go down to the great Wallgreens of Heaven and find you on a Shelf you'll come from him I don't know of saints it got me excited when I read that because I thought you know what the truth of it is is the devil is trying to put his brand on everything but Mr Lucifer's already been evicted once and if you are a part of God and I am a part of God we have the authority to evict him amen we don't have to wait till the white Throne judgment we don't have to wait till the millennial season we don't have to wait all these times we can simply go back and say hey wait he's already been evicted thank you Lord I'll preach that again in a few minutes amen look now Saints I want to get started here look now we find strength in absolute Faith right the scripture tells us that a double-minded man is unstable and in all of his ways wavering to and fro being tossed around by the winds and so we want to find a strength and an absolute faith and it's there in that position of strength is when we can take the word of God and we look at the word and we can say you know what this this is who I am I'm looking at the word and it's not the the prophet of God telling us this is you it's not somebody else telling you it's you it's you yourself the great mystery and we'll talk on the mystery today the great mystery my brother and sister is seeing yourself in Christ when you see yourself in Christ you come and say well where do you belong I belong in him amen it's not I'm a member of a church or I follow a message you know I received an email here a few days ago uh and it was quite interesting because they're saying that I'm lying by Omission because I don't preach the dirty uh you know behind the scenes stuff of the message and you know these things you know as it would be and they're saying you know that you're deceiving the People by Omission but my brother and sister I will stand this morning maybe sound overconfident of everything that I have preached I can take back to the word of God Amen I'm not taking it back to as it would be in their terms like a dirty word the message I'm taking it back to the word of God because we have heard a voice and that voice was not come follow a group this voice was come follow me amen and it was not a voice of a man but it was the voice of almighty God God saying I have given you opportunity to come back into your original state and step into a position that was reserved for you before the foundation of the world now some people say what at the foundation of the world and from the foundation I'll just quote the prophet he said it was before amen so we look at that and realize that we being in the mind of God we're a part of the great plan so look my brother and sister we're going to find strength in an absolute Faith unwavering in the word of God in our hour see this bride can we say Amen this bride is not double-minded she's not a Believer today and an unbeliever tomorrow and then things don't go well and you need something to happen in your life so you come back and be a believer again so you don't feel guilty asking God for something no my brother and sister I believe this word this word has become our very life amen as this song says I've Got My Mind Made Up oh I'll tell you my brother and sister if we're not in a position this morning of being able to lift a hand and say I've Got My Mind Made Up then I encourage you to find a place of prayer find a place of complete surrender get down before God don't beg him like a beggar but come and say Lord your word says and I want to believe every single syllable of your word I don't want to have one thing you know one time I had a man uh talking and he kind of well he went ahead and went a different direction but he was there going you know there's some things that brother Branham preached that I just have a hard time agreeing with boy I'll tell you what I had so many alarm Bells going off now I can tell you this morning there's things brother Branham preached that I don't understand but I will never go as far as to say I don't agree with did you know in the process of beating the dross out of gold you lose a certain portion of the gold but that gold is not lost forever because they take it back and run it through the fire one more time now if there be any dross In Me Lord amen I know by the promise of your word you will not cast me away but you will take me back to the fire again and when I come from that losing that dross losing that besetting sin losing that distraction then God will come and he doesn't always hold me separate from that original goal he comes and he unites me back again won't lose the one Hallelujah Hallelujah let's have absolute faith in the word today amen let's just stand as we go into the word now look today Saints Paul's letter to the Colossians was not only for them you realize that as we read this and and you'll come and see how I'll directly tie this it's not me uh pardon me for putting it that way but directly tie this but you see uh Paul's letter uh to the Colossians was a letter that uh was to them in that day it was something that it was necessary to be preached and and uh bring correction and admonishment and encouragement to them but it was also a letter to the ages and we look at this and realize that God so chose my brother and sister not by accident you know God don't never has an accident you know we just had an employee did a little something and tore some stuff up and uh I wasn't real happy about it I mean after all I get whatever's left over at the end of the year and one of the other men that's working with us in the Harvest was quick quit to step in there as I was admonishing my employee this man was quick to step in there Paul it was an accident and I followed I said that's right this man wouldn't have just went out and done this just to tear things up it was an accident aren't you glad there's Grace oh my but our God Don't Make accidents he doesn't have accidents he isn't the author of accident he's intentional he's directional and he is faithful amen and so what this does is set the stage for us to have a place to come back to Anchor our soul because how would you anchor your soul on a shifting Target God was very legal today I've got to be very legal he's very gracious tomorrow oh I can live under grace but the day following you're back legal again and so you look back on yesterday and say man I was sure liberal under the grace I've got to go back and drive this back into legalism no God's consistent every day full of grace but full of expectation of a bride that will take the word so as he's there this letter to the church Through the Ages is seemingly by name to the church in our day allowed to see an agent the spirit of this age and Colossians 2. he said for I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you and for them at laodicea and for as many has have not seen my face in the flesh that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in Doctrine I believe in Doctrine I strongly believe in Doctrine amen but we can have all kinds of Doctrine and no love man what kind of family what kind of church what right um knit together in love and into all Riches of the full assurance come on Saints this scripture is so full it is so full my brother and sister that it's just oozing out of it unto the riches so full Assurance has a richness to it and the riches of full Assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God and of the father and of Christ and in whom are HID all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge and this I say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words for though I be absent in the flesh yet am I with you in the spirit join and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ so he's declaring that you are steadfast in your faith even though there's times we feel weak we don't feel like we do but the truth of it is the word of God is declaring you are steadfast I think I'm going to believe the word over sir Lucifer and as you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving can I ask you a question how many got up this morning thank the Lord amen amen amen I don't say that as condemnation I don't say that as to make anyone feel bad but let's anchor that Amen in our life you know how we use this through the years well forgive me today I got up on the wrong side of the bed when did that ever have anything to do with life when did that have anything to do with us getting up and saying thank you for your word today hope thank you for life thank you for Revelation thank you for the Holy Ghost I remember a comment a man-made one day he says yeah I really agree with that phrase he said the problem is is the other side of my bed is a wall and maybe he would be have a right to be upset if he got up and hit his face off that wall over there no it's just a flimsy excuse Saints flimsy flimsy flimsy excuse what do we want to do is be giving Thanksgiving abounding therein with Thanksgiving beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ now lest I would jump on sorry to keep you standing but lest I would jump on and forget this little thought I want insert it here after the rudiments of the world brother Brandon Prince God of this evil age this is his world so when you're talking about the rudiments of the world you're talking about after the root Foundation Direction teaching corruption laodicea this world which belongs to Lucifer now I'm referring to him today because you see he was the prince that had access to the presence of God we'll give him enough respect of his office a prince who couldn't be happy being a prince and says I'm going to be king I'm going to rule over The Works of the most high I'm going to shove him out I'm going to have a coup and God says cool all you want cuckoo cuckoo won't do you any good after the rudiments of the world not after Christ for him to all the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye hmm I got so excited my office isn't very big at home but I managed to make a lap around it and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power amen Heavenly Father we just asked for the blessing on the word today Lord help me be concise in your name we pray amen you may be seated Saints now as I was studying as it were for you might say something to preach on now it doesn't that doesn't quite sound right right but sometimes you can have a whole of something and you just don't know how to deal with it you don't know what to do with it but the Lord is faithful to come down and to open our eyes and give us a direction and so we look at this my brother and sister going back to verse 8 beware lest any man spoil you you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily now look if you do not understand godhead you will struggle with the revelations is this your note well praise the Lord you mind if I read it you will struggle my brother and sister with the things of God what we would call the message of the hour you will struggle with that if you don't understand the godhead because you will have a conflict on where to place the authority at the time well you know what today we're going to just make sure that you get that settled once and for all now that is just anchored you see the problem we have is many of us had too much denominational uh spirits and talk teaching and tradition injected into the early days of the message amen because you see there was a season that there was a people that were called out and as they left Egypt my brother and sister they was all kinds the scripture calls it a mixed multitude and so the message had a mixed multitude and many of them thought the Lutheran Church really was anchored and so they brought a little bit of Lutheranism with them and they brought a little bit of the Baptist church and they brought a little bit of the Catholic church because these were things that were rooted in them and maybe help them or benefited them at one time in their life and so they drag those things over and teach those things as though they were message now my brother and sister I'll just tell you when uh uh uh the brother I can't even think of his name right now it was right there and it's gone but um started working on the message search and then they they uh uh what's that brother's name Neil havela when brother Neil had a revelation which wasn't really totally his Revelation there were others that were talking about this but he was the one that managed to grasp a lot of things and kind of get it together and you know I was raised up I just want to insert this to you so you can realize how these Spirits or Traditions can affect you and so sister Jerry and I not just I but sister Jerry and I as we started doing that we finally uh was able to uh get a a a version as it were of the eagle search program back then and there was things that we had been taught and God was starting to deal with us and there was things that we just didn't uh feel comfortable with uh things that were preached and the way the church was ran back in those days and we started searching these things out and back in those days you had to be very very precise in your wording because it it was a very concise deal that just it had to just fit in there you had to have it right but you know when things that you were taught and heard from the pulpit week after week year after year and you cannot find them in the message now as Time come on and that's been refined and is much easier to use and do that my brother and sister every once in a while I have just been like oh I remember that and once again almost like a reminder you type that in you search that it's nowhere to be found what is this this is a taking of a man Spirit denomination tradition and and injecting it in because they believed it and because they believed it so strongly surely the prophet spoke on it but that's not how it works we're not looking for something that was surely preached on we're looking for the word amen we are a word people amen so you look at this now I want to come back to verse 9 really drive this home for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bottling amen so is there anything in the revealed word that's outside of him he's the fullness right I want to drive this home he is the fullness there's nothing else outside of him and then the word says and ye are complete in him so if he is all the word everything of creation and everything of the mind and of the spirit of God and ye are complete in him now my brother and sister that means that what is in him is in you you were taken from that it was poured out as the scripture says so now I want you to see this if you are complete in him you will find that we could take a position and say well then we need nothing else but you see God has a program God says you know what I have all the word you have access to all the word but do you understand it so God comes and through the preaching of the word through a work of a prophet the prophets of the ages the apostles he puts this all together you might say collectively and lines this all out and my brother and sister now I'm not talking about any other culture or any other writing talking about English you don't want to be like Paul sometimes you know Sister Jerry will be reading a book I don't really care about what her book is I just want to know what the ending is and you can find that in the last seven pages but you don't know the story you just know they survived the airplane accident and lived happily ever after we need the whole book you can read the end of Revelation and see oh Lord come quickly and we can say Amen to Lord come quickly but my brother and sister that will not hold you in this day you need to be rooted and grounded you need to be anchored my brother and sister to come to the place that you literally will have the faith the strength the understanding to that day to say Lord come quickly because to the unbeliever they're not wanting the Lord to come quickly if they have any grasp and realize I'm not living it I never really desire to live it and there's coming a judgment day you want that delayed as long as possible it's only the True Believer are you with me only the True Believer that is standing there saying Lord come quickly the governments of this world don't want him to come quickly they're in their Heyday controlling billions of people they're in their Heyday that a bureaucrat now nobody even knows his name moving people in Nations like a chessboard and so they don't want nothing to change it's only the True Believer who's standing here today from the very depths of their heart my brother and sister the prophet preached it years ago we won't get into it because certainly there's some large churches being built in the message and I'm not derogatory of that but look at this the prophet of God says now if they believe the Lord is coming tomorrow why are they building these multi-million dollar Mansions when there's missionaries on the ground in Africa and these other countries don't even have shoes and barely enough food and big churches being built right exactly they're not looking for the Lord to come quickly no they were buying back in the day that brother Branham was speaking that the churches with their excess money were buying billions and billions in municipal bonds and things like that that were earning good interest to secure their future oh but brother Paul brother Brian said keep planting your potatoes yes he did he sure did hmm I don't want to get sidetracked this morning just read some really interesting things this week but so now look we are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power so I can say this morning my brother and sister all principality and power is in me some people say you would be taking too much upon yourself no I wouldn't I am in him he is in me I am ahead of all principality and power now it might only be the Little Kingdom that we call Paul nobody out there is gonna listen have I got that drilled down okay because to take this next step you have to be able to have that anchored amen did you know the word says that the fullness of the mystery of Christ would be revealed in this day amen right amen oh now so we can clearly see brother Paul that this meant this and this meant that and that goes right there and here's Jesus Christ and we see him for Heath but if you are only in that position you are missing part of the mystery and part of the mystery is sitting right here this morning this is a part of the very mystery of God that had never been revealed before and people say what are you talking about there's bride from every age but there's never been a bride from laodicea on the earth before and she's here now and this is the final voice to the final age sitting here today taking the word in and not just sitting on the word but the words alive and she's speaking it and she's living it she's declaring it and she's letting her life be conformed to that oh there's a hard part my brother and sister oh reminds me it was almost like a joke years ago man was chosen had an important position was chosen as employee of the year for a company and they give them all these Awards and vacation for his family and and uh uh uh certificates of deposit his reward all this stuff to do this and then they're interviewing him afterwards and they said so what did you do what did you do to be the employee of the year and the man not even thinking he said I just ignored all the company's rules and did it my way you think he ever won that award again I doubt if they come back and ask for the CDs and the vacation and the gold watch and everything back I can guarantee you he never won employee of the year ever again see in his mind he was greater than the sum of all that had been invested before him he didn't invest the millions he didn't make the company he didn't make the product it was just yes obviously he had good ideas and he had things but to come with an arrogance this is a point I want to drive home to come with an arrogance saying I know better than God if God would just run this church or run his message like I would have it'd be a much better message that is the height of arrogance the height my brother of ignoring all the investment of our Lord Jesus Christ before us we are apart and this part of laodicea could not have been revealed in Philadelphia it could not have gone back I I think it would have been so interesting to have seen the apostles awoke it would have been interesting to have actually been literally been there to watch the effect of Paul's preaching upon the people but I'm a part you're a part of this mystery amen not that mystery this mystery you're a part of the word that come to life in this day now my brother and sister we can do all kinds of wishings you know we hear people I wished I'd been born in the old west not me not me me and horses don't get along and uh I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to have to go back but you see my brother and sister don't let men place it somewhere else or on someone else right the word says you're complete ye are complete in him amen so some would want to present it in a different light they would be there I'm telling you my brother and sister I know I come across like a broken record at pushing back against it but the spirit is strong the spirit is persuasive and people are like if brother Branham was here and they Veil that my brother and sister if brother Branham was here because they really want to say brother branham's coming back he's going to come back and he's going to finish and fix all the mistakes that God made before no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no the word says that you Can someone say me because me is to you you is the me I will be the final voice with my messenger in that day now some people say yeah that just proves that brother Brown's going to be there no sir it's this preached this word that's been opened up this word that's been preached there's where the Prophet will come in he's not going to come and walk the streets and preach the coliseums and do all of this again my brother and sister no type in scripture for that so people are trying to point back to another day point to a different day point to a different solution point to a different way to make this happen so they have to present it in a different light they preach it as though you need something else and I say Amen to that I need more of God that's something that breaks Church Traditions that breaks the whole thing we're not going to go into Rapture because we attend a certain church with a certain pastor and we have acknowledged this or friendships or whatever my brother and sister we will go in a Rapture because we are complete in him amen not because we are still just trying or we hope but complete in him that doesn't Place anyone else in this equation there's there's no way it doesn't say you're complete in him Jesus Christ Plus naysayers of this message say that's what William Branham preached he preached that you need uh Jesus Christ plus William Branham and that just shows you the lying spirit that is on them no understanding no Revelation they are thinking that we are following the man like they followed the man and they got discouraged of the man and left the man but my brother and sister are we the bride of Christ can we say that we the bride of Christ are complete in him Jesus Christ we're not looking for a plus another Edition another deal but we're complete in him amen and that's a revelation they'll never get because they've never come to the place to be complete in him they never believed and trusted and surrendered and give a full gift of their life reminds me of a brother one time said well you know we'll never fully understand this to understand the word of God unless we go learn Greek and Arabic wow now some of you want to make this point some of you have a greater grasp I won't even embarrass anybody by saying what but some of you speak several languages I'm still working on English now if my spiritual state is dependent on me learning Greek and Aramaic I'm toast but God said huh I'll hide it from the wise and prudent now don't take that as knowing several languages is a bad deal hide it from the wise and prudent and I'll reveal it over here to these babies and when you take that that's even kind of interesting because Sammy speaks more languages than I do but that's not what he was talking about babes in Christ think about this now a babe not in their bad days in their good days when Mom or Dad say that's hot they don't go run down to the hardware store and get an industrial thermometer and stick it on there oh you're right Mom this would burn me they sure fire away I remember one time it was a grandchild and the daughter was saw our little son going over to the wood stove to put his hand on the wood stove and she's hurrying to get over there and her own mother said stop in the meantime the little kid whoa she says now you'll never have to tell him again seems cruel that you realize that's what God has allowed to happen in your life exactly right you realize that time after time the word of God has says don't don't don't don't don't don't are we all kind of regardless of nation Kindred tongue kind of the same aren't we sure don't do that something inside of us what are they keeping us from mom doesn't want me to put my hand on the wood stove mom's hiding something from me so what's God do he lets us learn the lesson oh you don't love your child you let them burn themselves no I love them a lot amen but I won't always be there to tell them don't and though God is omniscient omnipresent God is not going to follow you around whispering in your ear don't don't don't don't don't don't God wants you to grow up be a mature Christian where you look at that and say you know what I don't want nothing of the rudiments of the world I want those things that are of Christ I want those things that are of his word and so what does God let us do he lets us go out and get a taste as it were of the rudiments of the world and then we are their heartbroken Lord forgive me for what I said what I'd done what I looked at whatever it might be and we come my brother and sister and maybe the first time we touch it wasn't sufficient but God says I'll let you touch it again I'll let you be there again and I'm going to let it not be just me preaching at you but it will be by your own experience that you will touch the rudiments of the world and once again say Lord forgive me I don't want no part of this Slayer to see in world I want you Lord and then we start to come to the place that the devil throws it out and it looks so good and we just kind of do a litmus test is this of God or is this of the world and you become allergic to the world amen you know I worked with a man once I hope you can catch the point I'm making here I worked with a man once who had been a drunk alcoholic ruined his family just messed his whole life up finally got so low that he he finally admitted I'm alcoholic and he went to a different deal and never worked he just couldn't find a deal that worked so then somebody told him he says well you know this is a start of a new medical thing that they have here and so literally goes into an AAA type of a atmosphere to get over being alcoholic and the first three or four days this place has a bar whoever heard of a recovery place from alcohol law alcohol uh that has a bar and they said you're welcome to the bar and he goes in there oh my he was lost for four days straight but he went in there on the fifth day and he poured him some whatever it was and he drank it and then just a little bit he got sick and he was like oh man I must be catching a bug or whatever so they go through this whole pretense of taking him down setting him in the little doctor's office say check him out no you're fine he goes back that afternoon he's going to have him another drink drinks a little alcohol gets even more violently sick until he says now here I am dry for 10 years and if somebody opens any kind of alcohol or I can smell I'm like oh and he says Hey when the program's over admit it what they did to me when I wasn't looking they look oh he goes for this every time he goes in there he goes for this they despite that with some kind of drug that causes nausea and what it was is it put that and anchored such I hope you guys got your spiritual caps on anchored something so deep in him that 10 years later the smell of that causes his body to react and I'm telling you that's what God's doing to this bride in this day oh he's not making us super Christians he's allowing us to come to the place that we recognize the thing that blesses my life can you name what blesses your life today the thing that blesses my life I love and the thing of the rudiments of the world cause me to have a reaction that's not who I am oh Lord forgive me I looked I taste I heard I whatever Lord forgive me and then the word of God builds us up lifts us up takes and raises our spirit up into Heavenly places and God says this is what I'm doing I'm going to train you because you see I'm not going to take and change you I'm going against some of the culture we preach I'm not going to change you I'm going to reveal who you already are people are looking I'm looking for a change to get rid of this this sin and this is know what God's going to do is reveal to you who you already are God didn't speak you from the foundation of the world and then say well I'm going to send you to laodicea send you here and then when you get there I'll change you no sir he said I sent you there and when you get there I'm gonna reveal who you are and people are like I'm looking for the Lord to change me no I'm looking for Revelation amen because Revelation shows me who I am amen now look at this my brother and sister I gotta hurry along here restoration of the Bride tree I like this after Easter his raising he said go into all the world and I'm going to go with you as a living father has sent me and he's in me so I send you and will be in you now my brother and sister I'm telling you their Spirits moving in the land that refuse to be identified in this fashion and you say how how can they refuse to be identified in this fashion because they have no revelation of the godhead that's right amen they come out of religions they had God divided up diced up and they never fully rejected that they've never fully left that behind so they still got God in heaven Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit and they got them occupying their place and they can't reconcile God in them amen that's right oh they can understand Christ because the scripture says it Christ in you but they can't see God in you and they will tell you you're wrong and you don't understand the godhead well I'm telling you I don't know a whole lot but I don't think that God allowed his prophet to go on and preach the modified 3.1 version of the trinity I'm with you to the end of the world the works the same that I've done to prove that I was you'll do the same things to prove that you are now can we just take a moment this morning and just lock in on this are we proving this morning yes sir amen or was that just for the prophet no no mamas you got every right to lay this hand on your child Amen in the name of Jesus Christ and expect a full Deliverance of the promise no we don't have to run call the pastor you got to drive across town pray for my kid that's got a fever no sir sister you will prove that it is God himself in you all we have to do is have the confidence oh wait man our flesh just a second brother Paul you were doing fine until we got to the point I'm gonna as I said preach a little counter to our normal verb this morning you have to have confidence in this flesh that's hard one for some of you to swallow might be hard for the preachers to swallow this morning you have to have confidence in this flesh because you see when this flesh has been fully surrendered to Christ it's no longer you but Christ in you see there's some boundaries we've got to break we've got some we've got some things that we have come up to a point we bump against that and we don't go no further I'm telling you I have confidence in this flesh as long as Christ is at the helm Filled from tip to toe I have confidence in this flesh this will manifest who I am oh does this flesh fail yes but you see my brother and sister we're not looking at the Flesh in that realm we're looking at the residence of almighty God we're looking at a place he says I will never leave you nor forsake you do you realize that on good days that means he's with you and on bad days he's with you and on sunny days he's with you and days that you are sick or you've come across a horrible accident on the highway he's with you when you're at work and a boss is persecuting you he's with you right amen yeah and if you don't have that flesh to the place that you can bring it back subject then you need to find a place and say Lord please work on my flesh oh but he said he'd be in you do we believe the word come on Saints don't get quiet on me do we believe the word or not I had a temper tantrum do you believe the word or not you're going to come to the place no these are not being preached to give us an excuse to have a tantrum but it's a recognition that we are coming closer and closer to a full submission to the word of God and that false Omission is what brings on a Rapture my brother and sister it's not how much Revelation that we have of the message explaining all of the things of the message so perfectly that's not going to take you into Revelation it's going to be as we started this scripture love now look I'm gonna throw another one can I throw another curveball at you the problem we have as as Christians as we say oh I love the word but did you know that we love the word under a filial anointing that's right and you know what loving the word under Ophelia anointing produces the same feeling you get from reading a good book I've read some really good books in my life books that I went back and have read probably a half a dozen times yes like that book like the story you like the way it unfolds filio love for a book now you say brother Paul I don't know if that's a real thing because filio is not really a material kind of thing but you understand what I'm saying but when we have an agape love for the word of God 's own love for his word you realize God loves his word an Agape God love a Godly love for the word my brother and sister you look at the Bible entirely different it becomes a brand new book to us because we no longer read it as it were history or reading it as do and don't we don't read it as an explanation we read it because there's something coming the prophet of God there's some says something comes off that page to you oh God let let our reading the book be that amen so I prove that I was you'll do the same thing to prove that you are I like that these signs shall follow them that are believers not make believers but Believers see these things that I do you'll do it and vindicate that you're a Believer come on I I hope you're with me this morning and I hope I'm not coming across too strongly but my brother and sister you want to prove to yourself Mr Lucifer and this world out here be a believer not a make-believer if God says it say Lord give me the strength the wisdom to live that and you know sometimes that is really hard because it starts cutting away on the flesh and we don't like that just like we don't like abrasive preachers we don't like the word to be too abrasive either y'all going to heaven now we're going to pass the offering played another time pay for your Passage God bless you all have a good day today get in around the gulf while the weather's still good I heard a preacher online say that to his congregation here recently Monday get in a good round of golf this afternoon well praise the Lord these things you'll do what will you do not by a manufactured life but organic just coming out of you will prove that you're a Believer the same works that I've done because the living father lives in me it ain't me that doeth the work it's my father and it won't be you doing the works it would be me in you doing the works see now you go into all the world Amen and look at this I just love this I hope this quote affects you like it did me amen did I go too far nope okay otherwise you're going to to uh to form what's known to me okay otherwise you're going to form what's known to me as a bride see all right I'll go with you and I you will be chip not just not just take this figurative take this with a spiritual thought let my brother and sister are not just math they got converted to Christianity no sir I am literally a part of my Lord Jesus Christ not something intellectual in the mind not something that Satan can come and argue with you my brother and sister don't you love DNA it's such an incredible thing in the world of of crime and all this they solve these things by just even you know follow a man I just read a little article here sometime back they followed this man he was so careful to leave no Trace until one day he's walking in the park and throws away a soda cup they snatched that cup they get the DNA proves the crime that he did DNA it's incredible I'm a chip now if the chip is part of the original then every spiritual marker that was in the original is in you oh that ought to have us out of our seat saying thank you Lord I can no more be lost than our Lord Jesus Christ himself could be lost that God's word could fail I am him he is me Hallelujah I'm born of his bone I'm flesh of his flesh what does it do it takes all the fear takes all the fear I don't know if I can live I don't know if I can do I can do this my brother and sister I'm telling you what we got way too many preachers that are preaching along the line of those ten spies that went into the promised land they're preaching along that we got a good message we got all this but you know if you have a little sin I mean after all we're flesh we can't overcome these things no I'm telling you I'm a part of him and he was proven to be sin free he was proven to be the Overcomer and he learned obedience by suffering and I don't expect anything else than that I want to learn obedience leave a suffering out of the equation I want to learn obedience to your word Lord amen amen people look at the suffering part and say I'm checked out no no look at The Obedience part amen you be my bride that's me my life will be in your body this is just too deep for some people because you know they just get all oh that's this just like a husband and wife is one person you and I are going to be one and that day you'll know that I am in the Father the father and me and I in you and you in me what is it the chip coming back to its rightful position the prophet of God says no other chip could go back into the statue of Moses and fit in that place no other manufacturer chip could be a perfect piece but the original would go right back into its place you wouldn't have to modify it you wouldn't have to do anything to it it would go back but you don't want to put it back because if you put it back then everything we say oh yeah I just I was there that my problems it was God's problem now free moral agency still Reigns we still make decisions our part of this body we coming from Christ he sent it down look the body that we call Jesus Christ was sent to the Earth to be proved what brother Paul no the prophet said it that body called Jesus Christ that body was sent to the Earth to be proved this body a chip off the old block of my daddy was sent to this earth to be proved yes oh look at that father in me I and you you and me hmm I just love that Satan just gets so angry at that because you see if you ever realize that you're not you that you are Christ oh that's on the fringes of the message I know of saints because we've turned the message into just another denomination yeah right right are you falling over the edge Paul yeah I'm falling over the edge I fell right into Christ see the Oneness of God all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured in the church there you are makes them all one now help me a lot brighter people here today than I am help me if you have something on a line all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into the church and there you are makes them all one doesn't that include us is that simple enough English mathematics we might have to develop a new language here you see my brother and sister it's not all that was there was one the word included you and I were one amen well that ain't what the devil's been telling you is it yeah you got a choice today believe the word of God a prophet's message maybe I'll just be bold and include myself in there believe the word of God believe a prophet's message believe brother Paul or don't believe any of it oh no no we're willing to believe a portion of it that all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that Christ poured into the church well what is the church it's not brick and mortar Saints we're the church we're not done here now look the bride are one okay here let me back up there you are makes them all one now look now the bride or one tree of life thank you did I just read what I just read that the bride well wait let's go back to the Garden what was the tree of life was it a bunch of people standing around no no no no it wasn't a bunch of people standing around wait it was in theophonic form representation let me put it that way in other words like husband and wife is one Christ and his bride amen can somebody say it for me Christ and his bride are one oh that breaks the myth my brother and sister that we're a bunch of nothing that we're saved at Calvary and became something we always were a part of him oh devil we're gonna break your mental conception of the word amen I always was you always was and no wonder the devil's coming what is he going to do my brother and sister is he going to drag you away to hell no he's going to deceive You by you not claiming the full promise of God amen oh my oh my same thing same Spirit same Works same sign everything else for the works that I do shall you do also how long all the world how much to every creature is that right now look at that my brother and sister look here I need to hurry along my I'm going to replace all the clocks in this church with the slow ones got one amen out of that Genesis 2 15 and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and keep it so God gave him a job these people have an idea that as a Christian you're going to just sit around and do nothing are deceived the very first man on the earth God gave him a job amen and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat now we're going to stop right here Saints for just a moment you realize there was only one tree that we weren't supposed to eat from that's right and the Tree of Life stood in the midst of the garden God intended for Adam to dig into the word he intended Adam to be a partaker of the spirit and the life and the nature and all of those things were Representatives God he intended a creation with no sin a creation with no sin and God still wanted him sin completely absent from the garden but that's not entirely true because you see the serpent was given Liberty but if they had just eaten from the correct tree the certain serpent would have never had opportunity young people listen to me the impacts of your life will be determined by the music you choose to listen to amen right right the impacts of your life will be determined by the things you choose to watch people say oh my parents they raised me in a very strict Church yeah you know I mean I've just spent all your houses recently going through all of your videos and your books and you know right no come on dad well we're cutting off all the excuses there's nobody coming around here forcing you to do anything amen it'll be what you choose amen amen you choose to feed on the things of the rudiments of the world and it will produce the rudiments of the world you choose to feed on the tree of life it will produce the life of the tree which is Christ oh adults did I just throw this all down on the young people excuse me young people for throwing this down on you adults hope this doesn't hurt but adults as good Holy Ghost filled God-fearing people if you wouldn't eat on it yourself then won't sit in your house amen amen that's exactly or maybe we are feeding on it God forgive us open our eyes so we can see that this is actually detrimental to us amen these things are there because he commanded the man of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that thou eat us thereof you shall surely die amen now I'm telling you I say this a tad bit to be humorous I'm not very happy with Adam because his actions Eve's actions caused me to work by the sweat of my brow and at 60 years old I'm tired of working by the sweat of my brow I'd like something a little simpler but that's just one portion of the curse that portion of the curse we can deal with but how are we dealing with the rest of the curse how are we dealing with the rest of the curse now I'm not going to get done today here Saints so we'll just do what we can here for a few more minutes amen look in this Sons and Daughters of God can never be one with Lucifer right do you realize that Adam the minute he took partook of the tree of Good and Evil it made him sick spiritually sick he knew now when I ask a very direct question when we do some of the things that we do what is the reaction do we walk away from the Tree of Good and Evil saying that was good no we don't we walk away and sometimes it bothers us for days weeks months and if we haven't properly dealt with it years and God left it there so you'd become nauseated of the taste of that tree notice it was by his believers huh look at this Saints it's just so beautiful it's by his Believers that he proves his word by God can't prove his word by an unbelievable he can only prove his word not by unbelievers it's only by Believers that he can prove his word no matter how much the rest of him claimed to be oh I believe brother see if you do God will prove it so because we look and we see the others now it sounds judgmental doesn't it but I'm telling you if you go out in the backyard and I'm telling you hey how do you like my apple tree and all you see is a prickly pear go ahead pick the fruit eat it it'd be almost like saying I dare you no no my brother and sister it's the fruit it's the fruit oh no even as a pastor I'm not going to come here start going up and down the aisles what's their fruit what's their fruit what's their fruit I cannot control the fruit you choose to produce you want to produce indifference I can't stop you from producing indifference if you want to be filled with the Holy Ghost and say I want the very Life of Christ to come flowing out of me then I can't change that either because then I would be I would be in control not God and then it would no longer be that you're a chip off the block you'd be a chip off of the church block a man blocked somewhere no matter how much the rest of them claim to be oh I believe brother see if you do God will prove it so because we look and see the others how can we say then see it's by True Believers that he proves his word not by those who say they believe but those who really believe it's by his believing children that he proves his word now he had the Believers the old crop had died off talking about Israel the unbelievers who said we couldn't take it he let every one of them perish why every one of them but the Believers who is left Moses had been taken to glory and the unbelievers had perished in the wilderness and this was their children why was it there was something happened the old denominational Spirit come out of Egypt with the parents you know now to catch the full context here I'm just taking too much time but uh catch the full context this was the spirit that had took them to Egypt 400 years before they never got away from it never got delivered from that Spirit 400 so it wasn't just a journey out of Egypt that they took the spirit with them they had passed it oh parents young people Church they passed this attitude to the promise of God parent to children becoming a parent to the children becoming a parent to the children what do you want to pass families to your children that's it pass something to them that will give him Deliverance in laodicea not tradition of who we are where we come from and what we know and who we know but pass to them a living God pass to them the Holy Ghost pass to them a revealed word that's alive amen you see they could have done that just as easy as passing down from generation to generation a question mark concerning God's word amen hopefully I didn't come across too strong there but maybe I could just drive the stake home that we'd recognize we are the ones you say oh if they're meant to be saved they'll be saved sure go ahead commit your children to 30 years of unbelief and unhappiness when you yourself could lay a foundation of belief in the word of God when you could lay down a foundation that God's word is true we are weak and we make mistakes don't look at your parents mistakes look at the word look at the promise look at the life that's there it's our life we can claim this life instead we go on and we just pass what was passed to us because in the flesh we know no different get out of the flesh amen live in the spirit of Christ live in the word pass life into your children oh excuse me kind of strident there sorry amen see he let every one of them perish every one of them but the Believers who has left comes down now what is it a whole new generation this is a generation Saints some people say well um the parents had to have done something right their children went into the Promised Land you know what happened now some people take this wrong I'm sorry if you take it wrong God raised up voices in their midst and anointed the children to listen to The Voice no one told the children this this will come a day that this voice will lead you in the promised land listen to the voice now God anointed them why are you and your family believers and other parts of your family not right you were anointed to hear a voice and that voice moved you in such a fashion it wasn't that we look back and say well praise God give credit to this man give credit to that man my brother and sister Joshua Jehovah God had a voice and it made a difference to the people and when the parents at kadish barnia could not raise up and say Amen let's go take the land that would have been children that were there saying now weren't we taught wasn't this scriptural wasn't this the word that's our land and I can see that forgive me I'm not meaning to imply but I can see children and their parents don't respond they're looking at them oh parents shed Egypt get rid of Egypt let the language of the Promised Land be spoken in your house let the language of the Promised Land become our language and it was those group now I'm not going to go into all of that but the prophet of God I might have included that quote let me just move on real quick Hallelujah I'm proving this word by knowledge proving his word yeah there are to the Cross door and that was Believers Joshua Caleb that was the Believers they was the ones crossed over it's the only way God could do it now when the prophet of God says there's only two Believers passed over you've got to understand that God was looking at a dispensational change he was not counting the young people into this they were following you understand that they were coming to maturity and look how God does this there come an age where God said everyone older than that dies in the wilderness and that was because they were then under the anointing of a previous Ministry but God says I'm going to give credit to these young people now I was arising up under another Ministry and that Ministry is Anointed to take them into the Promised Land I I tell you what my brother and sister this would be a harsh statement but I'm just going to say it you look and this does not apply like a blanket but you'll look a lot of those that were with the prophet went into return Ministry went into all kinds of other things that went off got sidetracked now that sounds harsh because there's people that are in those positions that I love dearly amen but you will not convince him you will not convince them and neither should we criticize them and it might come across like I do but I honestly my heart I'm not but you see there come a day this is the word they come a day and God said everyone a dividing line right down through the message those are going to perish in the wilderness these are going to occupy the promised man now God judged as individuals just as he judges us today as individuals because not all that say they are the message or the message that's right that's right so look at this let me get focused they was the Believers they was the one that crossed over it's the only way God can do it is by his believing children you believe that all right his Believers was the ones that done it he used them to cross over with now I want you to notice he does that uh way in every age this is why I can make this I have confidence to make the statement I just made because he does it in every age see now I want you to notice he does that way in every age he does it every time by the same method he has to take Believers then in order to have Believers to meet that word he's got to predestinate it to that age you see it he's got to prodestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age oh look at that oh my I don't think you guys are going to take me out the parking lot and thump on me or anything so I'm just going to say it this is why my brother and sister we look at this message entirely different than preceding Generations that's right that's hard words some of it might be our parents might be aunts and uncles and whatever it might be but my brother and sister you see what it is is God's got to take Believers to do this and so what did he do he predestinated us coming right together with the word and meeting right there and what is it the challenge of the age now this is an interesting statement because I don't believe these words are just accidental it doesn't say the promise of your day as in to say our day is different than any other day is let me tell you young people that while your challenge you face in this day right now is a different challenge in one sense of the circumstance and never dreamed when I was a kid I remember the first time in school introduced to a computer and we're like ah this will never catch on now who who wants one of these things around you know that thing was like this tall the monitor you know and that big and had this big box that buzzed and weighed weird noises and I had a teacher in school it'd be over there going he'd go over there it won't catch on see if I'd have learned I'd have learned I might well well go there got to predestinate it to that age you see it's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age did you get did it get you oh here's another one I'm going to preach counter to you here if you don't mind I I just had a little Jubilee in the office amen did it get you not did you get it did it get you yeah did you feel it we don't go by feelings I'm telling you if the Holy Ghost comes down and moves through this building you will feel it people are like well we don't go by feelings around here what's that noise just dry Peas on a cowhide don't worry about it no sir you got no feeling at all you better find an altar because there's a Feeling there's a presence radiates out and if it radiates past you and you never feel it cry out to God because it's real I'll tell you how feelings are one time climbing up an organ there taking the highway going up past Detroit Lake if any of you ever drove that Highway beautiful beautiful place just a scary spot you know at two in the morning you know climbing up there wanted to check my load I park I get out of the truck I walk around check tires check straps I'm standing out there looking down on Detroit Lake and suddenly all my hair this is what I still had stood up and I just turned around I really expected like to see a human or something there and my hair just literally I'm not I'm not figurative I'm talking about literally my hair and if you've ever seen an interesting site that's a grown man it's got a winch bar in his hand running as fast as he can jumping in the cab slamming in the door locking it and then I'm like nothing in the sleeper now if something of nature had a friend tell me oh there's a lot of mountain lions up there if something in nature could touch the human sense that strongly then what should the presence of almighty God in our life walk into church walk out of church walk into church walk out of church walk into church walk out of church I didn't feel a thing something's wrong something's wrong Lord help us did you see it do you understand it that's what's happening today the predestinated is it he predestinated it to this by his foreknowledge yes when he predestinated Malachi 4 it's got to happen when he come over and predestinates anything to happen in his word he had to prove his word to be so and when he predestinates anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time oh I feel so fortunate that I I got introduced to the message it changed my life no God ordained you to be introduced to the message he had it marked right there on the map it's there amen right oh my brother and sister he knows that seed will be there just at that time he predestinated a bride she's going to be there somebody say Amen to that going to be a Rapture she's back to the bride going to be there he predestinates it by his foreknowledge see there's nothing going to stop it oh my oh my what time is it here oh my look come on Sons and Daughters never be one with Lucifer the Satan devil whatever you want to call it no more than light and darkness can be in Fellowship amen only be one with the one they came out of when you think about that think how rough Jesus was when he says you are of your father the devil that wasn't somebody whose theology was just a little messed up not someone who was the chip off of another spiritual DNA amen oh do we have one time for one very lengthy quote can we okay I skipped over some really good stuff there so the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ would somebody give me permission to just go ahead and insert a little thought yeah if the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ and we're a chip off of him then the Bible is a complete revelation of you amen no one else no other Spirit no other words no other influence should Define who we are because the Bible is now the complete revelation of the bride of Christ oh my brother and sister it's not some other Doctrine it's not some other ideology it's not some other Revelation it's the word it's the word amen it was wrote by the prophets Hebrews 1 1 and God uh who ends hundred times spoke to the followers by the prophets in this last day speaks to us through his son Jesus Christ which was the prophets all of them put together Jesus oh you know what we have a problem Houston because there's more Christ revealed in his own word than that one let's start over I could preach that a second time okay let us just read in a while we got time I believe I haven't got too many notes here to speak from if the Lord tarries why we'll try to get from them it doesn't take much notes does it the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to him to show to his servants the things but shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel to his servant John who bear record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw can I step out on the limb how well can brother Paul balance on this limb all things that jaw saw a prophet goes beyond the curtain of time and he's there and he shares with us his experiences and he comes back and he shares that and people are like that's witchcraft the prophet says you know I had a vision might have been a dream but I believe it's a vision and I heard the music Onward Christian Soldier and here come this church Swank it along sorry to damage your eyes and the prophet's heart just starts to cry out Lord is this all my Ministry accomplished but then he hears the sweet music Onward Christian Soldier you think Music Matters and here she come and here is the prophet says the bride from every nation dressed in their National costume costumes the clothes I'm getting all kinds of just inputs here that I just don't know what to do have you noticed God's granted me the opportunity to travel quite a bit there they are Marching to Onward Christian soldier in their Nation their clothes their and they're walking along marching I should say of course we see the prophet of God so skip back in line you know they got out of Step he's monishing them to get back in the correct step don't go watching that laodicean church don't go watching everything else just stay with the word okay let me go back here for a second the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to him to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent it signified by his Angel to the servant John who bear record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the word of this prophecy and keep the things which are written therein for the time is at hand he looked at the bride amen he saw you once walking he saw you in step he saw you by the word not by our flesh but what was our flesh doing getting out of Step and he didn't say you don't belong in the bride know what he do he admonished that Pride just get back in Step just get back in line everything will be all right oh God help us today Saints God help us today to realize the day the hour the atmosphere that we're in oh Hallelujah you know I want to drop back or just a moment so the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ amen the Bible these are my words is a complete revelation of the bride of Christ she's in him she's of him and these These are kind of Taken not verbatim from Brother Branham but in context of the idea as Eve was of Adam the bride is of the word now remember my brother and sister that Eve come out of Adam are you back to it she was a chip off of him amen this Bride is a chip off the word and the word of God's God in written form right so if the brides of the word and the word is of God then we are the word period you've heard this preach it's nothing new but ye are the word period because this is the age of the full revelation of Jesus Christ amen they will have to remember sing the song as we close the service today here comes the bride amen because my brother and sister this is the full revelation of Jesus Christ in the way he chose to reveal it not my concept not your concept oh my well Hallelujah can I admit that I lied to you and read one more quote that's right you're gonna like this one you're going to like this one a little story and then I'm closing I hope you like that sorry that it kept you here about 45 minutes plus there's a home Christian home and there was hey I told this to uh told this to this critic and in this home there was they believed in God they had a little boy there and he was scared to death in a storm lightning oh he was just scared to death and he would run under the tables anywhere when it would like when it was lightning so one night come a big storm out on the farm and where they lived and the trees was a blowing enlightening flashing getting late in the night and the mother said to junior said well now Junior you go upstairs and go to bed said now don't be scared go on up there amen so little Junior with his pajamas on went up the steps looking back about half crying we all know what it's talking about there we've done it he laid down and tried to go to sleep covered up his head he couldn't go to sleep that lightning flashing around the window so he said oh mama come up here and sleep with me well she said Junior nothing's going to bother you mothers you know how that would be that lightning can't hurt you he said but Mama come up here and sleep with me I used to have nightmares when I was a little kid I can remember many a time that my mama would come and lay down on the bunk bed with me and probably knowing that my mama was right there I fell asleep instantly and she would go climb back in bed I would sleep out the night there was some confidence that's it so the mother went up the steps laid across the bed with her Junior and she said Junior my little son mother wants to tell you something she said Junior we are a Christian family we believe in God can we say Amen to that we believe that God protects Us in storms we believe that and we believe that God takes care of his own and I want you to believe that Junior not don't be scared God is with us and he'll protect us Junior snubbed a few times mama I believe that too but when that lightning is so close to the window I like the feel the god that's got skin on it Hallelujah I tell you what I like to worship yes sir I like to live life and enjoy life with God Amen it's got skin on it sister Emmy would you come Hallelujah Saints what is this this is not a Doctrine for us to believe this is us being chosen of almighty God to be the very proof that he is here oh brother Paul are you saying Doctrine don't matter no what I'm saying is is the chip off of that can only produce that yeah the other side of predestination that makes me so happy God chose me to be him he chose me to be identified Mrs Jesus Christ he chose us Saints to express himself to this world you know I'm working on shortening my sermons because I cut this one in about half before I ever left the house it's not that we glory in preaching so much there's just so much to preach there is so much to share Hallelujah absolute Faith In The God Who took you from himself isn't that beautiful I want to dispel this idea that we were just out here and God chose to save us no sir God chose to make us to draw his us from his very being to place the very DNA of what a real Christian is in US from the beginning Hallelujah let's just rise sing a song or two amen oh Hallelujah he's got it all in control [Music] and y'all with petition that brother Jason does not get to go anywhere do anything ever again amen Hallelujah just happy the Lord's blessed him successful in his Endeavor that's a blessing but Isaac sister Kristen also successful thank the

telling you I'm just so happy right now I could just keep riding on us singing I see some of you rubbing your tummies I heard somebody's stomach growl it might have possibly been mine but I'm telling you I just get so excited amen I don't think it's a natural excitement because be honest with you Saints it's not meaning for anybody to feel sorry but I'm so tired right now all I can think about is sitting down but something inside of me says Thank You Lord because no matter what happens my brother and sister no matter what happens the devil can't take God's own life where God put it he can't break in he can't get it [Music] oh Hallelujah can you say that life's in me that life's in me and there's no way the devil can get in here to take it no matter what happens around me know what happens to me the devil can't even get there and you want to know why that's so and I can say with such confidence because I'll take you back to the prophet's words when he says if you get under the blood and stay under the blood the only way that Satan gets to you is when you come out from underneath the blood and if you're under the blood and Satan comes under the blood he'll be your brother that's how powerful the blood is hallelujah so the devil cannot hey man oh don't come out to him Saints make him come make him come under the blood Hallelujah oh thank you Lord amen Saints I honestly thought this morning I had about 50 minutes worth of preaching I will not apologize but I will say I need to learn Lord help me help me Lord oh let's just sing this as we're dismissed sing it from your heart you know oh for saving my soul [Music] and my grace salvation so rich and free I wanna thank you Lord for saving my soul [Music] thank you Lord foreign [Music] would love to see each and
