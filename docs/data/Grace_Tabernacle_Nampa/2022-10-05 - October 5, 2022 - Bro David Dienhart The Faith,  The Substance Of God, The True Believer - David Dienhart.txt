coming here to hear the word of God how many is hungry how many needs more of him I'm hungry I need more of him both his mercies are new every morning aren't you glad for that only just morning but David said I raised my voice in the morning you hear me in the morning amen amen how many find that true I absolutely know that's true amen I've never seen a day go by if I come before God and draw an eye to Him He will draw an eye to you amen he always keeps his word aren't you glad you have an absolute the word of God Amen it's perfect and aren't you glad that you have an inside teacher to teach you that it's not just letter but it's substance in you amen amen so we're glad to be here tonight let's bar our heads in prayer our heavenly father it's a joy to call you our father to know that we are blood related your own blood in US Lord your life and father we just thank you for the truth and that we can claim eternal life because we are part of our father and Lord this revelation Lord can never be taken away from individuals to know that you are dwelling in them you've given the evidence of it by revealing yourself and father we just thank you for this now bless your word I pray and may life be imparted May there be a true sun rising in the heart of the individual here tonight that's able to hear and receive the truth and Lord because we know the sun is risen in the body we have your name we are your name made manifest we are yourself and Lord we thank you that you have a body a bride that is yourself revealed unveiled so father now we ask you to bless your word as we as we speak upon it may you take these thoughts that you laid in my heart revealed to me and speak them forth in a word Lord and may that word go forth and not return and cannot return to you void but will accomplish what is sent to do now Lord I'm just a sheep of your pasture I have no ability as a man to bring this word tonight but I am dependent desperately dependent upon you and I thank you for your goodness now with expectation we open our hearts to receive what you have for us expecting to leave your race to a higher plane in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen turn with me to Jeremiah 29. and I'll be going then from here to Hebrews 11. Jeremiah 29 very familiar verse we've used this spoken this but I'm glad the scriptures become more real to you all the time just keep unfolding unfolding it's an unfolding the state the the the steps of a good man amen are ordered and the way of the path of the just is as a Shining Light that groweth more and more brighter and brighter clear and clearer and as we get more and more and more in the light the darker the world becomes because because it has to be that way for the darkness gross Darkness so the light can shine forth in this hour God purposed it for that way amen verse 10 29 10. for thus saith the Lord amen aren't you happy for that he really realized that this Bible is thus saith the Lord amen for thus saith the Lord that after seventy years be accomplished that's equal to Seven Ages that after 70 years accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word toward you watch the you in here in causing you and they speak into Israel but he's speaking to his bride causing you to return to this place amen their position their place was a land our place is Back to Eden amen positionally placed in Christ where we were to begin with for I know for I know I love this now remember it's thus saith the Lord he's speaking to us you personally now for I know that's what he knows not what he imagines that's what he knows I want to make that point I know the thoughts that I think it's his thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord saith you're absolute thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you and expected end then shall you call upon me you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart and I will be found of you saith the Lord I will turn away your captivity I will gather you from all the denominations and from all the places whether I have driven you you'll come out of Darkness you'll come out of it see because the book's been opened the lights shown upon the full revelation of the word which you are I'm just I'm not reading here I'm just putting that in and I will gather you from all the nations the nominations from all the places whether I have driven you saith the Lord I will bring you again into the position place once I caused you to be carried away captive so what's we're in that second fold of a threefold mystery of the seventh seal which is God in you personally amen Christ and bride form and now what's the next thing the Millennium Back to Eden amen amen and the resurrection the first resurrection opens that up for us because we come from there to a wedding supper right back in to our land aren't you happy amen you may be seated to me to Hebrews 11. my title tonight is the faith the substance of God the True Believer the faith the substance of God the True Believer and I could say it's part two and I guess you could call it that if you want to from last Wednesday a week and a half ago amen that I want to take this first the the definition before we read Hebrews 11 the definition the definition of substance is one of the definitions but the one that is stands out to us with this message substance that which has actual existence substance that which has actual existence you could say it's real amen it's not something you imagine not something that is an emotion it's something that is real and it's moving and it's active it's existent it's in existence actual existence amen Hebrews 11 let's see here now how how the Earth was created how God how did God create the Earth and the things that are in it how did he create you how did he bring the earth into existence the world's into existence the heavens is before there was nothing are you with me now watch how God does this because God remember this through the as we go through this that God cannot change he cannot change his behavior his nature cannot change what he did yesterday he does now he never changes his pattern amen he Remains the Same if you get that Revelation you'll see much concerning the word and the message of the hour because the very theme of this message is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever so when you see him doing what he did yesterday doing the same thing here today not the same maybe the same manner the same mask but the same person Amen in another form another Max another actor's garment all right in morphe are you with me all right now I don't want to go out to I don't want to go on these runs so I want to stay focused here I have a very definite focus and a and a and a in a context here I want to get across remember our title the faith the substance of God the True Believer all right Hebrews 11 verse 1. now Faith Revelation now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report okay watch verse 3 through faith through what through faith we understand now remember faith I just read you what faith was brother Branham said faith is a revelation faith and Revelation is faith you can't have faith brother Brown said without revelation amen amen and we're talking about not a faith we are talking about perfect faith all right and perfect Faith Revelation is the substance amen of what you have hoped for or what the promise gives you all right now verse 3 through faith we understand it's revealed we understand and this is what God's wanting to get across to you personally and individually through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so God framed the worlds by the word what was it before it was a word it was what he knew it was faith because it just said right here how God created the world through faith amen are you with me through faith through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear other word things that are seen are not made by the things which we see how was it made through faith by the word God's faith God's faith expressed in Word created brought to Creation now remember he can't change all right now faith is an actual substance faith is an actual substance we just explained that it's yours amen it's yours When Faith Revelation is given it's yours it's a subset it's yours amen and God gives you the faith it's yours nothing can move that from you amen all right so it's yours and actually faith is in a reality okay then Faith amen it's yours faith is the substance and the substance is in you made flesh notice it's something you possess you really have it amen you really have it it's substance of things hoped for you have it when you have faith because it's revealed in faith the substance amen and we want to speak now on faith a different kind of Faith a perfect faith that's a great thing amen there's really nothing else to declare it but Faith all right now he said faith is something revealed to you see it's just as real to you as any other thing could be that puts you back where your faith in is not in some individual it's not in a man it's not in an organization it's not in a group of people it's in God because God is the word so where do we find faith in the word amen now we'll come to that in just a few moments here foreign now I can't make you believe neither can you make yourself believe God has to give it to you now I'm going to come back to these in just a minute these little spots here it's a gift of God to believe not your faith God's faith your intellectual Faith might believe it fine but unless the faith of God is down in your heart how would it be down in your heart it was deposited before the foundation of the world that seed was deposited as seed contains everything you have need of that seed contains that Faith it's why brother Branham referred to it as Faith seed okay all right so it's deposited you see to begin with it's placed in you and so and but you can have your intellectual Faith might be fine but unless the faith of God is down in your heart notice what he said the faith of God so God operates through faith you know that don't you think you know that God operates through faith faith moves the word Faith moves the promise because it's the substance of it to you now we're talking to you personally tonight amen all right see your intellectual faith can accept it do that so just keep believing it with all your heart in other words a right mental attitude until God reveals it to you just keep believing it until God does reveal it but it's got to be revealed he said but until he does reveal it amen you hold it all right now I want to go back over here just a moment brother brownham said in the message um well anyway 64 802 I forget the name of it right now anyway he said is 64-august 2nd 64. see God in the beginning that's the first place remember how I said you're justified in the first place you never did it so God in the beginning when he thought of you now watch this carefully when he thought of you he thought of when he thought of you and thought of others like that thought of himself of being tangible so when he thought of you and thought of others like that he thought of himself being tangible all right that was his thoughts see in other words that was something he had it was real that was the substance amen it existed he is eternal it was the thoughts he just said of himself thoughts of himself becoming tangible being tangible when he thought of you all right all right so now he began to realize you have to realize where you came from because this will give you that perfect satisfaction that we spoke of you can relax and let God Walk Through you talk to you live through you work through you amen that's right and so he's so he says he thought of himself that was his thoughts that was his faith that was his substance so he expressed his thoughts amen by the word by a word by word he said he expressed his thoughts we know that the word then is the thought Express a thought expressed in this case it's God's thought because God is the word and God and the Bible said the word of God was with the word was with God how was it with God as a thought it was Revelation it was faith in him when he does that he's expressing himself to you that he'll never change that's God's way and if that's God's way that's his bride's way because it's the thought of himself you're the thought of himself all right so so in other words you're the thought I'm going to come into this more and more right here but you are that substance Hallelujah if I can stand behind this Pulpit long enough I'll preach it quicker all right now so he expressed his thoughts by the word he said let there be let there be and there was let there be and there was and after a while he kept saying let there be till the people said one day don't let God Speak let Moses speak so he said now he said I'll speak to them through a prophet through prophets but it's still God speaking it's still his thought Express and today the book's been opened the book contained names the book was the wedding certificate in Revelations 10 that's been opened to you individually the marriage has come the certificate was opened it couldn't be opened until the marriage because the the marriage certificate contained names it contained the name of his body the names of his bride the name of his bride right there Then those things were revealed in there and that revealed to you personally makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing all right so I'm going back now to this success this substance which is is is an actual existence and he said now speak to them to a prophet Revelations 10 as I just said you are revealed in Revelations 10 the complete revelation of the whole thing finished the mystery of God you the Finnish mystery he kept it hid he kept that seventh seal closed until this day at the end of the day at the End of the Age because that Revelation turned the corner into a bride age bride time this is bride time yeah laodicea is going around but we're not in labor to see it we're we are in the resurrection in him we have the Rapture in us the resurrection is is the substance an actual substance existing in me and you if it's revealed to you and if it's revealed to you who's going to take it from you you've already risen in faith by faith you've already risen because that Resurrection is in you what a great Resurrection this is amen at the raptures revealed in you which the Rapture is a revelation then you know you have a body waiting because you've already got that change in You by saying Faith right now you have the actual substance of the body change Glory amen how does it put into Motion in a word what's your confession all right so I'll back up here a little ahead of myself right here so now and so a prophet said a prophet and the prophet said there shall come there will be and it was and it was and it was and it was just like that and we could say today it is it is it is it was and it is it's prophesied and here we are we're living in it all right now foreign faith is an actual excuse me I'm sorry now the only thing you have to do I'm jumping ahead of myself let's I want to go to the church age book the brother George's book here if you're following and it's a red book the same number same page numbers and so on page one on page 164 of this book now I want to show you the substance are you with me I want to show you where you were you are substance somewhere amen all right let's watch this now watch carefully paragraph one page 164 paragraph 164 watch carefully now and see this before there was ever a speck of Stardust before God was God or an object of worship God is an object of adoration no one else there to worship him he was at that time only potentially God or other words only potentially an object of worship but he was eternal spirit all right and he is known only as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind [Music] yes she was she was are you ready existing in his thoughts actual substance you were already a revelation to him he already knew you he said I knew you he said in his word I knew you some came to him and said I've cast out devils in your name I've cast out Devils by the anointing of the spirit don't you ever look at casting out Devils to be in the evidence of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost because I'll tell you why it's not the we believe every bit of us have the authority as a bride to cast out Devils I'm not questioning that through not questioning the anointing but don't take that as an Evidence don't take an emotion take the genuine evidence of the revelation of the word in you identifying you the message of the hour that is the evidence of the indwelling spirit because he said I only reveal this mystery to my bride amen are you with me all right so because why you were always a part of him she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not where were you before the foundation of the world where was your name where were you existing as his very substance Eternal substance you were dwelling in him and that was the substance he and you is the substance now you're beginning to see Oneness all right all right now so the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal if you can see this you will see many things if you can see yourself Eternal as well as an actual substance in God you're going to see many things number one you're going to have a a true uh you're then a true witness you're going to be truly satisfied nothing else is going to satisfy you but this word revealed to you and how does it come to you by faith and how does that Faith come by the word by the hearing of the word because his faith is hid in the word now not just anybody can get that only are you with me only true Spirit-filled True Believers can hear the word the only ones that can receive Revelation is that the Holy Spirit must be dwelling in you you will never receive revelation of the hour you can intellectualize it all you want but the true perfect faith of revelation will not come to you unless you're spirit filled holy spirit filled the person has to be living in you an actual substance existing the revelation of Jesus Christ in you he said is what he would build you individually is church as a member he will build his body his church upon that rock revelation of himself all right and you can see where the bride is coming to Perfection why because the message is the Capstone message and our day is the Capstone and that's why this Revelation today we have to grow up individually the the the churches the church Seven Ages has grown up into that time but here we grow up into it into Perfection of the headstone Hallelujah and notice he'd been honing honing honing honing honing all the way up until the seals were open and then he said the the Capstone came and he had been honing it honing it re revealing restoring restoring those things that were lost through the battle of the ages bringing it back are you with me and he said honing what for so the Capstone when it did come could set down upon it and the two could become one so where is the rising of the sun it's in his body it's in his bride they're uniting they have been uniting brother Brown said The Headstone in the body has United together Christ's the mystery God revealed he said the body The Headstone and the body has United they are no longer Twain They are one look at this Prophet prophesying let there be let there be watch him bring out the Revelation that you're growing into Hallelujah did you get that all right now watch what else he said he never has changed his thought about anything he never changed his thought he hasn't changed his thought about you amen you can't be the actual substance in him and then up here being lost amen you can't it's impossible because God can't lose himself and I will bring you back I'll bring you out of that dark denominationalism I'll produce myself in you you'll be myself coming in Bride form which is the seventh seal revealed faithful Lord because the prophet said the mystery of his coming is the seventh seal amen all right now he said now he said watch this he said he had never had any other thought about it he he said about anything he never never had another thought about you he knows the he always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is God thus the thoughts of God watch this are Eternal they are real substance faith they were in him real you were real there you were actual substance in him and the only way he could and we'll come into that just a minute now watch he said these elect are not he said these elect are the Eternal thoughts of God which were to be expressed in flesh in their due season this is your due season this is my due season we are the the Eternal thoughts of God expressed in flesh amen you say Brother David this is too deep no it's too simple it takes Revelation to see the Simplicity of God it's not your mental exercise of what's simple and what isn't it's the revelation of the word that's why it's hid from the wise and prudent and revealed to bride substance in him that can rehear it because there's only one thought of it and that was the thought of himself the thought of you is the thought of himself being here today in this season Glory that brings his presence right down here personal that brings his presence right down here tonight right in individuals not another person the same person not another Glory his glory right down here tonight in this in this Tabernacle right down here hid behind flesh hid behind flesh that makes mistakes and upsets and downsits and and trials and pressures and pressures and pressures can't move that existing revelation of substance that lives in you can't move what God had in his mind all the time about you and through faith through a word he's brought you into existence because said let there be in your birth Let There Be and you're here let there be in your coming you're fulfilling God's word hallelujah hallelujah I hope I can continue to preach here amen that's the truth amen I'm coming to another scripture and I can't hardly Hold It Back you came from the same source the same source that he came when he was made flesh in Christ and all that God was he poured into Christ all that he was so you were already in Christ the substance of himself was already manifesting Christ he was already Christ and now all that Christ is was is poured into you so where's Christ Hallelujah you say what's happening Brother David the bride's gonna is taking a body change by step by step by step you stay in step with the word don't get your eyes out here this this garbage out here doesn't pertain to you one thing pertains to you keep your focus and ride on to the end ride that plank to the end keep your focus amen right on to the end you keep your focus on the end don't look around back here stay in step with the word you're marching out of here amen the bride's coming to such a Perfection right to a peak to a razor edge of difference is that right but what's the difference she possesses the substance of the word hallelujah the revelation that's what God sees that's what he requires is the token on display Glory the token declares you've come to the blood without the token you have no guarantee you've come to the blood the token gives you everything you have need of amen he gives it to you the token gives you healing it gives you peace it gives you Victory it gives you some it gives you everything you need it gives you your body chain the token gives it to you it's yours take it amen when you see where you come from and God doesn't change then let the word that's revealed and you speak that revelation confess it my goodness Hallelujah I feel ten times bigger than I am I may be a little guy but I feel a lot Faith muscles here I could carry that elk out brother no boat's too far Brother David but but he and me can there's nothing impossible with God you say oh but no Brother David we believe nothing possible what about you all things are all things all things hello all things all things all things are possible to them that believe have the substance amen amen just recognize yourself as a Believer that's what God wants you to see you're a believer not just a hearsay believer not just in word only how can you say your lord how can you say Jesus your lord how can you say Jesus is the Christ or Jesus is the Lord without the Revelation without the Holy Spirit In You there's your True Believer remember I'm talking about the True Believer perfect faith perfect faith all right now so we got that far let's go to Psalms 139. Psalm 139 15. amen Psalms 139 amen watch this now verse 15 now you can read the whole thing when you get back or I said when you get home or whatever you want to do but but Psalm 139 15 and 16. my substance my substance you see you could read the rest of it there he he can pass me he he compasses my passes my path and and see but look watch what he says here I miss bringing this out here watch he said that's your sub my sub yours the real you my substance was the Eternal you my substance was not hid from thee When I Was Made In Secret see made in secret hadn't been expressed yet but it's made in secret amen the prophet said the prophet said this about that he said over here when he before he read that scripture he said watch how this works God always had his thoughts had his thoughts for Adam always had his thoughts and I say what about you are you with me all right Adam as his thoughts was yet unexpressed Psalms 139 15 and 16 will give you a little idea of this and that's what I'm reading so that's why I said it was unexpressed when yet is unexpressed all right so he said he says here then my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought see it was the secret that's why this secret mystery of God could not be opened this full mystery could not be open till this day because that's you he kept it a secret Satan couldn't get to it as long as it was the secret in God's mind he could do something with it when it was spoken that was hidden the word wasn't it but in the season it had to be spoken in order for you to come to manifestation he had to express his thought his thought his Revelation his faith his substance in a word yeah amen watch and he said now he said and you were curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the Earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in the book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them but it was fashion Revelation brother sister he had faith he all he didn't Express what he hoped and what he imagined he expressed and made it into a word what he knew what you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world how because of what he knew are you with me how by you you were elected by foreknowledge amen are you with me he knew it he knew it it was in him he knew it I have to express this portion of myself I thought of you and I thought of others I thought of myself all right now let's go back here we can you can read the rest of that notice on 11 Hebrews 11 1-3 through faith God created I've already expressed that he he expressed it in a word that felt Revelation substance God did not change his behavior per see perfect Faith God's own faith is hid in the word it's always hit in the word all right because it's always by the word by the hearing of the word what are you hearing when you hear the word if the holy spirit's in you it's up to him as a teacher to point that substance of yourself in that word and you can say it is written of me because the word is your absolute you were a part of the word you came for the word you can't disbelieve the word there's no way to turn the word down so God takes his word puts it in word form and said in a season I'm going to reveal that word to you and it's going to become alive and personal and it's going to be your word glory to God the same faith in use the same faith in him praise the Lord oh my okay now so here we go put your seat belt on all right God's own faith is hid in the word and God and only revealed to his elected chosen bride in him by the Holy Spirit now I'm just going over it I could just bypass that Romans 10 17 let's read that Romans 10 17. I've got to hurry Romans 10 17 and so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God why because it's in the word and if you have the Holy Spirit the teacher if you have the spirit of Truth in you he's going to direct you it leads you into all truth glory to God and the evidence of that Holy Spirit living in you is that faith in you that Revelation is the evidence of the indwelling holy spirit in you you have an ear to hear the word for the season in your season it's quickened you quick and David said Quicken me Lord by Thy word Quicken me to the word amen amen you believe quickening power comes through the word amen the Holy Spirit dwells in the word the Holy Spirit lives through the word the Holy Spirit manifests himself through the word by what faith amen all right all right so so Faith cometh by hearing the word and have they not heard verily their sound went into all the Earth the words unto the end of the world for for what did Isaiah say in verse 16 they have not obeyed the gospel Isaiah saith Lord who hath believed our report who does believe our report brother Brown said to them that it's revealed to is the believer that believes the report all right oh my all right see I always hit it he didn't reveal it to everybody he Sovereign what he reveals amen amen that's what makes him Sovereign you got to all right so now it's not a faith but a perfect Faith amen let's go over here to First Corinthians 2 and this read here where I where I said it takes the Holy Spirit I want you to see this in the scripture First Corinthians 2 and verse 11. for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God so it takes the spirit of God to know the things of God amen just as pure and simple as that profit backs that up in many quotes all right see you can hear with your ears physical ears all the time but unless the spirit of God lives in you it will never be revealed amen all right so then the evidence see Hebrews 11 said faith is not only the substance it's the evidence of Things Not Seen and what is it what kind of an Evidence a holy evidence evidence that you always were in him a part of him amen see see he said then Faith as I said notice faith is something you possess are you ready faith is something he possessed what did he possess he possessed you the substance so he possessed it he possessed you you possess him all right not imagination you really have it amen substance that was in God the Eternal before the foundation of the world in him now you you in now in you this substance now in you in the season to Manifest this time and season amen it's in you for that purpose now it's a gift of God see it's the evidence the spirit of God dwelling in you it's your evidence amen that God lives down has that substance his faith his seed deposited in you it was always there amen amen now I just want to bring that out very clear all right now let's move right on we'll try to finish this up okay now the prophet here also says you see it's not a faith but is a perfect Faith built up in here in here the soul in behind the veil all right now the prophet here says that we are to earnestly contend for the faith not a faith but the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints amen so we then read Romans 10 8 let's go to Romans 10 8 what God saw what did he what did he see he saw he knew and through faith spoke the word and created the worlds are you with me brought you in creation what creation the new one are you with me the new one the real believer you had that laying in you to be quickened in this hour amen and he spoke it he had to speak out the Revelation hidden the word and when he did you come to yourself hey man did you get that without putting it in so many words amen all right now Romans 10 8 very familiar scripture let's read that but what said let's start with verse six but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise saying not in that saying not in your heart who shall Ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from above or shoe who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up Christ again from the dead but what say with that Faith what saith it what saith this righteousness of Faith we're speaking of what saith this substance what saith the Revelation what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth like it was in God's mouth and he put it in the prophet's mouth and the prophet spoke it and it dropped into your heart from mouth to Prophet to your heart and now it's dwelling in you the same word of faith glory to God you can't get out of God's Channel you can't get out of God's way of doing things he Remains the Same if he spoke into existence by the word of faith in a word in the beginning he's still speaking it today through his bride he's still speaking Revelation you're speaking it because you see your position you see your place you're headed back to Eden you're headed back to the original Eden your way is made you see your theophany you've already received and heard from your theophany therefore you have a body waiting it's no more a frustration it's a joy to serve God today this message is not just a a story it's a reality it's substance it's real it's a living it's Christ Jesus here today the same yesterday and today and forever in Bride form to finish the mystery of himself to bring you back into the original is Eden as a masterpiece family oh yeah Hallelujah God is family you see we're right on the very cuff right here at the very point the headstones appeared that that's being united with his bride that's what's happening that's what makes us so unusual and seemingly so radical to those that don't have the Holy Spirit dwelling in them to those that do have the Holy Spirit dwelling in them it's music to their ears hallelujah it's joy unspeakable it's re it's Reviving it revives you every day and you can say what a resurrection this is what a Rapture that I'm I'm already living in and will bring about the body change everything that God does is first by faith amen are you with me your healing has to be by faith and then it brings forth what the full manifestation of your healing amen do you understand all right now see it's an actual substance hey all right that's the True Believer the True Believer is an actual Eternal substance oh boy was that good she's the message oh we believe the message of the Prophet what about the voice in the bride the same voice that spoke through the prophet the bride's saying the same thing by revelation you see why revelation's so important you see where you got to lay in that book and start eating on the book instead of playing video games do you realize why you have to eat the book you see why you need to give some time and start Redeeming the time back to him yes well Brother David I need my beauty rest listen God will give you enough Beauty to rest in three or four hours what are you worried about having Beautyrest for that was for somebody get your eyes off of your flesh and get your eyes upon Christ which is the sufficiency of all things for you his grace is sufficient he will provide everything you have need of or you don't believe that word the word first okay I'll leave off of that let's get back to this any Christian I don't care the littlest of Christians can defeat the devil on any ground at any time by coming back to the word quit reasoning with your mind the Jesus didn't reason with when Satan come on the battlefield of his mind he said it is written Satan are you with me he was a man Satan is a spirit where do you think he met Jesus on the battlefield where is he meeting you what are you going to defeat him by the word the word you're going to defeat him you're going to he hates Revelation do you realize why the prophet said Satan hates Revelation but we love it amen are you with me all right now he said now Romans 10 8 I just read it the word is neither even in thy mouth and in thy heart notice its substance in thy heart in thy mouth in thy heart that is the word of what faith the word of Revelation the word of substance not just a word not you're just emotional I believe I'll just speak it no it's got to be revealed the word of faith amen which we preach amen amen you live it every day it's a daily living amen now now what if y'all shall confess with thy mouth confess what this word of faith the Lord Jesus the word of faith the substance the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart that God has raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved say from what sickness save from what turmoil say from what your trial save from what your Affliction saved you shall be saved Zoe or not Zoe Zozo salvation he sent his word not only saved you he sent his word and healed you amen what do you have to impart amen you can impart life to Believers that's what I'm imparting tonight that's what he is imparting through this lump of two bit two by four lump of clay he's the party imparting life to believers peace to believers rest to Believers healing to believers do you believe God does that through his word then accept it amen that's not a word of a man except it is the word of God and see what happens amen all right now so we see that it's in your mouth all right now now watch what he says in the third seal 3 20 of 63 Saint John 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt with us God dwelt With Us in flesh he was the word amen amen before I go that much further let's pick this up the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are so God's trying to get across he said and Jesus had faith in the word of God that said what he was the faith of God the very substance of God he was God do you believe that well she is him do you believe that all right the express now he said I'm the bread of life to come from God out of heaven so are you well I didn't get any amends on that every promise that promised of him brother Bram said it pertains to the bride because the bride is himself revealed the bride is himself that's a direct quote is and it's more than a quote it's a reality to me the bride is himself revealed so who is she if he's the bread of life who is she the final voice under her messenger she will be the final voice to the final age not another voice the revelation of the message amen it manifested the rebel the message the thought of God put in word for this hour spoken she's the manifestation of that word that's her position the prophet said is the very manifestation of the word he said I'm that tree of life so are you the bride tree is the tree of life it's the bride tree of his life it's himself in Bride form all right amen and the message today brought the peace right back to his side no longer are they Twain They Are One that's what this message is revealing to you individually bride you're one with him you're one hopefully you see this tonight that you're one all right now he said all these things that I am he knew with that perfect Faith he was the anointed Messiah brother Branham said on paragraph 55 a perfect fate page 27 and now we become Anointed with the same Spirit anointed Messiahs Messiahs of the last day to shine forth the resurrection of Jesus Christ to show token a token showing a token on display to show that he is not dead but in the form of the Holy Ghost he's in he's he's in his people moving moving brother Branham said he said he said I and myself can do nothing Jesus said but it's my faith in God not not Jesus himself not David himself but it's my faith in God the substance that I always had with him before the foundation of the world I come from that source and you've come from the same Source the prophet said who are you revealing the son of man again he wants you to see your position all right what was what was Eve she was Adam and what is what is her position it's so good to see ourselves positionally placed Christ in you positionally placed all right see it's not just a word it's a living moving substance a living moving word manifested all right the faith that was in the word is now made manifest and God was in him God was he said it's my faith in God in God in God my faith in God when were you in God when were you a believer he that believeth in me shall never perish when did you believe before the foundation of the world you were a believer you always were a Believer you always were Eternal you always were in Christ where are you going then if you always were and that's a revelation who are you and if you know who you are where are you going your your end is expected you haven't expected end you can see it nothing going to take that what a piece what a rest in the time of of judgment that somehow Plumbing upon the Earth what a peace what a rest to know we're going to be taken right out of here in us and and what's happening what's happening now now we see the Promise being fulfilled there's a a going of the the brother Brown said his going which he said was in The Bride because now we see that promise fulfilled amen the Christ the true headship going in coming in his bride now we see it being fulfilled he said not going to now we are seeing it amen and so where are we going right back to the beginning right back to the original Eden my faith in God assures me of that amen and God was in him God was in him the word made manifest and the word of God comes in you if when the word of God comes in you it's made manifest for you are a Believer and a Believer is see the believer is the faith of God that moves in you all right and now we become anointed the size of the last day he said and now to show that he's not dead the resurrection of Jesus Christ but in the form of the Holy Ghost he's in his people moving among his bride what's that moving mean Hebrews 4 12 the the word of God is quick and Powerful that quick and Powerful if you go if you have Scofield that quick and Powerful means living and operative the word of God is living and operative where in you brother Branham said the little bride today is the word living and in action operative amen all right so he said now so you see he's in his people moving among his bride with a love affair to her pouring out into her himself what's he pouring into her himself they are becoming one for the wedding supper becoming one pregnancy you hold life you hold his name you're pregnant with his name you're bringing an eternal child are you with me all right so you had to come in Union with him there had to be a marriage and it couldn't be a public show it was a secret coming a secret going a secret rapture all right all right now we'll just we'll get down to the bottom of this and close I'm closing right on time praise the Lord now Romans 10 8 I read Romans 10 8 to you brother Brown said in the beginning was the word the word was with God how was it with God thought substance the Word was God amen are you with me if the Word was God who are you all right and the word became flesh see and dwelt with us God dwelt With Us in flesh he was the word God's dwelling with us today right now in flesh not another himself amen all right before a word brother Brown said same third full third seal before a word it's a thought all right and a thought has to be created and a thought has to be created all right so God's thoughts that's you the substance God's thoughts became creation when it was spoke by a word Glory he doesn't change his pattern what about the word and word of faith in you now Word of Faith not your word of imagination your emotion the word of faith Revelation substance now watch he said here he said then when when that's when he presents it he spoke by word that's when he presents it to you as they thought his thought look at what he's presenting tonight he's presenting his thought to you and it's revealed to you all right he said then it's still a thought like it wasn't God until you speak it God has not changed his way or behavior Glory look at the authority we have in faith in the word all right see it comes through the word faith comes by hearing the word all right now so all right Hebrews 10 23 and let's Stand Together Hebrews 10 23 . let me just close this out here in these next couple of things I just let you stand up and now I'm closing I didn't ask musician to come yet now I don't know what's going on no that's fine if I say stand the musicians come so we should go another 15 or 20 minutes and no okay no all right Hebrews 10 23. let us okay let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised so what is our faith first John 5 4 said our faith is the victory is that right our faith is the victory what is what is he said he that is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith our substance revealed in you you always were Eternal you're born again it's a new creation you were created by the spoken word in this day amen it had to be spoken you see why it had to come by a prophet all right now it's in you that voice what are you doing with it are you are you giving it preeminence every day all right now hold fast now so it's our Victory you are his victory you are himself revealed Jesus could do nothing until revealed Saint John 5 19 it had to be revealed to him by the father that was in him he said in myself are I and myself can do nothing but what I see my father do and he said in Saint John 5 17 my father worketh hitherto at that moment and then I work why they were one all right the same Harmony brother Branham said pick up your pen and write the same Harmony noticed he was prophesying of where we're at right now they said this same Harmony and he prophesied bringing that same that what is the spoken word The Original Seed he was prophesying God said pick up your pen and write I'm going to show you what this bride is I'm going to show you what she'll do I'll show you who she is bringing it right up before those seals amen honing her right down to that Perfection so the Capstone could come upon it and only the bride sees its uniting time and it's and amen all right that sign in the heavens was a sign of the uniting time the same Harmony is to exist between Christ and his bride same thing as I said about Jesus I can do nothing till my father reveals it my father worketh hitherto and I work amen amen yeah he said I do nothing in myself why he relied upon what he was are you with me was what he was whatever he was he is then whatever you were you are now amen your soul reveals who you are the real you is in the soul whatever the soul you can you can have all kinds of emotions and feelings and be anointed by the genuine Spirit but never have the word in the soul yeah that's and I'm not talking about you people I'm talking about this General speaking here see see are you with me it's not an imagination it's not some man you're not following a nomination you're not following a group of people all right amen now so he said and he had Faith he relied upon knowing he was the word he relied upon what he was he relied in knowing that he was the word and he had faith in God who made him the word he was God the word and they was in him and that gave him Faith because he understood his position then cannot we rely upon what God made us as believers these signs shall follow them that believe he had faith in what he was if you are a Believer you have faith in what you are Therefore your headship is a kingdom and the kingdom of God is within you there's your Reliance there's your confidence he said I'll Quicken your mortal body and I'll bring it subject to the word amen all right amen now amen so Saint John 16 33 said in the world you'll have tribulation you'll have you'll have you'll have testings and trials and pressures but he said be of good cheer our faith be of good cheer I have our faith your faith my faith be of good cheer I have overcome the world Amen what is it that overcomes the world our faith amen amen Saint John 15 7 amen he said now watch if you abide in me in my word in you you can ask what you will what is you will having his his faith his name his faith having his faith Having the Holy Spirit you can ask what you will it'll be done then recognize your position in the scripture as a believer you've got to recognize your position as he recognized his do you love him tonight amen where's brother Jason brother Jason he told me that was a signal maybe not not quite that radical okay just comment down a little bit like
