[27:31] i think it's around 7 80 she will kind
[27:33] of try to find that out from brother
[27:35] isaac
[27:36] and maybe some of you already know you
[27:38] know i don't know

[27:41] with brother isaac on that
[27:43] for saturn this coming saturday the
[27:45] seventh
[27:46] and then we want to remember brother
[27:49] sergey and his mother
[27:50] uh in prayer that god would just
[27:53] continue to direct
[27:55] their path direct their way and
[27:58] give them strength give them healing
[28:01] body physical strength
[28:04] and just know how to answer know how to
[28:06] speak
[28:07] amen let's just remember them in prayer
[28:10] sister jerry mom jerry grandma jerry
[28:12] however you want to refer to her
[28:14] she's all of that to us so just remember
[28:17] her in prayer
[28:18] i know that gets lonely but just
[28:20] continue to remember that god would just
[28:21] stir her hearts or her soul
[28:24] and just keep her just ever present
[28:26] every remembrance of him every day
[28:28] amen brother vasily he's out in the
[28:31] in the on the road so let's remember him
[28:33] sister tomah
[28:35] in ukraine remember her in prayer
[28:38] and then also brother jason has found
[28:41] out that he's been exposed to some
[28:43] coveted work and that's why he
[28:45] decided he probably shouldn't i guess he
[28:47] thought he didn't know for sure if he
[28:49] was but he thought
[28:50] that's the way he kind of said it to me
[28:53] in the proximity so he felt like he just
[28:56] hold off for
[28:57] maybe two or three days four days maybe
[28:58] it's sunday or whatever if the lord or
[29:00] lord wills and uh just see what you know
[29:04] kind of so he doesn't become a carrier
[29:07] amen so and that's why their family is
[29:10] not here
[29:11] and then also um i'll let brother paul
[29:14] wants to mention our brother you know
[29:16] about
[29:17] sister karen's passing and uh i know
[29:20] brother paul has something to say about
[29:21] that and also about the brother hugo
[29:24] vega too and um
[29:27] and then also let's remember brother
[29:29] donnie's church in the and the saints
[29:30] there because
[29:31] and there's i i've been told there's
[29:34] about a hundred that are sick
[29:36] and there's about 11 of them are in the
[29:39] hospital
[29:40] so let's just keep that in prayer
[29:43] and things are and there's many i've
[29:46] heard of others that have passed here
[29:47] recently
[29:48] brother stephen francis in in south
[29:51] africa
[29:52] and i guess he has a memorial service
[29:54] this saturday
[29:55] and then also a brother from wichita
[29:58] kansas a brother
[29:59] i can't think of his first name you
[30:01] remember that first name
[30:02] um i think a pastor there in wichita
[30:05] leaving a family
[30:06] to end the message so just remember them
[30:08] as many
[30:09] let's just pray that god will just keep
[30:12] us strong in the word
[30:14] looking at the fact that all things work
[30:15] together for good to them that love god
[30:18] and hold that word forth amen
[30:21] before us in in complete trust
[30:24] because god knows how to how to do
[30:27] things just right
[30:28] he allows things but we just pray that
[30:31] god will just remember
[30:33] us in these things and them also amen
[30:36] and then see if i'm forgetting anything
[30:38] oh kristen nash had that request for
[30:41] brother carl
[30:42] maybe we prayed for carl and his wife
[30:43] his wife's out of the hospital
[30:46] but carl is still in the hospital i see
[30:48] you with pneumonia
[30:49] so we want to remember him i don't know
[30:51] if he had kind of a setback or what but
[30:53] let's remember him in prayer and also
[30:55] diane and i would like you to remember
[30:57] our daughter sarah she's also been
[30:59] diagnosed with covet and just keep her
[31:02] in prayer and then andrew i don't think
[31:04] he's had been checked
[31:05] but he's he's not feeling well has been
[31:08] feeling bad
[31:09] and he said that he possibly had him and
[31:11] her daught our granddaughter abigail
[31:13] has been diagnosed so and they never had
[31:16] that
[31:17] originally and uh so whatever i just
[31:20] know that god's in control yeah we pray
[31:23] that god whatever it takes
[31:26] you know for unsaved not unsaved i i
[31:28] know abigail and sarah
[31:30] my adult boy nathan are saved
[31:33] i can't call them unsaved they are saved
[31:35] they're backslid
[31:38] but backsliding doesn't unsave you
[31:42] you may lose a reward but it doesn't
[31:44] unsave you amen so
[31:46] so just remember them i believe god will
[31:49] and has to bring them back because we
[31:50] lay a token before over them
[31:53] and i know brother others believe the
[31:55] same thing

[42:56] man good to be here this evening saints
[42:59] amen i want to just take just a moment
[43:03] here
[43:04] at the beginning just to
[43:08] kind of speak a little bit you know we
[43:10] we see
[43:13] the signs my brother and sister of the
[43:16] day that we're living in and
[43:18] you know it just seems in the last
[43:20] little bit
[43:22] we have just had a tremendous amount of
[43:26] brothers and sisters
[43:29] going you know over passing on to the
[43:32] other side into the presence of the lord
[43:35] and you know i was invited
[43:38] by some brothers to be part of a little
[43:40] uh
[43:43] chat thing you know and in that you know
[43:44] there's just a lot of
[43:46] a lot of things that comes about and
[43:49] there has been
[43:50] all over the world a tremendous amount
[43:53] of pastors of ministers
[43:55] that have passed away in just these last
[43:58] three or four months
[43:59] uh you know you look at that some of
[44:02] them are elderly
[44:03] but some of them in just days
[44:06] or you might say short weeks before they
[44:08] passed away were
[44:10] just healthy you know full of vitality
[44:13] and just going and then
[44:15] they're gone and we know this one thing
[44:18] that we cannot pass from this life
[44:22] without god's approval amen there's no
[44:26] accidents to sons and daughters of god
[44:28] there's no
[44:29] just circumstance we are not that's why
[44:32] we are while we are not foolish
[44:35] while we are not careless we still know
[44:38] that things like coven
[44:40] now i was listening to a little deal
[44:42] today and
[44:43] this government official was saying the
[44:46] people
[44:47] should be afraid and so look at the
[44:50] spirit that's on the earth today but
[44:53] see we're not afraid because
[44:56] all fear has been taken from us
[45:00] but yet we have because of our
[45:02] stewardship as sons and daughters of god
[45:04] we have a healthy respect you know as it
[45:06] is we wash our hands
[45:07] brother jason sister emmy uh not here
[45:10] tonight
[45:11] but um i'm sorry to tell you i hugged
[45:13] brother jason
[45:14] yesterday uh and i think brother ivan
[45:18] did too
[45:20] uh or you know anyway all the timing of
[45:23] these things you see
[45:24] um but we trust more in god
[45:28] we're not fearing this we're trusting in
[45:30] the lord amen
[45:32] so as you i had shared on the church
[45:36] site
[45:37] with you sister karen pruitt has gone to
[45:40] be with the lord this morning
[45:42] you know sister karen i never really
[45:44] knew her myself sister jerry had
[45:46] opportunities in louisiana camp
[45:49] to establish a friendship and
[45:52] she's just a lovely lovely loving
[45:56] sister just always there to help and
[45:58] encourage and
[46:00] as
[46:03] brother tim's love affair of all these
[46:07] years
[46:08] let's not just pray for him for a day or
[46:11] two
[46:12] remember him it's going to be difficult
[46:16] uh remember him in the next few weeks or
[46:19] months and
[46:20] you know a loving family a church family
[46:23] there just very close
[46:26] and you know sometimes we don't really
[46:29] know how to express this because when
[46:31] you see someone suffering
[46:33] um you know you kind of feel like lord
[46:36] just
[46:37] heal them or take them home and
[46:40] still the the pain of the separation is
[46:44] great and so just remember them and also
[46:46] our
[46:46] brother hugo vega ricomi uh
[46:49] first pastor in south america to open up
[46:52] a pulpit to me
[46:54] uh specifically we traveled there with
[46:57] um my
[47:00] niece and nephew uh and with my
[47:03] brother-in-law
[47:04] uh we're happy to have you guys with us
[47:06] amen uh
[47:07] traveled down there in that first part
[47:09] of south america with my brother
[47:12] brother flint and brother hugo opened
[47:15] that
[47:15] and just a very loved brother
[47:18] and here again some health issues and
[47:21] then cove would come along and people
[47:23] are like sad oh this has taken him
[47:26] but remember this is all in god's time
[47:29] everything that happens in god's time we
[47:32] need to remember that there's not one
[47:34] portion of our life that should not
[47:38] be based on god's time
[47:41] amen i know when we go to rush things in
[47:44] our life
[47:45] uh we can look back and say lord i wish
[47:47] i'd have been on your time
[47:49] instead of my own so remember uh their
[47:52] family
[47:52] um uh just the little church there they
[47:56] do have a minister brother that has been
[47:58] very faithful
[48:00] uh in lifting up the saints there and uh
[48:03] freidy and so
[48:07] just remember brother hugo's family and
[48:09] the church also
[48:10] amen i'd like to speak to you tonight on
[48:14] the wisdom
[48:14] of the prudent and it's kind of funny
[48:17] because we were talking about we were
[48:19] joking a little bit with the brothers
[48:21] about part whatever thank you sister
[48:22] ruth
[48:23] about part whatever and uh so i just
[48:26] left off the age-old proverbs tonight
[48:28] just to break that up a little bit
[48:30] there's no part
[48:30] anything here and uh so we're just gonna
[48:34] talk tonight for a few minutes on the
[48:36] wisdom of the prudent
[48:37] and so i want you to look as we come
[48:40] into this scripture you're gonna find
[48:42] what would be seemingly a paradox of the
[48:45] words and
[48:46] so we have to remember as brother
[48:49] branham brought it out
[48:51] the rain falls on the just and the
[48:54] unjust
[48:55] and so we look at this and whatever is
[48:58] you might say an attribute of the bride
[49:00] you're going to find very
[49:02] similar attributes in the world today
[49:05] you will find people that don't even
[49:07] claim to be christians that live
[49:09] very very very moral lives
[49:12] and raise their kids without television
[49:14] without rock and roll without these
[49:16] things
[49:17] but you see my brother and sister it's
[49:18] not just us living a good life
[49:21] it's not just our goal because as it
[49:23] would be somebody can satisfy that
[49:25] but what we are here is the
[49:28] manifestation of jesus
[49:30] christ in the day that we live that's
[49:33] what we were called for saints not just
[49:35] to live good moral lives because you can
[49:38] find
[49:38] as i've jokingly shared about carrie the
[49:41] hippie
[49:42] that sister jerry and i knew years ago
[49:44] right i'm just sure she has to be a
[49:45] christian she's got long hair
[49:47] always wears dresses but she's just like
[49:50] i'm sorry to disappoint you
[49:52] i'm just a hippie and so you know here
[49:55] she is a modest hippie because not all
[49:57] hippies are modest
[49:59] right so you know probably the majority
[50:02] of hippies are not modest but
[50:04] here is a lady that that just something
[50:06] in her this is
[50:07] what she manifested that did not make
[50:09] her a christian
[50:11] that did not mean that she was on the
[50:13] right track in life
[50:15] and so uh and in fact i'll put it the
[50:17] other way often times satan likes to
[50:19] come in to the very bride of christ
[50:22] and tempt us to let down our standard
[50:25] because he knows by getting us to lower
[50:28] our standard then
[50:29] that he has access to to our life
[50:32] in a in a greater fashion and so um
[50:35] oh i i have right here i just want to
[50:37] put this out now i think i have this
[50:39] correct
[50:40] uh sister sarah you guys are having a
[50:43] fellowship at your house
[50:44] saturday afternoon is it five five
[50:47] o'clock and then
[50:48] i know there was another i got confused
[50:50] about this reason i wanted to bring
[50:52] clarity to you i believe there's another
[50:54] fellowship on sunday afternoon and i'm
[50:57] not sure where that's at
[51:00] so it's somewhere
[51:04] anyway so there is a sunday fellowship
[51:06] so let's not get the two confused as
[51:08] brother paul did
[51:09] so anyway let's just stand up my brother
[51:12] and sister and we'll go into the word
[51:14] tonight
[51:14] and i will find tonight we'll be dealing
[51:17] with both sides
[51:19] of the prudent we will look at this from
[51:21] both
[51:22] angles tonight uh and uh both of them
[51:25] from the scripture uh and so as we look
[51:28] let's just go to uh
[51:29] proverbs uh chapter 14. now this is a
[51:32] scripture i used in just a
[51:34] couple services back uh but i wanted to
[51:37] drive home as we're just looking at this
[51:40] from
[51:40] the position of wisdom and the prudent
[51:44] uh proverbs 14 8 the wisdom of the
[51:47] prudent
[51:48] is to understand his way
[51:52] now my brother and sister this isn't
[51:53] necessarily declaring
[51:55] a man filled with the holy ghost but you
[51:59] will find
[52:00] that when we come in the presence of god
[52:02] and he starts to change our life
[52:05] we become prudent we become because you
[52:08] see the word prudent means
[52:10] careful in his way or concern of the
[52:13] future
[52:14] so when we get closer to god
[52:18] we become more and more prudent with our
[52:20] lives
[52:21] we do not make irrational decisions
[52:25] to come back to fix them see that's why
[52:28] some of our trials that we're facing
[52:30] are as god's knocking can i put it this
[52:33] way
[52:33] sounds kind of almost irreverent but
[52:36] god's knocking the nonsense
[52:38] out of us amen
[52:41] the wisdom of the prudent is to
[52:43] understand his way but the folly of
[52:45] fools
[52:45] is deceit fools make a mock
[52:48] at sin i think my brother and sister we
[52:52] live in a world
[52:53] full of fools
[52:56] but among the righteous there is favor
[53:00] now i i'm not going to come back and
[53:01] make great emphasis on that so i just
[53:03] hold you for a moment
[53:04] is this not true do we not find
[53:08] favor in the sight of god
[53:12] look around our life my brother and
[53:13] sister you say but i i we labor we work
[53:16] hard we
[53:16] this we that we you know maybe have to
[53:19] mind every penny
[53:20] in our budget and we have to i'm sorry
[53:24] you just stop and look around you look
[53:27] at your background look at your nature
[53:29] look at the world you're living in
[53:31] and you'll realize very quickly we have
[53:34] found favor in the eyes of god
[53:39] the heart knoweth his own bitterness and
[53:42] a stranger
[53:43] doth not inter metal with his joy
[53:47] the house of the wicked shall be
[53:49] overthrown but the tabernacle of the
[53:51] upright
[53:52] shall flourish there is a way which
[53:55] seemeth right
[53:56] unto a man but the end thereof are the
[53:58] waves
[53:59] of death lord we ask for your blessings
[54:02] tonight upon your word
[54:03] father for every brother every sister
[54:05] every need father we just ask you
[54:08] come father for you are ever present
[54:10] help in the time of trouble
[54:12] and lord we know that you are our
[54:14] provider
[54:15] we commit these things to you in the
[54:17] name of jesus christ
[54:19] amen you may be seated now prudent is
[54:23] someone who has or shows good
[54:25] careful judgment now my brother and
[54:28] sister i think it's good
[54:29] that we could uh uh that we could know
[54:33] you know sometimes in life
[54:35] uh we have question marks we have things
[54:38] that
[54:39] uh we look out and say lord i i don't
[54:41] know
[54:42] exactly what direction to go i don't
[54:44] know exactly
[54:46] you know to to do this and and you know
[54:49] just having this conversation
[54:50] recently sometimes we're like do a a job
[54:53] do i do this or do i do that you see
[54:57] it it's always just great in the natural
[55:00] let's just look at it for a moment from
[55:01] the natural isn't it no
[55:03] nice to just know to what right thing to
[55:06] do just to do it you know you go and
[55:08] i just know this is what is what i need
[55:10] to do
[55:11] and so you know in that uh oftentimes we
[55:14] do have you might say the green light
[55:16] where we just simply know uh this is
[55:18] what i need to do
[55:20] uh and it's good because uh when we can
[55:23] step in that realm and operate without a
[55:26] doubt
[55:27] you know doubt is like a drain uh upon
[55:30] your spirit
[55:31] doubt is uh and i'm not talking about
[55:33] doubt as in doubting your
[55:34] your faith i'm talking about you know am
[55:36] i doing the right thing
[55:38] you know almost like you know going to
[55:40] buy a car saying
[55:42] you look at the car and should i shall i
[55:44] commit myself do i really want to
[55:47] you know spend uh i'm from way back so
[55:50] you guys will have to forgive me but do
[55:52] i want to spend you know 250
[55:54] a month that's the one no radio no
[55:56] bumpers no headliner
[55:57] uh do i do i want to do that see and
[55:59] when you go into that with a doubt
[56:02] when you go in there to a question mark
[56:04] you'll ask
[56:05] actually find you've sowed the seed of
[56:07] buyer's remorse
[56:08] right because you're going to go home
[56:10] and the doubt has not been
[56:11] erased but let's just for this scenario
[56:14] take this you know you've budgeted
[56:16] you've saved you you have done all the
[56:18] right things and
[56:19] literally you're looking for a ten
[56:21] thousand dollar car and you have
[56:23] ten thousand dollars and so you go and
[56:25] you find the car with low miles it
[56:28] turned out to be
[56:29] you know mom's car and she just didn't
[56:31] drive much and
[56:32] it's had maintenance done and everything
[56:34] is perfect
[56:35] perfect tires and brakes and upholstery
[56:38] and paint
[56:38] and and you're like this is the car and
[56:41] and you have no problem
[56:42] just stepping into that situation and so
[56:45] when we can
[56:46] eliminate as it were the doubt in our
[56:49] life
[56:49] when we can step beyond that now my
[56:52] brother and sister
[56:53] having said that i want you to
[56:54] understand that there's a certain amount
[56:56] of the things of life that we're always
[56:58] going to
[56:59] face uh that is going to have a second
[57:02] guess you might say a little
[57:04] question mark or something associated
[57:06] with it but
[57:07] you know to go here into the spiritual
[57:09] realm
[57:10] it is good to know without a doubt where
[57:13] we stand
[57:14] amen it's good to know that when we are
[57:17] moving
[57:17] forward and we read in the word and it
[57:20] shows us that every promise in this
[57:23] book is mine that you don't have any
[57:25] doubt that you can reach out and take a
[57:27] holds of that promise
[57:28] and god will honor that now very very
[57:32] uh multitude of places brother branham
[57:34] talks about this he says now
[57:36] when we have met all the qualifications
[57:40] so my brother and sister there is a
[57:42] requirement on god's part
[57:44] that we can't just randomly live some
[57:46] sloppy life
[57:47] and come in and just claim all these
[57:49] promises of god
[57:50] in fact brother branham kind of invites
[57:53] a bunch of pentecostal preachers
[57:54] for having sloppy pulpits and then
[57:57] questioning why god is not moving in the
[57:59] midst of the church
[58:01] and so there is a certain qualification
[58:03] or quantifying
[58:04] that god requires amen but i want to put
[58:07] this
[58:08] thought to you tonight and and please
[58:09] don't take this as a die hard i just
[58:11] want to stir
[58:12] your thinking i think it might be good
[58:15] if we would
[58:16] pray for understanding just as much as
[58:19] we pray
[58:20] for results
[58:27] you see sometimes we ask god i put my
[58:31] hand up first so nobody will be
[58:32] embarrassed about where we're going here
[58:34] we want god to do this on this day in
[58:37] this way
[58:39] hey that almost rhymed
[58:43] and then it doesn't happen that way and
[58:45] then we start to doubt
[58:46] but you see what it is is we we were
[58:49] trying to prescribe to god
[58:51] what his will would be what his desire
[58:55] to us would be and because we approach
[58:58] the promises of god
[59:00] from our natural way because we are
[59:03] human then we would be looking at the
[59:05] promise and we
[59:07] say this is what god must have meant
[59:11] he said i'll be your provider
[59:15] now i hope you don't mind a little humor
[59:17] tonight but it would be lord's my
[59:18] provider do i want a
[59:20] blue or a gray escalade
[59:24] maybe god says i'm just going to give
[59:26] you wheels so you don't walk
[59:33] but you see we're disappointed when it
[59:35] doesn't work out
[59:41] so to pray for understanding my brother
[59:43] and sister would be for
[59:44] us to be into the very mind and spirit
[59:48] of
[59:48] god to be praying saying lord thy
[59:51] will be done lord thy will
[59:54] not my will father i want to get in and
[59:57] understand lord
[59:59] what it is you want for me and my
[1:00:01] brother and sister look at the
[1:00:02] confidence that we walk
[1:00:04] in when we are in the will of god when
[1:00:06] the scripture says
[1:00:08] that he that doesn't have condemnation
[1:00:10] amen
[1:00:11] is god an unlimited outlet of the power
[1:00:14] of almighty god
[1:00:15] but satan comes and he looks at us and
[1:00:17] says i can limit him here and i can let
[1:00:20] him
[1:00:20] limit them here and here and here and by
[1:00:23] the time he's done with his limiting
[1:00:25] effect
[1:00:26] we my brother and sister come to church
[1:00:28] downtrodden i don't know i thought this
[1:00:29] is what i thought this i thought that
[1:00:31] but if we can get into the realm where
[1:00:34] we have
[1:00:34] the mind of god when we can walk
[1:00:38] in the realm that we can look at the
[1:00:39] scripture and say even though i have to
[1:00:42] say ouch
[1:00:43] tonight this is the truth and i'm going
[1:00:45] to live it
[1:00:47] amen and so then we come into and
[1:00:50] the understanding of what it is god
[1:00:52] desires for us
[1:00:54] now this goes much deeper than we'll
[1:00:56] touch tonight but my brother and sister
[1:00:58] we cannot fully grasp the authority that
[1:01:01] god has given us
[1:01:03] until we come to an understanding of the
[1:01:06] authority
[1:01:08] we can't randomly just say well i'm
[1:01:10] going to claim this
[1:01:12] in the name of jesus christ why are you
[1:01:14] claiming it
[1:01:16] what is the reason you're claiming it
[1:01:19] that's why oftentimes i hope you can
[1:01:20] understand
[1:01:21] so i just want to touch this just a
[1:01:23] little bit you can come sometimes and
[1:01:25] you can lay hands
[1:01:26] and pray for someone else and god will
[1:01:29] move
[1:01:30] and answer that prayer and you know for
[1:01:33] a fact that
[1:01:34] god answered the prayer in the way you
[1:01:36] prayed it you know that you were a part
[1:01:38] of what god just did
[1:01:40] but yet we will pray over things in our
[1:01:42] life you will find this in brother
[1:01:43] branham's own sickness in his own body
[1:01:45] he's praying for people they're being
[1:01:47] healed and he's claiming this
[1:01:49] and then suffering through this sickness
[1:01:52] my brother and sister you see what god
[1:01:54] is doing sometimes
[1:01:55] is he is allowing you to be a channel
[1:01:58] but
[1:01:58] we don't fully understand the whole
[1:02:00] equation and it's not just
[1:02:02] us we abide our faith with one another
[1:02:06] but remember the prophet of god taught
[1:02:08] that when they come see it's not my
[1:02:09] faith it's their faith
[1:02:13] so what we got to do is understand the
[1:02:15] moving of the power of god
[1:02:18] is not just understanding we can lay
[1:02:20] hands and people will be healed
[1:02:22] we can lay hands and people will be
[1:02:24] delivered
[1:02:27] it goes much deeper than that
[1:02:31] i hope you are you with me tonight
[1:02:38] so i say this again i think we should
[1:02:40] this is just my feelings
[1:02:41] oh i used that word didn't i feelings
[1:02:45] this is the way i see it
[1:02:48] we probably should pray for
[1:02:49] understanding more
[1:02:52] right maybe we can put that right there
[1:02:53] on the list just underneath
[1:02:55] patience
[1:03:00] but to pray for understanding because
[1:03:02] you see so many people saints
[1:03:04] are are kind of i'm going to use the
[1:03:07] word disturbed because they prayed and
[1:03:09] they prayed and they prayed
[1:03:10] and it doesn't seem like god is
[1:03:12] answering their prayer
[1:03:14] but partly it's because we're not
[1:03:16] understanding what god
[1:03:17] is trying to accomplish in our own life
[1:03:20] now you can go study it
[1:03:21] in the message you'll see where brother
[1:03:22] brown says i have to be careful when i
[1:03:25] go
[1:03:25] praying for people for deliverance
[1:03:27] because sometimes god
[1:03:29] allows these things to come on people
[1:03:33] to move them from their position and
[1:03:35] brother brown says i have to be careful
[1:03:37] about
[1:03:37] praying for deliverance so you're going
[1:03:40] to understand the will of god
[1:03:43] now god never put sickness upon a human
[1:03:45] people are like oh god let me get sick
[1:03:47] no he didn't
[1:03:48] but god pulled his hedge back and he let
[1:03:51] the devil who would love to make you
[1:03:52] sick come in
[1:03:53] and god says that's no problem because i
[1:03:56] know
[1:03:57] i have delivering power i know that i
[1:03:59] can change this situation
[1:04:01] but i need something to move this
[1:04:04] individual
[1:04:05] who is oh not you but people like you
[1:04:08] stubborn
[1:04:10] and overly determined and overly think
[1:04:12] we're right and overly think we're
[1:04:14] righteous and overly think that
[1:04:17] right there's a way that seemeth right
[1:04:21] that's correct
[1:04:24] so we have to understand that and i know
[1:04:26] brother david and brother chris would
[1:04:28] know this as ministers
[1:04:30] there's been times saints i have prayed
[1:04:32] for people and i've fully determined
[1:04:33] when i laid hands on
[1:04:35] i was just gonna cast that devil out or
[1:04:37] just claim it in the name of jesus
[1:04:38] christ
[1:04:39] and you find yourself praying lord thy
[1:04:41] will be done
[1:04:43] that's all you can do because there's
[1:04:46] something there
[1:04:47] that you recognize is checking you from
[1:04:50] taking the word
[1:04:51] and driving the devil away because you
[1:04:54] realize there's something just comes
[1:04:56] over you
[1:04:56] that god's doing something here all i
[1:04:58] want lord for this individual is your
[1:05:00] will be done
[1:05:01] amen
[1:05:05] that doesn't mean we love them any less
[1:05:07] or have any less desire to see them
[1:05:10] delivered but
[1:05:10] we're not here to contest as it were
[1:05:13] with god over what we want to accomplish
[1:05:16] and so it is there
[1:05:20] oftentimes i think that we come as a
[1:05:23] results-oriented oriented
[1:05:25] preach
[1:05:28] we're praying with a goal orient
[1:05:32] we're this is lord this
[1:05:35] is what
[1:05:38] am i making sense
[1:05:43] we come and we have a very specific
[1:05:45] we're praying to the lord
[1:05:47] very specifically and there's nothing
[1:05:50] wrong with that
[1:05:51] saints but we need to as the word of god
[1:05:54] shows us brother branham emphasis
[1:05:56] we need to say you know what lord thy
[1:05:59] will
[1:06:00] lord if you are willing lord
[1:06:04] so that we're not coming and saying you
[1:06:06] know what i prayed for brother so and so
[1:06:07] i prayed for sisters so and so
[1:06:09] and it didn't seem like god answered my
[1:06:11] prayer
[1:06:13] no no don't let the devil get that god
[1:06:16] answers prayer saints
[1:06:18] it's sometimes we're looking at the big
[1:06:20] picture and god's moving in the
[1:06:22] background
[1:06:23] amen what we don't need see this has
[1:06:26] happened so much in days gone by
[1:06:28] i pray it's not happening now but when
[1:06:30] the days gone by there
[1:06:32] used to be great sweeping meetings and a
[1:06:34] lot of people young and old come and
[1:06:36] they got baptized and they made
[1:06:38] commitments and they did all this but
[1:06:39] there was no real conversion
[1:06:41] and so it was there that by the will of
[1:06:43] man people felt compelled to
[1:06:46] come to the water be baptized do all of
[1:06:48] these things
[1:06:49] but nothing really changed and what god
[1:06:52] wants is to start down
[1:06:53] in the background at the bedrock and he
[1:06:56] wants something within the soul
[1:06:58] not an emotional compelling not an
[1:07:00] emotional
[1:07:02] you don't want to go to hell
[1:07:05] don't don't do that we don't want to do
[1:07:07] that the will of god
[1:07:09] is something down in the inside says you
[1:07:11] know what i love you lord
[1:07:13] i want to serve you lord and and see
[1:07:16] that's where people don't understand
[1:07:17] when brother branham said
[1:07:19] you know what i even if i knew he was
[1:07:20] going to send me to hell
[1:07:22] i would still serve him it's because
[1:07:24] down in the very depths of that
[1:07:26] was a love for the things that god has
[1:07:29] done for his love to us
[1:07:31] his grace his mercy his blood and if
[1:07:34] somehow we recognize i'm coming up short
[1:07:36] of the goal
[1:07:37] lord it's not your fault help me lord
[1:07:41] but see people become angry now i won't
[1:07:43] ask anybody to raise a hand but it's
[1:07:45] more frequent than we realize that
[1:07:47] people become angry at god
[1:07:49] because prayers are not being answered
[1:07:51] and situations are not changing
[1:07:53] i've got a husband i've got a wife i've
[1:07:55] got children i've got parents i've got a
[1:07:57] friend
[1:07:58] and lord nothing's happening why aren't
[1:08:01] you
[1:08:01] answering me
[1:08:04] maybe they need to pass through the fire
[1:08:06] one more time
[1:08:08] maybe they need to go through the
[1:08:10] struggle of life one more time
[1:08:12] maybe god wants to take them to the
[1:08:14] brink of extinction
[1:08:17] so that he can bring them back so that
[1:08:20] they will never forget
[1:08:22] who they are and why they are here
[1:08:25] hallelujah it's hard my brother and
[1:08:26] sister and you think serving god is
[1:08:29] heart just go
[1:08:30] serve the devil and he will use you
[1:08:32] abuse you
[1:08:33] and trash you and abandon you
[1:08:38] people are like well it's just too hard
[1:08:39] being a christian wow
[1:08:42] wow look what the devil's got in store
[1:08:50] now
[1:08:57] trying to find myself here
[1:09:00] brother alex did we not get the paradox
[1:09:04] put in there
[1:09:06] we didn't okay that's fine no no problem
[1:09:10] at all
[1:09:10] i just didn't want to so in the message
[1:09:13] the paradox
[1:09:15] 61 1210 brother branham says this it was
[1:09:18] a paradox when the great soldier
[1:09:20] of god by the name of jehoshaphat stood
[1:09:23] in the gates with a backslidden man by
[1:09:25] the name of ahab
[1:09:27] and said before we go to this battle
[1:09:30] is is not it a good thing that we
[1:09:33] consult the lord
[1:09:36] now look at this he's going and he's
[1:09:39] something's compelling him to say
[1:09:41] i think we better stop and we better
[1:09:44] pray for understanding of the will of
[1:09:46] god
[1:09:47] is this something we should do or or
[1:09:49] should we go home or
[1:09:50] whatever it might be now brother branham
[1:09:53] i brought this for these words right
[1:09:54] here so i'll read it real slow so i'll
[1:09:56] catch it
[1:09:57] now if that man's heart is hungry
[1:10:01] to know the will of god
[1:10:04] there's got to be a will of god
[1:10:07] somewhere
[1:10:09] now remember what brother branham taught
[1:10:11] us he preached this deep cult to the
[1:10:13] deep
[1:10:14] so if there's something deep within the
[1:10:16] soul of a man or a woman
[1:10:17] to cry out to god there's got to be
[1:10:20] something there
[1:10:21] to answer this and now brother brown
[1:10:23] takes this same i'm going to use the
[1:10:25] word theory so forgive me if it isn't
[1:10:26] quite the right way
[1:10:27] brother branham takes this what would be
[1:10:29] the right word brother brown takes his
[1:10:31] context he takes this uh
[1:10:33] this principle this pattern would that
[1:10:35] be better put it that way
[1:10:37] he takes this and now he's applying this
[1:10:39] that if there's something
[1:10:40] in your heart that is desiring to know
[1:10:44] the will of god god's got a will
[1:10:46] expressly
[1:10:47] for you not some blanket will you know
[1:10:51] go to church
[1:10:52] be faithful pray read your bible but
[1:10:55] something specific
[1:10:57] for you now i believe it's the same my
[1:11:01] brother and sister he says that those
[1:11:02] that hunger and thirst after
[1:11:04] righteousness
[1:11:05] will be filled so if we're hungry and
[1:11:08] thirsty
[1:11:09] after the will of god for our life for
[1:11:12] our church our family whatever the
[1:11:14] situation might be
[1:11:15] then god's got a specific answer
[1:11:18] for you and i to guide us into his will
[1:11:26] have you ever suffered from the
[1:11:28] uncertainty of life
[1:11:31] and when i use that word suffer i mean
[1:11:33] suffer
[1:11:35] now i'll bring this back don't feel
[1:11:36] sorry for us i just feel like a
[1:11:38] use an example that's not one of you
[1:11:42] there was a time in our life sister
[1:11:43] jerry and i lost so much money several
[1:11:45] years in a row
[1:11:47] that have finally come up to the fact we
[1:11:48] weren't bankrupt we had more assets than
[1:11:51] we had debts
[1:11:53] but when your wife comes to you and says
[1:11:55] paul we have eighty thousand dollars
[1:11:56] worth of bills and we have seventy eight
[1:11:58] hundred dollars in the bank
[1:11:59] uh what do you want me to do
[1:12:04] and you get up every morning with an
[1:12:06] uncertainty
[1:12:08] of life to compound this we had a man
[1:12:12] who showed up at seven o'clock
[1:12:14] every thursday morning wanting to know
[1:12:17] when are you going to pay the money
[1:12:19] me i was so frustrated i wanted to grab
[1:12:22] him choke him throw him off the step
[1:12:24] put him back in his car push it down the
[1:12:26] hill
[1:12:29] my wife was like paul it's not the right
[1:12:32] thing
[1:12:33] then she'd turn to this man and say you
[1:12:35] realize it's still
[1:12:38] you know whatever it was 46 days till we
[1:12:40] owe the money
[1:12:42] i know but this is my job and if i don't
[1:12:44] do my job they fire me and i've got a
[1:12:45] mortgage
[1:12:46] i'm going to be knocking on your door
[1:12:48] every thursday morning
[1:12:50] because i got a mortgage to pay okay
[1:12:52] good
[1:12:53] talk about uncertainty you know what
[1:12:55] happened saints
[1:12:56] i'll tell you just very briefly what
[1:12:58] happened paul
[1:13:00] was headed this direction turning into a
[1:13:02] wreck
[1:13:03] my wife was headed this direction saying
[1:13:06] god's in control paul don't forget
[1:13:08] god's in control all i could think of
[1:13:10] saints was
[1:13:11] everything i've worked for for years
[1:13:13] here is going away
[1:13:16] now that seems to be what happened right
[1:13:19] but i tell you what happened was behind
[1:13:21] the scenes
[1:13:22] god was making things in his
[1:13:25] supernatural realm
[1:13:27] take place and when it got really close
[1:13:31] that it looked like it was just going to
[1:13:32] be toast i finally resigned myself to
[1:13:34] the fact that this is always going to be
[1:13:36] over and this might be god's will so
[1:13:38] okay whatever
[1:13:39] and then the supernatural started coming
[1:13:41] a check from the bean company because
[1:13:43] and i won't go into all these details
[1:13:44] because of an issue
[1:13:45] and a check from a man that we had sold
[1:13:47] uh hay to
[1:13:49] that had uh uh you know was there was an
[1:13:51] issue
[1:13:52] as it was he told me he could buy hay
[1:13:54] all day long at this price
[1:13:55] and then he went shopping for hay and
[1:13:57] realized that he had to pay considerably
[1:13:59] more
[1:14:00] and something stirred a dutchman
[1:14:09] to write a check for the difference and
[1:14:12] send it to me
[1:14:14] now this is a good man and i respect him
[1:14:15] right we're not talking about him
[1:14:17] but something stirred him and he was
[1:14:19] like i told you something and
[1:14:21] basically it was a lie here's a check
[1:14:25] for
[1:14:25] i don't remember the numbers now twenty
[1:14:27] thousand dollars
[1:14:30] not pocket change not fifty bucks
[1:14:33] but you see god moving in the background
[1:14:38] god doing what god does now my brother
[1:14:40] and sister i've used
[1:14:42] natural examples here but i'm telling
[1:14:44] you that is this the tip of the iceberg
[1:14:47] because god does deal in the natural but
[1:14:49] god specializes in the spiritual
[1:14:52] amen so while he's working in the
[1:14:54] natural he specializes
[1:14:56] in the spiritual amen so what it is my
[1:15:00] brother and sister if we suffer from the
[1:15:02] uncertainty of life
[1:15:03] it drains the joy from us and satan boy
[1:15:06] don't you know he wants you as a
[1:15:08] christian just to be down and out and
[1:15:10] pouty and
[1:15:10] life is horrible and nothing's going
[1:15:12] right in my life and
[1:15:14] whatever that's what satan desires so
[1:15:16] he's trying to drain the joy from you
[1:15:19] but when you come to the place that you
[1:15:21] have a certainty and that certainty
[1:15:23] might be
[1:15:24] all the rest of this is gonna go away we
[1:15:26] might lose everything we own
[1:15:28] but i am a son of god i'm a daughter of
[1:15:31] god
[1:15:31] and you have that certainty suddenly all
[1:15:34] the things of the natural
[1:15:36] diminish in your sight and you realize
[1:15:38] it's not about that anyway
[1:15:40] it's not about what we possess in the
[1:15:42] natural but the fact that i have a
[1:15:44] certainty by the word of god that i am a
[1:15:47] son of god i'm a daughter of god
[1:15:50] and this work he began in me he is going
[1:15:52] to finish it
[1:15:54] hallelujah and it change your whole
[1:15:56] perspective you can
[1:15:57] say oh lord whatever it is amen
[1:16:01] when you come to that place now i hope
[1:16:02] you catch where i'm going right here
[1:16:04] you can come to the place that in the
[1:16:06] natural life so let's just talk about
[1:16:08] your finances
[1:16:09] the natural life there may be
[1:16:11] uncertainty of
[1:16:12] paying the mortgage or paying the rent
[1:16:14] or whatever it is there might be
[1:16:16] uncertainty there
[1:16:17] but you come to a place that you can
[1:16:20] walk
[1:16:20] in liberty because you have a certainty
[1:16:24] and because you know that you are
[1:16:26] anchored in that word of god and
[1:16:28] and you're able to take that and say oh
[1:16:31] lord
[1:16:31] thank you thank you lord i know what
[1:16:34] your will is
[1:16:35] it wasn't for me to be this super middle
[1:16:37] class or well-off or whatever
[1:16:39] it wasn't for me to be this or to be
[1:16:41] that it was for me
[1:16:42] to be the son or daughter of god and
[1:16:45] manifest the word in the laodicean age
[1:16:47] of all the people there is
[1:16:49] you chose me and i have a certainty i
[1:16:52] know
[1:16:52] it's the will of god that i live
[1:16:54] victorious that i live with praise on my
[1:16:57] lips and
[1:16:58] i live with a liberty in jesus christ
[1:17:02] hallelujah can somebody say lord let me
[1:17:04] know thy will
[1:17:06] amen that's what we want to know my
[1:17:07] brother and sister because when you know
[1:17:09] you're walking in the will of god
[1:17:11] you know you're walking and you are
[1:17:13] there now look you can go look this up
[1:17:15] study it for yourself
[1:17:16] i i could use it in another sermon but
[1:17:18] you can also study this out
[1:17:20] look at what brother branham talks about
[1:17:21] when people move over
[1:17:23] into the permissible will of god
[1:17:29] they're not lost i thought brother david
[1:17:31] you was gonna preach my sermon for me
[1:17:33] tonight
[1:17:34] my brother and sister you get over there
[1:17:36] see we we can get in the permissible
[1:17:38] will of god
[1:17:39] and and it doesn't mean as it would be
[1:17:41] backslid
[1:17:43] doesn't mean god just threw you off in
[1:17:45] the dumpster and you're gone
[1:17:46] but my brother and sister that
[1:17:48] permissible will is in no
[1:17:50] way the same as walking in that perfect
[1:17:53] will of god
[1:17:54] and i lift my hand hands tonight and say
[1:17:57] lord help me walk
[1:17:58] in thy perfect will let me walk lord
[1:18:01] according to that let me understand
[1:18:04] what your will is for my life
[1:18:08] because you might be there and all of
[1:18:11] that would be fine
[1:18:13] but my brother and sister if we're gonna
[1:18:14] walk well i've always put it this way i
[1:18:17] don't know where i come up with this
[1:18:18] maybe i plagiarized it
[1:18:21] but i'm telling you you're gonna give
[1:18:22] your life
[1:18:24] now or then but you're going to give
[1:18:27] your life
[1:18:29] oh wouldn't it be much better just give
[1:18:31] our life as a bride of christ a walk in
[1:18:34] liberty
[1:18:35] knowing the will of god than to come and
[1:18:37] realize lord i wasted all those years
[1:18:40] and the persecution as it would we all
[1:18:42] have concepts of what the tribulation
[1:18:44] would be like i'm not trying to define
[1:18:45] that
[1:18:46] but to find yourself there knowing lord
[1:18:48] i messed up
[1:18:49] i missed it oh god i know i know
[1:18:53] that i am yours lord i know
[1:18:57] but yet unwilling here to give it god
[1:19:00] help us
[1:19:01] god help us to break through that self
[1:19:04] will that
[1:19:05] stubborn spirit that holds us back and
[1:19:08] i'm telling you this evening i hope it
[1:19:09] don't
[1:19:10] shake you or or make you nervous but i
[1:19:12] got both hands up saying lord help us
[1:19:14] amen not to be looking at all of the
[1:19:16] things around us right now and
[1:19:18] forgetting the supernatural
[1:19:25] now in the message be certain of god
[1:19:28] isn't that what we want to be see if
[1:19:31] you're certain of god
[1:19:34] you can take his word for anything he
[1:19:36] says
[1:19:38] and that beautiful but you see we can't
[1:19:40] do this if we're on the fence
[1:19:42] that's right you're not going to be able
[1:19:44] to take everything that god says to you
[1:19:46] if you're on the fence
[1:19:48] if one day you're on fire and the next
[1:19:50] day you're cold as ice
[1:19:52] boy isn't the devil like to do that
[1:19:58] if you're certain of god you can take
[1:19:59] his word for anything he says
[1:20:01] if you're not certain that he is god
[1:20:04] and this is a bible then you'd better be
[1:20:06] careful of what you're doing
[1:20:09] and i want to tie this back my brother
[1:20:11] and sister to
[1:20:12] kind of into this original scripture
[1:20:15] here
[1:20:16] in proverbs amen the wisdom of the
[1:20:19] prudent is
[1:20:19] understand his way but the folly of
[1:20:21] fools is deceit
[1:20:23] now in that folly of fools my brother
[1:20:25] and sister is someone
[1:20:26] hiding the truth from you amen
[1:20:30] the folly of fools is when
[1:20:33] they would give you something less than
[1:20:35] the truth when the truth would serve
[1:20:37] even them better but see there's an
[1:20:41] anointing there
[1:20:43] we're going to take this message and
[1:20:45] we're going to chop it up
[1:20:46] and we're only going to serve to you
[1:20:48] pardon me
[1:20:50] you get this little portion you get this
[1:20:53] little portion
[1:20:54] you get this little portion when we can
[1:20:57] hand out the hole
[1:20:58] amen let me just mimic it this way we
[1:21:01] can hand out the hole
[1:21:07] and there's still the hole to hand out
[1:21:11] it's not like we're going to run short
[1:21:14] amen there's no shortage of the holy
[1:21:15] ghost in our lives
[1:21:17] amen there's no shortage of the word of
[1:21:19] god waiting to be manifested the
[1:21:21] presence of god waiting to come into our
[1:21:24] midst
[1:21:25] no shortage amen but you'll see there'll
[1:21:27] be those that are anointed my brother
[1:21:29] and sister
[1:21:30] to deceive my heart actually goes out to
[1:21:33] that
[1:21:34] people that have to go and and when you
[1:21:36] question them um show me in the bible
[1:21:38] they just skip off to something else
[1:21:41] they can't back it up
[1:21:45] now if you can't find it here how you're
[1:21:47] going to know the will of god concerning
[1:21:49] it
[1:21:49] or if there is another interpretation
[1:21:53] and you respect this is the thing that
[1:21:55] catches people i respect brother so and
[1:21:57] so
[1:21:58] and uh what he's saying doesn't fit the
[1:22:00] bible but i respect him
[1:22:02] and so then you give his word equal
[1:22:05] weight to the bible
[1:22:06] yeah that's it that's not what the
[1:22:07] prophet said is it
[1:22:09] he said you take everything back to
[1:22:12] scripture
[1:22:14] so that means as much as i love brother
[1:22:16] david
[1:22:17] i have to take everything brother david
[1:22:19] said back to scripture as much as i love
[1:22:21] brother chris's ministry
[1:22:22] i go to take everything back to
[1:22:24] scripture and i would hope that you
[1:22:25] would say the same thing concerning
[1:22:27] myself
[1:22:28] amen so you look at this see then you'd
[1:22:31] be better be careful what you're doing
[1:22:33] but if you're certain meet his
[1:22:36] requirements
[1:22:38] see this isn't a free ride oh we're in
[1:22:40] the message we got a free ride
[1:22:42] no we don't meet his requirements then
[1:22:45] faith takes it solemn rest
[1:22:48] oh faith cannot be based upon the
[1:22:51] shifting sins of man's theology
[1:22:53] but faith takes its solemn stand upon
[1:22:56] the eternal
[1:22:57] everlasting rock of god's eternal faith
[1:23:00] and there it rests unmovable now i've
[1:23:03] often brought this in a fashion saints
[1:23:05] and i i don't ever want to be irreverent
[1:23:08] but you know i'm sure there's a lot of
[1:23:10] people out here that sing the song i
[1:23:12] shall not be moved but they don't sing
[1:23:14] it with the same thought that you and i
[1:23:15] do
[1:23:16] amen i believe this and you ain't moving
[1:23:18] me no matter what i don't care
[1:23:20] god comes and shakes it down and there's
[1:23:22] ample evidence that's what i'm
[1:23:24] i shall not be moved
[1:23:28] but look at this now a real believer
[1:23:30] comes upon the eternal everlasting rock
[1:23:33] of god's eternal faith
[1:23:35] there it rests unmovable it knows
[1:23:38] that god is and a rewarder of those that
[1:23:42] diligently seek him isn't that beautiful
[1:23:46] you know how diligently seeking him can
[1:23:47] be saints can i
[1:23:49] just not try to
[1:23:52] look down or whatever upon your
[1:23:54] intelligence and understanding
[1:23:57] right i'm not trying to look down on
[1:23:59] anyone
[1:24:01] but you know what diligently seeking him
[1:24:03] is
[1:24:08] seeking him in everything
[1:24:13] often time the diligence of seeking him
[1:24:19] can be something that people go
[1:24:22] you pray about that
[1:24:26] yes i do because i
[1:24:30] want to understand god's will
[1:24:34] for me amen i don't want god's will in
[1:24:37] just
[1:24:37] big things or god's will when i'm sick
[1:24:41] i want god's will in everything amen
[1:24:46] theirs were the diligence of seeking him
[1:24:49] what is that
[1:24:50] absolutely brother david almost started
[1:24:52] preaching on it i'll tell you
[1:24:54] that's absolutely putting god first in
[1:24:57] everything
[1:24:58] and dying out to our own thoughts
[1:25:01] on everything
[1:25:04] boy that's hard isn't it come on let's
[1:25:07] be honest with one another that's hard
[1:25:10] we get ideas you know you know you get
[1:25:12] an idea on something and
[1:25:14] and you're like oh i want to buy one of
[1:25:15] these and you'll find yourself on
[1:25:17] craigslist
[1:25:18] you're looking for one of those you look
[1:25:19] for one of those every day and pretty
[1:25:21] soon you get the idea i don't think god
[1:25:22] wants me to have one of those
[1:25:25] now it might be a multitude of reasons
[1:25:26] you think i can spend 250 dollars
[1:25:29] and there's not one on craigslist for
[1:25:30] less than 500. the devil's there what's
[1:25:32] another 250.
[1:25:37] and that could go into a whole whole
[1:25:40] thing
[1:25:40] jerry's over there laughing she's like
[1:25:42] hi you're preaching about yourself
[1:25:47] always yeah amen
[1:25:51] now look at this saints so as we come to
[1:25:53] this
[1:25:54] we'll see now that if we are have that
[1:25:57] kind of
[1:25:57] certainty we can come to this place
[1:26:01] with such a caution
[1:26:05] such a a a desire
[1:26:08] to look into the future we're looking
[1:26:11] there
[1:26:12] we're saying okay now what is this i
[1:26:14] want lord i want to do
[1:26:17] i want to make a decision today lord
[1:26:20] that actually blesses my family
[1:26:22] tomorrow i want to do
[1:26:26] today church
[1:26:29] when i speak to you i want to lay
[1:26:31] something that might be a benefit to you
[1:26:34] tomorrow or the next day or next week or
[1:26:36] next month
[1:26:38] see we can anybody can preach the
[1:26:40] flowery stuff
[1:26:42] and i don't say this in any kind of
[1:26:43] mockery or whatever but
[1:26:45] anyone can get up here and lay out the
[1:26:47] whole platform of god's center prophet
[1:26:50] and we can get excited about that i'm
[1:26:52] glad he sent him saints
[1:26:53] we i don't know what we'd be maybe we'd
[1:26:55] still be methodists
[1:26:59] but you see there's more to that we can
[1:27:02] get beyond it why did god send a prophet
[1:27:04] people are like oh god send a prophet
[1:27:06] all these people look what it's going to
[1:27:07] do but you know what when you really
[1:27:09] read malachi you'll realize sister kerry
[1:27:11] god sent a prophet just to you
[1:27:16] just to you just to you just to you
[1:27:19] see it wasn't that it's like oh he goes
[1:27:21] forget the whole world saints forget
[1:27:23] everybody else in the church
[1:27:24] behold i send you malachi 4.
[1:27:28] amen i send you elijah the prophet
[1:27:32] why because we had specific needs that
[1:27:35] had to be met
[1:27:36] and by the preaching of the word it
[1:27:38] isn't just
[1:27:39] a prophet's word to you but you find
[1:27:42] that it's the will of god being revealed
[1:27:44] this is actually a revelation that is
[1:27:48] coming out when you see the will of god
[1:27:50] for your life
[1:27:52] people like oh i never saw that
[1:27:53] scripture before but i'm telling you
[1:27:55] what's just equally exciting to me
[1:27:57] is when someone in the body of believers
[1:28:00] eyes is open
[1:28:02] and they actually one day realize what
[1:28:04] this whole thing is
[1:28:06] about it's not me coming and conforming
[1:28:09] and this and that
[1:28:10] this is god himself saying i am
[1:28:12] unrolling the red carpet
[1:28:14] from this point all the way into
[1:28:17] eternity
[1:28:18] for you and you realize that down in
[1:28:20] your soul
[1:28:21] that that's what god's doing he's making
[1:28:24] a way
[1:28:24] he said i will make the way smooth
[1:28:26] before you
[1:28:30] as the devil drives around throwing all
[1:28:32] the rocks out
[1:28:33] and we say man life is hard well i tell
[1:28:37] you what
[1:28:38] if god gave you a supernatural vision of
[1:28:40] what it was
[1:28:41] compared to what the devil has for you
[1:28:43] that's smooth
[1:28:46] and you know what the bane of christians
[1:28:49] are
[1:28:50] of christians is laziness
[1:28:55] that's the bane of christians we get
[1:28:57] lazy
[1:29:00] that's why god lets the wheels fall off
[1:29:01] your car
[1:29:05] so that you don't just get up oh lord
[1:29:07] bless our day thank you
[1:29:10] you actually stop and say lord we need
[1:29:13] you around here
[1:29:15] we need you lord you see that's his will
[1:29:18] if you want an example
[1:29:19] i don't preach it tonight in fact i want
[1:29:21] to stop uh but you just go look what
[1:29:23] brother branham
[1:29:24] just go look read job and then go look
[1:29:26] at what brother brown says
[1:29:28] about job you'll see that job was a
[1:29:31] perfect
[1:29:32] man in the eyes of god but god was going
[1:29:35] to prove himself
[1:29:38] amen okay
[1:29:42] let's let's hurry up hurry on here real
[1:29:46] quick
[1:29:47] and uh first corinthians 1 and 18
[1:29:51] now we're going to look here at what
[1:29:52] this wisdom
[1:29:54] and prudence and uh foolishness
[1:29:57] all right here in this few scriptures is
[1:30:01] very condensed down it's just beautiful
[1:30:04] for the preaching of the cross is to
[1:30:06] them that perish foolishness
[1:30:08] so we have a whole class of people that
[1:30:11] this is all foolishness to
[1:30:13] i was talking to a gentleman a few days
[1:30:15] ago and he was like what kind of church
[1:30:17] do you have
[1:30:18] and i thought might as well just get
[1:30:20] this conversation over with
[1:30:22] we are holiness oh
[1:30:29] then paul just acts like he doesn't have
[1:30:31] a clue he just comes stumbling right
[1:30:33] along
[1:30:34] well you know holiness is all through
[1:30:38] the bible in fact god even described
[1:30:40] himself
[1:30:42] in holiness uh yeah okay
[1:30:46] ah look saints know you're speaking
[1:30:49] around the bush
[1:30:51] there's some people that the preaching
[1:30:53] of the cross is holding us part of the
[1:30:55] preaching of the cross
[1:30:57] amen we serve a righteous god a holy god
[1:31:00] amen so to the preaching of the cross
[1:31:03] it's to them that perish foolishness
[1:31:05] but unto us which are saved it is the
[1:31:07] power of god
[1:31:08] oh i tell you what we're probably going
[1:31:10] to have to preach on high heels here in
[1:31:12] the church
[1:31:13] seems like we've had an invasion i don't
[1:31:16] know if we compare them to grasshoppers
[1:31:18] or mormon crickets or
[1:31:19] mosquitoes but you know it just seems
[1:31:22] like they get in the room and they just
[1:31:23] spread out
[1:31:24] my brother and sister i'm not against
[1:31:26] anybody i love everybody that comes this
[1:31:27] church
[1:31:28] but are we are we a message church
[1:31:34] now you don't have to but i'm just going
[1:31:36] to tell you if you want to go spend some
[1:31:38] time
[1:31:39] just go study what the prophet of god
[1:31:41] said about high heels
[1:31:43] and if i don't want to scar your eyes i
[1:31:45] could give you a demonstration
[1:31:49] come on the prophet of god said mincing
[1:31:54] you know what that means i won't follow
[1:31:56] it through
[1:31:57] so i scar you but mincing
[1:32:00] is the action and movement
[1:32:04] of the body amen
[1:32:08] meant to entice amen
[1:32:12] that's exactly right
[1:32:15] now some people be upset you know the
[1:32:17] preachers preach it on
[1:32:18] on clothesline religion or something
[1:32:20] like that is it
[1:32:21] clothesline or is it the gospel
[1:32:26] we can call it clothesline and then
[1:32:28] think it's petty or whatever
[1:32:30] or we can preach the gospel now i know
[1:32:33] it's only half the church here tonight
[1:32:35] but
[1:32:35] i mean do you want brother branham you
[1:32:38] know
[1:32:39] says i'm deviating i'm sorry but brother
[1:32:41] brown says you know
[1:32:42] that the problem we have is
[1:32:46] weak pulpits
[1:32:50] praise the lord if all those people quit
[1:32:52] because they don't want to hear it means
[1:32:53] you guys will just have to pay twice as
[1:32:55] much but no problem
[1:33:00] no that's the problem do you get what
[1:33:03] i'm being facetious about
[1:33:05] people are worried about who's going to
[1:33:06] pay the bills
[1:33:08] more than they are about who's going to
[1:33:10] make the rapture
[1:33:11] let's get this in its right proportion
[1:33:13] god will take care of the bills
[1:33:16] we want to be ready for the rapture
[1:33:20] for his written i will destroy the
[1:33:21] wisdom of the wise and i will bring to
[1:33:23] nothing the understanding of the prudent
[1:33:26] so now we have this group of people
[1:33:28] saints this is why i brought that little
[1:33:30] disclaimer to you
[1:33:31] we have a group of people that are
[1:33:32] thinking for the future
[1:33:34] and they might be right in the church
[1:33:37] they're like well now the church is
[1:33:38] growing we've got a program we're going
[1:33:40] to have to build a wing here we're going
[1:33:41] to have to sell it buy more property
[1:33:43] we need a building fund we need to do
[1:33:44] this we need to make these investments
[1:33:46] and we want to make sure that we have a
[1:33:48] group outreach for this
[1:33:49] and for this and for this and for this
[1:33:53] you know what i find out saints now
[1:33:55] sorry i'm kind of deviating
[1:33:56] but you know people approach me actually
[1:33:58] quite regular you'd be a little bit
[1:34:00] surprised how
[1:34:01] regular people call me and they say hey
[1:34:03] we're this group and we're this
[1:34:05] or sometimes it's just almost like a
[1:34:07] social type thing
[1:34:09] and we would like to use your church
[1:34:12] we're this little group and we'd like to
[1:34:14] rent your church we notice you don't
[1:34:16] have sunday evening service and
[1:34:18] we'd like to rent your church on sunday
[1:34:19] evening or have it on thursday evening
[1:34:22] or tuesday evening
[1:34:23] and you know saints when you think about
[1:34:24] it some of them are like we're willing
[1:34:26] to pay you
[1:34:27] like 350 450 550
[1:34:30] some of them were like we'll give you
[1:34:32] 250 a week that's a thousand bucks a
[1:34:33] month
[1:34:36] but you know what a thousand bucks a
[1:34:38] month is worth when you walk into your
[1:34:40] own church
[1:34:41] and you have to start fighting your way
[1:34:43] through these spirits
[1:34:45] to try to get some liberty inside your
[1:34:49] own church amen
[1:34:52] hallelujah
[1:34:55] so i will bring to nothing the
[1:34:57] understanding of the prudence so we have
[1:34:59] prudent now
[1:35:00] the definition doesn't change but the
[1:35:02] atmosphere or the spirit on the
[1:35:04] individual that we're talking about
[1:35:06] being prudent
[1:35:07] so we're going to have those people out
[1:35:09] here in laodicea
[1:35:10] that are prudent you'll meet them and
[1:35:12] they are they're the ones that have a
[1:35:13] balanced budget have no debt they have
[1:35:15] this they have that they got plans for
[1:35:17] the future
[1:35:18] and everything's all laid out all's well
[1:35:20] and then you will find those that are
[1:35:22] sons and daughters of god who are also
[1:35:26] living by you might say budgets and this
[1:35:28] and that not above their means and
[1:35:30] whatever but there's something different
[1:35:32] because one has found favor in the eyes
[1:35:34] of god one has found favor in wisdom of
[1:35:37] this world
[1:35:39] and an attribute of that wisdom
[1:35:43] well i'll tell you what it works a lot
[1:35:44] we read the scripture already
[1:35:46] amen those of those of god find favor
[1:35:49] with god see you can look at this now
[1:35:53] when you go home and you study this look
[1:35:54] at this from natural and spiritual
[1:35:57] and you will see the type is almost to
[1:35:59] me glaring it's just
[1:36:00] bold it's just there because you can
[1:36:02] find people i could introduce you
[1:36:04] tonight
[1:36:05] probably they'd answer the phone and i
[1:36:06] could take your house tonight people
[1:36:08] that have
[1:36:09] just done they just do everything just
[1:36:11] right
[1:36:12] but they have no desire to serve god so
[1:36:15] being prudent does not them
[1:36:16] any good in the eternal realm
[1:36:23] where is the wise where is the scribe
[1:36:26] where is the disputer of this world
[1:36:28] hath not god made foolish the wisdom of
[1:36:31] this world
[1:36:32] now if we don't think so saints you can
[1:36:34] just go on your computer i don't know
[1:36:36] how maybe you want to find news or
[1:36:38] even if you dare to find news anymore
[1:36:40] but when you look out here
[1:36:41] now i find this and i'm not making fun
[1:36:43] of the man because i believe it's the
[1:36:45] spirit of the day and god's going to
[1:36:46] manifest that has to bring it back
[1:36:48] but i heard today just listen to the
[1:36:50] radio for a few minutes when i was
[1:36:52] doing and and they had these clips and
[1:36:54] here's the government their spokesman
[1:36:56] saying
[1:36:57] oh no if you're vaccinated you don't
[1:36:58] need to wear a mask anywhere
[1:37:00] in the very next clip they're like if
[1:37:01] you're vaccinated you still need to wear
[1:37:03] two masks
[1:37:04] and then the next clip is if you are
[1:37:06] indoors with your own family you don't
[1:37:08] need to wear a mouse the very next clip
[1:37:10] is says
[1:37:11] well probably to be safe if your
[1:37:12] children are you know blah blah
[1:37:14] you probably should even wear the mask
[1:37:15] inside of your house and if you go in
[1:37:18] public you should do this and this oh no
[1:37:19] you don't need to do this you can do
[1:37:21] that you can do this over here no don't
[1:37:22] do that do it this way do it that way do
[1:37:24] it this way over here
[1:37:25] you need to get vaccinated you know
[1:37:26] we're thinking about making it so you
[1:37:28] can vaccinate it a third time now
[1:37:36] foolishness foolishness
[1:37:41] now we won't argue about it amen those
[1:37:44] are personal choices
[1:37:47] but you see my brother and sister my
[1:37:48] point is not about the vaccine itself
[1:37:52] my point is they're out here all over
[1:37:54] the table
[1:37:55] all over they have no clear answer
[1:38:00] because they're trusting to something
[1:38:03] that is foolishness in the eyes of god
[1:38:06] amen
[1:38:07] brother branham said they broke into
[1:38:08] god's laboratory
[1:38:10] amen they run amok inside that
[1:38:12] laboratory
[1:38:15] amen
[1:38:19] so what did god do he comes along
[1:38:24] and says you know what i'm going to do
[1:38:25] i'm going to do by the foolishness of
[1:38:26] preaching
[1:38:27] and let me tell you saints there's many
[1:38:29] a time i walk out of this church get in
[1:38:31] the car start driving home
[1:38:33] thinking paul you are so foolish
[1:38:36] you said what you used what for an
[1:38:39] example
[1:38:40] you'd oh my oh my i'm
[1:38:44] resigning i'm done i'm finished i can't
[1:38:47] face the people again
[1:38:50] now i say this in jest but when your
[1:38:52] wife injest gets in the car and is
[1:38:55] driving home and she says
[1:38:56] now what was that word you said
[1:39:01] and i'm like i have no idea she said
[1:39:03] well you repeated it two or three times
[1:39:07] you know you talk about feeling foolish
[1:39:10] but now saints i'm going to approach you
[1:39:12] a different fashion here don't get
[1:39:13] distracted
[1:39:16] is god not present in our church is god
[1:39:20] not present in our lives
[1:39:22] is god not moving yes changing
[1:39:25] building us up it's not the men
[1:39:28] here it's the power of god
[1:39:32] but he says i'm going to use the
[1:39:34] foolishness
[1:39:35] of preaching to bring it down and make
[1:39:38] it real to you and i
[1:39:42] and all we can say is lord you know
[1:39:46] you know lord amen amen
[1:39:49] because you see what he's done now is
[1:39:51] he's causing these people
[1:39:54] that are in this realm that they
[1:39:57] they look at everything and it doesn't
[1:39:59] fit they say well where is this and
[1:40:01] where is that
[1:40:02] and but you see god's making slow but
[1:40:04] sure
[1:40:05] the wisdom of this world foolish
[1:40:09] and the wisdom of god in verse 21 for
[1:40:11] after that in the wisdom of god the
[1:40:13] world by wisdom
[1:40:14] knew not god and it pleased god by the
[1:40:17] foolishness of preaching to save them
[1:40:19] that believe
[1:40:20] for the jews require a sign the greeks
[1:40:21] seek after wisdom
[1:40:23] but we preach christ crucified see now i
[1:40:26] want to just lay this out real quick and
[1:40:28] sum this up
[1:40:29] close here but look at this my brother
[1:40:31] and sister we preach
[1:40:32] christ crucified
[1:40:36] but every one of you as sons and
[1:40:38] daughters of god
[1:40:39] takes the word and prudently
[1:40:42] applies it to your life
[1:40:46] it's not foolishness you look at this
[1:40:49] now i'm just going to use some just base
[1:40:51] very very shallow as it were examples
[1:40:54] we realize my days go better
[1:40:57] when i pray my days go better when i
[1:41:00] read my bible
[1:41:02] my days go better when i stop
[1:41:06] and i want to say ah and i say god
[1:41:10] help us amen your days go better
[1:41:15] because we're prudently applying
[1:41:18] the word i mean
[1:41:22] maybe i could use titus for an example
[1:41:25] or something you know
[1:41:26] it'd be almost easier just to walk up to
[1:41:28] your kid
[1:41:34] but it's not what's prudent no sir
[1:41:38] but i tell you what i've seen this saint
[1:41:41] because it worked on you
[1:41:46] want people to change they say where are
[1:41:47] you going brother paul i'm just telling
[1:41:49] you the messages the prophet taught us
[1:41:52] you want to see people change what do
[1:41:55] you do
[1:41:57] you pray for amen the prudent thing to
[1:42:00] do
[1:42:01] sorry sister nadia it's one of those
[1:42:04] risks of sitting close to the front
[1:42:06] you don't come put your finger in their
[1:42:08] face
[1:42:09] and tell them what a bad person they are
[1:42:13] what you do and i'm not implying this to
[1:42:16] sister nadia
[1:42:18] what you do is you start praying amen
[1:42:22] and the more that you lift them to the
[1:42:23] throne of god
[1:42:25] the more you are changed and the more
[1:42:28] they are
[1:42:29] changed and suddenly we all feel like
[1:42:32] god's moving in our midst
[1:42:34] because we have to prudently apply the
[1:42:37] word
[1:42:38] in other words we would just supply
[1:42:40] pitchforks
[1:42:42] in the back of the church and i would
[1:42:46] pitch it off here to brother trevor and
[1:42:48] sister kerry
[1:42:51] and brother trevor and sister kerry are
[1:42:54] you both right-handed
[1:42:56] yeah okay one of you is going to have to
[1:42:58] convert
[1:43:00] because otherwise if it's right-handed
[1:43:02] you guys would be all going like this
[1:43:05] so i guess it would be coming to sister
[1:43:07] nadia and sister gabriella
[1:43:10] are you guys right-handed no
[1:43:13] gabriella i knew was left-handed
[1:43:16] maybe we will get it spread around
[1:43:21] but you see saints what do we do we
[1:43:22] prudently apply it
[1:43:25] do you know if someone offends you what
[1:43:26] the scripture says to do
[1:43:31] write a blog
[1:43:39] no it says forgive them
[1:43:43] and pray for them you see there's the
[1:43:46] prudent
[1:43:47] application of the word well they sure
[1:43:50] look like they snubbed me but
[1:43:53] they're a daughter of god they're a son
[1:43:54] of god they wouldn't have snuffed me
[1:43:58] they wouldn't have done that devil
[1:43:59] you're just trying to cause trouble
[1:44:02] come on saints i'm just hitting the very
[1:44:05] top of this
[1:44:06] see of what it is just hitting on a few
[1:44:08] of those maybe it fit i don't know
[1:44:10] but you see what we are here is
[1:44:14] the prudency of the world where they're
[1:44:16] doing everything just right
[1:44:18] god's going to break that but sons and
[1:44:21] daughters of god
[1:44:22] taking the word of god and applying it
[1:44:25] in their life
[1:44:26] it brings results hallelujah
[1:44:30] sister ruth will you come so i don't
[1:44:31] preach the other half of my sermon
[1:44:33] tonight
[1:44:34] amen
[1:44:38] no there's just going to be a day of
[1:44:39] reckoning for all the time that's being
[1:44:40] borrowed so
[1:44:42] amen i think one of the greatest wisdoms
[1:44:46] that we will ever have in this life
[1:44:50] one of the greatest mysteries that we
[1:44:52] will ever realize
[1:44:54] is who we are in jesus christ
[1:44:57] we can explain the seals and the
[1:44:59] thunders and the vials and do all of
[1:45:01] that
[1:45:02] but if we can't identify ourself
[1:45:05] clearly in the word of god
[1:45:09] oh my brother and sister let's pray to
[1:45:11] see ourselves in the will of god see his
[1:45:14] perfect will in our life
[1:45:15] because when we find that perfect will
[1:45:18] you will stand up
[1:45:20] amen you know the quote that's very
[1:45:22] favorite one many people
[1:45:25] brother brown says when we recognize
[1:45:28] who we are we will become
[1:45:32] an invincible army
[1:45:35] and to know who you are you're going to
[1:45:37] have to know god's will
[1:45:39] for your life saints pray for god's will
[1:45:43] amen it's not just about what job or
[1:45:45] where i'm going to live or what to do
[1:45:48] it goes much deeper than that hallelujah
[1:45:51] well we'll cut off here wonderful quote
[1:45:53] in jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:45:56] and forever but
[1:45:58] we're going to just leave that tonight
[1:46:00] um
[1:46:01] if it's there let's pump that up there
[1:46:03] so if you people
[1:46:05] want to go home and look for it uh to
[1:46:08] read this
[1:46:09] it's just i i love this um
[1:46:12] you see says right here oh my can i just
[1:46:15] read it without commentary
[1:46:16] i promise not to even comment we'll just
[1:46:18] read it quickly oh god
[1:46:20] such promises that the church has such a
[1:46:23] perfect
[1:46:23] redemption that's the seven seals oh i'm
[1:46:26] sorry we realize
[1:46:27] we're not worthy we'll never
[1:46:31] be worthy so the effort
[1:46:36] there's no way for us to be worthy and
[1:46:38] we're not counting
[1:46:40] on our worthiness can someone say amen
[1:46:43] we
[1:46:43] are looking to our sacrifice the lord
[1:46:45] jesus
[1:46:46] he is who we are hid in tonight
[1:46:50] we're sanctuaried in his blessed promise
[1:46:53] in his word that is our that's faith's
[1:46:56] hiding place upon the immovable rock of
[1:46:59] god's eternal word
[1:47:01] faith takes its place right there its
[1:47:03] position
[1:47:04] nothing can move it death can't shake it
[1:47:07] away
[1:47:07] the grave can't hide it it's been proven
[1:47:10] on the third day rose because the word
[1:47:12] of god said i will not leave his soul in
[1:47:14] hell
[1:47:14] neither will i suffer my holy one to see
[1:47:16] corruption there
[1:47:18] is no grave that could hold him and i'm
[1:47:21] here to tell you tonight there will be
[1:47:22] no grave hold you either

[1:47:49] the earth
[1:47:50] and we're at the end time as the wise
[1:47:52] men saw three stars line up to be one
[1:47:55] and as we see today lord the three
[1:47:57] attributes of god
[1:47:58] has finally come into the channel and we
[1:48:01] know that they
[1:48:02] are one and we see all these great signs
[1:48:04] upon the earth that's appearing in
[1:48:06] identification of the son of god
[1:48:08] dealing oh my goodness here's another
[1:48:11] doctrine we're going to just
[1:48:13] run into dealing

[1:48:25] to be the flesh of his church
[1:48:28] and here is prophetic words declaring
[1:48:32] he's going to be in the flesh of his
[1:48:35] church

[1:48:41] something else to happen no sir every
[1:48:44] one of us got our job

[1:48:48] his work

[1:48:53] quake and may there be a repentance and
[1:48:55] may there be such a healing tonight
[1:48:56] of both soul and body that men and women
[1:48:58] everywhere will come out from
[1:49:00] unbelief separate themselves and believe
[1:49:03] on the living god amen that's my heart's
[1:49:06] desire tonight saints that's just

[1:52:42] hallelujah that old man i'll tell you
[1:52:45] what the devil's got a big old notebook
[1:52:46] full of notes
[1:52:47] and he's got a name wrote on there but
[1:52:49] i'll tell you what the devil's fooled
[1:52:52] i'll tell you how he's fooled because
[1:52:53] he's got a notebook that says paul
[1:52:54] haylett on it
[1:52:57] it seems like he's identified me right
[1:52:59] paul haylett

[1:53:02] this but you know what happened
[1:53:04] the word come i went through an
[1:53:08] adoption series i come out the other
[1:53:11] side

[1:53:19] flipping over to the book of ms
[1:53:21] jesus christ he can't find
[1:53:24] nothing now if i go through the rest of
[1:53:27] my life still being the paul haylett
[1:53:30] the devil still got a list to keep but
[1:53:33] when we step over saints
[1:53:35] are you with me we step over in that new
[1:53:37] birth and that new creation
[1:53:39] we're identified entirely different god
[1:53:41] doesn't look down on you and say oh
[1:53:43] that's that little rascally
[1:53:45] no good bum no he says that one's gone
[1:53:49] that's gone i've taken this one through
[1:53:51] the blood
[1:53:52] through the new amen through the new
[1:53:55] covenants
[1:53:56] and brought it out the other side

[1:53:59] wife well hallelujah

[1:58:38] these needs amen our brother vasily on
[1:58:41] the road sister tolma in the ukraine
[1:58:43] many things happening saints for the
[1:58:46] sergey
[1:58:47] traveling i i don't know we'd have to
[1:58:49] ask sister yulia but
[1:58:51] i know that the little communication i
[1:58:54] had with brother sergey
[1:58:55] this is not just a nice little trip
[1:58:59] he rode from i can't even pronounce it
[1:59:02] probably correct
[1:59:03] kiev down to the nest
[1:59:07] stuffed in a van full of people you know
[1:59:11] not no first class train ride or bus
[1:59:13] ride or
[1:59:15] private car but stuffed in a man with a
[1:59:17] bunch of people
[1:59:19] things to take care of and decisions to
[1:59:21] make
[1:59:22] let's just remember him in prayer amen
[1:59:25] remember one another look around if you
[1:59:27] would please just remember
[1:59:28] one another in prayer we need one
[1:59:30] another brother and sister
[1:59:32] you know i shared this i think that
[1:59:33] might have been a little text sister
[1:59:35] kerry sent me
[1:59:36] but i kind of wonder saints not trying
[1:59:37] to make a doctrine but i kind of wonder
[1:59:40] if this
[1:59:44] standard that god's raising up as
[1:59:47] satan's come pouring in right
[1:59:49] now see if we're not careful we get this
[1:59:51] idea that here comes the flood
[1:59:52] and suddenly in the last minute we
[1:59:54] struggle we got something to stop the
[1:59:56] flood
[1:59:56] no i'm sorry god's got it all ready set
[1:59:59] in place
[2:00:00] now i want to just put something out to
[2:00:01] you don't make doctrine out of this
[2:00:03] please don't twist it but i would just
[2:00:04] wonder if part of that standard
[2:00:07] is that you prayed for me and me praying
[2:00:09] for you
[2:00:10] all of us right here saying i care
[2:00:13] enough i love them enough
[2:00:15] i'll lift them up in prayer and we're
[2:00:17] over here struggling
[2:00:19] it feels like oh something's happened
[2:00:21] you know and this is wrong and that's
[2:00:22] wrong and oh lord why and what
[2:00:25] and somebody's over here praying and
[2:00:28] that
[2:00:29] standard is somehow buttressing
[2:00:33] us
[2:00:37] i believe i just believe that's part of
[2:00:39] it
[2:00:40] but god said i'll place people in your
[2:00:42] life
[2:00:44] that will lift you up and in your time
[2:00:47] of need their prayers will be right
[2:00:48] there
[2:00:51] that's what you call unity in the body
[2:00:54] god bless you saints we love you in the
[2:00:56] lord and just pray
[2:00:57] have a lovely rest of the week come
