shoulder he said and turned him around and he was walking back down there and he looks at that because he begins to remember about the boy he says all my Christian friends it's me a little gets a little excited here but it made me think of this song the love of God here all my Christian friends I hope that someday if not here we will in another land when that feeling comes to you when you know no amen I wish I could have that feeling all the time Hallelujah if I could it's something it's love it's like a real deep love and if the devil would have sent all of his imps out of torment and

us amen hallelujah I've got several things I need to announce or share with you if you don't mind being seated I kind of don't want to break the atmosphere but I need to just kind of cover a couple things here amen just want to first off greed sister Allison sister Becky I hear you guys had a good time at camp and pray that the trip and the labors were worth that and uh that's beautiful our our brother Roman uh uh I don't know that he looks older this morning but I I think he has a sister that's told on him and shared with the world how much she loves her brother amen I want to speak to you for just a moment uh on the fact we're going to have this camp out this coming week uh weekend and um pardon me for speaking maybe a little strong but um the roads are not that scary amen so every one of you that would have opportunity to come I I want I would like to see you come it'd be a good time some of you can't and we understand that there's obligations but a lovely time there in the mountains and it's just going to be camping out it's not really Church camp it's just camping out with some devotions a Sunday morning time Etc so I want to encourage each and every one that would be able to now I've mentioned to Brother David for those of you that will not be able to go uh there will be church here at the the sanctuary at the Tabernacle here Brother David has been um I I say this tongue-in-cheek please don't take me serious but he's been on holiday and um not not most enjoyable holiday but he's been on holiday and and so uh he's just uh you know buckle up because he hasn't preached in quite a while and we know her brother David when he's when he's got that much stored up he's going to give you the whole Haystack amen but that's good yes just pray for him amen because he can feed it one bale at a time amen but uh I I say that with humor amen but brother David's going to to be holding service here at the Tabernacle and uh brother Tim is going to be leading songs and I meant to speak to you sister Ruth before service but um if she would play the piano for her dad and uncle uh it would be much appreciated otherwise there'll be no piano player so no pressure sister Ruth anyway so uh just it would be nice uh to to just all of you that are not in Camp uh camping out please come amen join together be in support of one another amen I give you greetings from brother Danny Stevens uh communicating with him just a little bit it would be my heart's desire to get brother Danny to come out west he says it has to be when the weather is warm but we don't know warm like they know warm so I don't know what it will be I might volunteer to buy him a coat and mittens when he when he gets here but anyway just remember them and their church just like us the devil's just outside the door trying to get in he's pounding on the door you know I'm at a huff and puff and I'm going to blow this church down but what he doesn't realize it's God on the inside amen it's not man in the inside trying to hold it together it's God on the inside holding it together and so just give you greetings from brother Danny amen we have on the backboard a card uh in appreciation from Brother John Andes and the end time message Tabernacle for the gift of support as God opened a door for them to go from renting a community center where they had no need for any tables chairs Etc and then God opened door for them to have their own church and they had nothing and you as a a group as an assembly have given an offering and that card is on the backboard if you want to read it amen so just uh uh we we just want to help our body of Believers when we were uh first purchased this church and we couldn't afford to put carpet in it they was those who gave liberally to us to put carpet in our church and and so we just uh you know as it is uh reciprocating with other uh Believers amen and uh we want to remember uh our brother Vitale and family uh as they will be on Tuesday Morning very very early uh getting on an airplane and uh Lithuania and flying and we'll be arriving here in Boise that Tuesday evening so let's just pray for traveling mercies for them and if all goes Lord willing Ellen goes according to plan brother Vitale will preach for us this coming Wednesday amen also on Tuesday our brother Stan price and his wife who have never been West and uh so they're they're coming to see the west and we're going to give them uh between Brother David Nash Brother Rich Etc we're going to give them a lovely welcome to the west of vacation I think he's only going to preach five times while he's out here so um anyway remember brother Stana and his wife as they also on Tuesday morning I would be getting on a plane and flying out amen I can't think of anything else I've forgotten um let's just stand and turn in the word this morning I want to thank you sister Sarah and brother Titus amen uh I want to speak to you this morning on Pleasure with a price amen and um it's kind of a a two-edged thought because we're going to look at things and and it might almost seem like we're just looking in a negative connotation but we're not because my brother and sister uh these things uh that Satan is doing in this day he without imagination I want you to catch this the fact Satan has no imagination Satan has no creative power and so what he does is just sits back and says oh I see what God's doing I will come up with my own version of that and that's the world we live in you know um when Tonka when I was a little boy Tonka toys was all the rage for little kids right and Tonka built there back in that day the indestructible medal uh dump truck and bulldozer and Etc right they were meant they used to say they're meant to last for Generations but they didn't understand American kids especially boys and they managed to you know tear them up later they said well we can't sell them a hundred dollar dump truck people won't buy it so they started making it you know in a different fashion and then the rest of the world said look what they have there they have something that people are just buying and buying and then imitation come and the imitation since we're always cheaper than the original and then people who imitated the imitators had to say we got to be cheaper than that and that's why today saints that church looks more like entertainment yeah because they had to keep bringing it something more so I don't know this this doesn't like me today I think it's because I'm wearing a suit coat anyway now we have nothing it's working okay so the day that we're living in Satan is coming with the imitation and he is trying how about we took the suit coat off and see if that fixes it that'll make me happy amen so we see that Satan trying to imitate and uh everything that he does he just looks up and and he says this is what God's doing right now the world's having the identity crisis because the bride is seeing who she is amen and you can we won't go through the whole thing but you can see every one of these parallels amen the world is is uh presenting this whole gender issue because the bride male and female is seeing that she is the feminine part of Christ and Satan said oh if men big Burly husky men can identify themselves in the feminine identification as the bride of Christ I'm going to take Mankind and cause them to think they're a woman it all ties perfectly together we think that the devil has brewed up something special to to deceive the world no my brother and sister he's looking at what God's doing and saying I've got to have a counterpart to that amen amen let's turn in our Bibles today to Second Timothy the third chapter quite a lengthy reading here 1-14 uh but we'll just go through the first seven verses and then we'll be seated amen Hallelujah this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come are they here amen for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection I just read a deal the other day my brother and sister a man went from a doting father now this is a little blunt but I'm going to share it he went from a doting father one day to kill his three sons the next day what happened I'm going to get ahead of myself but I want to share it to you in the sermon today I don't have the fullness of that but speaking of The Prodigal Son I clipped the little piece out of it because there's only so much time and I should have just put it in and shared it with you but the prophet of God talking about the prodigal son says there's a little mama and she's like I wonder what my son is tonight now this sun is snuggled up in the pig pen to stay warm eating with the pigs and Mama's saying I wonder where my son is tonight and a dad saying yes yes and they got down I'm paraphrasing it they got down and started praying and during the night not a Revival service not a great phenomena taking place but in the night prayers reach the Throne of almighty God and the scripture tells us that the next day he woke and come to himself amen because the power of prayer is greater than the spirit of laodicea and we should not forget that we should not allow all of these negative connotations to take away the fact that our God is on the scene he's the same God Amen Hallelujah without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good Traders heady high-minded lovers of pleasure Pleasures more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away my brother and sister the word says don't go embrace them it says turn away from that spirit amen four of this sort are they which creep into houses and Lead captive silly churches yes and no we're not going to substitute churches to say that's what it meant here it's talking about silly women but remember the church is identified in a feminine form and so they're creeping in deceiving whole churches tearing whole churches apart the very fiber amen they creep into houses lead captive silly women Laden with sins LED away with divers loss ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth and I'm sorry to keep you standing but I'm going to make an emphasis right here it didn't say they didn't have truth they have truth but they're not coming to knowledge of that truth in other words it's never been open to them and they can walk away and say this is not real this is not this it's this it's this and the reason they can say that my brother and sister because they never met Christ amen the prophet of God didn't say I come to introduce you William Branham I come to introduce you to Jesus Christ and they never got past the preacher the building or the prophet they never got on to Christ because if they had they would realize that the messenger can have flaws but the message is perfect amen hallelujah sorry I'm getting excited now as Janus and jamboree's withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith Heavenly Father we just ask for your blessings this morning Lord lead us guide us today Lord open the word to us and may father when we walk out of church today may we be able to say with a clear Heart Lord in conviction it was good to be in the house of God today Lord we love you we adore you and we come before you now in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Saints now the scripture tells us here gives us a clear identity to go back and and be able to read what the spirit and what will be taking place in this day is it says now as Janus and jamboree's withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds represent reprobate concerning the faith but they shall proceed no further you see here that the scripture is giving us a declaration that God's only going to let this go so far and when it comes concerning Sons and Daughters of God Amen there will be a place that we can be buffeted there's a time that Satan can come and bring doubts he can bring fears he can bring anxieties but my brother and sister the word of God says he's never lost a one so we do not have to then become anxious about what is going on in our world if things are buffeted we can stop and say Lord you made a promise I'm standing on that promise amen now you proceed no further for their Folly shall be manifest unto all men as theirs also was and I want you just for a minute I'm not trying to be political in the Pulpit but my brother and sister were seeing as time goes on here Ministries that had uh you might say a distorted view of what this message was about Ministries that never let go of denomination they had certain things that they held opinions Etc and time is revealing those that time is bringing out and all of this is becoming the Folly is becoming manifest and you say but brother Paul their churches are still full of people my brother and sister are you going to recognize that God knows who are his own and these people are anointed maybe they have that same exact spirit so therefore they're attracted and so it's there that if they're not God will come in the word will be spoken one day and then it will affect them such amen I just remember a time and a place won't go into the whole story but to have a brother this is in South America have a brother come to me and say I'm Ben x amount of years in this Doctrine and tonight God is revealed to me that I have been in the wrong place and I've wasted all these years and and God spoke to me and I spoke back to him and I said no brother the time was not wasted you have been being constructed by the word of God even though it was seemingly in this other Doctrine but you've been being constructed and as it is that God will bring you to a place now that all of those things in your past will be a benefit in other words I couldn't come and speak to your brother-in-law and to your father-in-law and to your sister and those I can't speak to them but now that God's opened your eyes you can speak to them the door will be open for you whether it's at a family function or they start to question why did you change and so God allows us to be schooled in the word and it's never wasted amen God doesn't say I'm going to send Moses to the max side of the desert and just let him waste a way out there until the season comes to use him but God sent him to the max side of the desert because he needed a certain kind of training amen we read that quote here the other day that God was there started the Bush on fire to catch Moses attention and my brother and sister I don't know what the bush is in your life today but God will get our attention amen and so we see that these will not proceed no further God's getting attention of the Bride she's starting to see these things amen but thou Hast fully known now we're seeing a little shift in what is being Spoken Here but thou Hast fully known my Doctrine this is pretty confident my brother and sister God didn't God didn't bring some wishy-washy Messengers and and apostles and disciples on this scene God brought men that had courage and I saved God increase my courage amen and he said but thou Hast fully known my Doctrine manner of life purpose Faith long-suffering charity and patience what is he doing it was already mentioned this morning I got a little excited right there you know what it is my brother and sister all of this is being shown right out of our life right here in the world today we go to work amen I've never been a doctor in the hospital I've never been you know uh you just name it uh in a program or I've I've done certain things but you see there's places where God places each one to be there to manifest the very life you imagine me brother Trevor cutting a uh someone's hair amen I'll tell you what probably be a a big lawsuit and if I did more than one it would it would become a you know a class action suit amen so I will never meet those people I will never do that just vice versa amen I tell you my brother and sister but God says I'm going to show your Doctrine amen let me speak it that way it's possessive right it's not our Doctrine it's God's Doctrine but when we have it in us and we are living it it becomes our Doctrine we're identified with it amen and I want it to be that the world would know your Doctrine amen and would know your manner of life would know your purpose your faith your long-suffering your charity and your patience amen I'll tell you what my brother and sister I hope oh brother Trevor sister carry no mind but I tell you they had a son that was struggling with some things and and there was a need that was there and they went and they embraced their son and we as a church prayed I kept it as pretty much a simple uh we need just to remember but my brother and sister we got to see God come on the scene we're going to see God answer the prayer of the Saints and my brother and sister God will give by many infallible proofs and sometimes we think those infallible proofs have to be the supernatural lightning in the sky a fire coming down but sometimes those infallible proofs is to a young man that has a need and there's a prayer that goes forward and God comes and answers the prayer and there will be no denying that it was God that answered the prayer anymore Hallelujah infallible proofs persecutions afflictions which come unto me at Antioch it in him Elijah what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me I want you to catch the context of this you know I just I never got out of school I barely got out of English class but I'm telling you when you look at this it almost thinks that you almost think that this is about the author but when it comes down he's really this last line I Endure these but the butt puts everything in context out of them all the real context of that statement is the Lord delivered me Hallelujah not to look at the man not to look at you and I but to look at the Lord he's the one that delivers and I say thank you Lord because when I could not deliver myself he has come on the scene and delivered me amen yea and all that live Godly in Christ shall suffer persecution kind of like praying for patience no no not I got enough problems about praying for patience well God knows what you need he's going to give you patience whether you want to claim it or not so you might as well say Lord give me patience amen oh no that's gonna be too much you know it won't be any more than God would laid on you in anyway amen you'll not put anything on you that you cannot endure so just pray for it Lord if I need patience if I need whatever I need Lord just please give it to me well I mean we can run from it maybe what we ought to do is just have a little church camp out track meet and see what can outrun what amen our very thoughts as they come from our our mind are discerned at the Throne of God outrun that one you can't get beyond that you cannot out think God you cannot outrun God you cannot outmaneuver God amen so we might as well surrender to God but evil men and seducers shall wear wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived that's this really sad verse right there 13 that the deceiver who comes with that mouth intent is going to end up waking up one day and realize he himself was deceived that's kind of like the guy jumping into yeah you know I was joking with a brother the other day I made some wisecrack about Amway and he goes whoa whoa whoa brother Paul I I'm a member of Amway I was like oh you and the other half of America and he goes well they have some good products and I'm not trying to make money from it but you see my brother and sister every kind of natural thing like that well what is it they say follow the money we're not exempt we're not exempt that's why we as a body of believers have to I looked at brother George he left his level here by accident but then he told me I probably needed it and so you know I don't know if he meant I needed it for you or needed it for me so I'm just gonna surround all of us you know that we gotta remain in Balance if we lose our balance we go one way or the other way you know they put a crown on every road so the water will run off if you just let go of the steering wheel on your car going down the freeway amen you will find your car will go One Direction or the other it'll come to the curves and maybe it'll just go straight whatever will happen maybe you'll never make it to the Curve but you look at this you see these people evil men and seducers are going to be worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but I want to throw this out if I could for a moment you don't have to research very far to find in the world of the mega church that everybody's so proud they've got product lines mugs and t-shirts and all kinds of products and their own notebooks and their own whatevers that they're doing in promoting this my brother and sister what you see is these people unashamedly are taking advantage of the people and imagine standing in shoes like that on Judgment Day I mean after all I won't go there but continue thou in the things I want you to I want you to really shift gears here but continue thou speaking to you continue thou in the things which thou Hast learn and hath been assured of knowing of whom now has learned them amen what do we do we get anchored in the word of God and it doesn't matter what's going on out there my brother and sister it doesn't matter what's happening in this world in this government in all of these things what has happened is we've had a sure word come in our day a word of Prophecy of a god-vindicated prophet that come down and said here it is I'm going to introduce you today to Jesus Christ and when people can turn around and walk away my brother and sister the introduction did not take hold but let me say it again continue thou on the things which thou has learned and has been assured of now is this Paul David Chris assuring you no this is the Holy Ghost we can't even truly say that Jesus is the Christ without the Holy Ghost so people can voice that they can speak that out but without the Holy Ghost the revelation of Jesus being Christ is not real to them they are speaking words that's called intellectualism but continue thou which thou has learned and has been assured of knowing of whom thou Hast learned them amen now I want to just uh kind of take this if you would that picture that we're we're looking at here actually looks a little bit Bleak because this all this scripture talking about what the spirits of the day will be of the age will be and how all this will be of uh people being lovers of pleasure loving themselves truce Breakers ungodly my brother and sister all of that breaking down we look out and and it's like my where's the world going to and you see how this is it is starting to look kind of Bleak but it gives a very clear picture you don't have to search very far when you look at that to recognize as this is the picture of the day we live in it's right here before us and if we can't see that then God help us because it's right there in front of us amen and so as we look at that and recognize the spirits of our day but as I opened with you I want you to realize that if you will go back in your time and read those scriptures and reverse every single one of those turn every one of those over amen and look at that and you'll see what the effect of the word is having on the bride of Christ amen this bride is not a truce breaker she has bound herself to Christ amen this bride does not love herself she loves Jesus Christ amen you know every one of those turn it over so the word is showing us the counter effect that the devil is using against the word in this hour amen many of these people fortunate to say will actually attend church every Sunday and suffer from these symptoms right here amen now first Timothy 5 verses 6 and 7. now we'll look at this that when one is living uh you know the world we're living in today as it said in previous verse there lovers of pleasure my brother and sister we live in a day that is so pressurized people are just losing their minds people going crazy right and left all the way back in the 60s brother Branham said you know the half of America at that time has to take a pill to go to bed at night they got to take a pill to get up and you just go do the homework yourself if you care to and you'll find that those numbers have steadily risen through the years they didn't go away Amen in our very sophisticated Society it's not declining it's increasing because one they have not found a way to let off the pressure and another is they're caught up in pleasure First Timothy 5 6 and 7 but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth and these things give in charge that they may be blameless amen so there is read the whole scripture go back and tie it I'm pulling this out for time but you see my brother and sister as you speak to the bride of Christ she has to recognize the symptom otherwise God would just put you and I somewhere where we'd be oblivious to what's happening in the world but God makes us aware sometimes even manifested in our own life that we would stop and say wait that's how I'm acting and we can be corrected right we say Lord help me I got a spirit of laodicea I've got this Spirit that's maybe causing me to to speak in a certain way I don't know I'm not trying to be legalist here but maybe your music is slipping maybe your conversation is slipping maybe you're the way you dress is slipping or now you know we talk is slipping my brother and sister what we allow in our house maybe is slipping a little bit and God is going to speak to you and I and catch our attention to draw us back and say that is not beneficial to you that is not bringing you into my presence I am not pleased with that and that's a God that loves you amen that's not legalism that's not law that's not control my brother and sister that's love amen so he's telling us here that that she that's living in pleasure is dead while she's living and that is a clear symptom of laodicea she is living in pleasure and she is dead now my brother and sister it's there that we'll look at this a person in this position pays with a higher value than they will ever receive they pay a higher price than they will ever receive so it is that pleasure has a price and it's there that when we get caught up in the spirit of laodicea you know we we feel like uh and we'll read a quote here in a minute I've got to let off the pressure and I you know I need to do something to release my mind and if we're not careful we'll find ourselves drifting into things that that are not pleasing to God and we justify it because I need to let off the pressure but it's there in the world that we're living that we'll see if Satan can coax you and I to come over and is is this sense um I'm ahead of myself I I don't rather back up or just plow forward amen but you know it's this position you know no one ever likes now you can get a little carried away like Paul will spend 10 hours on the computer trying to save five bucks I didn't pay very good dividend did it sometimes you're just better off to say okay I'm just gonna I'm gonna do this and what happens is as we find ourselves moving into a position and we don't even realize we're paying a higher price than that will ever return back to us now as a farmer I sometimes joke that we are of a culture by high sell low amen remain in business while it lasts but my brother and sister that's not spiritually quantifiable amen you cannot pay a price that has no return so we invest in the world we uh let ourselves be drawn into the world our Focus becomes the world what is the return she's living she's in pleasure but she's dead amen and that is what Satan's trying to do now let's just go on right here in the resurrection of Lazarus you know I would encourage each one of you to just go and and listen to this uh it's just uh very very good sermon amen now some people you know say well we don't listen anything uh before 63 uh you know that's when real Revelation come my brother and sister Revelation is through this message beginning to end amen and you throw out all of the previous stuff you'll find just like those who like to read the last chapter of the book because it's a waste of time to read the first chapter we'll find there's details they've missed and that's what the message is amen Christians do not die there's no scripture in the Bible that says Christians Christians die a man a person that lives in pleasure is dead while they're living death means separation separation from God and sinners are not Sinners are separated from from God but Christians never separate from God they just leave the body here to be with the Lord amen I tell you why that's why we don't fear God I mean fear death that's why we're not afraid of what tomorrow will be amen now remember last Wednesday I believe it was I read a quote to you about how brother branham's laying it down and says that there are names that can never be removed from the Lamb's Book of Life now my brother and sister he's just not talking to the Christian Church nominal amen he is talking to the people amen the people of the book and when he speaks or you use that phrase the people of the book some people would say Well they're talking of the Bible and in a sense that would be true but really it's literally identifying those names in the Lamb's Book of Life are the people of the book those are the ones that Satan would love to deceive they're the ones that say Satan we're just trying to find any way to get them to pull back and to hold back now my brother and sister I want to just throw this out to you this morning that if Satan can get you to not exercise the gift God has given you now the gift he has given you and I is the ability to live a Christian life amen there is an all-encompassing gift that he has given us amen because even the prophet says that the gift of the Holy Ghost is in a sense temporal right it's the soul that God's after he's not looking down saying they were anointed they were anointed my brother and sister the prophet of God says that doesn't mean anything it's the soul that God is after and it's the soul that the devil's after so if the devil can get you and I to not exercise the gift and the gift I want to express to you this morning is our ability to believe the word amen that is a gift that comes from God it wasn't because we were born with a certain Intel act or a certain ability but it was a gift from God that we could receive the word and say Amen to it amen and so as it is we'll see this gift and if Satan can come and get us to move over in a position where you don't fully exercise the gift that God has given you the ability to take every single word of God and say Amen to it Lord help us Lord help us to be able to say Amen to every word not by rote not just say amen amen amen amen and think you covered it it's got to come from the heart it's going to come out of the Soul amen and Satan would like to separate you now if you have anything to do with business or just good Common Sense we realize that there is um those names that were taken out of the book my brother and sister are not going to remain as it is as they were Judas from a matter of fact Judas was there there he had a holy ghost Ministry but there was an underlying uh something bothering Judas where he could not say Amen to every word and as time went that first little bit of holding back that first little bit of questioning what Jesus said uh the first little bit of Separation that come my brother and sister that didn't just get stopped and solidified right there and never went on and he always had just this question that's why the word of God the prophet of God tells us if there's something you don't understand don't get all carried away with that take that put it on the shelf and God will come in the right season and verify that to you amen but what happens people got to have the answer and I want it now and so they start digging and they can't move they're not in the spirit so they can't move in the realm of the spirit to get the answer so they go over here in the intellect and start digging in to find an answer in the intellect but the intellect can't go where God is wanting to take you and I amen the intellect amen man's thinking cannot go into Heavenly places and so when we find ourselves caught up and questioning we need to stop and say am I actually in the intellect or in myself or am I in the spirit amen and you'll find that when we'll submit ourself in that the spirit will bring us right back and God who is faithful never lost a one will bring us right back in the channel and then we'll be reading we'll be listening we'll be hearing preacher whatever it might be and God will lay that in there and you'll say that's what it was amen because God is faithful amen now you look at this my brother and sister a return on investment let's talk about pleasure is pleasure wrong no what is wrong the perversion of pleasure anything we put between us and God is an idol and sometimes it's pleasure sometimes cares of life these different things like that I don't this morning want to go and describe each one because we could just have a all-encompassing list but my brother and sister a return on investment as you would very well be able to discern is that whatever effort investment of money time emotion of your spirit when you do that what do you get back how personal do we go when we get angry I'm going to throw sister Jerry under the bus she's got her armor on today when we sow love what do we get in return love when we sow start naming them off when a man so is investment in a wife that shows that he loves her he cares for her he's supporting her he gets all of these beautiful gifts in return he has a nice kitchen for her he gets good food back a nice house for her he has a place to come home and be comfortable and all of these little things he gets to enjoy from the investment but if and sister Jerry is like Paul I need you to read this and right at the bottom of that list it says if you sow frustration to your wife what will you get from your wife in return and sister Jerry I'm throwing you under the bus baby she's just like read this Paul come on Paul read this read it again but my brother and sister I needed to read that because sometimes we don't realize what it is we're actually sowing but we don't like the return wow my wife is almost like rebellious I mean she's mouthy and she's this and that what are you sowing I go to church and there's problem here at the church and problem there at the church a problem with this and a problem with that and a real problem with the priest what are you sowing come on this is a principle of God this is not some preacher's opinion my brother and sister that we will reap what we sow and I say God help me God help me I want to sow the right things I want to see the power of God move in Grace Tabernacle so what I've got to do is sow a consecrated life in the word to bring it to you that you would be able to receive that in the right spirit and take it home not cause I said it not because brother Branham said it because the word of God said it and we take that home and it starts to bring forth a harvest and that Harvest will either make us bitter and secluded or that Harvest will make us happy oh my goodness my brother and sister so what is the return on investment of pleasure well we would look at this for a moment and say well that pleasure doesn't bring much but just give me time here this morning if you would please amen so it's there that this uh return on investment we have to look at this what are we sowing and what do we expect to reap we don't grow soybeans out west here but soybean seed is cheaper than corn seed so I think I'm going to sow soybean seed because it's cheaper and I'm going to get the Columbine ready for corn it's not going to work not going to work we're going to harvest what it is we've invested in now look what Satan's trying to do as we've already read the definition there death being Eternal separation definitely not profitable is it be separated from the presence of God a man could have millions he could have the finery of Life give his wife big diamonds and the highest of fashion uh all of the all of these things I just seen a little deal the other day the man had just spent lavish amount money on his wife and she hired a Hitman knocked him off because she didn't want to live love it she wanted it all Hallelujah so you know you got to be careful that you know he thought that for all of his misbehavior a diamond would balance that he thought for all of his indiscretion that a Rolls-Royce or it was a Bentley I mean uh would would offset that but her resentment built up to such a level everything's more important than me she had enough money she figured she'd get it all but what she didn't realize is life insurance never pays out when the spouse kills the spouse but she did get 45 years of free room and board so in this time of inflation well anyway but now look what Satan's trying to do he's trying to separate you and I but he can't that's the beauty of it my brother and sister your name as a prophet said cannot be taken from the Lamb's Book of Life so the separation that Satan is seeking he cannot accomplish because the prophet of God give us a Clear Vision amen aren't you glad God's got binoculars that look through time and understand what we don't understand and the prophet of God said no those names cannot under any circumstance be removed from the book and I say Lord I claim that position I claim my position as one who can never be separated from the presence of God Amen but as a devil he's coming he's trying to separate you have any of you ever experienced that the devil's just trying to influence you cause you to pull back cause you to not want to Fellowship cause you to not want to pray not read your Bible just pull back from everything he's trying to separate but what he doesn't realize is he cannot do that for a real son or daughter of God and Satan in his effort to separate my brother and sister has come he can't separate you so he's going to convince you to separate yourself because he's smart enough to realize I don't have the authority I'd have to go in there and take the book and then ask God would you mind scratching that name out one he doesn't even have authority to take the book you'll find nowhere my brother and sister that he can take the book so what does he do he works overtime trying to convince you and I that the investment as a blood-bought believer see here's where we come in the conflict people say Christian my brother and sister in the day we live in Christian is defined now under these new liberal definitions as anyone who believes there is a God the Devil by these terms would be a Christian because the devil knows God is real and he knows God's power and authority is he a believer oh I got you on that one he is a believer but I'm I'm tricking you here so pardon me he's a Believer he knows he knows he can't separate you from the love of God but ain't gonna stop him from trying and he believes if he stays after it long enough makes your life difficult enough throws enough roadblocks in your way that you yourself will give up oh isn't that a clever devil well he wasn't clever enough my brother and sister to be able to work around the Holy Ghost around the opening of the word amen so I want you to look at these trials and struggles that you have sometimes that feel so difficult feel like you're overwhelmed and I just want you to remember that that's just the devil trying to convince you to give up convince you to walk away because he's certainly not convincing God he can't now in the sermon presuming sorry about that brother get in I'll beat you to the punch in his way of trying to deceive or Draw us away comes along with all kinds of clever little tactics now I know that that we are not a television people but I know for a fact of how the world is in television and they will take something that might be on television that's interesting to people and then they will insert an ad of somebody standing there cutting up you know a tomato one of the softest things there is and they'll tell you we have this set of knives not for only 29.95 each month you can have these knives that never get dull and they present it in such a fashion that people are like our knives are dull I can't even cut a tomato I don't eat tomatoes but I can't cut a tomato give me a set of knives 29.95 for six months yeah I don't care that's only 30 bucks and they get these knives that won't cut nothing and they say well I'll just return them and a year later they're still fighting to get their money back how clever Satan markets how clever he presents his program that people jump in and the prophet of God reminded us that sin will take us further than we want to go and there's been many an individual that's been caught in that amen so look at this they call it a little clean fun a little pleasure that people have to have to give vent now we're going to get personal who of us need event yeah I think everyone here if we're honest we need event well good let's find the correct event amen let's not find the devil's version of event amen now lesbian what if all that's a pleasure that a person ever got out of life what pleasure would it be to blanking your mind so blank you don't even know what you're doing then call it pleasure now you know that's it so let me share this I'm just full of all kinds of things today I'm sorry but when I I was still doing construction work so it's been a few years ago I worked with a couple young men and I remember one day where there I think we're pounding nails and the one guy is like oh my head's hurting and so you realize these two young men had been to the same party and the one young man turns to the other one while we're working and says wow wasn't that an awesome party and the other guy was like yeah yeah it was great well I guess I don't know I passed out did we have fun I remember it struck me I thought here it is he's taken himself the blanking of his mind so blank he don't even know what you're doing then call it pleasure he gulped down so much alcohol then in just a little while he passes out and he's laying on the floor and his friend says I I grabbed you by the hands and Drug you over behind the couch so they wouldn't step on you oh that was so much fun so much fun that pleasure had a price he was there finally he told the boss ah I've got a headache and the boss says Oh you mean hangover no no headache I needed to take a sick day the boss just like get out of here you're not doing anything anyway just go don't even know what you're doing now I could see men of the world doing that but when it comes to the church doing that people who call themselves Christians then it goes to show that there's been a letdown somewhere because that's not the way you forget sin my brother and sister we're not drinkers but we can find things to crowd into our mind into our life trying to do this well the pressure is so great I've got to deal with these things my brother and sister I'm guilty of this sometimes you get engrossed in things and it's there and you what we should do is go let off the pressure amen but it's their see and so what happens is we'll see all kinds of things take place that's why you should never when you're in that state of mind go to a car lot a place that sells recreational vehicles boats trains planes and maybe not even a grocery store boil those Oreos I'll tell you this is not funny but it is funny took our granddaughter to Arizona with us and she was not their home from Mexico but very very tired and not feeling well but you know my granddaughter was just a horrible influence on me because you know I'm in the store I'm a little bit bored you know and we're walking through a grocery store and we walk by the Oreos and I I was like I hear the Oreos calling my name my granddaughter's right behind me yeah Grandpa the Oreos are calling your name you need to respond to them and I hate to admit this because I know better my brother and sister we ate like two or three packages of Oreos in a week amen now look because we're allowing different things to come in and influence us and then we're trying to satisfy that but we're not of this world Amen so we cannot use the world's recipe to satisfy the longing of our soul amen so that's why the world today is doing what they're doing did you know right now that repossessions of automobiles are going up and you know one of the major automobiles that are being repossessed right now uh the ones that are going to save the planet can anybody tell me what those are Tesla Gonna Save the Planet but repossession of Teslas is going through the roof because people said oh I need to do this good thing and this thing and besides that they're cool but I'm doing it for the environment and to look cool I mean I and now this is the repercussion because if 11 000 miles in three months you have to give it back means you could not afford it in the beginning so what are they doing they're trying to satisfy something inside of them the pleasure that they found by buying this car and I'll be honest with you there's something euphoric about that amen something very euphoric about buying that I mean it all I don't know that the number matters but just buying something there's a little euphoric because a little something goes with that you know bought a chopper one time spent a few hundred thousand dollars wrote the check I didn't even make it home sister Jerry and I had been in in Colorado to look at this didn't he make it home and I'm having buyers more how am I going to pay for this thing what am I doing why did I sign what did I Mom what's going on here because there's something there this is what I need this is what I want and Satan uses that now you see that that Spirit come right into the church and so that's not the way you forget your sins that's right sinning will never cause us to forget our sins but they're on God's book and the only way they can ever be gotten rid of is to put in the sea of forgetfulness the blood of Jesus Christ then remembered against you no more Can someone say Amen Lord hallelujah that's the only way but they presume that the right way to do it it the right way the regular the people does it so we're just well everybody this this what they're doing this what they do this what they do this what they do my brothers and sister we weren't called to be like them amen sister Jerry and I on our way to church just passing by a certain church and we're commenting about the parking lot is getting Fuller and Fuller and Fuller sister Jerry in in a bit of humor says yes maybe they subscribe to that three-part deal of growing your church but my brother and sister if that's the way we grow our church what are we doing we're getting numbers that's right and when we sing the song I'm in that number it's not talking about the number of the grow the church amen this is in the bloodbot number amen this is the number that has found what they need in Jesus Christ amen now let me get this so I hope I kind of butcher that up but I hope you you're catching that my brother and sister because you see if the church lets down the people typically will either have to leave to find truth or they'll let down with the church so as we look at this let me just move forward once again I want to say pleasure has a price what is the return on that investment did you know that the believer receives more than they ever paid I have got an investment this morning for you that will give you returns so much greater than you ever paid because we had a debt that we could not pay and now that debt is paid and the return on the investment do you think Jesus Christ went to Calvary which was just the Earthly expression of what took place before the foundation of the world did he go to Calvary hoping you would come and serve him no sir our God is a sure thing investor amen he poured out his Precious Blood at Calvary and he knew that there was a seed a bride a body a believer that would respond to that and she would come and she would give her life and invest it back into Christ because she is so thankful and loves him amen and there's where the investment comes by and gone now I know that's kind of maybe a rude way to put it to put God as an investor but I'm telling you he was willing to pour his blood out to see you and I redeemed and he said that we were the very apple of his eye amen and as us almost David put it it was not just some common Apple that will rot away but it was Apples of gold uh or I got that right yeah amen so my brother and sister it is there that it's not just a simple investment that he just hoped he knew thank you Lord you knew I would serve you you knew amen hallelujah and when our debt was too great he paid it now I want to draw out of the prodigal here as we just move right along amen here in the prodigal brother Branham talking about the Prodigal Son it's also incredible go study it listen to it if you don't have a whole lot of time just go about 10 paragraphs in front of this and 10 paragraphs behind this and you'll find that very awesome reading I was first converted a young lady come and said brother Branham what pleasure do you get out of life if you don't smoke drink or go to the shows or anything you know when I started working my way back to Christ one of the greatest struggles I had was music I hit it well I didn't flaunt it in front of my wife I didn't want to subject my children to it but I had a music Problem I hope you see the humor I've got corrected by a couple mothers here in the church for even bringing up the history of Music problems when their children were walking around the home singing a little lyric line then it's like brother Paul don't do that ever again please so my brother and sister I'm even you know God's kicking the dregs out yeah I thought I'd got rid of the dregs right but God's kicking the dregs out to even bother making reference of these terms that were anointed by the devil to anoint a whole world to yield to the devil amen so you look at this and you realize that there are certain things that we have to be careful that the pleasure we extract is not in some way connected to our past made me feel good when I was out in the world unsaved still kind of makes me feel good now what is that anointing on the flesh the flesh sister Jerry and I was at the Science Center and it's so interesting because they have you can make different selections of music and they have this steel filings and this music is is the steel filings have a mild magnetic attraction because just holding them there and then you play Beethoven and there push the button down now and these things are like and I'm like I used to like that song what was it doing to me it wasn't bringing peace wasn't bringing comfort it was anointing me to take radical actions yeah can't tell you how many times as a teenager driving when you drive out to brother Adams sister Sarah's that Highway used to be just a little narrow thing with a huge drain ditch and and seemed like it was foggier back then I don't know do you guys have fog now I still do okay but you know that road was a little narrow road and I can't tell you how many times as a teenager driving down that road my pickup listen that music and I get home and if my parents say one word to me I'm just gonna shut the music off walk in the house we told you to be home at 10 I'm sorry where did that rebellious anointing come from not music and the spirit that came with it because as soon as I was shut off the Rebellion laughed and I knew I was supposed to be home at 10. hmm so here it is what pleasure do you get out of life if you don't smoke drink or go to shows or anything in a few nights after that about eight or ten Sinners come to the Altar and I said I have no more pleasure in that in one minute that you could have in the world in 10 years lost coming to God that's where we have pleasure is in the things of God my brother and sister are we a different class of people are you weird yes you're weird not to God to the world the world has turned the church into a lodge that is trying to give pleasure to the people when the pleasure should be in Jesus Christ when the pleasure should be in serving him and the pleasure should be in his presence the pleasure should be in calling out his name and reading his word but the pleasure becomes an activity that we're always reaching out trying to do that and you'll see the a church I listened to an interview of a man who's got a church that has now surpassed 5 000 people and they said how have you done this so quickly and he says I have found what the people want he didn't say what they need my brother and sister I found what the people want and we give them what they want oh I need the Holy Ghost I need Jesus Christ in my life and there's not I'm sorry to say this not every day of my life do I want that amen there's days I just think I'm such a way I'm going to turn and walk away I can't do this I'm not worthy and so my flesh does not want but God says I know what you need and I'm gonna meet your need hallelujah amen so there's where we have Pleasures Christians seeing newborn babes in Christ coming into the kingdom a soul that is eternal something that's real amen hallelujah I'm telling you my brother and sister pardon me for saying this you can't hardly function in the world without seeing references to things but I'm telling you if you guys think the new Barbie movie is real hmm but there's little girls out there the only thing they want to be now is Barbie they just watched it I just read a little deal this dad's asking a psychologist is it normal that my daughter has watched Barbie I think it was seven times I don't think that's normal same psychologist says you know she's just living out something that's inside of her later this same psychologist said we have to be careful about giving our children too much religion that it doesn't warp their life Barbie's not going to the word of God is going to warp your life young people come on my brother and sister what is it it's that Spirit of pleasure not godly pleasure worldly pleasure and they're promoted as normal that it's okay to throw yourself into that pleasure but this over here you need to guard yourself um well Hallelujah I tell you what we'd have sister Sheriff you'd come we found the place we find pleasure in find pleasure in my Lord Jesus Christ Amen Let The Devil let me reiterate this I made a little comment to this earlier the devil is trying to redefine pleasure to the bride of Christ I don't want to get political on this but we can go to church we can hear preaching that causes us to jump Shout Scream and tear around but if there's no meat in that diet you'll walk out and within a day or two no you'll be right back where you was at amen we need a balanced diet and we find pleasure in the presence of God I find pleasure my brother and sister when I can worship from my heart with no restriction and we can jump and we can shout but I need to have a life I need to have a presence in my life that I can live it when I come back down amen when I leap up and shout and Hallelujah and praise God I don't want to just call that hey that's the evidence I want to be able to live it I want to be able to find pleasure on a Monday morning then I know he is my redeemer that I am called of him I am his son I am his daughter amen hallelujah that's what we want but see Satan is trying now in the day we live in to redefine what pleasure means to a Christian please you know the Lord has a place then he finds pleasure [Music] Hebrews 10 38 39 I want to give you anti-type first now the just shall live by faith that's us in this line right here can someone say Amen they just shall live by faith that's us might as well put your name in there but if any man draw back my soul have no pleasure in him so here's a position that when we're living in faith God is has pleasure in us but when we draw back God has no pleasure in us but we are not see I love how the word always brings amen I don't have it here I was going to bring it out I should have put put that level up here put that balance on here but we are not of them God's not gonna have any pleasure of those that pull back but we are not of them amen clearly identified we are not of them amen who draw back into Perdition but of them amen so we have continuity now of living by faith and being of them that believe to the saving of the Soul oh hallelujah thank you Lord and I want to also to close this out and put the type to it here of Ephesians 1 amen quite long scripture here but just give me just a few more minutes Amen to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved we did not make ourselves amen we were formed by him this flesh was formed in His image but the soul was formed after the very image of the spirit of God oh thank you Lord the world says it's deformed God says it's perfect who we gonna listen to hmm in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will Can someone say he has given me the mystery of his will amen according to his good pleasure what God is doing here is recorded in Ephesians gives pleasure to God to bring it to you and I it gave God pleasure to reveal himself to you and I oh my brother and sister as we're here rejoicing saying thank you Lord for saving me God is just beyond this Veil we can't see in the flesh saying I am so happy I saved you I'm so happy I redeemed you it gives me joy to call you my wife it gives me joy to call you my bride oh Hallelujah then in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are in Earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance Ming predestined according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will I'm going to tell you my brother and sister that there will get our eyes open one day we'll realize that it's in that time we're going to find that germ seed our theophany in the presence of almighty God when he says you know I'm going to send the Apostle Paul into this day and I'm going to send this one here and Martin Luther will be over here and I'm going to send oh put your name in there down into laodicea because it's going to be the most wicked age and I'm gonna have some people that are anointed to just say I believe the word I believe the word I don't understand and life can be hard but I believe the word and God says it gives me great pleasure to place you come on I don't want to go to naming all your names but he gave God great pleasure to place you in laodicea it gave him great pleasure to say I have already anointed that seed to produce what is necessary to bring forth fruit in laodicea oh this is no small thing my brother and sister no small thing oh Hallelujah that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ and whom ye also trusted that after he heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed that believing my brother and sister was after your confession and in that confession you were acknowledging what God already spoke take that now I want to tie this together maybe you'll think I'm on a limb but we have come to the place we understand that we have to speak our healing you can't just say well if God wants to heal me he'll heal me and in the meantime I'm just going to sit down here and wait and see what God's will is no sir God wants you and I to be able to stand up and say he is my healer I am healed in the name of Jesus Christ well I tell you can tie that right back to that moment when God allowed you to be awoke person I've had a person tell me believe her I don't even want to hear the word woke now is this island woke this and woke that and I said and when did you wake up he looked right okay I'm woke I'm woke I recognize I was in him before the foundation of the world I recognize I've always been a son I recognize I am his bride I'm woke I have woke up and you take that rhyme back in the message of prodigal and the prophet of God tells that little story of a mother and a father and their prayer in the night and when their son woke up in the morning he'd come to himself he was woke Hallelujah oh my oh my I don't know what county I'm in but I'll tell you what the price is paid amen the price of pleasure has been paid and I

pleasure in The Fellowship of the Saints I find pleasure my brother in things that the world out here thinks is ridiculous man here recently told me he was just talking he wasn't really making a point
