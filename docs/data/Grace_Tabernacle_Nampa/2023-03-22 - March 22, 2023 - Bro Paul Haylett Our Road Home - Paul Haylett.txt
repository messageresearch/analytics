you know it's just all through the Bible we see how the Saints lifted their voices in praise to God it was an expression that God gave us an ability that he placed in us to just Express that out and you know the old phrase that says Sing from your heart and truly I I believe that that the Lord hears our heart when we sing amen um just forgot to put this on a prayer request but sister Jerry's not been feeling real well and I know that there are others here in the assembly so let's make sure we lift one another up in prayer for the physical needs for healing and and strength and uh so we appreciate those prayers amen I know that I appreciate the prayer of the Saints and uh I believe that each and every one of us do amen thank you musicians it was a lovely song Service uh amen spoke to my heart and uh I want to just uh speak tonight once again on our journey and tonight our road home it is uh of all the roads that we can take there is something special about the road home and I say this just a bit humorous that even our dog teddy knows when he's on our road amen so how much more we as Sons and Daughters of God to recognize that God is so gracious to us that we're on the road home amen let's just stand and turn in our Bibles in Luke the 8th chapter we want to pick this up right here in verse 26 and um we'll we'll see that uh we're picking this up just right after uh Luke's account of um the disciples experience on the sea and uh we'll look and there's so much isn't it amazing when we start in and we can study a thought uh that literally a person could could uh preach on on these thoughts for months if not years because it's it's uh when I say complex I don't mean it in complexity but it's so interwoven it is just so interconnected that you can start in a certain way and if we're not careful we can get branched off into a uh literally dozens or hundreds of other avenues and um and yet we'll find that ultimately they would bring us back right to the very place we're at and that's the beauty of the word of God and so let's just turn in Luke 8 26 to 39 and um we will just unfold this story by God's grace tonight and they arrived at the country of the Gatherings which is over against Galilee and when he went forth to land there met him out of the city a certain man which had Devils long time and wear no clothes neither Abode in any house but in the tombs when he saw Jesus he cried out and fell down before him and with a loud voice said what have I to do with thee Jesus thou Son of God most high I beseech thee torment me not for he had commanded the unclean Spirit to come out of the man for often times it had caught him and he was kept bound with chains I love the fact we sang that song tonight amen bound with chains and in Fetters and he break the bands and was driven of the devil Into the Wilderness and Jesus asked him saying what is thy name and he said Legion because many Devils were entered into him and they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep and there was a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them and he suffered them then went the Devils out of the man and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep Place into the lake and were choked and when they had fed them and when they that had fed them saw what was done they fled and went and told it in the city and in the country then they went out to see what was done and came to Jesus and found the man out of whom the Devils were departed sitting at the feet of Jesus clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid my they also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the Devils was healed then the whole multitude of the country of the gadarines round about besought him to depart from them for they were taken with great fear and he went up into the ship and returned back again now the man out of whom the Devils were departed besought him that he might be with him but Jesus sent him away saying return to thine own house and show how great things God hath done unto thee and he went his way and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him Heavenly Father we ask for your blessings upon the word tonight let it live in our hearts our souls father we ask in your name amen you may be seated as we look at this story as we've read the Scripture it lays the story out very well before us and as we look at this story we see that there is um a a position and Jesus being on the other Shore the prophet of God says that um there is a horse cry in Jesus amen responded to one man's heart cry you notice that there was not another cry mentioned in the scripture not another need right there at that time but you look at this story in the heart cry of one man who had come and been in a place and it was across the sea and brother Branham lays it out this way and I find it uh very beautiful he says you know it was there that uh that cry he knew that that need was on the other side and of Galilee and so it was there was the whole purpose for him now did things happen along the way did God deal with the hearts of the disciples and give them a greater understanding all of that is tied together but it was the you might say tonight we're going to say a principal reason that they were there and crossed over and Jesus comes and and everything that's done he speaks to the disciples about their lack of faith and encouraging them now my brother and sister sometimes we take hard preaching or direct preaching as almost like it's an assault upon us but we really should count it as a blessing because the word of God says that he corrects those that he loves amen so he brings the word to us and we say well it could be brought a little softer but sometimes it takes something to get our attention sometimes God just uses very direct means to get our attention and so the the word of God you know shows us so clearly how this is now steps upon the shore what was it my brother and sister the word had come across the sea if we look through this scripture we'll find where the word has come over the mountain and we'll also find as it would be that it's come through the jungle and it's come through the depths of the city my brother and sister and of all of those things I would almost say that I'm more afraid of the depths of the city than I am of any of these other places and but it's there all to respond to the heart crime of one and so we see this one as it were that he was there taking some of these things that brother Branham said and and putting them not to imply anything that would not be a foundational of the scripture but the prophet of God talks about this and we'll read a quote in just a moment but he had been taken maybe it started that he'd just gone out of Fellowship maybe it just got started I don't know if you've ever read the little story about the minister coming to to the man who hadn't been to church for a while and they're sitting there in the winter time and the fire is going and the Ministry comes in he greets him and they sit down and he takes the tongs at the fireplace and he just grabs a coal and he sets it off to one side and as they're visiting he never says a word about the fact that the man's not in church but as the conversation went on you could see the glow go out of the cold and slowly it turned dark and solely it started to cool off and after a little bit the man says I get it you see my brother and sister that's one of Satan's way is to get us out of Fellowship get us to the idea that people don't care or it's not necessary but we'll see here how him out of Fellowship maybe he started to separate himself from his family maybe he found new friends and so we'll look at this my brother and sister there is a spirit on a person is what attracts them to the nature of the spirit does that make sense you see it's there that anointings or Spirits calls it to change and we've seen it we've all witnessed the change that comes when people change who they work with you can see it in just a change of employment and I remember years ago it's kind of a landmark moment for Paul but years ago we were we were slowly going broke on the farm and and I I realized I had to have a winter job and so I went and and um you know of course Every Man's right in his own eyes right I'm close to a perfect employee um that's why I've never really been able to work for anyone else I'm such a good employee but it's there that I would apply for jobs and they would be all excited oh Mr haylet will hire you blah blah blah and now tell them look I need to tell you that I am a farmer and when I go back you know farming starts in the spring I'm going to be gone we don't need you I went from job to job suffering that you know kind of almost I called it Prejudice but I understand why they felt that way and you know ultimately I got a job in a wood molding plant in Meridian and uh so you know I go to work there and my it's a different world for me and the very first day I'm there uh the the manager he takes me out and says okay now this lady right here is um is your Foreman your boss and uh you'll be she'll assign you to a job so they put me at a really really technical job of when the boards come through the molding machine I had to take them put two of them face to face and stack them on a cart very high tech work and I realized I I'm going to wither by the time spring comes I will have withered down to nothing I'd be the guy walking around who am I and what am I doing here but it wasn't long in the job that you know a couple people befriended me and one of them come and he he actually was a pretty nice kid but he goes now look this boss of ours is weird and when I mean weird I mean really weird and he says so you be careful around here or her okay and I'm like okay okay uh you know I don't know maybe there's something about this I don't know well you know they had uh they had a unique deal just uh no lunch hour it was just two long breaks uh mid-morning and mid-afternoon and uh so that very first shift that I'm there and I'm in the lunchroom the very first time I realized just how weird this lady was because she sat down at the table in the lunchroom opened her lunch box pulled her Bible out laid it on the counter or the the table and bowed her head and prayed over her food and I thought truly she's weird and I'm going to be weird with her I bowed my head and prayed for my food when I raised my head that kid's looking at me like not you but you see the spirit of the world my brother and sister has taken and made everything the house to do with God unless it's religion religion's not weird serving God is and so we see this man as the prophet of God is speaking this man would come and he he got started maybe in little things and brother Branham talks about that and I didn't put it up as a quote here but I'm drawing this out of uh uh exhortation of Divine Healing and brother branham's talking about kindred spirits and how that it is the dove stays with the doves and the vulture scavengers stay together and the buzzards stay together and so you'll see what happens and when these Spirits start to work they want to draw into a kindred atmosphere and so it's there that we see this this man it was the end up he ends up from this city and he ends up out in the tombs well what's out in the tombs dead it's just dead my brother and sister there's no life amongst the tombs and and that's what Satan wants to do he wants to take and make whatever we have in our life he wants to make it dead our relationship with God dead relationship with one another dead and emotionally Dead all of the things that we see as issues in the world today is because Satan has put an anointed not with a spirit they say we're concerned about the next generation of young people coming up because they have no motivations they have no no there's nothing to look forward to why because there's anointing of death upon the land and so it's there that they don't recognize how that this has been a spirit that has come in and it's infecting not in the way that they thought it would or the way that man would die look at that or describe it but it is still an anointing and so it's there as we move forward it would appear that this this man had no hope the scripture says he'd been out there amongst the tombs for a while this wasn't just something that happened last week but this had become an identity for this man he'd become a place where actually he was comfortable and I'm telling you I have witnessed this in my times uh in places in the world today my brother and sister you can have people whatever the age would be and as long as God is not dealing with them openly Satan lets them kind of just go on and live life but the minute someone starts to witness to them God starts to deal with him chaos starts happening everywhere and they start to become rude and indignant and all of these things you know and if you say well brother Paul what do you mean well it might not always come out as a rudeness but if you'll understand the spirit that causes mankind to say don't judge me that is not a man or a woman or a child pushing back that is a spirit and it is the same spirit that anointed this man in the tombs that he was becoming or had become resistant to anything that would change his position my chains are gone my brother and sister God has come and broke the spirit that would make you and I resistant to the move of God to the presence of God in our life can we say thank you Lord tonight that that chain that made us resistant held us back has been broken oh thank you Lord amen and so here it is what's happening is he is going it appears no hope it appears that there's nothing going to change for this man he's come debased to the place he's naked and doesn't even know it does the scripture not say that's a spirit of the age amen and Harry is he doesn't even care he's so possessed by his spirit and you look and see this position that he has come and as time progressed everything that was near and dear to him is just getting further and further away brother Branham talks about how no doubt that he had a wife and he had children and he had departed out of that household and we'll just read a little snippet my brother and sister of the quote here but let me catch this right here every time someone saw this man it seemed as though he had got worse I'm telling you my brother and sister the prophet of God talked about it in natural healing and natural healing and spiritual healing oftentimes parallel each other and the prophet of God says now you're healed in the name of Jesus Christ now you go home you'll get sicker before you get better but you believe that you were healed now look at what happens sometimes when God comes on the scene starts to move on the soul it seems as though they're going the opposite direction it seems as though it went downhill from the time that God stirred them but my brother and sister what it is is God is working and Satan's working overtime amen but Satan on overtime cannot even deal amen with the word of God so it don't matter how many hours Satan Works amen he cannot overcome the word oh aren't you glad about that tonight amen so there it is that it starts to get worse but I'm telling you don't you just love this my brother and sister the appointment had already been set God had heard that voice The Voice not of the physical man but the voice of the Soul had been crying out I long for deliverance I long for Liberty I long to be free in Jesus Christ and it was there God hears that voice amen imagine how strong that the voice would be but also Imagine the strength of the hearing of the one who hears all the way across the sea we've got the privilege it's a pretty good sized chunk of water actually you know I never really fathomed you know we looked it up and you know it was 13 miles long and this wide or whatever and you still don't fathom until you're on a boat and you're leaving the dock and there's the shore way over there you realize my brother and sister the man who was the captain of our boat somebody asked him does how how what's what's it like when it storms here and that's a pretty good sized boat we were on wasn't it I think it might even qualify as a ship and he says you don't want to be out here when it storms so it's not just some little little white cap a real storm and in spite of that Jesus heard and responded my oh my makes me happy the appointment's been set amen so what happened here is a chain-breaking demon see how Satan tries to duplicate this amen our chains have been broken and set us free Satan comes along in his own impersonation of it and breaks chains but God says you know what you can break all the change you want but you're not free and when I break the chains you are free and so this chain-breaking demon is fixing to meet his match amen and realize now the prophet of God says this and we just take this for the context he sent it in recognize it is not the person it is the spirit on them amen and I think oftentimes we get too carried away with the idea well so and so did this or said that this happened this way and they did that I don't know what's wrong with that brother or that sister or why they would act that way stop and recognize that is not your brother that is not your sister that is a spirit trying to stir up everything he can stir up amen so much so Satan thought that if he ran down to the water and met Jesus on the shore that he could somehow deter him and get him to turn turn around and get back in the boat and leave but my brother and sister I'm so glad that when God sets an appointment he says I'm going to be there I'll be right there on time and there is nothing turning me around nothing turning me to the side but I will be there at the time that I have designated not what man designated not a church designated what God himself said this is the hour this is a time this is a place and I'm fixing to break the chain of a spirit on an individual oh thank you Lord Hallelujah now remember my brother and sister chains come in all sizes sometimes we get the idea of somebody's burden down with huge chains that they must be under just a terrible burden but my brother and sister if we've ever come and I'm not going to speak as though you are there but this kind of people like us if you've ever come to the point that you're going to bed and almost find it uh uh you're resistant to taking time to pray or read your Bible before you go to bed there's a chain can be that simple I met a brother one time I I just thought he was just a wonderful brother somewhere in the course of everything going on uh this South America he told me he says brother Paul he said I feel so terrible and I was like well what brother and he goes well he said I get out in a restaurant and he said I hardly ever pray over my food because I feel so so conspicuous and he said I don't really believe I'm ashamed I just feel so awkward you know like when you start to pray in the building go silent the cafe and I was like when when you bow your head in the cafe and start to pray it goes silent goes yeah I said brother that's nothing be ashamed of that's a good sign that's a sign that these people are respecting you and they're respecting God that's the time to be bold that's the time to not keep your voice I tell you what you go with some of these brothers brother Kenny camps you sit down in a little cafe in the middle of North Carolina with brother Kenny Capps and everybody in that Cafe knows brother Kenny Capps is praying for food amen because it's not a show-off but he just not embarrassed not at least bit hindered Lord bless the people that prepared this the people that grew this bless the staff he knew everyone in the little cafe bless each one of them bless our waitress blah blah blah and and you know what that place went silent also my brother and sister nothing be ashamed of but this brother realized that there was something hindering him and when he realized that we had a little conversation he realized it wasn't really him good faithful man he wasn't ashamed to be a Christian but Satan had thrown a little chain on him and in that circumstance it bound him and he says I walk out I feel so ashamed Lord why why am I where I just closed my eyes and pray acquired they call them interpersonal prayers sounds sophisticated when you're ashamed to pray in public it's just a little interpersonal prayer I used to be that way and many years ago one day God dealt with me so hard and I was like never never never again will I allow a spirit amen to keep me from blessing food it comes so much I've shared this story a long time ago we used to eat at The Little Country Cafe thing out there and one time I come in there a little late the table's clear full but guys I said I'll just eat and go back to work and they're like no we'll make rooms so these grown men all scrunching on these little benches and I got a seat right there and put my food down there and bowed my head and I started praying and something come over me and I had a friend his name's Doug sitting directly across the table from me and I don't know why of all these guys I consider them all friends but I was like Lord just touch my friend Doug when I lifted my head up from praying Doug said across there kind of boldly looked me in the eyes and said did you pray for me and it just it was so organic that it was obvious that and I said yes I did when you talk about a table going quiet everybody's like oh and my friend dog oh God works in mysterious ways God knew that Satan was going to try and throw a chain around that whole thing by throwing a little something like that out and God Beat the Devil to it amen now let me get back on track here hallelujah now look here see so everything near and dear move farther and farther away it's getting worse it's getting worse but as we look at this just like you you know I still like to actually use a calendar believe it or not to plan for the future you know you flip a few months ahead and ride it on the date and then when you get there the rest of you are more modern no doubt use your phone amen I use my phone and then when the day comes and it doesn't ding or do anything I realized that I had done something wrong but it's a little late amen so it's there and then it comes and so this chain breaking was starting to take place and no one recognized it and amen now when then Jesus came amen it's just a beautiful quote here now she this is coming from from another portion of this but go read it all and she could not go to Jesus but oh there is one blessed thing you can go to him but he can come to you and he has never again any time fail Can someone say Amen one day way down in the land of godara No Doubt a sociable God-fearing citizen once lived and he got out with the wrong crowd maybe just married had two or three little kitties but he got mixed up in the wrong group and that's where many a young man or young woman loses out getting mixed up in the wrong group the wrong Associates and so one night they had taken him out give him a drink or play a little game do this or gamble a little it won't hurt then the first devil entered him now brother Branham is not saying this is exactly how it happened he's giving us just an insight into how it works and I'll tell you those of you that rubbed elbows with the world you'll know what this is like I used to justify it Jerry and I married had a couple little kitties amen I would go out on Friday nights I would shoot pool come home at one or two in the morning and I Justified it I'm not drinking I'm not smoking I'm not looking any other girls I'm not doing anything bad but my brother and sister there is the Trap that Satan lays and we justify I'm the kind of insert into what the prophet's saying here justify I'm not doing anything wrong in fact he might be able to say I'm not doing anything different than others in the church are doing but that don't make it right because someone else is doing it hmm and that's a mini young man young woman loses out get mixed up wrong Associates and one night they take and give him a drink maybe never took one before takes a little sip not enough to get drunk not enough to get uh you know and by to where he's acting silly but it was the ACT my brother and sister that's how Satan works it's the ACT and when you get started like the proverbial snowball amen when it starts downhill it's not an avalanche when it starts but it is when it finishes amen and so it's there play a little game gamble a little won't hurt first devil entered him he went home and had to tell his wife a lie boy I'll tell you what then that lion Spirit when he got away with it not lion spirit is that like see this ain't so bad come on let me just put this our husbands our wives are not our enemy they are us amen that's what the word says one flash they are us so you know if you feel compelled to do something like that it's a devil come on tell his wife lie second devil entered him until he was possessed with a legion he got Beyond any help on a man there was nobody could help it they would go out there imagine how many men strong men it would take to tackle a man like this and to hold him down and bind him in Chains and they say we got him look at him here he is bound but then the spirit moves yeah we can use that Universal can't we the spirit because there are two we want to break it down in all kinds of categories and whatever else there's either Holy Spirit or an evil spirit amen demonic or of God and his possessed or Legion got Beyond in help poor fellows drove out to the tombs for one nobody wants a man like that in their neighborhood and imagine let's just draw this just a little closer there he is in his own house his own wife his own children now terrified because they don't know when this will come upon him they don't know when there'll be a reaction to something said a reaction to something we have a little deal on the mirror in the house basically just to sum it up it says shut up and it gives all these when this happens ties it back to scripture when this happens don't respond this happens don't say a word this happens don't and oftentimes my brother and sister you realize those Spirits are actually waiting in ambush come on married folks you know good and well there's times we know I shouldn't say this but I'm going to say it anyhow and then what happens somebody flipped a match out and somebody else poured the gasoline but what happens whenever the chain breaker is present and let me just put it harshly you're prayed up and I'm prayed up the same thing can be said and we will say yes praise God we should pray about that or my Dad loved the joke about the man at work and he tells his co-worker but I had my wife last night my wife was down on her hands and knees begging co-worker looks at him goes wow are you serious what was she begging well she was saying come out from underneath that bed and Fight Like a Man hmm you know what kind of spirit it'd take to get to that place and they're right here my brother and sister they're right here they're just waiting for their opportunity they're waiting for their time to pour out their anointing but God says you know what I knew how to deal with that anointing and so here it is he comes and it starts so simple he's out at the pool halls shooting a little pool he's not smoking he's not drinking he's Justified I'm just having friend fun with my friends oh wait I went to church with my friends maybe he did too now you look at this it comes to this place the prophet gives us a little view of what happened to a normal man to a man that was not irregular he wasn't some crazy man he was just a man but Satan come and went to work and Satan is very faithful talking to a man about natural success and the man makes a statement he goes well you know it's still very simple just get up and go to work and you'll be successful and the devil gets up and he goes to work and he is successful amen so he sees Jesus and he cries out and he falls down before him my brother and sister the word says that every knee shall bow and so we see this sign right here that this this man possessed with these demons uh falls down and and says with a loud voice what have I had to do with thee Jesus thou Son of God most high and the spirits in him see not the man himself because we'll find as The Story Goes later this man is there with Jesus so it's not the man it's the spirits on the man that is resisting and pushing back and saying what do I have to do with you but if Jesus was to go into the minute details and he was to explain it all to him he would be able to say not you Legion but this man's Soul has been crying out and I was on the other Shore and I heard his soul cry out to me and I followed the cry and this is where I'm at you're not why I'm here demon you're not even there my brother and sister people are there we're going to cast these demons out we're going to do this we're going to do that well if we're going to get the demon out we better get something in not just cast out the demon we gotta have something that will take residence and fill that space or that demon will come back and say look there's room enough now for my friends so it's there as we go I want to kind of just hurry through this you know the St the story and so while verse 29 lays it out in this fact here that he had commanded that Spirit to come out uh you know it was there my brother and sister we see that it was this spirit being cast out now opens the door and God comes back now now you're not going to find this in the scripture but the prophet of God teaches this the Holy Spirit opened the door but it had to have been that man's heart's cry to invite him in so just the fact that Jesus broke the power of that Spirit did not deliver that man it was an open heart and soul crying for deliverance so we don't really see this but we find the principle of it are you with me and so it's there this man now that demon he's not happy that he's been called out and cast out and the Very chain you might say of the spirit that he has bound this man with has been broken oh I can hear the chains falling right now my brother and sister there should not be one thing that we are bound with tonight but we should be able to stop and say I hear the chains falling I hear their rattle on the floor I hear their rattle on the altar eyes no Deliverance has come oh Hallelujah and so it is this spirit this voice that represented these demons you know declares I'm Legion my brother and sister it does not matter if it's one Spirit on the individual or five or seven or Twenty or a hundred or a thousand amen when the deliverer comes amen it's not deliver until it's not delivered when my brother and sister he's the deliverer amen he is our provider he is everything that he ever said he would be in his word and there is not one failure to be recorded against our lord Jesus for him not doing now my brother and sister we have stories the prophet tells people get healed they're delivered they go out they talk to people they start to tell them that's nonsense they come back to the prophet and say I I know I lost my healing or whatever and the prophet of God says you know what look I you didn't lose it because of what I did or it wasn't powerful enough you started man speaking and repeating and associating and you went in if I can put it this way tonight you went in and stood there while they put a chain of unbelief around you and they stood right there and they didn't hold you down with a paddle lock and lock the chain of unbelief they convinced you to take the chain of unbelief and lock the padlock on yourself but praise God if there's not a key for that padlock our lord Jesus just simply breaks it oh you talk about a power Satan's trying to duplicate it he's trying to imitate it but he can't do it amen and I don't care what it is amen you know there'll be things that happen my brother and sister and people will say well this has been in our family amen I I just remember so well years ago sitting right there in the church amen and listening to brother Gideon preach uh breaking the cycle is how I remember those Services Brother David sister Diane were there amen and you look at that and brother getting in laying out such a beautiful picture and it don't matter you can say our family has always been this way good there's one that can break the chain tonight there's one that says I've got an appointment with you Amen to break this chain to change the pattern of your family that may be of God Terry now in the ways that you become the great grandparent the family might say you know what we've always been in the house of God we always they serve God we believe the word because that's all they know and the cycle has been changed oh you look how God works here now amen oh Hallelujah now look at this brother Branham speaks here the maniac and gadera just kind of move forward here now he's actually talking about Sadducees Pharisees right here at the top it's good to go read these Saints don't take Brother Paul's reading or presentation of it go read it and make sure brother Paul isn't out in left field they always had healings and signs and wonders God worked with them through the age and you look back there and see what the Pharisees did they fought against it every time God come right down it wasn't completely absent from Israel it wasn't as though Israel had nothing going on my brother and sister but you'll find that that Spirit of religion hmm that's not mistaken when you read where the prophet of God says oh I feel religious tonight that's not what we're talking about we're talking about a deep rooted tradition of man that's religion right there at its finest see what the Pharisees did they fought against it you see where they went don't get on this don't don't get on that same group better get over here I'm going to get detoured for a moment that spirit's alive and well right in the message we got more Revelation than they do show it to me oh no no I'm not talking about you digging out a book are you doing that let's just go ahead and go through the wilderness let's go down in a valley for a while then you can show me you got more than everyone else [Music] what's God looking for character now look at this don't get it that's that same group better get over here you see where the and I'm I'll guarantee you a few to finish that that said religion of in that day scholarship far beyond what we got now even a little man had to be so holy he had to be born in a certain tribe where he couldn't even be a minister boy that's pretty strict when you think about it and everything like that and yet when they come Jesus said you got the devil now what's harsh of him wasn't it I mean these are some of the finest men of the day they knew exactly how to robe themselves they knew how to present themselves they knew exactly the etiquette you know I just uh I thought this was funny I've seen a little deal on the computer and um I I was looking up some stuff about welding and this little deal popped up as a sidebar you know how they are and it said seven things not to do in a good in a nice restaurant and I thought you know I've been to a couple nice restaurants I'll read that and you know they tell you how don't and they I won't go into it but they say don't do this I do it don't do this I do it don't do this I do it but you know what they took my money and they told me come back sounds like church come on church is good business I was sharing this with brother Chris in the back my brother and sister all these things that happen out here the church is saying don't this and don't that and they just do it and do it and do it and my brother and sister what does it all come down to give us your money and come back just like a fine restaurant a business everything the prophet of God said about that has come to pass it is a business [Music] and brother Isaac showed me how in the world we live in today the best business model there is in the world today is I don't I won't have the right word but it's just reoccurring right it's where the people come back to you you don't get a lot of money out of them at once but they got to come back all the time that's why when you buy a computer now that you have a use of a program uh whatever word or whatever that's called for a year and after that you got to subscribe and then for the rest of your life you send them x amount dollars every year hmm sounds like church they had to be holy had to be born certain family even to be a minister it had everything like that and yet when they come Jesus said you got a devil said you're of your father the devil is that right yes sir polish Scholars so therefore religious Spirits now remember my brother and sister it's not all spirits of alcohol and spirits of cigarettes and spirits of dancing and spirits of vulgarity and and uh crude languages and whatever it's not always sometimes they're religious spirits and the prophet of God actually said religious Spirits are one of the worst that there is instead of making cutting a man and making him be a maniac he can be a shrewd scholar wow so that man amongst the tombs has made got the same spirit manifested in a different fashion as the man oh my scholar crazy man in the tombs how can that be a devil a devil see it was easy to see the spirit on the maniac wasn't it I mean he's running around naked in the tombs killing people that traveled the road but my brother and sister this rude scholar just kills him spiritually nobody really even notices in fact it's a nice Church they're going to go there they've just everything is cultured see how these spirits come my brother and sister and they do but I'm telling you there is a purpose that God called you and I and it started from the beginning and when he placed us here as you would say at our birth natural or spiritual all of that was intended to take us home it has no other purpose my brother and sister than to take us home and when Jesus crossed over the Sea of Galilee and come to that Shore he already knew that he was going to be speaking the word to that man and telling him go back to your home amen and I'll get ahead of myself but you look at this and see the plan of god is perfect God does not do ad hoc we do ad hoc yeah what do we do now we just broke this bolt off well okay what we'll do is grind the head off of it we just destroyed a thousand dollar Hub but hey we with the other part is worth more than a thousand so we grind the head off if it ruined that one we weld a nut on top of that bolt we heat it burning red hot and apply as much force as we can and the bolt comes out and we're so happy with ourselves if we'd applied heat in the very beginning the bolt probably would have come out and we just saved all the pieces but we're ad hoc we jump in make a problem fix the problem Pat ourselves on the back make a problem fix a problem Pat ourselves on the back again God says this what's going to happen hmm and you and I getting cold on God he doesn't have to go ad hoc he already knew what would happen he already knew I'm going to take him home they're going home I'm not worried about one single thing they're going home amen when I look up from my Throne they'll be there oh that makes me excited my brother and sister amen so it's there those men now that saw this going on in the scripture amen uh verse 34 these men that saw what happened they just saw a crazy man delivered of spirits and they saw the outward appearance uh effect of those spirits and that herd of hogs and how it rumbled down the hill now we drove through that area and they said the only place that we can find on the Sea of Galilee that would fit that is this no Highway here nothing built up it would be right in this area here it went up it was kind of a flat area before it went up in the hills and there that's about the only place they said it's been researched it's been studied everything's there here is all the landmarks this will be and you're looking there and of course now mankind has built things and there's highway there and all this stuff but you realize my brother and sister wide open it wouldn't have been something that happened in some little Gully somewhere and only one guy said I think I saw it happened it would have been right out in the open it was right there for everyone present to see this man crumpled to his fall to the ground in front of Jesus and these Hogs suddenly bow and down the hill they go and into the sea and I'm telling you those Shepherds whose whole living they had just invested everything they had put a mortgage on everything you go look it up the prophet of God says that that was hard on the hog business how is hard in the hog business in in gadera and Gatherings how that went through it shook them all up our pigs all caught something and round and browned themselves and they get afraid and they go off to town and they're going to town and what are they doing are they telling Jesus version no they're telling their version they saw this Jesus guy caused the pigs to go in an uproar and run down the hill and drown themselves and they start to tell that and everybody's like we don't want that in our neighborhood we got a lot of hogs here in Israel amongst youths so they already were a resistant people shouldering out this is what we believe the prophet said this and this is what he meant hmm willing to eat their Pig hope you catch what I'm saying right in the midst of God's commandment they didn't care we raise pigs some of them serve on the Deacon board some of them are trustees some of them even are preachers but the spirit on them is a spirit of a pig kind of horse especially when I'm a preacher but you see if it doesn't apply to you it doesn't apply to you so there's no need to dig the Pitchfork out even just let it go where God intended it to go we've heard the old phrase Pitchfork you know well praise God yeah you come on it's time for us to say Amen praise God I've been delivered my chains have been broken amen that Spirit left me I have nothing to do with that amen that's not my issue and if it applies to anyone in this church then Lord touch their heart and their soul that they would fall at your feet and be delivered and sure go a long ways for churches our church included Amen to get rid of the Pitchfork amen may we ought to hang a sign up on the board no pitchforks allowed hmm so look what happens is they go and they tell their side of the story that Jesus called me speaking there and some things were said and next thing you know the pigs run down there and tremendous Financial loss in other words this preacher was a tremendous Financial loss just so he could cast a spirit out of that guy it cost us finances well the prophet of God says this the church is not willing to pay the price for a Revival brother Branham times that directly to this scripture they're not willing to pay a price amen look what could have happened if them men had run in the city brother Trevor and said we have just saw the Spirit of almighty god Jehovah has come down and delivered that crazy man out there in the graveyard and gets powerful and if the whole city run out there and said we have needs we have healings we need deliverances I got a husband needs saved I got a wife and he's saved I got children at least say would you come all the Revival in our city in the town of gadera could have a great move of God but instead they went in there and said oh my goodness he's going to ruin it's going to ruin everything we've got and what do they do if you look in the scripture there they come together and they come to him and ask him leaf oh my goodness my brother and sister the very thing they needed the most and they had ample evidence right side right outside of town in the tombs they had evidence of what Satan was doing but they were so anointed in a religious realm that we are just fine and you know what these spirits on these people these things that happen oh they're there this and that and that and this and that it's just we're human how about it's time we come and say I'm a Son of God I've got his blood flowing through my veins I am not just a human but I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God and I won't claim some Earthly Covenant when God's holding out a Heavenly Covenant for me I'm going to claim that Heavenly Covenant oh Lord help me I want to live that to the fullest oh my so they were telling their side of the story and it's there that they see you know have to admit it would have been shocking would have been shocking if it just been normal you know that's how new highways are built the one by the graveyard would have had a detour sign on it and it would have went up and around this and I'm taking this in kind of a in context but in kind of roundabout way brother Brown's talking about why there's no power in the church you know why there's no power in the church instead of dealing with the demon in the graveyard we built the detour we took and took our children and our young families and everybody and we took them out here and told them if you feel good you've got it some and I'm not saying this lightly breaks my heart some even to this moment are promoting if you just acknowledge that God sent a prophet you've got it go look no don't mount there's a man wrote a book called God's generals he promotes women preachers he promotes all kinds of stuff comes to brother Branham and says went off if it had just stayed healing people if he'd just stood at the edge of the graveyard and said do you need anything in there because we don't want to upset the balance a lot of people pay a lot of money seeking answers from the church yeah look kind of serious but there was one said I have an appointment with that man I'm not here to welfare him I'm not here to to do any of this and that leave food offerings for him I'm here to deliver him and when that one come our lord Jesus and stood right there in the appointment time to come what happened the religious people said we need you to leave town you are disrupting the balance of everything now I want to close in just the next couple minutes now look what happens here he's delivered he's now there at the feet of Jesus now Jesus is invited by all the religious people and the businessmen to leave town so he's going and this man who's just been delivered from something now I don't believe God erased his memory he knew where he came from and I'm going to say there's a lot of us need to be reminded every once in a while when we get sanctimonious and super religious we need a little reminder of where we come from because without him we are nothing amen but with him we are more than conquerors amen and it does us well to remember that without Jesus in our our midst amen that we are just common flesh Amen in fact horse flesh might have more value well sorry to speak out a turn like that see you look at this and their fear Jesus hindered their program but you look at the scripture and you'll realize they hindered Jesus's program or did they One Soul scripture talks about it one soul um oh my now we look here I want to just hurry right along so that they would go my brother and sister and and uh Jesus is like fine you invite me to leave if I'm not welcome here I'm not staying here he goes to get in the boat and now this man comes and verse 38 he says now the man out of whom the Devils were departed besought him that he might be with him but Jesus sent him away now imagine this this young man just now been delivered from you might say the worst thing and then to experience the greatest thing he would experience in his life and he wants to go with Jesus and Jesus says Nope this this ministry here come on let me just put this in here like this this ministry here is not your calling your ministry is right down there in your town in fact your ministry oh God help us for all of our thoughts to travel the world and preach to the thousands in the far away places maybe our ministry is in our own house Jesus doesn't say cast everything away and follow me he tells them no what I want you to do is go down to your city I want you to go down there and there's a story surrounding the city about how I'm a lunatic and I cause the pigs to go but when they see you in your clothes in your right mind with your wife and with your children and they see that you'll have a Ministry greater than any Pharisee because people love a first-hand witness reminds me one time I was a young man had no clue what was going on I was stopping at the bank to to uh uh cash my paycheck from uh oh I say paycheck from a construction job I just finished and the people paid me and I pull up in there not really paying attention I signed the check I jump out of the pickups start to go and there's there's ribbons I'm like what's going on here the bank got robbed oh cool they didn't think so but almost like you know turn around here we are in the scene firsthand only I wasn't firsthand the police had all these people about five feet apart six feet apart and I got to be kind of a witness of this in a little bit they I just set my pickup I'm like wow what's happening they took away witness number one they turned him loose he goes they take witness number two and you know why they did none because part of the old-fashioned way oh God God delivered me pretty soon everybody in the church is delivered whether they were or not they're delivered the police are smart enough to realize that if they hear someone say he's wearing white tennis shoes they're all going to say he's wearing white tennis shoes he's got a blue t-shirt on everybody's going to think it was a blue t-shirt but when they when they single them out you know the man that was out in the tombs saw him in the marker with his wife and his children and you know how they used to go their heads down trodden shuffling along ashamed they look so happy they look so happy as children holding on to his hands looking up with eyes of adoration his wife turning something happened to that guy well we heard that crazy Jesus guy went out there and something about spirits and pigs and I don't know it's just too weird sooner or later their day in the market there he stands hey bill how you doing good oh everybody wants to know what happened Jesus came amen Jesus came no crazy stuff no sir he spoke to that demon on me cast it out where'd it go them pigs everybody's talking about them demons have no power unless they have an abode wow our priest said we need to take up a special offering to buy more incense and a few more turtle doves no you need to meet Jesus you just need to meet Jesus that that'll fix your problem hmm oh people have reasons my brother and sister we call them excuses God help us I'm not speaking down to you I'm speaking to myself we have excuses but we've been delivered the chain has been broken we need to come and take the full benefit of being set free in Jesus Christ hey man I appreciated those words about Liberty amen just come right and fit right in place amen he tells them return to thine own house and show how great things God hath done unto thee and he went his way and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him he didn't go back home and just slide down there and get a job amen he was in the city everybody knew he was crazy but now he's kind of crazy the other way but this crazy is really awesome because it's just simple we see a life changed hmm I want to travel the world I want to tell everybody about the message Jesus said go to your own house start there start in our own house and let the light of Jesus Christ shine in our house oh Hallelujah I'll just stop right there there's always there's always more amen oh my you know maybe we don't know this situation maybe it was the first time ever that the word was in his home but it was a true Witness he didn't have to say somebody told me somebody told me that Jesus had the power to cast out demons he didn't have to say somebody told me you can be free he didn't have to say somebody said because who witnessed it himself and the witness came from where the synagogue the temple The Market Square his house oh by the way the bank robber older gentleman waited patiently for a couple hours I didn't wait patiently I left old gentlemen waited patiently for a couple hours finally went up a policeman's like oh yeah sir no and it goes oh and I have something to share well we're busy no I need to share this what is it you need to share the license number of the vehicle he drove off in the place went the man was sitting at his kitchen table counting the money yeah the devil gets us to rob the bank and then he calls 9-1-1 amen but our soul that's my closing our soul crying out doesn't get the police it gets our lord Jesus our hearts cry brings Jesus on the scene amen sister vika if you would please Hallelujah isn't it good to be a Christian hey man isn't it awesome just that we can look and see through the scripture you know one might say it might have been embarrassed to bend that man and they'll always remember he was a crazy naked man out in the tombs and I'm telling you what my brother and sister just if you've been with me put it this way you let a couple Generations come and somebody would say what is it about your family I don't know but we serve God that's what I know well that's some story about your great-grandfather or your grandfather what I don't know about that all I know is my grandfather's godly man my father is a Godly Man my grandma a great grandma's Godly lady and you know right on Down the Line why because God breaks foreign he breaks every Fetter he isn't just in the businesses set us free for a moment he's in the business to set our families free Amen to bring a legacy of Christ in the home Hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus amen Falling In Love With Jesus I don't have a page number on that brother Gideon amen [Music] Hallelujah aren't you glad we fell in love with

and his children coward in fear and he was able to tell them don't be afraid Jesus has set me free oh how glorious that would have been and Heavenly Father how glorious it would have been to have been able just to follow Prophet to our generation from service to service to see firsthand healings and deliverances and the moving of the Holy Spirit this is seeing doves Witnesses seeing Angels wings hear the sound of rushing Mighty Wind how glorious that would have been but Lord you laid this down in your word and said bless it is that he that believes having never seen Lord I thank you you declare that we are blessed Lord our heart says Amen to the word of God and we believe it Lord and we get to be in our own house witnessing we get to Lee in our own house Lord with our ministry and those around us oh Lord how that it would be father to gain the whole world and lose the souls in our very house help us Lord Jesus let our ministry be true let it be faithful Let It Be powerful in our own house Lord let there be no doubt that Jesus Christ was on the scene alive and well Lord the word in us living to tell thank you Lord Jesus thank you 406 brother Gideon amen I'll tell you it's

statement my brother and sister but that man amongst the tombs the prophet of God says when we get on the other side I'd like to talk to him yeah amen because when the redeemed are gathered in you see what happened that invitation that he put out that man heard it now we look at it and we kind of see these things and try and put it in context but you know I just read a deal the other day somebody said well we didn't have the Holy Ghost until the New Testament hmm somebody needs to do a little study and get a little revelation you see the Holy Ghost has been present God just chose to speak another language you go right down through the Old Testament they've been hearing invitations right through the New Testament coming hearing the invitation and there's a people here tonight that have

amen the bride of Christ lifting them before the Throne of God that God's mercy which the scripture says are new fresh every morning Amen Let us be hind let us be behind that freshness let us be part of that freshness that's coming for because we're lifting and you know I don't say this to be boastful but I don't know why I woke up in the middle of the night last night no doubt God had a reason I could not go back to sleep I laid there and I laid there and I laid there and I finally was like Paul listen to yourself I rolled over in bed and I just started praying I think I made it most of the way through the church before I woke up this morning amen because the devil hates you pray but God loves to hear that sweet odor coming before the throne not words that we wonder if they made it past the ceiling but the word shows us a sweet oath let's lift a sweet odor to the Lord we love you God bless you each and every one see you Sunday thank you [Applause] foreign foreign [Music] thank you [Music] thank you foreign [Music] foreign [Music]
