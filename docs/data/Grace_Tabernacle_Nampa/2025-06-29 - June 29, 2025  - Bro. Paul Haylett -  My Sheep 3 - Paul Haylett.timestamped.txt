[18:13] [Music]
[18:16] God will make a way.
[18:22] Where there seems to be no way.

[21:14] thanks. It says, "In the good times,
[21:16] praise his name. In the bad times, do
[21:18] the same." Just thinking, you know, when
[21:20] we do that, we're basically professing
[21:21] that we trust him, that he's going to
[21:23] take care of it like his word says.
[21:25] Amen. Let's just sing this as we get

[24:28] a way.

[35:11] Amen. And uh no doubt in town for for
[35:14] your normal course of business, but
[35:17] we're happy you're here with us. And my
[35:19] dear friend Cody, known him since he's
[35:21] just a young man, and I'm very happy to
[35:23] see you here today also. And um my niece
[35:28] Mel, God bless you. Good to see you this
[35:30] morning. Amen. Let's just uh I want to
[35:33] talk to you very simple thought today
[35:36] and the Lord just has been uh laying
[35:39] this on my heart for a little bit just
[35:41] as I've been studying and reading and uh
[35:44] to realize how sometimes you know we can
[35:46] we can preach very deep things but uh
[35:50] when we look back at at uh what Jesus
[35:53] spoke we often see it was very very
[35:56] simple things that he spoke out to the
[35:58] people and uh So, I I just think that uh
[36:02] you know, sometimes it it's just good
[36:04] for us to go back into the simplicity of
[36:06] the gospel. I want to uh just uh bring
[36:10] April up uh in in remembrance also her
[36:14] her work schedule uh and and such. We
[36:17] know uh her heart's desire would be to
[36:20] be here and uh we just want to remember
[36:23] her. Uh also uh brother Jonah Imi from
[36:27] Colona, British Columbia will be with us
[36:30] on July 13th. So let's uh be mindful of
[36:34] that and remember uh to pray for those
[36:36] services a good distance for for them to
[36:40] travel. But um at at um we're going to
[36:43] be excited, I believe, to have brother
[36:46] Jonah here. I want to preach to you on
[36:49] the third part of my sheep. And we see
[36:52] through this scripture uh Jesus making
[36:54] many references uh to his sheep and his
[36:57] lambs. And let's just turn in our Bibles
[37:00] to Matthew 18 verses 11-4.
[37:06] And um just lay a little foundation out
[37:09] of the simplic simple side of the the
[37:13] gospel here. I was the word simplistic
[37:16] was going to come out but it's not
[37:17] simplistic. It's actually quite deep.
[37:20] Just like the way up is down is very
[37:25] simple but very very deep. And we thank
[37:28] the Lord for that. For the son of man
[37:30] has come to save that which was lost.
[37:33] How think ye if a man have a hund sheep
[37:36] and one of them has gone astray. Doth he
[37:39] not leave the 90 and nine and goeth unto
[37:41] the mountains and seeketh that which is
[37:44] gone astray? And if so be that he find
[37:47] it, verily I say unto you, he rejoices
[37:49] more of that sheep than of the 90 and
[37:52] nine which went not astray. Even so, it
[37:56] is not the will of your father which is
[37:58] in heaven that one of these little ones
[38:01] should perish. Heavenly Father, we ask
[38:03] you to bless the thought today. Just
[38:05] speak to our hearts. And Lord, open the
[38:07] word, Father. For we know that the word
[38:09] is much deeper than the words that man
[38:12] might judge as simple. And Lord, it is
[38:15] more beautiful than those things of a
[38:17] man might say in the complexity of of
[38:20] our articulation of our intelligence,
[38:23] our our studies, Lord, to see the real
[38:26] essence of what you are speaking to us,
[38:29] the real Lord word that has come to our
[38:32] day. Father, we ask you to bless this
[38:34] time in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[38:37] You may be seated. I would like to also
[38:40] then just go right into Luke the 15th
[38:43] chapter which is also a parallel
[38:47] scripture to this and um he says there
[38:51] in Luke 15 and1 then do near unto him
[38:54] all the publicans and sinners for to
[38:56] hear him and the Pharisees and scribes
[38:59] murmured saying this man receiveth
[39:01] sinners and eateth with them and you
[39:04] know it's so interesting when you do
[39:06] that because that was the whole purpose
[39:07] of the gospel right? Was to reach out to
[39:10] the sinner. If we're trying to save
[39:12] those that are saved and and wash those
[39:15] that are already clean, then we've
[39:17] missed the whole concept of the gospel.
[39:19] And yet they thought that people should
[39:22] actually be these perfect people, even
[39:24] if it was just strictly on the outside.
[39:27] But he he very clearly the Lord shows us
[39:31] how that this is not so. This man
[39:34] receiveth sinners and eateth with them.
[39:36] And he spake this parable unto them,
[39:38] saying, What man of you having a hund
[39:40] sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not
[39:43] leave the 90 and nine in the wilderness,
[39:45] and go after that which is lost, until
[39:48] he find it? And when he hath found it,
[39:50] he layeth it on his shoulders,
[39:52] rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he
[39:54] calleth together his friends and his
[39:56] neighbors, all of the church. Amen.
[39:59] Saying unto them, Rejoice with me, for I
[40:01] have found my sheep which was lost. And
[40:03] I say unto you that likewise joy shall
[40:06] be in heaven over one sinner that
[40:08] repenteth more than over 90 and nine
[40:11] just persons which need no repentance.
[40:15] Now as we'll look at this just in the
[40:17] nuance of the wording we will find my
[40:19] brother and sister that one is just
[40:21] astray and we can realize that's the
[40:23] same as being lost. But it is also that
[40:26] sometimes they have already experienced
[40:28] God and they have drifted and went
[40:30] astray and God is then uh calling them
[40:33] or finding to bring them back. And in
[40:35] this we see in Luke as the scripture is
[40:38] there over the sinner that repenteth. So
[40:41] we're looking at even one who has
[40:43] already experienced God in his life and
[40:45] to one who knows not God at all. The
[40:48] same parable bringing about the same
[40:50] rejoicing. And we thank the Lord for
[40:52] that because it is here in the day that
[40:55] we live in that we are not there trying
[40:58] to decipher who has got greater sin or
[41:01] who is of more importance. But we are
[41:03] all sheep and God cares about us and has
[41:07] redeemed us. And we sit here today I
[41:09] believe in our hearts with thanksgiving
[41:11] saying thank you Lord for the redemption
[41:13] that has come. And uh he knows uh our
[41:16] heavenly father the great shepherd of
[41:18] our souls. Amen. He knows according to
[41:20] the scripture who are his. And I say,
[41:23] Lord, thank you that you would speak to
[41:24] us because it's in speaking to us that
[41:27] you're reminding us who we are. Now, the
[41:29] devil's got a voice uh 24/7 365, it's
[41:33] everywhere you look, if you just even
[41:35] turn on the radio to listen to the news,
[41:38] there's something that is injected in
[41:39] there. And everywhere you go, the
[41:41] billboards and in the shopping centers
[41:43] and the stores, everywhere you go,
[41:46] Satan's uh pro proclaiming his message.
[41:48] And so we have this that we realize how
[41:52] precious it is that God comes and speaks
[41:54] to our souls. Amen. Aren't you glad when
[41:56] he comes to you personally and comes
[41:58] down in the midnight hour and speaks to
[42:00] you and let you know and starts to put
[42:02] an uncction in the heart or in the heart
[42:04] and the soul that we would be there and
[42:07] something in our mind that we ponder and
[42:09] can't get away from. And and these
[42:11] things is the way that God's working.
[42:13] He's countering, Amen. by the word. He's
[42:15] countering Satan's message of this hour.
[42:18] Now, as we'll look at this, I I want to
[42:21] uh just move into I hope you don't mind
[42:23] this morning, just a little down to
[42:24] earth, but you know, no doubt each one
[42:27] of you saw the painting of the shepherd
[42:30] uh there in the edge of the canyon,
[42:32] reaching down for the lost sheep that's
[42:34] on the little ledge above the cliff, the
[42:37] abyss that goes and drops far into the
[42:40] valley. And and so we'll see that this
[42:43] uh shepherd is there now at great risk
[42:46] to himself, a great price to himself,
[42:49] but yet his love for the lamb is so
[42:51] great that he goes right down and and
[42:54] takes this risk as it is and and goes
[42:56] down to the very edge of the abyss. And
[42:59] I just want to interject this at this
[43:01] point. The abyss actually represents
[43:04] eternal separation from God. Amen. It's
[43:06] not just a bump in your life that you're
[43:08] having a hard time, that you're
[43:10] struggling, that that Satan's assaulting
[43:12] you, but the abyss is literally that
[43:15] eternal separation. And Satan would just
[43:18] love to get people so hardened that they
[43:20] would come to the place that they don't
[43:22] care whether they're separated from God
[43:24] or not. They don't care about these
[43:26] circumstances, even to the point that
[43:29] they would declare, "We're not sure
[43:30] there is a God. It doesn't matter
[43:33] anyhow."
[43:34] And so you look at this and realize that
[43:36] the shepherd, he cared, the great
[43:38] shepherd of our soul, he cared enough to
[43:40] come down and pay the price and as it
[43:43] were take the risk. Now my brother and
[43:45] sister, if you are John 1 1-14,
[43:49] if if you are God in flesh, you know
[43:53] exactly what you're doing. It's not like
[43:56] humanity that might be climbing down to
[43:58] that lamb and holding on to a root or a
[44:01] rock and and it might be loose and
[44:03] wiggle and you're not sure whether and
[44:05] you're you're apprehensive or you can do
[44:07] this but God when it come to Calvary
[44:10] when it come to our redemption my
[44:12] brother and sister there was not a doubt
[44:13] but you'll see as you read the scripture
[44:16] because Jesus there in flesh amen he
[44:19] knew that he was going to bear the pain
[44:21] of this crucifixion he knew that this
[44:24] was going to be a price that in his
[44:27] flesh he did not want to pay, but it was
[44:30] already set in motion. And there he
[44:32] makes the declaration, Lord, thy will,
[44:36] not my will, be done. Amen. And I say,
[44:38] Lord, anoint each one of us with that
[44:41] with that attitude, with that approach
[44:43] that we're not concerned about what our
[44:45] own will is, but we're looking, Lord,
[44:46] that thy will be done in our life. Amen.
[44:50] And so I would say today the real story
[44:54] is not how the lamb got to where he is
[44:56] at. Sometimes we can focus so much on
[45:00] what it was that took a person to that
[45:02] stage of their life and and we get
[45:04] caught up in that uh details of that.
[45:07] Oh, how terrible that must be. My
[45:09] brother and sister, that's not the real
[45:11] story. The real story is how the lamb is
[45:14] going to be brought back. Amen. There's
[45:16] the real story. And so can the lamb help
[45:19] himself? Oh my brother and sister, the
[45:22] lamb cannot help himself. He is not
[45:24] there no ability to save himself. And so
[45:28] as it is that he is there, no doubt,
[45:30] let's just think like a lamb for a
[45:32] moment. No doubt as he ends up on this
[45:35] little ledge above the canyon and you
[45:37] see shady green pastures and and the
[45:40] water and everything down below in the
[45:43] valley, but to get back to that place,
[45:45] he doesn't know how. He can't go down on
[45:48] his own to the valley and he has found
[45:51] himself in a position he can't go up.
[45:54] Amen. I can relate in a little bit.
[45:56] Reminds me of a time many years ago and
[46:00] we were hunting and it got very late in
[46:02] the day and uh we got the bright idea
[46:05] that instead of walking these several
[46:07] miles back, we would just cut through
[46:08] the canyon, climb up the other side and
[46:11] and uh was only just a mile or two back
[46:14] to camp from there. And you know, I was
[46:16] about halfway up the canyon when I ran
[46:19] out of options. I have a rifle slung
[46:21] over my back and I'm there and I can't
[46:24] go down. And every rock I can reach
[46:27] above me is loose.
[46:30] And I start to relate to this right
[46:33] here. I've got no ability, my brother
[46:35] and sister. I can't go back. I can't
[46:38] seemingly find my way. And it was there
[46:41] that I didn't trust anything. and
[46:44] something come over me and I remember
[46:46] with tears in my eyes I thought Lord
[46:49] if there ever was a time in this flesh
[46:51] in the natural side I need to trust you
[46:54] now is the time I I have to trust you
[46:58] Lord which one of these rocks that I
[47:00] can't even see should I hold on to and
[47:03] we know that he is the rock of our
[47:05] salvation we know he is the rock that we
[47:07] are anchored in he is the rock that is
[47:09] there in the gospels amen he was a rock
[47:11] in the wilderness and it's it's just
[47:14] completely anchored there. And I
[47:15] remember I reached up and I got a hold
[47:17] of a rock and it felt loose. But I
[47:19] thought, "This is my hope." And I
[47:21] started to pull myself up and I
[47:23] scrambled over the top. And you know, I
[47:26] thought it was interesting. Yes, the
[47:27] rock I was holding on to would move a
[47:29] little bit. But the rock turned out to
[47:31] be very large, much more than what I
[47:34] could have ever made move. And and you
[47:36] know, you move on to that and realize
[47:38] that God has given us a rock that we can
[47:40] hold on to and and we're there. But in
[47:43] the case of this lamb, he's there and
[47:45] and lambs, you know, he's he's looking
[47:48] and he's looking for something. There's
[47:50] got to be someone to give him some
[47:52] advice, a bleet of his mother, of those
[47:55] of his friends, but it's not there and
[47:57] he can't save himself. And uh you know,
[48:00] it's just a recorded thought that uh
[48:04] sheep are notorious for their lack of
[48:06] ability to find their way home. Amen.
[48:08] Sheep were created to be led and not to
[48:12] go on their own, not to do their own
[48:14] thing, but they struggle to find their
[48:16] way. And I think we can see this in our
[48:18] own lives that sometimes we just don't
[48:21] have answers. And we feel like that
[48:23] we're strong individuals. We should have
[48:25] an answer. We we should know what we
[48:27] should do, but we are at loss. And
[48:30] that's because that representation of
[48:32] this sheep, of this lamb, uh, comes
[48:35] right down upon us because that's what
[48:37] we were created to be under that
[48:39] example. And so it's there to struggle
[48:42] to find our way. Now, my brother and
[48:44] sister, it is interesting that as long
[48:46] as we can find our way, talking of human
[48:48] nature, as long as we can find our way,
[48:52] we will try to find our way. We will try
[48:55] to do it our way. Amen. But when God
[48:58] ever brings you to the place that you
[49:00] realize that I need something greater
[49:03] than myself, I need something greater
[49:05] than what I can think, what I can do,
[49:08] what I can understand. And and it's
[49:11] there that God comes and says, "Hey,
[49:13] don't worry. I'm right here." Amen.
[49:15] You're my sheep. I'm here to come rescue
[49:18] you. Amen. And and in that, it's such a
[49:21] beautiful story. And I every time I see
[49:23] that painting, it just brings this alive
[49:26] to me that that lamb in that position
[49:28] left alone if not my brother and sister
[49:31] caught by a predator. Amen. And that
[49:34] there's a greatest predator, Satan like
[49:37] a roaring lion. Amen. Seeking whom he
[49:40] may devour. A great predator. If not, he
[49:43] would simply starve to death. And
[49:45] unfortunately, we can say we look in the
[49:47] world around us and you see a lot of
[49:48] people that that they they believe there
[49:51] is a God, but they don't know how to
[49:53] approach him or there's not enough
[49:54] uncction in their life to approach him.
[49:57] And you'll see how that they start to
[49:59] fill their life full of things because
[50:01] they're actually starving for the very
[50:03] thing that they desire the most. Amen.
[50:06] The very thing that would rescue them
[50:08] and bring them from their position. They
[50:10] refuse to accept that and they starve
[50:13] and they fill that full. And many cases
[50:16] my brother and sister we find that they
[50:18] turn into alcoholics and addictions and
[50:22] different things and and we'll find that
[50:24] they are people most unhappy. Amen. So
[50:28] we look at this now this will be
[50:30] something I think most of you I just
[50:32] felt led to use this for an example.
[50:34] Maybe uh you have or maybe not. I don't
[50:37] know. But Shrek the lost sheep. Have you
[50:40] heard that story? Read that story of
[50:42] Shrek. Amen. Shrek the lost sheep. So
[50:45] Shrek was of a flock and he was there
[50:49] and somehow Shrek decided that he didn't
[50:53] like to be rounded up and sent back to
[50:55] the paddock, you know. And uh Shrek
[50:58] started a little history, a great
[51:00] ability to evade. Amen. being taken with
[51:04] the rest of the sheep. And so Shrek
[51:06] would come and and they knew Shrek
[51:08] existed, but when the shepherds would
[51:11] come into the paddics to round them up,
[51:13] this was in a very hilly country. Uh
[51:16] Shrek would just run off and hide. And
[51:18] it turns out that Shrek had lived in a
[51:21] cave for several years. That was his
[51:23] place. Go find a hole and hide in it.
[51:26] And I I hope you think this through in a
[51:28] spiritual context. And he survived in
[51:31] the wilderness. Amen. Shrek defied the
[51:34] odds. No wild dogs, no wolves, no
[51:37] eagles, nothing was there to to uh take
[51:41] Shrek's life. He he was not uh uh uh
[51:44] consumed. Now, it doesn't say whether he
[51:47] was bothered or not, but he was not
[51:49] consumed by the wild animals. Amen. And
[51:52] he went through some long harsh winters.
[51:54] And I believe every one of us that's
[51:56] been saved and filled with the Holy
[51:57] Ghost can look back in our life and
[51:59] realize there's been some long hard
[52:02] winters in our lives. Uh times that we
[52:04] felt alone and times we felt so
[52:06] desolate. Times we thought there was not
[52:08] a hope for us. But you know somehow by
[52:11] the grace of God you survive. And Shrek
[52:14] is out there in the wilderness there and
[52:16] and uh and he survives for six long
[52:20] years on his own. And it's there, my
[52:23] brother and sister, and I want to
[52:24] re-emphasize, no wild animals got to
[52:27] him. Nothing took his life. But you
[52:30] know, he was burdened.
[52:32] Amen. Anytime we're not relieved, my
[52:35] brother and sister, anytime we don't let
[52:37] off the pressure, anytime that we
[52:40] believe that we have the answer for
[52:42] ourself, Amen. we start to carry
[52:44] burdens. And it's there that Shrek
[52:46] burdened by six years of wool.
[52:50] Right.
[52:52] Go look him up if you're not familiar
[52:54] with the story. Shrek
[52:57] is basically a ball of wool with a nose
[53:00] and four legs sticking out of it. Amen.
[53:04] And it had come to the place that Shrek
[53:07] while healthy
[53:09] was under a burden that was soon to
[53:12] overwhelm him.
[53:14] He was there at a place that when Shrek
[53:17] in his final, they determined that Shrek
[53:20] because after they he finally was
[53:22] brought into the fold, Shrek never laid
[53:25] down. And they realized that Shrek
[53:27] realized if I ever lay down and rest.
[53:30] Amen. We're called to have rest. Amen.
[53:34] This rest is not natural rest. It is a
[53:36] rest in our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. But
[53:39] Shrek realized if I lay down I will
[53:42] never get up again. So Shrek did not
[53:46] sleep on his laying down like a normal
[53:49] sheep should in rest. But he stood all
[53:52] the time and it was there. Amen. He was
[53:55] actually looking this barely able to
[53:57] walk under his burden. Does this sound
[53:59] familiar to some of us? Amen. And so you
[54:03] know this six years of wool
[54:06] was the equivalent of 20 men's suits.
[54:10] That's a lot of wool. Amen. So he's
[54:14] carrying this burden.
[54:16] Could barely stand, barely walk under
[54:18] this. Burdened by what comes natural
[54:23] to a sheep.
[54:28] You say, "Oh, brother Paul, I just don't
[54:30] know about my life.
[54:32] just seems like I have so many burdens.
[54:34] I have all these it what comes natural.
[54:38] Yeah.
[54:40] But we have to let the burdens be taken
[54:43] from us. Amen. We have to find a place
[54:46] to lay our burden down. Otherwise, as we
[54:49] carry it, it gets greater and greater.
[54:51] I've used it for an analogy many times
[54:53] how we would look with awe and wonder if
[54:57] we saw someone walking through the
[54:59] airport with about 25 or 30 suitcases
[55:02] hooked together and they're struggling
[55:04] to drag the burden. Amen. It's time to
[55:07] let it go. Amen. It's time to be done
[55:10] with it. It's time to lay it down on the
[55:12] altar and let the Lord Jesus Christ deal
[55:14] with it. But this was all burdens that
[55:16] were natural for a sheep. Amen. I'm
[55:20] going to type it to cares of life. Amen.
[55:23] Even nature shows our need for a
[55:26] shepherd and our willingness to allow
[55:29] God to shear us. That's right. Amen. And
[55:32] there's some pictures if you look it up,
[55:35] you'll see there. There's Shrek after
[55:37] he's been sheared. Now, you know, I
[55:40] wonder did Shrek lose that did that
[55:44] lesson teach Shrek not to run and hide?
[55:47] We would hope so. He actually lived many
[55:49] more years beyond that and uh was taken
[55:52] to all kinds of places. If you look at
[55:54] the history, he was taken before the
[55:56] government and sheared. He was taken
[55:58] before this group for for charity and
[56:01] sheared. Amen. Shrek didn't say, "Nope,
[56:03] I like that. I think I'll run back to
[56:05] the wilderness." He actually come to a
[56:07] place. I think he realized his lesson
[56:09] and it's like, I need to be sheared. I
[56:12] need to be sheared. Anybody need to be
[56:13] sheared this morning? Amen. Lord, cut
[56:16] away everything that's not supposed to
[56:17] be in my everyday life. Cut away all my
[56:20] burdens, Lord, that that are holding me
[56:22] down, Lord. Just let the word of God
[56:24] come and shear me that I can be light in
[56:27] my spirit, light in my heart. And as the
[56:30] scripture says, if your heart condemns
[56:31] you not, then you have liberty in Jesus
[56:34] Christ. Right? I want to have liberty. I
[56:37] don't want to be hiding in a cave
[56:38] somewhere uh holding on to my own things
[56:41] and obsessing over them and letting them
[56:43] slowly bear me down to where I'm afraid
[56:46] to even rest. Amen. So I say, Lord,
[56:49] isn't that beautiful how even in nature
[56:52] Amen. It shows that we have a need,
[56:54] right? Amen. So how do these sheep
[56:58] wander away?
[57:01] Did they just one day just jump up and
[57:03] say, "I'm running away."
[57:06] No, it takes place one step at a time.
[57:09] Amen. Just one step takes them a little
[57:11] further. Another step takes a little
[57:14] further. I had a friend some time back
[57:16] was telling me, he said, "Man, I had
[57:17] something incredible happen, Paul." And
[57:18] I was like, "Okay, what's that?" He
[57:20] said, "Well, I was doing some chores out
[57:22] in one of the back pastures and and we
[57:25] were rotationally grazing some cattle
[57:26] through there and I don't know what I
[57:29] was thinking. I was on my four-wheeler.
[57:30] I come I opened the gate. I passed
[57:32] through the gate and I never stopped. So
[57:35] there the gate was left wide open and he
[57:38] said, 'You know, after a couple hours I
[57:41] was like, and I rode back and he says,
[57:43] 'You know, maybe all these years of
[57:46] moving the cattle from from pasture to
[57:48] pasture, I've always led them from
[57:51] pasture to pasture with the
[57:52] four-wheeler, but he says, I rode back
[57:55] to there, and he said there was a couple
[57:57] cows kind of outside of the gate, but
[58:00] most of them are standing there. And he
[58:02] said, I I never thought it through. I
[58:04] rode up on the four-wheeler and they all
[58:06] said, "We're going somewhere." Amen. But
[58:08] up to that point, they were just
[58:10] standing in the gate waiting to be led.
[58:14] But the minute some leadership showed
[58:15] up, they're like, "We're out of here.
[58:17] Where are we going now?" He said, "I had
[58:18] to lead them out in a big round circle
[58:20] and ride them right back through the
[58:22] same gate because they were used to
[58:24] following. Oh Lord, let us get used to
[58:27] following." Amen. to be able to just
[58:29] follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[58:31] day by day and not question it, but not
[58:34] go off on our own, not decide this is
[58:37] what's best for me. This is what's best
[58:39] for me, but to stop. Amen. If there's no
[58:42] clear uh uh way to go, no clear answer,
[58:46] just stop and wait on the Lord and let
[58:48] him come and and lead us into the next
[58:51] segment of our life, the next portion or
[58:53] story of our life. Amen. And so, you
[58:56] know, this sheep, one step at a time,
[58:58] ends up in a wilderness. Amen. I did
[59:01] this in my teens, saints. I I I can
[59:03] relate perfectly. Just one step at a
[59:06] time and then ending up one day
[59:08] wondering, "How did I get here where I'm
[59:10] at now? How did I end up at this point?"
[59:14] Amen. But it all happened one step at a
[59:17] time. And we know how we return. It is
[59:21] there that we will return one step at a
[59:24] time. But catch this out of these two
[59:26] stories, these two parables out of the
[59:28] scripture. Amen. The the uh lost lamb
[59:32] there is not there walking his way back
[59:36] into uh his restored position, but he's
[59:39] there not held under the arm of the
[59:42] shepherd, but the shepherd has now
[59:45] brought him into a very personal and
[59:48] dependent position. And that is it's
[59:50] upon his shoulder. Amen. And we find and
[59:54] and we won't deviate into this thought
[59:56] this morning, but we find my brother and
[59:58] sister, the government, amen, of the
[1:00:00] people of the the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:00:03] has been laid upon the shoulder of our
[1:00:05] Lord Jesus Christ. And here is the lost
[1:00:08] lamb who is now been rescued. He's not
[1:00:11] drugged along behind on a leash. He's
[1:00:13] not held under the arm, but he's placed
[1:00:16] upon the shoulder, which is the
[1:00:18] strength, the resource for a son or
[1:00:20] daughter of God to be held as it would
[1:00:22] be the bosom of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:00:25] And so, it's there that he's being now
[1:00:28] carried back to his rightful position
[1:00:30] because if we could restore ourself, we
[1:00:33] would.
[1:00:35] But we need a loving savior. Amen. We
[1:00:38] need the shepherd of our soul to take us
[1:00:41] back held in the tender embrace of a
[1:00:44] loving shepherd. Amen. And you know this
[1:00:47] morning I don't want to really so much
[1:00:49] focus on just this story but of the
[1:00:51] promise of our Lord Jesus Christ as what
[1:00:53] he is speaking to us. And and it's there
[1:00:56] that we understand that as God has
[1:00:58] spoken these words, my brother and
[1:01:00] sister, when we get into our situation
[1:01:03] where we as it were, uh we don't know
[1:01:06] how it happened, but we're on this step,
[1:01:11] we can't go back
[1:01:13] and the abyss as it is is before us.
[1:01:17] May God help us not to give up hope and
[1:01:20] just leap off.
[1:01:22] That's right. Yeah.
[1:01:24] Amen. It doesn't matter anyhow. I can't
[1:01:27] seem to live. I can't live the gospel.
[1:01:30] It doesn't matter anyhow. I just give
[1:01:32] up. No. My brother and sister, just cry
[1:01:34] out. The great shepherd hears the voice
[1:01:36] and he's coming to the rescue. Because
[1:01:38] he knows his own. Amen. And he knows
[1:01:41] where to find his own. And if he doesn't
[1:01:44] know where to find his own, my brother
[1:01:46] and sister, he's not God.
[1:01:48] Amen. But he is God. and he's been
[1:01:51] proven to be God. And he's proven to be
[1:01:53] faithful. And he's proven to be here.
[1:01:56] And he's proven that he cares about you.
[1:01:59] Amen. So here today, we don't want to
[1:02:01] look at just a little story and say,
[1:02:03] "Well, maybe that was for someone that's
[1:02:05] lost." I'll tell you, my brother and
[1:02:07] sister, he came to us and carried us
[1:02:09] into his word. Every single one of us,
[1:02:12] there was never one of us found our way
[1:02:14] into the word. Not a one of us said,
[1:02:16] "Oh, I got it." My brother and sister,
[1:02:18] revelation is a gift of a God. And my
[1:02:21] brother and sister, salvation is a gift
[1:02:23] of God. Everything that we have is a
[1:02:26] gift from God. And I tell you, there's
[1:02:28] no gift that you can be given in this
[1:02:30] life, my brother and sister, that's
[1:02:32] greater than the gift that God has given
[1:02:34] us. Now, as we look here into one in a
[1:02:38] million, Amen. It is uh Brother Isaac,
[1:02:42] the screen doesn't want to respond. So,
[1:02:44] you see people making their blunders.
[1:02:47] Can anybody lift a hand maybe and say,
[1:02:48] "Yep, that's me. I I blunder. Amen. They
[1:02:52] stumble at it. They run at it and they
[1:02:55] think this and that, but it doesn't work
[1:02:57] right. We see it. But there is a working
[1:03:00] right. That's to find God's perfect will
[1:03:03] and stand in it. What God called you
[1:03:06] for. Amen. You wonder what I should do.
[1:03:08] Where should I go in my life? I I'm I'm
[1:03:10] here in these positions. What do I do?
[1:03:13] Amen. Stop and find the perfect will of
[1:03:16] God and then stand in the perfect will
[1:03:19] of God. Don't run aimlessly. Amen.
[1:03:22] Somewhere. Amen. I'll tell you, brother
[1:03:25] brother Eugene Brown told me one time uh
[1:03:28] something that he used in a sermon. He
[1:03:30] experienced it and they had a wild bull
[1:03:33] really. It was part of the herd, but he
[1:03:35] just liked being out there on the on the
[1:03:37] prairie he didn't want to do. And every
[1:03:39] time they would try to round him up, he
[1:03:40] would just run. And he would could just
[1:03:42] run for miles and and uh you know
[1:03:45] finally my brother and sister take this
[1:03:47] as a spiritual type. That's how brother
[1:03:49] Eugene preached it. Amen. Finally, you
[1:03:51] know, one last ditch effort before
[1:03:53] winter uh to get this bull. He never
[1:03:56] survived the winter out there with
[1:03:57] several feet of snow and and so one last
[1:04:00] ditch effort and they went out there.
[1:04:02] Now think about this. Amen. They were so
[1:04:06] happy to find that this bull had foot
[1:04:08] rot. Yeah. Now, you would think, why
[1:04:11] would anyone be happy that their animal
[1:04:14] had foot rot? Because it was foot rot
[1:04:17] that subdued this animal and allowed him
[1:04:20] to be led. Amen. Oh my. God knows how to
[1:04:24] give us a case, my brother and sister.
[1:04:26] He knows how to bring us to a place in
[1:04:28] our life that we're saying, "Okay, take
[1:04:31] me to safety. Take me to a place greater
[1:04:33] than myself. Take me to a place that I
[1:04:36] can come and actually find rest." and
[1:04:39] they found him way way out on the
[1:04:41] backside. You know, their pastures were
[1:04:43] where Brother Eugene was was working or
[1:04:45] helping on those things. We're talking
[1:04:47] about hundreds and hundreds upon
[1:04:50] hundreds of acres and the over rolling
[1:04:52] hills and and sometimes even ravines and
[1:04:55] rivers and whatever. So, it wasn't just
[1:04:57] stand at the gate and look to see if
[1:04:59] there's something out there. You had to
[1:05:01] go ride every corner of that. And they
[1:05:03] knew that bull was in there and they
[1:05:05] knew and they were determined. There was
[1:05:07] several of them went out. They were
[1:05:08] going to rope him if they had to and
[1:05:10] drag him till they could put him in a
[1:05:11] trailer and they were going to do all
[1:05:13] this, but they find him living by this
[1:05:15] little water hole that's slowly drying
[1:05:17] up and his foot hurting so bad he can't
[1:05:19] hardly walk. And they're out there
[1:05:21] rejoicing.
[1:05:23] Well, I know that people probably would
[1:05:25] wonder about this. Why is the preacher
[1:05:27] happy that God is allowing this to
[1:05:29] happen in my life, my brother and
[1:05:31] sister? Because you realize if you can't
[1:05:34] be led by man, God will do what it takes
[1:05:36] to bring you to a place you'll allow him
[1:05:39] to lead you. Amen. Because man's not the
[1:05:42] answer. Amen. God's the answer. And God
[1:05:44] knows how, if you don't mind me putting
[1:05:46] this way, to give you foot rot. Amen.
[1:05:48] Because it's that he knows will bring
[1:05:51] you to a place you can be led. Amen.
[1:05:54] Brother Eugene talks about how they
[1:05:56] threw a rope, lassoed that bull, and
[1:05:58] they were expecting a fight because
[1:06:00] that's what he'd done in the past. He
[1:06:01] would pull on the rope and then if he
[1:06:03] couldn't pull the rope loose, then he
[1:06:05] would run down the rope and the last
[1:06:06] thing you want is a couple thousand
[1:06:08] pounds of bull hitting your horse in the
[1:06:10] side. And and so they throw a rope on
[1:06:13] him and they just give a little bit of a
[1:06:15] tug and he just starts following.
[1:06:18] Oh, isn't that the truth of what the
[1:06:20] Lord has done for us? Amen.
[1:06:23] He sent his word. Oh, if you don't mind
[1:06:25] me putting this out, he sent his word
[1:06:28] out and his word come down around us and
[1:06:31] the word give a little tug on us. And
[1:06:34] now we've come to the place we're not
[1:06:36] willing to fight him anymore, but we're
[1:06:38] saying, I need help. I can't help
[1:06:41] myself. I need help. And you know, just
[1:06:45] for something, Cody would know. Amen.
[1:06:48] You get a cow with foot rot and the
[1:06:51] fever that's in the foot, they'll
[1:06:52] actually go stand in the mud trying to
[1:06:55] subdue the fever in the foot and the mud
[1:06:57] makes the foot rot worse.
[1:07:00] Wow.
[1:07:03] There it is. What we think will help.
[1:07:07] Amen. What we're pretty sure we can put
[1:07:11] the sav on our conscience
[1:07:14] makes it worse
[1:07:16] until we're willing to say, "Lord, thy
[1:07:18] will be done." Thy will be done. Amen.
[1:07:23] So, I I like that. I don't want to focus
[1:07:26] on that quotation real long, but you
[1:07:30] know, so you see people making their
[1:07:32] blunders, and I'm telling you, if we had
[1:07:34] a whiteboard here and I started writing
[1:07:36] my blunders on here, you guys would be
[1:07:38] saying, "Uh, can we at least go home for
[1:07:40] supper?"
[1:07:42] Because my blunders are endless, it
[1:07:43] seems.
[1:07:45] As the Apostle Paul said, "When I would
[1:07:47] do good, evil is present with me. Even
[1:07:52] while I endeavor, desire, long, and
[1:07:54] press to do good, evil somehow seems to
[1:07:58] show up.
[1:08:00] Can someone say amen to that?
[1:08:03] John 6 and 44 says, "No man can come to
[1:08:06] me except the father which has sent me
[1:08:09] draw him." Amen. There's the lasso of
[1:08:11] the word coming down around him, and I
[1:08:13] will raise him up at the last day. So,
[1:08:15] we realize that we are incapable.
[1:08:18] Now, Shrek had an attitude. He didn't
[1:08:21] like to. He was He was good at escaping.
[1:08:24] Amen. And And we can see that how the
[1:08:27] human nature sometimes is just good at
[1:08:29] escaping. But you see, God knew the day
[1:08:33] would come
[1:08:35] that Shrek would not desire to escape.
[1:08:38] Shrek himself knew he needed
[1:08:41] deliverance.
[1:08:42] Oh, thank you, Lord. Now these last day
[1:08:45] sheep for the scripture we see clearly
[1:08:48] in the book of revelation how it's
[1:08:50] coming down the spirits of these last
[1:08:52] days and how it would come upon the
[1:08:54] people. Some would be lovers of pleasure
[1:08:57] more than lovers of God. We would see
[1:08:59] they would be heady. They would be
[1:09:00] high-minded. But that's for a different
[1:09:02] class of people. Amen. We're we're not
[1:09:04] that class of people. And so here we
[1:09:06] are. These last day sheep of this age
[1:09:09] are very peculiar people. Titus 2:14
[1:09:13] says, "Who gave himself for us that he
[1:09:16] might redeem us from all iniquity and
[1:09:18] purify unto himself a peculiar people
[1:09:22] zealous of good works." Amen. Not not of
[1:09:26] marginal works, not just having a form
[1:09:28] of religion. Amen. But to be zealous of
[1:09:31] good works with a heart's desire. Lord,
[1:09:34] I want to please you. I want to live for
[1:09:35] you. My overall overwhelming
[1:09:39] thing in my life is to please you. And
[1:09:43] you know what that does? It causes you
[1:09:44] to shed all kinds of things. You might
[1:09:46] say, "I have a hobby. I have a this. I
[1:09:48] have a that. I I do this. I like to do
[1:09:51] that." And as God starts to work on us,
[1:09:53] those things somehow I I I really can't
[1:09:56] explain to you how that happens. But you
[1:09:58] wake up one day and it's been so
[1:10:00] diminished in your life that you don't
[1:10:03] care whether you do it or not anymore.
[1:10:05] But that isn't how you feel when it
[1:10:06] comes to serving God. You're like, I
[1:10:08] need to, I have to, I will serve God.
[1:10:12] Amen. Amen. I thank God for this
[1:10:15] peculiar people of the last days, not
[1:10:17] just a religious people. Amen. You know,
[1:10:20] it's there. So, I I'll just bear a
[1:10:23] little secret to you. Um, I've been
[1:10:26] studying uh some very interesting topics
[1:10:30] and um one of those led me to come
[1:10:32] across um uh a video about a particular
[1:10:36] Baptist church back east and uh how the
[1:10:40] church now now we're not here to degrade
[1:10:42] anybody so don't misunderstand me but
[1:10:45] they were an independent Baptist church
[1:10:47] but you might say Baptist kind of is
[1:10:49] Baptist and and uh so they're doing and
[1:10:52] and their pastor the founder pastor got
[1:10:55] older and um he decided, you know, I I
[1:11:00] I'm older now. I want to just have some,
[1:11:02] you know, freedom and time and
[1:11:04] relaxation in my life and pastoring a
[1:11:06] church of a few thousand people. Yeah. I
[1:11:08] said thousand. I mean, it's huge. And he
[1:11:11] said, I just need a break from that.
[1:11:13] Ultimately, this church elects a man,
[1:11:17] young man, dynamic,
[1:11:19] whatever.
[1:11:21] But he was a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[1:11:24] And not long after he becomes pastor, he
[1:11:28] starts shutting down every program that
[1:11:30] they considered important. And it was
[1:11:33] interesting as they're interviewing
[1:11:34] these people, some of them are like got
[1:11:36] tears in their eyes. You know, that's
[1:11:38] real to them. He he got rid of our
[1:11:41] choir. I've sang in the choir for 35
[1:11:44] years
[1:11:46] and no choir.
[1:11:48] And our Sunday school outreach, he said
[1:11:52] it was ineffective and he cut it off.
[1:11:55] And there's another families, our our
[1:11:57] married couple uh retreat stuff and all
[1:12:00] that. Said it's not necessary. Cut it
[1:12:03] off.
[1:12:05] And then one day they stand in front of
[1:12:06] the church and said, 'Oh, by the way, we
[1:12:10] don't know how this happened, but this
[1:12:12] church is broke. Now the old bookkeeper
[1:12:16] for that church says can't be such. When
[1:12:19] I retired, this church had X dollars in
[1:12:23] reserve.
[1:12:25] You see what they did is not only did he
[1:12:28] start preaching another gospel,
[1:12:32] he pulled the life
[1:12:34] right out of the church.
[1:12:38] And when people would say, "That's not
[1:12:39] right, pastor." They would get a notice,
[1:12:41] a postcard in the mail. You have been
[1:12:44] removed from your unsatisfactory
[1:12:47] behavior.
[1:12:50] You can't even vote.
[1:12:52] And my point being is my brother and
[1:12:54] sister that we're living in a day that
[1:12:56] the scriptures are being fulfilled. Even
[1:12:59] if it isn't right here in your midst, we
[1:13:02] say, "What? We're not having those kind
[1:13:04] of issues." But it's being fulfilled.
[1:13:06] Amen. Wolves in sheep's clothing coming
[1:13:10] preaching another gospel. This being a
[1:13:13] gospel of wokeism.
[1:13:16] And I'm glad I'm awake today, but I
[1:13:18] don't want to be woke. Amen. I I want to
[1:13:21] be awakened to the presence of God, but
[1:13:24] I do not want to be caught up into all
[1:13:27] the rest of this. Now, my brother and
[1:13:29] sister, do we embrace all of that? Yes.
[1:13:31] I hope you understand what I'm saying
[1:13:33] here. Every bit of that that they're
[1:13:34] woke about, we embrace. Amen. But we
[1:13:37] embrace the word coming. Amen. And we
[1:13:40] don't leave the same as we came. There's
[1:13:43] what we do. We embrace the word and it
[1:13:45] changes us to that point. Now my brother
[1:13:48] and sister uh one more thing along that
[1:13:50] line. So I was uh studying this certain
[1:13:53] thought and it was there that a minister
[1:13:55] that has been known uh out of the
[1:13:58] Baptist church forever been on
[1:14:00] television been on the radio made
[1:14:01] recordings and podcasts and all kinds of
[1:14:04] stuff influenced tens and thousands
[1:14:06] maybe hundreds of thousands of people.
[1:14:08] And somebody asked him a direct question
[1:14:11] along those lines right there. And uh he
[1:14:14] he dodged artfully.
[1:14:17] He dodged around the whole question
[1:14:21] because you see he had a choice. It's
[1:14:23] either the word or it's an opinion.
[1:14:27] And he tried to make opinion the word.
[1:14:32] Amen. Tell that to that lamb that's on
[1:14:35] the cliff above the abyss. You're going
[1:14:38] to be all right there. That's where God
[1:14:40] wants you to live. Build you a little
[1:14:42] shelter right there on that little
[1:14:44] narrow rock above the abyss. and and
[1:14:46] just learn to eat gravel.
[1:14:51] What's going to happen to that little
[1:14:53] lamb?
[1:14:56] If he doesn't jump off the abyss out of
[1:14:58] desperation, he's going to become so
[1:15:00] weak he falls off the abyss.
[1:15:04] That's not what the word of God said for
[1:15:05] us. Amen. He said that we would be
[1:15:08] healthy. We would be fat. The very
[1:15:10] marrow of our bones and everything about
[1:15:12] us would cover us with flesh. Amen. and
[1:15:15] he would restore us to our perfect
[1:15:16] health. He would bring us to our place
[1:15:18] that God ordained for us in the
[1:15:21] beginning. And I don't know about you
[1:15:23] this morning. Yes, I do. I can say that.
[1:15:24] I do know about you this morning. God
[1:15:26] didn't call you to be a starve, skinny
[1:15:29] Christian. He called you to be a
[1:15:31] Christian that's filled with the word of
[1:15:33] God, with life flowing through your
[1:15:35] veins and the strength of the gospel uh
[1:15:38] flowing and giving you that that
[1:15:40] everything that comes your way, every
[1:15:42] battle that you must face, every giant
[1:15:44] that you come to that you have faith
[1:15:46] enough to stand up and say, "This is the
[1:15:48] hour God called me to stand here on the
[1:15:51] gospel. I shall not be moved from my
[1:15:54] position as a son or daughter of God."
[1:15:57] Not the skinny Christian that's like,
[1:15:58] "Well, if that's what the church wants,
[1:16:02] this is not about the church. This is
[1:16:04] about you, sons and daughters of God,
[1:16:07] called before the foundation of the
[1:16:09] world, to be able to stand here and say,
[1:16:11] "I stand with the word." Amen. Not with
[1:16:14] opinion. Amen. It says he knows the
[1:16:18] sheep of his fold and he knows where
[1:16:20] they're at at all times. Amen. I love
[1:16:22] that. Now, just give you a little
[1:16:24] example. This is a little bit not it
[1:16:26] ain't out in the weeds but just a little
[1:16:28] bit off to the side here. Now look at
[1:16:30] this. When we talk about he knows where
[1:16:32] we're at. Here's Adam and Eve.
[1:16:36] They know that they have done wrong.
[1:16:39] They're in the garden
[1:16:42] and God comes down in the cool of the
[1:16:44] evening.
[1:16:46] Adam,
[1:16:48] oh Adam,
[1:16:50] where are you? Adam.
[1:16:54] Adam.
[1:16:56] Adam. Where are you, Adam? And here's
[1:17:00] Adam and Eve
[1:17:03] over here hiding behind the foliage.
[1:17:06] Don't say a word. Hold still.
[1:17:10] The whole time, God knew where they were
[1:17:13] at. He didn't have to go walk all the
[1:17:16] trails in the garden, go down the
[1:17:18] avenues and the streets all the time. I
[1:17:22] just read a little question somebody had
[1:17:24] here the other day and they said, "Well,
[1:17:25] if God knows or knew where we were at,
[1:17:28] why didn't he come to us?" He did.
[1:17:32] Adam,
[1:17:34] Adam. Yeah.
[1:17:37] But you see, it was our state of mind
[1:17:40] that kept us from saying, "Here am I.
[1:17:46] Here am I." until Adam and Eve could no
[1:17:49] longer hide.
[1:17:52] Now, their ability to no longer hide was
[1:17:55] not something that happened in them. It
[1:17:56] was something God put on them that they
[1:17:59] finally had to come out and face
[1:18:01] themselves. Because you see, as until
[1:18:03] God brings us to a place that we're
[1:18:06] willing to face ourself, we won't. Amen.
[1:18:10] We will find an excuse after an excuse
[1:18:12] and continue down our own path.
[1:18:17] in the right season is how we would put
[1:18:20] it. Now, Ecclesiastes 3:1-11, you know
[1:18:23] it, but we'll just go through it here
[1:18:24] anyway. Um, it's there. Uh, would you
[1:18:30] put that up, Brother Isaac?
[1:18:32] Um,
[1:18:35] Ecclesiastes
[1:18:45] first verse. There is it.
[1:18:50] Was there not a first verse on that?
[1:18:52] Okay, I'll just read it to you. To
[1:18:54] everything there is a season and a time
[1:18:58] to every purpose under the heaven. A
[1:19:02] time to be born and a time to die. A
[1:19:04] time to plant and a time to pluck up
[1:19:06] that which is planted. A time to kill
[1:19:08] and a time to heal. And I say thank you
[1:19:11] Lord for that. A time to break down and
[1:19:13] a time to build up. A time to weep and a
[1:19:16] time to laugh. A time to mourn and a
[1:19:18] time to dance. A time to cast away
[1:19:21] stones and a time to gather stones
[1:19:22] together. A time to embrace and a time
[1:19:25] to refrain from embracing. A time to get
[1:19:28] and a time to loose. Time to keep and a
[1:19:31] time to cast away. A time to rend and a
[1:19:35] time to sow. A time to keep silence and
[1:19:38] a time to speak. A time to love, a time
[1:19:41] to hate, a time of war, and a time of
[1:19:44] peace. What profit hath he that workketh
[1:19:47] in that wherein he labor? I have seen
[1:19:50] the travail which God hath given to the
[1:19:52] sons of men to be exercised in it. He
[1:19:55] hath made everything beautiful in his
[1:19:58] time. Also, he has set the world in
[1:20:01] their heart so that no man can find out
[1:20:04] the work that God maketh from the
[1:20:06] beginning to the end. Amen. As you look
[1:20:09] at this, we'll realize, my brother and
[1:20:10] sister, every situation we have as sons
[1:20:13] and daughters of God is a time or a
[1:20:17] season for that. And that season was not
[1:20:20] by our will or desire. It's always by
[1:20:24] God's will and desire. While we might be
[1:20:27] crying for deliverance, it's God who
[1:20:29] opens the gates of deliverance to us. We
[1:20:32] have a time that we say, "Well, I I it
[1:20:34] was a season I knew I just had to serve
[1:20:37] God." Well, the reason you knew it was a
[1:20:39] season you had to serve God is because
[1:20:41] God placed that in your heart. And when
[1:20:43] he placed that in your heart, you
[1:20:45] realize I I need to follow the uncction
[1:20:48] of what God has placed in my heart. And
[1:20:50] so as we'll look at this, I don't want
[1:20:52] to go and and explain every one of these
[1:20:54] for time's sake, but my brother and
[1:20:57] sister, as you look at this, see, he is
[1:21:00] this uh prophet hath he that workketh in
[1:21:03] that where he labor. I have seen the
[1:21:05] travail. Anybody experienced travail
[1:21:08] which God has given to the sons of men
[1:21:10] to be exercised in it. Amen. If I could
[1:21:13] just emphasize this to you to this
[1:21:16] morning, my brother and sister, you got
[1:21:18] some travail. You got some burdens. you
[1:21:20] haven't got rid of. You got some
[1:21:21] struggles in your life. Realize God's
[1:21:23] wanting you to be exercised in that for
[1:21:26] that season to cause to shift you from
[1:21:29] the position you were comfortable in.
[1:21:31] Shift you to another position. And it's
[1:21:34] not that it's just from one position to
[1:21:36] another. But it is this that is bringing
[1:21:39] us into a position to be ready for the
[1:21:42] coming of the Lord. Amen. So, we're
[1:21:44] never going to come to a place we just
[1:21:46] stand still and say, "Praise God. I got
[1:21:48] the message of the hour. I've got the
[1:21:49] word of God. Praise God. I'm going to
[1:21:51] just stand right here." No. God is
[1:21:53] constantly moving us. He's constantly
[1:21:56] bringing us. And he causes this to come.
[1:21:58] And what is it for? It's for our
[1:22:00] maturity. Amen. It's not. We oftent
[1:22:03] times as humans get well, well, you
[1:22:05] know, they got moved like that. They had
[1:22:07] troubles. Well, maybe they deserve that.
[1:22:09] Oh, my brother and sister, they deserved
[1:22:11] it only because they're sons and
[1:22:12] daughters of God. They didn't deserve it
[1:22:14] because they did or said or it wasn't
[1:22:16] quite pleasing or this, that, or the
[1:22:18] other. God uses the travail of man to
[1:22:21] move us. Let's not be set down in
[1:22:24] concrete. Let's let God move us. Amen.
[1:22:26] It doesn't matter whether it's here or
[1:22:28] there, up or down, sideways, whatever it
[1:22:31] is. If God wants to move us, let God
[1:22:33] move us. Amen. because he's not bringing
[1:22:36] us into a position to keep us there, but
[1:22:39] he's moving us on. Amen. Look at Israel
[1:22:42] in going through the wilderness of sin.
[1:22:45] You know, they got to a place they had
[1:22:46] the promise of God. It was a real
[1:22:48] promise. God had proven that promise.
[1:22:50] And yet, they got out in the wilderness.
[1:22:52] It got difficult.
[1:22:56] And they said, "I sure wished I was back
[1:22:57] in Egypt. My taskmaster didn't beat me
[1:23:01] too hard. I mean, I don't have too many
[1:23:04] deep scars.
[1:23:07] Sure would have liked to have went back
[1:23:08] there. But you see, when they were in
[1:23:11] Egypt, God used the travail of their
[1:23:14] taskmaster
[1:23:15] to give them desire to move out of
[1:23:18] Egypt.
[1:23:19] But it was their lack of faith, lack of
[1:23:22] trust in God that instead of holding
[1:23:25] holy to the promise of God and walking
[1:23:28] forward. Imagine now we understand God's
[1:23:31] plan, right? I mean, we can't explain
[1:23:34] all of the plan, but we understand by
[1:23:36] scripture God's plan. Amen. He's
[1:23:39] redeeming a people. Yeah, we can sum his
[1:23:41] plan up pretty simple by just saying
[1:23:43] he's redeeming a people. Now, we know
[1:23:46] that God knew that those people would
[1:23:48] come to the Red Sea and bulk.
[1:23:50] And we know that they would get out in
[1:23:52] the wilderness of sin and complain. And
[1:23:54] we know that when the brazen serpent was
[1:23:57] offered to them, they would actually
[1:23:59] reject the brazen serpent because they
[1:24:02] don't remember anything in their church
[1:24:04] doctrine about a brazen serpent. And so
[1:24:07] they refused to look at the brazen
[1:24:09] serpent because if they looked upon the
[1:24:11] brazen serpent, right, that was sin
[1:24:13] judged. unbelief judged. If they had
[1:24:16] looked at the brazen serpent, whatever
[1:24:18] the serpent tried, serpent could just
[1:24:20] bite over and over again. Now, I'm not
[1:24:23] going to bear my skinny legs, my brother
[1:24:25] and sister, but you could stood there
[1:24:27] maybe as a witness and pulled your pant
[1:24:29] leg up and said, "You guys are scared of
[1:24:32] the serpent.
[1:24:34] Are you guys with me?
[1:24:38] Look at these scars.
[1:24:41] Yeah, Satan
[1:24:43] bit me here.
[1:24:46] Bit me here. He's bit me here. Bit me
[1:24:49] here in my family. Bit me here by losing
[1:24:51] my job. He bit me here under this
[1:24:53] circumstance. He bit me here because of
[1:24:54] my children.
[1:24:57] But I looked to the brazen serpent
[1:25:01] and I live. Amen.
[1:25:04] The only thing that they didn't have was
[1:25:08] faith enough to look and live.
[1:25:13] Because imagine Joshua and Caleb turned
[1:25:17] out to be the the primary those that
[1:25:19] come out of Egypt to walk into the
[1:25:21] promised land. They they were the men.
[1:25:25] There could have been a whole group
[1:25:28] walked into the promised land, right?
[1:25:32] But they wouldn't look and live. They
[1:25:35] wouldn't trust, right? And they wouldn't
[1:25:37] obey.
[1:25:39] My Lord, don't let me be like that.
[1:25:43] Amen. Let me be of those. Amen. To see
[1:25:47] the travail which God had given to the
[1:25:49] sons of men to be exercised in it. But
[1:25:52] he have made everything beautiful in his
[1:25:54] time. And he set the world in their
[1:25:57] heart so that no man can find out the
[1:25:59] work that God maketh from the beginning
[1:26:01] to the end. You see, God put a veil
[1:26:03] right there that we can't go out here.
[1:26:05] And people today, just listening to all
[1:26:08] part of this little study I've been
[1:26:09] doing, listening to this man, he speaks
[1:26:13] every language. He purposely learned
[1:26:16] every language that's in the Bible.
[1:26:21] I'm working on English. Soon as I get
[1:26:23] over English, I'm going to move on into
[1:26:25] some of these others, Aramaic or Hebrew
[1:26:27] or whatever.
[1:26:29] But you see, my brother and sister,
[1:26:31] sounds judgmental, and I'm sorry, but
[1:26:33] fundamentals in the scripture refute
[1:26:36] what the man's interpretation of the
[1:26:38] scripture that he learned.
[1:26:41] It's not learning,
[1:26:44] right? It's revelation. It's God's
[1:26:46] showing us, not how many languages we
[1:26:51] know,
[1:26:53] because then he starts to talk about,
[1:26:55] well, what I don't understand is as we
[1:26:57] get to this and this sub dialect of of
[1:26:59] Hebrew and this blah blah blah, and they
[1:27:01] conflict.
[1:27:03] So, we're going to have to study this
[1:27:05] out some more.
[1:27:08] My
[1:27:10] scripture says, "Repent, be baptized,
[1:27:13] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:27:15] Holy Ghost." Translate that into
[1:27:18] Spanish, it says the same thing.
[1:27:19] Translated into Bulgarian, it says the
[1:27:21] same thing. Translated, it's the same
[1:27:24] thing. Repent.
[1:27:26] Amen. It's there. The same thing. Let me
[1:27:30] just hurry along here. Now, in Hebrews
[1:27:32] chapter 2, we'll look at this. God
[1:27:35] always bears witness. Your life will
[1:27:38] bear witness. This is the product of the
[1:27:40] gospel, my brother and sister. Your life
[1:27:42] will bear witness. I don't know what
[1:27:44] your testimony is, but your life speaks
[1:27:47] so loud your voice can't be heard.
[1:27:51] Wow. I mean, you think about that. We
[1:27:53] can say all kinds of things and I hope
[1:27:57] that my life is saying amen to what I'm
[1:28:00] speaking, not contradicting it. Right?
[1:28:03] That's what we want. We want our life to
[1:28:05] bear witness. Amen. Amen. So, uh, your
[1:28:08] voice can't be heard, but you're living
[1:28:10] your everyday life will testify what you
[1:28:12] are. God bears witness. Yes, the Holy
[1:28:14] Spirit is a seal. And a seal takes both
[1:28:17] sides of the paper. They see you
[1:28:19] standing here, and they see you when you
[1:28:21] go away. Not only in church, but at
[1:28:24] everyday work. You You're sealed on both
[1:28:27] sides, inside and outside, by the joy
[1:28:29] that you have, by the life that you
[1:28:31] live. you're sealed in and outside that
[1:28:34] you know you're saved and the world
[1:28:35] knows you're saved. Now, that's what I
[1:28:37] like, my brother and sister. That's what
[1:28:39] I want my life to be. Sometimes I feel
[1:28:41] like I come very short of that, but I
[1:28:43] don't want to have to go out here and
[1:28:45] tell people I'm a Christian. I'm a
[1:28:48] Christian. I'm a Christian. Did you know
[1:28:51] I'm a Christian? I want my life to
[1:28:53] testify I'm a Christian. Amen. And I
[1:28:56] want people to say, "We think he's a
[1:28:57] little weird.
[1:29:00] He's a Christian.
[1:29:02] Well, that's good. Weird is in the eye
[1:29:04] of the beholder, right? Just like beauty
[1:29:06] is in the eye of the beholder, weird is
[1:29:07] in the eye of the beholder. All right?
[1:29:10] The word says that they would worship in
[1:29:12] a way called heresy. So, some people say
[1:29:14] that's heresy and some of us say it's
[1:29:16] God. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:23] I lost myself. That you know you're
[1:29:26] saved and the world knows you're saved
[1:29:27] by the life that you live. For God bears
[1:29:29] witness. Blessed be his holy name. My I
[1:29:32] feel religious. Think of it, brethren.
[1:29:34] There. Oh, my sheep hear my voice and a
[1:29:37] stranger they won't follow. Oh, how that
[1:29:39] our names are in the palms of his hands.
[1:29:42] It's before him day and night. His word
[1:29:44] is always before him. His promise he
[1:29:46] can't forget it. And he loves you now.
[1:29:49] He'll bear witness of his own. You don't
[1:29:51] open your mouth and say a word and the
[1:29:53] world will know something has happened
[1:29:56] to you. Amen. Amen. We don't need to
[1:29:59] carry a placard. We don't need to carry
[1:30:01] a billboard. Now, I'm not deriding this,
[1:30:04] but I have uh there's a man here in the
[1:30:06] valley. He was involved in politics for
[1:30:08] a while. Uh he has some very strong
[1:30:11] stands on things. He's known in the
[1:30:13] state house. He's known on the radio.
[1:30:16] And and he said, I asked him one time, I
[1:30:19] got to know the gentleman. And I asked
[1:30:20] him one time, I said, "So, you know, why
[1:30:23] do you wear that?" You know that some
[1:30:25] people call them sandwich boards, you
[1:30:26] know, uh, why do you wear that and walk
[1:30:28] up and down the street, block traffic,
[1:30:30] do all this stuff? I want people to know
[1:30:32] I'm a Christian.
[1:30:35] You think that's really the testimony
[1:30:37] that makes people know you're a
[1:30:39] Christian?
[1:30:41] Well, here's where I'm going to sound
[1:30:43] judgmental. Forgive me. I've seen the
[1:30:45] man mad
[1:30:47] because someone approached him and
[1:30:49] questioned
[1:30:51] and I've seen him mad and everything
[1:30:54] that he said just flew out the window
[1:30:57] when he got mad.
[1:31:00] Now, we're probably all guilty of such
[1:31:02] things, right? So, I'm not judging him
[1:31:04] in that fashion, but I'm telling you,
[1:31:06] whatever his sign said and whatever he
[1:31:10] said contradicted each other. And Lord,
[1:31:14] help us not to be those kind of people.
[1:31:15] Amen. Lord, help us that when it does,
[1:31:17] we say, "Lord, forgive me." Because you
[1:31:19] see, my brother and sister, they're
[1:31:21] going to see us as we are. Amen. Now,
[1:31:26] every story is different, but every
[1:31:28] story is the same. Amen. I'll pick on
[1:31:31] Brother Trevor for a moment. Brother
[1:31:32] Trevor's life, a young man growing up
[1:31:34] and what he did and the city and music
[1:31:37] and and these kind of things, right?
[1:31:39] That was part of Brother Trevor's
[1:31:40] testimony. Uh my my youth and all of
[1:31:43] that was actually relatively boring. We
[1:31:46] were just these wild Indian kids that
[1:31:48] roamed over the countryside and and um
[1:31:52] you know whatever and and you do that.
[1:31:54] So if you get my example of two
[1:31:56] different stories, but when God comes,
[1:32:00] it's the same story. It doesn't matter
[1:32:03] about the details there. It doesn't
[1:32:05] matter anything. It is about what God
[1:32:08] writes the story to be. We can say, "I
[1:32:12] was a drug addict. I was horrible. I was
[1:32:13] a convict." Those of you who are family
[1:32:16] camp, you met Brother Jeff. Amen.
[1:32:18] Brother Jeff, I tried to contact you
[1:32:20] this morning, but you didn't answer. So,
[1:32:22] I'm using you anyway. So, but you look
[1:32:25] at Brother Jeff. He he was telling me
[1:32:27] holds his arms out, you know, look at
[1:32:28] this, Brother Jeff. You'll hear this,
[1:32:30] I'm sure, but uh forgive me. You know,
[1:32:32] skull and crossbones on the inside of
[1:32:34] this arm, you know, and all these
[1:32:35] different tattoos. And he says, "I'm so
[1:32:37] ashamed of who I am, Brother Paul." And
[1:32:40] I said, "Brother Jeff, you can't be
[1:32:42] ashamed of who you are. Who you are is
[1:32:45] what God called you to be." Amen. And he
[1:32:47] called you to go down a path so that
[1:32:50] someday you could stand before people
[1:32:52] and say if you've went down this path of
[1:32:55] of this nature of these things of these
[1:32:58] temptations and these trials and stand
[1:33:01] here today as an overcomer in Jesus
[1:33:04] Christ do not be ashamed of the path
[1:33:07] that God let you go down because
[1:33:09] somebody's going to have to testify.
[1:33:11] Amen. And if we're all liy white, well,
[1:33:14] to the sinner out here that's been bit
[1:33:16] by the serpent, how are you going to
[1:33:19] tell them just look and live if you've
[1:33:20] never been bit, right? All you'll be
[1:33:24] able to talk to him intellectually.
[1:33:27] But when you have an experience to be
[1:33:29] able to say, I've been there. I done
[1:33:32] that. I overcome it by God's grace.
[1:33:35] Amen. And I stand today as a believer in
[1:33:38] the word of God. Amen. See, every story
[1:33:41] different, but the same. We see the
[1:33:43] hour. The Lord's calling sheep. Amen.
[1:33:46] And he's calling them. We're seeing a
[1:33:48] lot happening around us. We're seeing
[1:33:50] God calling sheep. Amen. And what is
[1:33:53] this? Is it all about doctrines?
[1:33:56] If we never recognize that we've been
[1:33:59] called to be a sheep, it won't matter
[1:34:02] how much pile of doctrine there is.
[1:34:04] Amen. We've got to recognize that we are
[1:34:08] sons and daughters of God. We have to
[1:34:10] recognize that the word has come and is
[1:34:12] living in us. Amen. At the opening of
[1:34:15] the word, it's calling a people out of a
[1:34:17] people. Is that not what it is? Amen.
[1:34:19] And so, it's setting it in order. Amen.
[1:34:22] Let me just move along here.
[1:34:24] If you don't mind, I'll close out on
[1:34:26] this. This just as I come across it, it
[1:34:30] just stirred me and I really, really
[1:34:32] want to. Hear ye him.
[1:34:36] You don't mind if I read this out, do
[1:34:38] you?
[1:34:40] I live on the Ohio River years ago. I
[1:34:42] heard a little story of a little boy
[1:34:43] that lived up there above us there. And
[1:34:46] he went to church and Sunday school and
[1:34:48] one day wanted to know who God was. And
[1:34:50] he said to his mommy, "Mommy, could you
[1:34:52] tell me who God is? Can I see him?" And
[1:34:55] his mommy said, "Well, I'd asked the
[1:34:58] Sunday school teacher." In other words,
[1:34:59] mom don't have an answer.
[1:35:01] which is kind of a shame that mama
[1:35:04] doesn't have an answer cuz this ain't a
[1:35:06] matter of I'm just a mama, right? This a
[1:35:09] matter of being a son or daughter of God
[1:35:11] is what gives us the answer. Not where I
[1:35:14] went to school or how much school I
[1:35:16] have. But our position in Jesus Christ,
[1:35:22] can I see him? Mommy said, "Well, I'd
[1:35:25] ask my Sunday school teacher." So he
[1:35:27] asked his Sunday school teacher. She
[1:35:29] said, "Well, I don't know. asked the
[1:35:31] pastor, went to the pastor and the
[1:35:34] pastor said,"Certainly not, son. No one
[1:35:37] can see God."
[1:35:39] Said, "God is a spirit, therefore no one
[1:35:41] can see him." And that didn't satisfy
[1:35:44] the curiosity of the little lad.
[1:35:47] So he used to go up the river to Six
[1:35:49] Mile Island with an old fisherman. And
[1:35:52] this old fisherman, old and gray hair,
[1:35:54] gray beard, and one day come up a storm,
[1:35:57] and on the road back, the fisherman
[1:35:59] pulling his boat. In case you're
[1:36:00] wondering what that means, he was rowing
[1:36:01] it. Okay? He wasn't pulling it behind
[1:36:04] his, you know, SUV
[1:36:08] pulling his boat and the little boy
[1:36:09] sitting in the back, the stern of the
[1:36:11] boat as the old fisherman was pulling
[1:36:13] the boat. Oh, how beautiful is here in
[1:36:16] Indiana after a rain. There must be some
[1:36:18] attraction to people there. Uh, and the
[1:36:21] leaves are all washed off and that real
[1:36:23] fresh smell, just a little riffle on the
[1:36:25] water, enough to make your boat or clip
[1:36:27] as you draw them. Everyone who pulls a
[1:36:29] boat knows that the rhythm of the boat.
[1:36:31] And he kept looking over his shoulder as
[1:36:33] he watched there was a rainbow that come
[1:36:35] out, circled the whole horizon. And that
[1:36:38] old fisherman as he watched the rainbow
[1:36:40] begin to weep
[1:36:42] and tears come down out of his eyes over
[1:36:45] his gray beard. And this little lad
[1:36:48] sitting in the back of the boat kept
[1:36:50] watching him.
[1:36:52] And he got so enthused.
[1:36:55] Now, let's just bust the myth that all
[1:36:58] old men are grouchy. That's right.
[1:37:05] Yeah. We get little myths, you know.
[1:37:07] That's right. You know, I'm grumpy
[1:37:10] because I'm old. You're grumpy because
[1:37:13] you haven't been reading this. Yeah.
[1:37:16] Yeah.
[1:37:18] The little lad sitting in the back of
[1:37:19] the boat kept watching. He got so
[1:37:20] enthused he ran up to the center of the
[1:37:21] boat, fell down to the old fisherman's
[1:37:23] lap, and said, "Sir, I'm going to ask
[1:37:24] you a question. My mother cannot answer.
[1:37:26] My Sunday school teacher cannot answer.
[1:37:28] Neither can my pastor answer. He said,
[1:37:30] "Can a man see God?"
[1:37:32] Why? He pulled the oars into his grab
[1:37:35] the little fellow up in his arms. This
[1:37:37] God bless your little heart. All I've
[1:37:40] seen for the past 40 years has been God.
[1:37:46] If there's God in here, Amen. you'll see
[1:37:51] God out there. That's right. Amen.
[1:37:54] Hallelujah. Sister Ruth,
[1:37:58] I trust this all made sense this
[1:37:59] morning. Amen. It just was something uh
[1:38:03] Oh, I didn't finish that. He will
[1:38:05] reflect himself no matter where it's at.
[1:38:08] Amen. It was a little something to
[1:38:09] disturb me and I I just, you know, kind
[1:38:12] of I know it's kind of simplistic, but I
[1:38:14] I think that the deep things are much
[1:38:18] more simple than we sometimes believe.
[1:38:21] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:38:26] Amen.
[1:38:28] I want Brother Isaac to come up and just
[1:38:31] lead us in a few songs. I don't know if
[1:38:32] somebody can run the program for him. I
[1:38:35] didn't pay enough attention to know who
[1:38:36] ran it this morning. Amen.
[1:38:40] So
[1:38:44] 8:24, he knows my name. Amen. Aren't you
[1:38:48] glad? Let's just stand and worship the
[1:38:49] Lord for just a few minutes this
[1:38:51] morning. Amen. I love this song because
[1:38:54] it really shows us very clearly
[1:38:57] this whole picture just as that little
[1:38:59] boy needed to see the picture
[1:39:02] to realize we have a maker. Amen.
[1:39:05] And your heart that wants to serve God
[1:39:08] wants to serve God because he formed
[1:39:10] your heart to serve God.
[1:39:14] Amen. and to recognize that our life has
[1:39:16] always been in his hand.
[1:39:19] Your life never, no matter what's
[1:39:21] happened in your life, no matter as you
[1:39:23] look at the gospel and you say, "I was a
[1:39:25] ranked sinner. I I had lust of the
[1:39:27] flesh, pride of life. I had addictions.
[1:39:29] I had this. I had that." If you'll
[1:39:31] recognize those were all just symptoms
[1:39:34] of Satan trying to get you to a place to
[1:39:37] not believe. But the minute belief come
[1:39:40] into your heart, those things disappear.
[1:39:43] Those things no longer there.
[1:39:46] I have a maker
[1:39:53] before
[1:39:55] my heart.
[1:40:00] And before even time began,
[1:40:05] my life was in his hand.
[1:40:13] He knows my name.
[1:40:17] [Music]
[1:40:20] He knows my every thought.
[1:40:27] He sees each tear that falls
[1:40:32] and hears me when I call.
[1:40:37] [Music]
[1:40:40] I have a father.
[1:40:45] [Music]
[1:40:46] He calls me his own
[1:40:53] and he'll never
[1:40:56] leave me
[1:40:59] no matter
[1:41:01] where I go.
[1:41:06] He knows my name.
[1:41:10] [Music]
[1:41:13] He knows my every thought.
[1:41:19] He sees each tear that falls
[1:41:25] and hears me when I call.
[1:41:32] I have a father.
[1:41:39] He calls me his own
[1:41:45] and he'll never
[1:41:48] leave me
[1:41:51] no matter where I go.
[1:41:57] He knows my name.
[1:42:04] He knows my every thought.
[1:42:10] He sees each tear that falls
[1:42:16] and hears me when I call.
[1:42:23] Amen. What a blessed revelation that is.
[1:42:26] Hallelujah.
[1:42:28] As he was talking about our brother
[1:42:30] Jeff, I love I loved that guy.
[1:42:33] What a wonderful, you know, it just made
[1:42:36] me think of this song, Unseen Hand. You
[1:42:37] know, we don't understand why we go
[1:42:39] through things sometimes or the trial or
[1:42:42] whatever it is. But
[1:42:45] he leads and guides me. If you're one of
[1:42:47] his, he's going to lead and guide you no
[1:42:48] matter what. Amen. Where you're standing
[1:42:50] today, he led you to that point. Amen.
[1:42:56] There he is.
[1:42:58] of
[1:43:02] seen hand to me
[1:43:08] that leads in way.
[1:43:14] I cannot see
[1:43:20] while going through
[1:43:25] this world of woke
[1:43:31] this hand still
[1:43:37] me as I go.
[1:43:43] I'm trusting to
[1:43:46] [Music]
[1:43:48] the unseen
[1:43:51] hand
[1:43:54] that guides me through
[1:44:00] this weery land
[1:44:04] [Music]
[1:44:05] and some sweet day
[1:44:10] I'll reach That strength
[1:44:16] still guided by
[1:44:21] the unseen
[1:44:24] hand.
[1:44:27] This hand has led
[1:44:31] [Music]
[1:44:33] through shadows
[1:44:35] tree.
[1:44:39] And while it leaves
[1:44:44] I have no fear.
[1:44:50] I know will lead
[1:44:55] me to that home
[1:45:00] where sin no sorrow
[1:45:05] or air can come.
[1:45:11] I'm trusting to
[1:45:16] the unseen
[1:45:18] hand.
[1:45:22] that guides me through
[1:45:27] this weery land.
[1:45:32] And some sweet day
[1:45:37] I'll reach that strand.
[1:45:43] still guided by
[1:45:48] the unseen
[1:45:50] hand.
[1:45:52] Amen.
[1:45:54] I long to see
[1:45:59] my Savior's face
[1:46:05] and sing the stor
[1:46:11] by grave
[1:46:15] and there upon
[1:46:20] that golden strand. Hallelujah.
[1:46:25] I'll praise him for
[1:46:30] his guiding hand.
[1:46:36] Trusting to
[1:46:41] the unseen hand
[1:46:46] that guides me through
[1:46:51] this weery land.
[1:46:56] And some sweet day
[1:47:01] I'll reach that strength
[1:47:07] guided by
[1:47:12] the unseen
[1:47:14] hand.
[1:47:18] Hallelujah.
[1:47:19] Praise God. See was just reading that
[1:47:21] last quote. I don't know if you have
[1:47:23] that handy, Ivan. Just the last part of
[1:47:26] that quote on here ye him
[1:47:28] [Music]
[1:47:34] says there at the bottom. If there's a
[1:47:35] God in here, you'll see God out there.
[1:47:38] He will reflect himself no matter where
[1:47:41] it's at.
[1:47:43] Amen. It just made me think of the the
[1:47:44] words of yet not I but Christ in me. As
[1:47:48] we dismiss today, let's just sing that
[1:47:50] together.
[1:47:51] Just give him thanks. Amen.
[1:47:54] Amen.

[1:48:17] He is my joy,
[1:48:20] my righteousness
[1:48:23] and freedom.
[1:48:26] My steadfast love,
[1:48:30] my deep and boundless peace.
[1:48:36] To this I hope.
[1:48:39] My hope is only Jesus.
[1:48:45] For my life
[1:48:48] is wholly bound to him.
[1:48:55] Oh how strange and divine
[1:48:59] I can sing. All is mine yet not I but
[1:49:07] through Christ
[1:49:09] in me.
[1:49:13] The night is dark
[1:49:16] but I am not forsaken.
[1:49:22] For by my side
[1:49:25] the Savior he will stay.
[1:49:31] I labor on
[1:49:34] in weakness and rejoiceing
[1:49:39] for in my need
[1:49:43] his power is displayed.
[1:49:49] To this I hope
[1:49:52] my shepherd will defend me
[1:49:58] through the deepest
[1:50:02] valley he will lead.
[1:50:07] Oh, the night has been one and I shall
[1:50:14] overcome
[1:50:16] yet not I but through Christ
[1:50:22] in me.
[1:50:25] Fate I dread.
[1:50:28] I know I am forgi.
[1:50:32] Hallelujah.
[1:50:34] The future's sure,
[1:50:37] the price it has been paid.
[1:50:43] For Jesus bled
[1:50:46] and suffered for my pardon,
[1:50:52] and he was raised
[1:50:55] to overthrow the grave.
[1:51:01] To this I hold.
[1:51:04] My sin has been defeated.
[1:51:10] Jesus now
[1:51:13] and ever is my plea.
[1:51:19] Oh the chains are released.
[1:51:23] I can sing. I am free yet not I. But
[1:51:30] through Christ
[1:51:33] in me
[1:51:36] with every breath
[1:51:40] I long to follow Jesus
[1:51:45] for he has said
[1:51:48] that he will bring me home.
[1:51:54] And day by day
[1:51:57] I know he will renew me
[1:52:03] until I stand
[1:52:06] with joy before the throne.
[1:52:10] [Music]
[1:52:12] To this I hope.
[1:52:15] My hope is only Jesus.
[1:52:21] All the glory
[1:52:24] ever more to him.
