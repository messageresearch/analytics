all I need amen I have a quandry between two songs here but I was listening to a message a couple days ago and Prophet was given an account where two sisters had come to his meeting from a couple hundred miles away one had stomach ulcers and the other had a gler on her neck or a tumor on her neck sorry and um he just had the word of the Lord for him said thus they sayith the Lord you're healed and um didn't happen right away it uh they got the car and they drove home you know 3 4 hours or 2 three hours home and uh the next morning still didn't happen but they kept believing and um even the one lady with the ulcers her husband came to her and said you know H honey I I understand that you believe that you are healed but you know you're kind of like you're um making it look bad right um because it hasn't manifest itself and she said to him she said you know sweetie I love you but that man told me where I was from he told me my name he told me what was wrong with me and then he said thus sayith the Lord you're healed and I believe it and she said if it if 50 years goes by I'll keep saying it but I believe I'm Healed well within the next day she said said she was washing the dishes and a cool feeling came over her and um she didn't think nothing of it she went on washing the dishes but within a few minutes she got really hungry really hungry and so she said I got to eat something so she went and she ate something just stomach felt fine she said well I know what I'll do the kids had left some oats on the table before they you know they had left for school and oats really messed messed with her ulcers so she ate the oats after a couple hours she had no problems she said praise the Lord I'm Healed I'm Healed Hallelujah so she made herself bacon and eggs and a whole meal and ate it and no problem so she said you know I'm going to walk down the street I'm going to tell the other lady I don't remember her name I'm I'm going walk down the street I'm going tell the other lady you know Lord Zord healed me it's done so she walks down the street and she gets close to the house and she hears a bunch of screaming and [Music] hollering and she gets the door and rips open the door says what's wrong what's wrong lady shaking the sheets out she said I woke up this morning and it's gone and I thought it must be in the sheets or something and I thought to myself Hallelujah no God's so awesome but the prophet goes on he said you know didn't happen right away said sometimes God takes a few minutes said but he just happened to be passing through the neighborhood that morning I thought to myself Hallelujah Lord Jesus made me think of this song Pass Me Not A Gentle Savior you know whatever's going on out there I I don't care don't forget me Lord Jesus pass me not I just love the words to the last verse thou the spring of all my comfort more than life to me Hallelujah let's just stand and sing this as we ask our brother Paul to come pass me not oh gentle

Do not pass me by amen oh s [Music] you I hear my humble cry on others thou are calling do not pass Me by Hallelujah you know we have been blessed with the promise of the power of God here tonight with us it doesn't matter how many we don't have to have a great crowd we don't have to even be a noisy crowd we just have to be a submitted contrite seeking him as the song says reach out Out and Touch the Lord amen that's what we have to do we have to put our effort and put it out to touch the Lord we want to remember uh my daughter jolen um aiyah is home tonight with her mom jolen's going to Mexico for the Christmas season to spend that with her husband Gustavo and uh so we just want to remember them in prayer amen I had you on my prayer list brother vasile but you're right here and we can lay hands on on you so God bless you amen our brother Sergey out on the road just a lot happening in the world today my brother and sister I I told sister Jerry this morning I got up and I opened up the news feed on the computer and I went back out of the office and I I told her you know what the world's just as crazy this morning as it was yesterday but this bride of Christ is that much closer today than she was yesterday amen I thank the Lord for that Hallelujah so I just want to speak to you uh uh this morning this evening uh maybe of the overall topic what is your vision uh but uh I want to uh title our thought tonight uh finding favor with the father and um just uh want to thank our musicians amen uh we uh went the other night and visited sister Joanne I'm not sure how the family is on the visiting schedule but we were given kind of an open uh open door to to go visit and definitely remember our sister she's in a lot of pain every time she would kind of try to adjust herself in the bed you could see her uh wise uh from the pain and um so you know our sister Joanne she's there I must admit a little feeble lifting a hand up and saying and praise God I'm healed amen never giving up amen the devil would say you you've had your years or your this or your that but remember the word now my brother and sister this is spoken to the prophet but the prophet really was just bringing what the word was spoken to us amen don't fear amen never fear amen our King our Lord our savior is present with us amen let's turn in our Bible this evening and I meant I even mentioned this to Sister Jerry then got caught up in other things um if some of you know how to pronounce these names uh you know just feel free to do it or you can just sit back and listen to me slaughter them uh because I've never really been that good at pronouncing many of these names in scripture but Joshua the 15th chapter just have a little thought tonight uh you know uh sister Jerry always tells me don't say it's going to be short don't say it don't say it keep it to yourself because every time I think I'm going to have a short service I somehow find some inspiration or go off on a tangent whichever you would call that but uh tonight Joshua 15: 13 through 19 and um you know we're going to just draw this little thought out of the scripture tonight just to uh recognize that there comes a time that we as believers amen Sons and Daughters of God we're going to identify today uh with uh Caleb's daughter uh so we're all going to step into that position and recognize where she was coming from and I think she would be very symbolic as it would be as a daughter of God the bride of Christ and recognizing something's been promised to her and yesterday she didn't necessarily go to seek that maybe a few months period of time previous never felt an anointing to claim it but we're going to look in the scripture here and unto Caleb the son of Jeep thuna he gave a part among the children of Judah according to the Commandment of the Lord to Joshua so this is the word now being fulfilled even though it's being passed down it's moving down but there comes a season and the word must be fulfilled Can someone say Amen it we we're seeing the word fulfilled and it might be you know I would love to have seen it uh you know some things manifest in my own life years ago but God even brings us to a season as we get older that we get to see the word fulfilled and we get to see the seasons come and so here we see now that uh was given apart among the children of Judah according to the Commandment of the Lord to Joshua even the city of arba and the father of anak which is a city uh which city is Hebron and Caleb drove then the three sons of anch jesiah and hamian and talmi the children of anch and he went up then into the inhabitants of De and the name of deir before was well I don't know how to even pronounce that karath seur and Caleb said he that smiteth Karo safur and taketh it to him will I give Asha my daughter to wife young ladies how do you feel if your daddy comes along and says you know what young men just go conquer these guys and I'll give you Victoria doesn't say anything about love doesn't say anything about any of that it's just you do this and here's the prize wow but you know God he never fails he knows what he's doing there might be a backstory there maybe this young man was very brave because he was very much in love you know imagine now it'd be like huh if my best friend goes up there he gets my girl I'm going to be brave Lord help me be brave because I'm not going to lose my girl to someone else because they were braver than I H just a side thought and so it was there he that smiteth and taketh it to him will I give uh my daughter to wife and oan the son of kazaz canaz the brother of Caleb so remember the the Bloodlines were a little different in that day took it and he gave him see here's a young man rises up boom done finished I get the girl gave him Asha his daughter to wife man I tell you how that comes down I think many a young man in love would figure he'd try and conquer the world and it came to pass as she come unto him that she moved him to ask of her father a field so something's happening here this is a catalyst now remember this promise is not to her new husband he is actually wanting her new husband to speak to his father-in-law to take care of business but she comes writing up and I want to be polite tonight and we'll just um we'll just cover it this way and it came to pass as she came unto him that she moved to ask of her father a field and as she lighted off of her donkey and Caleb said unto her what would EST thou who answered give me a blessing so here's a daughter coming Desiring a blessing anybody need a blessing tonight amen give us courage Lord to just be brave enough to ask for the blessing amen we're Sons and Daughters of God the blessing's there for us to ask she could have said well I don't want to bother my dad I don't want to I don't know you know just how this is but this girl was bold and she says you know what I I'm now a married woman uh and uh this is going to be Legacy of my family this is my legacy of God's promise that was spoken through Joshua and I'm going to claim it I'm going to claim it maybe she intended for her husband to claim it as it were but the promise was actually to her so never forget who the promise is to give me a blessing for thou Hast given me a Southland give me also Springs of water and he gave her the upper Springs and the nether Springs which is the lower Springs Heavenly Father we just ask you to bless this time together tonight be with our brothers and sisters who are not here tonight Lord strengthen them and father for those that Doe to weather whatever it might be just ask for your hand of Mercy on each and everyone in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated so as we can go back in scripture and we can see the word that was spoken to Joshua and my brother and sister when God spoke to Joshua to rise up and go and possess the land he he didn't say go see if you can possess the land but he gave him a direct command to possess the land and uh I think sometimes we maybe give up a little too easy maybe there's something in our life a little little Thorn In the Flesh as the Apostle Paul said and you know we just kind of give up overcoming that thing after after a while maybe maybe a need for healing in our body and you know after a while we just decide we're going to live with it but my brother and sister when God gives you a promise when God gives you h a a a a very clear Vision out of the word it's not to see if you can amen we are not here today hoping to overcome things like cancer uh overcome the spirits of this age the word has declared that we are more than Overcomers and so we really need to approach everything thing that we're doing with the idea or fact I should say we're more than Overcomers not I'm trying to overcome but literally declare whatever this is Satan depart because I'm more than an overcomer so that is defeated in my life and I will manifest it I thought it was very nice brother Isaac sharing that because you see when it was thus sayith the Lord you are healed you have to carry on if you got up the next morning and said I guess that whatever that was it wasn't for me my brother and sister sometimes it takes action it takes some sometimes someone rising up and saying you know what I don't care what my feelings are my circumstance is God said it I believe it and I'm going to keep walking until I see it manifested amen and the problem we have sometimes is Satan is so good at warming in there and undermining the things of God that after a while we can make statements like well I guess healing wasn't for me Deliverance wasn't for me this wasn't for me or that wasn't for me that's not what the word said the word said it's been given to you amen and when a prophet of God put thus saith the Lord on it my brother and sister that should give even more confidence but I'm telling you my brother and sister when it said by your stripes you are healed that is thus saeth the Lord amen when you are delivered my brother and sister of all of these Spirits it is thus saith the Lord amen now is it more encouraging to maybe have a prophet of God to stand there and to declare that to you but we're living in an age of revealed word my brother and sister and every bit of this right here is thus saith the Lord and let's take it with the same confidence if the prophet was standing here and spoke it to us amen whether we're claiming a son or a daughter claiming a family member a husband a wife whatever it would be my brother and sister when the word said that we can come and claim them I heard a minister I'll just share this I heard a minister bring it this way if you have to tear the roof off and lower your family into the presence of God Amen start tearing the roof off don't sit back and say well I just hope I just hope I'm just thinking no my brother and sister if you need to tear the shingles off and lower them down in the presence of God start tearing the shingles off amen now you see it's not as we have here the Lord speaks to Joshua tells him to rise up and possess the land as I said already not go see if you can possess it or not this is not an experiment my brother and sister this is the word of God coming to pass amen so when you go to possess the land what does that really mean now we we don't want to Sidetrack into this but you see even in such a strong promise we recognize today wasn't didn't they share with us brother Trevor sister Carrie sister Jerry wasn't that Israel possesses 177% yes 17% of the land promised to them so you see my brother and sister even in possessing the land Israel is there as a nation but they did not fully possess the promise of the spoken word for them amen so it's one thing to say we've got the land but do we have all the land that God has promised us amen and that is a full complete deliverance a full and complete filling of the Holy Spirit a full and complete revelation of Jesus Christ not partials not we tried and we'll settle for this but God help us my brother and sister to possess the land amen and he also told them divide the land so you look at this and and you know people are have different ideas and they'll say well you know uh uh we see the Holy Ghost fell uh fell here and we see the Holy Ghost fell here and you know where does this fit uh you know even even well I don't want to get into a negative aspect but people will be like well some of that is just reserved for the ministry give me a quote give me scripture it's just reserved for Ministry all that was in Christ H did he pour it out or not amen we have to believe it's been poured out we can't sit back and say he held some back and gave it away secretly or or just left it on the Shelf it's been poured out my brother and sister we are here to possess the land amen not worried about what the inhabitant spirits of the land are but simply possess the land because this is who we were called to be right and you know what happened in Israel as we see it today even they allowed certain people to stay certain things they they created alliances you know I find it interesting just following a little deal along through some college students that m and large you can tell don't even believe there's a God and they bring up well if God is such a loving God why did he tell these people tell his people the Jews to kill everybody that don't sound like love but you see my brother and sister how God chose to phrase that I'm not concerned about what I see in that is God's telling you and I not to allow someone else some other Spirit to inhabit Our Land amen we've got to kill every single Spirit every single inhabitant because This Land is Our Land we're not here by compromise we're not here by some kind of shared joint tency we are here to be filled with the Holy Ghost God help us amen be filled with the Holy Ghost and let this be our land amen that we have possessed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so he tells them to possess the land he tells them to divide the land and it's there that time comes that you know division of the land my brother and sister uh I don't want to get too far off track tonight but you know God has gifts in the church but God didn't give everybody every gift so in the division of the Land There are some that have been given certain gifts and and uh they are to edify the body now never to edify the person it's there to edify the body so we don't run around as it would be by some kind of jealousy that this brother has this and I don't have well maybe your gift would be a gift that would be hardly recognized and that would be a gift say that you every day through prayer are lifting up and building up the body of Christ not a very public display right we're not publicans we're not going to or or the Pharisees we're not going to stand on the corner oh and I pray for you and I pray for this and I no no our prayer our gift might be a prayer Warrior gift that would be completely out of sight and out of mind but effective amen necessary to be done and sometimes we look at this and and you know say well that brother he's just so blessed God gave him this gift well my brother and sister maybe you don't know the full struggle of that gift you don't know what he sacrifices to fulfill God's call in his life and so it's there that we recognize that God is is dividing the land to each one of us according to to his desire not even according to our own Talent OR ability I always find it amazing that people that maybe don't have the best voice many times are very prolific in singing uh specials and things like that and people are like boy if I had a voice like that I would not sing well you don't understand they're manifesting a gift that was not in the flesh it was in the spirit and they are giving praise to God because they've been anointed to praise God and they're not going to let a poor voice I mean how many of us if God gave us a choice you know make you short and stubby make you you know have a big word on your nose give you a poor voice make you knock needed we wouldn't go through that list yes yes yes that's what I want to be yes but you'll find the body of Christ possesses every attribute so do we have to have a great voice to share a gift no no don't be thinking I'm trying to be political here and get specials out of you and encourage some of you that doesn't sing to sing well maybe I am but anyway look at this my brother and sister you see when the Anointed God doesn't care about the vessel he cares about what's in the vessel and when he's in the vessel The Vessel will be able to possess the land that God has given them are you with me tonight amen so look at this so as it is it's one thing divide the land and for the people to lay claim to the land but my brother and sister sometimes we lay claim to things I hope this doesn't pinch too much sometimes we lay claim to things that we make no actual effort to obtain I repented I got baptized I go to church so automatically I have the Holy Ghost right no you see there has to be something deeper inside to express the desire to possess what God promised us amen and I pray that each and every one Amen in this uh assembly this body of Believers would be filled with the Holy Ghost but it's not an automatic it's not just a given there's been many a person my brother and sister that thought that they could just sit back and do nothing and God would do this work for them but there has to be a faith that rise up there has to be an action that's taken and sometimes that action might just be your voice declaring thank you Lord for healing me and that voice if you could see would be like a wave going out through the atmosphere and it's changing everything around you and it's then increasing your own faith when you say I'm Healed I've got the Holy Ghost I'm going to make a a Rapture what you're doing is your voice is ringing out it's changing you know this is scientific right a voice creates a wave as it is a sound wave that goes out and it's changing an atmosphere around you what are you doing possessing the land I'm going to possess my healing I'm going to declare I'm Healed until the physical manifestation appears and proves that I'm Healed I believe it and I declare it and it is there that as Sons and Daughters of God we have to come to a place let our voice be raised up and let the impact of the wave of our voice touch the the world Amen the atmosphere I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ and when we grasp that not just as token words to be spoken but from our soul and we speak that forward we will start to live like the bride of Christ we'll start to think like the bride of Christ walk like the bride of Christ read the word like we are the bride of Christ because there has to be something that comes to prove my brother and sister that we are actually possessing this land amen I've had such scattered thoughts on this I hope it's making sense to you tonight amen you see sometimes we lay claim but nothing really happens amen but I'm here tonight to tell you that we are called to a higher calling amen we're not to be out here like the world and approach it all like the world we're not of them amen we were never called and in fact we were called to come out of them amen so there's a separation where we approach this land this promise that is given to us in an entirely different fashion amen and as we know it's then spoken to us that footsteps are possession my brother and sister I don't mean to be rude tonight but are we walking are we moving forward oh I I brother Paula had a rough week I don't feel like I didn't ask about feelings God didn't ask about feelings he asked you to possess the land and can we keep walking in the good days and the bad days mean moving forward possessing the land it's a it's actually a requirement my brother and sister we're going to have to possess the land am amen you know no we're not possessing leoda we're not possessing as it would be some chunk of land in the state of Idaho we're possessing a spiritual land a spiritual position that we move forward in amen so it here once again I want to just reiterate this your voice let it announce to the world let it tell the devil you know I remember years ago I used to think boy that brother's confident telling the devil get out of my way but literally we are my brother and sister you got to remember the sons of anch were some big guys they weren't little runty guys they were some Warriors they were you might say almost born and bred of these Mighty Warriors a a Fierce People and no wonder some you know there at kades barnea looked out and said we can't conquer these guys but you see what they had lost in that short period of time and the prophet of God speaks about this in our day how in such a short period of time we've lost the revelation of who we are and what we are supposed to be doing by the time they had waited across Jordan and marched into the land they had already lost the revelation of what it was to be the Conqueror yeah amen they had lost the Revelation that they were going to go out Scout the land they were going to see Victory m not how big the men are not how Fierce it is how walled the cities are they were supposed to go into the land and see Victory and come back and have a report brother Trevor we are going to going to take this land Lord amen it's been given to us I'm going to possess this land now I lay that out as a foundation a little bit as we move forward because sometimes my brother and sister things are easy come easy go God actually wants us to fight yeah sometimes God makes us walk out of this life spiritually scars on us you imagine imine you imagine we all make it to heaven we are rejoicing on the other side and there's not a scratch on us and all around us are these Warriors of the faith that are battle scarred I think they would look at us and say there's something wrong here amen but we're going to come and be just as battle scarred as any generation as any church age see we can't go on flowery beds of East we're going to be battle scarred you know let's not ask God to hide us in a bush somewhere let's ask God to let us manifest what's already in US amen and possess what's already been granted to us Amen Let me hurry along here you see as we looked at this scripture my brother and sister we see that she comes and approaches her father and uh you know the acknowledgement is is that you've already given me the South land so she already Is possessing now through a gift right that was thus saeth the Lord brought down and pass to her amen you ever notice how God does work in families he does carry things often times not always but often times he runs it through lineages and brings things down and I think that's beautiful amen but you see that it was there that she says you know I I want a blessing you've already given me the land I've already got possession of some of this in other words I can identify the ownership now if I could just put it to you this way tonight we already recognize that God sent Malachi for and revealed it opened it up to us and we see that in the word and we go then further into the word and we see all the promises that were meant to be fulfilled in this day men they couldn't be fulfilled in the sixth Church age or the fifth or fourth or third or 2nd or first but they are be fulfilled in this day and we'll look at that and realize hey there is a lot of responsibility that comes back on you and I it's not just God sent a prophet right we can all recognize that it's not just God sent a prophet what did that Prophet bring to us he brought us the Revelation that we possess the key to the land amen as Peter had the key key to the gospel amen the keys to the gospel God has through the revealed word of this hour given us the key to unlock this mystery or be able to see this mystery of who we are in this day and that's why it's so troubling when you see Believers of the message who don't really see who they are they just see there's a great mystery there's a message here there's something here but you see my brother and sister I hope this is this type not Doctrine tonight but you see what happens is you can have the land in other words see that God has sent a prophet and revealed word in this day but what good is the land if there's no water water represents life it can be represented as a spirit amen it is there my brother and sister that we possess land in other words know this message is true but if there's no water to make it grow and produce life we can have the Dead letter amen and know that that is truth without the life that would spring forth out of that you know when people are confident if I could just put it to you this way it doesn't always work for them but my brother and sister you want to know a confidence of the times and the seasons is when you go more North and see wheat Farmers planting wheat into ground that is dry six in deep but they still plant the seed because they know the water is going to come they know that it's going to rain in the right season and when that soil gets wet and it soaks down and the moisture that's underneath and the surface comes together they know that that is going to bring life amen have you ever felt dry Hallelujah we felt dry did you know though that you were a son or daughter of God Amen and so God brings in the season amen what we know deep down inside of us is there he brings a new moisture as it were he brings uh Showers of blessing come down on us and it Springs something to life amen some it just stays dry and it dies some don't have enough moisture the parable of the SE my brother and sister to get them going but there's a people can someone say Amen tonight there's a people that God said I planted you in good soil and I'm bringing the water of the word into your life I'm pouring my spirit out upon you and you are going to bring forth fruit Hallelujah not to be raised up to die and Wither on the road side but uh there it is and so here is is Caleb's daughter telling him I've got the land you've given me land but this land is not going to produce what it should produce unless I have the spring I need the water for my sheep or goats or horses or camels or whatever it is I need water uh to water them but maybe I also need water to grow feed for them and so dad what I want you to do amen finding favor with the father amen she come I want a blessing you know the minute that Caleb said I'll give you a blessing she didn't have to name Springs but if you see the spiritual type of this make that connection you'll realize she recognize the land can I just put it real personal my church AG book doesn't mean nothing unless I'm anointed to see what it really says yes sir take it down the prophet of God said your Bible when you get that Revelation your Bible becomes a whole new book why is it not a new book for everyone because you need the washing you need the life you need the spirit you need water and it's really easy to live isn't it when you're on top of the mountain right so she got the upper Springs I think even the positioning of it my brother and sister to me is a significance because he gives her the upper spring but the upper spring won't do any good when they're in the valley are you with me amen when you're on top of the mountain praise God all is well you still need a drink and when life is tough and you're in the valley you really need a drink amen so she wasn't wanting to just settle for it just a little bit you know I'll dig you a little ditch or we'll carry you some water she wanted all of it can someone say I want all of it amen I want all you've got for me Lord I don't want to just settle for a little bite or a little sip on a Sunday or on a Wednesday or at a special meeting I want all you've got for me and it's here in the book just describing amen what God promised through Moses and handed down to be manifested through Joshua right Jehovah savior amen coming down and Caleb a True Believer standing there and he laid enough seed in his own family that one day his daughter recognizes hey I've got an inheritance it's not daddy's inheritance it's not Uncle Joshua was inheritance this is my inheritance God has promised this to me and I want it oh can we say Amen tonight I want it it's my inheritance problem is we raised way too many people young and old in the message that they thought it was a prophet's inheritance failed to realize they stopped it at Moses or Joshua amen didn't realize that the promise of the word made it their inheritance made it their overcoming power made it their healing made it their anointing of the holy spirit amen made it their uh anointing of the blood washing over them cleansing them they didn't have to look back to another day I hope I'm making sense tonight you look at this my brother and sister see Asha recognized her need it's not about her daddy anymore are you are you with me not about what happened at Katie sparia she's standing in the the land on the land and says this word of Malachi 4 is for me not just fulfilling scripture you are the scripture fulfilled you are God fulfilling the word in this hour the Lord amen so it's there she says you gave me the Southland give me the Springs of water and he gave her he wasn't stingy right God's not stingy amen father wouldn't give his children a serpent or a Rock Amen so he gives her the upper Springs and he gives her the nether Springs which is the lower amen and you look at this we've made our claim on the land isn't it wonderful I I tell you my brother and sister it's a supernatural claim otherwise we'd just be dare I say in public we'd just be Baptists we'd be nazarine or really want to water it down and stretch it out we might even be Mormons or Catholics they recognize that God is real they recognize many of those believe God's A Healer but something's lacking because they believe they're fulfilling Joshua or I should let's take it back to Moses Moses's words and then Joshua's word by just going to church quite honestly I'm glad God never called me to be a Catholic priest because quite honestly I don't want oh this will come out wrong as a man I don't want to hear your problems I hope that's not too blunt I said as a man not as a Shepherd I I will I'll claim my my position but as a man I just sitting today you know my brother volunteered me for something and I'm hearing this whole dialogue going on and my brain is playing over and over again this short clip drama drama drama drama pretty soon I'm just like drama drama in my flesh I couldn't sit in a little box with a line of people forgive me I yeah just go open the door you're all forgiven just go but you see the word for the hour opens the door to your confession box and no I'm not on the other side of the little screen amen I know that's a little straight I warned you guys that as I get older I get Bolder but you see it we have a supernatural claim this is this is what God has given for you and I I cannot go no one else could have come to Caleb and said I'm here to possess your daughter's claim the only one who could claim the claim was her she had to be the one that made the claim even her new husband I don't believe he was some a shy guy I don't believe he was whatever but the truth of it was is the inheritance came through Caleb came through his daughter it was not someone else claim climing it for her she had to claim it that's why oh God help us that we would be able to live this gospel and present this gospel that our children would grow up realizing here's the land here's the word and I can claim it I don't need to have a high priest that would be a natural man I don't need to have this I can claim this and then I can step into the land that's been given to me and I can live on that land anointed by the Holy Spirit Washed by the Water of the word nurtured by drinking of the fountain have any of you ever received a half-hearted thank you I don't think any of us could ever say you know it just happens do you know where they got the term Indian giver or as a politically Cor correct would say today indigenous Giver did God ever give any of you ever a promise then take it away from you so you have a Promised Land we've got no excuse to not claim that land amen no matter how hard the trial is no matter what we have to do it's been given to us let's claim the land amen if you don't really feel like you have faith just keep walking the faith will come as you move forward amen hallelujah now let's look at this we recognize my brother and sister that we need to have water in our spirit we need to have uh a nurturing as it is and we can look in the natural and see that to make land live uh you you have to have water amen we we live in what was called the high desert right this area it grew pretty good Sage Brush but somebody realized that if this land had water this land would be fertile and it would grow and that's why in the spirit I hope you're following me I'm not going to take the time to break it all down in the steps tonight we're Believers amen but when you come and recognize that when we've come to a place that we're droughty let's just be honest has anyone ever been droughty amen that's when we kind of start to protect ourselves we curl up our leaves really don't want to fellowship with anyone I don't want to sing I don't want to this I just curl my leaves up amen sister Kristen you would understand like the desert and the cactus right you know I I've been privileged to see the the the beauty of the desert uh just north of flag uh I mean uh Phoenix there going up to Flagstaff in that super rainy season and it's like I've never seen this before cuz every Cactus has blooms all over and it's just beautiful well what's a cactus normally look like droughty get too close to me brother but that's not what God called us to be the water of the word watering Our Lives softening us and we just keep soaking it in and soaking it in and soaking it in I I forget what they say now uh I read this here recently how much water uh sagora Cactus can hold in the wet season it's tremendous I mean it just they just pull water in and pull it to every fiber of them so much if you're lost in the desert you can cut one of them open and get water out of it to survive had people die of dehydration laying right next to a cactus amen which oh let me put this they died laying right next to the very lifegiving water because they didn't see it as lifegiving water oh Lord help us it's all part of possessing our land Saints amen so we need this amen we need the water to make the land live so if God gave us a Promised Land my brother and sister he promised us water to go with the promised land because he didn't give us the land for us to go there and die in in the land right amen the letter of the law my brother and sister kth but the spirit which if you don't mind me I'll typeed to the water the spirit giveth life but the letter of the law kth and so it's there that God if he give us the land did he give us a land Saints amen if he gave us a land he gave us water to make that land live amen not to be a detriment I oh I just you know if my family hadn't gotten the message I wouldn't find myself condemned no you'd find yourself condemned you would find yourself with these problems but here's the life here's the land go into the land step into the land and say God you gave me this land This Is My Land I'm going to live in this land I'm not going to be some you know shrunk up withered old Christian over here but I'm going to flourish in this land I'm going to be amen an overcomer in this land and a delivered in this land and everything that's a promise of the word I will find in this land amen no need to go find another land just need to look and live in the land God's given us amen an upper spring and a lower spring no matter where we are ain't that awesome I know you guys don't have these problems but some days I just feel so so discouraged and beaten down I just wait I just did did that a few days ago anyway um just feel like sitting down and crying not much response maybe a few of you feel like that occasionally but the word said look and live are we looking to Egypt are we looking to the promised land we looking to what we had or what God has already given us you see it's going to just depend on where we look and the Satan Satan's just like a you know the circus I I I told one of the men today I said the only thing missing from this program this morning is some monkeys in a cage and then I re clarified that cuz I thought thought maybe I am the monkey in the cage but you see my brother and sister it's all in what we're possessing possess a bad attitude nothing's right I know that you guys don't do that but it might be people like you that sometimes get a bad attitude you know like you wake up on the wrong side of the bed and especially if your bed's pushed against the wall it's rough when you wake up and but look we're human and we'll carry the bad attitude come on preach with me Saints we'll carry the bad attitude just as long as we feel Justified we can make it from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. carrying that but you ever take oh are you with me you ever take a drink from the spring and you'll find yourself turning back and going and and say forgive me I'm sorry you were still wrong but anyway I don't want to have a bad attitude Hallelujah I know you guys don't do that kind of stuff Paul does that's why sister Jerry is probably considered a saint but anyway but back to the thought we'll carry that just as long as we choose to carry it but if you ever stop and start drinking it might be scripture it might be a quote it might be a tape but you start drinking that Spirit can't stay there we have the perfect remedy my brother and sister Satan tried to poison the land we put the water of the word on the land and it becomes fertile again in a heartbeat Hallelujah no matter where we are up the mountain down the mountain or whatever there's a spring of Living Water amen Amen on our Mountain we need living water in our Valley we need Living Water now I want to just uh uh I'm not saying this will go real quick here as it were because it's quite a big quote I hope you don't mind amen but we know one thing my brother and sister there is always a fountain open in the House of David now like the little Welshman here in broken sisters like the little Welshman said or one time when they had the Welsh revival going on there were some dignitaries from the states some of these great doctors of divinity went over to Wales to find out where and what all this was about so they had on their turned around callers that's about how I feel about ties but anyway they had their turned around collars and their pug hats and they was walking down the street here come a little cop uh uh along whirling his little old billy club in his hand and whistling down at the cross where my savior died down there for cleansing from sin I cried there to my heart was the blood applied Glory to his name walking down the street and they said this seems to be a religious man we'll go ask him and they said mister and he said yes sir amen he said uh we're here from the United States and we're a delegation and we come over here to investigate the Welsh Revival uh soall and we are doctors of divinity and we're here to look it over he said we want to know where the Revival is and where it's held and he said sir you have arrived I want to ask you tonight have we arrived amen by God's grace amen we don't got to go look ain't got to go look for no Revival we are the Revival amen I am the Welsh Revival amen the Welsh Revival is in me and here is where it's at that's the way it is when you live by that Fountain of Living Waters amen amen I'm telling you this this all this thought just came together so lovely I I just love this quote it just you know leaped out in my studies to me that's what it is this is how I am when I start curling up and start getting prickly somebody say amen amen is when I haven't been drinking from the fountain yeah but when I drink from the fountain I can't help it praise God oh you know the story brother Brown told about the lady looking out the windows and one day she cleans her own window oh praise God the neighbor lady cleaned her Windows yeah when we use that Fountain everything looks better everything is better amen drink drink again when you live by that Fountain of Living Waters it's living all the time bubbling over and over and over and over and over and there is no end to it not go see if some water if we had rain here not long ago that's not it it's that Fountain of Living Water as I say it gives its water free you don't have to put Rags on it to find out some educational rag for you can send him out to preach and see if he spells his words right you know I'd flunk this I I would seriously flunk this you know I look at this and I'm thinking thank you Lord because I would never be able to make it through their school if he spells his words right speaks them right if he uses his nouns and pronouns and so forth and adjectives many of them I just want want to make a comment I just wanton to many of them don't even know what they are but he's living at the fountain just the same see the same it don't have to depend on local rain to fill it up or local Revival for it it don't have to do that for its power and its Purity is within itself amen yes sir Hallelujah I can scrub this out outside man and I can tell this outside man you will not this and you will not that but that will not change the inside man but when the Inside Man drinks from The Fountain and he changes pretty soon we start seeing that outside man becomes a different man altogether I thank the Lord for that Hallelujah his power to purify that might make a good sermon title amen for its power and its Purity is within itself why it's Christ in you and that's where the the word is its own power and when a man can receive it in his heart it's got its Purity it's got its power it's right in the word itself and it Springs forth the life I think Caleb's daughter had a revelation this land is of no value if there's no water I have to have the water and I say tonight this word this message we love so much without the spirit of God watering us moving in US it won't produce anything and I think God designed it that way because there are those that say there was I went I was in a message church for 20 years there's nothing there maybe they never made it to the Fountain but to those that have made it to the Fountain and they flourish yeah and life is abundant and they produce fruit you realize it takes water to produce fruit yeah now it's interesting just one last thing musicians if you please come one last thing remember when we were where were we the old olive trees on the mountain up there um Garden yeah they were talking about how old how old they are I don't want to be a weakend Christian I don't want to be a five-year Christian I don't want to be a 10-year Christian I don't want to be name the years I want to be a a Christian period not for a period of time to wake up one day and say I run out of water I can't produce fruit I'm done no we're living by the fountain in fact the very Fountain is producing everything that we are the very spirit of God I hope that this made sense tonight just a little thought that's just been walking and talking and driving around with me I just felt tonight might be a good night to express it you see my brother and sister let's not stop let's not plant Our Roots if there's no Fountain let's let's find the fountain let's live where that River a Fountain of Living Waters producing a river coming from the Throne of God and we can dwell in that we can dwell in that presence we'll find that that will do a lot to take away the isms and sisms and the struggles and the things of Life that'll take a lot you know years ago little situation somebody asked me brother Paul do you believe Believers m message Believers should go to marriage counseling and I was like absolutely they were a little [Music] surprised it's actually quite inexpensive but it requires absolute commitment whatever we have need of the fountain will provide and we'll flourish we'll grow we'll be strengthened and we'll have revelation can we say Amen tonight hallelujah thank you for being patient amen sometimes sometimes I think you know brother Paula I don't call myself brother I guess but you know sometimes Paula I don't even understand you so I'm not sure anybody else can either but by God's grace maybe let's just stand and sing the song There is a fountain open in the House of David let's just worship ship the Lord for just a minute amen aren't you glad there's a fountain open and we come and there's streams of Grace flowing from it and we can receive this and I say we are some of the most blessed people on the face of the Earth there is a fountain open open in the house of d it to you who would Lord I want to be counted a Believer and there are streams of grece that's flowing down from calary come now and re see I will take you from the nation and bring you to your own land I'll be Sanctified in

a day what a day that will be a fountain shall be open and ye shall be holy cing can we say thank you Lord there is a fountain open in the House of David to you who would believe and there are streams of grece that flowing down from calary come now and receive amen ain't that beautiful we get to come to that Fountain there's no fence there's no gate there's no price just to receive everything that God has given to us amen Hallelujah Heavenly Father thankful Lord to be able to come and the patience of your people Lord to just give us the time and attention Lord to pour a little burden from our heart little expression Lord that truly we could use this as a road map father when we find ourselves a little prickly we need to go drink Lord we find ourselves Lord not producing any fruit doesn't mean we're not saved Lord doesn't mean that you're not there with us but father sometimes we just need to come to the Fountain just keep drinking just keep drinking Lord until as a prophet of God taught us we drink and it pushes out we drink and it pushes out Lord help us to look at our own life to see ourselves to know ourselves recognize Lord whether we're pushing out or not just help us father Lord we're not unbelievers we're not Sinners we're not backslid but sometimes father we simply don't drink enough Lord I ask you to put a thirst in the heart of the Saints of Grace Tabernacle and an unction father to come and drink from the fountain Lord to be satisfied as Sons and Daughters of God to be blessed to be a part of your economy father ask blessings upon each and everyone father in the name of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah there's a River of Life flowing out from me as we just sing this as we're dismissed tonight aren't you glad the river is not just pouring in and not doing amen it's filled us up it's flowing right out of us again Hallelujah there's a River of Life flowing out from makes the lame to walk and the blind to see opens prison doors SES a cap is free
