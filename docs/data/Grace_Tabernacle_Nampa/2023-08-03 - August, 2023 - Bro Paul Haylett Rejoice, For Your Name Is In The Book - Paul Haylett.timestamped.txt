[32:16] David

[32:37] my joy refilled amen God bless you

[32:55] look in the scripture you know and and
[32:57] we realize there is a chosen generation
[33:00] as it speaks uh my brother and sister
[33:04] but I want to take that and put it to
[33:06] you in this context there was a promised
[33:08] generation that God said I will fulfill
[33:11] the last or the final acts of my word
[33:15] and it will be in that generation that
[33:17] I've chosen to go ahead and open up the
[33:21] whole sure amen so it's there that we
[33:24] come and I want to take as a little
[33:26] subtitle or whatever their Rejoice for
[33:29] your name is in the book amen let's turn
[33:32] in the Book of Romans the fourth chapter
[33:34] uh just uh a couple of different
[33:37] passages of scripture out of Romans
[33:39] tonight amen Romans the fourth chapter
[33:42] verses one through nine amen
[33:46] just to give you a little heads up while
[33:48] you're turning our
[33:51] our uh go brain dead pole yes um are
[33:56] brother from Florida
[33:59] my brother Stan price
[34:02] um our brother Stan price
[34:04] um and his wife will be arriving this
[34:06] next Tuesday and
[34:09] um
[34:09] uh we look forward they're going to have
[34:12] a little time here in the west uh
[34:15] traveling around just a little bit and
[34:17] so I just pray that they would have a
[34:20] lovely time a little time of rest even
[34:22] though they will be speaking uh a few
[34:25] different places and uh are also
[34:28] arriving uh this coming Tuesday night
[34:31] will be our brother Vitale and his
[34:34] family from Lithuania just asked that
[34:37] you would lift them up in prayer also
[34:39] Romans the fourth chapter
[34:42] what shall we say then that Abraham our
[34:44] father as pertaining to the flesh have
[34:47] found
[34:48] for If Abraham were justified by works
[34:52] he hath whereof to Glory
[34:54] but not before God that's where all of
[34:58] our works comes down we can glory in
[35:01] that but not before God for what saith
[35:04] the scripture Abraham believed God and
[35:07] it was counted unto him for
[35:09] righteousness now to him that worketh is
[35:12] the reward not reckoned of Grace but of
[35:15] debt but to him that worketh not but
[35:18] believeth on him that justifieth the
[35:20] ungodly his faith is counted for
[35:23] righteousness even as David also
[35:26] describeth the blessedness of the man
[35:29] and to whom God imputeth righteousness
[35:32] without works saying blessed are they
[35:35] whose iniquities are forgiven whose sins
[35:38] are covered blessed is the man in whom
[35:41] the Lord will not impute sin cometh this
[35:45] blessedness then upon the circumcision
[35:47] only or upon the uncircumcision also for
[35:52] we say that Faith was reckoned to
[35:54] Abraham
[35:56] for righteousness Heavenly Father we ask
[35:59] for your blessings on the service
[36:00] tonight in your precious name amen you
[36:03] may be seated
[36:07] we wouldn't mind just lifting a little
[36:09] prayer I
[36:11] had to
[36:12] go out and find out
[36:15] why some water wasn't traveling where it
[36:18] was supposed to in the middle of a corn
[36:20] field and I've been all stuffed up and
[36:22] kind of choked up since then uh just a
[36:25] simple case of allergies but it has
[36:27] definitely uh been
[36:30] tough on me amen
[36:33] as we look at this I want to just bring
[36:36] out a couple points here before we move
[36:37] on we look at this my brother and sister
[36:40] and if we're not careful
[36:42] we will approach God like it is a death
[36:45] that we must pay now let's look real
[36:48] careful at this that we realize that we
[36:51] as a song says had a debt we could not
[36:53] pay but God wants us to accept this gift
[36:57] from him and not feel like we're a
[37:00] debtor you know my brother and sister in
[37:02] the natural sometimes if someone gives
[37:04] us a nice gift we kind of feel like we
[37:07] really owe them a nice gift in return
[37:10] but truly a gift my brother and sister
[37:13] is something that is given freely from
[37:16] the heart with nothing in expectation
[37:18] for return and so sometimes we just need
[37:22] to stop and say you know what I receive
[37:25] this gift as a gift unworthy to receive
[37:29] it and not you know any explanation
[37:31] behind it other than someone loved you
[37:34] enough to give you a gift and I say
[37:36] thank you Lord because we don't want to
[37:38] come to the place here that we are
[37:41] serving God trying to pay off a debt
[37:43] amen and so it's there that we just want
[37:46] to trust God but you see my brother and
[37:49] sister if we are going to work off the
[37:51] debt we're going to need to live a whole
[37:53] lot longer amen like you would have to
[37:56] live for eternity just to work the dead
[37:59] off so it's not something that we in our
[38:02] flesh can do but by the grace of God a
[38:06] free will gift that God said I am going
[38:09] to give to you and in this gift is going
[38:13] to be everything you need to fulfill
[38:16] what I desire of you amen now we can
[38:19] look at this and say well the
[38:21] Christian's going to do this this and
[38:22] this but remember God wrote this on the
[38:24] fleshly table of the heart with not an
[38:27] expectation of you checking the Box off
[38:30] but an expectation of what was written
[38:32] on your heart affecting you so strongly
[38:35] that you have a heart's desire to
[38:39] fulfill the word of God for we know that
[38:41] as it is in the the Old Testament that
[38:43] works will not satisfy the law amen
[38:47] because we are unable but when one from
[38:50] his heart is able to come and Free Will
[38:52] and my brother and sister we never want
[38:54] to be grudging I remember a little thing
[38:57] from my childhood about how that uh you
[39:01] know I had been given a gift at one time
[39:03] uh by a cousin and then when the
[39:06] birthday party or evening was over he
[39:09] took the gift home with him and so you
[39:12] know it was uh is a little awkward right
[39:14] because I liked the gift I thought it
[39:17] was my gift but he he just later
[39:20] explained to his parents no I only gave
[39:22] it to him to play with for a little
[39:24] while and so my brother and sister if we
[39:27] was to apply such human principles we
[39:30] would think that God had only given us
[39:32] this measure of Grace and a measure of
[39:34] faith for just a little while but God
[39:38] has given it to us for as long as we
[39:40] will need it amen and so we are there my
[39:44] brother and sister just turning to
[39:45] Romans the 9th chapter verses one
[39:48] through eight just kind of to carry this
[39:51] thought along uh it says if I say the
[39:54] truth in Christ I lie not my conscience
[39:57] also bearing me witness in the Holy
[39:59] Ghost put himself to a very high
[40:02] standard of accountability that I have
[40:05] great heaviness and continual sorrow in
[40:08] my heart for I could wish that myself
[40:11] were accursed from Christ for my
[40:13] brethren my Kinsmen according to the
[40:16] flesh who are Israelites to whom
[40:18] pertaineth the adoption and the glory
[40:21] and the covenants and the giving of the
[40:23] law and the service of God and the
[40:26] promises who are the fathers and of whom
[40:29] concerning the flesh Christ came who is
[40:32] overall God blessed forever amen not as
[40:37] though the word of God hath taken none
[40:40] effect for they are not all is Israel
[40:42] which are of Israel neither because they
[40:46] are the Seed of Abraham are they all
[40:49] children but in Isaac shall thy seed be
[40:54] called
[40:55] that is
[40:57] here is the explanation that is they
[41:00] which are the children of the flesh
[41:02] these are not the children of God but
[41:06] the children of the promise are counted
[41:09] for the seed amen I say God bless the
[41:12] word amen as we look at this and we
[41:15] realize that this Covenant that was
[41:17] given now people say I don't kind of
[41:20] understand how the switch come from
[41:23] being the Seed of Abraham to Sons and
[41:25] Daughters of God and this is why we are
[41:27] speaking on this tonight because you see
[41:30] my brother and sister very clearly is it
[41:33] uh articulated here in Romans
[41:36] specifically this eighth verse that the
[41:39] children of the flesh or the children of
[41:42] the flesh but my brother and sister when
[41:44] you are a child of the promise when God
[41:47] makes a promise God keeps a promise amen
[41:50] and I say thank you for that tonight now
[41:54] as we look we'll see here in these verse
[41:57] verses that he's declaring to the Romans
[42:00] that with great heaviness and sorrow in
[42:02] his heart that he himself if he could
[42:06] would be cursed that they might be able
[42:08] to receive of this promise but you see
[42:11] my brother and sister God's plan is so
[42:13] perfect in detail and his plan is so
[42:16] perfect in continuity that it is there
[42:19] that you cannot bring a substitute now
[42:22] remember the lamb was in a Essence a
[42:26] substitute for a representation that the
[42:30] blood covering this sin but not
[42:32] abolishing or doing away with the sin
[42:34] and so it's there that we realize that
[42:37] God allowed the blood of a lamb turtle
[42:40] dove Etc to cover their sin but God says
[42:44] you know what I'm going to do I'm going
[42:45] to have a people and I'm making a
[42:47] covenant with them that I'm going to
[42:49] come and I'm going to completely as it
[42:51] were annihilate Sin from their life and
[42:54] you say but brother Paul we still make
[42:55] mistakes when someone say Amen to that
[42:58] but you see it's not what we are doing
[43:00] but what God is doing or you might say
[43:03] in a different sense what God hath
[43:05] already done amen I'm telling you my
[43:08] brother and sister if we could recognize
[43:10] the power of the words there in Golgotha
[43:13] and Calvary when he said it is finished
[43:16] amen and that was a final punctuation
[43:20] that leaves nothing else to be added and
[43:24] nothing to be carried on or substituted
[43:26] for so now we are no longer taking the
[43:30] blood of bulls and goats as a substitute
[43:32] to cover sin but our sin has been
[43:35] completely annihilated amen the devil
[43:39] would like to tell us that he still has
[43:41] an account somewhere but my brother and
[43:43] sister his account as you would listen
[43:46] or read the trial you'll see that the
[43:48] devil's account will not hold up in
[43:51] court oh thank you Lord they can bring
[43:54] all that evidence they want and say but
[43:56] they did this just covered can't find it
[43:59] been acquitted been pardoned whatever
[44:02] Satan would like to bring it but my
[44:05] brother and sister God said it's
[44:07] finished it's finished and so we see now
[44:10] in this my brother and sister the
[44:13] children of the flesh
[44:16] you go to Israel today
[44:18] and uh they will give you very stiff
[44:22] there's actually quite a a
[44:25] anti-christian's sentiment rising up
[44:28] there is I just watched a deal the other
[44:31] day we're a group now I'm going to sound
[44:33] judgmental but they didn't really look
[44:36] like Christians in the way we would
[44:38] approach it uh people going to have
[44:42] service and seeing dressed like they had
[44:45] just come you know from the beach or
[44:47] wherever but here are these Orthodox
[44:50] Jews blocking them from entering in to
[44:54] the place where they were going chanting
[44:57] and talking and pushing and shoving and
[44:59] yelling in their faces intimidating and
[45:02] there's a a spirit there that is rising
[45:05] up or pushing back on that but my
[45:08] brother and sister we have to recognize
[45:10] not all that is Israel is Israel amen so
[45:15] they're Anointed with religious Spirits
[45:17] just like uh people in America are
[45:21] anointed with religious Spirits all over
[45:23] the world Amen and I would say as we
[45:26] read this that truly our hearts ache or
[45:29] should ache for the world around us my
[45:32] brother and sister you go and and you
[45:34] can go into a store or uh some place and
[45:38] you'll meet this the most lovely people
[45:40] and yet you see how Satan has put a mark
[45:43] on them already amen and it's there that
[45:46] they're wonderful people truly
[45:49] but it is that my brother and sister
[45:52] they need the true Gospel of Jesus
[45:55] Christ
[45:56] they have the gospel
[46:00] but they need the true gospel in other
[46:03] words they need the book opened
[46:05] and this is why the significance my
[46:07] brother and sister of the open book is
[46:10] so important to us it's not a cliche
[46:12] that we speak from that the book is open
[46:15] but my brother and sister it is a
[46:17] reality that we're living in today that
[46:20] the book must be open and we have many
[46:23] people sitting on pews in message
[46:25] churches that the book is still closed
[46:27] and we should not look down on them we
[46:30] should be praying for them Lord open our
[46:33] eyes and our ears and our hearts because
[46:36] my brother and sister we never gave
[46:39] ourself the gift of revelation we never
[46:41] gave ourselves an opening to the view of
[46:44] the word of God Amen but it's God alone
[46:46] doing the work and we should do all we
[46:49] can do I don't care you know God's
[46:51] dealing with me has been for quite a
[46:53] while and just softening to this to me
[46:55] that regardless of what position people
[46:58] are in we'll take the prophet for an
[47:00] example you didn't know who his enemies
[47:03] were because he treated people kindly
[47:05] now some people have an idea that
[47:07] brother Branham never ever addressed the
[47:10] the things that were twisted or shifted
[47:13] or what but that's not true my brother
[47:15] and sister he didn't give them a pass
[47:17] and because he's going to love them so
[47:19] much but he worked and dealt and
[47:21] encouraged with respect amen and that's
[47:25] what we should have whether it's a
[47:26] little clerk in a grocery store in a gas
[47:30] station a Quick Mart or whatever we
[47:32] should deal with people in respect amen
[47:35] because you see regardless of what some
[47:38] people would think today you cannot
[47:40] educate the revealed word into someone
[47:43] you cannot my brother and sister explain
[47:47] these things we have dealt with this
[47:49] before my brother and sister you can't
[47:52] explain the opening of the seventh seal
[47:54] but yet it's right there all through
[47:57] this scripture just uh it's it's there
[47:59] it's already been there God didn't have
[48:01] to run back now and add a chapter or add
[48:04] a line or a verse or whatever to give an
[48:07] explanation or what of the opening of
[48:09] the seventh seal but quite clearly it
[48:12] just became God all through the Bible
[48:14] revealed in this hour in the final age
[48:18] right now look my brother and sister we
[48:20] can take this I'll get a little ahead of
[48:22] myself you can take this chosen
[48:24] generation but you know the word chosen
[48:26] and selected is the same definition and
[48:31] so it is there that we are a selected
[48:33] generation sometimes that might change
[48:35] our perspective to realize God chose
[48:38] this last day and we are the selected
[48:41] generation a selected people it is not
[48:45] random it wasn't just because we come
[48:47] out of a certain family line because
[48:49] there's many a Believers the only one in
[48:51] their whole family that is a Believer so
[48:53] it didn't have to be in a Heritage but
[48:56] God said you know what I'm choosing a
[48:58] people and I'm choosing a time and a
[49:01] place for the opening of the word now
[49:03] when God opened the word my brother and
[49:05] sister he didn't come and bring a manual
[49:07] for it
[49:08] no
[49:10] because he'd already published the
[49:11] manual
[49:13] the Manual's already been published
[49:16] we just had to come to a revelation to
[49:18] understand like the tent Vision my
[49:20] brother and sister is repeated over and
[49:23] over again in the Bible the tent vision
[49:26] is not a 20th century Revelation but God
[49:30] revealing himself in not form and
[49:33] fashion goes all the way back and so
[49:36] when people say well if God is present
[49:39] with us there was a quote sister Jerry
[49:41] sent me today and I was going to include
[49:42] it and I didn't amen but you know what
[49:44] if we're there and we're looking back
[49:47] and we have expectation to see God you
[49:50] will see God all the way through the
[49:53] Bible in continuity amen he didn't come
[49:57] and then shift his Direction amen does
[49:59] that mean that he couldn't come and add
[50:01] something to it yes because that was
[50:04] already in the word veiled so God then
[50:07] unveils it for our generation like my
[50:10] brother and sister for you and I to
[50:12] catch a revelation that this message in
[50:15] this day a is not for another eighth
[50:18] Church age a ninth Church age or a tenth
[50:21] Church age but to wrap it all up and
[50:24] fulfill it in this church age amen which
[50:27] is carrying on out people would say well
[50:30] but time is going but remember it's the
[50:32] scoffers that say nothing's changed well
[50:34] I'll tell you my brother and sister
[50:35] something has changed this bride of
[50:38] Christ coming into maturity is now able
[50:42] to take now follow my little analogy
[50:44] she's able to take the grain of the word
[50:48] and to grind it and it's not a seed life
[50:53] any longer but it's the nourishment that
[50:56] came out of the word into the Bride of
[50:58] this day and so we can say but where
[51:01] where's the seed that will be planted my
[51:03] brother and sister there'll come a day
[51:05] that we don't need to plant as it were
[51:07] that seed any longer now you want to
[51:10] know the life that's in the seed I was
[51:12] going to look the article up so I could
[51:13] document it to you but many years ago
[51:16] some archaeologists there in Egypt
[51:18] happen to in one of those tombs uncover
[51:21] a dish a bowl a whatever you would call
[51:25] it that had wheat seed in it and so they
[51:29] took a certain little portion of that
[51:31] and put it into the perfect environment
[51:34] in a lab to see if the wheat after had
[51:37] to be just a a phenomenal amount of time
[51:40] whether that wheat would grow and it
[51:43] grew but my brother and sister they were
[51:45] shocked they had some idea mental
[51:47] conception that the wheat was some
[51:50] little puny thing because we as men have
[51:53] done such a great job of cross-breeding
[51:56] and bringing forth to have this great
[51:58] wheat that we have now but they planted
[52:00] that wheat and they were shocked at the
[52:03] wheat it produced and I want to tell you
[52:05] why they were shocked because that wheat
[52:08] seed was a lot closer to the original
[52:10] than we are amen and so it wasn't
[52:14] deluded down with man ideas and
[52:17] everything through the age and we ought
[52:19] to cross it with this and we ought to
[52:20] cross it with that and that's why that
[52:22] original word Unearthed are you with me
[52:25] that original word unearth is producing
[52:28] a bride because it is close to the
[52:31] original amen it hasn't been hybrid by
[52:35] man and by religious spirits but it's
[52:37] close to the original and it will bring
[52:39] forth and it's shocking in fact it's so
[52:42] shocking they're not sure they want to
[52:43] accept it the idea that people could
[52:46] come I just listened to a deal the other
[52:48] day and they were actually mocking this
[52:51] certain uh group and they were saying
[52:53] you know their whole little doctrine
[52:54] that they would be as little gods and
[52:57] I'm like do they not read their Bible
[53:00] do they not understand what they read
[53:02] because the word is telling us that we
[53:06] are as Gods little Gods minder as you
[53:09] would my brother and sister but
[53:11] nonetheless we have the very DNA of the
[53:14] king in US amen and that is producing a
[53:18] life to a people that are able to take
[53:21] the grain of the word and take it in and
[53:24] it produces life but we're not taken out
[53:27] and burying it for another generation
[53:29] we're letting it produce a life in you
[53:31] and I and that life has to be ingested
[53:34] to be digested amen you cannot just draw
[53:38] the life out of the grain or the word as
[53:42] it were without ingesting it amen take
[53:45] the book and eat
[53:46] take the book and eat amen hallelujah
[53:50] how important that is take the book and
[53:54] eat amen Hallelujah now as we'll look
[53:58] right here in the seven Church ages this
[54:02] is quite a lengthy quote so bear with me
[54:05] if you would please
[54:06] the possibility
[54:09] of the removal of a name from the
[54:11] records of God deserves more than a
[54:13] casual study for up until now most
[54:16] students have merely drawn a conclusion
[54:18] that God places the names of those Born
[54:21] Again within the Lamb's Book of Life at
[54:24] the time of their rebirth
[54:27] and if for any reason that name must be
[54:29] removed the space on the record will
[54:31] simply be a blank as it was before a
[54:34] name had been placed there this is 100
[54:37] percent opposite to what the word
[54:40] actually teaches at the very start of
[54:42] our study let it be known that there is
[54:45] not one scripture that teaches that God
[54:48] is presently compiling a record of names
[54:52] my you know sometimes we just kind of
[54:55] fall into what we've been taught and oh
[54:57] they got saved somebody's wrote their
[55:00] name in the book my brother and sister
[55:01] it was in the book amen I'm glad the
[55:05] names are in the book amen because the
[55:07] devil sure wants to get it out amen and
[55:11] the devil would sure like the PIN to run
[55:13] out of ink the pencil led to break or
[55:16] whatever it might be to keep a name from
[55:18] being there but there's nothing can you
[55:20] hear me there's nothing the devil can do
[55:24] about your name in the book
[55:28] hmm
[55:30] now it seems contradictory when we go on
[55:32] here but my brother and sister are son
[55:33] or daughter of God has a desire to serve
[55:36] God there's not one thing the devil can
[55:39] do
[55:40] at the very start of our study let it be
[55:42] no there's not one scripture that
[55:45] teaches that God is presently compiling
[55:46] a record of names
[55:48] this was all done before the foundation
[55:50] of the world as we will point out
[55:52] shortly
[55:53] also is not a question of Simply
[55:55] involving ourselves with two groups of
[55:57] people both of whom had opportunity to
[56:00] receive eternal life wherein one group
[56:02] received it and had their names placed
[56:05] on record while the others who refused
[56:08] did not have their names uh so placed we
[56:11] will actually show how by so by
[56:14] scripture that multitudes this don't let
[56:17] this one throw you some of you are
[56:18] reading ahead here you know that just I
[56:21] just I just can't spring it on you if
[56:23] you've already read it amen
[56:27] but look at this
[56:29] look at this it'll show another
[56:32] group
[56:33] there's a group of people whose names
[56:35] have been placed on that record before
[56:37] the foundation of the world uh
[56:40] cannot under any circumstance have those
[56:43] names removed amen
[56:45] uh oh I I jumped the line excuse me
[56:50] we will actually show by scripture that
[56:52] multitudes were not even born again will
[56:54] go into eternal life as strange as this
[56:57] may sound it is certainly true amen
[57:00] well wouldn't that be just easier not to
[57:04] have to labor and we just
[57:06] as some people have this idea we'll just
[57:09] stand outside a message Church handing
[57:11] out glasses of water
[57:15] you see it's deeper than what some
[57:18] people
[57:19] want to place it out oh I was here at
[57:21] this place and this person did this for
[57:23] me that will be their glass of water
[57:30] I'm not here to judge
[57:32] but I could
[57:34] if it's lawful give your opinion I think
[57:37] it's a little deeper than somebody
[57:38] holding the door for you at Walmart
[57:45] hmm
[57:47] you see
[57:49] God knows what you need when you need it
[57:53] and God will use individuals
[57:57] to fulfill needs in your life
[58:00] and you'll say why did they do that
[58:03] they're not even a Christian
[58:06] they're not even this not even that
[58:09] maybe heaven forbid that they're
[58:12] tattooed up and not dressed properly
[58:14] and yet from their heart they do
[58:18] something for you or your family
[58:23] and God says that is what I'm talking
[58:26] about
[58:30] my brother and sister I won't say that
[58:32] holding the door is not sufficient it's
[58:34] not for me to decide
[58:38] we don't need to go running around
[58:39] putting people in and out
[58:42] we need to just settle down and say Lord
[58:45] let my light shine let it be that Who I
[58:48] Am Lord that that would be there and you
[58:51] know we have seen personally experienced
[58:54] times when people had Unknown People to
[58:57] you had such animosity toward you that
[59:01] it's stunning you're like I don't even
[59:04] know these people why
[59:05] see there's that spiritual warfare going
[59:09] on and when someone would say you know
[59:11] what I'm going to side with this person
[59:13] God's saying you're an ally
[59:16] and then you've got these people that
[59:18] just hate you without even knowing you
[59:20] and they're identifying themselves and
[59:23] we have to recognize my brother and
[59:25] sister God's the only one that has it
[59:28] all in control amen the rest of us well
[59:32] sometimes we'll still be figuring it out
[59:34] right brother Branham said God doesn't
[59:36] reveal Everything To His prophets so
[59:39] even the prophet dealt with some of
[59:41] these experiences my brother and sister
[59:43] without fully understanding what was
[59:45] happening you say do you have proof of
[59:48] that no only taking his own words
[59:51] only proof I have is his own words
[59:54] so you see the spirit Warfare going on
[59:57] Amen so these
[1:00:00] not even born again will go into eternal
[1:00:03] life
[1:00:04] and we will also show that there is a
[1:00:06] group of people whose names having been
[1:00:08] placed on that record before the
[1:00:10] foundation of the world cannot under any
[1:00:13] circumstance have those names removed
[1:00:16] Can someone say thank you Lord amen
[1:00:19] chosen of God Amen a generation a chosen
[1:00:22] people that no matter how many times we
[1:00:25] might stumble and what the struggles of
[1:00:28] our life will be God says I wrote your
[1:00:30] name in that book and you will not be
[1:00:33] removed because you are my elect lady
[1:00:36] you are my bride and I have chosen you
[1:00:39] and we would look here and say Lord I
[1:00:41] failed you so many times How Could You
[1:00:44] Love Me Lord how could you forgive me
[1:00:46] Lord how could it be and God says it's
[1:00:49] finished
[1:00:51] hmm
[1:00:52] I say thank you Lord
[1:00:54] amen
[1:00:56] because otherwise the devil would be
[1:00:58] right there with a whole box full of
[1:00:59] erasers saying here I got a new racer I
[1:01:01] got a new racer I'll loan you an eraser
[1:01:04] but God says I'm not erasing their name
[1:01:06] they're my bride I chose them I've got
[1:01:08] them written in the book and I wrote
[1:01:10] them in my own blood so it's not
[1:01:14] something that is going to be erased hmm
[1:01:18] well look at this my brother and sister
[1:01:24] but we'll also show that another group
[1:01:27] whose names were on that record before
[1:01:29] the foundation of the world will have
[1:01:31] their names removed
[1:01:33] wait now we're in a limbo one side here
[1:01:35] there's names on the record that
[1:01:37] absolute can't be removed at all and
[1:01:39] there's names over here that can be
[1:01:44] now we all live in a world of free moral
[1:01:47] agency
[1:01:48] we decide to come to church or not I
[1:01:51] don't know did anybody come around your
[1:01:53] house with a school bus tonight and
[1:01:55] force you to get on and come to church
[1:01:58] did any of you receive any threatening
[1:02:00] calls if you're not in church tonight
[1:02:02] no desert at the next Fellowship
[1:02:05] no free moral agency
[1:02:09] and God
[1:02:10] recognizes that there'll be those that
[1:02:13] come to a crossroad
[1:02:18] and they have to make a decision
[1:02:22] they come to that place
[1:02:27] you say brother Paul what do you have to
[1:02:28] back it up what does the prophet have to
[1:02:30] back it up
[1:02:32] Rich Young Ruler
[1:02:36] Judas
[1:02:38] although Judas was already as this
[1:02:41] scripture says kind of uh to already
[1:02:44] directed going to his own
[1:02:48] but we'll see that he come down there he
[1:02:49] had a true Holy Ghost Ministry it wasn't
[1:02:53] fraudulent it was real people were
[1:02:55] delivered under that imagine this shock
[1:02:58] my brother and sister when those that
[1:03:01] Judas had prayed for when they saw him
[1:03:04] fall
[1:03:05] they said we saw the power of God the
[1:03:09] prayers delivered demons from us were
[1:03:11] cast out we heard the word open and it
[1:03:14] was real and it was effective what
[1:03:17] happened
[1:03:18] but look at the Rich Young Ruler
[1:03:21] stands right there not as it were let me
[1:03:24] use I don't know what word to use here
[1:03:26] but not to a servant right not to one of
[1:03:29] the Apostles or one of the disciples but
[1:03:31] here's a Rich Young Ruler talking to
[1:03:34] Jesus himself and basically explaining
[1:03:37] to him that I would follow you but
[1:03:41] oh Lord help us to eliminate the butts
[1:03:44] out of our I was too tired I worked too
[1:03:47] hard on Wednesdays and I'm too tired to
[1:03:49] come to church now that might sound
[1:03:51] pointed but I want it to be pointed
[1:03:53] because it's decisions my brother and
[1:03:55] sister it's decisions that we make and
[1:03:59] little seeds grow into big plants amen
[1:04:01] and it's there that as it is I'm telling
[1:04:04] you I get to witness all of these kind
[1:04:06] of things manifested week after week
[1:04:08] been walking through corn fields just
[1:04:11] looking at pollination and maturities
[1:04:13] and my brother and sister you'll see
[1:04:15] that and they're spots that this corn is
[1:04:18] thin
[1:04:19] and the sunlight has penetrated all the
[1:04:22] way to the earth and the weeds are five
[1:04:25] and six feet tall
[1:04:27] but you go over just a couple steps
[1:04:30] where the corn is thick and there's a
[1:04:32] plant everywhere there should be a plant
[1:04:34] and the weeds that did Germany are these
[1:04:37] little sickly things because they're not
[1:04:39] in the light
[1:04:40] amen and so you see how this is coming
[1:04:43] that day is an opportunity for people
[1:04:47] and some are going to have their names
[1:04:50] removed brother Branham says right to
[1:04:52] begin with there is no basis for the
[1:04:54] claims that the Lamb's Book of Life is
[1:04:56] not the same as the Book of Life The
[1:04:58] Book of Life might be called the Lamb's
[1:05:00] Book of Life or Christ's Book of Life or
[1:05:03] even thy book and book of the living
[1:05:05] only names are written in it amen my
[1:05:09] brother and sister he says right here
[1:05:11] Revelation 13 8 and all dwell upon the
[1:05:15] Earth shall worship Him the Beast whose
[1:05:18] names are not written in the Book of
[1:05:19] Life of the lamb slain from the
[1:05:22] foundation of the world so you look
[1:05:24] there and realize that people will think
[1:05:26] well maybe I can just I could just be a
[1:05:28] good person my brother and sister those
[1:05:31] people whose names are not in that book
[1:05:33] are going to be deceived
[1:05:35] it's that simple amen now how they get
[1:05:39] to that place is subject to another
[1:05:42] sermon and and whatever but you come to
[1:05:44] that place my brother and sister we
[1:05:46] better be saying Thank You Lord that our
[1:05:48] name is written in the book Amen to
[1:05:51] Rejoice that our name is written in the
[1:05:54] book
[1:05:54] uh Revelation 17 8. the Beast that thou
[1:05:58] Sauced was and is not and shall Ascend
[1:06:01] out of the bottomless pit and go into
[1:06:03] Perdition and they that dwell on the
[1:06:05] Earth shall wonder whose names were not
[1:06:07] written in the Book of Life from the
[1:06:09] foundation of the world when they behold
[1:06:12] the Beast that was and is not and yet is
[1:06:15] now look at this my brother and sister
[1:06:17] why is the bride not going to be
[1:06:19] deceived what did the prophet of God say
[1:06:21] because she is the word amen that will
[1:06:26] be the only thing that keeps you and I
[1:06:28] from being deceived is that we are the
[1:06:31] word and we have been documented amen
[1:06:34] nothing like being documented have you
[1:06:37] ever been to an occasion where literally
[1:06:39] there at the door and you don't get into
[1:06:42] this event unless your name is on that
[1:06:45] list amen and you walk up there and is
[1:06:48] able to say uh this is Mr and Mrs Paul
[1:06:51] heylet and they go down the list and
[1:06:54] it's there yes you are and they tell you
[1:06:56] now this gentleman right here will seat
[1:06:59] you and then you go and you have your
[1:07:02] place to be seated and someone else a
[1:07:04] misunderstanding they have the
[1:07:06] invitation in their hand but their
[1:07:09] name's not in the book
[1:07:11] that's right
[1:07:14] John 3 16 we want to quote it we want to
[1:07:17] stand on it we want to hold on that oh
[1:07:18] John 3 16 John 3 16 but my brother and
[1:07:21] sister you don't get in unless your
[1:07:23] name's in the book
[1:07:25] amen they might say well we don't know
[1:07:27] about that part over there we don't take
[1:07:30] care of that but what we do know is you
[1:07:33] don't get in here without your name in
[1:07:37] this book amen that happens in the
[1:07:40] natural
[1:07:41] amen so you look at how God is working
[1:07:43] and he's bringing this in the natural
[1:07:46] and spiritual coming together amen
[1:07:49] Revelations 20 12-15 and I saw the dead
[1:07:53] small and great stand before God and the
[1:07:56] books were open and another book was
[1:07:58] open
[1:07:59] isn't that something there's a record
[1:08:02] here my brother and sister that's not a
[1:08:04] common everyday record it's not just
[1:08:06] laying around kind of record but it's
[1:08:08] the other book amen that'd make a good
[1:08:10] sermon title Brother David brother Chris
[1:08:12] the other book amen you might have your
[1:08:14] name in a book my brother and sister but
[1:08:17] we want our name in the other book amen
[1:08:19] that book of life that is there to
[1:08:22] record this and another book amen which
[1:08:25] one is the Book of Life and the dead
[1:08:27] were judged out of those things which
[1:08:29] were written in the books according to
[1:08:32] their works now I'm just going to step
[1:08:34] out here just a little bit my brother
[1:08:36] and sister some of these books that
[1:08:38] they're talking about in scripture is
[1:08:40] literally the written history of our
[1:08:42] life
[1:08:43] it is a very book that has recorded
[1:08:45] every deed word and thought and I say
[1:08:47] Lord forgive us
[1:08:49] because sometimes we have Angry thoughts
[1:08:51] and sometimes our Deeds are not the best
[1:08:54] of deeds and it's there but that's all
[1:08:56] done but I'm telling you my brother and
[1:08:58] sister that words
[1:09:01] it is finished
[1:09:03] took the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:09:06] blanked the pages of the book of your
[1:09:09] life of my life I I say thank you Lord
[1:09:12] amen because my my book would look like
[1:09:15] one that would not be even a candidate
[1:09:18] for salvation
[1:09:21] but when you open that book
[1:09:24] and there's no record
[1:09:26] of thoughts words and deeds
[1:09:30] but there is a name written
[1:09:33] in another book
[1:09:36] and I say thank you Lord Jesus how that
[1:09:39] is my brother and sister are the very
[1:09:40] foundational
[1:09:42] fundamentals of being a Christian
[1:09:46] let's not get away from the foundation
[1:09:48] and the fundamentals
[1:09:50] we can talk about doctrines and
[1:09:52] Revelations and openings and thunderings
[1:09:54] and vials and all this stuff and if our
[1:09:57] name is not in that book
[1:09:59] it won't do us a bit of good
[1:10:03] you say well isn't that fixed brother
[1:10:05] Paul
[1:10:07] well
[1:10:08] depends on where you're coming from
[1:10:12] because I'll take the point of view
[1:10:14] that it's fixed
[1:10:16] I don't believe you and I are in a
[1:10:19] position to have our name
[1:10:21] taken from the book it's not who God
[1:10:23] called us to be
[1:10:27] Judas had become a disgruntled Christian
[1:10:31] Judah said come to the point that he
[1:10:34] thought Jude Jesus should run his
[1:10:36] ministry Judas way
[1:10:41] shouldn't the church run like this
[1:10:43] shouldn't this happen shouldn't that
[1:10:44] happen or shouldn't the word be spoken
[1:10:46] like this and judas's point of view was
[1:10:49] shouldn't we just rise up and Conquer
[1:10:51] these people
[1:10:55] but that wasn't God's way because God
[1:10:57] said I've already conquered him
[1:10:59] they're already conquered but Judas
[1:11:02] didn't have that Vision to see the plan
[1:11:06] of God
[1:11:07] many in that day study the history many
[1:11:09] in that day thought that there was going
[1:11:11] to be a great Army rise up and expel
[1:11:14] them from their country from their land
[1:11:16] but never happened
[1:11:21] why because God said you know what I
[1:11:24] promise this land to you but you will
[1:11:26] not stand you won't hold to the word you
[1:11:30] compromise again and again and again and
[1:11:34] the Very spirit that took them to Katie
[1:11:36] sparnia Was the Same Spirit that took
[1:11:38] them to bail pior which took them Beyond
[1:11:41] again and again told them don't marry of
[1:11:43] the people of the land they went and
[1:11:45] married them
[1:11:46] everything became a compromise they
[1:11:49] could not stand firm and you know in the
[1:11:51] day that we live in I hope I don't sound
[1:11:53] too strident tonight but the day that we
[1:11:55] live in my brother and sister we're
[1:11:57] facing the greatest day of compromise
[1:12:00] that has ever come to the Gospel of
[1:12:03] Jesus Christ and Satan is pressing the
[1:12:06] compromise because there's no other age
[1:12:09] to carry on he knows this is going to be
[1:12:11] the final battle and people say but what
[1:12:14] about Armageddon my brother and sister
[1:12:15] Armageddon has nothing to do with you
[1:12:17] and I
[1:12:19] amen if we're here for Armageddon we've
[1:12:21] missed the bus
[1:12:23] Satan knows he's got to derail our faith
[1:12:27] train before we get to the End Amen and
[1:12:31] he's working hard to do that
[1:12:34] so these books right they were judged
[1:12:37] out of what was written in the books
[1:12:39] according to their works and we already
[1:12:41] touched in Romans 4 of The Works
[1:12:44] we realize if we're doing it by works
[1:12:46] we're in debt
[1:12:48] so really what this book is
[1:12:51] if I could just simplify it to you
[1:12:52] tonight
[1:12:54] this book was the debtors book
[1:13:01] anybody wants your name in the debtors
[1:13:03] book
[1:13:04] I don't
[1:13:07] my sins have been paid for
[1:13:10] the blood has covered every last one of
[1:13:12] them I don't need my name to be recorded
[1:13:15] in a debtors book
[1:13:19] aren't you glad to
[1:13:22] you think about this
[1:13:23] my children should be especially happy
[1:13:27] that we're no longer
[1:13:29] held to pay the debts of our fathers
[1:13:36] do you realize the significance of that
[1:13:40] because if we were obligated to pay the
[1:13:43] debts of our fathers
[1:13:45] we can go right back to our lineage
[1:13:47] and realize how big that debt would be
[1:13:55] family lines that have drunks and
[1:13:57] womenizers and thieves and liars and
[1:14:00] extortionists
[1:14:02] and we would have to pay that debt
[1:14:04] impossible
[1:14:07] but we don't have to
[1:14:10] hmm
[1:14:12] Hallelujah and this is the second death
[1:14:14] and whosoever is not found written in
[1:14:17] the book of lives is cast into the Lake
[1:14:19] of Fire you can see that though that
[1:14:22] there are other books mentioned there is
[1:14:25] always the reference to one book
[1:14:27] containing names in Revelation it's
[1:14:29] called the Lamb's Book of Life or The
[1:14:31] Book of Life Now where is this book
[1:14:34] located Luke 10 17-24 and the 70
[1:14:38] returned again with Joyce saying Lord
[1:14:41] even the devils are subject unto us
[1:14:45] through
[1:14:46] and I would if I have it I have it right
[1:14:48] here in my notes highlighted amen it is
[1:14:53] there even the devils are subject to us
[1:14:58] through thy name
[1:15:02] amen there is where it's contained
[1:15:05] right there in the name
[1:15:09] the name that the word basically
[1:15:12] prophesied or predicted would come a
[1:15:14] time that it would be used in vain more
[1:15:17] than it's used in Praise
[1:15:21] and as they use it in vain they Heap
[1:15:23] judgment on themselves and you and I
[1:15:25] when we speak in reverence and sincerity
[1:15:28] from our heart the name of Jesus Christ
[1:15:30] it says when we draw nigh to him he
[1:15:32] draws nigh unto us and we can call him
[1:15:35] right down into every situation that we
[1:15:38] face in our life by just calling on the
[1:15:41] name of Jesus Christ amen and so you
[1:15:44] look at this now look they are saying
[1:15:46] Lord even the Devils imagine this is
[1:15:50] almost sorry for just bringing this out
[1:15:52] like this but these are a bunch of guys
[1:15:53] high five in each other and you know
[1:15:56] fist bumping and shoulder bumping you
[1:15:58] know what the devils are even subject to
[1:16:01] us praise God and Jesus turns around and
[1:16:04] says unto them I beheld him
[1:16:09] falling as lightning from the heaven
[1:16:14] oh
[1:16:16] we're just pushing his little Junior
[1:16:17] Partners around here and we think we've
[1:16:19] done something
[1:16:21] and Jesus said I was there
[1:16:23] and saw him fall
[1:16:25] from the heavens
[1:16:27] I wonder my brother and sister did they
[1:16:29] really catch a revelation what he was
[1:16:31] saying to them
[1:16:32] you'd have to wonder
[1:16:34] if they really realized what he was
[1:16:36] speaking to them that he's telling them
[1:16:39] I have saw this from the beginning
[1:16:41] all the way to the end and I saw the day
[1:16:45] would come when you would cast out
[1:16:47] devils and he says I give you the power
[1:16:50] to tread on serpents and scorpions and
[1:16:52] power over the enemy nothing shall be
[1:16:55] any means hurt you not withstanding in
[1:16:58] this Rejoice not now we'll stop right
[1:17:01] there for a moment my brother and sister
[1:17:02] there's not one thing right here in
[1:17:05] these words as the prophet's bringing
[1:17:07] this out that we should not be claiming
[1:17:09] we should be claiming the power to tread
[1:17:12] on serpents and scorpions and over the
[1:17:14] power of the enemy that nothing by any
[1:17:17] means should not be subject or would
[1:17:20] hurt us my brother and sister we should
[1:17:22] claim that we shouldn't shy from that we
[1:17:25] shouldn't back up we should be saying
[1:17:26] this is a promise of the word I claim
[1:17:29] that Lord but I'm not going to boast in
[1:17:32] that I'm not going to comment and say I
[1:17:35] did this and I did that but to come and
[1:17:38] say by the power of almighty God the
[1:17:40] gift that he gave us has given this
[1:17:43] ability ability but then he tells them
[1:17:46] hey you know what what you should do is
[1:17:49] stop for a moment don't rejoice in that
[1:17:52] but amen that the spirits are subject to
[1:17:56] you that's not really our rejoicing my
[1:17:58] brother and sister I've been there
[1:18:00] before sister Jerry's been in the
[1:18:02] audience of these things in South
[1:18:04] America and see God come Supernatural
[1:18:07] homosexual spirits and other things like
[1:18:10] this people caught up in all kinds of
[1:18:12] nonsense see God come and deliver them
[1:18:15] but even in that place right there my
[1:18:18] brother and sister is no place for us to
[1:18:20] boast but our boasting as it were should
[1:18:23] come amen that we are going to Rejoice
[1:18:27] because we can find our name in the book
[1:18:31] amen because I tell you many of those
[1:18:34] people and in this case I can tell you
[1:18:36] some of those that we saw find
[1:18:39] Deliverance went for years delivered and
[1:18:41] at this present moment have fallen back
[1:18:44] into that bondage amen but I'm telling
[1:18:47] you whenever a son or daughter of God
[1:18:49] sees their name in the book they've got
[1:18:52] something to have a good old-fashioned
[1:18:54] jump and sing and shouting kind of a
[1:18:57] Revival in the deal because it is true
[1:19:00] that when we see who we are in Jesus
[1:19:03] Christ we'll never be the same person
[1:19:05] ever again
[1:19:07] Amen in that hour Jesus rejoiced in
[1:19:10] spirit and said I thank thee O Father
[1:19:12] Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou Hast
[1:19:15] hid these things from the wise and
[1:19:18] prudent and has revealed them into babes
[1:19:20] even so father for so it seemed good in
[1:19:24] thy sight now look at this my brother
[1:19:26] and sister
[1:19:28] he doesn't say some things here
[1:19:31] he doesn't put a quantifier on this
[1:19:33] all things are delivered to me of my
[1:19:36] father and no man knoweth who the son is
[1:19:39] but the father and who the father is but
[1:19:42] the son and he to whom the son will
[1:19:44] reveal him and he turned him to his he
[1:19:48] turned him to his disciples and said
[1:19:50] privately
[1:19:51] blessed are the eyes which see the
[1:19:55] things that you see
[1:19:58] for I tell you that many prophets and
[1:20:00] Kings desired to see those things which
[1:20:03] you see and have not seen them and to
[1:20:05] hear those things which you hear and
[1:20:07] have not heard them
[1:20:09] look at this my brother and sister a
[1:20:12] whole age
[1:20:14] chosen selected right
[1:20:17] the selected generation first Peter 2
[1:20:21] 9-10 amen the selected generation
[1:20:26] and given that my brother and sister
[1:20:28] that God said you know what there's
[1:20:29] going to come a final
[1:20:31] age a final time a final bride with a
[1:20:35] message comes all the way down in
[1:20:37] Revelation and says um my spirit
[1:20:42] and my bride are going to have the exact
[1:20:45] same language
[1:20:48] she's going to sound just like her
[1:20:50] husband she's not going to have another
[1:20:52] voice she's not going to have another
[1:20:54] agenda another idea but she's going to
[1:20:57] come and she's going to sound so much
[1:20:59] like him that they're gonna say is this
[1:21:04] now nobody's going to mistake Paul
[1:21:05] heylet for God
[1:21:07] but we saw that manifestation in this
[1:21:09] day my brother and sister before us that
[1:21:11] people saw so much of Christ Teo Osborne
[1:21:14] went on tape in a you know interview
[1:21:16] recorded that they literally thought
[1:21:18] they were looking at Jesus Christ it was
[1:21:21] so much there that impressed them to
[1:21:24] that my brother and sister and we'll say
[1:21:26] well well I'll never attain to that but
[1:21:28] you'll be God to your children
[1:21:30] you'll be God maybe to a neighbor you'll
[1:21:33] be God look our our little neighbor over
[1:21:36] the hill God has come down now I don't
[1:21:39] know what God will do in their family
[1:21:40] what God will do with her and her
[1:21:43] husband but both of her children I'll
[1:21:45] tell you go knock on her door and ask
[1:21:47] her what's happened to her children and
[1:21:49] she'll tell you two times God has come
[1:21:52] right down in their life and has healed
[1:21:55] her children and God is real
[1:21:58] now you might not want what we have
[1:22:04] but I'm not going to take what God has
[1:22:06] given her
[1:22:07] away from her
[1:22:11] she got to see answer
[1:22:15] a baby should be born with Down Syndrome
[1:22:17] the doctor and the last I visited with
[1:22:20] her the doctor still hadn't given up she
[1:22:22] goes back every few months for another
[1:22:24] test because they're just waiting for
[1:22:26] the Down Syndrome to manifest itself
[1:22:29] well why don't they just stop and look
[1:22:31] that God has already manifested himself
[1:22:35] but they're waiting to find something to
[1:22:38] prove this wasn't a miracle of God and a
[1:22:41] little boy caught up with an infection
[1:22:42] that went to his brain stem changed his
[1:22:45] personality made him violent and they
[1:22:47] were saying you'll just have to learn to
[1:22:49] live with this and we'll medicate him
[1:22:51] out of this situation to keep him toned
[1:22:54] down and to see how God would come and
[1:22:57] deliver that little boy now my brother
[1:22:59] and sister they might not come and sit
[1:23:02] in this church and say Amen to the
[1:23:04] message of this hour but they know that
[1:23:06] God Is A Healer and they know God is
[1:23:09] present and they know God has come to
[1:23:11] their house I'll let God deal with them
[1:23:13] amen all we got to do is be who God
[1:23:16] called us to be Amen to live the word at
[1:23:19] the level not just living the word but
[1:23:22] at the level God called us to be now if
[1:23:25] we're the queen of the house
[1:23:27] what level are we called to live at
[1:23:30] amen at the Queen's level
[1:23:33] amen and I I don't even know how to
[1:23:35] describe what the Queen's level is my
[1:23:37] brother and sister but I'll tell you the
[1:23:40] queen is not a beggar the queen is not
[1:23:42] one over here denying the power of the
[1:23:44] king the queen is over here saying my
[1:23:47] husband is in charge of everything
[1:23:51] what he says goes
[1:23:54] let's live at the queen level
[1:23:57] amen let's get away from being the
[1:23:59] beggar let's get away from being the one
[1:24:01] that wonders if God will come on this
[1:24:03] scene and start being the one that
[1:24:05] declares God is on the scene
[1:24:09] Hallelujah
[1:24:10] amen
[1:24:13] Hallelujah
[1:24:15] oh my
[1:24:17] God you see what we're doing sometimes
[1:24:19] is we're waiting
[1:24:21] for some point down the road here that
[1:24:24] this is all going to be manifested
[1:24:27] well I say my brother and sister were
[1:24:28] living the portion of this word for our
[1:24:31] day right here we're living it right now
[1:24:33] this is not a tomorrow message
[1:24:36] this is a today message this is not a
[1:24:39] yesterday message
[1:24:40] now don't misunderstand me
[1:24:42] I love to talk about the things that God
[1:24:45] used did in brother Brown's Ministry
[1:24:48] I love to recount and look at those
[1:24:50] things
[1:24:51] but my brother and sister I'm not living
[1:24:53] in 1963.
[1:24:56] I'm living in 2023.
[1:24:59] and I need a God today amen not tomorrow
[1:25:04] I need God today
[1:25:07] so is he going to be present or not
[1:25:10] do you realize it's all what we choose
[1:25:13] do you realize that we actually put God
[1:25:16] in the past in the present or the future
[1:25:18] ourself we can say my anticipation is
[1:25:22] when this and this happens in my life I
[1:25:24] get right with God my brother and sister
[1:25:26] we are putting God in the future amen if
[1:25:29] all we do is talk about what God did in
[1:25:31] brother branham's life we are putting
[1:25:33] God in the past but I want God to be in
[1:25:37] the present I want God to be here
[1:25:39] tonight that we can take the scriptures
[1:25:42] that we have shared tonight and these
[1:25:44] quotes as we went down through this how
[1:25:46] the church age and recognize that he is
[1:25:48] the ever-present help in our time of
[1:25:52] trouble not in history not in future but
[1:25:56] right here tonight amen that God is here
[1:25:59] to answer and to deal with our hearts
[1:26:02] amen because you see we're a living
[1:26:06] portion of scripture
[1:26:08] we can talk about whether the word is
[1:26:10] living I want to know are we living
[1:26:14] I want to be a living written epistle
[1:26:20] not a dead epistle
[1:26:22] a living epistle
[1:26:24] amen a Living Word to a present world
[1:26:28] you know and taking this out of the
[1:26:30] churches we already read it but he
[1:26:31] turned to his disciples said privately
[1:26:33] blessed are the eyes which have seen the
[1:26:36] things that you see amen you realize how
[1:26:38] blessed We Are Tonight Saints
[1:26:40] for I tell you that many prophets and
[1:26:42] Kings have desired to see those things
[1:26:43] which ye see and have not seen them
[1:26:52] sorry to sound carnal but
[1:26:56] most people would tell you
[1:26:58] wouldn't mind at all to live a little
[1:27:00] nicer house
[1:27:02] and live in a little drive a little
[1:27:04] nicer car
[1:27:06] and a little this and a little of that
[1:27:09] maybe out of zero or two in front of the
[1:27:12] decimal
[1:27:13] to our bank account
[1:27:18] and the Kings who have that money
[1:27:22] are looking at you saying I wished I
[1:27:26] could see
[1:27:28] what you see I wished I could hear
[1:27:32] what you hear
[1:27:35] and let me take it a little further
[1:27:37] maybe even in that day come to the place
[1:27:39] they would declare I wish I could have
[1:27:42] lived
[1:27:44] what you left
[1:27:48] they wouldn't care where the decimal
[1:27:50] point was
[1:27:52] they want what you have
[1:27:56] oh they already have the wealth they
[1:27:58] already have the fame
[1:28:00] they already have all of this
[1:28:02] but they want
[1:28:04] this what you have they desired to see
[1:28:07] that
[1:28:08] amen
[1:28:10] Hallelujah let me just hurry here
[1:28:14] if the musicians will come
[1:28:16] in the sermon
[1:28:18] second-handed Rome
[1:28:22] I really like this
[1:28:24] really really strikes my heart
[1:28:26] Elijah turned around go back and read
[1:28:28] catch what's in front of a catch what's
[1:28:30] behind it Elijah turned around the only
[1:28:33] thing he wanted to know was to ever get
[1:28:35] that promise that's what he wanted and
[1:28:37] he said now I'm going to ask you what
[1:28:40] tell you what my desire is
[1:28:42] is actually speaking of Elisha uh but I
[1:28:46] want a double portion of your spirit to
[1:28:47] come upon me what are you going to say
[1:28:49] Elijah the anointed Prophet turned
[1:28:51] around and said ask a hard thing
[1:28:55] you we want double of what I got but
[1:28:58] that's really hard thing you know my
[1:29:00] brother and sister when you run into uh
[1:29:02] brothers and sisters and families that
[1:29:05] are truly spiritual families
[1:29:08] that didn't just happen
[1:29:11] there's consecration there's dedication
[1:29:13] there's sacrifice
[1:29:17] Lord help us
[1:29:20] ask a hard thing but this will be given
[1:29:23] to you on a condition
[1:29:25] I like doing things on condition as I
[1:29:27] get older I really dislike doing things
[1:29:30] more and more on condition
[1:29:34] I want you to do this this and this and
[1:29:36] then we'll talk about this
[1:29:39] my brother and sister because I've done
[1:29:41] it
[1:29:42] others have done it we promise all kinds
[1:29:44] of things when this happens well I'm
[1:29:46] gonna I'm tell you I'm gonna do this I'm
[1:29:47] going to do this and you know I was
[1:29:49] talking to a man you know sometime back
[1:29:52] here and he told me he says brother Paul
[1:29:54] it's quite a drive from where I live but
[1:29:56] but I'm going to start being in church
[1:29:58] you're going to see me in church I'm
[1:29:59] going to be in church
[1:30:01] and I thought you know what I'm going to
[1:30:03] get all excited about this right after
[1:30:04] he's in church the first time
[1:30:08] and from that time to this time he's yet
[1:30:10] to fail to show up
[1:30:12] now I'm not judging him don't get me
[1:30:13] wrong but you see in the moment the
[1:30:16] enthusiasm of the moment it was like yes
[1:30:20] but I want to know do you still want to
[1:30:22] be in church on your worst day
[1:30:24] [Music]
[1:30:26] on your Wednesdays or
[1:30:28] as one Minister said
[1:30:30] what would happen if Church got moved
[1:30:33] from Sunday to Monday would you still
[1:30:35] show up
[1:30:36] [Music]
[1:30:38] you know the old joke about Mondays
[1:30:41] but you see my brother and sisters
[1:30:43] it's what we are it's who we are and he
[1:30:46] says right here
[1:30:48] turned around says to ask a hard thing
[1:30:51] but this will be given to you on a
[1:30:52] condition so
[1:30:54] is the Holy Ghost given to you on a
[1:30:57] condition see on conditions if you can
[1:30:59] meet the condition that is if you can
[1:31:01] see me while I go away you'll have what
[1:31:04] you ask for that's all Elisha wanted was
[1:31:08] the promise amen if he know the promise
[1:31:12] and the conditions of the promise then
[1:31:14] he kept his eyes right on Elijah and I
[1:31:16] can imagine somebody saying sir what are
[1:31:19] you bothering him for I ain't got no
[1:31:22] time to talk to you I'm looking straight
[1:31:24] at him and today the promise many of you
[1:31:27] here is sick and the promise is to you
[1:31:30] if thou can'tst believe you've got the
[1:31:33] promise the promise is laid down here in
[1:31:35] the Bible the promise is yours but the
[1:31:37] trouble of it you let the schools of the
[1:31:40] prophets and everything else call you
[1:31:43] from one side to the other side telling
[1:31:46] you discouraging and telling you days of
[1:31:49] Miracles has passed well what if it is
[1:31:51] my brother and sister that you have
[1:31:53] claimed your healing amen and you
[1:31:56] believe them days of Miracles are still
[1:31:58] present but you have claimed your
[1:32:00] healing and all you testify of what is
[1:32:04] still wrong with you
[1:32:05] Lord help us amen we say we're healed
[1:32:09] but all we can talk about is what our
[1:32:11] problem is
[1:32:12] God help every one of us
[1:32:15] amen
[1:32:17] oh now look at this you let the schools
[1:32:19] of the prophets and be pretty hard in
[1:32:21] this day my brother and sister
[1:32:22] everything else call you from one side
[1:32:24] to the other telling you discouraging
[1:32:27] telling you days of Miracles past no
[1:32:29] such thing it's mind reading well we
[1:32:32] must be living in that day because that
[1:32:33] spirit's around
[1:32:36] and if it's mind reading I say a thank
[1:32:39] you Lord
[1:32:40] because
[1:32:42] we're called to have the mind of Christ
[1:32:46] now Jesus Christ could discern the
[1:32:49] spirits that were there
[1:32:51] and that gift come down on a prophet and
[1:32:53] discern the spirits that were there
[1:32:55] [Music]
[1:32:59] imagine
[1:33:01] you've come to some special meetings
[1:33:05] you check into Motel
[1:33:08] and all night long you toss and turn
[1:33:13] and your mind is consumed
[1:33:16] brother Branham
[1:33:18] is God
[1:33:22] [Music]
[1:33:23] and you get up the next day and you go
[1:33:26] to church
[1:33:28] and you're still tormented
[1:33:30] is this God speaking to me
[1:33:34] what is this is Brother Branham Jesus
[1:33:38] Christ
[1:33:40] and have a prophet
[1:33:43] cut right through all the chatter
[1:33:46] and say oh
[1:33:48] it's all right brother and sister
[1:33:50] [Music]
[1:33:52] people who stayed in the room the night
[1:33:54] before
[1:33:56] believe I am Jesus Christ
[1:34:01] now my brother and sister you won't call
[1:34:03] it psychology that's fine
[1:34:07] but now you got a whole picture
[1:34:09] that it shows that somebody left a
[1:34:11] spirit behind in a room
[1:34:16] Lord help us to leave the right kind of
[1:34:18] spirit in the room
[1:34:20] maybe we could leave a spirit in a motel
[1:34:22] room that they'd dig their Gideon out of
[1:34:24] the drawer and read it
[1:34:28] maybe we could leave such a spirit in
[1:34:30] the workplace the break room
[1:34:32] or wherever it might be
[1:34:34] that people would say you know what I
[1:34:36] need to serve God
[1:34:38] you see my brother and sister
[1:34:40] telepathy mind reading psychology
[1:34:44] all of those things are nothing but a
[1:34:47] distraction from the Devil
[1:34:49] he's trying to speak to the mind of the
[1:34:52] True Believer
[1:34:54] to Sidetrack him
[1:34:57] what is it the prophet of God said it's
[1:34:59] a scarecrow
[1:35:02] what are scarecrows designed for scare
[1:35:04] you away from
[1:35:07] but I'm telling you he's wooed us he's
[1:35:10] called us
[1:35:11] his his wined and dined us if you don't
[1:35:14] mind me putting it that way drawing us
[1:35:16] to him no such thing it's mind reading
[1:35:18] mental telepathy and all those things
[1:35:20] and you listen to it and that's the
[1:35:22] reason you don't receive the promise I
[1:35:24] can imagine Elisha following Elijah with
[1:35:27] him Eyes straight on him he wasn't going
[1:35:30] to turn or see or didn't turn back or
[1:35:32] say hey fellas how do you think I'm
[1:35:34] doing imagine now you see him as Elijah
[1:35:37] is walking along here is Elijah Elisha I
[1:35:41] mean he's so focused
[1:35:44] you know if I sit right here and picked
[1:35:46] any one of you and just sit here and
[1:35:48] stared at you you're a little uneasy
[1:35:50] after a while
[1:35:51] well here's Elisha following Elijah
[1:35:54] knowing that if I turn my eyes away for
[1:35:57] a moment and he's gone I miss the
[1:35:59] promise
[1:36:00] how could we come to a place God help us
[1:36:04] to come to a place we're that focused on
[1:36:06] Jesus Christ amen I don't want to miss
