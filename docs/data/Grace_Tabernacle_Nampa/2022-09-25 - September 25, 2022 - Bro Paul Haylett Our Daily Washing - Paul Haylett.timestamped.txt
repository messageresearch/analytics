[39:05] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[39:08] well you know sometimes Saints
[39:11] things just come in such a way
[39:14] that you just recognize the leadership
[39:18] of the Holy Spirit
[39:20] and uh
[39:22] I'm sorry I've forgotten my brother's
[39:24] name but sure happy to see you God bless
[39:27] you I hope you can stay for the
[39:29] fellowship today and for all the saints
[39:32] it's good to have each and every one of
[39:34] you here today
[39:36] God bless you and uh
[39:40] so as we just look at today I know our
[39:43] sister April had a very early start you
[39:47] know I always thought I want to be a
[39:48] world traveler and so I guess I have to
[39:50] change that and say I'd like to be like
[39:52] sister April
[39:53] and anyway she was up seeing family and
[39:57] the Lord's blessed her with that time to
[39:59] visit family and and to hurry home
[40:03] huh you notice the word
[40:05] home
[40:07] to hurry home yes I say yeah say amen
[40:11] hallelujah
[40:13] anyway sister April this is not my fault
[40:16] it's actually brother Jason's fault and
[40:19] um and I just want to put that
[40:21] disclaimer brother Jason in the back
[40:23] room
[40:25] and he just looked at me and he says
[40:26] Paul if April makes it here in time
[40:30] we need to ask her to come up
[40:33] and we need to lay hands on her
[40:36] you see Saints we won't go into all the
[40:37] details because certainly we don't want
[40:39] that broadcast as it were to the world
[40:41] but
[40:42] our sisters undertaking on humanitarian
[40:45] purposes with a gift that God has given
[40:48] her to help those that are in great need
[40:51] but this is going to be a trip that
[40:55] could entail risk
[40:57] and she sprayed through and she's
[41:00] willing to take that believes that's
[41:02] what God's asked her to do
[41:03] and we're going to come ask our sister
[41:06] April to come forward and we are going
[41:09] to pray
[41:10] that not only God just keep our sister
[41:12] safe right we we want her returning home
[41:15] safe
[41:17] but the gift that God placed in her mind
[41:20] and her hands a skill that is rare I
[41:24] guess you would say amongst believers
[41:27] but
[41:29] to use it the good of humanity
[41:32] the scripture says to be good and to all
[41:34] men
[41:35] especially
[41:37] those of the household of faith and
[41:39] sometimes we forget the all men part and
[41:42] we focus on the household of faith only
[41:45] but by God's grace
[41:48] we believe that our sister will have a
[41:51] good journey
[41:52] she will make a difference in the lives
[41:56] and uh troubles on every hand my brother
[41:59] and sister you realize
[42:01] as I just read a story recently of a man
[42:04] served overseas four tours Afghanistan
[42:10] gets killed one city block from his
[42:12] house by someone running a red light
[42:16] hard to understand isn't it
[42:19] the God's in control
[42:21] sister April will you come
[42:23] Brothers
[42:26] I should invite a few sisters actually
[42:29] but brothers would you come we're going
[42:32] to lay hands on our sister as she and
[42:37] takes part in this journey
[42:39] May
[42:41] God touch
[42:44] you see there's some things we won't go
[42:45] into explaining but you see our sister
[42:48] is not just wanting to go there to
[42:51] to help those who have been physically
[42:53] injured she's like what can I take what
[42:57] can I testify how can I approach this I
[43:00] want to make a difference not just in
[43:02] their physical life
[43:03] been a spiritual life when God opens the
[43:06] doors we want to be prepared to step
[43:09] through that door we don't want to be
[43:11] the person that says well I had an
[43:12] opportunity to witness and I didn't know
[43:15] what to say God help us be prepared to
[43:18] know what to say now that isn't us
[43:21] studying the message so that we can
[43:23] repeat it like an encyclopedia but
[43:25] that's us in the presence of God that we

[46:35] of the Lord today
[46:37] amen I tell you just uh it's just good
[46:40] it's just good to serve the Lord
[46:43] amen you know as we just look at these
[46:46] things my brother and sister how how God
[46:49] just comes
[46:50] he's sovereign
[46:52] God is Sovereign he doesn't need art
[46:54] counsel he doesn't need our advice but
[46:56] my brother and sister will Lord willing
[46:58] touch on that a little later in this
[47:00] service God does care
[47:02] about what you say what you think and
[47:05] what your heart's desires are amen you
[47:08] know there's been times in my life
[47:09] Saints and I don't know how to relate
[47:11] this other than to bring it back of what
[47:13] I have experienced there's been times in
[47:15] my life that I have spoke so boldly that
[47:18] literally when I left the situation
[47:21] I thought Lord
[47:23] what did I just say
[47:28] only to have the Lord come back
[47:31] not an audible voice
[47:33] but open up
[47:35] my Bible
[47:36] and the word speak and realize that
[47:39] wasn't me speaking that's right
[47:41] thank you Lord it wasn't me speaking
[47:43] because when I spoke my brother and
[47:46] sister I couldn't perform
[47:48] what I promised I could not fulfill
[47:52] but then I realized
[47:54] it's not us that's speaking
[47:57] it's our Lord Jesus Christ amen I just
[48:01] want to remind you
[48:03] I meant to announce it this last week
[48:05] and I'm sorry just been overwhelmed and
[48:07] that old carnal thing called work uh
[48:11] trying to do but communion this coming
[48:14] Sunday
[48:15] at 5 PM October the 2nd and
[48:20] doing our best just to stay on schedule
[48:22] before we've you know kind of ended up
[48:25] skipping over things and I don't like
[48:26] that
[48:27] the house of God should not be subject
[48:30] to the world
[48:33] the world needs to be subject to the
[48:35] house of God
[48:37] so communion this coming Sunday I pray
[48:40] all will come and be partakers let's
[48:44] just stand and we'll go into our thought
[48:46] today you know once again I've just been
[48:49] going through the Bible and there's way
[48:51] too many to preach on we could spend the
[48:53] rest of our life preaching on our
[48:56] position of strength the Bible is clear
[48:58] full of the things that God promises to
[49:00] us that he will bring to pass you know
[49:05] it is there my brother and sister I
[49:07] heard the young people singing brother
[49:09] Jason leading them of uh Abraham's
[49:12] children I don't remember the exact
[49:14] words of that song I'm not too good with
[49:16] the the children's songs but you know
[49:19] Father Abraham has many sons and we are
[49:23] here today as the spiritual sons of
[49:25] Abraham promise of the Sands of the sea
[49:28] and by God's grace my brother and sister
[49:30] the word promise that right it wasn't
[49:33] just a promise to Abraham it was
[49:35] actually a promise to all those sons and
[49:38] daughters that were promised to Abraham
[49:40] were part of the promise
[49:42] I'm fulfilling that you're fulfilling
[49:45] that we are a part of the promise
[49:48] given to Abraham we become fulfillment
[49:52] of the promise
[49:54] sometimes we look for God
[49:56] oh
[49:58] I hope it's not too complicated I mean
[50:00] it's so simple it's complicated
[50:01] sometimes we're looking to God to
[50:04] fulfill his promise
[50:07] but he's actually been waiting on us
[50:09] just to take the promise accept it and
[50:12] say This Promise is my promise because
[50:14] God made the promise and I am a son of
[50:18] Abraham's spiritual son and
[50:20] what I've got to do is just take this
[50:22] promise and act on it
[50:24] if I leave it on this shelf my brother
[50:26] and sister remember the little story
[50:27] brother Brown tells about the Mama she's
[50:31] in need and it gets the uh the local
[50:33] authorities or whatever it was involved
[50:36] and and you know she she just has this
[50:38] great need in their life your son oh he
[50:41] sends me these lovely postcards and all
[50:44] of this stuff you know and the man
[50:46] finally something's clicked with him
[50:47] because he's thinking this just doesn't
[50:49] strike me correct and he says can I see
[50:51] those and they're all Bank drafts but
[50:54] they had nice designs on them and she
[50:56] just thought they were some little nice
[50:58] postcard thing with her name on it
[51:01] now my brother and sister I don't want
[51:03] you to leave
[51:04] your postcard
[51:06] in your Bible
[51:09] uncashed
[51:11] it's time for us to take a whole of
[51:13] these things you say brother Paul I've
[51:15] got some things I'm struggling with
[51:17] well praise the Lord
[51:19] praise the Lord
[51:22] amen the devil's not certain he's got
[51:25] you yet
[51:26] yeah in fact he knows he hasn't got you
[51:30] and that's why he hates you that's why
[51:33] he makes and throws down every roadblock
[51:35] he can in front of you it's because he
[51:38] sees something that we ourselves
[51:41] sometimes don't see
[51:44] well thank you Lord the devil's good
[51:46] isn't he yeah he's actually by a
[51:50] challenging you throwing every stumbling
[51:52] block in front of you he's saying I I
[51:55] need to I need to do this I got to do
[51:57] this I got to keep them from coming to
[52:00] their position
[52:01] I want to speak to you today
[52:03] on our daily washing
[52:05] and I know that's something my wife and
[52:08] probably most of our sisters are quite
[52:11] familiar with the daily washing
[52:14] but let's go in our Bibles to Hebrews
[52:16] 10.
[52:17] amen and uh
[52:19] you know I I think it's kind of
[52:21] interesting you know
[52:23] and that the book of Hebrews has really
[52:25] been speaking to me for probably I don't
[52:27] know two or three months I read it and
[52:30] started to re-read again and I I found
[52:34] myself uh uh going back in in the same
[52:38] channel
[52:39] uh what I was reading it in before and
[52:41] so I said you know Lord I'm just going
[52:42] to move on one more book in the Bible
[52:44] and as soon as I've read that book I'm
[52:46] going to come back because you see
[52:48] they're all tied together and I'm going
[52:50] to come back and I'm going to go back
[52:51] through the book of Hebrews again
[52:53] because you see my brother and sister
[52:55] what God has performed
[52:58] is finished
[53:03] very simple what God has performed is
[53:06] finished
[53:07] you see the scripture tells us not going
[53:09] again laying again the foundation of
[53:13] repentance and baptisms and all we don't
[53:16] need to lay that Foundation again that
[53:18] Foundation is laid what we've got to do
[53:20] is believe we're part of that and act on
[53:22] what we read
[53:25] that's what we got to do is act on it
[53:26] amen
[53:28] Hebrews the 10th chapter 16 through 24.
[53:31] amen
[53:34] now as always my brother and sister we
[53:36] should go as our homework
[53:39] as it were only takes a few minutes
[53:43] and you have this great notebook because
[53:45] not all of you write things down and
[53:47] that's good that's fine
[53:48] but we should actually go back anytime
[53:51] the preacher is preaching
[53:53] and you should go back on your own time
[53:55] and read a few scriptures in front and a
[53:58] few scriptures following
[54:01] and you need to go to the quotes and you
[54:04] need to read a little farther up the
[54:06] book and a little farther down the book
[54:09] because I believe I can say from with
[54:12] clear conscience from my heart that
[54:14] brother Chris Brother David myself
[54:17] are not here to paint an alternative
[54:19] picture
[54:20] to the original gospel
[54:22] but sometimes we don't always grasp it
[54:25] comes to this this is what I thought you
[54:27] said or you said and this is what I
[54:30] thought I heard
[54:31] and so we don't want to get off on a
[54:34] tangent we want to stay lined up
[54:36] perfectly and I'm going to put this in a
[54:39] little different fashion sometimes you
[54:41] know the preachers pointed North
[54:45] and you know how the old-timers used to
[54:47] they actually used to do stuff it was
[54:49] land surveyed in the west by this right
[54:51] here and that is they would have a point
[54:54] and they would pick a point and then
[54:56] they would line an individual up and it
[54:58] would be like as it were me looking at
[55:00] brother bomb
[55:02] and then someone else would go further
[55:06] on and look back at brother Bob and me
[55:08] and then they would move right and left
[55:10] until they were lined up and then this
[55:12] would go on and you marked the path that
[55:15] you were walking by aligning to those
[55:19] and days gone by
[55:22] not a new message not a random thing
[55:25] where we stake out our position in Jesus
[55:27] Christ but lining up with the prophets
[55:30] lining up with the apostles lining up in
[55:33] the word in our day and you say but I'm
[55:36] just going to go by Revelation that's
[55:37] good but it doesn't take much for our
[55:39] Revelation to get convoluted
[55:45] are you caught that
[55:46] our Revelation we're not talking about
[55:49] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[55:54] so we want to keep lining up don't we
[55:56] and so I just encourage you a line of
[55:58] scripture in front and behind a quote in
[56:00] front and behind that we stay lined up
[56:04] I feel like preaching
[56:06] praise the Lord Hebrews 10
[56:09] -24
[56:11] . this is a covenant that I will make
[56:13] with them after those days saith the
[56:15] Lord
[56:16] I will put my laws into their hearts
[56:19] aren't you glad you don't have to carry
[56:20] a book around with you
[56:23] and in their minds will I write them and
[56:25] their sins and iniquities will I
[56:27] remember no more
[56:29] now we're remission of these is there is
[56:33] no more offering for sin
[56:37] now my brother and sister I want you to
[56:39] see there's something creeping into the
[56:40] message where we're mixing Judaism once
[56:43] again
[56:44] back into the message
[56:47] be careful of those spirits because
[56:49] they'll take you back
[56:51] under the law
[56:54] you can't claim Grace
[56:57] in the Old Testament
[56:59] as the revelation of the New Testament
[57:01] we see it
[57:03] are you with me we see it
[57:06] but that's not where God said he says I
[57:09] this is the Covenant I will make with
[57:11] them he doesn't Point them back into the
[57:14] Old Testament and say go back here to
[57:16] Isaiah go back to Zechariah go back to
[57:19] these and just follow what they did now
[57:21] read Moses from here to here and follow
[57:24] what they did he says I got a new
[57:26] covenant and I'm going to write the word
[57:28] amen my laws amen which is his word I'm
[57:31] going to write that in their heart
[57:34] praise the Lord that's a another tangent
[57:37] for another day but you see
[57:41] where the remission of these sins and
[57:42] iniquities is there's no more offering
[57:45] for sin
[57:47] that's why we don't have an offering of
[57:49] incense we don't have an offering we're
[57:51] not bringing turtle doves and Bullocks
[57:52] and Lambs because that's been done away
[57:55] with
[57:56] but you realize
[57:58] Jesus said I didn't come to do away with
[58:00] the law that's right
[58:05] yeah
[58:07] so this Grace Grace unto disgrace
[58:10] is not legitimate
[58:13] having therefore Brethren boldness
[58:16] see I want you to catch this this
[58:18] morning Saints the connection between
[58:21] these
[58:22] and boldness amen
[58:26] to enter into the holiest by the blood
[58:28] of Jesus by a New and Living Way which
[58:31] he hath consecrated for us
[58:33] through the veil that is to say his
[58:37] flesh now we often talk about going
[58:39] behind the veil
[58:41] what are we doing do we have a curtain
[58:43] in mind
[58:45] some people have a curtain in mind
[58:46] they're saying I I want to Lord I want
[58:48] to be behind the veil I want to get
[58:50] behind the veil with you you have to get
[58:53] into Jesus Christ
[58:55] to get behind the veil it's not a simple
[58:58] walk
[59:00] right it worked for it worked for the uh
[59:02] Chief priests it worked for those in
[59:05] that day to go into the holiest of
[59:07] holies you see that was a curtain
[59:10] but now it's his flesh that is our
[59:12] curtain yes
[59:13] oh sorry I kept you standing here amen
[59:16] and having a high priest over the house
[59:19] of God
[59:20] amen let us draw near with a True Heart
[59:24] in full Assurance of Faith having our
[59:27] hearts sprinkled from an evil conscious
[59:29] and our bodies washed with pure water
[59:32] let us hold fast the profession of our
[59:34] faith without wavering for he is
[59:38] faithful that promised can we say that
[59:41] together for he is faithful that
[59:45] promised and let us consider one another
[59:48] to provoke unto love and good works
[59:51] Heavenly Father we ask you to bless this
[59:54] time in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[59:56] you may be seated Saints
[59:59] Hallelujah
[1:00:01] now I want to just for just a moment or
[1:00:03] two go back through this scripture and
[1:00:06] just kind of touch on a couple things
[1:00:07] here
[1:00:08] if that would be okay this morning now
[1:00:11] as we look at this my brother and sister
[1:00:13] I believe that we are living in the
[1:00:15] Covenant that's here in Hebrews 10 16. I
[1:00:18] believe that it's there that he's come
[1:00:20] and he has taken and written his word in
[1:00:24] our hearts now some people think that
[1:00:26] when you say he's writing his word my
[1:00:28] brother and sister they think that he's
[1:00:30] writing the Bible but really the word is
[1:00:33] himself
[1:00:35] so he's riding himself on the tables of
[1:00:39] our hearts amen and so it's there that
[1:00:42] it is not as though by memorization that
[1:00:46] that proves who we are but it is the
[1:00:48] fact that Christ himself has come down
[1:00:50] now remember the word and and we're just
[1:00:53] going to hit on the edge of a couple
[1:00:54] things here you do not put wine new wine
[1:00:58] in Old vessels right and you do not put
[1:01:02] it in a vessel that is not clean now I
[1:01:05] hope this morning that you can just be
[1:01:07] mindful of who's preaching to you that I
[1:01:09] am who I am and I try to break that
[1:01:12] habit and every time I try to preach
[1:01:13] like someone else it comes off horribly
[1:01:16] amen so if you want to know when Paul
[1:01:19] tried to preach like someone else just
[1:01:20] go back and remember those horrible
[1:01:22] services
[1:01:24] but my brother and sister have you ever
[1:01:26] been in the field or been working in the
[1:01:28] garden or just life in general and you
[1:01:31] know this happened to me sometime back
[1:01:32] and it's a little embarrassing but I
[1:01:34] want to drive home a point and that is
[1:01:36] brother Paul it had a very particularly
[1:01:38] dirty day and I come home and sister
[1:01:41] Jerry's like you really aren't going to
[1:01:43] come in the house like that are you and
[1:01:45] I'm like well I I don't know what to do
[1:01:47] I actually undressed in the garage and
[1:01:50] my clothes had so much dirt in them that
[1:01:53] as as I was removing them you know it's
[1:01:55] just dirt coming out everywhere no one
[1:01:57] else was home and uh so it's there I go
[1:02:01] and I take a shower and I'm standing in
[1:02:03] the shower and it felt so good you know
[1:02:05] what I'm talking about you're just there
[1:02:06] and this is and this is luxurious and I
[1:02:09] got out and I started to towel off and I
[1:02:12] rubbed the towel around the back of my
[1:02:14] neck and as the towel come around it was
[1:02:17] filthy
[1:02:19] and I thought you know what I had not
[1:02:21] done a very good job
[1:02:22] in the shower there was no time limit it
[1:02:25] wasn't like you've got two minutes in
[1:02:27] the shower and yet I didn't do a very
[1:02:30] good job Saints you know and I used that
[1:02:32] to to make a point to you that we can
[1:02:36] say I washed but at last we are
[1:02:38] completely washed and then we can
[1:02:41] realize you know my grandma you know as
[1:02:44] I've shared times in the past my grandma
[1:02:46] would just rub my elbows till they were
[1:02:48] red because if they were red she
[1:02:50] couldn't see the brown and if they were
[1:02:52] Brown she knew you weren't clean and she
[1:02:54] used I I remember it as being a Brillo
[1:02:56] pad and uh but you look at that my
[1:02:59] brother and sister there's something
[1:03:00] there about knowing that you're
[1:03:03] completely clean not not just as it is I
[1:03:06] washed but I'm dirty behind the ears
[1:03:08] I've got ring around the collar I mean
[1:03:10] look there's a whole industry made about
[1:03:12] this soap will take the stain of the
[1:03:15] Ring Around Your Collar away now if that
[1:03:18] in the natural is such an important
[1:03:20] issue that people don't want to be
[1:03:22] embarrassed by how having a dirty caller
[1:03:24] my brother and sister how much more it
[1:03:26] ought to be to Sons and Daughters of God
[1:03:28] that we would be in a position Washed by
[1:03:31] the Water of the word that it wouldn't
[1:03:33] be oh still a little dirt in my life and
[1:03:36] God would come and deal with us in such
[1:03:39] that we would be not just uh
[1:03:41] acknowledging this is something that
[1:03:43] needs to happen but we would be not a
[1:03:46] hearer of the word but a doer of the
[1:03:48] word amen and how that would change our
[1:03:51] lives and I believe this Covenant my
[1:03:53] brother and sister have been written on
[1:03:55] the hearts of Sons and Daughters of God
[1:03:57] that we would term today as the bride of
[1:04:00] Christ and so you know I love verse 17
[1:04:03] he says their sins and iniquities well I
[1:04:06] remember no more now my brother and
[1:04:08] sister do we believe the Bible
[1:04:10] is it is it a a you know you might say
[1:04:13] or absolute I mean the prophet of God
[1:04:15] said the Bible was our absolute I
[1:04:18] believe the Bible is our absolute and my
[1:04:20] brother and sister if he said there that
[1:04:23] their sins and iniquities will I
[1:04:25] remember no more then why do we listen
[1:04:27] to the devil
[1:04:30] why are we listening to the devil when
[1:04:33] he wants to bring it up from the past he
[1:04:35] wants to dredge you know 31 years and
[1:04:38] three weeks ago you
[1:04:41] no I'm sorry now this is only applies if
[1:04:43] you have legitimately placed it under
[1:04:45] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:04:47] if you put it in a shoe box
[1:04:50] in your closet
[1:04:51] this does not apply
[1:04:55] do you know the police will say often
[1:04:57] times they solve a crime by just simply
[1:04:59] going through people's stuff
[1:05:04] and the devil can have a legitimate
[1:05:06] complaint
[1:05:08] by going through our stuff
[1:05:11] that's why we put it under the blood
[1:05:14] and you know I mean I had a good friend
[1:05:17] worked with him for years worked for a
[1:05:19] cattle ranch and I had a good friend and
[1:05:21] he was a devout Catholic
[1:05:24] and um
[1:05:27] you know my wife knew him well
[1:05:31] and this guy would say Paul you're just
[1:05:32] too religious and I tell him no
[1:05:35] uh yeah you might be right on one side
[1:05:37] because we know how being religious is
[1:05:41] but he was meaning you know just trying
[1:05:42] too hard to serve God he says look I
[1:05:44] love being a Catholic and I said I'm
[1:05:46] sure you do
[1:05:47] he says because I can take confession
[1:05:49] every Friday and I have all weekend to
[1:05:51] party before I go back to work
[1:05:55] now that's an understanding my brother
[1:05:57] and sister now I want you to understand
[1:05:58] that in his mind by going to confession
[1:06:01] he had just been absolved washed
[1:06:09] but he wasn't looking to break a cycle
[1:06:12] he was just looking to a sauce his
[1:06:16] conscience
[1:06:17] and the minute
[1:06:19] the priest said you're forgiven
[1:06:22] it's kind of like a memory card
[1:06:25] they do reach a limit right
[1:06:28] and for him
[1:06:30] being absolved of his sins just erased
[1:06:33] everything on the memory card so he
[1:06:35] could start over
[1:06:38] that's not the word written
[1:06:40] on the table of heart
[1:06:44] that's intellectual that's the church
[1:06:47] that's a different kind of leadership
[1:06:49] that is coming and my brother and sister
[1:06:52] it's in a place where where we're not
[1:06:55] looking
[1:06:57] to how our sins and iniquity remembered
[1:07:00] we're looking to come into a position
[1:07:02] where our sins and our iniquities are
[1:07:04] just gone but you know it's not like we
[1:07:07] want to do that once a year
[1:07:10] now I'm getting ahead of myself so if it
[1:07:12] looks like I left that hanging just
[1:07:14] please bear with me you see my brother
[1:07:17] and sister there is a place there is you
[1:07:20] might say an activity
[1:07:21] that brings Sons and Daughters of God to
[1:07:24] a place they can have boldness to come
[1:07:26] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus
[1:07:31] Christ
[1:07:32] so we don't want to just be as it were
[1:07:35] in a natural partaker that a drop of
[1:07:37] blood on our flesh is sufficient my
[1:07:39] brother and sister God's not caring
[1:07:42] about your flesh he didn't come here to
[1:07:45] redeem that can we say Amen to that
[1:07:47] and what he does is he's looking for a
[1:07:49] people that actually care enough
[1:07:51] to be focused and awake and focus on the
[1:07:54] things of God because they want to be
[1:07:57] that one if we come to a place that we
[1:08:00] think that Church's formality if we
[1:08:02] think that church is going to do it for
[1:08:04] us I went to church today well my
[1:08:06] brother and sister you're fooling your
[1:08:07] plan yourself because that's like
[1:08:09] running through the shower and saying
[1:08:12] I'm clean
[1:08:14] but you come to a place that we need to
[1:08:17] have a boldness can we can we say
[1:08:18] boldness amen that we come to a boldness
[1:08:22] to enter into the holiest not just be
[1:08:25] feel good about coming to church
[1:08:27] by a New and Living Way which he
[1:08:29] consecrated for us now my brother and
[1:08:32] sister he took this way and he committed
[1:08:36] and actually prepared this way for us by
[1:08:39] walking this way before us he didn't say
[1:08:42] you just go and try and do this you go
[1:08:45] and try and live this he walked this way
[1:08:48] that's how this way got consecrated is
[1:08:51] he walked this way and he made this way
[1:08:54] holy for us yeah
[1:08:56] that's right amen
[1:08:57] not just words
[1:09:02] but a New and Living Way what is this
[1:09:06] not the way of humanity
[1:09:08] not the way of tradition
[1:09:10] not the way of our forefathers
[1:09:13] but a new way
[1:09:15] a way that would bring us that he's
[1:09:18] consecrated for us through the veil that
[1:09:21] is to say his flesh and people identify
[1:09:24] and say I'm a Christian Jesus died on
[1:09:26] the cross for me that's good my brother
[1:09:28] and sister but are you in the veil he
[1:09:32] died for you but are you dead in him we
[1:09:36] have to be dead in him for this to
[1:09:39] matter
[1:09:40] to have an identity my brother and
[1:09:42] sister look at the identity crisis the
[1:09:44] world's going through boys don't know
[1:09:46] whether they're boys or not girls don't
[1:09:48] know whether they're girls or not the
[1:09:50] devil has come and used what they call
[1:09:52] them pronouns or whatever well I don't
[1:09:54] care what's yours you call yourself you
[1:09:57] are either saved or you are not you are
[1:10:00] either under the blood or you are not
[1:10:02] you are either in Christ or you are not
[1:10:05] I don't care what kind of title you put
[1:10:08] on that
[1:10:10] and the devil said what I'll do is
[1:10:12] confuse everyone and I'll get it now
[1:10:13] that I can be a a uh oh what was the
[1:10:16] deal I heard the other day my this will
[1:10:18] jump right off my mind if I'm not
[1:10:20] careful
[1:10:21] uh uh uh oh they were saying uh what are
[1:10:24] you he said I I am a practicing
[1:10:26] Christian
[1:10:31] football players practice
[1:10:33] baseball players practice race car
[1:10:36] drivers practice
[1:10:39] but some of them are never winners
[1:10:43] so being a practicing Christian is no
[1:10:46] Assurance you'll be a winner
[1:10:48] oh I'll tell you what my brother and
[1:10:50] sister I heard the word in by God's
[1:10:52] grace oh you'll say brother Paul I know
[1:10:54] you have come short I have come short
[1:10:57] but I'm telling you I'm not practicing
[1:10:59] at being a Christian I am a Christian
[1:11:03] hallelujah amen maybe a doctor might
[1:11:06] have to go through a period of time and
[1:11:09] you know it's kind of funny because I
[1:11:10] remember in one of the times in my life
[1:11:12] that I've been operated on the doctor
[1:11:14] said and this is Dr so and so and this
[1:11:17] is his first Standalone surgery
[1:11:21] let me off this table
[1:11:24] I'm out of here
[1:11:27] you see my brother and sister
[1:11:30] it's there then in a way it really
[1:11:32] wasn't
[1:11:34] this is the first time sister April
[1:11:36] would understand this it's the first
[1:11:37] time
[1:11:38] standing there as an authority of a
[1:11:41] doctor to say
[1:11:43] whatever the terms are
[1:11:45] hand me this
[1:11:46] give me this
[1:11:48] do this
[1:11:49] full Authority
[1:11:52] well
[1:11:54] I won't go there
[1:11:57] there's a doctor in the house
[1:12:00] Hallelujah but look at this my brother
[1:12:03] and sister that it is a New and Living
[1:12:06] Way this is not an all dead letter this
[1:12:09] is not word that we look back and say
[1:12:11] God sent a prophet and feel like that is
[1:12:13] adequate to do this this is a living
[1:12:16] word that has come right down in this
[1:12:18] church this morning to touch the lives
[1:12:20] of Sons and Daughters of God Believers
[1:12:23] as we call ourselves it is a Living Word
[1:12:25] just as living today as it has ever been
[1:12:28] in history and that brings out a point
[1:12:30] people say well do we believe we had
[1:12:33] more than the Apostle Paul had no my
[1:12:35] brother and sister we have not one ounce
[1:12:37] more than the Apostle Paul had the
[1:12:39] prophet of God even identified and said
[1:12:42] I'm preached what Paul preached but I'll
[1:12:44] tell you what we do have we have the
[1:12:47] full revelation of Jesus Christ that was
[1:12:50] revealing himself to the Apostle Paul
[1:12:52] and the word said in this day there
[1:12:55] would be a full revelation of that and
[1:12:58] there's no other age can make that claim
[1:13:01] and people want to push back you're
[1:13:03] saying that we have more that we have
[1:13:05] more no I don't have more by Revelation
[1:13:09] I understand more Louis see more because
[1:13:12] this is the culmination of all the ages
[1:13:15] and the Revelation was promised to be
[1:13:17] revealed in this day Hallelujah now look
[1:13:21] my brother and sister and I need to move
[1:13:22] on because as this is
[1:13:25] I can smell it already and that's
[1:13:27] horrible
[1:13:28] look we draw near with a True Heart
[1:13:31] right not not a false heart
[1:13:34] that's right I'm telling you what's
[1:13:36] happening
[1:13:37] things are shaking up
[1:13:40] things are shaking up
[1:13:42] people
[1:13:44] who said they believe
[1:13:46] 20 30 40 50 years
[1:13:50] one day get up and say I'm offended
[1:13:57] how can that be
[1:14:00] how can that be
[1:14:02] I tell you what they've said to
[1:14:03] themselves for years
[1:14:05] I don't like that
[1:14:08] but I don't know how to articulate
[1:14:13] they've never liked it
[1:14:16] never liked it can I drive that home to
[1:14:18] you they have never liked that
[1:14:22] and the tolerance
[1:14:24] you know you guys gave me permission you
[1:14:26] know as I get older you said you can be
[1:14:28] bolder brother Paul that's fine
[1:14:30] why aren't we just born bold
[1:14:34] we're not
[1:14:36] we're not born bull
[1:14:39] and the unbeliever
[1:14:41] might sit in the house of God for season
[1:14:43] after season after season
[1:14:46] and that spirit
[1:14:48] is getting
[1:14:49] bolder
[1:14:51] and bolder
[1:14:53] until finally
[1:14:55] it feels bold enough to stand up and say
[1:14:57] don't believe a word of it
[1:15:00] well you know I'm supposed to be
[1:15:01] impressed you're supposed to be
[1:15:02] impressed but my Bible said a
[1:15:04] double-minded man is unstable in all of
[1:15:06] his ways and then you just watch their
[1:15:08] lives and they're tottering here and
[1:15:10] tottering there well what about this
[1:15:12] church no good I don't like that church
[1:15:14] what about this church no good I don't
[1:15:15] like that church and they can't even
[1:15:17] find a place to call a spiritual home or
[1:15:19] they turn around and completely go back
[1:15:21] and become trinitarians again
[1:15:25] and that just tells you never actually
[1:15:26] believed
[1:15:31] so we've got to come with a True Heart
[1:15:33] in a full Assurance of Faith having a
[1:15:35] heart sprinkled from an evil conscious
[1:15:37] and our bodies washed with pure water
[1:15:41] now my brother and sister I want you to
[1:15:44] really focus on verse 23.
[1:15:46] let us hold fast the profession of our
[1:15:49] faith without wavering
[1:15:52] I can think of several examples and it
[1:15:55] they don't make our heart happy but I'm
[1:15:57] not going to shy away from speaking them
[1:15:59] we prayed for a little sister up in
[1:16:01] Canada and as we're praying for her we
[1:16:04] see her withering away and when she
[1:16:07] passed from this life she was nothing
[1:16:10] but bones
[1:16:12] and until she lost her voice
[1:16:15] her profession was Jesus Christ is my
[1:16:19] healer
[1:16:21] never wavered while this demon called
[1:16:24] cancer gnaws away at her to bring our
[1:16:27] sister down to Skin and Bones and she's
[1:16:30] still there saying he is my healer and I
[1:16:35] trust him
[1:16:38] and knowing that from one breath
[1:16:41] to the next she's perfectly whole
[1:16:46] well I can't I can't believe that if
[1:16:48] God's our healing he's answered do it
[1:16:49] here he's going to do it now no I'm
[1:16:52] sorry I've given my life into his hands
[1:16:54] he's the one that's giving direction to
[1:16:56] my life he's the one that's in control
[1:16:58] and if he says this is what I'm doing
[1:17:01] then I want to say thank you Lord for
[1:17:04] including me in your plan
[1:17:07] because I tell you what my brother and
[1:17:09] sister you could live in a perfect world
[1:17:10] and there's people that are on the fence
[1:17:12] serving God struggle with this they say
[1:17:14] how come these people have such good
[1:17:16] life and life is hard for us well my
[1:17:18] brother and sister you've got it hard
[1:17:19] right now like Lazarus but you're going
[1:17:21] to be blessed they've got it good right
[1:17:24] now and they're going to be cursed
[1:17:26] you get to choose but as we have said in
[1:17:28] this church many a time you pay now or
[1:17:31] you pay later but you will pay
[1:17:34] and it all depends on what we want
[1:17:37] we can pay now or we can pay later now
[1:17:40] look at this
[1:17:41] our bodies washed with pure water and
[1:17:43] I'm going to move on here because I'm
[1:17:44] getting distracted
[1:17:46] look at this my brother and sister we
[1:17:48] are in this world are we not but we're
[1:17:50] not of this world
[1:17:52] amen so as we journey in the land now
[1:17:55] just just remember for a moment where
[1:17:57] I'm coming from as we journey in the
[1:18:00] land we find that the dirt of the world
[1:18:02] settles on us
[1:18:04] if it did not in the natural we'd never
[1:18:06] have to take a bath
[1:18:08] but the dirt of this world settles on us
[1:18:11] you can go my I'm telling you what some
[1:18:14] of the worst experiences I've had in the
[1:18:16] world in the last while have not meant
[1:18:19] me at some kind of ball game or me at
[1:18:21] some kind of whatever event it's been me
[1:18:23] in the grocery store
[1:18:26] and you walk in a grocery store and it's
[1:18:28] like oh my they forgot to dress before
[1:18:30] they left their house
[1:18:32] oh my look at these behaviors look at
[1:18:34] and you hear profanities that shouldn't
[1:18:37] be uttered even in their darkest dungeon
[1:18:40] and they're uttered in front of their
[1:18:41] children in front of people in public
[1:18:43] and this is the world we live in and my
[1:18:46] brother and sister as we work in this
[1:18:48] world you have the dust and the dirt of
[1:18:51] this world settle upon you and we go
[1:18:53] home in the natural and take a shower to
[1:18:56] deal with the dust and the dirt we come
[1:18:57] my brother and sister in a spiritual
[1:18:59] realm in a context we must do something
[1:19:02] to deal with the dust and the dirt of
[1:19:05] this world
[1:19:06] we cannot just say well I'm a Christian
[1:19:08] it doesn't affect me I would deny even
[1:19:11] the strongest Christian cannot say that
[1:19:14] going out and I say this in humor
[1:19:16] brother Donnie spoke in an open Forum I
[1:19:19] believe I can repeat this but brother
[1:19:21] Donnie one time recounting he said you
[1:19:23] know he stopped and looked a little
[1:19:25] something in the in the grocery store
[1:19:27] Walmart I was in Walmart and he said I
[1:19:29] looked a little something and I was
[1:19:31] walking to catch up with my wife sister
[1:19:35] Carol and as I see beyond Carol I see
[1:19:38] two young girls and they're walking
[1:19:40] pointing at sister Carol snickering
[1:19:43] and as they are going along their
[1:19:45] distance
[1:19:47] and they walk on by Sister Carol doesn't
[1:19:49] even pay any attention to him she just
[1:19:51] walks on by and they're looking back
[1:19:55] and the girl runs right into the post
[1:20:02] now it's funny in the humor but brother
[1:20:04] Tony is taking it into a spiritual realm
[1:20:06] you see my brother and sister somewhere
[1:20:08] beyond the Snickers and all of the filth
[1:20:10] of laodicea somebody's going to get the
[1:20:13] post
[1:20:13] somebody's going to come to a startling
[1:20:16] stop in their life and they're going to
[1:20:18] say what happened
[1:20:19] there's going to be people that are
[1:20:21] going to look one day and say how did I
[1:20:22] end up here
[1:20:24] and and in all sincerity they'll be
[1:20:26] thoroughly confused
[1:20:28] so we see that the dust of this world
[1:20:30] seems to settle and as I said already
[1:20:32] one works in the natural so what do we
[1:20:34] do we need a good cleansing
[1:20:37] not a Paul hurry up through the shower
[1:20:39] oh ring around the collar cleansing but
[1:20:41] a real honest cleansing
[1:20:45] to get out
[1:20:47] and do this and we know my brother and
[1:20:49] sister in the world we live in
[1:20:51] we barely have to do anything you can't
[1:20:53] even walk out and get the mail but what
[1:20:54] you look down and your hands are dirty
[1:20:57] now I live in a little different world
[1:20:58] than most of you do you guys have enough
[1:21:00] Asphalt in your world that it kind of
[1:21:02] alleviates that
[1:21:04] but in our world you you can't even you
[1:21:06] can't haul the trash out you can't go to
[1:21:08] the mailbox but you come back and you
[1:21:10] realize hmm
[1:21:12] my hands are dirty
[1:21:15] and there has to be something
[1:21:18] that we do about that
[1:21:20] something changes in human nature my
[1:21:23] brother and sister when we come to the
[1:21:24] place we no longer care
[1:21:27] we lose hope and we quit washing
[1:21:29] ourselves I'm talking in the natural
[1:21:31] if you've ever been
[1:21:33] in the far reaches of Argentina poverty
[1:21:37] is so rampant even amongst the Believers
[1:21:39] it's heartbreaking
[1:21:41] I've left a lot of your money there
[1:21:47] and you know it's interesting it sets
[1:21:48] the Believers apart from those in those
[1:21:50] little squalor Village
[1:21:53] the Believers in pretty much what you
[1:21:55] would call rags
[1:21:57] clean
[1:22:01] when you look around you
[1:22:04] there's a lot of dirty people I'm
[1:22:06] talking in the natural
[1:22:08] why they've lost a hope
[1:22:11] but God by God's grace my brother and
[1:22:13] sister our hope is not based on our bank
[1:22:15] account
[1:22:17] our hope is based on the fact that we've
[1:22:20] went behind the veil in the flesh of
[1:22:22] Jesus Christ and we can now say We Are
[1:22:25] One With Our Redeemer we are one with a
[1:22:28] body that we call the word we are one
[1:22:30] with this we are not separated and my
[1:22:33] brother and sister to take a position
[1:22:35] that we are separated from Our Redeemer
[1:22:38] from our bridegroom is to say I'm lost I
[1:22:41] don't have revelation of who I am and
[1:22:44] who he is but we have a revelation today
[1:22:47] Can someone say Amen that we know who we
[1:22:51] are I am a part of Jesus Christ I'm a
[1:22:54] part of my redeemer I'm not just some
[1:22:56] little poor ragged individual that got
[1:22:59] saved I'm a part of him
[1:23:01] amen and when he is there the prophet of
[1:23:04] God says wherever Jesus Christ is the
[1:23:09] Supernatural is present and I'm telling
[1:23:12] you my brother and sister it's because
[1:23:14] we are not taking that promise that
[1:23:16] we're not seeing the supernatural people
[1:23:18] say I don't see it I don't see it where
[1:23:20] is it out I've had people speak to me
[1:23:22] brother Paul where is the Supernatural
[1:23:25] Well what we got to do is quit just
[1:23:27] going to church quit being religious
[1:23:29] quit being message Believers and we've
[1:23:31] got to get into his flesh we're going to
[1:23:33] get into that Veil because wherever he's
[1:23:36] at the Supernatural is present
[1:23:40] do we believe that today
[1:23:42] Hallelujah the problem is we're
[1:23:44] comfortable with going to church
[1:23:47] now when something changes in the human
[1:23:51] nature as I said they no longer care
[1:23:53] you'll see they quit washing themselves
[1:23:56] now Sister Jerry and I many times in a
[1:23:59] certain place in Chile
[1:24:01] have passed by this and we're talking
[1:24:03] about people with no inhibitions
[1:24:10] used to walk by there and there was some
[1:24:13] stuff piled on this corner
[1:24:15] you realize people are living there
[1:24:20] and they were strategic it wasn't that
[1:24:22] they chose the corner
[1:24:24] they chose the fire hydrant
[1:24:30] next thing you know they've dug a hole
[1:24:31] in the dirt Bank
[1:24:33] they've lined it with pallets
[1:24:35] they put pallets for a roof they found
[1:24:37] 10 for that they've made a door
[1:24:41] but I'm telling you Saints with a little
[1:24:42] humor it's shocking when one day
[1:24:45] they're in Chile you're driving up to
[1:24:46] this stop sign
[1:24:48] and here's a man has cracked the fire
[1:24:50] hydrant so a spray of waters out there
[1:24:53] and there he is just as he was born
[1:24:56] standing right on the side of the street
[1:24:59] with a bar of soap
[1:25:02] what was it abject poverty
[1:25:05] doesn't even have a house to call his
[1:25:07] own
[1:25:08] there's a little kids up playing in the
[1:25:10] dirt
[1:25:11] but there was something in them
[1:25:13] I want to be clean
[1:25:16] you realize that's what sets the bride
[1:25:18] of Christ away from the rest of the
[1:25:19] world
[1:25:20] you have an intense desire to be clean
[1:25:26] you don't want to just look like the
[1:25:27] world my brother and sister we can jump
[1:25:29] and we can shout but the prophet of God
[1:25:31] says don't uh uh oh how did he say that
[1:25:34] I'm going to mess it up now amen you
[1:25:37] need to live as high as you jump or be
[1:25:38] able to live it when you come down or
[1:25:39] however my mind just scrambled that but
[1:25:42] look at this my brothers and sisters as
[1:25:44] we do this so in this change in humanity
[1:25:46] some lose hope and some say I can't live
[1:25:50] like that I have to wash even if it
[1:25:53] would be a man of zero inhibition
[1:25:56] standing literally on there's no
[1:25:58] sidewalk there but in the gutter of the
[1:26:00] street washing in the water from a fire
[1:26:02] hydrant and he didn't care why because
[1:26:04] his desirably clean now look
[1:26:07] you imagine how it'd be comes out there
[1:26:10] with four little walls and sets them up
[1:26:12] with a little deal over it and you know
[1:26:15] has a little door and a partition place
[1:26:16] to hang his towel put his bar of soap
[1:26:19] you know what had happened
[1:26:20] the next truck that come by
[1:26:23] be nothing
[1:26:24] he said I don't need formality I need to
[1:26:26] be clean
[1:26:28] put on your spiritual thinking help
[1:26:30] I don't need formality I need to be
[1:26:32] clean
[1:26:33] amen now sorry I present it to you in
[1:26:36] such a way
[1:26:37] amen now look at this we want to go in
[1:26:40] first John 2 14. I I hope I can lay this
[1:26:43] out to you today
[1:26:44] I have written unto you fathers because
[1:26:47] you have known him that is from the
[1:26:48] beginning I've written unto you young
[1:26:50] men because you are strong and the word
[1:26:52] of God abideth in you and you have
[1:26:54] overcome the wicked one what a testimony
[1:26:57] what what a word of confidence that is
[1:27:00] spoken here
[1:27:01] he says love not the world neither the
[1:27:04] things that are in the world and if any
[1:27:05] man love the world the love of the
[1:27:07] father is not in him for all that is in
[1:27:09] the world now look what he's doing he's
[1:27:12] identifying when you say well love not
[1:27:13] the world and we can look out here and
[1:27:15] say there's a lot of good things in this
[1:27:17] world there's a lot of good people in
[1:27:18] this world but my brother and sister we
[1:27:20] have to look a little deeper than the
[1:27:22] surface and he says for all that is in
[1:27:25] the world
[1:27:29] can this really honestly Define the
[1:27:31] world
[1:27:33] it really honestly does
[1:27:35] because if there's an absent of light
[1:27:39] Darkness pervades
[1:27:42] for all that is in the world the lust of
[1:27:44] the flesh
[1:27:46] my
[1:27:48] gets down to some rough business here
[1:27:49] Saints we get squeamish
[1:27:52] come on let's face it Saints we get
[1:27:54] squeamish
[1:27:57] well like this message but we don't want
[1:28:00] to talk
[1:28:01] about
[1:28:03] the lust of the flesh
[1:28:09] oh and we don't want to talk about
[1:28:12] the lust of the eyes
[1:28:15] or even a prophet said I hang across
[1:28:17] from my rearview mirror
[1:28:20] and when I see it he saw it
[1:28:24] don't act all so shocked you know
[1:28:26] spiritual like the prophet of God never
[1:28:28] know he's the prophet no sir he hung
[1:28:31] that cross on his mirror because after
[1:28:33] the first look he needed a place to
[1:28:35] focus
[1:28:38] amen
[1:28:39] otherwise
[1:28:41] come on let's be honest Brothers
[1:28:43] we've looked twice
[1:28:46] and then we said Lord forgive me
[1:28:50] what we need is that inspiration
[1:28:54] to focus
[1:28:57] on that
[1:28:58] because this is the world right
[1:29:01] that's not too straight is it
[1:29:05] wives don't be shocked if your husband
[1:29:07] nodded his head yes when he said he
[1:29:09] looked twice
[1:29:10] do you realize the spirit of laodicea is
[1:29:14] the Same Spirit as in the beginning and
[1:29:16] it caused a whole world to be turned
[1:29:18] upside down in the beginning what is it
[1:29:20] going to do in this day
[1:29:23] but I tell you what God's doing he's
[1:29:25] moving upon Sons and Daughters of God to
[1:29:27] change their life
[1:29:30] that we are new creatures in Christ
[1:29:33] Jesus creatures as it were with tunnel
[1:29:36] vision
[1:29:38] the loss of the Flesh and the lust of
[1:29:40] the eyes and this is actually one that I
[1:29:43] would say there's a lot of good people
[1:29:45] that don't suffer from these other
[1:29:46] factors but the pride of life overcomes
[1:29:49] and you say well I'm not a proud person
[1:29:51] but you know what we wore sarcar on
[1:29:54] Sunday instead of going to church
[1:29:55] amen we will mow the grass or we do
[1:29:58] these things that are more important to
[1:30:01] us on Sunday than it is to go to the
[1:30:04] house of God and you know what that all
[1:30:06] comes down to it comes down to the value
[1:30:09] you place on Jesus Christ
[1:30:12] now I understand there are things in our
[1:30:14] life that prevent us sometimes as it
[1:30:17] would be certain circumstances uh of
[1:30:20] Employments and different things that
[1:30:22] that would keep us from that but I'm
[1:30:24] talking about that habitual deal where
[1:30:26] it's not a not a old Lord I want to be
[1:30:29] in the house of God today you know I'll
[1:30:31] just tell you this happened last summer
[1:30:33] I I was coming up I was all scheduled to
[1:30:36] preach and and then you know they come
[1:30:38] along and the dairyman says uh you know
[1:30:41] um we've got all this hey bot but we
[1:30:43] don't have hay here on the dairy and we
[1:30:45] need you guys to put this hay up this
[1:30:48] weekend so we can feed it to our cows
[1:30:50] and I was like Lord seriously there's
[1:30:53] like a hundred and some acres in this
[1:30:54] field there's no way I can make it to
[1:30:56] church
[1:30:58] and I was like Lord just what do I do
[1:31:00] what do I do and I I almost called
[1:31:02] brother Chris almost called Brother
[1:31:04] David you know like you guys gonna have
[1:31:05] to cover this but I had a burden to
[1:31:07] preach what I was going to preach and
[1:31:09] you know I got up Sunday morning and it
[1:31:10] had rained
[1:31:14] thank you Lord It's not often that a hay
[1:31:17] farmer says oh thank you Lord for rain
[1:31:19] on the hay crop then I got up that
[1:31:22] morning thank you Lord and I get to go
[1:31:24] to church and I get to preach what's
[1:31:26] burning in my heart and so the Lord knew
[1:31:29] where I was at but you see my brother
[1:31:31] and sister when we get to the place that
[1:31:33] other things have more value and it what
[1:31:36] it is it's a pride of life this is
[1:31:39] important to me
[1:31:41] am I getting too strident
[1:31:44] and the world passeth away and the loss
[1:31:46] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[1:31:48] God abideth forever I'm on board on this
[1:31:51] abiding forever amen I'm on board for
[1:31:54] eternal life
[1:31:55] amen you know some people say well I
[1:31:58] don't know if it's real or not seems
[1:32:00] like it doesn't matter seems like it is
[1:32:02] yes I hear the devil too
[1:32:04] I hear the devil too
[1:32:07] you know just like you know hearing you
[1:32:10] know some pop star rock star whatever
[1:32:12] singing Amazing Grace
[1:32:15] I hear their voice
[1:32:17] the words they're saying is good words
[1:32:21] but the pride of life behind it why
[1:32:24] because a manager I read this come
[1:32:26] straight out of their horse's mouth a
[1:32:28] manager says you will reach out to the
[1:32:31] Christian crowd
[1:32:33] and get their money also
[1:32:36] no sorry I'm not going to listen to some
[1:32:38] guy that worshiped the devil last night
[1:32:40] and sings Christian song today
[1:32:43] I don't want to listen to him
[1:32:45] amen but he that doeth the will of God
[1:32:48] abideth forever now look what Satan
[1:32:51] wants to put on his Saints each one of
[1:32:53] these Satan
[1:32:55] now Brothers you don't have to say amen
[1:32:57] I just simply know it is a fact
[1:32:59] Satan wants to put the lust of the flesh
[1:33:05] on men and women
[1:33:07] we always Focus said sorry sisters I
[1:33:10] couldn't spare you
[1:33:11] we always focus it on men men issues
[1:33:14] with us no I'm sorry
[1:33:16] no I'm sorry what happened in the garden
[1:33:19] wasn't a man thing
[1:33:22] it was a woman thing
[1:33:24] and the man was a part of it we won't go
[1:33:26] into that we know what brother Brown
[1:33:27] said but see the devil wants to put the
[1:33:29] lust of the Flesh and that will sneak up
[1:33:31] on us
[1:33:34] and the lust of the eyes that will sneak
[1:33:36] up on us
[1:33:37] and pride of life that will sneak up on
[1:33:41] us
[1:33:43] and say but brother Paul I'm not
[1:33:45] backslid
[1:33:46] no you're not
[1:33:48] unless
[1:33:50] you don't get washed from that
[1:33:54] and if you let the I think this is a
[1:33:56] joke sisters do not crucify me I don't
[1:33:58] want to be locked outside and banned
[1:34:01] from fellowship today
[1:34:02] but you'll walk into somebody's house
[1:34:07] please find humor please I beg you find
[1:34:09] humor
[1:34:11] you walked into somebody's house
[1:34:13] and you're there and they say look um
[1:34:16] forgive me but I just haven't had time
[1:34:18] to do
[1:34:19] the house cleaning lately
[1:34:22] and as you brush some great big megawatt
[1:34:26] cobweb out of your way you're like
[1:34:30] I understand
[1:34:32] yeah
[1:34:40] no we were going to go to town and eat
[1:34:47] the same
[1:34:49] it's the dirt in our lives
[1:34:53] do you know Saints we don't even need to
[1:34:55] try to explain
[1:34:58] I've been having a hard time preacher
[1:35:04] oh some are going to say he's been
[1:35:06] derogatory no I'm not
[1:35:09] I'm telling you
[1:35:10] God wants it to be obvious
[1:35:13] right
[1:35:16] can you hold on that you're all quiet
[1:35:18] can you hold on we want to hide it
[1:35:22] let's take it back to the Garden we want
[1:35:24] to hide it
[1:35:25] as a prophet of God tells us Adam and
[1:35:28] Eve should have been running through the
[1:35:30] garden oh Father father where are you
[1:35:35] at the nature
[1:35:37] I just want to hide this
[1:35:41] and the dirt in our lives my brother and
[1:35:43] sister
[1:35:43] we think it's hidden
[1:35:47] but just as the cobweb
[1:35:49] starts to grow
[1:35:52] and it's obvious
[1:35:55] the dirt in our lives
[1:35:58] is obvious
[1:36:01] God help us
[1:36:03] I'm not criticizing no one I just want
[1:36:05] us to be aware and you know they saved
[1:36:07] for the first step of recovery is
[1:36:09] acknowledging there's something there
[1:36:10] that needs to be changed and I say God
[1:36:13] help us when we see the little clutter
[1:36:16] of the dirt of our life building up in
[1:36:18] our life and we do nothing about it
[1:36:20] Satan's convinced us we're okay and I'm
[1:36:22] going to read you some scripture here in
[1:36:24] a minute that we'll just touch on that
[1:36:25] and see how Jesus chooses to deal with
[1:36:28] this amen so look what Satan wants to
[1:36:31] put on us though of these things no
[1:36:34] natural washing will take those away
[1:36:37] that's why it says well you know I I I
[1:36:40] had some troubles in my life I got
[1:36:41] baptized again I met a man one time he
[1:36:44] said brother Paul he said I've just been
[1:36:46] through everything so much in my life so
[1:36:49] many problems he said I think I've been
[1:36:50] baptized five or six times I don't even
[1:36:52] remember how many times I've been
[1:36:54] baptized and I'm thinking oh okay and he
[1:36:57] says but let me tell you the last time
[1:36:59] it stuck
[1:37:01] I was like well that's the way to look
[1:37:03] at it amen he come to a place in his
[1:37:05] life but you see my brother and sister
[1:37:07] it isn't necessarily necessary to go
[1:37:10] back every time we do because imagine we
[1:37:13] just have to be like we were in a sheep
[1:37:14] dip and when you guys walked in the door
[1:37:16] of the church it would be Splash and you
[1:37:18] would come out and go to church
[1:37:20] that's not how it works
[1:37:23] but God says I am going to wash you I
[1:37:26] don't got to baptize you again but I'm
[1:37:28] going to wash you again and again and
[1:37:31] again and again and again and I'm going
[1:37:33] to wash you so many times that you're
[1:37:35] going to say Lord why do I keep failing
[1:37:38] and he's going to say come let me wash
[1:37:39] you again
[1:37:41] Hallelujah
[1:37:44] look
[1:37:46] let's face it we don't even have to get
[1:37:48] technical the spirit of Sodom is here
[1:37:51] I jokingly say this I I preached
[1:37:53] probably 10 12 years ago well it's got
[1:37:56] to be the coming of the Lord right now
[1:37:57] because this world is Sodom
[1:38:00] and I didn't even have a clue
[1:38:02] I didn't have a clue
[1:38:04] that people would do what they do to
[1:38:07] their own offspring
[1:38:10] yeah and the spirit of laodicea
[1:38:12] the spirit of satanic worship
[1:38:17] unclean spirits evil is good good is
[1:38:19] evil amen but look what this is by
[1:38:22] tradition
[1:38:24] they're presentable
[1:38:26] now I hope this don't really strike you
[1:38:29] wrong
[1:38:30] but you know how they're cleansed to be
[1:38:31] presentable
[1:38:34] by symbolism
[1:38:38] they have all the right symbols
[1:38:41] they go through all the right motions
[1:38:45] they attend the right Church sent under
[1:38:46] the right pastor
[1:38:48] pray over their food
[1:38:50] won't walk out of the house in the
[1:38:52] morning on their way to work without
[1:38:53] praying for God's mercy as they travel
[1:38:56] they have all kinds of symbolism
[1:38:58] but they don't have him
[1:39:05] I don't want to offend you but I will go
[1:39:08] ahead and say this I was going to skip
[1:39:09] over
[1:39:13] symbolism
[1:39:17] God sent a prophet
[1:39:23] that's right exactly I believe
[1:39:26] the message of the hour
[1:39:30] my brother and sister unless you have
[1:39:32] got into Christ
[1:39:34] that is nothing more than empty words no
[1:39:38] different to the man who says I'm a
[1:39:41] Catholic
[1:39:43] people get offended about that my
[1:39:45] brother and sister but it's the truth
[1:39:47] because it comes to a place that they
[1:39:50] believe if they do all the right motions
[1:39:52] and do all the right things at the right
[1:39:55] time
[1:39:57] that everything is covered you can
[1:39:59] listen to a message at the right time
[1:40:02] but my brother and sister unless that
[1:40:04] message makes it down inside of us in a
[1:40:08] life-changing event you might as well be
[1:40:10] the one that gets up totally polar
[1:40:12] opposite and does whatever everybody's
[1:40:15] doing because unless it gets inside of
[1:40:17] you you're no different
[1:40:19] and that's kind of straightforward but
[1:40:21] I'm telling you it's Christ you getting
[1:40:24] into the Flesh of Christ which is the
[1:40:27] word amen and when you get into that
[1:40:30] position God will lead you
[1:40:32] you won't need a man to tell you what to
[1:40:35] do God will lead you
[1:40:37] amen
[1:40:39] oh hallelujah look we're not we're not
[1:40:42] uh exempt from the effects of symbolism
[1:40:47] but look how Jesus deals with this as we
[1:40:49] go
[1:40:50] Mark 7
[1:40:52] then came together unto him the
[1:40:54] Pharisees and certain of the scribes
[1:40:56] which came from Jerusalem and when they
[1:40:58] saw some of the disciples eat bread
[1:41:00] defiled
[1:41:02] that is to say
[1:41:03] you see now look don't you love how
[1:41:06] that's worded defiled
[1:41:08] well that is to say they never washed
[1:41:10] their hands
[1:41:11] defiled sounds
[1:41:14] really really serious
[1:41:17] it's against the law I mean you could be
[1:41:20] kicked Plum out of the assembly
[1:41:24] because you didn't wash their hands when
[1:41:26] you ate
[1:41:27] well anybody wants to come out to the
[1:41:29] farm and worship with me it looks like
[1:41:30] I've been disassociated
[1:41:33] yeah
[1:41:35] because I have
[1:41:36] in the Harvester
[1:41:38] you know you've all heard 30-second rule
[1:41:42] well you know sometimes during that 30
[1:41:43] seconds you're too busy
[1:41:46] so I extended it to a minute
[1:41:48] and I found out a minute
[1:41:50] when you're hungry enough late in the
[1:41:52] evening still working a minute's not
[1:41:54] long enough I extended it to two and
[1:41:55] then it was to three and then it's
[1:41:57] extended to the time I can finally find
[1:41:59] time to reach down there and pick it up
[1:42:01] and shake the dirt off and I'm still
[1:42:03] going to eat it
[1:42:06] because everything I was eating the
[1:42:07] bread the meat the cheese all come out
[1:42:09] of the earth anyway
[1:42:16] and we saw some of the disciples eat
[1:42:18] bread defile that is to say with
[1:42:20] unwashing hands they found fault for the
[1:42:23] Pharisees and all the Jews except they
[1:42:25] washed their hands off eat not holding
[1:42:28] the tradition of the elders and when
[1:42:30] they come from the market except they
[1:42:31] wash they eat not and many other things
[1:42:34] there be which they have received to
[1:42:36] hold
[1:42:37] amen
[1:42:40] I want to know Saints whether what you
[1:42:42] have today was given you
[1:42:45] to hold
[1:42:48] or it came by Revelation to your soul
[1:42:57] we start a tradition in this church
[1:43:00] Thanksgiving at the halots
[1:43:06] do we hold that that tradition
[1:43:11] or would God come one day and say no
[1:43:13] it's time for that tradition even to die
[1:43:15] because we're not about the tradition
[1:43:18] let me tell you sister Jerry's proposing
[1:43:21] a lot of thanks
[1:43:22] yeah sister cherries into change
[1:43:30] see
[1:43:32] been given to hold as the washing of
[1:43:35] Cups and pots and Brazen vessels and of
[1:43:38] tables
[1:43:39] now this is what worshiping God is like
[1:43:42] Saints we do it just like this and just
[1:43:46] like this and it becomes a powerless
[1:43:48] gospel
[1:43:50] this is how powerless churches are
[1:43:52] created because we give guidance to do
[1:43:56] it because that's how we do it and no
[1:43:58] leadership of the Holy Spirit oh I can
[1:44:01] remember a man one time telling me I
[1:44:03] tell you what I believe the message but
[1:44:05] I couldn't go to one of those churches
[1:44:07] where them people are up in the altar
[1:44:09] crying and slobbering and screaming I
[1:44:11] just couldn't do it it gets on my nerves
[1:44:15] that was a long time ago when I was a
[1:44:17] young Christian I just stood there
[1:44:24] never would have fit in on the day of
[1:44:26] Pentecost would he
[1:44:28] man he'd have got up and walked out
[1:44:30] there and said I I believe I believe in
[1:44:33] the Holy Ghost but I don't believe in
[1:44:35] this
[1:44:36] not realizing that was the Holy Ghost
[1:44:40] see see how careful it is by tradition
[1:44:42] by a teaching by a guideline by
[1:44:45] encouragement to go a certain way to
[1:44:48] uphold a certain standard of dignity
[1:44:54] instead we show Who We Are
[1:44:57] by washing cups and pots and Brazen
[1:45:00] vessels and tables
[1:45:02] you've heard the old phrase
[1:45:04] cleanliness is Next to Godliness
[1:45:08] have you ever seen anybody going to
[1:45:09] Rapture on that one
[1:45:14] no that's not a license to get rid of
[1:45:17] the dishwasher
[1:45:19] huh
[1:45:21] now look at this then the Pharisees and
[1:45:24] scribes ask him why walk not thy
[1:45:26] disciples according to the tradition of
[1:45:28] the elders but eat bread with unwashing
[1:45:31] hands you see my brother and sister they
[1:45:34] were so caught I hope I'm not dragging
[1:45:36] this out too long let me just hurry they
[1:45:38] were so caught up in the tradition their
[1:45:40] description their definition their idea
[1:45:43] of clean
[1:45:45] little Lysol rag
[1:45:49] we're clean
[1:45:51] we're clean spotless
[1:45:53] not a smidge of dust not a cobweb
[1:45:55] nothing
[1:45:56] we're clean
[1:45:58] this is what we were taught this shows
[1:46:01] Who We Are but look at this now
[1:46:03] no I tell you what I'm telling you if
[1:46:06] our Lord Jesus Christ the Apostle Paul
[1:46:08] Peter came back in this day the churches
[1:46:12] would empty out because everybody would
[1:46:13] say that's not my Prophet that's not my
[1:46:16] Apostle that's not my Lord Jesus because
[1:46:19] he wouldn't let's let me just go here
[1:46:21] and he answered and said unto them well
[1:46:23] half Isaiah prophesied of you
[1:46:27] hypocrites
[1:46:30] he didn't even try and soften the blow
[1:46:33] Isaiah says prophesied of you hypocrites
[1:46:39] as it is written this people honoreth me
[1:46:41] with their lips
[1:46:44] but their hearts
[1:46:46] now I'm not going to change the
[1:46:47] scripture but I'm going to change the
[1:46:48] scripture but their hearts have not been
[1:46:51] washed
[1:46:55] you're far from me amen
[1:46:56] amen you're caught up in your own world
[1:46:59] you're caught up in the world what is it
[1:47:01] my brother and sister whatever flavor in
[1:47:03] this world and I'll speak direct this
[1:47:05] morning whatever flavor of the message
[1:47:07] you want is available today people would
[1:47:10] be like this is what I believe fine
[1:47:12] believe that I'm not even going to
[1:47:13] criticize you anymore I'm going to do my
[1:47:15] best just to go on because you see my
[1:47:17] brother and sister it don't fit right
[1:47:19] here here and here and then it don't fit
[1:47:21] in the message here here and here but
[1:47:23] it's what you want to believe believe it
[1:47:25] but as for me in my house we're going to
[1:47:28] serve the Lord and the Lord spoke
[1:47:30] through his word and said this is what I
[1:47:32] want you to follow I laid it out I give
[1:47:34] it to you you can tote it with you
[1:47:36] anywhere you want amen I'm telling you
[1:47:39] my brother and sister I just uh listen
[1:47:42] to a very interesting thing this
[1:47:44] individual was talking about where they
[1:47:46] were working in the Middle East and they
[1:47:48] were not a not a Christian not at all of
[1:47:51] a Arabian type descent or whatever you
[1:47:54] would call that and they were there but
[1:47:56] some man on the job went out of his way
[1:47:58] not even lawful for them to speak when
[1:48:01] uh when American is in another country
[1:48:03] like that to speak of these things but
[1:48:05] the man went out of his way and spoke to
[1:48:07] him and says if you believe and you
[1:48:10] would just receive God will change your
[1:48:12] life and the man said I pondered on I
[1:48:15] pondered on that pondered that and he
[1:48:16] said I started going and started
[1:48:18] secretly reading my Bible and he said in
[1:48:21] seven days
[1:48:23] seven days I found a Christian Church
[1:48:26] there in that tree and asked them to
[1:48:29] baptize me in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:48:31] seven days and we've got people in this
[1:48:34] message that in their tradition have
[1:48:36] been 40 and 50 years and you can't move
[1:48:40] them
[1:48:41] oh come on don't tell me we don't have
[1:48:45] all these same kind of spirits moving
[1:48:49] that are in the land
[1:48:51] this is not too hard is it amen I say
[1:48:55] this only I don't mean it to be strident
[1:48:57] I say this my brother and sister that
[1:48:59] God give us a warning
[1:49:01] kind of like the cartoon of two men
[1:49:03] standing on the side of the road as a
[1:49:06] beware danger ahead and these people in
[1:49:09] a sports car going oh these old scaredy
[1:49:11] cats and then the car goes around the
[1:49:13] corner and the sign says bridge out
[1:49:18] somebody's got to do the warning
[1:49:20] maybe they could have worded it
[1:49:22] different
[1:49:23] like have the bridge outside out where
[1:49:26] they were at but what they spoke was
[1:49:28] true wasn't it danger ahead
[1:49:32] oh Lord help us
[1:49:36] teaching
[1:49:39] how being in vain do they worship me
[1:49:41] teaching doctrines
[1:49:43] for doctrines the Commandments of men
[1:49:46] for laying aside the Commandment of God
[1:49:48] ye hold the tradition of men as the
[1:49:50] washing of pots and cups and many other
[1:49:52] such things you do
[1:49:55] what do you just tell them
[1:49:57] your tradition
[1:49:59] means nothing
[1:50:02] nothing
[1:50:05] you need to find
[1:50:07] Christ
[1:50:09] you need to get in the veil yeah
[1:50:12] in his body
[1:50:17] my let me hurry
[1:50:29] Jesus didn't hold anything back dealing
[1:50:32] with them one man fought cleanliness was
[1:50:37] I'm clean
[1:50:39] you know you have thoughts when you're
[1:50:41] preaching maybe just to go ahead and
[1:50:42] have the communion table out here and
[1:50:43] put a deal on that and I just stand here
[1:50:46] pretty much the whole service maybe my
[1:50:48] sleeves rolled up
[1:50:50] and preach to you
[1:50:53] while I wash my hands over
[1:50:56] and over again
[1:50:59] and then say something radical and
[1:51:01] ridiculous like
[1:51:03] well I lied to a man the other day to
[1:51:06] make some money
[1:51:08] but I washed my hands
[1:51:14] and I did a deal over here that wasn't
[1:51:16] quite right the other day Saints but
[1:51:17] I've washed
[1:51:20] my hands
[1:51:23] and I lied to you Church three months
[1:51:25] ago and none of you caught it but I feel
[1:51:27] compelled to wash
[1:51:31] my hands
[1:51:37] and you'd all backslide for a minute and
[1:51:39] I'd bounce once in the parking lot
[1:51:40] before I made it to the sidewalk
[1:51:43] because that's not who you are
[1:51:47] and that's not
[1:51:49] Who We Are
[1:51:53] it takes another washing it takes
[1:51:57] another washing
[1:52:02] I'll just skip over a couple little
[1:52:03] thoughts I have written here look let's
[1:52:05] just go right here to the marriage of
[1:52:07] the Lamb
[1:52:11] I mean I still have an hour
[1:52:14] so we have to hurry marriage of the Lamb
[1:52:17] Esther perched her heart you guys know
[1:52:19] how much I love Esther
[1:52:21] I'm telling you oh don't take this wrong
[1:52:23] but I'm going to say it anyhow if Esther
[1:52:25] was here I'd be in love with her
[1:52:28] yeah
[1:52:30] not the carnal flesh Esther
[1:52:34] Esther
[1:52:35] the daughter
[1:52:37] of God
[1:52:39] are you with me glad we got that all
[1:52:41] clarified some of your eyeballs sought
[1:52:43] open immediately Bing like whoa what's
[1:52:46] going on here no Esther my sister in
[1:52:49] Christ I would be in love with her
[1:52:53] Esther pursed her heart before God
[1:52:55] walked up with a Meek and humble Spirit
[1:52:57] the church that's going to be the bride
[1:53:00] of Christ now remember Esther refused
[1:53:03] the worldly adornment
[1:53:08] and why would it be so hard I I thank
[1:53:10] the Lord for for The Godly sisters we
[1:53:12] have but why would it be so hard for a
[1:53:16] message of the hour which we say that's
[1:53:18] the revealed word of God and it says I
[1:53:20] would like you sisters to dress a
[1:53:23] certain way why is it that we have such
[1:53:25] a struggle
[1:53:27] it has to be just the devil
[1:53:30] has to be just absolutely just the devil
[1:53:35] because my brother and sister we believe
[1:53:37] the word
[1:53:38] and the words what laid the foundation
[1:53:40] and the guideline so it has to be the
[1:53:43] devil that comes in and says you know
[1:53:45] what we're going to just apply these
[1:53:46] kind of things now this will sound kind
[1:53:48] of I hope you take this with humor on
[1:53:50] the way to church today sister Jerry
[1:53:52] drove me amen thank you sister Jerry
[1:53:55] a little stressed out a little tired
[1:53:59] we come up by the lake at the stop sign
[1:54:03] and here's a car pulled over side the
[1:54:04] road the door opened
[1:54:06] and a lady is
[1:54:08] I assume it was a lady
[1:54:10] leaning inside the car and as we drive
[1:54:12] up there sister Jerry and I I said isn't
[1:54:15] that interesting and all you see in this
[1:54:18] address nice longer dress
[1:54:21] and high heels
[1:54:23] that were so high I think it was the
[1:54:26] tips of her toes that touched the ground
[1:54:29] and I told Jared isn't that inner that
[1:54:31] has to be
[1:54:33] so comfortable
[1:54:40] now if any of you have high heels on
[1:54:42] this morning I want you to listen
[1:54:47] that's an anointing
[1:54:50] because it would take an anointing
[1:54:52] to cause someone to wear a shoe like
[1:54:56] that
[1:55:00] yeah
[1:55:02] so let's call it any of you got some
[1:55:04] things in your closet
[1:55:06] I'm not being I'm not being
[1:55:09] I'm not I'm not I'm not
[1:55:13] if you got those in your closet I want
[1:55:15] you to go and I want you to set them out
[1:55:16] on your bed and I want you to pray over
[1:55:17] them and I want you to wear the pair
[1:55:19] that God leads you to wear
[1:55:22] and if you can come to church and them
[1:55:24] things and say I prayed over and God led
[1:55:26] me to wear those then I'm going to
[1:55:27] resign
[1:55:34] she took the spirit in her heart to go
[1:55:36] before the king and a woman today the
[1:55:39] church that thinks she's going to get in
[1:55:40] because she's got more numbers she's
[1:55:42] best dressed crowd she's got the biggest
[1:55:44] organization the biggest church in the
[1:55:46] city and things like that you'll miss a
[1:55:48] million miles if you're depending on
[1:55:50] that it's a sweet kind
[1:55:53] reverent Spirit to the word of God wash
[1:55:57] by the water of the word and the word in
[1:56:00] you it's a washing amen the church needs
[1:56:04] a washing a Full Gospel washing that's
[1:56:07] right not just a part washing but a Full
[1:56:10] Gospel washing cleaned up made new
[1:56:13] creatures in Christ Jesus Oh I'll tell
[1:56:17] you what my brother and sister uh it's
[1:56:19] there look at this now this really comes
[1:56:21] on this clinches it Jesus bride is not a
[1:56:24] dirty bride he wouldn't have his dirty
[1:56:28] bride if a woman come up to get married
[1:56:31] and she looked like she'd come out of
[1:56:33] the pig pen out there a man that's got
[1:56:34] any dignity about him wouldn't marry her
[1:56:37] he'd make her clean herself up and when
[1:56:39] the Church of Christ comes up to get
[1:56:41] married thinks she's going to be in the
[1:56:43] bride with all the world tagging on to
[1:56:46] her Christ's bride won't be like that
[1:56:50] Hallelujah why not because the preacher
[1:56:53] said don't be like that because the
[1:56:56] spirit that is in her will not allow her
[1:56:59] to be like that something inside of her
[1:57:02] says I want to be Washed by the Water of
[1:57:05] the word I don't want to be washed by
[1:57:07] message as it were my Nazarene or
[1:57:10] Baptist or whatever I want to be washed
[1:57:13] by the word
[1:57:15] oh my brother and sister it's a word
[1:57:17] that changes Our Lives it's a word that
[1:57:20] makes us into the image of Christ
[1:57:22] oh hallelujah hallelujah look at that
[1:57:27] now
[1:57:28] now look
[1:57:30] First John 3 21 we've got to just hustle
[1:57:32] right along here beloved if our heart
[1:57:34] condemn us not then have we confidence
[1:57:36] toward God and whatsoever we ask we
[1:57:40] receive we might we kind of could should
[1:57:42] maybe no it looks to me pretty positive
[1:57:46] here we receive of him because we could
[1:57:50] keep his Commandments and do those
[1:57:53] things which are pleasing in his sight
[1:57:55] and this is his Commandment that we
[1:57:57] should believe on the name of son Jesus
[1:57:59] Christ
[1:58:00] and love one another
[1:58:05] you know Saints for years I've read this
[1:58:08] and I know you'll be able to testify
[1:58:10] I tell you many times as we close the
[1:58:13] service
[1:58:14] love one another
[1:58:18] because this scripture became not real
[1:58:19] to me amen I must stand like a beaconess
[1:58:22] amen love one another they took your
[1:58:25] parking spot love them they took your
[1:58:27] Pew loved them amen they burnt the food
[1:58:31] at the fellowship loved them
[1:58:34] whatever it might be love them
[1:58:37] and the scripture says that love covers
[1:58:39] a multitude of sin and I know that there
[1:58:42] are things in my life that I let go oh
[1:58:45] let me just put it this way there's
[1:58:46] things in my life I let go and they have
[1:58:49] slipped from my memory
[1:58:53] oh if God wanted you to worry about it
[1:58:54] he'd bring it back
[1:58:58] sometimes God says you know what
[1:59:00] I'm just going to let you be aware that
[1:59:02] there were things that slipped
[1:59:06] and I'll cover those for you
[1:59:10] I'll cover what you should have covered
[1:59:13] because that's who I am
[1:59:15] I'm your savior
[1:59:18] I am just beyond the Veil
[1:59:21] you've come into the veil I take care of
[1:59:24] it

[1:59:50] what kind of spirit do I have
[1:59:53] you know I didn't choose to include in
[1:59:55] my mind as well because I'm going to
[1:59:56] preach on it
[1:59:57] there's a whole multitude of quotes the
[1:59:59] prophet of God speaks about
[2:00:01] people
[2:00:04] with a temper
[2:00:05] enough to fight a buzzsaw
[2:00:10] he even talks about him being in church
[2:00:12] and jumping and shouting and praising
[2:00:15] God and speaking in tongues and the next
[2:00:17] morning
[2:00:18] fight a buzzsaw
[2:00:21] that's not Who We Are
[2:00:24] that's not who we are Saints
[2:00:26] amen What Spirit has he given us
[2:00:30] amen he's given us a Holy Spirit
[2:00:33] he hasn't given us a worldly spirit
[2:00:36] you know there's often talk
[2:00:40] go to the ball game
[2:00:43] everybody has the idea that everybody
[2:00:44] immediately goes to the Ball Game
[2:00:46] and starts jumping out of their seat and
[2:00:48] screaming
[2:00:50] you know that's not true
[2:00:52] I've been to a couple ball games in my
[2:00:54] life
[2:00:58] announcers up there
[2:01:00] now who can Mama and everybody over here
[2:01:03] and who is the left louder or the right
[2:01:06] louder is the end feel louder and pretty
[2:01:09] soon people are like
[2:01:12] I thought about trying that at church
[2:01:13] but I didn't quite know how to go about
[2:01:15] it
[2:01:17] hey man this uh well let's see which way
[2:01:19] are we looking I'm going to take it from
[2:01:20] your point of view right side of the
[2:01:22] church has got more amens in them than
[2:01:24] the left side can you prove that for me
[2:01:28] and the left side and say how dare you
[2:01:30] say we don't have amens in US
[2:01:32] and then it'd come and it's chaos
[2:01:38] Jesus didn't come down with a microphone
[2:01:41] and start saying okay everybody that's
[2:01:44] our believer
[2:01:46] let's stand to our feet and let's prove
[2:01:49] it
[2:01:51] but humble quiet Meek Spirit comes down
[2:01:56] and it starts to move
[2:01:58] you know I miss admits might be in the
[2:02:01] kitchen sister doing your dishes might
[2:02:04] be doing that favorite thing
[2:02:06] the wash
[2:02:09] and the Holy Ghost comes down and
[2:02:11] something stirs in the heart
[2:02:13] God maybe reminds you
[2:02:15] when he touched your little baby with a
[2:02:17] fever
[2:02:18] remind you of a circumstance
[2:02:21] maybe a car almost hitting your child
[2:02:28] you want to know a god shaking moment
[2:02:33] I can take you right to the place I'm
[2:02:35] sure Jerry can too
[2:02:37] I was mowing hay I did did a lot of that
[2:02:40] for a living we didn't break it we
[2:02:42] didn't bail it I just mowed Hay all over
[2:02:45] this Valley
[2:02:46] One Day Jared brought me lunch
[2:02:50] we were in South Nampa
[2:02:52] and she's giving me the lunge there
[2:02:55] our son Joel got out of the car was
[2:02:57] disobedient was running around Jerry
[2:02:59] kept telling him get back over here
[2:03:02] and a car was coming
[2:03:04] and turning there's our son on the side
[2:03:06] the road
[2:03:07] I think we both screamed at the same
[2:03:09] time Joel
[2:03:12] but he ran across the road right in
[2:03:14] front of that car
[2:03:19] then he fell down the bar ditch on the
[2:03:21] other side so when the car goes by it's
[2:03:22] not visible
[2:03:28] and you almost die
[2:03:30] on this spot
[2:03:34] the lady slammed on the brake slid to a
[2:03:36] halt jumped out of the car and said oh
[2:03:38] my god I've killed your son
[2:03:41] where is he
[2:03:44] and then our son climbed up out of the
[2:03:46] bar ditch
[2:03:48] we took him over on the other side of
[2:03:50] the road after the car was gone and
[2:03:51] whipped him
[2:03:58] but you see how callous we can get
[2:04:01] oh her son's just being disobedient get
[2:04:04] over here get over here get over here
[2:04:06] get over here I told you get over here
[2:04:08] get over here get over here and the Lord
[2:04:10] said get over here
[2:04:14] and we just run everywhere we want to
[2:04:16] run
[2:04:17] and he says you know what I I'm going to
[2:04:19] take it I'm not going to take a dirty
[2:04:20] bride

[2:04:26] washing today Church come on get washed
[2:04:28] and look how patient God is with us that
[2:04:31] we just go on in life and he's here

[2:04:36] washed
[2:04:37] washed get washed amen don't show up
[2:04:40] there that day
[2:04:42] with even a smudge
[2:04:45] on the Hem of your garment
[2:04:49] get washed
[2:04:54] let me hurry here
[2:04:56] I want to read this last quote to you
[2:04:57] I'm going to skip right to it
[2:05:01] skip over my other thoughts here
[2:05:03] sister Emmy will you come
[2:05:06] brother Sean
[2:05:10] let us hear the cap of all of it
[2:05:14] Zechariah 4 6 is where I'm going to
[2:05:16] close at right here the Bible said not
[2:05:20] by power
[2:05:22] not by might
[2:05:25] but by my spirit saith the Lord
[2:05:29] not by wisdom
[2:05:32] not by knowledge
[2:05:34] not by nomination
[2:05:37] but with my spirit
[2:05:39] I will watch
[2:05:42] now look how the prophet opens this door
[2:05:45] did he change the word
[2:05:47] I don't believe so
[2:05:49] there are some critics that are like he
[2:05:51] quoted the scripture wrong while they
[2:05:54] quote everything else wrong
[2:05:58] by my spirit I will energize
[2:06:02] my word the disciples had it sowed into
[2:06:05] them then the Spirit came to energize
[2:06:08] the word see not by power not by my not
[2:06:11] by wisdom not by understanding not by
[2:06:13] this not by that but by my spirit I will
[2:06:17] energize my word but my spirit saith the
[2:06:20] Lord is the water of the word of faith
[2:06:23] that energizes the word of God and makes
[2:06:27] it work
[2:06:29] oh I'll tell you Saints let's just stand
[2:06:32] here
[2:06:33] amen I'm not making an altar call I'm
[2:06:35] not trying to do that but I just
[2:06:37] encourage you right now maybe just lift
[2:06:40] a heart a hand and say Lord Jesus just
[2:06:42] let the word come and just wash me maybe
[2:06:47] maybe on the back of my as it were maybe
[2:06:49] behind my ear maybe a little something
[2:06:51] here that needs to be cleaned up in my
[2:06:54] life
[2:06:55] Lord just please come
[2:06:57] Wash Me by Your Word because I have a
[2:07:01] harsh desire Lord to be clean
[2:07:03] I have a harsh desire to stand that day
[2:07:06] in your presence and because my heart
[2:07:09] does not condemn me
[2:07:12] I have a confidence
[2:07:15] of boldness
[2:07:17] I kind of skipped over a portion of this
[2:07:19] today because of time Saints but let me
[2:07:21] just say it real quick here when you
[2:07:24] have been completely washed
[2:07:26] you can come with a boldness like you
[2:07:30] have never ever experienced in your life
[2:07:34] and the word of God says that when you
[2:07:36] come boldly he'll give to you the
[2:07:40] desires of your heart you need a child
[2:07:43] saved you need a relationship saved you
[2:07:46] need someone in your family healed you
[2:07:48] need a Deliverance in the family or in
[2:07:51] your own life let the word wash us let
[2:07:55] the world wash us and then Saints we can
[2:07:58] come boldly into his presence and say
[2:08:02] Lord I got a husband that needs saved
[2:08:04] I've got a wife that needs save I got
[2:08:07] children that need saved I need more of
[2:08:09] you Lord but what do we do by this
[2:08:12] washing it takes away the hindrance that
[2:08:15] Satan has
[2:08:17] that keeps our boldness
[2:08:19] from us
[2:08:21] oh Lord I want to be bold
[2:08:26] oh Lord from the depths of my heart
[2:08:28] today I don't mean to be emotional Lord
[2:08:32] but Lord I want to be pulled
[2:08:34] Lord I just ask you
[2:08:37] just come down
[2:08:39] not by the preacher's words Lord but by
[2:08:42] your Holy Spirit just come and wash us
[2:08:46] wash the old bitterness away yes
[2:08:51] years and years of disappointment breeds
[2:08:53] dinner bitterness Wash It Away Lord I
[2:08:57] just ask you Lord I've become weary
[2:09:02] let your Holy Spirit Come just wash that
[2:09:04] away from you
[2:09:05] Lord I don't want to be a weary
[2:09:07] Christian
[2:09:08] I want to be a vibrant on fire
[2:09:12] oh I want to be a weapon in the hands of
[2:09:14] my Lord to live this word
[2:09:18] to vindicate the word of the hour
[2:09:20] through my life that's what I desire
[2:09:23] Lord I just ask you
[2:09:25] Lord come down
[2:09:27] touch each heart
[2:09:30] touching circumstance
[2:09:34] I feel the Holy Spirit moving I feel a
[2:09:36] washing taking place
[2:09:39] oh it's not a public event Saints it's a
[2:09:42] personal
[2:09:43] very private event
[2:09:46] but when God works my brother and sister
[2:09:48] he does his job thoroughly
[2:09:51] Lord we give you Liberty today
[2:09:55] Lord we give you Liberty today come down
[2:09:57] father Lord if it's my elbows so to
[2:10:01] speak Lord then wash me behind my ears

[2:10:39] with a Meek and a contrite spirit
[2:10:43] Lord you know we've preached it many
[2:10:45] times I believe in my heart that Esther
[2:10:49] had a boldness
[2:10:50] because that wasn't just a king
[2:10:55] Saints do you realize that when we just
[2:10:57] look at it like oh that's God
[2:10:59] you're missing it
[2:11:02] he is our husband
[2:11:04] he is our bridegroom
[2:11:07] he is the Lamb that gave us life
[2:11:10] [Music]

[2:11:50] of faith
[2:11:53] I want to say that again put that back
[2:11:55] up again brother Josh

[2:12:00] Hallelujah
[2:12:02] look at this Saints
[2:12:04] not by understanding not by this and not
[2:12:06] by that but by my spirit I will energize

[2:12:12] can someone say Amen now if that word is
[2:12:15] in us and what our prayer is Lord

[2:17:24] he just protected you from the four
[2:17:26] wagon wreck at the intersection

[2:17:33] to get serious enough
[2:17:36] to cry out to him and say Lord I need
[2:17:38] you
[2:17:39] maybe you say life is good brother Paul
[2:17:43] now I'm talking about spiritual life
[2:17:45] but it can be better
[2:17:49] are you bold enough to ask for God to
[2:17:51] come down
[2:17:52] and open your eyes
[2:17:54] like you have never seen him before
[2:17:58] how beautiful
[2:18:00] you know I read a little deal
[2:18:03] maybe this is for just the older married
[2:18:05] couples
[2:18:08] this man was saying you know he said
[2:18:11] my wife and I I believe they had four
[2:18:13] children he said we've had the normal
[2:18:15] struggles
[2:18:16] [Music]
[2:18:17] of Life we've been upset with each other
[2:18:20] we said words we shouldn't have said
[2:18:22] actions
[2:18:27] but he said
[2:18:29] one time an old-time evangelist come
[2:18:31] through our church
[2:18:36] said I challenge you
[2:18:38] to look at your wife
[2:18:40] [Music]
[2:18:42] like you think you look at Jesus
[2:18:46] [Music]
[2:18:47] and he said I caught his meaning I
[2:18:49] caught his understanding
[2:18:50] and he said in the car as we drove home
[2:18:52] that day I looked over
[2:18:55] and I saw the most beautiful woman
[2:18:58] on Earth
[2:19:00] because that's what Jesus
[2:19:03] [Music]
[2:19:08] you can't break
[2:19:10] we are
[2:19:12] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:19:15] never looked at us
[2:19:19] with anything other
[2:19:21] than eyes
[2:19:22] of love
[2:19:25] and I say thank you Lord
[2:19:30] [Music]
[2:19:36] as I look back on this road I travel

[2:22:40] something I spoke to you this morning

[2:22:51] his head to barely stick above the hood
[2:22:52] of a car
[2:22:55] she said when he was at the center
[2:22:58] of my car
[2:23:00] [Music]
[2:23:02] he disappeared
[2:23:06] and I knew I had killed him
[2:23:08] [Music]
[2:23:11] did my son fall in the bar ditch
[2:23:16] or did an angel
[2:23:18] carry
[2:23:19] [Music]
[2:23:21] there I don't imagine at that age
[2:23:25] he had the ability to jump from the
[2:23:28] center of the lane to the barn Edge
