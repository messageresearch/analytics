yesterday and let's focus on the being here that's here right now christ the revealed word let's focus on him i'm just expecting to leave here with more of him that's what we want isn't that right we want to go away from here lord reveal your word to me [Music] we ought to be praying for revelation more than anything else it's god's will god reveal your word keep revealing your word keep opening it to me let me see the word open in my soul amen amen god bless you appreciate those songs brother jason i went right along with this this morning you know god is perfect he does things perfect you know his ways are perfect how many know psalms 18 said god's way perfect it also says and he's made my way perfect it also says he made my way perfect i'll just let you chew on that the rest of the week because that's a tremendous rest when you know where your rest lays he is the word and the word revealed to you is your rest amen and that's the holy spirit in you amen come alive he's living amen my way is made perfect because he is perfect that's my that's my identification you say well brother david who is he is he is my identification praise be to god amen i'd what i have here this morning probably i'm just going to go the way the lord would have me to you know i've always said i have too much i'm not going to say that i'm not going to say that god forgive me for even thinking it because he knows what you need he knows what i need to i just need to release i just god help me let go let go just release myself and i believe i am as far as i know is in his hands i'm expecting him to speak to your hearts this morning i'm expecting him to speak i'm not expecting david to speak i'm expecting to take these vocal cords and speak what david doesn't know about i'm expecting him to speak to you and speak to my heart how many times have i stood up and ministered the word and thought my that was good my that was good my that was good i'm just rejoicing in it see i'm rejoicing in it too amen amen oh it's a wondrous thing it's a wonderful wonderful thing to come before him every day and feed on this living word this living message all the message is living message is jesus christ the same yesterday today forever amen if you'll stand with me i'd like you to turn me in your bibles it's good to be here greetings to those on the internet wish you could be here with us amen because there's a difference between here being here with us than just setting it on the internet but not everybody can make it and we're just happy you made it as far as that goes so we just pray that god will bless you and bless the word to your hearts amen and i'm happy to be here what i've got to speak here is not for everybody well amen it's not for everybody it's for the bride i hope every one of yous bride i trust every one of you are but we know this message was not sent for everybody it was sent for his bride do i know who they are no but i know i'm one of them i know that faith is in me i know that's in my heart by the grace of god you think i've done anything to merit that not a thing no more than abraham did anything to merit but it's an unconditional covenant between me and god hallelujah amen i want to title this this morning the most perfect evidence the most perfect evidence you say well brother david is there a perfect evidence of the holy spirit is there a perfect evidence that you have the holy ghost oh absolutely i've heard the old critics say well there's no such a thing there's no real evidence i beg your pardon there's the most perfect evidence amen amen and the subtitle here is do you know him this question let's ask every one of us individually here do you know him i didn't ask if you know about him everybody knows about him but do you know him this is in a relationship this is a this is a living word relationship this is between you and him do you know him so there's a perfect evidence of whether you know him or not amen amen we're talking about the original life we're talking about the original seed the word he said in exodus 12 i think it's about verse 13 he said when i see the blood i will pass over you what is he seeing today he's not seeing the chemistry he's seeing the life of that blood testifying of that blood that was shed that you are a partaker and you have come through that blood you see brother sister the token recognizes you the token except you are show as shows and you know by that you have been accepted that your faith is his faith that there's not one thing against you when you get the token brother sister there is not one thing all the way back to the very beginning that can be held against you you have the abstract to the title it's one thing to have a title everybody's got a title i'm a message believer yeah i've done this i've spoken tongues i've shouted i prophesy everybody's got a title i belong to this church among that church but what about the abstract to that title i'm a message believer what about the abstract of that title i believe brother branham was the prophet what about the abstract to that message amen it is a must you are not going in a rapture without the token the token has to be there it has to be on display and is the living word made manifest for this hour it's the literal life of christ when i see the life of that blood when i see my own life i will pass over you when i see my fruit in my season being manifested through you amen that's what it is all right i'd like you to turn with me to math malachi 4. and while you're standing and i don't mean to keep you standing but i realize here i've got to take a couple things that the prophet said and i've i have quoted it already but just bear with me brother brown said over and over again to know him is life to know him brother ham said on the message um rising of the sun he said and notice the by the message was it is the rising and then later in the message he said it is he is the sun is up satan doesn't care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine if you miss that life if you miss that like you have all knowledge of mysteries but if you miss that life amen you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good many good people good people doesn't put you in the rapture and i believe in being good i believe the bride will be good amen but you can put your trust in that and never be there there's a lot of good people that are led by the devil there's a lot of good people and i'm not talking about so much out in the world there's a lot of good people in the world outshine a lot of the people call so-called bride that's true in works they can outshine you amen a lot of good people they don't know a thing about the word a lot of good people say they got the word they quote the word they don't know anything about the word amen all right so he doesn't care if you miss that life that's what he's concerned about if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again the baptism of the holy ghost is the new birth amen amen and and we're and but the true baptism of the holy ghost is the new birth on the uh quickening the seed that's in you you cannot only the elect can be born again why because they are the seed of god amen i'm not saying who's elect and who isn't i'm just telling you that only the elect can be so if you've got the pull if you've got the desire if you've got the taste for more of him and wanting him then it shows in your soul then it shows god's got a filter for you to draw life through to quicken that seed amen all right he's so it doesn't matter one thing unless you've been born again brother brown said what a resurrection that was to see jesus no he raised but what a resurrection what is the new birth it's a resurrection amen is that right exactly what it is it's a resurrection from death to life you are a new creature and that creature is jesus christ revealed in you that's who you are and that's who you grow up into amen all right now i was setting over this is on the message god's provide place of worship shreveport 65. i was sitting over there talking to my old friend brother brown while the songs were going on and he said brother branham i've never seen till yesterday what you've been talking about he said if people could just get into what you're speaking about every obstacle would move out of the way just think if he began to see then what are we seeing now is that right think of it what kind of place there's some listen there's a maturity there's a bride and maturity coming forth here amen that's the brother brown said that's exactly right that's right it's exactly right if you could just grasp it could catch it now the promise is to the bride she will all right now i want you to listen to this quote here carefully i know i'm not on keeping you standing forgive me but you're going to sit for a while too so page 27 of christ revealed in his own word and i'm going to read some things out of this this morning church age book different things so bear with me i can only do as i'm led to do all right on paragraph 24 page six of this message i'm sorry 27 today brother braham said today so confused about the evidence of the holy ghost and so forth satan can impersonate any kind of gift that god has got i'm going to read that again satan can impersonate any kind of gift that god has got but he cannot this is what he cannot do he cannot bring the word that word he said that word word by word that's where he failed in the garden of eden and that's where he's always failed that's where them he said on that tape and i'm gonna i'm gonna cover this on the false anointed ones or anointed ones they can be anointed with the spirit speak in tongues dance shout preach the gospel instill the devil you say well brother david that's pretty hard don't you think we could preach on something a little softer this morning no no this is a mystery that had to be opened up in this hour this was laying under those seals amen this opens up to who you are because these two spirits remember and i want you to hold this in mind as we go forth here in this message matthew 24 24 brother brown referred to it as two spirits so close that they would deceive the elect if possible that's how close they are but they're two spirits under the anointing of one spirit they're two spirits one is the spirit of god the other is the spirit of the devil two seeds one is god's seed one is serpency are you with me all right but they're both anointed by the holy spirit they can't live without that holy spirit anointing because that holy spirit anointing brings both to maturity you want to know what day we're in that's why the new birth without the new birth you will not be able to discern those differences and you aren't born again because you shouted because you prophesied because you had feelings and sensations you're born again because the word is a revelation to your heart for this day amen all right i've said a lot already we almost say amen go home all right so let's but so confused about the evidence what the evidence is brother we have a perfect answer we have the message of the seventh angel we are the message of the seventh angel that message didn't go away when he left that message increased he said i must decrease but what i prophesied to you what i've given to you he said has got to increase he must he he must increase he is here today in the bride form who is the son of man revealing himself through her decline why you say why brother david because she's him she's the mystery of god revealed amen complete mystery seventh angel's message the mystery of god would be completed then what are we facing in that completion where what are you facing here you say well i'm facing rapture that's right that's the that's the that's the full capping of this revelation but what are you facing what's the third coming millennium what's the millennium eden there's three comings of christ you know that the third coming is when he walks out with it on the earth is that right in the millennium but the mystery of the seventh seal is the second coming it's his coming that's the mystery remember how brother braham said the seven seal mysteries the coming of the lord amen all right and he said those seven thunders hold that mystery amen you see that's why the bride is such a different person she's a mystic to many people okay i'm getting a little ahead of myself so we'll back up here so i want to read one other thing and i'm going to read the scriptures so just just bear with me on page 327 of the church age book i know the young people been in the church age book soak it up read it reread it read it reread it read it reread it i got a brother in in billings montana right now that just can't get enough of it he's already read it four times i think yeah and he just can't get enough of it and still he just says my goodness the whole he said i he said he he loves he loves the message but he just can't get enough of it he said that thing has opened the words completely open to me what's opened what's opened something's open to him hallelujah amen all right all right in in the page top bottom of page 327 now the messenger of malachi 4. anybody know the messenger of malachi 4. the holy spirit kind of threw one on you didn't i that's right but he he used the prophet it was a prophet with the spirit of elijah is that right all right but the spirit of elijah was none other but the holy spirit is right but he used that nature to minister through to us is that right so we had an elijah in this hour all right so the but the messenger of malachi 4 and revelation 10 7 is going to do two things number one according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts i want to put emphasis the hearts he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers what's those fathers the true pentecostal word-born fathers are you with me turn it back to that original life original word the original seed is what i believe all right to the fathers number two he will reveal the mysteries his message now watch his message he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals seven seals seven amen not just six so the seventh had something it contained that is revealed all right then it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts the hearts the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers only the children's hearts brother brown said will be turned it's only the children who will listen and he refers to it as true seed turn with me in your bibles to malachi 4 as i said verse 5 and 6. behold one of if you should be able to quote this by memory behold i will send you elijah the prophet i will he said i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart i'm going to drop right down here to his day and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with the curse see why did you miss that because john the baptist was part one of verse five or 6 excuse me are you with me all right they see but this message was to turn our hearts back what's then to turn your heart back there had to be something in your heart to turn amen amen that's speaking to every one of us this morning all right turn out to revelation 10. revelations 10. verse 1 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven close with a cloud hmm sounds like something we've witnessed even have pictures picture was taken of him he said clothe with the cloud and a and a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the sun sun who'd we see sun amen his feet as pillars of fire who's he judging who's he going to use fires pillars of fire all right and he had in his hand a little book open not closed open a little book open brother bam said little book was the bride book and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot now you say how can it be it's all the lamb's book no it's a section of the lamb's book is the eternal life section that brother braham said speaks of his bride you are in the lamb's book of life but not everybody written in the land book of life will be bride you i you question that go back to church ages he makes that very clear it's a section that is a section that speaks of his bride only and that's eternal life and those names can never be removed from it he said the land book of life the book of life the record of life those are all the same book but there was a section of that lamb's book of life he said or the book of life that was the bride portion i'll just drop that right there because i'm not my message this morning but just so you hear it amen the message as we said the hour is taking out a bride what's she coming out of she's raptured out of laodicea the rapture's already started for her not the body not this body change but my change has already started to change this body and i am that rapture amen amen all right now he says here going on and he had his hand a little book open set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth and cried with a loud voice a loud voice a loud voice lazarus with a loud voice a loud voice he gave up the ghost as when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write so john was about to write something they said but the scripture said here and a voice from heaven saying to me seal up those things seal up those things which were seven thunders i heard and write them not and brother brahm said he said seal them up where and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and now now notice brother sister notice there was something unwritten in this word here in this bi in this chapter something unwritten unwritten it's what john heard is that right but it's in the word yes it is it's not out of the word but it wasn't written here amen but brother baby said this unwritten word would be revealed at the seventh angel's message amen all right all right now anne and i and swear by him okay that liveth forever and ever who created heaven are the things that are in our in the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer in other words that time is no longer delayed we've come to the end brother brahm said we're here we've arrived we have the sign of the end we're here we've come to the end of time we haven't seen the fulfilling of the end yet but it's here we're in that day we're in that time how may i understand what is being said all right he said that's when it was to take place but in the days of the voice of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god who is the mystery of god revealed so the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants of prophets now i'm going to stop right there in hebrews chapter 12 or chapter four excuse me hebrews chapter four so he's gonna he's coming with a message to turn the heart amen and the and what's been unveiled in those seven thunders would literally turn the hearts of the children amen and it's progressive revelation to revelation from glory to glory he's changing me all right and in hebrews chapter 4 and in verse 12. it seemed like i'm going as slow as possible and i and i don't i there's so much lord help me happy hebrews 4 12. for the word of god here's our rest for the word of god is quick and powerful that word quick and powerful is living and operative the prophet said this that the bride would be the word living and in action living and operative the word is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder a separation god is a segregationist i may know that's true separates truth from error life from darkness light and darkness truth from error he segregates he did from the beginning he still does my mic in and out i don't know what's happening here but but let me bring that back again dividing asunder piercing even to the dividing asunder of what soul and spirit am i losing battery or got battery i don't like these i don't like it in my hand are you with me testing one two eight nine fourteen all right i'll try all right the dividing asunder of soul and spirit of soul and spirit there's a great divide in here something has been divided between the spirit and the soul there's a division between the two he's making a difference here amen now you're a triune being you can be seated i'll let you be seated i'm sorry thank you for standing so long you're a triune being you're made up of body spirit soul is that right three circles how many are familiar with what i'm talking about brother brown used it many times three circles and he referred always back to the little wheel in the middle of the wheel which was the soul but it's a little wheel in the middle of the second wheel if you're if you're centered on christ everything revolves around that center if you're born again everything revolves around that center amen now that's the heart realm that's the soul realm there is a soul realm brother branham referred to it as the third realm all right so now there's a division that this word will discern and divide and separate between the soul the spirit and the joints and it goes right down referring to the same thing and the joints and the marrow morals always inside of the bone it's the life source of the bone it's where the blood cells are are you with me all right and is a discerner oh my watch this and is a discerner of the thought and intent of the heart oh i'm glad for this message aren't you happy for the message all right now psalms chapter 1. so hebrews 4 12 a segregation of separation there's a separation by the word amen there's a separation by the word i mean how many believeth all your heart that what came in this hour was the word so there's a separation it's bringing a separation by the word we can't feel bad about separation because separation if it's god the word doing the separating that's what you want amen all right but the word and i must say this the word will separate all right remember remember as i said remember matthew 24 24. two spirits amen one of those spirits is in your soul and the other one is in the soul not to not the same time that's one or the other are you with me you were born with one or the other there amen because god planted or predestinated at that in your soul that seed are you with me all right some can never be saved some will be saved some can never rise and others will what's determining that not their good works or lack of it but for knowledge predestination amen jacob i loved he saw hate esau was a better man than jacob you would have chose esau he had to turn jacob down because he was a shyster he was a good jew he's a shyster i hope there's no jews here brother brown called them watch out be careful hold your pocketbook see but there's there's elect you also elect israel see but he was an elected one brother brahm said jacob alone had the seed jacob was seed he said so he didn't choose jacob on his works or lack of it before he was born he said i loved him why jacob was himself the word the seed what you are in your soul is who you really are the outside can be an outward expression but it's always what's in the heart tells you who you are and you can tell who you are you can tell by the desire and the taste that you have because you'll always look for a filter to satisfy your taste are you with me but so god's provided a filter to satisfy a holy man's taste to satisfy the taste for the seed of god amen and when you draw through that filter nothing comes through it but the holy spirit because the holy spirit was sent to quicken that seed his seed but if that seed his seed isn't in there then you'll draw for whatever taste or desire you have in your soul you'll draw for that taste you'll dress for that taste you say i won't take all the word you either take all the word or miss the rapture okay let's let's go on i get i'll get on these and i've got to keep moving sometimes i wish the clock was up there but it's right here so sometimes i wish it wasn't all right psalms chapter one and notice there what i'm trying to lead to is something inside of you is working all right brother brown said that a message communion 1965 he said it was already there working he didn't even know about it it was already working and he said i was born again and it was working in me that seed that life that little spot of life he said that was in there all right so something's in the heart and the message of the hour would unveil it and it would be a complete revelation of jesus christ let me just drop this in right now paragraph 52 of this message it's right here the bible is a brother had it on the board last sunday the bible is the complete revelation of jesus christ then what is christ in you what does it make you it makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing amen it makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing amen the revelation of jesus christ in you he would build his church upon the revelation of who he is that's what you're receiving and he said i'll build my church on that revelation of who i am then who i am is who she is and who she is is who i am amen that's right all right so blessed is the man psalm 1 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful be careful there's a lot of scorners around the message i'm sorry to say that but they're scoring anything that even appears to be the word yet they don't even know what they're scoring amen amen we don't want scorning if you don't understand it let it alone and let god take care of it don't go start talking about to other people what you don't like and what this one did and that one did be careful of your discernment because it may be way off the line all right so he said he's and he shall be like a tree no excuse me verse two but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night the bible said he that keeps his mind on him he will give him perfect peace for he trusteth in me amen is that right psalm 26 3 and he shall be like a tree planted predestinated by the rivers of one water water singular that bringeth forth his fruit in his season notice the his here his fruit in his season and versus season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper amen on the message broken cisterns i want to just bring in in remembrance something here also i i'm not going to get through this but i may just and god help me i've said this many times i'll take a part too but i never get around to taking part two because by the time i get a part two it's already gone i've got a ten other messages and so it's part two kind of i know brother chris kind of realized part two kind of you just wonder where's part two that right because the word just keeps opening so quickly my just keeps it again dovetails every bit of it but god help us first pull second pull third pull first pull was what healing what'd it do it's a pull what to do it caught the attention of the people attraction it's an attraction boy they come out by the thousands is that right what they do with jesus on it was jesus's own ministry today what was jesus ministry yesterday same thing oh great prophet my look at healing lepers walk blind seed deaf here they just attracted thousands of people under that healing first pull healing second poll was prophecy now begin to separate a little bit watch these polls now the second poll began to separate uh although not quite so many came out they like to be entertained under the second pull which it wasn't meant for entertaining but they liked to be but they also didn't want to be because it exposed them and the prophecy of the word began to expose them because he began to put these things in order baptism eternal security on and on we could go amen under that second pull prophecy that began to separate even more but watch the third one remember he said the first pull little fish all ran for it then the second pull some other fish but some bigger fish showed up he attracted every one of them but then the third pull was sent to do what catch the big one other words those pulls but when it come to the third pull it was the opening of the word and it separated again now it's separated to what to the word itself amen who's gonna who's gonna walk into that the bride that's what it was for that's what those polls were for so she could take the hook the voice followed those signs are you with me there was a voice brother said wednesday night he said it's not one thing to walk see the light attracted by the light but it's hearing the voice too some saw the light didn't hear the voice see they didn't hear the voice but jesus said my sheep hear my voice my sheep hear my voice so it comes down to this he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches okay and the broken cistern message he said you cannot make a man see the word of god till his nature has been changed and when his natures change from what he is to a son of god and the holy spirit comes into him the holy spirit wrote the word of god and the holy spirit comes into him all right now on page 30 of the church age book he said this and you can you can see this throughout but he mentions this other times but brother graham said the bottom of the page 30 he says this it says in the word that no man can say that jesus christ that jesus is the christ except by the holy ghost i look back up a little bit before that he said if revelation is beyond you look up and seek god for it that is the only way you'll ever going to get it a revelation has to come from god it never comes by human natural endowments but by spiritual endowment you can never you can even memorize the scriptures and though that is wonderful that won't do it it has to be a revelation from god it says in the word that no man can say that jesus is the christ except by the holy ghost you have to receive the you have to receive the holy ghost and then and then only can the spirit give you the revelation that jesus is the christ amen see god he said jesus is the christ or other words jesus is god the anointed one amen all right so he said he said here he says and when his nature has changed from what he is to a son of god and the holy spirit comes into him the holy spirit wrote the word of god today i was talking to with my good friend dr lee vale who is present now and he's quite a theologian and so we usually have some pretty good discussions on scripture he's a very smart man he's very smart he said i said and i asked he asked me one time what i thought about the initial evidence of the holy ghost was it speaking in tongues it's been many years ago and i said no can't see that he said neither do i though i've been taught that he said what would you think would be the evidence and i said now once you listen carefully i said the most perfect evidence i can think of is love and so we got to talking on that and then i thought that sounded pretty good so i just held that if a man's got love watch but one day watch just a progressive message it keeps opening are you with me opening to the prophet opening is that right just the same way it works with you the more you lay in the presence of that son the more it keeps opening it keeps opening what's an opening to do it's taking you right into a body change the rapture rapture's begun either begin a good work and you will perform it is that right who will he will all right now he said he said but one day the lord by vision in a vision straightened me out he said the evidence of the spirit was those who could receive the word so the evidence the evidence the most perfect evidence was those who could receive the word amen neither love now brother sister that's good oh i received the word bless god i received the word but no revelation of it he that has an ear to hear brother abraham said the ear to the hearing is receiving amen all right he said he said here said who can receive the word he said it's neither love nor speaking in tongues it's receiving the word well yes i as i said yeah i believe the word yeah uh-huh listen there's people in this message don't even believe malachi 4 because they're still looking for him to return to bring him the message and he already did it what other messages have come back in return for the message is living right now the message is returned all right it's living right here in pride form jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever there certainly is a return ministry but it was introduced i've introduced you to him i must decrease he must increase it's not another it's him hear ye him not hear ye her hear ye him amen all right so it's receiving the word then dr vale was saying to me that is scriptural and you can look that up you can go to saint john 14 26 it speaks of it i'm saving time here and saint john 16 13 through 15. here's what it says it he says it kind of cuts it here but he said when dr vale said to me that scripture because john in fort john 14 said when he the holy ghost has come upon you he will reveal these things to you that i've taught you and will show you things to come there it is amen now he says so there is so there is so there is the genuine evidence of the holy ghost he has never told me anything wrong yet that that it that that evidence it is the evidence of the holy ghost is he who can believe the word you can receive it it's faith brother sister it's revelation it's the holy spirit in you working identifying himself because remember these things are hid in the scripture you read the letter but there's a thought behind that letter it's not revealed to everybody it's revealed to his bride now you take that word i don't care you take it you take it right give it a right mental attitude and god will bring it to pass is that right yes he will but it's a revelation of it amen that opens it up all right now so he says receiving it and said there's the genuine evidence and of course jesus never said when the holy ghost has come you'll speak with tongues he never said the holy ghost you come you'll do any of those things shout dance and i listen let me just stop here i believe in shouting i believe in dancing i believe in getting happy enough to shout and and and hallelujah and amen and but there's something working down in me that's no evidence that i'm right it's where that word is leading me it's what that word is open to me it's the opening of it it's a revelation amen everything you do everything every little voice everything come by you he said you better check it by the word because if it doesn't lay in that word you better get away from it because it's not the spirit of god if it doesn't lay in the word it's wrong any revelation true revelation the prophet said any true revelation given by god will be vindicated by the word of god amen that's right all right now so we go here keep he said now he said he but he said you you whether you do any of those things it's not the evidence he but the evidence is he'll take these things of mine and show them to you will show you things that is to come now there is the genuine evidence of the holy ghost according to jesus himself so all these sensations and things that people have and live on and the earth's full of it all these sensations and things that people have and live on you can see why they do it see it becomes a denomination or a stagnated pool and they'll never be a denomination they'll never be a denomination made upon the upon there'll never be a denomination made upon the perfect word of god it can't do it because you can't nominate or denominate god can't put him in a box and this is the way it is and this is this this is i've got this and because i got that because i shouted because i felt good because i spoke in tongues because i had something come to me i wrote it out be careful it may not even be the word of god those are spirits but that's not evidence that you've got the holy ghost that's no evidence god's trying to show you the evidence here all right now so and it's not something you work yourself up into make it happen god just fills you with himself opens up himself in you identifying you identifying himself in you well what will i do when i get the holy ghost what will i do well i shout while i do this while you may not do anything but it'll be a reality it'll be a revelation to you you know you've met him amen and watch that word begin to unveil itself unveil itself look at it open up and you may do other things you may do this i don't know what you might do but don't look at what you do or don't do as the evidence that you've got it because it isn't amen i'm not getting too many amens but anyway it's all right i said this this is kind of mystic god makes it that way you know sometimes he doesn't come right out plainly and say it sometimes just to see what you'll do about it i read that quote here a while back brother branham even said he'll make it a little shadowy is he afraid of himself in the bride is he afraid of what he put there she can no more deny that word let that word come to life and light before her she'll receive that there's something in her that has to say amen to that and then watch when you fully obey watch when you obey the word and watch and see if the word doesn't open up it shows you what that is inside pulling you the taste you've got all right now so you can't denominate a perfect word of god and the bible said his word is pure so don't add your symptoms into it and don't add your reasoning and your feelings into it and in your senses into it just leave it alone and believe it to what he said and leave it there and act on it jonah did that he refused to look at the vomit the seaweed he said i'll turn i'll turn instead to the word spoken about from solomon if any will look to this house and believe is that right he took the word peter would have done fine if he hadn't looked the waves if he had just stayed with the word you can't mix it the words pure you can't mix it it's perfect see our human language of perfect always leaves a little spot for imperfection but the word perfect in the bible is complete and there's nothing added to her taken from it it's perfect and when it says it's pure there's nothing as pure as that you can't drop something into the into the light and say well i have all light now you can't put a shadow to it this is a message god is light and they that are in him amen this then is the message god is light and in him is no darkness all right now the reason it is you get a bunch of men that can who who can believe the word let them start an organization the first thing you know in a year's time there's a bunch of rickies in there that you couldn't do nothing with in a bunch listen you see it we see it i'm not talking about the world i'm talking about among the message this matthew 24 24 isn't out here in the world anymore it's right here on those that proclaim the message but i'm telling you the evidence he's telling you the lord's trying to show you the evidence that divides the difference of it here he's showing you who you are he's taking you from just a spirit walk to a soul revelation of his word in your soul i haven't even got down here to meet what i want to say quite yet anyway so you you've been a year by the rickies get into it they got they got a hold you can't do nothing about it it's god's system it isn't it he said it's not god's system excuse me it isn't so we know that the thing is out it becomes a cistern becomes a place where each one will compromise on this and that and the other to get members in there or let people come in so they've had to provide a filter for their taste that's why you see nudity coming in it shouldn't even come around the message i know i i know you don't like to hear that but i'll tell you what you put a holy god inside of you you won't dress so man attract to you and show your body that sounds very brazen but it ought to be brazen you need to understand the holy god won't do that and a holy husband this walking in the light of the word will recognize it and discern it and a holy woman that has the holy ghost in her won't do that it's not something you work up into it's a life it's a life not a put on not an outward show it's got to come from your heart people can act ever so so pious and never have a stitcher revelation of the word and go to bring in the word and they raise up against it what are they raising up against see all right so i believe the message was son of god i believe it's for the going home of the bride i think i i want i want more of him every day i can't get enough of this message it's my life it's my soul it's everything that i am it's tied right here it becomes alive it becomes living it's not a it's not a dead letter it brings this word to life it puts life puts life in me it's called me it's brought something to life it's it's what it what did it do it opened the word in me it showed me i was always was eternal in him and it showed me that i am eternal life i am the resurrection and the life not the body not the outward man this is dying man but that inside soul is risen that inside soul is the word living and that living word right there is transforming me and changing me amen it's eternal life that's the record that i'm under this record i have what about you this morning what about you what about you young people what about you you say i've given my heart to the lord and baptized what about the holy ghost why are you stopping go on and get the holy ghost it's for you don't just stop there go on and get it what'd you come to him for what you repent for you know i said the promise says you shall receive it don't let the devil take it from you don't let him steal it away go to god and say this is my property you gave it to me i come on the basis of your word amen i want the holy ghost or don't live anymore that's how desperate you got to get right i'm not saying this this morning to down anybody i'm putting this out to make the bride realize who she is and where she's standing she's sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus she's up there in the realm of where he said she would be she is him and he is her amen it's it's it's a it's to raise you to a higher plane it says you discern the differences here these differences of these spirits are all oh they're so kind and oh they're so loving be careful what you call love because love can be impersonated boy that was a good one i just read it it wasn't love that wasn't the perfect evidence you want more all right listen he said you can't love with your body you love with your spirit spirit little spirit i'm getting a little bit ahead of myself right here because there's a lot i want to read about that first and second realm and third realm all right i haven't got there yet i probably won't because the time flying but i maybe touch here watch he said the holy spirit can fall upon a man the holy spirit can fall upon a man in his spirit but his soul is the germ that germa is it's either going to be the word or isn't the word he's talking to believers so the germ is the word he said all right then he said i don't care how much you preach and how well you do this and how much you love that's one of the inlets to the spirit remember five inlets to the spirit one of them is love affection love filio is conditional all right watch what he says you can't love with your body you love with your spirit that's one of the inlets you can love and even love god and still not be right amen but there is an action of the holy ghost called charity the holy ghost is love now see how close the two are you can have that holy ghost right there anointing your spirit but what's in the soul he said well i have all the works i well i believe the word i have the books i have i have this and well how come you're dressing the way you are and how come you don't discern the differences what's happening to your discernment of what you're hanging around and who's influencing you oh you're being influenced but they're so kind and they can shout they have miracles they can do signs and wonders i believe every bit of that i'm not making fun of that i believe i believe that absolutely follows the true believer but you can have that and not have that germ inside of you you're not going in a rapture it comes to receiving the word it comes down to what the word has to be revealed to you it's the god's own working of revelation he reveals himself he reveals the word for the hour what is the fruit that god's requiring today what what makes what makes those faults anointed there see you say their faults anointed now be careful when you say that the anointing isn't false they are false because they're not the word they're not the seed of god but the anointing isn't false but their anointing is the holy spirit how many has ever read annoyed once the end time or knoweth it not and this message right here man brother branham especially over and over and over and over again the later on the years that he preached he got into that more and more and more almost every message he was showing you the difference what was it dude dividing asunder because he said those spirits will be that close because they're both anointed with the genuine holy ghost and these signs and wonders prophesy cast out devils they'll come to him in that day haven't we prophesied in your name haven't we cast out devils in your name and he said i won't even i don't even know you depart for me i don't know you you weren't mine to begin with but yeah you you count you you you were contented on the fact that you could shout you could you could say this you could do that you could get up you could be anointed you could see visions or even speak in tongues and even prophesy amen and you still don't know him how do you know him you're his seed it has to come through the word but watch how these two things are so close down here you say that scares us brother david i'm not trying to scare you but it ought to put a desperation in your heart that you want to know that you know that you know that you are him that you're a part of him that you're sure of where you're standing and you have a right to be sure god's expecting you to go to his word and find out god reveal this word to me open it to me lord reveal it let it be more than just a letter let it become reality let it become a reality more than just a word let it be a reality to me let it become in me let it become my life my living let it be the original life you see that's what the devil doesn't want you to get he can he can impersonate any one of those gifts he can be he can be he can be in a person's soul that devil working down there just like judas and cast out devils i didn't hear any men much on that that's what the word said but but he couldn't go to pentecost to receive the life of that word you say i've got the life of the word because i shouted and i danced i spoke in tongue the holy spirit came on me and prophesied how come your prophecy's off the word then how come it doesn't dovetail with the word and even could dovetail with the word and you could prophesy according to the word well see there i've got the holy ghost no you don't that's no evidence now that's brought it right down flat didn't it what is the evidence revealing of the word for the season to you it's the opening of the word to you the fruit is the fruit of the season the prophet said brother brahms said last sunday we were going on those cycles about how the five senses on the outer realm the inlet five senses see taste feel smell here on the outer realm the inlet five senses to the body there's only one way you can get into the body that's those five senses see taste feel smell here he said there's no other way to contact the body on the inside of that man is called spirit you are spirit man all right he said in the inside that man is called spirit and he said and and and el he has also five senses that contact the spirit he said think thought love conscience so forth now you could read them right out imagination reasoning memory conscious affection is that right five senses all right now you he says now you can't think with your body you think with your mind that's spirit realm and in there he said and in there where in that spirit is where too many christians only stop be sanctified i don't drink i don't smoke i feel good i can shout i'm good to my parents i'm good to this i'm good to that i keep all the commandments but the one thing i'm lacking all right now he said he said you can he said to be anointed they can be anointed with the same holy spirit now in there too many christians only stop and they just take like the corn in the field and the corn in the field and the weed in the field two seeds they can be anointed with the same holy spirit that the real believer is anointed with but down on the inside of that that next realm the third realm is the soul right and that's predestinated by god there is where the real sea germ lays is in there that's why brother branham said you could have the holy ghost the baptism even on your spirit but it never it could fall on you it could come right fall on you baptized but if that seed germ is laying in that soul there will never be a birth of the word amen but it'll be it'll it'll bring forth it'll bring that whatever it is in the soul to manifestation and you'll be and you'll be very religious go on do miracle signs and wonders but never able to receive the word never able to see the word for your season and your time yeah that's close isn't it that's close that's how those two spirits are so close amen they come from two different seeds but they're that close because the rain and the sun fell on both is that right hebrews 6 matthew 5 the rain falls on the just the unjust now i'm going to have to skip a lot here and i want to go to one place and then i'm going to have to close we'll come back with this is that all right i just i can't there's things in the church age books that i've got to get to and i can't do it this morning but i want to give this to you see so confused he said i'm the baptist see see on the evidence and remember if i take a cup of water cut it open graft into the heart of a wheat and put it in there bury it now watch this is this is good because this is exactly what's the bride you say you look at old brother david out here you might look at old jacob and he was an old cuckleberg but one day jacob met god and there was there was a quickened word down inside of him and jacob was changed yet he looked like jacob that looked like the badger that was looked like the huckleberry but the life of the culkeber wasn't there anymore amen oh it still worked in his flesh i'm sure he got upset sometimes and but what changed down in the germ where's that inside of the inside what's that little holiest of holies in there what's laying inside of there determines who you are amen what can it receive can it receive by revelation can it receive can it hear the word for the season an hour are you feeding on this word and my it just keeps opening opening and you say well that's just ministry that's not just ministry brother sister that's you amen it just keeps opening and you just can't get enough of it and tomorrow there's more and the next day there's more and there's more and there's more and there's more he said lord i can't hardly take any more of this my body's got to give way oh you say brother david that's just a story no it isn't a story that's the truth and we're very close and i'm praying a message like this because these things brother braham said must be preached on it's what he said the very thing i'm talking about this morning he said these things must be preached on because the devil we're going through trouble sometimes where and we see it down here the things come completely insane we're right on the edge of it you see it you see now israel's in an uproar they can't even get leadership back there anymore they've had four elections they can't even find a leader god's saying i'm your leader but what's happening it's opening the door for rome to step in where are we at where are see how close those two spirits but i'm talking to the bride this morning what's in your soul what's been what's what's dividing here what's god showing you he's showing you who you are he's opening the window to that seventh seal that's been open he's trying to get you to see the seal's been tore back it's that little rock underneath the rock brother brown said it was the rock beneath the rock that's not my quote that's his he said that's what's that's what's unveiled and he said i had to go west to get the revelation of that what was written there was unwritten word but i had to go to rail i had to go west to get the revelation and bring it back and when i saw the seventh seal opened it went to those thunders and brother branham said see the seventh seal was what jesus said he didn't know but brother branham said when he when the book of revelations was written when he come to his complete revelation of himself that was no more a mystery amen it was unveiled so he said then but what's he say brother david what would we don't know we don't know the day or the moment of our body change but we see his coming what's it consummated in appearing in the air there's something happening in the bride that's maturing they're laying in the presence of the sun ripening the next thing left is a meeting in the air but he had to come to unite with his bride because there had to be a spiritual uniting now that's a lot of statement it's one small lump there but i still want to get into some of that here but i but lord help us let me just get into one thing will you bear with me about 15 more minutes let me just get into one thing here i'm not looking for an answer i'm just asking in the message church age book i mean paragraph or page it's about page 166 i think it is let me just say bring something that brother brown said here there's a lot more to go there's a lot more now he's referring to first corinthians 12 7 let's go over there just a minute first corinthians 12 7. i'm just happy for the mysteries have been opened these things are all loose ended and god by his grace has just taken these things and opened them right up how many know as you walk with god things are getting clearer and clearer and all the time more personal more personal more personal more personal a personal revelation all right then in first corinthians 12 7 he says but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all watch what he says here he reads that scripture and then he says now comes now comes this very good question why isn't the manifestation and evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost because you surely could not manifest the holy ghost he says speaking of what somebody else said because surely you couldn't manifest the holy ghost unless you were you truly were spirit-filled brother bam says now i wish i could say that is right because i don't like to hurt people or walk on their doctrine but i wouldn't be a true servant of god if i didn't tell you the whole counsel of god that is right is it not just let us take a look at look at balaam he was religious he worshipped god he understood the proper method of sacrificing and approach unto god but he was not a true seed prophet for he took the wages of unrighteousness and worst of all he led the children of god into sins of fornication and idolatry i could spend a lot of time right there but we won't all right yet who would dare to deny that the spirit of god manifested through him in one of the most beautiful portions of absolute accurate prophecy the world has ever seen but he never had the holy ghost okay now then what do you think of caiaphas the high priest the bible said he prophesied the kind of death the lord would die we all know there's no record of him being a spirit-filled and spirit-led man as dear old simeon or sweet saint called anna yet he had a genuine manifestation of the holy ghost we can't deny that so where is manifestation as an evidence it isn't there see how fine the line it comes down to see why we needed the word to come into full unveiling a complete revelation today god thank god for sending us his word through a prophet because we had still been in the we've still been doing what we thought was right every man doing what they think is right there had to be some absolute come forth vindicated by god that had the word of god for the age perfectly vindicated if you still got questions about whether the message is right you get down before god desperately all right so where is the manifestation of it evidence it isn't as evidence it isn't there if you truly if you are true watch what he says if you are truly filled with the spirit of god you will have the evidence of the word in your life all right let me and then he goes on and he talks about he begins to talk about what he meant in in in was it not chautauqua indiana um where he met the pentecostal people in his earlier years was it chautauqua i think it was the chautauqua anyway no it doesn't sound right anyway in indiana you know what he's referring to he saw the manifestation holy holy spirit one would say one would speak the other would prophesy misha walker that's it that sounds similar yeah misha walker remember he talking about that okay i won't read all that one he saw was a real hypocrite both prophesying both speaking in tongues and be right all right and he saw and and and both manifesting and both were manifesting the spirit in gifts right all right and i sought god for the answer and he went to his you know he went to where his cave was and he read hebrews 6 4-9 it's impossible those were once enlightened have tasted the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost now that ought to tell you right there see they tasted but no revelation they had a taste they come and partook of it are you with me they could be anointed in their spirit the holy ghost could fall right in their spirit amen but if that seed germs not in that soul there's nothing there's nothing of the word to quicken there so they don't have the word in their life they have manifestation that's the difference now watch and he said here he says now so it's impossible for those lightened they shall fall away to renew themselves again to repentance seeing they crucify themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh off upon it bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from god but that which beareth thorns and briars is rejected and nigh into cursing see watch now we're in the we're in the day now of maturity these things this is harvest time amen it takes the holy spirit to recognize that wild wheat that's why you see many people in the sad because there's many people in the message still flirting around with wild wheat because they have manifestation of the spirit in their life but they're a denominational hybrid you say why can't they discern that why can't they see that why can't they see that that's wrong that thing is leading them down the wrong path and they're flirting and press and pressing it to everybody else and it's bringing things into an assembly that fights the true word of god brother sister i'm not just speaking thing i know what i'm saying and it fights that why because there's no discernment there of what's right and what isn't why because the holy ghost has to be there where in the soul the control room in the soul because your spirit can be anointed and it anoints the body to do these things but what's in that soul is going to control the whole thing i hope that left you here this is this i believe the bride knows what i'm talking about it's just here it's an encouragement to you it's not to discourage you it's trying to bring a desperation to you young people that have such a burning desire for more of god then get down to business with him get in dude everything you know that he said to do and now say lord and come to him on the basis of the word and now you said you would fill me if i've been i know who's filled and who isn't but don't stop at sanctification don't stop there go on have you received the holy ghost since you believed amen have you received the holy ghost since you believe i know what it is as a young person to receive the holy ghost it's kept me for 60 plus years and it hasn't stopped it just gets clearer and clearer and clearer and more revealed all the time why because there was a thirst and a hunger for god inside of me i knew there was a true baptism of the holy spirit and when that happened and i took the steps of the word then the word began to open to me then the word began to be revealed to me i'm a living testimony of that i know that's true you say well that's just deep it's too deep the prophet said with the bible said with the deep things of god we should feed upon it's hid from the wise and prudent and revealed to babes that could receive it don't pass it off as just something well it's just too deep i don't need that be careful let's go on a little further i'm i'm past my time now am i right at the time now let's let's i want to get down to a point here so they so he's telling that story he comes down and he saw and he saw in a vision how why man in white had gone forth sowing seed then a man in black came stealthily sowing some more seed amongst the man in white had sown now we've had that same thing happen today we've had the sowing of the son of man sowed his word is that right got to the bride first then we've had this stealthful man coming in behind them through ministry the man the spirit it's the spirit brother sister i've had nothing against nobody it's a spirit working come right behind that and sowed oh i still believe the message praise god i believe the message and some of those men don't even believe the message anymore what's happened no revelation wrong seed couldn't well they could preach like a house of fire a lot better preachers than what i am that's for sure amen but they couldn't receive the truth for the hour of the day they couldn't see it how can you be in the word a part of the word and deny the word it's impossible you can't be in the word himself and deny the word he can't have the revelation of himself laying in your soul oh you might have a feel-good experience i'm talking about the word revealed something you not hope you got you know you have what i'm telling you this morning is not i hope i've got it right it you know you've got it you look for a knowing not to say well if i do this if i do that i've got it i'm trying god's trying to make it very clear to you where the evidence is he that has an ear i haven't even got to john 8 you're not of god because you don't hear my word think of that i can't go there i'm too late you pray for me if i can get back with this i will but you know what dig in the word won't you just start digging it's all laying right there go to the message start reading the scriptures go to what the prophet refers to open the word ask god for revelation ask god to fill you every day daily fill you and refill you revelation upon revelation upon revelation that's a work of the holy ghost ask him to open the word to you open what's in your heart he said a message for what purpose to unveil the mystery in your heart bride he would turn the heart christ the mystery of god revealed christ in you the mystery the finish mystery the complete mystery of adam the complete mystery of the second adam the full revelation of himself amen amen so he saw that happen and he saw that he saw the the little plants that uh the skies turned the brass and all the plants began to droop and die and i and i heard the wheat life i heard though excuse me the wheat lift their heads and cried to god for rain the tares also lift their voices and pleaded for rain and the skies darkened and the rain came and again the wheat now full of strength lift their voices and cried in adoration praise the lord and to my wonderment i i heard the revived tares also look up and say hallelujah oh there's so much more to say but the word in your life i'm not against saying hallelujah i love to say hallelujah something in you that'll say amen but if that's all you've got and all you're relying upon it's got to be the word living got to be the word living it's got to be a birth of the word there what a resurrection this is amen all right and he said they write they cried hallelujah then i knew the truth of the camp meeting see and the evident manifestation of spiritual gifts in a mixed audience all became wonderfully clear the sore in white was the lord the sower in black was the devil the world was the field the seeds were people elect and reprobate both partook of the same nourishment water and sun both prayed both received help from god and let me say this both believe the message or claim to amen one went off a little bit here because he can't take it word by word watch what he said satan can't remember satan can impersonate but he cannot there's one thing he cannot impersonate that's that third poll because he can't receive it he said he can't get it it's kept from him and he can't place that word by word or the original word and he can't do that it'd be an original seed and he's not the seed you see how close it is all right but it's not going to deceive the elected why because she is the word she's the word open she's the word revealed that's what the seven seals were sent to to do seal her away what are the opening little seven seals revealing christ are who are those seven seals christ who's the revealing of what is the revealing of the seals then christ amen all right they both took partook of the same nourishment water and son both prayed both received help from god for he maketh his son to and don't you ever judge your life by how many miracles and signs and wonders you can do how many of us knew prophet said that don't ever judge your life by that how many devils you can cast out he said there's people that will pray there are places to pray others cast out devils sister come to him one time and said i can't i just wish brother brother brahma cast out david said that isn't your place to cast the devil out your place was to pray others were casting them out so you can't put confidence in that and yet i believe every bit of that you know i do well i believe in casting out a devil i've seen many devils cast out just yesterday afternoon one was cast out over the phone one that morning yesterday morning another one's cast out that's the authority of the word i've given that to you but just because you have that you see there's more to it i'm not diminishing that please understand me that's good i'm trying to show you the evidence of being filled with the holy ghost you can be anointed to do that there's only one thing that can cast out a devil that's god the holy spirit does it that's why the manifestation of the holy spirit is with all prophet with all all are profited by it but it's not the evidence i just read it to you all right okay and those gifts should be working in an assembly absolutely but where's the true evidence slay the seeds were people okay and though they both had the same wonderful blessing both had the same wonderful manifestations there was still that one great difference anybody tell me what it was they were of different seed that's the difference right there and that's not a thing you can do about that nor i so there's nothing i can boast it will look at what i got no way we're identifying the seed of god and the seed of the serpent and the seed of the devils being also exposed that's what the seals did all right the opening i should say of them revealing here was the answer matthew 7 21-23 not everyone that saith me lord lord shall enter the kingdom of god or heaven but he that doeth the will of my father doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied my name in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done wonderful many wonderful works and then i'll profess them i never knew you depart for me you worker of iniquity jesus does not deny they did the mighty works that only the holy ghost can accomplish by the way of men but he did deny ever knowing them these weren't backsliders he said these were wicked they weren't backsliders these were wicked unregenerate reprobates that were the seed of satan and and there it is you can't claim the manifestation of the evidence of being spirit born and spirit-filled no sir i will admit that the true manifestation of the evidence of the holy spirit doing mighty acts is is doing mighty acts but it is not the evidence of the individual being spirit filled even though the individual has an abundance of those manifestations the evidence of receiving the holy ghost today is just the same as it was back in the day of our lord it is receiving the word of truth for the day in which you live jesus never did stress the importance of works as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word the works would follow how do you get the word he reveals it amen anointed one's the end time these trees the true vine and the false fine you've heard me preach on that from years ago how they growed up together brought them in in individuals and showed that from cain and abel the two vines that met in an altar both of them religious both of them anointed both of them desiring life and worshipping the same god and one was rejected and the other received and the only way that one that was received could have done anything different from his brother it was revealed to him for the bible said by faith hebrews 11 chapter by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than that of cain which god testified he was righteous jesus said the spirit jesus said the spiritual revelation of who he was what does who does man say i the son of man am peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god blessed art thou simon son of jonas flesh and blood never revealed this to you my father which is in heaven has revealed it has revealed it upon this revelation a rock i'll build my church what is the true revelation of the word there is the vine again abel there is the true vine again able by faith you said it wasn't revelation the prophet says what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of god so by revelation and the churches don't even believe in spiritual revelation they believe in a dogmatic teaching of some system by revelation abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than that of cain which god testified he was righteous and i hope you see that where are we living see the hour he said i talked to a gentleman not long ago christian scholar gentleman he said mr branham we refuse all revelation i said then you have to refuse jesus christ for he is the revelation of god god revealed in human flesh unless you see it you're lost brother braham said when you see the word made flesh you're seeing light all right he said except you believe that i am he you will die in your sins amen he is the revelation of god the spirit of god revealed in human form if you can't believe that you're lost you put him a third person second person or any other person besides god your loss except you believe that i am he you will die in your sins a revelation no wonder they couldn't see him see him no man can come to me except my father draws him that's revelation 6 37 44 and all the father has given me in the roots will come to me you get it oh how we should love him adore him praise him see the fruit of the spirit in the last days the bride tree ripening in the top of time amen all right oh so much more i'd like to get to let's stand together i can't i'd be here another hour or better can't do it oh i can no i can't he can if i never get back to this i pray that you will dig if you haven't heard knowing one's the end time in a while go listen to it if you haven't heard knoweth it not go listen to it if you haven't heard christ is the christ is complete oh no christ yeah revealed his own word go hear it in fact our pastor said go listen to it there's on and on there's many many messages he preached that same thing over and over again bringing you down dividing asunder showing the difference showing what the evidence is amen having an ear to hear the word the ability is given by god it's not you see and it's only revealed to a special class of people i had the quote here on that and that special class of people is those that have the ability given of god to hear their word or hear receive it and then prophet says right there they receive it by revelation it's revealed to them they have prophetic insight that's revealed to them see the evidence it's the revelation of the word in you amen that's the holy ghost [Music] i'd like to sing three songs if i could please come back to this later lord willing later this afternoon be fine i'm just kidding but you know the bible said that god is in the midst of her she can't be moved she just
