[34:36] the witnesses out here
[34:39] can be for you or against you
[34:43] i'm really not
[34:44] so concerned
[34:46] about what they will say against me
[34:51] what i'm concerned about is what they'll
[34:53] say for me
[34:54] because you see if the critic
[34:57] is the only one that's correct
[35:00] we're in trouble
[35:03] if all there is
[35:05] is
[35:06] testimony of failure and that's why i
[35:08] brought up david if if there was just we
[35:10] can go through the bible and some people
[35:12] get a conclusion uh my david
[35:15] you know god honored that and solomon
[35:17] and all this but what a horrible thing
[35:19] he did and forget all the things that
[35:21] god did through david
[35:24] use david 4 and what he expressed
[35:28] so if it's all about the critics we're
[35:30] in trouble what i'm desiring today is to
[35:32] know
[35:33] what will be said
[35:35] in my defense
[35:37] hallelujah
[35:38] let's turn in joshua 24.
[35:41] now saints um my very first witness uh
[35:45] that i spoke to you on
[35:47] part one i guess we would call it was
[35:49] also out of joshua 24.
[35:51] and as i felt led to revisit this i had
[35:55] something that leaped out at me and and
[35:57] uh i i found it kind of marvelous in a
[36:01] way and uh to to catch this and how it
[36:05] spoke to my heart and i'm not gonna try
[36:08] tonight to uh make all kinds of
[36:10] spiritual connections to say oh this
[36:13] must mean this and this must mean this
[36:15] and this must mean this but i will
[36:18] express to you tonight as i read this
[36:21] that there are many scriptures that
[36:23] support ideas and and things that were
[36:26] there and i'm just going to put them out
[36:27] and you ponder them and you apply how
[36:30] you feel to apply i just want to take a
[36:33] moment to express how it spoke to my
[36:36] heart amen
[36:38] joshua 24 21
[36:41] and the people said unto joshua nay but
[36:45] we will serve the lord and joshua said
[36:48] unto the people
[36:49] ye are witnesses
[36:51] against yourselves that you have chosen
[36:55] the lord
[36:56] to serve him and they said
[36:59] we are witnesses are we witnesses
[37:01] tonight
[37:03] now therefore put away said he the
[37:05] strange gods which are among you
[37:07] and incline your heart unto the lord god
[37:10] of israel
[37:11] and the people said unto joshua the lord
[37:13] our god we will serve and his voice will
[37:16] we obey
[37:18] so joshua made a covenant with the
[37:20] people that day and set them a statute
[37:24] and an ordinance in shell
[37:26] and joshua wrote these words in the book
[37:28] of the law of god and took a great stone
[37:32] and set it up there under an oak that
[37:36] was by the sanctuary
[37:38] of the lord
[37:39] now my brother and sister we stopped
[37:41] right there as it is on the page right
[37:43] here we stopped right there we'd say
[37:45] that's interesting he took a a rock
[37:48] and he put it there under the oak
[37:51] next door to the sanctuary but now as we
[37:54] step into verse 27 look at this
[37:57] and joshua said unto all the people
[38:01] behold this stone
[38:03] shall be a witness
[38:05] unto us
[38:07] for it hath heard
[38:09] all the words of the lord which he spake
[38:12] unto us and it shall be therefore a
[38:15] witness unto you lest ye deny your god
[38:19] so joshua let the people depart every
[38:21] man unto
[38:23] his inheritance
[38:25] heavenly father we just ask for your
[38:27] blessings tonight lord be with the
[38:28] saints the prayer request lord with each
[38:31] and every one our children
[38:33] father as we look in the world today
[38:36] father we just see all these staggering
[38:38] statistics father of what is happening
[38:41] to our society
[38:42] but father there is an inheritance and
[38:45] joshua released
[38:48] the people
[38:50] and let them go into their inheritance
[38:53] father tonight
[38:54] i pray lord we'll catch the revelation
[38:57] of what our inheritance is not only in
[38:59] the word of god but also in the family
[39:03] father we ask you to bless this evening
[39:06] this time together in your name amen you
[39:08] may be seated
[39:15] now i don't want to
[39:17] have a negative vein to follow tonight
[39:19] but it strikes me
[39:21] that through the years my brother and
[39:22] sister how many people we have
[39:24] fellowshipped with we have traveled in
[39:27] this journey with that said we would
[39:29] serve the lord but yet they're not
[39:31] serving him today and so we realized to
[39:34] say this just in the framework of
[39:36] conversation or something to speak out
[39:38] to feel like we belong have you ever
[39:41] done that i i know there was a time in
[39:43] my life that there'd be times i
[39:45] disagreed with things but yet i i felt
[39:48] compelled to just kind of go along with
[39:50] it but you know coming maybe for me i
[39:53] won't speak for you but i pray that this
[39:56] isn't for our young people to have to
[39:57] wait till they're old people to uh uh
[39:59] become more settled in what they stand
[40:02] for but you know come to a time that's
[40:05] like no sorry i don't agree with you
[40:07] now if people get offended over that my
[40:09] brother and sister there's not much you
[40:11] can do for them but the truth is
[40:14] the truth will offend
[40:16] the unbeliever
[40:18] so many people are offended at the very
[40:21] gospel they say they believe
[40:24] you'll have people my brother and sister
[40:26] that go to church and they say praise
[40:28] the lord i believe the bible and then go
[40:30] right out and live absolutely contrary
[40:32] to it we realize that this is more of an
[40:35] intellectual type understanding of the
[40:37] word of god that they grasp the concept
[40:40] well you know i listen to brother chris
[40:42] talk about writing code and i listen to
[40:44] brother alex talking about programming
[40:46] all these things and and uh brother
[40:49] isaac talking about what he does and and
[40:52] you know and i i intellectually grasp
[40:54] that i just hope your life never depends
[40:56] on me applying it
[40:59] because you see i can grasp what these
[41:01] things are but i could not come to the
[41:04] first base of applying it and i think
[41:07] sometimes this is what happens in the
[41:09] churches people grasp the concept but
[41:12] we're going to get from concept to the
[41:14] actual application because an app my
[41:17] brother and sister i say this kind of
[41:19] humorous because i tried to use an app
[41:22] the other day it was like for this and
[41:24] this apply this uh use this app and and
[41:27] uh so i click on the thing and it does
[41:29] its whole thing and says um this app
[41:32] is under construction
[41:36] so
[41:37] i've thinking about what brother jose
[41:39] said i'm under construction i won't be
[41:40] upset with them but don't tell me to use
[41:43] something that's not usable
[41:45] and i want this gospel of jesus christ
[41:48] as we are here as brothers and sisters
[41:50] together in fellowship and we are
[41:52] hearing the word preached and we are
[41:54] preaching the word that we would have
[41:57] something that is applicable that we can
[41:59] take and put to work tonight we don't
[42:02] have to wait for something else to
[42:04] happen to complete this but the word
[42:06] would be usable as it were tonight amen
[42:10] so we look here in and it just strikes
[42:13] me a verse 26 uh well let's go back to
[42:15] 25 joshua made a covenant with the
[42:18] people that day now my brother and
[42:20] sister for a covenant to be made in its
[42:23] right context those who disagreed should
[42:25] have raised their voice and said i
[42:27] disagree with this so when they stood
[42:30] there and allowed the covenant to be
[42:32] applied they themselves by by willingly
[42:36] or unwillingly place themselves now
[42:39] under this covenant that joshua has made
[42:42] with the people and this covenant my
[42:44] brother and sister was god speaking this
[42:47] is not joshua we don't have a thus saith
[42:49] joshua as it were but this covenant was
[42:52] them agreeing with the word of god that
[42:56] we will serve god amen because you can
[42:58] agree with your church and then when
[43:00] your church flies to the south if you
[43:02] want to understand what that is just go
[43:04] check out what's happening in the
[43:05] southern baptist conference they are
[43:07] falling apart blowing apart at the seams
[43:10] because they've now come to a place in
[43:12] life that collectively they don't all
[43:14] agree with each other and so it's
[43:16] tearing apart what was built all these
[43:19] years and there's people standing up
[43:21] great men in their churches saying well
[43:23] really the baptist conference was
[43:25] nothing more than a collective
[43:27] missionary effort or a collective
[43:29] educational effort
[43:32] is that what church is
[43:34] missionary and education
[43:37] you see something got skewered along the
[43:40] way and now they're not agreeing and
[43:42] they have some rightful reasons to not
[43:44] agree but you know it's there that that
[43:46] it's being fractured but when this
[43:48] covenant my brother and sister i hope
[43:50] you catch my point when this covenant is
[43:52] not between you and grace tabernacle not
[43:54] between you and the message of brother
[43:57] branham but this covenant is between you
[43:59] and jesus christ there's nothing there
[44:01] to break there's nothing to disagree
[44:04] with there's nothing to say it's changed
[44:06] direction
[44:08] but we can hold to that word and know
[44:10] that that word is faithful and true
[44:13] now joshua wrote these words
[44:16] in the book of the law so this was not
[44:17] just something that somebody come along
[44:19] and said i don't remember it being that
[44:21] way have you ever seen that
[44:24] a disagreement maybe
[44:28] now don't feel sorry for me because i
[44:30] don't mean it this way but i'm trying to
[44:31] break my habit of using you for the
[44:33] example
[44:34] but i remember one time a man
[44:36] a man that i
[44:38] felt very close to a good portion of my
[44:40] life
[44:41] and he come to me and he said i'm angry
[44:43] at you and i said okay i'm sorry
[44:45] what why and he says well
[44:47] in church on sunday you said this this
[44:50] this and this
[44:54] i i just like
[44:58] if i said that
[45:00] i was actually denying
[45:02] everything i believe
[45:07] i had to be kind of strong i guess i
[45:09] said
[45:11] i know what i said i don't know what you
[45:13] heard
[45:14] because i am not if i'm going to deny
[45:16] you know saints i've said this before
[45:18] if we're not going to serve god
[45:20] we're not going to stand with the
[45:22] message with our whole heart mind body
[45:24] and soul let's all buy a boat and go
[45:26] boating
[45:27] let's go buy a snowmobile and go
[45:28] snowmobiling let's go let's go do this
[45:30] or let's go do that because that's all
[45:32] it will net us
[45:34] is the equivalent
[45:36] and so you see it comes to a place in a
[45:39] time that sometimes the words need to be
[45:41] recorded sometimes it's got to be
[45:43] anchored in stone that when they come
[45:46] and and we have you know uh those that
[45:48] would would speak against the things of
[45:51] god uh to be able to point back and say
[45:53] does not the word say if you study your
[45:56] bible you'll see jesus said that he
[45:58] didn't come and say now this is what i
[45:59] think and this is what i he said is it
[46:01] not written
[46:03] so god anchored that down so that anyone
[46:06] could go and reference back to what god
[46:09] said and therefore let it be written and
[46:12] so it's there that joshua takes this
[46:15] great stone and he picks this up my
[46:17] brother and sister now when they say
[46:19] great stone we don't know exactly in my
[46:22] mind it would have to be a stone
[46:23] obviously uh that joshua was capable of
[46:26] picking up but maybe a a more distinct
[46:30] or
[46:30] identifiable stone than just any old
[46:33] stone scattered around and he takes this
[46:35] particular stone and i personally just
[46:38] looking at the word of god like this
[46:39] believe that stone was ordained to be
[46:41] the stone that joshua chose
[46:46] and he takes his stone and he carries it
[46:48] over and he puts it next to this ochre
[46:50] under this oak that's right there by the
[46:52] tabernacle and he tells them now that
[46:55] this stone shall be a witness unto us
[46:59] now my brother and sister whoever
[47:01] thought that a stone would be able to
[47:02] speak or be a witness to us but we look
[47:05] at this for it hath heard this is
[47:08] what was so profound to me that joshua
[47:11] which we know is the type of jesus
[47:13] christ is there telling you this stone
[47:16] has heard the word of the lord or words
[47:19] of the lord which he spake unto us and
[47:22] it shall therefore a witness be a
[47:24] witness to unto us amen lest you deny
[47:27] your god so joshua identifies now i have
[47:30] to tell you my brother and sister i
[47:31] think back through the scripture the
[47:33] stone cornerstone that they rejected
[47:35] there's a stone amen there was a stone
[47:38] that gideon was hiding with and that
[47:40] fire come down to in his time and all
[47:44] through scripture we find remember
[47:46] brother david nash preached here oh i
[47:48] don't know a year or two ago about the
[47:50] stones in the stream of history there
[47:53] and how that those stones was there and
[47:55] and placed there and were an
[47:57] identification a mark a statue a
[48:00] memorial amen and so we see these
[48:03] references of stone and we know that our
[48:06] lord jesus christ is that very stone
[48:09] that very rock that we are anchored to
[48:11] it wasn't peter it's not that we go back
[48:14] but it was a revelation of who jesus
[48:17] christ
[48:18] and so we look at all these and that's
[48:20] why i say i put this out for you to
[48:22] think on not to create a doctrine not to
[48:24] cry to bring something to stir things up
[48:27] but to remember my brother and sister
[48:29] joshua was bringing them not a old dead
[48:33] volcanic or whatever he was bringing
[48:36] them a living stone one that could
[48:40] testify
[48:41] hallelujah
[48:43] now imagine
[48:46] now imagine you guys might jump as much
[48:49] as sister jerry did tonight when brother
[48:51] alex jumped out of the closet and scared
[48:53] the fire out of her
[48:54] amen
[48:56] but
[48:58] it was it was a beautiful sight to see
[49:02] but uh
[49:03] imagine
[49:05] you're next to a stoner starts to speak
[49:06] to you
[49:08] there's gideon
[49:11] he's cowering he's hiding he's using
[49:13] that stone saints
[49:15] as a camouflage against the enemy coming
[49:18] to steal revelation from him
[49:21] and how shocked he must have been when
[49:22] voices started to come
[49:24] started to deal with him now this stone
[49:27] is now a witness
[49:29] now we could go back into more the
[49:31] reality that most of us as minds would
[49:33] grasp it would be that we're walking in
[49:35] the path of life because we're going to
[49:37] the tabernacle we're going and we would
[49:39] look over and we would see that
[49:42] and say i made a covenant
[49:45] a reminder a visual reminder we'd say
[49:48] well that was our voice coming
[49:51] my brother and sister yes god used that
[49:53] rock to speak to many
[49:56] a believer
[49:58] that was getting bogged down in the
[50:00] cares of life and the struggles and
[50:02] maybe the naysayer
[50:04] and they started saying well
[50:06] really i mean it seems like
[50:09] you know
[50:11] this one here
[50:12] kind of
[50:13] quit serving the lord and just turned
[50:15] himself into a seven a day a week
[50:17] working machine and his family's got a
[50:20] new house a new car
[50:22] a new boat
[50:23] they're going on a cruise
[50:25] maybe that's really where it's at in
[50:27] life
[50:28] i'll pay my tithe
[50:31] and he's walking
[50:32] he's down to the tabernacle and he looks
[50:34] over and he sees that stone
[50:36] and he remembers wait
[50:38] i didn't make a covenant
[50:41] with
[50:42] as it were tabernacle a building i
[50:43] didn't make a covenant with joshua
[50:46] i made a covenant with jehovah
[50:49] something stir in his heart and he said
[50:51] and i am not going to break
[50:54] that covenant
[50:56] and so it was their memorial a witness
[50:58] speaking to him
[51:00] but i tell you my brother and sister
[51:02] that there is a living word in the day
[51:04] that we live in right now and god is
[51:06] here as a covenant with you and i and he
[51:10] has set as it were memorials before us
[51:13] that when we come face to face with
[51:15] these things they remind us of who we
[51:17] are
[51:19] we can stand and some people don't
[51:21] understand but the truth behind it you
[51:23] can look out and see the man that you
[51:25] can recognize the symptoms of his
[51:27] physical body that he's addicted to
[51:29] something like meth and we could come
[51:32] and recognize except for the grace of
[51:34] god there go i
[51:37] and you say but you're looking at that
[51:39] guy no we're not we're just recognizing
[51:42] if it wasn't for the lord we would be in
[51:45] the alley we would be the drunk on this
[51:47] stool we would be the away
[51:51] and god sets those as memorials
[51:52] reminders to you and i we made a
[51:54] covenant to serve the lord
[51:57] hallelujah
[51:58] now he says you know this stone
[52:01] is going to be a witness unto it for it
[52:02] hath heard now how could this stone have
[52:05] heard
[52:07] but you have to understand joshua
[52:10] i think by revelation was looking all
[52:12] down through the scripture behind
[52:15] and forward recognizing the significance
[52:18] of this stone and what it would mean
[52:21] that it was not a dead stone the
[52:24] cornerstone my brother and sister that
[52:25] they rejected was not a dead stone it
[52:28] was a living stone
[52:30] and the tabernacle as it were without
[52:32] that stone became a dead building full
[52:35] of creeds and traditions and all of
[52:38] these things and our lives without that
[52:40] cornerstone become dead to creed and
[52:43] tradition
[52:44] and personal desire lust of the flesh
[52:47] pride of life
[52:49] and we look at that and see and he says
[52:51] you know what so it's going to be a
[52:53] witness to us then remind us don't deny
[52:56] you're gone
[52:58] and now joshua comes right there
[53:01] and then he says you know what hey go
[53:03] back to your inheritance
[53:05] now my brother and sister do we have a
[53:07] hundred percent compliance as it were if
[53:09] you could follow that phrase
[53:12] i believe there was some of those walked
[53:13] away from there
[53:15] and went right back to their life
[53:22] that's what joshua thought
[53:26] i really didn't like the way joshua
[53:27] tried to put he tried to put the
[53:30] the whole thing
[53:32] on us
[53:34] but i'm a jew
[53:37] i'm a message believer
[53:42] i don't agree with joshua i believe god
[53:44] sent a prophet
[53:46] but you see that wasn't the point they
[53:48] had a covenant in the wrong place
[53:50] they were looking to the wrong thing to
[53:53] them the stone was never alive the stone
[53:56] could never have really truly heard the
[53:58] stone could never truly have spoken
[54:02] therefore it's not a witness to me it's
[54:03] a witness to joshua and all of you
[54:06] and they went on in their life
[54:08] now my brother and sister it didn't take
[54:10] away their heritage i hope you catch
[54:11] this
[54:12] did not take away their heritage
[54:16] and it might not even have removed them
[54:19] from worshiping in the tabernacle
[54:25] now i don't mean that too
[54:26] to refer to any modern day i'm talking
[54:29] about this here in the scripture
[54:31] so you see
[54:32] this this stone that was there now does
[54:34] the scripture not tell us that nature
[54:36] itself will be a witness either for or
[54:38] against us
[54:40] amen and so this stone being set in
[54:43] their way right god puts a word but
[54:45] brother branham says that you have to
[54:47] walk all over the word of god to get to
[54:50] hell
[54:51] you're going to have to crawl over it to
[54:53] get to hell
[54:55] so here is a stone that is set in their
[54:57] way that in their daily life they keep
[55:00] coming in contact and they remember the
[55:02] words this is a memorial this is a
[55:05] witness this has heard the word i heard
[55:08] and this rock
[55:10] can speak
[55:14] and so it remind them
[55:16] now another thing that touches me and
[55:18] this is just something that struck me as
[55:19] i was looking at this thought the
[55:21] scripture says that in that day my
[55:23] brother and sister when man has rejected
[55:26] the word of god when man has moved away
[55:28] from that and is no longer doesn't even
[55:30] believe there is a god and it is comings
[55:33] down into this absolute day of dismal
[55:36] darkness and mankind reaching the end
[55:39] the scripture says the rocks in the
[55:41] mountains will cry out
[55:44] what cry will this stone
[55:47] have
[55:49] you made a covenant to serve me
[55:52] you made the declaration
[55:54] that you would follow me
[55:57] you see i believe we have a type right
[55:59] here in scripture the rocks in the
[56:01] mountains my brother and sister are not
[56:03] going to be a random oh i hope you
[56:05] follow me i hope you don't think i fell
[56:07] off the cliff tonight but it's not going
[56:08] to just be a random rock as it were
[56:11] that's in the mountain crying out but
[56:13] these are the rocks that have heard the
[56:15] majesty and heard the voice and seen the
[56:18] power of almighty god and those will be
[56:21] the rocks that are crying out not some
[56:23] dead inert volcanic uh uh
[56:27] you know uh
[56:28] oh what is the word
[56:31] spewed out of the ground and solidified
[56:34] and it's just some but this will be the
[56:35] same rocks i believe with all my heart
[56:38] saints the same rocks that will cry in
[56:40] the mountain will be the rocks
[56:43] that have heard
[56:44] sorry to pick on you sister sarah i'm
[56:46] trying to break the habit
[56:48] but maybe while you guys have stood on
[56:49] top of a rock somewhere in the mountain
[56:52] saying how great thou art
[56:56] those rocks
[56:57] have heard the praise of god
[57:00] those times those seasons those places
[57:03] have heard it and they have become tests
[57:05] of testimonies they have come with a
[57:07] with a testimony of of the power of
[57:09] almighty god and and that he's true and
[57:12] it's real and they know where they come
[57:14] from
[57:16] now in proverbs the 12th chapter 15th
[57:19] verse
[57:21] the way of a fool is right in his own
[57:23] eyes
[57:24] that he that hearkeneth unto counsel is
[57:26] wise
[57:28] and so we see as a time taking back to
[57:30] joshua here
[57:32] those that kept looking to that rock and
[57:35] reminding themselves by looking at the
[57:38] rock you might call it a visual cue
[57:40] and they're saying i made a covenant
[57:43] did they all live perfect
[57:46] come on saints
[57:48] you know you're completely
[57:49] interchangeable with them
[57:51] you realize that
[57:52] it was just that god chose to place you
[57:54] in this day see god had could have come
[57:57] easily chose you to be in that day and
[58:00] them to be here don't ask them because
[58:02] they'll trade you
[58:04] right that's what the word of god chose
[58:05] us this is the greatest day greatest
[58:08] revelation the greatest display of power
[58:10] of almighty god of the ages and it's
[58:12] here now and they longed to see this day
[58:15] is what the word says so don't go making
[58:17] no deal i'll trade you places thinking
[58:19] it'll be simpler
[58:21] god called you to this right here and
[58:23] and he made you able to see that the
[58:26] rock of the covenant is still in place
[58:29] today in our presence this rock that we
[58:32] call the word of god is still living and
[58:35] it's still speaking it's still
[58:36] testifying it's still the evidence that
[58:39] a covenant is in place and people will
[58:41] mock that and say oh you guys place so
[58:43] much on revelation you play so much
[58:46] revelation this and revelation that i've
[58:48] had it spoke in my face my brother and
[58:49] sister wave your hands in your face
[58:51] revelation
[58:54] well
[58:55] that's fine
[58:56] but i got a revelation that the rock of
[58:58] my covenant has never faltered and will
[59:01] never fail and it will keep me lined up
[59:03] with the word because it is my continual
[59:06] reminder of who i am and why god placed
[59:09] me in this age
[59:11] he didn't place me in this age for an
[59:13] easy way out amen we heard brother chris
[59:15] preach easy has a cost we don't want
[59:18] easy we want right
[59:20] we want revelation we want the life of
[59:22] the word
[59:24] not to be able to pack the book and
[59:25] quote the quote my brother and sister i
[59:27] want the life contained in that book
[59:30] hallelujah
[59:32] you look at that
[59:34] we want to hearken into counsel that's
[59:36] why i chose that scripture to place that
[59:38] in there that we want to be those kind
[59:40] of people that will hearken unto counsel
[59:43] and let me just put it in this type i
[59:45] know you'll follow me if that rock is
[59:48] telling me you've been getting a little
[59:49] cold
[59:51] if that rock was just telling me you're
[59:53] letting things in your home that
[59:54] shouldn't be there
[59:56] i don't want to say ah it's just a rock
[59:58] i want to say that rock was there as a
[1:00:01] witness as a testimony to me of my
[1:00:04] covenant with jesus christ
[1:00:06] amen do you follow me
[1:00:08] hallelujah
[1:00:10] now proverbs
[1:00:12] 21 2.
[1:00:19] is this scripture correct
[1:00:23] yeah
[1:00:24] i say this part of the foundation my own
[1:00:26] daddy taught me as a young man
[1:00:28] and he says son everybody says there's
[1:00:30] two sides to every story but he said
[1:00:33] realize there's three sides
[1:00:35] your side
[1:00:36] their side
[1:00:37] and the absolute truth
[1:00:42] you know
[1:00:44] you've seen it
[1:00:47] people would be maybe telling the truth
[1:00:49] i was jealous i was envious
[1:00:52] i got angry
[1:00:54] hold that brother he's just talking down
[1:00:56] on himself he was probably telling the
[1:00:58] truth
[1:01:01] but see we're so conditioned
[1:01:03] to present our best side
[1:01:07] and to look good and you know human
[1:01:09] nature
[1:01:10] i don't know
[1:01:14] maybe by the time we're in our mid teens
[1:01:17] we start to get this idea
[1:01:20] and any of you young people that are
[1:01:22] kind of in that age are coming that age
[1:01:24] that want to say man you're certainly
[1:01:25] welcome
[1:01:29] but we get this idea
[1:01:31] i am right
[1:01:32] and mom and dad
[1:01:34] oh no let's not be prejudiced there
[1:01:36] we'll start with dad
[1:01:38] dad's wrong
[1:01:40] i'm right
[1:01:41] mom's wrong
[1:01:42] i'm right
[1:01:44] sister's wrong
[1:01:46] i'm right brother's wrong i'm right
[1:01:50] brother paul
[1:01:51] is wrong
[1:01:53] i'm right
[1:01:55] now what happens when that goes
[1:01:56] unchecked
[1:01:59] unbridled growth
[1:02:03] of an ego
[1:02:04] of an opinion of a spirit of rebellion
[1:02:08] unbridled
[1:02:11] they grow into a young person that
[1:02:13] everything they do
[1:02:15] even if it's completely against the word
[1:02:17] of god
[1:02:18] is justified
[1:02:23] i'm sorry none of you young people
[1:02:24] thought about saying amen i saw it just
[1:02:26] come so close on your lips
[1:02:31] every way of a man is right in his own
[1:02:33] eyes but the lord
[1:02:36] bypassed your eyes
[1:02:38] and went down and started looking at
[1:02:39] that heart
[1:02:41] and said oh there's another kind of
[1:02:43] stone here that we have to deal with and
[1:02:45] not all of it is the cornerstone and
[1:02:48] this stone and that stone some of it's
[1:02:50] just an old stony heart
[1:02:52] but isn't beautiful how the lord loves
[1:02:54] us so much he comes and he tenderizes
[1:02:56] that heart
[1:02:57] softens it up soaks it in the word
[1:03:00] answers prayers speaks to us in the
[1:03:02] midnight hour until we know lord you're
[1:03:05] right and i was wrong and i want to walk
[1:03:07] in the way of the word i don't want to
[1:03:08] walk in my own opinion
[1:03:10] amen
[1:03:12] but you see we've become a witness in
[1:03:14] and of ourselves my brother and sister
[1:03:16] you'll see that some you know i'm sorry
[1:03:18] just thinking about my daddy today and
[1:03:21] uh we're going through a lot of stuff
[1:03:22] with the estate and got to go to court
[1:03:24] and all these kind of things and and i
[1:03:26] remember my daddy one time making a
[1:03:28] statement to me there'd been a certain
[1:03:29] minister come and visited our church and
[1:03:31] it just so happened that minister over
[1:03:33] and over and over again told you i told
[1:03:36] the church just over and over and over
[1:03:38] again i'm just a humble
[1:03:41] servant of god
[1:03:43] you crossed him he cut you up with a
[1:03:45] buzz saw
[1:03:47] but he said that over and over again i'm
[1:03:48] just a humble
[1:03:50] and my daddy
[1:03:52] said son i want you to understand
[1:03:53] something
[1:03:54] people that have to tell you they're
[1:03:56] humble
[1:03:58] usually aren't
[1:04:01] oh lord i was like growing up i'm like
[1:04:03] that's out of my vocabulary
[1:04:06] but it's the truth is it not
[1:04:09] because humility is something that comes
[1:04:11] on display when we don't even think
[1:04:14] about
[1:04:15] oh i'll be humble
[1:04:17] right now i could just slap their head
[1:04:19] off but i'll be humble
[1:04:24] we can laugh about it can't we
[1:04:27] but you see those spirits work in that
[1:04:29] fashion
[1:04:30] and you know what happens
[1:04:32] oh what is that um the law of attraction
[1:04:37] that kind of spirit attracts more people
[1:04:39] and tell the whole group of them i mean
[1:04:41] we're right aren't we brother trevor oh
[1:04:43] absolutely you and i i mean we are right
[1:04:46] and anybody who don't agree with us has
[1:04:48] got a problem
[1:04:49] yeah that's just that plain and simple
[1:04:52] and what do they do they and i i know
[1:04:54] that it's open you know then brother
[1:04:56] david comes along and
[1:04:57] yep
[1:04:58] then brother sean and you know but
[1:05:00] sergey and it just goes until pretty
[1:05:02] soon we got a group of these people
[1:05:03] going around the church or whatever our
[1:05:05] doctrine is right
[1:05:06] i know there's 10 scriptures that prove
[1:05:08] it wrong but we are right
[1:05:11] and it grows from there and
[1:05:13] you know god's only got one option at
[1:05:15] that stage saints
[1:05:17] if there's a real son or daughter of god
[1:05:19] involved with that god has to come the
[1:05:21] one option he has to come and crush it
[1:05:23] and then everybody's like what happened
[1:05:26] we had such a lovely church and things
[1:05:29] were so good and then it got ripped
[1:05:31] apart at this no it didn't get ripped
[1:05:33] apart they blamed the devil i've told
[1:05:35] you before sometimes the devil's setting
[1:05:36] out on the step crying because he's
[1:05:38] getting blamed for something that he
[1:05:40] didn't even do because we set the stage
[1:05:43] and god says you know what i've got a
[1:05:45] son i've got a daughter or maybe more
[1:05:46] than one in there and i've got to crush
[1:05:48] this so that spirit doesn't take over
[1:05:50] the whole church and destroy their souls
[1:05:53] and so our our lives become a witness of
[1:05:55] who we are and and uh my brother and
[1:05:58] sister let me just skip over some stuff
[1:06:00] so i'm not too late tonight i'll tell
[1:06:01] you tonight i'm a witness
[1:06:03] you're a witness tonight we're witnesses
[1:06:05] of the open book amen we're witnesses
[1:06:07] that the word of god has come in our
[1:06:09] hour and been revealed and it's a living
[1:06:12] word it's a powerful word it's not a
[1:06:14] word that's just laying down and being
[1:06:16] just trampled my brother and sister this
[1:06:18] is a power this is a word that satan
[1:06:21] respects he respects nothing else on
[1:06:23] earth but he respects this word because
[1:06:25] he know he's loosed or bound
[1:06:28] by the word
[1:06:31] that's what we are that's the kind of
[1:06:33] witness we're called to be what is it
[1:06:35] because we've got the rock amen we've
[1:06:37] got rock of revelation in you and i and
[1:06:39] when we meet peter someday my brother
[1:06:41] and sister he's not going to say well
[1:06:43] praise the lord i was able to share that
[1:06:45] revelation with you guys he's going to
[1:06:47] come and say isn't that so beautiful
[1:06:49] that revelation of the word that
[1:06:51] revelation of jesus christ the power of
[1:06:53] the word unfolding oh you experienced it
[1:06:56] laodicea you saw it when the book was
[1:06:59] open oh praise god isn't this so
[1:07:02] marvelous and we'll be there amen
[1:07:04] brother peter the power of revelation it
[1:07:07] is so incredible it delivered us out of
[1:07:09] the very jaws of satan
[1:07:13] he's not going to come and lord it over
[1:07:14] you and neither will we lord it over
[1:07:16] them but we will all rejoice
[1:07:18] of the revelation of the opening of the
[1:07:20] book
[1:07:21] and not only that the book was opened
[1:07:24] but that we
[1:07:25] by god's grace were able to take it
[1:07:28] and eat it
[1:07:30] do you know the book is not consumed my
[1:07:32] brother and sister
[1:07:34] not completely consumed it's already hit
[1:07:36] your belly
[1:07:38] this scripture says it was bitter in our
[1:07:40] belly
[1:07:41] now you tell me tonight why is it that
[1:07:44] you keep eating
[1:07:48] come on give me an answer to somebody
[1:07:50] why did we keep eating when it was in
[1:07:54] our belly bitter
[1:07:56] and we struggled oh lord why
[1:08:00] oh why give me another bite
[1:08:03] oh it hurts so bad my life is being oh
[1:08:07] give me another bite
[1:08:09] why my brother and sister because the
[1:08:11] power of the open book is greater than
[1:08:14] the power of laodicea and there's
[1:08:17] something in you that desired that
[1:08:20] hallelujah
[1:08:21] now there's scriptural references
[1:08:24] of the eyes of the lord and i give it to
[1:08:26] you as a homework assignment tonight
[1:08:28] because i i'm already
[1:08:30] slower than i thought i would be
[1:08:33] but the eyes of the lord go through the
[1:08:35] scripture you see many references of the
[1:08:37] eyes of the lord
[1:08:38] and now when the lord is looking on us
[1:08:40] my brother and sister this scripture
[1:08:41] tells us also and this is just a side
[1:08:43] note i
[1:08:45] chose not to include
[1:08:48] but the scripture tells us that god's
[1:08:49] been patient with the unbeliever
[1:08:53] and if he be patient with the unbeliever
[1:08:56] how much more
[1:08:57] he'd be patient
[1:08:59] with you and i
[1:09:01] oh think of the grace of god
[1:09:04] poured on out on us that this this
[1:09:06] patience this grace is being just poured
[1:09:08] out on us and i'm telling you my brother
[1:09:10] and sister that
[1:09:12] in that day
[1:09:13] we will be spoken of
[1:09:15] like david
[1:09:17] amen
[1:09:19] perfect
[1:09:22] hard to fathom isn't it
[1:09:24] i'm going to read you a quote in a
[1:09:25] minute that makes it really hard to
[1:09:27] fathom
[1:09:28] we sometimes would wonder
[1:09:30] why lord why me
[1:09:32] usually you know what
[1:09:35] you guys would probably be kind of like
[1:09:36] me but different because you're you and
[1:09:38] i'm me
[1:09:39] and i'm human and
[1:09:44] i think you're all human
[1:09:50] my god looks at us so much different we
[1:09:52] look at ourselves
[1:09:55] and the day that we look at ourself
[1:09:57] the lowest
[1:10:00] is usually right after we have
[1:10:03] failed
[1:10:10] you see satan has more motive my brother
[1:10:12] and sister
[1:10:13] than just causing you to fail as in
[1:10:16] you'll be lost
[1:10:18] do you realize if satan stood right here
[1:10:20] he could explain predestination to you
[1:10:22] to a degree that we in the human element
[1:10:25] could not even explain it
[1:10:28] you follow me
[1:10:31] he knows the word
[1:10:37] but if he can get you
[1:10:39] to not take the word
[1:10:42] if he can get you to pull back from the
[1:10:44] word
[1:10:46] he doesn't have to rebuke the word or
[1:10:48] deny the word he's just got to get you
[1:10:50] to not take the word
[1:10:53] and he's there and he gets anointing on
[1:10:55] you i'm not worthy and we pull back a
[1:10:58] little bit
[1:11:00] you know brother branham summed it up
[1:11:01] very very good i'm sure the theologians
[1:11:04] are not too impressed with this
[1:11:07] i'm sure the theologians would look at
[1:11:09] that and say well that's that's just
[1:11:10] hillbilly stuff right there but i'm
[1:11:13] telling you the prophet of god summed
[1:11:15] this equation up so perfectly
[1:11:18] when he said
[1:11:20] boo
[1:11:21] devil
[1:11:23] and the devil backs up and you step
[1:11:26] forward
[1:11:27] boo
[1:11:28] devil
[1:11:29] what is it
[1:11:31] he wasn't talking about casper type
[1:11:33] stuff
[1:11:36] come on saints
[1:11:38] after all casper was a friendly ghost
[1:11:42] he's not talking casper stuff saints
[1:11:44] he's talking about the very principle
[1:11:46] that when you will open your mouth and
[1:11:47] rebuke the devil the devil will back up
[1:11:50] because he respects the word
[1:11:53] he knows the authority of the word and
[1:11:56] and so it's there that satan tries to
[1:11:58] get us to willingly
[1:12:00] back up
[1:12:01] willingly pull back
[1:12:03] amen
[1:12:04] now possessing the gate of the enemy
[1:12:06] after trial
[1:12:09] you know what this means
[1:12:13] you got to possess the gate of your
[1:12:15] enemy
[1:12:16] in what might possibly be
[1:12:19] one of your weaker moments
[1:12:22] doesn't say uh possessing the gate of
[1:12:24] the enemy after
[1:12:26] great conquering warfare
[1:12:29] it's after trial
[1:12:32] you still have to possess him then
[1:12:33] saints
[1:12:34] can someone please say amen amen
[1:12:38] you have to possess the gate of the
[1:12:40] enemy no matter what the day
[1:12:43] and life has handed you
[1:12:48] okay
[1:12:49] there was a great evangelist about 75
[1:12:51] years ago i just can't think of his name
[1:12:54] i think it was arthur mccoy
[1:12:57] he had crossed the land and one night he
[1:12:59] had a dream now remember saints this is
[1:13:00] just a dream now let me let me stop here
[1:13:04] if you go and look this up you'll find
[1:13:06] brother branham uses this with different
[1:13:08] references
[1:13:10] in different kind of slightly different
[1:13:12] contexts
[1:13:13] and and you'll find it but we're not
[1:13:15] trying to make this as it is some kind
[1:13:18] of a hard and fast thing but the
[1:13:20] principle of it to to lay down as it
[1:13:23] were a memorial for us to understand
[1:13:26] what the prophet of god was speaking and
[1:13:28] how it applied to us
[1:13:30] and he had crossed the land and one
[1:13:32] night he had a dream that he had went on
[1:13:33] to glory and he said he went up to the
[1:13:36] gate and said they wouldn't let him in
[1:13:39] and said he said i'm author arthur mccoy
[1:13:42] from the united states i'm an evangelist
[1:13:45] so the gatekeeper went in now this was a
[1:13:47] dream
[1:13:48] went in and said i
[1:13:50] i can't find your name at all
[1:13:54] you imagine
[1:13:55] what that would feel like
[1:13:59] imagine saints after living your whole
[1:14:01] life you're standing there
[1:14:03] at the symbolic gate of heaven
[1:14:07] and there's like
[1:14:10] i will look we'll look you up under
[1:14:12] reverend nothing there uh we'll look you
[1:14:14] up under brother
[1:14:16] nothing there
[1:14:17] arthur art
[1:14:19] any nicknames
[1:14:25] sorry we can't find you
[1:14:28] you know how crushed you would be
[1:14:33] i can't find your name at all he said
[1:14:35] well i was an evangelist he said sir i
[1:14:38] well there's a chance there's something
[1:14:41] wrong no sir i have the book here
[1:14:44] i can't find your name at all he said
[1:14:45] well well can i do anything about it he
[1:14:48] said you might appeal your case to the
[1:14:49] white throne judgment
[1:14:51] god help
[1:14:53] i believe this is brother branham
[1:14:54] sediment right here
[1:14:57] go and help i don't want to be there
[1:14:59] see we have this opportunity to settle
[1:15:02] all of this we don't have to have a
[1:15:03] white throne judgment in our future
[1:15:05] concerning ourselves
[1:15:07] god might ask you to sit there as a
[1:15:09] judge at the white throne that you might
[1:15:12] as it were judge those who did wrong to
[1:15:14] you as it were
[1:15:16] or did that
[1:15:18] now this begs to bring out this thing
[1:15:20] that has become almost like a doctrine
[1:15:25] i've had men say well i was working on
[1:15:27] remodeling
[1:15:28] these people's house and
[1:15:30] the man's wife come out and handed me a
[1:15:32] glass of water
[1:15:34] we're going to see her there
[1:15:38] i can't contest that i don't know
[1:15:42] but if you're a ranked center it's going
[1:15:43] to take more than a glass of water
[1:15:47] to get you into heaven
[1:15:49] there's got to be something in the heart
[1:15:52] and this thing
[1:15:53] oh my tone it all down here
[1:15:58] it's starting to take root
[1:16:02] well they held the door for me when my
[1:16:04] arms were full
[1:16:06] they did this they did that
[1:16:08] my brother and sister they've got it to
[1:16:10] where any old scoundrel
[1:16:12] that was polite
[1:16:15] is going to be in glory
[1:16:18] now i don't want to make light of this i
[1:16:19] don't make fun of this but my brother
[1:16:21] and sister there comes a point
[1:16:24] that it all has to line up in the word
[1:16:25] of god
[1:16:27] otherwise we could just almost set the
[1:16:29] stage you know oh could you give me a
[1:16:31] glass of water oh they gave me a glass
[1:16:33] of water they'll be there
[1:16:35] come on saints
[1:16:36] i know these are not comfortable topics
[1:16:38] sometimes to deal with but look how the
[1:16:40] devil is twisting this and the reason
[1:16:42] he's twisting this is because the
[1:16:44] standard then can be lowered as long as
[1:16:47] there's some good deed to the bride
[1:16:49] associated
[1:16:53] don't let the devil fool you with that
[1:16:57] well i can can i do anything about it
[1:16:59] you might appeal your case so i thrown
[1:17:00] judgment god help i don't want to be
[1:17:02] there
[1:17:03] he said well well if that's my only hope
[1:17:06] i guess i'll just appeal my case then
[1:17:09] and he said he thought he went
[1:17:11] uh went away away and just and as he
[1:17:14] began he said it was darkness and got
[1:17:15] lighter and lighter said it seemed like
[1:17:17] there was no certain place this light
[1:17:20] stopped but he was right in the center
[1:17:22] of it and said it said who who
[1:17:24] approaches my throne of judgment and he
[1:17:27] said i'm arthur mccoy
[1:17:29] i'm an evangelist
[1:17:31] sent many souls to the kingdom
[1:17:36] scary for the preacher isn't it
[1:17:39] because that might very well have been a
[1:17:41] credible legitimate statement i've sent
[1:17:43] many souls to the king
[1:17:46] but can't find his own name
[1:17:50] in the book of life
[1:17:52] oh god help us
[1:17:55] god help us
[1:17:59] was your name not found upon the book he
[1:18:01] said no
[1:18:03] then you've appealed to my court yes sir
[1:18:06] you shall receive justice i shall judge
[1:18:08] you by my laws arthur mccoy did you ever
[1:18:11] tell a lie
[1:18:13] he said i thought it was pretty good man
[1:18:16] till i stood in that light
[1:18:20] oh god i pray that light comes through
[1:18:22] our church
[1:18:23] comes through our lives that we don't
[1:18:25] just fool ourselves thinking everything
[1:18:27] is good lord let that light
[1:18:30] which is
[1:18:31] our lord jesus christ come through
[1:18:37] i thought i was a pretty good man until
[1:18:39] i stood in that light he said but in the
[1:18:40] presence of that light i was a sinner
[1:18:44] we'll all be that you might feel secure
[1:18:47] now but wait till you come there
[1:18:49] oh man
[1:18:52] how do you think it feels
[1:18:54] here when he's anointing
[1:18:56] how little you can feel
[1:18:59] what will it be at the white throne
[1:19:01] judgment
[1:19:02] said did you ever tell a lie he said i
[1:19:04] thought i had been truthful but some
[1:19:06] little things that i thought was little
[1:19:08] white lies then become big and dark
[1:19:10] there
[1:19:11] yes sir i've told the lie
[1:19:13] did you ever steal he said i thought i
[1:19:16] had been honest about it never stole but
[1:19:18] he said in the presence of that light i
[1:19:20] realized there was some deals i'd pulled
[1:19:23] that wasn't just right
[1:19:26] yes sir
[1:19:27] i've stole
[1:19:28] he said my judgment
[1:19:31] and he was just about ready to hear his
[1:19:33] sentence depart into everlasting fire
[1:19:35] which prepared for the devil and his
[1:19:36] angels and said every bone was coming
[1:19:39] apart and i heard the sweetest voice
[1:19:42] i ever heard in my life and when i
[1:19:44] turned to look i saw the sweetest face i
[1:19:47] ever saw sweeter than a mother's face
[1:19:49] sweeter voice than my mother ever called
[1:19:52] me so i looked around and i heard a
[1:19:54] voice and father that is true he did
[1:19:57] tell lies and he wasn't just honest but
[1:20:00] down on earth he stood for me now i
[1:20:04] stand in his place
[1:20:07] and you will find various uh context of
[1:20:10] this through the message where brother
[1:20:11] brown is speaking along this line i'm
[1:20:14] telling you my brother and sister we
[1:20:16] many times judge our position in jesus
[1:20:18] christ about good days and bad days and
[1:20:21] all of these other worldly influences
[1:20:24] right here but i want to say tonight and
[1:20:26] i don't want this to sound judgmental
[1:20:28] but in the presence of that light every
[1:20:31] one of us will realize we are a sinner
[1:20:35] oh but we have the opportunity praise
[1:20:38] the lord to have one that will come and
[1:20:41] stand in our defense hallelujah will be
[1:20:45] that witness coming and standing in our
[1:20:49] defense in that day we will hear we're
[1:20:52] not here to lower the standard because
[1:20:54] he'll speak for us we're here to live
[1:20:56] every word to the best of our ability
[1:20:59] but we have to come to the place that we
[1:21:02] recognize we rely on his grace
[1:21:05] amen that our very best that we know how
[1:21:08] to do and physically and mentally and
[1:21:10] spiritually can accomplish is nothing in
[1:21:13] the presence of that light but i tell
[1:21:15] you my brother and sister we can stand
[1:21:17] today as a witness of our lord jesus
[1:21:20] christ how do you do that brother paul i
[1:21:22] want to do that live your life according
[1:21:25] to the word
[1:21:27] amen we can do it we don't have to be
[1:21:29] some super you know almost like
[1:21:31] televangelist be the one on the corner
[1:21:34] expounding everything in such a perfect
[1:21:36] context but what we got to do is stand
[1:21:40] as it were on the corner and people say
[1:21:42] something's different about this person
[1:21:44] something is happened to them i knew
[1:21:46] them years ago and they are not the same
[1:21:49] person i have been around them and
[1:21:51] something is changing what is going on
[1:21:54] with them it is jesus christ
[1:21:57] i've got saved you've become a fanatical
[1:22:01] that might be your description but to me
[1:22:04] it's called redeemed
[1:22:07] might be fanatical to you but to me it's
[1:22:09] redeemed
[1:22:11] amen and that life-changing word that
[1:22:14] comes my brother and sister is the very
[1:22:17] thing
[1:22:19] now we believe according to what the
[1:22:21] prophet preached to us
[1:22:24] you get everything under the blood here
[1:22:26] we won't be standing in a white throne
[1:22:28] judgment to be judged
[1:22:30] right scripture says some men
[1:22:32] sins go before them and some men's sins
[1:22:34] follow
[1:22:36] make sure your sins go before you
[1:22:38] amen the prophet of god i should have
[1:22:40] included this we would have had a moment
[1:22:42] here
[1:22:44] prophet of god
[1:22:46] declaring to us
[1:22:49] that what we got to do is make sure
[1:22:52] because how does that go
[1:22:55] lord help me grasp it
[1:22:57] prophet of god talking about how the
[1:22:59] devil can't get to you you just stay
[1:23:02] underneath the blood
[1:23:04] and if you are underneath the blood and
[1:23:06] the devil comes into you
[1:23:10] he would then be your brother
[1:23:14] because he can't get in there
[1:23:16] as the devil
[1:23:20] sorry i kind of butchered that quote my
[1:23:21] mind is racing all the things i left out
[1:23:24] tonight i wish i could retrieve them off
[1:23:26] my desk and preach them to you right now
[1:23:30] but hallelujah the clock ticks on
[1:23:33] but look at this my brother and sister
[1:23:36] it is there
[1:23:37] i want to make this emphasis
[1:23:39] brother brown i'm speaking this little
[1:23:41] story as you would
[1:23:43] it's true
[1:23:46] it's true he told lies
[1:23:50] it's true
[1:23:51] maybe he stole something
[1:23:53] do you know that many corporations
[1:23:56] saints have went to these tests
[1:23:58] personality tests
[1:24:00] and um
[1:24:02] good
[1:24:03] very
[1:24:04] very good
[1:24:06] uh candidates
[1:24:08] what we would consider good honest
[1:24:10] workers and they're going through this
[1:24:12] personality test and they come to this
[1:24:14] part have you ever stole from your
[1:24:16] company
[1:24:18] and good honest personality they checked
[1:24:20] no
[1:24:22] do you realize your resume just landed
[1:24:23] in the trash because in their mind if
[1:24:26] you went in the bathroom and stopped and
[1:24:28] chatted with charlie you just stole
[1:24:30] company time
[1:24:32] if you ever accidentally walked out of
[1:24:34] the office with a company ink pen in
[1:24:36] your pocket you're a thief
[1:24:41] now until the secret of that the
[1:24:43] revelation of that come out many good
[1:24:46] people flunked because they were like oh
[1:24:48] i'm not a thief
[1:24:50] are you catching my correlation i'm
[1:24:52] trying to see we don't realize it's it's
[1:24:55] not like well you know
[1:24:57] i'll just lie it's
[1:25:00] no
[1:25:01] do you know that technically
[1:25:03] this will really hurt some of us
[1:25:05] do you know technically exaggeration
[1:25:08] is a lie
[1:25:11] god forgive me
[1:25:14] god forgive me my own wife and i don't
[1:25:15] say this in humor my own wife is like
[1:25:17] honey
[1:25:18] you said it was 50 it was 20.
[1:25:21] okay
[1:25:22] i'm sorry
[1:25:24] so maybe this would be the night i need
[1:25:25] to stand up and say you know there's
[1:25:27] been times saints i probably lied to you
[1:25:30] i remember the story this way
[1:25:33] you brothers know what i'm talking about
[1:25:35] the wife is like no no you've got this
[1:25:37] story here from over here you put it
[1:25:39] over here and then you added this to
[1:25:41] that story kind of like i would add
[1:25:43] cooking oil and then you
[1:25:45] and they unravel it all for you and i'm
[1:25:47] not speaking ill of my wife i'm just
[1:25:48] talking about humanity
[1:25:51] and you unravel it all and you remember
[1:25:53] oh yeah
[1:25:54] i had the first half of this event
[1:25:57] in 2010 attached to the last half of
[1:26:00] this event that happened in 2016
[1:26:03] and ended up with an event in 2021 or 2
[1:26:07] that never really happened
[1:26:13] now i know
[1:26:14] it's not you people but it's people like
[1:26:16] you
[1:26:17] that have done that
[1:26:19] maybe men are more prone
[1:26:21] i don't know
[1:26:24] some of your sisters look very smug
[1:26:29] but i'm trying to make that point to
[1:26:31] realize how easily saints
[1:26:34] that line is right there that
[1:26:35] unintentionally
[1:26:38] we waver over these things and we
[1:26:42] by exaggeration or whatever else it
[1:26:44] might be
[1:26:45] paint a picture
[1:26:47] that's not perfectly true
[1:26:50] and we would go on in someone to say are
[1:26:52] you an honest man paul and i would say
[1:26:54] i'm an honest man
[1:26:56] but if i stood saints in that light this
[1:26:59] light
[1:27:02] oh lord let this light be strong enough
[1:27:05] let this light be powerful enough lord
[1:27:08] to come down in our midst
[1:27:10] for us to be able to stop and say lord
[1:27:13] there as it were is a little something
[1:27:16] on the hem of my garment
[1:27:19] and lord i don't want nothing on the hem
[1:27:21] of my garment i don't want that spot i
[1:27:23] don't want the lint i don't want this
[1:27:25] i say this in humor
[1:27:27] there's been a time or two through the
[1:27:29] years
[1:27:30] my wife
[1:27:32] i said oh my i was almost embarrassed
[1:27:34] for you in church today and i'm like
[1:27:37] oh
[1:27:38] why
[1:27:40] well you had
[1:27:42] a feather this is true you had a feather
[1:27:44] from like a feather comforter or
[1:27:46] something you know and it was stuck to
[1:27:47] my collar right here and it's sticking
[1:27:50] out and
[1:27:51] you know she's looking at it thinking
[1:27:53] everybody's gonna think i'm a terrible
[1:27:55] wife
[1:27:57] but to her defense
[1:27:59] she drove to church so the caller was
[1:28:01] out the passenger window
[1:28:03] oh that's not manly let me take that
[1:28:05] back
[1:28:08] but i just want you to see saints how
[1:28:10] easy it is for us
[1:28:13] for satan just to kind of open the door
[1:28:16] and just let it lay out
[1:28:18] that we would come a little anointing
[1:28:20] here a little hubris here and suddenly
[1:28:23] we stepped over the line we don't think
[1:28:25] about it we walk on in life we go on
[1:28:29] lord let the light
[1:28:31] saints that's why i'm preaching this
[1:28:33] tonight i just want to encourage you
[1:28:35] find a time and a place and ask the lord
[1:28:37] to magnify the light in our lives
[1:28:40] magnify it in such a fashion lord that
[1:28:42] people would say man those people of
[1:28:44] grace tabernacle are going nuts over
[1:28:46] there they're all standing in the mirror
[1:28:48] of the word over and over and over again
[1:28:50] and and they're looking and they're
[1:28:51] looking and they're looking at the hymn
[1:28:52] of their garment and they're they're
[1:28:53] doing all this and and why why are they
[1:28:56] so
[1:28:57] because you see we don't want to be this
[1:28:59] man
[1:29:00] we want to be that that comes to the
[1:29:02] presence of god
[1:29:04] stands there in the throne of almighty
[1:29:06] god to worship him and we have every
[1:29:10] opportunity
[1:29:12] god is not playing this as some kind of
[1:29:14] lottery or roulette type of a thing
[1:29:16] where you may or may not but by the word
[1:29:20] we conceal oh pardon me for using this
[1:29:22] term but we can seal the deal
[1:29:25] amen it can be done because we can stand
[1:29:29] and turn on the light
[1:29:31] because god has given us my brother and
[1:29:33] sister that opportunity to stand and
[1:29:36] walk in the light amen hallelujah i got
[1:29:39] other scripture but i think i even wrote
[1:29:41] down on the note i gave brother alex
[1:29:44] that i think we'll just save that for
[1:29:45] another service amen sister ruth would
[1:29:48] you come brother sean
[1:29:49] hallelujah saints i hope we've made
[1:29:51] sense tonight
[1:29:53] amen i want you to be able to see how
[1:29:56] slippery satan is and how us being
[1:29:59] humans can let certain things in our
[1:30:01] life just glide and it wasn't until he
[1:30:03] stood in that light that he realized i'm
[1:30:06] evangelist i sent many souls to the
[1:30:08] kingdom but i'm a liar
[1:30:10] and a thief
[1:30:12] oh lord
[1:30:14] let me stand in the light
[1:30:16] let me stand in the light of your word
[1:30:19] brother paul lafontaine
[1:30:21] i don't remember what the title of that
[1:30:22] is sister jerry
[1:30:24] um
[1:30:25] just said here watch this for
[1:30:27] uh uh uh of
[1:30:29] three three four minutes is all it was
[1:30:31] that i watched right there
[1:30:33] but he's kind of made a little thing
[1:30:36] i just thought it was good you might
[1:30:37] remember the name of that sermon
[1:30:39] it was this last sunday sermon
[1:30:42] and he's talking about how it is that
[1:30:43] you go through security in an airport
[1:30:46] and they check you the machine the wand
[1:30:48] whatever it is and you're going through
[1:30:50] there
[1:30:51] and he was acting you know i think that
[1:30:53] was his sons that he had up there and
[1:30:56] he's one of them's a policeman and and
[1:30:58] the other one you know and he comes up
[1:30:59] there and it's like baby baby steps back
[1:31:02] and he pulled a little something out of
[1:31:03] his pocket
[1:31:05] brother paul wanting to make this a
[1:31:06] point to them he says oh this right here
[1:31:09] was a little bit of doubt
[1:31:13] you see
[1:31:13] it can't make it into the kingdom
[1:31:18] and he backed up and
[1:31:19] he went through again baby baby
[1:31:22] this was a little bit of fear
[1:31:25] and there's a little here and several of
[1:31:27] those things and he says you know we
[1:31:29] could go on and on and on with this
[1:31:32] my brother and sister let's
[1:31:34] get in the light
[1:31:36] let it shine on us so bright
[1:31:39] that it won't come that doubt keep us
[1:31:42] from the kingdom fear keep us from the
[1:31:44] kingdom loss of the flesh pride of life
[1:31:47] all of these and keep us from the
[1:31:48] kingdom let us walk through the detector
[1:31:50] of the word let's not say hey look let's
[1:31:52] turn the detector down because the
[1:31:54] beeping
[1:31:56] bothers me
[1:31:57] i'm offended by the beeping
[1:32:01] let's keep it turned up and let's step
[1:32:04] into that light of the word let it shine
[1:32:06] on us
[1:32:07] and let it just examine us from head to
[1:32:10] toe
[1:32:11] that nothing
[1:32:13] nothing would come that day
[1:32:15] because you see my brother and sister
[1:32:17] the same light that was in that dream
[1:32:19] shining on him right there is the same
[1:32:21] light that's shining on you and i right
[1:32:22] now
[1:32:23] it's a matter of whether we will stand
[1:32:25] and let it examine us or not
[1:32:28] oh i pray that we just stop
[1:32:31] we just stop and examine our life
[1:32:33] and just say lord
[1:32:35] lord i pray
[1:32:38] because i want my sins
[1:32:40] to go before me
[1:32:42] i don't want them to follow me
[1:32:45] hallelujah i want them to go under the
[1:32:47] blood
[1:32:48] amen
[1:32:50] i want them to stay there
[1:32:52] hallelujah let's just stand and worship
[1:32:53] the lord for just just a a few short
[1:32:56] minutes and just
[1:32:57] on my heart tonight this song my hope is
[1:33:00] in the lord
[1:33:01] amen it's certainly nowhere else saints
[1:33:04] i'll tell you what
[1:33:06] the world's just trying to trying to get
[1:33:08] us did you guys see that now they're
[1:33:10] they're saying that maybe possibly
[1:33:12] you'll need a fifth
[1:33:14] coveted shot
[1:33:17] [Music]
[1:33:19] wow
[1:33:21] one was gonna save us
[1:33:24] and a paper mask
[1:33:26] [Music]
[1:33:28] now it's two and two mass
[1:33:31] you see the insanity where they headed
[1:33:34] but we as sons and daughters of god
[1:33:37] my hope my protections in the blood of
[1:33:40] jesus christ
[1:33:41] amen not the fear of this world amen
[1:33:45] yeah there might be reason we certainly
[1:33:47] don't look now and absolutely don't look
[1:33:49] down on anybody that got to covet shot
[1:33:51] that's not the point
[1:33:52] the point is pointing to the spirit out
[1:33:54] here that would control people's lives
[1:33:57] where the holy ghost should be doing the
[1:33:59] controlling should be the control tower
[1:34:01] fear
[1:34:02] fear i was talking to a farmer friend of
[1:34:04] mine today
[1:34:06] an individual in a pickup going 65 miles
[1:34:09] an hour tail ended his wife
[1:34:12] she was parked waiting to turn across
[1:34:14] traffic
[1:34:16] hit her and drove her over in the other
[1:34:17] lane in a car going 55 miles an hour
[1:34:19] head on
[1:34:20] [Music]
[1:34:23] and they want to say it's her fault
[1:34:27] that's the kind of fear
[1:34:29] the world has he says now she won't even
[1:34:30] hardly get in the car and drive
[1:34:34] she gets in the car by herself and
[1:34:35] anxiety rises up and she spends all her
[1:34:37] time looking at the mirrors and
[1:34:39] they live right off of highway 95 out of
[1:34:41] parma right there their driveway the
[1:34:43] road going to their houses right there
[1:34:45] no way to get around it
[1:34:47] and i thought it was interesting
[1:34:48] thinking about these thoughts he said my
[1:34:51] wife is so controlled by fear now
[1:34:54] she won't even drive to the grocery
[1:34:55] store
[1:34:57] because of fear
[1:35:00] her anxiety rises up
[1:35:03] my brother and sister look around us

[1:35:08] in the church
[1:35:09] in the church

[1:35:14] spirit of rock and roll and and these
