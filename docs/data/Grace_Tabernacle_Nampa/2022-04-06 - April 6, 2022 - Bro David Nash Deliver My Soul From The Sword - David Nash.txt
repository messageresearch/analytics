gracious heavenly father as we think about salvation we think about the word of god the revelation of god the revelation of the end time the message of the hour lord i think of all these things and what's it all come back to you sent a prophet that told us nothing but perfect love will enter that place and so when we boil salvation all down to the simplest form it's a love affair with jesus christ you've heard the cries of the people you've requested lord that we take you at your word and i ask tonight that you take them at their word take me at my word as we say lord jesus i love you with that in mind god as we approach your word we ask you just fill each and every heart tonight quick and afresh the love of god in jesus christ and each and every one of us that this dying filthy sin cursed world could just one more time in your little bride see the love of god through jesus christ in each and every life tonight i thank you for it i praise you for it as we give you this service in the name of jesus christ [Music] you [Music] love you [Music] i love you praise the lord thank you sister wonderful thank you congregation well praise god we falls our lot once again to be here this evening and it's always an honor a privilege to be able to stand before the bride of jesus christ and an honor to stand in the presence of almighty god i love him let's not to keep you standing let's turn to psalms 22. and just a couple verses there and then maybe over into hebrews seems like the further i go along this road of salvation if you could call it that i suppose god just opens things more and more and more we know the prophet of god told us that every scripture has compound meaning and compound revelation and not only that that every scripture will somehow point it to jesus christ so with that in mind in psalms the 22nd chapter uh let's start with verse 14 and we'll read down through i think it's 20. he said i am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels my strength is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue cleaves to the roof of my jaws and thou hast brought me into the dust of death for dogs have compassed me about the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me they have pierced my hands my feet so we know automatically this is talking about jesus christ so let's continue i may tell all my bones they look they stare at me they part my garments among them they cast lots upon my vesture be thou not far from me o lord o my strength hasty to help me and for the text tonight will take from verse 20 deliver my soul from the sword my darling from the power of the dog save me from the lion's mouth for that has turned me from the horns of the unicorns gracious heavenly father we've read thy word we ask you would just open it afresh to us let the presence of the holy spirit lord just fill each and every heart in our lives with a revelation afresh of jesus christ as we ask in in thy name amen while you're being seated i'll read from hebrews the fourth chapter very familiar verse of course for those who are followers of the message of the hour i don't know if it's that all the coffin and the sniffling everybody's got going or if it's the new flowers coming out but my if your nose runs and your feet smell you're built backwards is what i was told so anyway here we are in hebrews chapter 4 very familiar scripture in verse 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piece piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of joint and marrow and is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart may god add his blessing to the word we've been ministering off and on along the word of god and how that when the word of god comes forth and when we receive it do we have a bottle of water somewhere that i could down below we're empty tonight but how that when the word of god comes forth we know that as we mentioned every scripture has compound meaning and revelation and every spirit or every word tells us something about jesus christ thank you brother paul and i know i've showed this here before but i want to touch on it one more time we talk about the seals and the seven seals and so forth and how that uh brother louis kelson years ago preached a fantastic message about the opening of the seals and i i can't remember where he got the particular quotes but uh we know that the seals were the there was the first one and then they sealed at the second one they sealed it third one sealed it and so forth but when he got to the seventh he said he took that one and he put that seal over all of the rest and how that he had to tear the seventh one back and then the six five four three two one and then when you got back to one then you start through the other direction so and how that uh he couldn't he wouldn't tell us he was a major word prophet so he can only tell us what the word says and the word says there was silence in heaven for the space of a half an hour so he could only tell us silence how do you speak silence right so but he did give us some little clues one place he said the seventh seal is jesus christ another place he said it is the rapture which of course it is because jesus said i am the resurrection and the rapture so our resurrection and our rapture is tied into our love affair with jesus christ if you don't have him on the inside it doesn't matter when it happens or how it happens you're not you're just not going to be there you're not going to see it you're not going to know because it also says that you know it's coming as a thief in the night so every word of god expresses somehow the nature of jesus christ and as we look through the scripture we see that all of these things relate of course to our day and our age because we're the ones that are called as the song wonderful song you were singing about this is the age this is the going home age this is the time this is where we we got to the corner and brother branham said if you don't turn the corner you know you just go off into destruction if you ever want an interesting study brother dave go into proverbs chapter 7 and 5 find out who's standing at the corner and what happens when you meet her at the corner so but with the water we've talked about the word of god being transitive and how we this water just became transitive because he moved it from that room to here and i moved it from here and into me thank you wonderful so what just happened we moved the water and many scriptures many many scriptures if we get into the what that says about them it says they're transitive meaning that they can be moved from one place to another so you can take these scriptures that are written in ink and you can move them you can i can move them this way and this way or we can move them from here to here or here to here or here to here and when they come to hear then they should come back out here because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks and so they become transitive words so the water became transitive you know where it went it's pretty obvious in fact it tastes good so i'm going to have a little more but what else happened the water became part of me and i became part of the water that's again that's obvious and we know with but there's something else that just happened that you couldn't hear it i mean you might have heard me swallow the water but you don't see this next part you didn't hear it you can't really see it even though you saw me drink it but what really happens with the water is human beings can't survive without water so in this water that i'm drinking is another feature that you can't see taste hear smell or touch for a human being it's life and it's silent you don't see the water i mean the life that's in the water move into me and bring life into my body friends it's the seventh seal it's the life of god being transferred he said come unto me and drink and he said i'll give you a drink that you'll never thirst again and when you drink this water and it goes into your heart the life comes with it the life of jesus christ begins to transfer itself into us by the drink that we take from the word of god amen and we become partakers of the seventh seal which is jesus christ and which is our rapture and a multitude of other things but it's the life being transferred from the word into your my heart that we might become by the spoken word the sons and daughters of god or be manifested as what we've always have been the life that we had with him before the foundation of the world so with those things in mind but another thing comes with that life there's the nature behind the life especially when you start to get into the word of god now we read there we know that's that particular uh portion of scripture there in psalms 22 we know that's talking about calvary they pierced my hands they did this and i am poured out like water and i think we ministered a few years ago about how that christ was poured out at calvary jehovah god poured himself out to us through jesus christ and all those things are the nature of god being expressed but it was expressed in prophecy first and from that prophecy they put it into writing and from that writing then we go back and we can look and say oh because we know the history we can go oh they pierced his hands his side his feet and that's and so we see the nature [Music] of these words manifested in jesus christ and as we receive that so likewise we receive the nature behind those words so as we think about those things and i read there from psalms 22 and how the the nature of god is in the words lord willing we'll get to uh if he grants me a little grace this evening so we read we're reading there about calvary and how he talks about i'm dried up like a potsherd in my tongue cleaves to my jaws i brought to the dust of death we know all of those things are almost you know like a news report of jesus christ at calvary and he comes down there but then he says this interesting thing there he says be not far from me o lord my strength haste thee to help me well we know at one point he cries out in fact i think it's even in this same psalm earlier on yeah in fact it starts verse one my god my god why hast thou forsaken me so and and such and so but here he's saying you know be not far from me o lord my strength hasty to help me and so he's calling out for this and the word of god is expressing itself and it's moving as it were giving us this picture in prophecy form of what's happening at calvary and the life of god being poured out the the word of god being poured out through jesus christ because he is the word of god then he comes down to this 20th verse and i found this really interesting because he said deliver my soul from the sword if we were given a message to tonight i would use that as a title deliver my soul from the sword as human beings when we hear or when i hear something like that i'm usually thinking that somebody's chasing me coming after me with the sword i'm gonna work me over and that's what you know lord deliver me from the sword i don't want to go down by the sword i don't brother branham said he didn't like swords he said he was afraid of him he was glad that he wasn't born in that age because he didn't want to ever have to use one so what's the lord putting his hand a sword but it's a different kind of sword he said when he said you know what and he said it's the sword of the king the king not a king but the king and so we see the nature of god he says deliver my soul from the sword we know that jesus christ is the word of god i read there from hebrew the word of god is sharp as a two-edged sword let's read it again we can bring it up are you in a hurry tonight i just i love the word of god i really do he said the word of god is sharp chapter 4 verse 12. he said the word of god is quick and powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit the joints the marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart so the word of god is quick it's powerful sharper than a two-edged sword and where does it cut to it even defy divides asunder the spirit and the soul and then he goes on to say the joints and the marrow which are parts of the body and and and so on but many people out there there's an anointing available for anybody that wants it he said my spirit will be poured out on a double l all flesh anybody everywhere has access to the spirit of god in this day and age that's why the message anointed ones at the end time become so important i remember brother sandy beach i don't think i mentioned this last time but we were in panama a few years back and we were he uh we'd been talking a little bit about anointing and so on and when we got back to the little hotel room we had he had some music on oh my it's beautiful anointed beautiful music oh my and i'm standing about from here brother trevor there i'm going to see andy that's that is really anointed music he said yeah i know it's pretty isn't it and i said yeah and he said come and look at this and he turns the computer around you should have seen the people that were singing it they had them funny shoes on and then little skirts and the hair no hair and you know and so on and the guys were you know had i don't know it was a mess so we realize anybody that wants to come under that anointing can do it in fact it's so powerful that even some people that don't realize it that's why we go to we look at hollywood brother branham said all inspiration is of god but what they do with it depends on where they're going and what side they're on and that's why you see things like you know terrible judgments and earthquakes and bombs and wars and rapes and all kinds of those things in the movies because that's what's in their heart but they are bringing that forth to reveal what's in them and they take an inspiration from god and then they express it in that way through those movies and all those things and we begin to realize it's false christ it's a genuine absolute true anointing of the word of god or or the spirit of god that it doesn't carry the soul of god with it and the holy spirit is given to us to sharper than a two-edged sword to divide between the spirit and the soul brother branham said the soul is becomes the nature of the spirit he said it's the soul is the nature of the spirit so when you realize that it's not just the anointing that we come for as christians but we want to have the nature behind that holy spirit and the nature is this it is the word of god is the nature of god expressed and so he uses this scripture we realize that the holy spirit is given to us so that we can discern the difference between just an anointing and having the nature of jesus christ it divides between the spirit and the soul so that when we come up to something maybe it's a you know i've been a few churches where oh my i was anointed but when you you know the guy started preaching i'm going how do i get out of this place because it didn't have the nature of this it had a some kind of a denominational thing or something else or that spirit of man had attached itself to that holy ghost and he was given man's doctrines man's dogmas or look at me i'm the great guy i'm not the great guy jesus christ is and if people you know i heard a guy i hate to say this but claim to be in the message of the hour a few years ago and uh but he came up with a certain revelation he said if you don't have this revelation you can't go in the rapture sorry friend you're antichrist because of anything but if it takes anything besides the blood and the power of jesus christ that's the antichrist it only takes jesus christ in the form of the word living in me amen and it doesn't take some special revelation of yours for me to get there and if you're standing between me and jesus christ you're an idol it's antichrist stay with the word stay with the nature of the word and so as we look at that and then we go back to psalms where we've just read and he's talking there about calvary and the nature of god and then he makes that statement in what i better take this little thing if i keep jumping back and forth i'll spend half the night looking for it there we go he said deliver my soul from the sword and then he has the two little dots so you know that after that sir there's a time spring a time frame brother branham said those two dots and he mentioned a place or two where you know he said there's two thousand years between those two little dots so you have deliver my soul from the sword well and like i said i tend to think of it as uh trying to keep you know from getting killed by the sword and such but when we're talking about the sword it said you know he said the word of god is powerful like a two-edged sword and then in revelations 1 and chapter 6 he makes another interesting statement about the sword i get that oh 116 i think it is yeah no that can't be right i wrote it down wrong but it says that out of his mouth proceeds a two-edged sword um oh i'm in first john no wonder i can't find it praise the lord see these glasses are getting all scratched up my wife and i keep talking about getting new ones and well praise the lord the doctor told me my arms has just grown too short but yes one and verse 16 and and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth when a two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not i am the first and the last. and so we see a different sword he said when i saw him when john you know i know it says there in the caption at the top of the book of revelation that says you know the revelation of john it's not the revelation of john because in the first verse i said it's the revelation of jesus christ it's the revelation that jesus christ got after the birth life death of burial and resurrection and the ascension jesus now returns to john as an ascended god in a vision and says okay this is my revelation john or the revelation of me depending on how you view it and so here is john looking at this and he said i fell at his feet as dead and so on but it says that out of his mouth proceeded like you know a two-edged sword yes one back there we go and so this sword when he said deliver my soul from the sword compound meaning compound revelation what are we talking about what every scripture points us to jesus christ he's just described himself going to calvary in spirit or prophecy form through the psalmist david and he comes down and he gives us all those details and then he comes to that verse and said deliver my soul from the sword what is going on with that he has just explained to us by way of the sword out of his mouth what the soul of god was all about i am poured out like water all my bones are out of joint and they gaped upon me with their mouths all of those things are describing the soul of god the nature of god concerning us for salvation and when he says deliver me from the sword let the sword of this word deliver to us the soul of jesus christ are you with me some strange looks out there it's the word of god and he's saying deliver my soul from the sword deliver to the people from this sword what my soul is what my nature is deliver it i got that stuck in there funniness deliver my soul from the sword so praise the lord and we begin to see and he said you know the out of his mouth goes a sharp two-edged sword he begins to explain it and from that where he says that in verse 16 he continues well for one thing the next thing that happens he says you know i i when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead man who's the resurrection in the life jesus christ and when john falls as a dead man what's the nature that we see from this sword that came out of his mouth here have some resurrection john it's the nature of god expressed by the sword of the word and he also says on him it says he laid his right hand on me saying fear not i'm the first and the last. we read you know another place he said in fact back in verse 8 he said i am the alpha and the omega the beginning the ending the lord which is which was and which is to come the almighty the same yesterday today and forever out of hebrews 13 8. what are we seeing from the sword of the word he is delivering to us the nature of jesus christ he's placing in the bride of jesus christ by his word his own nature brother branham said the bride and the husband are one we go back and they became one flesh another place it says in the scripture when we read in let's in fact let's look at john i hadn't planned to go there but it's a good one to look at get skipped over a lot from what i've seen john the first chapter we know how it starts out i'm the beginning was the word word was with god the word was god same in the beginning with god so on all things were made by him he's the life he's the light of man so on and coming down and then a lot of times we'll drop down almost you know many times to verse 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld his glory as the only god begotten of the father full of grace and truth but we just skipped verse 12. and verse 12 says but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name to as many as believed him well i just told you in the first verse he's the word he's the word and we know that he's also brings with him that anointing that spirit of the holy ghost that's what he poured back after he ascended if i don't go away disciples uh it's best that i go away because if i don't go away i can't send the holy ghost back to you which is jesus the same jesus christ in a different form the form of the holy ghost and in that form of the holy ghost what do we see begin to be manifested the nature of jesus christ with your receiving of jesus christ comes in nature just the same way as drinking this water gives me the life that's in the water jesus told the woman at the well hey give me a drink she says you got nothing to draw with and the world's deep he said but if you knew who you were talking to do you know who we're talking to remember what he asked peter who do men say that i am jesus said well you're the christ the son of the living god who do we say that he is he's the life the truth the way he is the word of god he is god the manifest nature of almighty god through jesus christ through the word of god when you drink of this word we drink of the nature of jesus christ and in verse 12 he says as many as received him that's a personal presence of jesus christ there's a doctrine out there they call it perugia it's an absolute true doctrine but it's not a doctrine it's the personal presence of jesus christ in my life in your life it's not just a doctrine i don't care what they tell you it's the personal expression that you have with jesus christ who do you say that he is he's my life he's my everything without him i have nothing without him there was nothing of me even created except he creates it and how does he create ask what you will as many as received him what did he do to them that's the ones of us that received him he gave power power to become the sons of god to them that believe on his name and brother branham said the name and the word are the same thing so how do you receive power we sing about old power oh lord let the power do you know what are we actually singing about i want to receive him the fullness of the nature of god that he had prepared for me and for you before the foundation of the world before there was a world before there was even time we say we have eternal life eternal life had no beginning it had no ending it's god and it's the life of god that we receive when we receive him that power to become sons of god to them that believe on his name i believe him i don't always look like it if you're looking at this stuff this is dirt man this dirt came out of an unregented rated world this world has not been regenerated it has not received its fiery holy ghost baptism it received water baptism when they you know in the days of noah typified when the children went through the red sea but it takes this world has to have a fiery baptism too heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass it can't because it has received the power to become the sons and daughters of god which are eternal creatures this bible tells us so we see the word of god and we see the nature of god and if we understand the nature of god as i understand it then he gives us certain promises and with those promises there are benefits that the world has no clue even what we're talking about i run into people now and then and they you know they know certain quotes random talked about the spoken word and you know he preached spoken word as the original seed and uh some other messages and things along that side those those things and uh i i heard somebody it's been a few years back now and they said oh when the spoken word gets here it's going to be so world so wonderful and i said where in the world have you been my kids are using the spoken word and they know they're using the spoken word and i i think of the testimony of my you know michelle i think most many of you know her and how that they said she could never had children they'd been married seven years they said no way not going to happen they said she had a growth inside of her under i think on her ovaries or something and they wanted to do surgery and she calls up we were living over in elkton there at the time i was cutting logs on the coast and jonathan was helping me cut some logs and he was there and she was all shook up because they wanted to go and do surgery and we're listening you know and i as you know the dad i said well we'll we'll be praying and stuff and and i said don't worry about it god can take care of his stuff jonathan takes the phone he says michelle how do you want it and she goes what and he goes how do you want it speak it so michelle speaking now says i want to go through with the surgery but when they get in there i want them to find nothing there and when it's over i want them to tell me there's no reason i can't have children it happened exactly as she spoke it the next day she went in for the surgery the doctors got angry because they're looking at all these x-rays and they're going there's nothing there they thought somebody gave them the wrong x-rays because these aren't right there's nothing there and then they told her there's no reason you can't have children well we got matthew now from that one you know praise the lord what was it we're praying under the spirit jonathan says speak she spoke a son of god to a daughter of god she spoke what she wanted and jesus christ backed up their words amen your words it's been going on time after time after time i've seen it but i'm not here you know to just testimony service but i've seen it happen so many times it's amazing and sometimes without us even knowing i'll give one more quick when i was leaving mauritius the island there we'd been over on madagascar and i'm getting ready to go home from mauritius and preach to service and you know still kind of under the anointing and stuff and i i get kind of loopy i don't know how you know paul and david handle it her brother there in the back but i like to pray or believe god until i see it but it's not a vision i can't explain it to you but it's in front of me now and then i just tell you what i see in here and so i'm kind of you know and all these people are there wanting to uh you know hug you and ask all these questions and you know the french they're doing the two kiss thing and and i'm like whoa whoa i'm bumping noses with these guys because the the spanish they like to shake your hand twice once on each side and these guys like to do that so i you know bumped my face a couple times and they're kind of laughing at me and they're asking well you know where you know how are you going home or whatever well actually i had a really complicated set of tickets for that trip home and i explained it to the first one i go from mauritius to dubai to london to new york to new jersey to salt lake to seattle how do you explain that quickly in a line when people are going like this and about every third one is asking you how are you going home so i just said i go to new york to seattle that's just me because i'm tired and i'm bumping noses and you know that's what came out of my mouth right so well it sort of happened like that because i went you know i did the first leg i think i might have said london new york at home but anyway so i get to new york get on the taxi cab because the next flight was out of new jersey i get down there slept in the airport that night because it was an early flight and the next flight to salt lake is i'm getting ready to go up to the counter they pull it i'm going uh what happened to that flight and the guy goes you were supposed to be on that flight and i said yeah yeah yeah i had to make my connection to seattle and he goes oh no he was ah the plane had something went wrong with it sitting out on the runway and they're not gonna fly it so he'd here have a ticket here here's a ticket to ride the taxi cab back to new york and fly home direct to seattle which is what i said new york to seattle well it never had occurred to me this is what i spoke because you know i'm like and so i get there well one more little piece here when i was getting off the plane the first time coming in from london i was you know i walked through first class i'm going wow this is this looks really nice but i can't do that to people you know i mean your brother branham said it's the nickels and the dimes and the things that the people put in the offering that make the meaning successful i never could bring myself to get a first class ticket but i thought just a thought you know just thinking wow that might would be nice sometime right so now taxi cab back to new york and when i go to get on the airplane he said oh as i was leaving new jersey he said by the way i bumped you to first class for your trouble i'm going first class i mean i know paul understands he's walked through there too [Laughter] so i get there and sure enough i just barely made it in time and we got on the airplane here i am in first class and flew to seattle and i don't recommend it because every 50 i was so tired i just wanted to sleep and every 10 minutes they're they're asking if you want something i just wanted to go to sleep i tried to sleep so but and i didn't even realize until i'm getting off the airplane in seattle and i'm looking back going you know what just happened here and i'm going to something just said did not you say did not you say you were going to go there to there to there and i said i did and did not you want to see what first class was well praise the lord and people say they're waiting for the spoken word it's been here ever since the day that the the angel of the lord told the brother branham sister hattie wright a sister represents a church and the spoken words on the prophet he said tell her what she says she can have it and that anointing moved on to that church and it's been here ever since for those that can believe it and use it accordingly so the nature of god he trusts us so much with his divine nature that you're not going to ask for something that is harmful or hurtful we will only ask the things that are pleasing to the lord we need one more shot of this praise the lord so those things being said let's take a look at first samuel chapter 21. we're talking about the nature of god expressed by the word of god or from the mouth of god or from the sword of god in first samuel chapter 21 and i'm sure you've read this it's a wonderful stretch of scripture and at this point david is running from saul scared for his life your next anointed king and he's scared it's okay to be scared you know with all the kovids and all the other nonsense going on in the world it's okay to be scared david's an anointed king and he's scared he's running for his life and he gets down here to the high priest or to the priest it says then david 21 verse 1 then david k then came david to knob to him elect the priest and himelec was afraid to meet of the meeting of david and said unto him why art thou alone and no man with thee not only david is afraid so is the priest what are you doing here by yourself because he knew that you know david had armies of guys and stuff around him all the time right so he says uh david says to him like the priest the king hath commanded me a business and hath said unto me let no man know anything of this business whereabout i send thee and what have i commanded thee and i have appointed my servants to such and such a place did david just lie to him is that how we're reading this the king had commanded me in business no saul's trying to kill him and so if you read it from a natural standpoint david just slide to the priest that's not something you should really be doing i'm serious you know you don't go and lie to the pastor hey brother paul by the way no but what if you read it compound meaning compound revelation what king is he talking about because you go back to samuel i think it's 17 was where he's anointed maybe it's yeah i think it's 17 you know verse or chapter 16 he says and the lord said unto samuel how long will thou mourn for saul seeing i have rejected him from reigning over israel god's mind salt salt's not the king anymore and he says uh fill thy horn with oil goes i send thee to jesse the beth might for i have provided me a king among the sons who's going to be the king who's me who's the me that's talking through samuel god is going to provide himself as a king out of those sons of samuel so who is going to express himself his nature through who through whoever becomes king god himself provided me a king and that's the word of the lord and the word of the lord comes to samuel even says the word of the lord comes to samuel and in fact back in chapter 3 i think it is where samuel says the word of the lord was revealed to samuel in shiloh that's how samuel received god was by the word now the word comes and says i'm going to make me a king among those sons well we know what happened rejected rejected rejected samuel had a little trial i'm sure wait a minute i know god sent me here and they've all been rejected and he had a devil just like we did trying to ha-ha samuel you just thought you heard from the lord jesse don't you have one more yeah i got one more but he's out with the sheep man no foot whoosh flunky david was the foot wish lucky and he comes in you don't smell good he doesn't look good his brothers are going our little brother hey they had flesh too they weren't all great super spiritual giants and they're looking our little brother the one in the sheepskins and the dirty feet and the but god looks at something different because he wants to be king and this is the one that can provide me as a king how many times you expose through scripture we look at king david and see jesus christ over and over and over and over we can look at the life of david and see jesus christ even when he fell with bathsheba number one bathsheba means i believe it's the we mentioned it last time the daughter of the promise or the daughter of the oath i think it is and even david when he goes up on that rock because he loses his kingdom because of adultery jesus christ swept on the same rock because the sin of adultery in the garden of eden even in his sin we can see jesus christ in david because the bible said jesus christ became sin for you and i we're talking about delivering the soul by from the sword so the word or the sword of the lord we can look into these words and see the life of jesus christ over and over as god is showing himself as a king we know that well let's just read on a little bit there from verse 21 and i'll close so you can get home and david said unto him like okay uh pick it up there verse three he said now therefore what is under thine hand give me five loaves of bread in my hand and and what the or what there is present the priest answers david and said there's no common bread under my hand but there is hallowed bread if these young men have kept themselves there is a little space of time in between there so apparently a few men of davids have showed up too because he said if the young men have kept themselves uh at least from the women david answered and uh said unto him of truth these have been kept from about these three days and i came out the vessels the young men are holy and the bread is a manner of communion so we're just kind of going through this sequence of how the priest gives priestly bread to david okay that's what's happening here and it said as sanctified this day in the vessel so the priest gives him the hallowed bread and there was no bread there in the except the shoe bread and that was taken before the lord put in the hot bread that day was taken away so what just happened david is a king shouldn't be eating the shoe bread he tells him this is only for the priests but even though it appears that david lied to him the king is expressing him through itself through david and he is the high priest so the priest gives the bread of the high priest to the priest that's in david and jesus the night that he was be prayed he took bread and he broke it and said this is my body which is broken for you and so we have the priest giving the bread to david the bread of the pre and it actually cost this priest his life when saul found out about it i think it's a little later verse or chapter 23 or 27 i don't remember but so he comes to there and uh and it mentions that there's a servant of saul there dog the edomite chief of the herd and so on and he sees it happen that's how saul finds out later but in verse eight and david said in a himalaya that there is is there not here under thy hand a spear or a sword i have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with because the king's business required haste now what king is he talking about him his business because saul's been rejected and now he is officially king even though he's running for his life and he said i had to get here and hurry i didn't bring any weapons with me and so you don't normally go to church or to the priest to find your weapons i don't think no nothing under there brother paul yeah the weapons of our warfare those kinds are all right and so he says and the priest says the sword of goliath the philistine whom thus slew in the valley of ela behold it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod if thou will take that take it for there is no other save that one here watch what david says there's not that's the only one that's here there's none other one save that one and david said there's none like it none like that give it to me give it to me well for one thing where is it i don't i didn't wear a coat tonight it's wednesday right but if i had my coat i'd hang it here on the front and say okay this is the ephod hanging on the front of the altar and the arm and thumb and then would go on the front of the ephod on the breastplate and behind that is the altar now he just tells david that's the only one here david says there's none like it give it to me but he says it's wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod if that will take it so if the ephod's hanging on the altar and the sword is behind the ephod under the altar and he pulls it out and the priest hands it to david and he said it's wrapped it's wrapped here in a cloth behind the ephod take it and he pulls it out from behind the altar he hands it to david now we know that david has called a man after god's own heart he wants the heart of god in him he wants to have god's heart manifest for in fact i think it's in the book of acts when stephen is about to get stoned he mentions it and how that if it's not stephen anyway it's in the book of acts go look at that you ever forget stuff brother i just know it's in the book of acts but and how that he wants to have the heart of god now he got this sword by killing goliath and we know that after he killed goliath he took that same sword and severed goliath's head right remember that part which we know is a direct well let's go to genesis you said you're not in a hurry genesis chapter 49 when he's speaking here this is jacob speaking to his sons by way of prophecy 49 verse 8 judah thou art he whom thy brethren shalt so 49 verse 8 there we are thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee that's the prophecy to judah it continues on about the lion of the tribe of judah but this particular prophecy brother adam told us this stuff isn't in chronological order in fact god will say something here and then he says something over here and it's actually maybe this way and so he says and this is a prophecy who so who's speaking well it's jacob right no it's god speaking through jacob because it's a prophecy and it's in the book judah so he's this is prophecy the nature of god is being expressed into judah in the beginning god created that's his personality that's his nature and so now god speaking to judah tells him thou art he those who thy brother thy brothers shall praise did they praise david after he killed goliath saul killed his thousands and david killed his ten thousands and which saul didn't like it actually and so what do we see they david could have said that day this day the scripture is fulfilled before your eyes but then it continues not necessarily in order thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies when you look this actually up it means to sever the head of the enemy it's not talking about a nice massage or even holding them by the back of the neck it means you're cutting the head off of thine enemies when david took the sword this day this scripture's fulfilled and my father's children shall bow down before thee and you go over into chronicles when judah had already anointed him king and israel comes back to him and said david we want you to be king to unite israel with judah and they bowed before him that day that scripture was fulfilled and the heart of god was being expressed in david so now back to a himalaya and that sword it said that there's none david said give it to me there's none like it and the priest hands david the sword if we could have that one back it's 21 i think 12 or something like that first samuel 21 verse 9 there's none like it give it to me and the priest hands the sword to david and it's wrapped and david is a man after god's own heart what did he just get from the heart of the altar he receives the sword from the priest here david you fought for it you earned it it's yours what was god really telling us about his nature and the heart of god and there were in the same country shepherds keeping watch over their flocks by night and lo the angel of the lord appeared unto them and said fear not for behold this day is born to you a savior whose name is christ the lord because they were sore afraid and he said fear not and he said for unto you is born this day and you shall find the babe lying in a manger wrapped in swaddling cloth what's the heart of god what is the sword of god wherein do we receive the soul it's from the sword of the word when god expressed his nature through jesus christ he wrapped it he wrapped that little sword a little baby in a swaddling cloth here's the sword david this is what you prophesied of this is what your life was all about and believe me i wrapped it in your life i doubt if david even knew half of it he probably was he was running for his life are you out of here they're going to kill me and think about when he you know in front of the cave that day and how he had to climb over those guys to get out of there scared for his life but he became a holder of the sword the wrapped sword which we know is jesus christ who cut the head off of death hell in the grave who cuts the head off of every enemy one last scripture i don't have a clue what time it is praise the lord hebrews chapter 2. do you love him it'll be wonderful and to know that he's just he's wrapped himself in all of this i call it stuff right and all of this stuff and all of these words and all of these things it's it's all jesus christ and if you can't brother branham said there's types and shadows and then there's anti-types and i don't ever never under really stood anti-types but there's anti-types and then there's types of types and types of types of brother branham said i'm just a typologist but in hebrews chapter 2 what was it when david you know went before goliath and his court you know his big shot brothers with all their military honors and stuff they're all hiding from goliath you know they've all got their heads down and david jumps up on the rock what's the matter with you guys why is that uncircumcised philistine defy the army of the living god what was that that's the heart of a king that's the heart of the king telling them why are you hiding from that uncircumcised philistine i can tell you why they were hiding it says it right here verse 14 chapter 2 hebrews something to be learned here actually for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same who did christ did jesus god himself in flesh the word of god in flesh took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through the fear of death for all their lifetime subject to bondage why were they afraid why were they hiding behind the rocks and the trees and even saul's way back up there in his tent going oh man what are we going to do i don't want to be slaves to the philistines what were they afraid of it was the fear of the power of death because in the garden he said the day you eat thereof you shall die well we know elijah didn't and enoch didn't and what did they overcome what did they overcome we know that it says enoch pleased god we know that he knocked out a testimony he read that testimony in the book of jude said enoch prophesied this they overcame their fear of death you have to go back and look at elijah again and see what compelled them how was it they were able to because it says here jesus became that took it all on so that we who were in bondage we could be delivered from the fear of death because all their lives all of our lives we have been in bondage to the fear not death itself brother branham just said he dies for a christian you don't really even die you just step into a different position so it's not death itself it's the fear of death that holds us here deliver my soul from the sword let this sword so live in us that we be delivered from the fear of death that we can walk out over the top of it with its head cut off for the bride of jesus christ by the sword of the word god bless you let's stand we sing that song again sister god bless you that was beautiful gracious heavenly father i love you lord i realize if your person looks at the the negative they look at this body they look at the things of this body of these bodies lord jesus born in sin shaped and iniquity came into the world speaking lies because of the lie in the garden of eden but there is truth there is a truth that you took on death that you could destroy the fear of death by the sword of the lord let these words tonight sink deep into the hearts of your people as each one of us would receive our own little sword our own little word that will propel us as the word of the lord propelled david it propelled a shepherd boy to become a king [Music] a little shepherd boy walked out the next day with the sheep hey here's your king but one day he fulfilled the throne because your word said you would become king and you would show us your kingship through his life as he received a wrapped sword may you wrap your sword tonight in a new set a swaddling cloth we call it the bride of jesus christ wrap your sword once again lord [Music] let it shine from the hearts as it said in the book of ezekiel it's furbished and it's sharpened to make slaughter may it slaughter every enemy in the lives of your people the ones here tonight whoever would hear this may you take your sword destroy every enemy by the breath of their mouth because you said it'd be by the breath of your mouth transfer that life i am the truth the life and the way you're our way lord you're our way out of this flesh and out of this planet as we know it as i give you this service tonight god we love you i just we love you jesus expressed that love in our hearts and lives we ask in jesus christ's name as we sing it once more [Music] in moments like these i sing out a song i sing out a love song to jesus [Music] drink brother sister he's here drink [Music] love you lord [Music] you quietly now in moments i [Music] to jesus [Music] please [Music] see [Music] you

time thank you so much for coming out listening to us tonight thank you brother paul god bless you brother david brother god bless you sing in love beautiful sister thank you lord god bless you thank you [Music] [Music] just doing some reading and that sword was there behind the ephod wrapped jesus christ was wrapped in the cradle and though the prophet does not speak it in these exact words he spoke to us in our generation that the word was wrapped in simplicity not to look into the complicated not to look into the theology not to think that we had to be of great mental capacity but the word wrapped in simplicity and brother branham said the dwells in simplicity he's amongst his people in simplicity and he titled a sermon even that he hides himself in simplicity and reveals himself in the same and when you take my brother and sister in the whole realm of the things that god has done created heaven and earth all the supernatural we are the simple expression of god not complicated we don't have to have a great explanation we just have as brother david preached tonight got to just let it live out just let it come out and if we will just let it it will amen isn't that so beautiful and he says that god hiding himself in simplicity then revealing himself in the same so it's right there before us it's so simple so beautiful you know another thought that struck me while he was speaking for generations upon generations upon generations upon generations upon generations and i could just keep going the word has always produced what god said it would aren't you glad we can sit here in this day right now and just know that we are the very expression of god wrapped up my brother and sister how beautiful brother david i appreciated that that was beautiful very very beautiful thought amen just so happy so i'm just going to let brother jason lead us in a song or two here and god bless you please pray for me i still don't feel good amen [Music] hey man he enjoyed that tonight one thing i appreciate about the ministry here is we just don't read the scriptures and the preaching starts we actually break down the scriptures i've really enjoyed that for me i'm just one of those visual learners so i really really enjoyed it blesses me the song that comes to mind i know we sing a lot but so glad i'm yours lord so glad i'm yours [Music] that was d that was close so glad i'm yours lord [Music] so glad i'm yours so glad your mercy has followed me so glad you found me and you set me free so glad i'm yours lord so glad i'm yours so glad i'm yours lord so glad i'm yours so glad your mercy has followed me so glad you found me and you set me free [Music] so glad i'm yours glad i as we're dismissing one last time so glad i'm yours lord so glad i'm yours so glad
