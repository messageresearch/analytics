i do this why did i say that why did i think that just remember he's working on you and remember he said this work i began i will finish so we couldn't finish it if we wanted to so he is doing that work and how beautiful amen god bless you brother scott sister kristen's dad and brother scott we are gonna maybe make this the time we quit identifying you as sister kristen's dad you are simply our brother scott is with us and we are so happy to have him here amen uh just pray god bless you in this time with your family and we forgot to put it in the prayer request please remember my uh daughter jolyn's sister jolin uh woke up this morning with a migraine and uh you know the devil he just likes to slip in when he can and just cause a problem and and uh you know we'll just rebuke him in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you brother sergey glad to see you home amen well you know we don't celebrate this christmas season like a bunch of pagans right amen but did you enjoy the time it is to me saints i you know you know you notice i never preached a single sermon about christmas you see to me it's not about saying oh oh christ in the manger we know the prophet showed us clearly in the word lambs are born in the spring amen he wasn't born in a snow bank somewhere hallelujah but we'll take this just the same approach as we take easter it's not about bunnies and eggs and whatever else so to us it means something entirely different than to the world amen we're out here it is to me let me just put it in that way that way if you want to chunk it chunk it but um it's just a season that kind of comes and says you know what um time to give a nice gift to someone a little season a reason you might say to just do something kind or share something and um you know it's such a point my brother and sister that that you know if we're not careful we kind of tend to find ourselves being pulled back in to the view that the world has of christmas and uh let's just not forget amen that the reason for our season amen is jesus christ and that season is 365 days long hallelujah so don't just use this time you feel something on your heart to give a gift to say thank you to say i love you it can be any day of the year you don't have to wait for that one specific day so well saints i'm going to do something today that i have uh not really done before uh i am going to preach to you a sermon that i preached one week ago in evening like tabernacle in phoenix but the burden of this thought is heavy upon me uh it is something that i feel that needs to be spoken here also as we were coming up had this invitation to um to minister there in phoenix this thought come upon me and i could not shake it i think i even voiced it in the message there in phoenix that you kind of feel good there's so many good things my brother and sister and you kind of think well we'll go down there we'll preach them happy and people remember how that brother paul come to phoenix and he just preached such a happy you know we all shouted and went away happy or we can be made happy by being ready for the rapture and so we can satisfy the flesh and being able to say well that was wonderful i could verify every quote every idea everything and i just went away feeling so free or we can be forced to the edges of our boundaries tested to our limits caused to think outside of our normal realm and then realize with joy in our heart i'm being made ready for a rapture and so i i just uh uh uh just wanted to put that as a preface to you today that you would know uh if by chance you knew someone or something come up you'd say hey wait brother paul is just plagiarizing himself it is on purpose sister jerry i will throw her under the bus this morning when i said i feel led to preach that again she said you're a lazy preacher and amen sister jerry did you not say that and uh but i feel this upon my heart saints and so i want to give this to you up front to tell you i might be preaching you today like something's inadequate in you something there's a fault there's a failure there's something but i want you to understand that i am here today going to preach very direct to you but i'm here to stir up your pure minds in remembrance this is not like you could go away today and say i think brother paul thinks we're all going to miss the rapture no not at all i want to stir up to you in your pure minds the recollection of the fact that the things we're going to speak on today can happen here and if we are not cognizant if we are not careful if we are not making sure that our lamp is trimmed and clear and full each and every day this could be us that's what i want to stir your minds today if we'll stand we'll go right in the word thank you for the jason musicians amen aren't you thankful amen for the gifts that god has given in the body amen sometimes the gift is just a matter of saying amen that is truly actually more of a gift than you might imagine amen so as we'll look at this i want to start by reading second peter first second peter the third chapter first and second verses just to start off in our thought this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and savior so once again just to lay that foundation that we're here this morning amen no pastor will save you unfortunately we have a little thing that ripples through the message every once in a while that people have an idea that if we just acknowledge that god sent a prophet that that somehow is an absolute game-changer you can go on youtube if you care to and you'll find people will talk about the supernatural ministry of brother branham but don't do one thing to follow it okay i want you to understand we're not speaking down to the prophet we're actually speaking up to him when we say you know what god sent him that voice my brother and sister was to turn us to jesus christ and so we many people i've been accused of it actually right here in the foyer of this church accused of putting brother branham down but to me my brother and sister i'm sorry it shows their lack of understanding because you see brother branham himself said i came to point you to jesus christ so for us to look to christ in christ alone is actually to acknowledge we're believing what the prophet taught us amen in no way does that put brother branham to the side no way does that you know put him down or dismiss him but when someone tells you something and you believe them my brother and sister that's a great compliment to ignore what someone would share when he said thou sayeth the lord to ignore that my brother and sister is actually putting the prophet down but to believe the word that he brought is actually you see i'm not much of a man worshiper i just really struggle with that went through that that dose when i was a child sister sue's smiling real big here she knows what that is we're not men worshipers so we got to find the balance ourself of where do we put each and every one right well the scripture says to love your brother your sister your neighbor as yourself now if you hate yourself you can get by treating them terribly and justify but the scripture goes on to say no man hateth his own flesh you see god help us god help us okay well let's just turn in luke the 16th chapter today amen and i want to take my thought out of this and we will expound upon it by god's grace there was a certain rich man now my brother and sister if you'll go study i guess you would call it theology they believe that this rich man is the rich young ruler many people in the world of theology make a connection that this is a rich young ruler i have voiced it to you so i've now influenced you on that but i don't want you to absolutely say brother paul said but i'm telling you that you can see where this rich young ruler come to a place in his life where he said i i've done all of the things you've told me i want to lay this platform for you he says i've done all that you told me but when jesus told him sell all thou hast you realize those words were just as important as all the words previous to that you can say oh i'm following the great revelations of jesus christ but if he tells you lay down your life and you refuse to you may as well not bothered with everything else because you've now found the one word in the word that you refuse to follow oh god help us this is how tricky satan can be that we can come to a point well that's an opinion is it there was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple fine linen and fared sumptuously every day and there was a certain beggar named lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores now he wasn't at the joneses gate he was at this rich man's gate i don't think there's any question god ordained that to be so amen laid at his gate full of sores and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table moreover the dogs came and licked his sores and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried now my brother and sister if we didn't go any farther than verse 22 we will see the stark difference of the transformation of death one is carried by the angels into the bosom of abraham and the other one buried do you realize my brother and sister if the lord tarries every one of us will be buried but do you realize in the very i what is the right word it just passed by me so quickly here in the very essence of death sons and daughters of god come right in the presence of almighty amen we we don't go in the ground and rot and then one day god comes amen that might be our bones that's there might be identified as this is the resting place of so and so but you see the scripture so clearly right here says that uh the beggar died laos earth and carried by the angels abraham's rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments and seeth abraham afar off and lazarus in his bosom and he cried and said father abraham have mercy on me send lazarus and he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am tormented in this flame and i see brother chris took the leftovers of his water bottle or i'd make an example if you're thirsty amen just how much quenching power is of the water that could rest or reside on the tip of your finger wouldn't do much for even a natural thirst would it amen brother will we move on please amen but abraham said son remember that thou in thy lifetime receiveth thou good things and likewise lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and thou art tormented and beside all this between us and you there is a great goal fixed so that they which would pass from hints to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from thence then he said i pray thee therefore father that thou would ascend him to my father's house for i have five brethren that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of torment and abraham saith unto him they have moses and the prophets let them hear them amen as we move on and he said nay father abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent and he said unto him if they hear not moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded the one rose from the dead i would like to speak to you this morning on persuasion and revelation heavenly father we just ask you lord to come lord you know every need father you know every needs of our hearts of our natural life we ask you to come this morning father speak to us lord that father we just have a life-changing event lord just each day moving forward with more of you lord we love you we adore you we call upon your name and ask your father to reveal yourself to us today by your word in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated saints now as we'll look at this i want to just go back through this scripture for a moment uh this morning we'll look at this we understand uh certainly of the scripture a rich man he had everything that he needed in life he ate sumptuously it says every day and uh certainly in the holiday season can you imagine eating like that all year round amen that would be considered sumptuous right just the best of everything uh nothing spared and and so i know why we wouldn't want to eat that way because we know what we would look like if we did but um you know here's a man who just had the best and here is lazarus laying not by chance i do not believe my brother and sister how this would come about but he's laying right here at this rich man's gate and you know as you would think about this this rich man as he would pass to and from his home from his estate he would have had to have passed by lazarus now my brother and sister we are looking at a man that in our terms would be a christian we're looking at a man that that was not a heathen he was not uh someone that was just uh of the callous careless nature of of a a rich man of humanity but this was a man who uh if you would just uh let me or grant to me the privilege of just kind of uh filling in the narrative of this this is a man who went to church every week this was a man who gave to the church and he is walking by lazarus now my brother and sister we can become this callous ourselves if we are not careful where we would look at people and say you know that's just an unbeliever that's just a worldly person not just somebody you know they've said this or they've done that oh they're getting what they deserve look my brother and sister don't ever go there because you see it's not a reflection of who they are it's actually a reflection of who we are amen and if we become callous to those things then we will find that it will infect our life in such a way that we will become callous to many things and so as he come there my brother and sister what would have stopped this rich man from from stopping there at the gate and turning to one of his servants and saying you know in my wealth that god has blessed me in i want you to take this man down here to the clinic and i want you to get him some medical care i i want you to do something because he is a fellow man of mankind i can do this and not even notice it would just be a fraction of maybe my earnings for a day to to do this for him and and you know could we find uh you know food for him but you see in the callousness of we are better than they it would come to the place that this simply why i can just see it in my mind saying why would he choose my driveway can't we get the city or someone to to take him away put him on another side of town as the old phrase used to be put him on the other side of the tracks but you see god knows how to stage everything and i would tell you my brother and sister this morning god will stage things in your life in my life that will cause us to react and i pray god that we react correctly amen now we can disagree with people and i say we can bitterly or vehemently disagree with people but we can still love them can you amen to that amen we don't have to all be on the same little soapbox rubbing shoulders happy he's just like me those are called parrots we can stand firm for what we believe but yet love the person when we come to the place that we because someone would disagree with us say well they're they're lost their deceiver they are deceived they're this no my brother and sister wrong attitude wrong attitude amen so we see him now that he was desiring lazarus just desiring to receive some crumbs from this rich man's table now i don't know about you but the holidays sometimes i think kind of tend to make us a tad bit wasteful amen i think you know we have so much on the table there's ham there's turkey there there's a roast or prime rib or you know and there's pies and there's cookies and and there's all of this stuff and you've had a great feast and yet you would have just a little bit left over if you understand what i'm saying just a little bit left over and that we'll pick on salad i'm salad and i are just at a truce we're not really friends so i i don't have any bad feelings about uh doing this to mr salad but uh you know we bring it to the place we look in the bowl and we say you know we've eaten so much salad this this holiday season uh this might well sit in the fridge and spoil so we open up the trash can and scrape the last little bit of salad in there that's not just our household is it thank you you're all looking at me so solemn i was scared that it was only jerry and i that were this wasteful now i'll tell you what you don't do you don't ever come down and say man that last piece of pumpkin pie is too small to deal with no matter how small that piece of pumpkin pie is it's worth dealing with but there are certain things in our life right little jello salad little macaroni salad a little caesar a little whatever he is you know and we'll have a problem there's this scrape it away lazarus is laying in the gate wishing he could eat from the trash of a rich man look at the disparity one eating sumptuously i just have to share this with you if you don't mind a moment of of humor uh brother rich and i texting away on thanksgiving day and brother rich i don't even know how you do it maybe somebody could show me but he had this little talking pig that said we're having baby back ribs today you know where that came from so i just sent him a picture of our prime rib and he's like that's not fair well my brother and sister sometimes life is not fair so to top it all off i decided if we're not playing fair i sent him a picture of my daughter kristen's pumpkin pie and he was just like what lazarus just wanted the crumbs from our table amen oh my there's so many avenues we could go see he was just desiring even just the barest of existence of subsistence and we'd look at that and think that poor beggar there he is but my brother and sister i might get ahead of myself a little bit lazarus had something that the rich man could never have spent all of his money to have obtained who is the rich man here lazarus the beggar starving to death on the curb and dogs licking his sores was in the eyes of god the rich man amen and look how this comes about and you know when they pass it was the angels that come and got lazarus and took them away and i say lord i pray that each and every one of us is in a position in our life if we pass from this life that the angels are what carries us away hallelujah and you look and so we see how he is there in this great gulf and he's desiring now look his training my brother and sister let me fill in this narrative just a little bit he was grounded enough that when he's in hell he's looking across the gulf and he knows that is father abraham he's not there saying hey lazarus i don't know who you're with but could no father abraham father abraham i know who you are i was born in church i went to sunday school i heard the preaching of the word i was in the youth group i went to youth camp i was baptized in the name of jesus christ i've done all of this how could it be that i am here he woke up in hell and saying someone asked you the question this morning how does that happen young people please listen to me this morning give me your attention sitting in a church praying over your food going to sunday school youth group all of these things being baptized my that is not an assurance that's right you're going to heaven not opposed to each and every one of us this is why i told you i might speak kind of straight this morning i just pray that you'll follow why because i'm here as your pastor to stir up your pure mindset we don't become lazy message believers now we don't think just because we can check these things off everything is okay but here he was this rich man having his whole life look at the rich young ruler if we go ahead and tie that together he looks jesus in the face and said i have done all of these things good i can imagine jesus pat him on the back that's good now all you've got to do is sell all thou has and give it to the poor could it be that jesus saw lazarus amen maybe before lazarus even ended up at his driveway he saw him laid the foundation for him to look out there and say you know what the city's got a lot of poor people i i need to do something for him now this is purely paul's opinion okay everybody acknowledge that i believe with all of my heart the rich young ruler if he had see now god guests and callings without repentance right this young man knew how to make money and i just believe it's a personal thing i just hold some men are born to be carpenters some born to think in the abstract realm of what we would call computers and whatever because you can't see what's happening in there that's why i call it abstract right amen just a little humor because when i said this i don't know months and months ago i didn't even realize what i said i said it was full of x's and o's and and that would be saying i love you i love you i love you and too bad our computer don't love us mine has an extreme dislike for me but once it knows and all this stuff that's abstract to me i don't understand how that even works but god gave this young man a ability to make money and if he'd just caught the revelation of what jesus jesus didn't tell him go back study your scripture jesus didn't tell him i want you to go over here and be poor like all the rest of them jesus said just sell it all and give it to the poor and this is just how paul sees the scripture i see this young man calling up his investment broker well you know what today i got some investment over here in uh microsoft and i i want you to just go sell all uh 300 000 shares that i have i'm gonna donate this money to help some people and the stock broker go okay i'll do that sir it don't really make sense but let me tell you sir that uh your investment in this over here uh just quadrupled today and he would not have been and the reason i believe this saints is the scripture says you can never out-give god so here he would have been going along to the poor look at this row of beautiful poor girls and i think that would be true probably between all of them i could spend every time they have in less than five minutes so technically they'd be considered poor but you see what god does he gives to us something greater than what we can do for ourselves and you can't out give god so when we start to give to god god comes intangible and intangible and starts to reward us because he says he's a rewarder of those who diligently seek him and if we're saying lord i want to know lord what you want me to do then we are diligently seeking the will of god and he'll come and reward us for that diligence and so here he is there there god got this situation he's looking across he knows who father abraham is and he recognizes lazarus as as that man and he says can he come and dip his finger and he says no this golf is too great it can't be crossed from your side or from our side he comes down and he says you know what i i need you to do i need you to send him back to my brothers because my brothers walked up my driveway many a time they know who he is and they know he died and though he come from the dead it surely would shake them the supernatural right surely the supernatural would shake my brothers because you see the problem is they're going down this same exact path i went down we were raised in church baptized were part of this might even a taught camp might even have taught sunday school might have been part of a church board might have been part of all kinds of things and everything looks like it's just fine it looks like we're going the right way we're in church we're not heathens but father abraham tells them you know what the one came from the dead it won't move them it won't move them why because they are so determined imagine lazarus shows up at their door and he knocks and they open the door and they're like whoa that's you lazarus yes your brother sent me he's in hell and he wants you guys to change your ways and they would have said this is an evil spirit our brother gave his life to church gave millions of dollars to the church he done this and he done this this is an evil spirit and we won't receive this we rebuke you why because the platform had already been laid if you won't now i'm going to change the wording of this just a little bit saints if you won't receive the word for your hour nothing's going to change your mind did you know that's not even a defense of this message many critics that say well you're just promoting what you believe no i'm sorry let's promote what the bible said let's promote what the bible said and they won't accept what the bible says come on saints and though something supernatural would take place right in their midst they still won't believe am i clear enough i'm trying to i preached terribly terribly long in phoenix so much so at the old brothers breakfast the next morning that brother ron took me to one of the old brothers patted me on the back and said brother paul you are now in second place amongst the longest preachers in our church that didn't help me at all in fact then that brought out they said brother ron tell them the story brother ron tell them the story and brother ron's like well okay i guess i can tell them story you want to hear the story sure brother on what's the story he's telling me about a brother i believe he's from africa and how the brother was up there around the four hour mark or something like that brother ron actually had to get up and tell him brother you're at the two-minute warning he preached another 20 minutes i was like oh my but another brother down the table at the breakfast said think of it this way brother paul you're in very exclusive company you see what happened here was this rich man in his life being raised up and all that had happened he had been persuaded to a belief now lest you would think that i am looking negatively at that we'll come along here in just a little bit and touch on the other side of this but my brother and sister young people please hear me this morning we can come to a place that my mama says this my daddy says this uh the sunday school teacher says this the ministry in our church says this and it makes sense i think i should do that i'm a young man i should keep myself clean i should be respectful my hair cut right i should behave correctly in the fashion of holiness a young sister you'd say okay i see the word of god says then i shouldn't cut my hair and i should dress modestly and i should present myself godly okay it makes sense to me and you do this my brother sister and this is what is called persuasion this is i'll read the full definition in a minute but this is where we're raised because human nature our children will often follow in our footsteps say man remember the story brother brown talks about the man delivering the christmas gifts and how he looks back and his little boy is staggering through the snow and he finally says son why are you walking that way he says daddy i want to follow in your footsteps you see we're going to come to a place we'll do that but if we're not careful we can be here in the church we can be raised up or introduced to the message and we do that and we follow by a persuasion because our mind can wrap itself around the idea that this is what we should do but my brother and sister when we break free from the persuasion and we step out into what i would call the real world there's all kinds of persuasion all kinds of voices all kinds of things that say that's nonsense and so persuasion will only last for a season you can come you can come in these meetings you can come in church you can do this you can do that and people are stirred and they walk out with a resolution it's kind of like new year's resolutions coming along here in just a few days my brother and sister i don't even really believe in them because oftentimes we're just persuaded i need to do this and i need to do that but it's not conviction it is just something that you and the doctor says i need to lose some weight so right after the new year why not right now i was preaching to paul and jerry there amen you see persuasion will carry us for so long but it will not carry us all the way through in fact you'd be persuaded to a belief brother branham said now let me just draw this out i'm just paraphrasing this brother brown says we're getting them to church not to christ he said i'm afraid of that young people i don't want to get you to church i want to get you to christ i want you to get out of the idea of mom and dad such a strict life this that and the other i want you to get into the idea that this uh story of the rich man and lazarus is not just something that's in the bible it is going to be and is being played out each and every day of this life of this world we live in people are going to the grave thinking it's okay the prophet of god shares a story about that girl and she's been a sunday school teacher and all these things she's dying there of a disease and it's there as she is passing from this life into the next she turns to her pastor and starts yelling at him or whatever loudly speaking you deceiver you deceiver i am lost i'm not here to play on your emotion i'm here to play on reality that just because we're sitting in grace tabernacle doesn't mean that we have some kind of go pass go collect 200 we've got to have a real live experience with jesus christ we've got to get beyond churchianity our family grandma and grandpa all this and that they're all believers well i won't do one thing for you hallelujah you might know who father abraham is you might know all of these things but it's got to go beyond persuasion and become conviction it's going to move into the place that deep down in your heart nothing can shake you from that brother branham says here now in the sermon proof of his resurrection he said it's not christ on the outside reading it saying yes that's right but christ on the inside saying that's right you get the difference christ on the inside amen conforming you know often times young people i don't even like to really speak about this too much but i just can't help it as a young man i did a lot of conforming but it was not conviction and when something else come along that persuaded me differently i went with that and it took me on a 20-year journey outside i believe of the will of god outside of the word a 20-year journey because i thought hey we believe god sent a prophet everything will be all right that's good but the devil believes god sent a prophet he's not saved amen he's not god eternal life now i want to share these words with you because you see saints church what i'm speaking of can happen right here we can hear the ministry of this church visiting ministry week after week year after year we can and it not change us come on saints can you hear me can you hear me amen now look here i want to share with you uh this amen we can be persuaded but not revelated that's right amen that's right yes sir am i preaching too blunt today i want to see each and every one of us i'm preaching to paul this morning i want to see each and every one of us in the rapture that ought to make us happy amen i i'm not here just to make you feel good to go home we have such a lovely church they preach such nice sermons well do you bit of good if you end up on the wrong side of this golf amen now let me just read uh i'm kind of lost in my own notes isn't that silly i guess we're just not there yet we can be persuaded but not revelated but you see what we need is conviction which is a firmly held belief now see there's a lot of difference between conviction and condemnation we can preach down here amen young people well i guess sister nadia is a young person today she's right on the same seat and i'm not going to solve the end of the pew of young people we can hold things in our life we can deal with things in our life and we can feel condemned that's right i lied to mom and dad i'm sorry down paul anybody ever lie to their parents yes sir yeah i hope all of you that said yes sir said i've also repented [Laughter] but you see we can we can be condemned we can kind of put the gray area reminds me a little story of boys at his grandmother's house and grandma's in the room sewing and he hears the buzz of the sewing machine and so he goes so carefully and he's over there and he's just lifting the lid off the cookie jar and his grandma says bobby are you in the cookies no grandma i was just looking at them we can be condemned for what we speak what we say what we do but you realize this struck me this something just come to me down there in phoenix and and i i it stirred my heart you realize saints when the devil comes and says hey you did this you did this you did this you did this young people you did this do you realize if you've repented all the devil has is a xerox copy of your sin he doesn't have your sin your sin is under the blood all he's got is a xerox coffee that says you did this and you did this you did this but because he refuses to accept the blood of jesus christ his page will never be wiped away he'll have it forever to wave in front of you you did this and you can say i sure did devil but it's no longer held to my account because it's been washed by the blood of what is that my brother and sister you don't have to be condemned because you had conviction that caused you to do something about your sin and therefore we have reacted and said lord wash away my sin forgive me lord i'm putting it under the blood and the devil can wave that list just as much as he wants you don't have to be condemned by that spirit you can stand up and say praise lord neville i did that now most of us have done things in our life we would not stand up in church and say well guess what i did but i tell you my brother and sister you no longer have to be ashamed of that because you can say i know satan truly you have that copy of what i have done but truly you missed the point that the blood of jesus christ has washed that away has nullified it amen i am convicted i repent when i do wrong but i am no longer condemned but if we're not careful we'll take condemnation it's the same for conviction i felt so bad about that that's like the liar cheating thief that repents after he's caught is it true repentance no because if he never been caught he would have never repented come on amen he knows the rich man knows that his brothers are traveling down this pathway now let's look at persuade for a second persuade to cause someone to do something by asking arguing or giving reasons come on we can as a church give all kinds of reasons why not to call someone to believe something as a transitive verb it would come more of an action to move by an argument in treaty or expostulation to a belief position or course of action to plead with urge i think my brother and sister that every preacher that ever stands in a pulpit is here to persuade you yeah are they always convicted no no no sir you see he says i've got these brothers that are going down the same exact pathway we thought we were going to heaven uh let you come and uh deal with them but abraham says you know what they have moses they have the prophets now i'm for the sake of our conversation today i'm going to put it this way they have moses and they have a prophet let them hear them let them listen to the prophet they don't need a candy-coated uh uh uh orientation from from me they don't need it from you they don't need it from some preacher let them listen to the prophet just take the word for your hour and listen to it and if that won't move you nothing will oh but my pastor is so eloquent with words good good candy coat you candy coach you walk out of church our pastor just preached such an amazing sermon what did it do to your life you know spurgeon said if a preacher i'm just paraphrasing it said if the preacher didn't make you mad during church he didn't do his job can i take that as a license [Music] think about what he's saying though he's not talking about mad in the human element of anger but the mad would be pointed back to our own self why did i let the devil do that to me why did i let the devil trick me why did i let the devil influence in me that way you see if the preacher isn't doing that my brother and sister he's not doing his job but you know in the world we live in even around this message everybody's moving towards these nice candy coated ma i know i don't know who gave us the gift but somebody gave us these uh candy coated almonds who did that oh good it's family i can really lean on them for a whole bucket full of them i don't want a little cup full i want a bucket full of those things my blood sugar will probably kill me my head will pop off and i'll be done but at least i'd die happy but you see if we take that to the message and we start candy-coating this message oh praise the lord we can pack the church out we're going to have to build a new church our church is so full because our pastor speaks so wonderfully and then we look over and hey how did i get here [Music] it'd be the same if i just ate a bucket full of sister kristen's candy coated almonds i don't know if any of the rest of you got any of those but if you did let's join together and force her to make more but our preaching shouldn't be that way our preaching needs to cut right to the core of our heart our life it needs to bring us to the place we recognize i don't want to end up with that rich man i want to be over here and be aligned with lazarus the beggar i want to know because you see lazarus laying there on the curb he was laying there with sores on his body and malnutrition but he had revelation of who he was in jesus christ and while it looked like that he had been given absolutely the short end of the stick in this life he was there with a relationship with god and you think but if god loved him yeah god loved him so much he let him suffer in the flesh to redeem his soul i say god maybe some of us need to suffer a little bit and get over our candy-coated life that we have our candy-coated church candy-coated everything that we could come to a place lord i'm willing beyond everything to have this relationship with you lord to be filled with your spirit i'm a revelation of who i am in jesus christ that is more than a million dollars that is more than 10 million dollars that is more than a life of sumptuous living but if we're not careful we want to try and find the balance can i find the balance lord a little sumptuous living and maybe i could have a revelation also choose if you have a revelation of jesus christ and you sell out to him and he gives you those gifts of life those good things a good job a home all of this you all praise the lord for that but he says that you should seek ye first the kingdom very clearly shows us where our priority ought to be now samuel butler i doubt if too many of you have heard of samuel butler but some of you will have recognized this phrase amen he wrote this back in the 17th century he that complies against his will is of his own opinion still i want you to think about that well our pastor our youth leader they're always telling us this is how we're supposed to dress this is how we're supposed to act this is what we're supposed to do i've done it come on young people it's not just your battle but it's a hard battle when you're young mom says dad says pastor says look but if you comply and something down inside of you says i don't want to do this but i have to you're still of your own opinion young people i don't want to skin you too hard so i'll move on to your parents here so they can heal with you my brother and sister you can look through the pictures of the days you can look through these things of the ages you can go back through photo albums and there'll be gatherings there'll be groups there'll be people and you will see that they must maybe sit at your table and you look at those pictures where are they today not serving god today you know what they were doing they were complying they were complying they were submitting to that but it was not revelation to them because when god becomes revelation to you you can't quit you cannot say well i'm done serving god and ever have had a true revelation you are persuaded and so in that persuasion something else the cares of life someone's voice whatever it might be has persuaded you differently oh god help us to move beyond persuasion to come into the realm that this is revelation hallelujah oh my my brother and sister strong words strong words you see as we go back to verse 31 it was there that it's like you know what if they hear not moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead it will not matter what kind of supernatural event took place if they don't have something beyond that's right nothing inside reaching out taking the halts of the word come on are you with me saints i might be skinning some of you a little bit i don't know but i just felt compelled i have to preach this hallelujah you see it's got to come down because you see if you're entertaining the idea of quitting god he will give you plenty of reasons reason i'm not going to serve god is our pastor sometimes just preaches too hard and they did this and they did that and he was preaching about something and i'm sure he meant that at me well you know what i'm not speaking in defense of the preachers around this church but what if it wasn't them at all what if that was god speaking to you what if it was god telling you young men young women don't go out there in the world don't act like you're a christian and go out here in the world and go over here and do this look my brother and sister when you got and i'm not speaking against the sisters young sisters but when you have cases where my friends different pastors share my we got blown away found out one of these young ladies in the church she's just been so sweet so loving so whatever but she's got a boyfriend and she goes out and drinks and smokes with him it floored us what was that persuasion with no conviction now by god's grace that particular little girl gave her heart back to god realized she'd done wrong that's right shall i give you all the details shall i blow you away okay my wife says no i'll follow her because i'm telling you this wasn't just some simple little oh i better not do this i'm a bad girl she had a drastic thing happen in her life and she realized that this out here that was so beautiful outside these walls is not beautiful at all reminds me brother gideon routine took sister jerry and i a few years ago when we were there for youth camp took us out to kruger national park and i got all excited there was uh what was that thing jerry was that a baboon or whatever it was remember when i jumped out of the van brother get in screamed at me get back in the van i'm sorry brother get in he goes you don't understand brother paul death strikes quickly out there then proceeded to tell us about how baboons this guy got out and take a picture of these baby baboons and my i shouldn't even tell you about this but mama baboon took offense to that and tore the man's head off literally death strikes quickly out there don't get out of the van but see that can't be just your pastor speaking that's going to be conviction it's going to be something down in your heart that knows he is our sanctuary he is our refuge it's not what we know what we can do how much money in the bank because most of us would be in trouble there but look at this my brother and sister if we don't it becomes that knowledge it becomes intellectual do you realize an intellectual revelation is just satan's distraction we can go for years saying yes uh now brother branham preached this and he preached this like this and he tied this over here like this and we see how he come right here and he said this and he said that what is it those are the same people that can explain trigonometry to you they're the same one that can explain to you uh all of all of these concepts it doesn't make a revelation does it you know what intellectual revelation does it leads us don't frown at me church lip service intellectual revelation leads to lip service amen that's right well praise the lord praise the lord no you know what i'd rather i'd rather you be silent i'd even settle for your frowning at me amen if it's here if it's down here my brother and sister amen amen well i'll hurry along here so that you uh you don't have to listen to part two on this amen now first corinthians 1 21 uh is talking about it please god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that belief amen i'm glad god you know put that in scripture because sometimes we feel pretty foolish after we've preached you see everyone comes to a time of persuasion and it has different effects on different people amen we react saints according to the atmosphere that we approached it in right that's right well our family goes to church we're message believers you'll get just exactly what you approached it in if we come to church just because we are message believers message family so therefore we go to church that's all you're going to get out of it the satisfaction that i went to church i took my children to church you know we as a family said in church together this is what happened to the rich young ruler to this rich man they went to church to become a formality almost as though they could look down the checklist and check that off we prayed over our food check oh we prayed for the people that needed check we went to church check well do one more thing for us my brother and sister then become something to check off but we've got to come down to this place that we recognize what god is doing is giving us the opportunity to create the atmosphere by which we can come into the house of god this morning and say lord i need you to speak to me i need my battery amen does any of you ever ever get down to sunday and your battery's kind of like come on praise god mine's usually that way by wednesday hallelujah i'll just tell you the truth i believe in living life to the fullest and you know that takes that takes a lot you know it's like i met a guy it's funny how we got in this conversation because we're sitting there at this older brother's breakfast and this brother pulls out this flip phone he goes can you guess how old this is and i said i don't know but i was about 26 when i had one of those and he goes yep that'd be about right he knew how this is a 30 year old phone still works i said what do you use it for brothers what do you use a telephone for i said okay i understand that he goes but i don't have to worry about wearing it out there's days go by it never rings that thing's probably going to last till the rapture but you know i've got a phone amen well sister jerry convinced me my daughter kristen convinced me to get a different phone here recently but i've got a phone that's got like three or four thousand photos on it it's got several thousand notes in the notes it's got almost zero memory left because you see i'm going to use this phone for what it was made for it was made to be my memory yeah it was my mailbox it was my phone drop it was my photo album i tell you what i hope you don't mind a little humor this morning but there's nothing more i realize this while we're in arizona we're in a conversation i said oh brothers i want to show you this photo conversation goes on and it's long gone when i'm finally like and i realize no one's interested because no one wanted to wait while i went through 4 000 pages of photo album you see my brother and sister we come to a place let me get back on track here come to a place that we're going to react according to the atmosphere that we approached it with amen if we approach this with an atmosphere i go to church you'll get just exactly that you can be able to say i went to church now i'm going to come here because i'm closing in the next couple minutes amen romans 8 we won't go through all of these scriptures but we will see right here as paul is speaking to the romans i want to jump right down i want to make commentation commentary on the others i want to jump right down to verse 38 amen and so as we'll look at this on verse 38 brother alex if you'll pop that up there uh for he now paul is speaking to the romans and he tells them for i am persuaded but my brother and sister do you understand that persuasion with revelation yields an entirely different result so paul is there telling them i'm persuaded but he's got revelation to back up the persuasion he's not just there well somebody convinced me that somebody who convinced him was almighty god jehovah el shaddai on the backside of the desert and there he walked out fully persuaded it wasn't well according to this and according to that i'm persuaded but it was that experience with almighty god and look what he says for i am persuaded that neither death oh my brother and sister we say i'm not afraid to die until the time comes nor life you know some of us are actually the way we live we're afraid of life come on i don't have time to deviate off into that but that's why i tell you young people live life to the fullest put god first live life to the fullest because some people are so afraid of life that they are afraid of making a mistake i'm not condoning we just go haphazardly through life but i'm telling you my brother and sister you live life to the fullest and if you make a mistake the holy ghost will come down brother branham preaches on this the holy ghost will come down and deal with you and brother branham says when the holy spirit starts to deal with you repent quickly but some people don't even live life because they're afraid of making a mistake nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate look at this revelation there's nothing going to separate me from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord nothing is going to separate that that my brother and sister is a deep revelation that there's no mistake as it were no problem no deal in this life is going to bring me from the love of god then you can live life to the fullest hallelujah that's not the intentional sinning that's not the intentional going out from underneath the covering of the word but that's getting up in the morning and saying praise god god give me another day to live i'll live it for him and you go with gosto hallelujah there's a revelation there amen he was persuaded why because he had a revelation of who he was amen and this word has come in this hour my brother and sister and people study this word and they say well brother adam taught this and the bible says this and this is this but my brother and sister the prophet of god now i'm just paraphrasing the words here the prophet of god says it's revelation that seals this in your soul it is not that you can say well over in this sermon in paragraph whatever brother brown said this and over here brother brown said this and over here brother brown said that you can quote it all you want but if you can't live it amen we've got to come to the place it's real enough that we can live it hallelujah any of you make a mistake this last week hallelujah i've got a list as long as my arm of the mistakes i made this last week but i'll tell you the list is as long as my arm of the things i repented of this last week is it going to bind me hinder me do i look at myself you're no good paul as a christian you're not good as a pastor you're not good as a preacher no all of that is behind me because i have a revelation of who i am in jesus christ and i'm not just persuaded because i can read the message and read the bible i'm persuaded because something happened in me and i say well i can't really explain it because i don't really know what happened to its instagram but i can tell you that i am no longer condemned amen the devil come along say well you said this way and that could have been misunderstood and if it was misunderstood that way you lied to them and i can stop and say lord please just send your spirit that they understand it correctly because i never meant to lie to them and so satan you're rebuked and go forward and then you get a run into by the grace of god just a couple days later you're going to run into that individual and you say hey now i told you this and this and i don't want you to misunderstand because it could oh no i understood you amen well where was the devil at in this he was wanting you to go all the way through the week and show up at church on sunday i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar live life to the fullest amen don't be afraid to pick up a telephone and sell somebody i said this and i don't know if that came out right exactly right you know what they'll do remember brother branham i'm gonna close saints remember brother branham the whole tax issue he's overwhelmed they're putting so much pressure on him and he's there you can find it spread across many sermons there he's talking he doesn't directly speak it out but he's talking about there i was in the woods so grieved in my spirit you can tie that right back my brother and sister those things the devil just used that and started pounding on him and then the prophet of god under such pressure the phone rings tell them i'm not here wait that can't be a prophet of god that would do that really steps outside god pats him on the back and says it's all right says i'm not going to move on your prayers i'm not going to speak to you until you correct this amen so brother branham that's my words that's my way of putting it brother branham goes back to this man and he tells them i caused my wife to lie to you now if you study the tapes now just think about paul how he approaches things sometimes then the man talking to brother brown says why you load down no good scoundrel i will never have nothing to do with you i would no you know you're just worthless no sir what's he do he says that calls me all the more to respect you the devil would say oh you're gonna look so foolish everybody's gonna no no no regardless of how we look if we're just persuaded we'll react one way but if we're persuaded we have a revelation we'll act entirely different and i don't care if they do look down on me i have to make it right for me amen but even out here amongst the heathen i know because i've had to do it saints i said things in such a way that we might call it you know gray now i know none of you have ever done that but let me explain to you what gray is it's 98 percent truth with two parts black come on let's get it right it's two parts black that yields gray that's it you don't have to have 98 black and two parts white that won't work it's almost all white with just two parts of black yields gray and that's what the devil wants to do he wants to come in and inject that two parts black so we're not telling the truth i don't care how you view a gray it's not the truth because we had to inject some black into it to tell the narrative it was well kind of like this and then somebody don't you love that i know you've done this yes sir come on saints i know you've done this and then somebody knocked the bowl off the table as if no one would know that it was you because you're the one that's got salad all over your shoes i don't know somebody knocked the bowl off the table come on the silliness of it is is we fall subject to this because we lack a true revelation that all things my brother and sister all things in christ jesus always comes to our benefit amen amen can someone say amen always comes to our benefit we don't have to create another narrative we can just stand on the word you know what come on i run into a brother that was just this vocal and it catches you off guard because we're all used to guarding ourself and this brother's like oh praise the lord brother paul i haven't seen you for a long time yeah brother it's been a long time he gives me a hugs whatever he says well he says what's happening in your world and i said well you know the church and this and that and the other and and he goes yeah i praise the lord well what's happened my world i've got delivered from lust excuse me brother you said what he did black and white i mean he didn't grade he black and white this is what's happened in my life lately god delivered me and this is what he delivered me from praise god i'm delivered and the rest of us are like you don't have to say that so loud brother he didn't care he didn't care he identified the demon that was tormenting him and said i'm gonna tell the world my god house delivered me and you know if he said i had a lying spirit we'd all be like oh yeah yeah come on saints y'all look all stove up over this but i'm telling you it kind of blows your eyebrows and your hair back a little bit because the brother doesn't make it you know he's just telling the truth i got delivered from this praise the lord i'll tell you what whatever i need delivered from lord let me not even be ashamed of what i need delivered from let me just stand and say lord deliver me i need deliverance lord i want it to be a revelation in my life of what it is i need delivered from preachers get up sometimes well you know if there's any little thing in your life you know why don't we get so specific ourself lord i need delivered from this i want delivered from this i will be delivered from this but we have a little pride you know what i'm talking about oh my look at that my cough drop jumped off the deal saying amen hallelujah see revelation now i'm going to close with this right here i've got quite a bit more but we're going to stop sister emmy musicians if you'd come brother jason amen revelations what seals in our soul is that right see you can put the pickle saints in the jar but if you don't seal the jar the pickle rots and becomes poison to you does that make sense do you know where i got that analogy the prophet of god said you can have the holy ghost on your life all the days of your life and go to hell you think that rich man was not shocked that he'd been anointed come on saints he'd been anointed he'd stood in church danced in the spirit spoke in tongues just so caught up in the spirit of god and then he wakes up in hell and he can't understand what happened amen you see he needed seal [Music] don't you just love that those pickles [Music] i really like my dad was just awesome making sweet pickles he could make the most wonderful sweet pickle you ever tasted in your life and i remember one year i was well in my teens stuck with me so there must have been something there my dad said i'm going to try something different there's this new brine pickle thing or whatever and he said you just put them in a crock and you put this stuff in on them and then you leave them for like 30 days and after that you don't even have to seal them in a jar my dad said i'm going to try that that'd be so easy you remember that sis my dad always he liked to like to do this stuff i can remember after 30 days digging pickles out of that thing and i don't know you can experiment at home if you want to but if you can just take a pickle and pour a little vinegar in something and throw a little bit of spice on top of it dig it out in 30 days and you'd take a bite of that and be like i've just gave up on pickles i'm done but i tell you what when he took them pickles and he put them in them jars he poured whatever that was i don't even know what all it was i'm not a pickle maker he poured that in there and you'd see little little deal dill and you'd see different stuff in the sweet pickles all floating in there and he sealed them up and he put them in the cooker cooked them for just a certain time tick tick tick they're out of there you could go back five years later pop the top off of those pickles pull one of them out and it tasted just as good as the first day [Music] you're right brother tim better better let's see my brother and sister we can put the holy spirit in the jar but if we don't seal the jar we don't seal the vessel the pickle's gonna rot it's gonna turn into poison and you eat it it'll kill you i'm talking serious now saints i've joked a little bit this morning i asked you this morning if you got something in your life you feel like a little void in your life why don't you just stand up lift your hands the lord and say lord i want some more revelation i don't want to be just persuaded this message is right i don't want to just hear the preaching and say amen amen amen i want it to be so real in my life and then i can stand here and declare i know that i know that i know who i am in jesus christ the devil can't move us he can't shake us he can't detour us because we know amen i left off here because it's a whole nother thing where the prophet of god you know the quotes where the prophet of god said you ought to pray for revelation more than anything else in your life i just ask you today if you would care it's up to you you decide not an altar call you decide from your heart lord i want more of you i stand before you as your pastor and i lift both of my hands lord i need more of you lord i want more of you lord i want you to come down move in my life lord i want you to change it father lord i want you to reveal not hide but reveal every weakness that i have i want you to expose every shortcoming i want you lord to bring every weakness in this man out in the open that i could con commit it to you lord oh as you just lift your hands to the lord today just claim your position amen saints this doesn't mean we're backslid this doesn't mean that we are turned away it doesn't mean that we're lost what it means is is that we have a heart that is tender we have all than ever before oh god as a pastor of this church lord i don't want to just go on with some kind of rumor lord of story of the past but i want you present here today lord in our midst i want you to deal with my young people our young people here lord i want you to deal with them that they see the reality of who they are in jesus christ not persuaded to live not persuaded to be good people but lord have revelation of who they are being filled with your holy spirit may the power of god i ask you today lord may the power of god move through our families lord move through our lives father that we can see you clearer than ever before oh father i thank you lord for your grace and for your mercy oh lord i ask you lord just to come father just reveal this to us lord let us lord just be able to walk in your presence lord knowing you are with us having this confidence that this work he began in us oh lord this work that you have began in us oh father you said you would finish and i say hey man lord it's a revelation father it's what you said and i believe it lord i fully commit myself to you today asking you father for more revelation asking lord for more understanding lord not that we can boast but lord as you build this block by block the stature of a perfect man father lord that we can just stand with that confidence oh that's what it is lord we need you we need you lord for the only confidence that we have as sons and daughters of god is you lord oh father the only revelation that we have lord is you oh father lord not taking this message and trying to make it say something different the lord being able to stand according to your word and lord be made different by this message oh hallelujah thank you lord jesus thank you lord oh hallelujah oh amen hallelujah if you'd like just a little reference you can go look it up my brothers and sisters in the message brother brown says in the revelation of jesus christ we need to call on god for revelation more than anything else in the world wow he says we've accepted the bible we've accepted the great truths of it but it's still not real to most people because the revelation by the spirit is not there i want it to be there i wanted to be there in your life i wanted to be there in my life hallelujah not just something we have associated ourselves with but simply you know i i had going on this morning i was gonna go back in and just share with you amen just out of the rising of the sun it is the rising of the sun brother branham's talking about there that we become bone of his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of his spirit oh hallelujah she is him hallelujah church i i just this morning maybe i come across a little strong i don't know but you see just identifying yourself with the message is not going to keep you not being persuaded that the scripture shows that god would send a prophet in this age is not enough you have to have an apostle paul kind of experience get on that back side where you can stand there and say ha i am absolutely sure that nothing see you could put your own words in there we don't even have to stick with the apostle paul we can put our own words in there it won't be money it won't be my position amen i left out part of a quote there where brother brown said some people come to church just to be seen my goodness i'm telling you that when you think about that that isn't really you're not coming for much if you're just coming to be seen hallelujah oh my praise the lord let's stand saints oh yeah well praise the lord and take take quite a bit to cover the rest of this amen i just tell you from the depths of my heart don't settle for an intellectual understanding of this message young people maybe i'll just say people i'll put now age limit on this don't conform conforming won't do you any good [Music] dig in the word young people sorry i just feel led come back to you young people if you say well i'm coming to church because mom and dad bring me to church i ask you as your brother i compel you maybe i could persuade you why don't you just stop long enough in your life and say lord if you're real i'd like you to prove yourself real to me because if you're real lord i want you but you see it'll be how you approach it it's all about the atmosphere we approach it in people say well i believe this i believe this and then go do the opposite saying i'm not being judgmental but i have to question do they really believe it the prophet said this i believe the prophet's word to go do something officer you see they have an intellectual understanding amen i'm an intellectual they they they see this and they see but they also see the part that allows them to go around it do you know that's one thing that separates the bride from the rest of the world the rest of the world reads god's words and they also read in there on how to go around it well that's why our church believes this and your church believes that it's because we go this way well i'll tell you what a true revelation of the word of god takes you into the word of god and never let you get out never gives you an escape over here never gives you an out over here and never gives you an excuse down over here amen the word of god the holy ghost will always bring you right to the heart of the word amen always bring you to the heart of the word and there's the place we say lord i surrender i surrender lord i want to be obedient to your word i want that word to be my words your life to be my life hallelujah hallelujah i will praise him i will praise him i will praise the lamb for sinner slain oh because he is worthy saints to be praised today hallelujah will praise him i will praise him praise the lamb for sinners let o give him glory all ye peace for his blood has washed away he day and when i saw the cleansing fountain [Laughter] for all my sins [Music] when he said will thou be clean oh i will praise him i will praise him o praise a lamb for sinners [Music] for his blood has washed away each day [Applause] and though the waves seem straight and narrow [Music] all i claimed was swept away and my ambitions plans and wishes [Music] for i will praise him yes i will praise him [Music] praise the o give him glory all ye people for his blood has washed away he'd say then god's fire upon the altar my heart was set aflame oh i shall never cease to praise [Music] glory glory to his name oh i will praise him i will praise him [Music] him glorious [Music] each day and you know what happens when those stains are gone your chains are gone hallelujah when the stain is taken away the chain is taken away and there'll be nothing hold this bride from moving into her perfect position hallelujah aren't you happy about that amen you see as long as the stain right the scripture tells us where there's condemnation there's no confidence you want confidence in god you're struggling with confidence in god then make sure the condemnation is gone you say well brother paul i've already repented then let the devil know you know that he's only got a copy he doesn't have your sin he's only got a copy and he can keep that copy as long as he wants hallelujah you know let me just throw it out this way hallelujah they they tell us as a business to you know keep your paperwork down don't keep it around after seven years just dump it but you know my accountant's got way more than seven years of records on me they can keep the record the devil can keep the record just as long as he wants he'd take you back to 12 years old and say you did this and you'd say yep i sure did but my sins are gone yep you know the facts sure enough i did that the devil will come along and say well you looked at that you looked at this you did this you said that yep you're right you're absolutely right i won't even contest it with you but go find it you only have a copy you won't find the original it went underneath the blood and it come out a blank sheet hallelujah my chains are gone and i tell you what i say hallelujah today my chains are gone amen because i tell you what my brother and sister when your chains are gone there's a whole liberty that comes with that hallelujah so if you feel like you're just dragging along can't spiritually get ahead i want you to look down make sure you're not just dragging a chain that doesn't even belong to you belongs to the devils who it belongs to doesn't belong to you hallelujah amazing grace how sweet [Music] was lost but now i'm found was blind but now i see my heart to fear and grace my fears really how precious did that grace appear [Music] beyond i first believe my chains are gone i've been set free his mercy brains unending love [Music] amazing grace the lord has promised good to me his word my whole [Music] secures he will [Music] as long as life endures the earth shall soon dissolve like snow the sun [Music] hallelujah [Music] love my chains are gone i've been set free my his mercy brains [Music] i'm fully persuaded my chains are gone fully persuaded i'm not gonna say okay i'll go pick that up again no hallelujah i put it under the blood thank you lord it's been cut off hallelujah i'm fully persuaded that i have been set free i'm fully persuaded that my god my savior paid my ransom i'm fully persuaded that his mercy comes in like a flood oh hallelujah i'm fully persuaded that it's an unending love and amazing grace are we persuaded today hallelujah don't just let it be persuaded in your mind but as the prophet of god said more than anything else pray for revelation hallelujah it's time for us as families as husbands fathers listen to me brothers it's time for us to break loose of everything that binds us it's time for us in this liberty to be the priest of our home to no longer say well i can't say that to my wife i can't say that to my children because i'm not living it get on beyond that and find that liberty where you can look your children in the face and say mistake but dad believes this word and dad's gonna live this word and moms you do the same thing and children have mercy on your parents if god tarries one day i don't tell this to embarrass my son if he was to ever hear it but my son called me up one day and he says dad at that point my grandson was 12 years old he said dad do you remember when i was 12 i laughed i said i'll never forget it he said i used to think you didn't like me i used to think that you had some kind of grudge or something against me he said now i have a 12 year old and i understand [Music] you see it'll come it's a cycle of life parents have grace on your children children have grace on your parents husbands help grace to your wives wives have graced your husbands let's focus on the one thing that matters the one thing that is life-changing let's focus on that hallelujah well you know what this word's producing this song's just always on my heart i just i just walk around all the time i can't get rid of it i'm sorry i'm going to wear the thing out but i just know this word of god you know church i'm sorry i was going to be done by now but hey here we are god bless you but look some people say well you know what brother brown read there read their minds discern their hearts that's his vindication my brother branham prayed for these people and they were healed that's a vindication there was actually a lot of people through that era of time that had those kind of ministries they discerned the hearts of the people now we understand that they all come in sincerity but they come amen they weren't the original that's right but i'll tell you what i want you to stop and think about the saints i want to tell you why i know his ministry was vindicated because i want you just to look around the world do i think we're perfect no i don't brothers sisters i see in my own life and i see it in your life many things that we should preach on probably should just strike those things but i see god working but you know what i know brother brown's ministry's vindicated because his ministry look at this now i don't sound critical but the pentecostals are slipping remember the story brother brown talks about mincing on high heels falling off into hell go look at the pentecostals now my goodness they they are they are well i'm not trying to preach a sermon but they're wearing down them skinned down dresses they're walking on them big high heels they're mincing as they walk i see them they're slowly lowering their standard i look out and i see different things here my brother and sister but also get a look out and see a bride that every day is pressing into the world she wants more than anything to become the word did you notion of his ministry because if he had preached about a bride that would be righteous and holy and prepared for her bridegroom and it never appeared what would we have it wouldn't matter how many people he discerned or how many people had prayed for him but you see the very word that he said god led me here god ordained me to open the word to a bride and that word is producing a bride and that makes my heart so happy to look out and see there's a bride responding to the word there's a vindication of a ministry in laodicea that is it my brother and sister there's still people on television and everywhere else that are able to walk through the crowd and say i see this in your life and you don't know if it's real or not but let's just give them the benefit of the doubt they're looking at a young woman they're looking young man and they're they're discerning those things and they're speaking words of prophecy and and that is well and good but their sisters have no hair and they're going to church in tank tops and shorts and tennis shoes and no see it's like no see we're going to have it all oh can someone say amen we are going to have the word and we're going to have the life that's in the word hallelujah and we don't have to settle for one or the other hallelujah we can have it all we'll so the word of god is gonna do what it's gonna produce a new testament church amen i love this song you know why it reminds me of what god's doing i get to see it hallelujah well as i look out across the land see god's mighty [Music] just like in the days of old they stood with courage bowl they turned the whole world upside down rising up rising up new testament church rising up [Music] rising up rising up there's a new testament church rising up now the bible plainly tells how the holy ghost found signs and wonders were done by the apostles hands demon spirits were cast out in the jail they sang and shout while surrounded by the holy angel band [Music] rising up rising up there's a new testament church [Applause] rising up there's a new testament church rising up well if you think it's all long gone and the miracles are done i have some good news to bring to you in the
