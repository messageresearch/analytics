[40:42] pray
[40:45] Hallelujah God bless you
[40:48] Saints I would just like to expound for
[40:51] just one moment on this unspoken prayer
[40:54] request that I have placed before you
[40:59] this is a young
[41:02] lady that by God's grace several years
[41:05] ago we were in some meetings
[41:08] overseas and we got to
[41:11] see the absolute Supernatural power of
[41:16] God
[41:18] break a satanic bond in this young
[41:21] lady's
[41:22] life and set her free Lord she's went on
[41:27] to get married she's went on
[41:29] now to have her second
[41:33] child and as I was speaking with the
[41:38] brothers as they contacted me and just
[41:40] asked us here specifically knowing this
[41:43] relationship going back and said brother
[41:46] Paul please pray and have your church
[41:49] pray you see Satan's trying to take that
[41:53] testimony away what he's trying to do is
[41:57] March into the very temple of God and
[42:00] say this isn't so but I tell you my
[42:04] brother and sister when God has written
[42:07] it it will be so amen and so we rebuke
[42:11] Satan in the name of Jesus Christ for
[42:14] this young sister's Deliverance that she
[42:17] could come to her right mind as the as a
[42:21] brother shared with me he says it's like
[42:23] she has lost her mind to see ly
[42:26] overnight just lost her mind and my
[42:29] brother and sister That's what Satan
[42:30] wants to do to you and I now we can say
[42:33] well maybe there's this circumstance or
[42:35] maybe that circumstance we can call it
[42:37] postpartum depression we can call it a
[42:39] lot of things it's nothing less than the
[42:42] devil and a frontal assault against a
[42:45] daughter of God and I just en ask you
[42:48] encourage you just to continue to lift
[42:51] her
[42:51] fervently and lift our young people not
[42:54] just the ones here tonight but those
[42:56] that are associated with this assembly
[42:59] lift them up my brother and sister
[43:01] because Satan is trying to bring a
[43:03] frontal assault if he can't do it by
[43:05] subtility he will simply do it by a
[43:08] frontal assault and just the blast of
[43:10] the devil amen and it's just been a very
[43:14] heart stirring thing for me uh to hear
[43:18] this report and uh I you know just have
[43:24] as a wonderful memory this young sister
[43:26] there are actually many young people in
[43:27] those those
[43:29] Services uh that uh God come and did a
[43:32] mighty work we didn't do a mighty work
[43:35] amen I tell
[43:37] you we would stand and be able to
[43:40] declare we're not even worthy to undo
[43:44] the latchet of his shoe that's right but
[43:47] in spite of that he has called us to be
[43:51] his
[43:52] representation oh thank you Lord amen
[43:55] I'd like to speak to you thank you so
[43:56] much beautiful song service I could tell
[43:58] you the thoughts that I have had in the
[44:00] last couple days uh or last few days
[44:03] actually starting uh uh even this last
[44:07] weekend uh this song Service uh uh
[44:10] encompassed all of those thoughts and
[44:12] just drew them in and I say thank you
[44:15] Lord our musicians and uh brother Alex
[44:19] obviously God uh in my thoughts amen uh
[44:23] God just divinely directed this song
[44:25] Serv service amen I want to speak to you
[44:29] I have a question mark in my title and I
[44:33] want to speak to you tonight on what is
[44:35] your
[44:36] vision and uh I take that from Proverbs
[44:40] 29:18 amen that we we know these
[44:43] scriptures and uh my brother and sister
[44:46] as we would just go right into the word
[44:49] uh Proverbs 29 and 18 tells us that
[44:52] where there is no vision the people
[44:55] perish but he that keepeth the law happy
[44:58] is he and I've heard it questioned
[45:00] before people say uh this vision and the
[45:03] people perishing and the law connected
[45:06] together in one verse but I believe as
[45:09] we go there's actually quite a bit more
[45:11] but I even voice this to Sister Jerry
[45:14] you know I'm just I'm going to quit
[45:15] writing this down I've got to stop right
[45:18] here because it's just keeps expanding
[45:20] out and uh we'll look at this and we
[45:23] will come along in a little bit here by
[45:26] God's grace and tie this together
[45:28] Heavenly Father we just ask you father
[45:31] just come tonight you know the needs of
[45:33] each and everyone you know father our
[45:36] heart's desires and the circumstances of
[45:39] our lives and father truly I was blessed
[45:42] Lord just thinking of this young sister
[45:45] uh our friend Father and thinking of the
[45:48] circumstances surrounding Our Lives the
[45:51] battle is not ours father the battle is
[45:55] yours amen and father we're here tonight
[45:58] as soldiers in the army of the Living
[46:01] God father we're not here for Satan to
[46:04] come and make his boast but we're here
[46:06] to stand solid upon the word and father
[46:09] we make our claim tonight Lord that the
[46:12] word has preeminence in all things in
[46:14] our lives and father forgive us for the
[46:17] shortcomings of our life when father we
[46:20] in our flesh try to bring the solution
[46:22] when we in our flesh try to find the
[46:25] answer when truly the battle is yours
[46:29] Lord we commit this service tonight in
[46:31] every circumstance in the name of Jesus
[46:33] Christ amen God bless you you may be
[46:37] seated amen God bless you Sister April I
[46:40] think that uh I keep saying where's
[46:43] sister April and and uh some some have
[46:47] said well you haven't exactly been at
[46:49] church on Wednesday night your own self
[46:52] and U but by God's grace we are here and
[46:55] sister Gabriella uh used any excuse she
[46:58] could I think I don't know uh but uh
[47:01] trust that she had a a good time um uh
[47:05] wedding and grandparents and friends and
[47:09] so God bless you in that time now as we
[47:13] look here in Proverbs I intentionally
[47:16] just pulled this little excerpt out of
[47:19] the scripture it's of a greater picture
[47:22] my brother and sister uh that is
[47:24] presented but we want to just uh draw in
[47:28] on this tonight and you know my brother
[47:30] and sister uh Visions can come from the
[47:34] Lord in night or day amen and Visions
[47:38] often times I I would just have to speak
[47:40] this from my own point of view because I
[47:42] don't know exactly where each and every
[47:45] one of you would would uh have a
[47:48] perspective
[47:50] but we can look at that and um you know
[47:54] sometimes we get the idea of the word
[47:55] says about a vision and look at
[47:57] scripture it's it's used a lot I I on
[48:00] purposely didn't write them down because
[48:02] I don't want to make the significance
[48:04] into a number but in the message brother
[48:07] brandham uses speaks the word Vision uh
[48:10] over 3,000 times makes reference of that
[48:14] and it's uh many times uh in
[48:16] relationship to uh things that are
[48:19] happening in his own life and if we're
[48:21] not careful we would think that Visions
[48:24] would only come uh in a spiritual
[48:27] context as it were to a prophet to a
[48:30] minister Etc as that is but I want to
[48:33] draw another point of view tonight and
[48:37] um we realize that uh each and every one
[48:40] of us is Sons and Daughters of God led
[48:42] by the Holy Spirit can we say Amen that
[48:45] is our goal is not to have our own
[48:47] leadership we do not want to build the
[48:50] kingdom of Paul or apply your name there
[48:53] but that's not what we're looking for I
[48:55] have a vision for doing this but yet my
[48:58] brother and sister we see often times in
[49:00] the human element whether you're talking
[49:02] naturally or spiritually if there is no
[49:05] vision and I don't say this to boast of
[49:08] myself but many years ago I prayed often
[49:12] I prayed often Lord let there be a
[49:15] church in this city that would just want
[49:19] to serve you just want to hear the word
[49:22] not all kinds of Dramas and not all
[49:24] kinds of other periph real things just a
[49:27] church of solid people and my brother
[49:29] and sister in my vision of that time I
[49:32] had no clue what God would decide to do
[49:35] I just knew that I had a heart's cry
[49:37] that I wanted my family to attend to
[49:39] church with real Believers with real
[49:42] solid people that just wanted to stand
[49:45] and and uh live the word out and that
[49:48] was my vision at that time but yet we'll
[49:51] find often times that God says well
[49:54] because I placed a burden upon your
[49:56] heart you're going to be part of a
[49:58] vision you're going to be part of an
[50:00] overall picture that we're doing and so
[50:03] we see these Visions can come from the
[50:05] Lord but yet they're not a vision as it
[50:08] were that the prophet of God is speaking
[50:10] of that is there finds himself standing
[50:13] in the middle of his bedroom floor with
[50:15] his hands lifted up in in this and when
[50:18] he comes to himself realizes his wife is
[50:20] in the bed and and he is in this Vision
[50:23] has been in that and we're not talking
[50:26] about that kind of vision but my brother
[50:28] and sister we as humans need something
[50:31] that we look out into we look into
[50:33] something that we have as it were we
[50:35] might say a goal or something that is
[50:38] drawing us forward and we could go to
[50:40] Webster but I decided just to leave
[50:42] those things alone but my brother and
[50:45] sister you see Visions come from God
[50:47] night and day and we don't always have a
[50:50] image as it were before us that is in
[50:53] the misty Veil often times times God
[50:56] would bring as it were a vision to Sons
[50:58] and Daughters of God by speaking in the
[51:01] spirit to you amen there's no image out
[51:04] in front of you but there is a vision
[51:07] taking place inside you cuz remember you
[51:10] are the temple not made with hands in
[51:14] this hour amen and God is now displaying
[51:17] his vision inside his Temple and
[51:21] projecting it out as it is not as it
[51:24] were a wall not as it were a screen but
[51:27] into the very life of the believer he's
[51:31] projecting that into them and my brother
[51:33] and sister what is a vision well I tell
[51:36] you I say in my own thoughts here a
[51:39] vision it can be by revelation of the
[51:42] word you pick this up I want to just
[51:45] place this and I hope you can understand
[51:47] me tonight when you read the word of God
[51:50] and you see these things in the word of
[51:53] God do you realize God has given given
[51:55] you Vision into his word and you can see
[51:59] yourself in the word you can see your
[52:01] life you can see your family you can see
[52:04] your future in the word that's God's
[52:07] Vision to you and it's not as it would
[52:11] be a super spiritual vision but it's God
[52:15] giving you an Insight calling you into
[52:19] the vision and now my brother and sister
[52:22] if I could say so to get into the vision
[52:24] God's Vision you have to get behind the
[52:27] veil to have the vision amen now God
[52:30] will move us from our carnal positions
[52:33] into a different position but that
[52:36] Vision or that calling of God is taking
[52:38] us Beyond the Veil we cannot sit here
[52:40] and say that we have a spiritual life
[52:43] and never go behind the veil not it's
[52:46] not it's not a position to boast about
[52:49] not a deal like to go to YouTube or some
[52:52] other thing and people are like oh I had
[52:54] a vision my if you went on there and
[52:57] called these people the Judgment then in
[52:59] the last year or two I had a vision the
[53:01] world's ending on this day if they were
[53:03] called to accountability for that but no
[53:06] what do they do they just go on with
[53:07] another Vision they just have another
[53:09] Vision they have another Vision the
[53:10] whole time none of them lining up with
[53:12] the word but they have followers in the
[53:15] millions and so does our Lord Jesus
[53:17] Christ Through the Ages his followers
[53:19] have counted Amen brother brandham talks
[53:22] about it's going to be a small number a
[53:24] small number compared to what my brother
[53:26] and sister still going to be a lot of
[53:28] people Amen in glory there's going to be
[53:30] a lot of people there because God
[53:32] Through the Ages has been calling them
[53:34] and he's gave them a vision I said Enoch
[53:37] had a vision Moses in all the struggle
[53:40] had Vision amen all of these men Through
[53:43] the Bible had Vision I'm telling you
[53:46] what man would take his wife into
[53:48] another nation and there she is not
[53:51] maybe even realizing the change see God
[53:54] blinded Abra Abraham also he didn't have
[53:57] Vision that the vision was coming to
[53:59] pass but there's a king saying Hey I
[54:02] want to marry and she's what your half
[54:04] sister I want to marry
[54:06] her because you see sometimes God clouds
[54:09] our vision to not see what the real
[54:11] vision is coming forth like in the time
[54:14] of
[54:16] trouble in the time of struggle you
[54:18] don't feel like you're a Son of God
[54:20] Victorious and Overcomer of this age you
[54:23] don't feel that way but if you have have
[54:25] a vision by revelation of who you are in
[54:27] the word it no matter what is happening
[54:30] here you recognize that's who I am by
[54:34] Vision amen and without that Vision my
[54:37] brother and sister the scripture says
[54:39] that we'd be cost tossed about by every
[54:41] Doctrine you see it took Vision to see
[54:44] the word of this day it took a heavenly
[54:47] vision we often times think this is only
[54:49] for super spiritual people now my
[54:52] brother and sister every one of the
[54:54] bride of Christ will be be led by Vision
[54:56] amen amen the seeing of who we
[54:59] are because if you don't see who you
[55:04] are then you can read the Bible and it's
[55:08] just
[55:09] religion
[55:11] exactly but when you have Vision to see
[55:13] who you are you have Vision to see
[55:16] yourself in the word that's
[55:19] right you know the prophet of God said
[55:22] Catholics make great Believers when
[55:23] they're converted
[55:25] and the reason is is they're so used to
[55:28] being
[55:31] guided now the average message Believers
[55:33] a
[55:35] rebel I'm not talking about you guys I'm
[55:37] talking about somebody
[55:41] else maybe it is people like
[55:44] us but you see some of that
[55:49] training is because in the message Satan
[55:52] has tried so hard to derail it
[55:55] that every time there's a powerful move
[55:57] there's always some kind of other move
[55:59] comes in and tries to parallel that and
[56:02] people get
[56:04] Leary and when Ministry would say you
[56:07] know what God's going to do this or
[56:08] speak direct people they tend to back up
[56:11] because they don't they don't know the
[56:13] last time we encountered something like
[56:15] this it was wrong but I'm telling you my
[56:18] brother and sister because the word
[56:20] promised there is a day and I believe it
[56:22] is here now that God's going to stand
[56:25] behind the word of his ministry it's his
[56:28] word not man's word and it's going to
[56:30] take place and God give us the wisdom to
[56:33] know and to step into that and I I have
[56:36] a little uh saying I I I cherry-picked
[56:40] out of a sermon Amen to to go along that
[56:43] line if you don't mind later amen now
[56:46] when you see the vision of the word for
[56:48] the day you see the vision of God in you
[56:51] amen Christ in you the hope of glory
[56:53] when you see these Visions my brother
[56:55] and sister these are gifts from
[57:00] God now you can get all leery about all
[57:03] this stuff and and say well I don't know
[57:05] about this I don't know about that
[57:07] they're acting awfully
[57:09] spiritual well I hope we all have Vision
[57:11] enough one day to act
[57:13] spiritual a vision one day to be able to
[57:16] say God said it I believe it am amen and
[57:19] so we can move
[57:21] forward
[57:23] now
[57:26] you might say the Lord's never blessed
[57:27] me with a vision in the sense that the
[57:30] prophet had or seers Through the Ages
[57:32] have
[57:33] had but if you have Clear Vision tonight
[57:37] I don't want to put anybody on the spot
[57:39] but I just want us to have an
[57:40] opportunity to express it do we have
[57:43] Clear Vision tonight amen we have Clear
[57:46] Vision because God has given you a
[57:49] vision amen amen we're not looking at
[57:52] religion and hoping my brother and
[57:54] sister it's it's amazing I I I didn't
[57:56] even actually know these people were
[57:58] Catholics sister Jerry and I in a
[57:59] conversation I made a comment and she
[58:01] says well they act like they do because
[58:03] they're Catholics and I was like they
[58:06] are Catholics he says they are Catholics
[58:09] my brother and sister maybe some of us
[58:11] need to go have a rewind into the
[58:13] doctrine and the Theology of Catholicism
[58:16] just far enough to believe what we're
[58:22] told come on I don't be don't take me
[58:24] too awfully serious here and frown like
[58:26] I think we need to go back to
[58:28] Catholicism but my brother and sister
[58:30] there's a people that are coming up out
[58:33] of the word amen they're not coming to
[58:35] the word they're coming out of the word
[58:38] they believe it it's who they are and
[58:41] they identify with it and if God says
[58:44] you're healed they don't care about
[58:46] their circumstance I'm Healed if God
[58:49] says you're delivered they don't look
[58:50] around and say but they say I'm
[58:53] delivered amen you're the bride of
[58:56] Christ I am the bride of
[58:59] Christ because they have the vision of
[59:03] the word living in them that's right and
[59:06] without that Vision if I could say so we
[59:09] become intellectual that's right and we
[59:11] can quote and we can do all kinds of
[59:14] things but not one ounce of life ever
[59:18] comes out of it right my brother and
[59:21] sister you can put a long hair long
[59:23] dress and nice haircut dress decent on
[59:27] any man or woman amen I've told you
[59:29] before about the lady we went to some
[59:32] college classes with Carrie you know I
[59:35] was sure she had to be a Christian
[59:37] everything about her was just polite and
[59:41] correct and nice and atmosphere long
[59:44] hair and long dresses dress modest and
[59:47] the day I sprung it I was fully expected
[59:49] her to say well we're Holiness or we're
[59:51] this and she just looked at me
[59:52] dumbfounded we're hi
[59:57] hippies so we can produce that kind of
[1:00:00] life with a hippie
[1:00:04] Doctrine but we don't want to preach
[1:00:06] hippology here in the church do we so
[1:00:09] that we would all just be nice and kind
[1:00:11] so we start out with a new hippie
[1:00:13] version of the
[1:00:14] message no my brother and sister what it
[1:00:17] is it what separated to carry this
[1:00:19] lovely nice lady just turned out to be a
[1:00:21] great friend and whatever of that time
[1:00:24] my brother and sister that was all well
[1:00:26] and good but what is the difference is
[1:00:29] Vision she was that way because it's
[1:00:31] comfortable for her she she wanted to be
[1:00:34] modest she wanted to present herself
[1:00:36] like a
[1:00:38] lady while she served beer at the Beer
[1:00:40] Garden in
[1:00:42] boisey but you see my brother and sister
[1:00:44] what is a
[1:00:46] separation a vision of who you are
[1:00:49] that's exactly right now Satan did say
[1:00:51] you don't measure up to her or you don't
[1:00:53] measure up to them but if they don't
[1:00:56] have Vision my brother and sister
[1:00:58] there's nothing there to measure up to
[1:01:00] that's right it's the vision of the word
[1:01:02] the coming to them is what makes the
[1:01:05] difference that's right
[1:01:07] amen now right here in the deity of
[1:01:11] Jesus Christ brother brandham puts it
[1:01:14] like this oh how we love him this
[1:01:17] morning may every Christian this morning
[1:01:20] see the vision quickly Lord the hour is
[1:01:23] getting late and I pray that you will
[1:01:25] let them see the vision and take hold of
[1:01:28] Life today and live forever before we
[1:01:31] ask it in Jesus name amen so the prophet
[1:01:35] is speaking this word out Lord let the
[1:01:38] people catch his vision no sir the
[1:01:42] vision of the word the vision of who
[1:01:45] they are the vision of the word in our
[1:01:48] hour God's plan to catch that Vision
[1:01:51] will change their life that they would
[1:01:53] come to to a place and the hour being
[1:01:56] late my brother and sister that was
[1:01:59] 1949 if that was late what is it
[1:02:02] now now much later but we can't say it's
[1:02:06] past due because God's never
[1:02:09] late see we have a problem and I I'll
[1:02:11] expound a little bit on this in in just
[1:02:14] a few minutes if the Lord just leads me
[1:02:15] that way my brother and sister there's a
[1:02:17] whole Spirit moving through the message
[1:02:22] that we have missed something because of
[1:02:26] where we are in
[1:02:31] time well you know Brother David the
[1:02:33] prophet of God said the Rapture was
[1:02:34] going to just take place right here and
[1:02:36] that dat's coming went a long time
[1:02:39] so really well he said
[1:02:43] that he wouldn't lose the
[1:02:46] one Lord I hope it's not me but if I'm
[1:02:49] the one you're still waiting
[1:02:51] on Lord let me get ready
[1:02:54] let me not look at others and not look
[1:02:56] at other churches and other continents
[1:02:58] and Nations and other politics and this
[1:03:00] and that and the other let me go to the
[1:03:02] word and look at myself amen
[1:03:06] amen so it is see when you catch that
[1:03:11] Vision then you can take a hold of life
[1:03:14] now maybe I'm reading too literal in
[1:03:16] this but I'm taking it my brother and
[1:03:18] sister if you can't see the vision you
[1:03:20] can't take a hold of
[1:03:23] Life see seems pretty definitive to me
[1:03:26] but I'll just leave that a little bit
[1:03:28] loose that you can interpret it your own
[1:03:30] way right this is after all just a
[1:03:33] little bit of a glimpse that I and and
[1:03:35] you can read before this and after this
[1:03:38] and make your own conclusion but to me
[1:03:41] my brother and sister there's something
[1:03:42] about the vision and life that is very
[1:03:45] interconnected amen see now my brother
[1:03:48] and sister what we're seeing right now
[1:03:51] taking place in the world is very strong
[1:03:54] very profound and some people would say
[1:03:57] oh don't even look at what's going on in
[1:03:59] the world has nothing to do with us but
[1:04:02] I I beg to differ I say that what's
[1:04:04] going on in the world has a lot to do
[1:04:07] with us and it's not about our Eternal
[1:04:09] destination it's not about our
[1:04:12] understanding it's not about our
[1:04:13] Salvation or our healing but it is my
[1:04:16] brother and sister all of these
[1:04:18] prophetic pieces falling in place and we
[1:04:21] can look then by Revelation by Vision we
[1:04:25] can look at what's happening now my
[1:04:27] brother and sister you guys all know who
[1:04:28] Jonathan K is no doubt and here he is
[1:04:31] with some very good Insight uh tying
[1:04:33] together the very day that our president
[1:04:36] of the United States not our president
[1:04:38] actually because we're not of this world
[1:04:41] Amen but the president of the United
[1:04:43] States signed into law the Defense of
[1:04:45] Marriage Act and they shot the great
[1:04:48] Rainbow on the front of the White House
[1:04:51] and do you realize my brother and sister
[1:04:53] that the date
[1:04:54] corresponds to the time that Israel was
[1:04:58] trying to justify they unlawful by the
[1:05:02] word marriages to the uh Heathen uh uh
[1:05:06] uh uh around them their marriages into
[1:05:09] this country and this country and this
[1:05:11] country and all of the things you take
[1:05:13] that and bring it forward and the Hebrew
[1:05:16] calendar and all of this stuff now I
[1:05:18] don't think that has anything to do with
[1:05:20] us other than to show us God's on time
[1:05:25] yeah and he said now president Mr
[1:05:28] President you might not think much of
[1:05:30] that but you did this in the perfect
[1:05:34] time piece to this right here and it
[1:05:37] lines up
[1:05:39] perfectly now my brother and sister
[1:05:41] when's the last time you thought about
[1:05:42] the Hebrew calendar start checking what
[1:05:45] happened in the news every day back to a
[1:05:47] Hebrew calendar but I say a man like
[1:05:49] Jonathan KH God would put them on the
[1:05:52] earth Amen to speak these things in an
[1:05:55] irrefutable
[1:05:57] manner it's not necessarily bride food
[1:06:00] but it's not leftovers
[1:06:02] either and so we see how God is
[1:06:05] perfectly on time timing these things
[1:06:07] matching these up and this evil here has
[1:06:10] a corresponding place in modern time
[1:06:14] this has a corresponding place this has
[1:06:16] a corresponding place and my brother and
[1:06:18] sister I tell you what if we did enough
[1:06:20] research we'd find out that Enoch had a
[1:06:22] corresponding place in our day amen of
[1:06:26] people who are going to walk off the
[1:06:27] earth not die walk right into the
[1:06:29] presence of almighty God I'm not smart
[1:06:32] enough to figure that all out and put it
[1:06:34] all in there but I know my brother Enoch
[1:06:37] has an influence on me amen he has an
[1:06:41] influence because the word called him
[1:06:44] forth and it was a life he had vision of
[1:06:47] who he was he lived Godly and that was
[1:06:49] there that God says time to go home and
[1:06:52] I want to live an Enoch life am amen I
[1:06:54] don't want to just talk about Enoch life
[1:06:56] I want to live Enoch life amen so what's
[1:07:00] going on we could go into all the
[1:07:02] details of what is happening in Israel
[1:07:06] Hamas their assault upon women and
[1:07:09] children their killing of babies my
[1:07:11] brother and sister that spirit's not new
[1:07:14] that's a Herod Spirit that's a Hitler
[1:07:16] Spirit that's a stallen spirit that's
[1:07:19] all these things that go back in time
[1:07:21] even long before Herod
[1:07:25] amen the way to control a nation don't
[1:07:28] start at the top and go down start at
[1:07:30] the bottom and move up because when you
[1:07:33] start at the bottom you can put fear in
[1:07:34] those at the top and control them with
[1:07:38] fear and so you look at what's happening
[1:07:40] there that has a corresponding
[1:07:43] understanding and it's profound and it's
[1:07:45] shocking and my brother and sister we
[1:07:47] should not let these Natural Things
[1:07:50] overpower our spiritual vision we can
[1:07:53] look at the news I bring this out
[1:07:56] because I know of an individual right
[1:07:57] now that has in their mind decided all
[1:08:01] of this that's happening that we've
[1:08:02] missed the
[1:08:05] Rapture and we're in the
[1:08:08] tribulation and therefore if that's the
[1:08:10] case then brother Brown lied to us and
[1:08:12] they're backing away from the message
[1:08:14] because they lied to us and we're now in
[1:08:16] the tribulation I'll tell you how
[1:08:18] shallow this sounds like judgmental but
[1:08:20] I'll tell you how shallow their vision
[1:08:23] is and they're only seeing the
[1:08:25] corruption bursting forth a little here
[1:08:29] and a little there and when Hell Comes
[1:08:31] To Earth my brother and sister the
[1:08:33] scripture describes it well enough
[1:08:35] Locust with teeth and women mocked and
[1:08:38] people in tear my brother and sister
[1:08:41] that is going to be the hell on Earth
[1:08:44] that the word of God is talking about
[1:08:46] that's going to be
[1:08:49] tribulation and we've had it so good as
[1:08:52] Christians that we think a little
[1:08:54] disruption in the world is suddenly this
[1:08:57] is
[1:08:58] tribulation well my brother and sister I
[1:09:01] spoke at the other day and I will stand
[1:09:02] upon that
[1:09:04] again judgment's coming on America it's
[1:09:07] coming on the world and while we're
[1:09:09] still here as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:09:11] you're going to feel the effects of that
[1:09:13] judgment whether it's in the economy
[1:09:15] whether it's in pandemics whether it's
[1:09:17] in this is in that we're going to feel
[1:09:20] that we're going to see how the rules
[1:09:21] are being tightened and tightened and
[1:09:23] tightened and they're going to get to
[1:09:24] the place they want to see every penny
[1:09:26] and where every penny went and to be
[1:09:28] able to control that and shut your life
[1:09:29] on and off and all of these things it's
[1:09:31] right here and we may or may not have to
[1:09:34] go through the fullness of that I don't
[1:09:36] believe we will the prophet of God
[1:09:38] talked about the bride going home before
[1:09:39] the rap uh before the tribulation amen
[1:09:42] being raptured before tribulation now my
[1:09:44] brother and sister
[1:09:46] but where do we draw the line for
[1:09:50] tribulation well I'll tell you what if
[1:09:52] our vision is is that this is too hard
[1:09:56] now and God allows time to carry
[1:10:00] forward will our vision deteriorate no
[1:10:06] sir you see my brother and sister I was
[1:10:09] just reading about eagle eyes that's
[1:10:12] it if we had the equivalent of an Eagle
[1:10:16] Eye we could watch an ant crawling from
[1:10:20] the roof of a 10 story building yes sir
[1:10:23] right God give me eagle eyes give me
[1:10:26] eagle eyes to see what is going on you
[1:10:28] don't have to show me everything Lord
[1:10:30] just give me an Eagle Eye and so if I
[1:10:33] could be boastful tonight I believe the
[1:10:35] Lord has given me an Eagle Eye and my
[1:10:37] brother and sister what's happening in
[1:10:38] the White House and what's happening in
[1:10:41] the Kremlin and what's happening over in
[1:10:43] Beijing and what's happening all over
[1:10:45] that my Eagle Eye didn't pick that up
[1:10:47] but when I saw a bride who's coming in
[1:10:50] unity with the word my Eagle Eye focused
[1:10:54] on that and said we're getting close
[1:10:56] because there's a people who are valuing
[1:10:58] the word of God much more than the
[1:11:00] things of this world the influence and
[1:11:03] all of prosperities and all of this the
[1:11:05] Eagle Eye is pulling and the Eagle Eye
[1:11:08] is pulling us to the word and we're
[1:11:10] seeing ourselves in scripture we never
[1:11:13] saw oursel in
[1:11:19] before well revelation 10:7
[1:11:27] I see myself in there you beten Malachi
[1:11:30] 4:5 absolutely right I've see myself
[1:11:34] amen that's right now don't
[1:11:36] misunderstand me tonight Malachi 45
[1:11:40] people say it's all about the prophet
[1:11:41] it's about the prophet it's Vindication
[1:11:42] of the Prophet but he says behold I send
[1:11:45] you so he's talking to somebody else and
[1:11:47] my Eagle Eye says that's me that's right
[1:11:49] he's talking about that's who that
[1:11:52] conversation is taking place place with
[1:11:54] was me God was speaking to me amen amen
[1:11:58] that's right so we see that my brother
[1:12:00] and sister what's happening the natural
[1:12:02] it's kind of scary it's kind of shocking
[1:12:05] it's all of this stuff but if we're not
[1:12:07] careful amen people believe that brother
[1:12:13] Brenham said throw the television out
[1:12:16] because of I love sus and all of this
[1:12:18] stuff but you know what I see a
[1:12:20] television doing in this day and age
[1:12:23] planting more negative Spirits in
[1:12:27] households amen than any other thing on
[1:12:35] earth a direct line from Satan's Throne
[1:12:41] Room coming right in to the
[1:12:45] house talking to an individual recently
[1:12:48] and they said I am so afraid for my
[1:12:50] grandchildren's future and I asked them
[1:12:53] why looked at me like I must be crazy
[1:12:56] well look at the condition of the
[1:12:59] world but the minute you try to turn the
[1:13:01] corner and talk spiritual to them that's
[1:13:03] right the door is slammed and you hear
[1:13:05] the deadbolt
[1:13:08] click go on be afraid I don't say this
[1:13:11] lightly these are people I've known for
[1:13:12] years and and considered to be good
[1:13:15] friends that's
[1:13:16] right but you can hear the deadbolt
[1:13:20] clicking they would rather dwell in the
[1:13:23] fear that is known to them that's
[1:13:27] right than the fear of the Lord which is
[1:13:30] unknown to them
[1:13:38] amen fear is an amazing thing I don't
[1:13:40] want to lose
[1:13:41] it but I want to be controlled by the
[1:13:43] right fear amen reverence Amen to my
[1:13:48] Lord so what's happening there's there's
[1:13:51] battles going on all around us any of
[1:13:52] you have battles this week yes sir amen
[1:13:55] those of you that didn't lift your hand
[1:13:56] please pray for me I I need your prayers
[1:13:59] but my brother and sister we have
[1:14:01] battles but look what's happening every
[1:14:03] aspect of our life there is a battle
[1:14:06] going on there there's a battle in
[1:14:09] well-doing
[1:14:11] have you ever felt like what you're
[1:14:13] doing seemingly makes no
[1:14:16] difference a battle in well-doing yet
[1:14:18] the scripture addresses that directly
[1:14:21] don't get weary in your wello doing
[1:14:23] remember that God ordered your footsteps
[1:14:26] to go he ordered your hands he ordered
[1:14:28] your thoughts he ordered your heart this
[1:14:30] wello is not you being a good person and
[1:14:33] becoming tired of it it's you hearing
[1:14:36] the voice of God and following that
[1:14:39] voice and then we do well amen
[1:14:43] hallelujah and look what another battle
[1:14:45] and sometimes I struggle so hard with
[1:14:47] this a battle for our attention
[1:14:50] distraction here distraction there
[1:14:52] distraction distraction until you almost
[1:14:54] feel like you need to just close
[1:14:55] yourself up in a dark room to cut out
[1:14:58] the distraction but my brother and
[1:14:59] sister all it is is Satan vying for our
[1:15:03] attention he's vying for our thoughts
[1:15:05] and he's vying for our time tick tick
[1:15:07] tick on the clock because he knows he
[1:15:10] can waste it look in football they have
[1:15:13] perfected this amen do this little play
[1:15:16] kill the clock play this play kill the
[1:15:18] clock do this kill the clock do the
[1:15:21] clock but if you're ahead you want to do
[1:15:23] that play where you go and I don't know
[1:15:26] much about football anymore I tried to
[1:15:28] forget most of it and the clock is
[1:15:29] ticking and they're out there doing
[1:15:31] their fancy little doing their little
[1:15:33] thing you know whoa oh yes oh tick tick
[1:15:35] tick and 31 more seconds I'm a
[1:15:39] winner and Satan's tick tick tick tick
[1:15:42] tick tick tick tick tick tick
[1:15:44] tick if I can just keep their
[1:15:48] attention that's
[1:15:51] it I read a little quote
[1:15:54] the other day this man said I'm
[1:15:58] amazed we hardly have time to sit in
[1:16:01] church the preacher takes too
[1:16:04] long but we can sit for hours and watch
[1:16:07] our favorite team slaughtered by the
[1:16:09] opposition ex right thought and that
[1:16:13] that's Sports in the day we live in amen
[1:16:17] they can sit there till the last minute
[1:16:18] jump up bust the furniture no no they
[1:16:21] shouldn't allowed that call still behind
[1:16:23] by 50 points yeah but their
[1:16:28] attention now look the scriptures tells
[1:16:30] us in this
[1:16:32] day that there would be no natural
[1:16:39] affection this is a real case real issue
[1:16:43] I've dealt with the sister concerning
[1:16:45] this she's not not
[1:16:48] here her
[1:16:51] husband come home home eat
[1:16:54] supper goes out waxes his
[1:16:58] car almost every single
[1:17:09] day she told him I feel like throwing
[1:17:11] dirt on your
[1:17:13] car and he says I don't care if you do
[1:17:15] or not I'll just wash it
[1:17:18] again no natural affection to a wife and
[1:17:24] children but he loves his black
[1:17:30] Mercedes H now if you have a black
[1:17:32] Mercedes in your garage I'm not
[1:17:34] preaching to you it's just a car and if
[1:17:37] I find that you have too much affection
[1:17:39] to that thing I'll be on the other side
[1:17:41] be assured I'll be over there praying
[1:17:43] the thing breaks down and disappoints
[1:17:45] you because this is just carnal stuff
[1:17:48] that burns up amen it's going to be
[1:17:50] burnt in a fervent Heat and to turn the
[1:17:54] Mercedes back in to iron ore that's
[1:17:57] right but you see my brother and sister
[1:17:59] all of this takes place natural and
[1:18:01] spiritual and I I don't want to sound
[1:18:04] judgmental okay it's not like I run
[1:18:06] around with a magnifying glass looking
[1:18:08] at everybody's life but you really can
[1:18:10] see where priorities are placed in lives
[1:18:14] where people are
[1:18:17] at a brother told me once sorry to go
[1:18:20] off into example but a brother told me
[1:18:22] once we kind of actually found a little
[1:18:24] humor in
[1:18:27] this he said brother my family needs
[1:18:30] help buying groceries and he says well
[1:18:32] the church can help
[1:18:34] you but he says now I have a few
[1:18:36] questions if you don't mind he says sure
[1:18:39] sure he said um you
[1:18:42] make uh you know you have a really good
[1:18:45] job over here in this place and they pay
[1:18:47] really well and make money he says why
[1:18:48] don't you have money for grocery oh I'm
[1:18:50] saving up to buy a new pickup
[1:18:56] placed a pickup over the welfare of his
[1:18:57] own
[1:18:58] family and thought it was perfectly
[1:19:00] normal that we should pass the offering
[1:19:02] plate and you should pay his grocery
[1:19:04] bill while he saves for a new $90,000
[1:19:08] pickup you see my brother and sister
[1:19:10] there's no vision right there that's
[1:19:12] right they're caught up in the whims
[1:19:14] right every wind of Doctrine the
[1:19:16] doctrines are unending of the effect
[1:19:19] they have on
[1:19:21] Humanity
[1:19:23] I don't know if I should go there we
[1:19:25] have young people with us I'll just
[1:19:27] leave that part
[1:19:29] B but you see my brother and sister I
[1:19:31] want you to look at current events not
[1:19:34] with fear but with
[1:19:37] fulfillment this is the word of God
[1:19:39] coming to pass a prophet if you study
[1:19:42] the message like we should you'll find
[1:19:45] that the prophet of God speaks of these
[1:19:46] things and they're laid out it's right
[1:19:48] before us we should be able to come and
[1:19:50] say here it is here it is here it is
[1:19:53] here it is and with that kind of
[1:19:56] pinpoint accuracy we shouldn't have one
[1:19:58] drop of fear we should be saying praise
[1:20:00] the Lord cuz here it is when he says God
[1:20:04] is looking forward to being in the
[1:20:06] presence of his bride amen when we look
[1:20:10] over here and God he says that God loves
[1:20:13] this bride so much he gave himself for
[1:20:17] her amen that's what we ought to be
[1:20:20] looking at it's not about what's
[1:20:22] happening in the
[1:20:23] world oh otherwise you know what I'm a
[1:20:27] cheap skate I'll I'll acknowledge that
[1:20:30] you know I saw a cartoon that was very
[1:20:32] accurate it showed two cities with
[1:20:34] missiles flying out of them and
[1:20:36] explosions up in the air and explosions
[1:20:38] in the city and it had a little deal our
[1:20:40] tax dollars shooting missiles this
[1:20:43] direction then it had a caption over
[1:20:45] here our tax dollars shooting missiles
[1:20:47] over
[1:20:48] here why it's got to come to pass but
[1:20:52] let our vision be reflected that in the
[1:20:56] time of travail Earth shaking travail
[1:20:59] there's a bride who is getting herself
[1:21:02] ready she's standing there and sees
[1:21:04] herself in a smutty dirty world she
[1:21:07] knows she can walk in the word without a
[1:21:10] filth on the Hem of her garment she
[1:21:13] knows that in this age that she can be
[1:21:15] the Overcomer she has confidence in her
[1:21:18] bridegroom it's waiting in anticipation
[1:21:21] for her presence amen amen and and these
[1:21:24] things the ultra critical would say wait
[1:21:27] now isn't this already this and that you
[1:21:30] understand what I'm saying amen The Book
[1:21:32] of Revelations my brother and sister it
[1:21:35] speaks of a lamb's wife making herself
[1:21:38] ready it also speaks of this same Lamb's
[1:21:41] wife who has a voice that is calling out
[1:21:44] in the end time a lamb's wife whose
[1:21:47] voice amen the spirit and the bride say
[1:21:49] come are we speaking what's our vision
[1:21:52] and we're going to speak of what our
[1:21:53] vision is my brother and sister and if
[1:21:56] we're talking about what's wrong in the
[1:21:57] message look I'll tell you the passing
[1:21:59] of our brother Billy Paul amen has
[1:22:01] stirred up all kinds of hornets nest
[1:22:04] there's some over on this side saying
[1:22:05] see another failed prophecy some over
[1:22:08] here saying oh oh these things didn't
[1:22:10] happen that didn't happen I understood
[1:22:12] it to be my brother and sister God
[1:22:14] didn't come and ask you what you
[1:22:15] understood God asked you to stand and
[1:22:18] believe amen cuz look at this there's
[1:22:21] false understanding
[1:22:24] come on have we ever had
[1:22:25] that fuss with the wife I thought you
[1:22:28] said this no that isn't what I said no
[1:22:30] that's what I heard well it's not what I
[1:22:32] said but that's what I heard but the
[1:22:35] minute I stopped the pretext you see
[1:22:37] I'll blame myself in this the minute I
[1:22:39] stopped the pretext that she had to have
[1:22:42] said what I thought she
[1:22:44] said then the conversation gets much
[1:22:47] better we put the vases and the glass
[1:22:49] jars down
[1:22:51] and
[1:22:56] but you see what happens is that so many
[1:22:58] people are like the prophet said
[1:23:00] this is that really what he
[1:23:04] said you have to get behind the
[1:23:07] veil to know what the prophet said
[1:23:11] you've got to get into the vision I tell
[1:23:14] you we got to become one with the
[1:23:15] prophet's Vision we can't say well I you
[1:23:19] know let me let me put this it's a it's
[1:23:22] down a little ways but I want to insert
[1:23:23] it right now you've got young people in
[1:23:25] this day right now standing up with some
[1:23:27] of these apologists going around to the
[1:23:29] universities and whatever else and a
[1:23:31] young man standing up to a mic and say
[1:23:34] um are you trying to say that um I'm not
[1:23:37] a Christian if I disagree with
[1:23:43] God I thought the apologist iy did a
[1:23:46] pretty good job he said well
[1:23:49] mostly God doesn't care about your
[1:23:52] opinion opinion I thought that was
[1:23:53] pretty pretty
[1:23:55] nice but this young man's
[1:23:57] sincere am I still a Christian if I
[1:24:00] disagree with
[1:24:02] god well I I mean let's just cut the
[1:24:04] rubber to the road young and old we know
[1:24:07] to agree with God I think we aren't
[1:24:10] Christlike otherwise God would be
[1:24:12] disagreeing with
[1:24:13] himself so we can't have Christ on the
[1:24:15] inside and disagree with him and say
[1:24:17] we're
[1:24:19] one yeah but see how Satan is got it in
[1:24:22] and they have a different Vision they
[1:24:24] have a vision that we can disagree with
[1:24:26] God that we shouldn't have to do this or
[1:24:27] we can do what we want or this and that
[1:24:29] and still be a Christian so a false
[1:24:32] understanding a false concept gives you
[1:24:34] a false vision of the word and that
[1:24:37] leads us to false conclusions so when
[1:24:40] that's when I I preached here a few
[1:24:42] Services here talking about seeing who
[1:24:44] you are and seeing the word and and my
[1:24:46] brother and sister you see that reason
[1:24:48] that is so necessary is because if we
[1:24:51] have a false conclusion no matter what
[1:24:53] is placed before us we are thinking in
[1:24:56] an entirely different
[1:25:04] light entirely different
[1:25:08] light and when you come to a false
[1:25:11] conclusion you have brought brought face
[1:25:13] to face your
[1:25:16] vision and God's
[1:25:19] Vision will they reconcile
[1:25:23] I know who I'm speaking to tonight so
[1:25:24] don't take this in this context but are
[1:25:27] you going to drag God's Vision over to
[1:25:29] your vision or are you going to submit
[1:25:32] your vision to God's
[1:25:35] Vision the problem we have is too many
[1:25:38] people feel so strongly about their
[1:25:41] Vision that they are willing to pull the
[1:25:45] word
[1:25:47] over I don't know if I should go into
[1:25:49] that or not but maybe I will you know
[1:25:53] when you have someone Post
[1:25:55] online the sister's husband is a husband
[1:25:59] son is a minister and somebody in their
[1:26:01] little assembly posted a question can a
[1:26:04] divorced man be a pastor
[1:26:07] preacher why they posted this I don't
[1:26:09] know they had some kind of
[1:26:11] motive but it was quite interesting to
[1:26:14] read how people's responses
[1:26:17] were and these are message people
[1:26:21] responding and you
[1:26:24] realize marriage and divorce and the
[1:26:26] word
[1:26:28] Timothy there's a whole another
[1:26:30] Vision in the
[1:26:33] message I'm not being judgmental of any
[1:26:38] individual that's just a I guess you
[1:26:40] might say convenient
[1:26:44] example now do we explain a way why our
[1:26:47] vision is
[1:26:49] different than the word
[1:26:53] or do we lay our vision down and say
[1:26:57] Lord help my vision match your
[1:27:02] vision my brother and sister it's simple
[1:27:05] but it's not because this touches every
[1:27:08] aspect of our
[1:27:10] life I'm just going to go ahead and be
[1:27:12] blunt the scripture tells us take
[1:27:16] communion and people go forever and ever
[1:27:19] and ever and ever never take communion
[1:27:22] you ask them why don't you take commun
[1:27:25] it's not convenient for
[1:27:28] me well the Rapture might not be
[1:27:30] convenient
[1:27:34] either submitting ourselves completely
[1:27:37] to the word of God might not be
[1:27:41] convenient but something inside says I
[1:27:45] need to I want to am I preaching too
[1:27:49] hard amen okay good you see what's
[1:27:52] happening when they come up with this
[1:27:54] this is a case that we're we're kind of
[1:27:57] uh dealing with when you come to a false
[1:28:01] conclusion then the devil says now the
[1:28:05] prophet's gone his son is
[1:28:07] gone there's been no
[1:28:10] rapture we were
[1:28:12] misled the world's in the
[1:28:16] tribulation I'm gonna quit serving
[1:28:19] God now that sounds
[1:28:23] interesting doesn't
[1:28:25] it because let me just put it this way
[1:28:27] forget about how you feel about certain
[1:28:30] things can I just be real blunt
[1:28:33] tonight what does what happened with
[1:28:36] brother Billy Paul's
[1:28:38] life and the state of world events have
[1:28:41] to do with your relationship with Jesus
[1:28:44] Christ exactly right our
[1:28:48] vision should supersede that's right
[1:28:51] anything that's it should be above and
[1:28:54] beyond and not measured by anything of
[1:28:57] this world but if we've set our vision
[1:29:00] to a lower standard then when this
[1:29:02] person backslides we question what we
[1:29:05] believe I'm sorry my brother and sister
[1:29:07] when the pope does what the pope does I
[1:29:09] don't give much consideration to it
[1:29:11] because my calling and the Pope's
[1:29:13] calling are two entirely different
[1:29:15] callings amen he's called well we won't
[1:29:17] go there anyway but you look at this my
[1:29:20] brother and sister but you can tell and
[1:29:22] this is what's led me into this thought
[1:29:24] to bring this is when people are
[1:29:26] measuring their Eternal destination by
[1:29:30] this circumstance this circumstance this
[1:29:32] circumstance this circumstance they did
[1:29:35] not have a vision of Jesus Christ in
[1:29:38] their life they didn't see him as the
[1:29:40] Redeemer they didn't see him as the
[1:29:43] grace and the mercy and the blood wash
[1:29:45] that come the lamb slain they didn't see
[1:29:48] him they were looking this person is my
[1:29:51] inner connection if you have that you're
[1:29:53] a
[1:29:54] Catholic and have never left it behind
[1:29:58] our vision is not as it were this
[1:30:01] message with these things our vision is
[1:30:04] the word it is the word made flesh and
[1:30:08] living amongst us and yet people's
[1:30:11] vision is so low that this person fails
[1:30:14] they falter this person moves away they
[1:30:16] start getting cold this event takes
[1:30:18] place they question is this whole thing
[1:30:21] true
[1:30:23] but it is in this time my brother and
[1:30:25] sister the word said when you see this
[1:30:28] take place look up Amen Let Your Vision
[1:30:32] not ride in the world in the dust of Leo
[1:30:35] deia in the tracks of the S serpent amen
[1:30:39] if you guys want to hear a really good
[1:30:40] sermon go listen amen from brother Danny
[1:30:43] steaman preaching trle the serpent at
[1:30:46] Living our literal life amen he lays it
[1:30:49] out just so beautifully my brother and
[1:30:52] sister I'm not looking at the trail of
[1:30:53] the serpent what's the devil going to do
[1:30:55] today where's where's the where's the
[1:30:57] devil at my brother and sister my vision
[1:31:00] is so far above him my vision is not
[1:31:03] what he does or what he
[1:31:05] thinks but my vision is a vision of a
[1:31:09] heavenly vision going into the heavens
[1:31:12] because that's where I was called to
[1:31:14] that's where you were called to was into
[1:31:16] the heavenlies not stick our nose and
[1:31:19] track the serpent my brother and sister
[1:31:23] you talk about getting dizzy and
[1:31:25] forgetting who you are you stick your
[1:31:28] nose down in the devil's business and
[1:31:30] the devil will twist you around to where
[1:31:32] you won't know who you are and why you
[1:31:35] are
[1:31:36] here that's right
[1:31:38] amen the devil says gu give up you
[1:31:41] missed it well that's the devil's
[1:31:44] job why are we listening to the devil
[1:31:48] anyway okay devil draw me a map into
[1:31:51] eternal
[1:31:53] life you know what he would
[1:31:55] do he'd take that piece of paper and
[1:31:58] he'd
[1:32:03] go here you
[1:32:05] go and then I'm not making light but I
[1:32:08] just want to make a point people that
[1:32:10] say I'm going to follow this oh before I
[1:32:14] can believe the Bible I need to learn
[1:32:19] Hebrew and then to understand the Hebrew
[1:32:21] I got to learn
[1:32:22] aramic and then I got to go visit all
[1:32:25] the holy sites and I got to go interview
[1:32:28] a bunch of Palestinians and a bunch of
[1:32:30] Jews
[1:32:32] and
[1:32:34] wait modern day
[1:32:37] Philistines you realize the lineage is
[1:32:40] still in
[1:32:43] Israel and you'll find these
[1:32:46] people you know I need a
[1:32:49] PhD I need to join the biggest Church in
[1:32:52] the city I need to get voice
[1:32:55] lessons I need to do this I need
[1:33:00] to let me tie this back together the
[1:33:05] clock tick tick tick
[1:33:10] tick and we think we wasted a few
[1:33:14] minutes on a family video or movie or
[1:33:18] YouTube how about when Satan gets in
[1:33:21] there and Wast a whole
[1:33:26] life you see how deceptive Satan is I
[1:33:30] personally know people 40 years in the
[1:33:33] message cried shouted praised God shared
[1:33:38] testimonies of the
[1:33:40] supernatural 40 years later have said it
[1:33:43] was all wasted but they don't realize my
[1:33:46] brother and sister as Satan realized all
[1:33:50] he needs is
[1:33:52] control of the last five
[1:33:57] minutes win or lose is always determined
[1:34:00] in the last five
[1:34:03] minutes
[1:34:05] yeah yeah if I could just throw
[1:34:07] something in the natural out to you
[1:34:09] sister Jerry and I are working in
[1:34:11] Mountain Home we're eating at Smoky
[1:34:14] Mountain Pizza right there in the Main
[1:34:15] Street coming off the freeway in
[1:34:17] Mountain Home and there happens to be a
[1:34:19] television on some sport deal on the
[1:34:22] wall and I have to admit all the noise
[1:34:25] all the sports all the whatever I kept
[1:34:28] glancing up at
[1:34:30] it if I was backslid I'm
[1:34:33] backslid but I'm sitting there eating my
[1:34:36] little pizza so yes I was
[1:34:40] backslid and I don't even remember the
[1:34:42] teams it was unimportant what I saw take
[1:34:44] place is what was anchored to me and
[1:34:48] here's his team they said oh they've
[1:34:50] been they've been in the be since the
[1:34:52] moment of the game started they've been
[1:34:54] on the lead and it comes down and the
[1:34:55] other team in 3 minutes does this wild
[1:34:58] crazy play and boom they're ahead now
[1:35:00] and this whole sideline of this team
[1:35:03] that's been ahead for how I don't know
[1:35:04] how long the football game is they're
[1:35:07] all just frowning and they're just all
[1:35:10] the cheerleaders there's no cheer
[1:35:14] left and
[1:35:16] Desperation that team it's down to like
[1:35:18] three seconds four seconds they hike the
[1:35:21] ball the guys are running and crossing
[1:35:24] and doing their whole thing and he
[1:35:25] throws the ball and it's flying and
[1:35:28] there is four Defenders
[1:35:30] surrounding this receiver there's no way
[1:35:33] he's receiving
[1:35:34] anyway I mean face it when we come to
[1:35:36] church and the devil's sitting in front
[1:35:38] of us beside us behind us he's he's
[1:35:41] right there the word's coming forth It's
[1:35:43] been past our way he's jumping up and
[1:35:46] he's got his hand on his shoulder he's
[1:35:47] whispering in your ear he's pulling you
[1:35:49] this way pulling you that there's no way
[1:35:51] you're going to catch the
[1:35:53] word and this Defender leaped higher
[1:35:56] higher than anyone football coming down
[1:35:59] and he tries to catch it one handed like
[1:36:01] this and he hits it and it flies over
[1:36:04] here hits that helmet flies over there
[1:36:07] and bounces off the shoulder of that guy
[1:36:10] comes over here hits the face mask of
[1:36:11] the guy next to him and flies over here
[1:36:14] into the end zone where the offensive
[1:36:17] team this guy is standing there and the
[1:36:20] ball goes
[1:36:26] touchdown and all the sideline Defenders
[1:36:29] and offensive everybody the camera pans
[1:36:33] them and they're all
[1:36:37] like and literally the guy who caught
[1:36:39] the ball suddenly is like looks
[1:36:43] down yes yes
[1:36:47] yes you know that might very well be us
[1:36:50] making the rapture
[1:36:52] the devil's got us surrounded by Devils
[1:36:55] he says there's no way the word's going
[1:36:56] to get to them that rapturing Faith
[1:36:58] ain't going to come but God says it
[1:37:01] can't be stopped I've never lost a one
[1:37:04] and whatever it has to do it can touch
[1:37:07] this and touch that and go here and go
[1:37:10] there it won't matter because that man
[1:37:13] who is in the end zone that wasn't even
[1:37:16] the intended receiver still believed
[1:37:20] enough to run to the end zone he still
[1:37:24] believed enough to play his part of the
[1:37:27] whole story if he had stopped short out
[1:37:30] there somewhere that ball would have
[1:37:32] bounced on the turf and it would have
[1:37:34] been all over but when we will walk and
[1:37:37] say Lord this is a vision you didn't
[1:37:39] tell me how I would be an overcomer in
[1:37:42] every single detail you just told me
[1:37:45] have a vision and walk the straight and
[1:37:48] narrow you go I'll get you there
[1:37:51] but we get drawn this way Satan wants to
[1:37:54] get our vision over here I want to get
[1:37:56] Vision over here wants to get Vision
[1:37:58] over there and we start looking at
[1:38:00] around everybody else I don't know if
[1:38:03] Brother David had been in the end zone
[1:38:04] he could have caught the
[1:38:06] ball Titus he'd been too short maybe
[1:38:09] couldn't run fast enough in these boots
[1:38:11] and this and that and that and that I
[1:38:15] haven't seen that brother in the altar
[1:38:16] in five years well maybe his altar is in
[1:38:18] his
[1:38:20] house maybe God didn't tell him he had
[1:38:22] to come to this
[1:38:25] altar what's our
[1:38:27] vision let our vision be on the goal let
[1:38:32] our vision be on the
[1:38:35] word hallelujah amen you see my brother
[1:38:38] and sister the devil says give up
[1:38:41] there's spirits in the land I'm just
[1:38:43] going to be blunt enough to say there's
[1:38:45] people who tried to plant this spirit in
[1:38:47] our church that says now if God is in
[1:38:50] you in the way you you think he is then
[1:38:52] he's off The Mercy Seat my brother and
[1:38:54] sister the bride of Christ has no fear
[1:38:57] of God being off The Mercy Seat amen the
[1:39:00] prophet himself put in these words and
[1:39:02] said the mercy seat is in the heart not
[1:39:06] on the page not on the bookshelf amen
[1:39:09] not in the CD in the console but the
[1:39:11] mercy seat is in the heart of the
[1:39:14] believer you know that means Wherever I
[1:39:17] Go Everywhere You Go The Mercy Seat is
[1:39:20] with us amen praise God amen amen I'm
[1:39:25] sorry to be so blunt but I think there
[1:39:26] Comes a Day we just have to call black
[1:39:28] black and white white amen and Grace is
[1:39:31] not our compromise amen amen the bride
[1:39:35] knows that this work he began this
[1:39:38] individual that's all afraid now that
[1:39:40] we're in the tribulation so that means
[1:39:42] we've missed the Rapture my brother and
[1:39:44] sister they don't believe they're not
[1:39:46] seeing the vision where God said that
[1:39:48] this work I have began in you that's it
[1:39:52] I will finish it that's right they're
[1:39:56] not seeing that their vision is looking
[1:39:58] at chaos Hamas you know that that word
[1:40:00] actually means chaos one of its
[1:40:03] definitions is chaos so chaos has come
[1:40:05] to the land a fulfillment of
[1:40:09] scripture God told him he'd that told
[1:40:11] Israel I'd bring chaos to you for your
[1:40:14] Disobedience showed
[1:40:17] up but it also showed up in the last war
[1:40:21] War before that
[1:40:23] and weeks whatever we're driving through
[1:40:28] Israel we're coming to a border a lot of
[1:40:30] story went with that particular border
[1:40:33] pretty interesting story somebody asked
[1:40:35] brother George what's up that way he
[1:40:38] said we don't go up that way anymore
[1:40:40] because they surround the buses and they
[1:40:42] bash all the windows out of the buses
[1:40:45] we're in a Palestinian occupied
[1:40:48] area we don't go there
[1:40:53] and somebody saidwell does anybody get
[1:40:54] off brother George says if you get off
[1:40:56] the bus they'll beat you to
[1:41:00] death that's
[1:41:03] chaos but you know that's nothing to the
[1:41:06] chaos of the spirits that are moving up
[1:41:09] and down these streets right here that's
[1:41:11] right that's nothing compared to the
[1:41:13] chaos that's in our Public Schools
[1:41:15] that's right the chaos that's in our
[1:41:17] government brother Chris preached that
[1:41:19] about how that that those Spirits are
[1:41:21] hidden in the church we're going to take
[1:41:23] that my brother and sister in the
[1:41:25] context of church overall nominal
[1:41:28] everything
[1:41:30] chaos
[1:41:33] chaos I made a reference the other day I
[1:41:35] felt kind of bad for making it but I'm
[1:41:37] going make another reference and I'll
[1:41:38] feel bad about this but my brother and
[1:41:40] sister when you got a church full of two
[1:41:43] three th000
[1:41:45] people I'm going to be really kind and
[1:41:47] say a lady with hair as short as
[1:41:49] mine getting up and telling the church
[1:41:54] about the vision she had last
[1:42:00] night I don't know there's just
[1:42:02] something in my vision that says I can't
[1:42:04] accept that
[1:42:06] Vision because that vision is not
[1:42:08] fitting the word not judging the
[1:42:10] individual the lady appears to be a very
[1:42:13] nice
[1:42:14] lady but that doesn't fit the word so
[1:42:17] the channel of my
[1:42:19] vision
[1:42:22] it's not in the
[1:42:25] picture sister Jerry took a
[1:42:28] picture when we were in Israel I don't
[1:42:31] remember what church that was but
[1:42:33] there's a window and the church would be
[1:42:36] behind where the pulpit would be and a
[1:42:39] cross is in that window Christian
[1:42:42] church and sister
[1:42:45] Jerry positioned that cross just like
[1:42:48] crosshairs on the Dome yeah I remember
[1:42:52] at the time joking with her almost looks
[1:42:55] like you're siding a missile or
[1:43:00] something but I don't bring it up to do
[1:43:02] with that I bring it up that's how
[1:43:04] zeroed in we got to be that's right that
[1:43:07] where we're going the cross yes sir is
[1:43:09] our Crosshair amen is our guide that's
[1:43:12] it not what this brother thinks not what
[1:43:14] that church is doing not what these
[1:43:16] people over in another continent are
[1:43:17] doing my brother and sister what are we
[1:43:20] doing amen
[1:43:21] if we will get our crosshairs our Focus
[1:43:25] On Christ alone then our prayers will
[1:43:28] change those around us that's right we
[1:43:31] have loved ones we say I want to see my
[1:43:32] loved ones saved well praise the Lord
[1:43:34] the prophet of God says apply the token
[1:43:37] get your life right first amen then God
[1:43:41] will be obligated Amen to answer your
[1:43:44] prayers but you know what if I could
[1:43:47] close on this very happy note I don't
[1:43:50] know that God's obligated to a lot of
[1:43:51] our
[1:43:57] prayers cuz we're a
[1:43:59] Miss come on don't frown at me come on
[1:44:02] you guys know I love
[1:44:04] you I just want to know what's your
[1:44:10] vision what is it we're seeing where do
[1:44:12] we see
[1:44:14] ourselves career coaches start with
[1:44:18] where do you want to be a year from now
[1:44:21] where do you want to be five years from
[1:44:24] now 7
[1:44:26] 10
[1:44:29] 25 well I tell you what if I God would
[1:44:32] Grant it I
[1:44:35] think I think Paul's
[1:44:40] life need some cleaning up and
[1:44:43] polishing because the closer my vision
[1:44:47] gets the more Paul gets in the way
[1:44:52] the closer the focus of my vision comes
[1:44:56] there are more I realize Paul needs to
[1:44:58] deal with this and Paul needs to deal
[1:45:00] with
[1:45:03] this my brother and sister I don't think
[1:45:06] we're close enough or clear enough
[1:45:09] unless we look at our life literally and
[1:45:11] say Lord I need to die today that's it I
[1:45:14] want to die today don't I I don't need
[1:45:16] God to force me to die I want to die
[1:45:20] today
[1:45:21] amen and when our vision gets to that
[1:45:23] point amen I think we're really close to
[1:45:26] the Rapture I think we're right there to
[1:45:29] step over into that me or theophany amen
[1:45:34] oh my thank the Lord hallelujah you love
[1:45:37] the
[1:45:38] Lord amen I don't know if I take your
[1:45:41] time to go ahead
[1:45:45] and preach some of these other
[1:45:48] things I think I'll just skip over some
[1:45:50] some of this it's a it's different but
[1:45:53] it's the same but I will I drew a little
[1:45:56] thought out of the sermon I was not
[1:45:59] disobedient to the heavenly vision just
[1:46:01] a line here it's not even in the
[1:46:03] computer I didn't put it on there
[1:46:05] brother Gideon so I'm really
[1:46:07] cherry-picking okay I saw that one
[1:46:09] Cherry up on the tree there that was
[1:46:11] just the biggest most beautiful of all
[1:46:13] the cherries and I Cherry Picked brother
[1:46:15] brandom says if your faith is strong
[1:46:18] enough to throw yourself into the
[1:46:20] Vision it can be for you that's right if
[1:46:25] not it isn't that's
[1:46:28] it what is this Vision to us amen I want
[1:46:33] to be able to claim that Vision that's
[1:46:38] it I want to have enough Faith to say
[1:46:42] Lord that word was for me I claimed it
[1:46:47] amen and watch it come to pass that's
[1:46:50] right
[1:46:51] amen sister
[1:46:54] via
[1:46:58] amen you see I have a whole deal out
[1:47:01] tied to this uh and I knew I was just
[1:47:05] stacking up way too many groceries
[1:47:07] here but Joshua 1
[1:47:10] 1-8 I'll just give you a quick glimpse
[1:47:12] of this is when God is dealing with
[1:47:15] Joshua and says now after the death of
[1:47:17] Moses servant of the Lord it came to
[1:47:19] pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the
[1:47:20] son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses
[1:47:23] my servant is dead now therefore arise
[1:47:26] go over this Jordan and all this people
[1:47:28] into the land which I do give to them
[1:47:30] even the children of Israel every place
[1:47:32] that the soul of your foot shall treade
[1:47:34] upon and I have given unto you as I said
[1:47:36] unto Moses and we jump right down here
[1:47:39] to verse
[1:47:41] S or verse six I mean be strong and of
[1:47:44] good
[1:47:45] courage it's no place for
[1:47:48] wimps my brother and sister are serving
[1:47:51] God in the ospice of the message it's no
[1:47:55] place for wimps God's weeding the wimps
[1:47:57] out go read a story about the Army
[1:47:59] Rangers or the Navy Seals these are fine
[1:48:02] men of great character but when they
[1:48:04] don't fit they're weeded out that's
[1:48:07] right and God is weeding out the wimps
[1:48:10] that want religion that makes them feel
[1:48:12] good I want religion that changes me
[1:48:16] well I don't want religion really at all
[1:48:19] if you understand the content but I want
[1:48:22] that but you know what I need to be
[1:48:25] strong and of good courage there's times
[1:48:28] I'm I'm not very courageous there's
[1:48:30] times I'm a little bit
[1:48:32] chicken-hearted amen now I want the
[1:48:34] reason I wanted to go on with this I
[1:48:35] wanted to bring this out because verse
[1:48:37] eight there in Joshua is talking about
[1:48:39] the book of the law is the book of the
[1:48:43] law it's the
[1:48:45] word do you realize now don't take me
[1:48:48] 100% in depth here but when you realize
[1:48:53] when people say I don't live under the
[1:48:55] law I live under grace you know what
[1:48:59] they're really saying can I interpret
[1:49:01] that for you I can ignore the word of
[1:49:06] God and ask God to help me when I want
[1:49:11] him
[1:49:12] to cuz I don't live under the law they
[1:49:15] don't live under
[1:49:17] this they don't live under this they
[1:49:20] just want
[1:49:21] Grace well I tell you what I want to
[1:49:25] live with the
[1:49:27] law so what's our vision of the
[1:49:31] law Christ in you that's right the hope
[1:49:35] of
[1:49:36] glory there's our vision of the law his
[1:49:40] word says I'll cleanse you I'm cleansed
[1:49:43] his word says I'll F you I'm filled his
[1:49:46] word says I'll change you I'm changed
[1:49:49] why I'm believing the word I'm believing
[1:49:53] and the law of Nature has to follow the
[1:49:55] law of God God bless you tonight amen
[1:49:59] I've kept you just a smidge long amen
[1:50:03] hallelujah someday I'll learn to control
[1:50:06] my
[1:50:07] studies amen let's just stand I'd like
[1:50:10] to just sing a couple of those old hymns
[1:50:12] that kind of struck me amen 93 don't
[1:50:16] lose your vision of Jesus Amen key of f
[1:50:21] amen somebody help me
[1:50:25] Amen brother Alex if you're done you're
[1:50:28] done interpreting you come help
[1:50:31] me pray for me Saints I tell you I was
[1:50:33] so sick last night I
[1:50:38] uh
[1:50:40] yeah I went to bed last night and I woke
[1:50:44] up just feeling Beyond
[1:50:47] horrible realized i' only been asleep
[1:50:49] for a few minutes not very long at
[1:50:52] all and uh I just struggled through the
[1:50:55] night kept waking up just very sick
[1:50:58] won't go into that
[1:50:59] detail and uh you know I just thought oh
[1:51:03] man you know I'd had a little
[1:51:05] conversation brother Chris and I thought
[1:51:07] man I I should I should change that but
[1:51:09] there's something bubbling up inside of
[1:51:11] me that says you know I I really would
[1:51:13] like to preach this I really like to
[1:51:16] preach this you know so you know um I
[1:51:19] like roses
[1:51:20] if I die before I get out of here
[1:51:21] tonight I like roses amen you plant a
[1:51:25] rose bush around my headstone that way
[1:51:27] nobody will come and bother it won't tip
[1:51:28] it over because it can't get through the
[1:51:29] Roses but my brother and sister God's
[1:51:32] giving us that kind of zeal to serve him
[1:51:35] sick healthy sick crippled whatever I
[1:51:40] want to serve him I want to give myself
[1:51:42] to him I want to make myself available
[1:51:45] for God to work and you know I felt well
[1:51:48] probably about 5:30 this afternoon I I
[1:51:51] finally felt better and praise God I
[1:51:54] went and sat down and closed my eyes for
[1:51:57] a minute and and uh well praise God here
[1:52:00] we are and if it wasn't for the sake of
[1:52:01] that clock I'd finish this sermon and
[1:52:03] we'd get out of here about 10:30 but my
[1:52:06] brother and sister that's the Zeal I
[1:52:08] want to have for my Lord Jesus that's
[1:52:11] the heart's desire that's the vision
[1:52:13] that I want to see if I have to lay my
[1:52:15] life down I going to lay it down for
[1:52:16] this word I want to lay it down for the
