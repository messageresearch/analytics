a privilege it is to be in the Clift of the rock to be able to live in his presence you know the song says touched touching his grace but the truth of it is my brother and sister we are touched by grace Grace amen the word of God shows us clearly that there's no strength no ability and our brother Chris just mentioned that he's been listening to that service about weakness and um actually this little study started out to be about weakness and strength but well we ended up here amen but by God's grace my brother and sister it's never our own ability aren't you glad that God says you're worthy that I'll pour myself into you amen it it always just makes my heart just so thankful because you know brother brandham talks about those people you know that are maybe just a little H higher oh I don't remember the exact words but you know the just uh things are a little more intense we're doing and and you just realize sometimes you know lord it's just your grace otherwise we would just be rocked to the right and to the left and tossed and driven but by God's grace amen he says I'm just going to let Grace touch you today I'm going to calm your spirit I'm going to calm the atmosphere around you and I say thank you thank you Lord Jesus amen yeah wonderful thank you brother Chris wonderful song service our musicians God bless you amen we just uh want to speak to you this evening um just uh one of the things you know of Life uh you end up cooped in my case I end up cooped in a tractor for for hours upon hours day after day but we don't want to waste that time so we just listen to the prophet just start digging in focusing on what he's saying and and uh listen to those things and I've just in really actually on that side enjoyed uh such a lovely atmosphere to be there by myself and uh just listening to the word I would like to turn tonight to Luke 24 starting with verse 32 and uh we're going to just catch this right on the very heels of these brothers on the road to emus and our lord Jesus coming out and talking to them walking with them and uh just want to just to take that right there at verse 32 amen um I'll take time just to mention right now that sister Jerry and I will be going to Arizona on the 17th to uh watch can you believe this we're just children and we've got a grandson graduating and it just seems so strange yeah I know Brother David but you're older we don't have to say by how much right but it just but it isn't it strange Brother David just to come to a stage in life and you you you just realize that your children's children are adults and uh it's a shocking position but anyway so we will be gone that weekend I believe of the 17th uh so just wanted to put that out early so it doesn't come as a shock God bless you brother Trevor sister Carrie traveling nomads amen verse 32 and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us and I just want to insert this right now we should be able to say that tonight it won't be about who preached and who led songs but just simply the fact that our lord Jesus is with us so we could say our hearts burned within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us us the scriptures and they rose up the same hour in other words they didn't dially they didn't sit back and say we'll have to ponder this a month or two to see what happens but they returned to Jerusalem and found the 11 gathered together and them that were with them saying the Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in Breaking of bread now we look at this my brother brother and sister they broke natural bread but we also understand in the scripture that the breaking of bread is spiritual amen so it wasn't just they sat down and ate together but there was something in the atmosphere that changed at that moment and as they thus spake Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto him them peace be unto you what does the word tell us when we talk about him he draws nigh to us amen my brother and sister they weren't there talking about ESPN sports they weren't there talking about politics they were talking about him and in that conversation he came in their midst oh Lord let's take that as an example let's take that as something that we hold amen but they were terrified and AR frighted and supposed that they had seen a spirit now I just want to interject this right here cuz my thought will go a little different direction I was just listening to the prophet of God chide brandom Tabernacle for being afraid of the presence of God the Holy Spirit I want you to catch this we get ideas that that was the perfect place to go to church how good it would be should move across the country to be there the prophet of God is telling him you're distracted by the world amen now I'm not throwing this back at brandham Tabernacle my brother and sister but I'm telling you the prophet did not have favorites the people he loved he loved them enough to tell them the truth amen aren't you glad that the lord loves us enough to tell us the truth amen they were terrified and frightened supposed that they had seen a spirit and he said unto them why are the ye troubled and why do f arise in your hearts behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not Flesh and Bones as ye see me have and when he had thus spoken he showed them his hands and his feet and while they yet believe not for joy and wondered he said to them have ye here any meat and they gave him a piece of broiled fish and of honeycomb and he took it and did eat before them and said unto them these are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me amen then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scripture amen Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord as you are so gracious so merciful father Lord we think about all the times we have come short in our lives all the times that we have let thoughts come into our our spirit Lord be affected by the things of this world Lord how many times has the turmoil of the world we live in uh brought an emotion or an influence upon us and sometimes one of Despair some times one of maybe just outright fear father anxieties Lord and all of that we know that Satan would desire to draw us away from our confidence in the word coming to pass but we are here tonight Lord I I pray that you help us just to express this in the fashion father that you laid it upon our heart that it would be real to us to recognize Lord what is happening in our day we thank you your grace your mercy be with each and everyone that is not here tonight be travel or wherever it might be or whatever might have kept them from the house of God we just ask for your presence to be with them strengthen us we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated I'll try to kind of restrain myself a little bit on Sunday I just ran my voice right to the very end and I just kind of had to tone that back a little bit but you know when things burn in your heart you just feel like you got to share them so just a little prayer for me that my voice will will be able to handle this and we'll start with verse 32 and and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scripture and so it was there these brothers amen were walking and uh our lord Jesus was himself preaching to them and and recounting scripture and laying it all and my brother and sister we recognize that in our condition in life our travels our our struggles sometimes uh we're brokenhearted we don't fully understand what God's plan is and you know uh we need someone to preach to us and how much more so that we let the Lord Jesus Christ preach to us amen that we would not look as it would be this is a brother so and so or brother so and so but we would look and realize that Christ himself through the word promised that he would be here today that he would lead us and he would guide us and and the preaching of the word comes and I I tell you just in the last uh few months the preaching of the word has taken on a new Essence in my own heart I I just Rejoice you know now don't misunderstand me but sometimes you'll listen to a sermon and if you're not careful uh uh brother will be preaching his heart out and and we'll we'll say I've heard that I know that I've heard that I know that but how about we stop looking at what we do know and say Lord would you just open what I've already heard amen see these people these brothers I should say not just people have already heard this preached but our lord Jesus has come back on the road to emus to remind them amen not just like yep we heard you say it we heard you say it but when he spoke to them it took on a new life amen and I say Lord just help me sit in the service whenever I would just be in the audience and Lord just let it take on a new life let it not be a thought I've heard this before but let today be the day that the word takes on a new life and changes my understanding my thinking may it take a complex I may be carried and just take it from me May it take something I've questioned in the scripture and just Enlighten it to me because we see my brother and sister these brothers on the road to Emmas were not heathens they were not just fresh to the message but they were men that had heard our lord Jesus speaking and yet they're walking along saying why did this turn out I thought it was to be like this I thought that being a Christian would be a easier walk I thought when the message came from me I would just be able to rise up and say Satan get thee behind me and why is it Satan in essence seems to be mocking me because I can't seem to break through because maybe I need to hear it again that's right maybe as we look and see Jesus never condemned them look I already told you didn't you get it the first time he's there no I'm here to tell you what I've already told you that it must come to pass and now I tell you my brother and sister and one thing that must come to pass is our full comprehension of the word amen amen we can't go with just God sent a prophet it's got to get down at that personal level where before the foundation can I share that for a moment tonight before the foundation of the world God said I'm going to create a little atmosphere and I'm going to place Paul in that atmosphere and Paul is an inferior vessel but he is my vessel can you relate with me and when we come to the place we realize it's not about how great our vessel is but it's the fact that God chose to inhabit that vessel amen that God chose to say you're mine and he put himself in us and claimed us oh hallelujah amen so he's preaching and the word needed to be open and I tell you as we look at this you can see very clearly our ears I'm talking to Believers tonight I'm talking to Sons and Daughters of God our ears still need to be open we didn't have just a complete Revelation that we've heard it but my brother and sister we need him to speak and Lord let my ears be open more than they've ever been before amen let my eyes be opened like never before Lord I want to walk on this road with you Lord and I want to hear what you've got for me I want to see what you've got for me I want to believe what you've got for me and I want to see what that is coming to pass in me that's right in other words magnified [Music] Hallelujah Believers still needed to hear the anointed word amen we all like to talk positive I remember being in some meetings one time and a brother making a great emphasis I understood where he was going but I wondered if a lot of the people did and and he was like you should just never ever never ever walk in a cloud you're believer you're Son of God you should be claiming sunshine and walking in the sunshine all the time and I thought you know what I I believe that but the battle is there we can say Amen to it but the battle's still there [Music] Hallelujah you know yesterday you need day for the weather right it was Idaho and through the day as I'm sitting there in a tractor I alternately had the heater on and the air conditioner on and then I turned the heater back on and before the day was over I had the air conditioner on my brother and sister I hope you catch the analogy that's where we're at sometimes amen heater cold hot cold hot cold hot and God doesn't come and rebuke us on the way he walks with us and opens the word up to us that when we hear we can literally go back in the Fellowship of the brother and say he's alive he's alive he's present he's with us amen I tell you we can be discouraged by circumstance and in just a moment or two have our hearts on fire when he speaks to us sir the word is living it's so interesting my brother and sister I love to read and you know you pick a book up that that you've read before and you'll start to read it and and if the book is a well-written book The Essence of the book will keep your attention to continue to read there's never been a book like this book that's right that can grab our attention but Satan will do everything he can to keep us from even picking the book up because he knows if we pick the book up it will change our circumstance our vision of what is happening around us will no longer be Doom and Gloom what is happening with Russia and Israel and this and this and this I'll tell you what's happening a bride is getting ready and she's on her way out of here amen she's not caught up in what will happen here I seen a little article the other day and this man has done all this research about how they have built detainment camps up in the north amen and I I have no doubt that he's telling the truth you know that this is what's going to happen people that are denters and don't fit in are going to be placed in these camps maybe possibly exterminated and you know you can't help reading something like that without a twinge of apprehension until he comes and walks with us and says all that I told you before in my word must must come to pass everything must come and be set in order nothing can be out of order and if God give it order my brother and sister and we're in God amen in Christ then we don't have to worry about what's Happening Here What's Happening Here What's Happening Here should we buy crypto or gold the currency is going to fail the econom is going away every bit designed to draw the attention of the believer away from the word let's go ahead and walk to EMAs he left us the job is not finished we did not have that Authority and power that he was speaking of we don't see a new kingdom we don't see these things having come to pass what are we going to do and he steps out amen has he stepped out amen I say he has stepped out and he's walking with us tonight and all we've got to do is get back to what he promised us the critic say about William Brandon but I tell you my brother and sister it was God speaking amen amen it's not man speaking it's God speaking amen so they can criticize a man and feel comfortable but if they were standing in the presence of Jesus Christ it would be a different atmosphere or let me take it to another level as the thinking of man if they were standing directly in the presence of God God they would be afraid how's that saying go fools walk with hob nail shoes Where Angels feared to trot but look at the Spirit of the day we're walking we're living in amen let someone pass the way and they'll criticize them very roundly where they would never accept a challenge fac face to face that's the spirit of the age Hallelujah so here we are my brother and sister we might be discouraged by the circumstance but a heart that is on fire amen is a heart that is resistant to Satan's communication amen it is a resistant as our brother said you you know you find yourself on the end of the bridge having a conversation with the devil my brother St I like that comment cuz you see if we're not careful we get in the conversation with the devil don't even realize we're talking to him we just think it's just a normal thing but he's there you're not going to make it I love the song service tonight if felt like it fit with what I was thinking you know we're we're only touching the tip of the iceberg we really are Saints we're here in the flesh maybe it's God's intentional purpose for us to only touch the tip of the iceberg now but do you realize I'm kind of ahead of myself but you we've got so close now it's not Theory anymore and I use the word theory very Loosely I believe you understand me there there's a new Heaven A New Earth wow wow how do we comprehend I tell you how we comprehend we walked this road far enough and he's walked with us far enough when he said I have a home for you a mansion for you we just praise God I've got a mansion that's it not a theory nobody has to prove to me that this going to come to pass this is real now the world's going to say you're crazy but really let's be honest you're on the bus with them they're crazy you don't even have to be spiritual to stop and say this world is going crazy I'm going to say something I hope it's not offensive this is something through the years getting married having a family all the things of life seems like I work way too much I'd still rather be a man come on do you understand me and yet men want to be women I'll bet if they had to go through the whole process they wouldn't want to be and yet sometimes I think oh come on wife you got life good get up cook breakfast I don't know maybe another nap right after that I don't know what she does it's best sometimes just to leave the house and not look back I wouldn't trade two three naps a day for being a woman I told I don't know what I don't know what she does but you see the spirit of the age confusion that's right distraction false communication what do they call those false Flags Satan's throwing them out you realize no new spirits in the land my brother and sister the prophet of God showed us clearly no new Spirits it's not like the Devils had a new spirit out there these Spirits have always been here and we're not going to go into the attribute by which they manifest themselves but the spirit will lump it under this distraction Satan wants to keep us from seeing who we really are and he can throw this out and throw this out and throw this out and it keeps us pulled here and pulled there and we don't see who we are and those two brothers walking down the road to emus were there and could very well without the presence of our Lord Jesus come convince themselves it was finished but he said I'm going to meet you I'll meet you in there amen hallelujah not a little building my brother and sister in that envelop of the Holy Spirit spirit in that realm my brother and sister where he draws you and I into his presence and he filled us with the Holy Ghost can you explain how that happened impossible but it happened and it will happen again and again as as Sons and Daughters of God come to him it will happen again it's not a one-time thing it's happening even in this very moment God wrapping himself around individuals and filling them with his spirit amen hallelujah amen as you look at this they're walking he's opening the word we're walking he's still opening his word amen it's not a closed book that we go back to a reference of what happened you know 2,000 years ago I'm telling you God has walked the aisles of this church in the lives of Sons and Daughters of God almost every service I can testify of something that has happened and we should be saying Lord I want my portion I'm not going to sit here and I'm not going to be sitting on the Pew just as an observer I am a participant I am the one the word is talking about I am the life that was declared to be changed I will be changed Hallelujah I didn't even have them put this on the screen but it's out of now I'm going to I'm going to put a little disclaimer not disclaim claimer that's not right a little deal uh um you know a few Services ago that brother Chris preached he he spoke a quote out of this service a deceived Church by the world and and it got my interest and I thought I want to listen to that service that sermon amen and it's very good if you guys will accept a homework assignment I would encourage you to listen to it it's very straightforward no beating around that bush that bush got turned into a tu and got hauled away amen so it's there that God wants us not to beat around the bush he wants us to recognize because we don't even have a clue how slippery the devil is he's so Sly not going to curse him we're going to expose him yeah no no good to stand back and say oh devil get go this that listen to me I command you the devil just sits back who are you but when you've got the word he just doesn't know what to do with the word because it exposes him but you know what happens the devil gets people to thinking if the word exposes it's exposing me no it's not it's exposing the devil that's exactly right amen you're a son or daughter of God but the devil so wraps us up in this false who we are that we think that's us us that's right now brother Brown says here just this is a little excerpt just drawn out of this the success of the church lies within the preaching of the Gospel of the power of God Amen that's short and sweet isn't it we probably could just say s now and let's sing a song or two and dismiss right there because I'm telling you my brother and sister I want Grace Tabernacle my heart and I want Grace Tabernacle to be a successful Church the prophet of God typing this in in this sermon is is not the size of the steeple it's not the size of the choir it's not the amount of the people that are in the congregation or how educated the preacher is but it's how much Liberty the Holy Ghost has to move in our lives to change our life and there's times that I truly believe in the humor as it were if you want to call it that of God when he said it's by the foolishness of preaching because we preach I think Brother David brother Chris would agree we preach and sometimes you feel foolish afterwards well why did I say it like that that wasn't the really the way that I I thought would but that's the way God wanted it to be and so therefore it's by the foolishness of the preaching let's hit verse 35 and we'll kind of go on there now they were told that things were were done in the way they shared a testimony and how he was known at the breaking of the bread amen as I said before that's twofold right spiritual natural and as they thus spake Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said unto them peace be unto you my brother and sister let's be honest we can read the scripture and say well what kind of Revelation they had same kind you have if our lord Jesus stood right here visible form tonight we would probably be shocked be stunned be be whatever because it would be something that's so far out of our own senses but he's here amen absolutely right he's here he just chooses to reveal himself where the devil would want you to say oh he wouldn't do that he sure would that's right that's what his word says that's right he sure would am so he's here to reveal himself to you and I tonight but yet we would be shocked if we visibly saw him right that's just that human element it's who we are it's how it works amen so he stands in the midst of them he says peace they're terrified they're frighted seeing a spirit and he says unto them why are you troubled and why do thoughts arise in your hearts what was he doing do he knew the very reaction and now I'm just going to go off on a limb I hope you don't mind some of them would be like before I come to Jesus we were into spiritualism and oh my another would be my mind was in the wrong place and I realized he knew where my mind was at every everyone had a different reason but the truth of it was Jesus didn't turn it was within his ability to say you've got a spirit you've done this you've done that um as it were he's without sin go ahead and cast the first stone and he says don't don't be afraid don't let that in your heart it is I it is I they knew him Saints but it was so far out of the realm I tell you what that's why denomination today well they have to fulfill their portion of scripture but that's why denomination today cannot deal with this is because they've got Christ in a box of History that's right they've got him firm firmly wrapped up in the Box nailed shut of history with a declaration of what he would and would not do I always find it interesting that people talk about what God meant when they have not a clue of God Amen well this is what he means really you need to know Christ first and even then his ways are higher than our ways behold my hands and my feet go ahead handle me he was not afraid he wanted them to see but I tell you what my brother and sister if you can just step over another step with me here I want to handle him I want to handle him amen I'm not a doubting Thomas I want to handle him you know what that means to handle him you've got to get close up close and personal you have to almost as it were meld or merge or be bound with him amen I think it's time we as a church get afraid get away from being afraid of handling amen our Lord Jesus Christ be a uh get over the fear of handling the word and having confidence of what the word is in you and I and to be so intimate with him that we can actually say I have been in his presence I've been touched by him and he has touched me and I have touched him how is that brother Paul because we have a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity so that means we're touching him with our hearts cry with the need of our life with the things of family and relationship and our own spiritual health we can touch him my brother and sister we're not here hoping that he just comes by on a whim to touch us one day but he is responding to us amen look on me handle me wrap your arms around me see that I'm present with you amen you see he was the revealed word that's right people are afraid of the revealed word I I hope this isn't too rough too critical there's people that name the name of the message are afraid of the revealed word because remember where there's fire there's cleansing amen some are afraid to come to the fire that's right and some are willing let let there be more Shadrach mesach and Abednego of this day what is it they're sending me to the fire no problem they weren't thinking about Christ meeting them in the fire they were thinking about I'm ready to meet Christ and if I have to pass through the fire to meet him I'm ready to go through the fire but he saw their faith he saw their heart he saw the desire and he knew his word and he met them in the fire and you tell me science will tell you can't happen but I'll put this word of God above science any day of the week amen oh Hallelujah so they were they were a little shocked you know of what was going on and I hope you don't mind but when I was studying this I had just a little bit of humor come up in me and and Jesus is talking to them so sincere and they're trying to deal they're coping digesting their anxiety and their fear and they're looking there and realizing this is the Lord Jesus Christ and he is here in our midst and then he says you got any food is that what he said brother Trevor wow what was he doing he was proving to them am that when he said I know the feelings of your infirmities he was hungry he was hungry he's connected to us Saints he's not a god floating out in ether land just seeing if we can perform like some kind of circus act no sir he feels the feeling of our infirmity now hallelujah amen so he eats the fish in the honeycomb and then he reminds them look this is a time that's a little bit of chiding he reminds them I've already told you all this do you guys ever hear the preacher I just preached on this but we're going to preach on it again that's right I already told you this when I was walking or with you before sir but because you guys are probably sleeping and distracted and thinking about your bank account and thinking about your car going to the shop and thinking about this and thinking about that you missed it that's right he doesn't say a single word about that that's right he just comes and says I've already told you that here it is again aren't you glad amen I can tell you right now I'm standing here tonight so thankful amen that the Lord didn't say you didn't listen the first time you're out that's right cuz I would be out amen right come on I I you know I've shared my testimony a fair amount through the years here at the church other places but there's a lot I left out because it doesn't edify it doesn't give any encouragement but I'll tell you of that portion the fact that God loves us enough he come back and said come on am come onise the Lord and I still told him no and he come back and said come on come on and if he didn't do that I would be lost but he does it amen and I say thank you Lord hallelujah and he tells them these words I spake unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled that ought to give us joy my brother and sister because there's not one portion that politics and world wars and whatever else can supersede it must all be fulfilled amen what's written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me in other words everything in this book concerning Christ must be fulfilled amen hallelujah and we have that word tonight Saints that's right we're not looking at history we're not looking back there we're looking at the word is being spoken not through Paul tonight but through Christ to his church again the same word the same promise the same reminder so let's not be distracted amen you know there's a sub subtle very subtle side move in the message and it's called denomination and you'd say that's not very subtle but it is it is it is because it's what causes us I won't do it but it causes us sit down on the Pew on our hands because I'm just supposed to be here well the church can run without you someone will say Amen someone will believe it that's right the church can run without you if you think that's the only purpose God had for you in this great Universe before the foundation of the world was okay the first 50 he'll go to church no sir he chose us amen he chose us Saints let's get that in our head he chose us amen and the devil wants to distract you and this little deal let's refocus on the message that's right let's refocus on the message it really is not about the prophet well they're not wrong but they're not right because the prophet of God also shows us out of the scripture that Christ looks down in the very motive that's right of our heart that's right so what's their motive if you can get the prophet out we're much more acceptable we can go witness with the best of them of Miracles and signs and all these things just get a profit out of your sermon and the world will accept you it's happening yeah the military sanitizes their Public Communication we're going to to just be doing a little operation killing a few people blowing up a few things they sanitize it that it sounds like they're doing a Boy Scout job in the neighborhood Satan wants to sanitize this message so that it is like we're just while he's out killing destroying pillaging plundering Souls see trying to refocus us it's a distraction we need the reminder we need the reminder same reminder Jesus gave them we need the reminder amen Can someone say we need the reminder amen stir up our pure hearts in remembrance amen now I love this verse 45 we're getting down to the end here then he opened then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scripture you know the world if they hear this tape tonight would think I was just some kind of arrogant kind of person but I tell you I rub shoulders with a lot of people and I'm getting older and Boulder it scares me I'm acting more like my dad that means I'm talking at the grocery store just checking out and I just ask people questions that probably polite people wouldn't ask them uh yeah what happened to your face oh all they have to do is say I'd rather not talk about it but what they do do is tell you I was in a car accident I almost died oh my did your church pray for you I don't go to church why not you see it's not the question it's how you presented that's right if you don't go to church you're going to hell at least that's what our church teaches no you tell them I wished I would have known of course I haven't been in alberon for a year but I would have prayed for you and they look at you like you would have yes I I would have you see because there's a deep longing in the hearts of men kind prophet of God talks about how it's not the alcohol the alcoh is their way of trying to deal with something else these things the dancing all these things that's just trying to deal with something else amen but we have an open book we have the word we have life my brother and sister I hope I'm not preaching too straight to you tonight but we opened our understanding Can someone say my understanding has been open amen I'm not boasting I'm not bragging I'm just acknowledging the truth that I can talk and look at the word and you realize those around you this might sound arrogant but those around you have a glossed over view of the Gospel you know when they said years ago that Mark 16 the latter portion was not inspired the world believes it but I'm sorry we met a word that was inspired and it said that he was our healer and he discerned the thoughts and intent of our hearts you're too late devil you're too late world to tell me God doesn't care enough about us to discern our heart and come and heal our bodies amen there's way too many healings I've experienced it myself Amen to sit here today and think oh I maybe God won't heal maybe that is maybe that no my brother and sister let's stand up and say My God Is A Healer I believe every drop of it and devil I don't care if this flesh never gets healed my God Is A Healer they'll say that's Insanity welcome see where we stand Jesus Christ once again is walking in our midst amen he's talking to us we're on our road to emus he's talking to us and he's speaking and he's opening the word and he's reminding us do you realize a lot of preaching of the Gospel is just really as simple as a reminder we read we hear and sometimes we just need to be reminded you know when I was a young man I lived kind of all over the place for a while there I didn't always hang out with the best of characters they say you want to go get a drink we'll get some beer go to the lake you see they would have thought I was crazy but when they would say that a little recorder kicked on started playing otherwise this flesh would have went with them yes and when you get in positions I wouldn't never share that in church I haven't even really shared it too much to the whole world maybe one of these days I will the right place right time to see the major disaster That You Don't See coming and God closes the gate puts the chain around it puts the padle loock on it and says no right yeah I'll give you just a little hint I was offered a job many years ago as a Young Man pretty aggressive in that stage of my life to become a job superintendent the job was to take place in the Grand Canyon and it paid incredibly well and would open a door to this massive construction company that uh did a lot of government work everything about it looked like that's the future that's wonderful except for I couldn't get the gate open and I look back now and say thank you Lord amen thank you Lord that you put a big enough lock and a big enough chain that I could not get through that because it would have been such a mar in my life amen what has happened he's come we can use this in both ways would be correct we can say he has opened up our understanding that would be correct right yes sir the words or the way I prefer he is opening up our understanding it didn't just open for moment that's right and then that was like you know oh that's finished ongoing he's still walking with us he's still telling us why he came and the reasons and all of the things that happened and I don't know about you that there's things in my life that that I don't understand why they happened but they're decreasing in numbers because as I go further down this road I seeing more and more of why God closes that door close that door close that door Hallelujah I I don't want to drag this out tonight we're just almost done so if musician sister via if you would come amen musicians amen so look what he did is he opened his word to remind us once again do we need that I say I need it amen he's opened our understanding and I'll tell you what we need to understand the word for our hour you see it's not just about brother brandham or God sent a prophet and so many focus on that it's got to be about the prophet no my brother and sister it's about the word being open to you and I and if the word's not open to you and I none of the rest of this is going to matter we might as well go be a whatever and it's there but God said no you're mine you're mine can I say it again you're mine I'll prove it to you you're mine but I've got problems you're mine I failed you you're mine let me deviate just a second this really struck me listening so here's Samson this portion of all of this is so incredible when you read it how brother brandham ties it back in and that's why I encourage you to listen to this sermon but here's Samson my brother and sister he flirted with Delilah she's the world do you love me where's your strength it's what I was going thought I was preaching on tonight where's your strength well I know what the word says but you know it's here Samson the Philistines come bounds up breaks everything I thought you said you love [Music] me again and again brother Brown ties it right in beautiful through the church age coming right up and ties it in beautiful but you know what happened was in Delilah's final seduction in other words uh uh Samson played around to the point that he really poured his heart out and Delilah took his heart and rung it and rendered it as though it was nothing left him empty and sightless for a little gold and if you don't think the world won't trade you and I for a little gold then we've got a lot to learn but I love this what brother Brandon broke down while Samson was in prison no peir but the Nazarite vow was still upon him and while he's in prison and they're rejoicing in their conquering of this soul I love how it comes out on the tape a little hair popped out and God honored that little bit of Faith oh doesn't that make your heart so soft oh we think if I had more faith if I had more faith just have God's faith amen we don't need to measure Faith by how we measure Faith let it be measured by God's measure and in that time of repentance that little hair bound out and God said there's The Vow coming back once again because if he hadn't knocked down the palace if he has his life had not been taken from him he would have never voluntarily let them cut his hair again because he had revelation of what it was in the beginning can you see it can you see it I needed to be this and God says you just need to start right here amen I knew this but I still did it just start right here just come back to the point you can say Lord I accept it I am yours oh hallelujah amen I'll tell you what my brother and sister we talked how many times we've heard ourselves saying if I just had more faith well I tell you what why don't we just acknowledge of faith that God has given us that Faith he's given us is sufficient amen it's sufficient my brother and sister take the shackles off of it hallelujah look how close we're coming to the end you know when we were on that tour in Israel remember we were up there where all of those uh hole in the mountain they had the stone troughs for the horses and that armag again I couldn't remember if that was exactly the name but MTO there that's what I was in my mind fishing for but right there in the valley right below it's scriptural it's where armageddon's going to take place now my brother and sister we could sit on that rock on those on those artifacts till we were old and gray and fell over and Armageddon might not come it might be just a day beyond our life we could look for proof that armageddon's going to take place but I'm here today to offer you sufficient truth that we weren't called to witness Armageddon we're not called to be there when we see the valley full of blood the blood that matters to us has already come it's already on us amen don't let it be washed away don't let it be taken away receive it act on it amen because my brother and sister our Lord Jesus Christ is alive in his word let the word flow let the word be real let the word be life Hallelujah you love the Lord tonight Hallelujah amen let's just stand sing a song or two if you don't mind would
