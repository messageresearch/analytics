lord why don't we stand tonight open your bibles to john chapter one amen john chapter one verse one sorry one second amen in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning the same was in the beginning with god all things were might made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not are you thankful that you comprehended the light amen there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to bear a witness of that light you bear witness of the light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world every man is given the opportunity to accept the life of christ he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god you have the power what better person to give you power than jesus christ even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word and be seated tonight you know if you don't mind i'm actually going to put this back on it's kind of chilly up here i've been cold all day i don't know why okay praise the lord if i can't stay loose enough i'll have to take it off so tonight i'm going to speak on the book of acts part 3. um we did part 1 and part 2 some time back i don't expect you to remember that so i have to take my word for it but uh with part 1 we spoke about the ethiopian that philip ran after and we talked about how that um that is the way that god is is with us god goes after us um and uh then this part two we spoke of unmerited forgiveness now there's a lot of um archived sermons on the book of acts from different different churches um i my desire is that we look at the book of acts as more of a remembrance to show us and to to expound to us what god expects of us and the potential we have as sons and daughters of god put you in remembrance of those things as the scriptures say so our title tonight is damascus damascus road i knew i was going to have time have a hard time saying that but that was my title see look i'm already warmed up praise god so damascus road i read here in john that that jesus christ is the light and the light is the the light the light is the life of christ your bible should have it capitalize capital l because it's speaking of christ brother branham in this quote and this quote may seem a little bit um off with my title but we're going to lay a little bit of a groundwork and you just hang on for the ride and we'll trust god to pick up the rest praise the lord i have the beginning i don't know what the end is going to be but we're trusting in him 1965 god's chosen place of worship but the bible says he says notice all seven jewish feasts was kept in the same place they never kept one feast here for the methodist and one over here for the baptist one over there for the presbyterian one back here for the catholic and one for the protestant all seven feasts was kept in the same place it's a very beautiful type here we've just went through the seven church ages going to show that god keep all seven church ages and the youth group is going through the church age book right now we just read chapter one i also just want to thank the lord that they all got in to camp for those you didn't know the camp open registration opened at one o'clock and it was 16 people too many by 1 15. so we went really fast and brother ron there was 16 people too many in and so they had some people that had to refund but um brother on expected to take two days and it took 15 minutes to fill up so not to say that be selfish and say we want our kids over some other kids but we just want god's perfect will and that was his perfect will so be in prayer for that coming up in june anyways praise the lord back to this here this quote so he says it's a very beautiful type here we've just went through the seven church ages going to show that god keep all seven church ages in the word for each each church age produced a part of the word and whenever they produced it and and they saw the light so whenever they produced it that part of the word is because they saw that light shed on the gospel of christ he says just like the people who first discovered to baptize in jesus name what did they do they made a denomination out of it and it died right there so light came and shed truth to a portion of the scripture the sergeant god bless you this year uh brought a special a portion of truth to that aid they took that truth and they lived in the light of christ for a season but then they mixed their ideas with it and denominated and so god moved forward so he says they made a denomination out of it and it died right there then god moved right out into somebody else he will not stay in one of those creeds and dogmas he has nothing to do with it there is nothing perverted about god in other words denominations are perverted god's word is wholly unadulterated you can't have a denomination and not have adultery because adultery of the word of god is when you mix god's word partial truth with par with lies with ideas you came up with that sound good you mix that together you have committed adultery spiritually christ is god's center spot of worship i have that underlined and didn't get it transferred over god christ is god's center spot of worship he is god christ is the mystery of god revealed um and you are christ revealed to this generation all seven feasts must be kept in this one place you couldn't keep the feast in any other place it wouldn't work you can go do it if you want to but ain't gonna do nothing for you as a jew you couldn't go in and they couldn't go in and sacrifice them when the temple was set up in jerusalem they couldn't go sacrifice often somewhere else it had to be there at the temple that was where god said it that was where god's place was and it wouldn't work otherwise so they can do it they can make it look just like the real thing but they're not in the right spot they're not in in in those days it was a physical location in these days it's a it's it's a spiritual revelation of god's word and then you have to be right in line with christ to be in god's chosen place of worship so he says you couldn't keep the feast in the other place but them seven the seven feasts of the year must be kept in one place therefore the seven church ages had to come from the one single place that was christ speaking in all seven church ages that's where the message came from for each age it came from christ it didn't come from john wesley john wesley john wesley was a minister in the anglican church a dead church a dead idea man's idea denomination but god brought him god brought him the light we're gonna get to damascus road god brought him the light and moved him from what he thought was truth to what really was truth and that is god's provided place of worship he was in a place of worship but he wasn't in the one that god designated so okay okay praise the lord therefore the seven churches had to come from the one single place that was christ speaking in all seven church ages that's exactly right type of the seven church ages but they made denominations out of it this is a bit of a long quote but it lays a good foundation so bear with me now let's look at another type while we're along here that's the type of the passover foreshadowed jesus knee notice here the sacrifice of blood by death the sacrifice of blood was the place that foreshadowed christ can a denomination bleed could you think of a church bleeding a denominational bleeding certainly not it taken blood to bleed from a life i like how he says that you know because denomination can't bleed and we understand that but then he says it takes to bleed from a life in other words there ain't no life in the denomination and the life here jesus comes in view by the lamb the lamb was a type of christ and foreshadowed christ because he was the lamb of god that john introduced back to john here introducing christ the lamb of god the light the life of men for men um he says that takes away the sin of the world we find jesus coming into view here in exodus the 12th chapter speaking of the lamp the blood on the doorpost notice it was the only place death could not strike whoever had the blood on the doorposts it was the only place death could not strike when death was about to strike the land there had to be a certain place all from under this died only one place now it didn't mean it was one house they somebody could have said hey they've got blood on the doorposts and they could have went out and killed the cow and put blood on their door force posts but it would have done nothing to save them because that's not god's provided way it was the blood of a lamb because it had to type the blood of jesus christ so you see how they can do it and you maybe not even know i don't know can you tell the difference between blood's lamb lamb's blood and a cow's blood if it's on the wall no it looks the same but it's not it's totally different he says uh only one place now it didn't mean it was one house it's not one location it's not jeffersonville it's not kenai alaska it's it's underneath the blood of christ which you can't be under the blood of christ without a revelation of christ revelation goes hand in hand they had to have a revelation that killing that lamb would save them otherwise when that death angel come floating by they would have ran ran out and tried to run away from it but they had a revelation that that blood on the doorpost would protect them because they believed their message they had faith in revelation in god but there was one place that's where the lamb was killed where the lamb's blood was the death angel could not strike because it was the one place god had put his name and that lamb was named back there in the beginning a lamb notice it was the one place he could not strike he couldn't it's impossible now the same is today there is only one place that spiritual death cannot strike that's the word not the bible the bible is a book containing the words of god there's lots of people whose houses have the bible and that does nothing for them there's lots of churches who preach from the bible but there is no life but it takes revelation of christ in a revelation of the word um and that's where death cannot strike spiritual death cannot strike he says death can't strike the word because it's the living word of god because god's word alive is eternal meaning death can't touch it that's eternal cannot end never started cannot end death is an ending like a period at the end of a sentence that's what death is so death can't touch eternal the death can't touch anything associated with christ because it's eternal oh sure your flesh might pass away and will bury it but your spirit the one that god has had that lives on forever or eternity because your flesh had a beginning but when you put he says but when you put creeds with it the word moves out to itself it'll separate like water from oil you cannot mix it together therefore you see when the creed comes into a denomination they all go after the creed and the word dies out and goes on with somebody else and increases it more picks up the momentum as it goes go as it go from justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and on out into the grain so it picks up momentum why to a final crescendo and the age that we're living in it all comes together he says do you see the path god has trod bringing his name all the time right down the same way because he is the word notice it can't die the word of life can't die notice how perfect now the death angel was not forbidden to strike egypt's great intellectual people it wasn't forbidden to strike its sacred lands its great buildings its pharaohs on the priests of the land the angel was not forbidden to strike it could strike any building in any place anybody but it could not strike where the blam was it wasn't the type of building it wasn't necessarily who they were they had revelation because of who they were but they couldn't survive just because they were in israelite because i'm sure there were some that didn't put the blood on the doorposts and they died so he says um death cannot okay but it could not strike where the land was death cannot strike where this provided place of god is and that is in the lamb notice not even was the he forbidden to strike israel on its hebrew priests whoa coming in a little closer to home or any of their denominations all must be in god's chosen provided place or death struck i don't care how holy that hebrew priest was if his the let the blood wasn't on the doorpost it did nothing for him because there's no big eyes or little hues church wherever you are what you belong to makes me no different but there's one thing you must know you've got to be in christ or you're dead you can't live outside of him your church might be all right as a building your fellowship might be all right as man but when you deny the body of the blood the word of jesus christ you're dead the minute you do it it's god's chosen place of worship there is where his name is exactly there is where he chose to put his name not in the church but in the son jesus christ now i want to back back up here he says but when you deny the body the blood the word of jesus christ you're dead the minute you do it i know it sounds silly but there is no life in death churches that have stepped beyond the word of god and have chosen their own way to conduct things cannot reproduce the life of christ they might have people in their church that are good at acting but there's no changing power there's no sustaining power people that people it's it's it's human nature in in older folks to to be not happy with change so you see some churches some message churches there's no young people there people grow up and they leave nothing against the older folks in our church but what i'm trying to say is is you need the life of christ you need that sustaining power you need something to hold you and you can't get that when you mix your idea with god's word i feel like i i believe tonight you have your spiritual thinking cap on and you're catching what i'm saying without having to blatantly say it and i feel bad sometimes that it keeps coming back up but i thought tonight and perhaps it was the lord speaking to my heart but this is as a minister you you god lays things on your heart that deals with the time at hand you can go from church to church and and preachers that are called of god dedicated to god to the service of god are preaching the same thing because it's the season that the bride is in and i believe the season that we are in right now is the fruition of these fruits and the bible says it could deceive the very elect if it was possible so what do we do what does god do we don't come here and i don't try to say you know facts and i'll try to prove anything to you because that ain't going to do nothing for you what it is is god comes along and when the enemy raises up a flood raises up the flood god comes in and raises up the standard to meet that and god's word will defeat the devil every single time we're going to get to a quote here tonight where brother battle says that to accept god is against human nature it's against human nature to accept god so you didn't accept god god chose you so if you know somebody or you have family who are caught up in this movement that we see in the day and age that we live in don't be afraid pray for them because god will choose them god will pull them out you can't argue with them and win amen you can't you you get you you you started you read the you know maybe there's a message preached at the church here and you're like man i got it and you just you invite notes down and then you go to talk to them and they just run circles around you because that's not what it is you can't explain revelation you can't argue revelation all you know it's like the story you know you tell you expect people to laugh and they know he says how well i guess you had to be there you had to be there and you were you know brother man goes on this thing he says i was there when paul revere ran rode this horse across shouting the british are coming i was there when in in in when they raised the flag over iwo jima i was there he says when when when christ put his arms across upon the cross and i'm i'm going off my own now those are those exact words i we were there when he stepped out of the tomb when that stone when the earth shook and that stone moved without hands amen i was there excuse me why because i was in the mind of christ not from the beginning because eternity doesn't have a beginning i was i am in the mind of christ for all when he was on the cross i am in his mind when he came out of the grave i am what was on his mind anyways i am anyways i am on his mind at no point in time was was i was on his mind or going to be on his mind i was always present tense on his mind and that's who we serve we serve a present tense god god is not the god of yesterday though he is the god of yesterday he is the god of today it doesn't matter if you were if you're in yesterday or you're in tomorrow he's the god of today praise the lord amen so wow i don't even know where i am right now um praise the lord the light the true revelation of god's word pro puts you in the right place to accept the life of christ the life is the light my original title was the light of the gospel and then i began to see this and i began to god began to deal with me just before i came out that's why i had my pen and i was writing right here because it kind of brought it all together on this little these notes i have here but it's the masks damascus road right praise the lord because they're talking about the book of acts a remembrance of this is who you are this this this book of acts we could write today it is being written today not on an actual page what has been written in life in testimonies if you gathered all the testimonies of every and from every church around the globe amen you could write a book of acts because why it's it's why is it a book of acts you say it's just testimonies and stuff it's another book of acts because it's christ acting out through you the the your bible might say your bible here might say the acts of the apostles that's not true it's the acts of christ in the apostles there's no way they could do it there's no way they could do this stuff or fulfill the word of god in their life like that without a revelation of the light of christ now so the light brought the true revelation to the people of god in each age praise the lord acts chapter 22. we're gonna move into the book of acts you say i thought you were preaching about acts well we are we are here never fear acts chapter 22. verse 1 men brethren and fathers hear ye my defense which i make now unto you and when they heard that he spake in the hebrew tongue to them they kept the more silence and he saith i am verily a man which am a jew born antarctis a city in cilicia yet brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers and was zealous towards god as ye all are this day and i persecuted this way unto the death you could capitalize the word way because what is he talking about the way of the christians delivering into prisons both men and women as also the high priest doth bear me witness and all the estate of the elders from who also i received letters unto the brethren and went to damascus to bring them which were there bound unto jerusalem for to be punished there that sets the stage for paul's story here we have paul now if we were to go back in the in acts chapter 5 and save your spot here in chapter 22 because we will come back acts chapter 5 verse 34 you can turn if you would like to verse 34 says then there stood up one in the council a pharisee named gamalio so gamalio was paul's teacher paul's mentor in the gospel in in the message moses's message now there's a type i don't have to you you can go back and you can read the book of exodus and you can view or excuse me read the the journey of the children of israel out of egypt under the ministry of moses into the ministry of joshua crossing over jordan there's so many types through there and and so you have the ministry of moses and that is what paul was raised up in paul understood the message of moses paul read it the scrolls he he had a revelation of the scrolls if you will but what happened was just like the denominations did the light of the word that moses brought denominated in the pharisees and the sadducees so now you had a religion that had no life in it whatsoever but you have wise men still in the midst and when you when you read in the scriptures about men like gamaliel i like to think later on down the line they caught a revelation of of the truth either that or they died underneath that other previous anointing but he says and hey so gamaliel stands up and now they have peter and i think i don't know who else with him but as peter they arrested them for preaching and they're they're standing before the the um the council and uh they they're taking counsel to slay these disciples and um so gamaliel stands up and he says hang on everybody listen up everyone listens because in that culture a man of a certain age was considered wise and when he spoke people would would listen to what he was saying so here gamaliel is going to say that hey i was talking see what he has to say this guy is is has a lot of wisdom 35 and said unto them ye men of israel take heed to yourselves what she intend to do as touching these men for before these days rose up theodos boasting himself to be somebody to whom a hundred of hundred of men about 400 excuse me to whom a number of men about 400 joined themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to naught after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the taxing and drew away much people after him he also perished and all even as many as obeyed him were dispersed now i say unto you refrain from these men and let them alone for if this council or this work be of men it will come to not but if it be of god you cannot overthrow it lest happily be found even to fight against god so this is the viewpoint this is the understanding that gamaliel has of these these jews who are preaching about jesus and him resurrected and um in in um i have written down acts chapter 8 verse 1 and saul was consenting unto his death considering unto the death of stephen um and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judea and samaria except the apostles and devout men carried stephen to his burial and made great lamentation over him as for saul he made havoc of the church entering into every house and hailing men and women committing women committed them to prison therefore they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word so that's what happens when the bride comes underneath the persecution they disperse but all it did was cause a greater spread of the gospel of christ so here we have uh we have gamalium he says look don't fight against these men in other words don't take them prisoner don't put them in prison don't hurt them don't harm them don't do anything to them because if they're of god you'll be found fighting against god if they're not of god don't worry about it it's going to fall apart because it's a man idea so he had an understanding that what is of god bears life but what is not of god has no life in it and will come to death so this is gamaliel who paul was raised up through up underneath from the time he was a young boy so there came at some point in time in between this that around this time where gamaliel stands up and and he got the apostles preaching in the streets and you have stephen and being stoned and now you see paul in the mix consenting to the death of stephen there had to be a confrontation between him and gamalio the words of wisdom from gamaliel saying hey listen paul listen you need it you need to leave these people alone excuse me don't mess with it paul this is a what do you know gamaliel i know the scripture's just good as you do i've read it you've raised me up you've taught it well guess what this is a new time this is a new age you're stuck in the old thing you're old you don't understand what's going on you you don't you don't get it uh we can we can't let these we can't stand by and get these for the passion of youth we can't stand by and let these people ruin the temple you want them to take the temple from you the temple is everything that we believe in paul paul no no you don't understand you got to leave this sloan it could be of god and paul said no i storms out i am not going to listen to any more you have to say slams the door here you have paul he perhaps within him is an expression of of anger right he he he's upset he's angry at these christians why because there was a spirit contrary to him to his and he was he had to fight against it he was trying to silence the voice within him there was a voice in him saying paul these people have something you don't have how do they how do they stand there and face you and you put chains on them and you sit in the prison and maybe they're killed how do they stand and face that paul yet yet yet you're you you know you oh and he's got to silence the voice that's what they're trying to do in the time that we live in they're trying to silence the voice because what they heard it and they can't get away from it so it angers him these people who who do they think they are he's upset he's he he he's um loud and he and he's and he's and he's just you know plotting and and to to make these people's life miserable all the while though thinking he's fighting on the right side you have to understand that he thought he was doing the right thing he was doing it all in the name of the message moses moses message he was doing it all and he had he had instructions from the preachers and the pastors the pharisees the priests he had instructions from the high priest right there was still um there was an organization of man one man is the top of the food chain he had instructions from him and he he he he's going out and he's taking what did these people do to him they didn't do anything to him they have done nothing to him they have never even said you know tried to try to to take and go and pillage the temple or anything they left him alone you say why can't they just leave us alone because it's the life of christ in you angers them it angers them so here's paul thinking he's doing the right thing fighting on the side of god or so he thinks and so he gets papers he's all right there they're going to run excuse me that's fine i'll get permission to run after them and i'm going to deal with them i'm going to stop this gamalio okay paul you're going to do this you know what can i do i pray that god helps you this isn't the way we're to handle situations like this paul saul excuse me perhaps there was a a scenario where where uh saul speaking to gamaliel hey i i'm i got these you know because he's still looking for his approval he's his mentor he wants to see that approval in gamaliel so he tells gamalia look i i i have i've got them i i i've put almost every single one in jerusalem in prison and now i'm going to damascus and gamaliel in wisdom and i believe maybe anointed of god looks at paul saul in the eyes and says then you'll be happy so here's here is saul and he's going to damascus and i'm going to take the liberty to paint this picture he's got these words going over in his head and he's thinking why am i not happy i'm doing the work of god i'm dealing with these men with these women and chill with these men and women why am i not happy oh i get to damascus i'll i'll get all of them there and then i'll be happy and the voice doesn't says in in his heart but they're gone other places and you know it amen how are you going to go to the next town in the next town in the next town where does revenge end paul where does it end i'll tell you where it ends it ends in death is what it does and here's paul in his turmoil see what god does now you you take you take stories and and and events from the scriptures that you read them and if we're not careful we forget to put heart into them it's just it's just it's just an event but you got to see god doesn't just god didn't just come out of the blue to paul paul had to be in the right frame of mind paul had to be in the right spirit the bible says god loveth a broken and a contrite spirit god doesn't come to somebody when they're high on life he breaks them down to a place where all they can do is look up he he he prepares the soil for the receiving of the seed if the ground is hard you're nothing you can do the plow has got to come through and break it up god came through at your life and your conversion and he broke up your life you got to a place where you you there was nothing you could do and you and right and god came down on the scene now here's paul now this is this is i it's reading between the lines paul was in a broken position in his heart now he was tough on the outside and he had his soldiers with him he was a man capturing innocent women funny what the world calls a man and here he is on the road thinking why am i not happy well what do these people have they believe in this this jesus supposed to raise from the dead how does that even make sense he was a bastard child that's what he's you know perhaps he's thinking this stuff on there you know you're on a long road your mind just he didn't have the cd player turn on some tunes you know horses didn't come with those back then and so and so he he he's riding along and he's thinking over his life and he's thinking over everything that he has gone through and and the words of gamaliel coming to his mind and the words because he knew i'm sorry excuse me he knew the scrolls he knew what isaiah said he knew this stuff and so he's perhaps he's thinking over these things on damascus road and perhaps when he was at his lowest verse six and it came to pass that as i made my journey and it was come nigh unto damascus about noon suddenly they're shown from heaven a great light round about me and i fell unto the ground and heard a voice saying unto me saul saul why persecutest thou me he say oh you can't be you can't say that that that that your your jesus christ to this world did he persecute jesus the the man that was no the men and women who believed on him and he's here here jesus says wiper to execute his thou me and i answered who art thou lord capital l he knew [Laughter] he knew in his heart lord jehovah god the great creator who art thou lord he probably could have answered it but he asks and i am and he said unto me i am jesus of nazareth whom now persecute us right there for the sake of paul's hurting soul hurting heart god says he says i identify paul saul identifies him as lord and then he says i am jesus and he tied the two together and now saul realizes that that jesus of nazareth is the same one he is professing to be serving and now he's been found fighting against god and the words of gamalia come back to his mind don't fight against unless you be finding yourself fighting against god and paul saul knew there that he had lost the battle and they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me and i said what shall i do lord and the lord said unto me arise and go into damascus and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do and when i could not see for the glory of the light being led by the hand of them that were with me i came into damascus and one ananias a devout man according to the law when you see the light it blinds you to everything else the world has to offer and then god gives you new eyes to see and i came into damascus and one ananias a devout man according to the law having a good report of all the jews which dwelt there came unto me and stood and said unto me brother saul received thy sight and the same hour i looked up upon him and he said the god of our fathers hath chosen thee that thou should know his will and see that just one here is paul now god has so many names he's the savior he's the healer healer he's jehovah he's the lord jesus christ he has all these names but what is the one that ananias underneath the anointing of the holy spirit chooses to use he calls him the just one why because paul is sitting there in his blindness waiting for ananias to come realizing he has been hurting and persecuting the very people of god you think that wouldn't affect you you remember you're remembering those those precious saintly women you slapped in the face you remember those those those godly men who stood there who were broadly enough to take you and choke you out and they stood there as you put the cuffs on them to drag them off to prison you're looking into the eyes of jesus christ in your mind realizing what you've done ananias comes the prophet and anoints him and he his eyes are open and he says he calls christ to paul the just one in other words god is a fair judge god is a judge yes but god has grace and he is just in his judgment stephen cried out as he was dying laying out this charge to their hands that was for paul that was for the sake of paul otherwise paul would have had stephen's blood on his hands he says and see that just one and should has hear the voice of his mouth for thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou has seen and heard and now why terrorists thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the lord praise the lord amen saul converting to paul he saw the light on damascus road i'm sorry i should have picked a different word he saw the light on the road to the masses we're going to say that he saw the light and he heard the voice there's two scriptures in the bible and but brother brown has even asked the question you know why is it saying one place they saw the light and heard no voice in a place that says they heard a voice and saw no man and he said i don't know the answer to that question and i'm not going to try to explain it until god reveals it to me that was in 64. so either way you have to see the light and hear the voice you can't do one without the other because they saw they saw the the pharisees saw jesus who was the light they didn't catch anything they heard him speak but they didn't hear the voice you have these men with paul maybe some saw the light maybe some didn't some heard the voice some didn't but you don't hear about their conversion you have to see the light and hear the voice and you have to hear the voice and see the light you can hear the voice if if the voice of brother branham who is the voice for the voice capital v saved you there would be no reason for the bible or the holy spirit but that's not what it is it's the voice within the voice it's it's it's the truth it's the light the life of christ it's christ to us it and it's the same thing as it was then one um there was there was the the the jews fighting against the jews you had the jews of the pharisees and the sadducees and you had the christian jews at that point they're all jews they're all in the same church basically if you will yet you have saul of paul who was fighting against his own brethren same religion different revelation one was true one was false amen it's j it's the false vine versus the true vine it's the same thing it's a twins going on down it's all the way through but um we're talking about the light and the life that christ gives to you when you hear and have revelation and that causes you to see the light um saul knew he was right he had the quotes for it a service for them was the priest reading the scrolls of the words of moses it's the same spirit in every age praise the lord finding myself in my notes because i got ahead of it of them many are hearing the message but do not see the light you've got to hear the message and see the light of christ within it that's revelation john saw the light and heard the voice when he baptized jesus um in acts chapter 19 verse one through six paul goes to ephesus and it says and he says the bible says here and it came to pass that while apollos was at corinth paul having passed through the upper coasts came to ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the holy ghost since you believed and they said unto him we have excuse me we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized and they said unto john's baptism then said paul john barely baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied matthew 5 14 says ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid these ephesus believers were apostles of john's message they only had half of the ingredients john was the forerunner for christ these disciples at ephesus could have turned paul down i said no and wait this is what john said but then he says john came to bring you christ to forerun and call out your attention to christ to what the light paul had to go down the road to damascus for god to bring him to the light he knew the scrolls he knew what it was said but god had to bring him to the light you had to hear the light see the light and hear the voice and paul went to out in the arabian desert for three and a half years what was he doing he took the scrolls with him but now with the revelation he went back through them and he found christ in every last line the same is for you when you see christ in the message you've heard the voice but when you see the light you can't you can't turn back you're blinded to the rest of what the world has to offer now you just see christ you go back through it you go back through the voice through the message you read and all you see is christ all the way through and you can't contradict any scripture in the bible once you've seen the light and heard the voice once you've seen the light of truth now you are a light to this generation it takes the whole world to bring about christ in your life your damascus road brought you to christ god puts you in the right position he says you know what this is my child so i'm going to give them what they need to catch a revelation of the word but guess what sometimes amen this this could go for for for the young people raised in the message you heard the voice but you need to come into contact with the light you need to come into contact with the light jesus christ that's the whole point that's what the voice is pointing you to is to jesus christ it's not about the messenger it's about the message that come straight from christ praise the lord now it took a light bearer paul to bring them the whole truth these believers in ephesus then they received christ because they had the whole truth it's either all word or none at all when you mix it there's no word the pharisees praise the lord it takes seeing the light to hear the voice within the voice i think i said that already it takes hearing the voice to understand the light john 14 6 says jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me here's that quote for the brand of 1956 he says yes sir it's a work of god you never chose god and never did seek god god seeks you it's against human nature you weren't seeking the lord on your road to damascus paul wasn't seeking the lord on the road to damascus he was seeking other jews to take and capture this is the book of acts it was written again this is you have a testimony similar to paul's you came into contact with the light sometimes we have to be reminded of where we came from reminded of of of what we what we went through we get so bogged down with life sometimes and and and and and with the things of the world and we get so bogged down with what people have to say about what we believe that we forget about the light that's the whole thing that's the whole shebang as i say it's all all about christ and and the light that he brings to your life then you see clearly now what he who he is in the word which then tells you who you are praise the lord amen sister amy and sean you all want to come up here so following after jesus christ was contrary to everything paul knew and believed but when you come into contact with the light the light of the gospel you're able to go against your human nature which wants to turn down god because christ gives you a revelation of what is reality that's the big question these days what's reality we have virtual reality what is reality what is truth you know is this a good source of truth you know let's fact check this truth with the with this and that and the other and if you're not careful you get into this place where where um lord help me tie this up tonight and forgive me if if if i'm not making sense i i i apologize i pray that god will tie this down together if if you're not careful you get caught up in in in the words on the page and and you want to try to you want to try to defend it you want to try to use it to prove your point you want to try to use it to convince somebody of something but since you like paul met the light on the road to damascus you are a light bearer [Music] our prayer should be lord don't help me learn the message help me to become the message [Music] don't don't compile quotes together in a notebook to take and argue your point it won't work instead say god i have nothing to hold against this help me shed the light of christ i'm trusting that tonight that god knows your heart and god knows what you're dealing with i don't know what you're dealing with but god knows the very inner heart and i know that that i do know that this is a big thing right now and and and so i'm trusting sometimes as a preacher you don't know you think how can that how can that apply to the congregation because you think you know people but you don't but jesus christ knows your heart and tonight what he's telling you what he's telling me is stop getting caught up in the argument of whether this is right or that is right and focus on the light because that's what it's all about give out the light you have been given the greatest gift on this earth you have been given a revelation of christ now if you could see it in the spiritual world go ahead close your eyes for a second and try to imagine this with me you could look into the spiritual world all you see is is it's just it's darkness around us it's darkness now in this darkness there's pits there's trees there's there's trip falls there's traps everywhere you look when you turn there's light and you can see it because you're a light bearer now what makes people scared of you sometimes what makes people upset with you sometimes is when you shine that light on them they don't like it if it you can open your eyes if you want if if if you want if you want to do the best thing that you can do is shine your light into their dark world and pray to god that they comprehend it pray to god that that you can be a a moment of truth for them that doesn't mean you have to pull your bible out you don't have to pull out the quotes now there's there's praise the lord there's people who don't realize god is faithful and god has grace and they will come to that place where they catch revelation but there's people who are following a certain idea of the message who don't realize the error of their ways if you come at them with quotes you're no different than the people who are preaching to them in their church but if you come after him with the love of christ which is the light of christ true love not some perverted thing but the man said compassion with jesus braiding the whip and beating the money changers out of the temple don't break a whip and go beat them that's not what i'm saying stand in confidence they might call it arrogance but standing confidence on the truth and show them the life of christ i was in conversation with someone the other day we were talking about somebody who is very much against the message [Music] and i said you know they they told me and my wife they appreciated that we show them love still they don't they don't now now i have to be careful how to say this because you don't want to you don't want it to be like oh we thank you for accepting us in that your life doesn't convict them you want that to always be the case [Music] they know i don't agree with them and we've had words kind words but i spoke straight i spoke the truth but yet they see in their the desire we have to just show them the love of christ now let me ask you a question in their time of need are they going to go to the person who's ours be always arguing with them or they're going to go to the person who's shown them christ there's going to come a day when people are going to start reaching out to you because they know you have the truth amen will you be the one to be their light bearer there's a song that says you know i may have conversation with you and talk with you but when we go away will you love jesus more or did i get in the way when you meet somebody you witness somebody you talk to somebody when you go away will they know jesus more were they where they have have have been introduced to christ or will they just see you amen we pray that that that god will use us to be the light bearers the masses road god came on your road to damascus and shone gave you the light and gave you revelation and then he sent you to ephesus to be a light bearer of the truth praise the lord let's bow our heads tonight lord jesus thank you for your word lord lord that's my heart's desire tonight is to be a light bearer before you can be a light bearer you've got to go down damascus road but lord once we go through that come out the other side then we can begin to spread the truth to the world around us and oh lord what a time truth is needed there's people who have come to come to the acceptance that there's just nothing true about anything it's everybody's opinion that's the mainstream thought everyone just has an opinion there's no truth the lord that's not the case and father we don't want to tote around our books and just try to argue a point at that point we'd be no different than jehovah's witness or mormons but father we want to spread the life of christ whether that be in a uh buying a meal or buying a cup of coffee or or just giving a word of encouragement to somebody we don't know or or when or when someone would come and they want to argue with us about the prophet we just have a we just have an attentiveness to the still small voice and instead of saying what we really want to say we conduct and say what you would want us to say father that's the direction we are going as the bride of christ because we are becoming more and more like you lord jesus i don't know lord i don't know people's hearts i don't know what people are going through father but i believe this is what you laid on my heart lord forgive me for the times i got in the way tonight i never ever want to mix my ideas or my opinions with your word i just wanted to be all you [Music] father i trusted lord you spoke what they heard was from you not me lording encourage the heart of your believers give us bring us to the next level bring us to a higher plane let's not play church lord let's not get bogged down with life and with our job because we have to do this and we have to do that father but lord come and and just lift us up to a higher plane inspire us give us a renewing lord another fire lord we ask we love you lord jesus commend ourselves in your hands and now in jesus name we pray amen [Music] what are you playing there
