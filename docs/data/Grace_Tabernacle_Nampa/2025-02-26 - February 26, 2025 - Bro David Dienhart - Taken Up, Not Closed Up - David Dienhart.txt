we thank the Lord he's given us this opportunity to be in his presence and to come together to rejoice in his presence and to feed upon the word that he has given to us and will give to us tonight what he laid in my heart praying that that is knowing that that would be what we should have this evening so let's bow our heads for prayer our heavenly father to you we look to Lord you are our joy our happiness you are our strength you are our Salvation Lord there's nothing we can do or could have done or will do to Merit salvation to earn it there's nothing we can do we can't be good enough we can't we can do nothing Lord you said there's none good save one that's Christ even Jesus told the Rich Young Ruler when he said good Master he said why callest thou me good there's none good but that's God and Lord You're present with us and you brought us to this point tonight and you've led us here and you called us by your grace we didn't do anything to Merit that call and we can do nothing as I said nothing in ourselves nothing to earn salvation to have salvation it's a free gift it's a gift of God we rejoice in that father giving that to us bless your word now as we speak anoint this speaker Lord that you'd move me aside and anoint the hearers to hear the word we ask this Lord As We Go From Here let us be raised to a higher plane because of your speaking to our hearts in Jesus Christ's name we pray for without you we can do nothing and we give you praise for it now because we surrender ourselves to you and for your glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen if you'd turn with me in your Bibles to First John 10 we'll get right into the word I want to um well I'll give you that title in just a moment 1 John 10:27 starting with verse 27 I'm sorry St John I'm sorry yeah I wrote that down wrong sorry it's not first John I knew that don't know why I wrote it that way okay St John 1027 my sheep let's just start with verse 26 now this is to unbelievers said but but you believe not because you are not of my sheep as I said unto you let me just back up to verse 25 so we're not just left hanging there Jesus answered them said I told you and you believe not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me but you believe not because you are not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice now that word hear is to receive my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me now in the in a verse in that same chapter he said in verse five and a stranger will they not follow but they'll flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers there's nothing there's only something in you that will receive the voice of God and will not receive the voice of a stranger no matter how close it is to the voice of God Amen isn't that wonderful see you never put that there God did and so but my sheep hear my voice and they follow me and I give a watch I give unto them eternal life who is he giving that to is sheep so he did nothing to earn this you did nothing to Merit it he said I give it to them that have that ear to hear the Bible said he that hath an ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit saith to the churches that right after every Church age he that hath an ear he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith so my sheep hear my voice and he said I know them when did he know us the Bible said he knew us before the world began so I know them and the only way we could know him was that he knew us if he didn't know us and he didn't plant that seed of himself in us we couldn't know him no matter how good we would be no matter how good works we would have how emotional we would have how much we'd shout or dance or even cast out Devils you can do that by the spirit of God and still not know him right amen because many of them will come and say to have not I cast out devils in your name and preached in your name and but he said I Know Thee not depart from me you worker of iniquity all right so verse 28 and I give unto them eternal life them my sheep and they shall never watch this they shall they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand what a consolation amen all right then I'd like you to go with me to St John 157 or excuse me 1527 use this scripture a little bit here in last few times but we'll use scriptures a lot it it's not so much how much we read the scriptures it just keeps unveiling itself these things excuse me verse 26 starting but when the comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and you also shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning amen and Luke 12 Luke 1232 fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom so fear not little flock it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom all right you may be seated I want to title this and it's a bit of a strange title but my actually my subtitle tonight would would actually be the subject for tonight more but I want to title this because I want to continue if the Lord is willing with that title on Sunday and let me read the quote that I brought this from this this is found in in uh Christ is the mystery of God revealed and the prophet says and his church stands alone she is not hooked with nothing but he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing so if he was identified how he was identified by God being the body and we are the body and then we're identified as his body we must have the same Spirit doing the same same thing she is his body the manifested truth what is his body she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days and she and she alone stands by it she and she alone stands by it what makes what would make her so different there's all kinds of good people but we're not talking about good people or bad people tonight because you can you can be good and then you can turn around and not be so good right but none of us I think in here want to do wrong or or do anything to grieve the holy spirit so that's not our desire but whether we make mistakes or fail in these things do things that are not good how many's done things is not good certainly all of us have even as Believers filled with the Holy Ghost we do things not good amen but see none of that counts what counts is that you could hear his voice calling you to the Rapture calling you to the feast calling you to the word for the season and you're able to receive it that's the difference that's a life and and I just I picked something up on this morning this evening but get Quicken to me but that's the life that's worthy of the Gospel amen there's only one life and that's him amen so it's him you revealed in you it's no more you living it's him amen and so fear not little flock it's your father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom so back to this quote here he says and she and she alone stands by it that's why the devil's howling see see backing up here she is his body the manifested truth so see he's come down manifesting himself he himself it's not another he himself manifesting himself in the formation of his bride amen and because she is his body she has his spirit that's why the devil's howling these great organizations and if I have time and we if we can if I don't know if I have time but some things I'd like to take out of the church age book here tonight but you know good and well that those great organizations are setting up something to close her up and it's happening brother sister we may not think it but look at since this presidents come in look at look at the look at the Spirit he's anointed under to move things I'll take this and do this and move this around and change this and it's all it's motivation bringing that church that you know why because it's the it's the it's the church it's the carnal Church the the the conf the in the the Council of churches the the church the denominations that are behind him becoming politically strong that's exactly what's happening and we're living in a tremendous time because I'll tell you right now we could go any moment it's just that close and the bride's coming to a full maturity even Friday there's seven stars lining up and I'm not prophesying what that means but seven is completion and if we had five stars lined up in 1962 at the end of 62 and the prophet said the astronomic of Heaven is announcing her approach as the infant bride coming forth what will it be when she matures now manifest here on the earth who is she she's him just in another form so see he's here and I pray that all of us could become that God conscious in everything we do to know that he's here he's with us he never leaves us he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you but be with you to the End Amen oh there was some people switched over here so I'm sorry I I thought they were on this side well you all hear me anyway all right so thank the Lord for that so we going on with this he said now that's why the devil's howling these great organizations to set up something to close her up now watch what he says they'll never do it they'll never do it she'll be taken up not closed up I want to take my title this morning this evening taken up not closed up taken up not closed up now we're at the end we know we're at the end we're at the end the prophet said we've arrived we're at the end how long he says I don't know but we've arrived at the end there going be no more Church ages we've come to that place where the bride maturing under this opened word because that's who she is She lays in that presence of that risen son that's why I said when I walked in some of them were sitting there and I said well good morning well good morning yeah I said the Sun's Up the sun's up it is the prophet said it is the rising of the sun good morning bride I'm not trying to be funny but it's just when we realize that that it is good morning to the bride it's a new day it's the bride time it's seed time it's Rapture time so we're going to progress with this but tonight I want to take a subtitle free indeed free indeed so these organizations are trying they'll never do it she'll not be she'll be taken up not closed up she is now risen Hallelujah are you with me she is now risen you said well Brother David I haven't changed it all but that would brother Bram not talking about physically we will physically R rise but what's he saying spiritually we've risen we rose with him when he rose see and how could we then rise with him and die spiritual we can't die when you raised with him you've passed from Death to life amen the body will pass away but this will rise again see what a what a what a freedom indeed what a free Freedom indeed so she's risen and by the power of the Vindicated word how do many know this message is Vindicated not to be William bram's message but yet it is William bram's message but it's the message of the seventh angel It's Christ it's his message amen and power of that's why that's why he Vindicated the word we're not just taking a word of a man we have a Vindicated word promised to us promised to her amen how a bride holds that promise he told me he would return after me you believe that he told me he would he said I'll come again and receive you to myself now that's already begun did you know that that's already begun but it's got to end with him also receiving and meeting us in the air but what's he doing he said he told me he we'd return after me I believe it uh-huh see yes sir to meet her headship so what's he come for to make her ready for her to be ready to meet him in the air that's what we got to do there's a meeting he's provided the ring the token he's provided the clothing she wears and the provided meeting place so he's come for us to be ready to get ready because how can we lay in the presence of the sun and the Sun not be present is that right so we're laying here ripening so I believe it yes sir to what's it for what's he what's he come this way for to meet her headship her Redeemer her husband her King her Lord her lover her savior in the provided meeting place so free indeed where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty so let's turn over to second or excuse me St John 8 just go right over here to John 8 and we'll begin reading here with verse 32 and you shall know the truth Jesus speaking you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free on verse 25 they said unto him who art thou and Jesus said unto them even the same that I said unto you from the beginning who art thou even the same as I said unto you from the beginning what was in the beginning the original word God was in the beginning amen so I've told you in the beginning I'm I said unto you from the beginning I have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sent me is true and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him and of course they understood not that he spake to them of the father then he and then he says over here in verse 32 again down here and he said and you shall know the truth and the truth shall shall make you free they answered him and said we be Abraham's seed we've never in bondage to any man how sayest thou you shall be made free Jesus said unto him verily I say unto you whosoever committes sin is the servant of sin now that's 1 John 3:8 if you just hold your spot there just a minute let me read this 1 John 3 and verse 8 and9 he he said he verse 8 of St John or 1 John 38 he said he that committes sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil I'll keep that in heart in your heart the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin for the seed remaineth in him and he cannot amen that ought to make his so happy and he cannot what's it mean to be born again to have that seed quickened in you made life who is that that's the sun revealed in you and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free whosoever is born of God do not commit sin for his seed remaineth for whose seed his seed God's seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God Amen so what that son revealed in you for that he might destroy the works of the devil what destroys the works of the devil the light being manifest will destroy the works of the devil all right the word destroys him so we go on here in St John and he said whosoever committeth sin is a servant of sin and the in verse 35 the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth ever now that house is a kingdom amen and and the servant won't abide in the house forever but the son abides in the house forever amen and verse 36 if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed amen if the son therefore makes you free you shall be free indeed amen turn with me to Galatians chapter 1 verse six six verse 15 and 16 and when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me now what's Romans 8:30 said to many let me just quickly read that to you you don't have to turn there but Romans 8:30 says whoever he called he would justify moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called amen have you been called if you heard you had the ability to hear the call amen many are called but not everyone can hear the call many are called but few are chosen so they that are chosen will receive and hear the call how did he call you and I through the word we were in the hour that we were to receive and hear that word for our day and we could hear that word could receive it the Bible said he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me is pass from Death To Life shall not come into condemnation okay what am I saying this for because you're free indeed we're trying trying he's trying to show us how free we are indeed if I might say this to be free indeed means in reality in truth in fact so to be free indeed means you're free in reality yeah in truth in fact so it's the truth you're free and it's a fact that you're free and it's real you're free amen he just we just read he said I can't lose them in St John 10 he said and I won't lose one of them amen no man can pluck them out of my hand so why should we fear any man or any organization when you know your free who can bind you to be free indeed to be free means to be at Liberty Amen to be free means not to be under restraint not restrain under restraint to the flesh to sin to death not enslaved to that you're freed amen not being under see not imprisoned and yet we are prisoners but we're not imprisoned to sin death the world we're not imprisoned we're free amen we're released we'll come into that after just a little bit here all right so so we see that who moreover whom he predestinated them he called and whom he called them he also Justified declared righteous and whom he justified them he also glorified it's brother sister you couldn't have it any better you may go through struggles and trials and pressures in this life but you're free indeed there's a reason for pressures there's a reason for trials and test but it's not for your demean it's for your good we'll we'll come into that in just a bit here all right so Galatians 1:16 said so when God pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace see it was Grace that called you you never merited Grace Grace is a free gift it was given to you all right so for for what purpose why did he why did he call me by his grace to reveal to reveal is to unveil to reveal his son in me where in me to reveal his son in me how many have a skull field Bible they looking at there's a little footnote h on there you see that little H right there that says in me we'll go to that in just a minute where that is but to reveal his son in me that I might preach him among the Heathen immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood why he was freed he didn't have to he wasn't conferring with flesh and blood he didn't even have any confidence in the flesh amen I didn't confer with it but he went to the word and proved his experience by the word amen all right so I so he said to reveal his son in me so if we go back to 2 Corinthians CH 4 we'll find where Paul referred there in me to reveal it's a birth it's the it's the it's the new birth that revealing of his son in him was the new the new man old things are passed away behold All Things become new so in in 2 Corinthians 4: 6 for God who commanded the light are we just saying about it we walk in the light God who commanded the light and God is light to shine out of Darkness has shined who has shined God has shined the light has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ so when he turned your heart to the Lord when the when your heart was turned to the Lord the veil was removed why was the veil when the veil was removed something was hid in the veil under that Veil now was made known now was revealed what was that Revelation that predestinated seed was quickened in you the veil was removed and the Word was opened the word where in you and so it comes down here and that Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is Glory where the spirit of the Lord is you're free indeed where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty amen you can walk every day in Liberty you don't have to worry about well I'm going to be up and I'm going to be down you'll have your ups and downs you'll have your failures you'll have this but that does not remove what you are it does not remove your freedom prise the Lord because B by God by Grace gave you life because you had and called you and you heard that call because that life was that seed was laying in you that you were chosen in him that seed was laying in you to be quickened and that quickening you heard the call and could receive it amen amen amen amen so what happened here so but we all with open face I preached on here a while back open face what is that whose face is open it's not David's whose face is open here it's Jesus Christ so then we go over here for then then we're changed into that image being changed we look into a glass we see who we are so we're being changed into that image from glory to glory is that right and that's our ministry 2 Corinthians 4:1 says that's our ministry what's our ministry the unveiling of God what's our ministry the third pull what's our ministry all right so ver or paragraph 290 of Christ The Mystery of God revealed this is the fourth or fifth time I brought this but that's not just because we're bringing it it's speaking something to you watch this it's Jesus Christ the new birth revealed in you what did what did the veil hide what did what the veil was taken away for what when it turned to the Lord the veil was removed amen so the veil being taken away now we come face to face with who we are and all we all with that unveiled face amen are free indeed amen we're we've we've actually raised right there there what a great resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is identifying we raised with him because that open Word in you identifies you are his property you're his eternal possession you're free indeed and can never be lost you're sealed to the day of your Redemption what is the seal what is the token it's the Holy Ghost himself yeah but in order to be born again to be born and birth of his spirit and how are you Birth by the spoken word that's why in this hour you had an ear to hear that word spoken because you were in me with me before you were with me from the beginning so you're my Witnesses you're with me from the beginning amen then where was it what was before the beginning a thought because in the beginning was the word and the word is a thought expressed so you were in me residing in me living in me abiding in me alive in me before the world began you were the very thought of myself and now I brought you into your age and your time that you would hear the word for your age and live it forth and what is the word for our age the second coming of Christ amen the son of man is being revealed again oh my brother sister we are not in amnesia amnesia is being taken away if it wasn't for the opening of these seals there would be Amnesia what is amnesia don't know where you come from and who you are you don't remember it but all that's been restored back because the Bible said he would restore amen is that right we're being restored back to the original faith and the original faith is God's faith what he had before the foundation of the world you weren't existing in him as a as a feeling you weren't existing as a as as you say it was a thought but that thought was substance that thought was faith and when God spoke even spoke the worlds into existence when he spoke you he spoke you into existence for you were with me Jesus said you're my witness for you're with me from the beginning why having an ear to hear him hear the word for the hour I identifies it's revealed to you which is your evidence that that holy spirit that you were called and alive in him and you are his property then you're free indeed for because who the sun sets free is free indeed amen and you shall know the truth what's the truth the sun revealed amen the word is truth my word is truth Jesus said I am the truth I am the very word for the season and time I'm that word made manifest I am truth yes where is the truth today that truth now is in the form of his bribe it's in you truth the son is revealed in you you heard your call he revealed his his son in you is a revelation showing that before the world began it was in Christ and now you've receival you received that token which identifies your faith is God's faith you say if I just had Faith you have faith' amen God will reveal the faith he Reveals His Faith to you amen he reveals himself to you for the believer what's the believer it's not David David's not the believer put your name there that's not the believer is God's Own Faith amen the believer is the faith of God what's the faith of God it's substance it's the word it's the word living and in action amen and so he Reveals His Son and so here we are with this open face beholding in a glass the glory of the Lord because why we were spoken into existence by the word amen 1 Peter 1:23 said we're born by the word amen the prophet says he speaks the word and that's how he bursts his children because they have an ear to hear that word they are seed they are spoken word seed bride so it's Jesus Christ the new birth revealed in you that has the pinenes that he might Express his words and anything that he promised in these last days he can bring it to pass through his body as he's working who's his body his bride is his body we just read that she is his body and he can bring it through that body which is what his property it's his body did you know God takes residence in you and you're his body led by The Same Spirit he was led by coming from the same Source he came by amen predestinated he would predestinated seed as he was makes the Word Flesh in you just as it was in him amen free indeed you're free indeed amen free in reality this is not a story this is reality this is not a some myth it's truth it's fact all right and it's made known you don't have to make it happen and pump it up to happen it happens it works through you life comes through the body and we're here to present life we're here and where's and and the trumpet still sounding the Call's still going out where is it going out from the spirit and the bride say come yeah they say come what they say come out of her my people brother ramam said that voice is still calling out come out of her how's it how's it calling out because the spirit and the bride say come big letter capital c o look in your Bible revelations 2217 said the spirit and the bride say capital c o m come come where you coming to to your deliverance to your freedom to the feast yes amen how many you're called to a feast and the Call's still going out and it'll call until the last one's called and at the last Trump Hallelujah there'll be a resurrection amen no more can be called then that the last Trump that's it it's finished amen and it may be the door may be shut now we don't know we don't know when that door is going to shut it may be shut I hope it isn't amen I I pray it isn't but it will be there can't be another one come in think of that so I think we ought to work out our salvation with fear and trembling make your calling and election sure okay I don't this screen working you're not no working on this screen so we don't have no time okay all right okay now he's working through his body it's just exactly the word of God made manifest notice all right but I'm talking brother BR said I'm talking about the headship of Christ Christ that's just what I read to you it's Jesus Christ revealed the new birth revealed in you we're talking about the headship of Christ notice being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's question yes amen glory we have the answer to the devil's question he Christ is risen and has paid the price in raising up the body the devil can't stand it that's the reason these ecuminical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're all coming into what they're doing now amen and it's it's happening now amen and it's very it's very subtle all right the devil that's the reason he's howling the way he is his wickedness and his schemes been uncovered by the Risen resurrected Christ in the headship over his body amen you think I'm beside myself I'm not we got the devil's answer amen amen not me that liveth not me that liveth it's not you living it's not the man you living that's right oh but my goodness we say well I failed I guess that's it no no when you're free indeed there's no failure hello amen you say but I failed here but you didn't fail here when that's revealed in you there's no failure well that just gives me the I can just have Liberty to do whatever I want yes but there's one thing you don't desire to do and that's do anything contrary to the word and yet you'll fall and yet you'll fail I don't mean Fall Away to apostasy I'm talking about just falling daily daily we backslide daily we make failures daily we say things we didn't want to say do things we don't want to do that brother sister what makes the difference is the seed word word in you made alive that's what gives you the freedom God called you you didn't produce it you didn't do it you didn't marit it God knew you God predestinated you God chose you it's all God's working it's all God's achievement it's God in you working and he's going to bring you and fulfilled his purpose that he had for you amen it can't fail it just can't fail you're free indeed all right so so he says here now I had a I had a scripture here the reason I'm hesitating a minute there was a oh no it wasn't uh well maybe we'll come across it's all right we've got the devil's answer not me that liveth but Christ that liveth in me it's not my idea it's his power not my idea it's his word he promised it here it is how many can say this day personally this day this scripture is fulfilled in me Amen in you he said it would be here and here it is amen we got his answer we have Satan's answer God has Vindicated himself God proves himself to his promise in the last day Hallelujah the headship is here amen Christ the Risen Lord he is he is here in the same power of his resurrection that he ever was manifesting himself there's the devil's answer let me read that again he said he said the headship is here amen Christ the Risen Lord is here in the same power of his resurrection that he ever was manifesting himself there's the devil answer when he wants to come and accuse you tell him his accusing is he can he can't accuse you there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus amen he can accuse all he wants but is but as accusing who is he accuses you Christ has Justified you already declared you righteous he's going to accuse you of not being righteous he's a liar because you've already you you are already righteous this isn't an idea that you formed in your mind it's not an imagination it's a revelation it's a reality all right he said the headship and the body has become one unit it's Jesus Christ the new birth revealed in you the headship and the body has become one unit it's God manifested in you it's in his people that's the reason the husband wife is no longer Twain amen they're one you received his seed you received that germ you're one amen amen yet that Oneness isn't like me and my wife CU my wife could be somewhere else and I'd be here and yet I'm still one with her but Jesus said my my wife and I are one if you've seen me if you see me he said you've seen God if you see the bride you see Christ yeah amen amen that's right so that kind of Oneness is different amen because he's in you all right now they're one God and his church is one in Christ in you God's Great Revelation what's God's Great Revelation Christ in you who's going to know this is there any bride here tonight amen they're the only ones can know it amen amen this is the evidence to you personally this is what identifies you personally you know you're identified why because the god that wrote this word the god that spoke in this hour and day the god that called me is now revealed in me showing me showing me personally that I'm his seed I'm his possession amen now how do we get this lay in the word you have a message to feed on well I'm just not interested you're not interested then in the word in the Christ in the going home in the time in the season see it takes more than just well well okay you've got two powers only two Powers two Vines today two powers and that's Satan's power and God's power one is death the other is life now which will you choose life is presented to us death and life has come to us in this day what are we going to do with it I know what the bride will do with it amen amen you can't make yourself bride God Made You bride God reveals that to you that's how you know it's not something I can imagine it's something I know amen she knows all right now and we stand Justified the Bible said he that he predestined he called do he called he justified and we stand Justified Justified means you never did it in the first place it also it means this Justified means you are declared righteous God has declared you righteous amen God has declared you in himself God has declared you that you were a part of him always was a part of him how could he lose any part of him he can't amen amen he can't lose any part of him amen let's just go over here to John 6 a minute let me just read to you what I'm getting a rebound here John 6 John 6 and verse 13 no let me no six six David verse 20 um H I got to get to John okay can't I can't find John 6 in Luke I got to go over here to John 6 I didn't have this written down and I meant to yeah okay John 6 John 6:38 we'll start with and I came I came down I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the will which has sent me that of all which he hath given me amen I should lose nothing Hallelujah were you given to him see see you were given to him I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I'll raise him up at the last day no man verse 44 can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day amen he can't lose you he's your you're his you were given to him amen and how could you come in your own you couldn't come in your own the father called you he drawed you no man can come to him except the father draws him aren't you glad you were drawn your heart was spoken to you gave your life to Jesus Christ see that's not just think how simple it is but yet how pushed out and pushed away it's like it's like it's oldfashioned now no you still must be born again amen amen that's right all right but if you're born again it shows the seed of God's in you it was placed there planted there before the world began all right that's why you're Justified We Stand justified in Christ before him because he cannot pass judgment for he's already judged that body in which I'm a part of he's already judged that body which I'm a part of what how am I a part of it here it is it's in me how am I a part of it it's in me how do you know it's in me nobody will know you see I can tell you all day it's in me but but how am I going to prove it's in me the life I live proves it's in me amen amen but I know what's in me because it's revealed in me I have no question about it I'm free indeed amen amen amen he's not judging me after mistakes and failures how can he judge me after that when he's took all that judgment the the chastisement of my peace was upon him he was wounded for my transgression bruised for my iniquity the chastisement all these failures all these things that are pressing against me my UPS and my downs and the outer man yeah he already took it yeah he already bore it he already freed you he freed you at Calvary and the faith that's in you says yes to that here's that and God by that comes in and makes himself known to you so here it is it's in me already judge that body which I'm a part of oh my it's in me my if if you abide in me and my words in you then you say ask the father anything in my name it'll be done because because it's there it's there Justified glory to God justified in his sight we are Justified we are his victory right we are his victory how can we be his victory because he's in US yes so that he and I are one he's Victory I'm Victory he's my victory I'm his victory yeah are you with me all right so we are his victory the church is his victory we came forth in the last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for the purpose we are the proof of that Victory amen he died for the purpose of what washing me releasing me freeing me amen he died for that purpose and we are the proof of his victory when we when we see him coming down and living among the church when we see him coming down living among the chur among the church that's his victory now well brother sister we're living in Victory right we aren't fighting the battle for victory we already have victory victory is assured victory is mine victory is yours being born again you already have Victory you say well I got to fight this battle to get Victory you fight the battle to prove your Victory to prove you have Victory amen amen amen all right shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave and neither can they keep us see in this and he can't and we and and he and we are not kept in the grave of this graveyard of our own body our feelings either we are free indeed we're freed of that think of it the body the feelings want to speak contrary I'm free of it there's no confidence in that I have no confidence in that in my feelings in my senses in my reasoning I have no confidence in man amen I don't even know I don't even know I don't don't know the real me through this amen I don't know the real me because of this my feelings you can't judge yourself and what you are on the inside because of your faults and your failures right what's inside of you becomes a reality and a revelation is the evidence that you're his then what are we frowning about what are we afraid of what are we fear ing the devil is going to point you to to the reality of who you are inside he's going to try to point you what to your faults and failures your your your your failing he's going to point you to that said I thought you said this oh yeah I guess that's right no the word says you've already passed from Death to life he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me is already pass there's no condemnation now I've got to come down here to an end okay justify in his sight all right now we're potential we're already raised from the dead unbelief of his word from denominational Creeds to an eternal word of the Eternal God which is himself working through US manifesting himself that he's the same yesterday today and forever it's identification you're identified oh the devil's howling about this the manifested truth of the promised word in her alone what's he howling about the manifested word of the promise manifested in her alone amen Revelation 1: 15 said unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood he said would you he said the word wash is actually loosed the word wash means to be loosed so he's washed Us in his own blood loosed us from our sins in his own blood is is that right isn't that wonderful you're loosed when you're loosed you're freed he stood your place he to he pardoned you it's finished all right but you but are you spiritual minded did you catch it it was his own blood that loosed this not a blood of a man it was the blood of God perfect now watch watch what he says it was not human blood it was the blood of God Peter called it the blood of Christ Paul called it the blood of the Lord and the blood of Jesus one person that is that is that Revelation again one God that omnipotent Jehovah came down and made himself a body by means of a virgin birth and indwell it that he might be the that that it might be the blood of God that would free us notice the blood of God that would free us he who the son set sets free yes have you been set free see have you been set free then you'll want his word you'll want to receive it you'll want to feed on it oh the devil will keep you so loaded up with everything else including the internet and videos and and this this this this line and this line and this chat line and that chat line and all you see what is happening Satan knows that faith comes by hearing the word yes amen he'll steal it remember he's the thief he comes to steal and destroy but Jesus said I am come to give life and that more abundantly so where's our choice amen and why would you why why would why would one say yes to that word the other say I don't know I can't live it no you can't live it I'll just tell you right now you try all you want to do and live it you can't live it in your own body your own fleshly man you'll never live it you can frustrate and get FR that's just the exactly what the devil wants but as soon as you turn to the word and say but he did this for me he gave it to me that's mine regardless less of how I feel amen then what's going to happen is going to make him mad but there's his answer it's not I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me and the life I now live in this flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me and it's not me that liveth it's Christ amen is that right there's your token there's your Assurance there's your freedom walk in it we are to walk in the light amen that's why that song was so important we'll walk in the light what's come to light open face what's come unveiled what's opened walk in the light well it makes the devil mad I don't care how mad he gets or how many don't want to believe it I do there's going to be somebody believe it though she's a minority she's in the minority today she has a great big system that's against her and they will try to destroy her amen but they won't do it she'll be taken up all right would you like an Old Testament type let's go back to the Garden of Eden see the blood freed us okay let's go back to the Garden of Eden when the when the news came to Glory that his son Adam had been lost did God send an angel did he send a son did he send another one like us no what' he do who was calling for Adam who came down looking for him who came himself see God did he came himself to redeem that lost son Hallelujah God did not entrust his plan to of Salvation to another he trusted only himself amen so what are you trusting in he said I'm trusting in God then you're trusting in yourself too the real self amen the real person all right he trusted only himself God was made flesh and dwelt among us he has today that's what he is doing today and redeemed us unto himself we're saved and if he came down not only brother Brown said he didn't complete Redemption on the cross he started it his completion of redemption is when he took the book and claimed his redeemed rights that finishes Redemption now we have the complete revelation of Christ amen and you're that completeness you're that Capstone of that creation amen amen amen what manner of people ought we to be when we know we are free indeed amen and we can't be shut up we can't be closed up we're taken up all right so now he he were saved by the blood of God the Eternal God indwelt a mortal body in order to take away sin he became the lamb in order to shed his blood and entered into the veil with it then where would where did he Enter he went entered into the veil where is that he entered into your soul is what he did he could enter in because that was inside the veil amen how he had to make the way for the veil to be rent amen and he did amen consider this since it is the blood of God then it is perfect blood listen to me carefully since consider this tonight consider this since it is the blood of God it is perfect blood and if the perfect blood is loosing or washing us loosing us freeing us from the power and bondage and defilement of sin then the loosing is perfect and complete amen amen and you know that because he's given you the token of his own life then the loosing is complete and it's perfect you're completely perfectly loosed you're freed indeed amen that's right the loosing is perfect and complete so therefore there is now no condemnation then is God going to come with condemnation when you're loosed and freed from condemn ation and he paid the Judgment of it for you and you were in him paying that judgment in his own body and you're loosed can he is he going to be the one and come back and condemn you no the devil will be the condemner god may come back and bring conviction that you did something say God I didn't mean to do it he knew you didn't mean to do it he already forgave you from doing it because you're already Justified you don't you see I don't care how many failures and faults you go through and how good or bad you are has nothing to do with that predestinated seed that's alive in you and made and quickened in you amen you're already his he can't come say well you did this I've no that's back to Old Law he's not judging us by the law the law condemned us he freed us from the law amen now we are F now he fulfilled the law amen hallelujah who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth now I tell you who's going to lay anything to the charge of God's elect who's going to condemn her Jesus said himself who can condemn me of sin who can accuse me of it the judge has already freed me the judge in the book being opened the book says I am absolutely free and there's no record that I ever sinned let me say that again the book has opened I've been in I've found in that book that book has re has CL he's claimed his own he's claimed his own seed he's claimed his own bride he's claimed us amen he claimed he come forth and claimed what he has redeemed and paid the penalty of Through Blood he now claims it amen and there's nothing that's going to condemn me I'm freed from condemnation there is no record there is absolutely no record I'm Justified no record that I ever ever committed sin amen amen amen I challenge you and I tomorrow and when you go out of this church to face the devil with that amen and tell him you're a liar this is what the word said is written and it's written of me the Bible never once accused his bride of being a loser she is a winner that's right God no place in the Bible does it say you bride are losers you are winners amen you are conquerors through him that loved you nothing can separate you from his love he already expresses his love he expresses it every day to you by reproving and disciplining you through those trials and things you go through but it's love it's his love for you to bring you to that predestinated place that you're predestinated to stand in amen amen amen amen hallelujah oh my I'm just getting ready to preach now all right now so there it is his death gave us the blood who who is going to condemn who is he that condemneth see he's declared us righteous then brother Brown said he's he's Justified us he's declared us righteous those are his own words then who is he that condemneth amen amen smile you're free amen you're free yes indeed you're free amen hallelujah you I don't feel like I'm free Brother David I don't feel like it I make so many mistakes I don't even know if I want to go on and even live for this anymore then turn to the world if that's in your heart turn but if it's not in your heart you can't amen if it's in your heart to live for God you're going to live for God that's all there is to it if that life is in you to be predestinate predestinate life chosen in him there's no way shape or form you are even able to turn amen amen cuz God has already decided and already declared himself to you and has Justified you already and has already glorified you amen I'm talking about his bride I don't care I don't I can't say what the others will do but the bride the bride has the ear to hear his voice his voice amen all right now don't listen to man his death gave us the blood the blood is Loos us there's no condemnation How can there be there's nothing to be condemned for because the BL has loosed us there's nothing to be condemned for we are free we are Guiltless don't listen to man listen to the word you are loosed freed by the blood amen now don't get tied down again by traditions and Creeds and organizations and your feelings I put that in don't let don't be led astray by listening to those who deny the power of the word and deny that Jesus saves heals fills with the Holy Ghost you are God's free men loosed by his own blood amen I'll tell you wisdom isn't going to win it's Faith that's going to win not the wisdom of man it looks like wisdom will win but that little church that believes the full word of God certainly a minority don't you worry the Bible said fear not little flock it's your father's Good Will to give you the kingdom uh-huh that's right and don't fear stay in faith stay right with the word don't leave the word stay with the word by faith we're saved not by wisdom is that right not by wisdom not by knowledge but by Revelation we're saved for that's exactly right by revelation we are saved all right amen you've already been given you've already his that Faith that's in you has already been confirmed he's given you the token the circumcision of the heart oh elect of God beware study closely be careful work out your own salvation with fear and trembling rely upon God and be strong in his might that's a good thing we're ending here on this rely upon God rely upon God and be strong in his might your adversary you have an adversary in fact your adversary is closer than you think right this old outer man is your adversary amen this outer man brother brandom said is the evil one amen and if you didn't have that keeping power inside of your soul yeah that's right where would you be tonight well my parents make me come oh really where's your soul tonight you want to be saved you desire to be saved you desire to go on you can feed on dedicar and if you want to I choose life amen I choose to be free instead of bound he has not given you the spirit of bondage you've been released from bondage amen amen amen yeah I've been released from bondage free indeed so rely upon God your adversary is now even going about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour watch unto prayer and be steadfast This is the End Time both the true and false Vine are coming into maturity why I say those seven stars does it mean maturity is the astronomic of Heaven declaring the bride is mature how close are we to stepping out of here you know what very close closer than I think we realize amen it's close amen these things are quickly you know the pope up here he's having been in the hospital one word says he's about ready to die the well he's feeling pretty good but they won't really come out and say how he is but you know what you know what let me just pass this on to you I wonder if the next one's coming out of the United States look what the Prophet said paragraph 87 of of a message called acts of the Holy Spirit 541 1219 evening 54 I believe one of these glorious days when the United Confederation of church goes together and brother sister they are going together they are becoming very politically strong and what they do is going to look real reasonable because the buck against that they're going to be they're going to come they're going to go together they're and and they they own phenomenal wealth in fact they own so much phenomenal wealth that every perfect time they can buy it out she can they she become politically strong how they doing it see you see how it's working you see you see what the spirit am I lost my mic I lost my mic okay it's still on though okay okay I guess I'm back they become politically strong I could read a lot of quotes to you right now I had some things marked down I'll have to get it another time but there's a Temptation don't you fall under that Temptation we're not just reading words here to be reading them tonight we're not just saying what we're saying just to be saying it rely upon God Amen stay true to that word and he's trying to tell you you are free just walk in your freedom walk with me just walk with me let go and let me as our Pro our Pastor said let go and let God have his wonderful way then let go let go of yourself let go and take God at his word take him at his word amen while we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things seen are temporal how can you put any confidence in something temporal but in the Unseen the Eternal things getting back to that quote one of these days when the confederation of church goes together and they're binding they're bound remember they're Bound in the bundle is bound they're bound and The Binding is that that Confederation of church that ecumenical council they're coming right together in it uniting together that's the binding amen that's the binding all right I believe one of these days when the at church come together and the new pope is brought out of the United States and put over there according to prophecy then they'll form an image like unto the Beast exactly what they're heading for now who Mo what's motivating this this President see what's motivating I can tell you what's motivating it's the spirit it's the spirit of the Beast it's the spirit of Rome she's behind every bit of it now I know that goes online he said be careful what you say I'm I'm careful what I say I'm saying the truth am that's right all right so and I tell you the Church of God will be drove together an IM we make an image to the Beast and I tell you when these things happen the True Church of God will be drove together the real true believers that have come out of Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal Nazarene Pilgrim Hol is Catholic and whatever they'll be will be will go together and cemented by the love of God that will make the body of the Lord Jesus Christ all the Believers and an agnostics and the agnostics and the shallow-minded will be cast will be cast to one side they'll go right on into the confederation of churches you see there's been a separating now it's all separating the two Vines are mature in thought I'd drop that in if you ever wonder where that is he did say it all right but before the wheat matures both true and false Vine are coming maturity but before the wheat matures those ripened tears must be bound for the burning now they're not burned all at once but they are bound and the burning comes later see they are all joining they are all joining the World Council of churches that is The Binding soon the garnering of the wheat will come the Gathering of the wheat the garnering of the wheat what gathers the wheat shout voice a trumpet gathers the wheat into the Garner all right that's happening brother sister I think we ought to get on board amen it's you know the Train's only stopping once here amen we better throw down the bag of peanuts or it's leaving amen that's right that's the truth you can't play around with it anymore the Train's here one stop that's it it's moving on going on to the east going on to Israel the bride's being called away you say is she yes she is she is and soon it'll manifest itself in a body change amen all right now as many as I love and rebuke I chasen now this is where I'm I'm ending as many as I love and rebuke and chasen he said to rebuke is to reprove so rebuke means to reprove to reprove is to expose with a view to correction Chason doesn't mean to punish you Chason means to discipline you so he's he rebukes he reproves and he disciplines isn't that wonderful all right we have a father he reproves and disciplines because the sub object's amendment is in mind other words he's got a purpose for that he's got a purpose to train you see herein is now set forth the love of God and he desired in his love a family of his own a family of Sons Sons like himself there therefore before him there before him lies all mankind is one lump of clay out of that same lump will he now make vessels unto honor and to dishonor the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained will be trained to conform to His Image in their walk he reproves with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy he disciplines with nail scarred hands sometimes this Potter must take the vessel is working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires it but it is love that is love and another way there is not there cannot be amen he said there would be a strength I can't find that right now so I'm not going to try to find it but he talked about the this little flock he said he said that denominational Church will church will seek to destroy the bride and it'll be a threefold as a threefold cord is not easily broken you'll have you'll have the power of physical political power and Satan satanical power he said now the bride they'll seek to destroy the bride but she will she will suffer but she will endure so brother sister let's stand with me thank God we have a we have something we look forward to she will endure amen praise the Lord praise the Lord I wish I could find that because that would help but I just didn't get it written down so I must not be I was supposed to bring it God knows all things but aren't you glad we're living in the end time the hour has come when we're going to go home so let's be ready make your calling election sure lay aside every little weight that so easily beset you and run with patience the race that's set before you doing what looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of your faith [Music] amen who for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross he despised amen that suffering for who for your sake and mine let us with joy keep our Focus not look down around us let's look down at the end and see the goal and stay steady God bless you I'd like to sing a couple songs [Music] here the greatest love story if I hope I can I don't know if I know that verse very well do you know that brother why don't you come and lead [Music] us God bless you I'd like to sing that song and then that one I I mentioned the other one too the why I'm so happy and then if you have another one on your heart we go right ahead God bless you I left a baren land searching for rest stumbling around in Amnesia bitterness and distress but then I met the kinsman redeemer who's called the mighty one he took this old
