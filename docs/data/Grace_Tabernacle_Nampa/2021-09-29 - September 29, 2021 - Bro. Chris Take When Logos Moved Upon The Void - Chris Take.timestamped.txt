[21:47] a service
[21:48] saturday
[21:50] five services well actually five
[21:54] teaching meetings you could say
[21:56] and then a service at night and then
[21:58] another service
[22:00] sunday morning was really good brother
[22:03] actually all of it was really good
[22:05] but five different speakers
[22:07] and um
[22:08] of course i don't believe any one of the
[22:10] brothers knew what each what each the
[22:12] other was
[22:13] going to speak about
[22:15] and it was just wonderful to see how the
[22:17] holy ghost just really dovetailed
[22:18] everything together and made the lord
[22:21] made a theme
[22:23] out of the whole thing so
[22:25] that in itself was really special
[22:27] that was very very nice and
[22:31] i especially loved sunday morning i just
[22:34] i couldn't hardly stay in my skin
[22:38] so
[22:39] anyway um that was brother jason watkins
[22:42] that preached that morning brother chris
[22:44] wasn't even there he went and preached
[22:46] in virginia with brother stephen coffey
[22:48] well that's good for him i'm sure he had
[22:50] a wonderful time
[22:51] but they fed us fed us fed us
[22:55] we got up had breakfast
[22:57] had a
[22:58] like a devotional
[23:00] went downstairs to a banquet room had
[23:03] our first little class had a little
[23:05] snack
[23:07] went back into the banquet room had
[23:09] another service
[23:10] another little snack or maybe it was
[23:12] lunch maybe
[23:13] and then after that another one i mean
[23:15] there was just boom boom boom and they
[23:16] would feed us in between each one so
[23:20] three meals a day plus and then there
[23:22] was a service every evening
[23:24] and well and um
[23:26] after every evening
[23:28] church would get over 11
[23:30] and then they'd have pizza for us
[23:32] [Laughter]
[23:34] or a sandwich or something so we'd be up
[23:36] till 11 30 midnight and so it was a
[23:39] packed
[23:40] couple days we were there and so um the
[23:43] people that hosted me there in north
[23:44] carolina they were very
[23:47] very friendly and very hospitable
[23:50] chris clayville was his name and his
[23:52] wife
[23:55] chris's wife was keisha and that is
[23:58] brother daniel fryho's daughter
[24:01] so anyway
[24:03] that's who who took brother chris and i
[24:05] in so it was a wonderful time we really
[24:07] enjoyed it
[24:08] we sang until our throats were
[24:11] just raspy
[24:14] and so
[24:15] yeah
[24:16] so anyway we really enjoyed it
[24:18] thank you
[24:21] amen i guess if they feed you enough
[24:23] you're too full you can't move
[24:25] [Laughter]
[24:27] and then they can just preach

[29:46] only one weekend but it feels like a lot
[29:48] longer when you
[29:50] do as much
[29:51] from
[29:53] north carolina to tennessee or virginia
[29:55] and back
[29:56] which is only a few hours but
[29:59] it still feels like a lot um appreciated
[30:02] your prayers on sunday the lord gave us
[30:03] a good service
[30:05] spoke to hearts of the people and that's
[30:08] what it's all about
[30:10] amen if you have your bibles you want to
[30:12] stand with me tonight
[30:18] had a wonderful time in the word brother
[30:20] trevor gave us the testimony of it
[30:24] um
[30:26] the theme he mentioned there was a theme
[30:28] and the theme was submitting to the
[30:30] authority of christ
[30:32] which i thought was really good i talked
[30:34] a lot about wives submitting to the
[30:36] husbands but the man must submit to the
[30:38] authority of christ
[30:40] and whatever position he's given
[30:42] he cannot be effective unless he submits
[30:45] to the authority of god
[30:47] hey
[30:48] genesis chapter one
[31:06] genesis chapter 1 verse 1.
[31:12] in the beginning god created the heaven
[31:14] and the earth
[31:16] period
[31:17] right
[31:18] verse two and the earth was without form
[31:20] and void and darkness was upon the face
[31:22] of the deep and the spirit of god moved
[31:24] upon the face of the waters
[31:27] and god said let there be light
[31:30] and there was light with our heads
[31:32] tonight
[31:33] gracious heavenly father we asked that
[31:34] you just take us one more time tonight
[31:36] and use us for your glory we're asking
[31:38] that you would speak to us lord we're
[31:40] all familiar with one another lord jesus
[31:43] is familiar with this building familiar
[31:45] with the process but lord may that
[31:47] familiarity not become too common lord
[31:50] may we not forget that in that
[31:52] familiarity lord your word is still ever
[31:55] changing lord ever progressing in our
[31:58] lives not that your word itself changes
[32:00] but the revelation that we have grows
[32:03] and expounds lord and father if we get
[32:05] too caught up with the familiarity of
[32:07] their surroundings lord our senses can
[32:10] become gold father may we be sharpened
[32:12] tonight lord father may our desire for
[32:15] you grow our revelation of who you are
[32:17] in us father grow tonight we pray for
[32:21] once once again remember our pastor lord
[32:23] out uh
[32:25] mountain home lord give him strength and
[32:27] be with them keep them safe lord just
[32:30] looking forward to hearing from you
[32:32] tonight we love you lord jesus and we
[32:34] commit ourselves and his words and this
[32:36] service into your hands in the name of
[32:38] jesus we pray
[32:40] amen you may be seated tonight
[32:42] praise the lord so
[32:44] oh you know what i never even gave alex
[32:46] my title that's all right then you
[32:48] wouldn't see it before i said it that's
[32:49] fine
[32:50] so my title tonight is when logos moved
[32:53] upon the void i don't know if you can
[32:55] turn this up down one up here down a
[32:58] little bit but
[32:59] um so when logos moved upon the void
[33:03] um the subtitle is and there was light
[33:06] so but
[33:08] says here in the smyrna church age
[33:12] down through the centuries we could go
[33:13] we find a moses a jeremiah
[33:17] a john the baptist and each one of these
[33:19] were god's eternal thought expressed in
[33:22] its season
[33:25] you guys are going to go to the next
[33:26] line
[33:28] well anyways there we go
[33:30] so he says down through the centuries we
[33:31] could go we find a moses a jeremiah a
[33:34] john the baptist and each one of these
[33:35] were god's eternal thought expressed in
[33:38] its season then we come to jesus the
[33:41] logos he was the perfect and complete
[33:43] thought expressed and he became known as
[33:46] the word that is what he is and forever
[33:50] will be
[33:51] amen just want to say it's good to be
[33:52] back like preaching to you guys not that
[33:54] i don't like preaching elsewhere but
[33:57] you're my people
[33:58] amen so um the logos was jesus
[34:02] jesus was the manifestation of the logos
[34:05] and we know in the if you're any kind of
[34:07] of a student of the word that the logos
[34:09] was everything that christ was all the
[34:12] attributes of christ
[34:14] everything combined in to this one thing
[34:17] and and uh we in the english language we
[34:19] have the word
[34:21] word um but it only goes so far in its
[34:24] definition and so that's why i believe
[34:26] brother branham pulled the greek word
[34:28] logos because there's so much more in
[34:31] the meaning of that word it's all the
[34:33] details and all the dna of god packed
[34:36] into that thing and
[34:38] um praise the lord it's all the word and
[34:40] so um in the beginning as we read here
[34:43] that god began to speak and brother
[34:45] manuel says that the logos goes out so
[34:47] he says here in the seed shall not be
[34:49] heir with the shock 1965 he was god the
[34:53] logos the word that went out of god
[34:56] remember they're one of the same okay
[34:59] but he says when it begin to brood upon
[35:02] the earth and it brought forth marine
[35:04] life when the spirit of god the logos
[35:07] the word which god said let there be and
[35:10] there went the logos which is the word
[35:14] so when god said let there be light and
[35:16] and god began to speak creation
[35:20] begin to speak the creation of the earth
[35:22] the logos went out now i believe god
[35:25] didn't have to get maybe
[35:27] minutely specific you didn't have to say
[35:30] this many oak trees or this many pine
[35:32] trees or pine trees here or or maple
[35:35] trees here or or whatever but the logos
[35:39] contained all of those details needed to
[35:43] bring forth life exactly how god had
[35:46] envisioned it
[35:47] amen and so the logos begin to brood
[35:50] over the earth and if you it's funny if
[35:52] you go look up the word brooding it
[35:53] means to be upset
[35:55] but the context here what i'm trying to
[35:57] say is that like a hen sitting on her
[35:59] eggs
[36:00] um so
[36:02] the word went out the logos went out
[36:04] which is the word he goes on to say and
[36:05] the word begin to cause all this
[36:10] he says the word begin to and then he
[36:11] says because all this was in the logos
[36:14] so everything was in the lord god look
[36:15] us the whole word of god the whole bible
[36:18] for every age
[36:20] and as the logos begin to breathe upon
[36:22] the earth there come marine life and
[36:24] building up the bird life on up to
[36:27] animal life and finally there comes
[36:29] something now watch now something in the
[36:32] representation or looked like the thing
[36:34] that was brewing it
[36:36] brooding over it god a man in the very
[36:40] image of god
[36:42] so as the logos is brooding over it then
[36:45] at his because
[36:47] creation built upon creation there is a
[36:51] progression right
[36:52] it's not evolution but god started with
[36:54] the small and worked his way all the way
[36:55] through so he says he worked all the way
[36:58] through and then comes forth
[37:00] a representation of the logos in other
[37:03] words a man
[37:04] in the image of god
[37:06] it was our first glimpse
[37:09] of the image of god he goes on to say he
[37:12] says that man fell like the seed has to
[37:14] fall and then god began to brood over
[37:17] that after the fall so the logos brood
[37:20] was brooding over the earth the earth
[37:22] was without form and void but then logos
[37:24] would now begin to brood over the earth
[37:27] and brought forth life of the earth that
[37:30] we see today
[37:31] but then
[37:32] god that logos it's still there today
[37:35] that's why in this fall this this the
[37:38] flowers die and they come back in the
[37:39] spring because the logos is still there
[37:42] and um um
[37:44] but he says but then god says and then
[37:46] god begin to brood over that in other
[37:49] words the man
[37:50] after the fall
[37:52] so he says he brought up a enoch he
[37:54] brought up an elijah he brought up a
[37:57] moses he brought up prophet after
[37:58] prophet trying to restore that image
[38:01] again even just like he moved through
[38:03] creation trying to bring that image
[38:06] again in fallen man amen and finally
[38:09] upon the earth came the genuine image of
[38:11] god himself
[38:13] again
[38:14] not the first time again which was god
[38:17] the logos made flesh and dwelt among us
[38:21] you see adam was in the image of god but
[38:24] adam fell
[38:25] so adam was the potential
[38:28] that christ was
[38:30] and and so down through god god tries
[38:33] through these prophets and things and
[38:35] finally as it were he says all right
[38:38] i gotta go down and do it myself
[38:40] it was all part of his plan right
[38:42] it wasn't like oh this isn't working i'm
[38:44] gonna step in but if you will you could
[38:46] say god's like all right i'm gonna go
[38:48] down and take care of business now is
[38:50] the time so christ himself
[38:53] goes down and he's the man manifestation
[38:56] of the low gods made flesh and dwelt
[38:58] among us now brother brown talks a lot
[39:01] about god turning a corner and everybody
[39:04] else missing it now you have to be
[39:05] paying attention to the word or the
[39:07] logos
[39:09] moving in the church moving in the age
[39:11] moving in your life to turn the corner
[39:13] when god turns the corner and so
[39:16] when when when christ came down you can
[39:18] say oh jesus
[39:21] two thousand years ago but what happened
[39:23] is everything that christ was god turned
[39:25] a corner at the day of pentecost
[39:27] everything that christ was he poured
[39:29] into the church so now the met full
[39:32] manifestation of the logos in the
[39:34] mini-member body
[39:36] let's continue finish the quote here now
[39:37] that same logos has a part he has got a
[39:40] bride and the same logos this word
[39:43] cannot be tampered with is brooding over
[39:46] the churches today trying to bring back
[39:49] the word to its full manifestation
[39:53] so brother i was talking about today
[39:55] right now
[39:56] wednesday
[39:58] um
[40:00] september 29th
[40:02] 2021 today
[40:04] god is brooding over the church and my
[40:06] brother says in other places god's
[40:08] pulling a bride from the church so in
[40:10] other words logos is brooding over the
[40:12] church
[40:13] bringing forth life
[40:16] from that
[40:18] which is the bride of christ and so he
[40:20] says we're trying to bring back the word
[40:22] to its full manifestation what's the
[40:25] full manifestation of the word
[40:27] christ
[40:30] in other words the bride is the full
[40:33] manifestation of the word or she has
[40:35] that potential you say
[40:37] this
[40:38] just kick the dog you see no but it's
[40:41] what's inside of you and we're going to
[40:42] get to that so the bride is a full
[40:44] manifestation so what uh in 1963 brother
[40:47] says what shall i do with jesus called
[40:49] christ he says when the word has been
[40:51] spoken for this certain generation
[40:54] there's going to be somebody rise on the
[40:56] scene that'll fulfill that word because
[41:00] god has spoken
[41:02] so why are you going to overcome because
[41:05] god spoke it
[41:07] why is there going to be a bride from
[41:09] the laodicean church age because god
[41:11] spoke it
[41:13] amen why do we have a revelation of god
[41:15] in us through us to us because god spoke
[41:20] it
[41:21] he says it's a vindication of the spoken
[41:23] word and jesus met every qualification
[41:26] and was the word vindicated as messiah
[41:29] exactly there's also words spoken in the
[41:32] bible for the last day those words have
[41:36] to come
[41:38] from the tape
[41:40] have to come to life
[41:43] in other words christ living and
[41:46] breathing walking on the face of the
[41:50] earth
[41:58] vindication of god's spoken word is it
[42:00] coming to pass
[42:04] just like the logos in the beginning
[42:06] god spoke the word in creation genesis
[42:08] chapter 1
[42:10] the revealing of god's thought of
[42:13] creation on the earth
[42:16] was vindicated by
[42:19] the growing of the trees and the grass
[42:21] and the animals and the fish and
[42:23] everything every breathing thing that
[42:25] was the vindication
[42:27] of god's spoken word
[42:29] what god does one way he does
[42:32] the same all the way through
[42:35] it had to bring forth life
[42:38] the logos when god spoke over the earth
[42:41] the logos had to bring forth life
[42:44] the spoken word
[42:47] the seeds in the earth had they didn't
[42:49] have a choice they had to bring forth
[42:51] the life commanded from the logos
[42:54] and you as the bride of christ will
[42:57] bring forth life because the word logos
[43:00] is hovering over the church
[43:05] and you
[43:06] well maybe you some people i know people
[43:09] struggle with that
[43:10] but let me tell you something for that
[43:12] to fail
[43:14] is for god to fail
[43:16] for the word of god to not bring forth
[43:19] people who are
[43:21] prisoners of christ
[43:23] is for god to fail because what god did
[43:26] once he does the same all the way
[43:29] through he's jesus christ the same
[43:30] yesterday today and forever and we know
[43:32] that it is impossible for god to fail
[43:37] that seed that the seeds that were in
[43:40] the earth were always there
[43:43] the seed that god gave you was spoken
[43:45] before you even had a clue
[43:47] and how can you be be the eternal
[43:50] quality of christ
[43:52] unless the seed god's given you is
[43:54] eternal it's always there that the
[43:57] eternal seed of god
[43:59] so to make sure you know these aren't my
[44:01] own words the fourth seal in 1963 i was
[44:03] talking to a person not long ago was
[44:05] trying to discuss with me saying aren't
[44:07] you ashamed to say that god created the
[44:08] heavens and the earth in three days
[44:11] or in six days i said well that what the
[44:14] bible said said well we got evidence and
[44:16] can prove that the world is millions of
[44:19] years old i said that didn't have
[44:21] anything to do with it in genesis 1 1 it
[44:23] said
[44:24] in the beginning god created the heavens
[44:26] and earth period
[44:30] in other words there could have been a
[44:32] whole
[44:33] millions of years in between verse 1 and
[44:34] verse two
[44:37] that's all see now the world was out
[44:39] form and void and i said i believe every
[44:42] seed was laying right there
[44:45] from some other civilization or
[44:46] something and as soon as the water
[44:48] lifted off and the light struck it
[44:51] up come the trees and everything
[44:53] and the same thing with the human being
[44:55] is a type when all the mist had moved
[44:58] away
[44:59] and the revealed truth to that real seed
[45:02] laying there is still germatized and the
[45:05] light of the gospel can strike it
[45:08] by
[45:09] by true a vindication of the word it'll
[45:12] live it's got life in it it will it'll
[45:16] believe
[45:17] outside of that it can't live it hasn't
[45:19] got no life in it
[45:21] so the seeds on the earth were already
[45:24] laying there in the soil
[45:27] and everything needed for that seed to
[45:30] bring forth of what it was the life that
[45:32] it was to bring forth was packed into
[45:35] that seed
[45:36] all the instructions all the details
[45:38] everything was in that scene it just
[45:41] took the logos brooding over the earth
[45:44] and the light of the and that light
[45:48] to bring to begin to unfold that seed's
[45:51] potential now you as a child of god the
[45:54] seed of christ inside of you has things
[45:56] not yet manifested on the outside
[46:00] but as the logos the word of god broods
[46:03] over your heart over your soul it begins
[46:06] to unfold everything in that seed so
[46:10] that's why brother man says you know the
[46:11] rapture isn't something we have to go
[46:13] find
[46:14] it's right here with us
[46:16] because the rapturing faith is already
[46:19] in your seed
[46:20] it just has yet to unfold
[46:24] praise the lord so from the beginning
[46:27] when god spoke your name
[46:30] he had no doubts about you
[46:32] it always comes back
[46:34] it always comes back the word of god now
[46:36] you know you some i know
[46:38] growing up in the message certain words
[46:40] triggered my brain to turn off as a
[46:42] young kid
[46:43] logos seals
[46:45] my very swing
[46:46] [Music]
[46:48] but and so those those things are
[46:50] considered by some um to be deep and and
[46:53] maybe they were preached a certain way
[46:55] and maybe you heard them face a certain
[46:57] way that that um
[46:58] um
[46:59] maybe were complicated but the problem
[47:01] the thing with this is it always comes
[47:03] back
[47:05] to something that you're gonna take home
[47:07] with you
[47:08] uh and that is that
[47:10] the spoken word of god
[47:13] has
[47:14] faith
[47:16] that you
[47:18] will manifest
[47:20] the life of christ so in other words
[47:23] you wake up tomorrow and you're grumpy
[47:27] you don't have to worry you still have
[47:29] choices you got to make the right choice
[47:31] but you will make the right choice
[47:33] because christ is unfolding himself out
[47:36] of you
[47:38] you're going to change
[47:40] as time goes on because christ is
[47:42] unfolding himself out of you
[47:45] because
[47:47] he spoke it in the very beginning
[47:51] and the word of god christ which is the
[47:53] message the the the bible all of this is
[47:56] the logos brooding over you
[48:00] and he has no doubts about you
[48:03] he had faith in his own word now this
[48:06] quote here who is god i love this i
[48:09] don't think i've ever quite heard this
[48:11] i'm sure along the way up maybe but it
[48:13] really stuck out to me this time
[48:15] you can probably i mean
[48:17] maybe i'll glue it on my wall
[48:19] no my wife would kill me but um who is
[48:22] god 1950 where did he make it from i
[48:26] don't know
[48:28] there was nothing to make it from
[48:30] you know that
[48:31] some of you probably have already heard
[48:32] this but um scientists
[48:35] and god had a face off god said all
[48:37] right fine he got tired of listening to
[48:39] them tell him how good they were and how
[48:42] much they could do anything he could do
[48:44] so god said all right fine we'll we'll
[48:46] have a challenge here we'll have a
[48:48] face-off so um a scientist okay all
[48:51] right so the scientists stand there and
[48:53] god stands here
[48:55] and he's and he says so you can do
[48:57] anything i can do and they said
[48:58] absolutely and he's so he
[49:00] said okay so you need to do exactly what
[49:02] i'm going to do and you reach down and
[49:04] picks up a handful of dirt
[49:05] so they reach down to pick up a handful
[49:07] of dirt and god says no get your own
[49:09] dirt
[49:13] so there was nothing to make it from he
[49:15] says but he believed his own word
[49:21] and there was light
[49:23] god
[49:24] you say god has to have faith
[49:27] absolutely
[49:30] he
[49:31] he believed his own word
[49:35] and then there was light
[49:38] he spoke it in other words the logos
[49:41] went out and he had faith in that logos
[49:47] and his faith in that logos brought
[49:50] light
[49:53] now
[49:56] if you are his word manifested
[49:59] raise your hand if you believe that
[50:01] i'm good we're mostly there
[50:03] if you are his word manifested
[50:06] and he has faith in his word
[50:10] then he has faith in you
[50:16] even on your worst day remember god
[50:20] christ has faith in you
[50:22] when you're upset
[50:24] or you've fallen
[50:27] god has faith in you
[50:31] he had faith in gideon or he would have
[50:33] never ever called him
[50:35] see we can look at the story of gideon
[50:37] and
[50:39] um
[50:40] because it's history now and we can see
[50:43] and if we're not careful we could say oh
[50:45] yeah that's it's easy if you're gideon
[50:47] but
[50:52] gideon
[50:54] didn't have any faith it appeared
[50:58] he was hiding from the midianites
[51:02] and but see god called him
[51:05] god said gideon that mighty mount of
[51:07] valor what was god seeing god was seeing
[51:10] the seed inside gideon
[51:13] see gideon was not yet manifesting the
[51:15] attribute of valor can we be honest
[51:18] tonight
[51:20] gideon at that point in time was not
[51:22] manifesting the attribute of valor or
[51:24] bravery or fierceness or confidence
[51:27] none of that but it was there
[51:30] waiting on something
[51:32] and when the when the angel came down to
[51:34] gabriel
[51:36] what is the first thing he does
[51:38] he speaks the word to gideon
[51:41] gideon thy mighty
[51:43] man of valor
[51:45] christ came and he spoke to you
[51:49] sister carrie my bride for the trevor my
[51:52] son my bride
[51:54] god begin to speak the word see don't
[51:56] worry about what you see on the outside
[51:59] just
[52:00] speak the word
[52:02] because it's that spoken word that logos
[52:04] see nothing happened while the earth was
[52:07] without form and void nothing happened
[52:09] it sat there without form and void from
[52:12] all all outward appearances if you were
[52:14] walking through the galaxy and you saw
[52:16] earth you would say oh that thing has
[52:19] nothing there's nothing to that there's
[52:21] no uh there's no life on that
[52:25] but the seeds were already down inside
[52:28] the earth
[52:29] and when god god knew the earth was
[52:32] there see nothing happened till god
[52:35] spoke the word
[52:36] then the logos went out and began to
[52:39] brood over that
[52:41] and it brought what forth we see what we
[52:43] see today but if you look at the outside
[52:46] you say there's no potential for
[52:49] what is life
[52:51] victory
[52:53] you say there's no potential for victory
[52:55] in that
[52:56] you look at somebody and say there's no
[52:58] potential for victory in them so you
[53:00] can't do that because you don't know the
[53:02] sheet that's inside of them or you look
[53:03] at a situation in your life or you need
[53:05] a job or you need a job change or you
[53:08] need a new boss or you you you need a
[53:10] boss
[53:12] you begin to you can look at that
[53:14] situation and say there there's there's
[53:16] no life in there there's no victory in
[53:18] there
[53:19] but you don't know what god has waiting
[53:22] down inside of there
[53:24] and he just wants you to step forward in
[53:27] faith in confidence and have faith in
[53:30] your word
[53:32] based on the word so you have a word but
[53:34] you base your word upon the word
[53:38] then you can have faith in that word and
[53:41] god will back that faith up
[53:43] this is nothing new brother brother said
[53:45] speak that perfect healed body into
[53:48] existence and step into it
[53:51] that's what he said it's your faith okay
[53:54] so so he had faith in gideon amen that
[53:57] scripture while we were yet sinners
[54:00] christ died for us
[54:01] and we can't hardly help some weird
[54:04] looking person out on the street
[54:07] yet that person christ died for them in
[54:11] that state
[54:14] faith in his spoken word christ had
[54:17] faith in his spoken word
[54:19] so
[54:20] when he died for us well we were still
[54:23] sinners
[54:24] he had faith
[54:26] that you would eventually manifest his
[54:29] spoken word
[54:30] it is the rising of the and his his
[54:32] death on the cross
[54:34] was a testament to his faith in his word
[54:40] when you die and fully surrender to
[54:42] christ
[54:44] god recognizes your faith in his word
[54:49] and brings your deliverance brings your
[54:50] victory
[54:52] 1965 it is the rising of the sun but the
[54:54] verb says now the sun at the rising of
[54:56] the sun well there was a time when the
[54:58] world was laying in utter darkness it
[55:00] was without form and was void and it was
[55:02] all covered with water and was laying
[55:04] there in the dark dismal gloomy
[55:06] atmosphere and the spirit of god moved
[55:09] upon that water and said let there be
[55:11] light
[55:12] god had a reason to do that for down
[55:15] beneath that water there was seeds that
[55:17] he had planted
[55:19] and it had to have that sunlight to make
[55:21] it live
[55:22] and the first light was ever given in
[55:24] the earth was god's spoken word
[55:27] so the first light were god's word logos
[55:30] that was the first light the first light
[55:32] that ever struck the earth was god's
[55:33] spoken word he said let there be light
[55:35] and there was light that turned darkness
[55:38] into light it didn't push the darkness
[55:40] away
[55:42] it was a new creation
[55:44] turned the darkness into light and uh in
[55:48] order to bring forth a creation of joy
[55:51] and life upon the earth then the spirit
[55:53] of god as it moved with love and
[55:56] compassion
[55:58] i like them that stands out to me
[55:59] because i
[56:01] i am i am disappointed
[56:03] and uh in some
[56:05] of our brothers and sisters who will
[56:08] stand and look at somebody and and who
[56:10] who's who's not serving god and they'll
[56:13] they'll begin to to say things like you
[56:15] know i i hope their life is miserable
[56:17] and they see that they need god
[56:22] that's only done
[56:23] if it's done in the right attitude
[56:26] the right spirit you don't because if
[56:28] you're not careful you will speak those
[56:30] words about somebody in bitterness
[56:32] because you're upset they don't serve
[56:33] god anymore
[56:35] because you're upset that they're going
[56:37] against what you believe so you take it
[56:39] personal
[56:40] and you begin to say these things out of
[56:42] bitterness and frustration
[56:44] what you're doing is because you have
[56:46] creative power in your words you're now
[56:49] pushing back against potentially pushing
[56:51] back against what god's trying to do but
[56:53] you see compassion
[56:56] now love the love of christ compassion
[56:58] for the verb says with christ braiding
[57:01] the whip
[57:02] and beating those money changers out of
[57:03] the temple
[57:04] so don't misconstrue compassion
[57:07] either there is a time and a place but
[57:09] what you want to do is you want to show
[57:11] forth and you want to speak forth to
[57:14] them if you have the opportunity a lot
[57:16] of us have
[57:17] now the day that we live in family
[57:18] members who aren't serving god or who
[57:20] were serving the living
[57:22] going to church in the message
[57:25] and uh we let's get the chance to speak
[57:28] to them we want to portray christ
[57:30] because it's christ that's going to
[57:31] bring them back
[57:33] you taking newspaper clippings and
[57:35] history books and trying to prove them
[57:38] you're doing exactly what
[57:40] somebody else did to them that convinced
[57:42] them otherwise so you're not going to
[57:44] have any success
[57:45] but if they see christ in you
[57:48] in love and compassion there's no
[57:50] compassion you don't stand for anything
[57:51] contrary to the word of god amen they i
[57:53] believe that that god can use that but
[57:56] if you get the wrong attitude god um
[57:58] it's just
[57:59] you're the one who's going to be flat on
[58:01] your back um
[58:03] praise the lord been there done that at
[58:05] that great day he says the first day of
[58:07] the dawn of creation upon the earth the
[58:09] sun rose and swept across its rays and
[58:11] brought up the waters from the earth and
[58:13] made an atmosphere above
[58:15] and for its first time it was to bring
[58:18] joy and life to the earth by a seed that
[58:21] was a great hour amen
[58:24] the world so the world was made by faith
[58:27] and creation or or it was a miracle
[58:30] because it made things which are now out
[58:32] of things which were not
[58:34] praise the lord
[58:40] now uh
[58:41] i have quite a few quotes in here i
[58:42] might skip over one here
[58:52] i'm just going to highlight it uh in
[58:54] church age book
[58:55] chapter 8 philadelphia church age
[58:57] i'm gonna bring out my highlights in
[58:59] here it was as when egypt was so dark
[59:01] that one could feel it are we there
[59:03] today
[59:05] the darkness is pretty thick
[59:07] but now true light has come
[59:10] but now the fulfillment of the light has
[59:12] come
[59:13] and what was but glowing word has now
[59:16] broken forth in the brightness of god
[59:18] manifested among his people
[59:20] as the pillar of fire gave light at
[59:22] night and that was wonderful now light
[59:24] and life were manifested in the fullness
[59:26] of the godhead bodily
[59:28] praise the lord so now um
[59:32] praise the lord
[59:35] second kings chapter five i'm gonna skip
[59:37] a few things here and feeling led to
[59:39] just leave that alone um second kings
[59:41] chapter five if you wanna turn there
[59:43] we're gonna take this story here
[59:45] it's a very familiar story and as i've
[59:47] said many times
[59:49] over the pulpit here
[59:51] you uh have it in your in your mind you
[59:54] remember stories in the bible
[59:57] but it's good to go back
[59:59] and re-read them and so i was feeling i
[1:00:02] was thinking about the story of naaman
[1:00:04] the other day and um
[1:00:06] i decided to go back in and read it
[1:00:08] again and and you read it with different
[1:00:11] uh seasons in your life different
[1:00:12] experiences you've gone to
[1:00:14] gone through up to this point and and
[1:00:16] you begin to see things and i believe
[1:00:17] also god brings things from this his
[1:00:19] word because it is eternal and um so a
[1:00:22] few things just kind of spoke to my
[1:00:24] heart and i believe they fit very
[1:00:26] perfectly in what we're talking about
[1:00:28] tonight so i think in king chapter 5 you
[1:00:30] can read it now or you can read it later
[1:00:32] 1-19
[1:00:34] now naaman captain of the host of the
[1:00:36] king of syria was a great man with his
[1:00:38] master and honorable because by him the
[1:00:41] lord had given deliverance unto syria
[1:00:44] he was also a maddie man of valor stop
[1:00:46] don't read the rest
[1:00:48] he's a great man
[1:00:50] he's honorable
[1:00:52] the lord used him to bring deliverance
[1:00:56] he was a mighty man of valor
[1:01:00] there was one caveat
[1:01:02] he was a leper
[1:01:05] and the syrians had gone out by
[1:01:07] companies and had brought away a captive
[1:01:09] out of the land of israel a little maid
[1:01:11] and she waited on naaman's wife see you
[1:01:13] can be many many great things but
[1:01:16] without christ
[1:01:17] you were a leper
[1:01:20] and she said unto her mistress would god
[1:01:21] my lord were with the prophet that is in
[1:01:24] samaria for he would recover him of
[1:01:27] leprosy see two verses there this little
[1:01:30] maid gets and i i've talked about this
[1:01:32] with the youth but what how many years
[1:01:34] of heartache did she go through to bring
[1:01:36] her to that position
[1:01:38] see god has a position for all of us and
[1:01:41] how we get to that position it depends
[1:01:43] entirely upon his will for our life
[1:01:47] she probably lost her family
[1:01:50] she was taken captive who knows where
[1:01:53] her family is maybe separated from them
[1:01:54] maybe she's gone through a lot but now
[1:01:56] she's here and she's in position and
[1:01:59] she's submitting to the authority of
[1:02:01] christ and allowing the logos to speak
[1:02:04] through her and says hey
[1:02:07] there's a prophet in samaria
[1:02:10] and
[1:02:11] see we we don't know we
[1:02:13] one conversation one one phrase to
[1:02:16] somebody could be a seat planted that we
[1:02:19] will never see the fruition of that on
[1:02:21] this side
[1:02:22] but let us not be caught up in what we
[1:02:25] can see from our own works
[1:02:27] but not worry about it and every chance
[1:02:29] we get speak the word of god
[1:02:32] and one went in and told his lord saying
[1:02:34] thus and thus said the maid that is of
[1:02:35] the land of israel and the king of syria
[1:02:38] said go to go i will send a letter unto
[1:02:40] the king of israel
[1:02:43] he departed and took with him ten
[1:02:45] talents of silver and six thousand
[1:02:46] pieces of gold and ten changes of
[1:02:49] raiment and he brought the letter to the
[1:02:50] king of israel saying now when this
[1:02:52] letter has come unto thee behold i have
[1:02:54] therewith sin name and my servant to
[1:02:56] thee that thou mayest recover him of his
[1:02:59] leprosy and it came to pass when the
[1:03:01] king of israel had read the letter that
[1:03:02] he rent his clothes and said am i god to
[1:03:04] kill and to make a lie that this man
[1:03:06] hath sent unto me to recover a man of
[1:03:09] his leprosy wherefore consider i pray
[1:03:12] you and see how he seeketh a quarrel
[1:03:14] against me there is a message and a word
[1:03:18] in this king's kingdom
[1:03:21] that can bring the solution to this
[1:03:24] problem and immediately there's no hope
[1:03:28] and it's elisha
[1:03:30] who sends to the king and says send him
[1:03:32] my way
[1:03:34] verse 8 and it was so when elisha the
[1:03:36] man of god had heard that the king of
[1:03:37] israel had rented his clothes that he
[1:03:39] sent to the king saying wherefore has
[1:03:42] thyroid thy clothes why are you
[1:03:43] distressed i was praying in the office
[1:03:45] before coming tonight
[1:03:47] you know the lord is such a good a good
[1:03:49] father
[1:03:50] he takes care of his of his people he's
[1:03:52] such a good husband
[1:03:53] to his bride
[1:03:55] so why do we worry what what do we rent
[1:03:58] our clothes and and and
[1:04:01] and be dramatic
[1:04:03] about what we're experiencing
[1:04:05] you know
[1:04:08] you know we were acting like we broke
[1:04:09] our arm and we just stubbed our toe
[1:04:13] i'm still in the debate of which one's
[1:04:15] actually worse
[1:04:17] he says let him come now to me and he
[1:04:19] shall know that there is a prophet in
[1:04:21] israel in other words he shall know the
[1:04:23] word of god
[1:04:25] so naaman came with his horses and with
[1:04:27] his chariots and stood at the door of
[1:04:29] the house of elisha and elisa elisha
[1:04:32] sent a messenger unto him
[1:04:36] now we're watching
[1:04:38] the word of god
[1:04:40] naaman was without form and void
[1:04:43] he had all these potentials but he he
[1:04:45] was missing one thing and and that was
[1:04:47] that he was a leper he was a sinner
[1:04:49] leprosy is a type of sin
[1:04:51] he had sin he was not yet complete he
[1:04:54] was without form and void but he had the
[1:04:56] potential to be exactly what god wanted
[1:04:59] him to be but god had to get him to the
[1:05:02] place where his word could be spoken
[1:05:05] over naaman
[1:05:07] spoken to naaman
[1:05:09] so we all have a different path to get
[1:05:11] to that point where the word of god is
[1:05:12] spoken but god pre-ordained have foreign
[1:05:16] that time in that place so now here
[1:05:19] we're looking at naaman coming to this
[1:05:21] position
[1:05:22] and
[1:05:24] this really brings this this thought
[1:05:26] down to where the rubber meets the road
[1:05:29] and that is
[1:05:34] that we all have things that that that
[1:05:38] um
[1:05:40] i should say i should say this
[1:05:43] we all come
[1:05:45] to our deliverance to our victory
[1:05:49] to our healing when we overcome
[1:05:52] things that
[1:05:53] conflict
[1:05:55] with the word of god in our life
[1:05:57] so naaman had a problem
[1:06:00] he said yeah it was leprosy
[1:06:03] god could see deeper into the heart of
[1:06:05] naaman
[1:06:07] the cause for name and sin neymar's
[1:06:10] leprosy was his
[1:06:12] pride
[1:06:15] naaman comes to the king in all his
[1:06:17] glory
[1:06:18] and then he says go to the prophet and
[1:06:20] oh another another
[1:06:22] prestigious man well known in israel
[1:06:25] takes his chariots and his men and goes
[1:06:26] to the prophet
[1:06:29] and the prophet sends a messenger
[1:06:32] not much glory in that
[1:06:34] it's the messenger
[1:06:37] washington jordan river seven times and
[1:06:39] thy flesh shall come again to thee and
[1:06:40] thou shalt be clean but naaman was wrath
[1:06:42] he was upset are you kidding me
[1:06:45] he's like i i i thought i would come to
[1:06:48] the prophet he would come out to me he
[1:06:50] would stand and call in the name of the
[1:06:52] lord and strike his hand over the place
[1:06:54] and recover the leper
[1:06:57] in other words
[1:06:58] his expectation
[1:07:01] for his deliverance didn't line up with
[1:07:04] the word of god so he went away angry
[1:07:08] and i've said this before too we pray
[1:07:10] for god to give us bread it gives us a
[1:07:12] kitchen and all the ingredients and we
[1:07:15] storm out of the kitchen
[1:07:19] that's actually another sermon on the
[1:07:20] logos i might have this this three-part
[1:07:22] thing going here i'm not really sure
[1:07:24] but the logos
[1:07:26] expectations god had expectations but
[1:07:30] naaman's expectations didn't line up
[1:07:32] with those so until naaman's
[1:07:35] expectations lined up with them there
[1:07:37] was no victory over name and sin
[1:07:43] so he says are not the abana and farpa
[1:07:45] rivers of damascus better than all the
[1:07:48] waters of israel may are not washing
[1:07:50] them and be clean so he turned and went
[1:07:52] away in a rage not just mad or upset a
[1:07:55] rage
[1:07:58] red in the face
[1:07:59] kicking the chariot wheels
[1:08:01] smacking the horses harder than you
[1:08:03] should
[1:08:04] a rage
[1:08:05] see he kind of had partial truth there
[1:08:08] didn't matter the river
[1:08:11] any of those rivers would have worked
[1:08:13] but you see the lord knew
[1:08:16] naaman thought that jordan river was
[1:08:17] plain nasty
[1:08:21] it would be no big thing for naaman to
[1:08:23] take a bath in habana or pharpa
[1:08:26] easy
[1:08:27] it's no big thing for people to walk
[1:08:29] into a church that is just
[1:08:31] state of the art
[1:08:33] fancy
[1:08:35] a preacher is composed never takes his
[1:08:38] suit coat off
[1:08:39] never leaves the pulpit
[1:08:41] service is about 15 minutes
[1:08:44] all the all the music and everything is
[1:08:46] just perfect the sound is perfect
[1:08:49] the glass cathedrals right
[1:08:53] i don't know where i was going with that
[1:08:55] anyways
[1:08:58] right it's easy to go to a place like
[1:09:00] that you feel comfortable there's lots
[1:09:02] of people
[1:09:04] but when you go when god calls you to go
[1:09:07] somewhere and it's
[1:09:09] old
[1:09:11] and shabby
[1:09:13] the people are a little bit touched
[1:09:17] still god's people just different than
[1:09:19] what you would consider normal
[1:09:23] um
[1:09:24] it's not always easy or god asks you to
[1:09:26] do something
[1:09:27] you know you wanna you wanna you wanna
[1:09:29] buy that nice old lady her latte in line
[1:09:31] at starbucks but maybe he wants you to
[1:09:33] help that
[1:09:35] man who fell on the sidewalk who's
[1:09:37] covered in his own waist stand back on
[1:09:40] his feet
[1:09:41] right it's different
[1:09:43] sometimes serving god is very messy
[1:09:46] see so but god was trying to get to
[1:09:48] naaman and naaman's
[1:09:49] the um the key to to his to naaman's
[1:09:53] deliverance the key
[1:09:54] was humility it could have been another
[1:09:57] river there was nothing special about
[1:09:59] the river jordan
[1:10:00] nothing special about the water you're
[1:10:02] baptized in it's your action upon
[1:10:05] the god upon god's word
[1:10:08] that has the power behind it
[1:10:10] and his servants came near and spake
[1:10:13] unto him and said my father if the
[1:10:14] prophet had been they do some great
[1:10:16] thing would thou not have done it how
[1:10:18] much rather than when he saith to thee
[1:10:20] wash and be clean
[1:10:22] god hiding himself in simplicity the
[1:10:23] word of god is simple
[1:10:25] but that doesn't mean it's easy to apply
[1:10:28] all the time
[1:10:31] and his servants came
[1:10:33] so his the the word of god went forth
[1:10:37] naaman received the word but it was
[1:10:39] through his servants
[1:10:41] who took the word given through their
[1:10:44] perspective with the anointing of the
[1:10:46] holy spirit
[1:10:48] that turned naaman to follow the word of
[1:10:50] god
[1:10:52] his servants
[1:10:53] five-fold ministry
[1:10:56] and it wasn't it wasn't what the prophet
[1:10:58] said
[1:10:59] that cured naaman
[1:11:03] i said well brother chris is just
[1:11:05] blasphemed
[1:11:08] this is what killed naaman then he went
[1:11:11] he down and dipped himself seven times
[1:11:14] in jordan according to the saying of the
[1:11:16] man of god and his flesh came again like
[1:11:18] under the flesh of a little child and he
[1:11:20] was clean
[1:11:23] his obedience
[1:11:25] to
[1:11:26] the word given
[1:11:29] is what cured him
[1:11:30] you can sit and hear read the bible you
[1:11:33] can sit and hear a tape all day long but
[1:11:36] if that word is never applied in your
[1:11:39] life
[1:11:39] you will not find the cure
[1:11:43] his action based on the word given
[1:11:47] see faith gave him the courage to act
[1:11:51] it's faith in god's word that gave him
[1:11:54] the courage to act so his humility was
[1:11:57] the key and his obedience to the word of
[1:11:59] god was the cure
[1:12:03] so now naaman is risen from the ashes
[1:12:06] his life had been without form and void
[1:12:10] good
[1:12:11] but not
[1:12:12] all the way not whole
[1:12:16] amen but the logos hovered over him
[1:12:19] and it was the light of god the light of
[1:12:22] christ that brought his deliverance
[1:12:27] psalms 20 verse and i'm closing here
[1:12:30] and they are brought down and fallen but
[1:12:32] we are risen and stand upright psalms 20
[1:12:36] verse 8.
[1:12:41] see maybe there's something that that
[1:12:42] that that was in it that was in your
[1:12:45] life is in your life and god's calling
[1:12:47] you to make and to to to step forward in
[1:12:50] faith
[1:12:51] to to act upon his word given but
[1:12:55] because
[1:12:56] he asked you to wash in the river jordan
[1:13:01] because he asked you to do something
[1:13:02] that is humbling
[1:13:05] sometimes
[1:13:07] we can struggle with that
[1:13:10] that is hard to swallow
[1:13:12] but
[1:13:13] this scripture here gives us a promise
[1:13:15] psalms 20 verse 8
[1:13:17] they are brought down and fallen if you
[1:13:19] go and read the chapter the enemy
[1:13:22] the the the the devil
[1:13:25] the opposition is brought down and
[1:13:28] fallen but we
[1:13:30] are risen and stand upright
[1:13:33] when the low gospel was brooding over
[1:13:36] the earth
[1:13:38] amen victory came life came from that
[1:13:44] and life rose from the earth
[1:13:48] just like when god moves in your life
[1:13:50] amen you will rise up and stand upright
[1:13:53] stand on your own two feet
[1:13:55] but also upright and righteousness all
[1:13:59] righteousness is but filthy rags but
[1:14:01] with god
[1:14:02] and when we stand clean and forgiven we
[1:14:06] stand clothed in his righteousness
[1:14:10] amen we can we can go and read the story
[1:14:12] in ezekiel but
[1:14:15] about the dry bones you see
[1:14:18] god
[1:14:19] gives ezekiel a vision of these of these
[1:14:22] dry bones
[1:14:24] and he asks him he says ezekiel can
[1:14:26] these dry bones live
[1:14:29] again
[1:14:32] you can't have dry bones
[1:14:35] unless you first had life
[1:14:38] you dry bones come from what was life
[1:14:47] and so he says can these dry bones live
[1:14:50] again ezekiel says you only you know
[1:14:53] lord
[1:14:54] and the lord says speak to them
[1:14:57] and so the
[1:14:58] what is ezekiel he speaks in other words
[1:15:01] in other words god the logos anoints
[1:15:04] ezekiel to speak the word to the dry
[1:15:07] bones
[1:15:09] it's the same thing as the earth so
[1:15:11] speak the word
[1:15:13] to the dry bones of your life the dry
[1:15:15] blooms of your relationship
[1:15:17] the dry bones of your relationship with
[1:15:18] christ with your with with your family
[1:15:20] member or your husband or your kid speak
[1:15:24] god's word i like ezekiel god has
[1:15:26] already given you the vision
[1:15:29] you just have to be willing
[1:15:31] to speak the word
[1:15:34] and if you want to speak the word you
[1:15:36] have to have the word to speak
[1:15:39] and that is not that you stand up and
[1:15:41] you just start preaching to that person
[1:15:44] your life speaks volumes
[1:15:47] how you live your life so if you are
[1:15:49] harnessed to the word of god and the
[1:15:52] logos is moving upon your life your life
[1:15:56] as you live it is going to speak
[1:15:59] christ it's going to bring forth that
[1:16:02] spoken word
[1:16:06] we don't know what happened to those dry
[1:16:08] bones or what brought them into this
[1:16:11] lifeless state
[1:16:13] but the potential for them to live was
[1:16:16] still there
[1:16:18] and the word of god spoke amen and they
[1:16:21] came forth
[1:16:24] praise the lord that musicians want to
[1:16:26] come tonight
[1:16:29] amen
[1:16:32] naaman had to lay down and surrender
[1:16:36] colossians 3 3 for ye are dead and your
[1:16:39] life is hid with christ in god
[1:16:43] so you are now dead in christ
[1:16:46] when you
[1:16:48] surrender to the lord to the dealing
[1:16:50] that he's doing in your life
[1:16:53] you become dead in christ
[1:16:56] now you're in a position like the dry
[1:16:58] bones like the earth you're in a
[1:17:00] position to receive life
[1:17:04] amen through the logos or the full
[1:17:06] manifestation of the word hovering over
[1:17:09] your void
[1:17:10] and it's christ's spoken word
[1:17:13] see it doesn't end there maybe you have
[1:17:14] dry bones maybe there is darkness and
[1:17:16] void but it doesn't end there because
[1:17:18] the word of god speaks
[1:17:20] and what was my subtitle
[1:17:21] and there was light
[1:17:25] never ever
[1:17:27] are you left without hope
[1:17:29] never
[1:17:30] and god's word always goes out
[1:17:33] excuse me god's word goes out and never
[1:17:36] returns void
[1:17:40] so if he spoke you to this age
[1:17:44] and
[1:17:45] called you to be here
[1:17:48] you will come
[1:17:50] you will go and return to him
[1:17:52] because you're his spoken word
[1:17:57] i i know all of you very well for a
[1:18:00] small church and sometimes when god lays
[1:18:02] things like this on my heart
[1:18:04] i i don't know i think that i think that
[1:18:06] this will not apply to anybody because
[1:18:09] we're perfect
[1:18:12] just kidding i don't think you've heard
[1:18:13] me i love you but
[1:18:16] so
[1:18:17] [Music]
[1:18:18] i i don't know
[1:18:20] if if
[1:18:21] god spoke to your heart excuse me
[1:18:24] god spoke to your heart
[1:18:26] you had to have faith that what god laid
[1:18:29] on my heart is for all of you one of you
[1:18:33] and and i was talking to my wife
[1:18:35] a message because i i have to i'll i'll
[1:18:37] break the
[1:18:38] bad news to you i preach this on sundays
[1:18:42] welcome to the second version
[1:18:44] it's always different because god's word
[1:18:47] is spoken and we we stand up here and we
[1:18:49] preach
[1:18:50] read the same scriptures read the same
[1:18:51] quotes but you and your experiences and
[1:18:54] your season hear exactly what you need
[1:18:56] to hear i can have i can have sometimes
[1:18:59] you will you know
[1:19:00] you'll share something with me or
[1:19:02] afterwards and it'll be
[1:19:04] [Music]
[1:19:05] technically three different sermons but
[1:19:07] it all came from the same one
[1:19:10] and so
[1:19:12] i don't know
[1:19:13] the deepest darkest secrets of your life
[1:19:16] don't want to know them
[1:19:18] um
[1:19:19] if god spoke to your heart tonight
[1:19:22] and i believe he has
[1:19:24] and he's calling you to action
[1:19:27] don't
[1:19:28] confuse that with with just me
[1:19:32] you see me all the time
[1:19:35] you know me you know my weaknesses
[1:19:39] you've seen me get frustrated
[1:19:40] unfortunately
[1:19:42] um but don't sit and just say oh you
[1:19:45] know
[1:19:46] chris spoke tonight
[1:19:48] we had church
[1:19:50] god every service whether it's it's me
[1:19:53] speaking or brother or pastor speaking
[1:19:56] or brother david speaking
[1:19:58] god is calling you to action
[1:20:04] and to step it to to to take faith and
[1:20:08] to put god's word to action
[1:20:11] it can be written of you in the
[1:20:13] scriptures
[1:20:15] just like nathan
[1:20:16] you washed in the river
[1:20:18] if you received the holy ghost you
[1:20:20] washed in the river jordan right that's
[1:20:21] it that's the ultimate type of river
[1:20:23] jordan
[1:20:26] so i trust that that that tonight if i
[1:20:29] if i
[1:20:30] said something that was direct look i
[1:20:33] don't know
[1:20:34] but god knows
[1:20:36] i think i know you but
[1:20:38] there's parts to all of us that only god
[1:20:41] knows
[1:20:42] so what i'm saying what i'm trying to
[1:20:45] say tonight is is take the word take it
[1:20:47] serious
[1:20:49] take it serious
[1:20:51] god has spoken to to i hope god has
[1:20:53] spoken to your heart and trust he has
[1:20:55] he's spoken to my heart and we have been
[1:20:57] called to
[1:21:00] let's not stand on the sidelines and let
[1:21:03] somebody else
[1:21:04] do all the work
